3926969,1,B002HEXVUI,"Here we have James Cameron's new film; chock full of CGI, boring action and....well, that's it, really, nothing else at all.

So, a group of human soldiers invade a foreign planet, and the residents are peeved; so, it's Starship Troopers, but without any intelligent satire or....anything really.

Don't give me this ""movies are supposed to entertain"" argument either; that's only one part of the role of a film, but Cameron isn't aware of this; from his days under Roger Corman (where he should have stayed) to his newest 11 year old boy's wet dream he's proved this.

I end the review with a quote, on Cameron, by a man who understands cinema in its totality:

""Cameron isn't evil, he's not an a-hole like Spielberg. He wants to be the new De Mille. Unfortunately, he can't direct his way out of a paper bag.""",1260921600,28,811,4.65034965034965
3926970,5,B002HEXVUI,"AVATAR

 In my opinion Avatar proves that you can make a great movie without name stars.  A great script and a really good director can do it by themselves.

On a lush planet called Pandora live the Na'vi, beings who appear primitive but actually are highly evolved. Because Pandora's environment is poisonous, human/Na'vi hybrids, called Avatars, are linked to human minds, allowing for free movement on Pandora. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paralyzed former Marine, becomes whole again through one such Avatar, and falls in love with a Na'vi woman (Zoe Saldana). As his bond with her grows, he is drawn into a battle for the survival of her world

 In my opinion Avatar proves that you can make a great movie without name stars.  A great script and a really good director can do it by themselves.

I can't recommend this movie enough.

3926971,5,B002HEXVUI,"Truly mindbending, Avatar is everything you expect it to be from visual standpoint, Cameron has created a brand new world here for sci-fi fans, and it feels right that he is back home in the sci-fi universe after the runaway success of Titanic. I was lucky enough to see this film at an advanced screening and all in attendance walked away in awe of what we had witnessed visually, even if the story is lacking as a whole. Said story is set in the year 2154 and involves a mission by U. S. Armed Forces to an earth-sized moon in orbit around a massive star. This new world, Pandora, is a rich source of a mineral Earth desperately needs. Pandora is a planetary forest inhabited by the peacful and graceful Na'vi, a blue-skinned, golden-eyed race of giants, each about 12 feet tall. We nevertheless send in the military to attack and conquer, though they are not a threat to us. There is clearly a military allegory about the nature of war mongering and the ""noble savages"" who often end up standing  in the way of the conquering superpower. Luckily Cameron controls his narrative from falling into the muck before it becomes an offensive stereotype by imbuing the story with heartfelt,if ocasionally stiff characterization. the hero, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a paraplegic, recruited because he's a genetic match for a dead identical twin, who an expensive avatar was orignally created for. On Pandora, Jake is a good soldier and then goes native after his life is saved by the brave Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) who if she keeps this great acting up, (voice acting in this case) especially after Star Trek, may find herself with rockstar status in the scifi universe. Sigourney Weaver has a great turn in this film as well and turns in a strong performance. It is wonderful to see her back in a James Cameron film.  Michelle Rodriguez also makes a good turn in what could have been a throw away role. Visually he has unveiled the next generation of 3-D in ""Avatar and wow does it leave you in awe! The interiors and rain forests in this film are like nothing you have ever seen and even the Na'vi are rendered so beautifully you can almost use the word sexy, both in their stop motion movements and the CGI. The creatures in this film are also a sight to behold, from the beauty of graceful, flying dragons which contains one of the films best scenes as Jakes tries to ride one of these beasts, to creatures that look like a mix between dandelion seeds and a jelly fish, and even the rendering of clouds, there is beauty in every frame. The entire range of his talent is on display here. Even more wonderfully he does so by never going so far as to create what some might call the ""4th wall"", or 4D animation. There is no need. He has left that territory for other directors. This is a world that lives and breathes in a way that is truly remarkable. Me thinks that if Stanley Kubrick's characters in ""2001"" had travelled even further they may have found a race just like this. Trippy and glorious, Avatar delivers Sci Fi like we have rarely seen it, making it a Merry holiday for Sci-fi fans Everywhere. This one will be off the wall in IMAX-- Get those tickets if you can, you will not be dissapointed that you did, trust me!

A former soldier comes to another planet where he learns their language and their ways and leads them into battle to save his princess and her people. That was the plot of the novel and this movie both, only updated with an environmental message attached to the movie.

3927104,2,B002HEXVUI,"Pros: Great special effects (a given nowadays) and spectacular world building and concepts, awesome soundtrack.
The flora and fauna of Pandora is very impressive, believable, and eye-catching. Love the animals! The planet itself functioning almost as its own organism (I won't spoil it with how) is a really cool concept that is well-explored throughout the movie and leaves you wondering what other secrets Pandora has yet to reveal. Two stars for world-building.
The soundtrack by James Horner (RIP) is beautiful, inspiring, and at times brought tears to my eyes. Treat yourself to the extended version.

Cons: The story is all stereotypes and cliches.
We have our first stereotype Jake. He is the white savior / diamond-in-the-rough kinda guy who is disillusioned by Hollywood's ideal white man society. It is corrupt, greedy, environmentally destructive, treats its women badly, and utterly nonredeemable. Not sure what Jake's problem is, but he clearly needs to be saved by Neytiri (several times).
Our hero falls in with the local native non-Americans called the Na'vi. Classic noble savages, they are one with the land and its animals, have no vices or physical defects, no flaws of any kind, but still need to be led by Neytiri.
The villains of the story, guess what, are the usual male-dominated corporation. They're not after gold or land (James Cameron was original there), but nonetheless will get what they want, and destroying the pristine noble savage way of life is just part of the fun. Someone really needs to be killed by Neytiri.
Adding to the mix is our noble scientist Dr. Grace and soldier Trudy. Both of these ladies must sacrifice their lives for taking a stand. Someone really, really, really needs to be killed by Neytiri.
And we cannot forget Neytiri, who is not only politically correct, she is politically AWESOME!!! She is tough as nails, sexy and exotic, very wise as well as jungle-smart, but having the feminine nurturing side, she cures Jake of his insanity (and other needs), so that he can unite the tribes, and uh well, save the world.
But don't worry, I'm sure the white man will return in the sequel!!!",1516838400,,2142,4.983240223463687

3927143,5,B002HEXVUI,"What can be said about this great movie that hasn't been already stated.  This was by far the very best movie of 2010, and could make its case of being one of the top ten movies of all time.  But of course, nothing is normal in Hollywood, and to think a movie like the ""Hurt Locker"" took best picture honors at the Oscars over ""Avatar"" shows the clueless nature of the Oscars.  Of all the categories within the checklist of determining which movie should win best picture, Avatar won them all....all.  Eight years after its release, Avatar continues to sell, and anticipation talk continues of the upcoming sequels of this awesome movie.  By the way, I really liked the movie The Hurt Locker, but it was not the best picture of 2010, Avatar was.  The Hurt Locker got the statue, but Avatar made all the money.  Let's compare:  Worldwide Box Office Gross Receipt Totals....The Hurt Locker...$49,894,000.  Pretty good, huh!  Avatar...$2,783,918,000 (yes, that is billions).  It has always been the best and most accurate determination of the best movie by seeing how much money people spent to see it, and Avatar continues to be the top movie of all time in Worldwide Box Office Receipt totals.",1513123200,2,1192,4.765853658536585

3927151,3,B002HEXVUI,a rehash of so many sci-fi and white man takes advantage of the primitives stories. That being said it's a beautifully made movie and groundbreaking special effects. You could watch it with the sound off and still be impressed (perhaps even more impressed).

3927181,2,B002HEXVUI,"Love the movie... hate the packaging, the discs skipping and the sound cuts out and the fact the movie is on multiple discs.  The movie blanks out and flickers throughout the disc, this happened for the first two discs. Have not tried the third one yet.  I am able to play all my other discs without issue, but not these.  The packaging is horrible.  First you have to slide the box out of the sleeve which is really tight.  Next you have to remove the package with the discs from a second box with a side opening.  Last the movies are inserted into a cardboard booklet that requires you to slide a sleeve out for each disc.",1509753600,,624,4.2905982905982905

Even if the problem is with our internet, we should be able to cancel our rental considering we stopped watching after 5 minutes of content.

It was entertaining, fairly feminist and.provided a profound commentary on.our relationship with nature and the inhumanity of the military industrial complex.

With google wifi I can test my internet connection speed from my phone. Well, during the movie it was stumbling, so I checked -- the 4K TV was only pulling 22 mbps downloading while my connection was providing 158 mbps. Therefore, there should not have been any stumbling or glitches while streaming. The reason I upgraded the hardware was because I was seeing problems with streaming on Amazon. After upgrading, I realize we don't have issues with Netflix or Playstation Vue -- it is an Amazon specific problem. I like prime and Amazon's content - especially the 4K, but really if you are going to offer a streaming service, the most important thing to get right is the streaming quality!!!",1507420800,,818,4.767605633802817

My understanding of it on initial release was that it was James Cameron's idea of a mega-budget  anti Iraq war screed. I suppose I detected some of that, but I failed to find it overwhelmingly so.
Then again, I suppose one can see whatever one desires to see.

I saw a good deal of Native American thought and practice throughout, possibly mixed with Buddhist theory.

The bad white military man and the white rich corporation are there to rape and pillage the unsupecting natives.  I think this is part of the reason there never been a sequel  what are they going to do in the next one invade earth?  Im just saying if you step back and look at it he paints all humans as scum and natives good -so -what? we should all kill ourselves?,1500508800,,505,4.319148936170213

3927333,3,B002HEXVUI,"This wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't feel like one of James Cameron's finest films. The special effects are phenomenal of course (although they occasionally get a bit cheesy - I could never get completely behind the Sigorney Weaver avatar character. It just struck me as funny every time it appeared and actually was a bit distracting.) The story also tends to be a very ham-fisted in the good of the tree people vs. the evils of the military (complete with the big smoke stacks in the background, because evil military people must have evil smokestacks.) The final showdown between the avatar hero (I can't even remember his name, to be honest) and the evil army guy just got super-cheesy - it was at that point the steam was gone form the film and I was ready for it to be over. Again, the effects are fantastic but that's really the strength of this film.",1497225600,,863,4.574193548387097

I felt it was kind of misleading when it said ""buy it now"" - didn't know that when it said that that it meant for the computer.",1497139200,,390,3.619047619047619

3927337,5,B002HEXVUI,"this 3 disc edtion is well worth it,
the first 2 dvd's are about the movie itself,
what you will see is a military man in a wheel chair that rolls into a bar and sees a man beating on a women
 and he believes this is not right and even though he is in the wheel chair, he steps in a
takes out the man and is eventually throw out of the bar and then his wheel chair follows,
thats where the show gets interesting, its not it,
two men in a suits, step over the him while he is laying in the gutter  and tells him his name
and ask for confirmation and when its acknowledged, they proceed to tell him
 if he dies as he is told, they can help him get his life back and make him lots of money,
its not over with yet, he decides to take the risk for his brother that was killed in the marines earlier,
now for the real movie, he ends up in a tube  that sent him to a spaceship in a marine boot camp
now he finds out he will serve as a scientist with other scientist to go a new world
and in this world there are purple people that can fly, they are called ""avartar"" people
he has to fit in as one of them to get there secrets and as the show goes on, there
is alot of stuff, its like a love  and then it goes wrong , then he falls in love and and his people get hurt
and close to the end , its like one on one war to see who is the one that followers the rules
there are lots of colors and be sure you have a good imagination, you will need it, its not silly, its a good story with lots of feelings , some get hurt some die, the third disc, is about deleted scenes in the movie , that has never been seen, at the first of the movie, you will have two choices
of which version you want to see, the theatrical movie , or the updated and extra mins in the movie,",1497052800,,1752,3.7371273712737128

This movie comands and delivers complete emerssion which I loved. Now the fact that I think this move to be the top of movie making art, just made it more agrivatingwhen It came to a screching halt and made me get up, turn on the lights and try to figure out my friends DVD player. Well I lost the experience
 and never fully again regained my immersion. Now I Have seen the movie ten times, in theater 3D then bought the individual disk and watched another 40 times. But it still moves me! So what genious thought that the movie should be in two halves?

3927453,5,B002HEXVUI,"After 8 years, Ive finally succumb to the wonder that is Avatar. The highest grossing film of all time, Avatar has earned its place amongst the centuries best films. Released on December 18, 2009, Avatar is a hybrid of science fiction, fantasy, and action directed by James Cameron, the director of the second highest grossing film of all time. After 8 years, Ive watched the spectacle that is Avatar and I have to admit, its one of the best movies Ive watched in my life and I would recommend it to anyone, though unlikely, who has yet to see it.

The year is 2154, humans have depleted earths resources leading to a severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines Pandora, a moon inhabited by the Nava,10-feet tall, blue-skinned humanoids, for the rare mineral, unobtanium. . While the Navi thrive in Pandoras atmosphere, humans are vulnerable and to explore its biosphere have genetically created Navi-Human hybrids called avatars operated by genetically matched humans. and retired marine, Jake Sully is recruited by the RDA to replace his recently deceased identical twin brother as an operator for one. On a mission as a bodyguard for the head of the Avatar Program, Dr. Grace Augustine, Jake is attacked and separated from the group. At night, hes attacked by animals and saved by Neytiri, a female Navi warrior. Jake is brought before her clan and begins his initiation into the clan. When he sleeps, Jakes conscious is restore to his original body. At base, hes convinced by Colonel Miles Quaritch, the head of the RDAs security forces to earn the trust of and spy on the Navi people in exchange for the surgery that will allow him to walk again.

Over the following three months, Jake begins to sympathize with the Navis and is initiated into their clan. The Hometree where the Navi live sits under the largest deposited of unobtanium and plans for the trees destruction are enacted when diplomacy with the Navi fail. Jake reveals his original mission of spying on the Navi when he tries to convince them to leave their home. He taken prisoner when the invasion of the tree starts, but is eventually released. The invasion continues until the united Navi clans come into the foray, they eventually lose ground until the fauna of Pandora join in repulsing the humans back. After the repulsion, all humans on Pandora are exiled back to the dying Earth, with the except of Jake, whos initiated within the clan once more, and a few scientists.

This is one of the best movies I've watch and I'm surprised I waited 8 years to watch it. Everything about it from the angles, lighting, and plot was well planned out. When I watched it, I was very impressed with its quality and of all movies I've watch, Avatar has been the most vivid. For a movie that was made in 2009, it's exceeded my expectations with it's quality plot and vibrant graphics. Avatar presents a different perspective than most movies in its portrayal of humans as an alien force. Most movies paint aliens as either benevolent being who come to humans with aid or as nefarious beings that plot to overtake the world and enslave the human race. While watching, I couldn't help but notice the parallels between the colonization of Pandora by humans as akin to that of Asia and Africa by European nations. The movie expresses many points of views and depending on your perspective can see humans as a colonizing force or the Navai for being cruel and ignorant in not using their abundant resources and as such, I would recommend this movie to anyone, for those who root for the victims and those who cant help but sympathize the bad guys. Avatar is an excellent movie for all.

3927464,3,B002HEXVUI,"@James_Cameron and @FoxStudios & @Mike_Dunn are pretty much the jerks who won't allow you to have a digital copy of this movie. #Mike_Dunn has such low regard for the content of the film, he thinks that anything less than blu-ray quality video is going to expose the movie to criticism for content. What Mike Dunn doesn't realize is that the movie stands on its own merit better than he thinks it does. I would be furious if I were #James_Cameron that Mike Dunn, the person responsible for making money on this movie doesn't think enough of it to offer a digital copy according to his 2011 interview in Forbes. The three star rating is 100% because this edition doesn't come with a digital copy for enjoyment on streaming services like Vudu (HDX offers near 4K quality on a 4K television) or other streaming services. I personally think that @FoxStudios should consider how someone who views a major release such as Avatar as incapable of standing on its own as a movie before putting them in charge of one of the best movies made this century. Shame on @FoxStudios for hiring such a short sighted person who obviously didn't care for the movie after the awe and wonder of the visuals wore off, and then putting them in charge of that movie.",1486598400,,1241,4.619909502262443

3927549,1,B002HEXVUI,"I thought ordering this online as a download would be so much easier than ordering the older technology of DVD or BlueRay. WRONG! If you are hoping to be able to simply download this as an MP4 or other format such as AVI or WMV and play it where you want, you can't. In fact, you can't even stream it from your phone to Chromecast; and even if you could it would be degraded from 1080 to 720. Just wanted to watch this movie with my family on Christmas Day after getting an Amazon gift card (that I opened on Christmas Eve, hehe). I'm 40 and I shouldn't have to feel like I did when I was a kid getting a toy that required batteries but no stores were open on Christmas. Great movie! Just can't watch it with family unless we all gather around my smartphone thanks to Amazon's greed. Buy the DVD or BlueRay or download from somewhere else.

3927558,5,B002HEXVUI,"I AM REVIEWING THE 3D VERSION AND I INCLUDE NO SPOILERS IN MY REVIEWS!

This movie is exceptional! I should never have waited so long to review it. The story line flows along at a smooth pace never getting dull or slowing down a bit. It is believable and quite entrancing and kept our interest throughout.

A little about the 3D in this film--
The cinematics are absolutely georgous! The 3D is breathtaking at times. I have watched many movies in 3D as I have a huge collection of 3D titles and this title itself is a masterpiece! The 3D is intense and not 'faked' at all. I have a 65"" 3D television that is truely immpressive to watch a good 3D movie on, and a 3D movie that is faked is easy to spot. It helps that this movie was shot in 3D for a theatrical 3D release. There are some that may say this is not a good 3D movie or that it is just a 2D remake, what they might not know is that not all 3D TV's are made the same. Some 3D TV's just don't do very well on some of today's available 3D movies. And then there are some 3D TV's that do an extra good job when displaying 3D as it should be seen. Also I need to point out that this movie is not a remake of a 2D movie. This movie was shot in 3D for a 3D release and theatrical showing, Done using a camera that was specially made for it's filming and was the first 3D film EVER to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture.
 The camera used is called a 'Fusion Camera System' (a.k.a. Reality Camera System 1), it is a Digital movie camera system developed by James Cameron and Vince Pace specifically for Avatar. And that's why the 3D in this movie ROCKS!

Some of the CGI effects used in this movie are truely remarkable and so beautiful. This movie makes a person think 'what could the future hold for us'. It is a fairly believable story line and feels right. The movie does not contain alot of uneccessay blood and gore like some of the recent releases you will find. However, There is a fair amount of violence, but none that you would feel bad for letting the children view. I would have to say that this is a good sit down family movie enjoyable for anyone 10 years old and over. But please be cautioned. there's some strong language in some scenes, so parents should use thier discretion when allowing those under 12 to view.

My recommendation - Get this now, especially in 3D, and ENJOY! ---- We sure did!",1482278400,5,2380,4.187772925764192

So, you will have to change the disc if you want to watch the entire movie(s). The extended features and the deleted sceens are all on disc 3. That is nice at least. The screen quality is good, no problem there. As far as the movie goes I will leave that up to you to like it or not.  It all comes in a nice hardcover type book-one of the nicest packages I have seen. To bad they didn't put the entire movie(s) on it's own disc.

3927679,5,B002HEXVUI,"There are great movies and then there are great movies in 3D. Even if you don't particularly like 3D there are certain movies that you need to see. Top Gun is one. Sanctum is another and Avatar is a must. Not every movie is great in 3D but there are some like the one's I mentioned that are a must see in 3D. This is a good movie with lots of lush colors and the 3D is well done with lots of floating objects and depth. Probably my go-to when I show someone 3D, although the WINGS 3D might have been even better. The video quality is fantastic. I have a Samsung 40"" 3D setup and the movie was just beautiful to watch. Not quite the same as IMAX but very close (size of screen being the only difference that I could see). The 3D is, to my eyes, exactly as good as the IMAX on-screen version. I am a huge fan of the movie but believe me I would tell you if the video quality was not great. You will either love or hate the movie. However, there is no doubt that the 3D material on the disc is amazing. I would not hesitate to do the purchase again (even considering the huge rip-off in price at this time) but advise others to consider if you really have to have it right now or can wait awhile. Great movie, almost unbelievable video transfer quality, and a price that is just not right! Children enjoy the Avatar series and 3D which made this selection perfect for family movie night. Cinematography and graphics were amazing and the theme of inequality among humanoids and big business overrunning and destroying nature, prompted great debate and introspection. We watched this at the theater when first released, and I was blown away by the 3D effects and the movie overall. We watched this Blu-ray in 3D on a screen through a projector in our backyard and I was amazed at how much better the 3D effects were compared with in the theater. It was great! This film was truly made for 3D, which brings out every detail that the director carefully included -- even the little flying bugs in the jungle! It's still OK in 2D, but, once you've added that other dimension, you'll never go back!",1474588800,,2088,4.329081632653061

3927700,1,B002HEXVUI,"I do NOT recommend this version of the movie. For one...they literally took the movie and cut it into three parts and put it on three discs so you get the pleasure of getting up not once but twice during the movie to change discs...OR!!! You could just buy the regular version for about a buck more...I thought I was doing something nice for my husband but these discs are absolute garbage! The discs come in this paper sleeve thing inside the DVD case...they were ALL SCRATCHED UP and skipped half the scenes due to the large gashes that were in the discs we JUST OPENED and carefully removed from the sleeve. The scratches were going in all directions so we were given a damaged product to begin with. I returned this item and paid the dollar and some change more for the ""Original Theatrical Version"" and that one plays perfectly and we're very happy with it. Don't waste your time/money on this version of the movie.",1473552000,3,920,4.514970059880239

3927740,5,B002HEXVUI,An historic leap for cinematic pictures. An independent effort seldom creates anything interesting much less epic. But every once in a while it does happen. The rest of Hollywood didn't even pretend to match it. They were just happy to come close. An army of writers are never going to be able to match an inspired story.,1471478400,,321,4.649122807017544

I'VE NEVER SEEN AVATAR BEFORE!!!

If you have never watched it in 3D then you have NO idea what you're missing. Remember the beginning when Jake wakes up from Cryo in the ship? Not very memorable. I REWOUND IT 3 TIMES TO WATCH IT IN 3D!!!

You can really see what the director was trying to accomplish. You watch these natives and the way they are connected to everything in the world around them, and while watching in 3D, YOU become part of the connection. Please...PLEASE watch this in 3D if you haven't already. I never really cared about watching movies in this format until now. It's the first time I really ""GOT"" why 3D was so amazing.

You'll thank me.

I wasn't expecting the packaging and movie boxes to be such high quality and so nice! I would have been content with just a normal movie cover, but this movie can with three slips over it. The first slip is just a normal cardboard slip that goes over the second covering which is a boxed cover, and much thicker than the first and the third case slips out of the second one, which has the three movie disks in it. Overall, it's very durable and just overall beautiful. Easily my favorite packaged movie. The picture quality and sound is amazing and there are so many awesome features to choose from and it's such a high quality movie! The movie was split onto Disc 1 and Disc 2 so you'll need to get up halfway through to change the disc but it's worth the little extra work! Beautiful product.",1468800000,5,945,4.436781609195402

* More can be accomplished when working together

even though there are some LANGUAGE issues (considering children watching that is)  still allowed my kids to watch it and it's probably one of our (if not the) FAVORITE family movies and can't wait for the PART 2 to come out in December...... my kids all LOVE this movie and we've rented it twice now and they've watched it, I believe 3 or 4x.........  I'm also not OVERLY CONCERNED about a few bad words (neither are they).  Great story about being connected to NATURE, but even HUMAN HISTORY as a whole............... this VERY STORY is the STORY OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION................. people (families) being UPROOTED by ENEMIES and all the pain/suffering that goes along w/ it.......... then how TECHNOLOGY comes along and DESTROYS or WIPES OUT life as we know it, forever changing the way our world is viewed.  The magical/fairy like 'effects' were certainly appreciated by the kids and myself, one who is into science fiction and special effects type movies (of the STAR WARS original generation, I am).

2. No special features in 2 disc Theatrical Edition. If you are a fan, of all the discs in your collection this is the one you really want the extra stuff.
3. 3D version also now available, though not in the extended version yet. This movie is considered a reference disc in 3D and the extensive CGI use makes it a great story to be seen in that medium, as are most animated movies. Hopefully a 3D Extended Version will be released soon.

Regarding the multiple releases while holding back on the whole package: The studios are becoming so brazen. Offering bare bones Blu Rays shortly before re-releasing the movie with additional footage was a classless act that kicks dirt in the face of fans. I completely understand the business side of the equation. However, I think we would all like to see them release multiple versions and let fans decide how much they need verses how much to spend. At least release a complete package a year or so on. There still isn't an extended 3D version US general release at the time of my update Dec 2014. The first 3D release was just the theatrical edition, even though the extended footage was already available. It's like pulling teeth to get these studios to release everything fans want in a single package, even down the road. After all the releases we have had, they really owe it to fans to do something for us, rather than themselves. We all understand the business side and multiple releases are no surprise. But seriously, this is somewhat an old movie now! Avatar is a particularly egregious example of this practice.

If 3D doesn't interest you regardless, then you are set with the Avatar Special Edition. That is the one I recommend until the 3D Extended Edition comes out. I originally wrote this article as a one star protest review, but there are so many versions of the movie out now and reviews to all of the versions are linked on Amazon to each release so it's better just to explain what to look for. Other worthy reviews cover both the general plot and the content differences between the standard and extended content. I will leave those aspects to them rather than duplicate it.",1465344000,64,2385,4.660332541567696

3927880,2,B002HEXVUI,"""Avatar"" depends on dazzling 3D special effects. I must say this is the best 3D movie set I have seen in years! The set designer did a spectacular job on the planet, forest, creatures and avatars. The movie set is far superior to the worn out old script of greedy big business and military destroying mother earth. By catering to the environmentalists and their template, the writers missed a golden opportunity for an excellent love story with conflict of good vs bad on a one of a kind movie set with spectacular 3D visual and surround sound. I rate this move as a one timer.",1465257600,,577,4.504761904761905

3928032,4,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar was a visually beautiful film. The movie had interesting plots and characters. The costumes and makeup gave the characters a new and believable look. The special effects and computer generated images were state of the art. The acting was fine. The direction of the film was great.
  The one problem with the film was that some of the scenes were repetitive. Another problem with the film was that some of the scenes and the ending was predictable. I would still recommend Avatar to adults and children. I had a good time watching this film. I think that others would enjoy the movie too.",1461024000,,594,4.701923076923077

3928235,5,B002HEXVUI,"That of course is just an opinion much as the totally unwarranted one stars here.
I am still in awe of this movie. The story line, the scenery, the characters, the new life flora and fauna. The creativity and imagination it took to make it happen, so well.
Strangely enough l listened to those who keep a skeptic eye out for everything, namely, 3D in general. Curiosity got the best of me so out of all and any movie l yearned to see in 3D, it had to be Avatar.
Throughout the first viewing my mouth stayed open. How could l ever have considered missing out on such a masterpiece of entertainment? I mean, the 3D puts the whole movie in another dimension. I'll tell you why, for me it's all a matter of embarking right into the movie for my very own adventure and because of the depth of flield in this version l was sucked right in like never before. If enjoying yourself while losing where you are in a magical world, is important to you, well this is it.
Of course leaving the hyper analytical mind outside and looking forward to a great time is all it takes along with turning your childlike mind on full blast. Oh, by the way, if by any stretch of the imagination you think this Disk is too expensive, been to any movie lately (all included)?.
I wanted to keep my positive thinking cap on for this and it paid off big time. This is NOT an expense, it's an investment in great time to be had unless of course, as any bad reviews point out here, there are plenty of negative thinking caps that never seem to come off much.",1455408000,13,1525,4.2620689655172415

3928244,3,B002HEXVUI,"Let's get right to it.  In my opinion, the person who came up with the actual layout for this set should be fired and banned from ever participating in a DVD release again.  They took what should have easily been a 5-star and smashed it down to a generous 3-star rating.

I always like to stress that when I review a DVD, it's for the set -- the extras and the presentation -- and not the movie or show.  I figure people already know if they like a show or not, so I don't worry about reviewing the movie.  I will say that for me, this is more of a 4-star film.  It has some intrigue and elements I like, but it's not in my big time favorites category.

On the surface, this set sounds great.  It's three DVDs that contain the original theatrical release, the special edition release, and the extended cut.  My big issue with this is that instead of having one disk for each version or something similar, they have PART 1 of EACH release on one disk and PART 2 of the movie for EACH release on a second disk.  Who the heck wants to get up and have to change disks?  Who wants to be brought out of the fantasy and feeling of the movie to the real world to change disks and watch the second half?  It's the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen on the DVD release that should have been top caliber if not for this horrendous decision.

Plus, on the second disk, you have to search for the version you want to watch.  Hitting disk menu defaults to the original version.  You  have to go into setup and find the very thin line that says ""film selection"" to choose the appropriate version.  It's just a shoddy way of issuing a DVD.

The packaging is not that user friendly, either.  While the set comes in a really nice, good quality book-like holder, that holder slips into a cardboard cover.  Removing the 'book' with the disks is extremely difficult to do.  I worried a lot about damaging the cover.  The 'book' really is the best thing, with great images and some key lines printed on the pages, but the way the disks fit in the book is also something new to me.  A sleeve that is normal for disk storage is inserted and affixed to inside one of three pages.  It slides out, but not all the way, and you remove the disk from this pulled out sleeve.  The flap for the paper sleeve is a little annoying when it comes to the practical use of taking out and putting in the disk.  It's all a little frustrating.

The second disk has a documentary of sorts called A Message from Pandora that explains a bit about James Cameron's interest in the rain forest and such.  It was fairly interesting and included some of the Avatar cast.

Disk 3 is essentially the bonus disk.  It has a ton of additional scenes from the special edition and extended cut as well as deleted scenes.  They even have a user's guide for the deleted scenes which is really top-notch for explaining what viewers would be seeing in these scenes that were removed from the movie at various points.  Gratefully, there is a play all button for these scenes.  This is roughly 40 minutes or so of footage.  If  you're into the way a movie like this is made, you'll love it.  If you're someone who just likes to know what did not make the cut, you'll love it, too.

There's also a 4-part documentary or 'making of' the movie called Capturing Avatar.  This is very informational and fascinating to watch.  I did not time it exactly, but it's in the 100-minute range.  It's a definite winner as extras go.

Though the extras are quite good and complete in many ways, I cannot give this more than 3 stars because of the inconvenient choice on dividing the movie up into two parts when it's a three disk set.  They should have used four disks or combined the first two versions onto one disk.  Movies in the theaters have not had intermissions in many years.  I did not want one in my home, either!",1455062400,,3852,4.312412831241283
3928245,5,B002HEXVUI,"This film continues to be extraordinary.  Most people are taken by the visual effects; in my opinion the most striking feature is its spirituality.  Everything IS connected, the ""heathens"" knew this, the humans, just like a huge number of people on this planet now, were clueless, cruel, self-centered and materialistic to the core.  Earth is under siege and who knows the outcome.  It was nice to see one planet survive, along with its native people and understanding of nature and all its connections.",1454976000,,503,5.024096385542169

He paints the military in a very DARK way. They are the bad guys, hired by greedy corporations to spoil a peaceful planet. The Colonel is a cartoon caricature of evil military officers. Think ""A few good men"" and ""Apocalypse now"".  At 2 hours and 40 minutes, it's a little long.

I can really identify with the hero of the story and the re-wilding he experienced. Giving it all your heart flying through new heights and after surviving something that could kill you yet really live. Learning to climb mountains and jump from clif to slide down tree limbs, without safety net. It's the kind of amazing experience that can only be expressed as ""ohhh.hh"". It awakens ones wild heart.

Having said that the film, by appealing to 12 to 14 year olds, might transmit some positive values to the coming generation; ie that of preserving what is of value in terms of our beautiful planet.  In the film it is too late to save the earth and, no surprise, the exploiters can't wait to destroy another beautiful planet.  The plot is very thin, but as I said will appeal to the very young.",1452124800,,511,4.121212121212121

miniscule plot, vulgar language including God's name in vain, and sexual content. I was soooooooooo disappointed in this movie. In fact, I got up
and walked out of the theatre after the movie had run two hours, because the main character kept taking God's name in vain. I didn't even stay for the final hour that was left, because it got sooooo bad ! And it's a three hour movie. Not to mention, I had wasted three extra dollars on 3D glasses !

3928383,5,B002HEXVUI,"In Avatar, the villains are the heartless corporations of Earth, controlled by people without concern for the effects of their behavior on others and who do not have the personal depth to look around and be touched by something new and wondrous.  These corporate magnates have been fashioned in the same forge as Satan, in John Miltons Paradise Lost.  Actually, they are more fallen from Grace than Satan, because Satan paused for a moment, and felt for that instant the beauty and wonder of the paradise he then persisted in trying to destroy.  In Avatar, occupying forces just load up their gun ships and go out to collect their unearned cash crop, indifferent to the lives and way of life they thereby obliterate.  I expect that these villains resonate with todays audiences more than would more traditional serial killers and heartless landowners.  After all, many in the audience have lost their own homes and jobs and have watched family members fall sick and perhaps die of easily curable diseases, because corporations have gambled away their savings and withheld simple medical services.

Avatar asks the question, What would happen if we were contacted by a superior race of beings?  However those superior beings don't possess the kind of superior technology that would have allowed them to travel to Earth.  This story is like a retelling of the European invasion of North and South America where technologically superior Europeans mistreated the more spiritually evolved Native Americans whom they found already living here.

Avatar is also about a flying caterpillar, an image that is meaningful to me in a number of ways (see my memoir The Flying Caterpillar, ABQ Press, 2013).  The protagonist of Avatar is a paraplegic marine, paralyzed from the waist down, who gets to fly like a butterfly in the body of an Avatar native.  And he ultimately metamorphoses into a kinder, more conscious being, by entering their kinder, more conscious realm.  The movie succeeds in celebrating his transformationin embodiment and in character--in a way that is true and convincing.  The marine undergoes a kind of reincarnation, first born like an infant into a new body, and then more deeply as he is introduced to a new culture and language that teaches him new perspectives.  Along the way, he is obliged to work through his old karmic stuff before he can benefit from these new opportunities.

(Karma, like Samadhi and Samsara, is a Sanskrit word that has entered Western culture in recent decades.  Karma is the residue left over from our deeds in earlier lives and in this life.  When I first encountered the idea of reincarnation and of our karmic legacy, I immediately found it a helpful concept--not because I accepted the idea of reincarnation but because karma is clearly a force at work in this current lifetime.  We don't have to believe we have other lives, either before or after this one, to recognize that guilty or happy thoughts exert a strong influence right now.)

Some Christians solve the problem of karmic debt, which they call sin, by saying that it is too great for us to do anything about ourselves and that the only remedy available to humanity is to accept that Christ has taken on our otherwise unredeemable sins.  But Christ also said that we should be kind and generous and brave; in other words that we should work through our old Karma in this lifetime while we have the chance.

The main character in this film is a caterpillar in the beginning (because, without his wheel chair, he can only crawl, and because his guiding aspiration is to follow orders and garner the short-sighted rewards that are offered within the chain of command).  One of the things that he is offered is an operation, once he returns stateside, which could reverse his paraplegia, and thereby allow him to walk again.  This is all he needs to hear in order to go forth on this mysterious planet, to infiltrate the local population in a body that looks like that of a native, and to find out where theyve stashed their cash crop.  In this he is very much like most of us, who don't feel that we are in a position to worry too much about the effect of the work we are doing on others or on our planet.  I once spent three years of my working life helping to develop an integrated computer system for a paper company, and I later learned that it was never implemented.  The company paid me, so I didn't care whether the system worked or not.  Nor did I inquire whether the paper company clear-cut one hundred year old trees, thereby destroying the land.
Livelihood, the fifth step in the Noble Eightfold Path (after Vision, Intention, Speech and Action and before the three aspects of Samadhi) meant little to me.  I was satisfied if I had something interesting to do during the day and took home a paycheck that allowed me to do other interesting things for the rest of the time.  The step of Livelihood, which invites us to take a wider view of the affect upon others of what we spend our days doing, was unknown to me.

At the beginning of Avatar, the main character is very much like that.  Yes, Sir, Im your man, he responds without hesitation, when he is told to spy on the native population.  By the end, he has been touched by the people whose lives are about to be destroyed, in large part on the basis of the Intel that his infiltration has provided.  He is transformed into a freedom fighter, standing side-by-side with the native people.  Its the kind of story we love to watch for a few hours, in order to get away from the dreariness of our own lives.  It probably doesnt occur to us to then go home and ask how our own lives are like those depicted in the movie.  Are we living like the native population, wonderfully integrated and respectful of the world into which we have been born?  Are we like the disabled marine, who arrives on a new planet and is willing to destroy a culture he doesnt understand, provided it helps him to walk again?  Or are we like the transformed marine, who gives everything he has to a cause that has touched him?  It is the power of this film that it makes clear how Love, Joy, Compassion, and Harmony only come into our lives when we open our hearts to the world around us.

It strikes me now that the fifth step in the Noble Eightfold PathLivelihoodmay be a part of our lives we tend to ignore.  Outside it may be spring, summer, fall, or winter, but inside our climate controlled offices, the weather is deliberately shut out, along with our awareness that our life is flowing through us, never to return.  Perhaps by becoming more aware of the effect our actions have on the world, we can become the stewards the bible asks us to be, and in the process redeem the value of our individual lives.",1451433600,,6752,4.644238856181666

I was put off by the ugly alien creature in the poster image, but once the aliens showed up in the film, they were quite fun.  There are a few spots where the director allowed gosh-wow CGI to intrude on the story, but mostly the CGI is invisible -- you know it's there because the creatures and world they show simply do not exist on Earth, but what you see is quite realistic within its realm.

The foundation for the plot, with an evilynastygreedy corporation out to wreck a planet to get some ultra-valuable unobtanium resource from a star system light-years from Earth is absurd to the point of being contemptible; however, although it is the driving mechanism for the plot, it's mostly off-screen and so does not distract so much from the story.

3928414,5,B002HEXVUI,"That last thing this movie needs is another review, but I enjoy writing them and I hope my thoughts will be helpful to you, so here goes.

First of all, I have to say that I was neither enthusiastic nor impressed when this movie first came out, but in the time that's elapsed since and the repeated viewings I've had, I've come to like it more and more.

Here's what I like about it:

1) I enjoyed having a Sci-fi film where humans act like humans, for good and ill - the generally aggressive, greedy, combative species we sometimes are, instead of the cowering victims of alien invaders that is the stuff of most other alien-based sic-fi movies out there.  I also like that the better side of humans is also displayed in the characters who seek to understand and learn from the other species.

2) I like having a concrete premise for the film.  In too many films the driving force for an alien presence or an invasion is often a bit too vague for my tastes.  In this case there is an insanely valuable natural resource that humans want and are willing to do pretty much anything to get.

3) I like that the alien species (wait, since humans travelled to the other planet that would make us the aliens and the aliens the natives...whatever) are viewed as much more than just some kind of inconsequential bug or critter that deserves little more than to be viewed through gun sights.  The Navi are in many ways much more human than the humans are.  A nice touch.

4) I enjoyed the bits and pieces of techno-back story that describes the meshing of human and alien DNA in order to produce a hybrid avatar body that a human can experience and control.

5) Character development is powerful on both sides of the conflict.

6) The advanced technology of humans versus the nature-based technology and ecological and world knowledge of the aliens makes for an engaging conflict.

7) Add to this the incredibly well done CGI of an entire world and you've got yourself a winner!

So when I upgraded my home theater with a 3D projector and I wanted this to be the first movie I watched.

Amazing!!  I had intended to just watch the first few minutes, to test it out, and ended up watching the entire movie.  I do not recommend testing this out at 11 pm when you have to be at work early the next morning.  But as I write this, I have no regrets.

Or more appropriately, how can you not root for our own Indigenous Peoples? This flick epitomizes the enigma of our own Western culture.

Make no mistake, this is an excellent, epic adventure with a love story, beautiful film work and effects, that is by definition, a Great American Film.
 I really am having a hard time waiting for the loooonnnnngggg awaited next installment, to see where this goes, and if in the spirit of this offering, what new ideals will it broach. Avatar is in the top ten ( I probably have 15 of them ) of my all time favorite movies. Hopefully the message contained in this hugely successful movie will be recognized, and not lost. The similarities to our own epic are everywhere in this movie, in particular the forests, and trees of Pandora are more similar to our own virgin forests than you might think, and herein lies the enigma, do you feel the same way when Hometree is destroyed, as when you are watching Axemen???

If you have an LG 3D 1080P or 4K TV( Which I don't, I have a Samsung) this movie is going to absolutely knock your socks off. I say that because I find LG's passive 3D looks much better that the active 3D which the Samsung tv's have. Sound ?? What sound, The DTS MA absolutely rocks. Brace yourself for an unforgettable movie experience with Avatar 3D, it is an absolute must purchase if you never saw it in 3D or heard it in Lossless audio.

My oldest saw this as a preschooler in the theater.  She loved it!

I was in my own world, enamored by the incredible world they had put together, paying little attention to the silly aspects. Really, it would have been better as a documentary, like ""look at this incredible world we created and all the details that went into its biological and scientific back story"" but when you throw the generic plot and dumb characters into the mix, it's hard to look past. Even still, it's probably the most incredible world ever imagined, and well worth a watch for anyone who loves nature, biology, or silly children's stories.",1445558400,,734,4.6976744186046515

3928585,2,B002HEXVUI,"Worst movie we've seen in a long time. Since Hugo in fact.

The video transfer is oversaturated. There's nothing like seeing a rehash of the Aliens vs. Titanic vs. Cameron Film X story line with a group of no-name rookie actors in an over-CG'd, poorly digitized film. Then there is that incessant camera shake, presumably to hide the fact everything looks like cheap plastic. Had to take Dramamine just to finish through the middle part of the film. We had to take a long break just to get to the end. Honestly I can't imagine what people are raving about on this film, especially considering Star Trek was produced at the same time and the CG were superior, along with the story and acting.

The packaging and price were nice, however, so we did get a reasonable deal on it.",1443744000,,775,4.5285714285714285
3928586,5,B002HEXVUI,"James Camerons movie Avatar, which took more than a decade to make, creates a movie that delivers such amazing CGI(Computer-Generated Imagery) and special effects like never seen before. The visual details are so well made that even just looking at the screen without knowing the plot, is a treat to the eyes.
 The story is set in the year 2154 on a planet called Pandora  that is rich with minerals and valuable elements. A private corporation is set to invade this world and try to conquer it, removing the Navis from their homeland. I found this to be a good representation of current day political issues, and I think that James Cameron had that in mind as well. The private corporation had big machinery and advanced weaponry, while the Navis had to undertake the challenge of fighting them with just bows and arrows. Pandora is home of the Navi, an 11 foot tall species with blue skin. The Navis have a special connection with their home, one that Grace(Sigourney Weaver)the head scientist, describes as a neurological one.  The humans have created their  own Navis to try and adapt with the culture and ultimately try to persuade them to move to another place without violence.
 This is where Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) comes in. After his identical twin brother dies he gets recruited. Because they have identical genes he can connect to his brothers avatar without making a new one; which would be very expensive. This part especially is liberating to Jake since he is a paraplegic, and the avatar gives him the ability to walk.
 Not only was the CGI and effects spectacular, the story plot was just as good. An example of that is how the characters progress emotionally. The first clip in the movie shows Jake Sully as a somewhat low life guy who picks fights in bars. Jake slowly starts changing his attitude as soon as he knows that his brother died and more importantly after he is introduced to the world of Pandora. We see that he has become more humane and emotionally connected, and less of a military type of rigid person. Of course,  we don't see that immediately but rather throughout the movie.
 Cameron did an awesome job making the avatars look like the actual actors, having I think, a very unique touch of details to them, and their own way of conveying emotions that I have never seen using CGI. James Camerons Avatar changed the whole game of special effects and CGI and probably set a new precedent that other film makers are going to try and achieve.
 My favorite scene in the movie is the final battle. I absolutely love that scene. The combination of dragon-like creatures and Direhorses with Navis riding both  while  battling flying machinery and robots, all give it a sense of outmost epic-ness. James Cameron has definitely set the bar for fictional movies and without a doubt other filmmakers are going to follow his footsteps one way or another. So whether you are  a Star Wars fan or a Lord of the Rings  fan, or just somebody who appreciates a good solid story line with amazing CGI, this is the movie for you.",1443657600,,3050,4.689138576779026

3928630,5,B002HEXVUI,"A beautiful film.  This movie has a plot which is interesting and enjoyable however, it is the incredible effects and artistry which fills your eyes and keeps you watching.  There are  plants that close dramatically after being touched, waterfalls that envelope the screen and main U.S. characters who have avatars, not computerized personas, but an image completely like the natives.  Although these avatars look just like the native folks they take a while to accept them.  The U.S. Army doesn't come out very well, but it is a ruthless officer running that story line. The story takes place in the future and in a land that is interplanetary and only in the writer's imagination.  The main character, a young officer can't walk and uses a wheelchair when he is in his ""normal"" life but when he is with the natives, he can swing from vines, ride a horse, and do things his other self cannot and he is willing to learn the ways of the new people.  On the planet, he meets a young women who is assigned to teach him ""the ropes"" including the new language and the meaning of it.

3928706,1,B002HEXVUI,"1 star NOT for the movie!
Rating is because of the poor decision to split the film over 2 discs!!:(
Not necessary to do with the current state of technology available.  (even tho it is the 'extended' edition)
Had I known the format I would not have gotten this edition...
OH WELL,, guess I'll just pretend I'm at the theatre & watching ""Gone with the wind"",,, intermission included!",1439510400,3,382,4.617647058823529

3928712,5,B002HEXVUI,"Wow is all I can say I simply marvel at the beauty on the screen before my eyes...I found myself awestruck at some scenes! CGI has come so far its quite amazing! James Cameron's Titanic was quite a marvel in it's own right, but this movie just stunning! The characters, environments, plot, it all was so cohesive nothing was out of tune or didn't match you could tell they worked months and perhaps almost even a year on this masterpiece. The extra features gave in depth looks into exactly what one wanted to know about the movie whether it be how they created a scene or voiced the characters. They showed sketches, clay productions of the avatar creatures, built online in programs models of fighter planes...and much much more. Truly this three disc extended collector's edition was the cream of the crop.

Any hint of a plot is non-existent, the CGI is much, much less than advertised - it's still true that no one can create a believable humanoid character on a computer, and the story line is for pre-schoolers.

How can you give this a positive rating without embracing it as proof that human evolution has, indeed, ended.",1438732800,,417,4.546666666666667

3928743,1,B002HEXVUI,I was scammed. I got my 3-disc collectors edition and popped in the first disc. The movie played fine. I watched all the way until Jake mated with the native girl and then it said to continue my journey on disc 2. I thought it was odd because the box said the entire movie was on disc one. So I put in disc two and it only had options to watch deleted scenes and extras. Nothing about continuing the movie to be found. So I took a closer look at the discs and my copy of disc one was part of a two disc set that somehow got put in my collectors edition box. It wasn't even a blu-ray like the other two discs. So yes I am only giving 1 star because I was given half a movie for my purchase.,1437609600,,689,3.859154929577465

3928752,5,B002HEXVUI,"Earth was on the verge of becoming uninhabitable. An exoplanet--one, like Earth, where the conditions are favorable for human life, was discovered. This planet, called Pandora, was within the habitable zone that could support life. Pandora orbited in the ""Goldilocks Zone"" of its Sun-like star, where the temperature is neither too hot nor too cold and water can remain in a liquid form. We, humanoids, were in the process of taking up residence there, but had to determine whether we could co-exist with these inchoate alien beings that occupy this world. These nascent aliens are rather primitive and have a mammalian catlike resemblance with a gaunt mien and a bluish hue to their skin tone. They are bipedal; they stand erect and walk upright on their hind legs. An attempt has been made to integrate into this indigenous civilization by splicing and incorporating their DNA into our own humanoid, creating a cloned hybrid species. The cloned hybrids, over a number of generations, would infiltrate, not for subversive or clandestine purposes, but to seamlessly mesh, not encroach, with them and learn their vernacular, customs, and motivations. Over time, a faction of baleful hardline, martial humanoids become impatient with the slow process of integration, using gargantuan bulldozers to clear the cherished forest for edifice construction or farmland and to supplant or expatriate, these innocuous feline denizens. These ascetic, endemic alien people hold their rain forest and animal kingdom dear and sacrosanct. There was a oneness with these autochthonous alien beings and their environmental surroundings, a nirvana. Better angels among us believe that ""right makes might."" The invading humanoids, through their impudence and haughtiness, turned this notion on its head, chose to think ""might makes right.""",1437350400,3,1819,5.431095406360424

3928777,5,B002HEXVUI,"(THE REVIEW IS FOR THE SPECIAL EDITION WHICH INCLUDES ALL 3 VERSIONS AND EXTRAS)
This is, in my opinion remains the 'Movie-Event' of the 21st century ( so far )
With the three versions on board along with the extras we all craved this is without doubt a great 'Collector's' Item.
The film itself is stunning on the 'Blu-ray' format both the picture quality and sound are spot-on.
the visual content is a spectacle to behold in fact 'CGI' magic on screen.
Join 'Jake Sully' (Sam Worthington) in an adventure of a lifetime as he discovers the marvels of 'Pandora' and
ways of it's people in the spectacle that is 'AVATAR'
Other leading Roles played by 'Zoe Saldana' as 'Neytiri' and 'Sigourney Weaver' as 'Grace'

Many Extra Features on-board.
This film one of the biggest Box-Office successes of all-time.
As was the case with 'Titanic' a 'James Cameron' offering, as is this, we get a series of re-releases, extended versions and as
is the case with both of these great movies - 'A 3D Release' Like many of you, I have bought this one in 3D which enhances
the visual content to it's intended level (also bought the 'Titanic' 3D)
With the second 'Avatar' movie on the cards, we have much to anticipate.

I've already watched it at my buddy's house, so I already knew what to expect. I have a better TV than he does (I have a 60"" LG HD Plasma TV) and I can't wait to watch this on my set.

3928959,5,B002HEXVUI,"AVATAR (2009) is a science fiction movie, directed by James Cameron, is one of the most successful movies in Hollywood history.  In short, a crew of earthlings representing a mining company lands on Pandora, in order to capture and secure land that is a rich source of an ore, called unobtanium.  But to get access to this land, they need to displace a tribe of proud indigenous character who are like eartlings, except they are colored blue, have flat noses resembling the hood design of a 1980 Datsun, and are about twelve feet tall.  Oh yes, they have sparkles on their cheeks.  After first taking a diplomatic approach, which fails,  the earthlings then take a military approach, and ultimately fail. (That's the entire story, in a nutshell.)  Various themes in this story track elements of the long and sad history of the American Indians, for example, impingement by European settlers that result in the displacement of the Native Americans.  Actor Stephen Lang plays one of the main characters, and his portrayal of the commanding officer of the earthlings is absolutely flawless.

(The only thing that I did not like was the unrealistic ending.  How can blue people running through the forest shooting arrows, and flying on the backs of winged lizards triumph over a dozen military helicopters, each the size of a large supermarket, and each very busily shooting thousands of explosive missiles and countless bullets?  However, I doubt if many people gave this a second thought.)

At times, I was wondering if AVATAR was going to drift into the ""white-people-stupid buffoons-Indians-smart-and-handsome"" theme that finds prominence in the cartoon film, SPIRIT: STALLION OF THE CIMARRON (2002).  However, AVATAR never really entered into this territory.  Because of this particular theme, I consider SPIRIT: STALLION OF THE CIMARRON to be a morally objectionable movie.  Actually, AVATAR is more like, the cartoon, FERN GULLY: THE LAST RAINFOREST (1992).  In my opinion, people who fail to realize that New York City and Los Angeles will be underwater, in 100 years, need to pay closer attention to the message in FERN GULLY and in AVATAR, and stop chopping down trees, stop clearing the land, stop building new towns and cities, stop burning oil and gas, and stop making babies.

AVATAR is unusual, in that it makes seamless use of realistic computer generated characters, landscapes, and fanciful creatures, and real human actors and real sets inside of rocket ships.  The blue people appear to be a composite of motion picture images of real human actors, where these action images are processed so they are combined with the flat noses and sparkle cheeks of the blue people.

The landscapes are awesome, and are as impressive as real-life objects in the landscape on earth, such as IGUAZU FALLS in Brazil/Argentina, or as impressive as the lesser known but equally unbelievable MOON HILL located at Yangshuo in southern China's Guangxi.  Some of the creatures resemble dinosaurs, some resemble flying versions of ordinary lizards, and others are like the beautiful jellyfish in FINDING NEMO.  The fanciful creatures include flying lizards that are beautifully colored, with many anatomical features that are weirdly intriguing.  There are also large dinosaur creatures with a head like a hammerhead shark.  On the delicate side, there are many fairy-like creatures that flutter about, evenly spaced from each other.  In one pleasantly intriguing moment in AVATAR, one of the blue people was standing still, and he allowed the fluttery fairies to settle on his shoulders and other parts of his body, remain roosting their en masse for a few seconds, and then spontaneously fly away.

LIST OF EXTREMELY CLEVER THINGS.  AVATAR contains some extremely clever things.  These include:
(1) The fact that the earthlings created a genetic hybrid of human beings and the blue people.
(2) The fact that the blue people and animals in the Pandora world can communicate to each other by way of plug-in hoses.  The plug-in hoses grow naturally from their bodies, and the ends have little tufts or tentacles.  The connection or link occurs at the tufts.
(3) The fact that in order for the genetic hybrids to stay active, a human being with an identical genetic makeup must reside in a special chamber, resembling a high-tech coffin, or perhaps resembling, a machine for computerized tomography (CAT scan).
(4) The fact that the flying lizards, or pterodactyls, or whatever, breath through gills.  The gills are like air vents on the side if a jet plane.  Very inspiring.
(5) Deep in the territory of the blue people, is a series of stone arches, where the stone arches form a row of gigantic hoops.  The stone arches are as large, or perhaps larger, than the famed RAINBOW ARCH, located in Utah.
(6) The mutiny was a clever and unexpected feature in this movie.

INFLUENCES.  Features that are clever and novel are presented to the viewer on a frequent basis, and some of these are listed above.  However, some of the themes and characters in the movies were plainly derived from other sources.  (This is not a criticism, though.)
(1) NATIVE AMERICANS.  The culture of the blue people was clearly derived from American Indians, perhaps the Sioux or Apache (certainly not from the Navajo).  The blue people commune with the earth, and believe that their tree-god is interconnected with every tree on the planet Pandora.
(2) BALINESE MONKEY CHANT.  The blue people do a Balinese monkey chant, which can be seen in the film, BARAKA.  In the Balinese monkey chant, everybody locks arms, does a chant, and sways back and forth, as if one communal human being.
(3) TOUGH LATINA.  In AVATAR, Michell Rodriguez plays a tough Latina who drives a small rocket shuttle.  This was clearly derived (this is not a criticism) from the tough Latina in Aliens 2.  In Aliens 2, the tough Latina who drives a small rocket ship was Jenette Goldstein, who is actually Jewish and not a Latina at all.  But she is very tough. In Aliens 2, one of her co-workers taunts her, saying, ""Has anybody mistaken you for a man?""  Without missing a beat, Jenette Goldstein replies to the male co-worker:  ""Has anybody mistaken you for a woman?""
(4) FLOATING MOUNTAINS.  The floating mountains were derived from Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.  For a great representation of these mountains, I highly recommend the film Gulliver's Travels (1996) starring Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, and directed by Charles Sturridge.",1431216000,2,6488,5.020560747663551

3929046,1,B002HEXVUI,"How many buckets of cheese does it take to get to the moon?.... one, and its called avatar, ... and it's a colossal bucket of cheese, seems like James Cameron teamed up with Disney went on a wild acid trip while channeling the ghost of Dr. Seuss and came up with this concept exploitating the Native American culture and experience and channeling it into a sci fi popcorn action flick....thats it in a nutshell...., sure it looks great, and has a few exhilerating feeling scenes, but you don't even care about the characters risk taking because if the avatar dies he just simply wakes up like a dream or video game, maybe they should have done a psych eval for jake considering his handicap, he may get overly attatched to a body with working legs, oh and ridiculous cardboard cutout characters for the most part are role filler essentially, though Sigourney Weaver is the one redeeming aspect but even she isn't utilized to her full potential, should've had a bigger part, maybe sacrificed herself at the end somehow in a more noble way bringing the conclusion to fruition,i know the aliens fanboys crowd creamed their pants (excuse the expression) at hearing shes in this, she should've been the central character, shes got the presence and the acting chops, not these other clowns, OH and speaking of cheese, UNOBTAINIUM.... PANDORA.... seriously, i pegged this for what it was when i saw the front of the box, why in Gods name do i not trust my instincts and not listen to the plethora of star struck buffoons out there whose statistics and demographics they generate never justify what their majority condones. and that my friends is the moral of the story, trust your insticts and you won't waste so much time and feel frusterated trying to refute in an overlong and bitingly sarcastic critical tone things like this and spend time on more productive things... over and out",1429056000,2,1879,4.766871165644171

3929156,5,B002HEXVUI,"Just for reference, I did not join the rest of the US in watching this film in theaters.  For full disclosure, I was skeptical that 3D would enhance the theater experience and less convinced still that experience could translate to the living room.  Because I was gifted a 3D blu-ray player, I decided to get a 3D TV and some 3D movies; this seemed like the natural first 3D movie to watch on my TV.  I had been mistaken:

I purchased this to watch on my Samsung 50"" 3D TV (F6400); I watched using the TV's included 3D glasses.  The only 3D movie I had seen to that point was ""The Green Hornet"" in theaters (IMAX 3D), and there is no comparison.  The majority of 3D movies have 3D added by computer algorithm ex post facto; Avatar was recorded, at great cost, using 3D cameras.  The result is stunning; where ""The Green Hornet"" used 3D as a gimmick, with perhaps 5 planes of depth, Avatar has a full depth of view.  Anyone who owns a 3D tv is familiar with the ""gimmick"" side, where maybe every 5 minutes something will come in from in front of or behind the TV (at least that's how you see it, of course it's all on the screen).  This side is the potential of 3D which Cameron tried to show us with Avatar, perhaps it will rebound with technology advances, but I have to say that if every medium were produced to the quality of Avatar, 3D would be farther along.  With that being said, don't necessarily shell out just so you can enjoy this movie, but if you have 3D hardware already, this is definitely the #1 movie to have in that collection.  Much like my Xbox One Kinect, 3D has been a poor investment for me; but making the most of that poor investment has been what I've tried to do since.  No other 3D movie that I have purchased is as visually stimulating or incredible as this film.  I want to watch it again as I write about it.  Here I had thought that it was all a gimmick when the film was toppling box office records, but I wish now I'd seen it in IMAX.  Here's to hoping they'll replay it in IMAX near me soon, but for now, it's the best 3D film for 3D hardware, and I'll use it to show off the 3D function of my TV (since I've found 3D really doesn't add much unless they put as much effort/finance into it as Avatar, and noone is in a rush to, currently).",1426464000,10,2273,4.181192660550459

Disc 1 had several instances of one-second freezes before continuing.  Disc 2 was even more problematic, with major freezing on chapter 6, resulting in several minutes of lost footage before the movie played correctly on chapter 7.  Unfortunately, by the time I watched these DVDs it was well past the 30 day return policy date so it doesn't look like I can get a refund or an exchange.  In the end, I was able to watch and enjoy 99% of the movie so it's not a huge deal.

It shows off the 3-D in a way that really enhances the imagery of another planet, without becoming gimmicky, exaggerated.

If you can watch it on a good 3D TV even better!!
I've watched thousands of movies over 66 years but none of them gave me vertigo, an honorable and interesting story line, and CGI that kept me engaged from start to finish. All i can say is ""wow!"".
I've seen this movie at the theater in passive 3D twice. on a good (passive) 3D TV twice, at both 720p and 1080p playing a standard BLU-RAy DVD, and lastly on a 70"" UHD 4K TV using Samsung and Vizio upscaling. All are equally viable formats and the movie continues to be enthralling no matter how it is watched.
Just a great movie no matter how you 'look' at it.

3929261,5,B002HEXVUI,"I'm a bit late to the 3D party.  I hadn't realized players had become so affordable, so only just recently bought one.  And of course I knew my very first disc had to be Avatar.

I saw it in 3D in IMAX and was absolutely blown away.  I've never forgotten it, that's how deeply impressed I was.  I never dreamed I could replicate it in my own home.  Rest assured, this disc delivers.

I thought I'd write this review for anyone else inexperienced in home 3D, because at first it wasn't so great.  The first 30 minutes looked pretty awful actually, but I was loathe to admit I might have made a mistake (I have several more movies still en route, so I've invested a bit already, despite my promise to myself to start slowly and make sure it was worth it).  At first the 3D was nauseating.  Everything was too bright, too busy.  There seemed to be too many layers and my brain couldn't handle it.  There was a lot of ghosting and everything looked transparent around the edges.  I was pretty disappointed.

I feared it might be my glasses, which are certainly the cheapest I could find that would work with my TV (I have a slightly more mid range pair on the way).  But I finally paused it and dug into the TV's settings.  I have a Samsung LED TV, so your situation might be different, but I was pleased to find a very extensive 3D menu with many tweaking options.  What helped the most was something that switched L/R, whatever that means, but that instantly fixed almost everything.  The picture settled into something much more coherent.  The ghosting was gone and suddenly everything looked sharp and clear, and truly 3D.  I had the depth of picture that I loved in the theater, the colors were deeply saturated.  It looked simply breathtaking.  It was everything I was hoping for.

I certainly hope I don't need to do this separately for every movie, we'll see.  I'm just thrilled beyond words to finally have this experience at home for this movie, which is just gorgeous.  Do not hesitate to buy this if you loved the 3D in the theater.",1424563200,,2040,4.448648648648649

3929292,5,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron never fails to deliver. The story line is simplistic and one of the most common; boy meets girl, loses girl, wins girl back. It's tacked on to the redeemed white soldier fighting for the indians against oppressive greed trope. So what. They still write Vampire novels.

Cameron not only has created a spectacular world filled with (largely stolen from deep ocean) fascinating flora, the animals make sense, the planetary configuration makes sense, the science works as well as the sci-fi, and the icing on the cake is that all the 3D is used for to give incredible depth and scope to the breathtaking vistas.

I saw the film in IMAX 3D five times in one month, not just because it was good; but good enough I kept telling people ""You have to see this in IMAX 3D!"" and when they invited me to go along I said ""Sure!""

It loses very little in translation to the small screen, even not in 3D, and the restored footage gives you some nice background, as well as filling a couple narrative holes that bugged me in the theatrical release.

It may not be ""Lawrence of Arabia"", or ""Gone With the Wind""...... but this is an excellent film.",1424131200,2,1144,4.538834951456311

3929300,1,B002HEXVUI,"Ah this movie had such beautiful graphics, but the story was too much for me to stand.  First off the story is horribly stupid.  NEVER EVER would a civilization from before the industrial age ever be able to defeat a space faring civilization.  That is just flat out stupid, stupid, stupid!  Next is the idea that an animal would develop an appendage that allowed it to be controlled by another.  A horse can be tamed, and taught, but a horse isn't going to create a magical butt-tail-controller.  Seriously???  The aliens had a tail that pops out of their rears!!!  For peat sake, evolutionary speaking no species will grow an appendage to where it can be taken over and controlled.  Next is the idea of the floating mountains.  This is a very nice fanciful thought, but the huge problem is that in order for those mountains to stay more or less at the same altitude they would need to replace all that water that is floating off of them.  This doesn't take into consideration that they would constantly be crashing into each other changing their mass which would further cause them to change altitude.  Then of course is the problem of the animals being bullet proof.  For peat freaking sake no animal can with stand a bullet, not even funky dinosaurs on a weird planet.  For starters bullets can punch through metal, and I am certain that any animal skin or plate is not harder than metal.  All of those creatures charging the machine guns would have been turned to pulp.  Like I said this movie has pretty graphics, but other than that it is horrible.  I couldn't watch all of it, it was just too much to stand.",1423958400,5,1615,4.552083333333333

The three versions of the movie are broken up at the mid-point. I have to go to the second DVD to view the rest of the story. Talk about filmus interruptus! I've watched this film at least twenty times and never get tired of it.

3929353,3,B002HEXVUI,"Sure this had a massive budget and a very textured script to film off of. But it was just one big long special effects ride.

The characters were interesting and well played. The action sequences were amazing if not for the great special effects. Even then this movie failed to have that resounding magic that would make this movie enduring for many more years to come.

It lacked any connection for me personally because it spent so much time trying to push the idea or philosophy of coexistence and the perils of over exploring our natural resources or we ourselves will drive our own race into extinction. Just a lot of hippy mumbo jumbo crap I didn't need preached to me in the movie.

Only 16 minutes were added to the Extended Collector's Edition of Avatar.  HOWEVER, the scenes they did add (and all the bonus features) add so much to the story and the world of Pandora that, in my opinion, this edition is still a must have for Avatar fans.  I have the Original Theatric edition already (the first edition released) but still thought it was worth it to buy this edition as well (which contains three versions, each adding more content than the previous versions).  I feel like I understand Avatar so much more with this edition than I did with the original edition, so overall I highly recommend it for fans.

3929390,5,B002HEXVUI,"This review is for the 3 disc Blu-Ray version that has the theatrical version, re-release version, and extended version.
I mention this first because there have been several Avatar releases (DVD, 3D, Blu-Ray, extended, collections, etc. etc.) As you read all the reviews here, do notice that ALL the variations are included, and so you need to be sure you are reading the one that pertains the the one you're considering purchasing. This is not a review of the movie, but specifically of this Blu-Ray version.

I don't expect to get a 3D TV, but as a both a fan of this movie and someone interested about the art and craft involved in film making I thought it was worth waiting for this version.
And boy, howdy, was it!

The transfers are beautiful and (while much of the extras are ""fluff"") there's more than enough great extras to be well worth it. Certainly the $25 I paid at the beginning of 2015. I especially recommend the ""Message from Pandora"" which documents Cameron's journeys to the Amazon jungle (one with some of the main cast members) to help publicize the dams being planned that will displace thousands of people. If one of the reasons you love this movie is because of Cameron's well-known deep involvement and knowledge of technology's collision with our planet, you will find this really informative.
If you think he's just another tree-hugging liberal spewing ecological propaganda with this movie....well, you probably aren't interested in the movie (or this feature) anyway.",1421625600,4,1496,4.909090909090909

On disc #2 the scratches were so bad that it hung in 3 spots and skipped parts of the movie. All DVDs had scratches and smudges. Some worse than others. The box was scuffed up too, even though it was sealed in plastic film. So I returned the first set for a replacement hoping to get a set without scratches on the DVDs.

Two weeks later, as they had an issue finding a replacement as the DVD was sold out, I got the replacement and it had the same issue. They were different DVDs in the set (they did not ship me the exact same set I sent back) but it also had scratches in different places and more HANGING and Skipping when you attempted to play them. The box also had the corner crushed and edges scuffed even though it was seamed in plastic film. So I returned the set this time for a refund.

Nothing like buying a collectors set and having it be something you can not watch or be proud of collecting! This is not Amazons fault it is the fault of the original manufacturer for putting them in 3 cardboard sleeves that rub on bottom of the DVDs. The normal plastic boxes that are usually used would have protected it better as they clip in and do not slide around an usually have some air space between the DVD and the back of the container. This ships in a ""book"" with 3 cardboard sleeves to save space, but it rubs and scratches DVDs.

The movie itself is great. The special collectors edition extended cuts at the beginning are good too. But not being able to watch the whole movie in one sitting because you have to change the DVD to the 2nd DVD for the second half of the movie is not optimal and because of the scratches it hangs and skips which was very disappointing.

Amazons return policy is great and being a  PRIME customer and a prime purchase all the shipping, both ways, twice was covered.

I will have to find a copy that uses plastic holders next time.

Simply a global-warming-is-going-to-get-you shout fest dressed up as a sci-fi thrill(less)er with no redeeming value whatever. The acting was sub-par, the story was ludicrous, the action sequences were rather cartoon-ish, and the entire movie was an exercise in look-at-where-we-are-with-special-effects-now. Was there one instance, one single frame not shot in front of a green screen?? The only reason this film sits atop the box office is because of the price of 3D tickets. Period.

3929494,1,B002HEXVUI,"From the beginning this movie was shrouded in mystery and heralded as a landmark achievement in special effects. This was before the movie was even released. It was hyped to no end and it worked, everyone and their mothers saw the movie. Then we got to see what the movie was really all about. Turns out it's the same preachy story we've seen time and time again. Make no mistake about it, this is Hollywood trying to push their message into the faces of the masses as if we're a bunch of 12 year olds that won't catch on to what we're being sold.

Beyond that, the movie has zero substance. The characters are stereotypes and not only that but they are boring. The in your face CGI is laughable to me. I never once looked at the blue aliens and thought that they were actually on the screen. Why not use practical effects? Maybe I'm too old school but I feel like this is not a movie for anyone over the age of 12. It really does feel like a kids movie that has this hidden message that's not really hidden at all. The movie needs a better script with some substance and some decent believable effects and then you can tell me it's the next big entertainment experience. It's not, it's just another preachy movie with an expensive budget.",1419984000,7,1239,4.363636363636363

3929515,5,B002HEXVUI,"This is one of my favorite movies.  It is long, so be sure that you have time to set down and watch it.  I bought the digital HD version.  i had not seen it in HD yet, but I loved the effects.  This is a very futuristic, sci-fi movie.  As I watched it we discussed how it was similar to different movies...Pocahontas because of the John Smith/princess part, Native Americans because of their ties to their world, etc...
There were no cuss words, and a few romantic touching scenes.
*Spoiler*
The basic story is about a paralyzed marine who is tasked to find out what a species on another planet will take to give up there homes.  This is a very futuristic, sci-fi kinda movie.  The marine is promised an expensive surgery that will allow him to walk again for immersing himself in the ingenious population and gathering intel.  Scientist have figured out how to have him and others transport their minds into Avatars (or created alien bodies).  They hope to fit into the society but have failed.  Along comes the marine in his Avatar and impressed the society because he is a warrior, the leader tasks his daughter with teaching Sully who they are and how to be one of their warriors.

They live as one, in this creative, illuminating and colorful world from another time and planet. But, a scientist who has made contact and knows these giant people, suddenly dies... and his twin brother, whose lost the use of his legs, is needed to replace him because his genetics (DNA), are the same. But, he knows nothing of the scientific data that his late brother, did. A fascinating trip into the unknown and unconquered 'Land of Pandora', through the capsule of the mind. A fantasy feature with a lot of twists and turns, complete with action, drama, adventure and unexpected love, that endures throughout, all. The sights and sounds are brilliant and breathtaking to behold. But, a choice has to be made: Love and legs in the new World of Pandora, or duty and living in the present and in one's own time, with mechanical legs and the 'hope' of finding love, is the decision only he can make.

3929665,5,B002HEXVUI,"I watched this in the movie theater (3D) and loved it- just loved it!  Then, when we bought a 3D plasma TV, Avatar was at the very top of our list!
Read any review to learn about the breath-taking scenes of nature, color, popping 3D (great movie for those who don't have 3D, too!).  To be honest, there are some political undertones: the gist is that the big, bad government comes in to mine the area, including the ancestor tree...and these beings are one with nature...think USA and Native peoples...there is even a ""mission accomplished"" comment when one of the big-bad's took out some of these beings (human-like creatures).  I did see an older couple stomp out of the theater when that happened.

The title, Avatar, is based on the main character- a paraplegic man who gets to wear an avatar because it was made for his brother who is out of the picture.  So it is a dream come true (they lie in what look like tanning beds and ""mind blend"" with their human-oid costumes to blend with the native beings on this planet) because the man can run/walk, is finally free.  But as a quirky mistake, he is accepted into the tribe of beings.  He reports back to the scientists (the well-meaning ones that want to learn the culture) as well as the commandos, and along the way he becomes one of the beings...only to realize his intel is used to trigger ways to get rid of them or relocate them.

The story, from there, is not new, but the journey is novel, right down to the creatures, plants and animals, and customs of these beings.  Just an incredible movie!",1415318400,2,1556,4.48936170212766

I thought it was silly how everyone was so about this movie and the graphics. That being said, 5 mins of screen time when it was on HBO made me curious. I wanted to know why, what I was seeing, was happening. Sure enough I watched it, made my family watch it, made my friends watch it, and eventually bought my own copy. This movie was such an experience. The graphics are outstanding, the characters I feel were perfectly cast, but what sold me was the story. It really draws you in and stirs emotion, it really works the gambit of feelings throughout the whole movie. From desperation, to hope, from  fear to adventurous, and from complete desolation to uplifting joy of unity. For me a movie that really makes you feel and experience the emotions that are being portrayed or a moment in ones life. That's what makes a great movie. ^_^",1413244800,2,939,4.427745664739884

Outlandishly overpraised on its release for its ""creativity"" and ""imagination,"" Avatar is in some ways the worst kind of sci-fi: a hack, generic story dressed up in sci-fi drag. Everything about Pandora -- the flora, the fauna, the blue humanoids -- is a very-not-imaginative variation on Earth. Everything about the plot came out of Westerns, with a bleeding-heart 21st-century spin. Cameron spent all those years and all those gazillions of dollars on the whiz-bang tech, but clearly expended very little thought or energy on this bland story. It does look fine, and the tech is very high. But oy, the writing.",1413158400,,623,5.058252427184466
3929744,3,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is yet another cinematic masterpiece directed by the renowned James Cameron. The story depicts a handicapped marine, Jake Sully, who is sent on a mission to the fictitious planet of Pandora. While there, Sully is faced with the decision of protecting Pandora or following orders from back home. Packed with action, drama, and romance, Avatar smashed the box office by raking in over $760 million in 2009. Personally, I wonder why this movie remains at the top of the IMDb list for the all time grossing movies. I will admit, the special effects in this movie were outstanding. I felt as though I were experiencing Pandora first hand. However, outside of the effects, the story line seemed subpar. To me, it seems like the cliche ""good vs. evil"" morality tale that has been overdone throughout Hollywood. Also, the movie is excruciatingly long. After the first hour and a half in the theater, I was ready for Cameron to pick it up and start to draw conclusions. Instead, I had essentially another hour and a half to go until the movie was over. All in all, I feel this movie was not worth all the hype. Now don't get me wrong, I didn't feel like I wasted $9.25 after seeing this film. The effects were outstanding, like I previously mentioned. I just feel Avatar was by no means the best film I've ever seen.",1413158400,,1314,4.619658119658119

I purchased the 3D BR Combo pack and we viewed the 3D disc on our new Samsung 60 7100 (also purchased via Amazon).  It exceeded our expectations. As with the theatrical release, you are totally immersed into the production.
There is one outstanding issue with the rolling credits (if you are into this): Every  5 seconds or so, I was prompted to turn on the 3D glasses (never turned them off).  No joy. I even clicked the Sammy remote to display in 2D: No joy.  My guess is this was due to how the rolling credits were not mastered correctly to 3D.  This issue is repeatable.

Would give the movie four and a half stars instead of five if I could because the story line is a bit ridiculous and unrealistic regarding the attitude and personal biases of the main military officer whose actions are based on a bigoted mindset and not in line with a true professional military high ranking officer... but it is a movie after all and that was the intended plot.

Just goes to show how a stupid attitude in life based on uneducated conditioning and greed of the corporation can cause misery for those who don't deserve the onslaught of a destructive attitude based on selfishness.",1412208000,,618,4.669724770642202

3929810,5,B002HEXVUI,"Where James Cameron gets the inspiration and the ability to dream up and create something like this or Abyss, makes me speechless. The colors, technical innovation and directing skill that took this from his mind onto a 3D space probably shows off the power of 3D for an immersive experience unlike anything else. It also wrings out the electronics needed to play this fast moving, 3D epic. Having the 3 disk set and the 3D version, it did leave off a scene or two but this thing blows you out of your socks in comparison to the 2D version. Even if you've got the 2D, get this and watch it again. It's a whole new movie.",1411257600,,620,4.353448275862069

If you have not seen this movie - prepare to be amazed.  The story line is the usual conquest fare, but the location, the culture differences, it is just so amazing.  The writers, all staff and actors should be proud of this piece of Cinematography.  Get the pop corn ready NOW - Before the movie starts - because you won't have time once it starts.

3929946,5,B002HEXVUI,"I saw the theatrical version of this movie only recently, and was enthralled with it.  Recently I purchased the three-disc extended collector's edition because it was available locally and I was in the market.

One reviewer condemned Cameron as having ""no technical imagination"".  I would think, in that case, the movie wouldn't have been made at all.  In fact, the product itself is a visual delight because he had the foresight to find collaborators who would allow his vision to come to life.  It's a beautiful movie, and the extra documentary provided with the collector's edition provides insight to its execution.  I wouldn't have missed this one for the world.",1408752000,,667,5.0181818181818185

3929954,3,B002HEXVUI,"I was honestly very disappointed by Avatar, and this reaction is despite my enjoyment of the homage to Philip Jose Farmer and some other very well-executed scifi flourishes. My problem is that, as a social commentary, Avatar One was entirely misguided. I am a huge James Cameron fan, but he is at his best when telling stories, which he does quite well. So blowing up ""evil"" corporations is the way to save the world? How about looking at how it really is? These days, miners spend decades working out agreements with indigenous peoples, providing job training, repairing environmental damage, etc. Avatar is about 100 years out of date in its social commentary. In my own view of the long-term future, we will have unlimited fusion power, and raw materials will be derived primarily, perhaps entirely, through robotic recycling. So maybe we will leave the era of mining the earth entirely behind us (maybe we'll mine asteroids instead - space travel looks different when energy is virtually free). But Mr. Cameron is not telling us ANYTHING about what could make it better in future. He has no real technological imagination, and Avatar spells that out in spades. There are many brilliant failures in science fiction, and unfortunately, Avatar is yet another of them.",1408665600,,1268,4.985849056603773

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: With James Camerons AVATAR it has turned one mans dream of the films, into a trippy joy ride about the end of life, but our film going life included. Several decades in the dreaming and more than four years in the actual making, the film is a swan song to the natural world that was largely produced with software, an exploration of the invisible world of the spirit filled with a James Cameron rock em, sock em action. Created to conquer hearts, minds, history books and box-office records, the film, one of the most expensive in history, the jungle drums thump and are is a glorious adventure and blissfully deranged.

The story behind the story, including a production budget estimated to top $230 million, and James Camerons future-shock ambitions for the medium have already begun to settle into myth (a process partly driven by the publicity, certainly). Every filmmaker is something of a visionary, just by virtue of the medium. But James Cameron, who directed the mega melodrama Titanic and, more notably, several of the most influential science-fiction films of the past few decades The Terminator, Aliens and The Abyss, is a filmmaker whose ambitions transcend a single movie or mere stories to embrace cinema as an art, as a social experience and a shamanistic ritual, one still capable of producing the big WOW effect.

The scale of the film, which brings you into a meticulous and brilliantly coloured alien world for a fast 2 hours 46 minutes, factors into that wow factor again. Its scope is evident in an early scene on a spaceship and the year is 2154, where the passengers, including a paraplegic ex-Marine, Jake [Sam Worthington] a gruffly sensitive heartthrob, are being roused from a yearlong sleep before landing on a distant inhabited moon, Pandora. Jake is woken by an attendant floating in zero gravity, one of many such aides. As Jake himself glides through the bright cavernous space, you know you're not in Kansas anymore, as someone soon quips (a nod to The Wizard of Oz, James Camerons favourite film).

It doesnt take Jake long to feel the good vibes. Jake is himself an avatar because hes both a special being and an embodiment of an idea, namely that of the heros journey. What initially makes Jake unusual is that he has been tapped to inhabit a part-alien, part-human body that he controls, like a puppeteer, from its head to its prehensile tail. Like the rest of the human visitors whove made camp on Pandora, he has signed on with a corporation thats intent on extracting a valuable if mysterious substance from the moon called unobtainium, a great whatsit that is an emblem of humanitys greed and folly. With his avatar, Jake will look just like one of the natives, the Navi, a new identity that gives the film its plot turns and politics. But, standing in their way is an inhospitable atmosphere and a very formidable race of native people called the Na'vi, who just happens to live on top of the riches deposit of this entire prized mineral.

In order to infiltrate the natives, various humans are enlisted to be ""drivers"" of artificially grown avatars that have been created in a lab by blending human DNA, with Na'vi DNA to form a hybrid. To complete the process, human inhabitants are put into a pod like device where they are able to project their consciousness into the Na'vi avatar body, and thus, essentially, become one of them. This is where Mr. Cameron really weaves his movie magic as the Na'vi actors are brought to life on screen by a combination of CGI animation and human actors to form the electrifying, 12-foot, blue-toned humanoids, which are for the most part, fairly realistic looking.

There are also a lot of strange and wonderful creatures that are quite visually spellbinding, as is the Pandorian landscape and ecology that comes alive with floating mountains, glowing plants and ferocious animals. Perhaps the most compelling aspect of AVATAR to me, was not the eye-popping visual effects, but rather the very reverent and sympathetic focus on the spirituality of the native Na'vi's. They are for the most part, a peaceful species, yet, at the same time, they are fierce warriors. They have a deeply spiritual and symbiotic relationship with the forest they live in and the nature of their native planet Pandora.

They also possess profound wisdom that all life is connected as one and that they are a part of that connection, too. This aspect of the Na'vi people is reinforced throughout the film, again and again, as they are shown bonding with the trees, the plants, the animals and the forest. Even if they have to defend themselves from a predatory animal, they say a prayer after they have killed it. This reverent and respectful homage to the spiritual nature of indigenous extra-terrestrials is, ultimately, the most interesting and surprising element of AVATAR by far. But, all in all, for nearly three hours of screen time, AVATAR is a highly entertaining extravaganza that looks even more spectacular in the 3D visual mode. This is one absolutely beautiful film! It sets new heights for special effects, cinematography, and artistic set design.

Regarding the technology used for shooting AVATAR was filmed in StereoScopic 3D, the Fusion Camera System was used. Having been developed by Vince Pace and James Cameron, their Fusion 3D HD system involves the use of two customised cameras, and reportedly James Cameron used a specifically designed system all on its own just for AVATAR. According to an article in Popular Mechanics, this camera's viewfinder also offered the filmmaker the opportunity to watch the live actors as they are integrated by the system in a provided CGI environment, as it senses its position on a motion-capture stage.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The video quality on this release is in the full 1080p awesome encoded image in the 1.78:1 aspect ratio. It is very much worth noting that this video presentation has been THX Certified. It's obvious, as noted that the ""3D Quality"" was shot in true StereosSopic 3D on a very advanced camera system. That translates into this having one amazing visual presentation either in 3D or 2D. James Cameron has mentioned in press conferences that this choice was made as to offer more visual depth in long and open shots, and more of the ""claustrophobic"" effect in close-ups. Another thought to ponder regarding the film having been filmed in StereoScopic 3D, even when you pause the film, you do see not only what could otherwise be considered motion blur, but the slight dual-focus you may expect from a 3D presentation. Not to be left unmentioned is the equally valuable work of those from the Stan Winston Studios who provided many of the physical on-screen character effects. The amount of ""3D pop"" in 2D is excellent and you get a really great sense of depth and such even in the 2D presentation of the film. The 2D version of the film certainly has a few pros to viewing the film in 3D, with the availability to see so much of the detail, the beautiful saturation, and a solid black level. With no disrespect to the audio presentation, you will perhaps find yourself more taken up with this phenomenal video quality so much that the audio track may be only background elements to you upon your first viewing. It should really come as no surprise, this once again earns itself a perfect ""5 Star Rating"" for overall video quality and is still the utter definition of ""reference quality"" in terms of Hi-Definition visuals. In either 3D or 2D, you'll be amazed by the video quality found on this release.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The audio quality on this release is presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. First, note that just like the video presentation, this audio presentation too has been THX Certified. As this audio track simulates the fictional world of Pandora, the 5.1 setup offers an amazing audible performance that is well representing of the story's sci-fi and ethereal nature, making it nearly impossible to decide on where to start in describing this presentation. One of the first things that will surely charm your ears is the original music composed by James Horner, perfectly conveying the tones of both worlds; the humans' camp with a more hearty and war-like brass sound, and the natural world of the Na'vi, translating a more tribal and passive sound. Composer James Horner was also responsible for the original music on the films Apocalypto, Troy, Titanic, Apollo 13 and Braveheart to name just a few. In the scene involving Jake`s avatar being captured by the tribe, the background chatter of the surrounding Na'vi people fills the soundscape, providing 360 degrees of voices that simulate the feeling of truly standing within the action. This for instance is a great example of the superb usage of all the channels in the 5.1 setup, however, when it comes to this release, generally it is not even necessary to pinpoint a specific scene, as one could basically scan through the film on Blu-ray and be impressed. All general sound effects are impressive, offering multiple channel usage, panning at times, and simply a general clarity of sound. You've really got to hand it to those behind the efforts in the sound department here in having created the sounds of imaginative fictional creatures, sci-fi machinery of multiple sorts, and even a setting that, though merely portraying the paradise-like world of Pandora, is itself absolutely glowing with subtle sound. The dialogue is presented perfectly on this release, as both the live-action organic recordings from the live actors on set, and the presumably voiced-over dialogue of the Na'vi characters. Overall this is once again just downright impressive, almost as much as the visuals in terms of sound mix and very much worthy of deeming ""demo material"" in terms of audio as well. AVATAR in its much anticipated retail release to Blu-ray 3D earns a perfect ""5 Star Rating"" for audio quality just as the film scored in the debut release and re-release both of which were 2D. I'm happy to report that much, I really am, and I think the fans will once again be very, very pleased with this awesome stunning audio presentation.

Finally, it remains to be seen whether a title of even this astronomically high profile can push 3D hardware sales so long after its general release and after the initial hype behind 3D TV have said things have died down a bit, but I disagree, as I love any 3D Blu-ray discs. While AVATAR remains a big favourite of mine, and maybe Blu-ray fans have perhaps moved on to fresher releases like The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises and may see this AVATAR release as another money grab on the way to the so called up and coming ""Ultimate Version"" and we really mean it this time! No really, this is the one to buy! It really boils down to this: AVATAR fans now have the 3D version to watch that doesn't cost an arm and a leg to acquire, and folks who already have the Panasonic branded release don't need to buy again, unless a new artwork and the slipcover is brought out. Who knows what future editions will hold, other than that there will be future editions and that there probably will be new material in them. As it is, this is currently the best way to watch AVATAR in 3D in the home and the price doesn't really hurt. Certainly one can see why AVATAR is an important and destined-to-be prominent film through the rest of the history of the medium not only as a clear-cut fan-favourite but also as a hallmark visual effects movie that will be remembered alongside the likes of Star Wars, The Last Starfighter, Jurassic Park, the Lord of the Rings trilogy and Toy Story. Overall the bonus material here is a huge disappointment but let's face it, you've most likely bought the ""Extended Collector's Edition"" Blu-ray Disc set that actually contains bonus materials. That release also contained two other cuts of the film; whereas this only contains the original 162 minute theatrical cut. Sometime soon maybe we'll see a fourth and final release in both 3D and 2D that contains those other two cuts of the film and bonus materials but for now if you want to see those you'll just have to go back to or consider purchasing the ""Extended Collector's Edition"" 3-disc set on Blu-ray. I saw AVATAR in the cinema in 3D and was sort of impressed, but now seeing it in this amazing 3D Blu-ray awesome disc, it looks even more superior and I am glad I waited for this 3D Blu-ray version to be released and I have been more than impressed and now it is a great honour to now having this added to my ever expanding 3D Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!

It's a good movie, but doesn't deserve to be #1 by a very long shot. DVD is anamorphic 1.78.1, which is how they ALL should be since I paid to see ALL my TV screen, not just Half. It's a good movie, but we all overreacted.",1403308800,3,410,3.7674418604651163

3930171,2,B002HEXVUI,"so is this because dna determines fine details/characteristics of brain waves so a dna match would make one nsync?  But the navi as natives of their planet have no problem bonding with other life forms (truly bizarre active hair strands)?

I'm going to say that good science would not require a dna match to get things going in terms of telepathy but having a control subject like with twin experiments might have helped early research.

I kind of hate this movie because I don't like the panther faces and the two sides seem to switch meanings/messages so I am not sure if I am watching this artificial reality of lies by an inferior tribe making excuse for itself because I don't think the American government and military are as toxicly motivated as the military for corporate interests are in this film and even then, the military is not depicted as unlikable which really makes it hard to believe that members would go rogue and have no problem making widow(er)s and orphans of the families of (until recently) comrades in arms.

I find the visuals pretty unattractive like Alice: The Madness Returns and the non-Dwarf parts of World of Warcraft.

Aesthetically, this movie was a complete turn off in the Pandora forests and and why is it called Pandora?  What evil is hidden in its closed box?

And no way would a rainforest tribe or a Namibian nomad choose their current dire straits over an opportunity to join the world of indoor plumbing and college education.

Once again Sam Worthington plays a hybrid as he does in Terminator 4 who chooses one side over another.  I can't forget his shocking last words to Helena Bonham Carter's character in Terminator 4 which colors my assesment of this whole Hawaii for Hawaiians, Northwest Territory for Inuits. Turkmenistan for Exiled to Austria activists and Free Tibet, etc. theme that runs through Avatar.

The British Empire never really went native and I think that's less sneaky, predatory and disrespectful than roaming with the Namibian nomads and claiming that cooking an egg on hot ash is tasty  or breeding a ""White Masai,"" you know?

I gagged when Zoe Saldana's character claimed that they didn't cause unnecessary death but their arrows are by default tipped with a neurotoxin.

Plus Stephen Lang has rocked since Last Exit to Brooklyn and when his character says that he did three tours in Nigeria (where a lot of African Americans hail from) without incident but he got his face raked on his first day on Pandora ... ferocious animals have ugly faces like sharks and the dark oily hyena like creatures in this film and there are  a lot of Jurassic era looking animals here and that's not good in terms of the bloodthirstiness of animals.  If wild boars in Hong Kong RUN from humans, then you know humans have had a tamping down effect on them and that is something that the Navi seem to have failed to do.  There were no panda bears in this movie.",1402704000,2,2913,4.715976331360947

And the problem with 3D is that if you don't catch it within the week or two that it's in the multiplex, then it's gone forever unless you have a good 3D set.  There aren't that many great 3D movies but there are enough to justify owning a set.  And even if there were only one, it's worth it to be able to see it again.",1402531200,,446,3.763440860215054

All you need to know is that there are evil, stereotypical corporate and military humans who want the stuff (unobtainum is the name . . . seriously) the blue guys have and are willing to do anything to get it.  There now you can safely just watch just the blue men parts of the movie and still thouroughly understand the plot and have an extra hour after your done watching with which you can go for a walk, enjoy your family, recycle, purge your house of gluten before it destroys all you know and love, whatever your heart desires.",1402531200,2,731,4.27536231884058

I have seen this movie many times and enjoyed it more each time. It does follow the plot of a outsider of a area be against the natives of a land and then turns against his own kind to help them, but each movie follows one of the few basic plot structures so what can you say about anything being original. They story I found much better than Star Wars I-VI.

The effects were great and at times the CGI seemed like it was real. They did a good job of establishing the world, culture, and purpose of each group that you did not have to think back on what that character wanted.",1399161600,,833,4.135802469135802

3930232,5,B002HEXVUI,"Just saw this a week ago (late, i know...). I now understand all the hype...movie is beautiful in visuals and the storyline was not what i expected. This movie has some element of innocence that makes it enjoyable.",1399161600,,214,4.657894736842105
3930233,5,B002HEXVUI,"This movie is great to the extent of reflecting what are are doing to earth. Have we as humans lost our respect for earth and the natural resources that sustain us? Has greed taken hold that we will move anything out of the way to get our slice of the cheddar? I for one am concerned for the future, unless we do something. The thing is, if we do something, can we do it in a non-violent way, and ensure the future of our stability?",1399161600,,432,4.094117647058823
3930234,5,B002HEXVUI,"The attention to detail is amazing. It all looks so real. The nuances in their behaviors and gestures make it all so real. Watching with a 3D project on a 10' wide screen, it seems like you are looking through a giant window and that you could step into it. Like a portal into another universe.",1399161600,2,294,4.267857142857143

3930237,5,B002HEXVUI,"3D is awesome, the movie feels so much more immersive than when I watched it in the theaters. A friend watched with me who had seen the 3D version in the theaters and felt like this had more pop to it. We watched it on a Vizio 50"" screen with passive 3D. It was played on a Playstation 3 system. I'm pretty sure different TVs and different 3D Blu-ray players may possibly have different results.",1398816000,,395,4.28

Everything about the film is great: the picture quality, the 3D effects, the background music choices, the plot itself, and originality. So often today, Hollywood is re-working a movie that's been done. I mean, seriously, how many times can you remake Spiderman, Batman, or Superman? I'm no movie buff but I don't recall a story-line like Avatar. This movie was so refreshing when it came out and it was put together so well (and that's probably why it was so expensive).

3930251,1,B002HEXVUI,"It's a movie about some blue people who were very intolerant of non-blue immigrants. They wouldn't even talk to them, so the non-blues had to change their appearance to fit in. The blues said, ""If you don't look the way we do, we don't want to know you."" So, they used avatars in order to look like the blues. However, the blues still said, ""Even though you look like we do, you'll never be one of us,"" and so they were hostile to the non-blues. The blue people's World Tree Center is attacked and destroyed. They were attacked because they greedily and selfishly hoarded an incredible fuel source that others, the non-blues, so desperately needed. They wouldn't share, so those non-blue people rebelled and attacked them. The blue people then decided that ""war is the answer"" and they rallied their troops to go to war with those they labelled ""terrorists"" rather than trying diplomacy. In the end, they won the war and in an act of complete intolerance, they forced all the non-blue-skinned immigrants to leave their world because they assumed they're all bad.

3930263,3,B002HEXVUI,"Good movie but it could have been better.

First, if you don't want to have to modify the objectionable language later--don't put In the film. Kids like these kinds of movies--Cameron should have known better.  No matter how realistic you wish to make a film, it's only a film and for the sake of propriety certain things should be amended instinctively.

While the hair and the clothes of the Navi move, you don't see any of the muscles move a lot, if at all--the gravity? Maybe; the pecs should move somewhat, regardless.

How can a body without a spirit not go into Riga mortise?  It should have been a rough entrance for the avatar controllers if the natural laws were followed on either side of the fence.

Every last animal in the film was ugly; there weren't any cute or attractive animals--none.  From the horse-like creatures, to the cattle, and the banshees--all ugly with some of them appendaged Edgar Rice Burroughs style.

Is the height of the Navi ever mentioned?  I think the audience would have been interested in knowing the average height of males and that of females especially since there is a slight difference between human height and Navi height.

The soundtrack/score is the  worst  thing about this movie.  It doesn't match the movie.  In fact from the very beginning it got me thinking of Africa--and not Pandora.  At the beginning of the movie the sound of drums are heard rumbling above canopy and throughout the  jungle leading the audience to believe that sometime during the movie they will witness the natives playing the war drums.

Nevertheless, this does not materialize; instead, what you do get in one scene of the movie is the sound of what may be a one-beat drum being struck with a single stick, by sick or old Navi male who sounds like an Indian/Native American--the voice and the drumbeat.  That's all the drum playing one hears. So what style of drums do the Navi play?  African or Indian/Native American drums style?  Based on the film, they don't play the drum much and since it's not shown it may not even be a drum as we know it; it could be the backside of some huge bow-legged bug or animal being slapped by their hand.  They may not even know what drums are.

How many times throughout the whole movie did the Navi get together in a powwow and play the drums and do the dance of the stinging bat? Even if you decide to watch the flick in slow-motion you're not going to see them playing the drums; did you see a war dance with rolling drum beats or did Netyri ever try to teach Jake the subtle art of the tom-tom or how to connect to a one? Nope--it didn't happen on my watch.

And that's before the main score begins.  In the score they used these corny voices and cheap flutes to endeavor to evoke some surreal melancholy emotion and it did just the opposite for me.  Much of the soundtrack/score just reminded me of Africa and/or the Lion King and definitely not Pandora.  They failed to create a signature soundtrack for the film.  When you hear the score for Indiana Jones, you  immediately know what movie it's from.  If you ever hear the one for Avatar on the radio (And I hope that never happens.), you're not going to connect it to Avatar.  It's extremely incongruent with what you're watching.  First you're listening to what sounds like a James Horner score and then all of a sudden these ridiculous voices and flutes jump in to spoil the mood.

James Horner blew this soundtrack/score opportunity.  I don't know if he was brow-beaten into doing it or if it was his idea but I cringe whenever I hear those freaky echoing voices vibrating through the air in 7.1.  I wish they would have included a replacement score for an ""objectionable soundtrack.""  Yuck! If it wouldn't have been for the corny voices and cheap flutes, I would have given it 4 stars.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot; the theme song ""I See You,"" is abrasive. It's a bad way to end a movie with a voice that is out of place. Instead of a gentle voice with mellow music they decide on a vulgar voice with rough music. It may have worked for a James Bond movie, but not for this one.

Disappointing.

Other than those troubling points, it's a pretty good movie.",1397606400,,4180,4.524

3930268,5,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron is just an incredible movie maker. His attention to detail is extraordinary and it shows in this move.

Yes, he did copy common themes from nearly every great Science Fiction movie I've ever seen but so what? It did a wonderful job. The character development is outstanding and the bad guys and good guys are very typecast. After 30 minutes into this movie I really hated the bad guys and the corporation and really loved the good guys and women in this move. Wanna see touch women in action, this movie has them. Wanna see people overcoming handicaps and saving an entire civilization, this movie has that as well. Wanna see giant war robots and advanced weapons and terrific battle screens, well we have that here too. Want to see lush vegetation and floating sky islands and dragon riders, well its all here!

Now lets talk about the visuals! Great spectrum of colors, especially blue, reds and greens. Cameron invented new technology that allow actors to actually physically play their roles and show expressions (even in the alien bodies that were applied via computer to replace their actual bodies). The visuals are absolutely stunning, the picture is incredibly sharp! The sound and dialogue is very clear, easy to follow the conversations.

In Summary: great visuals, clear dialog, lots of action, a happy ending--what more could you want? Highly recommended!",1397433600,,1382,4.974025974025974

3930295,5,B002HEXVUI,"Of course, many (most? all?) people have seen this movie, so they know the amazing storyline, the better-than-Dances-With-Wolves-in-space conceptualization and wonderment of the film. The actors are sympathetic, the alien cultures are amazing, the plugged-into-the-planet stuff is fun, as are the baddie turnaround stuff. The first half is a bit peculiar, as it seems to follow our scientists a bit too closely, and we wonder why this planet of menace has suddenly become so cuddly, but after a while we get used to it and are sold on James Cameron's ideas. ""When you see nothing, you see everything"" Grace tells Jake, who thinks to himself ""Sometimes I have no idea what she's talking about."" Good to have lines like that in the film. The narration concept seems a bit hokey at first, although it later comes back and bites Jake when Colonel Quaritch uses it against him (as he does with everything else - the ultra alpha male). Zoe Saldana is stunning as Neytiri, Joel David Moore is not bad as the goofy Dr. Norm Spellman, Michelle Rodriguez is okay as the butch helicopter pilot Trudy Chacn, Stephen Lang is stunning as the terrifying military-security psychopath Colonel Miles Quaritch (lots of cornball military-esque speeches and evil taunting), while Sam Worthington is quite decent as Jake Sully (and he's way way better as a Nav'i than he was as a Terminator in Terminator:Salvation). Very cool to see CCH Pounder pop up as Mo'at, the Omaticaya's spiritual leader. Silly/obvious symbolism in the name of the planet, Pandora (opening Pandora's box).

The extras are fantastic, and there are tons of them!!

There's over an hour of outtakes in various scenes of completion, and they are very interesting! There's a getting' drunk scene, an in-bed scene with Norm and Trudy (!!!!), a peyote scene, the pelvic universe, the whipping stick challenge. An extended attack on a squad, and a scene of Grace becoming one with the universe. ""You're a long way from Earth"" coup scene as Quaritch takes a slice off of outpost commander Parker Selfridge, played by a sniveling Giovanni Ribisi. There's drums and a war dance, very cool. New/Additional scenes from the special edition runs 16:30, and includes a school scene (with The Lorax featured prominently and poignantly), and the scene of Neytiri's brother's death as he's put out tof his misery. New/Additional Scenes from the Collector's Extended cut goes for 32:40, mainly featuring an extended opening of scenes 2-19, which show a lot of life on Earth, Jake viewing his brother's body in the morgue, getting in a bar fight from his wheelchair, navigating the masses, getting recruited ungraciously, scenes in the space ship heading to Pandora, mining machines, refinery, Neytiri's sister's death ,Grace and Jake bonding, fate of Neytiri's sister. Then there's a long documentary called Capturing Avatar, 1:38:00. James Cameron relates in it how he spent a lot of time in the woods in Kapuscasing, where he grew up, so he wanted to do something that was close to nature (I guess he got sick of Terminators and evil machines), playing with critters and drawing. Jon Landau talks too about Brother Termrite. In designing the Nav'i, they wondered ""how alien do you get?"" Took almost two years to get the banshees right. Nav'i had to be sexy without being just blue humans. They did a 38-second test shot of the capturing technology before getting budget. Shows the auditions of Sam Worthington and Zoe Soldana. A 3-D screen test, January 2007 they got the green light - exciting and daunting (funny how they never mention Dances With Wolves even once!!). Paul Frommer came in to develop a Nav'i language. It's ironic that it's the humans who are the aliens in this film. James Cameron's brother is a marinade, John David Cameron, a Desert Storm vet, he provided advice. Terry Notary, movement coach. All are lefties. Archery experts. Reproducing human emotions, evading dead-eye (remember Polar Express?). Performance capture gives actors wings. Beanstalk-climing situation. CCH Pounder. Editing it down during post-production. The first 13 shots took a year. By the end, they were doing 200 shots a week. The crew talks - one buy was on Avatar so long, that his wife had two more kids. One guy met a girl through someone on Avatar, they got married and had a kid, all while Avatar continued. ""Avatar is a dick magnet!!""",1396137600,,4371,4.994513031550069

3930319,5,B002HEXVUI,The item was on time and in good condition. I had previously ordered it from another seller on Amazon and was informed that they had actually sold it already. I was so unhappy. I thought I would take another chance at ordering it before purchasing it at Walmart. So I was soooo happy that this seller was more informed about what was actually in their warehouse or other. I appreciate that. This is a great movie and I actually had not ever seen it until the end of December 2013 with a close friend. Loved It! Happy to now own my own copy.,1395100800,2,540,4.252427184466019

3930321,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is my favorite movie of all time. The theme and production of this movie is simply top notch. I don't like to see movies more then once, but when this movie first came out in theaters,  I HAD to go back and watch it a second time. It is that good, and In my opinion, watching it in 3D is simply the best experience. I think I like this movie so much because I draw a lot of parallels between this movie and life it's self. In my opinion, we are all Avatars for our spirit in our physical form as we know it. Just my humble opinion. Enjoy! :)",1395100800,,548,3.936936936936937

3930323,5,B002HEXVUI,I am a true sci-fi fan and loved this story! I have often wondered what could happen if we made it to other worlds. I figured we would have little regard for indigenous life and only be interested in what we could take from a new world. This story seems to follow that path and is done in a way that shows the error of that type of mind-set. I loved the totally alien world depicted in the film!,1394755200,,395,4.012658227848101

3930327,5,B002HEXVUI,"We loved Avatar 3D in the theater, now we have it at home, and our Plasma TV reproduces the 3D effect as excellent as at the theater.

My only criticism is that the 3D version of the movies should also be the Director's cut versions and/or the extended versions. 3D movies are already much more expensive than 2D, therefore they should also have more content!!!

No effort whatsoever was made in putting together an interesting story with interesting characters with personality and dialog

I really wish I could get back that two and a half hours of my life.

In terms of story, characters, and dialog this movie had pretty much every trite cliche imaginable.

I was hoping Cameron had come back to his senses and put together a good science fiction story. Unfortunately, Cameron has not made a decent film in years. He's done some great work in developing movie making technology, but it's been a long time since he has put any effort into story, characters, and dialog.",1394150400,7,784,4.708029197080292

This 1 got  3 Oscars.  I felt it deserved a couple more.  It's well ahead of others re special/visual effects.  The extended version adds about 43 minutes to the version 1st released in theaters.  I prefer the longest version, & look forward to the next release.",1393545600,2,580,4.480769230769231

However, if you liked this movie, I highly recommend getting the 3-disc Extended Edition instead... they offer it in either DVD or Blu-ray - in other words you get 3 Blu-rays or 3 DVD's depending on your choice. The 3-disc Blu-ray Extended Edition is AMAZING... it has 3 versions of the film, plus a seperate ""family audio track"" for people who have younger kids and don't want them to hear the bad language. Then there are 2 discs committed to special features - literally hours and hours of them. So I highly recommend the 3-disc version - 5 stars.",1391040000,,734,4.568181818181818

If that was all that was good about Avatar, it would still be worth watching. But it did have a compelling (if not always logical) story with lots and lots of cool action. The pace is near perfect. Lots of action interspersed with quieter moments so the audience does not get fatigued and just wish it was over. At way over 2 hours it sure did not feel like it.

One downside is like many Cameron movies, he has a rather shallow view of both the military and corporate types - they are almost always one dimensional and nearly always villains or cowards or both. Worse, is the subliminal message that indigenous people - Good; humans bad. Religion bad but paganism good.

3930508,5,B002HEXVUI,"Ive seen some great films in the last few months (e.g. The Road, Paranormal Activity) but nothing Ive seen on a big or small screen prepared me for Avatar. This is not a movie, it is an event. My only request: see it in 3-D.If you're like me, you are a skeptic of 3-D technology. Its gimmicky, it washes out the colors and blurs the picture. But not Avatar. Here the 3-D is seamlessly interwoven with the film and every color and line remains crisp and clear. Brilliantly done.

The story is, in certain respect, fairly conventional: Disneys Pochahontas on steroids. In essence, earthlings are planning to mine the planet Pandora (an Edenic paradise, albeit with a healthy dose of natural evil, particularly in the form of some pretty frightening carnivores). While were on the topic of evil, theres a-plenty displayed in the earthlings destructive pillaging of Pandora for the investors of a faceless corporation. Anyways, the love an earthling discovers for an alien and her culture messes things up.

As the Native American storyteller says, I don't know if it happened this way or not, but I know this story is true. Watching Avatar I was impacted by how true it is. The obsessive search for the valuable mineral on Pandora reminded me of the destructive pillaging of Northern Albertas oil sands. The attempted relocation of Pandoras native Navi people in order to begin the mining operation reminded me of the UK governments evil deportation of the native population of Diego Garcia to make way for a US military base. And the whole military operation with a thinly veiled rationale recalled to mind the recent invasion of Iraq (as Alan Greenspan recently admitted, its about the oil, stupid). (Lest the viewer miss the allusion, the film makes the link with Iraq rather obvious with a reference to shock and awe.)

In short this is an invaluable tract for our times. And thats just the tip of the iceberg (clever reference to Titanic eh?): there are numerous themes to unpack: militarism, nationalism, environmentalism, racism, speciesism, and the complex interrelationship of science, religion, and the grinding pragmatism of entrepreneurial capitalism (the best discussion since Contact).

What is more, there is some tantalizing theology thrown in. Is Avatar offering a new version of the Gaia hypothesis? Is Jake Sully a Christ figure, coming from above to become Navi and save the people and their world? Discuss.

There is also some intriguing metaphysics. [warning: a modest spoiler ahead] In the end the human Jake Sully opts to continue life in his alien avatar body while leaving his human body behind. What sort of metaphysic of the human person is this? Either it suggests to me a substance dualism where the soul can be attached to various bodies or, more likely, a view where the human person consists of information which can simply be downloaded to various hard-drives (e.g. Sullys human or avatar body). (This reminded me of Frank Tiplers wackily wonderful  book The Physics of Immortality, albeit on a much more modest scale.)

In the end the runner-up star in the film is the technology of the 22nd century. It is great to see some of the ideas of future technology that Cameron explored in his masterpiece Aliens coming into fruition here.

But the star of the film is undoubtedly Pandora itself. The creatures are brilliant in their other-worldly weirdness; the jungle, with its dense foliage and phosphorescent night-time dreamscapes, is mesmerizing; the trees that make the General Sherman sequoia look like a sapling are simply dazzling; and the floating mountains? Well let me just say that if you thought Wyomings Tetons are beautiful, you really must check out Camerons visions. After twelve years, Canadian director James Cameron is still king of the world.

3930524,1,B002HEXVUI,"The following review was about the Extended Collectors version, which I reviewed but, like when I was led to buy it from this (the 3D version) page, it shows up on the 3D page....Amazon, what is going on here?  So, here is the review I originally wrote for the other version, not the 3D one which I am going to order and hope is a 3D movie.

Okay, now that I have finally tried watching this and find out that it is not the 3D version, AND I came back to the listing a reread everything, I see that it is not the 3D version, mea culpa.  But, the way the listing is worded it sure does lead one to think it is and I am very disappointed.  In the meantime, I have found a website that rents 3D movies (3DBlurayrental.com) so won't be making this mistake again as I don't have to buy the movies to watch them on my awesome 3D system.

Amazon, I am getting more and more tired of your letting these kind of misleading things get through, as well as more and more really lousy items and sellers.  I am losing my incredible interest in your system and am beginning to shop elsewhere (where I can, many times, find better deals, too).  Get it together or you are going to lose we very loyal customers.  I used to always come here first for pricing on everything, now not so much.",1388880000,,1272,4.163265306122449

This is a movie you HAVE to own if you have a 3D set. The story line is a cross between Lion King and The Matrix in my opinion. It's a great story, moving at times (my wife cried and I almost did). In 3D, I actually ducked when the Avatar swung his sword. It's that realistic. James Cameron, of Titanic fame, hit it big with this movie.

I would not recommend this for children, however, as the adult content and violence make it inappropriate for those under age 13 in my opinion. But for adults? Wow!",1388534400,2,617,4.356521739130435

3930560,5,B002HEXVUI,"I have 3 versions of Avatar - the Original Bluray, the Extended Collectors Edition, and I just purchased the 3D version.

Of the 3 - the 3 D version is THE definitive version for visuals. There are no cheesy ""pop out"" scenes. The 3D gives you a sense of depth, and the details are just superb. The audio track is superb and really helps one to be immersed in the movie. There are no extras on this disc though - just Play, Setup, and Scene selections. This is the Theatrical Version. As far as I can tell, there is no Extended Edition 3D - although that may be coming sometime....
Keep in mind the disc will play either 3D or 2D, so if you are thinking of getting 3D and have a blu-ray player, this version is a good one to get. Plus is has a DVD disc. UV as well - although I am not a fan of UV. I would rather have iTunes compatible.

The Extended Collectors Edition is the one to get if you have Blu-ray and don't care about 3D. The Extended Collectors Edition has all the extras and the longer edition of the film. For in-depth fan of the movie - this is the one to get... If you are major Avatar Fan, and want the 3D as well - you get to double dip and have to buy the 3D theatrical version.",1388102400,2,1196,4.0210084033613445

We had no idea how long the movie was but about an hour and a half into the movie, I started having hard contractions about 3 minutes apart. My husband suggested we leave. I wanted to finish the movie though and thought it had to be over soon. Obviously, I was wrong. Thankfully, my water didn't break and contractions slowed down after about an hour so we were able to finish the movie. The baby was born two days later. I'm not sure if the baby's eventual birth was a direct result of the movie or the fact that I was already well past my due date, but when you're that far along, you'll try anything. So I would definitely recommend watching Avatar if you want to speed up your due date.

3930605,5,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron's film Avatar not only entertains, but also brings up an important theme relating to evolution.  The film focuses on a fictional planet where the native Na'Vi are being invaded by humans.  While the humans in the film do not view the Na'Vi as equals, Cameron does portray them in a way that invites comparison between the two species.  While the humans are technologically superior, the Na'Vi have the physical advantage.  Furthermore, the Na'Vi have evolved into a point where they can live in perfect harmony with the environment, while the humans merely want to exploit it for their own gain.  This contrast between the Na'Vi and the humans shows what Cameron believes is several flaws that humans have.  This contrast shows that in fact the Na'Vi are more evolved than humans, and this leads to a conflict that is compelling and interesting.",1386288000,,859,4.930555555555555

3930615,3,B002HEXVUI,"Even though it is subtle, there are a number of places (roughly 7) where the video has jumps in it.  These jumps are very small but they are noticeable. To me it detracts from the viewing experience and I'm surprised that a professional production house allowed it to go out this way.

That being said, Avatar is still an epic story with epic imagery.  I just expected the video to be totally smooth...is that too much to expect?",1385942400,,429,4.4743589743589745

That's where James Cameron, JJ Abrams, and a couple others earn their money.  Avatar rocked in the theater and the Blu Ray does the same at home.

The movie is splendid, with great actors, sets, story and wonderful direction.

3930634,5,B002HEXVUI,"What a thrill!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have seen this movie in a few different mediums now and Blu-ray just wipes everything out.  There is something about Disney Dvd's and Blu-ray's that is more clear and bolder.  Everyone of their movies I have seen are crisps and clearer.  They just jump out at you.  You know in a few minutes it was done by Disney if you are a movie buff.  I got hooked on Blu-ray on a different title movie and it it is hard to go back to anything other medium.

Just like the picture the sound is incredible as well.  The clearity and dynamics are incredible. Crystal clear.

I like to wait to see if a directer puts out and extende version a their movies.  The extra scenes really fill in the story on this one though.  Much more then most.  Most extended editions additional scenes are cool to see but are just what they are filler.  There are a few editions that do this but this is about this movie so I will not give others time in the review.",1385251200,,962,4.248618784530387

After we got our 3D rig up and running, this was the first 3D blu-ray we bought.  I can confirm that if you consider yourself an Avatar fan, then you really need to see it in 3D.  There were certain scenes, like Neytiri stalking Jake, where the jungle comes alive with depth.  It was almost like watching it for the first time again.",1385164800,,470,4.065217391304348

From the fake-looking CGI to the fact that this movie is just a Pocahontas ripoff with blue cat people, this movie thoroughly bored me from beginning to end.

We used to go every Sunday after church and I'd pick a new movie one week and she'd pick the next. I can still remember watching as the burning tree fell, trying to brush the embers off my shoulder, turning to my wife and we both just laughed!",1384819200,,339,3.857142857142857
3930645,4,B002HEXVUI,"I think we all know and love Avatar, for its deeply immersive setting, despite the overused plot formula.  Shortly after watching the movie in theaters, I and some friends were discussing the movie, and when the simplicity of the plot was brought up, one guy (who hadn't even seen the movie) managed to sum up the plot in three short phrases: ""Guy is sent into enemy base; Guy falls in love; Guy rebels against his own people,"" and I told him that was exactly how it happened.

What a summary of the plot cannot capture, though, is the rich detail in the story and setting of the film, which manages to outshine the clumsy dialogue and simple plot.  It was apparent to me, after watching the film, that there is so much more to the story than was portrayed in the theatrical cut.  My uncle and I had discussed Jake and Neytiri's love scene with the same perspective: with such an efficient system of telepathy as Ze-Halu (I am probably spelling it wrong), why would they not use it on each other during their most intimate moment together?  As it turned out, before the editors clipped around the edges of the scene, Jake and Neytiri did use 'the Bond' before making love.

There was a lot more to the original opening, and the theatrical release skipped all but a couple of references to Grace Augustine's school for English, which actually had significant scenes dedicated just to it.

Yes, there were a couple of scenes that seriously could have been left out of even the extended release, especially one in particular near the end, which just made it drag.  I couldn't even make out most of what the characters said in that scene.  Those you just have to deal with if you want to watch the extended release.

However, overall the ""Collector's Extended"" release actually makes the movie experience that much more believable.  With the extended version, you actually get a sense of TIME.  You actually begin to have more sympathy with the characters because you get to find out about their pasts.  Several formerly shortened or phased scenes now present a more accurate sense of time and personality than they did before, the love scene and the numerous hunting scenes as well.

If it weren't for that one irritating scene (another review provides more detailed spoilers on the extended scenes if you care to read them), I would have rated this extended release five stars, but I can't forgive that one dragging burr in an otherwise rich and crisp release.

Summary:

Video: 4.5/5 (not all transitions were completely professional between theatrical and extended scenes)
Audio: 5/5
Extended Scenes: 4.5/5 (one scene added back in was a thorn in my paw)
Overall: 4.5/5",1384732800,,2669,4.744588744588745

3930676,4,B002HEXVUI,"With it rapidly approaching 4,000 reviews, I'm not going to rehash the plot of AVATAR, which has literally been seen by billions.  This is (was?) a groundbreaking film when released in 2009; and although the plot is unoriginal and predictable, the process and technology creating another world, Pandora, populated by the Na'Vi, 10-foot tall, blue-skinned natives--all the product of motion capture technology by the various actors portraying the humanoids--are stunning.  I've seen AVATAR on cable several times, and while I'm not enough of a fan of the film to purchase this 3-disc extended collector's edition, I do give kudos to James Cameron and his very talented team of filmmakers; these pros have successfully created a very believable world inhabited by very believable natives and wildlife.  This film is a stunning visual feast.

And this doesn't even consider the minutiae--like creating a whole new language, for goodness' sake.  Again, I am in total awe of the process involved bringing AVATAR to life; no telling how many countless hours were involved, on the part of thousands of people, during production and post-production, to make this film a reality.  Finally, although leads Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana give solid performances, I really enjoyed the second tier of the cast, including the sizzling Michelle Rodriguez (Trudy), the menacing Stephen Lang (Colonel Miles Quaritch), Joel David Moore (Norm), Dileep Rao (Max), Giovanni Ribisi (Parker, in charge of running the mining operation laying waste to Pandora; he's a scoundrel, but you can't help but like him), the incredible Wes Studi (Eytukan), and Laz Alonso (Tsu'tey).  These actors fill in the various gaps quite nicely.  No, I'm not endorsing buying this collector's edition--but I highly recommend, if you're one of the ten people who haven't seen AVATAR, to watch this incredible film.  And if you become a huge admirer and fan, then this 3-disc spectacular is going to be right down your alley.

3930682,5,B002HEXVUI,"this is the essential version of Avatar that you need to watch. the added scenes (or, rather, re-added) fill the story much more nicely and add so much more backstory to the characters. The film just seems ""complete"" now, despite how you may have felt previously, with the theatrical version.

picture:
amazing. i would go so far as to say it's flawless. color is absolutely gorgeous. lines are super strong and crisp. no edge halos, banding, motion blur in sight. black levels are black. the lushy greens of the jungles are so pretty to look at. the blue skin is beautifully blue. everything looks smooth and i can't say this enough: the picture is absolutely gorgeous.

audio:
please. ok, ok. if you must hear something about it: the lossless HD audio is outstanding. I use this film (and, now, this version of this film) as a demo to show off my sound system to friends and family. the wall of sound that encompasses you throughout each speaker travels around the room and forces you to experience the film's foreign world from the inside out. you'll hear everything from unseen creatures chirping in the background of your rear, surround speakers, to gunfire blasting from your subwoofer throughout the front AND surround speakers. LFE output is strong and heavy, to say the absolute least. wind and rustling of leaves are so subtly crisp that you may likely forget you're listening for these things and just get immersed into the film's world itself. that happened frequently with me. regardless, everything about the audio quality for this Extended Avatar Collector's Edition release is amazing.

overall:
highly, highly, highly recommended. if you feel you didn't like the theatrical version for whatever reason, perhaps because of its story, check this out. its extended scenes may make you change your mind about the film and its characters. also, the special features are abundant and certainly entertaining to rummage through.

3930704,5,B002HEXVUI,"Its not War and Peace, but its no accident this movie was number one at the box office. We saw it in 2D, Real 3D, and IMAX 3d plus the 3D Blue Ray came with our 60"" Panasonic plasma for free. This is our loaner disc. Great pace, breathtaking vistas, heavy metal weapons of war and so much attention to detail we continue to watch it several times a year and never tire of it. Created from its inception for 3D, and a labour of love, no doubt, my only complaint is I would have preferred  more +Z or off the screen ""in your face"" from Cameron. IMAX does 3D best, but we have other movies where there is more than mere ""depth"" being the benefit of 3D. When you feel you can reach out  and touch components of the movie, like foliage, etc., 3D becomes the knew paradigm: TOTAL IMMERSION! I have about thirty 3D titles and very few delivered this extra dimension and I'm losing interest in paying so much extra for so little more.",1382054400,,926,4.2259887005649714

3930743,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar will probably always remain one of my favorite movie experiences of all time.  I will never forget the incredible thrill of first viewing it in the movie theater.  I knew, once I had purchased my first 60"" flat-screen 3D television, that Avatar would be my very first 3D movie purchase.  And while I still love the movie, watching the 3D version of Avatar on my television screen was not nearly as thrilling as my first experience watching it on the regular theater 2D screen.  Further, I have since owned other 3D titles that come across much more startlingly ""real"" than this copy of Avatar (Life of Pi comes immediately to mind).  That is NOT saying that this 3D version of Avatar is ""bad"", it's just that, I guess, I was expecting more and that it didn't really deliver on that front.  Having said that, the movie itself is still a masterpiece in my book.  Avatar was--and is--simply an almost magical experience in many respects and allows the view to almost transcend and suspend belief in the often dreary day-to-day of our existence.  It allows us to cavort in that magical fairy land that is Navoo and run with and fly winged dragons with the Na'vi.  This was, for me, among the most thrilling film experiences since The Wizard of Oz (which I used to watch religiously every year as a kid) and the first Star Wars movies.  I've heard all kinds of criticisms of Avatar, from political to other types of pans, but as far as I'm concerned, these people completely miss the forest for the trees.  They do not have the ability to recognize greatness when they see it.  These are the same people who panned The Wizard of Oz when it came out.

Avatar has been so thoroughly reviewed that I have nothing more to add to the discussion that hasn't already been said. I've stated my sole criticism and that is a minor one:  that the 3D version of this disc was not as impressive as I'd expected or hoped for.  Beyond that, the movie itself is still one of the greatest in the sci-fi/fantasy genre of all time and, as a bonus (or a curse?) are indeed powerful messages that many today would choose not to be there, ""interfering"" with their pure entertainment experience, but are nevertheless important points that need to be made.  Like it or not.  I can absolutely recommend this movie to those who enjoy a totally immersive film-going experience.",1380412800,6,2352,4.588516746411483
3930744,4,B002HEXVUI,Watched part of the movie in a motel on a trip. Really liked it. So brought this set so we could watch the beginning of the movie. Great graphics.,1380412800,,146,4.068965517241379

3930746,4,B002HEXVUI,Movie that was received skipped and had scratches when it was labeled as working and good condition. However the seller promptly returned my frustrated email and immediately issued a refund. Will buy from them again :),1380240000,,218,5.083333333333333
3930747,2,B002HEXVUI,"What happens when you take Disney's Pocahontas, change the skin color of the people to blue and throw in the word ""unobtainium"" and the name ""Pandora""? You get Avatar. I'm not kidding, Google it.

In our days of flashy CG effects and Michael Bay-esque explosions, we tend to forget that story matters and stories should be unique and interesting not just flashy. Take Star Wars for instance, the cheap effects and obvious puppets of the original trilogy are vastly better than the weak stories and terrible acting in the new trilogy. So when I have asked my friends why they like Avatar so much, the spew out the ""Look how cool it is!"" line. This is nothing short of the same as a bird attracted to a shiny piece of metal.

In short, the story is a direct rip-off. The acting is ok, some of the performances are good and others are downright awful. But the movie itself is not for me. If you are a fan of the film, I'm sure a 3D Blu-ray is just what you are looking for, I simply disagree.",1380153600,,989,4.34054054054054

When selecting one or the other, it is impossible to tell which one is being chosen as the icon doesn't display differently, so you just have to hope you get it right.  I am not sure if it is production wide or just my DVD.  I should have returned it, but I didn't actually sit down to watch it until months after I had bought it.

3930790,4,B002HEXVUI,"The movie avatar was about a soldier who was hurt on the battle field and was left with both his legs dysfunctional. Jack Sully, was a paraplegic, He was only called back to duty only because the military needed him, but not to fight for he was not even able to walk. They needed him because his brother was a scientists who was working on a planet called Pandora. He was killed and to work on what he was working on they needed his DNA. They were only there to discover it and work around it but found out about the others living there and in order to not look odd, they created `Avatars' in which Jack found the people and made connections with them. He fell in love with one of the `Navi' people. After falling in love he did everything to stop them from ruining their sacred lands in order to obtain a priceless gem, or rock they would call it.
This movie is an overall good movie and really well relates to a lot of things. In regards to world religions, it shows us how where ever we go we need to tread lightly and make sure as to what we are doing and how it affects others. For in the movie where the Military just ran into the lands and then were threaten when they started to fight back they went and crushed everything they walked on. May it have been plants, animals, anything? I feel really bad for the Navi people when the military wanted to give them  a warning to they were coming and did not care about them, they gassed the people and took down their `Tree' which was home. They did this and it reminded me of how they just went on thinking they could do this and not really give a thought as to why these people had it sacred and if they wanted to get something out of this, they needed to respect their ways, and respect their beliefs. For this was their land and the military just barged in and ruined families, killed many honorable people of their tribes. Just to get a priceless gem.",1378512000,,1908,4.213114754098361

I watched the movie in the theater in both 3D and 2D and could not wait for the DVD.  This 3 disc edition is fantastic because you can watch the extended version as well and it's worth it.

If you love stories which become metaphors for historical events, then you will love this.  Watch the movie for fun...then watch it again and think about the Europeans coming to the continent they named America, systematically destroying a thriving culture to the point of genocide and Avatar takes on a new meaning.

I am giving Avatar 5 stars and calling it my favorite movie of all time because not only is it action-packed, beautifully shot, acted well, perfect length for a movie and wonderful music but also because there is a very, very deep meaning to the story...one which cannot be denied or ignored by intelligent humans.

Good story, action, colorful, spectacular special effects, good acting, kind of a modern fairy tale for adults. (Stange way of putting it maybe, I know...but that's my opinion.) Kind of long and some scenes in flying thru trees maybe a couple hours into movie is kind of drawn out. Think movie is in the 3 hr range, more or less. Maybe plan to watch it in two sittings. I think it deservedly won whatever awards it did. Pretty much a family movie, but careful anyway...there's violence. Best to check ratings. This would have been great to see in 3D on IMAX screen. Small screen doesn't do it justice...but it's still a very good movie. Make lots of popcorn.",1376611200,,753,4.544117647058823

3930848,5,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron showed great vision as a director on this movie. I can see why it took quite awhile to even make the movie. James Cameron took great care with down to the smallest details on this movie. It also took awhile for technology to be able to catch up in order to make this film. Visually Avatar is stunning. The colors on Blu-ray are awesome.
I enjoyed Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana's acting on this film. Sigourney Weaver was so great in this film in the supporting role that I had to appreciate her as an actress all over again. I even enjoyed Leona Lewis's lead vocal on the closing song of the film. The song shows that Leona Lewis has quite a vocal range.
For some reason I wasn't able to appreciate this film as much as I should have when I saw it in the movie theater. I am so glad that I bought this film on Blu-ray. I was able to appreciate it fully in this format.
Avatar is one of the films that enjoy well enough to watch again whenever the mood strikes me. I count it as a must see for true fans of sci fi.

One TV is 3D ready DLP Link active shutter and the other is passive 3D.  I expected results to be better with active shutter but was surprised that the passive 3D yielded at least as good a picture without the angle and distance limitations of DLP Link.  Not sure whether the problems with DLP Link are with the TV or the glasses.  The movie is much more immersive when viewed in 3D.  It's at least as good as it was in IMAX 3D.,1376265600,,549,4.132075471698113

3930861,2,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron's Avatar is probably one of the most overrated movies of the last decade.  Avatar is the textbook definition of style over substance.  The film is cool visuals and decent action and that is all.  The film has no interesting characters, the villains are all comical stereotypes with no dimension at all, and it is predictable from beginning to end.  The plot of this film has been done to death in tons of other films, so there are no surprises.  This film does not deserve to be the highest grossing film ever.  Plus the film is way too long.  Many scenes could have been cut and it would have been the same movie.

The biggest problem is the plot, which is extremely predictable.  From the first ten minutes I could guess how the film would play out and I was right.  The plot is basically the plot of Dances with Wolves but with aliens instead of Native Americans.  You have a soldier who is hired to drive the natives off the land.  However, as the film goes on he befriends the natives and learns of their culture.  Eventually he joins the natives and fights his own people.  I would not be so upset if they just took a few elements from Dances with Wolves.  However, Avatar is Dances with Wolves, just with aliens.  There is almost no difference at all.

What's worse is that the characters are really lame.  Sam Worthington's character is generic and not interesting at all.  Sam Worthington does not do a horrible job performance wise, but half of the time he looks like he is ready for lunch.  His character is the stereotypical good guy and the fish-out-of-water.  He is also kind of an idiot.  For example, that scene when he first is transferred into the avatar body and has legs is cringe-worthy and goes on for too long.  He just behaves like a little kid that got his new toy.  The supporting characters are boring as well.  Many of them are just devices used to move the plot along like Michelle Rodriguez's character.  Sigourney Weaver is in this too.  She does fine but she cannot save the cast.

The villains are even worse.  They are unbelievable stereotypical and one-dimensional.  One of the villains played by Giovanni Ribisi is just the stereotypical rich guy who only cares about money.  The other big villain played by Stephen Lang is the over-the-top one-dimensional general who wants to destroy the Navi civilization for no other reason than he is the bad guy of the movie.  These seem more like Captain Planet villains than ones you would see in a supposedly adult film like this.

It is a shame because James Cameron used to know how to write good characters.  He wrote Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Hudson from Aliens.  He also created iconic characters like Sarah Connor and John Connor from Terminator.  Cameron could also write good villains like the T-1000 from Terminator 2 or Burk from Aliens.  Now he seems to care more for the effects and the spectacle of a movie rather than the story and character.  With both this and Titanic before Cameron has given us oversimplified characters that are mostly there for forced drama and/or to drive home a message that you see on countless after school specials.  He had fifteen years to work on Avatar, so there is no excuse for a predictable story and bland characters like what we have here.  He obviously cared more about making the effects look amazing (which they do) and the story and characters were just an afterthought.

There are good things about the film.  The effects look amazing.  Pandora is very colorful, unique, and pleasing to the eye.  I have not seen it in 3D, but I heard that it was pretty good.  It also has some decent action, particularly at the end with the final battle.  Many people who defend this movie say that it is more about the experience of being on Pandora.  Yes, it is a good experience in the theater, but that does not mean that the film is good.

A film needs more than spectacle to be good.  There are lots of films where I had a good experience watching the film in theaters, but as I thought about it more and watched it again at home I find that the film is not that good.  X-men Origins Wolverine is a film that quickly comes to mind.  I did not even have that great of an experience watching it in the theater actually.  It was fun to look at, but the story and characters were too bland for me, and I was just bored.  I found this to be a very boring movie.

Overall, if you want to sit through two hours and forty minutes of eye candy then by all means see the film, although most people have seen the film by now.  I personally, found Avatar to be an extremely long, predictable, simplistic, boring movie.",1376006400,,4643,4.495808383233533
3930862,4,B002HEXVUI,"Great to see movie, but surprise...it required me to update the system software on my Samsung dvd player.

3930863,5,B002HEXVUI,"Personally, I have not been a big fan of this movie because when I saw it for the first time some years ago I was so tired that did not pay that close attention that it really deserved. Based on that, I decided lately to give it a try, so after purchasing the  3D version of it and watching in its REAL DIMENSION I could finally understand the REAL VALUE of seeing such a fantastic  film that takes you to the REAL PANDORA and embraces you un a unique breathtaking journey that worths every dollar you have spent for this!

Plus, I invite any doubtful purchaser to get enchanted with this Combo pack due to you can see it through different formats everywhere you want.

Unfortunately it does not come with any extra material ( deleted scenes, interviews, making of, etc) but it does not matter that much since you can purchase the other EXTENDED VERSION  as well for you to complete your enjoyment.

NOTE: there is no 3D version of the extended version just in case, so the fact of watching THIS movie in 3D motivated me to have it and I do not have any regrets at all!!!!

Through fantasy & fiction, James Cameron brings us up close & personal with the natural environment around us, including creatures we dismiss out-of-hand as being inferior to us & therefore not worth our respect of even being alive.

Instant Classic!

I really appreciate works of art that make you think, explore deep issues, and provide a satisfying conclusion.  This movie delivers abundantly on each point.  Some, like this one or Star Wars or The Lord of the Rings, do it in a more cinematic and action adventure way, whereas others, like the Fountain or Solaris or Cloud Atlas, do it in a much deeper, more intensely personal and emotionally driven way that can leave you weeping for days and frankly require multiple viewings to truly understand them; but I appreciate both methods.  So what is Avatar all about?  Read on.

Avatar is a massive cinematic action adventure with spectacular effects and a deeply engrossing story line that effectively portrays the clash between those driven solely by the limited pursuit of economic gain and personal prejudice vs those more interested in a deeply spiritual, connected and rewarding way of life.  The visuals, alone, of the various Pandoran ecological zones, are worth the price of admission.

I really liked the idea that a wheelchair bound military veteran could be an action hero star (albeit with the help of technology).  The natives are admirable if a bit simplistic, and the human villains are over the top bad. The emotional growth of the hero from mostly self centered and isolated (understandable given his situation) into an empowered native rights and environmental activist is deeply satisfying.  In fact, its interesting to see how each of the five main characters (sorry don't remember names so their roles are: Hero, Native Girl, Doc, Commander, Corporate Guy) and your impression of them changes over the course of the movie.  One, especially poignant, scene is later in the movie and revolves around the concept of the powerful becoming helpless if certain basic environmental variables changes.  (Viewers should be able to figure out which scene I am talking about  think Pod.)  This is poignant because we as a species tend to think something or someone is either powerful or weak and that status is somehow permanent  which it is not.  Change is inevitable of course, everything changes, but we just don't like to believe that, so we push it out of our minds and pretend its not true.

I realize some people object to certain aspects of the movie (they would argue its too emotional, too simplistic, etc) but if we as a species do not wake up, grow up (stop being self focused) and accept responsibility for our own actions - then we will get what we deserve.  Perhaps this movie might spark that realization.

Anyways, I heartily recommend this movie and hope you enjoy it.",1373414400,,2676,4.930803571428571
3930932,3,B002HEXVUI,"I dunno. I first saw this at the cinema in IMAX 3D and was blown away. The film indeed has incredible visuals, but I felt, as a story, it was pretty generic and flat. I likened it to one of those simulator rides at a fairground where the experience is more important than the story. So when I watched this again on Blu-ray in the comfort of my own home, I was again impressed by the effects, but frankly got a bit bored by the story. For me, it's a 'watch once and enjoy' film, but not something I want to own. I sold the Blu-ray and I don't miss it.",1373328000,,550,3.963963963963964

3930943,4,B002HEXVUI,"Wow! Those Marines sure are tough to kill!

James Cameron (""Titanic"" and ""The Abyss"") spent hundreds of millions of dollars on this project and in my opinion it's worth every penny! It has a solid serviceable story with a beginning, a middle and an end. It has LOTS of blowie uppie stuff. It has two worthy adversaries... both of them Marines. It takes place on an other-worldly planet that is meticulously realized: with fantastic flora and fauna; populated by blue-hued humanoids (yup, excellent CGI) with their own language and mythology. It has plenty of humor (the first time our hero has to wear a thong...you'll laugh). And it has a sweet romance... boy meets girl...you know....

The 3-D is so good that I automatically took a casual swipe at a pesky gnat that flew within my periphery, and the dust motes in the air are simply a realistic touch, no issue is made of them. In addition, I felt pangs of acrophobia as the characters ran atop a high tree branch or inched along a cliff's edge. This might be worth a 3-D player from Amazon.

The terrific cast includes:
  * Sam Worthington, who impressed me in ""Terminator Salvation"" (which was actually made after ""Avatar,"" as this film has been over 10 years in the making). British born, Australian bred, he makes my socks roll up and down. He always starts slow then wins me over when it counts. Watch this guy!
  * Sigourney Weaver (""Snow Cake"") is the queen of high-class Sci Fi (note the ""Alien"" franchise).
  * Zo Saldana is a blue humanoid, so you don't get to see her wonderful face. Just remember Uhura in 2009's ""Star Trek.""
  * Stephen Lang (""Men Who Stare at Goats"") provides the leavening for the dough. Just as Othello would be just another disgruntled Moor without a cunning Iago, our hero would be just another paraplegic Marine without this kickass opponent!
  * Michelle Rodriguez (""Fast & Furious"") is there when you need a tough chick on your side...

I'm sure you'll be fascinated by the tiny jellyfish-type floatie things that pulsate through the air, but do NOT drink too many liquids before starting this viewing, as this thing lasts over 2.5 hours and there is no dull interval where I can suggest a visit to the litter box. Time will fly, but not if you drink too many liquids!

3930950,5,B002HEXVUI,This movie was one of the best movies that I have enjoyed for years. Had it all and kept me interested all the way through.,1372550400,,123,3.96
3930951,5,B002HEXVUI,"Wow!  This works so well on my 3d TV!  I lost my 2d copy of Avatar and when I saw this on Amazon Prime for less than $20 in 3D, I couldn't resist.  The 3D effect is absolutely stunning!  Can't wait for Avatar 2 to hit the market!",1372550400,,229,3.7083333333333335
3930952,5,B002HEXVUI,We liked watching this 3D version of AVATAR BETTER THAN WATCHING IT IN THE THEATER. The picture has incredible clarity and depth and scenes just flow off the screen. Would highly recommend to people who like sci fi.,1372464000,,215,4.684210526315789
3930953,5,B002HEXVUI,"I have seen Avatar on blu-ray before, it had been a long time and the one I owned wasn't blu-ray.  All I can say is this movie was MADE to be a blu-ray, the experience is so incredible.  And the extras are so worth it!  I watched to disc that expanded on the making of the movie, and if you don't mind the fact that some of what you will be watching will be ""in production"", meaning it is not the finished product, it does so much to expand and explain more of the whole story.  It answered questions I had about the finished product and told so much about the characters.  Buy it!!!",1372377600,,583,4.078947368421052
3930954,5,B002HEXVUI,Waited a while for the price on this 3D movie to drop from the $100+ price point; never understood why it was like that. Well worth the wait. Favorite part of the movie- the tree assault.,1372377600,,187,4.222222222222222
3930955,5,B002HEXVUI,Bought a new Samsung 3D TV and what other movie could you pick. None. This was stunning in the movies and should be in every person with a 3D tv's collection,1372377600,,157,4.096774193548387
3930956,3,B002HEXVUI,"This movies cinematics are great, the art work is great, the sound is great, the storyline is what is should be for a being written in the early 90's, but the box.....this box has too many annoying steps, I would have preferred a standard case",1372291200,,243,4.4222222222222225
3930957,5,B002HEXVUI,"Unless you have an actual theater, you're never gonna repeat the original experience, but with today's big-screen 3D home theater systems - complete with the separate surround sound audio - you can come real darn close.  Avatar is a great movie to test that system with and it definitely lives up to expectations.  Grab your popcorn, grab your big-as-you-want soda, feel free to talk back to the movie, pause, rewind, and totally enjoy the experience.  This movie pops off the screen in crisp vivid color.  Oh yeah, it's like that.",1372204800,,531,4.866666666666666
3930958,5,B002HEXVUI,"While I'm not a huge fan of the story (Pocahontas, anyone?), this version is truly the benchmark for immersion into a movie.  The 3D experience is superb without making you duck.  You just watch the movie unfold around you instead of on a screen in front of you.

The sound is equally solid.  For non-animation, this really is the standard that you'll hold your 3D experience to....",1372204800,,382,4.656716417910448
3930959,5,B002HEXVUI,I didn't see this movie when it came out but was looking forward to viewing this on our new 3D tv.  How alive and creative!  Simply amazing and entertaining for the whole family.,1372204800,,178,4.363636363636363

3930962,5,B002HEXVUI,"Love this movie. I am a sci-fi nut and this movie hit the target in just about every single way with me. Definitely in the top 3 for best movies imho. DTS HD Master Audio is phenominal on a good surround system, combined with the 1080p picture and visuals, I don't think this can be beat in the quality of the content. The extra's in the collector's edition are great editions to behind the scenes looks and author/director mindset. Space Sci-Fi / Other Planets, Advanced technology, Romance, Compassion, and the fact that it frames humans in the perfect light of what we could become on both the good and bad side makes for a truly awesome story, as well as deeper meaning and thoughtful reflection on our species as a whole. James Cameron and James Horner hit a grand slam with this one, I hope there is more in store.",1372032000,,820,4.473333333333334

3930966,3,B002HEXVUI,"I mainly bought this Blu-Ray because I wanted to see how the Samsung TV  handled 3D - it was OK, not spectacular, but you could see depth in the 3D.  Later I bought ""Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey""  and this one had ""eye-popping"" 3D.  The movie was sorta Ho-hum but the 3D was great.",1372032000,,282,4.264150943396227

I realize that 3D TV's have pretty much flopped but I still would do it again. What is needed is for the price of the videos to come down and use 3D more often when filming these movies in the first place. The selection of 3D movies is limited at best and there needs to be a lot more of them.",1371859200,,414,3.8255813953488373

Strip the visuals away and you have another same old formula movie and not even a good one among those.  If you have 3D you need to at least rent this as it is pretty impressive, even without 3D the blu ray is pretty impressive.",1371772800,,322,3.984375

3930983,4,B002HEXVUI,"Rating is for 3-D effect.  Did not care for the show.  Bought a 3-D TV not realizing how few shows would be made in 3-D and those that are made are either children movies, sci-fi or violent movies.  Good 3-D movie was Titanic---movie was not only good so was the 3-D effects.",1371513600,,275,4.25

3930997,5,B002HEXVUI,"The effects and lighting and colors along with a good story line played by good actors pull one into the movie; which come more to life in clear Blu Ray 3D. I bought it when it first came available to buy and paid $89.00 for it. I really struggled with myself deciding whether to pay that much for a movie, however regardless how it sometimes pains me when I think of the money I would have saved by waiting to buy it, I actually have little regret over it because I have been able to enjoy it longer and share the enjoyment and awe with other with this classic film.

3931020,5,B002HEXVUI,"This review is for the 3D version and I have broken it into two parts, the film and the picture quality.

The Film
-When I first saw this movie in the theater I was truly blow away by the epic scope of the story and the concept of as whole. While the story is not original, no story really is, the execution certainly was and it is an extremely entertaining film. James Cameron is an epic film maker and that's what this film is in every way.

The Picture Quality
-This is by far the best 3D film I have watched on my television and really what I would call reference quality, even better than The Avengers, which is saying a lot. Even if you are not crazy about the film you need to own this to fully appreciate your 3D television.",1370476800,3,732,4.147887323943662

3931024,4,B002HEXVUI,I like the premise for the story line and where it takes place.  The CG was done really well and interesting conception of animals and other creatures.  Fun stimulation for the eyes to watch.  I think most people would enjoy this as a casual relaxation.  Leaves with a good feeling that the good guys win over the evil doers.,1370390400,,325,4.4576271186440675

3931028,5,B002HEXVUI,"Lets face facts, Avatar is a standard cliche movie depicting the hero's journey from misfit to great warrior. Originality and plot aren't the strong points here. Where Avatar shines is in the breakthrough special effects that have undoubtedly been a historical turning point in the film industry for 3D and CGI technologies. The only way to facilitate the breathtaking visual and audio experience of this film is on the crystal clear 1080p quality of  Blu Ray and this set delivers what it promises!",1370044800,,499,5.0120481927710845

I know that this is a great movie, and wanted all of the great imagery and colors as clear as possible. This Blu-ray version of this movie really delivers that, (and yes the credits at the end are also much clearer). I don't have a  3-D transformer box, so I can't give my comment on this, but if you want an absolutely stunning verson of this movie, then this Blu-ray version is definitely worth purchasing.",1370044800,,545,4.45

3931037,5,B002HEXVUI,"While the storyline is somewhat familiar, it was done in a spectacular style that was colorful  and fast moving. On the moon Pandora, the earth military has invaded, seeking an element they find there. A young marine, crippled in an accident finds that the death of his brother has given him a pass to this strange planet to take part in a program his brother had been involved in prior to his death. The Avatar being he assumes has given him the ability to leave his wheelchair, but because he is on active duty, he finds himself embroiled in a plot to infiltrate the home of the people on this moon called the Na'avi, to learn about them in order to find their weaknesses because the element the company is seeking is directly under their encampment. On his first foray out he gets lost and is saved by Natira, who was intending to kill him until an omen stops her and she brings him to her people. he does learn and finds out what his own people are planning to do. It is then that he chooses sides although he finds himself frustrated until he finally realizes he must become a legendary being by conquering a creature known as Last Shadow and rallying the tribes and the entire moon to fight a terrible battle against his own people who are determined to kill them anyway they can.",1369785600,2,1286,4.4261603375527425

3931063,3,B002HEXVUI,"This is one of the most beautifully filmed stories ever. Unfortunately, the story is old and especially weak in this telling.  The opening of the story is fine and has some unique qualities:  A crippled soldier has a second chance to experience working legs through a mind transfer into a tall alien on a distant planet.  Then real problems start:  Humans are there to mine the rare element, ""unobtanium""?! Not funny.  It floats in air, but the humans want the motherlode that is buried under the natives' sacred tree.  There are mountains of the stuff floating in the air that could be mined without disturbing the humanoid natives, but that would eliminate the conflict that moves the story.  The evil military and industrial partners decide to destroy the sacred tree and kill the natives.  No moral dilemma here for them.

The visual creation that is the alien planet with its wild species is fantastic. It's too bad the story is abominable.  Worth watching once for the beauty and the pain.",1369180800,,995,4.8

3931076,5,B002HEXVUI,"I originally saw Avatar a couple of years back, when all the silly protest by LGBT groups AND religious conservatives arose due to how popular the movie was.  Quite frankly, as a member of the LGBT population and a minister, I don't get what all the protests were about, since what was being protested had nothing to do with the movie, the story or plot, the characters, etc..

As for the movie itself, James Cameron created a masterpiece.  The story quickly becomes familiar, a technologically advanced culture invades another, less advanced culture, and the advanced one is willing to commit genocide to insure ever increasing demands for more profits.  Despite the fact this type of plot has been already done many times before, Cameron manages to keep the story interesting and entertaining.  Then he throws in some of the best animation I have ever seen (on par with Final Fantasy: The Spirit Within), and gives an all to familiar and tragic reality indigenous people face (and have for centuries), and gives it an interstellar scifi fantasy spin.

The movie is rated PG-13, due to graphic war violence, some sensuality (between the two main characters, it's fairly tame when compared to what is on TV, kids probably see more such behavior with their own parents), language, and because one or more characters is smoking (I hadn't noticed the last one, but I guess it happens).  The graphic war violence, to my thinking, would be the main reason to think twice before letting younger children watch this one, a decision best left to parents.

When I first ordered this one, I overlooked the fact that it included a 3D Bluray version, which I can't play anyway.  Given how spectacular the movie is with regular Bluray, I can only guess that the 3D version must be even better.  Some day...  LOL  I decided to give the DVD version to a friend.

Anyway, whether you are a fan of scifi fantasy or not, this movie is very well done, with an excellently told story and spectacular animation, graphics, and special effects.  This one is an excellent addition to any movie collection.",1368576000,5,2081,4.792717086834734

They were not in the normal ""crispy"" plastic a new movie is wrapped in as normally seen at Walmart. This indicates I am getting used movies and not ""new"". At least Amazon shipped overnight to replace the Hulk blu-ray. Amazon told me they did not have any more Avatar collector's disk and I could refund or wait. I attempted the refund and the website procedures indicate that I must cancel the second shipment. No clear procedures for refund.

3931107,5,B002HEXVUI,Avatar is an astonishing achievement in film making unlike anything ever created before. James Cameron and the hundreds of creators who worked on this film managed to accomplish what seems impossible with Avatar. Its legend by now that this is the most expensive movie ever filmed. It also took more than 10 years to make. The film is an absolute jewel of creativity and glorifious visuals that go beyond any movie in history. George Lucas and Peter Jackson with their mammoth creations have never done anything this incredible. The massive scope of this production seems unbelievable to comprehend. This is a monumental masterpiece that has to be seen to be believed. How it didn't sweep the academay awards is mind boggling to me. This is simply one of the greatest movies ever created. If I could have given it 10 stars I would have. Simply astonishing movie making!! A solid production that escalates way beyond anything Cameron has ever done before.

3931111,5,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron is one of the most successful directors in the world a prime example of his expertise, Titantic one of the highest grossing movies of all time. He spent close to three hundred million dollars on the film and as I walked into the theater I did not know what to expect. Per usual he delivered a ground breaking film. This film takes place on an earth like planet named Pandora where a private military force hired by miners invade to acquire a valuable resource. This movie pure entertainment, it provides several Go Green and Anti-war/American insinuations  throughout the film as well as being a technological masterpiece. Cameron used many different lighting, 3D, and storytelling techniques never before seen. My favorite aspect was that he never sacrificed story for action. Each character was important even in the final battle and what happened to them was just as vital to which side won. It became the highest grossing film ever made. So I would say that Avatar appeals to just about any movie goer.  The acting was not spectacular but, the effects definitely make up for it. I originally saw it 3D in theaters but when recently watching it on Blu-Ray 3D I was just as satisfied as I was in the theater. Plus with over eight hours of bonus features it is a must have for any movie collector. The collectors cut offers a new intro to the film, that I thought was even better than the original. I give this film 5/5 stars. More info on Avatar 3D at [...]

I was super excited that this set came with a DVD that had a ""Family Audio"" version with what they call and this is quoted from right on the box...""ALL objectionable language removed."" So I guess objectionable is relative.?? Because they did a fantastic job editing the really bad stuff, I was impressed (3 stars for that), but Hell's and Damn's are in there and when you sit down with your family expecting that ALL objectionable language was removed, and they say...hey that's a bad word and hey they left that one in. I was hoping for better when the box promoted ALL. I am disappointed that those words weren't deemed objectionable on the Family version.

3931151,2,B002HEXVUI,"Armed with the 3-D glasses I was set to love this as the last film I saw Sam Worthington in, he was great.  He's good in this too.  However, the excellent cast, great idea, magnificent WETA work were ruined by a dreadful approach to the dialogue.  I could feel Sigourney Weaver choking on her truly ghastly opening scene.  As well, did nobody think of how awful it is to label the villain as poor old Uncle Sam (who has taken a beating lately)?  Why not clearly depict (not just 'announce') that the miners were a motley crew of guns for hire from all over the world?  Men (for there were few women) who would do anything for a buck (though what they would spend the money on beats me.  Apparently Earth was already cactus.  Nothing was made of their motivation to succeed at all costs - money wasn't enough of a storyline here as the malls were probably closed in the USA.  I know there's a message about the trees and ethnic, unfamiliar populations but it would have been made so much better had the other details been eerier, more suspenseful and not just a predictable mash-up of baddies Vs. goodies.  The 3-d is really good, haven't watched all the extra features yet but I will.  James Horner's music (complete with the rallying 5ths of the hunting horns in the battle scenes ....errrrrrrrr) was, well, probably what he was briefed to do.  But honestly, I don't see it edging the Brandenbergs of Bach off the great dinner music charts.  The closing credits song is very forgettable. The animation is spectacular and beautifully conceived with intriguing plants, trees, mosses and floating mountains.  Loved that.  However, I like my films with story and character and actually, the reason it took me so long to see this film was that I had a feeling Mr. Cameron's mark on this story would spoil it.  I can almost see the crew whooping over their corny jokes and high-fiving as they watched the rushes.

We all loved the movie. It has a great theme and kept us all captivated.

The extended version explains how he lived in the beginning and I feel that it was important enough to be added to the theater version to begin with. This movie did so well that they are already making avatar 4. Two and three are already made. But to me I am thinking this is the same damn story as Pocahontas and the settlers.

3931174,4,B002HEXVUI,"The creators of Avatar created an entirely new world for viewers to visit and enjoy. It was obvious no expense was spared (except one, but I'll get to that) in the making of this movie, as some of the scenes are simply breathtaking.

Here's the gist of the movie: A group of greedy humans are trying to take over a planet because it houses an extremely rare, and in turn valuable, material that will make them rich. The natives of planet Panem are not too keen on having someone visit their island and steal their precious materials while destroying their way of life in the process. One approach to settle the feud between humans and natives is to send in people who control Avatars, devices built to look like the native population. Think if Jane Goodall decided to live with the apes by living inside of a mechanical ape. Somewhat the same idea, only these are controlled remotely from a device that resembles a tanning bed.

Most of the people who control these Avatars are scientists, interested in studying the natives and learning their ways. This is sometimes counter to the more militaristic approach of the mercenaries who plan to take the materials by any means necessary. It's your basic good versus evil battle, mixed in with a ""what side are you on"" for those controlling the avatars. Keep in mind the natives have done nothing to provoke having their land attacked. They are simply defending themselves from the outsiders who are trying to take over by force.

My one major complaint with the movie involves the scenes with avatar and human interaction. It seemed so much time was spent on making everything so majestic, but a lot of these scenes looked extremely fake. I kept thinking back to the movie ""page master"" which tried to tie in animation with real life. It was a cool thing to attempt, but it only worked to a certain level. This is how I felt watching some of the Avatar scenes. Maybe they needed to do more work when the avatars, natives, and/or humans were together on screen. Maybe the technology is not yet far enough advanced to handle this. Still, this aspect of the movie was quite a disappointment.

I personally enjoyed the story line, graphics, and characters of this movie. I would possibly watch it a second time for the visuals and soundtrack, but then lose interest after that. It is one of those movies you have to see once to understand what everyone is talking about. Then in 10 or 15 years, play it again and laugh at how bad the effects were but remember with fondness how great they seemed at the time.",1365984000,,2550,4.610132158590308

3931184,4,B002HEXVUI,"Amazing from a technical perspective and all in all a pretty good film. As a Marine I did not like the idea of portraying Marines as invading a planet for its resources. Surely put a bit of an anti military and anti American twist on things. I am sick of it always being the fault of the military, but then it would not be an adventure to tell the tale of the civilian control that sometimes sends our forces on missions that have little or nothing to do with National defense!!!",1365724800,,479,4.274725274725275

It's hard to explain how tremendous the difference is, how much more, how complete the Avatar saga is in this edition.  The theatrical release really is the crib notes version.  Avatar makes so much more sense, is so much more joyous and triumphant a tale in this version.  The best thing you can do for yourself is to get this, give yourself an evening to enjoy this show.  Don't think it through, don't think it out... just do it!",1365465600,2,653,4.734513274336283

The ground breaking technology he used to make this movie a reality has raised the bar several notches, setting a new standard for movie makers to strive for.  It was stunning and mind blowing in the theater when it was released, and now that you can do the director's cut in 3D at home with this version, it is even better.  There is a sequel in the works, and I predict it will surpass this one.  This rates a 10 star but they only let me give it 5!",1364947200,,589,4.043103448275862

3931212,4,B002HEXVUI,"I did enjoy this DVD as much as I enjoyed the 3D version on the big screen. This is supposedly the ""Collector's Edition"", and contains bonus scenes; however, I watched the whole thing without seeing a scene that I didn't (maybe mistakenly) seem to recall from seeing it in theaters. Considering that this Collector's Edition is spread out over two discs, the hassle of having to take out Disc 1 and insert Disc 2 halfway through the film is not really worth the unremarkable bonus material. Unless you're dying to see the bonus scenes, I recommend going with the theatrical version, especially considering that I couldn't tell you what scenes in the Collector's Edition were not in the theatrical release after watching. Go with the theatrical version: it's cheaper and isn't divided up into two parts on two separate discs.",1364774400,,824,4.892857142857143

The swearing is really annoying - makes the characters look like uneducated jerks.  This movie has no class.,1364169600,2,262,4.7555555555555555

3931232,3,B002HEXVUI,"I absolutely love this movie but I gave the 3D release only 3 stars. After watching the extended cut version on blue ray, which I own, you can't go back to watching the theatrical release again. The movie is so much more complete and more comprehensive in the extended form. For example you see Jake on earth and he is revieled as a man that is in his heart a defender of the downtrodden when he comes to the rescue of a woman who is being abused, although she does not appreciate the act.
In the theatrical release they never really explain how Natiri knows English. The extended cut give you more background into how Grace taught English and we learn that Natiri's sister was killed by the humans. That is why when we first see Natiri she draws her bow and is ready to kill Jake, until the sprite intervenes.
Shortly after Jake learns to fly his banshee, he says ""I was a stone cold hunter"" It never made sense in the original release, until you see the extended cut because the line comes after a very dramatic hunting sequence where Jake and Tsute both kill massive stermbeasts from the air riding their banshees.
There are several other extended cut sequence that make the film more enjoyable and fill the story holes from the original. The extended version special features has some scenes that did not make it into either release. There are a few scene that explore Norm and Trudy's relationship, including a bed scene.
Bottom line, I don't think the 3D version is worth it if you have not seen the directors extended version yet. See the extend version first and then if you really must, then get the 3D version it's only 20 bucks after all.",1364169600,2,1649,4.5
3931233,5,B002HEXVUI,I just wish I had a 3-D TV. I would love to see this on the big screen of a movie theater again. I find myself getting so absorbed by the surroundings I don't want the movie to end.,1364169600,,181,3.6666666666666665
3931234,5,B002HEXVUI,"This movie was even better than when we paid to see it in a movie theater.  3D is amazing. We don't usually like watching movies more than once, but this an exception!",1364169600,,167,4.21875
3931235,5,B002HEXVUI,"Excellent 3d...would have been even better if they would have included the extended director's cut versions. Too bad, so sad.",1364169600,2,125,5.3

3931238,3,B002HEXVUI,"Watching thts movie is a feast for the eyes.  Absolutely stunning.  It is a wonder they didn't put any money into the script.  The lead character never sells me.  Well, not totally true, I buy he is a selfish narrow minded jarhead.  I just never buy he changes.  His interests do, that is all.  I also have to agree, it is a bit old, to have the outsider be the savior again.  Thank god for us being there for all the natives. A bit tough to watch for those two points, but other that, an enjoyable movie, and again, the eyes will love it.",1364083200,,539,4.115384615384615

3931240,5,B002HEXVUI,"Quality was really good.  3D effects were a little less obvious, but there were parts where it really stood out, especially some flying scenes and when the ash from the burning was falling.  Same movie as the 2D, no editing.",1363996800,,224,4.575
3931241,5,B002HEXVUI,This is the number one 3D movie of all time (money maker).  It has great visuals and a pretty decent story.  I enjoyed seeing it in the theater and at home on my LED Samsung.  I recommend it for anyone who likes action movies.  Good Flick.,1363910400,,239,4.130434782608695

3931243,3,B002HEXVUI,"Found it annoying that they split the 3 versions (original, extended, director's cut) into Parts 1 and 2 on 2 separate discs. Spoils the movie experience to have to stop and change discs for the 2nd half of the movie. Why would they do that?",1363910400,,241,4.377777777777778
3931244,5,B002HEXVUI,Paid $20 for the 3D movie.  Clean and crisp.  Can't wait for part 2!  You should pull the trigger on this.  You will not be disappointed.  I know I wasn't ... What more can you ask for especially for $20!?,1363910400,,205,4.025

3931249,5,B002HEXVUI,"I've never truly appreciated 3D until seeing this movie on my brand new Samsung 65"" Smart TV at 240Hz.
It is UNBELIEVABLE to see the level of detail that went into shooting, cutting and optimizing this film for 3D. I gotta tell you my hat is off to James Cameron for realizing the importance of catering to 3D, considering that this was really a project which began 12 years ago. He knew that the audience he attracted would really appreciate this brilliant display of colors and clarity in a whole different dimension. It almost makes you feel like you're on that planet.

Anyways, in a nutshell: For the $20 bucks (give or take) this disc will set you back, I guarentee it to be a crowd pleaser for any party or gathering whereby you need to entertain. Or even for yourself, if you like this kind of stuff, you won't be disappointed with this. Remember that this is coming from a guy who couldn't care less for movie theater or IMAX 3D movies as I've never really found them to be very 'dimensional'. I don't know exactly what it is, but this TV in my home shows much better 3D than any movie theater I've ever seen (probably has to do with the fact that the 3D technology is different & glasses are battery operated).

A definite buy.",1363824000,,1237,4.421052631578948

3931272,5,B002HEXVUI,"Plot was nothing new and a bit touchy feely ah-la kind of like American Indians in harmony with nature before the European invaders showed up and made a mess of everything sort of genre, but it takes place on a distant world that the dying human race is exploiting for natural resources to keep what is left of planet earth on life support and pissing off the native population in the process.",1363392000,,393,4.472222222222222
3931273,1,B002HEXVUI,"So let me just go on record saying the movie itself is excellent. It has a great storyline and good cast. However I bought this product from Go Hastings and the quality was awful. I don't understand why anyone would sell a movie that is all scratched and doesn't even play properly. Ultimately, the movie is worth buying, just be careful who you buy it from. :(",1363392000,3,361,4.402985074626866
3931274,5,B002HEXVUI,"I loved this movie so much I watched it in 3D Imax and regular 3D. Actually I enjoyed the regular 3D much better. I bought this set as it was a great 2 set deal and to test out my new 3D Samsung TV. If you loved the part where the flower of Ava Tree come together on Jack the first time and they float towards you too then you will love this TV version of Avatar 3D.

Hope that helps.",1363392000,,384,3.740740740740741

3931276,5,B002HEXVUI,"Originally I saw the movie in 3D at the theater and like everyone else was blown away by the new technology and the story, so when I the saw the movie again after a few years, I was not disappointed, the home theater 3D experience was almost as woowing and my whole 3D glasses family, enjoyed it as well. James Cameron is not only innovative and a creative director, but a great storyteller as well. Arguably the best movie in a decade.",1363392000,,436,4.329268292682927
3931277,3,B002HEXVUI,"I love the movie Avatar. It get's 5 stars, but this stream wasn't in HD, I didn't think that was possible, since it was actually filmed in the newest and highest quality of HD. So the stream version gets 3 stars",1363392000,,211,4.170731707317073
3931278,5,B002HEXVUI,"Glad this finally came out in an affordable package.  The cover's holographic image adds a nice bonus for collectors and if you're into 3D, what better movie to immerse yourself into?!",1363392000,,184,4.935483870967742
3931279,5,B002HEXVUI,"Ok. So here's the deal. Yep, still a great movie. And yep, the 3D looks good too. The only down side is that there are ZERO special features. So if you're torn between the 3D version and the DVD version that's all pumped full of special features and extra scenes and what not, just know that the 2012 3D blu-ray has nothing extra. It's just the movie (oh... and some sort of PSA in the settings menue that I didn't bother to watch...).",1363392000,,435,4.253012048192771

3931281,4,B002HEXVUI,I watched this movie when if first came out on blu-ray without 3D and for some reason I couldn't get into it. Everyone said it was great.  I now own a 3D tv so I bought this and it is a fantastic movie for 3D.  Not the jump out at you 3D.. more the show you the scale of certain areas.. looks fantastic .. LOVE IT,1363305600,,313,3.727272727272727
3931282,4,B002HEXVUI,Good movie if you can excuse the story rehash . Graphically this is one of the best films out there. James Cameron's use of CGI to suspend disbelief is amazing he is the king when it comes to creating a believable world. In 3d it's excellent!,1363305600,,242,4.282608695652174
3931283,5,B002HEXVUI,I am a sci-fi fan and this movie rates right up there with Star Wars.  Wonderful special effects especially in 3D.  What a movie should be and that is totally entertaining.,1363305600,,172,4.516129032258065

3931285,5,B002HEXVUI,We bought this for our collection of movies and bought it as a present for my son and his family that live out of time.  The color was so vivid and beautiful.  Anyone who buys this movie will enjoy it for years to come.,1363219200,,219,3.9545454545454546
3931286,5,B002HEXVUI,"This movie is beautiful.  People have complained about this movie's story, but it doesn't change that this is a great piece of movie history.  A lot of advances were made to 3D movies and Computer Graphics.  Having all the special features the explain this is very nice to have for any avid movie goer or critic.",1363219200,,312,4.535714285714286
3931287,1,B002HEXVUI,"Well, sort of: I checked the Amazon Prime listings for new movies, saw Avatar there, and started watching it. Turned it off after about two hours, intending to finish watching it the next day. Found out the next day that Amazon wanted $12.99 to finish watching it. Was Avatar listed as free by mistake? Dunno. The situation reminds me of the ""Friends"" episode where they were getting ""free porn"" on their TV and were afraid to turn of the set lest they lose it....

As for the movie, while visually spectacular its plot elements seemed extremely derivative, I can't say much more because I haven't seen the ending.",1363219200,,614,4.685185185185185
3931288,1,B002HEXVUI,Very poor quality. Why make this or sell them if they don't work. I bought a lot of things this time and had to return half what is going on with the quality of Amazon?,1363219200,,168,3.8285714285714287

3931292,5,B002HEXVUI,This is a timeless story of good vs evil.  It draws the viewer in quickly and doesn't let go.  I love the 3-D version. Special effects and costumes are amazing.,1363219200,,160,4.3

With.",1363132800,,117,4.0
3931295,5,B002HEXVUI,WOW. When it first came out I was not even interested in seeing it. Then it showed on TV a few times and I only caught bits and pieces of it. So I rented it and totally feel in love with it. I bought the DVD for the house and I bought it and downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire HD.,1363132800,,279,3.5901639344262297
3931296,5,B002HEXVUI,The 3D version of Avatar is an excellent movie to watch. My wife and I enjoy the movie in blue-ray but enjoyed it more in the 3D version. We saw details that we didn't notice in the blue-ray version. A must for 3d collection,1363132800,,224,4.113636363636363

3931302,3,B002HEXVUI,Loses appeal without the 3D. All of a sudden the plot seems Dances with wolves the science fiction edition. Loved Sigourney Weaver though.,1363046400,,138,5.043478260869565
3931303,5,B002HEXVUI,"This movie is a classic.  Great price, fast shipping and both dvd and bluray/3d copies. I was looking to start my 3d collection for new flatscreen.",1363046400,,147,4.653846153846154
3931304,5,B002HEXVUI,"I don't usually buy 3-D or even Blu-Ray dvds because I'm more interested in the substance and plots of movies and don't know anything about the technical differences that a lot of reviewers seem to be concerned about. Some of my favorite films are oldies but goodies in Black & White but when I saw this one when it first came out at a movie theater I knew it was really going to revitalize the 3-D motion picture production that has been languishing out there for a long time. The special effects and colors are absolutely amazing and even if the story sucked ( which it didn't) this movie is worth seeing just for them. I purchased a 56 inch, HDMI/3-D ready TV  last year in anticipation of buying a copy of it when it become available and I have not been disappointed. It's true a living room as small as mine isn't the same as watching it on a big movie theater screen with surround sound and all the other bells and whistles but I can watch it over and over from my comfortable LazyBoy Recliner any time I want to and it is still an extraordinary experience. Every thing is smaller but the realistic feeling of being there in the midst of things is phenomenal. Scenes that make you think you are on the edge of a precipice or looking down from a great height make my stomach knot up like it would if it was really happening. Amazon's price finally came down to a point where I could afford to buy the DVD. When it arrived I was a little leery of opening the box because it says ""Promotional copy-Not for resale"" on the cover and I was almost afraid it would be a bad copy or something would be wrong with it like being dubbed in a foreign language with non-English sub-titles but it plays very well and I am quite pleased with my purchase. Buy it, you'll like it!",1363046400,,1768,4.293413173652695
3931305,5,B002HEXVUI,"This is a great movie.  The screen play and special effects are very convincing,

We have a Sony 3D T.V. with the interactive glasses and have bought around 10 3D movies to watch here at home.  Some make my nauseous (mostly the cartoons) and the rest are OK.  Avatar blew them all out of the water....now this it how a 3D in-home movie experience should be!  I forgot my glasses were even on.  If you only buy one 3D movie - this would be the one to own.",1362960000,,467,3.9148936170212765

Prometheus left a lot to be desired. John Carter was ok, but not enough 3D to either on of those two. Avatar was really nice 3D.",1362960000,,277,3.9642857142857144

3931310,5,B002HEXVUI,I never wanted to see a movie about blue people until this one came out in 3D at the theaters.  Then I had to have the blu-ray but it was very expensive.  Glad the price finally came down within my reach.  The effects are a great addition!,1362960000,,239,4.042553191489362
3931311,5,B002HEXVUI,"I saw this in theates with the passive (no battery) glasses. Loved it. Ordered it and saw it on my Samsung e8000 plasma 51"" TV which uses Active glasses. Wow, so much better than the passive glasses in theatre experience. If you want TV for movies and some PS3 Games, you will love this TV. The only downside is you cannot order these movies seperately, they all come with the DVD version, so more expensive $25-$35 dollars typically. Not sure why you can't just buy the 3D version, but all the ones I have purchased have both DVD and 3D Bluray versions.",1362960000,,554,4.4411764705882355

As a matter of fact when it comes to the ""special effects"" they look so horrible that they look just like animation.  As in cartoon.  As in I did not know I was going to watch ""The Song Of The South"".  This is a total scam.  THESE ARE NOT GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS!!!  EVERYTHING LOOKS FAKE!!!  And yes I saw it in a really splendid theater with 3-D.  Still a failure of epic proportions.  Its is also an environmentalist film which is total b.s.  Read a book.  This is for the illiterate.  It is also propaganda for bashing people who serve in the military.  I dispise this film and everything that it stands for.  At the end of the day it will be you all's loss...NEGATIVE STARS not just zero because of the downright corrrupt manipulation of the viewers and consumers/customers.",1362614400,2,895,4.575949367088608

It is my understanding that this movie was created for a promotion of the Panasonic 3D TV and if you don't have a Panasonic you are ourt of luck.  You would think there is a compatibility list out there but I have not found it yet.  I don't understand how a manufacturer can expect to charge you more for the 3D movie and not claim on the Box what the compatibility issue might be.  I am sure they know.  Sounds like a class action lawsuit to me.  Buyer beware ... do your research, that is, if you can even find anyhing.",1362528000,,661,4.077519379844961

3931346,5,B002HEXVUI,"What can I say, the storyline is not as good as it could be, but the special effects are fantastic.  Very enjoyable movie.  The special effects come right out into your room. I felt I was in the picture at times.  Beautiful effects. Glad I bought it.  The best 3D I have seen.  I will watch over and over again.  I just love the effects in this movie.

PS:  You must have a 3D bluRay DVD or you will not get the special effects. You would be suprised how many people do not think of this.  Your DVD BluRay player should be the same manufacturer and compatable with your TV's specific Model. Be sure that you have the correct manufacturer's glasses for your model TV. (Not generic that say you can use it with XYZ TV for 3D)  There are different glasses for different models of TV's from the same manufacturer.  If you have samsung, Everything should be Samsung, TV, DVR & Glasses for that specific model of 3D TV.  Do not let a salesperson who wants to make a sale, tell you different.  They will do anything to make a sale.  Read the DVD box carefully make sure it is compatable with your TV, same with the 3D glasses.  Read, do your homework.  Everything must be the same brand and compatible to the TV model. I could not get great 3D.  I was using the generic glasses that work with XYZ TV.  Good picture but just enhanced HD.  I got the matching 3D DVR for my TV. Much better, but not worth all the hype.  I got the glasses that match with my TV and magic happened.  I am convinced that you must have everything that matches your System to get the best picture.  PS, I also got a bose system for sound, the speakers in the flat screen TV's are not great.  Just like the movie theater and I can sit around in my jammies.",1362355200,,1723,4.201834862385321

3931374,5,B002HEXVUI,"Others have provided you the run down of the good and bad of Avatar as a movie and its Plot.
this is going to be from the perspective of my wife who had not seen Avatar at the theater or at home on blu ray or DVD.

this was watched on an LG 60"" Plasma, LG 3D player, at night with a really good surround sound system.

She loved the colors and how the 3D was used to bring the viewer into the scenes. she said she could not imagine watching this in blu ray and getting the same experience. She said she felt drawn into the CG scenes but the more ""Human"" type scenes in 3D just weren't as good. For someone who doesn't like battle scenes she like how this one used 3D to entice the viewer to be drawn across the screen to a variety of perspectives especially the flying scenes. She noticed things I had missed and brought them out.

It wasn't necessary to have people wait this long for such a revolutionary film (3D perspective) just to satisfy their hunger for money in my opinion.",1361750400,,982,4.157894736842105

3931385,1,B002HEXVUI,"Frst off i was under the impression i was ordering a blu-ray copy because thats what i had clicked on after i searched Avatar Blu-Ray. But, I had also ordered this movie new when I received it the outer cover was not sealed and the inner cover which holds the dvds looked as if it was re-sealed. I wanted to return it already after i realized it was not Blu-Ray but the kids wanted to watch it so I ignored it. Well I take the plastic wrapping off the inner cover and look over the inner box cover and its damaged corners are dented in the bottom section is peeling apart. Now im really P/O but once again I ignore it put disk 1 in it skips twice put disk 2 in to finish the movie it skips once. So now i really beleive i was sold a used copy and told i was purchasing a new copy. Also the way this version is set up is so stupid Disk 1 and 2 are the movie disk 3 is all the special features. You put disk 1 in it ask you theatrical, extended or bonus version you watch the first half then you put disk 2 in ask you once again theatrical, extended or bonus. Why wouldn't you make Disk1 theatrical Disk2 extended Disk3 bonus and divide the special features between the 3 now your movie experience is not bothered half way through. Still one of my favorite movies just would not buy this version or from this provider again.",1361577600,,1322,4.088461538461538

However, when I opened the shipping packaging I found my several problems.  1 was the sticker residue on the DVD sleeve.  Personally, I like the artwork and packaging on a DVD as much as the DVD itself, and I'm sure I'm not alone on this.  2, one of the two clasps on the actual case was broken so the case does not close properly, making it rather difficult to put back into the sleeve without destroying the edges and just overall a pain in the butt because the case should snap shut and it does not.  3, when I opened the case, one of the discs was actually out of it's holder.  That can probably be dismissed to shipping, but still it's annoying because I don't know if that happened to damage the disc in any way.  The disc does play excellent but the packaging was unacceptable.  The seller informed everyone the item was in ""awesome condition"".  This is not the case.

The copy I ordered from Amazon arrived swiftly, much sooner than I expected, and is just as beautiful on my big screen, 3D TV as it was at the theater. This package also came with a regular Blu-ray Disc, which is also beautiful, but personally, I prefer the 3D version. You can't go wrong with the set or the price.

3931427,5,B002HEXVUI,"The movie that brought 3D into the twenty first century and started a 3D revolution in the movie industry, directed by James Cameron - the man who brought you the Titanic, which was only available as a bonus through the purchase of 3D Panasonic plasma TVs, is now finally available on Blu-ray. Award winning special effects studio, Weta Digital - responsible for bringing Middle Earth to life in Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, returns to bring you awe-inspiring 3D effects and probably one the finest 3D movies ever made.

The story revolves around the hero, played by Sam Worthington, who is paraplegic, replacing his brother as the link for an avatar developed by a conglomerate bent on an exploration to extract a precious rock embedded beneath the scared tree of the Navis in the distant world of Pandora, and having Sam, animated in the form of his avatar, attempt to persuade the Navis to relocated so that the company can level the land and begin to drill for the precious commodity.

However, the Navis, refuse to move from their native homes and are drawn into a battle with the armies of the conglomerate, and witness the devastation of the native homes through violent bombardment of their homes; they, themselves, nearly defeated by the army forces until Sam calls upon Aeywa, the life force that interlinks all sentient beings and elements of nature in Pandora, which the Navis can tap into, for help, thereby, culminating in one of Hollywood's most exhilarating battle sequences ever captured on film.

The Navis finally prevail, and the movie ends with Sam, who having his life force being transferred to his avatar and relinquishing his human form, and his new found race expelling the humans from Pandora.

For an anti-war movie that constitutes an allegory for the Iraq war, it ironically relies heavily upon elements of war, not only as the climatic finale of the movie, but also to render the movie exciting.

James Cameron is entitled to his own misguided tirade against the Iraq war.",1360886400,,2013,4.857142857142857

I would give it five-stars except for the obvious Dances With Wolves comparison -- or ripoff -- depending on how far you want to take it.  I watched all three versions... the longest extended version is obviously the one to watch.  I can see re-watching this movie once a year or two years.

Where is this feature?

The other features in this box are excellent, such as the process of how they made the movie (while not directly tying to individual scenes such as a commentary would do), the artwork, and the rest.

3931508,3,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is a movie based on a paraplegic ex-marine that finds life on a distant planet called Pandora. Once life is discovered on this distant planet, the ex-marine finds himself battling the humankind from the planet called the Na'vi. The ex-marine must battle and win over the tribe in order to be able to set up his mega-corporation that his slain twin brother had started. The mega-corporation was looking to mine the planet of Pandora for a valued ore.  The biggest deposit of the valued ore, lies underneath the home of the Na'vi. Since the planet has such a hostile environment the ex-marine along with all the other scientist there to mine the valuable ore had to genetically change their bodies to look and act like the people of the Na'vi, to try to win over their trust, and to be able to protect themselves from the hostile environment of the Na'vi. The ex-marine is able to win over the tribe and even meets a beautiful princess by the name of Neytiri. After meeting the princess, becoming one in the tribe, and finally beginning  to understand the secrets of the tribe,  the ex-marine has to decide which side he will take when the day comes for the battle of Pandora.
Avatar relates to world religions because it is about indigenous people who live for their land. Everything on the land of Pandora is connected and they have firm beliefs that everything including themselves, the animals and the plants all have connections with each other and their beliefs. Also in order to be part of their tribe on the planet Pandora, you have to be part of initiations and take part of daily rituals. By doing all of these things you then become part of the planet Pandora and part of their tribe. Pandora has its own indigenous people, ways, rituals and initiations, just like any other religion that lives off the land and for the land.",1359244800,,1841,4.641104294478527

Grace and her team have a genuine plan to study the Indigenous tribe, but the head of the RDA is looking for a very valuable mineral, and will stop at nothing to get it. Grace and her team are asked to take on the form of the Na'vi using Avatars to look like them. The Na'vi are very Religious and have very sacred ways. After Jake reveals what he's really there for, they feel betrayed and don't want anything else to do with him. By this time he's fallen in love with Neytiri and the Na'vi, and he doesn't want to betray them but they don't want Jake or Grace there anymore. The RDA attempt to move in but the Na'vi plan to fight to protect their land, as well as Hometree where they dwelled and the tree of souls, where they believed their dead went; To be with their Deity Eywa. Jake and Grace(Dr. Augustine)were used by the RDA to try and get the Na'vi to leave their dwelling place, and because of their greed they didn't care who they had to hurt to get the minerals they were after. The Na'vi weren't this Religious sect who were trying to force their ways or beleifs on anyone, they were simple in their everyday lives. This kind of thing often happens to the Indigenous. They are often in the possession of great wealth, be it land or minerals and there's always someone out to take advantage of them, not considering their sacred beliefs or religious beliefs. And in some instances people will come in the name of religion to get what they want from the Indigenous. Needless to say there was a great battle between the special forces of the RDA and the Na'vi. Jake won the Indigenous over and helped them fight against the special forces and they won. In most cases today the Indigenous don't win.",1359244800,,1849,4.425219941348973

This is only political because every damn movie, no matter how good the construction and execution of the movie MAY be, seems to be designed to just show how intoerant we are unless we could only be as tolerant as the INTOLERANT left. No other view is possible if you would be deemd to have a RIGHT to exist.  Witness this human hired to do a job that, if he did it as he was supposed to, everything would have turned out okay. But what does he do, he follows his heart, falls in love with someone from another species, embraces this and repudiates his own humanity as repugnant to him. They in turn embrace him, not for his differences, but rather his ability to lose himself into there culture as superior to his own. Sounds nice , except it shows an intolerance in the the ones who scream intolerance so that we all must go along to get along. I believe in humanity and not socially-engineered automatons.

From my perspective the extended version should have been released in the theaters, as it adds a great deal to the production. So if you you are a fan of Avatar and want an even fuller experience than the theatrical version, these are for you. The reproduction is very clear, and when played on an up-converting DVD player it is darn close to Bluray.

The Amazon price was the best I found, and when I had a problem with the first set I received (The Disc 2 was faulty and wouldn't play), they sent me a new set even before I got the return label, AND they paid for the return shipping.

3931544,4,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is a science fiction film, set in the 22nd century. The movie takes place in the far away land of Pandora, which is rich with a mineral called unobtanium. As miners pursue the opportunity to further explore the land and its precious stone, the territory of the indigenous people, the Na'Vi, becomes threatened. As the Na'Vi struggle to preserve their homeland, a war is waged that will force everyone to decide how much they are willing to sacrifice to get what they want.
Avatar is as visually stimulating as it is emotionally exhilarating. Writer and Director, James Cameron, has created a film that reaches out, grabs you, and pulls you into the screen. Pandora's beautiful landscape is filled with majestic creatures that are pure surprises to the eye. Yet, somehow, this mesmerizing land isn't distracting from the plot; the scenery only adds to your interest to follow the characters and engage with them.
Avatar is a great representation of the struggle between the indigenous people and the technologically advanced, even as it takes place in present day. The Na'Vi believe in a spiritual connection to nature, and go to great lengths to train in the ways of respecting the land, and ultimately pleasing their spiritual deity. The direct connection they feel with their land is what makes it so painful to have foreigners come into their space and try to push their own agendas. During the movie, you are torn between the interest in seeing the miners succeed in their ventures (surely the economic growth that could come from exploration of Pandora will create benefits for the whole world), and the desire to see respect for nature trump personal gain.
It is this same struggle that is occurring between global religions and the indigenous. There is a clash of culture that can be damaging, but if both groups will take the time to really ""see each other"" (a term used in the film to express seeing someone's soul), much can be gained from the exchange of knowledge and experience. The book ""Living Religions"" highlights the collaboration that has occurred between old and new ways, lending to such religions as Buddhism (8th ed, p. 39). This is a great example of two cultures coming together rather than tearing each other down, as is depicted in Avatar.",1358726400,,2273,4.891191709844559

Quality of the blu-ray is awesome.

The story is great and everyone i'm sure has read about it already, but to add on to anything you may have read you will get involved in the characters and have ones that  you are pulling for through the whole movie.  Everytime I watch the movie I wish they would put out a sequel, because it's just that great your going to want more at the end.

3931591,5,B002HEXVUI,"This is a great movie on all accounts, 3D and 2D!
When I first got my 3D Panasonic TV (2011 55GT31) a version (3D promotional disc only) of this movie came with the TV.  I played the 2D version in my old theater setup (2008 LG Plasma and Sony Bluray player) next to the new 3D setup (55GT31 and Pana Bluray player).  3D brings a whole new appearance to the movie- The flight scenes are realistic, the crowds of people look like a crowd of people.  Incredible movie to tryout your new 3Dtv (same with Despicable me, Lorax, IMAX under the sea movie, and many other newer movies.) Keep in mind that the Avatar promo disc (sold with TV's) was selling for $60 to $120 each on ebay and craigslist. So apparently someone was out loving and buying 3D movies then, and many more are now.
If you have had a bad experience with 3D at home, chances are that the TV was not setup for an optimal 3D experience, or it was a low end model with low end glasses (flicker and ghosting); And that also includes the setups at Best Buy- They crank up the TV with Vivid modes and has too much ambient lighting, that ruins the experience in my opinion.  You have to watch 3D movies more than once to gain an appreciation for 3D. I compare it to the difference of SD DVD's and HD Blurays.  Try a different manufacturers tv and glasses.  True, TV broadcast versions on Directv is not the greatest yet, but is still fun to see what is filmed in 3D.  I do not plan to watch Dora on TV, in 3D anytime soon.  We do watch at least one 3d movie per week (many good ones release all the time) in our house hold.

The cost for 3D has dropped dramatically to make it work for all of us. You just have to buy smart to get it, as with anything in life.  I don't buy the  $36 version from Target.  Typically, I will buy my 3D discs from Amazon, under their preorder deal, and sometimes with Best Buy, which works great to get it at a great low price on the day of release.  I can usually get the 3D disc from $20 to $30 from this deal (usually $24). It comes with many multiple versions of the movie (3d, 2D-bluray, digital, UV, maybe DVD too).  Keep in mind that the ""just released"" 2D version is typically $23 - $30. If you wait till after the Preoder special, then it does go up to $33 or so, for the good movies.  GREAT DEAL from Amazon.

Great 3D movie to go with your new 3DTV movie collection.  GET IT !!!",1357862400,,2374,4.126086956521739

3931603,2,B002HEXVUI,"Cameron did a great job of portraying his vision of an alien world, but the story quickly becomes predictable in a particularly unsatisfying way.  I won't spoil the ending here, but I should note that the movie seems intended as a vehicle for heaping scorn on capitalism and the military.",1357603200,2,288,4.76

3931605,2,B002HEXVUI,"I enjoyed the movie and look forward to watching all of the special features included with this movie.  However, I am not impressed with the packaging.  There is a cover to remove to get to the box that holds the DVDs.  The DVDs are contained in a ""book"" where the pages are what holds the DVDs.  This sounds cool and the artwork is beautiful.  But everything is paper--the cover, the box, and the book.  Oh and the DVDs pull out of the ""pages"" and you unfold more paper to get to the DVD.  This is a lot of work for people who just want to watch the DVD.  The book that goes into the box is a very tight fit and then the pages that actually hold the DVDs get unfolded and folded each time a disc is needed.  This almost makes me want to look for another container in which to store the DVDs and use the box for display purposes only.  Granted everything that's made of paper is thick paper, but none the less, PAPER.  I was hoping for something that would last a while and would hold up to a lot of use and still look cool.  I'm giving two stars for the sustainability/longevity predictability of the packaging, but FIVE stars for the movie and all of the talent that it represents.",1357516800,,1183,4.208888888888889

That being said this story moves along very quickly and the graphics are absolutely amazing. I got the HD version and have a 40"" screen that will support it but the colors are so vivid, the contrast so amazing it is breathtaking even for the sophisticated viewer. Definitely worth the price I paid to make it a keeper.",1357516800,,526,4.377551020408164

3931611,4,B002HEXVUI,"I bought this movie strictly for the 3D effects since I already have the Special Collector's Edition. The 3D effects are much better than most other 3D Blu-rays I've seen (I have Cars 2, The Avengers, Captain America). I've been extremely disappointed so far with all the so-called 3D Blu-rays. They are mostly 2D to 3D convertibles and so the effects are not very pronounced. In these cases it's better to save your money and go for the regular Blu-ray, instead of the 3D version. It just a dirty trick the studios are using to charge extra for 3D Blu-rays.

Avatar was originally shot in 3D, so naturally their 3D effects are much better. However, if you were to use IMAX 3D Blu-rays (the ones that most Electronics stores use to showcase their 3D TV sets) as a standard, then this Avatar 3D Blu-ray comes up a bit short. Not by much, but still short. For this reason, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's much better than most 3D Blu-rays out there, but still doesn't quite compare to the 3D IMAX Blu-rays.

As a side note, if you like 3D Blu-rays, check out Jet Li's Flying Swords of Dragon Gate. The same guy that did the 3D effects on Avatar also worked on this movie. IMHO I think he did a better job on this movie than Avatar.",1357516800,,1241,4.344827586206897
3931612,5,B002HEXVUI,"I bought this a few weeks ago but only recently had time to watch it.
All I can say is wow.
This is one of the best looking movies I've ever seen on my Samsung 55"" 3D television.
I don't want to go into much detail regarding the movie itself since almost everyone has already seen it or at least heard about it; I mainly just wanted to throw my 2 cents in regarding the 3D aspects.

The 3D rendering is fantastic. Obviously nothing will compare to IMAX but this is about as close as you can get in the comfort of your own living room. This movie was made for 3D. The colors and just the scope of the sequences filmed on the alien planet are set up perfectly for 3D.

Overall I think it was fantastic and I highly recommend it to anyone who has a 3D television; you will not be disappointed!",1357516800,,790,4.090322580645161
3931613,5,B002HEXVUI,This is by far the best 3D I've seen in Blue-Ray. The effect was extremely good on my LG 55LM8600. Except for screen size it was every bit as exciting as in the theater release.  When Avatar first came out I was convinced that it broke new ground in the proper use of 3D to enhance a movie and this DVD confirms that opinion.,1357516800,2,325,4.078125

3931617,5,B002HEXVUI,"I installed a 3D home theater in my basement... So I guess I had to get this movie, right? I had never seen Avatar before, and really had no desire to... Just did not seem like my kind of movie. I purchased this on 3D blu ray in November of 2012, and still did not watch it for nearly a month. When I finally did, I was very surprised. I actually did like this movie, and have watched a couple more times since. I cannot imagine how they were able to film some of the scenes with existing technology, but somehow they did. Plus, the 3D is spectacular. I ahve 10 3D titles so far, including the Avengers, the Lorax, Brave, I Robot, How to Train Your Dragon, Titanic, and others, but this one is by far the best. I guess I have to agree, that if you have a 3D theater, this is a must have movie. For this I gave 5 stars... For Prometheus, I gave only 1, and that was being generous.",1357344000,,880,4.034285714285715

3931619,5,B002HEXVUI,A three disc collector's edition set for the price of a regular single disc edition. A breakthrough movie experience combining state-of-the-art CGI with live action. An exciting story with an important underlying message to all of us here on Earth.,1357344000,,248,5.225

3931625,5,B002HEXVUI,"I was blown away by the transfer of this movie to 3D Blu-ray.  I watched it on a Samsung ES8000 3D LED TV and could not have been more impressed.  The story is OK, but the 3D visuals are reference quality.  Great sense of depth and a feeling of immersion into the film.

When you want to show off what 3D TV can do - use this disc.",1357257600,,331,3.823529411764706
3931626,5,B002HEXVUI,"I'm going to assume you've seen the movie already (as it seems nearly everyone has). It's worth watching in Blu-Ray, if only for the additional visual quality. The Ultra-Violet digital component to the movie is nice - I like being able to watch movies on my iPod, iPhone, and other devices even without buying them on iTunes.",1357257600,,325,4.719298245614035
3931627,5,B002HEXVUI,"This is for the 3-Disc DVD Extended Collector's Edition. I have not even watched either of the two alternate extended versions of the film yet, but even at that it is worth five stars, and can only get better. This set is beautifully contained in a slipcase hardcover book-style package. As someone who loves real, tactile objects, I like this very much, and feel compelled to put it on a bookshelf or something. One other nice thing is the availability of an alternate ""family friendly"" audio track that is sans-profanity. That is a rarely seen but very nice, inclusive touch.

There is really not much that I could say to add to what has already been said about this film. In terms of the official Amazon product review above, I am one of those people who sees the characters as, ""broad, useful archetypes."" Yes, the plot is simple, relatively unsurprising and not a story that hasn't been told before. And yes, the message is very overt. But it is all executed clearly and concisely. So many films that I have seen lately end up as train wrecks of convoluted or unfullfilled thematic ambitions. I realize that for some people, Avatar's very deliberate method and occasionally blunt-force symbolism (""unobtainium"") are not the ingredients of a great film. For me, though, it is a very powerful story that is told very effectively.

The other element, of course, is the visual one. I do not know if I have ever seen anything so incredibly awe-inspiring. Beautiful, gorgeous, ominous, obviously otherworldly. This is a film where James Cameron and company went all-out to create the most immersive sensory experience that had ever been onscreen. This is something completely different from a standard ""effects blockbuster"" movie. Even the music is perfectly in sync to the environment. And the greatest beauty is how it all serves the story. These aren't visual effects for the sake of saying, ""hey, look what we can do."" It's all story driven and for me it is captivating like nothing else.",1357257600,,1991,4.852941176470588

These names are among the classics of Sci Fi and will be remembered as long as there are people who watch movies on this planet.

Avatar is an absolutely beautiful retelling of invading somebody else's homeland and attempting to take what they have by force.

However, it does not work out well this time for the invaders.  Yay!!

This movie stirred truly deep emotions in me and that's all I have to say about that.

I do not buy very many movies on disc, but this is one I had to have because I will be watching it for the rest of my life.

""Avatar 2"" will deal with the Indians being forcibly relocated to reservations without the possibility of creating casinos.

Too many 3D movies are intended to startle the viewer for no particular reason, other than to exaggerate violence, and to prevent you from realizing how mediocre or bad the movie is.",1355702400,,287,4.333333333333333

3931740,5,B002HEXVUI,"One of the advantages of living in the era of digital technology is the creative use of it in filmmaking.  James Cameron has directed the realization as film of another world that is visually and emotionally gripping.

The three-dimensional showing (especially in an iMax theater) of Avatar was unlike anything that I (as a 72 year-old movie lover that was born and raised in Hollywood) had ever experienced: the terror of ferocious, exotic animals. the thrill of mounting and riding flying reptiles, the sweaty palms of runs along fragile pathways at great heights, the mystical wonder of a huge, and apparently conscious tree that centered all living things and was the spiritual heart of a race of ten-foot-tall blue humanoids. Who else could have done this?  It is a wonder, and we should be grateful.

At the same time, the story is a transparent parable of exploitation: of native people by White, western invaders driven by a quest for profits at almost any price, and accompanied by (morally compromised) scientific explorers who are more interested in these other sentient beings than in the objectives of expansive and exploitive industry...yet all too willing to lend their scientific skills to the purpose of their sponsors.

As in our earthly history, a few resisting heroes defended the natives.  Except that in this (imaginary) story the heroic resisters actually succeed in helping to liberate them.

The movie is both tender and violent.  Delicate, floating seedlings find their way to the skin of our hero and ""anoint"" him as a deliverer of Pandora, the habitable moon on which the action takes place.  He learns to mount and fly a terrifying and enormous dragon-like creature that has mythical power and meaning for the Navi'i.  He is now both anointed and ordained to lead them in a great and violent rebellion against his fellow-earthlings who have invaded their home.  And he ultimately joins them through the transmission of his identity (""soul""?) from his crippled human body to the Avatar Navi'i body that he has temporarily inhabited by means of human technology.  And, of course, there is tender romance, which is portrayed with a quality and a depth that evokes empathy in those of us lucky enough to watch this movie.",1355702400,2,2246,4.991957104557641

  I received this item about a WEEK before expected or posted, which was great. When I first watched it, it skipped a few chapters... so, at first I was not happy. I didn't want to return the movie, due to the fact that the return shipping would cost as much as I paid for it. So ~ I thought I would be stuck with a defective dvd.
  **However, when I contacted the seller, and explained what happened; (that it looked perfect, and would still skip despite cleaning and trying other dvd players,)
  The seller contacted me immediately, apologized, and informed me that they had ALREADY sent me a new dvd when they received my message, and not to worry about trying to return the previous skipping dvd, that they understood my predicament.
  I would DEFINATELY recommend this seller (and dvd) to anyone and everyone I know. You can't beat the service, a lot of sellers would be more worried about the money and not the customer, and would want the item back before anything else was done. I LOVE IT!

3931778,2,B002HEXVUI,"I have a lot of problems with this movie. Let that be said. So I'll start with what I DO like, since the list is much shorter. The graphics and animation are amazing. Some of the best in the industry. Okay, now let's get to the bad. ""Wait that's it? One thing you liked about this movie?"" I hear you ask. Yes. This movie is very disappointing. I'll go almost as far to say it's pretty close to being considered bad. My biggest issue (and a lot of other peoples') is that the story has been done to death. Please, no more. Romeo and Juliet captured that story the best and each time the story is revisited in some other skin, it lessens its impact. Avatar is blight upon animated movies. Not only did they steal the name of a much better story (The Last Airbender), but the way the story is presented is just downright boring. Not once did my opinion of this movie go above mediocre, the entire time I was watching it. One of my biggest pet peeves when watching movies, reading a book, watching a tv show, etc is feeling like it was forced to go on longer than it should have. Lord of the Rings was 3 and a half hours apiece but never once did I feel like it should've ended an hour earlier. Avatar, on the other hand, should've ended after about an hour and a half. There was a point in the movie where if it ended there, I could've given it 3 stars and said ""Okay, that wasn't terrible, but I'm glad it's over now"". But no. Just as I'm about to take the DVD out, the movie keeps going. And going. And I sat through it...another hour. I thought the movie had to be over any minute, and after that point I just wanted it to end. I can't watch a movie halfway, I want to see the entire thing. And I almost wish I turned it off when I originally thought it was over. One last thing I didn't like was the world and the characters. BO-RING! The blue cat people definitely failed to catch my interest. The world was not very unique, but like I said the graphics were phenomenal, but by the same token I feel we've visited this planet before in another movie.

Okay so maybe I was a bit harsh on this movie. It's not terrible. If this was the first movie you've ever seen, then good for you. You might actually enjoy it. But the story's been done to death. The characters are very forgettable, the world is uninteresting, it overstayed it's welcome, and what really confounds me the most out of everything is the fact that this is the new highest grossing movie of all time. No way did it deserve it. Absolutely no way. I watched this movie only to see what the hype was all about, and walked away very unimpressed. Do I recommend seeing this movie? Sure. If only for the beautiful graphics. But don't expect anything groundbreaking (despite what some people might tell you)",1355011200,,2767,4.270476190476191

3931786,5,B002HEXVUI,This movie was made for 3-D. It doesn't call attention to itself. You just feel like you're in the movie.

I go $12 back.  Really, come on really.  On the receipt I got back , there was a fee for this and a fee for that, and oh by the way another fee for this other thing, and so on....

3931849,3,B002HEXVUI,"I preordered this because i knew it will be awesome. And it was. The execution is fantastic but the story is so last year that it hurts my brain. You could simply put the characters into 21st century and give them some weapons and fast and furious cars and there you have it. The tree could be some building and sleeping cocoons could be some drug or similar.
Well i simplified it a lot but you get the picture (pun intended). I have to admit i saw it only once. I would really like to watch it again but i cannot make myself doing it.",1353628800,,535,4.104761904761904

I also enjoyed the featurettes.",1353542400,,360,4.918032786885246

3931857,5,B002HEXVUI,"I am an avid 3D fan when it is done right and used to enhance the images and story line. Avatar seems to fulfill all those requirements for me. It has taken the better part of 4 years for the release of Avatar in 3D. Prior to this, Avatar was released in Blue ray, and rereleased with different packaging. Was this a marketing ploy to milk every last penny of Avatars popularity with viewers and fans? I believe so. However, that does not negate the fact that this film is nothing short of amazing in 3D. I viewed this film originally in Imax 3D and was floored! I am no less impressed with this version of the film! It's been a long time coming. If you can watch 3D for an extended period of time, then I would highly recommend experiencing this film in it's originally intended format.",1353369600,,787,4.324324324324325

Well worthy of the cost.

Only regret is the disc has no extras at all. I understand the price is for the 3D, but insteadof aan additional disc with the movie in 2D I'd of rather gotten an extras disc.

I think the beginning is the total best - the battle at the end keeps the guys entertained - but for me the sections when they run at night thru the forest are so much like scuba diving that I could just rewind and watch over and over again. It's a good story (not new, not surprising, but so beautifully filmed), and the quality of the visuals - in 3D or just even in regular DVD mode are so high that it's worth buying to show off your system.",1353196800,,514,4.099009900990099

Later I bought the best version of the LG 3D I could find which is awesome I might add. Having the means but not the player, I got the matching LG Bl-ray 3D player. The first movie I bought was Resident Evil Afterlife and was blown away by my first Blu-ray movie which was also my first 3D movie. Fast forward a couple of months and Avatar Blu-ray 3D is released and I had to have it. I got the 2 disc version that has the 2D and 3D both HD on one disc and the regular original version disc. I WAS BLOWN AWAY watching one of my all time favorite movies in HD 3D! If you have not experienced Avatar in 3D you are missing out on a whole new experience! It is like watching all again for the first time. I was totally pulled in and felt like I was part of the action. If you are thinking of getting a 3D setup and are a die hard Avatar fan, go for it and you will not be disappointed! The days of just looking at a movie are passing and being part of the movie will be the norm.

So every time I wanted to watch the movie, I had to get up and put in the 2nd dvd right in the middle of the movie. Can anyone say, ""DUMB IDEA??!!""

Overall,
any 3D effect that is done to a movie like this (no matter how little) is always going to enhance the experience....",1352505600,,495,4.166666666666667

There is nothing different, rumour had it, that Cameron was going to put some of the added scenes in from the: ""Deluxe 2 disc set"" into this release for added pizzaz!

I still love the movie (Huge Fan!!), and the 3D just brings the whole thing to life, don't know if I'll still be around when the releases of part 2 & 3 are to appear (apparently 2014 & 2015 respectively)??

My suggestion for Mr. Cameron, release a version with the extra 6mins included (a 50Gb 3D Bluray disc is capable of taking the extra minutes).

3931914,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar 3D really does shine and shows just how deep a movie in 3D can take the viewer.
The thing I really admire about this release is just how tastefully the 3D is pulled off. Their is a great field of depth,with just enough pop out scenes to really dazzle your senses. Their is no doubt that Pandora has never been more alive,than when witnessing it's beauty on the 3D format. If this renaissance of 3D continues,I can't wait to see what film makers bring us next.

So what are the drawbacks if any?

Well despite how marvelous this movie looks in 3 dimensions their are a few things I think are worthy of nitpicking over.
First and foremost is the fact that a few sparse moments of this presentation are still 2D. Their not long shots,mostly close ups of Jake Sully in human form that last no more than a few seconds.

The next point may not apply to everyone but I'm still going to throw it out their. While watching this film in 3D I noticed the only color options my tv allows are standard and movie (vizio 42inch). I personally love watching this film in bright colors (Dynamic,vivid). The 3D more than makes up for this however,and I feel the pro's outweigh the cons in this department.

The final drawback comes with the PS3 controls. I can't use the square bottom to return to the main menu. Instead I have to press triangle, and open up the bigger menu to return. It's not a big drawback,but a small minor inconvenience.

In conclusion, Avatar 3D is I believe,the standard for 3D movies to come. It never tries too hard,nor does it have to in order to hook you in. The only movie, i believe that comes close to being an equal rival is Avengers 3D.",1352505600,,1658,4.387622149837133

3931935,3,B002HEXVUI,"I'm supposed to like ""Avatar"". Native rights, Gaian spirituality, even a whiff of transhumanism. The bad guys are suspiciously similar to the U.S. military and a multi-national corporation, hell bent on a resource war with accompanying genocide and ecocide. The good scientist is starred by Sigourney Weaver. Gorillas in the mist, anyone?

""Avatar"" must be the movie ""National Review"" and the Ayn Rand Institute love to hate!

Yet, I honestly didn't like ""Avatar"". I think I'm getting too old for cartoon characters. I admit that I watched it on TV. Perhaps the special effects really look great in a cinema, but on the TV screen the whole thing comes across as a Walt Disney movie with somewhat quirkier animation.

Besides, I just cannot help reminding myself that ""Avatar"" is fiction, even fantasy. The Natives couldn't defeat the settlers, Gaia isn't a literal goddess, a life close to nature would frequently be grim rather than romantic... If civilization collapses, the post-apocalyptic generations won't understand ""Avatar"". It will be seen as a positively weird cultural artefact of a by-gone (and more prosperous) age.

Both of the original purchases are great 3D blu ray movies and I recommend them to anyone that wants 3d enjoyment (plus I am a huge fan of the Avengers movie).  After owning Avatar Blu Ray 3d for over a week now, there is little question to this statement ""Avatar 3D Blu Ray is the benchmark for 3D home Entertainment.""

My wife is not a tech person and with 3d, you can be exposed to ghosting or cross talk which may turn someone off prior to engaging in a 3d movie.  Last night she watched Avatar with me and has an entirely new perspective on what 3d can offer.  Avatar is such a brilliant movie experience that you virtually have none of the challenges that plague movies that were not shot originally in 3d.  Additionally, Avatar shows promise of what 3d can be for future releases that come out.

I have to say, I actually believe this blu ray experience on my new Sony rivals the Movie Theater experience if not beats it.  The 3d depth and detail is one breathtaking experience after the next.  I am actually surprised at how impressed I am at the visuals.

If you own a 3d TV, the answer is simple, treat yourself to the ultimate 3d movie experience to date and hope that the Hobbit and future 3d blu ray movies can rival this masterpiece that James Cameron has given us.

My driver's license has since been revoked. The library took my card back. I'm not allowed to lift more than 10 pounds without another adult nearby.

1. This film is hard for me to watch because of many unnecessary ""dumbings-down"" of many ideas that all young people I know are capable of handling.
2. The film may be visually splendid, but since I watched it in the theatres in 3D, most of it was lost on me.  There is a good scene with a tree.
3. Ribisi and Weaver are delightful to see saying just-about-anything.  I know that he's good looking, but Worthington is neither convincing nor watchable... Just another dumb, disenfranchised jock blundering through an overwhelming plot, IMHO.
4. With all the advances in CG, why can't they get shading or physics consistent (if not correct)?
5. It doesn't greatly bother me that they hijacked plot points from very common sources... but it does bother me that some of the specific stolen sources are so weakly presented.
3. There is only one reason I bothered with this review, and that is: that it lifts some excellent points from Ben Bova's ""Winds of Altair"" (and Anderson's ""Call Me Joe"", among others)... which I think is an excellent young adult sci-fi read.  I am not convinced that the American audience can handle the staging or scope of Bova's text (though, I think most agile young adults can!)... so I am genuinely appreciative that Cameron (or Transformers-guy or whoever-made-this-flick) turned it into Pocahontas so that some of the important themes could make their way onto the big screen.

The fox fanfare plays in perfect 3D. The 3D in the opening shot seems muted, but let's keep watching. Jake's opening eyeball shot is next. Fine. Then we cut to the profile of Jake's eye...

Someone has made a terrible mistake...

The following shots, Jake shuffling in his tube and then looking up to see the droplet of water floating in front of him, and even the long interior of the space station are all wonderfully deep and dimensional.

Rewinding back to that profile eyeball shot, I begin to realize that the Left and Right eyes are backwards in this shot. (his far cheek seems close, his close cheek seems far away, almost as if his head is the interior of a bowl) If i switch my television's 3D setting to 'inverted', the shot is corrected. But only the one shot.

I have not progressed much further than a few dozen scenes to check if there are any other inverted mistakes. Nothing so far. But i've only viewed a few short minutes of the film.

I just cannot believe I've waited this long for the Panasonic exclusivity to finally be released, only to find out that it's got a glaring error in the first few seconds.

The fact that after three years we are given only a stripped-down version is ridiculous. Especially when a full extended cut will be made available in a few months.

As far as the acting, again, it was o.k. I enjoyed this movie much more as an experience, a visual and auditory action ride so to speak than as a ""film"" in any way. Many may disagree with my assesment in that regard however and that's ok.

So, I Watched Avatar in 3D yesterday for the first time and honestly, I think the studio made a huge mistake having an exclusivity deal with Panasonic because if any 3D movie was ever going to get people to buy into the whole 3D thing, this movie would have been the one. Not that the 3D thing needed all that much help I guess as many people who bought newer HDTVs in the last couple of years were force fed one 3D technology or another (active/passive). In my case, I had no real interest in 3D but last year when I was in the market for a new HDTV, it seemed that all of my potential candidates had the technology built in so I was getting it whether I wanted it or not. For those reading this review and that are interested in knowing, the T.V. used to watch Avatar 3D was my Panasonic TC-P55VT30 (professionaly calibrated in February, 2012 by Kevin Miller) and the disc player used was my OPPO BDP-95. I own a few other 3D blu-rays such as Kung Fu Panda 2, HUGO, Alice in Wonderland, Lion King and a couple of others but Avatar easily beats them all in the 3D department in my opinion. Although initially I wasn't really interested in 3D, my new T.V. had the feature so naturally I picked up a few 3D discs to check it out. The ones I picked up were supposedly some of the best 3D discs out there in regards to picture quality and the use of the 3D tech so my expectations were pretty high. Each of those 3D movies was good in their own right to varying degrees but I was never totally blown away by the 3D in any of them. After watching them all, I was somewhat impressed by how far the tech had come and I did take notice of a few standout 3D scenes in each of them but overall I was left a little underwhelmed. That would lead me to wonder if they were even worth always watching in 3D or if watching the (usually included) standard blu-ray would be just as, if not more satisfying somehow. My issues with them all (the 3D effect that is) to one degree or another was that they don't always look as pin sharp as the standard, non 3D blu-ray and all of them exhibit some minor ghosting in several scenes which makes the image appear a little blurry at times. Some of the ghosting could possibly be attributed to my TV's handling of the 3D or the disc player's output of it to be sure but either way, while they were enjoyable enough in 3D, I just wasn't blown away. Unitl last night that is. Avatar was a near revalation in 3D compared to my other 3D discs. There was some minor ghosting in just a few scenes and not every single scene was razor sharp at all times but overall this movie had so many visually beautiful moments in 3D that it really made a very strong case for the 3D genre. There were many scenes that were in fact very sharp, clear and with standout depth and dimensiality. Avatar 3D has great colors, textures and it finally gave me that wow factor I was hoping for with my other 3D discs. The 3D in this movie really brought me further into the story and even nearly made me forget I was wearing those goofy glasses just to be able to enjoy it. I don't mean to make it seem as though those other 3D movies aren't good when it comes to the 3D effect in each of them, that's not the case. They are good and there are a couple of standout scenes in each of them but I just wasn't truly wowed by either of them. I was more like ""Ok, that was cool, not bad"". but I did enjoy them nonetheless so I would say that compared to Avatar 3D, they're very good but just not truly great. Avatar 3D, so far, is the best 3D disc out there right now in my opinion. I'm really hoping more 3D movies will have this level of 3D ""rightness"" because when it's done this well, it is very enjoyable and you can't imagine NOT watching the 3D version. I give the movie 5 stars for the 3D effect but only 2.5 (maybe 3 at best) stars for the storyline which I added up to the 4 stars I gave it overall. ENJOY!",1350604800,5,4356,4.118683901292597
3931962,4,B002HEXVUI,"Well I guess everyone that's interested in the movie has purchased it by now and for the rest of you ""hold outs"" waiting for the price to drop down to $4.99, you'll have to wait a little longer or buy a used one. If for some reason you haven't seen this movie it's basically the same story line. Our main character starts off with a selfish agenda, meets the locals along with the best looking girl in the village, begins to sympathize with them and turns on his benefactors.
 If you like westerns that show both the Native Americans defending their land and the Calvary slaughtering them with advanced weaponry, you should enjoy this.
 This movie also points out the symbiotic relationship the natives have with the planet, everything is connected. Kind of like it is here in the real world, or could be if not for corporate greed. This movie shows that you can make anyone your enemy and justify war if they have something you want.
 The planet is beautiful and the creatures are magnificent, the special effects to me are well done.
 I bought the single DVD as soon as it hit the shelves, but after reading a few of these reviews, I may have to pick up the extended version.

3931963,4,B002HEXVUI,"I saw this in IMAX 3D when it came out original, so I wanted to wait for the basic 3D release on Blu-ray over buying the 2D version despite it being extended etc. This movie is one of the best 3D movies thus far, so I'd give it a perfect 3D rating, but I've had the basic DVD version since it's been available on iTunes, so I've watched it to death by now. It's a great story, but way too linear and when I originally watched it I knew what the ending would be about half way through at the theater. The production sets a new standard for motion capture techniques, but I found they used too much BLUE in the color pallet for Pandora. When I'm in the mood this will be a good time, but like I mentioned I've watched it so many time via the iTunes version It no longer excites me at all, even watching it in 3D now doesn't make much difference.

Like many have stated, unless you really want to see the original release version I'd wait for the extended edition with extras etc. This is just a bare bones original theatrical release with no extras whatsoever. Personally this is enough for me, I'm way over the greed of these director... they are milking these franchise releases to death and they apparently have no shame in doing so, Jackson/LOTR and now this... Harry Potter, etc on and on. Greed.",1350604800,,1299,4.302040816326531
3931964,3,B002HEXVUI,"So why 3 stars for a movie with really impressive visuals and special effect?

No argument that the special effects and photography in Avatar are really top notch and very impressive. There's also some pretty good acting in it as well.  But everyone seems to miss the fact that this movie is NOT original.  Original movies sadly seem to be something that Hollywood can no longer produce.  So many of the movies that are coming out today are simply inferior ""retreads"" of superior original movies from years gone by and Avatar sadly follows this disappointing trend.

Most may not know or remember that back in 2007, one of the first 3D movies to hit the theaters was an interesting animated film called ""Battle For Terra"".  Avatar copies the basic plot and main characters of this other movie pretty closely but obviously changes some things around to make it look like a ""new"" movie.  You have the ""ruthless"" humans who invade a peaceful world in order to exploit its resources and use it for their own purposes in spite of the fact it's already inhabited by a sentient and intelligent species.  In ""Battle For Terra"" at least the human's motivation for taking over this planet and terraforming it is a simple matter of raw survival for what's left of the human race.  In Avatar, it's the usual big, evil, greedy industrial military complex that wants to exploit the planet for a special, powerful and very valuable mineral regardless of what the mining efforts may do to the indigenous population and the ecology of the planet and regardless of the wishes of the inhabitants of the planet.

So the 3 stars are for the excellent special effects, especially in 3D, and the stunning scenery. But 2 stars come off for it being an unoriginal ""knockoff"" of another excellent film.",1350604800,,1776,4.755700325732899
3931965,1,B002HEXVUI,"Many others have already expressed this, but I feel that it can't be said enough, so; do NOT buy this bare bones scam job. IF you're like me, you stupidly assumed that the extended version of the film, along with all the extra making of materials would be included in the ""Limited Edition"" 3D Blueray version. NOT SO. That has been squeezed into yet another version that is only being released via 2D at this time, with the real-deal 3D super-duper deluxe extended edition to come out yet later (probably for Christmas). Well guess what Fox. I will NOT be buying it. In fact, I will go out of my way not to purchase any of your products ever again.

That being said, the 3D on this version is quite beautiful and even better than the theatrical release. I am glad to finally have the 3D version,(and yes, I couldn't wait and also bought the 2D Blueray when it first released)but this will be the ""definitive"" version for me.",1350518400,17,924,4.4674556213017755
3931966,1,B002HEXVUI,"Lets break down the release of Avatar for all to understand. The Avatar 3D blu-ray was eagerly anticipated by everyone who spent good money on a 3D system. Even with high prices, little content worth watching, and uncomfortable, goofy glasses we looked forward to the blu-ray release that put 3D technology on the map. First slap in the face, 20th Century Fox strikes a deal with Panasonic for an exclusive release of Avatar 3D. All you have to do is buy a Panasonic Blu-ray player or 3D glasses kit and a bare bones copy of Avatar in 3D is yours. What about people who already own a Blu-Ray player not to mention a better performer than Panasonic? Unless we spend well over $100.00 we don't have access to the movie. So we grit our teeth, and wait. Then what happens? Fox releases just the Blu-ray version of the movie to the public. For those who don't have 3D TVs, this release makes sense, expect once again, no additional features. No problem, Fox will just wait a bit and release another version of Avatar. This time, a wonderful 3 disc version with the extended movie and loads of extra features. This would be the perfect version to buy, except its missing one important detail. 3D! So we continue to hold off for many months and then the announcement we are waiting for. Avatar: Blu-ray - 3D for sale October 16th! The complaining would end here, unfortunately Fox just loves pissing people off. I go to buy the movie and discover it is once AGAIN, just a bare bones version. WOW, you couldn't just release the movie with the extra features that have already been produced. Even it if cost more at the cashier, don't you think people who waited for the 3D version would want to watch extra features that show how the highest-grossing, most technically advanced movie of all time is created? What's the likely response, ""Most fans probably own the 3disc version, you can simply buy this release and have it all."" Sure, I enjoy wasting my money by buying multiple versions of a movie. It's a complete waste of resources and unbelievably greedy on the studio's end. Even if you get this newest release, you still don't get the 3D extended version of the movie. We can't win. I'm sure yet another version will come eventually. The 5 disc, extended, multi-Platium, limited edition, collectors series with every feature under the sun. It will be glorious, and it only took three years to get it. Is it so hard to understand why people pirate movies and music? Fox, I would love to unleash a whirlwind of profanity laced commentary on you, but for the sake of not making me look even more pathetic than I already am, I will simply say I'm a grossly disappointed.",1350518400,143,2664,4.598739495798319

I wasn't expecting anything overwhelmingly spectacular (as was the case with every 3d movie that I currently own). Let me tell you this: this completely exceeded my expectations. This is what a 3d movie was meant to be. Each scene is well optimized and it looks as though  the movie's color was adjusted to compensate for the 3d glasses' darkness.

3931971,2,B002HEXVUI,"Poorly scripted, woefully derivative, with its strict adherence to tried and true aesthetic, predictable plot paradigms and run-of-the-mill character archetypes (from the fascist, sadistic battle hardened, pseudo-macho rhetoric spouting military commander and his scorched earth philosophy, to the protagonist's foil, usually a high ranking type that eschews miscegenation, that vies for the affection of the love interest and employs subterfuge when convenient), it's difficult to glean any merit aside from the obvious eye-candy factor. The film borrows heavily from a veritable host of sources (The Bible, The Gospels, the conversion of Saul, The Story of Pocahontas) and incorporates ideas already seen in such films as Dances with Wolves, Shogun (the mini-series), The Last Samurai, Equilibrium, Star Wars, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Matrix, etc. Avatar as a movie suffers from infusion of a variety of been there/done that plot/sub-plot structures: an emphatically embraced, albeit misinterpreted prophesy (why are there always a prophesy in these films?) provided by a(n always old) Shaman, a Christ-like protagonist (there's even a resurrection of sorts), successful infiltration of an indigenous populace born of duplicity on the part of the protagonist, empathy born out of desire (why are the love interests in these films always princesses or persons of noble birth?) on the part of the protagonist, an eventual appreciation for (always primitive) culture, an event or a series of events that clearly identifies the antagonist as the prophesied (taming of the Banshee/Leonopteryx?), an epiphany born out of internal struggles and morality complexes, a conversion and/or switching of loyalties, a profound revelation that either uncovers the protagonist's or belies his new-found intent, an attempt at reconciliation, technology/industry vs nature, faith in an unseen benevolent entity as the catalyst for victory, replete with religious overtone, and the list goes...Would this film be even half as critically lauded if it were made ten years ago, without all of the wiz-bang gimmickry?",1350259200,7,2106,5.688888888888889

Why did James Cameron have to ruin such cinematography with his trashed political message?

The back story that I keep seeing when I watch the movie is ""run away from reality, and make the bad people go away""...which isn't realistic, nor is it even portrayed as such in a Disney film.

A small adjustment on the story, and what is a 3-star film could have been a memorable 5-star movie, that could have spanned decades.

3931993,3,B002HEXVUI,"The war-driven plot may be a racy historical metaphor, but that's about as far out on an artistic limb James Cameron is willing to go. Everything else about Avatar; his first movie since Titanic; is safe and sound, often to the point of being clich; a fact its surprisingly stodgy dialogue and paper-thin characterization give away right from the beginning.

In a future world where Earth people fly to other places in search of mineral goods, a marine named Jake Sully infiltrates moon Pandora; home of a race of tall blue cat-people with long tails and braided hair. He does so with a team of scientists via the Avatar program, which allows them to live on Pandora as Navi creatures without really being there.

It's imaginative science fiction and the world of Pandora is a visual wonder. There are strange creatures, big and small, and awe-inspiring landscapes that sort of make you want to visit a place like that in real life. But the story; a mythological fairy tale based around eye-rollingly unnecessary themes of religion and romance; never lives up to the hype.

Be prepared to but it again or wait for the 3D extended director's cut. The, of course, will be followed by the Ultimate 3D Ultraviolet deluxe edition with Smellovision, which makes sense, because these quadruple dipping tactics really stink.",1347408000,39,382,5.383333333333334
3931996,2,B002HEXVUI,"Back in 2009 director James Cameron (""Titanic"", ""Terminator 2"", ""Aliens"") brought countless movie fans and people in general to the world of Pandora inhabited by a race of tall blue skinned beings named the Na'vi. They're a peaceful race who live in one with the land and respect it, so naturally they aren't too thrilled when a group of humans come to Pandora, set up base camp and have every intention of harvesting a rare mineral from the planet called Unobtanium. The higher up decide the best way to establish trust with the Na'vi is to have a few people have their minds put into Avatars (Na'vi engineered bodies that look exactly like the real thing).

Among these people are Grace (Sigourney Weaver, ""Alien"") and Jake Sully (Sam Worthington, ""Clash of the Titans""), Jake who as a human was paralyzed is overjoyed at having the us of his legs, soon after waking up in his Avatar he goes with some others to explore the rest of Pandora. Jake does fall for one of the Na'vi Neytiri (Zoe Saldana, ""Star Trek"") and a budding romance of course occurs. Everything wouldn't be all happy go-lucky unless there was a ruthless Colonel named Miles (Stephen Lang, ""Conan: The Barbarian"") who wants to destroy the Na'vi and take the planets resources at any cost.

The one big, big plus about this film is the visual treat that it is, the amount of detail Cameron wanted put in to the look of Pandora, the Na'vi, the animals that inhabit the planet and everything about the look and feel of Pandora was beyond top notch and the visual effects crew. Cameron and any others involved deserve all the credit in the world for the time and effort they put in to make these effects so good that they made special effects in many other films pale in comparison.

The problems however are plentiful, from the basic and predictable story, I mean everything could be seen coming from a mile away, the plot is basic and feels all too familiar even with the great visuals. The acting is good to just basic, I mean Lang is a good actor but is one note in his villain role, Worthington is a breakout star for sure as is Saldana, Weaver is decent I guess in her role, the rest of cast is okay for the most part.

Outside of the amazing effects I wasn't drawn into the movie, I felt very little if any attachment to the characters and while there are far, far worse movies out there for all the hype this received it's not very good. ** out of 4 stars, mainly for the visuals.",1347148800,,2453,4.46875
3931997,4,B002HEXVUI,"I related the Na'vi people as being indigenous people. They live amongst themselves and cherish the natural world as it is without desire to have more material goods. Marine Jake Sully is a paraplegic marine who decides to accept participating in a mission in a distant world called Pandora. Later he finds out that Parker Selfridge, a rich but greedy authoritive figure is going to ""Na'vi"" in order to mine for the precious material scattered throughout their rich woodland. Jake will get the treatment he needs to restore him to walk again if he agrees to go to Pandora in the avatar disguise to get close enough to gather the precious material in the woodland. Unexpectantly Jake quickly falls in love with a beautiful alien named Neytiri. Jakes will have to fight inorder to aggressively get this material but he now has growth to love this beautiful new world along with Neytiri which causes him to questions his loyalty in order to decide what he should do.",1347148800,,963,4.772455089820359
3931998,5,B002HEXVUI,"My first ever review - despite buying over 2300 DVD's and blu-rays from Amazon...

When I first bought the 1-disk blu-ray and watched it on my 73"" Mitsu DLP, I had to watch it again back-to-back! It was SO beautifully made, with so much imagination going into Cameron's production design. It all worked together - the Na'Vi, the flora and fauna of this strange world, the floating mountains, the plants lighting up when touched,the sheer beauty was stunning. The mountains - floating and otherwise - streams reminded me of a Roger Dean Yes album (big vinyl CD, played with a needle) cover, and the Na'vi warriors - particularly the women - reminded me of Boris Vallejo drawings. I can forgive the 2D characters. Rabisi is a GREAT sleazy middle manager type, Selfrige is set as strutting badass who loves killing more than his own life...

I already own the 3-disk extended blu-ray and a Chinese import 3D theatrical cut - after seeing the 3D on HBO on-demand I had to have the disk, so I paid $66 on ebay.

I've since bought a 65"" Samsung 3D, after my Mitsu died, and - even at this smaller size -  the 3D makes a big difference.

I will buy the new extended cut 3D, since I like the added footage, and love the 3D.

Cons: Unobtanium - REALLY? He couldn't come up with a better name?  VERY hokey-sounding!
Should have had the hookup via their tails, not braids - just too many questions: haircuts? can only wear a single braid, are they born with the braid?",1346803200,,1457,4.496212121212121

3932003,5,B002HEXVUI,"I loved this movie! Yes, the story may not have been the most original out there, but it was a well done story nevertheless. Emotionally, it was a grabber. Visually, it was stunning. Technically, it was created by leaps and bounds into new technologies that hadn't been tried before. As many times as I've watched it, I never fail to be moved by it.

I was one of those who rushed out to buy the film when it first came out. Two years later, I bought the extended BluRay version and I'm thrilled I did. Watching the actors create these characters with the use of minimal props, seeing the stunt work that went into creating the humanoid movement of the Na 'vi, the blank canvas that was the studio ... everything about the production end of the movie gave me a much greater appreciation for what the movie did accomplish.

Bashing? There are those who find great pleasure in tearing apart. They will find fault no matter how great a film or show might be. These people have no understanding of what goes into the production of a film, especially one of this capacity. I don't hold much sway wiith their criticisms because very little of it is  constructive.

3932005,2,B002HEXVUI,"I had not seen this movie until 8-12. I was totally disappointed.  Ignoring the fact that it is obscenely overpackaged, the plot is totally predictable.  In this future why is the ""corporation"" totally dependent on the military to defend its mining?  Have humans learned so little about eological balance over the years needed to reach another planet?  Are all sentient beings we encounter in the universe to be exterminated? The characters are stereotypes, and not good ones at that.  The CG action did not look natural (Cameron should take some serious lessons from Peter Jackson).  The ""bonuses"" are worthless.  There are some beautiful scenes but I find more beauty in our real world.

One viewing is enough for me.  Don'waste your money on this set.  Wait until you can buy the entire movie on one disc in a more traditional plain package.",1346284800,3,844,4.880281690140845
3932006,2,B002HEXVUI,"As much as I enjoy Cameron's visionary take on his films I'd have to say that Avatar is not his best work. In my opinion the storyline for Avatar is very, very similar to Dances with Wolves so I give Cameron a 1/2 point for originality. And honestly, Titanic was much more engaging for me than this film. Oh sure the 3D and special effects are without question cutting edge but that's about it. I can sit through Titanic many more times than I ever would though this lazy pile of artwork. Cameron should have given screenplay credit to Michael Blake. If you don't believe me compare the two films and see for yourself. On second thought Jimmy don't give Michael any credit. It surely must be an insult to take his wonderful novel idea and pepper it with flat, one-dimensional characters in some quasi-political correctness message.",1346284800,2,831,4.659863945578231

I mean it was still entertaining, but let's take the blue chick that helped the main character throughout the film.  Initially she is an independent woman of sorts that behaves as if humans are beneath her...by the end of the film she's riding on the back of the main character's dragon Harley like some sidekick cheerleader.  ""Unobtainium,"" really?  And the entire scene when the humans take down the tree...yikes; keep the 3D glasses on and savor the experience!",1346025600,5,756,4.674242424242424
3932008,5,B002HEXVUI,"I have watched Avatar three times now - the first time the 3D version in the theaters, the second and third times the extended collectors 2D version on this three-disc set.

To paraphrase Nigel Tufnel of Spinal Tap, I have concluded that this movie really goes to 11.

In my opinion it may be the greatest science fiction movie of all time, surpassing even 2001, Blade Runner, and Star Wars.

Avatar is stunning to look at and listen to, it is moving and exciting, and it carries an unmistakable message about the sins of imperialism.

I also disagree with those who think that the script is wanting. Though there are no memorable quotes here as in Casablanca, the story points are well-thought-out and the script conveys a world of exposition in a very efficient and economical manner.

The acting is also very fine, both of the humans and the Na'vi, with a special nod to Sigourney Weaver, Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Giovanni Ribisi as the requisite corporate scumbag.

Finally I must also commend the remarkable score by James Horner. In my opinion the African-inspired music here equals or surpasses anything composed by John Williams or Bernard Herrmann and adds greatly to the movie's impact.

What can I say? This is a science fiction film for the ages, and there are a good number of compelling reasons why Avatar has become the highest grossing film in history.

For those who lack 3-D televisions and Blu-ray players, this three-DVD collectors edition set is the way to go, with a disk of extra features on the making of the film.

Now, Avatar was under exclusive contract, the 3D version was only available with Panasonic 3D TV's (hence it not being for sale immediately) instead they did two releases a theatrical, followed a very short time later with an extended.

Now, the question is, is there going to be an extended 3D or not? Do we buy the theatrical before the E-Bay hoarders get every copy to re-sell at twice the price once the stores sell out (see the word ""Limited"" on the box?) or do we shell out the $30 now and then grit our teeth and do it again when and if the extended 3D comes available.

I am an avid movie watcher and I highly recommend waiting a little longer for the 3D Extended Edition which will follow this 3D version in a few months.

I was able to see the panasonic version 3D with a friend and truly enjoyed this movie. Now this release does not contain the EXTENDED VERSION that everyone seems to want.  Yes, after waiting all this time, we deserve the extended version. BUT those of us who HAVE this 3D version and are upset that there is no extended version on Blu- Ray either 1.

3932025,4,B002HEXVUI,"FINAL UPDATE:  My original review(below) was designed to help people get information about the 3D release(Theatrical version in 3D and a 2D DVD copy--with no extras), before it was available to the general public. This review was written before the extended collector's edition was available. I hope those of you who purchased either the 3D or extended editions are enjoying it.

UPDATE 10/2012: Final 3D release price was $24.96

UPDATE 8/2012: Just want to clear up a misconception that some people may have. In order to view the Panasonic Exclusive edition you did NOT need to own a 3D Panasonic HDTV and Blu-ray player. It worked on ANY 3D system. It was, however, only FREE to those who purchased Panasonic HDTV's, Blu-ray players and 3D Starter Kits during Panasonic's special promotion periods.

As this ""Collector's Edition"" is currently only a Pre-order item the purpose of my review is to provide information on what exactly this edition will contain as information becomes available and to address some obvious questions about the release (feel free to skip around to any questions that interest you). I own Avatar 3D(Panasonic Exclusive) and it is indeed terrific eye candy and a stunning showpiece in our 3D collection.

--Is it worth owning? Absolutely, if you have the 3D technology, liked the movie or simply want a great 3D experience.
--Should you buy it now if you've been waiting for it? Certainly, haven't you waited long enough for a 3D general release? It's time to finally see it.
--Should you pre-order it now if you want it? I would. Amazon could raise the price of this item before the release date or after if it's a big success. (Pre-orders are not billed to you credit card until the item is ready to ship. So your credit card will not be charged until about 3-5 days before the release)
--Should you buy it if you already have the 3D Panasonic Exclusive? Probably not. Rent or borrow it, but hold out for the 3D Extended Collector's Edition.

While of course I haven't actually seen this NEW edition yet, here is what I do know about it. This new two-disc Avatar 3D Blu-ray Collector's Edition will feature the original THEATRICAL release and be available in all-new special collectible packaging. The 2D and 3D theatrical versions of the film will be accessible on the Blu-ray disc and the included DVD will be 2D only. There has been no mention of this version including the extended cut of the movie or any extra special features or goodies. Even so, right now it looks like the NEW Amazon version will be better than the Panasonic Exclusive release. (The Panasonic Exclusive had no extras and didn't come with a separate standard DVD copy)

Is the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar-3D-Blu-ray-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B008XBCJ34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar (3D Blu-ray Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;going to have all of the versions and extras available on the non 3D&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar-Three-Disc-Extended-Collector-s-Edition-BD-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B0044XV3QY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar (Three-Disc Extended Collector's Edition + BD-Live) [Blu-ray</a>]?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The official announcement said that it will be the THEATRICAL cut. My guess is that if they were including other versions they would have said so as this would have created more of a buzz. There is speculation though that it will contain some new extras as this has become James Cameron's pet project.

Multiple sources have correctly predicted that when the 3D version was finally released it would not be a ""complete"" edition and Fox and Cameron would attempt to double dip by offering a barebones edition first(October, 2012) and then a complete edition with the 3 versions of the movie and extras later on down the road. (as they did with the DVD versions)  Many people will be very disappointed or even angry about this issue while others will be extremely happy to at last be able to own a copy of Avatar in 3D.

Will this theatrical Collector's Edition be exactly the same as the Panasonic exclusive edition in regards to picture quality and sound?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The official press announcement stated ""this release offers the highest picture quality possible"". The original movie was created using the Fusion Camera System, a digital movie camera system developed by James Cameron and Vince Pace and shot on multi format 3D Sony cameras. Avatar 3D is pretty much still the benchmark to which every 3D movie released in the USA is compared. It is hard to believe that it can or will be improved upon.

What languages and with what subtitles will this new 3D edition be offered?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazon's Product details say ""Language: English, French, Spanish, Subtitles: English, French, Spanish"". However, the Panasonic Exclusive said:
""Master Audio is English 5.1 DTS, French Spanish and Portuguese Audio in 5, Subtitles in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese"" so I guess the only question is regarding Portuguese.

Will this be a Region Free release?
---------------------------------------
The 3D Panasonic Exclusive was Region Free(Confirmed for Region A, B, C). I would guess that this release will be the same although currently it is only confirmed for Region A (Region B & C are untested).

Are people complaining that this release doesn't contain the extended version(cut) of the movie or that it's not an extended Collector's Edition?:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, both actually. It's about not having to spend more hard earned money on yet another version of Avatar and also about getting a different cut of the movie.
1) Those who already own the 3D Avatar Panasonic Exclusive(2D/3D single disc blu-ray) really wanted this to be the extended cut(16 additional minutes, including alternate opening on earth) or contain both the theatrical and the extended cut of the movie. Yes, this release does have an extra DVD copy(2nd disc) but otherwise there's nothing new.

2) Those who own both the 3D Avatar Panasonic Exclusive AND the non-3D Collector's Edition Blu-ray AND those who never purchased ANY version of this movie wanted this release to be the final, complete release with all 3 versions of the movies plus all the extras and goodies, hence, a TRUE COMPLETE 3D COLLECTOR'S EDITION.

About the Extended version: The ""extended cut"" of Avatar is not simply 16 additional minutes slammed onto the front end of the movie. It does start differently which adds some time to the beginning scenes but the 16 minutes difference is much more. It's little bits added and cut here and there(scenes, dialogue, locations, action) which many people feel made it a better movie. Other reviewers felt the extended cut ""lends further depth to the characters"", ""fills in important parts of the storyline"", ""enhances one's enjoyment of the film"", and that ""the Extended Edition of AVATAR and regular theatrical version are like watching two different films"". Here's a review that detailed the exact changes if you're interested(beware! contains spoilers):

So I guess the big question is whether this 3D version will be too little too late? (My thoughts)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By now almost anyone who liked this movie already owns it in either DVD or Blu-ray form. My hunch is that this release will sell EXTREMELY well no matter what's on it! There is a large group of people who have patiently waited for this 3D release and the price is certainly affordable for almost everyone.  PLUS, since the original theater showing of this film in 2009 many people have been slowly upgrading to 3D HDTV's and 3D Blu-ray players(or bought a Playstation 3). The big selling point here for Avatar in 3D is that technically 3D is ""the way it was meant to be seen"" as developed by director James Cameron. Hype or not, on that premise alone people are likely to purchase it. Probably even people who don't especially like the sci-fi/fantasy genre and/or have NEVER seen the movie but now  have a 3D HDTV setup will be buying it.

Since Cameron has announced ""I'm in the ""Avatar"" business. Period. That's it. I'm making ""Avatar 2,"" ""Avatar 3,"" maybe ""Avatar 4,"" and I'm not going to produce other people's movies for them."" we know that this movie is just the beginning of what he has to say ""in terms of the state of the world and what I think we need to be doing about it.""

What exactly makes this a ""Collector's Edition""?
------------------------------------------------------
If it only has the theatrical cut and not the extended cut is there really anything so ""limited"" or special about it? After waiting so long for this general release, for $27.99 I feel we should be getting more than just the barebones 3D edition. I feel cheated. This is certainly a 5-star movie based on technical merit alone, but I'll reserve the last star until I'm totally certain what the ""Collector's Edition"" contains. After all, this isn't really a review of just the movie. There have already been 5 releases of Avatar(2 DVD, 2 Blu-ray, 1 3D Panasonic exclusive). So a review of a ""Collector's Edition"" also needs to look at what's on the discs and the packaging too. The new cover art is pretty cool, but if they put this in a steelbook case or it had a stereoscopic jacket, now that would be something.

Food For Thought: I'm not quite sure why Amazon and other websites are tagging this as a ""Collector's Edition"". This just isn't true. The box art simply says ""Limited Edition"" and even Cameron didn't call it a collector's edition in his press release. It should just be listed as ""Avatar - Limited 3D Edition"".
UPDATE: Amazon has changed the title name of this offering to ""Avatar (3D Blu-ray + Blu-ray/ DVD Combo Pack)"" and removed the Collector's Edition working. Thank you Amazon.

Conclusion:
-------------
It's great that Avatar will finally be available to the general public in October. There will be much rejoicing over this in many homes.
However, Cameron's exclusive Panasonic deal has left a bad taste in many of our mouths. I think that in the next 2 months or so you will hear echoed everywhere the thoughts of so many ""If only it were the Extended Edition"".

Historical Info:
-----------------
Panasonic's rights to the Avatar 3D theatrical version expired Feb 29, 2012 and it was expected that a general release would follow in March or April. That was not to be. But Century Fox Home Entertainment is finally going to release the 3D version in October 2012 and you can now own it for the pre-order price of $27.99. Amazon's final release price was $24.96 in October.

If 3D TV is new to you just be aware that to watch this movie in 3D you need:

1.) a 3D capable HDTV,
2.) any 3D capable blu-ray player or a Playstation 3 (RE Playstation 3: You may need to initialize your PS3 for 3D with your display)
3.) 3D glasses compatible with your 3D HDTV brand.
4.) An HDMI cable. (some may need/want a high speed HDMI cable, but your current HDMI cable may be able to handle a 3D signal)",1344902400,55,11718,5.4222954420648

Watching it is like your part of the movie and it's like the first you've watched it. Jungle scene was really awesome! The plants, ferns, etc was really out of this world and absolutely wonderful! The separation of objects/items/people to the background have great depth that makes you think it's in front of you, and some parts make you feel your in the movie.  Wwwoooaaaahhhh! Every 3d bluray movies should be made like this. I have watched other 3d bluray movies, and the pop-out effects are not as good as this.

The end result is a perfect 3d video that truly shows the spirit and emotion of the film.

3932032,2,B002HEXVUI,"In my opinion, this film is seriously over-hyped. It's a combination of standard fare sci-fi with cultural clichs piled on knee deep. We all know that so-called ""advanced"" cultures have changed, pillaged and sometimes destroyed aboriginal cultures throughout history. The message of this film seems to be: ""Oh, how awful"".

And so it is and has been. But because virtually all ""primitive"" cultures have already been destroyed or corrupted by advanced cultures on Earth, the ""message"" appears to be directed toward the distant future. If it's directed toward contemporary cultures, it amounts to nothing more than a guilt trip. The retreat from the destruction of ""the Tree"" seems intentionally evocative of the Cherokee ""Trail of Tears"". I can only say: enough already! We already know we've been wicked... don't rub it in!

But for special effects fans, it's definitely a treat. All kinds of cool stuff, including even ""Mech Warrior"" (a video game) simulations near the end, where the villain finally gets his comeuppance. Arrows from raptors defeat ATGs and Vulcan cannon aboard assault helicopters! Yay! (The problem being that such stretches the imagination beyond the breaking point.)

Really, it's just silly; the kind of romance where the good guys win out against impossible odds... with Sigourney Weaver inevitably leading in the sci-fi genre born of 'Alien'. If we step back from it with a critical (and unfortunately realistic) eye, we recognize that this film is just a Pollyanna fantasy. If that's your gig, go for it.

3932045,1,B002HEXVUI,"I didn't like this movie. Now that I have said that, let me continue with the fact the cgi was AMAZING. I can't say enough about the special effects, they drew you in and it felt real even though you knew it wasn't. However I hated the plot and not just because it was a reboot of Pocahontas and Dances with Wolves. When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was interested in it because it was James Cameron and he did good stuff. However, what really clinched it was that scene where Quaritch is drinking his coffee in the cockpit of the gunship and all the missiles are shooting around him. I said myself ""That was such a BA scene and character that I have to see this movie"". I think I am the only person who watched the movie and connected the most with Quaritch. I thought that Jake was a traitor, he gave his word and then he disobeys his commanding officer, switches sides and fights against the people who spent tons of money to bring him out there and give him the avatar. In other words he stabbed RDA in the back with the knife they bought him. I didn't like the message of how the evil corporations controlled the government and the military, ruled a planet, destroyed the earth,and simply wanted to genocide a race of Native American blue monkeys just to mine a magnet. In short the movie was written to make Greenpeace happy and to start the Occupy movement, it's like the 70s all over again. I also got the not so subtle attempt to compare Jake with William Wallace and the Na'vi with the Scots (blue, really?). I also didn't like the anti-military peace message. ""(said with utmost sarcasm) After all, the evil corporations control the military and we are in Afghanistan to secure oil reserves (said with utmost sarcasm)"" just like how the military was on pandora to secure resources for the RDA in the movie.",1342310400,2,1829,4.43026706231454

3932047,5,B002HEXVUI,"Not to my surprise, Avatar was beyond amazing. Up until I actually saw it for myself, I had been letting the critics' opinions influence how I felt about this movie. But as I got ready to go see it I erased all those feelings I had, and it blew me away. And NO, it wasn't just the visual effects that I loved so much. The story was solid as well. I have read the many complaints of all of the peoples who were not as pleased with the film as I was, but I don't really care about what they have to say. It took James Cameron over a decade to finish his project, and some people are just not going to appreciate all the hard work that went into making it. Until the time comes for them to do it themselves, they are going to continue to nitpick every minor detail. Honestly, it doesn't really matter if they do or not because it's already a strong number one as the highest grossing film of all time, so obviously somebody liked it. But about the film. I'll start where everyone can agree, with the visual effects. I don't really think they raise the bar, because they were so expensive to make, that it was damn near impossible for them to be bad. The effects in Avatar are nothing short of beautiful. The various colors in the forests are all vivid and lively during the day, and equally beautiful in the darkness of the night. And the colorful creatures that inhabit the moon called Pandora, are also just as detailed and beautiful to look at. The supposedly upgraded 3D didn't blow me away with its innovation, but the sense of immersion was a welcome treat. It really enhanced the experience. Some of the people I saw the movie with said, ""If that's what Heaven looks like, then I'm ready to go right now!"" That quote says it all for the visuals. Now let's get to the story.

Of course the story was not entirely unique, but it was still good enough to make me want to watch this movie again and again. People love to say this story was just a knock off of Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas, but I have to disagree. So what if a man joined the group he was originally against, and so what if he fell in love with the princess. Nothing is entirely new these days. Almost every fresh idea has been taken some way or another. Getting past the plot, there are a few script problems. The script is the touchiest subject. On one hand, a USC Linguist was brought in to create a unique language for the Na'vi to speak. And he did a fantastic job with that. It is very apparent that a lot of effort went into that aspect, but on the other, we have the people. For the most part, everyone's lines are fine. Except for a lot of Colonel Quaritch and Trudy. A lot of what Col. Quaritch said was too basic and dull for my taste, but he doesn't get enough screen time to ruin the movie. James Cameron admitted that he only spent two to three weeks of the ten years plus on the script, and it shows. But this movie is still a classic, and one of the best of 2009. It's arguably one of the best of the decade. Proof of how great it is was the running time. Avatar was about two hours and forty minutes, but it went by so fast that it left me wanting more. Usually I'm happy with where a long movie ends, but this one was different. I could have easily sat through another half hour. So a few corny lines in a nearly three hour movie don't take anything away from the experience.

It's a definite must-see for all ages. And I don't believe that it's only good in 3D. Of course everyone should see it in 3D while it's still in the first theatres, just to get the maximum out of it, but seeing it in 2D would not take anything away from its greatness. For a long while, Avatar was my favorite movie of 2009, but after seeing Star Trek a couple more times that one took over, then the same thing happened with District 9. That doesn't mean that I cannot make up my mind, just that 2009 was a fantastic year for the Science Fiction genre. Now finally, the Extended Collector's Edition additions...in one word? Wow. The two new cuts add more than I thought they would. With the exception of the scene in the bar on Earth when the guy slaps his girlfriend, I think all of the extra footage should never have been cut. It was really essential plotline stuff. Neytiri's sister's subplot adds so much. And the sturmbeest hunt scene showed us how Jake earned his title as a ""Stone Cold Aerial Hunter"". Why was that not in the theatrical cut? IMAX runtime constraints shouldn't be an excuse to cut valuable footage. I also have to say I appreciated the Tsu'tey death scene. That's not a spoiler because everyone on the planet has seen this movie. And the extras, oh man the extras were top notch. This edition really feels like something that gets released a decade or two after a film has had time to settle into pop culture. What am I talking about? This is freaking Avatar. Only the biggest film ever made. Highly recommended.",1341792000,,4903,4.288025889967638

3932050,3,B002HEXVUI,"I saw ""Avatar"" in IMAX 3D the day it was released. I must say that, for three hours, I was absolutely entertained and thoroughly engaged with the movie. I saw it with a good friend, and afterward, we both found many things about the movie that we admired.

We also found, as several days and then weeks went by, that the movie simply faded away. In other words, it just did not provoke any more discussion, or indeed make any sort of real, lasting impression on us. I give ""Avatar"" three stars for its storytelling drive and its special effects, but can't go any higher than that because, ultimately, the movie is emotionally shallow and extremely pedantic.

It isn't as if James Cameron isn't capable of making movies with heart. ""The Abyss"" depended on a lot of special effects, too, but the scene involving the Deepcore crew trying to resuscitate Mary Elizabeth Mastranto is one of the most emotionally charged I've ever seen. By contrast, ""Avatar"" did not make me care all that much about its characters. NONE of them.

Worse, the movie is about as subtle as a punch in the snoot. James Cameron's disdain for what President Eisenhower dubbed ""the military-industrial complex"" is highly evident in several of his films, including ""The Abyss"" and ""Aliens."" Here, though, he takes it to absurd proportions. Giovanni Ribisi's Parker Selfridge and Stephen Lang's Col. Miles Quarich are both such caricatures that they might as well be cartoons. The former is your ultimate company man, and while Ribisi is a talented actor, he just can't do much with this, as the script has his character practically oozing contempt for anything that smacks of environmentalism or spiritual importance. The natives of Pandora stand in the way of wealth, and he'll do anything to erase them from the scene. As for Lang -- I don't think I've ever seen an actor so cheated out of something that could have been meaningful. He's very good, but Quarich is so absurdly gung-ho that his efforts in portraying him with any sort of complexity are completely wasted.

Sam Worthington is likable enough as the protagonist, Jake Sully, but that's all he ends up being -- likable. Not truly heroic, which he should be.

Performance-wise, that leaves Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver, the former being a young actress (she played Uhura in the ""Star Trek"" reboot) and the latter being a veteran who has worked with Cameron before (""Aliens""). Saldana's Neytiri is probably the most compelling character in the film; Saldana works hard to make her so. Her respect for life and her world come off as completely authentic. Weaver's Dr. Grace Augustine is the most COMFORTABLE character in the film -- a woman at home not only in her own skin but also in the body of her avatar. Weaver achieves this with a performance that's understated, not over the top.

Ultimately, though, their efforts are overwhelmed by the sheer and sometimes dead weight of the film.

I've read that Cameron is planning not one but at least two -- and possibly three -- sequels. I find myself very ambivalent about the prospect. Right now, my stance is that I suppose I'd see them if it were convenient, on an otherwise slow weekend. Or I could just as easily skip them.

When he's at his best, Cameron is a terrific filmmaker.

3932066,4,B002HEXVUI,"By definition, an avatar is a descendant who is a modified reincarnation of an earlier ancestor.  The definition really doesn't apply to the characters in Avatar who assume alien form to survive in a hostile planetary environment; they're more like participants in a virtual reality environment.  Rather, the definition applies to the movie ""Avatar"" as a whole.  As I saw it, ""Avatar"" is an avatar, in a way, of Star Wars.  While ""Star Wars"" took the framework and concepts of King Arthur and Camelot and placed it in space, ""Avatar"" took the framework and concepts of cowboys and mystical Native Americans and placed it in space.

  Therefore, you have, as I believe Boston Herald critic James Verniere put it, ""Dances with Giant Blue Ewoks"", which is a rather comprehensive description.  The only tweak is that instead of traditional cowboys, we have the traditional bullheaded military/industrial complex obsessed with conquest and pillage. So, as a majority of the posters here have sagaciously observed, originality is not ""Avatar""'s strong suit.  But then again, was ""Star Wars"" original?  The only original movie is arguably the first one ever made, and even it had to borrow from oral and written folklore and stories.

  Okay, enough digression.  ""Avatar"" is certainly derivative, but is it any good?  It's astonishingly very good I think, because James Cameron is not only a master of technology, but also good storytelling.  As you felt for Luke as he journeyed toward adulthood and his Jedi destiny, you will feel for quadriplegic Jake as he gropes his way forward towards physical independence, love, and defense of a higher spiritual good.  Sure, you've seen these morality tales before, but seldom with such impeccable CGI (and 3D) depictions, intense characterizations of both human and the alien Na'vi, unrelenting adventure and violence, and compelling spirituality (""God does not take sides, but preserves the universal balance"").  ""Star Wars"" had these elements, and of course soared to popular and critical acclaim.  ""Avatar"", ""Star Wars""'s avatar, of course duplicated this feat, even more so.

P.S.:  Pandora strongly reminded me of a planet you would find in the ""Star Wars"" mythos.  Wishful thinking, of course, since they are separated by immense time periods, but I would find a ""Star Wars""/""Avatar"" crossover interesting.",1339545600,,2349,5.241286863270777

You will not find Avatar on my List.

Hey, great CGI does not a great movie make. And Avatar certainly has some of the greatest CGI that I've ever seen. But let me see if I've got this storyline correct: Basically there's this moon or planet inhabited by The Blue Humanoid People. The Blue People have hair-in-a-ponytail that can connect to various living organisms that literally connect their minds to the extent that The Blue People can control the organism; okay, kinda cool.

But The Bad Humans (us) want to take over The Blue People's Moon/Planet/whatever in order to harvest some energy-rich resource. So The Bad Humans clone some Blue People, and via some magic machine that allows a human to take over the cloned Blue Person, The Bad Humans can put a spy into The Blue People's society in order to find out where they are and what they're up to. The human has to be asleep to take over the mind of the cloned Blue Person and the cloned Blue Person must be asleep whenever the human is awake. Okaaaayy.

Now the really good part: When the cloned Blue Person is introduced to the Blue People's society, he is for all intents and purposes immediately accepted...to an extent. Then he becomes more accepted and as predictable as ever, likes being a Blue Person more than a human, turns double agent and of course gets himself some Blue Person tail (pun definitely intended).  Uh huh.

And The Bad Humans get really bad: The leader of the expedition makes a decision in a vacuum outside whatever human government control there is, and as advanced as human civilization has become for whatever year this is supposed to be, is allowed to commit genocide on The Blue People with the help of a military-type commander that is even more extreme than the expedition leader. Ahhyyyye don't think so.

Oh and by the way, they're gonna take 2 hours and 40 minutes to tell the story. But heck, what do I know? The movie was number 1 at the box office for weeks, and it was the number 1 selling DVD for weeks; and the movie was up for Oscars and stuff. And I'm another sucker, 'cuz I bought the Blu Ray version when it was first released. Ugh.

Unfortunately, the storyline begins to slip seriously soon after the marine's first experience with the natives. The good guys are all good. The bad guys are all bad. And while they're both mostly black-and-white and one-dimensional, the bad guys lack any sophistication or even minimal intelligence in their motives. After the good guy/bad guy scenario is set up, the rest of the story continues to live down to the cliche. All of which makes the pivotal transition of Worthington's character absolutely facile. Cameron has created a gorgeous, almost flawless diamond and he put it in a 14k gold setting. The brilliance of the Na'vi people and the special effects that express them can't disguise the cheap storyline.

Although I walked away from the film feeling puzzled and let down, I would recommend it. Don't expect much in terms of character or plot development, and you'll be dazzled.",1337472000,7,1147,5.095744680851064

The point is made visually and every other kind of way that the powerful and destructive machines of the human invasion have no place on Pandora. Pandora is a planet that quite obviously represents the best of fertile nature. Certainly there are predators, very frightening ones indeed, but the Na'vi have adapted to sharing the world with them. The Na'vi are as intimately in tune to the life of the entire planet as we understand Native Americans to be, but with a world far more abundant and fertile than the rather arid reservations on which the natives eke out an existence in the US today.

Into this garden of Eden comes a group of Avatars, which are cloned by a combination of Na'vi and human DNA in such a way that a human can be linked to his Na'vi Avatar so that when one is awake, the other is asleep, and they share their knowledge and memories and, to the extent possible, their personalities. Jake Sully's twin brother had been training for Avatar work, and his Avatar clone was almost ready to decant, when he was killed. It was so very lucky that he had a twin, and so Jake was summoned to work his dead brother's Avatar. But Jake was crippled by an accident, and has to go to Pandora with his wheelchair.

The mining operation on Pandora looks like a military operation, and in fact hired a lot of former Marines, but it is a commercial venture. So we have the mercenaries who run fantastic robotic monsters and huge mining equipment to recover Unobtanium, a very rare and valuable element which lies in very rich deposits right under the enormous Sacred Tree of the Na'vi. As we get to know the Na'vi beliefs and rituals, it becomes obvious this is no coincidence.

Yes, there is also a charming blue-skinned love story between Jake and the local Na'vi princess. There are flying dragons to ride, pagan rituals, unimaginable beauty in the landscape, including a level of bio-luminescence that turns the place into Wonderland at night. There's great beauty, terrible evil, love and hate, huge battles, adventures, heroes and villains. I'd recommend this film to anyone.",1336780800,2,2266,4.6575
3932084,3,B002HEXVUI,"Everything has already been said so I will try to keep this short.

Aside from the whole ""remotely controlling an avatar"" thing, there is very little originality in this film. And even THAT is pretty unoriginal: the comic series ""Surrogates"" did it recently before (and had a movie come out the same year as Avatar), and similar sci-fi instances of this are not hard to come by.

The whole plot was basically ripped off from ""Dances with Wolves""...the further on the movie got, the more blatant it became.

Even the MUSIC is unoriginal. The composer was long-time Cameron collaborator James Horner, who seems to have seen it fit to rip-off his own work on other films. Off the top of my head two examples stand out: towards the middle/end of the film, there is some music that is an almost direct copy of some stuff from ""Aliens"". Then towards the end, he flat out rips off his own theme from the film ""Glory"".

While it's entertaining for sure, everything about this film screams ""derivative"".",1336521600,4,994,4.695402298850575

Most movies suffer from 3-d, however, in avatar the three dimensionality is introduced seemingly with the rest. Its like the music, the actors, the special effects, it is integrated into the film that it becomes natural instead of forced upon.

The one downfall of this movie, i would say, its is story. It features a very cliche storyline that probably hundred other films, books and other media have alread explored.

I liked the unusual idea of mentally transferring into a larger alien body. The brightly colored scenes were a real treat. The human commander was too eager for combat but history is full of competent men who got carried away with conquest. The culture and flora/fauna was different so you had no frame of reference.

3932087,3,B002HEXVUI,"OK, this is a very polarizing film.  This review is geared toward the theatrical (2D) edition, does not address the many issues with 3D, or the multiple releases/director's cuts; other reviews have spoken to those issues at length.  For what it's worth, I saw the film in theaters in 3D, but am not into home 3D.  My view is that some moments are richer in 3D, but overall it's more of a gimmick than a true enhancement of the viewing experience.  But if you like 3D, this is a good movie for it.  As to the film itself:

What I liked:  the ""avatar"" concept of having your body in stasis while you roam around as an indigenous species had some interesting implications to it.  Some of the creatures, and also some of the technology (weapons, ships, etc.) were cool.  Several of the planetary scenes (flying, hunting) were beautifully done, visually-speaking.  And reactions to the blue ""avatars"" themselves have been mixed; but I was fine with them (better than JarJar and his Gungan friends in SWE1/PM, at least).  If that's all you wanted, good movie.  However . . .

What I didn't like:  many of the same things that have been fully-documented in other reviews.  Completely unoriginal plot.  No characterization.  The ""heartless mega-conglomerate exploits the indigenous tribe"" has been done so many times, and it is done here with no interesting variation.  And, I'm sorry, I know the ""tree of life"" scene was intended to be a beautiful and ethereal expression of their deeply-held love for their planet.  But I found it to be creepy and weird, not to mention blatantly advocating the green movement's message that we should love our own planet every bit as much.  James Cameron for President . . . of Greenpeace.

So if you're looking for deep understanding of anything, don't bother.  Deep, involving plot?  Characters you care about?  Ditto.  But if you just want a sci-film that is a bit formulaic, but a feast for the eyes, then this one will work.",1335744000,6,1957,4.735905044510385

3932091,5,B002HEXVUI,"I am a Sci-Fi freak! I read it, watch it and thoroughly enjoy it. I rarely watch a movie or read a book more than once. I have watched this movie 8 times. It simply has the best futuristic graphics and vision of a possible future encounter with an alien race I have ever seen.

I won't review the storyline. That has been done a thousand times better that I could retell it. I can only say that movie was creative, entertaining and visually outstanding (Overwhelming may be more like it!). More than 60% of the movie was CGI and the quality made it look real. In a scene where Jake Sully, as the Avatar, is tied up you can even see the lines on his skin where the bindings were in place. No detail was not reviewed and perfectly done. The levels of technology shown in the movie in such graphic perfection are amazing.

The movie has grossed over 2.8 billion dollars in sales globally and it is still going up. The standard for the next greatest Sci-Fi movie has been set and it may be that the next winner is the second movie of Avatar. The fact that this movie did not win the Academy Award for best Picture, Best Director Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing was in my opinion a tragedy. The movie that won these awards generated 2 percent of Avatar's USA revenue and far less when compared to a global basis. What did the movie goers who buy tickets see that the Hollywood critics and Academy Award voters didn't see; a better movie! James Cameron didn't get the awards but he cashed in at the bank!

3932093,5,B002HEXVUI,"This is a movie for our times and one of the best movie made to date. At least for me, it is my favorite movie. Perhaps it's because I'm a biologist by training and a conservationist by perspective. Thus, I see parallels with the destruction of the Pandoran forests for the desired mineral 'unobtainium' with the destruction of Amazonian rain forests for gold and mountaintop removal in the Appalchians for coal. Corporate power and desire for riches are a driving force in our culture and we immediately recognize this along with the military support to back it up. At the same time, many of us 'feel' for the 'noble savage,' or 'blue monkeys,' as denigrated by the corporate manager of operation on Pandora. The mercenary militants seem to share this 'them verse us' attitude and cannot see the forest for the trees. One of them, Jake, becomes more sensitive to the indigenous over time as he interacts extensively with the Navi, especially the female who becomes his mate.

Through the richly peppered action scenes, our hero (Jake), overcomes many obstacles to ultimately save the natives from the alien humans. Superb action scenes with riveting suspense keep the viewer focused on the screen throughout the movie. In short, the movie is rich in special effects, the science is pretty good and extended in a believable way, environmental concerns are presented along with the general demise of indigenous populations (although in this case the Navi make a comeback with the help of 'Aywa' and the other creature of Pandora - the most unbelievable, but appreciated part of the final battle for Pandora). Add a little fantasy with flying dragon like creatures and a love story and you have a very appealing movie with some environmental, social, and economic messages that many of us can see and appreciate.

Those who criticise the clichd plot obviously are not aware that many films copy the plot of others; a conflicted protagonist wrestling with his conscience is a common device. For example, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is a retelling of SEVEN SAMURAI (I saw elements of the Tom Cruise film, THE LAST SAMURAI in AVATAR, too). It may be a hackneyed plot, but this isn't a legitimate criticism. Secondly, the CGI is so good that for once you actually forget about it; it settles into your subconscious and you accept it. The so-called 'emotion capture' is so good that you engage completely with the characters and forget they are CG. You stop looking for those tell-tale hints that it's not real and you go with it. In so many CG-heavy films this isn't the case, and so it's a testament to Cameron and his army of CG artists who made this possible in such a visually arresting, ground-breaking way.",1334275200,4,1040,4.657608695652174

3932123,5,B002HEXVUI,"The first time I saw AVATAR was when the rest of the world did, in the theaters in 3D.  Afterwards I was considerably underwhelmed by the super-hyped super-anticipated return to sci-fi by James Cameron.  It was the story that did me in, not the film-making itself:  Too rehashed, familiar, predictable, and unoriginal.  I was also pretty turned off by the only-a-white-man-in-natives'-skin-can-save-natives'-collective-skins subtext...

A few years go by, all the while I'm trashing the flick whenever it comes up in conversation.  Then... something happens to someone close, something tragic.  This person held AVATAR in high regard and this was a person who's taste in art, particularly the art of film-making, I held in high regard.  On a very difficult day I was compelled to pick up the latest 3 disc blu-ray extended collects edition of AVATAR and gave it another go... And I was honestly blown away!  This was really surprising to me, having already seen this movie, one I'd found predictable before ever seeing before.  I was thrilled by the pacing (the extended cut really helps) but I was truly wowed by the artistry, production design, and imagination at work here.  The avatars and Na'vi performance capture (or ""virtual make-up"" as Cameron and others refer to it throughout the plentiful and satisfying supplemental docs, features, and extras) is absolutely astounding.  I suppose once I allowed myself the enjoy what AVATAR is and not focus on what it isn't I opened myself to the wildly bold film-making it really is.

I'm looking forward to my third viewing.

P.S.  Watching it on a 64"" Samsung Plasma sure helps!  Breathtaking!",1330214400,,1644,5.101123595505618
3932124,3,B002HEXVUI,"First off, let me say, I really loved this movie.  It was a brilliant achievement for the technical and artistic wizardry that brought an alien world to life on screen in such lavish detail, and with such spectacular visual beauty.  Moreover, the storytelling was great as well.  The movie was well paced, the characters' motivations believable (mostly), the acting was top notch, and the characters that the actors portrayed were (for the non-villains at least) well-drawn, likeable characters with whom the viewer can identify.  All of this makes for a stunning cinematic experience, and I immensely enjoyed watching the film.  For its technical wizardry, and in the sense of  it's been an interesting story, well told, the film deserves five stars.

Having said that, however, there is something about the movie that irritated me intensely, and I'm not seeing it mentioned in many of the mostly gushing reviews here, so I guess I will have to be the voice in the wilderness (no pun intended).  In ""Avatar"" we are treated to yet another round of the old ""noble savage"" myth.  The term's been around since at least the seventeenth century (though the actual idea is much, much older - read Tacitus' comments on how Germanic barbarians had certain virtues that the jaded, decadent Romans of his day lacked, for example), and one would think we'd have learned better than to indulge in such condescending romantic nonsense by now.  Basically, the idea is that people are essentially good and virtuous by nature, and advanced civilization and its institutions are what causes them to lose their way.  This is certainly the interpretation this movie supports, where the Na'vi are seen as unqualifiedly noble, virtuous, unselfish, people, unsullied by greed, rapacity, cruelty, etc. and living in perfect harmony with nature, understanding to the Nth degree the part they are supposed to play in their world's ecosystem.  By contrast, the earth-people - civilized people - are capable of being good, like Sully and Grace and Trudy, but are just as often callous, arrogant, greedy, self-righteous, and so on, and who, in the end, behave like Nazi Einsatzkommandos.

The first problem with this is that the idealized noble savage, of the sort depicted here, never existed.  Archaeology reveals evidence of violence and warfare in the earliest and most primitive societies.  There never was a primeval Eden where people lived peacefully in primitive, yet enlightened commune with nature, perfectly in harmony with their world.  Archeology, again, shows that primitive man could be, and usually was, just as destructive of his environment as modern man, it simply took him longer to use up his resources with only primitive technology at his disposal.  And what living in primitive societies actually means is average lifespans of 29, women giving birth to a dozen children in the hopes that at least half of them will live out their first year; it means being helpless when smallpox or cholera or typhus or bubonic plague swoops down on your community and carries off half the population.  It also means superstition and ignorance, and so, perhaps things like, say, a nice human sacrifice to take away the anger of the gods and persuade them to give you a better harvest this year, since the last one was so poor that many of the community starved to death over the winter.  Primitive life is no idyllic dream.  It NEVER was.

The second problem with this movie is that it is a clumsy commentary on the history of colonialism, in the form of a fantasy tailored specifically for white people living with a heavy load of liberal, white guilt. And what is ironic is that, entirely unintentionally I'm sure, the film ultimately marginalizes indigenous peoples and affirms white supremacy - this ought to come as no surprise, I suppose, since a great deal of the modern liberal/progressive self-righteous moral preening turns out to be incredibly patronizing when you look at it in the harsh light of reality.  And what do we see in this movie, when we look at it in that critical light?  Jake Sully is white redemption incarnate - liberal guilt enfleshed.  He serves to redeem the human race in general, and white Europeans in particular, by proving that at least some of us (guilty liberals, naturally) are good.  This, I'm sure, is Cameron's intentional message.  But his unintentional one is that white liberals like him aren't merely good, they're SUPERIOR to just about everybody else.  Look what happens as the movie unfolds: Sully is turns out not only to be a superior human being, he is also a superior Na'vi.  He does what none of these poor natives can do.  After enduring a brief period of contempt and ostracism for the part he played in the land grab perpetrated by the greedy humans, he redeems himself in spectacular fashion by performing a feat beyond the ability of any living Na'vi; he tames the most feared predator  in the skies of Pandora, thereby proving himself to be the most skillful, most courageous warrior imaginable, according to the Na'vi view of things.  He follows this up by assuming leadership of the Na'Vi, and working out their strategy.  Then, of course, his performance in the ensuing fight shows him to be their most valuable player on the battlefield too.  Then, with all the other Na'vi contenders for leadership conveniently dead, Sully not only assumes permanent leadership, he wins the heart of the most desirable girl in the tribe for good measure. The Na'vi now worship the ground he walks on.  As one commentary I read put it: ""This is a classic scenario you've seen in non-scifi epics from Dances With Wolves to The Last Samurai, where a white guy manages to get himself accepted into a closed society of people of color and eventually becomes its most awesome member.""  The natives still end up with a white guy as their leader; it just happens in a kinder, gentler way.  And, of course, being a guilty liberal, he proves to be an enlightened leader, rather than an oppressor.  The natives are now better off than ever.

It's a story written, as I've said, by and for guilty white liberals.  If a story like this were written by the colonized people of color themselves, something tells me there would be no white redeemer; the hero would come from within their own ranks, and when the battle was over and won, they'd continue with their lives, under their own leadership, with no humans/white Europeans in sight, whether of the guilty liberal variety or not.  Film makers like Cameron think they are being so just, noble, fair, and enlightened, by rubbing our noses in our own (admittedly) dark past.  But when you look at the story they tell when trying to do it, what you see them do, over and over, and again, probably entirely without meaning to, is rediscovering a sneaky way of turning every story about people of color into a story about ever so noble white people (like them, of course) -- and it's a story that doesn't entirely rewrite the history of colonialism either; they still get to be top dog, at the end.  But what else can you expect?  Self-righteous people, unsurprisingly, usually turn out to be self-centered as well.",1330041600,3,7178,4.868421052631579

I knew that, for a movie over 2 hours long, it should have something special. So, hearing about the extended version coming out later the same year the normal came out, I had reason to be excited.
I'll admit, I was a bit dissappointed that, for a movie this long, the extended (the longest) had only 16 extra minutes. Nonetheless, it was a great film to watch. From symbolism of early English takeover of Indian lands to a noticeable contrast between drab military areas and exoticly marvelous alien lands. The guy who plays Jake, I've noticed in other movies he's the star of, does a great job of playing a character with a dichotomous personality, playing a part of two different worlds, each being flawed in their own way.
Some seem to have quite a gripe about having one movie on two discs. I truly had no problem with this setup (like I didn't for the extended Lord of the Rings), it means less time being lazy and more time being active while watching a movie, even if just a little.
The special features provided quite a good bit of insight, though James Cameron forgot to mention, in one feature dealing with the story and the technology itself, that he knew the technology was ready when he saw Golum on LotR. Aside from that, I did enjoy all the features, most especially the deleted scenes and extended scenes.

The movie was a great adventure and action packed film. I felt like I learned the way of the Na'vi right through Jake Sully's eyes.

3932135,4,B002HEXVUI,"This is a well-scripted and incredibly well-made film (it is James Cameron, after all) set in a futuristic world but bringing up several historical and modern, Earthly social delemas.  The issue of uncontrolled consumerism has driven the people to the earth to depleat all of its natural resources and look for raw materials elsewhere, in this case finding them in a near-by star system; a galactic take on the often repeated terrestrial story of exploitation.  Encountering an indiginous people on the planet Pandora, the human characters in the film begin to exploit them and their native land to their own, industrial ends.  Not unlike the history of genocidal conquest of the New World by western powers in search of gold, precious stones and land; the film demonstrates a disregard for the spiritual connection the natives have to their homeland in the minds of the foreigners.  The Na'vi live in a spritual place where they are connected to nature, which helps win the day in the final battle, through a neural connection between minds and souls of living things; this can be thought of as an alagory to several ancient or indiginous religious practices (though with a more scientific explanation in the modern era), with harmony and balance between people and nature being a central aspect to the belief system.

A well-made and thought out movie, Avatar is both the chance to see some stunning special effects produced by one of the true masters of that field and the oportunity to stimulate a little thought on the historical perspective of industrialism's expansionistic past and the effects that it has had on local populations and their belief structures.",1327795200,,1667,5.02536231884058
3932136,4,B002HEXVUI,"AVATAR

 This week assignment was to watch one of three movies and write a review.  Also, I needed to explain how it illustrates indigenous sacred ways as it relates to World Religions. The movie I choose was the 2009 film ""Avatar"".  I choose this movie because it received good reviews and it was recommended to me by some friends.  ""Avatar"" was a great film that included epic battle scenes as well as learning to appreciate a foreign culture.
 The movie begins by introducing the main character, Jake Sully. Jake is a Marine whom was injured and now is restricted to a wheelchair.  Jake does not let his misfortune handicap him.  It only inspires him to work harder to prove Doctors and skeptics wrong.  Jake takes a job and travels to another planet called Pandora.  He is then linked in with another alien body that was genetically engineered using human DNA along with Na'vi, native creatures, DNA.
 While operating his avatar, Jake meets Neytiri, a Na'vi native who belongs to the Clan that is threatened by the company who Jake works for.  The company wants to mine for precious rocks that are located underground where the Na'vi resides.  The Na'vi do not want to move and do not want the humans to destroy or alter the forest.  The Na'vi believes the forest is alive and everything in the forest has an energy that they all need to share.
 Neytiri is then instructed by her father to teach Jake the Na'vi way of life. Jake is faced with challenges at every turn.  He has to learn the language, customs, religion, as well as how to ride and fly majestic animals.  The other members of the Clan do not want Jake around and think of him as an moron.  Over time Jake works hard and learns the way of the Na'vi. He begins to see the animals he hunts for food are his brothers in life and thanks them for giving their life to feed the Na'vi.  He starts to understand the trees have ancient powers and healing qualities.
 Many ancient and current cultures think of nature as Gods or having spirits that guide and heel people.  As in our text Living Religions by Mary Pat Fisher, on page 58 it shows a sacred tree in Mexico that people placed articles of clothing on and offer prayers to the Great Spirit.  Also on page 60, it shows the Efe pygmies of the Ituri Forest in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  They believe the forest is a Great Spirit similar to the Na'vi.

3932137,5,B002HEXVUI,"The movie Avatar, is a movie based on colonization and how it effects the indigenous people. It starts out with a human filled scene of the star, former marine Jake Sully finding out his twin brother is dead, taking over his project, and turning a new leaf in his career becoming a indigenous people, in form only. Jake's mission is to earn the native's trust so he can get them to move their home so his colleagues can mine. The persuasion to move does not pan out. After learning the native's ways and falling in love, he instead decides to see through their eyes, and try to persuade his human colleagues to not get them to move. In the end, it turns into a war, with the natives winning eventually and the humans being sent back to earth, with only a select few to remain behind.
 Avatar is a great example of World Religions, especially the chapter on indigenous people and their sacred ways. The indigenous people portrayed in the movie show the kinship with all creation as described in Living Religions. ""Within the spiritually charged visible world, all things may be understood as spiritually interconnected."" (Pg. 43) For example, when the dog has to be killed to save Jake on his first night out in the wild, as well as when they kill for food, they pray over the body and thank the mother god.
 The indigenous people in the movie also have a firm belief in the nature of life, the energy circle. They also have a Shamash, a woman that is the link between the spiritual world and the natural world.  Avatar portrays the woman like the Yoruba teaching story does through the Osun and the Power of Woman, portraying the woman ""...her womb is the matrix of all life in the universe...she is the leader of the...powerful beings and forces in the world."" (Pg. 43)
 Throughout the movie, one cannot help reflect on the past history and how much the movie relates to many cultures throughout the centuries and what they must have gone through. All in all, this is a very powerful movie and brings to the forefront the ignorance the technology advanced culture has when it comes to the earth and the oldest beliefs and traditions. Jake even comments during the movie, when talking to the indigenous tribe, that they (the Americans) have killed their mother and they are going to do the same to yours. Quite possibly, Avatar is sending us the simple message to be thankful and acknowledge the little things around you, that we are all interconnected.  Could that be right and we just have forgotten it in our need for advancement?

3932142,5,B002HEXVUI,"Having never been privileged enough to catch Avatar in 3D on the big screen,let alone digital theater, it was a given for me that this beautiful film would eventually make its way into my Blu Ray collection. I could say I was in a coma but fact being stranger than fiction, I live in a tiny town in Idaho so naturally, no IMAX.  When I heard Cameron planned on releasing an Extended Version to Blu Ray, of course, this only served to whet my appetite further but, just before I bit the bullet and paid the whopping $40 asking price, something wonderful happened.

3D home theater technology became more affordable and this Christmas past, I was fortunate enough to have been gifted with a bundle including the LG PZ550 3D Plasma&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LG-50PZ550-50-Inch-1080p-600-Hz-Active-3D-Plasma-HDTV-with-Internet-Applications/dp/B004LU1N1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LG 50PZ550 50-Inch 1080p 600 Hz Active 3D Plasma HDTV with Internet Applications</a>&nbsp;(astonishing television by the way..LG is highly recommended if you're in the 3D market this year) and a Panasonic 3D BDT210 blu ray player&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Panasonic-DMP-BDT210-Integrated-Wi-Fi-3D-Blu-ray-DVD-Player/dp/B004G8HXXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Panasonic DMP-BDT210 Integrated-Wi-Fi 3D Blu-ray DVD Player</a>.  Combined, these two pieces of technology make for a full 1080p 3D experience just short of having IMAX at home.

I encourage you though, please do your research.  Although the LG Plasma 3D TV's have arguably the best picture quality on the market, the glasses are pricey as the plasma requires active vs. passive, 3D technology.  If you're in the market, but barely, and you have many people who will be joining you for ESPN and other 3D treats, I suggest going with passive 3D as the image quality to price ratio trade off is probably well worth it in hindsight.  A single pair of active glasses for my tv runs anywhere from $80 to $100 or more&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LG-AG-S250-3D-Active-Shutter-Glasses-for-2011-LG-3D-Plasma-HDTVs/dp/B004P52OAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LG AG-S250 3D Active Shutter Glasses for 2011 LG 3D Plasma HDTVs</a>(they are literally tiny dual LCD screens) while passive glasses (like what you get at theaters)can come in sets of 4 to 10&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toshiba-FPTP100UP-Part-Pack-3D-Glasses/dp/B005G10HU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toshiba FPTP100UP Part Pack 3D Glasses</a>, ideal for family and friends and priced around 40 dollars for the bundle.  I know right....?  But as of this review, it is not possible to get a true 1080p 3D image using passive technology.

Anyway on to this release.  This blu ray was an incentive for purchasing a qualifying Panasonic 3D blu ray player.  The one aforementioned can now be found for less than $100 if you look around and will offer a voucher for Avatar 3D until Spring 2012, when the 3D version finally makes its way to retail.

This version includes the extended footage which, much like Peter Jackson did with Lord of the Rings, Cameron uses to full advantage to flesh out the story and characters.  (Sorry George Lucas, love SW but you let us all down with that awful mess of a prequel trilogy).

Cameron's genius and imagination are combined to create the Pandora which we have all come to know and love.  The use of his uniquely developed 3D camera system and seamless CGI were unprecedented in theaters and this 3D blu ray port DOES NOT DISAPPOINT.  I will readily tell you that, all told, I spent a little over $1,000 dollars building my 3D home system BUT, the market value was still a bit high and I went with top of the line everything.

That being said, having Avatar 3D on Blu Ray in my collection, far and away makes every penny worth it.  The 3D is incredible and thanks to new revolutionary 3D processors, you can actually now watch all of the nearly 3 and a half hours of this movie without the slightest headache..although..after seeing it in 3D, you may never want to leave Pandora again.  Oh and for you Avatar fans, if you're waiting for Avatar 2, don't hold your breath like you don't have a respirator pack, Cameron has just announced that the forthcoming 2 follow up films are being pushed out to Christmas 2016 and 2017 respectively.  The report says that Cameron ""has something special in mind"" for our return to Pandora.  I'm sure it will be well worth the wait but, in the meantime, if you love 3D and you love Avatar, this disc is a must have.  You WILL NOT BE disappointed.",1326931200,2,4687,5.51536312849162

Anyways, to be completely honest, I like it, but don't find it absolutely amazing. The graphics are incredible, I agree on that. But the story was just not that captivating to me.

**Spoiler Alert**
I also felt that bad guy Colonel Quaritch lasted way too long. Yes, all the things he did were meant to give you the feeling that this guy was invincible and a quality enemy, but he should have died long before he did. Getting to his death dragged on for a little too long for me. Plus, that guy basically never breathed in this movie. Every time you see him, he's holding his breath while trying to kill something... and he can hold his breath for a really, really long time - and never turned purple (or even red) once! HISHE killed him off right:

Also, that avatar almost-sex scene was bit awkward. And that's all I have to say about that.

Knowing that this special edition was coming out when the first Blu-ray was released, I held off to buy this...one of my best Blu-ray decisions to date.  If you really want to be convinced on whether to pick this one up, visit Blu-ray.com and read their review on the disc.  You'll be back for it.  As a seasoned bargain shopper, I will say that if you're patient, keep checking back here and at other online retailers.  I was able to get mine brand new at $15, even though I'd still consider this edition a steal at $25.  Between the storyline, the acting, the cast, the music (I'm a film score fan, as well), and the direction of Jim Cameron, you'll want to show this one off to friends and family.  I can't recommend this highly enough.  To let you know whether my recommendation fits your taste, some of the best sci-fi/fantasy films I've seen in recent years (and purchased on Blu-ray) are District 9, ""9"", Star Trek, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and Inception.",1326412800,,1052,4.5
3932146,5,B002HEXVUI,"To tell the truth when I walked into the theater to watch the movie ""Avatar"" I did not think it would be any good.  I was wrong.  To start off, the special effects were one of the best I have ever seen in my entire life.  Every scene was portrayed with color and vibrancy.  It even made the Hallelujah Mountains (floating mountains) seem legitimate.  Although the actors may not be exactly who you would have expected, they did a phenomenal job.  When you are watching the movie you truly believe that the actors are the character they play.  Each line was spoken with true feeling and emphasis.  One of the most remarkable things about the movie was the language.  The fact that the movie producers can create an entirely made up language and then have each actor memorize it is beyond me.
 On the surface it may seem that the storyline is pretty fantasized and has nothing to do with your life, but if you dig a little deeper you will realize that it is very relevant.  The movie brings up the idea of corporate greed.  The government wants to go to Pandora and harvest its riches.  When they get there they realize that an entire population is settled on the land, but they do not care.  All they want is the riches and therefore are willing to do anything to get it.  I think that, along with some fighting scenes, is the reason it is truthfully rated pg13.  Despite the great aspects, the fact that they name the ore that they cannot obtain ""unobtainium"" is pretty cheesy.  If you are going to create an entire dialogue for the Navi you can at least come up with a clever name for some ore.
 My favorite scene was towards the end when Neytiri fought Colonel Miles Quaritch.  This scene was very dramatic because Jake Sully was trapped unconscious and Neytiri had to get to him first otherwise he would die.  The blows went back and forth, Neytiri riding a vicious beast, and Colonel Miles Quaritch fighting inside a robot.  When Neytiri knocked Colonel Miles Quaritch's gun out of his hands he pulled out his knife and killed the beast.  It landed on top of Neytiri trapping her under his corpse.  This scene supports the theme of the movie which is trust.  Neytiri had to decide whether or not to accept Jake as one of the Navi and had to trust him.  The same went for Jake.  He needed to decide whether or not he should trust the marines or the Navi.  Overall, ""Avatar"" surpassed its expectations and `wowed' almost anyone who came to see it.",1326240000,,2449,4.457207207207207

Years after he did Titanic, I didn't think we'd see a movie from him again and when I heard that Avatar was coming and it was James Cameron directing, that was all i needed to keep me pacing around till December 2009 came around.

Even though the storyline for this is over-used seen it and heard it before mash-up, to me its just a reminder of how great stories can be at times. Its not as great as Titanic was, but I appreciate what James Cameron did for the movie. I still don't understand how The hurt locker beat this one for best director and picture, but after that: Thanks, James Cameron and please give us an Avatar 2! :)",1325980800,2,706,4.30827067669173
3932149,5,B002HEXVUI,"Revisiting Avatar

There were several important points and fascination with the three DVD edition of Avatar.  The director, James Cameron is interviewed and tells of his inspiration for the film, including the Amazon jungle, the dams that are being built there, the corporate encroachment across the Amazon Basin.  It's a full documentary and is quite an eye-opener.

We're taken on a guided tour of the rainforest and meet the native peoples who are being slowly displaced by this encroachment.  The Amazon natives are represented in the movie as well.  ""Dances with Wolves?""  Don't think so.

Pandora is the metaphor for the Amazon rainforest.  Watch the movie and the beginning scenes we have strip-mining and (what some reviewers totally miss) has little to do with Marines.  These Marines were now mercenaries working for the company that is strip mining for minerals for Earth.

I really enjoyed this film - it speaks well of the battle between corporate greed and the displacement of the environment and the people who depend upon it.  But it also is about a man who has a disability and is being called on to take over for what his brother was going to do, to transform himself.

Cameron's film also shows this transformation and dependence on nature and the environment.

The complete collector's edition has so much material.  I really liked the extended scenes.  The beginning with what Earth looks like at this time, our friend fighting in a bar with his wheelchair was great, and the big, bad corporation and what its goals and purposes are.

Regardless of how you feel about the theatrical edition, do watch the collector's edition.  Much more to it, fills out the story and it's nothing to do with ""Dances.""  I mean really now!",1325894400,,1742,4.8839590443686

3932153,5,B002HEXVUI,"What can you say about it that hasn't already been said?  The movie is great.  If you didn't like it, then you probably won't be reading this review anyway, and that's fair enough -- you won't be interested.  But if you DO like it, or love it, then you can't go far wrong here.  On blu-ray, Avatar is immensely impressive, with a wealth of detail picked out, and the extended version only adds a little extra to the movie.  It does feel somehow a shade more complete even than the original cinematic version, which was already excellent.

I've not yet had time to browse through the special features, but there are two whole discs, and if you ever wanted to see what went on behind the scenes of making a movie, this would be on a level with The Matrix in terms of curiosity; the technical achievement alone is impressive, and I'm looking forward to seeing it.  But those features aren't why I'm recommending this set.  The movie is good enough to earn that on its own.",1325635200,,969,4.435028248587571
3932154,5,B002HEXVUI,"I just watched the extended edition for the first time, and highly recommend it to folks who want a little bit more plot for this film (vesus the theatrical release).

I won't add much on the details, as they have been very well covered by other reviewers.  Rather, let me say that this film is in the top tier of my favorites. Why?  Well, it sure isn't for the dialogue (as others have noted).  I typically like Woody Allen films and the like, film adaptations of Shakespeare, and other films with intricate plots and well-crafted dialogue, such as finely crafted adaptations of historical novels, BBC dramas, or made-for-film historical dramas.  In other words, I usually like well-written films.

But, I also like well-done science fiction and fantasy.  And, I am a forest ecologist, and was a ""combat biologist"" in the logging wars of coastal Alaska from the late 1980's to around 2000.  So, this film appeals to me in two different ways.  First, it is a wonderful imagining of an ecosystem on an alien world.  It has been done in literature a number of times, perhaps most exquisitely in the Dune series, but rarely in film.  Second, it shows hope for the survival of the natural world against the money-driven forces that are working their will on our very own planet.  I get the same feeling from watching Erin Brokovich and other great envionmentally-themed films.  This one just happens to take place on the ""Earth First! We'll Log the Other Planets Later"" (a sticker that was on the door of one of Alaska's more Neanderthal legislators a while back) location.  Two thumbs up!",1325635200,,1585,4.758241758241758

The story, on the other hand; hackneyed, trite, derivative. Without the stunning visuals to carry it this would be at best a two star movie. I suspect that the story may even be intended to take a back seat and not distract from the visual wonders.

3932160,5,B002HEXVUI,"I've read some positives & very few negatives of this boxset. I can tell you that I am in the upper majority that love this boxset. I read that a few people felt their discs weren't as secured in the cardboard sleeves, but I can tell you that wasn't the case for me. Don't know why, though. My discs were very, very secured and don't move around at all.

I'm a big movie buff but even more so a ""Special Features"" fanatic, so this boxset delivers all that I could dream of in the world of Avatar. I see some people wonder why did this boxset have to have all 3 versions that have been released to date when they could've just only distributed the extended version and that's it. Though I agree, but go over to the Star Wars Complete Saga section and say those same words and then see what happens to you - haha. Those folks over there are passionate about the untouched classic of Star Wars and maybe some purists would tend to lean on the same mindset for Avatar (wanting to opt to see the original version just for the fun of it). Purists love to have the option of an original version simply for being loyal to it. We know there aren't any additional extra scenes in that movie. The only time extra scenes special versions aren't acceptable is if that newer version not only ""adds"" new content but also ""changes"" original content **cough--Star Wars...cough**.

I paid out of pocket to see this movie 5 times in the theaters and, in some cases, even paid for others to join me. So, by far and large, I have no issues with multiple versions in this boxset so as long as I have the original as well simply because I'm a fan. ""The More, The Merrier"", right? Now if you like Special Features, this is right up there with the Lord of the Rings Extended special features in breadth, scope & depth of information.

Buy this boxset.

And for those complaining about ""why did they have to include the DVD original disc in here when I already bought that version the first time around""......do your homework. It was public information BEFORE the first version blu-ray was released that there would be subsequent, more feature-filled releases. So it was optional to purchase the feature-less DVD/Blu-ray or you could've just waited, like I did, and forgo all pointless versions until this Extended Collector's Edition was released. So I only own one copy of Avatar on Blu-ray and that's this copy. Patience is a virture, my friends.

Great product and great fanbase.

3932161,5,B002HEXVUI,"After re-viewing Avatar(released Dec/09),not having seen it since its initial theatrical run,I am still impressed beyond words with the films epic scope and sweep. It is a dazzling combination of real actors combined with digital S/FX and animation. Of course the metaphors abound here as the planet Pandora refers to the infamous box when once disturbed releases all manner of troubles for man,the box here being the populace of the planet. Then there is the precious Unobtanium the mining company is after,as in unobtainable. In fact that along with the dialogue could be considered low grade stuff on a quality scale if put under the critical microscope,but it is the journey of its protagonist and this magnificent new world and its inhabitants that we come to discover,that raise the bar right into the stratosphere. The Na`Vi themselves,blue and 10 feet tall with cat like eyes and a tail,the plethora of strange creatures that inhabit the ground world and world of the air,the small touches like the bio-luminescence of forest floor when they walk on it at night,the small white floating creatures with wavy tendrils,the sacred floating islands of the air and so much more. It all adds up to a spectacularly wonderful and epic spectacle not seen on the screen before,that one cannot seem to get enough of. It is not surprising then that they re-released this film with far more footage. They did a three disc edition that I reviewed,with three different versions,including the original theatrical version. However its`faulty packaging that made the discs severely prone to scratching kyboshed that release,bigtime,and I sent mine back for a refund. But recently I thought I would pick this one up just to at least have the original version,and I`m glad I did.
The story involves a former Marine named Jake Sully who is sent to the planet Pandora,who is a wheelchair bound parapalegic. He is replacing his dead brother in the avatar program,which has been seeking to bond with the planets inhabitants,but so far with little success. The humans in the program lie in an electronic tube and they remotely operate/enter a genetically produced Na`vi,a native of Pandora. These avatars have been ``grown`` with DNA culled and combined from humans and Na`vi. The mining company on the planet also has a security contingent there who are just a trigger pull away from going in with guns blazing if things don`t move ahead faster.
Sully is initially used by the security firm as a mole and to provide inside intel on the progress with the Na`vi and their intentions. As Sully gets farther and farther involved with the Na`vi and even falls in love with the local tribes chiefs`daughter,all bets are off. The company has become impatient and now are on the move to forcibly evict the Na`vi from their homes,under which lies the precious mineral the company seeks. Sully is now with them in mind and spirit and he helps to defend the Na`vi.`Several instances almost cause a break between Sully and the tribe but in the end he is in there,uniting many tribes on the planet and actually leading the fight against the company. The showdown comes to its inevitable conclusion and the Na`vi regain their freedom and planet back. The humans,except for a chosen few,are expelled from Pandora. Jake is transformed into a real Na`vi with the help of the peoples sacred tree.
Technically the film is in its original w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras in this single disc edition. That`s why I say it is served straight up.
All in all a highly recommended Sci-Fi fantasy of epic proportions. You will revel in the fascinating flora,fauna and peoples of Pandora and the protagonists` winning over and eventual joining with its people. It doesn`t get much better than this.",1325289600,,3783,4.931034482758621
3932162,1,B002HEXVUI,"Would love to say first that if there was a rating below one this movie would have got it.
I was highly excited by the release footage,especially the combat scenes between Marines and Navi prior to film's release. But the Star Wars films, especially the battle scenes were and are, far better still!!!!!
The dvd is well made especially the THX sound and picture quality on dvd and Blu Ray but that is it. Oh,Sam Worthington and Stephen Lang are great protagonists in film,but everything ,especially a wasted Sigourney Weaver,Michelle Rodriguez, and those pathetic Navi turned me off this franchise forever.
The film promised so much after seeing the list of films directed by Jim Cameron on the trailers but the film sucked everyone into watching it with a smart advertising campaign and the release of 3D.
WETA and ILM are masters at CGI,but I feel the indigenous characters and the planet Pandora  left the film flat. These visual effects companies were expected to blow air into a rotting corpse.
Cameron hired young and old actors(great mostly) except Zoe Saldaana and wasted everyone of them with needless deaths. I really wanted to embrace this film but felt deflated,angry and empty save for 3D experience.
To think that this film made over 2 billion dollars shows that there were many people duped into watching this film through the hype played on all media counts,remember Batman 2/ Dark Knight?

One other item that we appreciate is that it does not have all the advertising that comes with so many movies today. We find those bothersome because a month after you have the new movie all the movie trailers that came as advertising are old and out dated. It takes us 10 minutes to fast forward past the advertising and we find that annoying.

The story is a combination of the history of the American settlers and the Native Americans crossed with Star Wars.  This may sound trite, but the story and the acting are both better than anything in Lucas' six films.  The plot is very predictable, but it does not ruin the experience.  I found the ending to be satisfying if not surprising.  If you are looking for something plot driven that will keep you guessing, this will likely disappoint you.

 1. NOT Wide Screen
====================

Although Amazon's listing for this item clearly states that it is ""Widescreen"", it is absolutely NOT!  Note the last word in the following descripton line.

  ""Format: Blu-ray, Special Extended Version, Color, ...
  ... Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, Dubbed, Subtitled, Surround Sound, Widescreen""

Several lines further down in the description is the proof that it is NOT widescreen.  Note the ""1.78"" aspect ratio shown in the snippet below.

  ""Aspect Ratio: 1.78:1""

... What it really is! ...

This item is actually a cropped/panned version edited to fit on a 16:9 HD screen. That eliminates the sweeping panoramas this movie is famous for.  I can see no excuse for such an error.  Anyone close to the movie distribution business knows these basic things.  It seems more likely the distributor wanted to dump excess inventory with an erroneous description.  The only thing ""wide"" about it is that, being High-Def 16:9 Digital TV, it is ""wider"" than old Standard-Def 4:3 NTSC Analog TV. That's not saying much.

... How different is it really? ...

Like most modern widescreen epics, this movie's original theatrical aspect ratio is around 2.40:1. That is quite a bit wider than the 1.85:1 (17:9) ratio used on mainstream movies and MUCH wider than the 1.78 (16:9) ratio of this version which was cropped/panned to fill an HD TV screen without letterboxing.

So, what's with all the ""?:9"" ratios?  Since the exact aspect ratio of HD was chosen to be 1.78:1 (for both technical and industry reasons), 16:9 (16-ninths) turns out to be the closest whole number fraction that equals that decimal ratio.  Now that consumers have become familiar with HD TV's 16:9 aspect ratio, it is less confusing to convert other decimal ratios into the closest 9th's fraction so they can mentally compare them to the 16:9 of HD rather then use yet another odd whole number fraction that more closely fits the exact decimal ratio.

... Conclusion ...

This was a HUGE disappointment.  Making matters worse it that Amazon doesn't even carry the Widescreen version even though smaller ecommerce behemoths like KMart, Sears, Walmart, and Target all do.  The difference to look for is the proper version's listed title actually has ""WIDESCREEN"" in it and, most importantly, the product detail lists the aspect ratio closer to ""2.40"".  Go to Walmart.com and search for ""Avatar Widescreen"" and you'll see the correct product listed there.

If you are not that serious about cinema, hate letterboxing, don't mind cutting out parts of the image, and just want your media to fill your HD screen without bars or distortion, then this item may be OK for you.  However, if you do care for such things then you will feel totally ripped off. Stay away.

If I get my hands on the true widescreen (uncropped) version, I'll review it then.

================
 2. Delay Issue
================

Despite the atrocious cropping, we did try to do a quick review of the movie's features but we had SEVERE play issues when inserted into our new Samsung BD-D6700 Blu-Ray player which we bought so we could so we could also do some streaming.  On the very first insertion after the player was installed, it took a whopping 4 Minutes just to get to the opening movie scene.  We initially got a black screen for 1.5 minuites, then the FBI WARNING for 30 seconds, then another 1 minute of waiting while we watched a small animated ""20th Century"" icon in the center of the screen, then another 30-60 seconds, then the opening scene.  That is an insane anmount of time that few could put up with.  After several exits and replays the time shrunk significantly but it still took over a minute to get to the opening scene.  Since this player is rated as one of the fastest, we suspect there is a an operational compatibility issue between the Samsung and this disc.

After some additional pondering of the delay issue, we suspect it is a combination of Samsung bugs and the disc's BD-Live content.  The player may be responding to triggers in the disc to access BD-Live net content as it plays and changes chapters.  There also seems to be no way to turn off BD-Live ... at least on the Samsung.  It does have a setting to ""prohibit"" BD-Live network access but, when enabled, that makes things even worse because the Samsung still allows the disc to access the net then pops an error that you have to clear with an [OK] that says ""BD-Live network access has been prohibited"". That's the GUI equivalent of entrapment! Argh!

[Update] Following our initial test of this Avatar disc, we tested a widescreen version of Avatar (purchased at the same time from Amzonon) on the same Samsung BD-D6700.  That disc played perfectly with the only delay being, as expected, between insertion and the 1st image.  That took roughly 30 seconds, an good time for BD discs. Subsequent replays while inserted were faster still.

==================
 3. Quality Issue?
==================

Although we did not spend much time testing the image quality of this disc due to it being the wrong edition, we did notice what seemed to be an image quality problem.  The best way to describe it is to liken it to the effect you get when you watch a program that is pre-letter boxed with a matte border so it fits both SD and HD displays.  They do this when budget is an issue as is the case with the grossly underfunded PBS network.  This is where the main image is actually less than total image size, much like a matted photo or painting.  As such, the image can be forced to fit both SD and HD screens by the various settings of a TV's Aspect control such as Crop, Full, Fit, or Zoom.  They all mean different things on different TV's.  The problem is that by expanding such a program, you are enlarging a smaller image with lesser pixels to fill a larger screen with more pixels.  The result is an image that seems slightly unsharp, mushy, or fuzzy.  You cannot make 2 image pixels fill 3 screen pixels without playing geometry games that destroy sharpness.

We suspect this loss of quality may have been a byproduct of the crop/pan process.  Although all the pixels should be there when they cropped it horizontally, we suspect that, for artistic balance, they may have also cropped vertically to better balance the final framing.  If true, that then means they would have ended up with too few pixels for a 1-to-1 mapping to an HD screen and would have had to resort to enlargement which, of course, mushes the image sharpness.  Add to those foibles, the problem of panning an image that was already panned, and the image degrades even more.  Please note, however, that these issues are unlikely to be severe enough to make them noticeable to anyone other than those who are into cinematic image quality.  E.g., some of our friends and family don't really notice or care about such things.

====================
 Review Bottom Line
====================

If you want a fast playing, widescreen, Blu-ray version of this movie, we suggest you look for an edition where the item's main catalog title has ""WIDESCREEN"" in it and, if possible, without ""BD-Live"".  There seems to be a growing play-delay issue with BD-Live content and some of the more advanced Blu-ray players.  The delays may have something to do with:

(1) BD-Live content is provided over the web by the movie studios and may expire or not always be available (a growing problem with limited life ""cloud-based"" apps)

(2) Complex multitasking that occurs while a disc plays and the player concurrently load BD-Live content in background to its internal cache

We conjecture that since OEM's rightly place movie viewing as a top priority, they perform the primary BD-Live content loading prior to, or in between, the leading ""fluff"" chapters like trailers, FBI warning etc, studio logos, etc.  That hypothesis would completely explain our horrendous and unacceptable delays when this edition when paired with a Samsung BD-D6700 BD-Live.

3932178,5,B002HEXVUI,"Let me first squash some of the negative reviews that some previous reviewers have posted.

First: At no time, are you forced to change disks mid movie. The entire movie, all three versions (yes I have watched them all), are on the first disk.

Second: There were no scratches on my disks. I can see how this ""may"" be a hit or miss, but how the packaging was made, if they were taken out and put back in correctly, you will not scratch them.

Third: If you try and play this movie on a blue-ray player that is not brand new and you have not updated it, chances are it will not work... well what does that mean? That means you need to UPDATE YOUR PLAYER. Plain and simple. Technology will constantly be improving and just like updates for your computer, you need to update your current player's software. Plain and simple.

Now...lets talk about the set itself... in a single day, from 6:30 AM to 8PM, I had this on non-stop. It was that captivating. At first I started with the Director's 3 hour cut version of the film. 16 more minutes than the version we all saw in theaters. Some of the scenes were very helpful in explaining Sam's background and Grace's history with the Na'vi.

For those of you watching this in 1080p, holy smokes! Just stunning images through every frame of the movie. The detail is amazing. A visual shmorgishborg that you'll not soon forget!

I was so enthralled after watching that I dove right into all of the special features. For those of you who have an interest in film creation, this is your honey pot. Hours on end I watched as they went through every element of how they made this movie. There is even a section where you can watch over 45 minutes of the movie in dual windows as the final finished version and the reference cameras used on the performance capture set. I'm not going to spoil it too much for all of you, but that was such a treat.

If you are one of those people who don't watch special features for movies, this one may be the one to break the mold. Some of the little things you'll see show how much DETAIL they insisted on when creating Avatar. Case in point, every piece of Na'vi clothing and jewelry, anything they wore or held or used, was designed and created in real life first, right down to the smallest bead. The attention to detail was mind blowing.

For such an epic movie, all the special features were the perfect accompaniment, to make this an epic Blue-Ray set.

So, for those of you who stayed to the end of this review, I salute you and hope you have a chance to enjoy this set as much as I did!!!

My words can not describe the beauty of the landscape, the animals, and the forest. It still amazes me after watching this film twice. No wonder it got an Oscar in 2010 for Art Direction.

I have been trying for some time to get a copy of Avatar in 3D Blu Ray.  This movie has been out for a while and Panasonic has hooked the only way you can get this Blu Ray with the purchase of certain models of TVs and 3D Blu Ray players.  My son bought a Panasonic TV and was told by the sales people (they had signs up in their windows too) that once he mailed in some ""coupon"" he would received Avatar 3D Blu Ray.  That all turned out to be BS since he didn't buy the right model TV.  His intension was to give me the Blu Ray for Christmas.  I bought my 3D TV a couple years ago and even though it was not a Panasonic TV I did finally buy a Panasonic 3D Blu Ray player and even though I spent over $300.00 for it apparently it was not the right model.  This is a great movie and I would really like to have it in my library but this is Panasonic milking this movie for all it's worth.  I have been told that I could buy the Panasonic bundle (2 pair of glasses and Avatar 3D) which I tried to do last night but it is no longer available.  If you can find this bundle package it cost close to $400.00.  Now I'm hearing that the Blu Ray will be out in Feb 2012.  I will buy this movie if it ever is released (at a reasonable price)without all the extra stuff but I will never buy ANY another Panasonic product again.  I have a feeling that there are many people out there that feel the same way.  Great PR there Panasonic!",1323388800,3,1544,3.9387096774193546

3932189,5,B002HEXVUI,"The Avatar 3D movie is a stunningly beautiful WORK OF ART!  (It includes a 2D version as well as the 3D)
I am proud to have as part of my movie collection. I was lucky enough to get on when I bought a Panasonic HDTV this year. But not everyone was so lucky and I know that many people want to purchase this movie. My review is not focused on how great the 3D version is(but it is), you can read this in other reviews, but on how best to go about getting this movie sooner rather than later.
(Note: you can check the list of other 3D movie releases with release dates in the FIRST COMMENT after this review)

Some of you may want this movie right now and not want to wait until 2012 when Panasonic's rights to the Avatar 3D theatrical version expire(Feb 29, 2012). And yes, that is the only version you can buy right now, the 3D theatrical version. There is no extended 3D version yet.

Yes, the prices on e-Bay are high, but the good news is that they are going down or fluctuate all the time. More copies are flooding the market as Panasonic is offering free copies for the purchase of 3D TV's, 3D Blu-ray Kits and Blu-ray players.

Seven months ago you couldn't buy the Avatar 3D blu-ray on e-Bay for under $129. Three months ago you couldn't buy one for under $109. Now, as of 11-26-11 copies are daily being sold for auction in the range of $65-$85; but to get these you usually have to bid on them.

Don't buy a copy here on Amazon from 3rd party sellers, you have no buyer protection. You can buy from sellers that sell ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" but their prices are just too high here right now at $149.99. Some people worry about buying on e-Bay and getting knock-offs, well the same thing could happen here on Amazon from 3rd party sellers. Almost anyone can sell on Amazon these days. e-Bay has a very good complaint process which always works in the favor of the buyer.

If you're not that familiar with e-Bay, set up an e-Bay account and a PayPal account and start watching the auctions daily. Doing this obligates you to nothing. This will give you a chance to learn about e-Bay. Prices vary from day to day and week to week.

I suggest you set up an account right away because you might get lucky, see something at around $60 bucks and want to jump on it. But don't be in a rush to buy. Make sure you understand how e-Bay works. Also, decide what you're willing to pay and watch for it. If you miss out on one that looked good, no worries, another will come along. Look for sellers with 100% seller ratings and realize that if you bid and win you will be expected to pay for it; usually through PayPal and usually within 4 days.

Use your spare time on e-Bay reading through the ""Learning Center"", ""Answer Center"" and community forums so that you understand the bidding/payment process and go in with eyes open.

Another option is craigslist. I see some in my area going for $75-$85. Realize that people who sell on craigslist usually ask a higher price than they are willing to take. Try to make personal contact by phone if possible; people tend to ignore e-mails if they get too many. See if they will take a lower offer, but make it reasonable. Even if you agree to their price, when you come to pick it up, be friendly and ask if they will take $5 or $10 less. Sometimes this will work, sometimes not.

Obviously, you can always wait until after Feb, 2012 if this all sounds too expensive for you OR if you just refuse to buy this as a matter of principle. The 3D theatrical version may indeed be available for around $20(doubtful) by then, which will be a good deal. Of course, I'm guessing that's when the 3D extended version will be released creating yet another dilemna for those of us who want to enjoy this movie in 3D.

Please don't mark this review down as ""unhelpful"" as I'm only trying to help people get a copy of this epic movie at a fair price and pass on what I have learned about how e-Bay, craigslist and Amazon work.

UPDATES:
Observation I made on 9-18-11:
e-Bay prices for Avatar 3D are now at $40-$70 if you are willing to bid, watch & wait.
""Buy It Now"" and ""Best Offer"" prices on e-Bay are roughly $65 - $70 if you watch and wait; if you can't wait they can easily be purchased for around $85.
(Your best chance for a low price is in an auction ending on a weekday.)
Craigslist prices are fluctuating wildly between $50 and $100 depending on where you live.
Current Amazon prices are $103-$189 ---> ridiculous overpricing & no buyer protection unless you buy one of the ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" ones. As of today, the only ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" one is $189 which is pure profit to the seller.

11-27-11: When you shop on e-Bay look for sellers that have a 100% rating and a Feedback score of about 30-100+. These are almost always individuals selling their extra free copies of the DVD. Avoid sellers with 0 Feedback unless you're very familiar with e-Bay. Don't buy the copies that come from CHINA; there's lots of them out there right now. Make sure that the listing description clearly states that it is the 3D version. It's best if you see they have included a picture of the actual product they possess as compared to a stock picture. If you are unsure about a listing ask the seller a question. They usually respond quickly. If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is and you should skip it. You should easily be able to pick up a copy now in the $68-$90 price range. I saw someone that snagged a copy at around $20 recently.

3-6-12: THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY:
THE GOOD: Since Panasonic's exclusive rights to the movie ended Feb. 29, everyone is trying to sell their copy on e-Bay, hoping they are selling it before the movie is released to the public for a lot less. There are over 450 brand new copies of Avatar 3D up for auction right now, so the supply is extremely good.  Right now may be an excellent time to start watching e-Bay/craigslist for deals. I've seen at least 3 sell for $44-$55 in the last week or so.

THE BAD: Since Panasonic is no longer offering Avatar 3D free with the purchase of HDTV's, Blu-ray players and 3-D Kits, the supply will slowly decrease, causing prices on e-Bay to slowly start rising again until the movie is released. The question is, when WILL the movie be released? No one knows for sure. No release date has been announced.

THE UGLY: If you were expecting a March or April release of Avatar 3D, you can probably forget about that. There are rumors, and they are just that, RUMORS, that the 3D movie may not be released until Fall to coincide with Black Friday. The only upside is there are also rumors that the next release will be 16 minutes longer. So it may be some sort of slightly extended cut.",1322265600,11,6700,4.360064153969527

3932193,4,B002HEXVUI,"I saw this movie in 3D in theaters and I was blown away by the visuals. While the story follows a familiar formula (""Dances with Wolves"" + ""FernGully"") and many of the characters so far (it is a trilogy) are pretty one-dimensional, it makes up for this with great performances using groundbreaking motion capture technology. It was very easy to get immersed in the world of Pandora and suspend disbelief. The acting is great, and despite a story that has been done before (""white hero goes native and saves the day"") I found myself genuinely moved by several scenes. The extended collector's cut is a much better film than the original release, it gives more context for why things happen the way they do and it starts out much better.

As for the DVD set, you get 3 versions of the film. You get the original theatrical release, the special edition re-release with 8 minutes of additional footage, and the collector's extended cut with 16 minutes of additional footage. You also get a fascinating making of documentary, 45 minutes of deleted scenes in various states of completion, and the option of a 'family audio track' with the naughty words removed.

I have an issue with how they split up each version of the film across 3 DVDs. It works like this: you insert disc 1, choose which version of the movie you want to watch, watch it until it tells you to insert disc 2, then same thing insert disc 3. It's clear they did this to avoid having to produce 4 DVDs instead of 3, but it really breaks up the experience of watching the movie and takes you out of it, exactly what you don't want when watching a movie like this. I would have been willing to pay a little more for 4 DVDs where they put each film on it's own DVD and put the extras on DVD 4. I'm sure most other fans of the film would as well. Alternately, they could have done away completely with the special edition re-release and just included the original release and the collector's cut. That's my only complaint about it.",1321920000,3,1989,4.49171270718232

However, you can get it before 2/12 by buying certain Panasonic models of BluRay players and 3D capable TVs...or you can do what I did, and spend eighty bucks for it on eBay. I suggest waiting. That aside, while this movie is beautiful in 2D, it is unbelievably breathtaking in 3D. The 3D effects are second to none. I watched this on my 65"" TV, and while watching, it appeared as though the holograms were 3 or 4 feet into my viewing room. The little spinning dandilion things looked like they were coming over my shoulders and moving toward the screen. Was it worth 80 bucks?

3932201,5,B002HEXVUI,"I first saw Avatar at the Movie theater in 3d and boy how I was impressed the visuals of this action/Scifi movie are incredible and its no surprise with the technology they used to make this movie and the huge budget this movie has. The  story is actually quit simple these blue smurff like people live in this jungle lets say they are afraid of people cause they have let them down before. This guys wants to be a test subject and see what its like too get meet these indigeniouse people of the forest. jack Sully is very interested in learning as much as he can about these creatures but unfurtunally the generall not only wants too learn about these people he wants to destroy them and there home planet. James Cameron is such  a great directer. I was so disapionted that this movie wasn't in 3d but its still a great movie non the less. My favorite part of this epic film is when the humans battle the smurff like people its just such an epi fight that you won't want too miss. I think that for the money put into this movie they coudn't have done a better job making it. I think that the actors ast to play the parts of each charactor are inccredibly gifted in what there doing. I have watched this movie over over 20 times its that fantastic!!!!!!!!!!! I find this movie too be incredibly long and I really like that about this film for being over 2 hours and 30 minutes its one of the longest movies yet to date

  When I first saw it as I mentioned before I watched it with my mom and she normally doesnt like SciFi films but with all the hype out about this film she thought she would give it a try and boy my mom loved it. My older brother didn't like it but like with every movie no matter how great it is there is always gonna be some hatter hattin on it. For everybody that gave this film less  then 4 stars I think don't like scifi films but too each his or her own ause this is the most own movie of all time along with ountless others this movie stands on its own with everything it throws at you yes there is some blood and some swearing but thats only too further the story and make the people look like true warriors this film is one of my altime favorites a must buy. My least favorite part which is hard too pick out of this incredible film is when the humans destroy the home tree too the smurff people but I love how in the end they wind up getting there reenge on them for what pain and destruction they hae caused to them. Dont you just like Scifi films?

  This film in my mind should win 10 plus academy awards for being so great and incredible. This film I have heard is supposed to get a sequal. I hope james Cameron can outdo this film. With how great and spectacular he made it that won't be an easy task. What make the next movie over 3 hours and add more story to it and get more of a background on the blue people. This movie in my opionion will be remembered for ages and ages too come much like star wars a classic in every way imaginable. Avatar makes me wonder what it would be like if we had smurff like people on earth would they get along with us? Would they fear us? would they run from us? or would they be our friends?  This movie is one every movie buff should add too  his or her collection. At the movie theatre i saw this film out almost the whole theatre was jam packed with people that just gos too show you how magnificient and inredible this film truly is. I find Jacks new girlfriend to be quit the heroic one in this film

  cause she doesnt run from trouble she knows how too take down the bad guys and is quit the catch this movie. I love the action in this movie and I find it too be so fast paced and stupendous.  The pacing in this film is great and well balanced I would like there too be 2 more sequels too this film cause it has such a great story that you could expand on

  movie after movie until the audience watching it gets sick and tired of seeing blue people in movies. You will know this movie is even better when other directors make knockoffs of it that means its an idea that is guarenteed to do well. I find this film to be one of the best films of the 20th century incredible in every imaginable. A true sci fi buffs dream movie!!!!!!

  The sets in this film are so cool and beutifull. The animals are both intrigingand scary at the same time Jack Sully soon realizes in this film what it means too be one with the blue people. He lets them down at first but they get over it and he soon enough later on in the film becomes part of the team because of won very wise and brave some would say stupid thing he did to win back there trust and fight bak against his own kind who lied too him about what they were all about. There will be revenge and the blue people reign supreme too the bitter end But at first they face a big loss too there home alas.",1320796800,,4825,4.084656084656085
3932202,1,B002HEXVUI,"Seriously, I can't believe how bad this movie was.  I stuck up for Cameron with Titanic, which I thought had some redeeming qualities, and I loved his underwater documentaries, The Abyss, Terminator, and Terminator 2.  With Avatar, alas, no dice.  This movie was visually impressive, but still fake looking to me.  The plot was horrendous.  The dialogue pathetic.  I had high expectation and figured even worst case scenario, it would be entertaining and look cool.  Visually, it was decent, but that alone was not enough to keep me from bashing my forehead into the movie seat in front of me.  Have we advanced so little in movie writing that the best we can do is copy Dances with Wolves and Return of the Jedi (ewok war)?  Should have been called Dances with Smurfs.  Waterworld and Battlefield Earth are both worth watching more than this dreadful flick.

I do not like this movie.  The notion, as put forth by this movie, is that malicious corporations destroy the habitat of an entire planet.  With this story, the movie pushes the ultimate in politically correct (and wrong!) hyperbole.

I got this movie simply to see for myself just how nice blu ray on 1080P can look and I can't get the grin off my face. Not many movies were shot in high def digital w/o compression ruing them, this is one of the very very few. So if you want to see things the way they were intended - this is a great way.

I updated the firmware on my new player the day i got it (most recent firmware is July 2011). Pop in the Avatar disc 1 and no dice. Turns out after research this DRM movie from Fox WILL NOT WORK ON A BRAND NEW BluRay player. Am returning this $40 waste of time as soon as possible. And if Amazon fights me because the package is opened I will quote their own website to them [...] which shows their troubleshooting tips for DVD/BluRay and they recommend returning the disc if it won't play on two players (which obviously means you've opened it).

Amazon/Fox - if your product obviously doesn't work on even a brand new, up to date player intended to play BluRay discs....put that disclaimer on the product description! That way I look at a different version (DVD) and don't waste my time and yours returning a BluRay disc that doesn't work in a BluRay player (still ridiculous to write that sentence). I'm a heavy heavy purchaser from Amazon and this is the first time I've been disappointed and needed to return something.

Who knew I'd have to read reviews on BluRay discs to make sure they'll work in a BluRay player...this is ridiculous. Partially considering returning the player as well if this is going to be a recurring problem with BluRay!",1320105600,2,1338,4.589958158995816
3932209,1,B002HEXVUI,"One of the most hyped movie ever. Saw it and boy is it disappointing. Sure the graphics are great and but you would think that for all that money they would get a story writer.

The movie is just one unending series of cliches that just don't stop. No story, just the usual gop of good simple natives, bad mean greedy foriegners and a lump of science bashing. And as you might imagine, the simple natives win but not before exposing that the greedy guys will stop at no cruelty to get their money. In the end nature (or God) all pulls together and whips the tar out of the bad guys. Whooppee, chalk one up for the good guys and kiss your 10 bucks goodye.",1319846400,5,654,4.190476190476191
3932210,1,B002HEXVUI,"I saw this in the theaters in 3D -ooh, aah. I rented it when it came out on DVD (you know, those things that hypocrite director, one James Cameron, says are destroying the planet?). My sister got this version and I borrowed it. Why? Don't know... Stupid I guess. Just like anyone who buys into the premise of this movie.

Look, the visuals and effects are stunning, no doubt -Cameron may be a hypocrite but an innovator he is. The movie shows us that the American military (I assume there is still an America in the movie's timeline) are basically a bunch of mercenary thugs. Then it shows how we humans are horrible and destroy everything and want to kill everything around us. Wow -haven't seen this before. In my opinion I found it to be a cross between ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""The Matrix"" -without any redeeming qualities. The political allusions were more than prevalent -Cameron makes his point clear without being overt.

The premise is humans suck and need to be beaten up to learn our lesson. So my review premise is this: James Cameron's last really good film was ""Aliens"" (Titanic & T-2 were decent) but this movie is a tired retread of past ideas mashed into a horrible stew of crap. It sucked -a visually stunning, effects laden pile of crap with a tree-hugging, Gaia-is-mad-at-you plot. Lovely... save your money and buy the far superior ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" -though not as exciting, it will stimulate your mind in a far more creative way and has a better story.",1319587200,,1481,4.6273764258555135
3932211,5,B002HEXVUI,"I have a new found respect for James Cameron.

Sure, this is an environmental allegory, without the pretense of fiction. It's blatant and in-your-face. Despite the corny name for the film's McGuffin (the heavy natural magnetic ore called unobtanium) and obvious parallels to the real-world problems faced by older cultures (native Americans, Brazilian tribes et al) we are treated to a new world that faces the same problems as anyone else. That, and the crazy-cool computer graphics for everything from the beasts and natives of the world of Pandora to frikkin' mech suits. We are revisited by Sigourney Weaver and once again she brings on a powerful persona into the film. But the real magic is in Sam Worthington portraying disabled military veteran who refuses to quit. The characters are all obvious stereotypes, but we love them anyway. The range of emotion for the entire film is incredible despite the similarities with other films such as Dances with Wolves and The Last Samurai.

This gem of a BR release contains three versions of the film, theatrical, special edition re-release, and the collector's extended cut. There is a large portion of folk who were unhappy with the re-release, but a vehemently voice of praise for the extended edition. Plus, these films are made to be 'family friendly', and so the theatrical and special editions both have a language filter. And that's just what's on the first disc. The other two are swamped with all manner of behind the scenes, extensive interviews, nearly an hour of deleted scenes, and tons more. I imagine most folk will buy this set for the three versions of the film, but film geeks like me get to enjoy all the tid-bits that every BD should come with.

And apparently, this film is the first in a trilogy. If you ask me, they have a very high benchmark they need to obliterate. The ending of Avatar is, in my eyes, nigh-perfection.

All in all, this is without a doubt one of the greatest BD releases to this day. A close second being Close Encounters of the Third Kind. It is hard to catch the lightning in a bottle, and very few films seem able to do just that. Avatar not only catches the lightning, but it throws it back in your face, making you question the material driven nature of mankind and the natural simplicity we seem to have left behind many years ago.

Here's to the newest epic, on par with Star Trek, better than Star Wars, and more grandeur than the Lord of the Rings. This BD is incredible, and it's only sin is an apparently left behind Gag Reel. But it may very well be within the Live features.

3932212,5,B002HEXVUI,"For those who have always wondered about ""is there other life out there"", Avatar is the movie that will have you really wondering. Pandora is the name of the planet, and the imagery used in this movie is so breathtaking. It's about a former marine who is paralyzed whose twin brother is participating in the ""Avatar Program"", but dies and the program wants this ex marine to fill in for his deceased brother. The avatar program is a mixing of human dna and the natives dna to form an avatar. It is a living and breathing creature, and when it's human operator ""sleeps"", they are operating the avatar and are mingling with the natives. It's a non stop action movie and James Cameron definitely created another winner with this movie.

3932214,5,B002HEXVUI,"At its core, this film shares a great deal with an animated film called 'Ferngully: The Last Rainforest'.

In it, there is someone working for a major corporation that is trying to destroy a rainforest, along the way he comes across the creatures that inhabit the forest (fairies) and through sheer accident begins to see life from their perspective and ultimately fights with them to defend their home.

That is what 'Avatar' is in a nutshell, but there is a great deal more to consider with this epic sci-fi adventure.  There is a lot to be said about respecting native cultures, respecting the environment, the evils of corporate beaucracy, the closemindedness of the military, etc.  In this film, we are seeing humanity at its worst, but this is no sudden revelation.  There is nothing in this movie that doesn't already reflect some of the basic truths within our own history.  The exploitation of native cultures, the destruction of civilizations, the raping of the land...  much of own history is filled with these very things.

The movie itself even showcases how even after we have drained our own planet of its natural resources, we will have no qualms about doing the same exact thing on other worlds.

I love this movie, because there are deep spiritual themes that run throughout, in addition to showcasing some basic fundamental truths about how we are doomed to destroy ourselves unless we learn to respect ourselves as well as others.

The special effects utilized to bring the world of Pandora to life, they are absolutely phenomenal.  James Cameron truly outdid himself with this film, because he managed to utilize CGI as a necessity in order to tell his story, but in many ways, did it without it looking too obviously fake (Star Wars Prequels?).

A movie such as this wouldn't work unless you had some top notch actors involved to make you give a damn about what is going on, and this film has that in spades.

Not because of anything sad, but because of the total grandeur, the spectacle, the music, the script, the story and the breathtaking visual effects. This was the greatest artistic achievment I had ever seen. Here is a complete description of this 3 disc set (revised & updated):

The first 2 discs give you the option of watching the Original Theatrical Version, the Special Edition Re-Release version or the All New 3 hour Collector's Extended Cut with 16 minutes of additional footage. On disc 3 is an exclusive alternate opening on Earth, a documentary entitled: ""Capturing Avatar"" which is an in depth feature length documentary covering the filmmaker's journey including all new interviews with James Cameron, Jon Landau, cast and crew. Also is over 45 minutes of never before seen deleted scenes, and a Family Audio Track with all objectionable language removed.

The never before seen film footage is from the following scenes:Scene 19 ""Stingbat Attack"", Scene 20 ""Pandora Rules"", Scene 21 ""Jake Meets Norm (first take), Scene 26 ""Jake Sees Decanted Avatars, Scene 30 ""Norm is a Living God"", Scene 35A ""Breakfast with the Scientists"", Scenes 36A-37 ""You'r in My World Now"", Scene 64 ""Grandma's Teylu, Scene 79 ""Pied Piper"", Scenes 81B-D ""Going to the Mountains"", Scene 81K ""Interspecies Booty Call"", Scene 91 ""Norms Attitude Improves"",Scene 95A-98 ""Learning Montage Cut"" (early cut), Scene 120A ""We're Buying Time"", Scenes 122-125 ""Hunt Festival"", Scene 131 ""Driving Range"", Scenes 131A-148 ""The Dreamhunt"", Scenes 164-172 ""The Challenge"", Scenes 174-178 ""The Drums of War"" (full version), Scene 209-211 ""Escape"",Scene 224A ""The Eye of Eywa"", Scene 232 ""You'r a Long Way from Earth"", Scenes 235-236 ""Battle Camp"", Scene 248 ""Kick Some Blue Ass"", Scene 277 ""Wainfleet Kills Norm"", Scenes 288-327 "" The Avatar Attack"", Scenes 350-351 ""New Life"".Also on disc 3 you can have direct access to the additional footage from the Special Edition Re-release, or from the Collectors Extended Cut.

At the end of disc 2 is an interesting documentary entitled: ""A Message from Pandora"" about an actual situation in the Amazon rainforest where 25000 indigenous natives will soon be homeless because of the Brazil governments decision to build the Belo Monte hydro electric dam under the pretext that 11000 mega watts (which will require more dams) is needed for Rio de Janero and Sao Paulo, when in reality that energy will mainly be used by extractive industries. The Brazil government is indifferent to the fact that Solar, Wind, Smart Grid and especially Instream turbines could easily provide the same amount of energy.(but those sources will not finance re election campaigns however).

I wouldnt be without both the extended 3 disc set and the single disc version however, since you may sometimes not want to have to leave your seat to change discs. Truly a miracle of magnificence is the best way to describe this incredible achievment.",1315872000,2,3041,5.137373737373737

The discs are sitting on a flap of hard paper or something, so to avoid getting scratches on it, all you have to do is pull the flap out and then get the disc, not that bad. The breaks in between the movies really isn't that bad, all you have to do is switch the disc. I haven't looked at all the contents on the third disc, but I'm sure there amazing too. Overall, I think this was a worthy purchase. Definitely worth the money, such a fantastic movie. Oh, and I hate 3D effects in movies, I think they are pointless.

3932242,4,B002HEXVUI,"The script of Avatar is an obvious re-telling of the 1904 novel *Green Mansions.*  Maybe Freud was right all along:  There is no originality.  All the elements of the movie are in the novel:  the remnants of a mysterious race of people living in a remote forest where they are threatened by scoundrels trying to exploit the resources of the planet by destroying the ecosystem which is represented by a gigantic root system supporting a huge tree which gets destroyed at the end.

Unfortunately, the emotional impact of the novel does not exist in Avatar. The author of *Green Mansions,* William H. Hudson, made use of a highly effective device to convey his passionate love of nature which was represented by a beautiful seventeen-year-old girl who was probably the last surviving member of her race. Here is how Hudson presented that passion through the words of the story's hero:

""Why, I began to ask myself, was Rima so much to me?  It was easy to answer that question:
Because nothing so exquisite had ever been created.  All the separate and fragmentary beauty and melody and graceful motion found scattered throughout nature were concentrated and harmoniously combined in her. How various, how luminous, how divine she was! A being for the mind to marvel at, to admire continually, finding some new grace and charm every hour, every moment, to add to the old.  And there was, besides, the fascinating mystery surrounding her origin to arouse and keep my interest in her continually active.

That was the easy answer I returned to the question I had asked myself.  But I knew that there was another answer--a reason more powerful than the first.  And I could no longer thrust it back, or hide its shining face with the dull, leaden mask of mere intellectual curiosity.  Because *I loved her;* loved her as I had never loved before, never could love any other being, with a passion which had caught something of her own brilliance and intensity, making a former passion look dim and commonplace in comparison--a feeling known to everyone, something old and worn out, weariness even to think of. ""

The love story as presented in Avatar was pretty lame compared to that I think.  I wonder if anyone involved in the film genuinely felt the distress of the original author over the impending loss of the rain forest.",1315094400,2,2318,4.80352644836272

Not so much the subject matter but the connection to human flaws, needs and values. It's genuine, not overdone. This version articulates and shows visual images of what we may be losing with quick-fix YouTube and Facebook flash images and dumbed-down movies.

The 3D effects were perfect almost all of the time.  I didn't notice any qhosting, but occasionally found my eyes searching for correct focus in some scenes.  Interestingly, my eyes focussed better when watching those scenes a second time.  I find that watching 3D content really requires yours eyes and brain to operate slightly differently from when watching the real world.

The only thing really good about AVATAR movie itself is the creative world of pandora and the navi, and THE PHOTO-REALISTIC VISUALS, WHICH IS WHY I BOUGHT THE MOVIE.

What I hate about this movie is 1. The story is one of colonialism and prince princess fantasy, white man colonises native americans, one white man fall in love with native princess and fight for her people against the white man, POCAHONTAS has this exact story.
IN SHORT THIS STORY IS A PATHETIC CHILDISH FAIRY TALE FANTASY AND A DISGRACE TO SCIENCE FICTION!!

2. I HATE SPIRITUAL ELEMENTS TO FICTION, WHICH ADDS TO THIS CHILDISH FANTASY, the idea of a REAL DEITY of any kind in a SCI FI is a DISGRACE to science fiction and insults my intelligence. DEITY both in fiction, and deities worshiped by real people are a form OF CONTROL AND DICTATOR SHIP, EVEN IF THAT DEITY IS A PEACEFUL ONE like eywa.

I could think of better stories, like tribal warfare on pandora with creative advanced tech that is primitive by our standards. The story of young navi finding a place on pandora, currupt tribal leaders ect. all FAR better stories than that fantasy.

1. Avatar isn't awfully bad. Withnail and I (W&I) is a great movie.

2. Avatar's sound track is tottaly forgettable. W&I opens with a live version of King Curtis playing a Whiter shade of pale. It is so cool that sharks are making a killing selling the original soundtrack: Be warned this track is not included on the CD included in current editions of W&I...I digress...

3. Avatar has ""amazing computerized special effects"". W&I has a shot of some desirable curtains from Laura Ashley.

4. Avatar is extraordinary similar in plot and script to Disney's Tarzan. In W&I The characters are multi-faceted one is able to identify with all the protagonists.

5. Loads of huffing and puffing in Power Rangers..I mean Avatar. W&I is full of iconic performances. Richard E Grant delivers an unforgettable Hamlet soliloquy.

6. Avatar is full of progressive pretexts (i.e. it's against primitive accumulation)for regressive sub texts (deploys the same dualist modus operandi that justifies primitive accumulation/accumulation by dispossession). W&I is an amoral romp. No bad guys or good guys.

7. Avatar was made on a massive industrial budget. W&I was made on a shoe string.

8. You can buy Avatar for around $10 you can buy W&I for 7c

9. Avatar encourages smoking by reinforcing it's association with emancipation. W&I introduces the Camberwell Carrot. This will encourage the impressionable to engage in origami.

10. Avatar: Serious, luscious, tropical, dry, warm, Always Sunny .. W&I: Hilarious, tragic, grey, torrential rain....",1312934400,,1700,5.65748031496063

3932268,3,B002HEXVUI,"after a couple yrs out,I finally picked this up and watched it.

first of all the good/cool!

the World of Pandora and the Na'vi(sp?) that cameron created IS amazing! this whole AMAZING world full of vibrant glow in the dark colors,filled with deep blues,greens,pinks,purples and the like! truly an AMAZING WORLD!

the Na'vi are very cool looking creatures! the motion capture used to translate the actors faces/bodies' and expressions is very real!!!

now,the suckish stuff:

*spoilers abound below*

this truly is one of the worst plots I have ever seen!
everything is fine to a point...everything about this world Pandora and how is has an ""inter connection"" and all that crap was utterly stupid! whoever came up wit the idea of putting the ""connection thingies"" in a long braid on the back of the Na'vi's head was not thinking!

and then when the Humans attack the 1st ""Tree"" or ""god"" right after the Na'vi figure out that Jake and company are ""fakes""..during this scene we are ""suppose"" to sympathize with the Na'vi and shake a finger at the BAD humans who took down their poor ""god tree"".But I actually was rooting for the HUMANS!!! I was cheering on the humans as they shot the ""tree"" and etc. down!

then the humans re-group and attack again to take out the Na'vi before too many come together and would over power the humans....resulting in a ""Cool"" battle..which was going great until jake ""prays""(or more so begs"" to the ""god""/the actual planet of pandora for help...in which the planet ""hepls"" and sends hundreds of dragon like things to take down huge metal HELICOPTERS and SHIPS...THAT IS JUST PLAIN STUPID!!

then the general almost kills jake,he is then killed my nateri(sp?)!!!

so in the end JakeSully and company forsakes  his OWN RACE and becomes this 17ft Na'vi!!!

Oh and the Na'vi look like INDIANS!! they act,dress,talk and even have the same type of ""gods"" that the Indians have!!!

this is just a REALLY GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS movie with a SUCK-ISH plot about humans invading a place where  INDIAN like blue creatures(that have little thingies in their hair braids)live! tellign us that humans SUCK(funny cause the the people that went to see the movie) and nothing more than greedy SOBs!!

3932282,2,B002HEXVUI,"Alright, I'll give this movie what it deserves--kudos for excellent visuals, edge-of-your-seat action, suspense-filled drama, and even a good amount of comic relief. Yes, this movie was entertaining to watch. It was no doubt a visual feast. Probably not many people would deny that.

However, as many have already mentioned, this is basically a tree-hugger movie. Obviously Cameron is using it to advance some kind of ""Incovenient Truth""-like political agenda. The plot of this movie makes the humans and their technology look like the obvious bad guys, when the native Nav'i were just as much at fault for everything that happened. THEY were the ones with the superiority complex, they were the ones who refused to simply move elsewhere on the planet (mind you there was PLENTY of room for everyone, both human and Nav'i). I mean come on, the humans were just doing their jobs. The company's job was to get as much unobtanium or whatever it was as they could, so that they could pay their employees and said employees could support their families, and so they could serve their own kind as best they can. Oh and HELLO, who spent millions of dollars creating Nav'i Avatars so that they could get a better understanding of the natives? The answer to that should be obvious. The point here is that the humans put all kinds of effort into trying to understand the Nav'i so that they could negotiate a peaceful, mutually beneficial relationship, yet the Nav'i are totally ungrateful and refuse to try to see things from the humans' point of view. Their selfish pride refuses to even CONSIDER the benefits the humans might be able to bring them, automatically assuming that the other race doesn't have anything they could benefit from, when they really don't even know the first thing about human civilization. They are selfish, arrogant and foolish. It's funny how the less you actually know the more you THINK you know? Weird how THAT works, huh. Oh, and then they sent thousands of their own people to their deaths over some stupid tree. Sounds like someone's priorities need rearranging.

Don't get me wrong, violence in an action movie is essential, obviously, but when that violence is not really necessary, that's when it becomes irritating. And what's even worse, the humans lose and are forced to leave. I'm failing to see how that's fair. If Cameron wanted to make the humans out to be the villains and the Nav'i the victims, he should have had the humans simply attacking the Nav'i and killing them by the thousands without even trying to understand them or negotiate with them first. And then the Nav'i should have been the ones putting significant effort into making peace with the humans and only resorting to violence when it became absolutely necessary.

Overall, this movie was entertaining but in the end it left me feeling kind of disturbed rather than entertained. Is this what people really think? Do we really like the idea that technology, military, and corporations are all bad, and that the solution to all our problems is becoming one with nature and worshiping it like a god? Or are we just all extremely shallow people who just like movies for whatever sensory stimuli they provide?

This film was borrowed and in my possession for quite a while and it took me months to finally watch it for free. It just had no appeal for me and actually lived up (or is that down?) to my low expectations.

If I wanted a political movie, I'd look for a documentary. This was basically Cameron's liberal views glossed over by colorful characters and scenes. Apparently audiences really are dumbed down if they find this drivel so entertaining. I still hold out hope that most of the movie going public wants more sophistication in their films.

3932288,5,B002HEXVUI,"As always I'm leaving a review of a specific version because of Amazon's odd policy of lumping them all together.

I am delighted with this version. The 'extended' version was great; just enough additional material to improve it, not so much to overload you. And on the extra features discs there is more material than you could shake a remote control at. Actually if it had been me I would have put some of the deleted scenes in the movie, but that's just opinion.

I'm not sure a lot of people appreciate how influential this movie will be in the future of movie making. The technological advances here are really monumental. Even given that Cameron did not take his eyes off the story which works very well.

I did read a bad review that said that; 1. The movie was leftist propaganda and, 2. it was a remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dances-with-Wolves-20th-Anniversary-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B004AOECTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dances with Wolves (20th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray</a>]. The first is correct as it is well recorded history that Thomas Jefferson often had his slaves strip mining his land at Monticello and John Adams advocated the eradication of indigenous peoples (btw, for those of you who are too literal, I'm being very broadly sarcastic here).

3932295,1,B002HEXVUI,"This is not a review of the movie nor should it be.

This is a review of this 3 disk collector's edition set.

Yes, the extra scenes are cool.  But the fact remains that they tell you on the outside packaging, ""3 disks and 3 versions of the film!""  HA!

Funny how they FAIL to mention that all 3 versions of the film are split up between the first 2 disks.

In other words, at the half way mark (for each of their ""3 versions"") you're left with a screen telling you to insert the 2nd disk.  WTF?!  I guess I just assumed that each disk would hold 1 ""version"" of the film.

BF and I LOVE this movie.  Have seen it countless times on HBO and renting on dvd.  We suck and therefore didn't get to see it in theatres (please release it in theaters AGAIN!!!), but have so much love for the film anyway.

We are appalled at the fact that there is no mention of the fact that your beloved movie is interrupted.

BF and I tend to leave the movies we love in our dvd player and just let them run while we do other stuff around the house (cleaning mostly).  Anyway, it's fun to hear it while you work and to come over and watch certain scenes, etc.

We simply cannot enjoy the movie this way with this ""collector's edition"" set.  You'd think they would realize that collectors want to view their film uninterrupted.  Fools!

bottom line, if I don't get a refund (even tho it's opened) I'm going to be SO FREAKING pi$$ed!

Please don't buy this.  Just get the original.  The extra opening is depressing anyway. And I'm sure the other deleted scenes are online.  or if you must maybe you can borrow from a friend or rent this version.  Just.  so.  disappointed.",1309651200,16,1648,4.2387096774193544
3932296,5,B002HEXVUI,"I saw this movie in the local theater a couple days after its release, and it really engrossed me in the world Cameron & company created. The visuals were beyond anything I expected, and despite the story being a 'Pocahontas' type love story, I felt the visuals and the world it was set in brought it beyond just a simple tale. Anyways, when it was released on Blu-Ray/DVD, I bought the original theatrical version on DVD, not having a system capable of playing Blu-Rays. By the time the extended edition had been released, I had a great HDTV and a decent Blu-Ray player, so I went ahead and bought it. This being my first movie to ever watch on Blu-Ray, it was insane. I never expected the video & sound quality to be so far ahead of the DVD presentation. It really did surprise me.

Moving on, I thought the packaging of this edition was quite decent, and it hasn't fallen apart like many special editions I have picked up over the years. And the fact that they included all three cuts of the film is also a plus; so if you prefer the theatrical or the special edition re-release, you can watch that as well. This set includes a host of special features...from deleted scenes to commentaries, it's jam packed with all sorts of interesting things. And with BD-Live, you get even more.

3932297,1,B002HEXVUI,"The first thing I noticed was that the box is designed to look like a book. Cool right? Wrong. Each ""page"" has a tab that you pull on to get the disc out. The problem with this is that unlike ALL other dvds/blurays, these discs don't hover over plastic; they lay on top of the cardboard box. So upon opening up the brand new movie, I already noticed nasty scratches on every disc.
Secondly, common sense would tell you that if you want a theatrical version and extended version, to put them on separate discs. These guys decided to put both on the same disc, but spread it out over two discs. So whether you're watching the theatrical or extended version, you'll have to change discs halfway through the movie.
Between the scratches that made the movie skip four times the first time I watched it, and the inconvenience of having to get up from my couch to change discs halfway through, I felt I had no choice but to return it. Thankfully,  Amazon ensured me a full refund due to purchasing a ""defective product.""

3932302,5,B002HEXVUI,"From James Cameron comes the epic and fantastic movie, Avatar. Opening in 2009 this movie won the award for ""Best Visual Effects"". This futuristic movie is based on the distant planet of Pandora. James Cameron has made many great movies, this one being one of them. His most famous movies are Terminator 1 & 2, Titanic, The Abyss and Avatar. Some of the famous actors from this movie are Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver (Alien movies).  By no means did this movie not live up to it potential.

Sam Worthington, who plays Jake Sully, falls in love with the beautiful Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). In this movie scientists and militants from earth come to Pandora, a moon which is orbiting the planet Polyphemus, in search of a very wealthy mineral called unobtanium. It funds the whole operation.

In the year 2154, a corporation known as the RDA Corporation mines on the planet Pandora for a valuable mineral known as unobtanium. Pandora is similar to earth. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) tries to become one of the Na'vi people. In the beginning he is only sabotaging the Na'vi people for his kind but soon he falls in love with the female Na'vi Neytiri. After not cooperating the RDA makes their move. Willingly the RDA Corp. tries to destroy the Na'vi's home and succeeds. The Na'vi retaliate. After a long strenuous fight the Na'vi win and send the earthlings home.

From this I think we can all understand that you should not try to fight on foreign territory and that any organism will fight till they die for what they love. Understandably you shouldn't antagonize anybody unless you're sure you can win. Really it's the same with humans as with the Na'vi because we both would fight for our homes.

In my opinion Avatar was the best, most fantastic movie I have ever seen. Granted other people say it sucks but nobody has a legitimate reason why. Some say they don't want to see blue cats run around for two and a half hours. That's definitely not a good reason to not like the movie. Definitely did it have the best special effects and picture I have ever seen. Best movie ever.",1308441600,,2097,4.6567567567567565

3932307,4,B002HEXVUI,"When I first saw this film I was floored by the grandeur and visual effects in this movie when I saw it at IMAX. The level of detail and the vividness of the colors were absolutely amazing. You could almost feel what it was like to be on Pandora while watching the film. My biggest issue with the movie was that anyone that is familiar with Disney's ""Pochahontas"" could very easily predict where the storyline was headed. For an adult at times the film was a yawn due to the inevitability of the plot, but my children and teenage son were enraptured throughout the entire film. My family has re-watched Avatar many times, but without the excitement of 3D and a giant IMAX screen I can't say that it was as thrilling as the first go-round. It is a wonderful movie and I wholeheartedly believe that deserves the accolades it received for breakthroughs in filming technology, however the story telling just isn't there for an adult audience.",1308009600,,938,4.622754491017964

However, something that I hate is the fact that it is 2 parts in the DVD. Although the point where it is divided is pretty okay, I just hate the fact that it is not one disc. I know there is so much that can fit into a DVD and the bluray disc can fit this, I hate this and wish they could have fit it all in one disc.

My only complain is the format of the film's discs, but the overall movie was amazing and can see why this is the most grossed revenue movie in history.",1307664000,2,662,3.860294117647059

3932311,2,B002HEXVUI,"Some films you don't have to see to know they're going to be disappointing and if ever there was a film that was so hyped you knew it would be a let down 'Avatar' is it. OK, so it's a bit lame I haven't seen it till now and I know I'm only watching it on TV not a big 3D screen. In my defence a film should work on its own merits and not require effects like 3D to make it impressive.

So what did I think? To be honest I don't have much to say. Given the film cost the GDP of a small country to make, and has grossed even more, that's a bit worrying. But the film didn't muster much in me. It was just average.

I could mention the naff dialogue (but I can see plenty of others here have already done that) or the fact that Cameron has borrowed liberally from his own 'Aliens' - the company man here is just like Burke, the big walking machines are like the yellow loaders etc. Or the rather flat characterisation. Or cod environmentalism. Or the dreadful Horner score...

More pointedly, I thought the fact that Jake is accepted by the natives a bit unconvincing. Given he's an outsider I couldn't see why they adopted him. Yes, there is that scene that shows he's the chosen one but I felt Cameron's script could have worked a bit harder to convince.

I didn't think Pandora was a particularly original setting. There are still many reassuringly earthy things there - like horses, but with six legs. It seemed a fantasy version of this world rather than a totally alien world. Also - and I know this may sound like a daft thing to say - it didn't look real. Of course I know it's not real but to my eye it all seemed so obviously computer generated.

My other big criticism was, sorry to say this, I found it a bit boring and long winded. It took too long to get going. Jake's monotone narration doesn't help with this.

On the plus side once war is declared the film moves up several gears. In that way it reminds me of 'Titanic' in that the last hour is what you've been waiting for. The scene where the big tree is felled is undeniably moving and the final battle ain't bad either (if all a bit familiar). But as the credits ran I was left with an overwhelming sense of, 'so what?' 'Avatar' is all spectacle and little substance.

3932317,5,B002HEXVUI,"I first saw Avatar about a year ago. But I saw it on DVD, since I didn't have a Blu-ray player then. Even then I was amazed at the visuals and everything. But since then I have gotten a Blu-ray player and I watched Avatar on Blu-ray as soon as it came in the mail from Amazon. IT LOOKS SO GOOD!!! If I could only own one movie on Blu-ray, it would be Avatar! You haven't seen this movie if you haven't seen it in Blu-ray!!!!

I really loved the underlying themes and story of Avatar. In fact, I think the themes are so important that they should set an example for how we should treat our planet. I mean if we continue to neglect it, less and less will be around for future generations. That would be a shame. Yes, the story of Avatar does have some similarities with other movies (one movie that comes to mind is Dances with Wolves). But I still think it is a story worth telling and may even be a sort of wake-up call for us on Earth.

Also I like the extended-collector's edition. The extra 16 minutes compliment the movie nicely and fill out the story better. Now the movie opens on Earth instead of in space, they visit Dr. Augustine's school on Pandora that they only mentioned in the theatrical version, and they lengthened some of the fight scenes and Jake and Neytiri's love scene etc. It is worth it to see this version, but you can also watch the theatrical version or the re-release (with 8 extra minutes). I don't really think they are of much importance though because everything that's in those is in the e.c. edition. And unless you don't want to watch some of the extra scenes, you might as well watch the e.c. edition every time.

This edition has a lot of extras too. Two whole discs of them!! They range from deleted scenes, to behind the scenes, to scene deconstruction and documentaries. There is about 45 minutes of deleted scenes and it is interesting to watch them because it reveals some plot details that aren't revealed in the other editions (like before Quaritch attacks the Tree of Souls, Selfridge fights with him about using mining explosives and threatens to fire him. Quaritch then chokes him and says that he's in charge now because of emergency authority). The behind the scenes are nice and they explain how they worked on it with interviews and such.  Gosh, it is amazing how much work they put into this.

The coolest part is the scene deconstruction. This is where they play certain parts of the movie and you can pick which way you want to view them. You have 3 choices: Full, template, or capture. Full is what is sounds like, Full definition (the quality of the movie). Template is a very rough CGI scene where they do enough to see how it will look but don't spend all the time making it look nice because they don't know if they are going to keep it (there was a really nice Na'vi dance scene in the deleted scenes that was in template). Capture is where they show the actors/actresses in their body suits with all the sensors on them. Capture is the coolest one because it shows you how they act it out without any CGI over them.

The case is very nice. The discs go in little sleeves. Each sleeve is essentially a page in the little book. The book slides into a case and another cover slides on top of that (if you don't know what I mean watch the video on this Amazon page). The pictures on the inside sleeves look great and are very high quality. The case isn't as sturdy as a regular plastic case, but it looks a heck of a lot better, so I guess you give some and get some. Overall I was pleased with the case and VERY pleased with the quality of the movie.

Also, I read on some other reviews that they had to change discs in between the movie. At first I was puzzled because I didn't have to switch, but then I realized that they were reviewing the DVD version. Reviews written on this page appear on both the DVD and Blu-ray pages. So if you're going to buy Avatar in Blu-ray (which I strongly recommend that you do, you won't be sorry), then you don't have to worry about switching discs in the middle of the movie. Blu-ray discs are just a lot larger than DVDs are and can hold the entire movie. You do have to switch discs if you want to watch bonus features, as there aren't any on disc 1 (the movie disc). Also I should point out that because the Blu-ray edition fits the movie onto one disc, it has 2 discs for bonus features, instead of one for the DVD version. So you get another couple hours of bonus features when you buy Blu-ray, just another reason why to get it.

This version should please any Avatar lover out there. It has everything you want: Blu-ray, extended edition, lots of bonus features, and a cool case. The only thing this doesn't have that some might want is 3D. But I didn't want that since I don't have a 3D TV.",1306108800,8,4792,4.316666666666666

3932335,5,B002HEXVUI,"Okay, after I purchased my first DVD of Avatar I got hooked.  When I bought it, I had no idea of what the movie/Cameron's film was really about.  So, when I read there were an additional 16 minutes (or so) of scenes not in the original, I had to have it.  Now, it is my number one favorite - of my personal collection of over 1,000 movies.  The extended cut version is the ""whole"" Avatar movie.  The extended cut scenes tie everything together!
Right from the start, Jake Sulley is shown rolling across a crowded intersection in an overpopulated, futuristic city where most everyone wears a mask over their face to keep out...something, bad-smell, bad-air, who knows.  Probably a combination of both.  It explains Jakes prayer to Eywa ""there is no more green on earth.""  It then shows Jake in a cramp apartment, smaller than the standard apartment for a North Korean citizen.  And, on the tele, a commentator talks of a Chinese Zoo bringing long dead species of animals back to life like the Bengal Tiger.  On their first science sortie, Jake, Dr. Augustine, and Norm stop at Dr. Augustine's old-school to grab some supplies.  It is there that Jake asks Dr. Augustine, ""what happened here"" after seeing bullet holes in a wall.  Another comment made by Dr. Augustine is how the Navi learned English faster than she could teach it, and that the Navi learned ""all they needed to know about humans"" in a very short time.  Oh, and on the ride in to there first field assignment, they pass over a heard of Sturmbeasts, whose counterparts are the American Bison.  Later in the extended cut, a whole hunt-scene of the Sturmbeasts takes place where Jake and Tsuetsey (sic) both score kills on Sturmbeasts while flying Ikran!  The arrow shots must hit the beasts in there left air-intake ventricle to take them down as evidenced by horse-mounted Navi's spear throws merely glancing of the ultra thick hides of the Sturmbeasts.
The most important part however is the scene with Jake and Dr. Augustine where she tells him the story of Nateri's sister who is executed by RDA security forces at Dr. Augustine's school after setting a bulldozer alight.  This occurs right in front of Nateri.
There is a lot more in the extended cut than I have mentioned here, but like I said, it ties everything together, especially the ending, where Tsuetsey dies (more than just falling out of the back of the shuttle) and makes Jake... It's awesome!  There is also several hours of special features where you can watch scenes in various stages of production that never made it into the film. My favorite is the confrontation where Quatterich grabs administrator Selfridge by the neck, lifts him off the ground and says "" you're a long way from home.""
The box (three leaf book type) is very nicely done in glossy pictures with comments.  Bottom line, if you are an Avatar fan, this is a must have DVD set.",1304121600,4,2876,4.68389662027833

James Cameron knows how to make movies with mass appeal. After grossing $1.8 billion worldwide with Titanic, Avatar is closing in on $3 billion. Despite its success, many regard it as unoriginal and simply a blend of several stories we already know. While that's true in some ways, it doesn't mean that it isn't groundbreaking or spectacular in its own right.

The trailers didn't impress me at all and I dismissed the hype from people who had seen the movie in theaters. When Avatar earned nine Oscar nominations, winning three, and the Blu-ray was released, it was finally time to see what all the fuss was about. I truly expected to be disappointed, but I was completely wrong.

Within 90 seconds, the movie had me in its grasp.

We see an interior shot of the ship and meet Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), the main protagonist. Cameron chooses to use Sully as a narrator and it works effectively. The opening shot of the ship looks impressive and gives an idea of the sheer scale of the movie. A minute later, a shot of Pandora orbiting a gas giant increases the impression of size.

The first 24 minutes takes time to establish the setting. We meet the main human characters and discover some of their background and the purpose of their mission. Sully is an ex-marine who, despite having lost the use of his legs, is able to use the expensive avatar intended for his dead brother. This shows us that the mining company in the story is cynical and only concerned about the bottom line, money.

Sully has no experience with the avatar and no training in the background of the native Na'vi language. He's portrayed as savvy, confident and disrespectful, and we are supposed to like him immediately. After a speech that wouldn't have been out of place in Full Metal Jacket, we learn that Pandora is a dangerous and inhospitable moon and that many will not survive their tour of duty.

The initial setup might drag for some, but it held my interest. The exposition is clumsy, but it really doesn't matter. This is a feast for the eyes and ears and you will enjoy it more if you don't stop to analyze it.

After 24 minutes, everything changes when Sully, as part of an exploration team, is sent on a mission outside the training complex in his avatar body. The initial shot of the surface is breathtaking, full of detail and color. In fact some of the colors seem totally new to science.

Sully's inexperience shows and he is separated from the team by the native animals. That's when the story really begins as we encounter a Na'vi woman in the form of Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), Sully's eventual love interest.

The hour following Sully's first trip to the surface is the most original and interesting part of the movie. We are shown Pandora and the Na'vi way of life in an extended training sequence as the tribe decides to study Sully. The creatures and plants he encounters are quite different from things we have seen before. The jungle which they inhabit also has unique features. Just look at some of the night scenes for example.

I don't want to ruin the story by revealing too much for the few people who haven't seen Avatar, so let's concentrate on the themes.

As the world is introduced to us, we start to shift focus. Instead of viewing it as something to be exploited for its minerals, it becomes a precious thing of beauty. The inhabitants want nothing more than to live and be left alone. It's an effective sequence and most viewers will empathize with the plight of the Na'vi and start to side with them, just as our protagonist does.

As I have indicated, the script isn't the most important reason to watch Avatar. Some of the dialogue is silly and you are clearly told which characters you are supposed to like or dislike. But that doesn't mean it's totally without depth and you will see a few of the characters develop and change. Sully is an obvious example, as is Grace (Sigourney Weaver), but take a closer look at Tsu'tey (Laz Alonso). His character interested me and I enjoyed seeing his character gradually change throughout the story. I would have liked to have seen him involved even more.

Once we are fully invested in the Na'vi way of life, the events which follow have more meaning. The actions of the military seem like abominations. There are obvious parallels to the way in which the US military is viewed by some. The use of Unobtainium is an obvious reference to oil in today's world. The home tree may even be viewed as the twin towers and the Na'vi represent a race that was exploited on our own world. Cameron isn't afraid to use our modern prejudices to draw us in deeper. There is a strong green message as well and it just seems wrong to destroy the beauty and harm the native population.

I'm a big fan of Orson Scott Card's Ender Wiggin series and it was interesting to see his theme of everything in the world being connected - from Speaker of the Dead - used in Avatar. It was effective because it heightened the feeling that this world and its people should not be exploited.

The final 45 minutes switches to full Hollywood mode. We see non-stop action, explosions, inspirational speeches, death, heroic acts, unlikely outcomes and miraculous escapes. It's full of clich, but I found that I didn't actually mind. The reason was that the first half of the story made me care about these characters. I was fully invested.

One thing I realized after taking everything in was that Avatar was unique in one very important way:

I'm a fan of science fiction in general and love movies such as Blade Runner and Dune. When I watch those movies, or Star Wars, I know that they are set in different realities and sometimes on different worlds. But part of me always thinks that it's just Earth. It may feature a desert setting or use an unusual location, but it's still something I know. Avatar made me feel like I stepped out onto a completely new world. When I saw where and how the Na'vi lived, I was really seeing it for the first time. The creatures, the fauna and the colors were unique. It almost felt like I was a part of the story.

The overall pacing was excellent. Once you see Pandora's surface for the first time, you'll be hooked. This experience doesn't seem to last over two-and-a-half hours and you will probably wish for more when it ends. Don't despair; there is now an extended cut available with an additional 16 minutes and extensive special features, as well as the likelihood of two sequels over the next few years. The popularity of Avatar almost guarantees that we will be seeing a lot more of Pandora in the future. I for one can't wait.

Avatar is influenced by so many movies that it would be prohibitive to list them all. Dances with Wolves and The Matrix are certainly near the top of the list.

Video Quality 5/5
Avatar looks better than any movie I have ever seen, with the exception of some fully-animated titles. Although the majority was created on a computer rather than filmed with a camera, it seems real and the detail is exceptional. The colors that we know are accurate, while the newly-invented surroundings and inhabitants appear consistent with the less-familiar colors. The image is so good that it adds to the feeling that you are stepping out onto an unknown world. Even the menu and subtitles look impressive. I really can't imagine a better quality presentation in the future.

Audio Quality 5/5
The sound quality matches the picture quality. There is so much detail that it's a completely immersive experience. You can hear creatures all around you on the moon's surface. The latter action sequences carry impressive weight and the explosions seem real. The score matches the mood of the movie well and builds during important sequences, in a similar fashion to Lord of the Rings. I didn't have to strain to hear any dialogue.

It's hard to fault anything in the presentation as a whole. This is why Blu-ray exists.",1303689600,,8257,4.645404663923182

3932342,2,B002HEXVUI,"This movie's not that great.  I think, in my opinion, people only like this movie because they are blinded by the awesome special effects which contain realistic new native creatures along with a huge computer-generated world.  It's amazing.  But beyond the special effects, there's not much going for this movie.  It's your simple, ""man goes undercover to get trusted by a civilization in order for the company he works for to get something worth billions of dollars from them, but ends up befriending them and has change of heart"" story.  The characters are really annoying at certain parts and there are unnecessary amounts the Avatar's flying on these dragon-like creatures to dazzle the audience, and they fell for it.  I saw this movie in 2D and this is what I saw.  People who saw it in 3D like it better because of the 3D visuals.

( the whole reason behind the movie )
VERY informative. I've watched this movie approx 20 times and I'm still not sick of it yet. this Movie takes Sci-fi to a whole new level.
if you ever want to save the description ""eye candy"" to make a point to your friends that haven't seen it yet, use it for this movie.
there is (in my opinion) 2 parts I liked the best. the chase of the Thanator and when Neytiri and Jake 1st fly their Ecklan together.(Banshee) It makes you wish you could have one to ride. I give this movie 5 Stars hands down.

Clearly they just want people to buy both editions because I'm quite certain you can fit a full movie onto one DVD these days.  This is incredibly frustrating!

What is so amazing about this movie is that with my new Blu-Ray player playing this movie on my 720 Plasma HD TV along with a 5.0 Surround System, the movie was breathtaking.  I was blown away.  I had seen Avatar in 3D in the theaters but even in 2D, this movie is a treat for the eyes.

3932360,5,B002HEXVUI,"In the year 2154, crippled war veteran Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) who's brother died in vein leaves Earth and put in cryo for 7 years then wakes up to be on a fresh new home called Pandora. There he makes new friends like Grace (Sigourney Weaver), Trudy (Michelle Rodriguez) and Norm (Joel David Moore) including meeting the owner of the corportion of RDA known as Selfridge Parker (Giovanni Ribsi) and hardnosed Colonel Quatrich (Stephen Lang) who both are exploiting a substance called Unobtanium which can help some of Earth's resources and Jake participates in a special program called the Avatar program which there are remote controlled bodies that mixes human and alien DNA together of the natives on the planet called the Na'Vi which are 13 feet tall wild cat-like blue humanoids as humans go throught virtual reality-like status they put their mind in link to the avatar when they sleep. Jake with Norm and Grace go out into the wild to explore and study the land they are in that is until a Thantor beast attacks with both leaving Jake behind in the wild by accident, his life has been saved by by a gorgeous Na'Vi woman named Neytiri (Zoe Salanda) then starts to join up with the Na'Vi people as he starts to learn their ways, culture and even finds himself to be part of the people. Thus Jake starts to realize that he must protect the people he now knows to go into battle against his kind.

A brilliant and stylish live-action/CGI animated Sci-fi fantasy western action-adventure mix extraganza from auterur James Cameron who wrote, produced, edited and directed this motion picture event. In 1988 Cameron had this idea for the movie then in 1993 he wrote an 80 page screenplay as then he brought to the script to producer Jon Landau in december 1995 aiming for a 1999 release date after Titanic but the technology at the time was impossible to his film justice as he put the script in a drawer and had to wait. Then after doing documentarys in 2004 he was convinced by Lord of the Rings's technology that the time was right to do justice to his vision, from 2005 till early 2009 production began then research, developement, casting, and shooting then effects were added. WETA did some amazing visual effects and new & improved motion capture rotoscoping similar to what Ralph Bakshi and Robert Zemeckis were doing but avoiding Dead-Eye syndrome of Polar Express as the Na'Vi are belivable even with their eyes and non-robotic body movements with facial capture and skin. The acting is good quite mainly from Zoe Salanda and Stephen Lang who are the best actors in the movie and while the story is not new and many reviewers have compared it to ""Dances with Wolves"", you have to remember folks that ""Dances with Wolves"" wasn't a new idea too since it all began with 1950's Jimmy Stewart western classic ""Broken Arrow"" which is one of Cameron's favorite movies as that movie spawned the whole white-man joining tribe movie genre including Man Named Horse, Lawrence of Arabia, Little Big Man, Dune, Dances with Wolves, Last Samurai and now Avatar is part of the genre. Broken Arrow was Cameron's main inspiration as he wanted to do a Sci-fi take on the film and he also combined elements of the Star Wars Trilogy, Heavy Metal the movie and comic magazine, Studio Ghibli movies mainly Nausicaa, Star Trek, World History mainly the story of Pocahontas with the Spanish invading South America, the animated works of Rene Laloux mainly Fantastic Planet, westerns of the past, Issac Ashmiov's novels, John Carter of Mars and even Dune. It's a very well made, stunning and breathtaking adventure that became the most hyped movie of 2009 and delivered an amazing box-office gross to become the second highest grossing movie of all time and earning critical acclaim with now a major fanbase and created the most unique alien language this side of Klingon as even the movie was nominated for best picture at the academy and got various awards at other places, this is a must see motion picture that offers a feel good message about war and saving our enviroment but better on the big screen in 3D.

This 3-Disc Collector's Edition Blu-Ray has all the right stuff where the previous barebones Blu-ray/DVD failed which was good for renting. The first disc contains the movie in three unique versions such as the theatrical cut, the Special Edition which has 12 minutes of never before seen footage and the final cut called The Extended Cut with 16 minutes of additional footage and alternate opening that improves the film. The Second disc contanis 45 minutes of deleted scenes especially a very cool Dune-like scene inspired by that novel's water of life scene, Capturing Avatar: An in-depth feature length documentary covering the filmmaker and their journey making the film, A Message from Pandora: A fascinating and heartbreaking look at Cameron trying to save a Brazilian native town from a dam construction as if it was Avatar for real and Production Material which covers everything from the 2006 Art Reel to screen testing and two short movies that inspired the visual effects for this movie. Disc 3 has interactive Scene Deconstruction which you explore various stages of production in 3 viewing modes that are different, 17 featurettes covering performance capture to scoring and more and finally Avatar Archieves has Teaser/trailer to this movie, the Avatar scriptments from 1995 and the revisited script from 2007, Pandorapedia which is an interactive enclyopedia that covers the history, language and biological of Pandora, two translated versions of the songs used in this movie and the art of Avatar which has many stills on the art from the film. This Blu-Ray is like a interactive movie school and a must have for fans of cinema, Sci-fi/fantasy and adventure alike for it's great fun for the whole family.

3932362,3,B002HEXVUI,"I waited to see this movie, ignoring my friends who kept hyping it to me.  Finally saw it and, while quite lovely, it was a bit less than I expected.

Beautiful visuals (especially on BR), simplistic plot, nice fight scenes, lovely aliens--don't we all wish we could have such tall, thin, perfect bodies--and a message that you couldn't avoid tripping over.  That didn't bother me too much...save for the in-your-face way that the aliens reminded one of Native Americans, even down to the paint for rituals and warfare, and that the mineral the military-corperations wanted was called (seriously?!?!?) ""unobtainium.""  \

We could have used a teeny bit more backstory about how the Earth had been used up and that was why the corporation was mining Pandora, and the part about Jake's brother seemed missing some detail.  Probably, the director just wanted to jump us right into Pandora.  There was also no explanation of how mountains were floating in the air.  And, maybe, something could have been said about how the name Pandora means ""all gifts.""  The name of the planet-goddess also seemed quite similar to Gaia.  Again, pretty obvious.

Overall, a mixed blessing of a movie.  Rather too simplistic for adults and, maybe, it could have used some time edited out, but okay otherwise.  Honestly, a pretty movie, but no award-winner.",1301875200,2,1334,4.981900452488688

3932366,5,B002HEXVUI,"Overall, let me start out by saying this was a phenomenal movie. Hands down one of my most favorite releases of 2009. James Cameron is the director of many acclaimed movies and his other most notable movie was Titanic - another masterpiece.

Avatar tells the story of a human occupation on an alien and distant planet. The plot and story for the most part revolve solely around the story of Pandora (the planet) and its history/future. When the main character (played by Sam Worthington) whom is disabled from the waist down is given the ability to utilize creatures called Avatars to perform activities he hasn't been able to do in a long time things get interesting. Avatar is a movie that takes the viewer on an amazing and colorful journey and can be enjoyed by just about anyone.

Pros:
Beautiful scenes and color
Character Development
Plot Development

Cons:
Movie left me only wanting to spend more time on the planet of Pandora

Endstate:
Definitely a movie for any member of the family",1301356800,,994,4.761627906976744
3932367,2,B002HEXVUI,"When this movie had its initial release, a good many jokes circulated about the Internet that it was merely a remake of Dances with Wolves or even Disney's vapid Pocahontas.  Nothing could have been truer.  If you have seen either of those flicks, you've seen Avatar.  There is nothing shocking about this movie.  Anyone with a few active brain cells can see what's coming at least a half hour ahead.  It's a Disney cartoon with really good animation.  Then there's the design of the Na'vi aliens.  Were they meant to be porn stars for the Furry fetish crowd?
Still, I've yet to see a James Cameron movie that is not without its merits.  The effects are groundbreaking and it does have decent messages about environmentalism, Eastern-styled spiritualism, and American greed and arrogance.  As I recall, this movie was rather lambasted by fundies and teabaggers post release for those very reasons.  Anything that can do that isn't all bad.
If you've got nothing else to do, you could watch worse than Avatar.  But if you really want my advice, skip this and go straight to District 9.",1300924800,3,1084,4.774193548387097

3932369,1,B002HEXVUI,"The price these rip off merchants are asking for Avatar 3D is nothing short of ""Daylight robbery"". Under 2yrs ago Avatar blew my mind at the IMAX 3D cinema. It made me buy a 3D TV and search, wait, search, wait, search and wait some more for its 3D DVD release. Since then other 3D movies had been released, but nothing caught my imagination like Avatar. Since Avatar has finally been released, I have sat back and refused to spend that sort of money for a DVD, especially after forking out for a 3D TV. Just as I was about to give in and purchase Avatar at top dollar, I watched another movie called Owls: Flight of the Guardian. I was blown away by the graphics and all the 3D segments. I've since bought the movie at JB HiFi and paid $45AUS for it. Beats Avatar hands down for 3D effects. Its available at most good local Video stores to rent.

Things are rushed there are alot of character you don't care about.  A lot of Hollywood Movie cliches in the first hour.  After that the movie picks up but the ending clearly shows that James Cameron backed himself in corner and took the easy way out.  Or didn't want to spend another 15 - 30 minutes having Navi making a better battle plan.  The Marines where one big cliche.  I prefer the Marines in Aliens than Avatar.  Overall a fun flick and if its on when I turn the channel I may leave it on.  But it definately didn't live up to the hype.  Now I will head over to Red Letter Media and see how they reviewed it.

3932373,1,B002HEXVUI,"James cameron tried to be preachy as well as give us a kick ass movie and it just didn't mesh well.

There is no mistaking what this movie is really about. In our own past The Native Americans were done some of the same way as reflected in this movie and it seemed like the message was one of, we must remember the past or we are doomed to repeat it...type of thing. Also it seemed to be preaching how we are destroying our environment like the non-natives did in the movie.

While the visual effects were pretty cool, were they astonishing, wonderous, stellar or worth in excess of 300 million dollars? No, in my opinon they were not.

When I watch a movie I don't want to be preached at so loudly by the storyline that I have a headache after watching it. If I want to be preached at, I'll go to church where I didn't pluck down $10.00 for a movie ticket.

I don't like being lied to or having a preachy message shoved down my throat while I'm not looking. I have been told that people like their movies to have a message, that most movies have a message. Really? Did Nightmare on Elm Street have a message? If so I missed it. I thought we liked to sit down to watch a movie purely for fun, or to escape our own lives for 2 hours. Am I wrong?

I can't be the only one who watched the movie and was irritated by the preachy, I'm gonna shove this message down yourt throat whether you like it or not, tactics. They are right there for everyone to see.

The plot as I see it: Humans find an alien planet that has a mineral they need and a large deposit of the mineral in under a huge tree the aliens call home and they won't let the humans get near it. The humans send in a few people using a remote controlled alien body (The Avatar) which they use to get to know the aliens. One of the men using an Avatar see's that what his people are doing is wrong and decides to fight his people and side with the aliens and falls in love in the process.

The message being: People colonizing America found Native Americans and after a while of getting to know them wanted their land and so they pushed them out and took what they wanted, killing many in the process. Now if we don't stop raping the earth our resources are going to be gone and we are going to regret what we have done.

But I've come to the conclusion that this is what James Cameron does, he makes preachy movies. So the next time I see James cameron's name on a movie, I think I'll just give it a pass.",1300579200,5,2461,4.101871101871102

Brilliant marketing was in sync with everything from concerns of environmental activists to liberal political wonks.  Some even saw it as a kind of spiritual meditation or mandala.  The theatrical release broke every movie for initial gross receipts with over $3 billion in revenue (not counting the multiple DVD and Blu-ray editions).

My husband and I watched it two nights in a row before returning it, then bought this extended collector's edition. We both really love the movie, but whoever designed this packaging should be fired. It's a card stock sleeve enclosing a cardboard sleeve, enclosing a cardboard ""book"" with three slide-out card stock pull-outs that each house a disk. It's hard to separate any level of this packaging from the others, and disc 2 is already scratched from sliding in and out of its card stock sleeve, after only two or three viewings. VERY disappointing. I wish they'd put it in an accordian-type package that still contained the traditional plastic snap-in disc holders.

3932383,5,B002HEXVUI,"The parallels between the storyline in this movie and the destruction of the native American tribes in US history is striking.  Like the Na'vi, most native American tribes had belief systems which described a living energy in all things -- plants, animals -- an energy that is shared between the people, the land, the animals and the plants, the entire ecosystem.

The only difference in this movie is that unlike the ""civil""ization of native tribes in the history, marginalized to oblivion, the natives in this movie rise up for the rights of all. This movie reconciles the consciousness of America to our own powerful religion -- that all men are created equal.  A phrase written when one man could own another as property.  It was a phrase we still struggle to live up too and this movie gives a cathartic sense either that the past can be righted or, at the very least, if we had it all to do again, stronger hearts would prevail.  We would chose to act on our powerful principles and give rights to all ideas and all peoples.

3932384,5,B002HEXVUI,"This is a great 3D movie,  and a must have as some of the other folks have said. This is by far the best 3D movie I have in my collection. If you are reading this review, then you are probably considering buying the 3D version. This is only my opinion, but if you are like myself and as you were sitting in the theater watching this and you thought to yourself ""I would love to watch this in 3D at home!"" then this is worth every bit of $150.00 and up. You won't regret it, but you have to be careful when choosing the dealer.
 Everything was fine, I ordered it, it took 2-3 days to get to my house. No problems.....until I received it in the mail. I put it in the PS3 and it wasn't 3D!!!!!It was the Blu-Ray that had been put in an Avatar 3D box and then put back into the plastic sleeve. I had just spent about $230.00 all together on this and felt like passing out. I try really hard not to make stupid decisions, but this one wasn't looking very good. I wrote the dealer and explained what had happened and that I was extremely angry and that this was going to have to be taken care of. I was afraid that they would not have the 3D version to send me, and that they would blame me and say that I switched the discs. It was a bit traumatic. They wrote me back a few hours later and said they would take care of it. A few days later I received the 3D version of the film.
  So the reason I am writing this review is to let the honest people know what some of the dishonest people are doing. The Dealer explained that they have run into several instances where people buy the Avatar 3D starter kit and carefully remove the 3D version replacing it with the Blu-Ray version. They then either return it claiming it has not been opened, or they sell it, as to not get stuck paying the $150.00-$400. So I just wanted to give you a heads-up. I got lucky with the dealer, because they were honest. I fear that some people won't be so lucky. A few things you can do is try to buy from the dealer who has more ratings, this in no way guarantees you won't be ripped off, but usually the dealers with more ratings have more experience and may be easier to deal with. For this product I would not deal with a start-up dealer, too risky. You can also write the dealer and have them check to make sure the 3D disc is in the case before they ship.

3932390,5,B002HEXVUI,"Acclaimed filmmaker James Cameron once again made cinematic history with the breathtaking science fiction blockbuster Avatar. In the distant future, a handicapped ex-Marine named Jake Scully (Sam Worthington) accepts a job to aid a human colony in their mining venture in the jungle planet of Pandora where its inhabitants known as the Na'vi are strongly against the destruction to their home. Using an alien hybrid called an avatar, he makes contact with the Na'vi and becomes torn between following his orders and protecting the world he feels is his home. Avatar is an extraordinary and visually groundbreaking film spectacle that ranks as one of the most imaginative Sci-Fi movies in cinema history. Thought the story may be a somewhat clichd with obvious stereotypes, the film is nevertheless entertaining and embracing. Cameron and his technical crew have spent many years developing the technology to create this Sci-Fi world and its inhabitants. Avatar represents an impressive leap in special effects and 3D technology. The cast also stars Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, Giovanni Ribisi and Sigourney Weaver.

Avatar Extended Collection Edition is truly a must-have for Sci-Fi fans and home video enthusiasts. The award-winning blockbuster is presented in 1.78:1 widescreen format. The 3-disc Blu-ray includes the original theatrical version, the special edition re-release and the 3-hour extended cut. The picture quality is certainly reference quality with such eye-popping detail and vivid colors. The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio delivers a first rate home theater experience. The Extended Collection Edition also includes over 45 minutes of deleted scenes, the in-depth documentary Capturing Avatar, 17 behind-the scenes featurettes that further explores the film's production, screen testes, high definition picture galleries and theatrical trailers. Overall, Avatar Extended Collection Edition scores an ""A"".",1298592000,3,1935,5.7421602787456445

3932392,3,B002HEXVUI,"Sam Worthington's portrayal of an intensely physical vet coping with disability is superb. Driven by Jake's character, the classic hero's journey is one of hope and redemption, like ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga. All the cast did a spectacular job. WETA workshop and the actors deserve 5 stars. The myriad of talent involved brings alive the vitality and magic of forests at night, fungus lit up like jellyfish, light, life, and movement. This is likely the most beautiful film I have ever seen. At face value, the extended version Collected Extended Cut is not overly PC. Important pieces are reinstated, the opening sequence reveals Jake's miserable life on a miserable earth. The process of Jake's new bodily habitation is elaborated with the toughening of his feet as he runs through the forest, why Pandora has floating mountains is finally explained, as is the school.

The mining pit reminds me of Butte, Montana, with its large EPA superfund site, reputedly replete with toxic mountain goats. I've known mining executives, but the role portrays a young temp for hire, not someone in charge; the character would be more convincing written with authority and played by an actor like Judi Dench. I enjoyed the line, ""It is my job to keep you alive, I will not succeed,"" but Cameron leaves no doubt he's anti-military in his ""Capturing Avatar"" rants. He reveals dilettante environmentalism coupled with an outsider view of Native peoples, and American Indians in particular. The film cannot ultimately transcend the director's clichs. Of mixed ethnic heritage, I, and many others, are offended by Cameron's use of hackneyed tribal stereotypes; this exploitation is as dated as his silly fake African soundtrack. True Science Fiction reaches beyond 1960s vintage socio-political theology. If Cameron had remained true to Sci Fi, and not gone down the allegorical road, the blue skin and cat appendages would be fine. But the man is too literal, and thus insults the otherness of ""the other"" with narrow perceptions. Cameron gets off on fake buffalo hunting scenes and tribal dance cliches. His ""Gaia"" spirituality ultimately goes nowhere. The unfinished, essential vision quest Dreamwalker sequence (Deleted Scenes, Disk 3) reveals Cameron's view of Native religion, that it equals a biological, planetary computer port.

The horrible chick-flick bellowing score at the close of the film is a shame to be muted; it does nothing for the story or the audience. Real tribal music, Brazilian beats, electronica, world fusion, or interesting composers with real talent like Stewart Copeland, Ry Cooder, or Rachid Taha would be appropriate. But Cameron treats listeners to old style orchestral movie-music, as bland and false as Paul Simon wheezing over the top of African musicians back in the 1980s. This choice accompanies Cameron's dated and foolish crude language, as out of place as 1960s/70s fringe. Oh, but fringe is there, in spades! What a shame no one had the gumption to reign in Cameron's agenda and prevent Blue Dances With Coyotes, Yip-Yip. Once your eyes adjust to the film's surface beauty, repeated viewings reveal more annoying flaws. But Weta Workshop and the amazing cast all deserve 5-stars and more.",1298332800,4,3218,5.174664107485604

3932397,3,B002HEXVUI,"""Avatar"" may have had more hype beforehand than any other movie in the past decade. Alien worlds! Alien creatures! Alien plants! Epic conflict! Mecha! Blue cat-elves!

So unsurprisingly, everyone expected James Cameron's epic space opera to be all-around brilliant in every way. And as a visual experience, Cameron dazzles us with otherworld visions of glowing plant life and strange alien creatures.... but the plot is basically the tired old ""Pocahontas/Dances With Wolves/Last Samurai"" chestnut, complete with forgettable acting and a bucketload of cliches.

Crippled marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is summoned to the alien moon of Pandora, where he is offered a simple deal -- if he helps the Evil Military and Evil Corporation drive away the alien Na'vi so they can mine a mystery mineral from their lands, they'll heal him. So his consciousness is transferred to an alien ""avatar"" that allows him to contact the Na'vi.

Of course, Jake quickly encounters the beautiful Princess Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and falls madly in love with her. As he gets to know the Na'vi (and of course, falls for their princess), he begins to turn against the Evil Military/Corporation's plans, and tries to help the Na'vi defeat them. In a nod to realism, the Na'vi are wiped out and Pandora becomes a colony of Earth... just kidding.

""Avatar"" is every bit as visually dazzling as they say -- luminous plant life like something under a tropical sea, floating islands, lush jungles, floating lights, sentient trees and weird creatures like giant ridable rays and multi-legged ground beasts. The entire moon of Pandora seems to be clothed in a magical haze, and you're left with the feeling that there is so much more on this world than what we've seen. This movie would have been enthralling visually even if if there was no plot.

So where does it fall down? The plot, of course. Cameron is basically recycling a tired old chestnut -- a white guy encounters a primitive but ""in touch with nature"" native people, falls for a pretty native girl, and becomes the messiah/savior/leader of the natives and defeats the evil white conquerors. Throw in some environmental sermons and ""The military is evil! Big business is evil!"" preaching, and you have the basic plot.

Even worse, it doesn't feel like Cameron was even TRYING to make this worn-out plot work. Instead, he runs down a long list of cinematic cliches (oh look, the primitive natives are able to defeat SPACECRAFT) and groanworthy dialogue (""All I ever wanted was a single thing worth fighting for""), culminating in a LITERAL deus ex machina. In short, the plot is a haphazard sloppy mess.

Also, the characters are WRETCHED -- military and corporate people are all evil greedy soulless jerks, except for a handful of pure-hearted scientists who all are on the Na'vi side. And while Saldana does a very good job bringing heart and soul to a CGI cat-elf, Worthington is HORRIBLE. A plank of wood would have made Sully a more engaging and tormented lead. Much better actors like Sigourney Weaver, CCH Pounder and Stephen Lang are horribly underused or misused.

""Avatar"" is undeniably the most visually dazzling movie produced in a very long time... but unfortunately, James Cameron apparently decided that a visually dazzling movie doesn't need a plot. Watch it for the visuals, and expect nothing more.",1298160000,2,3347,5.0071942446043165

3932400,5,B002HEXVUI,"In the far future in the year 2154, a handicapped soldier named Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) has been cryo-sleeping for 7 years on his way with other soldiers from Earth to the exotic planet of Pandora after his brother died on Earth. The RDA corporation exploits a precious substance called Unobtanium which has unique abilities to fold space as he meets with new friends like Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), Trudy (Michelle Rodriguez) and Norm (Joel David Moore) as they go through a special kind of program called an ""Avatar Program"" where they have Avatar bodies that mixes alien and human DNA as they are psychically linked from their minds into their bodies to infiltrate a Native alien tribe called The Na'Vi. While Rich owner Selfridge Parker (Giovanni Ribisi) and his goon known as Colonel Quatrich (Stephan Lang) have month long plans to find the location of where there is more Unobtanium, Jake gets left behind as he falls in love with a beautiful native girl named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and tries to learn about the cultures of the Na'Vi for studying for soon he becomes one of the people to become their messiah to fight against the enemy.

A brilliant and one-of-a-kind Science Fiction action adventure fantasy western from the genius of writer-producer-director James Cameron who had this idea since 1985. He wrote an 80 page screenplay and treatment in 1993 as he would make it for a 1999 release after Titanic but according to Cameron he put it in a drawer as he had to wait until the technology gets more advanced to fulfil his vision as he made documentaries while he waited and produced/created the short lived excellent show ""Dark Angel"". Then after he was blown away by the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and King Kong remake from 2005 he was convinced that it's the right time as in 2006 he pulled the screenplay out of the drawer and dusted it off as he wrote an original unique language called ""Na'Vi"" language where it's a mix of Polyesian/South-American Indian language as casting began then filming started in December of 2006 until it wrapped in early 2009. WETA who made the amazing effects for the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Pirates of the Caribbean and King Kong made their biggest effects triumph yet on perfecting the art of motion-capture using briliant photorealistic techniques on the Na'Vi people who resemble human-cat people with blue skin. It's nice to see how they did it right on the facial capture including the eyes not being dead but truly alive for Cameron knew he wanted the face to capture the emotions and expressions of the characters, WETA truly nailed it like they did with Gollum and King Kong.

The acting is quite good with Zoe being the best performer in the entire film especially Lang as the nifty Gung Ho Quatrich, while the story maybe familar sounding as many of you heard of this being compared to ""Dances with Wolves"" while it maybe similar when this film actually owes itself to the 1950 James Stewart Western classic ""Broken Arrow"" which was THE film that set the big standard for white men being part of another race movie which lead to similar movies over the years such as The Last Samurai, Man Named Horse to even both the book/film of Dances with Wolves as it was their inspiration. I gotta say it's nice to know Cameron is a huge fan of Broken Arrow since he was a kid and he stated he was inspired by Broken Arrow, Frank Herbert's Dune novels, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Heavy Metal Magazine/1981 animated movie, John Carter of Mars, Star Wars Trilogy and even Issac Ashimov's Foundations Trilogy novels since he is a fan of those things. It's an entertaining and visually stunning film that also pays homage to the works of Hayao Miyazaki since Cameron is a fan of Ghibli productions with references to Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Princess Mononoke, Castle in The Sky, Pom Poko and My Neighbor Totoro. This movie became the event movie of 2009 as it became a huge success at the box-office as it has turned into the highest grossing movie of all time even with critical acclaim and academy awards, i gotta say i saw this movie 12 times in theaters in 3D and was an experience that needed to be seen. The world of Pandora is very visual and creative as are the creatures with the Na'Vi language, James Cameron did his research while working on the film even when he wrote the treatment in 1993. I gotta applause to one of my favorite directors of all time doing another fantastic film of his catalog of doing this project after all these years and made a new milestone in special effects and one of of those must see movies everyone must see in their life.

3932405,2,B002HEXVUI,"I've watched Avatar 3 times now!  My sentiments have not changed from the first time:

1.  The CGI environment is highly impressive from a technical standpoint (resolution & detail, textures, color, and some originality)

2.  Originality, at best, is a 3 out of 5.  Movie buffs like myself will quickly see merit in this observation even if they don't like it.  James Cameron actually thought that he Could buy all of us off by dressing up old themes, characters, plots, and geography.  Here's the foundation of the movie:  we're in a much distant future (how do we know that, well to date we have never discovered life in or near our galaxy therefore we would've had to travel at least out of our solar system to find a Pandora (at present we barely have the expertise to get to Mars with 3 or 4 people, let alone a whole military company beyond our solar system)...also, the technology and size of our spaceships suggests that we are at least a century into the future), yet we find an alien race of people living in an equivalent of our Amazon jungle, using bows and arrows!!!, heavy facial features of South American Indians, including dress, and finally, jungle beasts that are no more than dressed up horses, cats of the jungle, rhinos (with a hammer head snout), and dogs...and this is supposed to be an alien planet.  Did anyone notice that the Marines' cargo loaders (the robot-like machines at headquarters) look almost identical in concept to the cargo loaders in Aliens (not to mention having Aliens star Sigourney Weaver as one of the main characters)? And what about this ""UnObtanium""?  Guess what?  Thats already been used too!  Remember the movie The Core?  Guess what the mineral was that Delroy Lindo's character used in his mining vessel to bore holes thru the Earth's Surface...UNOBTANIUM!!!  I've seen more originality at the bottom of our oceans!

3.  Plot, is a solid 1 out 5!  This plot is so tired that Cameron should be made to refund our money!  Dances With Wolves has already been mentioned, but I also see Medicine Man (where Sean Connery helped battled the pharmaceutical giant that wanted to destroy the native's forest homeland for their greed and monetary purposes), and what about Thunder Heart starring Val Kilmer?  Guess what the plot of that movie was...Val is half White and half Indian, he's an FBI agent who's sent to the native's land to investigate a murder...bottom line is that he finds out that the underlying story is a GOVERNMENT SPONSORED PLAN TO ""STRIP MINE URANIUM FROM THE RESERVATION...Val then decides to turncoat and help his people fight the government.  Hey, this is a bunch of crap for a movie that made close to 3 billion dollars, eh?  Others have also mentioned The Last Samurai (which I absolutely hated) in having this White guy come in and save the day by learning someone's culture and fighting prowess in the blink of an eye in order to save them.

4.  Subliminal messages.  As a person of color, I thought it very disturbing that virtually the entire ""human cast"" were all white!  Every position of authority, influence and intelligence were all white, with the exception of the India""n"" scientist.  All in all, I counted one Latino-Michelle Rodriguez"", one person from India-Dileep Rao, one African American (which we could see, and had a line)-Scott Lawrence, and one Asian actress that was an operator at headquarters.  The rest of the diversed cast were painted up to be the Na'vi.  So what message are you subliminally communicating Cameron, that centuries in the future White America is still in charge of everything, that they are the predominant race from Earth, or that you had to satisfy diversity requirements, but to show your resentment you made sure they were undetectable.  And because this movie was shown worldwide I do not believe it is a petty concern.  It seems James Cameron and the studios are quite fine with accepting money from the world's people but will do nothing to respect them as a paid and invited audience!!!

Conclusion.  After being a huge James Cameron fan (I own, among Avatar, Titanic, T1 & T2, 3 of the 4 Alien DVDs, and absolutely loved Abyss), I am sorely disappointed in this movie.  I think he has insulted the intelligence of pure movie buffs, offended me personally with his casting choices, and overall has not created ANY desire in me to see his Avatar sequels.",1297382400,5,4373,4.786666666666667

3932413,3,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is a science fiction movie that takes place in the distant future. A corporation is mining a material that is hard to come by, but is rich on a planet called Pandora. This planet is populated by large blue human like creatures know as the Na'vi , who worship nature. To learn about the Na'vi scientists use fake bodies called avatars that are operated from machines by people who are genetically matched to operate them. Jake Sully, a paralyzed former marine is chosen to operate one of these machines because he is a close genetic match for his brother who was killed. He is assigned to protect the scientists' avatars while they gather data on the planet. When he wondered off from the group he ends up meeting a female Na'vi who takes him to her clan's leader who orders her to teach him their ways. The commander of the companies private force promise Jake that if he gives them all the information he learns about the Na'vi they will give him the means to walk again. Jake agrees and goes through all o the training while making video logs every day. As he stays with the Na'vi and learns their ways he grows close to them and falls in love with the clan leader's daughter. He spends much more time in their world than in his own. When it is discovered that the Na'vi will never leave the private force is ordered to destroy their home.  After the destruction Jake recruits warriors from all of the other clans to prepare an attack and the private force wants to make a strike before the Na'vi attack can begin. During the battle when all hope appears to be lost for the Na'vi the planet itself appears to aid them in the battle with the planet's wildlife joining into the attack and defeats the humans. At the end of the battle all the humans aside from Jake and a few other scientists are banished from Pandora and the Na'vi perform a ritual in order to transfer Jake from his human body to his avatar.
 This movie very much so relates to the World Religions class because of its in depth coverage of the Na'vi culture.  It shows what they worship, their values, beliefs, and customs. It also showed their initiation rites to be part of their clan and even their courtship methods. It is also very closely associated with the religions depicted in chapter 2 of our book because the Na'vi are very similar to the early Earth-focused culture who value balance in nature.

The video quality is fantastic. I have a Samsung 40"" 3D setup and the movie was just beautiful to watch. Not quite the same as IMAX but very close (size of screen being the only difference that I could see). The 3D is, to my eyes, exactly as good as the IMAX on-screen version. I am a huge fan of the movie but believe me I would tell you if the video quality was not great.
I would not hesitate to do the purchase again (even considering the huge rip-off in price at this time) but advise others to consider if you really have to have it right now or can wait awhile.
Great movie, almost unbelievable video transfer quality, and a price that is just not right!

I don't feel the need to own a 3D version of this edition because I've seen that the movie CAN stand on its own even without the much hyped about 3D.
The additional scenes are amazing, and you'd actually wonder why they took those scenes away because it fleshed out the story so much more. I got to thinking maybe that's why the movie's story wasn't well-received by some critics, because of the lack of depth that the additional scenes would have put.

I haven't even finished watching the rest of the 2 discs in the collection, and I'm already recommending prospective buyers to go grab one already!
The first disc is already worth every penny. What more of the tons and tons of material on the rest of the discs?

The case is beautiful and inclued gorgeous pictures between the disc slots. It also seems pretty sturdy so I'm not worried about the case getting cracked or anything. As far as the special features your paying for the ""make of feature"" and extended scenes are well worth the watch and some of the deleted scenes make you see minor characters in a different light (RDA head Harper, Norm and Trudy). It might not have the eight or whatever hours worth of extra stuff that's on the blue ray, but that really didn't matter to me. All in all if you don't have a blue ray player or simply don't want to spend the extra $15 or more on that version, you won't be disappointed with this one.

The real gem of this 3 disc set in my opinion is the Collector's extented cut. Some of the extra scenes added in add depth to Grace, Jake and the beauty of the film. Now that I've seen that version, I can't watch the original.

I only had one problem with this set: you have to change DVD's inbetween to continue the movie. That's it, nothing else and that's only because it happens to be a personal preference (I like to watch my movies in one sitting).

Many people gave this bad reviews because they feel like Avatar is just being milked for all its worth, but the truth is if your a very smart shopper and love DVD's and thier extras you probably learned a long time ago to wait six months to a year for the second release of a blockbuster (I learned my lesson with Coraline).",1295654400,,1572,4.286195286195286

Personally, I don't care about all that crap. I didn't buy the original DVD, and if I had it may somewhat alter my opinion, but I didn't. This is the first Avatar DVD I have bought, and to be honest, originally I had no desire to see Avatar. I had an ex girlfriend who ruined the movie for me and I just didn't want to see it, but one day I was bored and ordered it On Demand. And I loved it.

This set is fantastic, it's got three versions of the film. The first is the original theatrical version, then there's the re-release version with eight minutes of new footage, and THEN there's the collector's edition with 16 minutes of new footage. Epic doesn't even begin to cover it.

The documentary is great too. It covers all the aspects of filming and is probably 90 minutes long. Very interesting.

3932449,5,B002HEXVUI,"To Mr. Cameron,

Having been a student of filmaking for many years now, as well as a writer of Science Fiction, I offer you two different perspectives on your collectors edition of Avatar. On one level I thought the extended version was excellent where the few added minutes helped to accentuate the film. On another level I felt you should have taken more time to release this version in order to complete and add to the overall film the 45 minutes of source fragment material that were a joy to view. You see, many of those scenes placed greater emphasis on the bond Jake Scully had made with the Naavi thereby making his leadership with their battle against the humans at the end of the story that much more credible. Heck, if I can sit and watch the 5 hour directors cut of John Woo's mighty film Red Cliff in one viewing then sitting and watching a 3 3/4 hour viewing of Avatar would be like being in heaven.

Other reviewers have stated here, and I have to agree, that this film makes a wonderful demonstration film for a Blu-Ray player; I was kept spellbound and in awe by the rich detail for the entire duration.

Following a paraplegic marine called Jake (played by Worthington) who functions via an Avatar, we learn about the planet Pandora and it's inhabitants, the Na'vi. They are a race who are minutely in tune with their environment and who resist the human invaders who wish to plunder their land for the (ridiculously named) mineral Unobtanium. We see how Jake develops his relationship with the Na'vi and starts to understand their viewpoint on their world and the humans intentions. There is more to the film than that, but that is a basic synopsis.

This is easily a film that could be watched again and again, if just for the amazing scenery, and it offers enough detail and beauty on-screen to keep you coming back for more. Like I started by saying, the film is a little formulaic, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing as you can sit back and easily immerse yourself in the world created for you and enjoy the plot and story as it unfolds for what it is; great entertainment. There are minor flaws in the film, things like occasionally ludicrous and unrealistic dialogue and accents, or clich characterisation, but these never detract from the overall experience. There won't be anything like this again for quite some time, so fully enjoy that first viewing and breathtaking cinematography. No doubt you will want to be returning to the stupendous world created for you again and again and I'm sure it will be just as delightful the 20th as the 1st time.

3932469,1,B002HEXVUI,"Nothing but a Dances with Wolves remake,(by the way Dances with Wolves is 100 times better than Avatar anyday.) I went to the theater to see this movie, I left when i saw it was nothing but a remake of Dances with Wolves. Whats really cool about this movie is the Academy Awards/Oscars knew what this movie was, GRATS and THANKS to them for knowing. If you really want to see this movie for what it is watch Dances with Wolves (Winner of seven Academy Awards, including Best Directing and Best Picture) By the way Dances with Wolves just came out on Blu-ray (Dances with Wolves (20th Anniversary Extended Cut) [Blu-ray] (1990)).",1294790400,4,628,4.616071428571429
3932470,4,B002HEXVUI,"If you loved Avatar this is a great buy.  The additional 16 minutes are cool - I liked some of the scenes and disliked others, but none really contributed significantly to the movie, so if you already own the original you may not find the additional scenes in the collector's cut worth it.

But if you held off on Avatar until now this is the one to get.

The extra features are kind of cool.  I liked the never-before-seen scenes because many of them were unfinished, so you could see how they went from actors running around in electrode suits, to rough, blocky animation, then into the final product.

My only complaint is the DVD case.  It is really hard to explain the posterboard origami concoction that they turned into a DVD case.  It is cardboard and after handling it twice I accidentally snagged it on something and now the paper cover that the picture is printed on is coming unglued.  The three DVDs themselves are tucked into posterboard - type envelopes that slide out of posterboard ""pages"" within the cardboard fold-out cover, like three drawers.  Although mine are still intact - for now - it is not hard to see that after a few viewings the posterboard envelopes will become bent, torn, or otherwise start falling apart unless I am incredibly careful in removing and replacing the DVD in its posterboard envelope-drawer thing.  Also the crisp folds make some of the posterboard tabs stick out and risk scratching the DVD as I remove/replace it.  And keep it well away from the coffee table or anywhere you might spill anything on it because a single drop of moisture will go right through and warp if not disintegrate the case.  Cool in concept but flimsy in practice.  I don't understand why they would take this fancy collector's edition set and stick it in a cardboard/posterboard case.  Why not enshrine your masterpiece in sturdy, water-resistant plastic?  You can mold and design plastic and make it look really nice.  You could even keep the drawer concept with some creativity.  But no.  They chose paper.

If you are buying this for kids they will probably destroy the case in days if not minutes, so have a blank DVD case (or 3) ready.  But they will still love the movie!",1294704000,,2201,4.667532467532467

The expanded versions of the movie fill in many of the details only implied in the original theatrical release. The third DVD adds even more content and fills out the story even further, though it seems to me much of the material left out of the movie was excluded because it exposed harsher elements of the narrative as much as for time constraints.

My only problem with the copy of the set that I got is that the DVDs sputtered and stalled occasionally. I had to carefully wash the discs several times to get past these flaws. Since washing did eliminate the problems for the most part, it suggests to me that the manufacturing environment was not as clean as it should be - there definitely seems to be a quality control issue here.

HOWEVER... (I write in caps for emphasis.)

After seeing this movie, I read a book. It had a plot and characters. And while I read it, I thought. I give the book I read 4 out of 5 stars -- minus one star because it didn't have cool-looking cartoons in it. But it had other stuff.

The only thing that i think this movie was missing was the element of suprise to the viewer, the whole time i was watching this movie it seemed like they were leading up to a twist through the entire movie, but then it never happened, i will have to say that i was a little dissapointed in that because i was able to predict the entire movie in full. if you are looking for a movie that is going to look amazing on blu ray, good story, and great differential between emoition and action, this is the movie for you, but don't go into the movie expecting a huge twist that is going to blow your mind, cause it won't happen. 4/5",1294272000,,1086,4.032407407407407

3932490,4,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron returns to the theaters with Avatar. Despite the promotion as an original film, Avatar resounds with comparisons to Pocahontas.

On the planet Pandora, there is a valuable mineral that The Company desires. They send in the military and scientists to retrieve it.

However, there are humanoid natives on Pandora called the Na'vi who do not wish their world to be plundered.

The humans create an empty shell that is part human/part na'vi in which certain people can upload their mind to. These are called avatars.

The avatars are used to infiltrate the na'vi population and, after being accepted as one of their own, convince them to relocate.

This world is mind-blowing. The details to the creatures, the scenery, and atmosphere is astounding. You should see this film in 3D to get the full effect. James Cameron is a great creator of worlds. He created the look of the Terminator and the fuller look of the Alien. It stands to reason that, after so many years, he would create the ultimate new world for us to enjoy.

Avatar stars Sam Worthington as Jake Sully whose job is to convince the na'vi to leave. Zoe Saldana is Neytiri - the na'vi who befriends and trains Jake. Sigourney Weaver is scientiest Dr Grace Augustine who does everything she can to be the diplomat to the na'vi.

Rated PG-13 for intense epic battle sequences, you may also want to be mindful that the female na'vi do not wear shirts. They get away with this because they are aliens I suppose.",1294099200,,1480,4.713178294573644

My daughter had been driving me crazy with her requests to watch Avatar, but we didn't feel like the language (of which there is very little in the first place) was appropriate. Problem solved.

However, this movie takes the tale and adds its own twist giving it a strong and in my opinion, a solid story line. Complimenting the already well done script is the reason why most went to see this film -- it is undeniably visually stunning. It was made for 3D and those who watched it for the first time WITH 3D saw a complete world in a film that was made FOR 3D and where it wasn't later adapted for 3D as an afterthought.

Even without 3D, this movie is still beautiful, flawless and vividly done. I believe it's worth owning. There are not many movies this long that you can watch again and again and get something new out of it. I've watched it 4 times and never felt like it was dragging on, each time learning something new about the story I didn't catch before or seeing something I hadn't noticed the first few times.

When a movie can create a culture, explain that culture, and make you FEEL for that culture (who wasn't on the side of the Na'vi at the end?) you can't say that it wasn't a well written story.

Well we all know that this movie has groundbreaking graphics, The Computer Generated graphics are nothing short of astounding.

Storyline/Plot:

About 500 years ago the earth's first world people made fantastic ships to travel in. The objective was to reach the third world otherwise known as Pandora (Pan America). Upon the discovery of this world, they encountered the Na'vi (NAtiVe Indians), the blue-skinned, large-eyed people, who often painted their faces.

For the most part, these people were regarded as being unlearned savages, a little better than monkeys that would live in the trees or primitive grass huts and tents.

Because the inhabitants of Pandora were just so ignorant, the travelers made full claims to all of their lands and valuable natural resources. If there was any resistance, the travelers would use their far superior weaponry. The Na'vi's sticks and arrows of course were no match, and thousands of them were slaughtered without mercy.

But there was one handicapped young man that fell in love with one of the Na'vi young women. Although their relationship was frowned upon, his leaders felt that it was ok to use, and leave her, as long as he kept his loyalties in the right perspective.

Eventually he was made governor of that territory, and with the passage of time all the resistance dissipated and the Na'vi lands became peaceful territories again. As all the rich resources were drained off, the travelers decided to grant the Na'vi independence. However, because their land was now drained, they were unable to trade in a profitable way.

So the travelers decided to set up inter-planetary banks, and would lend the Na'vi huge sums of money and attached onerous conditions, effectively enslaving them once again.",1293753600,,1762,5.136363636363637

3932517,4,B002HEXVUI,"The special effects and animation were, without a doubt, very spectacular and pretty to look at in Avatar. For that alone it is worth seeing. But the movie fell a bit flat for me as far as the story-telling. It is kind of ironic that for a 3D movie I want to call it two-dimensional, but I do. Also, digital characters are still cartoons even if they are sophisticated ones. They don't replace real actors and never feel quite real or carry the same emotional weight. So there was a sense of emptiness where that was concerned. (I don't know how else to put it.)

Overall though, it was lovely to watch and good entertainment. It's just maybe not worthy of all the hype it got.",1293667200,,677,4.373015873015873

3932525,5,B002HEXVUI,"Well, as many reviewers have said, this is a simple release, with no special features. I could care less about commentaries, behind-the-scenes, or any of that stuff, though I do like seeing trailers and deleted scenes. As for the missing scenes, I can't remember exactly what is missing, since it's been so long since I've seen it. For those of you that CANNOT LIVE without that stuff, look away. The movie itself: Wow! The scenery is beautiful, colorful, and it tweaks your imagination. Floating mountains---cool. And instead of being connected to nature, the people are actually connected to the planet. That is a somewhat new and enjoyable twist. Despite what critics say, it was a really great movie. For those that choose to blast the movie because it is a recycled story: waa, waa, waa. So what if the story isn't very original? Robin Hood, Braveheart, and Dances with Wolves were all stories about people who were persecuted for a stupid reason and fought back. It's a story that never gets old; the previous movies mentioned were all great movies, and will be forever. So, keep your boohoos to yourself and enjoy a different approach to a really good storyline. Noone is making you spend money to have this movie. If you didn't like it, review the disc only and spare all the open-minded moviegoers the time. The only reason I reviewed it is because I liked it. Noone wants to read a 5-page review about everything that sucked about it. If you didn't like it, say so and move on. We liked it, and we want to know the quality of the disc and not the movie, otherwise, we wouldn't be looking at it to begin with.",1293580800,2,1618,4.621527777777778

I wonder what the Harvard business school thinks of this idea. Make a new technology that will take time to catch on. Limit any and all software for it, then make special deals with certain companies so not all consumers can enjoy the limited content. If I didn't know any better I would say they are trying to sabotage themselves. I hope others out there like me, who don't feel they should have to go to ebay and pay over $100 for  Avatar, will join me in a boycott.

Worse, everyone around you is fawning over her because they're enamoured and just don't care.

Avatar is a technologically brilliant steamer of a film. The only conceivable reason why it's so damn popular is because it is so pretty. It breaks new ground in recycling old clichs, it's a breathtaking masterpiece of mixing elements from Dances With Wolves, Small Soldiers, and the Smurfs.

Come to think of it, that's really all it is:
- Take one copy of Dances With Wolves.
- Replace background with weird alien ecosystem.
- Extract Kevin Costner, replace him with a guy who spends half his life in a wheelchair and half as Grouchy Smurf.
- Throw in a tall, curvy Smurfette.
- Mix in a little Generic Army Psycho #7.
- Add endless computer runtime.
- Boil until bland, season with clichs until market testing verifies profitability.

3932537,5,B002HEXVUI,"I was one of the many Avatar fans who bought the first dvd when it came out already knowing a 3 disc delux would come out. I didn't think it would be good enough. Then I found out what would be on it:

-The original cut
-The re release cut (8 extra minutes)
-The extended cut (the 8 minutes plus another 8)
-A censored cut (the foul language removed)

Special features:
-Watch the added scenes without watching the movie
-Deleted scenes (yeah thats right, additional to the 16 min. in the  extended, there are deleted scenes)
-Behind the scenes

Yeah there aren't many special features but the lengh. The deleted scenes are over 1 hour long, the behind the scenes isn't a few short ones. Its practically a full lengh documentary being at a hour and a half. So if they combined the extended cut will the deleted scenes the movie would be at least 4 and half hours.

Now the dvd does have its flaws. One its 3 on discs, all 4 versions are on both discs but half on each. So half way through the movie you have switch discs, no matter what version you are watching. Even though the special features are great, I would have liked a commentary for at least the theatrical version.

The deleted scenes are all unfinished. Most of them are half done digital affects, the others still behind green screens and one just has the actors in motion capture suits acting out the scene.

Also, the case looks great but the way the dvds are kept in. They are in a slot in cardboard with no protection. So there is a chance you'll get scratches

Pros:
-4 different versions of the movie
-Over a hour of deleted scenes (not in any version)
-A hour and a half long documentary on how they made the movie
-The look of the dvd case

Cons:
-Half way through the movie you have to switch discs
-No commentary
-The way the dvds are in the case
-The deleted scenes are half finished
-They tricked fans into buying the 1 disc and then releasing this dvd set. So either miss out on this great dvd or buying 2 copies.

3932553,5,B002HEXVUI,"Xmas day (2010), my husband and I spent the entire day (and night) watching the new Blu-ray Avatar movie, (The Extended Collector's Edition).
We LOVED the alternate ending, the deleted scenes, and all the extra's.

Originally we saw, (and fell in love with this movie), last Xmas (2009)..... We saw it at the movies in 3-D. (Which was Awesome).
This past spring, we purchased the Avatar ""first release""... And have watched it countless times.
(We were delighted to see the Avatar DVD was wonderful even without the 3-D effects).

If you enjoyed the original version.... I think you will find the ""Extended Collector's Edition"" even ""richer"".
The deleted scenes answered many questions we pondered... and the ""Extra's"" are wonderful.

I have written no ""spoilers"" in my post... I will simply say: the ""alternate"" ending makes the movie even more ""heart felt"".
I don't understand why James Cameron deleted it. Yes, I understand they have ""time"" restraints... but the last deleted scene was needed.
My only guess ""why"" Cameron deleted it (and some other scenes) was to make the movie PG.
Avatar should be an adult movie (in my humble opinion).

I also found the deleted ""love scene"", the ""hunt"", and the ""school house"" wonderful and important to the story.
And, the other deleted scenes or rough graphic's answered many of our ""pondered"" questions.

In the years to come... when Cameron makes Avatar 2 and 3, ... I would love to see those rough graphic's ""fleshed-out"" and completed.",1293321600,2,1480,4.9757085020242915

Blue creatures just happened to have two eyes, two hands and two feet. Puh-leeze, gimme something new. Spielberg already gave us realistic aliens without tails.
It was visually dazzling, but only because of special effects, not cinematography.

3932555,2,B002HEXVUI,"As many reviewers have noted, this three-disc collector's edition (for regular DVD players) forces you to change discs IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE. Instead of laying out the entire film on one disc, this ridiculous box set puts the first half of the movie on one disc and the second on another, for all three versions!!

You have two ways to avoid this - either buy the plain-jane original release (no extras, no frills) or the Blu-ray version. Several Blu-ray salesmen seem to be actively monitoring and commenting on a number of Amazon boards urging disappointed Avatar fans to pour all their money into Blu-ray.

So instead of paying just $25 for the collector's edition, millions of Avatar fans are now being steered to pay an additional $80 or so for a Blu-ray player, something they wouldn't have bought otherwise. These so-called ""helpful commentators"" even throw in marketing crap like, ""you know you want it"" and try to convince skeptics that they're ""missing out on the latest HD"" by not buying Blu-ray.

Give me a break. What they won't tell you is that Blu-ray is a failed format that many people, especially in this recession, see it for the gimmick that it is. Honestly, how many times have you watched a movie on a regular DVD player and sighed, ""Gee, this movie really stinks because it's not a Blu-ray?""

These greedy salesmen are no different from the military in Avatar - why settle for trees when you could mow them down and build condos? Nothing is ever good enough.

Why not take a lesson from the Avatar - live simply, in tune with Nature, and not contribute to Blu-ray landfills.

3932557,5,B002HEXVUI,"If you aren't familiar with Avatar, its time you were. It is hands down the best effects movie ever made, there isn't anything even close. When we saw it in the theater we felt that it was an experience comparable to the first time we saw ""Star Wars"" in 1977. ""Star Wars"" moved effects movies to a new level of experience, and Avatar has done the same thing 33 years later. The only other movies I would suggest that fit in the category are Jurassic Park, and much later the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Integrated computer animation had of course been done before, notably in Jumanhi, but I felt that Jurassic Park was the first movie in which it looked ""real"". Lord of the Rings went a step further by mass producing the animated actors and put them in very close proximity to the live actors. Avatar's leap was to make an almost entirely animated film look real.

This Blu-ray set is an outstanding viewing experience. The color and detail is a cut above even other Blu-ray movies we own. I feel that the sharpness of the Blu-ray was better than the theater, even the Imax viewing we attended. It doesn't have 3D, but I didn't really miss that aspect of the experience. I'm sure that someday we'll purchase 3D viewing equipment, but we're not doing so yet, and I'm happy to enjoy the movie in this form until the time we do.

The extra scenes just add to the experience. They are mostly jungle scenes, often with animals that you did not see in the original theatrical release. The quality is up to the standards of the shots in the original release, so they are seamless and just add to the already immersive atmosphere of this film.

The surround sound is encompassing without being overbearing ... perfect for home theater viewing.

I know the movie's detractors whine about the story. I've never been able to figure out what their problem is. The story is involving and dramatic. Does it remind you of parts of other movies you've seen over the years? Sure, but so what? What movie doesn't? In every case it takes any similar plot well beyond what you may be reminded of, and most importantly, this plot is a good vehicle for the effects, which are the stand-out achievement of this film in the first place.

Considering that as a fan of this movie you are going to watch this again and again, the Blu-ray set is an incredible entertainment bargain at this price. If by some chance you have not seen this movie yet, you're in for a real treat when you view this Blu-ray offering.

EDIT: We now also have the 3D version of this movie, which we viewed with a Sony 3D Blu Ray and a LG passive 3D wide screen LCD. Four of us viewed it, and thought that it looked better than when we originally saw in in the theater in IMAX 3D. The image had both tremendous depth and external room penetration. The little floating animals?/plants? appeared to be halfway between me and the screen surface. Virtually the entire time it looked like we could step through the screen into that world. One of our friends expressed the opinion that he thought the colors were more rich than in the theater or on the previous 2D blu ray. It's a must have for anyone with 3D home theater.

3932558,5,B002HEXVUI,"I have been fascinated by this movie since the first time I watched a 12 minute 'making of' segment.  The abilities of both the actors and the director to perform in a huge gray room with suits and head gear is great talent in evidence (in my opinion of course).  I am sorry about the missing 16 minutes from the original movie.  Some of those scenes make the story line more continuous.  I was emotionally drawn in Tsu tey's death scene. I think the hunt festival dance would have shown a lot about the people.  If you are a fan of fantastic creativity, special effects, sci-fi and talent, then I recommend this set.  Seeing how the scenes were created and the 45 minutes of deleted scenes is great!",1293235200,,700,4.4296875

Born in the year of the 'dragon' ikains were a treat to see. For those into astrology; Sam, James and Zoe are ALL strongly LEO's-what better creatures to climb trees than cats! Each one poured their 'hearts' into this job. For anyone having had an N.D.E. the 'consciousness' depiction was RIGHT on target. I'm 70'ish and must say(being some what of a movie buff)this is by far my very FAVORITE! Swearing here didn't bother me, Sam after all was a ""Marine"". The creation of a new language was impressive to say the least! Cameron must be a very well read and deep soul for EVERYTHING to have 'crept' into this story as it did.

The added footage adds some to the movie, more on the back story of the main character.  Have not had a chance to watch all the extras, because there is hours and hours of extras.  One thing I did like is the movie has a clean language track, which I wish all movies came with.  If you only want to purchase this movie once get this version.  You get 3 versions of the movie on blu-ray, plus tons of extra stuff.",1292976000,,558,4.12037037037037

3932575,3,B002HEXVUI,My title pretty much wraps it up. The 1 star reviews are ridiculous but this is no way a 5 star movie. This is just Dances with Wolves with high end special effects.,1292803200,,165,4.03030303030303
3932576,1,B002HEXVUI,"I have a media center with bluRay, two Laptops with bluray's readers (one of which is like 5 months old) and NONE of my bluray can play this movie. It's Outrageous that makers spend so much time trying to stop piracy with new DRM and by doing that, encouraging to buy pirated versions. Is amazing that those who Do buy the products are the one who pay the price.
I updated ALL firmwares and nothing... can you believe that? I mean, Why don't they advertise ""AVATAR WON""T PLAY ON...""? And as I read around blogs over the internet, is not one player... there are a LOT of players that can't play a ""split between DISCS"" movie. I can also say that I have about 30 blu-ray discs and NONE of them had this problem ever. At least, if they had it, updates where painless.",1292803200,6,764,4.3125
3932577,5,B002HEXVUI,"People seem to have short attention span these days; but I get such a kick out of extended view movies. When something is as good as Avatar was I love all the little snippets that end up on  the cutting room floor in an effort to edit for time.  Such a Gooood movie! I could have watched another 1/2 hour.

Topsy",1292803200,2,312,4.081967213114754
3932578,5,B002HEXVUI,"I actually give the movie 4 1/2 stars, but the complete package is worth the 5 star rating.  I was not duped into buying the initial DVD release with no special features and am completely satisfied with this collection.  I liked the extended version which added a lot more depth to the story.  First of all, I am not an Avatar-freak: this was my second time watching the movie, I don't aspire to the learn Na'vi language, and the storyline is heavy on ""Dances with Wolves"" meets ""The Matrix"" meets ""Dune"" themes combined with other elements of movies we have all seen before.  The main antagonist, Colonel Quaritch, is a stereotypical, over-the-top narrow-minded soldier character.  Most of the military characters are depicted as heartless, blood-thirsty, and arrogant - I can tell you from experience as a military officer in the Marine Corps that we are not like that.

What makes Avatar really special is the stunning visual environment of Pandora and the symbiotic relationship of the Na'vi with it.  I highly recommend the movie, particularly this collection, for those that have not seen the movie and/or bought the DVD.  James Cameron was robbed at the Academy Awards; while ""Hurt Locker"" was an entertaining, yet unrealistic movie, ""Avatar"" should have won best picture and best director.  ""Avatar"" will be looked at as another landmark in filmmaking for its amazing visuals and attention to detail.  Its themes touch the viewer and what is there not to like?  Good movie!!",1292803200,,1482,4.959514170040486

3932592,5,B002HEXVUI,"When I was fortunate to see the movie @ the theatre in 3D I was left breathless. For the very first time I felt like I was being told the story while being involved within the environnent itself. I did not want to come back.  When I got my opportunity @ this special dvd compilation the saddest moment was the fact I must watch it in 2D. But with the added minutes, giving more of an informative back story for Earth along with previous events on Pandora made for a knock it out of the ball park entertainment for myself. I am a true movie slut, but as far as my ultimate favorites it's a very small group & for any new movie to enter that list the Bible must have been re-written.  With this, AVATAR, it was. My #1 is Gigi, then we go into The Women ('39), The Best Years Of Our Lives, Breakfast at Tiffany's, Mildred Pierce, Mrs. Miniver, The Enchanted Cottage - some modern day one's are Grease, Vincent Price horror movies, Hamer horror films, any Hitchkock TV/Movie, even Julie & Julia. Now Avatar is in my definite ""Love Those"" & I could watch them over & over. The best part is when you've seen a movie so many times that you feel you know all there is to offer, & suddenly you are pleasantly surprised to find that how wrong you were. Admittedly, my top 5 Fav's are in the category of old classics - but This AVATAR version comes closer than anything I have seen in ""Years""..  So- Go for it - Do Not let this movie (this version) not be a part of your movie library &/or to watch & enjoy list.

Seeing the new technology that was created for this via the virtual camera and 3D camera system he used was incredible as well as seeing how much work Weta and everyone involved put into this. From coming up with a full language, to developing an entire cultural history to creating every single item of clothing, armor and weapons used by the digital characters to be used as models, motion guides and textures was above and beyond. Cameron is nothing short of one of the most dedicated film artists out there at the moment and how much work he puts into his projects is truly astounding.

However, I have now had two different sets of this DVD, and both exhibit huge problems in playback of the extended version of the DVD (with the extra 16 minutes).  I like to think I have pretty much state of the art home theater equipment, including the LG BD590, with all upgrades, and both sets I have had to date exhibit a terrible habit of jumping, sometimes several whole chapters.  This does not appear to be a random issue, because when I go back and try to replay the same material, it jumps exactly the same way.  In watching the Collector's Extended Version on the first set, I watched the 3 hour movie in just 2 hours because of the jumps.  I returned the first set to Amazon, who promptly sent a second set.  The second set does the same way.  I tried to play it on a different blu ray DVD player, and the disc menu did not even load!  I sure this is a great product, but it sure would be nice to have a set that plays correctly and doesn't skip around.

I purchased Avatar on Bluray from Amazon when it came out, loved it, but wanted to get a copy with all the extras, and yesterday walking through the store on my way out I saw a display for the Avatar 3 Disc Extended Collectors Edition. I was in a hurry, so I grabbed one and was on my way.
After getting it home and opening it to watch, I realized I grabbed the DVD version. Oh well, I would watch it and give it away when I got the Bluray version......
Now I don't know if this is standard practice or not, but it really frost's my ...... well I am very un-happy that in order to watch any of the three versions you must switch discs half way through the movie. Seriously??
 I don't generally buy ""Fantastic 3 Disc Super Collector Mega Re-release"" sets, and if this is common practice, I won't be doing it agian.

But.....
I was suprised how much I personally enjoyed Disc 3 though, seeing everything that went into Avatar from the first thoughts about doing it to the the completed film was fantastic.
So it wasn't all bad ...... Disc three is great in my opinion, I just watched all the extra scenes, and the deleted/un-finished scenes straight from Disc 3.",1292371200,,1229,4.316017316017316

Once you put the disk in the player, you will see nothing on the screen for a while. I think we were waiting for several minutes watching a blank screen until we finally saw the studio logo. Then you wait some more while the warning shows up. Finally after waiting and watching a blank screen, the main menu eventually will show. Don't expect everything to work right either. I tried to use the BDLive feature with a high speed memory flash drive in the slot of my player and couldn't get most things to play right without crashing the system.

I was holding out for this collector's edition, and man, is it awesome! If you have any interest in how movies are made I would highly recommend buying this version. There is extensive behind the scenes footage of scenes not only that were taken out of the movie, but also scenes that were not completely animated, which really makes you appreciate how much went into the animation. Also, there are three different versions of the movie in this set and each extended scene really gives you a better sense of the movie and the characters.

3932621,5,B002HEXVUI,"When I saw the ads for Avatar last year, I have to say I was very excited. According to Fox and James Cameron this film will change the face of cinema and the way we saw movies will never be the same after Avatar. Boy, that was a lot to take and like a lot (and a lot) of people around the globe I couldn't wait to see it in the big screen. Finally the day came and I went to see it anticipating a wholle new era for films. This are my thoughts after I saw it in theaters:

The film brakes new ground in every possible technological aspect. Pandora is a masterful creation and is the greatest scenary I've seen. I can't believe all that world was done in computers. It looks so real and breathtaking. Performance capture was also promoted to a whole new level and the Na'vi and Avatars look so real that was indeed a whole new experience in this aspect.

While visually the movie has no match, in the story department it lags a little. A cliche story, enviromental message, some wooden performance and a not so original screenplay detracts the movie from being the true New Cinema face that Fox was claiming.

Nonteheless with this problems, the movie is really solid entertainment. While you might pick some of this problems, your experience will still be pleasant and you are for a real treat in the world of Pandora.

After I watch the movie in theaters, I knew that this movie was great if somewhat overrated.

While I did like the film I am not a die-hard fan of it. I never bought the barebones Bluray that came last April knowing that a better edition will come. And what an edition it is!!

Avatar looks fanatastic in bluray, in fact I think is the best bluray transfer I've seen. Is even more breathtaking than in theaters. Sound is equally impressive, very dynamic and clear.

In this edition you can choose for three versions of the film: the theatrical edition, the special edition re-release (with eight more minutes) and an all-new extended edition (with 16 more minutes). I haven't seen the extended edition yet but soon I will and will update this with my apreciation of it.

This is a three disc blu-ray set so you have 2 bd discs full of Avatar goodies. You have 45-minutes of deleted scenes some of which I would've liked to see in the final version. ""Capturing Avatar"" is an hour and a half documentary that covers everything on the production of the film and is fantastic.

YOu also have galleries, deconstructions of scenes, an enviromental documentary called ""a message from Pandora"", screen tests, trailers and more. Without a doubt this set is one of the best of this year and one of the best ever.

While checking other reviews, I saw a lot of negative reviews which only argument for a one-star review is that this set is lacking a 3d blu-ray. While I understand that some people is into 3d (I'm not) and Avatar is the best 3d film out there, awarding one star to an excellent set like this one just because of that seems rubbish. Come on, if you double-dip from the barebone BD to this set, you also will buy the 3d BD when it arrives. You must understand that Fox will milk this film as much as it can and I'm not saying that is correct but that is the way it is. For the majority of us who hasn't ""upgraded"" or care about 3d this set is the definitive edition of Avatar.

Overall my score is like this:
Movie 4/5
Picture 5/5
Sound 5/5
Bonus features 5/5

3932631,5,B002HEXVUI,"The first thing I notice is the extreme packaging - a slip-off sleeve, then a box cover containing a book with three really fancy pages with a pull-out disc holder - all with very nice depiction of AVATAR scenes over every visible inch of the packaging.  All this hints that something special lies inside.

And you won't be disappointed - at least I wasn't - and it was well worth the price.

DISC 1 - AVATAR
 Disc Menu: PLAY / SETUP / SOUND / SEARCH / EXTRAS

This disc contains three versions of AVATER:
1) original movie release
2) Special Edition DVD Re-release (with 8 additional minutes), and
3) Collector's Extended Cut (with 16 additional minutes)

If you saw the movie, then you've seen version 1.  If you bought the DVD, then you've seen version 2.  What you want to see now is version 3, the Collector's Extended Cut, with 16 additional minutes.

If you just click on the PLAY menu choice, you'll get version 1.  To play version 2 or 3, click first on SETUP - FILM SELECTION, then choose the Special Addition Re-release, or the Collector's Extended Cut.  The Collector's Extended Cut contains all the scenes in versions 1 and 2, plus the additional scenes, so no need to view versions 1 or 2, even if you haven't seen the movie yet.

Under the SOUND menu is an option to have all the swear words deleted from the sound track, but it doesn't work for version 3, Collector's Extended Cut, which is the version you want to watch, and the swearing is very light, no ""f"" words.

Under EXTRAS menu are all the added scenes, which is handy of you fall asleep watching the Extended Cut movie (as I did) and want to see if you missed anything new.

DISC 2 - FILMAKER'S JOURNEY
Disc Menu: DELETED SCENES / CAPTURING AVATAR / A MESSAGE FROM PANDORA / PRODUCTION MATERIAL

The best thing about Disc 2 are the more than 45 minutes of ""Deleted Scenes.""  There are many of them, all in various stages of completion, and all but two add considerably to understanding the story line, especially ""Dream Hunt"" and ""Challenge.""  The two deleted scenes that should stay deleted are : ""Norm is a God,"" and ""Norm's attitude Improves.""  The Deleted Scenes are the next place to go after viewing the ""Extended Collector's Cut"" on Disc 1.

""Capturing Avatar"" is about how the film married real human facial expression and human movement to the animated AVATAR scenes.  It is very interesting to see.

""A Message form Pandora"" is about James Cameron going down to the Amazon Basin in Brazil and joining the jungle tribes fighting against the construction of a dam.  If there was any doubt that Cameron was anything other than a dedicated tree-hugging environmentalist, this will dispel all doubts.

DISC 3 - PANDORA'S BOX
This disc primarily has items a filmmaker might be interested in,

The BD-Live portal is also on disc 3, which allows you to download additional material.  I tried this but found nothing new that wasn't already on one of the three discs, and also the download was very slow.

MY TAKE ON THIS EDITION OF AVATAR

I am a civil engineer who thinks bulldozers and mining equipment are righteous and good.  I suppose in an environmentalist's eyes I have done my share of raping the environment, although the way I see it, natural resources are there to be utilized.  I do believe, however, that the resources need to be used wisely and efficiently and that renewable resources should be harvested by sustainable methods, and the earth returned to a green state after opening it and harvesting whatever is there.

I present the above, because it is very clear that AVATAR is permeated with tree-hugging, environmentalist propaganda.  And Cameron so much as admits it in ""A Message from Pandora"" on Disc 2.  Nevertheless, Cameron made a really terrific movie promoting environmentalist concerns, though probably his message is totally lost on sinners like myself.

Still, I very much like this movie and especially the Collector's Cut, because 1) it is so realistically done, 2) because it is an exciting adventure story with lots of very dangerous creatures, 3)because it is also a love story, and 4) because it is a hero story - the little guy fighting the faceless bureaucracy of a large corporation or government.

As someone who has thrice married into different cultures in different countries, and experienced the somewhat difficult task of adjusting to and accommodating a foreign culture, I think Cameron has done a good job presenting the difficulty and opposition that naturally occurs against inter-cultural romance, and much more so for inter-specie romance, even if it is through a remotely controlled avatar body.  Much of this opposition was deleted in the original movie, but is evident in the added scenes, and especially the Deleted Scenes.

SUMMARY
The extra scenes in the Collector's Extended Cut (Disc 1), and the Deleted Scenes (Disc 2) by themselves make this set well worth the price, and a story worth watching over and over, all the while hoping for a sequel.  If you are also into how movies are made, there are plenty of ground-breaking techniques presented on Disc's 2 and 3.

THE SEQUEL
My idea of what would be an interesting sequel -
Jake and Neytiri  have a baby or two.  Jake leads the Navi to develop some technology to prepare for the return of the Earthers but find the Navi uninterested.  Jake remembers how European settlers arrived in America in such overwhelming numbers that the natives were completed subjugated and near annihilated.  He fears that unless the Navi modernize to some degree, at least the military, the same will happen to the Navi when the Earthers eventually return for revenge.

Jake goes to the Tree of Souls and discovers Grace has merged with Eywa and can communicate with Jake.  Jake and Grace discover they can reach each other telepathically.  Grace-Eywa has some ability to sense events beyond the planet-moon's surface.  Grace and Jake begin to develop their telepathic powers, and discover thay also have some telekinetic powers

By the time the Earthers return, Jake and Grace can affect the control mechanisms on the Earthers ships.

[Take it from there, Cameron ...]",1291939200,4,6138,4.80648236415634
3932632,4,B002HEXVUI,"12/27/10 - UPDATE. Found out that the issue was not with anything other than the old Powerdvd software. I found a Cyberlink update (posted 12/13 - build 3608) that solved the problem. I changed my rating to 4 because the disc itself was only part of the problem. If the movie performed flawlessly I would have rated it 5 because it's very entertaining and I loved it. However, Fox's decision to use the version of DRM that it did caused nothing but headaches for legions Avatar of fans. And for what? I understand that it was cracked on the first day. Anyway, DRM sucks badly and the constantly changing Blu-ray standard sucks as well. But the movie is a gem and highly recommend it.

Original post - My HTPC won't play the Blu-ray Avatar disc. Thought it might be my old (quirky) Lite On DH-401S drive. There was no firmware update newer than 2 years ago. I was also using the OEM Powerdvd software that came with the drive and I thought that might have something to do with it as well. Keep in mind that every other BR title in my collection plays (Toy Story 3, Taken, How to Train Your Dragon, Star Trek, Transformers, etc.). So I bought a new Samsung SH-B123 drive and Powerdvd 9. Made sure the latest drive firmware was installed, any patches for the Powerdvd 9 and the latest Catalyst drivers. I fully expected the Avatar BR to play, but it does the exact same thing. Loads, but never makes it to previews or the menu. Thinking I might have a bad disc, I took it to my Dad's house and it played. Now I'm what's going on here? After doing some basic research I come to find out that a lot of people are complaining because the DRM encryption is preventing legitimate owners from viewing the movie. Not sure it's worth the hassle of trying to return it, but I definitely NOT buy any title that has DRM encryption.",1291939200,,1817,4.407738095238095

I was deeply disappointed to discover that all three versions of the movie is presented in two parts on two separate discs.  It is technologically possible to put a 3 hour movie on 1 disc...look at King Kong or The Lord Of The Ring Trilogy by Peter Jackson.  Then there is the Blu-ray version of the Extended Collector's Edition which has all three versions of Avatar on 1 disc.  In my humble opinion, the DVD version of the Extended Collector's Edition should have included the extended cut, special bonus features that takes the viewer behind the scenes and a digital copy of the Theatrical version.

3932641,1,B002HEXVUI,"Let this serve as a warning to the brave few who have managed to avoid watching this film so late in the game... DON'T DO IT !!! I finally got around to watching this film, after hearing a constant stream of praise for it from friends and co-workers for probably over a year now. Despite all of the constant praise I heard, something in my subconscious was telling me ""Do not even bother with this film"", and let me tell you, I should've listened to myself. This film was just atrocious, and I will never trust in James Cameron again, because his last two major releases were total stinkers, regardless of how much money they may have made. First of all, there is absolutely no substance in this film.  The story itself is so cliche and predictable that it made me cringe. This plot has been done about a thousand times before, usually in Disney films.  There is nothing new here story wise, and it is painfully obvious that all of the efforts in making this film were put into the visual effects. Unfortunately, the visual effects were not very good!  I found the Avatars to be fake looking and totally distracting. There really weren't any great set pieces that grabbed me. It was way too long and about two thirds of the movie had me bored to tears. I literally was smacking myself in the face about halfway through the movie struggling to stay awake...Just hoping for that big payoff in the end. Never got it. The fact that this film had enough repeat viewers to earn the number one all-time rank in the box office has me questioning the current state of humanity.  How could anyone sit through this more than once? It's like digital vallium. If you really need to see an over-hyped, big special effects movie, rent Inception instead.

3932643,1,B002HEXVUI,"Is there anyone around who remembers when DVDs first came out and you had to FLIP the disc half way through to see a whole movie? This was solved by the advent of reverse spiral technology (which is why DVDs pause slightly half way through so the disc can start reading backwards from the center of the disc -- much better than having to get up and FLIP it). Before the DVD format went universal, DVD fanatics had a standing joke about the new reverse spiral technology: ""You know you are a DVD junkie when you drive to work forwards and then drive home backwards."" Hopefully, you get my drift. Heck, we even used to make lists of when the pause happened in all the new DVDS coming out, we were so grateful there were no more flippers!

Sadly, this new Avatar set brings back the days of yore by making us get up and change discs to see the whole film. Now we're not just flipping, we have to juggle multiple discs as well! Avatar is one giant leap for the movies, but this new Blu-Ray set is two giant leaps backward in time to a place we never want to go back to again. Return to the future takes on a whole new meaning.

If I could give this item NO STARS I would have done it on this principle alone (as there was no reason to split the movie -- each version should have been put on its own disc), not to mention the packaging which scratches and ruins the discs before you can even take them out to play them.

The first iteration of Avatar on Blu-Ray had player issues which unfortunately still have not been addressed. When it does play there is a lot of skipping, which appears to be chapter rather than scratch related.

So I ordered another.  And it skipped AGAIN!  And in the exact same spot!; immediately after the first jungle scene where Dr. Augustine says, ""Prolemuris, they're non-agressive.  Relax marine, you're making me nervous"".  It jumps forward to Jake Sully walking toward the spiral flowers.

Anybody have the same issue?

This is obviously a blu-ray construction issue, as it makes no sense for my Blu-ray player, which is brand new by the way, to jump so specifically.  It's very irritating.

Initial releases never said much about extra footage. I heard rumors from the beginning, and made my husband wait to order.

This is a joy to watch, and all the extra features are fascinating, with several unfinished scenes that didn't make the cut.

I loved how the unfinished extra scenes show how there are several steps to the process....  They also show more of the background story.

Love it, love it, love it!

The only thing I don't like is blu-ray players never keep up with the blu-ray discs, and we get all kinds of pop-ups like with an old computer. A movie should not require memory chips. =(",1291161600,,656,4.564102564102564

Avatar is a movie that really deserves to be seen in theaters, nothing else really does it justice.  BUT, as far as blu-ray releases go, this is one of the best I've bought.  The visuals are stunning as is the sound and the special features are great.  One of the highlights for me is the scene deconstruction where you can watch about half of the scenes in the movie along with the original motion capture performance.  It's pretty cool to see how accurately the actor's performances were portrayed by the CGI characters.
As far as the extended cut goes, I didn't really care for it.  The extra 16 minutes weren't really necessary for the film, although they did add a little bit... they really just made the movie seem longer but not better.  It took away from the pacing of the film which I think the theatrical release got perfectly.

3932662,3,B002HEXVUI,"Overall, while the movie is visually dramatic and slightly overstimulating, the story was lacking in depth, as were the characters.  I expected a ""wow"" story based on all the media hype.
The story follows the main character, a Marine, who is dealing with the loss of use in his legs, and the loss of his brother.  He's offered a unique assignment, to take his brother's place, on a distant planet, in a sort of scientific experiment of sorts.  Even though he has no training (his brother trained for months or years), he accepts.  Why?  Boredom, lack of direction, curiosity, or stupidity, you name it.  He arrives on the planet, to step into his new job, and his brother's shoes, and oh yeah, take over his brother's Avatar, the science grown alien body that he can link his conscious mind to (because he has the same DNA as his brother) so he can learn about, study, and infiltrate the alien species that the military has interest in.
This movie, is obviously, hands down, visually amazing.  I'm not sure anyone could deny that.  The things they did and pushed to do, with technology are astounding, really.  And the movie is very visual.  I did find myself thinking, it was overdone.  It felt to me as if there was too much going on visually, like they overdid the visual effects and animation, just because they could.  And I don't think it needed all of it (example: how every plant in the new world did something extraordinary).
However, I found the story lacking.  It lacked depth in story and in characters.  I don't think it had anything to do with the actors.  I wasn't hooked on the Marine, as a person of interest and the main character, the hero of the movie.  I wasn't hooked on his world, and his plight.  I wasn't captured by his story, his dreams or his demons.  I didn't buy in to him at all.  I was more captured by the amazing visuals, that the hero was more like ""okay, whatever"".
In stark contrast, ""Terminator"", one of Cameron's previous films, everyone was hooked to Sarah Conner.  The edge of your seat, hold your breath, hooked on what was going to happen to her, that you ended up becoming a huge cheerleader for her survival.  Even, ""Titanic"" had a captivating story.  Not so with this movie's story or characters.
A bit of a let down for me.
I'm undecided on whether I would buy this for my collection or not.  This movie would be a purchase if I had to have just for the visuals and the action, otherwise I would pass.  It is worth seeing, just to see how far technology has come, if that type of thing interests you.",1291075200,4,2547,4.4750542299349245

Obviously the plot of this story is not original, but the movie as a whole gives an awesome effect that leaves me exhilarated every time I watch it. The graphics are great and really show you what Bluray can do.

I really like what they put in here... But I just wished that the contents of the DVD edition and Blu-Ray edition were the same (except for the BD live probably)... I just felt that the studios are forcing us to really buy a Blu-Ray player in order to see all the wonderful bonus features that are exclusive to BD Live.

I also wished that they sticked with the plastic case because the one I got goes with a metal case. It's not very sturdy and it's very sensitive - can be easily dented.

Overall I liked it because of the added features. Also we are given the option to see three versions of the movie. If only they released the extended collector's edition and put the entire movie in one disc and had all the features in the other two... that would've been nice.

3932670,3,B002HEXVUI,"Great movie but when you factor it won't play on a lot of players even if they are updated to current firmware and that disks get scratches easy in their cardboard pull out sleeves its not worth more than about 15$.  Disks are loose with nothing securing them from sliding.  For me 2 out of our 3 players wouldnt work, I keep my units up to date with latest updates from manufacturers.  The one that does play it loads slooooooooow, most disks load in 15 seconds, this one takes several mins.  Studio is trying to rake in the money with a triple release: incomplete first release with no extras, current release poorly implemented very bad packaging except for the outer keep case, and a 3rd 3D release.  Disks are not secure in the packaging and can easily be scratched.  A cheap CD pouch would work but why not make good packaging for the consumer up front?  Maybe Fox will do another release down the line that corrects some of these problems. I hope that the manufacturer pays attention to the high number of negative reviews on Amazon.  As far as Blu-ray its a shame the studios didn't see the merits of HD-DVD disks which load much faster and look just as good.  Players are finally reasonable but with the disk issues and disclaimer that comes with many current releases its just sad. Consumers shouldn't have to wonder whether a disk they buy at the store will play on their unit.  You should be able to buy a player that will work period, this is why DVD sales are still strong and Bluray is only slowly being adopted.

I have changed my rating on this review from 1 to 3 stars due to the fact that the movie itself is fantastic.  Image quality is gorgeous and this is a sci-fi must have film.  As long as you take care of the disks by keeping them in a seperate DVD pouch you can keep them functioning.  Implementation of this release and the way the Blu-ray disks are stored deserves only 1 star, however due to this being a rich movie experience for anyone who loves Sci-Fi to be fair it balances out a little.

My recomedation is to buy this one used on Ebay and keep your disks safe in a DVD/bluray pouch.  It would be nice if they recalled the packaging and gave everyone a descent case that actually protects the disk.  This case reminds me of the cardboard Wall-E case which was also horrible and falls apart.  For something that retails 50 clams thats just not right.

In the 3-disk set for Avatar, there are many extras worth getting for fans of the movie.  The 16 minutes added to the ""Collectors"" extended cut of the movie are very good, and do change my impression of the movie.
(If the change is good or bad, I'm not sure.  But I don't think the ""Collectors"" cut of the movie would have done as well in theatres as it makes the movie seem darker and more serious than the original.)
The beginning is very ""Blade Runner""-esque, and you get to see the school and hear more of the story of why they shut in down.... ok, I don't want to give away too much.

The 45 minutes of deleted scenes are fun to watch.  There is a brief love sequence that was edited out of the movie (and it's not who you think).  And there are two very elaborate ""tribal"" dance numbers that are worth checking out.

But didn't we all know that they were going to release a better editon in the future? If you really wanted all of the features without buying the first one, then you should have waited until this edition came out, no matter how long it took. If you are complaining about how you bought the first edition and feel ""ripped off"" because they are releasing a better edition, here is a little advice. Don't buy it, it's that simple! They never said that they intended for everyone to buy the first edition, and then get more money by releasing another and making you buy that one. They are not ""making"" you buy it, it's all your own choice. Stop flooding this page with bad reviews complaining about something you don't even have.

3932674,3,B002HEXVUI,"IMO, the success of Avatar has hurt films by helping to lower expectations and attention spans. I ask myself how films like Lawrence of Arabia, Spartacus, Ben Hur, The Red Shoes, Scenes from a Marriage, Ran, La Dolce Vita, even Vertigo or Citizen Kane would be received by today's filmgoer or for that matter if those type of films would have even been made if gimmicks like CGI and 3d had been around then?
It's impossible to spoil this film because it's been done so many times. Here's what it's about in a nutshell: Soldier infiltrates alien tribe. Becomes one of them. Kills ugly bird. Tames giant multicolored bat. Falls in love with alien girl. Has second thoughts about mission. Switches sides. Becomes leader of tribe, helps them fight off greedy humans. The end.
I told you you've seen it before, but, unlike Cameron's past films which always had little surprises at the end, the average filmgoer who's not a total moron can see how this'll end in the very beginning as soon as he hears Jake Sully's voice over, a la Harrison Ford's voice over in Bladerunner that this film, especially the director's cut, makes obvious reference to. The draw to see this film is not what, as in what happens, but in how, as in how they show this film, which is the best use of 3d in any film done since. The biggest problem with this film is that it leaves no room for me to decide what I want to think. This is about as black and white as you can get. The aliens, modeled after all cultures that were overrun and exploited by western civilization, are totally innocent and good, and the despoilers, the earthlings, are totally greedy and evil. in other words, the characters were too one-dimensional for me to care anything for. So when the film kicks into high gear and when the good guys and bad guys started going at it, I didn't care who won but who really cared because it just looked really cool anyway.

I've noticed a sharp dropoff in quality American films in the last 2 decades since the emergence of cgi. Thank goodness for foreign films although I wonder how much pressure they are under to dummy down their films with gimmicks to get their movies seen over here. The actors are even getting worse, nowadays who needs to act? Just ask Vin Diesel, the Rock, Cameron Diaz, etc. Really, the main draw of going to see today's film is to have stuff thrown at you for 2 hours.
And another thing: Cameron was wrong! 3d has not ""changed the world."" In fact, in case anyone hasn't noticed it, the only movies done (and will be done) in 3d are dumb braindead summer movies. That's right. Can you see someone 30+ going to see, let's say, The Godfather in 3d!!!; Citizen Kane, The Red Shoes, Dr. Zhivago, The Ice Storm, M, The French Connection, Belle Du Jour, Schindler's List, The Battle of Algiers, Battleship Potompken, Bladerunner, etc., (whew) in 3d? Can you imagine directors like Clint Eastwood (who seemingly has no taste for 3d), Pedro Amoldovar, the Coen brothers, Peter Greenaway, etc., alienating their fans by coming out with a 3d movie? And I'd hope that by the time someone hit their 30's they'd look to something more substantial to draw them into a film. I guess next they'll come up with 3d literature, like popups, words that pop off the page.
Lastly I want to say this: while I did enjoy Avatar as entertainment, I hope that it never receives recognition for being one of the great films in some future list. That would be a tragedy and a sad commentary on human evolution in my opinion, that we're moving back down the ladder. I CAN wait for Avatar 2!",1290816000,3,3567,4.538819875776397

I've had two different copies of it and both had the same problem. I have tried them on 2 different BluRay players, both Sony's, one an S370 and the other an S570. Both have all of the latest firmware and neither is over a month old.
With both machines it takes nearly a minute for anything to show up on the screen. And then it's a message about the disc being made with the latest tech. Eventually that screen disappears and the screen is black. At this point you're likely to give up, but if you leave it alone for a couple of minutes you'll eventually get the opening logo.
Basically it just takes too long for anything to happen, not just at the beginning but any time you select from the main menu.

I saw the movie twice in the theatre in 3D and also bought the early release in late April, so I am familiar with the movie. As for the set, I think that most (not all) of the additions in the 16 minute added version were worthwhile. The main reason I bought the set was for the special features on the other two discs. The documentary on disc two is wonderful. The Scene Deconstruction on disc three reinforced the material in the documentary and was a revelation. I decided to  watch it in the performance capture mode with the actors on the set. It amazed me how accurately all the nuances of an actors performance have been preserved in the final digital rendition. I also loved the 'Message from Pandora' showing James Cameron and the others with the  rain forest natives in Brazil, and working to stop construction of the dams on the Xingu River. For those who love the movie, I highly recommend this set.",1290643200,5,998,4.50828729281768
3932684,4,B002HEXVUI,"*** WARNING!*** Possible spoilers for two excellent movies follow:

I haven't had the heart to write the review that reflected my impression to watching this admittedly impressive film a year ago.

You couldn't miss the hype if you owned a television - I was an American serviceman stationed overseas and I knew well that it was a movie that featured exotic blue people, and people like Roger Ebert were giving the film the highest praise.

I paid my 2000 yen to watch the film in a theatre with kanji subtitles playing beneath the original English soundtrack.  I was ready to be DAZZLED.

The film started.... I started to be dazzled... Then, about thirty minutes into it I started thinking ""hey... WAIT a MINUTE!""

There was an absolutely excellent film.  It won seven Academy Awards, including Best Film, and was nominated for five others. ***HERE COME THE SPOILERS***  In this film a young soldier is injured, then sent to a remote location near mysterious indigenous people.  The healing soldier is assigned to infiltrate the indigenous people - to spy on them and report back to headquarters his findings.  But the soldier instead finds the indigenous people fascinating and in his attempts to infiltrate them he instead begins to find the indigenous people and their in-harmony-with-nature lifestyle superior to the life he had been living previously.  He joins the tribe and becomes one of their leaders and protectors, eventually coming into conflict with his original culture - those who sent him - as he defends his new culture.

Of course the movie I'm describing is Kevin Costner's masterpiece ""Dances with Wolves"", and although James Cameron's ""Avatar"" is visually stunning, its plot is utterly stolen from the earlier film.  How was THAT information not passed in the maelstrom of hype that compelled me to plunk down my 2000 yen?  I would have been mentally and emotionally much more forgiving.

""It's `Dances with Wolves' in outer space with Blue natives"", someone could have alerted me, and I'd have gone into the film with a different expectation.  If you give credit where it is due (i.e. not plagiarize) beforehand, I can enjoy your piece of art knowing that you developed it from some previously existing art.  But if you plagiarize, and I KNOW you're plagiarizing and you didn't fess up beforehand... it's unsettling.  Theft of intellectual property is a big thing.

If ""Dances"" had never existed, and ""Avatar"" suddenly appeared, I would have liked it as well as Roger Ebert.  The visuals ARE dazzling.  The story certainly IS a unique re-interpretation of the previous movie.  The CGI effects make you believe the nine-feet-tall Na'vi scamper through the exotic forests and ride dragons.  Excellent acting from Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang and Giovanni Ribisi are on display.

But when I hear that a movie is ""original"" one of the most important things that I expect to be original is the plot, and thirty minutes into this film I knew every scene that would follow.  That is a disappointment when you were expecting to be dazzled.",1290556800,5,3087,4.982421875
3932685,5,B002HEXVUI,"ok, if you are a fan of Avatar, and I mean the fan that watches it more than once and most likely went to the re-release in the Theater in Aug to see the extended version, and loved THAT and still wanted more?? THIS GIVES YOU MORE. more scenes and some behind the scences/making of! ANDthere are 3 versions of the movie in this set..the original movie version released in theaters, the extended version released in theaters, *AND* a ""collector's extended version"" NOT released in theaters but has more of the movie in it! whole scenes that were cut out (that I think made it better), portions of scenes that didn't even make it into version #2 that added more depth to the movie;(like what happened to Nyteri's sister). I watched it last night and it is better than the original. If you are a big fan of this movie, you will be happy with this collection.

**NOTE this set is NOT in 3D, (I saw that in the theater too, it was...distracting...you couldn't see anything in the peripherals of the scenes...) but it is still so very vibrant and enthralling, you won't miss the 3D",1290556800,3,1075,4.48469387755102
3932686,4,B002HEXVUI,"I liked Avatar when I saw it in IMAX 3D.  It was fun, beautiful to look at, and used 3D in a way that few films do.  I also thought the acting was mediocre at best, the story cliched and predictable, and the ending to be more than a little ridiculous.  I also found Sam Worthington flat and frankly an unlikeable protagonist as Jake Sully.  Still, it had a lot of great action and great visual effects.  Obviously, I was in the minority as to my thoughts on the quality of the movie as a whole, as the film is now the highest grossing of all time, and people seem to really love it.  And good for them.  I don't see a lot of the re-watch value in this film, especially without the 3D and on a smaller screen though.  So I avoided the first blu-ray release and then borrowed this from a friend to see the added story elements and watch the making of documentary features.  And on that second point, I'm glad I watched them.  The second disc is pretty much why blu-ray was invented.  It's packed to the gills with interviews, concept art, effects tests and so much behind the scenes footage that they could sell it as a stand-alone disc and I would be inclined to but it.  For tech geeks and people who love to see how movies get made, the two Blu-ray discs with the extras are well worth watching, and if you love Avatar, this would have to be a must own.

As to the film itself, well, on the first disc you get three versions of the film.  The first version is the original Theatrical Cut, which really drags in a second viewing if you just thought the film was ok.  I then ignored the re-release cut and when to the collectors addition cut that features 16 more minutes of movie, including a new opening on earth, and a lot of extra back story that fleshes out SOME character motivations, but also does nothing to make me like Sully any more than I did the first time.  The Na'Vi are still, to me, just another take on the ""noble savage"" characterization that you used to find in Westerns.  The reasons why the ""unobtanium"" is so hard to extract are still vague and Quaritch is still a thin villain.  The final battle is expanded a bit, and that's fine, so if you're a fan, this is pretty much the edition to get.

Based on the quality of the special features and the three editions of the film on one blu-ray, I'd bump up my 3 of 5 star rating for the film to a 4 of 5 star rating for the whole package.  If you loved Avatar in the theater, you'll love this.  Anyone who didn't love the movie but loves the making of movies will love the extras as well.",1290556800,,2555,4.194672131147541
3932687,3,B002HEXVUI,"First off, why oh why did we have to have the Theatrical Version in this set? I bought that DVD six months ago. We don't need a repeat here! The Special Edition isn't really even necessary, either, since all of those scenes and more are actually in the Extended Cut. I guess that one's for people who only want to see a few of the added scenes, but not all. Maybe they're running short on time that day or something. Frankly, if I'm gonna watch extra scenes, just show all of them to me.

So, they put the first half of three different versions of the movie on disc 1 and the second half of these versions on disc 2. I hate that!! I thought I was done with changing discs mid-movie when Dances with Wolves and The Green Mile did that years ago. I know they can put a 3-hour movie on one disc. I see miniseries and TV show discs all the time with at least three hours on them!

The packaging is 50/50. The outer layers are great. I love the book style with the slipcovers over them. I thought it would unfold like the Fox TV series of Buffy or Angel. No. It opens like a book and each disc has a carboard sleeve that slides out of the end of each page. Rough cardboard sleeves that the disc slides around in during shipping and handling. YOUR DISCS WILL BE SCUFFED OR SCRATCHED WHEN YOU OPEN IT.

So, my idea would have been: put all of the Special Edition on Disc 1 (for those who wanted to see that version), put all of the Extended Cut on Disc 2 (my favorite) and leave Disc 3 with the featurettes and deleted scenes as it is. Think a little, people! Don't just cram all the crap you can find on a ""Collector's Edition"" set and throw it in there all willy-nilly. And switch to a more orthodox way of disc storage so as not to damage them before we ever get them, please? This set could have been as wonderful as I think the movie is. 5 for the movie. 3 for the DVDs.",1290556800,91,1868,4.098360655737705

3932690,3,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is an impressive looking film with an overly simple story that makes us feel we've been here before. This is a strange feeling to get from a film that looks like nothing we've ever seen before. The story is basically 'Dances with Wolves' ala sci-fi with a little mix of our own American history thrown in with our treatment of the American Indian. The film is better than I expected and it's certainly worth seeing... especially in HD! WOW! The characters look fairly believable, but none have any real depth, so caring for these creatures is pretty nonexistent.

The story is very predictable and I was telling my wife exactly what was going to happen after the first 15 minutes or so. Send in someone to gain their trust and then stab them in the back for accepting them!.....Blah blah blah! It's all been done before and I'm surprised that Cameron didn't develop a better script considering the amount of work that went it to the visual aspect of this film.

If you're a sci-fi fan, prepare for an amazing looking film with a very unsatisfying story. If you're looking for deeper dramas, then this one could be a little light for you.",1290470400,3,1144,4.602941176470588

3932692,4,B002HEXVUI,"I want to preface this review that as much as I am happy to see the quality in Blu Ray, there really needs to be some kind of standard that makes it easier to stop playing guessing games as to if a product will play in your machine or device.

The first release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar-Two-Disc-Original-Theatrical-Edition-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B002VPE1B6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar (Two-Disc Original Theatrical Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>&nbsp;of this product plays just fine in my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LITE-ON-4x-Blu-ray-Disc-SATA-Internal-Optical-Drive-iHOS104/dp/B002EE996Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LITE-ON 4x Blu-ray Disc SATA Internal Optical Drive iHOS104</a>&nbsp;player. So when I start up this set in my player, I encounter the problem ""This content Does not support the use of a mouse""

It seemed to be kind enough to pop up one note about going to a site to figure out if your firmware or device could play it. The problem was, we only got this message once and could never get it to run again. So after sleuthing on the net to find out what to do - a warning for you PC owners who run blu Ray with PowerDVD - version 8 doesn't seem to want to run this disc. You need a later version and need to either be able to get keyboard shortcuts or the virtual remote option in version 10

I wanted to post that information in case someone else is looking for a solution or help some people out. As a consumer I feel like we're caught in the middle of this finger pointing game as to what works and what doesn't and why.

As for the product. DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY. All the extras and features I waited for. The first release I knew didn't have it and waited for this one. I was watching with a friend and we were delighted by the new footage for this movie. The fact you keep receiving new content with the BDJ Live is interesting.

Obviously the story isn't something we're unfamiliar with but the quality of the CG is top notch. All the work that went into rendering the forest, trees and characters set a new standard. However, it wasn't without some drawbacks. I think Cameron can ease up on the ""slowmo"" on certain action shots. It actually pulled me out of the experience of forgetting they were CG characters, because it caused those very characters to exhibit movements that were just a bit ""foreign"". Oddly enough I found the bipedal mechs too ""Rubbery"" compared to the organic creatures.

For the quality of the discs, I'm still trying to figure out if it's an issue with PowerDVD the software to watch DVDs or a fimrware issue (I updated to the latest) computer hardware issue or an issue with the DVDs themselves. We experienced some stutters and ""digital"" scrambles during the movie. It wasn't where it became unwatchable but it was annoying enough to notice. The picture quality was incredible however. If I get the chance to own a 3DTV I'd definitely buy the 3D version of this movie.

Despite this though, as I said it is worth purchasing the extended collection as a consumer who waited patiently for this release.",1290384000,,3163,5.1063829787234045

just LOVED the original.  The expanded version just seems to have a

3932695,4,B002HEXVUI,"As a filmmaker, James Cameron is a thrill master, but not a deep thinker. The themes in his films, noble as they are, are nothing new, and his futuristic ideas are old hat compared to what's explored in the best science-fiction literature. His plots are sturdy and formulaic, designed to entertain but not to innovate. The dialogue can be fun, but is often trite and rarely poetic or profound. Yet the man knows how to enthrall and deliver ""shock and awe,"" and along the way he inevitably moves the craft and technology of filmmaking up to a higher level. ""Terminator 2"" dazzled with the new CGI effect of morphing; ""Titanic"" set a new standard for disaster-movie realism; and ""Avatar"" has set the bar higher for digitally created characters and 3D filmmaking. More importantly perhaps, it offers the audience a compelling immersion in a simulated reality, an experience somewhere between watching a movie in a theatre and entering a virtual world in cyberspace.

""Avatar"" is a beautiful movie, stunningly so at times, yet it isn't due to artful cinematography in the sense of poetic images and striking composition. Rather, the visual splendor lies in the inherent beauty of the alien world in which we are immersed. Pandora's lush rain forest, its colorful flora and fauna, the spectacular gorges and long waterfalls, and the moons and blue Jovian-type planet Polyphemus in the sky are rendered with painstaking detail and depth. Cameron has created a convincing exoplanet environment, worth the price of admission all on its own.

Visually, ""Avatar"" owes a debt to artist Roger Dean, known for his Yes album covers in the 1970s. The film's floating ""Hallejulah Mountains"" and dragon-like banshees appear based on the levitating mountains and fantastic dragons of Dean's fantasy-art paintings. There are also resonances of movies like ""The Lost World"" and ""King Kong"" in which dinosaurs and exotic bugs roamed tropical jungles. Most of all, Cameron seemed inspired by his post-Titanic fondness of exploring the deep sea in submersibles; he has transplanted the ocean's bioluminescent fauna and hovering creatures (like jellyfish) in altered forms into a rain-forest environment.

At moments, the phosphorescent colors are a little too intense and feel like an interlude in a '60s ""black light"" room full of psychedelic art; of course, this may endear the movie to future generations of chemically altered viewers. My other minor complaint about the Pandoran reality was Cameron's apparent obsession with optical fibers, tendril-like versions of which keep popping up all over the place, from the Na'vi-animal interfaces to the Tree of Souls. Or perhaps it's an obscure reference to Carlos Castaneda's books, which describe us all as being composed of ""luminous fibers""?

""Avatar"" may have borrowed some ideas or at least names from the great Russian science-fiction authors Arkady and Boris Strugatsky; the brothers' ""Noon Universe"" (or ""World of Noon"") cycle of novels from the 1960s included a lushly forested planet called Pandora populated by a humanoid race called the Nave. Cameron's movie also follows in the footsteps of the Edgar Rice Burroughs ""John Carter of Mars"" novels, as did George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" films. In the John Carter tales, a paralyzed Civil War hero ""incarnates"" in a facsimile of his own body on Mars, where he fights with and against red and green-skinned Martians, falls in love with a red princess, and encounters many strange beasts.

Some have said that ""Avatar"" is yet another story of an individual from a colonialist nation who joins an exploited society, sees the world through their eyes, and becomes a hero or messiah. At the end, he atones for his own culture's imperialistic sins (call it ""white guilt"" if you will, but skin color is not the point). Certainly, ""Avatar"" owes more than a little to movies like ""Dances with Wolves,"" and the Na'vi people resemble lanky ten-foot-tall blue Native Americans and share some of their spirituality. The Na'vi worship nature and have a reverence for all living beings, including those they must kill in order to survive. ""Avatar"" decries the genocide of indigenous peoples and the plundering of nature in order to seize natural resources (unobtainium in this case rather than oil or gold). Casting the Cherokee actor Wes Studi (""Dances with Wolves,"" ""Last of the Mohicans"") as the character Eytucan reinforces the Native-American connection on a subliminal level. Yet while ""Avatar"" is undeniably political, it is mostly archetypal.

""Avatar"" takes us on the hero's journey (as per mythologist Joseph Campbell) or a reluctant hero's adventure (as per screenwriting courses). Stories of outsiders who enter other cultures, endure trials, and become heroes are heard around the world. And the desire of city folk to experience tribal life, at least via a ripping yarn, has probably been a campfire staple ever since most of humanity moved from being hunter-gatherers to farmers and merchants. And doesn't everyone fantasize about starting life completely anew, in another place or time? (In this case, it's with an alien body with working legs in a far-away solar system.)

The movie's title and Jake Sully's conscious immersion in a Na'vi body bring up other spiritual elements. In Hindu mythology, an ""avatar"" is the manifestation of one deity as another (such as Krishna being an avatar, or incarnation, of Vishnu). In video games and virtual reality, an avatar is the on-screen representation of a player, who controls its behavior. For most of the movie, the latter definition applies; the Na'vi is a representation of Jake. He experiences the world remotely through the Na'vi body's senses and controls it like a puppet, while his consciousness remains in his own body. At the end, his mind is transferred to the new body via the Tree of Souls. In other words, he goes from being a ""cyberspace avatar"" to a full, new incarnation. When it happens, are those luminous tendrils/fiber-optic cables channeling Jake's soul (as per much Earthly religious belief) or a neural net that constitutes his mind (as per materialists)? It would appear that they are one and the same on Pandora, as all living organisms are connected there to the same ""bio-botanical neural network."" (On our Earth, science is still working out the riddle of consciousness.)

As a story, ""Avatar"" offers a recycling of familiar elements; as an experience it breaks new ground. In the near future, we will immerse our minds in interactive simulated realities with next-generation goggles, data gloves, or other devices. Let's hope they are as beautiful as the Pandoran world in ""Avatar."" Cameron has delivered the most immersive film to date, one that offers a tantalizing glimpse of the future of entertainment in many realms.",1290384000,2,6782,5.153496821071753

3932700,4,B002HEXVUI,"The Movie

It is quite telling when the machines and guns in a movie have more detail than the characters operating them.

Bad acting, thoughtless dialog, 3D that is interesting for no more than 5 minutes and a plot straight out of Pocahontas didn't win me over in the theater.  ""Unobtanium"" anyone?  I found Avatar to be a B movie in every sense.  You can tell Cameron learned to make movies from Roger Corman, because Avatar shows every cliche this side of Deathsport.  I did like the speed of which the narrative moves - despite it's length, there is a brisk pace to the plot.  And even in its long form here, I actually enjoyed the early scenes of Jake on Earth in this new extended edit.  Why?  There were more people and less computer generated blue Jar Jar Binks clones running around doing things I know aren't real.

Computers have done great things for movies, but give me a muppet or a real person every time. I know when its fake and it takes me out of the movie.  The characters in the movie have little to no depth.  We know the good guys, we know the bad guys and Jake is caught in the middle.  This is great for kids, but at 30 years-old, I need something more conflicting than the one-dimensional, recycled, apologetic groveling Cameron shovels out here.  Despite my recrimination, I'm obviously in the minority.  You have to hand it to Cameron for connecting with his audience.  The box office take speaks for itself.

In the end, Avatar is an experience that succeeds because of noise, machines and guns - everything the narrative supposedly stands against.  Sure it has a ""green message"" but this is still basically a movie with a bunch of Marines running around shooting aliens and robots.  In that sense,  James Cameron hasn't come all that far since Terminator.  There's no reason why that is not a compliment.

The Blu-Ray

Well since this one was shot digitally, it looks fantastic and sounds just as good through my surround system.  I know it was shot and ""animated"" for 3D, but I HATED the 3D in theaters and I tend to enjoy the film much more in standard 2D.  I'll say it - every 3D movie I have ever seen is a gimmicky piece of crap.  Avatar had a soft image in 3D with no shortage of ghosting.  But in little old 2D, it looks and sounds amazing.  The sound design alone is good reason to pop this one in for friends on a Saturday night and crank up the sound.  Worth the purchase.

Fell in love with the movie (and Pandora, were do I get some of those bio-luminescent plants?), disappointed there were none of the usual materials included in that release, perfect timing... here it is, I didn't even have to wait long.

The packing is pathetic, if I had paid more than $19.00 for it I'd probably return it and wait for the next release. Nothing I have purchased in board packaging does not end up scratched no matter how careful I am, the index is printed on a separate piece of paper that flutters to the floor, watch for it.

Worse...The arrangement is beyond comprehension, both the theatrical release and the directors cut are arranged, part 1 (of each) on disc 1, part two (of each) on disc 2, yes, you stop and put in the second disc to see the second half of each version. What were they thinking? Did they not want us to get too involved?

The scenes added to the directors cut, wonderful.
Deleted scenes, presented in a way demonstrates the genius and making of Avatar.
The production videos are fantastic, my only complaint, I could have watched more. I even excuse the dorky bit in the end about ""what making the movie meant to me"", accompanies the credits...
Worth the price if you do not want to wait for them to hear the complaints and re release it... again...

3932702,2,B002HEXVUI,"For those who disapprove or disagree with my review--including the producers/directors/writers of Avatar--I invite them to comment on this review.  A simple negative rating is entirely noninformative.

For sheer special effects and entertainment value, 'Avatar' rates a full '5'.  There is no question that this film is something of a special effects masterpiece.  On the other hand, the movie is also Left/Liberal propaganda in its rankest form and is a prime example of Hollywoodheadessness.  This bias is so obvious that I've knocked a full 3 stars from this otherwise entertaining film.  I am glad to go into details.

1.  The military [very American military] is portrayed  as the brutal destroyers of indigenous peoples i.e. the strong arm of colonialism.  It's almost as if the writers/producers are deliberately sucking up to Obama.

2.  The 'Corporation' [make that Capitalism] is shown as Imperialist and EVIL i.e. this is fascinating in that movies and 'Avatar' are capitalist enterprises.  Then again, nobody has ever seriously argued that Hollywood is wise or politically consistent.

3.  The blue 'Sky People' aren't really all that alien.  They are a composite of the Masai and a Plains' Indian Tribe [probably Lakota]--as such, the 'Sky People' are attitudinally less 'alien' to Western observers [you and me] than were the 'pristine' Masai/Plains' Indians.  On the other hand, the 'Sky People' do have tails.

4.  The natives are depicted as 'at one' with their environment in ways that 'primitive' human tribes never were.  Native American tribes, for example, over-exploited game populations as soon as they acquired horses, firearms and black powder.  Their so-called 'respect' of the environment was, in truth, directly related to their relatively low populations levels and to lack of technologies of overexploit the land.

5.  It must be emphasized that 'intelligent' beings on other worlds will be alien in ways that we can't imagine.  They won't be anything like gentle and attractive, courageous Blue People, at all.  If they as as similar to us as are jellyfish and sea urchins it will be remarkable.

To the directors/producers/writers:  Grow Up!",1290211200,8,2174,5.299120234604105

Worked fine, one tiny little oddity: at three points during the film, the pause menu graphic popped up on its own (scene label, timeline, etc) and the movie kept playing. Menu went away after a couple of seconds. This behavior happened consistently at the same places (I tested it after finishing the movie). Took a moment to upgrade the player's software, problem vanished.

As far as the collection itself-WONDERFUL, for all the reasons many of the other reviewers have noted. I was one of the people who passed on the original blu-ray release, because I had read this one was in the works. Well worth the wait.",1290211200,5,683,4.837606837606837

3932705,5,B002HEXVUI,"""Up ahead was Pandora,"" remarks our central character Jake Sully, and James Cameron has finally unveiled a project to match his planet-size ego. Gazillions of stuff already posted regarding this movie, so chances are I'll only be regurgitating. But I side with all the gushy raves. AVATAR is phenomenal. The CG is bloody brilliant and breathes dimension and life into the twelve-foot-tall Na'Vi. There are significant plot points in the story which echo DANCES WITH WOLVES. In essence, AVATAR is a western masquerading as a sci-fi flick. As far as the premise with the human cripple who casts his awareness into an alien body, off the top of my head, author Lin Carter's Green Star series, written in the 1970s, featured this same basic hook. But AVATAR takes this premise and injects it with solid storytelling, enlivens it with an appealing cast. We sometimes forget that James Cameron, beneath his jonesing for razzle-dazzle, knows how to tell a grand story. Again, the man demonstrates remarkable execution. Man alive, things have come a ways since WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?, hasn't it?

The plotty plot: Jake Sully, a paraplegic ex-Marine, journeys from a dying Earth to the mysterious distant planet, Pandora, and signs up to fill his murdered twin brother's slot in the Avatar project. The inhabitants indigenous to Pandora are called the Na'Vi, and they are humanoid and blue-skinned and twelve-foot-tall. On Pandora, Jake becomes an Avatar driver, able to transfer his consciousness into a clone made up of combined human and Na'Vi DNA. The story's central conflict is that, while the Avatar program is dedicated to peacefully learning about the Na'Vi, there is also a corporate entity backed by a strong military presence intent on harvesting unobtanium, a rare super-conducting mineral, a rich deposit of which lies underneath the local Na'Vi village.

Whether it was a sign from Pandora's goddess or that this dumb grunt exhibits absolutely no fear, Jake's Avatar shockingly gets an in with the hostile Omaticaya clan. And so the corporation also thinks it now has an in. But Jake finds himself wrestling with conflicting allegiances, even as the beautiful Neytiri tutors him in the ways of the Na'Vi. Jake must decide; the Time of Great Sorrow fast approaches. Will it be the blue girl and the exhilarating communion with nature? Or will it be Semper Fi and the Jarhead Clan and a chance to remedy his withered legs? Will it be the carrot or the stick imposed on the Na'Vi?

There really are very few unmissable cinematic events; AVATAR is one of them. The core narrative is not original, but James Cameron embellishes it with such monumental bells and whistles. The CG technology is truly groundbreaking, with eye-popping imagery surfacing every damn minute. I'm not really down with heavy-handed message movies, but I was drawn into the Na'Vi's struggles against the encroaching human predators. You have to credit the cast for making it into a hell of a compelling drama, and Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana generate massive sparks together. Sigourney Weaver plays the tough scientist, and it's probably a wise move to change her character's surname from Shipley to Augustine (""Shipley"" sounds too close to ""Ripley""). Giovanni Ribisi gets the slimy Paul Reiser part from ALIENS. Stephen Lang gets one of the juiciest roles he will ever get as the scary Colonel Miles Quaritch. He's amazing. Anyway, I can't rave enough. Like most of you, I've seen AVATAR a bunch of times now, because this is a picture that rewards you with repeated viewings. It works as a sci-fi adventure film, as an environmental call to arms, as an emotional human drama, as a love story. And, Ooo-rah!, there is even some classic deadpan Marine humor. As mentioned, it's a great western cloaked as a sci-fi flick.

This is the 3-disc DVD Set featuring three different versions of the movie, with the movie broken down into two parts and on two discs. Bonus footage includes more scenes of Jake Sully pre-Pandora, Dr. Grace Augustine recounting to Jake what happened to Neytiri's sister at Augustine's school, and one final scene with Tsu'tey as he passes the mantle of leadership on to Jake.

now as for the movie, this 3 disk set has 3 versions of the film with all the bells and whistles. its worth it if you like the movie and its cool to see the differences. yes it sucks that theres a go to disk 2 to finish the movie but what do you expect, this movie has alot of detail and takes alot of room, and by keeping it to 3 disks instead of 4 makes it cheaper for us. you can see for other reviews the differences in the movies. don't let those one star reviews influence you if you like the movie. if you already bought the 1st version, then sell it to a used dvd store this version is much better, and if you want the 3d then wait a couple of months but really is it worth the extra money for 3d fad?",1290124800,4,1507,3.9572368421052633

3932716,1,B002HEXVUI,"I pre-ordered my copy of this,the three disc version of Avatar and received it promptly as usual. You all know what the set contains so I won't bore you with those unnecessary details. What you SHOULD know is what appallingly bad packaging Fox has created for this release.
When you get it and unwrap it you first have to remove the covering sleeve which encompasses the area the discs sit in. This can be tricky and in fact I had to turn the set on its side and shake it to get the enclosure out. Once out it folds out like a thick book revealing a fancy and neat looking area which are marked by three different black ends. These ends are what you pull out to get at each disc,which only go out far enough to reveal about 3/4 of the particular disc you are after. If you are familiar with the three disc set of ""Wall-E""(see my review on that) these ""hide and seek"" sleeves are similar to those. The big difference is that the ""Wall-E"" set discs sit in a slight depression. The Avatar discs sit as is,flat on the pull out;no protection and the odds for future scuffing and/or accidental falling out when trying to replace them are very,very high indeed.
As soon as I saw this I said out loud ""These are going to be scratched"" and of course I found scuff marks and scratches on the first two discs. The third was the only one in good condition but I obviously didn't shell out the bucks for one disc,so I unfortunately had to return the entire set. I don't intend to flog this dead horse repeatedly so I have asked for a refund.
It is a fancy schmansy looking set to be sure,but like the myriad of other such DVD sets out there that suck the consumer in strictly by their packaging(such as the complete I Love Lucy,The Flintstones,et al),the looks quickly lose their sweetness when the rubber hits the road and marked discs turn out to be the norm instead of the exception. Not one ounce of practicality are in sets like this. This Avatar set falls into that unfortunate category and I am giving it the wide PASS it deserves.
With this information at your disposal I hope each and everyone of you will carefully check your discs for any tell tale marks. If you order it I wish you the best of luck.
I know this will not be the last Avatar release Fox will churn out. One can only hope that the next one will be more like like Fox's original Alien Quadrilogy set which was telescoping but with separate plastic holders or better yet in individual snap cases or slim packs.

Instead of putting each version of the movie on separate disks, the first part of all the versions is on disk one, and the second part of all the versions is on disk two. So, in the middle of this wonderful experience, the mood is broken by having to stop to put in disk two. Who wants to bother with that? Hello? Were DVD's invented yesterday at Fox?

In addition, the packaging is some convoluted paper 'dvd drawer' type deal that makes it almost impossible to remove the dvds without putting your fingers on the recorded surface. There has to be at least a million better ideas for unique packaging.

3932718,5,B002HEXVUI,"This comes as a buyer beware note.  I ordered and then sent back the first release of the Avatar, because there was nothing new to be seen.  No special features, nothing...

This box is fully packed; disk 1 comes with 3 versions of the film. (the extra scenes add little but time, but are nice).  The second disk is full of deleted scenes, virtually an entire movie's worth.  I think over a hour of them.  Worth watching to see the editing decisions made to trim the movie.  The second and third disks also contain a lot of making of stuff.  Fun to watch if your into that stuff like I am.

Package is good too. Sort of a book format, with sleeves the hold the disks.  Weirdly the index is not on a page, but on a insert. So you have to keep the loose sheet to know whats on the disks.

A good buy, but now I have to look carefully at what I order and wait till a copy of the film I actually want comes out and not get suckered again.

I figured this was the blu-ray release to get. First off, the 1st disc has 3 versions of the movie. The Theator Version, The Special Edition Re-Release and the new Collectors Edition. You can pick which one you want to watch very easily. There is also an option to only watch the scenes that where added. Very Nice! There is also an audio option for a ""Family Friendly"" version that cuts out any bad language. Now on to the quality...What can I say, its the best looking blu-ray I have ever seen!! The picture is perfect. No Complaints there. I had no compatibility issues at all. My blu-ray was up-to-date and had no issues.

Now on to Disc 2 and 3.. There first thing you will want to do is to watch the special features. There are fantastic. Alot of these are even better than the footage they added to the collectors edition. There is well over an hour of just deleted scences!! However, they are NOT broadcast in 1:78:1, but in 2:35:1.. that kinda sucked..As to the Documentaries, they are very informative and you get the full details of just about everything.

Now on to my complaints..The time it takes to load the disc and the time it takes to navigate back and forth to the menus is very annoying...Be forwarned if you are use to the speed of DVDs, get over it, blu-rays take longer...If you stop the blu-ray and turn it back on later it takes FOREVER to get back to where you where.

3932725,4,B002HEXVUI,"People, ignore 99% of the one-star reviews. Many of them were posted weeks before this package was even released! A bunch of people who trashed the movie on the other Avatar movie product pages, plus many complaining about no 3-D or double dipping, as if no other movie has ever been released as a barebones then an extended release later. Plus, it has been extensively written all over the internet that the 3-D version would not be released until next year. Amazon IMO should not allow reviews of products until after they are released. Avatar sure isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it fully deserves intelligent commentary, whether one gives it one star or five. I have never seen so many uninformed haters cluster around a movie before. People are even giving the movie one star because their BD players aren't updated with current firmware. All I can say about these people is what Neytiri said to Jake upon their first encounter... ""You're like a baby. Making noise, don't know what to do"".

I loved the extras - this is one of those rare movies where the extras are as much fun as the movie itself - and wish a lot of the deleted scenes (many with unfinished CGI and some at the motion-capture level) had made it into the movie. It would have made the movie even longer, but almost 4 hours is not too long for this type of sci-fi epic, at least to me. However, the additional scenes that made it into the extended cut really added to the movie and helped clarify the plot. The Sturmbeest hunt scene was great, and lent a bit more legitimacy to the montage of Jake's improbably quick training. Another additional extended scene involving Grace and Jake really helped flesh out the backstory and also added an important element of bonding between the two characters.

Seeing the feature-length ""making of"" documentary was wonderful - it really went in-depth on just how incredibly complicated the making of this movie was. Some of the deleted scenes with unfinished CGI are a bit tough to watch - very rough and cartoonish, and it can be difficult making out which character is which sometimes - and you kind of have to fill in with your imagination the missing CGI to get a sense of how the scenes fit into the movie. For those who aren't that familiar with the movie, it helps to get quite familiar with the storyline and scene-to-scene progression before delving into the deleted scenes.

Two negatives:

1) Amazon shipped me the DVD version, not the Blu-Ray version that I ordered! There's a lot of extras on the Blu-Ray set that are not on the DVD set so I was not a happy camper when I opened the package. Plus, I've already seen the original theatrical release on Blu-Ray and the video and audio quality of the DVD version is very noticeably downgraded. I already had removed the shrink wrap from the box before I noticed it was the incorrect format so I watched it all anyway. Amazon's problem, not mine. (Edit 11/19/10: Amazon got the correct (Blu-Ray) version to me in less than a day and a half after I filed a return ticket. Good job guys.)

2) The case the set comes in, while beautiful, is not kind to the discs. In my opinion, having the discs lie against cardboard sliders is a great way to have the discs end up scuffed or scratched. As I said above, Amazon accidentally shipped me the DVD version when I had in fact ordered the Blu-Ray version, and since I didn't notice it was the DVD version until I had taken off the shrink wrap, I watched the DVD version anyway. As soon as I pulled out the discs I noticed seriously nasty scuff marks on the playing surfaces of two of the three discs (and yes, I WAS very careful). That is NOT acceptable for a freshly-manufactured product, and I had never encountered that problem before. When I received the Blu-Ray version, very luckily, there were no blemishes on any of the discs. So, I transferred them to standard Blu-Ray plastic cases for better safekeeping and now just keep the original case in a drawer. I have seen many other complaints from people here about how the cases marred their discs, so I know I'm not the only one. This is why I gave this set 4 stars, and not 5. My attitude is that when you're buying a product like a DVD/Blu Ray box set, it's not just about the movie itself, it's an overall PRODUCT review. When the package that the product is supposed to be permanently stored in causes damage to the product, then the packaging is fair game for being included in a review. You're not just buying the movie, you're also buying the case that is supposed to safeguard the disc(s). Almost everything is fair game in a review of a movie - audio, video, cinematography, editing, music, story line, continuity, acting - plus things like the extra bonus material and the case. ALL this is part of the overall product that people shell out their money for. So, I had to change my rating from 5 stars to 4. Movie 5 stars, packaging 3 stars.

Overall, if you're a fan of the movie, don't hesitate to get this extended collector's edition. And if you're one of the people who complain double dipping and refuse to buy this version and just came here to complain about double-dipping, lack of 3-D, or your BD player not having updated firmware, feel free to take your complaints elsewhere.

I LOVE the movie and the set is amazing, but since that is the definitive version to watch, it's kind of annoying.
Anyone else have this issue?  Let me know.",1290038400,2,367,4.6461538461538465

3932729,5,B002HEXVUI,"I have been waiting for this version for a LONG time. I am a huge Avatar fan and didn't get a chance to see the extended cut in the theaters. Now I can see it PLUS more with the new alternate opening...which is AMAZING! Really adds to the storyline. The only downfall is that with all those versions of the film on 1 disc...it wasn't enough...so half way through the movie you have to change the disc to continue the movie. I don't really have a problem with it...just kinda gets annoying. However, the Blu-ray version has all 3 versions of the film on one blu-ray disc...considering of course that they hold ALOT more data than regular DVDs. This is for sure a must buy for any Avatar fan...the documentary ""Capturing Avatar"" will absolutly blow your mind and amaze you with wonder about the world known as Pandora...and the film known round the world as AVATAR!",1289952000,2,863,4.538461538461538
3932730,1,B002HEXVUI,"Let me put it to you straight. 8 minutes or 16 minutes extra of garbage is still garbage! This movie had OK special effects, NOT amazing ones. I'm sure it looked cool in 3-D. But boil right down to it, it was the most simplistic piece of garbage of all-time! I can't believe how many people think it is one of the greatest movies of all-time! Has anyone seen anything by Frank Capra, Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford, Charlie Chaplin, Stanley Kubrick, Clint Eastwood, Christopher Nolan or dozens of better film makers than James Cameron? Any one of their film is miles away better in quality and watchability. Frankly the only way I could watch this film was with RiffTrax, from the MST3K guys.

Cameron spend 15 years working on this? A first grader asked to write a screenplay could come up with a better story in 5 minutes, let alone a decade and a half. How stupid do you think the movie going public is? Well, pretty dumb considering how much money it made and how many good reviews it gets. Unattainium? That's pretty simple symbolism. I get it. The metal is UNATTAINABLE! We shouldn't be materialistic. I get it! We get it also, white man always violent and destroying nature, while natives always peaceful and live in harmony with nature. Goes against all history and logic, but ok. And to boot Marines are EVIL! Again not true, but whatever. Cameron is entitled to his opinion, but he could have wrapped it into a story that was a little bit harder to decode.",1289952000,5,1463,4.562737642585551

As for the extended cut, it is incredible!  The added footage adds so much detail and background that was missing from the original version.  I could not wait to purchase it when it first came out, so I bought the bare bone version.  Then i sold it when I saw this was coming out. So glad I did because this is the version to have.

3932732,2,B002HEXVUI,"I was absolutely blown away by this movie in the theater. I love it for all it's Eye Candy. So this is commentary on this release of the Blu-Ray bot the movie itself.

But this Blu-ray release STILL reeks of the studio milking every fan for everything.
In an interview James Cameron stated he wanted this release to contain everything, thus the 3 versions of the movie and all the extra's..but it doesn't include the one thing that made the movie as big as it was..the 3D? You gotta be KIDDING me.

That means there's at LEAST 2 more releases in the future...the release that is finally the movie in 3D, and then the release that is the movie, but just the movie with no bells and whistles. And then the final 3D Avatar with all the features this release has..probably right in time for release before Avatar 2 hits theaters and then they can release a bare a bone 2 movies bundle after that.....

The writing on the wall is so obvious.
No thanks, I think I'll pass on this guy.

I was so looking forward to exercising my 3D Sony with this movie too. So disappointing.",1289952000,4,1068,4.378787878787879
3932733,5,B002HEXVUI,"There are many opinions about the extended release of Avatar. Good and bad. The bottom line, is what are you considering buying for? Is it just curiosity? Or are you looking for more of an already favorite movie? If your reason is the latter, then you will not be dissappointed.

I, for one, was excited to get the new release. I have watched the theatrical version over and over. (Yes, I am a freak that way). I wanted more Pandora. With this extended version, that's exactly what I got.

There are not JUST clips of minutes shoved in, it is more Pandora in snipits. More of planet, more of the feelings, and some background left out of the theatrical version that I think must have been really hard to cut for reasons of time. At least if I had to edit this movie, it would have been really difficult. But who am I? A fan, that's what I am.

I was concerned about it being split into 3 discs that it would feel choppy. Actually it is only split between 2 discs and it was done at an excellent point in the movie. It was a perfect bathroom break....although I know that the pause key can be used at any time, this switching of discs was okay with me.

I am not going to give you any spoilers....but....the new extended scenes give insight into some of the dialogue. Jake says he is a deadly ariel hunter...yes there is a scene for that. It is wonderful! Grace refers to the breakdown of peace between the humans and the indiginous as being about using machine guns on them. Well, that is vsually answered. There is a tidbit added to the ""bonding"" of Jake and Natiri that I wondered about and got the answer. And there is so much more.

So, for my money, this was worth the purchase. I wanted MORE Avatar. That's exactly what I was given. Oh, and it was done so very well, besides.",1289952000,4,1781,4.304477611940299
3932734,5,B002HEXVUI,"I waited for this set all year.  I have a 60"" Sony 1080P HDTV and PS3 BluRay player, but no 3D capability.  So, this was the version I have been waiting for.  I had the wisdom and patience to NOT buy the earlier versions, knowing this version would come out at some time.  I am very happy with this set.

For those of you that bought the DVD version and found that the movie is split over two disc, realize there is only so much capacity on the DVD format.  With this being a 3 hour move with multiple versions and awesome video/sound quality, it was necessary to use two discs for the DVD version.

Know that the BluRay version does not have to make this sacrifice and all three versions of Avatar are on 1 disc.  BluRay has much more storage capacity than DVD.  So, there is your reason to upgrade to BluRay!",1289952000,3,810,4.207792207792208

A lot of people on here are complaining and whining about the fact that they've already purchased the original version and don't want to shell out more money. The simple fact is that we all knew that the original release was a bare bones version released to coincide with Earth Day. I skipped the original release and patiently waiting for the extended edition release. It's a definite buy for those who did not purchase the Earth Day version. Is it worth purchasing again if you did buy the original? That's up for you to decide. I was really interested in seeing how James Camermon brought the world of Pandora to life. Also, the deleted and extended scenes are really cool, with lots of new creatures and a new beginning to the film with Jake Sully on earth. I really enjoyed it, but if you are one the many that already bought the original version, buy it if you're a big fan, wait until next years black friday to get it dirt cheap.",1289952000,2,1024,4.452127659574468

Everyone whining about the lack of special features. Now you get three versions of this movie and full of special features...guess what? We are still not satisfied? What is up with you people? The three hour extended version is alone worth the double-dipping! Loved the new beginning on Earth (really gives us an insight to the attitude of our lead character) and all the other added scenes. Cannot wait to triple dip when the 3D version comes out, so I will have a reason to get a 3D TV! This week alone, several titles came out in 3D with 2D blu-rays included. I have already started my collection. It is a smart move for studios to release the two versions together instead of having us to re-buy the movie (which most aren't worth it...only Avatar's worth that) to get the newer format.
This three disc set of Avatar is a materpiece of a blu ray! It is sad to read all the people still holding onto DVD. DVD is a dying format people...blu ray is awesome when done right! There is so much detail you are missing on DVD. Let this Avatar box be a reason to jump on the blu-ray bandwagon, because movies like Avatar were meant for blu-ray!

If the cost in the theaters wasn't prohibitive enough.
How many versions of the same DVD can you release trying to milk as much money out of unwary consumers as you can.

I'm sure next spring their will be a grand Re-Release with all new features ""Never Seen Before"" in 3d.

Be like me and send a notice to the film companies.  (Not interested)
I'll wait until a full version comes out with all I want.
Until then Nada.

As to the movie itself.
The special effects were FANTASTIC in full 3-d in the theater.
It truly looked like a completely different world.
It was the only selling point to this movie.
I had one friend who saw it several times because it ""looked so pretty"".
The story line was pretty basic and had no new ideas. It only repeated what we've seen in our own history.

3932739,5,B002HEXVUI,"GROW UP!! Don't rate the movie one star just because you lack the self-control to wait for the release that you really want. Pretty much all film makers do this stuff. On a film like Avatar, which cost SO much to make, they have to pull these marketing ploys to make their money back and earn a profit. Keep in mind that these profits go to help fund other movies sometimes! Film companies put out dozens of movies, most of them flop or barely make their money back-- when they get a hit they have to cash in. It's just reality.

Anyway, back to the main point of a review. The movie is awesome. Buy it! That is, unless you want the 3D version, in which case you should exercise some self control and wait for the next release. Most people don't have 3d tvs and aren't going to get one probably for years, so this version is just fine for most.",1289952000,9,844,4.209876543209877

The movie was made in 3D. I think a 'collectors edition' should include it regardless of the current number of 3D TV sets.  Regardless if you own a 3D TV or not. That's why I dropped it 1 star.  I think if the next 'edition' includes it this one may not be needed.",1289952000,,572,4.212962962962963

Now they have released a longer extended cut of the film with 16 extra minutes, that are worth it. Some do not think that the extra footage would warrant buying it after buying the bare bones edition, well I bought the bare bones and I traded it in to buy this, It is worth buying this but not just because of the 16 extra minutes but the hours of bonus features, they are actually very immersive and worth watching, 45 minutes of Deleted Scenes and I whish the deleted scenes were finished in editing because I found the deleted scenes to further the story more than the additional footage, anyways the movie was amazing and its still amazing and its made even more amazing with this extended footage.

3932744,5,B002HEXVUI,"First off I'll address the people complaining about the absence of a 3-D version. Panasonic currently has an exclusive right to the 3-D version of 'Avatar' till February 2012. Cameron has stated that the standalone 3-D release is still one to two years out. The market simply isn't saturated enough with 3DTV's to justify at this time, and from a business standpoint this is actually smart. Early adopters of 3D technology shouldn't be surprised here, its nothing new to the electronics industry. In time it will happen, that goes for other films as well.

The film is once again presented in its natively shot 1.78:1 ratio. Cameron has admitted to falling in love with the 16:9 version, and stated that he does not ever plan to release the 2.35:1 crop of it for home-release. Why anyone want to chop off the original frame on the top and bottom, then blow it up, is beyond me. I see a lot a comments about this and wanted to help clear that up as well.

This movie has been cited as revolutionary to cinema for its technical breakthroughs. Some criticism has been placed on its story seeming too familiar but I think that is kinda what made it work. The new technology had a good old-fashioned story-arc to carry it, while at the same time giving us an entirely new universe and setting, and being one that could be accepted cross-culturally. This film broke box-office records in just about every country in the world, it was a gamble that paid off. Its now the top-selling Blu-ray of all time as well, so obviously the 3-D was a bonus, yet not so much a requirement to enjoy it. Its a great science-fiction film with traditional elements to drive it, exploration, a love-story, and Cameron's trademark action sequence directing. The third-act really shines in the aspect of the latter. That is my opinion for what its worth, nothing more, nothing less.

This release gives you the film as originally cut and by utilizing seamless-branching, you can watch two more extended versions of it. After watching it now, I feel the extended version gives the viewer much more background on Jake's story-arc, the conflict between the Na'vi and the humans, and the character of Grace as well. I was very impressed with it. The Blu-ray video and audio transfer still shines as reference quality. Basically this is the movie where you can really push the potential of your home-theater. Clean, no artifacts, and very sharp. The added scenes also look clean, and just as crisp as the original scenes. WETA really did a great job on them considering they were just for a limited special-edition theatrical release.

Audio is prefect. Excellent DTS-HD master audio and it could pass for the original studio-master. Clean, clear, and powerful when it needs to be. I never touched my system while leaving it at my usual volume and found it very comfortable throughout.

I do not even know where to begin to talk about all of the special-features presented on this disc set. There is a mountain of them to go through, though as of this writing I still haven't been through them all, but I would have to say that a person who watches all of them could walk away knowing almost as much as Cameron does about the making of this film. Every aspect of the film's production is covered. You also get on the fly comparisons of the various stages of motion-capture, pre-render, and final-render..all at the push of a button real-time. This is great for someone who likes to see instantly how the scene evolved into the final product that we saw on the screen. Almost an hour of deleted scenes are there too, each one of them are unique and can provide insight on various scenes throughout the film. There were actually a few scenes which I pondered being cut to begin with, but I know they were trying to keep the pacing right. Documentaries, the original script and scriptment, the theatrical trailers, an extensive production artwork montage, exclusive BD-Live features, etc. The list just keeps going...fans of the film will love it all I'm sure. Disc 3 of the Blu-ray version has almost all of the CGI parts of the movie with the motion-capture footage picture in picture for viewing as a comparison. I really loved this, it even had the love-scene on it.

Fox and Cameron both stated to the press before the first home release that this collector's version was coming in November. Your option to double-dip was on the table then and there. This release is the definitive version for fans of the film. I would even recommend it to non-fans because of the extended scenes and how they, in my opinion, improve upon the story in a subtle way.

Overall, this film and this release, receives no less than 5-stars from me. Like any other blockbuster, it has had its share of praise and cultural-backlash, but I feel its an epic popcorn flick worthy of anyone's collection.",1289865600,28,4846,4.714285714285714
3932745,2,B002HEXVUI,"*** Be advised, Abrahamic themes discussed here ***

Technicals aside, Avatar appears to be Cameron's take on how the biblical Book of Joshua might play out allegorically but reversed and depicted as science fiction. Imagine a fantasy where the alien, ""pagan"" enemies of some futuristic, space-faring ""Israel"" instead have the righteousness and might of the ""true"" deity on their side. In his cinematic brilliance, Cameron shows just how this futuristic, figurative ""Israel"" is brought to its knees by its would-be alien (figurative biblical pagan) targets. The humans are snarkily depicted as claiming the superior means and values, yet in this fantasy they are THE god-forsaken, rapacious foreigners - in the eyes of the pagans.

The blue Na'vi in the movie appear to represent a fantastic version of the ancient, partly-human Anakite giants (Anakite: long-neck) of the biblical land of Canaan, metaphorically represented here by Pandora. Since the movie is from the human traitor Jake Sully's (alternate biblical Caleb) and his alien allies' POV (Sully: ""Excuse me, this is my video log here!""), there is of course no attribution to any kind of divine hand behind this metaphorical Israelite army. OTOH, it is a force which does possess a thematic proxy for the power of the human (biblical Israel's) deity, in the form of unimaginable - in the eyes of the pagans - advantages in armaments, high technology, and organization. Not coincidentally, the human (biblical Israeli) army is depicted transiting the wilderness of space from a blighted Earth (biblical Egypt) while subsisting on in-flight rations (biblical manna), bent on an overarching mission to seek their nation's survival and prosperity by winning the rights to the promised rock (biblical land) of Pandora (biblical Canaan). The idea of ""Israel"" as the divinely favored people is figured in the movie as a powerful human civilization aspiring to ""Unobtanium"", a ""Rock"" no less, which in the end proves to be unobtainable due to alien enemy action. Which is precisely Cameron's point, and likely motivation.

After being forced to take a swim (biblical Jordan) by the nasty wildlife (biblical ""land swallows up people and things""), ex-Marine (Israelite warrior) Jake meets Na'vi princess Neytiri, a figurative stand-in for the ravishingly beautiful biblical Rahab. In this tale, Rahab's biblical character as fearful prostitute is uplifted into a stalwart and loyal Na'vi (biblical Canaanite) princess. Rahab's biblical role as the Israeli sympathizer who hid the two Israeli spies scouting Jericho is smartly reversed into that of a die-hard noble pagan defender and seducer. This version of Rahab also plays a secondary role as that infamous Moabite princess who carried out the orders of biblical Canaanite king Balak (paralleling the biblical advice of the pagan sorcerer Balaam not to confront Israel indirectly) to seduce an enemy Israeli warrior into betraying his own nation. Instead of getting speared in the act with said enemy (biblical Phinehas/Zimri incident) as in the original story, this revised Rahab-cum-sex-princess does get to turn the tables by spearing the enemy Colonel, who appears to stand for biblical Joshua due to his age and character (Yes, yes, I know that the original production code-name for the Jake Sully character is ""Joshua""). The Neytiri (biblical Rahab) character ends up as a fantastic re-imagining of the ancient pagan war-goddess Neith/Anat - she of nakedly aggressive beauty and skill with bow and arrow. A sneaky reversal of an Old Testament story marvelously retold from the Canaanite point of view.

Among other things, Pandora/Canaan's magical floating mountains are metaphors for those ancient mountaintops from where biblical King Balak and Sorcerer Balaam tried to hex their Israelite enemies. It's a bit of a thematic stretch, but these can also represent the high places where Israelis would not only practice worship, but more importantly also seal holy covenants, or marriages between entities. On the other hand, the offsite Avatar link couch assigned to Sully is revealingly named ""Beulah"" (Dr. Augustine: ""You'll be in the link at the end. Unit one. Beulah...""), which means ""Israel"" and/or ""married"" in Hebrew. Hebrew prophets were always warning Israelites against marrying irredeemable aliens. The prophets particularly condemned syncretic corruption involving divinity marriages between the Hebrew God YHWH and pagan goddesses such as Asherah, whose domain was trees and was symbolized by the presence of wooden poles, carved wooden figures, and trees. Of which stuff the figurative pagans have more than a little of. So in this reversal, an ""Israelite"" turns against his nation and people when he marries into a rival enemy ""alien religion"". Cameron must have been chortling as he thought this one up.

The age of the elder chief scientist Dr. Augustine and and her expertise in botany marks her character as figurative of the first failed biblical spy team which was tasked by Moses to scout biblical Canaan's agriculture. Sully is buddied in a paired spy-team just as in the original story. We have a fantastical re-creation of the biblical Canaanite mother goddess Asherah, associated with the living tree of fertility and child-sacrifice rites and enemy-god to the biblical Israelites. Not to mention sex in the pagan commons under a tree - are no private quarters available to the aliens? The merging-of-braids-and-minds depicted in the Collector's edition follows the sex-religion aspects of the ancient Asherah pagan cult, which saw public sexual union in the grove as more of a spiritual rather than physical consumnation. And like the biblical OT pagans, these fantasy aliens do practice sexual rites at those high sacred places. It was predictable, and predicted.

Other reverses/parallels abound. The treasonous human science team almost directly parallels the ten faithless spies of biblical Moses's 12-man spy team, of whom only biblical Joshua (figured as an older Joshua by RDA Colonel Quaritch here) and Caleb proved strong and faithful (Colonel Quaritch to initially-zealous Sully: ""I wish I had ten more like you""). Then there are the 12 RDA sectors which figuratively correspond to the biblical distribution of land among ancient Israel's twelve tribes. And there's marine (biblical Israelite) warrior Jake Sully as a traitorous refiguring of the biblical Caleb, except that Caleb's character is recast in the form a traitorous brother. It is yet another OT parallel from Deuteronomy, for the enemies of biblical Israel are sometimes described as ""undercut"" with crippled legs. Jake Sully's role as crippled traitor-to-be is strongly predictive of this, for in this reversed parallel fantasy, he gets to meet pagan Princess Neytiri (biblical Rahab) at Hometree (biblical Jericho), which eventually falls to the circling human army (biblical Walls and Trumpets assault).

In other details, alien wildlife are seen communicating with the indigenes (Balaam's biblically hilarious donkey). And oh, up there during the climactic battle is a naked and feathered Jake Sully with a crown of thorns sailing the sky on the back of a serpent-tailed red dragonbeast, holding at times a serpentine twist of hair-fiber and looking for all the world like your typical illustration of the biblical Canaanite gods Astaroth/Ashtoreth. Neopagans everywhere, rejoice!

As for the biblical Ark which brought down Jericho's walls on the seventh run after circling the city 6 times, figuratively substitute Shuttle 1-6 and its humongous daisycutter bomb as proxy for the presence and power of the biblical Hebrew deity (biblical YHWH-on-the-Ark). Watch as Cameron delightfully orchestrates the onscreen failure of the daisycutter/Ark to deliver the final providential blow, while the supposedly unaligned Eywa-mother-earth (Neytiri: ""Our Great Mother does not take sides Jake"") finally does the Abrahamic God Divine Intervention routine. It's pagan catnip, I tell you.

Cameron's counter-biblical SF fable even has some mocking humor. Go over the movie segment where high executive Parker (biblical high priest Eleazar) is looking down at imagery of Pandoran (biblical Canaan) sector 12 on the holotable. Yes, that's Twelve, which is metaphorical for the OT tribe of Benjamin from which the future hebrew messiah would descend. Parker then revealingly/mockingly comments, ""Stop... Where .. Stop. Jesus... ...I mean, look at all that cheddar..."" (Google hint: Cheesus). Marvelously allegorical mocking word-play! For the many post-modern/ post-Western/ post-Christian/ cryptomystics out there this is as good as it gets.

Avatar is full of parallels and strong metaphors, some not obvious yet others blindingly so given the narrative order and context. How to explain all that Cameron wrought, and why? Well, we know that Cameron has this thing about disputing biblical stories. We also know what he did say about his 2006 biblical-sort-of documentary The Exodus Decoded: ""...Exodus is a story we all know. We were all raised with a biblical view of the world, which still has a resounding influence on Western culture..."" ""...Here, we've found evidence that may set the Exodus clock back 200 years. We can shove this film in the experts' faces and start a dialogue. History is often told by the victors. It is edited by subsequent rulers, who chisel away at it to show themselves in a better light. History is a moving target, and we should not be afraid to be provocative about it..."" Tellingly, this contentious Discovery Channel whodunnit was his last major project prior to Avatar.

If today's neopagans could somehow revise the original OT story into a fantastical triumph for those old Canaanites in place of their historical defeat and conquest by the biblical Israelites, this movie is their gift.

3932747,5,B002HEXVUI,"Thanks to Amazon's awesomeness, I received this set a day early and even though I haven't gone through the entire set 100 per cent it is easily the most comprehensive and complete version of the film (pray there isn't another box set :P)

I never saw the rerelease in theaters so diving into the collector's edition cut of the film was damn close to a new movie. The added scenes really fleshed out both the Na'vi and the humans' clash over minerals and nicely rounded out the characters. There are several alternate scenes in the collector's cut detailed in other reviews so I won't recycle the same info.

Audio and video are top-notch. The DTS-HD Master Audio will slay your setup with a very active soundstage. The included Family Audio track is pretty hilarious to listen to as well :) The vivid colors really POP on the screen and the crispness of the textures bring out minute details only Blu ray can provide. This is reference material, folks.

The packaging is killer: a sturdy cardboard sleeve houses the discs in a binded book-like case. The discs are housed in little ""drawers"" that slide out on the ""pages"" almost like a pop-out book. Very nice.

Overall, the added scenes round out an amazing movie and the added bonus content looks very thorough. At $25 (prerelease), a MUST OWN set! Even if you bought the earlier theatrical disc this is a behemoth for the hardcore fans, practically a godsend.",1289779200,9,1411,4.700404858299595
3932748,5,B002HEXVUI,"This is about the original movie and DVD only, not the 3-disc version being released tomorrow. I'm biased because I loved Avatar and saw it five times in the theaters. The 3D was excellent and enjoyable. By far the #1 complaint was that the special effects were incredible but the plot was boring and unoriginal. The FX are of course amazing but I liked the story as well - ""Romeo and Juliet"" set in outer space. Also, Mr. Cameron deserves a little more credit here than what he's been getting. This is an incomplete list and it'd take someone better informed than me to complete it, but here are some of the influences that I spotted: Sir James Frazier, Joseph Campbell, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Frank Frazetta, the Bible (love those Christ-figures), the aforementioned Shakespeare, Joseph Conrad, the Ramayana, Plains Indians, Amazon rain forest Indians, Gaia, T.H. Lawrence, the Masai, Vietnam, the Middle East and that's all I can think of right now. My point is that more thought went into the script than people seem to realize. It is of course very derivative, but there aren't too many totally unique plots out there (show me a few, please). At least Mr. Cameron used high-quality sources for his concept.

Another complaint was Mr. Cameron's politics. I'm not a liberal or a leftist and I wasn't inconvenienced by any attempts to brainwash me into anti-American, anti-military, anti-consumerism, anti-business, anti-capitalism, anti-imperialism or anti-anything viewpoints. I just appreciated the movie and enjoyed the ride. I figured that Mr. Cameron needed despicable villains and henchmen as well as noble heroes and heroines, which is what any epic requires. Because the main evil-doer and his mercenaries and the corporate execs were American, some people got very offended. I just looked at them as handy, all-purpose scoundrels; not as representatives of something I was supposed to hate forevermore. Don't forget, the hero (and Christ-figure) was an ex-Marine. Didn't that balance things out for you? I don't know or care about James Cameron's personal philosophies, I just believe he intended to create an entertaining, enjoyable, enthralling movie and that he succeeded admirably. Anybody who only sees art produced by people who share the same outlook is missing out on a lot of what the world has to offer. You don't have to be converted in order to appreciate someone else's vision.

There has to be a final note about the incredible FX. The visuals were undeniably spectacular and even people who hated the movie itself all agreed on that. A lot of diligence and work and thought and effort went into Avatar and it clearly shows. Mr. Cameron and his actors and crew and staff were obviously deeply committed to their vision and it showed in every scene. My only complaint was the soundtrack. A flick like this deserved a score on the same level as ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" or ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" or ""The Last of the Mohicans"" or ""The Magnificent Seven"" (it was, after all, an exciting cowboy movie placed in outer space). It richly deserved a stirring and emotional soundtrack but instead there was mostly innocuous elevator music throughout. I love Leona Lewis but putting her song over the end credits wasted it, IMHO. It would've fit in better during the movie itself, also IMHO.

Anyway, I highly recommend Avatar. Hard to imagine a more enjoyable film.",1289779200,4,3396,4.954385964912281

3932751,4,B002HEXVUI,"First off, yes, we have the discs in hand early so this review is based on hands-on experience, not on speculation nor on a general dissatisfaction with studios who feel compelled to ""double dip"" on major titles like this.  I'm as averse to double dips as the next guy and have frequently called out studios who put out multiple releases of a movie in order to squeeze every last drop out of the fans.  But there are a few reasons why this particular double dip may be worthy of your high def dollars.

The extended versions of the film (as with Cameron's other SciFi epics, ""The Abyss"" and ""Aliens"" before it) really enhance one's enjoyment of the film.  If you like being immersed in Pandora, these extra sixteen minutes dealing with such sub-plots as the failed school project (only hinted at in the theatrical version) give you a little more time in this beautiful world and lend further depth to the characters.  The extra scenes better illustrate the efforts that some humans have put into trying to understand and respect the beliefs and wishes of the Na'vi - maybe even enrich their lives through broadened horizons.  This brings further contrast to the insensitive company men (and women) who are just trying to figure out how to get the Na'vi out of the way so they can exploit the planet's natural resources.  These extra scenes took so long and so much computing resources to render and complete that they simply were not ready in time for the earlier Blu-ray release.  The extra scenes are incorporated into the film cleanly using Blu-ray's seamless branching feature.  You choose which version to watch and it runs through the theatrical, extended or collector's edition cuts.  Or you can also choose to just jump to the new and expanded bits if you'd prefer.

We did notice some mild differences in the noise level and black level reproduction in the newest scenes (the scenes added for the Collector's Edition cut).  There was nothing to draw major attention to the new material but you may spot subtle quality differences in the new scenes if watching closely.  Overall, it is still a stunning transfer, even blown up on a 100-inch projection screen, with rich details and nicely saturated colors.  Pandora is a colorful world and Blu-ray is the only way to watch it.  The sound is as impressive as the audio, with a DTS-HD Master Audio track that captures the organic environmental sounds of Pandora, the dialog (Na'vi and human), as well as the massive explosions and percussive attack of mortar fire and automatic weapons.  New scenes such as a shot of the abandoned school, blend transparently with old as far as the audio is concerned with a stable and immersive soundscape throughout.

Also, a new ""family-friendly"" soundtrack is offered which omits the fairly plentiful profanity from the mix.  This is offered for the theatrical and extended cuts only (not the Collector's Edition cut). Although I've never been a fan of censorship, I do like knowing that I can play this for my young son without fear of exposing him to excessively ""colorful"" language.  Plus the track was created in cooperation with the director, so we know it doesn't stray too far from his vision.  Unfortunately, probably due to space considerations, this track is plain old lossy Dolby Digital 5.1, but after watching it with the family, I can say that much of the quality and dynamics of the lossless mix are carried over here.

In the extras department, this set is unlikely to disappoint the fans and those who are simply curious as to how some of the more impressive aspects of the film (like the performance captures of human actors playing Na'vi) were accomplished.  Other than the omission of any kind of running commentary track during the film (which would have been nice), you'll find just about everything you could hope for on the making of the film, including even *MORE* deleted and extended scenes that were left out for pacing or logistical reasons.  The 28 deleted scenes are on disc two, combining over 45 minutes of new footage with enough transitional scenes to total up to just over 68 minutes running time. Continuing on discs two and three, you'll find various behind the scenes and Making Of segments, screen tests and initial performance capture proof of concept segments, scene deconstructions, art galleries and much more.  If you're curious about Pandora or what it takes to pull off a film like this, you'll enjoy poring over these details.

There is, of course, one major omission from this release: it's still not 3D (hence 4 stars, instead of 5).  And as much as I wish it were 3D, I can understand why Fox is not putting out a general release Blu-ray 3D version of the film at this time.  The market of 3D TV owners simply isn't large enough for ths studio to invest in a separate Blu-ray 3D release at this time.  Although sales would probably be impressive, the 3D version of the film would be playable by relatively few viewers.  Instead of not releasing a Blu-ray 3D version at all, Fox has partnered with Panasonic to offer a basic Blu-ray 3D version of the film (theatrical cut only) as an exclusive promotion for buyers of Panasonic 3D TVs (past and present).  This arrangement allows Panasonic to bring the 3D version of the film to consumers, while also giving Fox the ""financial security"" to know that they can be profitable with the 3D Disc.  This arrangement also gives consumers a major incentive to choose a Panasonic 3D TV.  But it leaves buyers of other brands' 3D TVs out in the cold, and frankly, that part sucks.  It means these consumers will need to turn to eBay or other secondary markets in order to obtain a 3D version of the film.  From our discussions with the studio and manufacturer, we believe this will be a one year exclusivity window.  Cameron and Fox have stated (at Blu-Con in Beverly Hills earlier this month), that this Collector's Edition of the film will be the ""final word"" on the film, as far as 2D is concerned, and a general retail version of the film on Blu-ray 3D will follow, but not for at least a year.

So, is it ideal that we don't have a 3D version of the biggest 3D movie of all time available to general consumers?  No.  But for the vast majority of Blu-ray and HDTV owners, who are not yet 3D-enabled, this Collector's Edition of the film offers a major improvement over the earlier single-disc edition and earns our recommendation.

3932752,2,B002HEXVUI,"Like I say in the title, this is a review of the Avatar Blu-ray, not the movie itself, as nearly everyone has seen this movie in theaters.

The GOOD- video quality here is AMAZING!  This is the best looking Blu-ray I have ever seen.  Nothing can compare to it, not Toy Story 3, the matrix trilogy, the dark knight, etc.  This is the best looking Blu-ray I think ever made.  Inside the case, it has a coupon that says ""this movie Blu-ray was made for avatar.""  They are not kidding the picture quality is easily the best ever. The audio is spectacular as well and is a true showcase of what Blu-ray has to offer.

The BAD- this is a barebones release, literally, no extra anything.  You can download some low quality extras if you use BD Live.  This is ridiculous and I don't know why they tried to make money off of this barebones release.  20th Century Fox should be ashamed of themselves for releasing something null of extras.  Seriously, nobody purchases a movie that is devoid of extra content, you might as well downlo...I mean acquire the movie by other means if you that is all you want.  If I did not receive this BD as a gift I would be highly upset.

and The UGLY- um...there is nothing about ugly about the quality of this astounding 1080p transfer.  However I must point out that this is really a shameless attempt to make money off people who couldn't wait to (yeah I'm going to say it) whom couldn't wait to return to Pandora.

Also, I for one DO appreciate the different versions. I would not have wanted to wait until November to watch Avatar as much as I wanted. As a Mass Communications Major, I know how long it takes to do even the simplest amount of editing so I know these guys were working at top speed in order to get this extended version ready even this early.

You guys are screaming about James Cameron and his team milking the system, so if it bothers you so much, then by God DON'T buy it! And don't comment with complaints!

3932758,5,B002HEXVUI,"I'm primarily interested in the storyline differences between special sets and their theatrical counterparts, so here are the differences between the two (NOTE: SPOILERS FOLLOW).

The extended collector's edition runs 16 minutes 28 seconds longer than the theatrical cut, and listed below are the major differences.

1)  The opening scene is different, and starts with Jake in a wheelchair on Earth, in a Blade Runner-esque Earth city.  The scene moves to scenes of Jake in his apartment, then taking liquid shots in a bar.  Jake's narration of ""I told myself I can pass any test a man can pass"" and ""They can fix the spinal if you got the money. But not on vet benefits, not in this economy"" are inserted during this new opening scene.

Jake beats up a bar patron who is mistreating a woman, and then Jake and wheelchair are unceremoniously thrown outside by bouncers into an alley.  While in the alley, Jake meets the two RDA representatives who bring him news of his brother's untimely death.  Then the movie cuts back to the original theatrical cut where Jake sees his brother's body cremated, then awakes in space.

2)  During Jake's initial flyover of Pandora in his avatar, they witness a herd of Sturmbeasts, buffalo-like creatures.

3)  After seeing the Sturmbeasts, Grace, Jake, and Norm stop by Grace's old English school for the Na'vi.  The school is now closed, abandoned, and some walls are riddled with bullet-holes.  Norm finds a Dr. Seuss book, ""The Lorax"", on the ground.  This scene explains how Neytiri knew English so well, and certainly gives some further backstory into Grace Augustine's character.

Interestingly, The Lorax can be seen as a metaphor for the Pandoran story.  Recall that the seemingly simple Seussian book is actually a lesson on the plight of the environment and industrialization.

4)  We see some other different Pandoran flora and fauna, particularly with scenes of the luminescent forest floor.

5)  Jake's first dinner with Neytiri is longer and extended, and it's here that she tells him her full name.

6)  When Jake, Grace, and Norm first visit the Hallelujah Mountains on the way to the remote uplink station, Grace explains (in a Jake voiceover) that the mountains are levitated [via the Meissner Effect], because Unobtanium is a superconductor.  There's a pretty spectacular CGI shot as the characters look around in awe at the suspended mountains.

7)  Pictures of Grace and Na'vi children at her previously functioning school.  Dr. Augustine tells Jake that she previously taught Neytiri and her sister, Sylwanin.  However, one day, Sylwanin and some hunters destroyed an RDA bulldozer, and RDA SecOps troopers killed them at the school, which explains why the school walls were previously seen pockmarked with bullet holes.

8)  Sturmbeast hunting scene after Jake tames a Banshee.  After Jake successfully kills a Sturmbeast with an arrow, he and Neytiri chortle a ""Heck yeah!"" and whoop.

9)  Jake and Neytiri's love scene comprises them linking braids together.  Some kissing, nothing explicit.

10)  Tsu'tey leads a war party that destroys the RDA's autonomous bulldozers, as well as the RDA SecOps squad that was guarding them.  Corporal Wainfleet leads the search party that uncovers the evidence, via real-time helmet cam footage.  Not sure why they cut this scene from the theatrical cut, as it persuades Selfridge to attack the Home Tree.

11)  Attack of Hammerhead Titanotheres on RDA forces has been extended slightly; additional scenes of AMP-Suits getting destroyed.

12)  Fight between Colonel Quaritch in AMP Suit and Neytiri on Thanator slightly longer.

13)  Tsu'tey's death scene; in the theatrical cut, he falls off the RDA shuttle's aft ramp to his death.  In the Collector's Edition, he falls to the forest floor, mortally wounded.  He passes on leadership to Jake, and asks Jake to ceremonially kill him e.g. hara-kiri, so that Jake will be the last shadow that Tsu-Tey sees.  Jake does so.

I preferred the original Tsu'tey death scene, which was more dramatic.  Jake, had afterall, already become the de facto clan leader by that point in the movie, so further formal transfer by Tsu'tey (a minor character) seemed unnecessary.",1289692800,"1,363",4206,5.078947368421052
3932759,1,B002HEXVUI,It is unfortunate that the director/writer/producer would not permit the DVD Blu-ray versions of Avatar to be distributed in letterbox or 2.35:1 or 2.40:1 format.

Having said that, I note that this version contains no 3D version and, most surprisingly, no digital version of the film (widely considered to be almost 'de rigeur' for big-SFX-budget video releases).  So unless you didn't buy the original release of the film, arguably all you are buying here are the 'extras' that SHOULD have been included in the first release.  It is difficult not to view the decision to release the movie in this way in a cynical light.

I have little interest in owning a 3D version of the movie, although I did enjoy the 3D version at the movies.  But I was very much looking forward to putting the digital version on my iPad. So I will be passing on this release. I believe that whomever is making the decisions on what to release and when will eventually go for my wallet with a digital version.

Here's a reality check. 3D TVs aren't that common yet. The major players have them available, but it's still a new technology. To put out a release in a format that's brand new, where there are still ""standards"" for how it works on hardware from different manufactures still being ironed out, would be stupid for anyone to do.

When the 3D release comes out, from what I'm reading in the trade mags, is that it will only work on one brand 3D TV set for the time being. Again, this is still brand new technology, so until ALL the manufactures of hardware and playback codecs get their act together and agree on an actual, working standard, you'll have to wait it out, or go buy a new 3D TV that will work with this release when it comes out.

If you bought the DVD version, and or the previous Bluray version, go set up an account at Ebay and sell them. Then your soul won't feel so drained that you keep buying versions of it that you really don't want to own.

Really, this is a ground breaking movie on so many levels, it's one of the few movies I've ever plunked down money to own a copy for myself for repeated viewing. And when the 3D version comes out, I won't be buying a copy.  I poked out an eyeball as a kid, so I can't see in 3D. But if I could, I'd find someone with a 3D TV and spend a weekend wearing out his bluray player.

I, for one, am more than happy with the way the re-releases are being handled.  The original Blu-ray came out extremely quickly after the theatrical release.  In order to do that, it was not 3D and it had no extras. But whether you think that is the reason or it was to make more money is immaterial. The fact of the matter is that the studio was very transparent about how they would have multiple releases of this.  No one was forced to buy the first one just as no one is being forced to buy this one.  They are simply giving the consumer more options while also maximizing their profit.  It is a win-win.  IF the studio were to do one grand release, it would be almost a year after the theatrical release and they would have to charge more for it.  Then, people who don't want extra features would not have the option of a lower priced product. They would either have to pay the high price or not get the movie at all.  What's more, Amazon is selling this for the same price as the original no frills!  So what are people complaining about?  Too many options? Some people just want something to b*tch about.  If you don't want it, don't buy it!  It's that simple!

As for the movie...there are lots of reviews out there.  I will just say I was pleasantly surprised.  Some of the more jaded and cynical will tell you the plot wasn't original enough. What they fail to understand is that most great movies meant to appeal to a wide audience deal with universal themes and so does Avatar.  It is the presentation of it that makes it unique.  If you want nuance, then go watch an indie film and discuss it over a latte with your pretentious art-house friends. If you want a great story that's beautifully shot, then watch Avatar.",1289606400,27,1843,4.354838709677419
3932766,4,B002HEXVUI,"The BOTTOM line about Avatar is that it WORKED, from a writing and visual standpoint. It's not high art from a story telling angle, but visually it's amazing. To dismiss it as anything less is utterly foolish. Being hugely popular makes it a BIG target, but that's about it. I remember the same dreary complaints when Star Wars was released and the awful reviews for Blade Runner. It's always the same with visionary material and I think there's some real jealousy involved by wannabe artists.
As far as the various versions....GET OVER IT! I have a dedicated theater in my house that cost more than a VERY nice car and then some. I have a 130 inch screen with HD projection. Until a proper 3D system for a projector is out and working well, this gibbering over 3D TV's is a laugh. I own the 3D Samsung and 3D on it is fair at best. It's just too SMALL. So for now...who cares about watching 3D on a 50"" display? It's not much fun and a strain on the eyes. You need a BIG screen in a dark room for 3D to really work well. Sorry.
So Avatar looks AMAZING in 2D and it's even more involving without the 3D process. In fact several people watching it in 2D already commented on how they see so much more detail without the 3D process. I agree and I also don't like the 1/4 to 1/2 stop light loss (reduced brightness) with ALL 3D systems. Add to that the crappy optics of the glasses and you get a very diminished viewing experience.
So....I'll order the new Avatar version.

""LET'S MILK THIS MOVIE FOR ALL WE CAN GET"" IS THE APPARENT ATTITUDE OF THE STUDIO & DIRECTOR.  THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE IN 3D & I ABSOLUTELY REFUSE TO BUY IT IN ANY OTHER MODIFIED FORM, EXTRA FOOTAGE OR NOT.  ANOTHER BEEF I HAVE IS THIS WHOLE NEW 3D BLU RAY TV & PLAYER GIMMICK!  I HAVE A HIGH DEF. WIDESCREEN TV & ANY DVDs OR BLU RAY MOVIES I'VE BOUGHT IN 3D LOOK FANTASTIC ON IT.  THERE IS NO NEED TO BUY ANOTHER TV & PLAYER WHEN THE TECHNOLOGY IS JUST FINE ALREADY (NOT TO MENTION CONSUMER AFFORDABLE).  THIS IS JUST ANOTHER EXCUSE TO MILK THE CONSUMER DRY!  I HOPE MORE PEOPLE BOYCOTT THIS GREED AND WAIT FOR THE STANDARD DVD/BLU RAY 3D EDITION (IF THERE WILL EVER BE ONE).  IN THIS ECONOMY YOU WOULD THINK THESE STUDIO HIGHER UP's WOULD HAVE A LITTLE MORE COMPASSION FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS 3D FANS.  I OWN OVER 300 BLU RAY's ALREADY,  THIS WILL NOT BE ONE OF THEM, I'LL WAIT FOR THE ORIGINAL 3D VERSION.  Further more, If the studios aren't playing Marketing games then why not release this in a 3D/2D version and let the public decide which they like better.  The least they can do is give the public the choice, i mean if they are milking this movie and making $30-$50 per collector on various versions, why not due a limited release in 3D.  It will only make more money for them as most people will Purchase it again to have it in its original format.

3932770,5,B002HEXVUI,"This movie is spectacular. I saw it twice in the theatres in 3D and it was a great experience. The world Cameron created was amazing. There are a lot of nitpickers out there and ususally their complaints are weak. As far as the story, yeah it's not a new one, but it's still a good one. It works and it played out well. As far as Cameron, don't hate the movie just because it's from him which some people seem to do. As far as the multiple releases.....well:

Do your research before complaining about this movie being released on video multiple times. It was well-known back in April when it first came out on DVD\Blu-Ray that is was a bare-bones release and that there would be a ""deluxe"" version later in the year. Even if they didn't announce this new version at the time, you had to know that one with all the features would be coming. No one forced you to buy the bare-bones release and anyone would know a newer version would be coming. So don't complain about having to buy it again. No one was duped.

This current version has some amazing special features. If you loved the movie, you have to have this. If you already bought the bare-bones version, then it's up to you to buy it again. Either way, it's not a reason to give it 1 star. This is a fabulous cinematic experience. Not perfect, but different from pretty much anything else.",1289520000,8,1345,4.397590361445783
3932771,5,B002HEXVUI,"I really don't understand why there so much backlash regarding this new version. The various versions that would be available in the future was never a secret and if you preferred to purchase the movie before all the special features were completed how is the anyone's fault but your own? All the studio did was to make a plain Jane version available for those who did not want to wait. I will say I am a little surprised that the 3D version was not released along with this version, but maybe there's more work to do on the 3D version, such as 2D to 3D conversion of extra material (the making of type stuff). Anyway, most people (myself included) do not have 3D TVs yet, so for us it's a moot point. If the various versions that would be available were kept a secret then people would have justification in being annoyed, but this was not the case.",1289520000,14,850,4.386075949367089
3932772,5,B002HEXVUI,"There are many low score reviews purely based on the fact there was a release of this movie earlier this year and now the extended version comes out feels like a marketing game. When the first release happened it was known an extended version was coming, but some people just had to have it now. I just watched it on Netflix and waited for the extended version. I agree if you bought the first release version you have little real reason to buy the extended version, unless you love this movie and want the bonus features.

Some of the other low scores talk about the 3D version coming, but that is weak reason for most people because most do not own and will not own a 3D TV set. If you do your research on 3D TVs you will find they clunky and costly. Unless you are among the few who have a 3D TV, then there is no reason to wait to buy this release of Avatar if you enjoyed the movie.

For the few who have never seen the movie, the key factors to consider is if you are a science fiction fan, enjoy action movies, and if you consider yourself picky about dialog/originality, Avatar breaks no new ground when it comes to story, but it does take many of successful elements from other stories and rolls it into this one. The bashing on acting is overkill. In general they did a fine job, not exceptional, but anyone who loves science fiction will find the acting a step above the normal for this type of movie. The dialog is nothing special. There are mostly cliche characters and situations. The key is the entire package is very well done. No movie is perfect and as much as some people bash this, just look at the box office sales. Bad movies would have never set top sales records no matter how much marketing was behind it. This movie is not for everyone, but it is good to great entertainment for many.

BOTTOM LINE: If you loved the movie and do not own it, you might want to get this. If you have never seen the movie, rent it or barrow it first. It is a science fiction classic worth consideration for most people.",1289520000,579,2025,4.281984334203655
3932773,3,B002HEXVUI,I was tempted because it seemed like this should be in my collection - but to be honest after seeing the movie twice with different friends and family I just wasn't ready to sit through it again. I'll likely purchase this when it comes out - but what I'd really like to see on Blu-Ray is the Abyss Extended Edition - I hope they take a small chunk of change and get that together.,1289520000,,380,4.148648648648648
3932774,1,B002HEXVUI,"When I saw this movie in the theater, I was blown away by the 3D visual effects. When I bought the DVD I was actually able to pay attention to the sub-par acting perpetuated by some of the most banal dialogue ever written for the screen. I'm sure by now you've all seen the ""Pocahontas""/""Avatar"" synopsis rip-off (a classic). So adding 16 more minutes is NOT going to entice me to rush into this version. Maybe Cameron should take a lesson from the Coen brothers when the re-released ""Blood Simple"" and actually make a shorter version?",1289520000,19,535,4.583333333333333
3932775,1,B002HEXVUI,"Pretty much the same as everyone elses negative reviews.  I really loved this movie but I am dead sick of this milking strategy (ala Lord of the Rings/Star Wars etc..) where they bring out a crippled version (eg flat theater version with nothing) then once all the suckers (eg the actual fans) buy that version they bring out yet another version (then the suckers race out and buy it again) then another version which the die hard suckers and people who don't care that much go out and buy it.  So who loses here... well everyone eventually..  Firstly, the customers because the biggest fans end up with the crappiest versions of the film or they are out of pocket upward of $100 bucks if they buy every version (ive been guilty of this on other movies).  Secondly the studios.  Sure they get the quick fix of multiple cash payments but eventually people learn the behavior and then go well stuff that I'll bit torrent it and buy it later.  They of course never do because once you have it, its hard to justify paying for it again when you got it for free.

Here is a suggestion why don't you bring the best version out at a premium price for a short time then bring out the crippled version later for the discount price.  That way people who pay more (and show support for the studio) get some VALUE for their bigger out lay.  People who only want the standard version can wait and get it for a cheaper price for less features at a later date.  You never know some might go out and buy the expensive version anyway.",1289433600,56,1516,4.382142857142857

3932777,5,B002HEXVUI,"I was blown away the first time I watched avatar, and of course I wanted to own the dvd.  But at the time of the original dvd release the public was informed the special features and extended version wouldn't be out until this winter.  That's why I don't understand all the griping about the second release. There are a LOT of people who didn't want to wait that long and bought the bare bones edition, but that was an informed choice, just as others chose to wait.  Now my waiting is over and I am happily looking forward to Nov16 to see the nuts and bolts on how they made this groundmaking film
I have no doubt the wait will have been well worth it",1289433600,21,651,4.192
3932778,2,B002HEXVUI,"I was actually one of the few to root for the ""Sky People"". Now I know what you're thinking; Why whould I do that? Well, you must first understand the moral of the story and the message the director James Cameron(who called Glenn Beck the Antichrist, need I say more?) is trying to send to the world by making this movie.

The moral of the story is that determination (and overwhelming numbers) can defeat technology; that was the script for the climactic battle scene at the end, and the narrative taught to every enemy our nation has ever fought since 1975. Ask the  waves of surrendering Iraqi troops how well that worked for them in 1991. For the movie as a whole, if you take away all the Sci-Fi hocus pocus, you're left with a fanciful yet not entirely acurrate re-telling of the American-Indian wars and Vietnam, with the Americans playing their usual role as the oppressor. Add in a little radical environmentalist propaganda and you have a nice little bedtime story for George Soros to tell his grandkids. In my view, the only thing that makes the movie worth watching are the great special effects and the military action.

When Avatar first came out, some critics, many of which share Mr. Cameron's far-left views, went so far as to call it the greatest motion picture of all time. I would challenge that, but it is clear that the movie was a great cinematic achievement; but then again, so was Birth of A Nation and Triumph of The Will.",1289433600,5,1448,4.583011583011583
3932779,1,B002HEXVUI,"This movie is nothing more than an ultra liberal cliche of the evil military conquering the poor indigenous lifeforms hidden behind pretty effects and imagery.
There isn't much action but more spiritual phoney balonie.

Do gooder liberals save the trees from the evil military, GIMME A BREAK.

Shame on you James Cameron, you obviously drank too much of the liberal hollywood kool aid.

I would like to see this liberal do gooder and the wimps who wrote this drivel in the fields of Bastogne, the islands of Pelileu, the beaches of Omaha and Utah, Da Nang and most recently Fallujah.

They would cringe in their pants while the REAL ACTUAL soldiers saved their useless behinds while bringing freedom to the opressed peoples in each campaign.
This cliche of the evil military is old and stale.
I purposely chose Veteran's day to write this review about this anti military detritus.
Hollywood used to make movies that honored the sacrifices they make, what happened to that?

The creature sound effects were not even original. The growls were borrowed from Jurassic Park creatures(T Rex and Raptor growls).
The pretty effects did not sell this to me. I need more than effects to like a movie. Not a shallow plot and hammed up acting.
Dancing with Smurfs has been seen before.
This is by far the most overrated movie I have ever seen(fortunately once is enough for me).",1289433600,7,1366,4.82051282051282
3932780,5,B002HEXVUI,"There appear to be two kinds of people in today's filmgoing public: those, like me, who regard AVATAR as a pinnacle of SF cinema, and those who find fault with it, and I confess to being utterly puzzled about their carping. Clunky dialogue? Well, I thought it perfectly workable and, at times, brilliant, and I've been writing my own SF and opinion re the same for several decades now. The overly familiar plot? It seemed utterly fresh and beautifully structured to me. Yes, it has historical analogues, but that is true of many, many excellent films.

I have been a devotee of SF all my life, and I'm in my seventies. Notice I do not call AVATAR ""the pinnacle,"" but one of them. To my mind the list must begin with ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (NOT THE REMAKE), and include CE3K, the 1st Star Wars trilogy, and some, though not all, of the Star Treks. But James Cameron has created a myth of enormous power wedded to stunning technology that so engaged me intellectually and emotionally that I had to remind myself on each rescreening to wear my contact lenses, because my glasses always got streaked by tears.

I sympathize with those who do not wish to purchase a 2D extended set because they expect a 3D version eventually will be issued. They are probably correct, but let me offer two observations. First, I saw AVATAR many times, and once, inadvertently, I took a friend to the 2D ""flat"" version (I didn't know it existed as such). Actually, it worked quite well; little was lost, though I would not have believed what I am saying if I had not seen it for myself. Second, 3D DVDs, in my experience, don't work all that well on TV sets. For example, ""Coraline,"" which I loved in the theatre, was a visual mess in its 3D version; better to watch it flat.

AVATAR Special Edition is a must for me; if it ever does come out in 3D, I may buy it, but I fully expect it to disappoint on home video.

As a big fan of the movie Avatar and the director JC, I really want everything of the film. That's why I feel a bit sad for their releases ""plan"" of this film.

I read quite a few of reviews/comments saying people were stupid because they did not pay attention and bought the first release in April and whine now. I don't think it's fair to call the fans stupid... Yes, I did know their plan of releases in advance as they announced before the first release. But that does not mean then they are innocent. If you do remember there were lots of criticism/complaint/mock over the internet of how greedy the studio was when they initially exposed the release plan. That's why director JC had to come out and explain.

As big fans, especially my son, just can not wait for another seven months when he saw the first Avatar release already on store shelf in April. To me, their release plan is a test of the loyalty of fans, a game to test human nature of balancing sense and sensibility. It was a painful, struggling process to decide what to do at that time. Should buy? Should wait? As a dad and a fan, what would you do?

That's why I feel sad... I was feeling sad since April since I knew the fate already. I felt a bit being ripped off. Now with another 3D version release coming in next Spring (some said this December with Panasonic 3D TV purchase), do I have to buy one more time?

3932789,4,B002HEXVUI,"Earth is dying, pillaged and despoiled by its inhabitants.  Time to find another planet to pillage and despoil.  Pandora looks like a good bet, but first we have to get rid of those pesky natives who won't take the hint and quietly disappear so we can grab everything they've got, especially since they are sitting on a mother-lode of unobtanium (get it?)  Ungrateful aliens won't even thank us for teaching them English.  Time to show them Who Is Boss.  So our military, backed up by some scientists in its pay, has hit on the genius idea of creating avatars of the native population with the purpose of first, getting to know the home folks, and then working from the inside to destroy them.

Big yawn, as far as the general premise goes; we've been there before in the 15th century when the Europeans landed on the Western Hemisphere and proceeded to decimate the native Americans, helping themselves to the natives' gold and silver in the process.  The stock characters are so stereotyped they are practically caricatures: the evil rapacious colonel, the smarmy corporation representative, the benevolent scientist, the hero who saves the day, etc. etc.  If it wasn't for the visuals, I would have fallen to sleep ten minutes into the film.  We know how it's going to end almost as soon as the movie begins.

But this film packs a visual wallop unlike anything this reviewer has ever seen before.  I was like, WHOA, NELLIE!!!  The CGI and the incredible 3-D effects make for a visual joyride that will knock you out of your seat.  As overlong as this movie is, I couldn't stop watching it.  The breathtaking special effects are so beautiful that I wanted to hop the next flight to Pandora.

I wish I could give this film five stars just for the mindblowing visual experience.  But thanks to that banal plot and the mind-numbing dialogue, I have to settle for four.

Rather than coming up with new and original stories, 3D is just another gimmick to generate revenue by charging more money. The story is the most important thing in any movie and ""Avatar"" has a ""been there, done that"" feeling that rehashes everything from ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""FernGully: The Last Rainforest"" to Cameron's own ""Aliens"" and ""The Abyss.""

3932795,5,B002HEXVUI,"I love this movie.  But potential viewers take note.  Right Wing Republicans will hate this movie with a passion.  It is more social commentary than anything else.  It is a rather stern indictment addressing our past crimes against nature and mankind.  It will make Right Wing Republicans squirm in their seats...not out of guilt, certainly, but from of being identified.  In particular it should make some of our oil companies quite uncomfortable as they are more or less continuing to this day old habits that started about 100 years ago or more.

The story line runs parallel with what white Europeans did to most of the world during the age of expansion; i.e. they whiped-out out many indigenous poeples and cultures.  They raped the land. They took what was not theirs.

Oh, wait, we are still doing it, huh!

No boredom *anywhere* in Avatar, and a much much MUCH heavier attention to action and adventure. That makes it better than Jurassic Park.

Since I have added a surround sound home theater system to my 40 inch high definition TV, the sound is truely amazing and you get the true theater experience.  In the double disc version you get the regular DVD in addition to the Blu ray disc.  One feature I like about the Blu ray disc is that if you stop the movie at some point during the movie you can resume playback at where you left off so you can resume watching the film at some future time and you don't have to start over at the beginning of the movie.  You can simply resume playback where you left off and can continue watching the film where you left off before.  Furthermore, there is an option on the Blu ray disc for selecting captioning for someone who may be hearing impaired. A friend and I were watching the movie and we were playing around with the remote and we got the captioning to appear on the screen.  The words of what is being said in the film appear in very easy to read yellow wording at the bottom of the screen.  This is an excellent feature of the disc and I have not seen this feature on a disc before.  This captioning feature is great if you know someone who is hearing impaired so they can enjoy the film too.  To select captioning, (at least this is how its done on my Sony Blu ray remote), press the menu button on Blu ray remote, then select ""setup"" then select ""subtitles"" then select the language you want, (another nice feature) then turn from ""off"" to ""on"".  This Blu ray disc has so many options that I haven't seen on other discs, (at least I haven't noticed them on other discs before).

""Avatar"" is fantastically done and the visual special effects are stunning and amazing.  Its a intriguing action packed space sci-fi adventure that takes place on the planet Pandora and the main idea behind the movie is where military and scientific personel try to convince the native humanoid species on Pandora, the Na'vi, to relocate from their ""Hometree"" so that the military can mine a very precious mineral that is in large quantities near ""Hometree"".  The story line has a spiritual message behind it which I found enlightening since I am quite spiritual myself.  For anyone who has or has not seen ""Avatar"" in the theater and is a sci-fi buff, the blu ray version is a must have.  I have always been a true sci-fi fan and in my opinion, ""Avatar"" is by far the best movie of its kind that is out there.  If you have a home theater system and high definition TV, you certainly won't be dissapointed in the quality of the sound and picture of the blu ray version and it will blow you away! The movie will enlighten and amaze you and you will be brought to a new home theater experience.",1288828800,2,2927,4.367158671586716

3932807,3,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar (2009).........CGI at its finest.  You'll see the latest computer generated image technology.  This movie is visually stunning, in some cases breathtaking, but the story suffers while the special effects are on display.  George Lucas once said, ""A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing"".  Years after he said that, he went on to make the Star Wars prequels, which were heavy on special effects and CGI while the stories suffered.  I like the prequels, but they don't compare to the original trilogy.  It seems that James Cameron has fallen into this mode as well, at least in this film.  Great movie visually, mediocre story.

This movie will make you feel like you're watching a video game.  It reminds me of the Star Wars prequels, especially Episodes I and II, and also King Kong (2005).

Do I recommend this movie?  I guess so.  Sorta.

3932809,4,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron has crafted a movie that is spectacular and disappointing at the same time. His world-building regarding the moon Pandora and its ecosystem is almost seamless, and fully realized on screen. You have no trouble believing he spent a decade developing the biosphere, well-inspired by his deep sea documentaries and other explorations into the natural world. Some of the characters are quite interesting as well, most notably the alien Neytiri (Sam Worthington's obligatory love interest) and the picture's eventual villain, Colonel Quaritch. The science fiction technology is also remarkable and realistic, and the final 40-minute battle scene is beyond doubt among the greatest scenes of combat ever portrayed on film.

Unfortunately, the rest of the movie falters as Cameron loses himself in this extraterrestrial take on the Noble Savage fallacy. Such a shame that this happened, too, since the tensions between the colonizing humans and the native Na'vi was ripe for moral complexity. The plotting also seemed lazy. If the humans and Na'vi are going to war, why not have it be for a better, more compelling reason than ""Well, their village just happens to be right on top of our needed resource, and so they need to move""? The dialogue was equally lethargic, with very few memorable catchphrases, and hardly any words to quicken the mind or get the blood pumping.

In all, Cameron's visual accomplishments with this epic cannot be denied, but it would have been a movie for the ages, akin to Lord of the Rings or Casablanca if only he had given more layers to its story and the people inhabiting it.

3932822,5,B002HEXVUI,"When the first Avatar BluRay disk was released I, and several others, reviewed the disk saying ""this is a cynical exploit - wait for the real release"". Well here it is, exactly as expected with exactly the amount of extra material we predicted and exactly the pricing strategy we expected. Next up, of course is the extended 3D experience although mercifully this is less needed (for most of us). No doubt we will see several future releases including a ""Director's Cut"" but for now this is the definitive set. If you took our advice and held-off buying the initial release, well now is the time to snag yourself a copy.

But what if you did buy the original disk? That's much harder. If you are a huge fan of Avatar and wish you could live on Pandora tomorrow, then the answer is yes. Much of the additional material does not work, but there are a number of scenes which needed to be in the film. Some of the dropped footage is complex and rich, but for various reasons didn't work so well in 3D. The 2D version is more effective but even so the material clashes with the flow and pace of the theatrical release. You do get an explanation about why the material they are mining is so valuable, and several obvious discontinuities in the film are resolved. But I can certainly see why most of the material was cut. Overall it adds a perspective that the enthusiast will appreciate but it less well formed, and less needed, than the additional material we saw on the extended version of ""Lord of the Rings"".

So this is the fan's edition and worth buying.

I'm looking forward to the next film in the series. My guess would be that in the second film Pandora will dream up a specialized creature that can be transported back to earth to revive a polluted and dying planet. Okay, I know, I'm a hopeless romantic. But it will need something pretty spectacular to cap a film of Avatar's magnitude and at the same time divert the viewer from asking questions such as ""what do you do on Pandora when you are the dominant lifeform, you have an abundance of food, and zero technology?"". Actually this sounds like quite a boring place to be! So let's hope that going forward we can continue to suspend credulity and simply enjoy the feel, the empathy, the beauty and sheer escapism that Avatar offered.

3932824,5,B002HEXVUI,"After all the hoopla on tv last year, I did skip out to the theater to see James Cameron's Avatar with my sons. I had great expectations, having seen Aliens, Terminator 1 & 2, The Abyss, Titanic, just to name a few of his blockbuster hits.  Cameron's films always come rolling in, guns blasting, edge of your seat action, heart thrilling scenes and teeth gnashing bad guys.  The exact thing I love.

Let me prepare you, this movie is two and a half hours long.  It is not something you take a child under the age of  eight to and expect them to sit still, unless they love video games and the entire idea of getting sucked into their own avatar.

I'm into XBOX 360 so, if you don't know what an avatar is, here's the definition compliments of Webster:  the incarnation of a Hindu deity; an incarnation in human form; an embodiment (as of a concept or philosophy)often in a person; a variant phase or version of a continuing basic entity; an electronic image that represents and is manipulated by a computer user (as in a computer game).

That's the entire idea behind this movie.  An alternative life from the one that you may have now.

I'll give you a heads-up, whatever bad you may hear about the movie, if you love Cameron's work, ignore it.

Avatar starts out a little slow.  If you're a fan of NatGeo or The Discovery Channel programs, the start of the film involves the subject of basic  'Living Among the Na'vi'.  The Na'vi are the indigenous people thriving on Planet Pandora and their existence is being threatened by a major corporation that wants a crucial mineral that exists only on their homeland.  There's a purpose for this, if you  have an open mind.

My thoughts:  So-Called Civilized man-made it a point to habitat foreign lands and either convert or destroy the locals for their own gain.  As always, the natives were refered to as savages, lacking any idea of the knowledge the civilized race brought them because they were just so backwards and ignorant.

Avatar explores the question: Would civilized man's thinking change if it were another planet?

Cameron paraplegic hero, Jake Sully, has the opportunity to live among the Na'vi in an alternate reality.  Jake molds, bonds and begins to understand.  He sees this new world and the natives for what they are, far more intelligent than his counterparts believe.  There is a bonding between the Na'vi and mother earth that is deep and profound, calling back to the tales we read from our own heritage.

This film is intriguing, beautiful, a dynamic explosion that bursts from the screen.  The jungle, the wildlife,the Na'vi,  the flora and fauna, there's not enough words to describe the beauty of this movie.  It's has captured the most breathtaking and believable artistic sense I have seen in years.

The drama and the greed brought on by what the Na'vi have on their land is brought to light with the savagery that must have been experienced by the indigenous people that populated our own world in the time of discovery.  Change or suffer the consequences, with the possibility of mass genocide by the so-called higher intelligence factor.

The hero, Jake Sully, has to decide what is more important.  The life he knew or the life that exists only in his dreams.

I'll leave you hanging there because I hate it when the review tells the entire story.  All I can say was there was, when I saw this film at the theater, there was a hushed lull that fell over the audience during the entire film, not a child cried, whimpered or whined.  Not a soul bounded up and down the stairs seeking refills or a bathroom break.  There was clapping throughout the audience when the credits rolled and my boys, ages 8 and 14, were among them.

 Great, great movie to add to your Christmas stocking stuffer list!",1287360000,47,3774,4.645015105740181

3932827,4,B002HEXVUI,"It's not exactly thrilling to learn that another of one's favorite directors has jumped on the CG bandwagon with their latest production. I mean, is it really necessary to spell out Star Wars I, II, III and George Lucas? Due to this, I haven't bothered to even consider seeing this until recently.

Now, since I have waited so long, I've missed the chance to see it rendered in full 3D in the theatre. I am, at least, familiar with the 3D experience, though, so I can imagine pretty well what it was like.

Sound production is rather excellent and immersive on the 7.1 setup (actually 7.0 since I stole the sub).

The CG blending on the characters when in their avatar form was done remarkably well. The lush environments of the planet, Pandora, were also exceedingly detailed. The only issues I noticed were with some of the creature animations, the 'Nantang' in particular.

The dialogue, as a whole, came off pretty well, though there were at least a couple points where I felt it was a bit lacking -- the whole, ""at first it was just orders, but then everything changed, I fell in love, etc. etc.."" is by now such trite dialogue, was it really necessary to have it in a movie which was made to push cinematic boundaries? It just felt slightly George Lucas of James Cameron and I wish he had handled that scene with a little more originality.

I just couldn't bring myself to give it an A rating, as much as I wouldn't mind. Even with considering the huge budget and the amount of effort that went into its creation, it's more a landmark in computer graphics than in film, at least from my perspective. I couldn't stop comparing a lot of the visuals to Crysis. They are breathtakingly beautiful, but they are still clearly CG and, in my book, it's not the effects that make a movie good.

--update--

So, it's the next day and I still have a lot of mixed feeling. Avatar is definitely a good movie with unquestionable production values. The question on my mind is, rather, how to judge the film in terms of story vs. characters vs. production. I think it would be something like the following, listed in order of personal importance:

Characters, B+
Story, B+
Production, A+

The characterization might have deserved higher, if Sigourney Weaver's character hadn't felt sometimes a little forced when trying to play the part of the hard-ass lead scientist. This leaves me with production as clearly the strongest aspect of the film and 3rd in personal importance. Therefore, I feel that my 'B++' rating is about right.",1286928000,3,2520,4.644943820224719

3932830,5,B002HEXVUI,"Once in a while a movie comes along that manages to encapsulate an entire subset of human experience within 2 - 3 hours of on-screen entertainment.  The Ten Commandments with Charleton Heston is a good example of such a film, along with Gandhi and Ben Hur.  I would put Avatar into this discussion, as it is that great of a movie.  The plot is simple enough; in the far future mankind has discovered a planet rich with a valuable resource.  Mankind has sent its military to acquire this resource.  The military funds a science research program whose goal is to convince the natives of planet Pandora to quietly step aside so they can mine this resource.  Known as unobtanium, this resource cannot be breathed or ingested, and instead looks like a cross between oil and coal, and hence I assume is needed by mankind's corporations.  One of the military gradually switches sides and leads the natives in a successful uprising that defines the movie's climax and probably accounted for most of its budget.

The greatness of this movie lies in three things.  First, it creates a world that is the most unique, complete, believable and original setting since the planets seen in the original Star Wars trilogy.  A lot of other movies have created entire worlds from scratch, such as the LOTR and Narnia movies, but none have so completely created a believable ecosystem of plants, animals and different environments in which predator and prey interact like they do on Earth.  Second, the depiction of the fictional Nav'i race is astounding.  From their courtship rituals to initiation rites to social structure and so on, its as if James Cameron hired a crew of anthropologists and sociologists to work on this movie.  Third, this is the first and only American movie I have seen to clearly and completely illustrate the following principle: scientific research is set by military policy, which in turn is driven by corporations, which in turn is focused on the acquisition of non-renewable resources.  To be able to pull this off in a Hollywood dominated by the Pentagon is quite an accomplishment, and by itself makes this movie worth the money and time to watch.",1286582400,6,2160,4.8501362397820165

Cameron has crafted an entire painstakingly detailed world onscreen, and as long as we stay immersed in that world AVATAR delivers all that it promises.

But like so many sci-fi creators, Cameron committed the Cardinal Sin: He spent a half-billion dollars on effects and a buck three eighty on the storyline, which is nothing more than an unsatisfying high tech extraterrestrial version of cowboys and indians.

Considering that he probably could have cured cancer for what this picture cost to make, Cameron should spend the next ten years in retreat, doing just that.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hurt-Locker/dp/B00275EGWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hurt Locker</a>&nbsp;wasn't much as a Best Picture winner that year but it sent the message loud and clear that obscenely budgeted movies still need to have more than flash in order to succeed.",1286496000,8,1132,5.813253012048193

Not only are there 2 blu-rays chock full of amazing sounding special features, but we're also getting a 3 hour extended edition featuring the movie's original opening set on planet Earth, this is sure to be the definitive version of the movie to please fans of the original. In addition to the Earth opening, there are plenty of other new and extended scenes, featuring new locations, new animals, more action, and in addition to this are many scenes that help to improve the flow of the story, making Avatar into an even richer film. James Cameron is well known for his Special Editions that improve on his original movies, and this Extended Edition of Avatar is sure to follow in those footsteps. It should also be mentioned that finishing these extra scenes cost over 5 Million dollars, as none of them, except for 1, were completed when the movie was originally released, its not often that so much work and effort is put into an extended edition.

And as amazing as all the announced special features seem, the one that will surely make this set worth owning will without a doubt be the Interactive scene deconstruction. With the ability to view the film in 3 key forms, the original motion capture with the actors in the soundstage, the ""template"" which is the inbetween of the motion capture and the final CG, and of course the final version, as well as Picture in Picture with interviews and commentary, this special feature is one that is only possible with the advanced storage space of Blu-Ray.

I thought about waiting for this release to buy the movie but I was excited to watch the movie at home. Avatar was an awesome concept but the ""cool factor"" of the movie is cut by well over half without 3-D. The plot is preachy and uninspired (watch FurnGully for further proof). Who ever thought 54$ for a blu-ray that isn't a couple of film's was a good idea is clearly just trying to milk us for every cent they possibly can.

3932837,5,B002HEXVUI,"The other user reviews hit the nail on the head about this movie and its stunning and ground breaking visual effects, so I won't repeat what they've already said so well.

The review provided by Amazon misses an important point.  It claims that there was a disconnect between the main character's love of gismos and weaponry, and his tree-hugging attitude.  Instead, I would offer that this was obviously part of his character development, not static confusion.  Over time and with the experience of living in a native way, he grew beyond the boy-gizmo-shoot-it-up mentality, into a more holistic and truly powerful frame of mind.  I think this is a parody for how America will hopefully grow out of adolescence (and war/anti environmental mentality) and into a more mature and interconnected mindset.

Along those lines, I liked the clear references to Native or Aboriginal belief systems and ways of being in the world.  Of course it's still entertainment and Hollywood, but if it plants even a seed of understanding - that everything in nature is real, alive, sacred - we may create a better future for our kids.  The fact that these themes were woven into a movie of this scale (and ultimately, popularity) is also truly groundbreaking and a breath of fresh air.

Kudos to Cameron and the crew!",1286409600,22,1298,4.890410958904109

3932842,3,B002HEXVUI,"I had the following review under the new Avatar Bluray and apparently I really pissed off the diehard Avatar fans there. They wanted me to NOT review the FILM, but review the Bluray PRODUCT. Isn't the product the film?! I guess they are just buying the extras and not the feature. Weird to me, but I caved! Anyways...here's my film review under the original DVD section where it will hopefully be seen as less ""offensive"".

I'm pretty sure I don't need to say much about the film Avatar (2009).  If you haven't heard of this movie by now, you're WAY unplugged from the entertainment world.  I'm surprised at myself for not seeing this movie in the theater, but I waited for Blu-Ray instead.  James Cameron's first movie since his billion dollar blockbuster Titanic (1997) is now the #1 box office movie of all time in both the U.S. and the world.  But in my humble opinion, it is not Cameron's best movie.  I still think Titanic (1997), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), and The Abyss (1989) are better films.  And of course Aliens (1986) and The Terminator (1984) are on most people's lists of great Cameron films as well.  I would put Avatar somewhere in the middle of that list.  While the technology within Avatar is amazing, I don't think the storytelling was at the same level.  One thing I've come to learn about great films and great acting is that people are the key to both.  And while the Avatar characters are fully acted and voiced by talented actors, something just seems to be missing in the translation from human to avatar.  It's hard to put a finger on it really.  It's not that the artificial characters can't have the emotions and soul of a human being, because they do in movies like the original Star Wars Trilogy, but I just don't feel that they fully do in this particular movie.  Maybe it's just the story that doesn't engage the actors.  Maybe everyone was so fascinated with the technology that they lost sight of just telling the story.  I don't know the answers.  But I do know that this movie disappointed me because I wanted to love it as much or more than Titanic, Terminator 2 and The Abyss...but I just didn't.  Maybe I've changed and Avatar just isn't a movie for me anymore?

What I will say is that you should definitely watch Avatar because it is a good movie.  And it is great filmmaking.  The movie looks incredible.  The world of Pandora that Cameron has imagined and constructed is incredible and beautiful.  And certainly no one can argue that Cameron is having an incredible impact on the business of filmmaking what with all the focus on 3D this year.  Personally I think 3D will NOT take over filmmaking like it seems to be argued by so many.  I think filmmaking will always be about the story and acting, and that the medium in which the story is told is secondary in service to the story.  I'm sure a lot of Hollywood Blockbusters will now be shot in 3D and shown in 3D, but after the fad fades a bit, we'll get back to evaluating what stories should be told in 3D and what stories should not be told in 3D.  I don't consider 3D to be as big of a game changer as color was to film.  3D has been around for 50 years or more and has recently gotten some technology breakthroughs, but as a film enthusiast and budding filmmaker, I'm not very enthralled with 3D.  Even now we still shoot some films in black & white when it serves the story.  And EVERY film's color is manipulated from reality.  Even when the film looks like reality, that was because the filmmakers color corrected the film to look more ""real"".  It all serves the story in the end.  That's my message.  We'll see where we are at in 20-30 years.  Maybe I'll be completely wrong!",1286323200,2,3690,4.464872944693573

3932846,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is one of the most creative movies I have ever seen.  The real star of this movie is the planet of Pandora, inhabited by fifteen foot tall, blue humanoids and a wonder full array of exotic plants and animals.  I think that James Cameron surpasses George Lucas, when it comes to creating an other world environment.  The plot is really simple.  People of Earth have discovered a rare mineral on Pandora, and they are willing to destroy the natives' land to get it.  It reminds one of the westward advance of the Europeans against the native Americans.  It is a bit romantic in that Mr. Cameron portrays the native Pandorans as noble savages, while the miners from Earth are totally evil.  It is hard to judge the acting performances, because the special and visual effects make it hard to determine what is acting and what is effects.  In my opinion Zoe Saldana deserves credit.  Behind the cat-like face, the yellow eyes, and the tall, blue body she is somehow able to bring her character to life more effectively than the other Na Vi.  I enjoyed seeing Stephen Lang, who portrayed Gen. George Pickett in the movie Gettysburg, in a starring role.  Astronomers are saying they have discovered a planet that may have earth like qualities.  I for one hope that if we ever get there we will find Pandora.",1286150400,2,1307,4.6347826086956525

The movie looks great but there is no BDLive content, special features, or extras of any kind. I was disappointed with the lack of any features besides just the theatrical release. If you want to own this movie, wait for a more feature-rich version.",1286150400,,466,4.430232558139535
3932848,3,B002HEXVUI,"This is the essence of a commercial Hollywood movie, slick and professional on the production values, shallow on the ideas, and a bit of ad-hoc environmentalism thrown in to curry favor with the LA politically correct set who decide Academy Award nominations. The real star of this movie is the computer of course - Cameron spent a boatload of money generating graphics in groundbreaking 3D. I haven't seen the 3D theater version, but the home Blu-Ray is spectacular enough. Wondrous synthetic imagery. How do they do it, such convincing imaginary beasts and foliage from another world?? The best part; swooping around the treetops and waterfalls on the backs of flying dragons. The digital wizards who created this - Wow.

But all the imagination is with the computer programmers. The producers settled for a simple-minded story line, just an updated version of Rainforest Indians versus Evil White Exploiters (EWE) Who Want Their Minerals. The Indians ride around on fantastically imagined space-horsies and actually chant war cries; Yip Yip Yip, like Apaches in a John Wayne movie. I noticed with puzzlement that the Indians (OK, Navi) are called Great Warriors - they carry long bows and 4' arrows - but it is never made clear exactly whom they make war against since there don't seem to be any other tribes. We only see them in defense mode, worshipping the Great Tree and being all touchie-feelie with The Spirit of the Forest. And morally superior to the wretched EWE's, who are cartoon villains with no redeeming qualities. Just bad, bad people.

Of course there is a love interest. The EWE sends a guy, and the guy falls in love with a squaw. Who wouldn't fall in love with this squaw, she's nine feet tall, blue, long long hair, and eyes as big as bowling balls? She does have a weird nose but it seems to run in her family, and everyone is too polite to mention it.

And of course Sigourney Weaver has made a career of being brave whenever scarey monsters are around. And Michelle Rodriguez is the same sexy tough chick as always, on any planet or century, so long as they have helicopters and guns and she can bust some caps. This shows that tough babes with guns will still be there in the far future, which I found comforting.

So watch this for the amazing computer graphics - but all the talk about its cosmic meaning? Give me a break.

OK now, let's try to envision the sequel - at least one is said to be in the works. I see the story picking up after the Navi drive out the EWE and have a pow-wow where they realize that mining Unobtanium on their own is not such a bad idea after all. There are roadblocks - galactic regulators who throw a lot of environmental red tape in their way, but the Navi hire some high power lawyers and manage to strip mine the rainforest. This pollutes their planet of course but hey, they become wealthy, trade their dragon-bird rides for black Cadillac Space-Utility-Vehicles with tinted windows, the whole bit. Now we know that in the long run, Indians want only one thing - casinos - and the Navi are no different. So they build the biggest casino on any world - a fantastic Las Vegas of the future - with giant rainforest hotels (""Pandora's Box"") built over that waterfall. And very tall blue cocktail waitresses in skimpy outfits who bring tall blue signature drinks in tall blue glasses (Nav-tinis) made with exotic fruits and atomic vodka, right to your gaming table. Soon Pandora becomes known throughout the galaxy as a wide-open planet .. even a few Nav-a-Ho's cruise the casinos whispering if anybody wants a 'Blue-Job.' A Blue-Job? I won't even speculate what that might mean. What happens on Pandora stays on Pandora.",1286064000,4,3679,4.6976744186046515

3932854,2,B002HEXVUI,"This has to be one of worst films that I've seen in recent times. The only reason for two stars is that the graphics are incredibly well done.  The story is how a group of earthmen (mostly Marines and scientists) have need for a certain ore on a distant planet Pandora occupied by tall blue people called Navi. The earthmen have no regard for the environment of the planet, and run ripshod to tear up ""sacred"" landscape in order to obtain their ore. Eventually, the natives win out and are able to drive out the earthlings. So, what's wrong with the film? 1. Character development: acting was poor. None of the characters in the film could be called admirable. Most were sullen, angry people (or Navi) bent on idolization of themselves. Sig. Weaver was a worn out hag. The Navi were angry, never happy, quite war-like and certainly not at peace even with themselves. The military marines and scientists were painted at thoughtless, brain-dead, clueless. The earth ""traitors"" that went over to the Navi side lacked any sort of insightful virtue. 2. Plot. This film has often been criticized for portraying developers and industrialists against environmentalists. That is too simple of an analysis. It one looks at the  Navi, they are essentially dressed with African animistic paraphernalia, and the thematic structure of their ""religion"" is essentially animistic and pantheistic, with the world ""force"" emanating out though every living being that is connected to the ""mother"". Animism didn't get the Africans and other primitive tribes too far, and fantasy films are now necessary to promote such religion of animism that is taking over America by storm. In total, this film made it for its graphics arts effects and not for its story, and so barely deserves two stars.",1285718400,3,1770,4.956228956228956

3932856,5,B002HEXVUI,"*Note: Review contains spoilers.

omg. OMG. What a fantastic film! I saw AVATAR  in 3D IMAX the first day it came out, and I still bought this DVD. I completely ignored everyone who said wait for the version coming out in November, I just couldn't wait that long to see it at home, and own my own piece of blue magic. I can unequivocally say that AVATAR was the best movie I have ever seen. And I have seen a lot of movies. Hands down, five stars. Hell, I'd give it six stars.

I know there was a lot of hype behind this film given the astronomical amount of money that James Cameron poured into it, but seriously, for once the movie matched all the hype. AVATAR was phenomenal.

First, the cinematography was amazing. Viewing the film in 3D was like being a immersed into the landscape of Pandora - a part of its lush forests with multi-hued fantastic flora and fauna of all kinds. It was uniquely magnificent, and I was transported into that world from the very first glimpse of the planet. The Na'vi were fascinating as a species, both to look at in terms of their cat-like beauty and grace to their way of life and deeply-rooted metaphysical relationship with their planet. I loved Zoe Saldana's character, Neytiri. She was so fierce and beautiful and feminine, all in one package. What a fantastic character - such a strong female heroine! Neytiri was real and gritty and more ""human"" than some of her human counterparts in recent movies. She was so entrenched in her feelings. You could hear her raw emotion when she cried after her father died or when Jake revealed his betrayal. Zoe Saldana delivered a spectacular performance, worthy of recognition. Despite only seeing her in CGI'd Na'vi form, her ability to deliver that kind of gut performance goes beyond anything I've ever seen.

I had to admit I had some misgivings because I believed going in to see Avatar that there was going to be an unhappy ending - after all, how does a human possessing the body of a Na'vi via a machine get to live happily ever after? The human controller must survive for the Na'vi avatar to live. But I loved the way that James Cameron resolved this for me. Not to give away too much, but Pandora's magic, the spirit of Eywa, just made it come together so naturally when Jake Sully assumes the consciousness of his avatar for good, that I was spellbound.

I loved Sam Worthington's character, Jake Sully. I was rooting for him the whole time and I really wanted Neytiri to fall for him. Of course she had to be the daughter of the clan leader and seer! That was the only part that was a little predictable, but you always have to have an untouchable ""princess"" in these types of stories. Worked for me! When Jake Sully shows up with the Leonopteryx, as the sixth Toruk Makto, I felt my heart jump for him. That was just awesome!! In a lot of ways, the film itself became a medium for me to experience his character's first interaction with Pandora and the Na'vi - almost as if it were the avatar and I, it's human connection.  How's that for a mind-twister?

The conflict battle scenes were spectacular. I felt so emotionally connected to the Na'vi that I found myself gripping the arms of my seat when their Hometree was destroyed and when they were attacked by the sky-people. Sigourney Weaver was as awesome as she was in Alien, although not in the lead role this time, but she is just made for these types of movies. I've always been a huge fan of hers and all the Alien films.

I was connected to this movie the whole time, feeling goosebumps and a sense of breathlessness many times throughout its 162 minute run-time. At the end when Neytiri jumps into the shack and saves the human Jake, that scene was so emotionally touching - you just felt that it didn't matter what species they were - she loved him, and he, her. When they said ""I see you"" to each other, I felt their love in my toes. And that is an emotional connection, folks.

This film took me away from a very mundane reality to a fantastic world that I just didn't want to leave. I would watch Avatar again in a heartbeat! One of the things that makes a movie great is its ability to draw in its viewers and to make them connect emotionally, visually, and aurally with its message. Avatar accomplished that and more. It was a movie that I didn't want to end. I walked out of the movie theater with a fist pump and a huge grin, completely satisfied, which is more than I can say for many, many other films. You will experience the gambit of human emotions through the film, and for those critics who've said that it has no real plot or story, well they're the ones without imagination. Avatar is not just a fantasy or sci-fi film, it's a love story with a ton of action and some pretty neat concepts (like all life on Pandora being connected like the synapses of the human brain).

This film has no equal. I bought this DVD even without the special features. And I will probably buy the one with all the bells and whistles. 5 stars.

The box office hit Avatar; it not only features scenes of unimaginable picture but also extreme moments of action and intricate story telling. It involves magical themes, love stories, war, and family. The picture is about a soldier by the name Jake Sully who in the event of his brothers death must go to Pandora and become the driver for the ""Avatar"". In all irony he ends up growing a love for the indigenous people and their ways and sees that what the military is doing is false and completely immoral.
It all begins with Jake Sully (""a paralyzed soldier in the United States Marines"") who in the event of his brothers must take place as the Avatar Driver. In 6 years time he reaches the planet Pandora and is briefed on his training immediately. He later meets Dr. Grace in which she protests at him for not being a scientist. Following he takes the Avatar out for the First time in which he experiences motor skills for the first time in many years. The next day he goes out into the jungle to explore the land and in the surprising chance he ends up being separated from his squad while being chased by a giant animal of the land, in which he turns out getting the indigenous people of the planet which is the military Colonels ("" Colonel Miles's"") goal all along in which he gets close to the people so that the humans can take over their land to obtain a rich and expensive metal known as unobtainium.
After getting close to the people and one Navi girl (""Neytiri"") Jake realizes his wrong doing and wishes to patch things up but before so the military attacks the land after figuring out that he is too attached to the Navi people. As a result the Navi people are done with Jake but he comes up with the idea that I he captures Haruk Muk To (The lands largest and most fierce Banshee or flying dragon) that the people will except him once more. In which case he does and the land and Navi people are shocked because it has been unseen for at least a whole generation. The Navi people love their land more then we appreciate ours so they fly out and gather together to save the land itself in which they are all connected to. With many casualties a war goes on between the two in which many of the main characters pass away but with death comes new life and Jake completes his goal and saves the land and the Navi people from the Colonel and the greedy miners. He later is brought to the prayer tree and is made a permanent member of the Navi people trading his old body for a new.
The movie is very long and intricate but its themes will attract the eyes and attention of people from all walks because it is without a doubt a great piece of work. It isn't too long or empty at any point and it grabs your attention during the entire three hours of its duration.

We should take warning that we are borrowing energy from our planet and not returning it. I watch this movie, almost, every other day. Can't get enough of it!

3932862,1,B002HEXVUI,"Guys, I think the beginning of this movie project was like that:
James Cameron invited some of crew to his house for a secret meeting.
James and crew start watching `Dances with Wolves' (Kevin Costner) made in 1990 while they taking drugs (perhaps marijuana).
James starts writing a NEW and ORIGINAL story for the movie which they called it `Avatar' later, while crew and of course James were high and had very colorful imagination.
They start to make an Animation, but try to represent is as a MOVIE with VERY HIGH TECH SPECIAL EFFECTS.
And then people watch the movie and think: WOW, what an original story. WOW, what a special effect. WOW, What a director. And ...
And this is end of story: the movie gets all time highest Gross revenue worldwide. (Funny but sad)
For those who want to see this movie without special effects, I recommend you guys to watch Dances with Wolves.",1285027200,2,878,4.634615384615385

It's not that there isn't anything likable about this movie, the visuals are stunning.  But the dialog is incredibly corny and the plot is unoriginal ('Dances with Toruk' is a more honest name for the movie).

(Madame Tussaud, eat your heart out!) Then I figured out that the characters that SEEMED real were way too stiff to be real people.  (You could tell by the way their lips hardly moved that their lines had been dubbed over the original Japanese.) So, I just sat back and enjoyed the special effects--ferns, trees, seeds.  But then--huge disappointment--these big blue guys showed up and spoiled everything. I mean, it was so OBVIOUS that they were just a bunch of Indian extras from Pocahontas. Then, the Virginia Company gave 'em hell with a bunch of Centurions and heavy raiders and turned the entire forest into South LA.

3932886,3,B002HEXVUI,"In general, I agree with the low-star crowd, although positive reviews are comfortably in the majority. Avatar has some spectacular visuals but they are not enough to carry the movie to greatness. I actually got bored during one of the more slack parts of the film in the Na'vi camp with the lame dialog. It was like watching a bad movie about American Indians who had to decide what to do with the cowboy in their custody. Here's another small peeve of mine: There's nothing in the water. At one point, the main character jumps off a cliff into the water below to escape a fearsome jungle predator. But there's nothing in the water, no fish, no snakes, no leeches, no Pandorian alligators or amphibians, no beasties of any kind. The tail hookups are also a bit ridiculous with their universal plug-n-play capabilities. And finally, the tree of life left me underwhelmed. Apparently it's a kind and gentle version of the planet's Borg nerve center.

Avatar is a movie that you certainly should watch at least once and then decide where your sensibilities fall. It's mostly entertaining but says nothing new or significant about the human condition, love, the environment, our place in the universe, culture, or technology. The film certainly has a message. It's just not new or unique in any way. I don't think it's a classic or even an important film. (But don't take my word for it. Read the selected comments from Rotten Tomatoes that I added to this review.) In summary: Lush visuals and some nicely done special effects, but recycled plot lines, mediocre acting, and hokey dialog. It's like a dinner party with good appetizers and tasty desserts, but a dry meat dish and overcooked vegetables. The only thing that I'd really like to see more of is Michelle Rodriquez.

Review of the standard 1 disk DVD

I was not fortunate enough to see the film in theaters during it's original release, so I opted to see it on a standard 1 disk DVD because the price was right, the film is great no matter what format you view it in, but I have to admit the DVD was lacking because it had no extras what so ever, & the picture quality was pretty standard, I originally gave the standard DVD 4 stars because as I said the movie is amazing but standard DVD does not do enough justice to this film especially without extras.

Review for the Blu-ray 3 Disk Extended Collector's Edition:

Awesome, awesome, & did I say awesome? lol this disk set is loaded with a ton of extras & the picture quality is amazing everything looks even more realistic in High-Def you get an extended version of the original theatrical release + directors cut version of the film & other bonus features such as a behind the scenes look at the making of the film & a lot more, there is so many extras that I'm not quite sure I viewed them all yet I love this Blu-ray set, some say it's still not worth buying but I say if you are a true fan of this film it's definitely worth buying in my opinion I give this Blu-Ray 3 disk set 5 full stars LOVE IT!

Last notes: there is no audio commentary on the blu-Ry 3 disk set or the standard 1 disk DVD

Spoilers Ahead!

Avatar is a crap movie. The whole story line is a ripoff of Disney's Pocahontas. Character for character Avatar mimics the story. For instance, Jake Sully, a man who goes to another planet or another world to exploit the land but falls in love with the Cheif's daughter, is obviously John Smith. They even have the same initials. Most of the characters in Avatar are exactly the same people is Disney's Pocahontas. It is ridiculous! The only main difference the Native Americans in this movie are blue aliens in a different time period. How creative James Cameron!

That is not my only problem with this movie. It may be visually stunning but the plot was just so obvious what would happen that the movie was just plain boring. I didn't buy the love story in it at all. The only character I did like, the Colonel, dies in the end. He killed his own people to save a tree. Ughhhhhhhhhhhhh.......

I'm a huge science fiction lover and I should have enjoyed this movie. But I really didn't. If you're the kind of person who enjoys story lines and interesting characters, do not buy this movie. Go buy Disney's Pocahontas, it at least has lovely musical numbers.",1282089600,3,1404,4.537549407114624

  Hollywood, keep your moronic ideology to yourself.
  The director obviously believes in mother earth, and globalism, wait let us not forget the buzz word they like to throw around ""sustainability"", that may sound good on the surface until you find out who decides how to implement it and find out sustainability means nothing to them, they simply wish to have control over others. It is that type of thinking that requires no thinking. Where in the hell do they think their ability to sustain themselves comes from? They think it is the government and the fact is the government produces zero, it consumes/taxes, people who work and produce products other then entertainment are the ones that put food on their plates.

3932907,5,B002HEXVUI,"BEFORE YOU BUY:
This boxed set features the film in two flavors: Blu-Ray and DVD. It's presented in a glorious 16:9 (1.78) aspect ratio for Full Screen playback on your HDTV! This was clearly cropped and derived from the original IMAX 4K Master, but with a little more screen space preserved and shown for those of us who saw it in Dolby/Digital 3D with the 35mm projection at a 2.39:1 aspect ratio. The transfer is the highest quality I've seen so far, with no banding, artifacts, or grain visible. On a low note there are no special features or behind-the-scenes/making of videos on this release- as expected and that's okay. However some of those- including a 22 minute making of feature have long been released on the internet for free, presented up to 1080p. Search ""Creating the World of Pandora"" for example. While the 3D experience was definitely innovative and mature, it's not presented here. After viewing this in 2D it's safe to say that it'll hardly be missed.

THE MOVIE:
The story presented of ""Avatar"" is one we've heard before in many flavors and forms- especially in western society. Even if you didn't see the trailer it's not hard at all to feel it's familiarity & predict what's to come not too far in. But why should predictability be labeled a bad thing? Let's face it: the only part that surprised us with Cameron's previous feature- easily among the most predictable movies of all time, ""Titanic"" -was when Jack died. Even if you didn't read the ""Lord of the Rings"" books, you know that Sauron and the One Ring will eventually be destroyed, and Middle Earth would return to peace. ""Star Wars"" wasn't the first ""farm boy becomes a knight to save a princess"" tale either. It's about how a story is told, it's pacing and it's content. While ""Avatar"" is heavily technical above all the other usual areas of film making, there's a great story here that profoundly resonated with the worldwide audience unlike anything since ""Titanic,"" out performing the previous $1.8 billion record with a staggering $2.7 billion box office take. To put that into perspective, ""The Return of the King"" has gotten the closest to eclipsing ""Titanic"" since then with $1.1 billion but still short $700 million. These numbers aren't adjusted for inflation but still reflect the previous decade's releases quite well. It was Cameron and his team who took this risk and we should be inspired by his astonishing, if hardly surprising success.

For those who say that it wasn't for the story in Avatar which helped it grab all that money then ""Transformers 2"" would of grossed $2 billion on visuals alone while ""How to Tame Your Dragon"" would of reached similar heights because of it's great 3D. Unfortunately for the naysayers, ""Avatar"" is a universal story that people like, a form of the Hero's Journey- all while engineered and aimed at the large audience. On a side note the story is also heavily liberal, with sometimes in-your-face political references- which isn't exactly a bad thing, but some may view it as one-sided or possibly annoying by the way it's presented. However, in the context of what Cameron is calling for- a respect for nature, the environment, and people who are not like us, it works brilliantly well in the end.

The acting ranges from average to exceptional, with Zoe Saldana as ""Neytiri"" clearly the star of the show and giving us a great physical & emotional performance. The dialogue is possibly the weakest part of the film, but why be so nit picky with a movie like this? It's possible to look at it all as almost completely hokey, yet if you allow it ""Avatar"" will take your breath away. On a good day I'd rate it an 8/10, but it continues to remain my personal favorite at this time.

THE TECHNICAL SIDE:
Plot, dialogue, and perhaps a lack of overall depth to shorten the movie aside, on a technical level alone- this film is nearly a masterpiece if there ever was. Almost nothing can prepare you for the near flawless execution of Visual Effects, Film Editing, Cinematography, Music/Score, and even Sound Mixing/Editing minus the borrowed ""Jurassic Park"" sound effects. The visuals are completely out of this world with nearly 60% of the movie being entirely CGI, with entire forests, sunlight and all presented in near photo-realistic quality. The Film Editing and pacing is top notch as well- with the opening sequence & end battle being among the highlights, choreographed with Cameron's endless lust for perfection. For the story we're being sold here not one moment goes by where it feels too lengthy or overdone. The camera work is solid too, with most of the shots being by Cameron himself with his virtual camera system, finally eliminating the ""dreaded CG camera."" In some of the shots & zooms toward the end of the movie you can even feel Cameron's confidence, or maybe it's just joy- in what he's doing. The music is sweeping and outstanding as well, but also somewhat formulaic- which isn't a bad thing either. It's worthy to note that the score and editing/pacing of this movie almost trumps the visuals- and together it all comes off as very powerful. The motion capture of the actors, minus their tails and ears which were animated are incredible, taking Gollum from the ""Lord of the Rings"" and Davy Jones from ""Dead Man's Chest"" to the next level with totally surreal and believable face & emotion capture. Any and all ""uncanny valley"" feelings have been completely eliminated here. These characters feel even more real and alive than ever before on the big screen.

The true ""Special Edition"" due out later this year will feature the movie in three flavors: the original theatrical cut, the extended but completed +8-10 minute cut, and finally, a +40 minute cut featuring completed in animation/form yet unrendered, pre-visual additional scenes. The disk will also present us a Director's Journey as well as other interesting features & material showcasing the technology and people behind the movie. However, if you're into buying twice, have enough money, could care less, or simply lack enough patience like me, this version may be for you.",1281312000,9,6093,4.8491834774255524
3932908,4,B002HEXVUI,"Science fiction film set in the year 2154 about a paraplegic soldier called Jake Sully who is part of the army of a company from Earth called the RDA corporation and who goes with the corporation and its army to an alien world called Pandora in a distant planetary system. Pandora has large deposits of a mineral called unobtanium which has much market value and which will mean much profits for the RDA corporation if the deposits can be mined. But there is a problem: the deposits of this mineral are sitting underneath the home of a tribe of the savage and pre-technological indigenous aliens of this world (the Na'vi) and if these deposits are to be mined the tribe's home - a large tree the size of a small mountain that seems to be a person - will have to be destroyed. Man has mastered technology that allows a human being to transport his consciousness into another body, and a number of Na'vi versions of these bodies have been cloned. Sully is called to have his consciousness transported into one of these bodies, to become what is called an `avatar' (Hindu for a god in human form). The corporation's hope is that as an avatar Sully will be accepted into the society of the Na'vi tribe they want to move from their home (the Na'vi are generally suspicious of man (whom they refer to as `the sky people')) and as the tribe come to trust him Sully will be able to persuade the tribe to move out of their home peacefully and relocate. However if this strategy fails, the corporation is prepared to use military force to force the Na'vi tribe out of their tree home. But as Sully spends time as an avatar with the tribe of Na'vi and gets to know them and their world, he comes to understand that they will never leave their tree home because they are spiritually tied to it. But this inevitably means that they will be forced out of their home by the RDA corporation, and having fallen in love with the Na'vi people and their world Sully begins to see the objectives of the RDA corporation as unjust and changes allegiances when the RDA corporation starts moving to force the tribe of Na'vi out of their home using military force because the avatar strategy has failed. But Sully is not alone: a small number of other men from the RDA corporation (who have also had crises of conscience about what the RDA corporation wants to do) join him to fight alongside the tribe of Na'vi to defend their tree home against the RDA corporation and its army. And so with the stakes the removal of a tribe of an alien people from their home by human military force for corporate ends the battle is joined.

Comments: I was pleased to see men acting on their conscience in this film against corporate evil. I was also pleased to see that in this film the Na'vi aliens live in harmony with their world Pandora and take care of it (i.e. do not destroy it), unlike us men who largely destroy our earth. I loved the beauty of Pandora - its fauna, flora and geography - and Pandora was actually more beautiful than the earth. But I was not pleased that the film's makers chose to give the Na'vi aliens sub-Saharan Negro African accents, to drive home the fact that they were savages. This was somewhat racist; in fact one of the human characters in the film at one point with contempt refers to the Na'vi as `blue monkeys' (the Na'vi are blue-skinned), an obvious insult. Also the name of the mineral that causes all the trouble in the film (unobtanium) is silly and a little obvious. Apart from these quibbles it was a very good film with a stunning climax. I especially loved Pandora's native Toruk dragons and the bond that they formed with their riders, including our hero Sully. But the title of the film `Avatar' and the use of this word in the film is incorrect because it implies that the central human character in the film Sully was viewed by the tribe of Na'vi aliens as a god because he came `from the sky' and had changed his form from human to Na'vi when in fact the Na'vi viewed men with hostility and suspicion (which is why Sully becomes an avatar in the first place). Nonetheless an excellent film which comes highly recommended.",1281312000,,4135,4.484084880636605

3932910,1,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron in my opinion is a egotistical director that really isn't that talented.

Avatar Sucked. Titanic was Cheesy, Aliens was no where near as revolutionary or original as Alien, yet this Jerk thinks he can make negative reactions to every movie that comes up against his. Sure his movies make tons of money. That means nothing to me. The stories are predictable and campy. That ""I See You"" line in Avatar was the stupidest thing I've ever heard, Plus the element called unobtainium....are you joking! That is so retarded. Just because his movies make money doesn't always mean it's a great movie (Let's remember Brittany Spears sold Millions of albums, are any of those really great albums or are they just marketed well?), In his case it is just that he has the money to spend on marketing and building up hype for his films. I admit he does do that well. I loved the Burger King commercials for Avatar, where a burger magically appears between the female and male lead characters...real classy to let your work be marketed like that James! But for money he does it and it sells tickets. Then this Idiot has the nerve to attack films like Terminator Salvation, Clash of the Titans and other films because they are competition, and because he thinks he is the best director in the world. What a pompous loser.

All I got from this movie was bad acting, cheesy lines, way overdone special effects that often times just looked like a video game, and an ultra predictable plot line. It was not original, it just fed off scifi films that were before it that did it better. Even though this film seemed to be so popular the vast majority of people I talk to were disappointed by it.

I think James Cameron needs to let some of the air out of his over inflated fat head. That's probably why BP laughed him out the door when he proposed a plan to stop the oil leak in the Gulf. This idiot is so fat-headed he thinks he can fix the worlds problems. Maybe we can plug up the leak with some unobtainium you dummy! I guarantee you this will all be revealed when he releases Avatar 2 in 2012. I can't wait to see what that piece of crap is going to be like. I bet the sales are no where near the first one because now people know how weak this story is.

Great sound and great transfer, but I kept seeing parts of Alan Dean Foster's ""Midworld"" in this movie.  From the people living there and being exploited for the goods native to the world.  People living and cavorting in the trees.  Burying their dead with the forest to become one with it.  All of the world connected through plants and people.  No furcots but the people ride horses and flying steeds while having a mental connection with them (I'm thinking Dragonriders here).  The people have to fight the invaders, and the people win.  The people even have a ""home tree.""  So a great movie but a rip on several books:  Midworld, The Dragonriders of Pern, and even Fern Gully.",1280620800,,811,4.601398601398602

On the oher hand, you can't miss Avatar. It's gorgeous to look at, the capture performances are both artistically and technologically inspired and the CG is sometimes indistinguishable from live filming. It is a historic event, a milestone of digital cinema. Because for the first time you can forget that digital film is what you're watching. Many cinema studies will go back to ""Avatar"" for decades to come until they create something better and more expensive for us to consume. But the script seems like it was written in the early 90s. You'll get a classic 90s villian-hero confrontation complete with a library of cliche catch-phrases, but some sharply choreographed action sequences like no other director can deliver today. And on Blu-Ray it is stunning.

A word of advice: Don't buy a 3D TV. 3D is highly overrated, it's just the compensation Hollywood's looking for to ease their fear of the home theater business.  Just quietly wait until they get over it, and continue to buy movies in 2D.",1280188800,,1223,4.898550724637682

3932941,1,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is little more than a propaganda film to make Americans look bad.

Why some Yanks spend money on this is beyond me.

Avatar begins with the now VERY familiar premise that humanity has used all its natural resources and now must look elsewhere for its necessities.

The 'futuristic' (Set in the year 2154) dialogue even contains the phrases ""shock and awe"" and ""daisy cutter"".  While ""American"" is never uttered, every word spoken by an evil ""human"" was in an ""American"" accent.

The Blue People were so preposterously pure and the (American accent) earthlings so preposterously wicked. The whole tale was so simplistic, as events in history never are.

It's essentially a remake of ""Dances With Wolves"" and every other movie where the evil Americans terrorize the indigenous natives, kill them, take their land, and are just all around imperialistically wicked and inhumane.  Oh, and we're destroying the environment, clearing precious giant trees and natural landscapes and killing rare animals and their habitats, in order to invade and harvest valuable substances under the ground.  Sound familiar?

A left-leaning Hollywood movie: no surprise there. So Third Worlders will eat it up. The Iranians, for example, should love ""Avatar"" if, of course, their government would let them see it, which surely won't happen.

Hopefully in the up comming movie, 'Man Conquers Space' the politics will be more subdued.

The scenes with Jake and Neytiri running, climbing and flying on the Ikrans was breath taking! For me, the scenes in the Hallelujah Mountains alone were worth the price of the rental. The background music was wonderful as well!  If only Mr. Cameron would've made the movie as a sort of modern technical `Fantasia'  without any talking! The dialogue was weak. At some points it was laughable. The characters were blatantly one dimensional. The Stephen Lang character was a parody of himself! Sigourney's  character was consistently irritating. Also, it seems to me that a large portion of these Amazon reviews seem to be people falling into queues behind those who espouse Mr. Cameron's world view (or more specific his view of western society and religion), and those who don't. That's the central `vibe' I'm getting in reading these reviews. As far as the movie itself, I thought it was a movie worthy of the money it made at the box office. Visually, like I said earlier, it was amazing and cutting edge as Mr. Cameron's work always is (technically speaking). Avatar is eye candy;  amazing to watch and a joy to my visual artistic sensibilities. However, I completely understand why it didn't win the Best Picture Oscar. (The `Hurt Locker' at least was fair in it's portrayal of soldiers and showed  multi dimensional characters).  Like many reviewers, I didn't find the Avatar story to be too original. But, I guess that itself isn't why I'm giving it three stars.  Lots of stories, screenplays and movies worth seeing aren't original. They are just good stories that never get old. They aren't overly `preachy'. Avatar unfortunately has a  dogmatic  presence that is too in your face. If would be fine if it were just a generic  good/evil thing like `Lord Of The Rings'. But Cameron identifies evil with/as one specific  thing and benevolent good with the other. War loving U.S. Marines bad; peaceful  benevolent natives good; greedy rich bad; innocent poor good, etc. It's his sermon and he's entitled to it; it's obviously a free country. But personally I think he should stick to his strength (cutting edge technology) and preach less. The sermon (at least to me), is tiresome. I heard it with Dances With Wolves and I really get the message. No need to repeat it. This is basically Dances With Wolves with blue faces on a colorful virgin planet. I half expected Mr. Cameron to have the John Lennon song ""Imagine"" playing during the closing credits....

3932952,5,B002HEXVUI,Avatar arrived quickly and in perfect shape. I could not have known it was a used DVD if I had not known at the time of purchase. Nicely done!,1279670400,,142,3.9310344827586206
3932953,4,B002HEXVUI,"When the first Avatar trailer hit the theaters, I didn't want to see the movie.

Everything they showed during the trailer screamed futuristic Ferngully to me, and I wanted nothing to do with the movie. When it hit theaters, and in the past month, when all of the ""Best movie ever"" hype started, I still had no desire to see this movie. However, I finally said to myself ""Well what the heck, I have gift cards to the movies...it'll be free, and if it sucks, then it sucks.""

Avatar is probably one of the best films I have seen.

While the general plot is nothing new, and you can almost predict certain lines in the film before they happen, the way the story is told and the visual style it's presented in makes this one of the most imaginative movies in the past decade. The movie itself is three hours long, and even though that might seem like a long period of time to tell a basic story, there is so much going on constantly in the world of Pandora that the time will fly by and will leave you wanting more.

Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a wheelchair-bound military man who's brother Tom recently passed away. Jake comes to find out that his brother was working on a special genetic military experiment, and that Jake can finish this experiment because they share the same basic DNA. Jake agrees, and gets to travel light years away to the world of Pandora, a world that most people have only heard about. The world of Pandora is inhabited by the Na'vi, a blue cat-like race who live within the lush jungles of the planet. Upon arrival, Jake finds out that he's involved in the ""Avatar"" program, a program that lets you control a Na'vi looking creation, who's made out of both your own and Na'vi DNA.

Jake meets Norm Spellman (Joel Moore), the other new recruit for the avatar program, and the two meet the other doctors on the project; Grace Augustine (Sigorney Weaver) and Max Patel (Dileep Rao). Grace is the head of the science aspect of this project, and she's working towards making a peaceful connection with the Na'vi. This is imporant, because the reason the humans are on Pandora, is to mine Unobtainium (good name!), a super precious ore that's worth millions to corporations on Earth, and the cure for the energy crisis that Earth is facing. The Resources Development Administration, led by Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribis), is the group that's facilitating all of the mining and interaction between Earth/Pandora/Humans/Na'vi. Along with Parker, there's also Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who is extremely military-minded, and wants to shoot anything that moves, just to help get to the Unobtainium ore.

Colonel Miles pulls Jake aside, and talks to him about helping get the military inside information about the Na'vi, to help their cause. Miles also promises Jake that if he helps with all of the scheming, that Miles can put a word in with the military to help Jake get his legs back again. This all leads to the first conflict in the movie, science/humanity vs military to accomplish the goal of getting the ore from the Na'vi homeland.

As Na'vi Jake (NJ from now on) goes into Pandora for the first time, he has some run-ins with the local animal life, and ends up stranded from his group. He eventually gets left behind, and has to fend for himself during the night. Trouble starts, and NJ is attacked by what look like zombie dogs, only to be saved at the last second by Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a young Na'vi girl. After saving NJ, Neytiri yells at him for the fact that the dogs had to die, and that everything on their planet deserves to live. As they talk, Neytiri receives a sign from Ewya (the spirit of mother nature) that NJ has a warm heart, and is there to help them. She takes him back to Hometree (their home city), and introduces the Na'Vi tribe to him, including her arranged husband Tsu'Tey, and her parents Eytukan (dad) and Mo'at (mom). Neytiri tells everyone about how NJ is there to help them, and to understand the ""sky people"", and that she wants to train him to be a Na'vi. The elders reluctantly agree, and this starts conflict two in the movie : Jake's allegiance to the Na'vi vs his allegiance to the humans.

Without discussing more of the plot, anyone can see where this movie is heading. Will Jake help the humans or help the Na'vi? Will the brute force approach accomplish things, or will peaceful democracy get the humans what they need. These are the two ""main"" conflicts in the movie, but as the film progresses, there are multiple smaller storylines that appear, and the conclusion to each of the smaller stories are just as important as the main conclusion to the film.

The grand story is simple yet robust, with a twist here and there about what you might think is about to happen, but it's nothing over the top or outlandish. There are ""slow"" times in this film, where it's just random conversations, or training montages, but as a whole it all works well together.

One of the weird concepts that appeared since this movie came out is Pandora Depression, where there's apparently groups of people who are sad and depressed that Pandora isn't a real world. I don't know if this is a testament to how realistic the graphics have become in films (or this one specifically), or if people just get really hyped up about movies, but it's interesting that people seem to be so engrossed in this film that this ""condition"" is even any part of reality in 2010. I don't remember ever hearing anyone having issues with The Shire not being real, or not being able to fight with lightsabers when LotR/StarWars came out, so who knows what future films will bring us as digital films become more and more realistic.

Overall (and once again), this is a movie that NEEDS to be seen. There are a lot of movies that evoke small emotions from things happening, whether it be happy, sad, etc, but this movie will leave you emotionally drained by the end of it. I was so engrossed in the story, that even though the movie was three hours long, I never noticed how long I was in the seat.

Also, this movie is now stated to be part of a trilogy, and god I hope so, because if there's more to this world, and they can keep up both the story quality and visual quality, I can't wait to see it.",1279670400,,6246,4.561998215878679

Ok, I was disappointed in this film. I didn't care about the alien race at all, their stupid tree house, or their tree of souls. (I would've shot a nuke at those) Visually it looks nice, as expected it should, it did have the largest ever budget, right? I didn't like the classic GI Joe Army dude, the crippled marine jerk, or the modern day Jurassic park jungle. The ""love story"" w/-in the film was dumb too. After watching this it doesnt surprise me that it lost to Hurt Locker at the oscars.

I like the beauty of Earth much better, ""pandora"" just seems too artificial/unbelivable. Floating mountains? ...really? So where are the unicorns and my lucky charm leprechaun? Apparently it is a black light glow party every night there, I get this is science fiction- Cameron just went over the top w/ it IMO. It's also predictable, for example, you know the main character is going to fly that mega red bird at some point, that he's going to fight back against the big bad American force and prevail, and that the alien girl will meet the real jake sully. The length is a bit much too I felt. It doesn't have much beyond some very expensive slick visuals & the battle scenes were few and not very impressive either. What's w/ the squid like pony tail tips? gross. He didn't actually say that metal they wanted was un-obtain-ium did he?

3932968,3,B002HEXVUI,"I wouldn't say it sucked, but it is definitely over-rated.

While obviously the graphics are nice, and much of the art direction was at least interesting, the story itself was so average as to be laughable.

There are so many little ""are you kidding me?"" moments that it's kind of pathetic... for example: When you name your ""unobtainable"" metal ""unobtanium"" you show no respect for your viewing audience. That's the kind of gimmick name that could have been used as a ""nickname"" for the metal, but should have been laughed out of the writers room as a serious suggestion.

Or let's see... he meets the very first alien... well of course its the princess of the tribe.. and of course they are forced to work together and of course they fall in love... I think anyone over the age of 12 has seen this story at least a dozen times.

Now don't get me wrong, I don't regret watching it, it was nice to see once and eat some popcorn, but it's a fluff movie that doesn't deserve tons of repeat viewing or anywhere near the praise it's been getting. I have 1000 DVD's on my movie wall, most of them are at least as good or better than this run of the mill sci fi knock off.

The fans of this movie are named well, they proudly call themselves ""avatards"" and yea, you pretty much have to be a 'tard to consider this film more than average.

And one more warning: They are milking the DVD releases for everything they can get, there's going to be at least 3 versions out in the coming year (bare bones theatrical, special extended edition, ultimate edition with extras....) and that's just the 3 I know of (oh and plus the blue ray, etc versions). So if you do bother buying the movie, be VERY careful you know which version you want or you will end up not only investing in an average movie, but you'll end up buying it multiple times just to get everything that should have been included in the first release.

For me, I'll buy it used out of the $2.99 bin at my local block buster, because that's all it's worth to me.",1279411200,3,2012,4.349333333333333
3932969,5,B002HEXVUI,"With nearly 1,500 reviews having been posted to date, perhaps everything has already been said about this movie.  Nevertheless, I'd like to add my voice to help give this movie the praise it deserves, and to counter the negative reviewers, who are apparently in a mood to be hypercritical, are right-wing hardliners, and/or are inappropriately rating the Blu-Ray package rather than the movie itself.

For me, this movie goes well beyond simply being a movie.  Rather, it's like a voyage to another world which is, at the same time, oddly familiar.  True, many of the characters are closer to caricatures, but that approach works in this movie because it brings into focus the distinct messages of each character, and the characters together cover a reasonably diverse spectrum of types.  In other words, the elements of this movie are simple, but they're woven together in a complex way which is emotionally powerful and thematically profound.  In particular, the theme which jumped out to me most prominently was the overt similarity to the culture, spirituality, and history of the Native Americans (and other indigenous groups around the world), except that the Native Americans obviously met with a much sadder ending.  To the extent that viewers missed this theme (very few reviews mention it), that's an unfortunate reflection of our society's lack of knowledge regarding both history and the oppression and exploitation going on in the world today.

On a more technical note, of course the tremendous visuals and special effects are vital to making this voyage possible.  The Blu-Ray is excellent in this regard, with a clarity and vividness which almost surpasses reality, but seeing the movie in 3D in the theater is also an experience not to be missed.

Needless to say, I very highly recommended this movie.  This is one of only a handful of movies that I've ever purchased rather than rented.  Cynics will point to the amount of profit this movie is generating but, in this case, it's arguably well deserved.",1279411200,3,2021,5.036036036036036

3932974,3,B002HEXVUI,"I think the only real reason this movie was such a big hit was i assume for its 3d effects in the movies (i did not see it in 3d and don't entirely care too as i hate most 3d movies in that they always have stuff flying at your face).

For all of its effects it story is pretty basic and to be honest it seems to more like a childrens film in plot and depth but also in a ""grown up way"" by using in my opinion unnecessary swearing and such.  The story while interesting in places and the theme of fighting for your land is nice it lacks any real depth.  It does not feel as epic as the lord of the rings movies did.  The animation and scenery is nice but nothing i haven't seen in games like Final Fantasy 13!

I was kind of expecting a little more.  at least titanic had a bit of depth to it.  This movie just feels rather shallow (and by depth i don't mean 3d depth i mean plot / character wise)

I think to be honest it seems the 3d visuals must have taken center stage vs actual real depth to the movie itself which is kind of a shame.

Its a interesting watch through but i woudnt buy it to see it again.  Also because of the laungauge its not really appropriate for young children which is a shame. if they had cut out the unnecessary cursing it could have been a movie for the whole family.

as it ends up feeling more in the end like a kids movie with cursing instead of an epic movie for adults!

One possible benefit is that CG SFX and trite cliches have been taken about as far as they can go as a cover for lack of substance. People will only sink their teeth into wax fruit so many times.

3932984,5,B002HEXVUI,"I just treated myself to watching the movie on pay Cable and I'll admit it took several previews before I took the plundge to actually pay $3.99 for it.

I was fascinated by the multi-legged horses,and wild animals. How cool to fly a dragon and am fascinated by Pandora's evolution of the other creatures but I have to admit, any large creature with more than four legs and more than two eyes is creepy. If one does a search on Pandora you can get a great feel of what the planet is in terms of flora and fauna, the atomosphere composition, even why the mountains float. Some sort of magnetic thing with that rock everyone was so greedy for. What a fascinating bit of Na'vi evolution to have those tendrils at the ends of their braided queus that makes the bond with their four-winged, four-eyed dragon Ikran and their six-legged, four-eyed Direhorses. Some laugh at that. But those wiggly tendrils are an extention of the Na'vi nervous system which is no more unnatural than an earthling psychic who can draw impressions out of the air.

The Na'vi language too is fascinating developed by a linguist whose as fluent in it as many onliners who take the constructed language very seriously. One day I hope to master it. I've only mastered four words to date.

I don't know what this tree hugging crap I hear a lot people harping about. Understanding nature and trying to preserve it thus preserving your own survival isn't tree hugging environmentalist nonsense. One thing out of balance the rest falls apart.

The main characterizations are brilliant. We have Segourney Weaver who finally comes off as someone whose not an iceberg. She evolves enough to respect Jake Sully rather than considering him an idiot. She appreciates the gifts Pandora has, though ignorant in thinking the Military really cares about her research. She's believable as a scientist.

We have her assistant whose nerdy enough to be a scientist though looks a little odder as an Avatar.

We have that ignorant little dweeb who thinks he's in charge of everything who ignorantly thinks of the Na'vi as ""blue monkeys"", has contempt for Pandora's nature and can't grasp the fact that the planet is a neural network.

We have the Military General whose not overpoweringly evil but looks the part. I naturally didn't like him before he said a word.

We have Jake Sully who first follows orders but changed and for the better. He found a purpose. I loved his ""Jarhead clan"" line. I think he was cuter as an Avatar.

Then we have the Na'vi who aren't uncivilized barbarians but know and love the land because they're literally connected by their braided queus that makes ""the bond"" with animals and the Tree of Voices and even see tree seeds as ""pure spirits"". The Na'vi are a gentle people until you mess with them.

Yes, the story of Avatar is an old recycled one. But in this movie the  Na'vi are not only the good guys but unlike the classic cowboy and Indian theme, you get equal time with the natives. They're developed. You learn some of their ways. You hear their beautiful language. Maybe loving the land instead of exploiting it to ruin is considered tree hugging political nonsense by some, but  if you're a Na'vi lover which I am, you can't help but respect these peoples' love of the land. They fight to preserve what they have and although they suffered greatly, they refused to give in. They're the 'Indians' who finally won instead of always being portrayed as the consummate losers which is a twist on the old theme.

Granted Avatar is the kind of film that either grows on you or not. But to me, this movie has some imagination for once. It's deeper than Star Wars, it's not the constant blood and guts  of Alien whose body count is the theme, it's not a let's hunt you down for sport like Predator. Avatar is thought provoking, the special effects are brilliant that add not destract.

I would have re-written things alot so that there was a win-win for both sides.

Okay, it's not IMAX and 3D, but having the DVD on a large plasma at home, assuming you have a decent sound system, can pull you into the magic on an even more intimate level. The giant theater screen, while very involving, is overwhelming. Now you notice more of the peripheral details. You can switch on the captioning to catch dialog you missed. You can zoom, reverse, and other stuff to enhance understanding of the faster action sequences. Best of all, since it's a LONG movie, you can pause to potty.

The movie is so awesome, especially with its visual effects that will blow you away. Its story is really touching, as it makes you open your mind and eyes to understand the unique culture of the other side.

It's almost the similar metaphor of Native Hawaiians and Americans in Hawai`i. The Native Hawaiians still cherish their traditional language, cultural food, customs, and their rich history that spanned from King Kamehameha the Great to Queen Lili`uokalani. However, back in the 1800s (no offenses here), the Americans stressed to convert the Hawaiian government to switch and comply the American government through agreement with King Kamehameha III, changing the lives of Native Hawaiians, and overthrew Queen Lili`uokalani, which ended the traditional Hawaiian monarchy.

However the Oscars has a long tradition of often awarding things in their own way or honoring something else entirely by giving out their Best Picture. So not to say Foot Locker didn't deserve consideration but I for one do not approve of war movies for money during time of war. So no matter how well done it was it didn't have my vote for Best Picture. And no I didn't see it...that would make me a hypocrite. Maybe in 20 years I'll be able to bring myself to see it...then perhaps not....it took me more than 20 years to be able to watch the Mash series via DVD

2.  I love action flicks.
3.  But I do like movies that have at least a decent script, that are well written and are well acted.  This movie has got to be one of the most over hyped  and over-rated movies of all time.  First of all, the whole storyline is... just dumb.  Second:  the acting is just lame.  Third:  you are constantly exposed to Cameron's whacked out leftist philosophy.  Fourth:  You put all of those factors together and you have a film that is frankly boring.  I just couldn't wait for this dud to end.
4.  Bottomline: this movie once again proves that a great movie is not based on special effects.  The old fundamentals of solid writing and acting is always going to be the underlying factors of whether or not a movie is a dud (as in this case) or a masterpiece.  The only thing more depressing than this movie is the thought of all those people walking around out there, who actually think this is anything more than a 1-2 star movie.

When I watch this story I felt like I was watching a 1990 western illustrating how badly the Indians were treated over 100 years ago and other similar stories. This movie was so predictable that to me it was a rerun.  Almost all the technical details was left out to explain why humans were still living under a military rule and the only way to solve a problem is to kill all the men involved.  I did notice that when they went into battle all the women from earth seem to disappear.  So, I give this movie a 1 star because of the amazing special effects.

3933023,3,B002HEXVUI,"I don't know that I'd ever get AVATAR on DVD because, for me, the best part of the film was watching it on an IMAX screen in 3-D.

If I didn't have the inspiring special effects to distract me from the storyline, I don't think I'd enjoy the movie as much.  It has more-than-enough imagination to set the story up...but I wish James Cameron would turn to experienced writers for the script the way he turns to experienced sfx people to shoot the movie.

My biggest pet peeve is that this villains are always too over-the-top.  In TITANIC, Billy Zane's dastardly character should've worn a black stovepipe hat and a Snidely Whiplash moustache.  In AVATAR, the badly-scarred Colonel comes across like the most extreme military caricature.  He has no reason, he has no understandable motives in the latter part of the film so he can just completely embody the Bad Guy.

My friends derisively refer to this film as DANCES WITH SMURFS or PLANET OF THE GRAPES.  If the story had a little more depth to it, I don't think they'd be able to say that.  And Cameron now has the two top grossing motion pictures of all time, so nobody can take that away from him.

3933026,4,B002HEXVUI,"First at all it's useless to say the future has never been synonymous of progress for many. The great illusion of the progress, so in vogue at the beginning of the Revolution Industrial, seems to be a dark twilight, an endless night according this vision.

James Cameron directed Terminator I and II too, which it reaffirms by itself, the pessimistic shadows of territorial voracity, oppression without limits as well an insatiable appetite for the natural resources.

The first genial thinker who threw his hat to ring was Aldous Huxley with ""A brave new world"" in the late twenties, thereafter - two decades later  - Orwell would publish 1984.

In the cinema, the sixties showed us the cult masterwork ""La jete"" directed by Chris Maker who encouraged to Gilliam (who previously had shocked the entire world with his futuristic nightmare ""Brazil"") to make ""Twelve monkeys.""

In the late sixties, the monumental ""A space odyssey"" and ""The planet of the apes"" paved the way for other dark films like ""Solaris"", ""Capricorn one"", ""Soylent Green"", ""THX 1138"" and ""Altered states"" during the seventies.

During the eighties nineties, the ring became present again when films like the two sagas of ""Terminator"", ""Twelve monkeys"", ""Gattaca"", ""Dark city"" and the cult movie ""Matrix"" would add its contribution about the unerring statement that we are not living in the best of the possible worlds.

At the eve of this new century, came the famous ""Mononoke Princess""  a very clever project inscribed into the ""Japanese anime wave"", that in more than an aspect seemed to have inspired to Cameron to undertake a very similar idea with ""Avatar"", whose stylized feature simply overwhelms the most indifferent viewer through its undeniable technological advances.

A crippled man gets involved though a witty system of neuronal connection with the outside world in order to be part of a curious tribal society, who is deeply committed with the natural tenets but mostly with its invaluable elements. Obviously, the film is permeated of a profound mythical gaze, which is by far its main virtue and strength.

A memorable cult movie which through its bitter warning, got engaged the rest of the world.

The close resemblance with ""Mononoke Princess"" is what it avoids me to give five stars.",1277683200,,2276,5.075067024128686
3933027,2,B002HEXVUI,"Honestly there is not much to say about it. I think that visually and in a way ""spiritually"" the film was beautiful. But the story was one and the same - Godless jaded humans destroying everything for money and resources as it has always done - and one guy chooses to see the other side and fight for them. It's very Dances with Wolves, Last of the Mohicans, The Last Samurai, The Mission - you name it, it's been done before. Only I think Avatar made it worst - because all it did is focus on war on both ends. How about a little more cultural writing eh? We learned nothing about those ""people"" other than they could fly and hunt, sing and pray really well.

The technology in this film is kick ass though. One of the things I found funny is that with all that ""technology"" for the characters (not the technology used in the film) they couldn't give the dude a more state of the art wheel chair?

And would it have killed the writers to add some more evolved lines and characters: ""choose a woman"" Seriously? Grow the hell up boys.

At least Sam Worthington was not nearly as bad as I thought he was going to be. I refused to see this film in the theaters and frankly I don't regret it. I don't think I missed much.

I don't think any of the lines were memorable and we have seen this story before.... many times. As one critic put it, it's ""Dancing with wolves in outer space.""

3933039,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is a spectacular film. The way it's directed, written, and cast is phenomenal.
Many are very annoyed that it came out without and bonus material. But it's alright.
I would suggest ordering this one so you have the original version. The version that is due to come out later this year is going to be extended with new footage and extra material. I purchased this set and I am planning to buy the new one as well.
When James Cameron's Titanic was released on DVD, it too came out with just the film. But then came out again with a new edition that had extended scenes and even new one. There were still even deleted scenes after the extension.

I still must say that you need you get this version. This version is now a limited time offer.

Plus, if Cameron releases Avatar like he did with Titanic, it could get pricy. Titanic came out in a $60 set when it was rereleased. So, you may not even have the money to get it. That's why I suggest getting this one now just in case.

Thanks for reading. Please don't post rude comments, because this is my opinion. Except it really is just a limited time only so BUY SOON!!",1277424000,4,1122,4.308056872037914

When Avatar was first released, I thought the commercials were compelling, but the hype turned me off.  As a result, I did not see the film in the theatres.

When the movie came out on DVD, I decided I needed to see it and decide for myself if the hype was worth it.  Live and learn.  I was blown away!  This was the most visually stunning film I have ever seen, and yet the plot, characters, and conflicts were equally stunning.  It makes me wish I had see the film in the theatrs to get the full experience in large scale.

It's true that this edition does not contian any special features.  But, the quality of the DVD and the joy of owning the film itself is not diminished by this.  Some people may want to wait for future editions of the DVD, but I am perfectly happy just being able to watch this film over and over again.  After all, the real reason to buy a DVD is to own the film - the special features are just an added bonus.

This is a popcorn movie so cmon don't be so bitchy people. A great film destined to become a legend in the history of filmdom.

I almost jumped out of my seat and cheered when he got strapped into his robot suit and jumped out of the exploding ship.  That was phenomenal.  Everything he said was cool to infinity and beyond.  When he ran outside to shoot as they were escaping from the base and he was holding his breadth and firing the gun?  Didn't you wish he'd nailed the ship and it fireballed down in blaze?  I know I did.  I sure wish he wouldn't have bit the dust at the end 'cause he definitly would have enhenced the sequal.

3933073,1,B002HEXVUI,"Good Points
1)The special effects are great.
2)Although forgettable the music works with the setting.
3)The art direction was cool.

Bad Points
1)The script sucked.
2)The acting sucked.
3)The politics are as subtle as a fully loaded freight train hitting you at top speed.

The next section will have what some may consider spoilers so sorry if I ruin anything.

4)Cameron was a nice guy and allowed someone who needed extra credit in remedial English, middle school level, create the story. While nice of him it does make the story unenjoyable. At the very least a little background on why unobtainium was so darned valueable would be nice. Sure humanity as waged war and destroyed other cultures for minerals but at least we know the reason why those minerals were valuable. In Avatar there is no reason given for why humanity needs unobtainium. As an aside I realize that my grammar sucks as does my general writing abilities.
5)It was much too long for the story told. The story begins with natives who live in harmony with nature and evil outsiders who are willing to destroy everything for a valuable rock. In order to interact easier with natives,I guess it might also be easier to work the environment,  the evil corparation created avatars that a mix of native and human DNA.One of the outsiders is converted to natives side while working as a double agent for the big bad leader of the soldiers for hire. Others side with the natives, people who you expect die, and the natives led by the converted outsider drives off the bad outsiders. Roll the end credits. I just summed up the ""plot"" of Avatar. The movie runs for,I think, 2 and half hours with this basic plot.
6)The way the aliens ""bond"" with well everything on Pandora has a sightly creepy sexually dominance feel to it. Although it might be the only remotely creative aspect in the story it still is somewhat disturbing.
End of any Spoilers.

It makes me glad that I wasted my money on the cheap no frills DVD edition instead of the full featured special edition. It does make me wonder if the missing footage holds the good acting and a half-way decent plot twist though.",1276732800,11,2140,4.680851063829787

3933075,5,B002HEXVUI,"Outstanding movie. On my list of favorites.
The visuals are a delight, there are clear villains and heroes (keeps the cheering simplified) and the story line is complex enough to be interesting but not so complex you get lost in subplots. Overall, a treat for the whole family.",1276560000,6,277,4.791666666666667
3933076,5,B002HEXVUI,"Imagine a film about a greedy, ruthless corporation--one which treats its own workers like expendable pawns--which brings about an unprecedented ecological disaster.  Sound timely?  Yeah, this is NOT a biography of BP and the gulf oil spill, this is the plot of Avatar, so it's eerily striking that the film was released in the year before the gulf oil spill.

I did NOT watch this film in the theatre so I have not seen the 3-D experience, but this WAS the film that pushed 3-D over the top commercially.  It was such a phenomenon that several TV manufacturers are releasing 3-D capable hardware (initial price range around $3000) and various media content producers are making plans for 3-D content, so in a couple years you may see a lot of DVDs (and movies, and TV) with 3-D capability.

I don't want to dwell at length on the plot.  One viewer (who didn't much care for the film) said it was like Dances with Wolves set on another planet.  Seeing the movie, this made sense.  It's set in a future when humanity has developed space flight.  No faster than light ""warp drive"" or anything--it takes years to reach the nearest stars, but exploration has revealed a very earthlike planet within reach.  More important, it has a very precious resource not found on earth.  Exactly what it's supposed to be made of and what it's used for were not fleshed out in the movie.  It's dubbed ""unobtainium"" and it looks like a metallic ore of some sort.  The problem is that creating large strip-mines also inconveniently means ripping up the planet's ecosystem and even killing the native Na'vi, a tall, slender but strong, blue-skinned humanoid race that live in harmony with their world (the way American Indians are portrayed as living more in harmony with the earth than the white settlers, in Dances With Wolves).  As the film launches, a practical-scientific experiment is underway (here, it starts getting more far-fetched) in which bodies are grown with human donor DNA combined with native Na'vi DNA--then the human DNA donor is supposed to be able to ""connect"" with the brain of the resulting body, and therefore live in and travel around the world without special breathing gear--the goal being to find a way to convince the Na'vi to move off an especially large deposit of ""unobtainium""--else the company will simply bulldoze right over them.  This large deposit is inconveniently right under a major home for the Na'vi people.  Our heroes, of course, end up siding with the Na'vi and against the corporation...

Almost all the movie is computer-generated (there are probably a few sets, like insides of buildings and ships that had some real backgrounds, but all the outdoor stuff was computer-generated, as were the Na'vi) and ONCE AGAIN, like with Star Wars back in the day, like with the Lord of the Rings films, and like with Ironman on Blu-Ray--this film marks a new pinnacle in computer-generated film footage.  Even without 3-D,but with the high-def available on a good Blu-Ray system, this picture is DROP DEAD GORGEOUS--easily the most beautiful DVD film I have seen on a home system to date.  I think I can get a feel for what the 3-D version might be like, just watching the film on Blu-ray, which just seem sharper and more real and more beautiful than any other CG stuff on DVD before.

Yes, everyone's complaining that the studio released a ""bare bones"" version here--no special features.  Yes, the studio is going to milk the film to the max: a re-release in theatre, followed by at least one more DVD release (actually I'm betting that over the life of this product there will be at least 2 more DVD versions).  It doesn't matter.  If you haven't seen the film in the theatre (like me), you're still gonna love it on DVD.  You'll love it even more in 3-D, I'm sure.  In the meantime, this still makes a helluva present for just about anyone who ever watches a sci-fi film.  It's quite suitable for older kids, teens and adults.",1276473600,4,3948,4.752199413489736

3933084,1,B002HEXVUI,"If all you are interested in is special effects and shoot-um-up action, then this is the movie for you.  However, if you want even a hint of a good plot and characters then this movie is VERY lacking.  Avatar has outstanding special effects but absolutely nothing more.  Beyond the special effects are a bunch of stale, over-used predictable plot lines with a bunch of stale, over-used predictable characters.  You had the crusty, cantankerous scientist with a heart of gold, and the unfeeling corporate executive only interested in profits.  The leading male played by Sam Worthington was a poorly rehashed Rambo.  But the worst was the Marine commander who I dub Colonel Cliche.

The basic story line of the movie was very good and Avatar actually started out pretty good up to and including the scene where Sam Worthington's character was rescued by Zoe Saldana's character.  After that it was just one moronic, predictable cliche after another.

Some of the action was beyond ridiculous.  One of the gun boat pilots didn't like the mission and deserted the battle scene and no disciplinary action happened to her.  You even see her a few scenes later helping in the jail break, which itself was inane.  Two people go into the prison pretending to deliver food, overpower the one and only guard, hit a couple of buttons (not even a password was needed) and the prisoner is gone.  Even 18th century jails had better security.  I could go on and on, but you get my point.

If you look beyond the special effects this movie was AWFUL.  Now days it seems that Hollywood too often uses special effects to cover up bad acting, bad directing and bad writing, and Avatar is a prime example of this.",1276387200,15,1693,4.7465753424657535

3933086,5,B002HEXVUI,"I find it amazing that so many of the people who reviewed this disc whined about it having no ""extras"". I buy a disc because I want to watch the movie and enjoy it, over and over. I have no interest whatsoever in all the extras, deleted scenes, commentaries, interviews, bells, whistles, fireworks, violins, etc. that clutter up most movie discs today.  That is all nothing but an excuse that the studios can use to double the price of the disc and they do nothing to enhance the enjoyment of the film. This disc was fine for the purpose of anyone who wants to enjoy the film. What is even better is that even though it reads as ""widescreen"" it was put out in an aspect ratio that makes it fill virtually the entire screen of your tv set.  I throughly detest the ""widescreen"" format that leaves you watching a movie that fills the center third of your screen, with huge black blocks at top and bottom.  What, exactly, is the point of buying giant big screen tv's when movie discs leave one third of your screen blank at the top and another third blank at the bottom, leaving you to watch a movie squeezed into the middle of your screen?  I was not able to see Avatar in the theaters, so I wanted to see it at home. And when I did I was enchanted. The fantasy world of Pandora is utterly breath-taking, with colors so vivid you wonder if you ever saw real color before this. Cameron has done it again; someday the film world will stop doubting him. Bigger, better, more amazing, more entertaining, he does it all. Film reviewers keep grouching that his characters are steriotypes, his dialogue clunky----but I think I am sensing sour grapes here. I think all the critics wish that they could have made a movie that was not only marvelous, but made so much money it is unbelieveable. As for steriotypes? Did you ever wonder why something is a steriotype? Mostly because it is a character that speaks deeply to people, and is very, very popular.  The story of Avatar is that of a weary hero, very much abused and alone, finding himself willing to risk everything, even his chance at a new life, for a girl, a people and a world he has come to love. The hero that stands against great odds, to defend what is right, is an eternal figure. He has existed in every time, land and race since humanity began to dream. Humanity needs such heros, real or fictional. We all wish we could be such heros. The filming of Avatar is ground breaking, the story ideas interesting, the visual effect gorgeous.  You fly with dragons, run through giant forests, fight enemies, find love, taste disaster and triumph.  The basic story is simple---but all the very best stories are.  Especially the ones that last. As I think this one will.  So get this disc, enjoy the movie, the adventure and the beauty. It is a fantastic ""feel good"" film. And there's not a damned thing wrong with that as far I can see.",1276387200,74,2882,4.453510436432637
3933087,1,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar etc.

I have seen Alien by Ridley Scott and Avatar by Cameron.  The first movie Alien was pretty good but only near the end.  The final scene was quite poetic.  Watching Sigourney Weaver push the creature out of the ship was done in a fairly slow but peaceful way.  One couldn't feel anything but entranced by that scene.  Avatar was pretty predictable and didn't take much mental prowess to understand.  It had no real way to make you become interested in it. It was supposed to be a 3-D film.  The past of 3D films has not been very filled with quality.  They have always been more involved with wowing the viewer with images popping out of the screen and making the film maker look like some kind of innovator.  Real innovation is when the director and writers present a new way to look at humanity.

Avatar was nothing like the great movies of Bergman who understood humanity and its various twists and turns.  He had no need for huge production budgets.  One movie I did see from last year is Precious.  This movie far outshone Avatar.  The movie involved us as humans to care about someone.  The main character in this movie showed her ability to shine even though the main people in her life tried to drag her down. The resolve of Precious at the end movie leaves you feeling good about her.",1276387200,3,1305,4.466101694915254

3933095,1,B002HEXVUI,"So apparantely James Cameron hasn't rebounded from his catatonic state that produced Titanic. He is still the dead minded hollywood director that spends his days at the chateau marmont in North Hollywood with all the other crappy hollywood directors, contemplating how they can further foul american cinema. From what i read Cameron had been working on this script since the 90s. My, to think that all that work from a previously brilliant director would amount to nothing more than the screenplay from Pochahantas is a savage blow to any hope for American cinema. What happened Cameron? you were once so talented and resourceful. Aliens and Terminator (1 and 2 that is) were fantastic films with original plots and interesting characters. You basically took a giant dump, photocopied it, ran it through a projection reel, and played it back to us in 3D. Thanks a lot. I hope the money this movie grossed, which is barok and disgusting to say the least, will more than cover the Kinkos visit and the repairs to the copier after you defocated on it.

Now for a play by play description of Cameron's political motives in this movie. Cameron is evidently a rabid enviromentalist, possibly a peta terrorist, that decided he wanted animate and put his political views in 3D and accompany them with cat like blue people, there is a reason these creatures resemble cats, and a barely plausible script. The movie is full of nausea inducing music and lets-get-this-over-with acting. I had no idea Michelle Rodriguez was qualified to act. Did Cameron find her at one of his pro-illegal immigration, anti american rallies?

Back to the cat people. Cameron wanted to make sure there was no room for skepticism of his political views so he made the ""natives"" look as nice as possible. Puppy dog eyes, cat like features, and a tail ensure that the audience will love them on sight without any coaxing needed. Once you have the audience on your side you can then make them hate whatever modern establishment you want by simply making them the bad guys and ploying them against your cat people. Marines have been the long running bad guys in American cinema since ""Full metal Jacket"". They serve in this movie as the henchmen of greedy corporate interests. Hmmmm...how very original. There is no attempt at giving any of the marines including their stereotypical commander any depth, and why should there be? We are supposed to hate them! Whereas the ""natives"" are portrayed as peace loving, one-with-nature, perfect beings that the marines, and their corporate sponsors, just have to destroy. apparently the humans in the future act much like humans in the 18th century, at least according to cameron.

If i had made this movie i would have made it like Last of the Mohicans, a brilliant film by the still brilliant Michael Mann. Mann gave his characters depth, did not try to indoctrinate his audience, an made an original screenplay. The British were not the supreme evil, nor were the natives, nor were the french. they all had their faults and one was not superior to the other. There was no political statement being made just a good work of American cinema. District 9 remains the superior sci fi film of this year. Sure district 9 had a political message but it wasn't bashing you over the head with it's simplicity and the characters had depth and were interesting.

My only hope is that Cameron will either rebound or just retire from film making. He is past his prime and obviously cant recover.",1276214400,5,3490,4.831103678929765
3933096,5,B002HEXVUI,"I didn't get to see Avatar in the theaters and now I wish I had.  It is a lush and amazing film filled with the latest in technological developments. Also, it has a decent story line. Yes the story line is so linear that you can see it coming like a truck on the highway but it is still an enjoyable ride. The characters are from the cliche handbook but even so this movie is about having fun and should be recognized for that.

I also enjoy the fact that not all the humans are so simplistic and that the battle scenes are so rich and deep that you have doubts as to how it will end, even when you know exactly how it will end.  The technology is the star here so lets face that.  Even saying that, there have been plenty of live action movies where the script and acting have been far, far worse than anything seen here.

3933120,5,B002HEXVUI,"After reading all the pathetic blathering and petty drivel about what this DVD release lacks...no extra features, no 3D effects, etc., I felt compelled to write my own review here so that people can learn a bit about the -MOVIE-.  Perhaps this is a perspective thing...I hadn't seen the movie so I got this -for the movie- and not any extras.  The way a few of the reviews here sound though, it's almost as though a great many people have forgotten what ""entertainment"" actually is.  -If- your primary concern with buying a DVD is simply extra features and ""fluff"", then no...that's not in this release and you can clearly read about that in others reviews.  If your only entertainment concern is having the best, latest, greatest technology such as a 3D television...well...that's not here either.  However if you're simply looking for a truly -great- movie with captivating characters, wonderful visual effects and a really strong environmental message to boot, then please read on...

Ok...unlike a others here, again I had never seen this movie in the theaters.  In fact, I hadn't even heard of it until the McD's kid's meals started featuring the toys!  Even as I stood there inserting the DVD in to the player, I didn't even know that Sigourney Weaver was in it (which was a very pleasant surprise)...that's how little I knew about this flick before hand!  I honestly wasn't sure what to expect.  That said, last night made the -3rd time- I've watched this movie in just over 1 week.  This is simply a truly outstanding flick, hands down!  I'll try not to spoil too much of the actual plot for you but essentially this is a Sci-Fi flick that is a combination of live action and some excellent CGI. In a rather small nut shell, the time frame is ""some time in the distant future"" where humans have started to explore space and colonize other planets.  In this case, a base has been set up on a very distant planet (actually in the early sequences, it looks more like a moon in orbit around a large, Jupiter like gas giant) known as ""Pandora"" which was intended to apparently be some kind of mining operation.  It seems as though some large Earth corporation is interested in a rare metal which can be found in abundance on this planet called ""Unobtainium"" (and if you think that's cheesy, look it up on Wikipedia!).  The problem is the planet has an indigenous species known as the Na'vi...a 10 foot tall race of blue humanoids who at first appear to be quite primitive.  They live in the trees, they hunt with bows and knives, etc., etc..  What we come to learn is that these people, while they are a tribal like culture, have a strong connection to the planet and all the living things that grow there and they understand the inter-connectivity of all living things on Pandora.  Needless to say the Na'vi want to protect their home.  The Na'vi are not totally dis-similar to tribal people who have actually lived on this planet...people who have been virtually decimated by modernization and so-called progress and the ideology of Western culture.  Imagine the native Americans of this planet before the arrival of the white man...that's the Na'vi, only they're blue and -really- tall.  Pandora is...much as early America was I'm sure...not the most hospitable place at times.  Imagine how a person who had never heard of, let alone seen, lions or rhinos or cheetahs or hyenas would react on their first visit to the Africa Savanna.  The creatures of Pandora are certainly ""alien"" but the idea is the same...most of the wildlife on Pandora isn't exactly ""friendly"".

In an attempt to ""make nice with the locals"", the humans have bio-engineered these ""Avatars""...living beings created from a combination of human and Na'vi DNA.  Humans are put in to these high tech chambers (not dis-similar to a CAT scan or MRI machine) and ""go to sleep"" and when they wake up, they are in their Avatar bodies.  The humans who do this of course are all scientists and such who are trying to understand the people of Pandora, although the ultimate goal of the program is supposedly to negotiate with them in order to get them to relocate so the humans can get the Unobtainium.  That is of course until our main character, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) shows up.  Jake's an x-marine who lost the use of his legs (apparently in combat).  Jake was selected for the program because his twin brother who was a scientist was murdered...since Jake was his identical twin with the same DNA, the powers that be decided to offer him the chance to be part of this program instead.  Of course, Jake has no training and very little understanding of Pandora beyond the legends he's heard on Earth, let alone the Na'vi...or little else really.  He's your basic ""jar head"", except that he's confined to a wheel chair.  Because he is a ""warrior"" however, the Na'vi people accept him...at least more easily than the scientists who have gone before him.  I won't go much more in to it than that as if you haven't seen the movie, there's plenty of spoiler info out there.  However...

This movie has a very strong environmental message.  While it's a great action flick with awesome special effects to be sure, the real meat of this flick is the message that it sends out.  In the time period of the movie, humans have basically ""killed Mother Earth"", much in the same way we are doing today...and now they are looking to do the same on Pandora, all for the sake of ""profit"" (sound disturbingly familiar?).  It addresses that almighty belief that many humans seem to have in that anything and everything is ours to take and destroy as we wish without any thought what so ever to the consequences or how it effects the environment of the creatures (including ""people"") who live there.  With the facts and evidence of global warming here on our own planet quickly becoming indisputable, this is a very timely movie with a very potent message...a message that people should listen to and take to heart.

Even without those DVD extras that some people seem to cherish more than quality entertainment, this is a very strong movie with a very strong statement.  The visual effects are simply breath-taking (even without any bloody 3D!), the characters are engaging and often downright captivating, the music/sound track is very lovely to say the least and the CGI is simply stunning...all and all an excellent flick for everyone in the family (ok...there -is- some mild use of bad language...get over it)!  Seriously, if you've already seen this flick in theaters and you're simply more interested in the extras than the flick itself, then as others have suggested, just wait for the special edition release.  If you're easily offended by someone telling you just how greedy, petty and stupid we humans can be, then don't watch the flick at all.  However if you enjoy -good- entertainment with great action, strong visuals and a tremendous message that all of us could learn from, this is a GREAT flick and the DVD is -well worth the cost- even without any extras...this one get's a solid 5 stars in my book!",1275955200,10,7071,4.7371428571428575

I did not see the theatre 3-D version because I believed the reviews that called the story 'predictable', and said that the 3-D gimmick was the only thing it had going for it. But NOT having seen it in the theatre, I enjoyed the DVD very much. There was enough depth to the motion for me--I did not need creatures appearing to jump out of the screen towards me at my age!

3933131,5,B002HEXVUI,"How does James Cameron make movies with obvious plot and ending (Titanic would inevitably sink and Avatar would help Navi battle the humans and win) and make them so gripping and entertaining?

After watching this movie twice, I am convinced the secret is in the amount of attention paid to the details. It is the amazing voice recordings of Zoe Saldana (leading female character) with perfectly pitched and timed ""hiss"" and primordial yell of ""Eywa has heard you!"" It is a Marine losing his hat because of a wind generated by a helicopter, and the leading character checking the native vegetation with child-like curiosity. When an antagonist kicks a door open, a blast of air is seen.

This movie is like an art. Watching it is a pleasure in its own. The obvious storyline is not a hinderance but only serves to make the audience eagerly anticipate for the next sequence to take hold. Avatar reminds us that it is how well the story is presented and holds our interest with meaningful characters that are most important.

The criticism that this movie has a racial tone (white man comes and saves the helpless indigenous population to overcome their racial limitations) is hardly evident and certainly not central to the story.

A more valid cricism is that this movie has tree-hugging theme in which foul, polluting, and warloving humans destroy nature for the sake of avarice and to fulfill their wanton need to destroy and kill. It is also critical of George W Bush's Iraq policies (antagonists says ""we need to fight terror with terror"" and his strategy is described as ""shock and awe"").

The only thing I didn't really care for were the ""floating mountains"" which blatantly violates the very basic law of physics.

I can see why many people would want to watch this movie more than once. There are hundreds of little worth-noting details that people would miss in the first viewing. You will like this film and probably would want to watch it more than once.",1275868800,,1965,4.781710914454277

I can't say whether or not I would purchase it again for the extra content, I do know that I didn't hesitate to buy this version.  I can appreciate the technology used to make this movie, and I am very interested in future story lines and the rumored prequel novel that Cameron may write.

Not only that, but the integration between the live action and the CGI is really something to see.  It is long.  And I mean this in a good way.  With so many movies clocking in at 90 minutes, its nice to really get some serious bang for your movie(or DVD) buck.  Nearly three hours of top-drawer story telling.  It is a bit preachy.  Evil technology is out to destroy the natural balance.  I'm no tree hugger, by any stretch of the imagination.  That said, you'll be cheering for the indigenous Na'vi, much in the same way that we rooted for the Ewoks back in the day.  This battle is certainly on a much grander scheme.

Adventure, romance, and humor.  The cast is diverse with heroes and villains each playing their part to move the story along.  The movie looks great and sounds amazing.  In case there was any doubt whatsoever, James Cameron has another hit on his hands.",1275609600,,1002,4.544943820224719
3933154,5,B002HEXVUI,"Jim Cameron has made a career of pushing the boundaries of movie making from the first Terminator, to Congo to Titanic to Independance day.  He set a new standard with Avatar.  The 3D version of the movie is nothing short of stunning, in the same league as the opening scenes of the first Star Wars movie (now number IV: A New Hope).  Even in 2D, the strength of the underlying story and production values come through.  The movie is visually stunning.  Scientists need to leave their critic lobe powered down when watching and if you're a film person, you will see many of the plot devices Cameron uses in previous movies reapplied here.  His message also gets a bit heavy handed in places as well, especially his anti-military bias.  Soldiers, don't take it personally..it's the martial methods as a valid policy option for eminent domain he's ranting about (something shared with Star Wars, though there were shades of a good vs evil conflect there as well.)  Cameron is a master storyteller and he pushes most peoples buttons with this story.  Bottom line: it's exciting, it's visually stunning, it's emotionally satisfying...a breakthrough movie everyone should own.",1275609600,5,1171,4.964102564102564
3933155,3,B002HEXVUI,"I received this in the mail today and was very excited as I never got to see this movie in theatres. I thought the movie itself was great. The plot was good, nothing amazing but the moral behind the story was what I liked. It really shows how we as a race are destroying ourselves and everything around. The special effects, graphics and sound were awesome. There were parts where I couldn't tell if the Na'vi were actual real actors or computer generated.

Anyways, I didn't really read any reviews on this product, I just went by all the hype I heard while it was in theatres. The movie was good, but I have to say I was disappointed when I watched the movie and after I looked for special features. I looked on the blu-ray disc; nothing at the main menu. All that was available was some sound options, subtitles and scenes. Popped in the DVD, nothing on that. Read those little sheets of paper inside the case to see if you had to download it online through a PC. Nothing. The special features really were a let down, I can't remember the last time I bought a movie and had no special features on it. Maybe during the VHS days...

Anyways, 3/5 stars since I was just the movie with nothing special. It's still not a bad deal since you get the DVD and Blu-ray at such a great price on Amazon. For the movie itself, I would give it 4.5/5 stars just because I thought the plot could have been a little better.",1275523200,,1409,4.293233082706767
3933156,4,B002HEXVUI,"AVATAR

I finally came across this film and finally felt the need to see it [I say finally like it was yesterday, it has been a while since I watched this, of course I watched this when it was released, anyway], I knew it had been overly hyped and had a feeling I would not like it. So when I finally decided to get it I can honestly say that while I did like it is far from the greatest film ever. Of course like any one will tell you visually it is a stunning film, you should have seen this in theaters. Of course on DVD and Blu Ray this film still looks amazing but the theatrical experience is where it was at. Still there are bad and good with this film although I really wanted this to be a 5 star classic. With that said this fails in my opinion to reach that legendary status as a whole, visually thought the film will of course go down in history.

I am sure you all know the story since I am very late to the party in reviewing this, but here it goes any way. The place is Pandora and Pandora is absolutely amazing, it is a very beautiful place with amazing creatures. One of the these so called creatures is the local human like inhabitants the Na'vi, a peaceful people who are one with there environment and planet. But the humans that are ""visiting"" the planet to study it are planning on running these people off so they can drill, of course they are not happy about that. In comes a paralyzed Marine named Jake Sully who is replacing his now deceased brother in a project that may help lower tensions between the two peoples. He is enlisted into the Avatar project in which he can control the body of a Na'vi like body in order to interact with them. But his military superior Colonel Quaritch and over all boss Parker Selfridge want him to gather Intel for their own purposes.

As the story would go he would meet and come to respect the native people and even fall in love with one of them, ala Pocahontas. And that is what I was thinking throughout this entire movie, not that it was a bad thing. I remember watching this with my bro and both us were thinking where have we seen this before, and then there it was, Pocahontas. Later in the film all we could think of was FernGully if you can believe that, once again not that this is a bad thing. The retelling of every story ever is basically what every movie is these days since original material is getting harder for some filmmakers to come with. I think the only reason that it was such a big deal with this film [people have said this film as stole from every story I can think of] is because it was such a huge film.

Now I may catch some heat for this but this film is not a classic in my opinion, visually yes but as far as everything else I don't think so. Which brings me to the visuals, this film is stunning and is wonderful to look at. From the animation cgi all the way to the vibrant colors all of the place. The land, creatures, and animals all look astonishing and on that level this film is great. James Cameron knows what he wants and did a great job with this film, sure to me the story could have been more original but honestly that is such a small thing because, well, the film was very entertaining. Cameron did a great job with this film but dare I say I liked his ex wife's film ""The Hurt Locker"" even more. Yes I said it, it is out there, let the hate come.

Now like I said the story is very familiar but lets get past that for a second and just take it for what it is, good. The story is the classic outsider getting in with the group and falling for one of the members. So with that said it is a nice tale of one people learning to respect the others cultures, yes I know it sounds like another very famous movie. With all that aside the performances are what you would expect from a big [huge] budget blockbuster film. All are good in this movie but none to most are not award worthy in my opinion which is normally the case with these type of films. Of course that may be because the visuals of this film were so strong it overshadowed everything else about the film. Sam Worthington is very good here in the lead as Jake Sully as is Giovanni Ribisi, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang [show stealer maybe], Joel Moore and the always great Michelle Rodriguez, all are good, some are voice acting.

Now the themes of the movie are many depending on who is watching the film and their take on it. The most prominent ones I have heard are people's belief in technology over faith and religion, this is the one I think is most likely. Of course there is also the human's destruction of the planet and the environment, I can see that in this film as well. And then there is the thing about this being a metaphor for America invading other countries during the war, this is the least likely in my opinion. What the case and I am sure Cameron has said what the theme truly is but let us once again move on.

Over all this is a very entertaining movie that cost a lot, and made a lot [even more thanks to the 3-D experience]. Is this a fun movie that people should just turn the brain off and enjoy, yes. Is this film a classic, in my opinion no, but I can see how some can make the case for it. The last thing I want to say or ask is this, am I wrong for rooting for the humans to crush the Na'vi and the traders to the human race [sorry Michelle]. My brother an I [who admittedly usually root for the so called ""bad guys""] found our selves right in front of every one cheering when the Marines were blowing them away. In any movie of humans vs other I am a member of ""team people"" like Joe Rogan would say, I wanted the people to win. Well maybe not if the Na'vi represented religion over technology, then I have to go for them. Oh man I am confused, some one help me!",1275523200,,5773,4.153708668453977

3933166,5,B002HEXVUI,"This is a no-frills DVD. The movie starts, it plays, it ends. There are no ""extras.""

But, we knew that going in. James Cameron said that in order to really get the highest quality image, given the massive length of the movie, he had to use all of the room on the DVD (disk) for the movie. I will buy into that, until I see if that holds true in the forthcoming ""enhanced DVD"" due out later this year. But for now, the detail is nice, the quality is superb, and the movie is as fun as ever. This is of course NOT 3-D or Blue Ray, or anything fancy, but the visuals are still stunning.

Okay, so what can I say about the movie that I haven't already said on Radio Avatar (the unofficial podcast of the Avatar movie: find it at [...]) or on the [...] forums? The story is your typical boy grows up to be a US Marine, trains in Recon, fights in the jungle, gets his spine ""blowed-up"" and ends up on a distant planet in a wheel chair movie. (and that is just in the first 3 minutes!) What makes this movie different from any other war/sci-fi movie is the layers and layers of meaning and inference woven together by the storyteller (JC) in a way that truly relates ""a fair telling of the story."" A lot of what you don't see in the movie is revealed in the accompanying book (sadly, not included with the DVD) ""The Activist's Survival Guide""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar-A-Confidential-Report-on-the-Biological-and-Social-History-of-Pandora-James-Cameron-s-Avatar/dp/0061896756/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar: A Confidential Report on the Biological and Social History of Pandora (James Cameron's Avatar)</a>&nbsp;or ASG. It paints a pretty beak picture of life on Earth at the time of the movie, and is almost sympathetic to the vast RDA corporation we see in the movie representing the human interest.

This movie is a clash of civilizations. It is more than technology (and the isolation it implies) versus a deep-spiritual connection with the world around you. It is about the choices we make in life, and how those choices are based on our perceptions of reality. Jake Sully (our hero) is a fish-out-of-water, thrust into a world of scientists who can no more understand the world around them than the corporate execs whose job it is to tear up the place and extract valuable minerals. His perspective of reality is what drives the story. His ability to exist in two worlds bridges them into a fusion of action until it reaches a breaking point. At this point of the trilogy, disharmony is the only answer. The two have not learned yet to coexist. Will they ever? We will just have to wait for JC to tell us. But in this installment, we have a complete story of how one civilization invades another, disrupting the balance of nature--and nature fights back. (oopsie!)

Strong environmentalist messages, some anti-""unrestrained capitalism"" sentiment, oh, and yes, PAGAN ceremonies. Don't watch if you have a heart condition and are intolerant of other's belief systems.

Basic story is that we found a new planet with a valuable mineral. We want that mineral at any cost. Therefore, we attempt communication and barter, if that does not work for some reason then it is coercion and displacement. One misplaced person  is stuck in the middle of the decision and is torn between two ways of life and loyalty. Will his actions actually affect either way of life or is he just a pawn?

Now I know I have seen this whole movie before in animation but cannot seem to locate it. I was surprised and more so. Because it is one thing to follow a formula but another to downright copy another movie. There was no body substitution in the animated film. Yet that was the only real addition.

O.K. for the techocentric I only saw the Blu-ray 2D version. I think it was the 46"" screen that made the impressive presentation. It almost looked 3D. In addition, the sound was all you would expect it to be.

For people that come to think of the DVD extras or Bonus as a relevant part of the package. Moreover, many times it is. You will be disappointed with the version I watched, as there was only a screen/bookmark section.",1275264000,,1534,4.483870967741935

Sure, Cameron took many ideas from other things like the plot being from Pocahontas, some of the ships being from Halo, and many other ideas, but he created them in his own image on this new planet. One of the coolest scenes is when the movie opens up, and Jake Sully, actor Sam Worthington, is in the giant space ship.
One of the coolest ideas in this entire movie is the sense that everything on the planet is connected by some sort of biological idea, and Eywa is their god, so to speak. The only way to talk to her is through the Tree of Souls.
This movie is a great action movie. It verges right on the edge of being too filled with action, but at the same time, it holds itself back just enough to be a great movie.",1275264000,,863,4.142857142857143
3933189,4,B002HEXVUI,"My husband and I may be the last two people on this planet, or any other, to see AVATAR.  But after seeing it last night, we agree that AVATAR is the most visually stunning movie ever made.  The colors are saturated and mind blowing; the effects and CGI are breathtaking and seamless; the details are thoughtful and magnificent.  The future tech is credible and amazing.  And the world of Pandora is brilliantly thought out.  The culture, history, and very uniqueness of this alien planet and all her indigenous life forms are completely believable, minutely detailed, and exquisitely rendered; it is a rich civilization whose background and relationships to the world are incredibly developed and enveloping.  The viewer easily becomes a part of this world, drinking in its sights, its sounds, and its people.

The only criticism I have of AVATAR is the plot.  The story told in AVATAR may be all dressed up in the most spectacular ball gown ever made, but it is still old, a story we've heard a million times.  It is Lawrence of Arabia; it is Dances with Wolves; it is Pocahontas, to name just a few.  The problem I see is this:  we are what we can imagine.  While there is no doubt that our history tells us that ""civilized"" humans have overrun and nearly destroyed indigenous peoples time and time again, there is no reason to suggest that we would do so in our future.  Humans do learn from their mistakes.  One thing science fiction has shown us that we become, we invent, and we seek what we dream.  So if we produce movies and books and TV shows which show us exploring and making friends instead of invading, if we can get over the whole ""humans bad"" mentality, then we can achieve a more positive future.  I prefer the future worlds of Star Trek and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, where humans communicate with and learn from aliens rather than attacking them.

Overall, I did enjoy AVATAR very, very much, and I would most certainly watch it again.  The fantastic world of Pandora is one to savored and revisited; there is no question about that.  But AVATAR is not an instant classic; rather, it is a film making breakthrough, a technical masterpiece which represents several giant leaps forward in how movies are made, and the standard to which all movies will be held for years to come.",1275264000,2,2305,4.646913580246913

The acting in films like this is usually rote at best, but the two lead actors really made you believe their bond.

3933193,5,B002HEXVUI,"I just saw Avatar yesterday.  I have to say it definately impressed me.  Before I saw it, I knew that it had a lot of computer animation in it and part of me was saying that this is gonna be a crappy attempt to make that next generation movie because everything would look fake.  The other part of me was saying that this was also the most expensive movie ever made and there's a reason why.  So not being able to decide what I thought it would be like, I watched it.  It blew me away at how detailed and vibrant the animation was.  The avatars even had similar facial features to that of their human controlling them.  The voices and sounds of the people and the jungle were life like.  I couldn't believe that everything would look so real.  This shows me where all the money went.

Another thing that I really liked was the themes of the movie.  The humans were actually the bad guys in this one.  They came to the plantet, Pandora, to mine unobtanium (which is funny because it suggests that it is unobtainable).  It sells for $20 million a kilo or something and all they are trying to do it get as much as they can.  The Navi, however, see life through the eyes of nature.  Every plant and animal on Pandora is connected and so are everyone of the Navi people.  They live in harmony and it is amazing how it hints at true spirituality.  This theme is that money should not be the center of your life and that spiritual things are much more sustaining. Another theme I liked was that everyone of the Navi could plug into each other, animals, and trees just like plugging a cord into a computer and syncing.  It suggests that there is one mind and that all are connected no matter how different.  This is very similar to some religions today and I found it very interesting that they combined spirituality into an action movie on another planet.

Definately watch this movie!!  It is probably the best movie I've ever seen.  The graphics and sound quality is superb and would be twice as good on blu-ray with surround sound.  But let me warn you, the version that is out now on DVD is only the movie, in November or December of this year a compete edition will come out that will have all the bonus features and what not.  Wait until then if you can to buy it.  But don't wait until then to watch it!  Rent it or if you've got deep pockets buy it now and then buy the second edition later.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.  Hardly any blood, a few obsenities, and a lot of good suspense.  Not to mention the ties with nature and god.  5 stars all the way!",1275177600,5,2575,4.282157676348548

So we waited for the DVD with diminishing enthusiasm, but we were in for a great surprise. We absolutely loved it! It is a wonderful story, one that leaves a deep mark in your memory, a vivid memory you can draw upon when you're down.

To be accurate, after I jumped through the hoops to update the firmware on my player, I could get it to play if I hit one of the menu buttons while it was initially trying to read the disk and I could get to a menu, and, then I could get it to play until about 30 minutes in, when it started pixelating, super-imposing the chapter search screen on top of the video, then finally completely locking up the player.

Since encountering this, I did some minor research on the issue (do a search on your player model and ""avatar"" to see if it will play on yours), and the discussion seems to center on how Fox got stupid and released the BlueRay DVD with some extremely stupid DRM (anti-piracy) code on it without sufficiently testing it, since it basically won't play on a significant number of BlueRay players out there (including some very high-end players).

I won't be buying any further Fox BlueRay disks until/unless I hear they have removed such incompatible DRM - I'm not purchasing a new BlueRay player because the studio is so stupid.

Specific scenes are actually exactly the same as various paintings by Roger Dean which is a disgrace, in my book. Oh the film rocks alright, but primarily because of the sequences that take place on the alien world the human characters are attempting to free of its natural resources. These sequences are brilliantly colorful, and completely appropriated from Roger Dean's ""Dragon Dreams"", and lets not forget the blue aliens in the Star War's saga by George Lucas. In that sense the film is the most transparent attempt to rip off other creative people I have ever seen. I don't believe any of the artistic folk he borrowed work from were in on the Avatar film project.

Here is where it really kind of lost me. Seems to me this was a veiled attempt at getting an enviromental message out in movie form. I am sorry I am kind to thenviroment , i recycle, I walk or ride a bike when possible. I just do not like being preached to.",1275091200,,618,3.7615384615384615

3933223,5,B002HEXVUI,"Of course I loved the movie at the theatre -- great in 3D.  3D was made for this sort of thing.  I even saw it in IMAX 3D, as well as the standard version in super wide-screen.  But I don't have Blu-Ray, so I had to get the standard DVD.  Besides, you'd have to have a 3D TV to pick up the 3D effect anyway, so that release was a bit premature.

The standard format is still a great escape on a rainy day or when there's nothing worth watching on the tube!  On my small TV it seems a bit dark, but I think that's just my TV -- everything looks dark on it.

Of course, if you have Blu-Ray, go for the upgrade, but if you loved it at the theatre and don't have Blu-Ray, you'll still love it in this format  My only complaint is that there was no insert showing the ""bookmarks"" for finding a specific scene, but that's not a serious issue when you've seen it several times.",1275004800,,870,3.9884393063583814

3933228,5,B002HEXVUI,"For its visuals, ten stars.

When it comes to computer animation, I'm a hard sell, but I loved everything visual in this film. There were just tons of fabulous scenes.

For concept, the idea is simply, well, off the planet. Another ten stars.

In fact, I bought into the whole concept so hard, I almost didn't care when the clich-riddled, seen-it-a-million-times main plot kicked in and the plot stars fell all the way away.

No stars for the plot.

What a sad thing it must be to be a filmmaker, to have a Dune-like message in your hands and be forced to sell it out so that the multitude of morons will ""get it."" Zero stars for carry through of the idea.

Still, despite the crappy plot, the Bucky Beaver smile of Sigourney Weaver's laughable Avatar, the inconclusive ending (the humans should have had their butts kicked off the planet), the fact that we were never shown why unobtanium was so special (a really key plot element similar to that of Dune's spice and its importance in space jump travel - in other words, a reason that might have made the desperation of the miners understandable), and of course the shelf-stock bad guys, Avatar remains a pretty good see.

As a blog article of mine points out, the devastation stemming from an EMP Attack would be real and decisive; and maybe 10 percent of Americans would survive, only to be conquered by others. Yes, it seems far-fetched to make comparisons to Hollywood's fantasy films, but this one is real and a wake-up call--albeit unintended by the filmmakers.",1274918400,,607,5.257731958762887

3933233,5,B002HEXVUI,"Before the movie Avatar came out I thought the previews looked silly and I told everyone I had no desire to see the film.  When the Blu-ray disc came out, I decided to give it a try only because I had already seen almost every other movie that was out at the video store.  It was late at night and I truly expected to fall asleep one-third of the way through the movie.  I could not have been more wrong.  I watched every second of this amazing movie and enjoyed all of it.

CGI or whatever they call it these days works so well in this movie that I totally forgot I was watching the impossible.  All the actors did an excellent job and the script, with the exception of the over-the-top corporate meany who was going to farm the land at any cost, was nearly perfect.  I am a die-hard, right-wing, Ronald Reagan-loving Republican, but even with my anti-liberal slant, I have to admit that the plot of this movie is basically how early-America treated the American Indians and their land.  And, the story does it in a way that really makes one wonder why we were surprised when the indians fought back against us.

But the movie Avatar is even more than that; it is a movie about understanding the what and why of cultures we are truly far away from, by no fault of our own.  The possibilities of discovery and understanding are always right in front of us...but we must be willing to see and truly listen to what's out there.  Blinding greed is never good for the socialist, the capitalist, or the person who has no idea what either of those words mean.

The characters in Avatar are unforgettable, encouraging, and original.  The script and special effects are second to none.

If you don't own Avatar on blu-ray, what are you waiting for?  Buy it, watch it, and enjoy it!  The whole movie is a SPECIAL FEATURE!

3933245,3,B002HEXVUI,"Like so many others, I loved Avatar.  Sure, it is Ferngully starring enormous, aesthetically pleasing Smurfs.  We all know this by now.  I bought the DVD/Blu-ray because I heard that there was extra footage that wasn't released in the theater, making of videos, and so forth.

The day after I made my amazon purchase I found out that this release was the actual movie only.  No added features.  And that in August James Cameron was going to have the film return to the big screen with *gasp* 6 whole minutes of extra footage and that such footage and extras weren't going to be released to DVD/Blu-ray until after that.

If you are looking for extras, don't buy this, wait until the full release comes out.  If you just want to watch the pretty pictures and aren't interested in extras anyway, then go ahead and make your purchase.  The Blu-ray quality is gorgeous.  I didn't miss the 3D at all.  It was crisp and clear.

Quote from highdefdigest : ""On the other hand, the bass never really extends to the deepest registers, even when you expect (or need) it to.

3933251,4,B002HEXVUI,"First the blu-ray:  Avatar has the best Hd picture I have ever seen out of over 400 HD DVDS and Blu-Rays.  The image quality is absolutely perfect in every way.  Its sharp highly detailed and has a terrific sense of depth.  Audio is not far behind presented in a 5.1 lossless DTSHDMA track. It is easily in my top 20 tracks probably even top 10.  The surround channels are very engaging especially when Jake gets lost in the forest.  This is a nice wide open 360 degree sound field.  I felt the sub could have hit a little harder at times, but this is a very minor complaint.  This is a demo disc all around and holds up well to seeing it in 3d.  There is also a really cool avatar styled THX demo after the credits which you can get to by hitting the skip chapter button. This discs only true weakness is no special features hence the 4 stares.

now the movie:  Avatar is not very original it takes almost all its story elements from other
films.  I felt the story which has been told many times before and was totally predictable is still great.  This is a very fun movie to watch with outstanding eye candy.  Avatar has the best CGI I have ever seen and brings some very good points to the table.  I have not seen a film that transported me to another world like this for a long time.  Because of its pure entertainment value I put it up with the best movies I saw all year.  The acting well not Oscar worthy is perfectly fine.",1274918400,2,1430,4.198529411764706
3933252,5,B002HEXVUI,This movie was no question buy on Blu-ray for me although that may have to do with seeing it in theaters 3 times. So of course I had to buy it although I must say going from the 3d theaters to my 50 inch plasma I gained and lost certain things in transition. The colors are more vibrant with my TV vs The DLP projector plus the image is sharper to both. Its a shame to watch this movie is 2D since it was filmed specifically in 3D gaudy glasses be damned but its a shame they haven't worked out the 3D standards yet. Still waiting for the directors cut and all that jazz its a bare bones package but its still one of the best movies released in years. Sure it has a story that has been told before but if you tell it well people always tend to listen.

3933258,5,B002HEXVUI,"I went into this film with not much expectation if I'm honest. Even though it was a massive success in the box office and with critics, I just couldn't see myself enjoying it, but I must say I loved every minute. The special effects are really something astonishing in creating the world of Pandora, the Na'vi and everything else in between, but the story itself, although brilliant seemed fairly clich and could have offered so much more had Cameron spent a little more time putting the story together. Although this is the result of over 15 years of work by Cameron, I just felt that, in the end, the story could have been so much better when you consider the immensity of the special effects and acting quality provided.

The story focuses around Corporal Jake Sully, a crippled ex-marine called in to take part in the Avatar program as a replacement for his twin brother. This program puts him in the body of a Na'vi which are the native sapient humanoids of the Earth-like moon of the planet Polyphemus, Pandora. The human military are on this planet to mine a rare but valuable mineral called unobtanium and it is Jake's and the other members of the Avatar team to try and convince the Na'vi to leave their village to allow the humans to mine for the mineral. However, the Na'vi's relationship with nature is much more than just living side by side, their is a connection that humans cannot understand until they become one of them and Jake finds out the hard way, that his native species aren't the moral beings he thought they were.

One thing I will say first of all is that this certainly a piece of artistic imagination with the creation of a whole new world and new species and have a great detail of information surrounding the creatures, plants and planet of this film. The character distinction between the Na'vi and Humans is something a little too familiar that some, more politically minded people, may find a tad uncomfortable as it's a blatant and tough reflection of the imperialists invading the native countries of a so-called savage race. Consider the British invasion and colonisation of America and the pillaging of the land of the native Americans, or even the British Empire as a whole and its war with the native African Zulu tribes. Up until even the 1930s we were still calling the native African tribes savages and using this rhetoric as a way of taking their land in the name of democracy and freedom. Perhaps I'm looking too much into it, but I found this to be a stark finger pointing at those who hold such opinions and may even be applied to the current ""war"" in Afghanistan and Iraq as many would question the real motives of being in these countries.

The acting is splendid to say the least. Sam Rockwell does brilliantly as the main protagonist of the film in both his human and Na'vi form. Sigourney Weaver also plays an excellent hard ass scientist role and makes the film that little bit more entertaining. The Na'vi characters such as Zoe Saldana as Neytiri are brilliantly done and were created through a motion capture technique which is why the movement and behaviour of these creatures comes across so well on screen. By far though, the best character in this movie is the main antagonist Colonel Miles Quaritch played by Stephen Lang. He's the stereotypical army man; loyal to his code and his country and has total disregard for all those who associate themselves with the ""enemy"". He's cruel and sadistic and by far the most entertaining of all the cast.

The planet is beautiful and the characters complex and interesting. However, I only wish that the story was the same as it felt so shallow and typical, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. Watch it, you'll love it.",1274832000,,3719,4.673282442748092

There are so many things in the movie that just don't make sense. With the exception of Sigourney Weaver, who is quite good in the movie, there are absolutely no notable performances. The direction movies are taking, where an entire film can be shot inside a computer, or against blue screens...some of the magic is lost. Nothing feels real. I guess we are supposed to sympathize with the protagonist, but there is no depth to him at all. In fact there is no depth to any of the characters. Almost every single one of them is a simple cliche. Which isn't a problem, and in fact some very good movies are made without any sort of originality. But when you want an audience to really connect to the movie you're making, you have to give them something to grab on to.

I am obviously in the minority, but I watched it with my dad and brother, and none of us could get past how awful the dialog is. The story isn't original, but it isn't necessarily bad. It's really the poor casting choices and the poor script that bring this movie down. After the movie ended, I pictured Sam Worthington reading through the script, turning to James Cameron, laughing and saying ""No really where's the real script?"" And apparently even with the development of intergalactic space space travel, the military is still stuck in the 18th century. How exactly would a racist redneck be put in command of an entire military base? Why would you want someone like that in place when you know they just want to go out and kill everything that moves? See, they could have done that, but then the movie should have been about the Na'Vi mounting a resistance. I don't understand why they bothered trying to have peaceful negotiations at all. With a military leader like that things are only going to end one way, really.

The whole movie really just felt like one plot convenience after another, like no real effort was put into making sure that there were emotionally connecting reasons behind why the people in the story did what they did. I understand that James Cameron has pushed the boundaries in Avatar of what is possible on a technical level, but he should not have directed the movie. He should have been the DP (director of photography) on the movie. When you spend almost a decade messing with cameras, 3d, blue screens, motion capture, and everything else, little attention gets paid to things like script...actors...characters...plot...etcetera.",1274832000,20,2871,4.8076923076923075

This is a movie you really should watch once to see the story, and then 1-3 more times at least just to look around the world and see some of the interesting stuff included for the world of pandora.

The sad thing is that the bad guys in the movie are a pretty accurate reflection of how the world is now. If you don't understand something, destroy it.

Of course the movie itself is spectacular.  It even translates to small TV fairly well for such a large-spectacle movie.

I was a little disappointed when I watched the DVD for the first time, though.  Being a fan, I was hoping for special features (making of featurettes, cast interviews, director commentary, deleted scenes, etc.).  However, there is only the movie.  This is not an Amazon product glitch either.  (My step-mother bought the exact same thing from Barnes & Noble for twice the price.)

I don't know if the Blu-ray has any of these special features or not.  Perhaps the production company is going to wait until the sequels are done?  Or are going to release the special features separately???

3933294,2,B002HEXVUI,"First off I have to admit that this movie was visually stunning. The special effects were great, the colors beautiful, all of that. This beauty kept me entertained for about 5 minutes and then I needed more. I never got it.

It was just plain boring. The plot was as stereotypical as all of the characters. The dialogue was bad. I can deal with that if the movie is supposed to be fun, but it took itself far too seriously. It was unabashedly preachy (yes, we know that we need to take care of our planet, though I didn't know that the military was all bad but I guess I will have to take James Cameron's word for it because he makes movies and he must know). I felt like it was taken for granted that I, as an audience member, was dumb and must be instructed, but it couldn't be too complicated or I might miss the point. I don't mind filmmakers putting their viewpoints into moves, that is their right. I just wish that Cameron could have been more subtle about it.

Why did the aliens have to be perfect in every way? They were beautiful, connected to the earth, appologized nicely for everything they killed for food, and never battled among themselves. When has a civilization ever been this perfect? They needed a depth that they didn't have. There was one large part, during a sequence that had to be at least 30 minutes of discovering how wonderful these people are, when I expected someone to break out into ""Colors of the Wind"" from Disney's Pocahontas (which was, in my opinion, a movie with a better script and a lot more depth).

I did not go to a theatre and see this. I rented it and watched it, in blu ray, at home. I have been told that if I had seen it in theatres in 3D, I would have thought that it was a good movie. How does the format in which you view it suddenly make it wonderful. I understand that it was visually magnificient in 3D, and you felt like you were sucked into Pandora. Great. Maybe I would have been entertained by the visuals for 10 minutes, instead of 5. That still doesn't make it a good movie. Avatar would still have been boring. The storyline, plot, and acting should be able to  stand on its own without the support of 3D. How long can a movie endure if it is only decent when seen in theaters. It gets two stars for visual effects.",1274659200,4,2278,4.278422273781903

Of course, in Blu-ray, the clarity is brilliant, and the dazzling effects of the film do not disappoint. It is one of those films that offers something new each time it is viewed; when one can finally tear one's eyes off the principles in a scene, the smaller, exquisite details can be appreciated anew each time. My only disappointment was the lack of those ""speacial features"" that cinemaphiles love, as in HBO's ""First Look"" features.

It reminds me of King Kong except King Kong was a movie with some thought put into it.  Avatar has this silly plot of some stupid imaginary world where everything is blue tinted and some beasts running around with loin clothes. The floating islands looked like giant poop plops and u could tell the director was thinking ""ooh I'm gonna get 'em with this.  Well NOT ME.  I just wanted to keep fast forwarding until the end to get it over with.  I guess I'm a hater becuz I thought this movie was too long and overdone.

The story was pretty good, but nothing that blows your mind. The ""political"" undertones are pretty obvious, even for those not already aware of them, and it may seem sort of ""preachy"" to some viewers, but it doesn't beat you over the head and make you feel guilty. The visuals are what make this such a great film. Make sure you're buying it on Bluray and watching it in 1080p, otherwise you're missing out!

Be aware that this disc has NO special features (I think they've done a good job making sure people are aware of that) because they used all the space on the disc to give the best picture and sound possible.

3933346,3,B002HEXVUI,"There is a lot of good and bad in this film. This seems to be the new standard for hollywood these days. Lots of flash and glitter,
but not much else.

The special effects are outstanding. An easy 5 stars for the eye candy.

There are some excellent actors in the film and they mostly do a good job, but less than you would expect from them. Not entirely
their fault. Even the best actors need something to work with, and they didn`t have much. Considering that, they did a pretty good
job with what little they had to work with. 4 stars for the acting.

Trying to mix sci-fi and fantasy together generally doesn`t work that well. And this film is no exception. The film is much more
fantasy than science fiction, but the jumping back and forth between the two causes some major disconnects while watching the film.
3 stars for that, and that may be a little generous.

The story line is old and tired. At least 400 years old, probably much more than that. You would think that if they were going to
spend this kind of money on a film that they might want to come up with something halfway original. 2 stars for the story line.

While a couple of the plot devices are interesting most of them are standard hollyweird, and defy all common sense.

An example of a good one: Having a habitable moon around a gas giant planet. This is very possible assuming that it has a thick
enough atmospere to screen all the hard radiation that a giant planet would put out and is massive enough to maintain that atmospere.

But as I said, most of the plot devices used are pure nonsense. A couple of examples:

Human civilization is depected as being poor, but at the same time sending giant starships out on a regular basis. Any civilization
that is even capable of, let alone being able to afford to boost giant starships to 90% light speed would be insanely rich beyond
our wildest imagination. This is the kind of energy that would melt the crust of a planet.

The mythical unobtanium (no such element exists) should be found in roughly equal amounts on any of the moons around the gas giant
as they would have formed from the same elements. Why not just mine it from one, or all of the small moons? Any civilization that
can build giant starships would be perfectly at ease working in vacuum and there would be no deep gravity well to have to lift it
out of as well as no big blue bogymen shooting arrows at you.

How would the ecco-system on this moon have come about? Evolution doesn`t work that way. Evolution is competive. This is goofy as
some new age cult.

These are just a few of the nutty plot devices, there are many more.
At best 1 and 1/2 stars for the plot devices.

Another thing that really bugs me about the film is that with the special effects budget they had, why didn`t they try to make the
aliens look like something that might really have evolved on another world instead of just sticking tails and clown noses on people
and painting them blue?
A real alien is not likely to look like us.

All in all the film is about what hollyweird is putting out these days. All eye candy and no meat.
Maybe someday they will make a sci-fi or fantasy film that has both great special effects, with a good story and plot, but today is
not that day.

The film is worth watching, just don`t have high expectations.",1274572800,3,3310,4.360975609756098
3933347,4,B002HEXVUI,"Good action movie with awesome special effects. We haven't watched many Blu-ray movies on our HDTV, so I really appreciated how it looked on the screen. This is the kind of movie that critics pick apart, but, in general, I enjoy action movies as long as the plot is (somewhat) believable, and Avatar falls into that category for me.",1274572800,,332,4.6440677966101696
3933348,5,B002HEXVUI,"This is not a guy flick nor a chick flick. Both can enjoy watching it. This is a right vs. wrong, action / adventure, love / commitment, trust / betrayal, heartbreaking / humorous film.  Avatar played with every emotion I have. I laughed and cried got angry then cheered. I really enjoyed this film.",1274572800,5,299,4.537037037037037

3933350,4,B002HEXVUI,"""Avatar"" is full of themes from the past (Man vs. Machine, Corporate America vs. Grassroot Interests and Romeo and Juliet). James Cameron uses ""Avatar"" as a means of integrating messages through breath taking cinematography.  Where many companies use ""product integration"" as a form of advertisement, Cameron uses ""Political Integration"" to advertise a salient message.

The most philosophically profound part of ""Avatar"" is when the hero is praying to God to deliver a victory to the ""Blue people,"" and the heroine tells him that the ""Great Mother (God) does not take sides; she only protects the balance of life.""  This one statement reflects a truism of the real world and breaks the religious dogma of contemporary society. But, just as Cameron makes this critical proclamation, he recoils and backs up, pandering to the idea that good always triumphs over evil.  ""Avatar"" works because it does not ""insist on itself."" Rather, it plays to the subconscious aspirations of most people by not upsetting the apple cart or being contrary.

For the sake of the formulaic Hollywood script of happy endings and the need for humans to avoid the ugliness of reality, ""Avatar"" is a hope-filled movie that suspends reality in two regards: 1. Advanced animation allows fantasy to appear real and 2. The story line asks viewers to accept a world where economic development and corporate interests can be overtaken by the proletariat. Whether this last statement is true and feasible is debatable.

Overall, ""Avatar"" is an entertaining movie although it panders to the low brow of society in hopes of moving the emotion without touching the psyche.

3933351,1,B002HEXVUI,"1.  Since the blue people weren't using the Unobtainium for anything, why didn't the humans just ask for it?

2.  Where did the blue people get the giant guns fit to scale in the last scene (when the earthlings left the planet) that were the same size as them? They were using earthman sized guns in the war.

3.  Wasn't it weird to see Sigourney Weaver in a movie with those same Robocop/robot things she used in Alien?

It's the gripping story of a paraplegic Marine vet who gets a 2nd chance at life on the Planet of Pandora. He finds himself living vicariously thru his Avatar and falls in love with the Navi people and there way of life. It's an epic film and there was nothing vulgar or too scarey for kids. My 3 year old little girl loves it too. I painted her room like Pandora with glow in the dark paint. Anyway it's an amazing film and I highly recommend it to everyone.

Without going into detail, it is sad that the people that made this movie decided to use bad language to emphasize points in the movie where a simple word of alarm would have sufficed.  I mean, come on!!!!  It seems that this movie was primarily directed to the younger audience, so why is their bad language?  Because of this, we have decided not to purchase this movie.  Why?  Because I can't watch it with our children in the room and it is sad.  This movie had some very interesting ideas in it and it was ruined by a little bad language that was not needed.

During the whole movie I kept thinking:
-Wow that was a great CGI shot.
-Those military aircraft look really similar to those in ""The Terminator"".
-Look at how saturated the colors are.
-I like how that Alien looks like something from Cammeron's last film ""Aliens of the Deep"".
-Those things reminds me of the loaders that Sigourney Weaver used in Cammeron's other film, ""Aliens"".
-Now cut to hero shot.

When Grace and her avatar were laid at the base of the tree, you knew instantly what would happen to her in that scene and to Jake at the end.  Not only did that scene show what would happen to Jake in the end, but also exactly what would be the last shot of the film.  Not that you didn't already know that from the first scene with the eye opening and the 'my previous life was just a dream and I'm just now waking up' voice over.

3933375,5,B002HEXVUI,It wasn't as good as watching it in 3-D in the theatre but I knew it was going to be part of my collection as soon as it went to DVD. Love this movie!!! Nothing like you have ever seen before. It is not a cartoon!! And is for both young children and adults to enjoy!!! So get the popcorn and make this Avatar a movie night the whole family will enjoy!,1274486400,,351,3.888888888888889

3933377,5,B002HEXVUI,After seeing this movie twice in the theaters we knew we were going to buy it as soon as it came out. Believe it or not it is even better on our tv. The colors and HD were amazing. The movie loses nothing by not having 3-D on the tv. So glad we purchased it!,1274486400,,258,3.709090909090909
3933378,1,B002HEXVUI,The reason why i buy blu-rays are because the special features. I pre-order avatar blu-ray so there were no any reviews yet...but i guess all people wanted blu ray for the special features. Other thing than that no doubt the movie was brilliant. I guess it's not smart to pre-order blu rays before you know the details/reviews.,1274486400,,327,4.754385964912281
3933379,5,B002HEXVUI,"We saw Avatar in 3D at the theater, and immediately knew we wanted to own this one.
The Amazon offer of BOTH blue ray and DVD for one price is UNBELIEVABLE!  Local stores wanted more than this for the DVD alone!  We don't have a blue ray player yet, but we knew we WILL have one soon, so we are now ready.
Service was outstanding, as always when dealing with Amazon.

3933380,1,B002HEXVUI,"As I watched Avatar, I started to think that I have seen this before...

-At the beginning of the movie where the main character wakes up from a long sleep while traveling in space: Movie Similar to: Alien (because Sigourney Weaver is in the movie?).

-Wasn't the robot riding machine the same one that was used in Alien, and was also in the final Matrix movie?

-The main character is sent out to make connections with the aliens. In Pocahontas, John Smith meets the natives and eventually turns and supports their side.

-The planet where the story takes place...looks like the ""Lion King"", especially at the end of the movie, as the scene flies over the tree tops. Throw in weird colors here and there like in Dumbo.

-The main characters fall in love like: Pocahontas. (remember Pocahontas and John Smith).

-In Pocahontas, they came to the new world looking for gold. In avatar, they are looking for that special rock.

-The helicopters in Avatar look like the helicopters  from Pixar's Incredibles.

-The special tree in avatar that gave life, remind me of the old woman tree in Pocahontas. Or, have you been to Animal Kingdom in DisneyWorld, where there is a tree of life?

-The people in Pocahontas were connected to the land. Same thing in Avatar.

-The leader of the alien people acted like Pocahontas father. Even the voices was similar.

-Pocahontas was suppose to marry one of the warriors. The female alien was suppose to marry an alien warrior.

-Why did the aliens ride horses like Pocahontas people?

-The jelly fish looking thing remind of me of ""Nemo"". Thank goodness they didn't get drunk when the jelly fish thing touch them. However, the jelly fish looking thing select the main character as if he is the chosen one who will save everyone, just like Neo in the Matrix.

-The floating islands looks like ""Castle in the Sky"" (yes, it was Japanese movie, but it was released in the US by Disney).

-John Smith almost dies in Pocahontas and he had to go back to England. In avatar, the main character almost dies.

-You enter another world using a machine like the Matrix.

-The aliens do a ""Mind Melt"" like Dr. Spock in Star Trek.

-Finally, the Aliens in Avatar looks like a cross between an over grown human and a cat, with eyes used on Michael Jackson Thriller in the final scene.

I did see this movie on my HDTV, and guess there was something missing by not seeing it in 3D. However, the plot was too familiar and I couldn't get into the movie. I'm sure if I go to sleep right now, in the morning I can come up with more ""I've seen this before"".",1274486400,20,2569,4.543478260869565
3933381,3,B002HEXVUI,I paid more for it on amazon and got days after it came out so check your local video store before you order online it's the same price and you have it same day,1274400000,,160,3.735294117647059
3933382,5,B002HEXVUI,"I pre-ordered the movie and it arrived on the day that it was released in stores. I thought that was great. The blu-ray is fantastic, and even without the 3D this movie looks amazing on an HDTV.",1274400000,2,194,4.27027027027027
3933383,3,B002HEXVUI,"There have been way too many reviews already of this over-hyped movie. It has been criticized for deriving its plot from other movies (e.g. Dances With Wolves, The Mission, It's a Bug's Life, among others), but many great works of art have been derivative from previous works (how many times has Robin Hood been remade, for instance?). It has been criticized, too, for its banal dialog and almost complete lack of character development. Well...it does live up to that.

Then there are the flat performances from otherwise terrific actors, phoning in their lines. But who can blame them with the lines their given? When Zoe Saldana's CGA character, for instance, in coming up with an explanation why she didn't kill Sam Worthington, says, ""You have a strong heart,"" she looks to the side as if embarrassed by what she's just have to read. She could just as easily have said, ""You have a cute tail.""

And finally there's the enough-already irritation everyone's felt from James Cameron's hyperbolic pimping of what was just a thumping good Saturday Matinee. He did have a great vision. If only he could have hired a good dialog writer.

But Avatar is really breathtaking to look at. I know it's almost a kiss of death to a movie to compliment its art direction and production design, but as a moving painting it is well worth it...even in 2D. As you can listen to great music without noticing it's trite lyrics, you can also just settle in and immerse yourself in the visual ""music"" of this movie. Think of it as opera. Nobody ever rates La Boheme for its story, but man, that Puccini could write moving music.",1274400000,3,1608,4.715302491103203
3933384,2,B002HEXVUI,"The film is beautiful visually; it's done well, and if you want a film that looks great and has plenty of action, you should really enjoy this one.  However, the problem I had was that I couldn't enjoy it because of the messages and implications Cameron put into the story; Military= bad (a favorite theme in Hollywood unfortunately)  and the slightly more subtle (but by the end of the film you've been hit over the head with it for hours) American history= evil, when you realize the Na'vi represent American Indians, it's tough to not see what Cameron is saying about American settlers.  The themes aren't new in the film industry, or other art fields (in fact they're so overused it's comes across, in a way, as a standard formula of sorts; rhetoric, simplistic?) but they lessened the experience for me, overpowering everything else. Again, if you're not put off by these messages you should enjoy the film; but if you're offended when the military is shown in a bad light, or when it's implied that American history is something to be ashamed of, you may want to check out something else.",1274400000,2,1094,4.6875
3933385,5,B002HEXVUI,"Saw the movie in theatres twice in 3 D.  DVD version was purchased (not blue ray as I didn't have the player as yet).  The detail on the DVD was fantastic and I am looking forward to release of the blue ray edition (I am ready for it now)with all the extras that were not available with the original blue ray release.  The story is a melange of plots but the execution is without fault.  Breath taking colors, backgrounds and scenery with the actors unencumbered by the restrictions of prosthetics of makeup.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes science fiction as well as anyone who enjoys a good story.",1274400000,6,617,4.473214285714286

3933388,4,B002HEXVUI,"When I saw this film in the theater (in 3D), I was blown away by the beauty; it is awe-inspiring to see how computer-generated image technology has advanced from ""Andrea and Wally B."" to a movie like this one. It literally creates a whole virtual world, and is worth watching even if not in 3D.",1274400000,2,294,4.363636363636363
3933389,5,B002HEXVUI,Enough reviews have been written about AVATAR the movie.  My five star rating says enough. What impressed me was the fine service from Amazon.com.  I received the two disc blu-ray combo movie within 48 hours after I ordered.  The price was competitive and then unexpectedly Amazon sent me a credit because of fierce competition regarding the movie.  Great movie and great company.,1274400000,2,380,5.080645161290323
3933390,5,B002HEXVUI,"After seeing Avatar in the theaters multiple times in 3-D, I was unsure if I would enjoy it as much. However, I enjoyed it even more. Viewing it out of 3-D is amazing as you can see the entire screen clearly. The attention of detail is unlike any other film. If you have a Blu-ray player and HDTV this is a must buy. Its the best looking movie I have ever watched on Blu-ray. The price was great and it comes with both a Blu-ray DVD and a standard DVD; which also looks amazing. The one complaint I have is neither disc has any special features.",1274400000,2,545,4.150943396226415

3933394,5,B002HEXVUI,I enjoyed the movie at the theater in 3D.  I didn't think I'd like it unless it was in 3D but this movie on blu-ray on my TV is a visual overload.  This is my reference movie when I'm showing off blu-ray to people who haven't seen its benefits.,1274400000,3,244,3.9591836734693877
3933395,5,B002HEXVUI,"The first thing I REALLY LOVE about this blu-ray release is that it is in 1.78:1 aspect ratio. NO BLACK BARS!!! I just don't understand why all directors/producers are not adopting this format, when 16:9 (which equates to 1.78:1) is the most popular HD-TV standard out there. I have yet to see a blu-ray movie that is so incredibly crisp on my Pioneer Kuro. And I am not going to comment on the movie itself, because a lot of people already did that.

I will summarize this review with one phrase said in the movie: ""When they are sitting on stuff that we want, we transform them in our enemies."" That is Cameron's wisdom at work, not to mention all the other hints about how incredibly **not** advanced we humans are. We still have a lot to learn.

3933398,3,B002HEXVUI,"I thought this film was visually beautiful and stunning.  The effects were impressive.  But a film should always be about the story and the characters, not just the effects.  Personally I found the story derivative and simplistic (very black/white, good guys vs. bad guys, no grays).  The anti-military (or anti-US) subtext made me extremely uncomfortable (and I'm not a gung-ho type per say).  The cartoon like violence bothered me (hello - people are supposedly dying here - remind me why are we're cheering?).  I've enjoyed the director's other films but this one just didn't do it for me.",1274313600,4,592,4.989795918367347

If you think about the computer generated facial features and movements, James Cameron created a new Genre of perfection in CGI. Thanks James for Creating something that will go down in history as one of the landmark films of this century. I can't wait for the next 2 films.",1274313600,5,569,4.377358490566038

When the pre-sale notice came out for the Blu-Ray disc, I immediately signed up for it... and I don't have a Blu-Ray disc player yet!  The DVD is almost as spectacular and I can't wait until I can get my Blu-Ray player so I can watch that.

3933402,3,B002HEXVUI,"Great movie but NO SPECIAL FEATURES!!!  I would have been willing to wait for the special feature version.  It's just another way for them to make money!  MAYBE they couldn't get all the stuff together for the SF so they decided to release just the movie.  But I think if they had explained it, the fans would have understood.  Now we have to buy the movie all over again when the SF version comes out.  More money needlessly going out the window.

I'm sure the patents on the technology will be making people a fortune for years to come. The story/plot is full of cliches that have been done in many other movies, just with the added avatar twist. It also lacks a really compelling villain. Just the typical hardline military type. But then Camerons movies are always that way. Simple stories but well done and Avatar was worth adding to my small bluray collection.

Not a review of AVATAR itself which is awesome 5/5 stars!  It was originally posted under a separate product listing that was AVATAR on-demand - but that was deleted and this was transferred to the DVD product listing.

I have tried to watch this on Demand & paid again to download a version to the Amazon Unbox player.  Both versions are very sub-par quality way below a normal DVD 480p widescreen.  Also their appears to be some aspect ratio distortion; not 100% sure about this but some heads are about 4x as tall as they are wide and the planet in the opening scene is highly elliptical. The downloaded version is a total of 3.26 gb in size - which is your first hint that Amazon has used some very high compression rates to downsize the movie.  This is below standard DVD 480p quality - extremely blurry no fine edges.  Also, my version with my Unbox player only plays in stereo.  I guess I was expecting a 1080p version with 5.1 surround or even a 720p quality with 5.1 at a minimum.  Do not waste your money on the Amazon rental - they simply don't have it together yet.

3933421,4,B002HEXVUI,"This story could be taken as hubris/greed vs pure/untouched at racial, social, technological, environmental, etc. levels. It was very predictable but still very well done. Cameron plainly wanted to convey a message to which mankind has paid lip service but continues to ignore, sans any meaningful effort at remedy. If the film has a positive impact, great...but most likely on that front, it is simply preaching to the choir. All that having been said, I thought the story and the special effects employed in its telling were spectacular and more than enjoyable.

3933422,3,B002HEXVUI,"My 3/5 rating is NOT for the movie itself.  The movie is good and fun to watch but certainly not the best movie ever made.  The 3/5 is for the Blu-Ray release, the product you are buying.

What I don't like about this Blu-Ray release is the lack of ANY special features whatsoever.  No trailers, no behind the scenes, no commentary tracks, no interactive or web content.  None.  What you get on the main menu are 3 options.  Play Movie, Settings, and Chapters.  It's nice that they included a DVD copy as well.  It does add to the value of the product, but not enough for me to give it 4/5.

Obviously, they are out to milk Avatar for all it's worth since they will be releasing a meatier version later.  Can you blame them?  No.  It's business, and they certainly aren't the only ones to do it.  But since this is a bare-bones release at full price, then it shouldn't get a full quality rating in my opinion.  It's just unfortunate for fans of the movie who want instant gratification to have to buy the movie twice if they want to see all the extras too.  It would be nice if they just released a supplemental disc with the bonus stuff for $10, but you know that won't happen.",1274140800,,1178,4.286363636363636
3933423,3,B002HEXVUI,"I ordered this when it was first offered, pre-odered, but didn't get around to watching it until yesterday.....well, I guess I'm too old for this kind of animated movie......first, it put me to sleep early on.......started it over and in my opinion, the graphic's are fantastic, and I'd imagine the only way to really appreciate it would be to see it in a theater in 3-D.

The story however, leaves much to be desired, there barely is one.  I was reminded of so many other stories that we know so well.  There was ""Pocahontas"" and the same outrageous treatment we gave our Native Indians when we stole their land, and something seemed terribly wrong when ""our"" human servicemen were turned into uncaring conquerors who had no problem blasting away these fanciful ""natives"" for the ore that lay beneath their ""sacred tree home"".......ugh.  Somehow I missed the idea that ""we"" humans were in fact, the villains.  I don't know who wrote the screen play, but it felt like James Cameron made the small story up as he went along.  I really don't quite know what else to say about it.....but I can't agree that it deserved an Academy Award, perhaps one for art, the sets, and computer graphics were beautiful......but Best Picture?

Even if i wanted to cut down every tree and wipe out every indigenous tribe that ever walked the planet i wouldn't dislike the movie because it preached against me.  Tarkovsky could have done more with one long shot in a bathroom stall, a single hanging light bulb and a piece of duct tape, loosely based on a Fellini movie based on midgets.

It's really quite sad, this had the potential of being an outstanding movie, setting the bar for some of the best CGI ever. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie was a disaster. The only thing that kept me watching was to see more of the stunning graphics. Some of the negatives include, predictability, ( I've seen this movie before, many times before) horrendous dialog, poor character development, and throughout the story there are these interwoven politically correct themes so blatant it was enough to make one vomit. The only thing that kept me and my family sane through this thing was to make jokes and laugh at the silly stereotyping, oversimplifications,  and Hollywood, head up your butt mentality that ruled. Hollywood may still have money, and a source of great CGI talent, but where is the soul and depth of good story telling that doesn't insult our intelligence?

3933436,5,B002HEXVUI,"This review will be in two parts: Part one the Blu-Ray and Part two the actual movie - I will avoid a detailed plot synopsis or detailed spoilers.

Part one - The blu-ray package
Yes, as stated before, this blu-ray contains nothing but the movie (aside from the dvd version on a separate disk). There are no extras, commentaries, making of, nothing.
I think the price is sorta high for that. I also think they should have just packaged the blu-ray and charged less. At one store for example, I saw the DVD version for 19.99 and this version (with both disks) for 29.99. Having said that, I have to say that this movie is a joy on Blu-ray. If you saw it in 3D (as I did), liked it,  and thought you would not like it in 2D please think again. I was very pleased with the transition. The color and sound track were just outstanding. All 1.78:1. It really looks good and sounds good. So good that my wife and I became completely immersed again. Now the question is, should you wait for the extras if you intend to buy this? That depends, most of the time I don't look at that stuff so for me this was ok although I still think the blu-ray should have been packaged alone at the same price as the dvd. If you must have all the extras then you should wait for the other releases and rent this.

Part two - the movie
Ok, yes, this story has been told before in many other books, movies etc., but it still works here. If you're going to get all hung up because the ""military"" is portrayed as less than complimentary or one dimensional or because of the supposed ""politics"" (nature good, corporations bad)then frankly you won't enjoy this. After all its a movie, not real life.

The military are mercenaries and not US soldiers, and a little bit of earth/nature awareness or sympathy for indigenous people wouldn't hurt us in my opinion.  I'm a vet myself, so I have an opinion. I served with many people who considered anyone ""not us"" to be ""wogs"" or monkeys. Its a detachment that you learn to one degree or another. If you are lucky you get over it, if not, maybe you join the Mercs, I don't know.

The world building that becomes clear in this film is amazing. The common look of the animals (most have two pair of legs or arms up front and one in back) and the variety of plant life look like someone put a lot of thought into designing this world. The flying animals are so realistic. The scene where a ""chopper"" follows a waterfall down is very real. Flights of ""birds"" that from a distance look like something from African nature films. I find that about 5 minutes into the film, I'm totally immersed in it. This is the sign of a good movie for me, it's kicked my suspension of disbelief into high gear.

The plot pretty much follows the traditional hero's journey as described by Joseph Campbell, starting with the ""call to adventure"" or ""Departure"". Here, this is Jake leaving earth, and later, leaving and his crippled body when he spends his night in the forest in his avatar.

The other elements of the hero's journey we see are:

""The Initiation and road of trials"", learning the ways of the Na'vi and the subsequent war.
""The Return"" with a ""boon"", in this case finding what is important to oneself, your purpose and some redemption.

 How can you go wrong with a story like that? It's practically baked into our very nature. It resonates and vibrates though us. Add a believable visual world that sucks you in,  really good actors, and you have a terrific entertainment piece. Very well done. At my age I look for films like this to hit me emotionally and make me feel like I'm 10 years old again. This film hit that chord on many levels for me:

The beauty of the primitive strange jungle especially at night
The sky, with a large planet and other moons in it
Sailing the air over Pandora feeling the bond with my Ikran
The visual horror as a Pa'li runs from the battle injured and on fire

All emotional responses to very good film making. For me, this hit all the numbers and took 40+ years off my age for a few hours. Thanks James Cameron.

In summary I'd recommend this movie to anyone with a healthy suspension of disbelief and a love of high adventure or ""space opera"". I'm giving it 5 stars, I'd give it 6 if I could. I own it, I'll watch it multiple times.",1274054400,4,4273,4.3639798488664985

3933445,1,B002HEXVUI,"The only thing amazing about Avatar is the obscene amount of money involved in its production, media hype and resulting sales for what you would imagine a schizophrenic would experience having a stroke in a fish aquarium.
Also amazing is my overwhelming shame for having sat through most of it, and the impression of having been mentally and visually violated afterward.

The plot is stupid. It is beyond stupid. It is insultingly stupid.  There is nothing subtle about it (or anything else in the film, for that matter), and it is as if it were written like background noise for what is amounts to a a grand-Mal seizure of special effects (I will get to that soon).
The plot is so asinine it is almost amusing, but it is not. It uses every single overdone cliche and crams it into what might end up being one of the most intellectually vapid story lines of all time. The evil humans are after a valuable mineral called ""unobtanium"" (Yes...that is actually what it is called.) and the only thing standing in their way is a special effects crew on massive amounts of LSD, and obviously black people, who have turned blue, grown tails and interact with the local wildlife by mounting the enraged beasts back, wrestling with it and then shoving a tubular part of their body containing a cluster of nerves forcefully into the animal. I understand it is the future, but I know that sort of behavior is generally frowned upon and can lead to some serious prison time.
The ""natives"" are stereotypically black mixed in with some American Indian.  Their accents are Jamaican, they wear loincloths and actually chuck spears. Yes, they chuck spears and the humans (all white) call them blue monkeys. I am almost shocked at how blatant it was. When I say almost, it is clear that the dialogue and plot were conceived and written in approximately 20 minutes, probably during a particularly painful bowel movement. A lot of money could have been saved had they just put the actors in blackface, handed them spears and made them worship watermelons.
I would also like to just throw out the weird Marines vrs Navy thing going on. The blue monkey people are called Na'Vi and symbolically sodomize animals and are thin and effeminate, while the marines are stupid and insane and have superior firepower. Maybe this was unintentional, however with a dad who was navy and a brother who was marines it seemed pretty obvious. Maybe Cameron was army?
And this is the last thing I will say about the plot.  (I won't ""spoil"" it...I mean if this is your first movie ever and you have never read anything more complicated than street sign you might be in for a treat.)
I watched this with my mom and her husband (they had already seen it). I went home around 20-30 minutes before it was over, even though my mother protested that it was almost over and the ending had a decent twist. On the way home I called my mother from my car and told her that I wanted to guess what happened. I summed up the ending and got every single detail correct except for the fate of one uninteresting character who was no longer relevant after the first part of the film.
Yes, you read that right. I did not watch the end of Avatar and I still knew exactly how it ended.

And now I am going to complain about the special effects. This will not take long. I have a theory. The technology used to take the acting out of live-action film was reminiscent of old CGI technology. Jurassic Park still looks better than the blue monkeys in Avatar. While the body movements were slightly more natural, even that detail was completely swallowed up by the amount of camera shake and computer animation that made the whole film. In fact, just the absolutely ridiculous amount of special effects in every single frame struck me as though Cameron was desperate to draw attention away from his own megalomaniac egos premature-ejacula.... it also made me wish I had brought a barf bag. While it had many beautiful scenes, they were so overdone and busy, the camera angles so unnatural and the panning and shake so fast, the only way to adapt without becoming dizzy and sick is to find the stationary point on the screen and stare at it. And the novelty of absolutely everything on the planet glowing, floating and sparkling wore off really fast. The only useful application I could see for this movie would be to fast-forward it and give neurologists a cheap way to detect epilepsy.

So the movie was awful, the plot was embarrassing and the only special effect I got from watching it was nausea. The worst thing about it is that for all the ungodly amounts of money that were dumped into that movie to make it special and fantastic, it was about as much fun as being beaten to death with glow sticks.  I chose to drive home at night and was scooping poo out of a cat box by the time my mom had finished Avatar.",1274054400,8,4849,4.566666666666666
3933446,5,B002HEXVUI,"It's hard to find a movie appropriate for family viewing if you have young adults in the house.  Special effects are very cool and the whole family loved the story and went away with a message...about respecting life of all kinds.  Sure the picture is a bit harsh on developers, but it is just a story.  If you work in one of many fields, where your profession is made out to be the bad guy, then you're used to this.  I just can't rave about the special effects enough.  The animated characters are quite lifelike and very appealing.

3933461,1,B002HEXVUI,"A comic book of a movie.  Comic book vivid in color and comic book imaginative.  Those are the positives.  But the film is also comic book shallow in plotting, character development, and dialogue.  It's comic book simplistic thematically and, most significantly, comic book brutal.  Imagine Rambo and a band of like-minded mercenaries invading an Asia Shangri-La with the intention of raping that Eden environmentally and you'll have some idea of the plot.  After setting up successful strip-mining and clear-cutting operations (to continue the analogy), the grunts' time is otherwise spent in machine-gunning peasant farmers, their water buffalo and their elephants from gunships while blowing up temples with the intention of dispiriting the locals.  Hardly entertaining.  The movie ends in a long battle piece wherein the environment-loving peasantry in a mindless frontal attack (with elephants, monkeys, and eagles joining in upon realizing what is at stake) throws muscle and bone and arrows and spears against a mechanized, but lightly armed expeditionary force.  The military stupidity of the attack somehow overwhelms the military stupidity of the mercenaries, and so the mercenaries are expelled from Shangri-La in what must be one of the most hollow victories recorded on film.  While winning the skirmish, the people and wildlife of this now-heavily-damaged paradise succeed only in demonstrating how fragile and defenseless their situation is.  The words of the Terminator echo in the mind as the film ends: ""I'll be back.""  Back with some serious weaponry next time, and it won't be pretty.  I can't say whether I hated this film more than No Country for Old Men from a few years back, but if not it was close.  Perhaps because there are parts of Avatar that were so enjoyable, the wanton carnage is the more painful.  I was ready for both to end an hour before the ending came.

3933477,4,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron has meant quite a bit to me since the time I was a child.  Growing up with sci-fi epics like The Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, and Terminator 2 had a profound effect on my love for the science fiction genre, and seeing Cameron make not only a return to the genre, but to film making as a whole in his first true foray since Titanic, makes Avatar a worthwhile trip on its own merits.  Sadly I didn't get to give it a shot when it was released to theaters, missing out on drinking the Cameron kool-aid as it became the highest grossing film of all time, but now that I have finally managed to give it a look, my initial reactions are that this is nigh-epic sci-fi storytelling at its near best.  Effects-wise, Cameron has crafted something truly special.  Not just the characters and creatures, but the planet of Pandora as a whole is a living, breathing thing that must be experienced to be believed.  However, said experience would be best suited had this home video release been in 3-D like the film was and always has been intended to be viewed.  Fox is infamous for DVD double-dips, and this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack is no different.  While both versions of Avatar are gorgeous looking, all that is featured here on this set are both home video versions of the film.  No special features, nor any 3-D capable version of the film, which in itself is a slap in the face to consumers.  There will no doubt be a super special edition of Avatar in the near future, which fans and collectors should definitely hold out and wait for instead of picking this bare-bones version up.  As for the film itself, as technically spectacular as it is, it isn't without its share of flaws, most notable being the predictable brand of storytelling, stilted dialogue, and the fact that Sam Worthington's Australian accent more often than not cracks in his speech.  Still, Worthington is a star in the making (he was one of the few highlights of Terminator: Salvation), and Stephen Lang is surprisingly perfectly cast as the wicked Colonel Quaritch.  All in all, Avatar is an epic sci-fi/action tale, but don't even bother adding this bare bones release to your collection, and bide your time before the inevitable special edition is released.",1273795200,,2238,4.666666666666667

3933480,5,B002HEXVUI,"The answer might surprise you.

The film has been described as a rehash of old themes: chiefly, the collision of civilizations, the exploitation of indigenous peoples.  Yet I wonder if this is a bit like saying that music is just a rehash of  notes, or a book is just a rehash of the alphabet.  If it is fair, then it seems to me that the 'rehash' would have to include many other things, too--not only the young orphan deer vs. the thoughtless human hunters in, 'Bambi'--but also dreamer Roy Neary and scientist Claude Lacombe vs. the narrow minded Major Walsh in, 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'--along with Maria von Trapp vs. the Nazis in, 'The Sound of Music'--George Bailey and friends vs. Mr. Potter in, 'It's a Wonderful Life'--even  Joe Pendleton vs. the gangsters in, 'Here Comes Mr. Jordan' and, 'Heaven Can Wait.'

As a science fiction rehash, one would especially have to ask: how many sci fi stories have had aliens come to earth taking on human form?

Is this really a rehash of, '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Married-a-Monster-From-Outer-Space/dp/B0002I832W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Married a Monster From Outer Space</a>'?

I can only say no.  Jake and Ney'tiri waking up together in the glade of the tree of voices is Bambi and Faline waking up together only to face man entering the forest once again.  Jake praying at the tree of souls is George Bailey praying, 'If you're up there, and if you can hear me...'  Following the subtext of the history of cinema, the old stories are the palette, not the painting.

The innovation of this film is that we are the alien invaders--taking on alien form--; hence we are 'incarnations of Vishnu,' the Hindu god, or, in other words, the 'sky people' (sky people, since we are from earth--that is to say, from the aliens' point of view--from the sky): the 'avatars' (literally, 'avatar' means, 'incarnation of a Hindu deity;' Vishnu is the Hindu deity identified with the sky).  If you ask me, 'Dances with Wolves,' was the rehashed cliche.  This is something new.

This innovation serves to underscore the objectivity of truth and beauty in an otherwise pure cinematic landscape; the story hinges on the main character, Jake, gradually responding to that objectivity.  With a jaded life and a crippled body he volunteers to be an avatar simply with a, 'what's in it for me' attitude--but gradually he comes to see things from a more encompassing perspective.  You see, that the avatars were needed to 'negotiate' with the alien natives was simply one of the theories of human beings. Apparently it was not true.  The planet welcomed not only humans but avatars.  It even welcomed its technology.  What it did not welcome were pirates who did not respect the order of creation.  The audience, siding with the main character--who at first plays both ends against the middle but instead comes to completely risk his position--also comes to side with the Na'vi, who live in what appears at first to be a horrific world.  Driving the point home are the characters Tsu'tey (a Na'vi) and Norm Spellman (a human), who each overcome an envy of Jake and ultimately come together to fight by his side.  The problem of nemisis Colonel Quaritch was that the only thing he could understand or respect about Pandora was its fangs.  The gradual shift from the initial impression of a horrific world to an impression of a world of immense beauty, is the most impressive thing about the film.

I can't see how anyone would be inclined to believe that the would this movie depicts is factual, or where there is any expectation that the audience should be so inclined, e.g., to believe that there is a planet (more precisely, a moon) where the trees on it form a single and central nervous system.  What could be more clear than that this movie is pure fantasy?  But in this story--placed in perspective by understanding that it is a world of pure imagination--there is the strong suggestion, in the context of its plot, not only of rich treasures of truth and beauty in an alien world, but of a true religion which is also found there.

If the avatar hero is an incarnation of Vishnu, then Princess Ney'tiri, I suppose, is his wife Sita (of the Hindu epic, the Ramayana); yet, if one prefers, perhaps instead, she is Eve, showing Adam--after he awakens from his slumber (Gen 2:21)--the tree of life (Gen 2:9), rather than the tree, 'of the knowledge of good and evil.'  When the Sigourney Weaver character, just before she dies, declares to the male hero, 'she is real,' she can hardly be taken as having decided that men do not have souls.  Does, 'she is real,' really refer to the trees?  It seems rather she is speaking of the place of human beings in the Na'vi religion.  The film does not propose any beliefs--it simply suggests that a planet in the universe might have a true religion on it--without denying the fact that the earth, too, is a planet in the universe.  I don't see how the movie is either New Age or anti-religious, any more than it is inviting the audience to worship an imaginary planet.  The film could have had historian of myth and religion, Mircea Eliade (in his better moments), as a consultant: ""No tree was ever adored for itself only, but always for what was revealed through it, for what it implied and signified.""

The film is certainly one of the best science fiction films ever made, well on par with the blockbusters since the 1970's.  The true place of CGI in cinema also seems secure: real actors for the living movement and expressions, computers for the sets and costumes--; it practices what George Lucas has referred to--in witnessing the film's production--as using computers for, 'digital makeup.'

The film does have its flaws, notably three, I think.  The first is even a bit of a plot hole: There seems to be a lack of sense and/or offered explanation as to why the scientists thought (falsely), that in order to form relationships with the Na'vi, they needed this elaborate (not to mention expensive) avatar project to begin with.  Second: While on the whole the special effects are excellent and the film is visually striking, the Na'vi themselves, in 2D, sometimes appear distractingly fake, like masks or even cartoons.  They are far more lifelike in 3D, evidently due to richer texture, shading and shadows, for the Na'vi's skin.  This difference does not hold for the humans; it seems to me it must have been a result of an over-reliance on the 3D technology (hardly justifying the expense of 3D home theaters) as the makeup artists' eyes judged the application of the digital makeup.  Third, while perhaps intentional, there is an overall 'comic book to movie' feel to the film (which is fine), but with the result that the dialogue is at times a bit superficial.  The plot and the characters do have enough depth to support a richer dialogue, which, if provided, might have also served to avoid the first flaw.

The movie is still first rate science fiction; with these flaws corrected, it would be truly great.  I think the flaws are correctable; I also think that they are forgivable.

The story is very simple, even archetypal, but the movie is no less beautiful.

A triumph for those who have a liking for the 'blue monkeys'--you know, those odd creatures of a nearby planet simply underneath some very unusual makeup--hardly unobtainium locked away in a Pandora's box.  They live on a planet that makes both the sky and the oceans look blue--when seen from a distance--but close up, the flora and fauna come in many hues, and the grass and trees are still green.

I do still rank the blu-ray, '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth-The-Complete-BBC-Series-Blu-ray/dp/B000MRAAJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray</a>],' as superior to Avatar.

Still, it's not worth that. I agree with past reviews that the special features should have been included. The fact that they were not makes this set of standard (DVD) and HD (Blu Ray) discs so much more boring. At the same time I do have to ask, what the director could possibly have to offer me that has not been said before in Batman, Lord of the Rings, etc etc about the effects and the film/story itself? Not to much, I am afraid, until the release of the 3D edition enlightens us to the technological secrets of ""3D TV"" from a studio's perspective.

The movie was nothing out of the ordinary and exactly what I had expected for myself: blah! ""Blah"" seems to be the underlying theme and blah is what I took out of the endless struggle not get up and walk away/around during the showing in my home theater setting. Come on already, Native American themes and philosophies? I asked myself whether this was a hollywoodesque approach to a philanthropic popularity newly arising post-Costner in regards to Native Americans. Have we not Danced ourselves through the Wolves back in the 90's? The movie, and this is obviously my opinion, would have much benefited from the studio doing its homework in another native tradition, of which there are many of lesser known regions. Give me Africa, give me Laotian, give me the Philippines, but give me something. Give me something outside of ""Mother Earth""; how about ""Mother Ocean"" -- I will take what you have to offer.

""Avatar"" is, without a doubt, the very worst movie I've ever seen EVER. I'd been avoiding it since I first saw the trailer, not because I don't like sci-fi (I do), not because I don't like CGI (I do) and not because I couldn't stand James Cameron (I didn't really care about him one way or another, until now). I didn't want to see it because you could tell the plot was absolutely nothing new, that the dialogue was barely fit for a made-for-basic-cable mini series, and it was going to be three hours of agony. My husband was dying to see it, and once it was available to stream straight to the Roku as a rental to watch on our giant screen, there were really no more excuses I could make. ""How bad could it be?"" he asked, poor thing.

Ten minutes in ""Oh...really bad. Like, really seriously bad.""

I know it was cool looking, and the bluepeople and floating mountains and space-rainforest critters were all nifty, but I couldn't even give myself over to the special effects because everything else about it was so atrocious. I dig spectacle, but GEEZ can I get even a smidge of believability in my spectacle? Just a smidge? And by ""believability"" I don't mean ""oh, it's just not possible to zip your consciousness into a 12-foot alien."" I'm talking about things like ""unobtanium"". I don't care if it's an in-joke. It's completely stupid.

James Cameron has given us some terrific movies with super effects, characters you feel for, and plots (predictable though they may be) that move along nicely. This is not one of them.

""Avatar"" was a lousy rehash of every predictable plotline that ever existed, paired with the worst canned dialogue ever written. It is a stunning, shining example of what happens when you give a person exactly enough rope to hang themselves with. Written, directed & edited by James Cameron?

Sony's Blue Ray products are consistently absolute and utter crap.  The players should not need to be updated to play current titles and the constant technology updates means sometimes buggy implementations and glitchy playback.

3933496,1,B002HEXVUI,"As an avid movie collector and having an extensive collection of movies in my library (I have over 200 titles on Blu-Ray, DVD and LaserDisc), I have never been so disappointed in the quality of the content on a disc as I was with this one. I knew this was not a `Special Edition' or 3D version. (Personally I thought the 3D in the theater was more of a gimmick that was more of a distraction and took away from the movie, but that is just my opinion.) I preordered this disc and was eagerly awaiting being able to see it on my home theater setup without the distractions of people's cell phones going off, people talking, kids throwing popcorn etc. The one good thing I can say about this disc is they didn't include any of the typically annoying trailers for other movies at the beginning, so I guess that is a plus. After watching the movie and went back to the top menu, I found no bonus material. Then I thought they may have put in on the DVD, so I popped that in and realized it had nothing either. That was a major disappointment to me.

In the past when I was transitioning from LaserDisc to DVD, I was pleasantly pleased that a majority of DVD discs came with some `Bonus' content. On LaserDisc, bonus material was not very common and was usually only available on special editions because it required additional discs to store the content which of course made them more costly. When DVD came out with vastly larger disc capacity, bonus material was pretty much a given and studios began putting the time and effort into producing the DVD's with lots of bonus material.

When I started buying Blu-Ray, the trend was identical to the DVD in including a decent amount of bonus material. With Blu-Ray's huge capacity, there is absolutely no reason why studios would opt to not include any bonus material except for pure greed!

This whole notion that we (modern America) is somehow destroying the earth or that we are the cause of all the problems is complete GARBAGE! IT IS FALSE!

Plot: Pretty good, but very predictable in many areas.

Actors: Not bad, they did make you feel as if you were in the movie.

Then why the bad rating? Here's why. Some movies have an alternative motive, and normally you can continue to watch the movie and enjoy without a second thought. However, in this movie it is so blatant, in your face, one sided view; it made it hard for me even to watch the full movie. At some points I caught myself saying ""are you serious?"" This was in the part where it was said look into the memories of this dead lady and you will see they destroyed their earth. This whole notion that we (modern America) is somehow destroying the earth or that we are the cause of all the problems is complete GARBAGE! IT IS FALSE!

3933499,1,B002HEXVUI,"I was frankly, disappointed in this movie. It was alright ...the acting was fine...the special effects were good...not great but I really resented the story. It was basically a re-telling of the American Indian's story and again the ""white man"" is made to be the villain.  In the movie the US soldiers (all white) are the villains and the poor blue people are the victims until they fight back. This isn't a true account of the real history (the Indians killed whole families so they could steal their mirrors and drinking glasses) All Indians were not good and victimized and all European settlers were not all violent, bad people... This is a movie that  re-writes history, again, with the PC bend.

It was an outrage for Black American children to view their race as stupid and ignorant in movies and was one of the main complaints in the 60's. It hurt their self-esteem. It was corrected...No entire race should be viewed that way...but NOW it's acceptable for European American children (White)ato see their race depicted as bad, evil and violent and all other races are kind, gentle and humble...this is NOT accurate and it is a repeat of the same racism that has always been sold in the USA...just different players. We haven't learned anything from the freedom marches in the 60's and the way the Black Americans were treated...we've just changed the players...and racism continues...RACISTS COME IN ALL COLORS!!!",1273363200,13,1421,4.9125
3933500,5,B002HEXVUI,"I managed to miss this in the theaters and bought the blu-ray on a whim without a lot of prior exposure to the story.  My first reaction was nostalgia.  I read hundreds of books like Avatar as a child - cheap, latter-era pulp sci-fi for fifty cents out of the bargain bin at my local comic book shop.  Pages already slightly yellowed.  Deep-space marines fighting alien dragons from the door gun of their helicopter would have fit perfectly in one of those books.  They certainly weren't important literature, they weren't speaking to anything timeless in the human condition, and their plots may have been a bit thin... but they were COOL and a great way for a boy to lose himself to the world on a hot summer afternoon.  Seeing something from that genre brought to the big screen with these production values is odd.  It is as if one of them won the lottery somehow.  I think perhaps James Cameron read a lot of those books too, and liked them even more than I did.

The movie itself is beautiful.  Just like the stories it inherits from, there are a lot of valid quibbles with Avatar.  Set them aside.  Instead, revel in perhaps the most vibrant and coherent rendition of an alien world world ever, one infused with joy and beauty.  There are some dark moments in the movie to be sure, but overall the tone is one of wonderment.  The musical score is excellent and fits the visuals perfectly.  THIS is the movie I wanted so desperately when I was ten years old.

As a die-hard science fiction fan, I would love to see some of the more introspective examples of the genre get this level of treatment.  But until that day comes, there really is no choice but to marvel at the quality of execution we see here.  They have brought to life the sort of world that before could only live inside your imagination.",1273363200,5,1808,4.460365853658536

Considering that there was only a time-worn discredited political message instead of a plot and cardboard cutouts instead of characters, the film still was entertaining enough to almost rate 2 stars.

Michelle Rodriguez played her part with a laid back fatalism that pulled her cardboard character into a third dimension for a while.  The discredited political message that advanced technology is bad and environmentally destructive, that people who seek profits are inherently evil, and employ sadistic killers to advance their ecology destroying agenda, did not substitute for an actual plot, without which this movie is just a special effects showcase ending with all the innocent savages around the campfire singing kumbaya.

3933508,1,B002HEXVUI,"Okay, first of all, I'd like to say that when I watched this, I didn't have high expectations for it and even with that mindset, I still felt quite cheated when Avatar was over.  What really amazes me is that this is the biggest box office success in cinema history, even though this movie wasn't groundbreaking in any area, save for those graphics, but great graphics alone never make a great movie.  Avatar is no different from the overpriced, mindless swill that Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer, and Roland Emmerich are puking out frequently.  And what really saddens me is that this came from James Cameron, who is after all, the guy who made some of the most notable films in the sci-fi/action genre, which are Aliens and the first two Terminator movies.  For him to fall from grace like this is just saddening.  Anyway, let's break it down.

PLOT

For a movie with so much time and money spent on it, I was really disappointed with the fact that Avatar's plot is nothing more than a sci-fi themed CGI wankfest interpretation of Pocahontas and Dances with Wolves.  The film is set in the year 2154, when humans are mining a precious mineral called unobtanium on Pandora, a lush moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi--a sentient humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. A paraplegic Marine named Jake Sully is sent to spy on the Na'vi with an artificial Na'vi body referred to as an Avatar.  However, Jake has a change of heart and helps the Na'vi fight.  In other words, it can be broken down into the following simple structure.

""Bad guys send in spy disguised as one of the good guys to get information about them as to conveniently subjugate them, but spy has change of heart and helps the good guys fight bad guys.""

Sounds just like the previously mentioned movies.  If you watched a lot of movies, you can predict exactly what's going to happen as the movie progresses because this movie doing something original will throw off its balance in a fashion similar to a rhinoceros trying to give a blue whale and a prairie dog a piggyback ride while riding a unicycle.  It has the predictable romantic development with the main male and female leads, the numerous ""deus ex machina"" actions done solely for the convenience of the plot and characters, and so much other predictable and corny traits that make this movie such a bore.  A fine example of one of these many ""deus ex machina"" moments has to be when Jake (in Avatar form) manages to heavily damage a giant gunship with the Colonel (main bad guy) and as the gunship is falling down, the Colonel dons an armed mecha suit and just barely gets out of the plummeting gunship.  Of course, this has to happen because if it didn't, we wouldn't get that mandatory yet predictable ""awesome epic showdown"" between the hero and the villain.  In fact, my sister-in-law verbally predicted the said showdown as the Colonel was escaping the gunship.

CHARACTERS

Another nail in Avatar's coffin was the characters.  I didn't care about any of them because they were all so stereotypical and flat.  Sully was the ""uncertain main lead,"" Grace was the ""concerned ultra-smart scientist,"" and the Colonel was the ""tough guy 'lets kill everything' army man,"" and Neytiri is the ""sexy, smart, and benevolent native-type princess.""  None of them were interesting and morally speaking, were all one-sided.  I HATE this because I find it so cliche and simple to belt out.  I would have preferred that the characters had more complexity to their beliefs and reasoning, but we don't get that here.

THEMES

Adding themes to movies can enhance them greatly, but if they're obvious and one-sided, they add next to no value to the film.  And in Avatar's case, the themes and social commentary are one-sided and obvious.  It sickens me as to how people are bleating about how ""great"" Avatar's message is about imperialism and destroying the environment.  Though when you take the movie's theme about being environmentally conscious into consideration, it's extremely laughable because its one-dimensional nature brings it on the level of such one-sided slop like Ferngully, Wall-E, Captain Planet, and On Deadly Ground.  While I'm personally not against taking measures to benefit the environment, I cringe at the whole ""lets live in harmony with nature and take down technological progress"" notion because I doubt that people will easily give up the technology that's essential to their lives (such as houses, computers, and cars) for the sake of benefiting the environment.  At least with Princess Mononoke, it displayed the ecology message in a more realistic and complex manner.  The messages about imperialism and militarism aren't any better because they too, are so obvious and one-sided.  Of course, corporations with mercenary aid taking over other chunks of land is certainly a detestable thing, but the reasoning for it is so tacky and unrealistic.  The only reasoning behind these heinous actions is that ""the corporation needs a profit.""  What about the fact that this movie hints that Earth is low on natural resources and needs to power its civilization?  Or how about people working in the energy industry needing a paycheck to feed their families?  Of course, it has to be this simple and dumbed-down because if there was any complexity to these issues, mainstream audiences would be confused and the movie wouldn't have generated the unbelievably huge profit it got.

APPEARANCE

The only thing Avatar has going for it is the outstanding special effects and CGI used in the movie.  Indeed, the imagery is unbelievable, and it's pretty obvious as to where a huge chunk of Avatar's $500 million budget went.  I personally loved the military vehicles and weapons displayed in this movie because of the fact that I have an interest in military technology and the fact that while the vehicles and weapons were indeed futuristic, their appearances and functions were still largely based off current military technology.  Everything else looked fabulous as well since every little detail hasn't been skimped on any object, animate or inanimate.  However, I must scorn the idealistic physiques of the Na'vi because all of them looked like humanoid cat alien supermodels.  Would a little physical diversity be too much to ask for?  I guess it was another way for Cameron to show how the Na'vi have life down to a ""T"" as compared to those oh-so-evil humans.

FINAL WORD

If you want James Cameron's prime films, go check out Aliens and the first two Terminator movies instead of this (if you haven't already).  If you want the best sci-fi/action film of 2009, go check out District 9 instead of Avatar because D9, while a little overrated, has much more believable and interesting characters with much cooler action scenes with more subtle, believable messages about humanity.  D9 also had some good special effects to boot, almost as good as those in Avatar.  With all of this good stuff, you might wonder how big D9's budget was.  District 9's budget was $32 million, less than 1/15th of Avatar's.  Just comes to show that you don't need to spend half a billion dollars to make a worthwhile movie, you just need interesting characters with engaging plots.  Now if only James Cameron believed in those principles again, which made most of his films in the 80's and early 90's the classics people remember them as.",1273190400,11,7467,4.880253766851705

I mean for 20 dollars, you can get both a blu ray AND a regular dvd copy of, in this reviewers opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made.  Period.  I mean who really sits down and watches 8 hours of additional footage showing how they applied makeup and rehearsed each shot?  Speaking for myself and a few others I know, I am THRILLED that the movie was not shipped with all the extras.  I HATE paying an addional 10 dollars for a blu ray with 8 hours of extras that I would never watch in the first place.

3933517,5,B002HEXVUI,"WOW!  I absolutely LOVED this movie.  I wish that I had seen it in the theater on the big screen.  This movie was very different and certainly right up my alley with the ""energy"" component.  It has awesome scenery, gadgets, and creatures.  It's about metaphysical energy, the spirits of animals, and our connectedness to nature and each other.  It's also about the terrible things men do for greed.

There are a group of approximately 12 foot blue people who live on planet Pandora.  They live in peace with nature and the land, and live in appreciation and respect for all life forms (shamanistic principles).  They are very much in sync with the energy vibrations of each other and spiritual beings. There is a mineral that the earth wants that Pandora has called unobtanium and this grey rock is worth $20 mil a kilo.  Earth has brought a bunch of mercenary soldiers to Pandora determined to get unobtainium any way they can.

The Avatar program is earth's attempt to bond with the blue people and learn as much about them as possible, to use the knowledge against them. An Avatar body is part human DNA and part blue people.  Each program participant has their own avatar linked to their DNA, so they can interact together as one.  To activate the Avatar body, you lock down into an electronic bed and meditate out.  Then the Avatar body awakens, hence the name ""Dreamwalker"" by the locals.

Jake Sully is a young wheel-chair bound marine who received spinal injuries while fighting for his country.  His brother, Tom, was a scientist who signed up for the Avatar program.  When Tom died, the contract was offered to Jake because Jake has the same DNA (that was already linked to the Avatar body).

Grace is Sigourney Weaver, the scientist running the scientific part of the program. Colonel Miles Quaritch is running the military section and he is a tough dude. He asks Sully to get inside the blue people's heads and get him what info he needs to be able to control or conquer them and he will get Sully his legs back when Sully rotates home. (The operation is too expensive for Jake to handle alone.)  The blue peopl's village is right on the richest deposit of unobtanium.  Jake has 3 months before the bulldozers get there to befriend the blue people and convince them to move out of the way.

So, like a good little soldier, Jake heads to the dangerous Pandora forest with Grace and others.  Running from a wild beast and barely escaping, Jake is lost in the jungle overnight where he is helped by Neytiri (father is clan leader/chief; mother is a spiritual leader/shaman).  Eywa is their name for God.  After a spiritual sign, Neytiri introduces Jake to her parents and they assign Neytiri to teach Jake to be one of them.  It's really cool to watch Jake learn the spiritual oneness that these people offer.  As Jake learns from and appreciates the magnificent beauty in their culture, he begins to realize the ""war"" with the blue people is all about greed.

There is so much in this movie to appreciate.  The concepts of tying into the energy of all living things, living in peace and gratitude, sharing energy, that we are all connected and all energy beings, that there is a supreme spiritual being and spiritual helpers, the concept of taming your dragon--so much here that I already believe.  My sincerest appreciation to the writer/director James Cameron for putting this movie out for the world to see.

Even if it is all just sci-fi fantasy to you, the storyline is great!  The colors are brilliant, the creativity is fantastic, the computer graphic imaging and animation is remarkable.  I think this movie has something for everybody.  I loved it.  It's a movie that leaves you thinking about it. I know I will watch this movie many times.

2009/2010--162 minutes

Note--My son said he saw a ""making of"" special on tv.  They hired a professor to make up some words to use as the blue people's language.  The professor developed a whole new language just for this movie!  Is that cool or what!  You will see the language woven into the movie with English subtitles.

Note#2--I see where another reviewer said a lot of footage was cut out.  Not having watched it in the theater, I was not aware anything was missing. Although I am anxious to see what was cut, I loved this movie as shown.",1273017600,9,4306,4.656498673740053

 I like how they kick off earth day with the sale of these discs when they are just going to try to sell them all over again when they releases all the extended versions with extras and 3D in a few months.

3933522,1,B002HEXVUI,"This is an interesting propaganda film from Cameron.  Interesting, in how it steals the plot from several other movies (dances with wolves, pocahontas) which were somewhat decent and manages to mangle them up with the smurfs in a repulsive, vomit-inducing train wreck manner to push his retarded philosophy.

You might like this film if:
You like bland movies.
You still watch the smurfs on saturday morning.
You are lazy and believe the government should take care of you.
You believe that CO2 is evil because that's what the morons in the government and hollywood told you and you're too stupid to realize without it everything green would die.
You're a communist.

You probably won't like this movie if:
You like original plots.
You don't want to watch a cartoon version of a movie that you've seen before.
You're not a communist.
You're not an idiot.
You don't like cats much less blue cats.

  In all seriousness, even if you are not a communist or a smurf-lover, you may not completely hate this movie.  It can be appealing in a completely superficial way... much like soda.

3933523,5,B002HEXVUI,"I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD, as I'm home bound, and I couldn't go to the movie theatre to see it. Sure, I know there is supposed to be an even better version of the movie coming out in 3-D, and that it will have a lot more extra stuff on it, but for people like me who have been waiting to see even what the movie is like, I give it my own 2 thumbs up.

This movie is so brilliant! I love Sci-Fi movies, so this movie just blew my mind! I can't believe that they originally started working on the script for this movie in 1994, just waiting for technology to catch up with the ideas and vision of Mr. Cameron. I'm glad that they waited to do this film right. The colors in this movie are really amazing too. My parents got to see this movie in 3-D at an IMAX theatre. Neither of my parents like Fantasy movies, but my Mom just kept going on and on about this movie. If it looks this awesome on my old beat up TV, I can't even imagine how awesome it must have been in the theater's.

I give this movie, even without all the ""Special Features"" and everything, a full five star rating that the movie itself deserves! If you haven't seen it, you are really missing out on a special treat! My advice, see it as soon as you can!",1273017600,11,1246,4.0
3933524,5,B002HEXVUI,"Yes, there are no special features on this Blu-ray disc, just the movie along with a DVD copy.  Not surprisingly, the blu-ray version is quite a bit better than the DVD standard definition version, even when the standard definition version is up-converted via a Blu-ray player.  Too, this is one of the best blu-ray movies I have seen - some blu-ray movies are not as clear and crisp. I like having a DVD copy, since I live alone and am the only one in the family with a Blu-ray player, I can let other family members borrow it to watch.

On the Blu-ray version one is warned that a firmware upgrade to their Blu-ray player may be necessary in order to play it.  It worked fine on my VIZIO model VBR110 Blu-ray player but I have seen complaints that some older players will not play Avatar without the firmware upgrade.

Anyway, those wanting more Avatar content may want to wait for the special edition or collector version to be released.",1273017600,9,940,4.5058823529411764
3933525,4,B002HEXVUI,"First off, it should be said that this movie does not have ANY special features. I don't so much mind that, because I only watch them once or twice anyway. However, if you are a big fan of getting a behind-the-scenes look at what goes into a movie, then you WILL be disappointed. In that case, save your money and wait for the big release in November.

If you are like me, however, and just want to see the movie for all that it is, you will not be disappointed at all. This blu-ray movie is absolutely the most gorgeous piece of cinema to ever grace a television screen. The whole film is shot in a 1.78:1 ratio (more commonly referred to as 16:9), so there is no letterbox when it's viewed on an HDTV, a welcome change that puts even The Dark Knight's excellent blu-ray disc to shame. The sound is amazing, as well. A word of advice for those coming into blu-ray: get a Surround Sound set-up. With the technology behind blu-ray discs and HDMI cables, surround sound has reached an entirely new level.

I won't get into the story of the movie, because, quite frankly, it's not important. I'm sure James Cameron realized that when he was creating this movie. You will spend more time gawking at the screen, wondering what is and what isn't CGI. It's all blended so seamlessly in an absolutely stunning way. For a cinematic experience, you can do no better than Avatar on blu-ray.

The same cannot be said, however, for the DVD. Without all the bells and whistles, Avatar really cannot stand as the epic it is made out to be. It is a decent story, but the real impact of the film lies in its visuals and sound. You have been warned.",1273017600,,1631,4.394039735099338
3933526,1,B002HEXVUI,"If what everyone is saying is true, I will just wait for the next release. I know the goal of a business is to make money, but it's still frustrating that they would pull this kind of thing with a movie like Avatar. Practically everyone on the planet bought a ticket to see this, how about not trying to squeeze more cash from fans by releasing one edition, and then a few months later release the ""super super special"" edition. Just release one disc and be done with it. Let me guess, the super duper version will come out around Christmas time. Just a guess",1272931200,2,559,4.333333333333333
3933527,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar was a great film, there's no doubt about that.  This was one the best productions of all time which was reflected in box office and media sales.  I found the movie to be extremely enjoyable, fresh, and revolutionary with remarkable replay value.  However, this review focuses on the quality of this 1st release BD version.

True 16:9, no ""gutterbox"" bars:
To my surprise, the movie is in full 16:9 (1.78:1) ratio so no black bars at the top and bottom of your widescreen. The vast majority of us don't own a 100+ inch super wide projection studio so this format allows you to enjoy every viewable pixel of your plasma/LCD/DLP.  Personally, I would rather utilize the entire screen than sacrifice nearly half of the display to see a few extra Pandoran trees in the background.

Resume technology:
This BD disc has an incredible and revolutionary technology that will literally remember your position in the movie (has resume capability which is extremely ultra super freaky rare).  This ""resume"" feature comes in very handy for a movie that is nearly 3 hours in length.  I never understood why the vast majority of BD movies lack this feature, seems like a common ability that every VHS tape and DVD was capable of providing and yet so very few BDs will remember your last location. Perhaps the majority of BD releases are intentionally programmed to force the viewer re-watch all the trailers every single time they turn on their player. Fortunately, this BD doesn't punish you, it was made for your enjoyment!

Trailer free:
We all know how incredibly frustrating it is to be forced to wait or manually skip through hordes of previews/trailers every time you load a disc but this BD disc has none and boots directly to the movie menu (no promotional spam to skip/wait though)!! You don't even have to deal with the traditional copyright protection screen that forces you to let it run its course as it seems to have been completely excluded (not like we didn't already know that bootlegging was illegal anyways).

No extras:
This BD release was completely free of any extras which probably contributed to the remarkably reasonable pricing. Some may find this as a negative but I virtually never access the extras menu, probably < 1% of the time and it's usually just for the deleted scenes. I loved Avatar but I'm not a fan boy of the movie or the actors/actresses.  I don't want to know how they did the special effects nor do I care to hear how the director constructed such and such prop, in doing so they would spoil the ""magic"" of the movie. I intentionally avoid the extras for this very reason. I want to revel in the shock and awe of the refined production and not break down the behind the scene mechanics of it all. If this disappoints you, don't worry, I assure you that they will release a ""special edition"" with your favorite actor's commentaries for twice the price down the road.

Bargain pricing:
This 2010 initial release bundle includes the DVD version of the full movie in addition to the Blu-Ray movie.  You can sell the DVD for $10 or more, just as I have, and the BD with case ends up being under $10 from Amazon!  That's an incredible bargain for one of the most incredible movies of modern times.

I wish every BD release was modeled in this fashion for they went above and beyond with this Avatar BD and polished it to what I consider to be perfection.

Movie: 5/5
Value: 5/5
Quality of the BD picture/sound: 5/5  (quite possibly the best to date and reference quality)
BD features, menu, layout: 5/5  (what every BD should strive provide to end-users, simplicity & speed yielding high entertainment value)",1272931200,15,3639,4.69496855345912

The audio is great, too.
There is no need to review the story or the performances---this is one movie where you either like it or you don't, and most people have already seen it in theaters anyway, so the question boils down to whether or not you would like to have your own personal blu-ray copy to watch on your own television.

3933532,1,B002HEXVUI,"Lets face it. It's just like everything else we deal with in life, the good and the bad, the dark and the light, the Right vs. the Left, the truth and the lies, when everybody is right, and everyone is wrong, It's just the same old politics we've dealt with all along.  This movie takes the worst of a great thing and has it defeating the things that kept them from growing and surviving as a people.  Through out all of history the discovered are the conquered, it has always been that way and so it will remain.  Lets just hope that here on earth we are not discovered any time soon, lest we become the Avatar, and the mysterious interconnected thinking forest is actually our power grid, all communication as we know it would shut down.  In all seriousness though, what being would attact a gun ship with a bow and arrow?  That will surely get you a feather in your head dress. While I'm thinking about it I recall just last week when I had a visit to the local stock yards and watched as they processed beef, the guy that was pulling the trigger on the MOO-DEER was also 'Thanking Them' and telling them they would now become part of mankind.  He didn't bother telling them about also being stuffed into a dog food can or streached across a sofa to forever support someones big fat ass in the name of mankind!  The movies story line could have been better.  Instead of staging a scene where a superior force is moving in to fulfil it's needs with tactics that were used at places with names such as Ma-Lae, Waco, and Northern Iraq. Marines are our Son's, Brother's, Daughter's, Sister's, and more.  They will stop at nothing to finish thier mission.  Was it the Marines, or maybe they where just a repersentation of the U.S. Calvary when our country was moving westward, growing up
to become the good old U.S.A.  This film could have been made using a loose adaptation of how the mean old U.S.A. stole Alaska from the poor misguided cashstrapped Russians.  The U.S. did pay a modest price for Alaska, VERY modest.  Who are these people that made this film, some Communist
Marxist lovers that hate this great land that we negotaited for with the Native Americans?  You know, the same people that had this great land for generations and the only natural resorce they found was the Buffalo.  Don't you know when a buffalo was brought down, I'm sure it was thanked, but then it had to be drug or carried back to the T.P. because the Native Americans never invented the wheel.  Just like in the film, the Avatar where shown dragging their sick and injured away on wheeless skids.  It was something to see when the forrest attacked the marines.  I was amazed at the tricks one could train those wild creatures to pull off, must have started when they where pups, something in their dog food must be extra special for them to act in this way.  Could be that mankind stuff that was packed into every can before it was brought from EARTH.  Probably the United States of America, because isn't that what is really being attacked here anyway?
My Wife, 19 and 23 yr old Daughters and I watched it in Blu-Ray a couple of nights ago.  I thought the special effect and sound where of stand out quality, my wife hated the movie almost as much as I did, and she is a liberal.
Both my Daughters loved this flick and I know they would like to see it over and over, but my wife wisely loaned it to her Mom (with my blessing) and I hope I never see it again... ever!

3933535,3,B002HEXVUI,"First, I'll start with the obvious:
  I saw Avatar in 3D as I know millions of others also did, and I have also watched it at home in 2D since it's release on DVD/Blu-ray. At the theater, to me it was visually incredible and I had not seen anything like it before. It was an acid trip without the acid. 2D at home was naturally not as stunning visually however the colors and scenery were still brilliant to take in.

The substance, or lack thereof:
  The characters were flat. Despite spending nearly 3 hours watching this movie, I never saw a great effort to develop the characters in the story, save for the protaganist himself. The antagonists were predictable; invade, conquer, harvest. Essentially the idea of the villians themselves was derived from the American settlers arriving to the new world as occurred in American history. The Navi (the natives in the story) were essentially derived from the Native Americans who were treated so poorly by the settlers.

Everything seemed all too familiar, then it dawned on me...
  I was essentially watching Pocahontas, Dances with Wolves, and Fern Gully all mixed into one. The basis of the story could be linked back to elements of all three of these movies. The only real difference here was that the story has been spun by being set in a different location/time and then camouflaged with over-the-top (but I'll admit, gorgeous) visual effects.

Aftermath:
Avatar is being tagged now as ""the number 1 movie of all time"" on television ads for the DVD/Blu-Ray releases it. And by that they are only referring to its gross revenue at the box office because it is definitely NOT the #1 movie of all time.

Bottom line:
  Watch it for the visuals because as I said before story isn't all that original. So, do I regret seeing Avatar? Definitely not. Did it raise the bar as far as what future movies will have to be in order to be great? Definitely not, except for maybe Avatar's one saving grace...our beloved visuals.",1272844800,3,1968,4.705539358600583

What I don't get is the Avatar hype.  Like I said, I think Avatar is a ""good"" movie with good characters and a good story.  What it is NOT though-is original.  If you've seen Ferngully, Battle for Terra, Dances with wolves, Pocahontas or even (to a lesser extent) Return of the Jedi, the story is basically the same.  It's also pretty predictable.  There's really not a lot that's ""new"" here or surprising.  How this fairly by the numbers movie has become such a phenomenon is beyond me.  I enjoyed it sure, but I don't get the massive obsession.  I can think of several much better movies in recent memory (Batman: Dark Knight and Iron Man for instance) that are more worthy of their success.

3933545,3,B002HEXVUI,"This movie came out in 2009 and was written and directed by James Cameron. It stars Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Saldana, Michelle Rodriguez, Sam Worthington and Stephen Lang. The film is set in the year 2154. Humans have discovered Pandora and are mining a precious mineral, unobtanium, from that world. Continued mining, however, threatens the Na'vi, the native, sentient humanoid species that inhabits Pandora. Avatars are the genetically engineered bodies that are used by the scientists to interact with the Na'vi. The movie begins with us learning that Jake Scully (Worthington), who is paralyzed from the waist down, has been selected to replace his brother in working one of the Avatars.  On a mission while he is in the Avatar, he is separated from the group and has to spend the night in Pandora, alone. While doing so, he meets Neytiri (Saldana), a real Na'vi and begins to form bonds with the Na'vi that are threatened when the mining colony seeks to expand into the Na'vi spiritual grounds and culminates with an epic battle.

I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this movie.  I mean, James Cameron has blockbusters mostly because he knows how to pull on our heartstrings and resolve things in a way that makes things feel ""right."" So bravo to him for exploiting psychology I guess but, in my opinion, some of the best movies are the movies that don't always resolve in that psychologically fulfilling manner. I found that the story line was really predictable, from the very first moments when you learn that Worthington's paralyzed character is set to become an Avatar and my predictions ended up being correct most of the time - like 99% of the time.  I found myself thinking ""here's what's going to happen now"" and it did.  The characters weren't very memorable either. For instance, Sigourney Weaver came back to work with Cameron as Dr. Grace Augustine and I saw traces of Ellen Ripley (perhaps Cameron's MOST memorable character).  They were flat and unoriginal and totally not memorable. So in that sense, I wasn't very impressed.

I was very impressed by how the movie looked. It was a beautiful movie to look at. And the effects were literally out of this world (no pun intended). So in that sense, I was drawn in and my attention kept, not because the story was so wonderful but because I literally wanted to see more of what the engineers could come up with.

This movie, while somewhat entertaining, was not worthy of an Academy Award nod for best movie. Renting may be the way to go, but reserve judgment on whether you could buy it until after you see if you can deal with the predictability.",1272844800,3,2628,4.76043956043956

Also heard that certain LG BD players also suffer from the same DRM conflicts, and perhaps some Pioneer machines were affected as well.

Samsung ultimately issued another firmware update about a week later, and yes it worked to cure the problem. But what was the point of bothering with the DRM in the first place? Pirated Blu Ray copies abound across torrent sites, so useless and futile was the DRM strategy set in place at doing what it was supposed to do. All it instead did was agonize any number of longstanding, legit Blu Ray owners, and foster ill will for a week or so for a number of us Samsung owners.

I HATE DRM. You should too, especially since it DOESN'T WORK (in so many ways, including in its intended purpose...stopping piracy).",1272758400,8,1431,4.712

3933548,1,B002HEXVUI,"So is this the best selling movie of all time?  Well it is certainly the most over hyped and overrated movie of all time.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy good science fiction movies, but this is nothing more than typical Hollywood social commentary wrapped up in a long and boring melodrama with unrealistic and drawn out action scenes.

The social commentary becomes paramount to the movie and prevents this from being any more than a simplistic storyline with stereotypical characters who have unimaginative roles.  There are no suprises here.  No unexpected turns or twists.  It almost verges on satire.  The movie is supposed to be futuristic, with complex technology, and sophisticated technological operations on planet Pandora.  You would think it would require humans with specialized training sophistication as well; yet the guy running the robotic bulldozer is portrayed as some redneck in in his flannel shirt and baseball cap.  The evil money grubbing corporate guy is dressed in a present day shirt and tie, practicing his golf skills in the middle of the operations room.  T-shirts, present day military outfits, bows and arrows?  Futuristic?  Give us a break.",1272758400,95,1178,5.1421052631578945

3933550,1,B002HEXVUI,"Well well well, haven't we seen all this before? Doesn't it all seem a bit familiar? This movie is a complete rip-off of the revisionist clap-trap that won 7 Oscars back in 1990. Yes. You guessed it. Dances with Wolves. If you compare this movie almost scene by scene, you will discover that Jimmy C did a complete rip off job when it comes to the story. This is nothing more than a very expensive New Age Mother Earth sermon, a manipulation of the senses to steer the unsuspecting toward a future political/spiritual belief where the masses will not mind in the least when Third World populations are purposefully depleted through sterilisation, among other things, to help poor wee mother-earth survive us big bad mean humans boohoo! The tree-huggers in this movie are all so good and the humans are all so bad, except for the ones that become the tree-huggers along the way. There is so much to say about the demonic side to this movie, but alas it is so blatant, it should remain needless to point out. This will do for the beautification of Satan, what George Lucas's Star Wars did for making God into an impersonal force in the mind of Man, a force that no one will ulimately be accountable to. Hell is full today with people screaming, ""But I thought the Force was going to be with us!"" Yet another fantasy of lies and deception created by yet another Cosmic Humanist denying the truth about Heaven and Hell by whittling it all down to people ""borrowing energy"" and having ""to give it back"" to the One source mumbo-jumbo. So bottom line. 1 Star for the animation, pretty, blue, shinny, aawwh! But all in all, a complete rip-off of DWW, and the same old lie whispered into Eve's ear back in the Garden: ""You too can be as God..."" But given the feed back I've heard, pretty effective occultic propaganda thrown at a world without the eyes to see or the ears to hear.

3933551,1,B002HEXVUI,"I am so glad I did not waste my money a see this in the theaters.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  With all the hype and good reviews, I really expected something I could sit through without checking the clock every 5 minutes.  This movie is terrible.  It has to be one of the worst written scripts in years.  This is saying quite a bit considering all the dribble that has come out recently.

The storyline is very derivative, predictable and filled with so many holes that you can drive a big rig through it.  There was absolutely no backstory.  All the characters are one dementional, unsympathetic and derogatory on both sides. No twists or turns to keep you interested.  I agree with an earlier review that this makes the Star Wars prequels look like masterpiecies.

I've a big fan of SciFi and fantasy movies.  I love most of James Cameron's works.  He could do much better than this and has with the Terminator, Titanic, Alien and the Abyss.  Mr. Cameron, please, hire a good script writer to at least review work the next time you through a quarter of a billion dollars at an eight year project.",1272758400,18,1120,4.512437810945274
3933552,4,B002HEXVUI,"Having seen Avatar on the big screen, I was a bit concerned that the impact would be diminished when presented without 3D goggles, and on a small screen.  I was wrong; Avatar still retains its ability to wow and enthrall, despite the smaller format.  Those who have not seen the movie yet, be warned that the box implies that you have already done so.  That being said, there are elements of the plot that will be familiar to any who have ever seen Fern Gully or Disney's Pocahontas.  Much of the impact of this film is the stunning visuals, such as the aptly named Hallelujah Mountains, bioluminescent night scenes, and of course the wonderfully rendered blue Avatars.

 Personally, I was terribly disappointed to find no special features included with the movie in the DVD format, as I always love seeing deleted scenes and whatever else is included.  We have been told that Avatar is James Cameron's brainchild, ten years in the making, but there is no talk from him about the development, or any of the behind the scenes digital wonders.  On the plus side, there are no ads for other movies to get through before we get to the desired content.  If nothing else, the minimalist nature of the DVD release is an indication that Cameron really thought of this as a movie for theatres, and best seen in 3D.

 Overall, however, I would say that it was lovely to see Avatar again, now that I can't dash into a theater and grab some 3D goggles for the original effect.  This really is one of the most visually stunning and gripping movies of recent years, capable of producing some of those moments of wonder akin to stepping through the farmhouse door into Oz.  Colors are more vibrant in this world, animals are different, and blue has never looked so good on people as it does in Avatar.  Even without a widescreen TV, or blue-ray, I was drawn in to this world, and could still sense the vertigo of large vistas, and generally feel jealous of the characters that got to be there in the film.",1272758400,4,1990,4.553370786516854

No one likes to be wrong but in this case it's A-ok! Great story line, fantastic characters, and its amazing how they made them all seem so real. Pretty cool in my book.

The soundtrack sounds quite a bit like the ones for Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan and Aliens.  It's probably the same composer.

And how many times have we seen this story already?  Whether you call it Pocahontas, The Emerald Forest, Dances with Wolves, or something else, it's the same deal:  Indigenous people live in harmony with nature; rapacious invaders arrive to plunder and kill; natives fight back; someone from among the invaders goes rogue and goes native and turns against his own people once he sees the error of their ways.

Great story line... Beautiful exotic scenery.  I watched the 3-D version in theater.

As a result, I jumped in and bought the DVD when it first came out in April.  To my surprise, the color quality was greatly disappointed.  The rich vibrant colors of the forest, of those exotic creatures were replaced with a dull, boring color.

If you plan to buy the DVD, maybe you should wait until the next version released in November.  I don't know if the blue-ray version is any better.

Well, right out of the box the Blu-Ray disc refused to play on my Sony Blu-Ray player, so I watched in on the DVD in my Blu-Ray player.  This was a great special effects movie, but the plot became a little silly with Sigourney Weaver playing some chain smoking Doctor (a chain smoking environmentalist/psychiatrist? gimme a break) with an attitude trying to learn the culture and language of the 10 foot tall blue aliens on Pandora, all the while trying to keep the evil corporation and Marines from upsetting her noble and environmentally and culturally sensitive efforts, kind of like some of her last episodes in Aliens. The hero turns out to be a former Marine Corporal who is paralyzed from the waist down, but under some kind of futuristic MRI like tanning bed device gets transported to Pandora sub-consciously and becomes an Alien clone with full use of his legs again, replete with the HDMI like tail for linking into the flora and fauna and other aliens in Pandora to communicate with the ""soul"" of the other beings.  His mission is to learn the natives cultures and language.  In the process he has to deal with a cornucopia of bizarre creatures, some of which are like flying Pterodactyls, Triceratops and giant panthers and wild dog/hyena creatures and other assorted gruesome beasts, kind of like a Jurrasic Park redux. In the end, the evil silver haired, buzz cut Marine ""Gung-Ho (Ooh-Rah!) Colonel (who works out daily and is a one man destruction force) leads a large invasion force of futuristic hover craft flying machines with massive fire power to lay waste to the aliens sacred grounds and the former Marine Corporal leads an uprising (Shades of Dances with Wolves), who after horrendous losses and unimaginable environmental destruction, finally prevail. I think I am beginning to see a trend here coming out of Hollywood.
Oh, and I forgot to mention, the former Marine Corporal falls in love with the daughter of the alien chief who is already spoken for by a fierce warrior alien and the has to prove himself and does so by taming the largest Pterodactyl Godzilla like creature and wins her heart and they ""mate"".  Meanwhile his earth body is dying, but gets given emergency air by his alien lover and then through some kind of super natural ritual by one of the alien shamans, his earth body gets transformed into the clone body.",1272672000,3,2447,4.734741784037559

But on cool thing to check it out if you have a DVD player and a BLue Ray and a HD TV check out  the HUGE difference in picture quality between the 2 DVDs it is night and day.

For any DVD and BLueRay distributor that reads this. Special Features should ALWAYS BE part of ANY MOVIE Released on DVD and Blue Ray. ALWAYS !!!!

IF the Avatar Ultimate Edition is coming out in NOvember (and that is why FOX hold back not giving on this one the Extra bonus) the correct way would be to have added the Special features in this release of the Avatar and on the Ultimate Edition you would have the 3D version Option and additional Behind the Scenes features maybe some extra special programs on the Making of Avatar that I saw on TV.

It may be worthwhile for some smart legal folks to help put together a class action suit against Sony and whomever who keeps forcing failures to occur with older Blu Ray players. This change of DRM that creates havoc for earlier investors of blu ray players is just excessive greed and more than unethical.

Casettes, Audio CD, VHS, DVD all are easily defeated in the attempts to archive by owners their data - blu ray will be no different. This attempt by changing DRM at the expense of the very audience they sell to is pure abuse.

So let's see - owners of Blu Ray Players may not be able to play future Blu Ray Discs due to changes in DRM and inability to ""update firmware"" is BAD BUSINESS.

So lets see - Studios are double dipping into the consumers pocket by re-releasing later (intentionally) extended additions or more valued copies (whether improved quality, features or material) is BAD BUSINESS.

The movie itself is a work of art, with an incredible level of creativity and beautiful design/ornamentation to stretch anyone's imagination.  The 3-D effect, through parallax (humans perceive 3-D by both binocular vision, for near objects, and parallax, for more distant objects)is the best I have seen.  The theme is also highly relevant to our times.  The expressivity of the actors is beyond comparison, certainly real, and enhanced by the technology used to produce this.  I really look forward to an expanded version of this blu-ray in the future, if one is forthcoming.  I have heard a popular story line related to the lack of an original story or character development in this, and it is just gibberish.  I can see how the film would be viewed as a threat to traditional Hollywood filmmaking, however.  I have seen 'Hurt Locker' that won the Academy Award for best picture, and it is a good film.  The single theme and unidimensional character of that movie was simply this:  obsession with dangerous work.  In contrast, Avatar has a great deal to say about native cultures that are close to nature (e.g., stone age cultures) in general, exploitation of resources by technology-driven societies, and the mystery of life itself.  It will make you think about the mystery of incarnation.  This is a deeply thoughtful production, a fact that should not be missed as you follow the carefully written action/adventure story line.  The theme, and the artwork, bear a signature that is unique in the history of filmmaking.  Also, if you don't already have a blu-ray, DVD-upconvert player, this is the best reason to get one now.",1272585600,18,1757,4.905084745762712

The movie has a touching story that induces thoughts about the fragile nature of our Earth while evoking strong emotions regarding the characters in the film. Cameron is a true visionary and his ideas come together fluidly leaving the viewer in complete awe. This film should turn heads without 3D, but when you add the 3D aspect to it there is a clear jump into the timeless classic category.

Go buy a 3D tv, 3D Blu-Ray player, some 3D glasses and this 3D movie and you will not regret it.

The movie IS long and I DID get pretty restless towards the end but the story itself hooks you and pulls you into the movie. The acting is amazing, the story line is interesting, the action in the movie is amazing, the effects and the graphics were also amazing!

A story of two creatures from two completely different worlds finding a way to see passed their differences, their missions and to help each other.

3933577,3,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron's best picture-nominated sci-fi epic 'Avatar' has finally hit Blu-Ray, and it has brought quite a lot of controversy with it.  But we'll get to that in a minute.

The film itself needs no introduction.  The $2.7 billion it has grossed worldwide speaks to the fact that most people have probably watched the movie already.  Suffice to say it won't win any awards for story or originality, but James Cameron has created one of the deepest worlds ever put to film.  'Avatar' really feels like an experience rather than a run-of-the-mill movie, and I'll argue that it's an experience everybody should have.

On Blu-Ray, 'Avatar' is utterly gorgeous.  'Star Trek' is widely considered the best Blu-Ray on the market today, but if we're going strictly off of the technical aspects, 'Avatar' at least gives 'Trek' some heavy competition for the top spot.  The colors of Pandora are just as vibrant as in the movie theater, perhaps even more beautiful because the brightness isn't lessened by a 3D presentation.  And I've watched the movie with both a surround sound setup and basic built-in TV speakers, and it sounds amazing on both.

But there is a major catch.  Actually, there are two.  Consider them both before dropping the cash for 'Avatar.'

1. Bare-bones doesn't even begin to describe this Blu-Ray.
  You're literally paying for the movie (in both HD and SD), some studio logos and a basic menu.  No special features, no trailers, not even cast and director profiles.  This is strictly 'Avatar.'
  James Cameron has been quite open about the fact that there will be another edition of 'Avatar' released in November, with five or six minutes of additional footage.  It will also no doubt contain a plethora of special features, which are sure to be very interesting considering how Cameron actually made this movie.  If any of that sounds interesting to you, then pass on this one and wait until November.

2. This isn't in 3D.
  I'm extremely critical of the use of 3D in movies.  It limits filmmakers and drives up ticket prices.  But, there's no denying that seeing 'Avatar' in 3D was a wonderful experience.  It's the best 3D we'll see, perhaps until Cameron makes another movie.  He made 'Avatar' with 3D in mind, and it shows in the film's theatrical presentation.  If you loved the 3D in 'Avatar,' just remember that it won't be the same on a small screen in 2D.  And yes, it will eventually see a 3D home video release, but you'll need the technology to support it.
  That said, the Blu-Ray release is beautiful, and it actually surprised me how much I didn't miss the 3D.  Pandora is vibrant and immersing enough already, and although you'll notice the difference, this release of 'Avatar' proves just how unnecessary 3D is for the experience.

It would be very easy to criticize 'Avatar' for its inevitable double-dip release, but Cameron hasn't exactly hidden the fact that we'll be able to buy it again.  Normally I'd cry foul at an obvious cash cow like this, but this isn't secret or underhanded.  Anybody who knows the nature of film studios and their DVD releases will know to at least Google these things before dropping $19.99 on a single Blu-Ray.  Anybody who doesn't know to do so should get in the habit of researching their home video purchases, because it's important to make sure you're getting what you want.

In closing, buy this version if you don't care about special features or extra footage.  It features a beautiful transfer that will not disappoint.  But that's all.  If you want more, then wait for November.",1272585600,,3558,4.805280528052806
3933578,5,B002HEXVUI,"This is one of the most beautiful movies you will ever experience watching. The story line is wonderful. the world of pandora is very intense with bright colors, animals and vegatation. the navi are very unique looking but the 1:78:1 aspect ratio does wonders to bring out the nice blue texture of their skin. James Cameron did a wonderful job with this movie and has made pandora a place where all who have watched it would have wanted to visit. James cameron has just raised the bar in what it means to make a movie. I think that this is definately worth watching and anyone who doesn;t watch this movie is robbing themselves of one of the greatest experiences that will ever come to bluray. The romance that is build up in the movie is truly one for the ages, even though it was brief it could be felt through out the entire movie. james cameron and all who help make this movie possible, job well done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1272585600,10,924,4.538922155688622
3933579,5,B002HEXVUI,"After reading the pre-reviews of others, I had decided to wait for a future release before buying this movie. I glad that I didn't! This is by far the best release that I have seen in Blu-Ray. The picture quality is far superior to any other Blu-ray release that I have screened on my system. It is truly motion picture quality (of course, not in 3-D).

The soundtrack is 5.1, but you won't be disappointed even if you have a 7.1 system. The sound is pure, and discreet with excellent separation without sounding contrived.

Honestly, I was stunned after watching (and listening) to Avatar in Blu-Ray.

You may have to upgrade the firmware in your DVD player to play this release. I have a Samsung BDP3600 Blu-ray Player purchased this past fall and I still had to upgrade the firmware. The movie takes a long time to load, longer than other titles I own, but after it does...WOW.

I haven't looked at the second disc of extras (not Blu-Ray). Will report back when I do. But for now, this is a MUST BUY, if you are into Blu-Ray, home theater, surround sound and of course the movie, Avatar!",1272585600,8,1090,4.48989898989899
3933580,3,B002HEXVUI,"It is really the plant life of Pandora that is especially interesting, far more so than the wooden marines trampling about over it. The electrified, phosphorescent flora and fauna are a real visual treat. As are the Na'vi themselves, elegant creatures. They prance and slide with glee, preforming feats of gymnastic wonderment with feline agility. The floating mountains they traverse are vast, impeccably-rendered. They hulk through the sky like rocky zeppelins, admirably vast and colorful. The human element of this story is, unfortunately, its undoing. The characters, from the cigarette-smoking boss lady to the paraplegic marine protagonist to the suit-and-tie antagonist hellbent on harvesting Pandora for all its natural deposits (a black element named absurdly ""Unobtainium"") are fairly stock and not especially interesting, especially when set against the gorgeous back-drops. The film, thankfully, diverts a lot of attention away from the dirty humans to showcase more fully the life of the jumping, arrow-slinging Na'vi in all their rich azure glory. There is a fairly convincing love story too. I won't dwell too much on the story, only revealing it as an allegory for the destruction of a natural environs at the hands of heartless humans. In this area, it succeeds, though ultimately it is pretty heavy-handed. (Tree of Life, eh?) Really though you aren't going to see it for the humans, you are seeing it for the creatures, the scenery, the effects. They are as amazing as you would expect. Sometimes I forgot, really and truly, that what I was seeing was made by some techies in a basement somewhere. It pops, fizzles, glows like the jungle mushrooms that illuminate when they are pawed by passing interlopers. Visually, a real treat. Story-wise, we've seen it before. Still you will be wowed, even if your expectations are sullied by the hype (my definitely were). This is a protracted trip, to be sure, but it is worth taking if you dig sci-fi.",1272585600,,1963,5.1375

  Mountains can't float, people can't be 10 feet tall (their knees, ankles & feet would snap).  They can't be as dense and stronger than humans and fly on the backs of aerial creatures.  In fact giant creatures can't fly!  Look up pterodactyl.  Lame...Cartoon land.  Physics is physics.
  The whole ""Dances w/wolves"" on another planet is so 1990/1890.  After two weeks of camping in the woods I can't wait for my hot shower.  I love my toilet, soap and hot water!

3933583,5,B002HEXVUI,"I suppose that by now, everyone who is even remotely interested has either seen Avatar or heard about it, so I will dispense with the synopsis or any run down of the plot. I just have a few things to say about Avatar, Director James Cameron (self-proclaimed ""King of the World""), the true worth of Sam Worthington, Giovanni Ribisi, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, and the lovely and vivacious Zo Saldana.

-----------------
Selfridge: This is why we're here: because this little gray rock sells for twenty million a kilo.
====================

First, Avatar deserves every bit of its popularity and massive box office. It had the dazzling special effects, thrilling action, and steamy romance of the blockbuster, but it also had thought provoking concepts, a subversive political message, and compelling characters and story. When director James Cameron won the Oscar for Titanic, and Titanic won for best picture, I cringed--especially when he quoted Leonardo DiCaprio's line ""I'm the King of the World!"" It was adding insult to injury--rubbing salt in the wound. Not that Titanic was a bad film, it was just that it seemed like it swept all the awards except for acting and writing--as if those contributions no longer mattered. You could have a best film without the best acting or writing. I confess I felt a backlash to all the success it garnered, and I wanted it to lose. I don't care for Celine Dion, either, though I do admit that she has monumental pipes and can really belt out a tune. Perhaps I am a pretentious snob who looks down on anything that achieves such mass popularity (don't answer that)?

But I do try to keep an open mind, and Avatar really won me over. I would have been happy to see it win either Best Film or Best Director. I didn't see The Hurt Locker, but if James Cameron and Avatar had to lose, that seems like the best alternate choice. First woman director, and Cameron's ex-girlfriend? James Cameron seemed very gracious about losing to her, and I find it very easy to forgive his hubris about Titanic now.

------------
Dr. Grace Augustine: [to Jake, just before he connects to his Avatar] Just relax and let your mind go blank. That shouldn't be too hard for you.
==================

Avatar did something very difficult to do, and that is, it made you feel more connected to the blue people of Pandora then you did to your fellow earthlings. It was like a Western where you were rooting for the Native Americans to triumph over the cowboys. The tree huggers instead of the loggers. You rooted for the Marines--to lose! And it appealed to the masses. The Avatar concept no doubt helped, as when Jake Sully connected to his Avatar you saw the world through the eyes of the Na'vi.

------------
Jake Sully: Everything is backwards now, like out there is the true world, and in here is the dream.
===============

Sam Worthington was a really good choice to play Jake Sully. While channel surfing I briefly watched a segment on a sleazy papparazzi show like TMZ and the 'photo journalists' had nothing but good things to say about Sam. He was very down-to-earth, and humble about his recent good luck in starring in two major blockbusters: Clash of the Titans, and Avatar. Before his big break I saw him in an Australian film called Somersault that fans of the young Mr. Worthington might find interesting. In Avatar he brings a lot to the quest of Jake to become a ""taronyu,"" or hunter, even if it was done with mostly motion capture, CGI, and blue screen. He's no skxawng.

------------------
Neytiri: To become ""taronyu"", hunter, you must choose your own Ikran and he must also choose you.
Jake Sully: When?
Neytiri: When you are ready.
========================

Zo Saldana, as the Na'vi woman Neytiri, also does a great job of acting that shows through all the special effects. She is a very intense actress, and also an extremely beautiful one. She is Nyota Uhura in the new Star Trek! Michelle Rodriguez, Sigourney Weaver, Giovanni Ribisi, and Stephen Lang as the quarrelsome Colonel Quaritch really made Avatar work.

The Bottom Line is Avatar is a game changing milestone in the history of cinema. Great special effects and dazzling 3D, yet it didn't sacrifice characters or narrative on their unholy altar. I loved the scenes of Jake and the Na'vi warriors riding through the sky on their Ikrans. And Sam Worthington and Zo Saldana are the cutest blue couple since Di Caprio and Winslet froze.

---------
Neytiri: You are Omaticaya now. You may make your bow from the wood of Hometree. And you may choose a woman. We have many fine women. Ninat is the best singer.
Jake Sully: I don't want Ninat.
Neytiri: Peyral is a good hunter.
Jake Sully: Yes, she is a good hunter. But I've already chosen. But this woman must also choose me.
Neytiri: [smiles] She already has.
[They kiss]

3933584,1,B002HEXVUI,Over a week after I got this BD disk I still cannot play it in my Sharp player.  Also there are scenes that were in the theater release that are not on the disk (I watched the DVD).  This is the last BD disk I will ever buy!,1272585600,2,224,3.6458333333333335
3933585,4,B002HEXVUI,"First a quick paragraph about the movie itself. Is the story in ""Avatar"" familiar?  Sure.  But it's done well, and sharpened by several unique characters, fascinating details, and a handful of unpredictable moments.  And exciting action.  Lots of exciting action.  Oh, and I liked the playful subversion lurking just under the surface: while we're quickly told once or twice that the soldiers on Pandora are mercenaries working for a private company, the visuals clearly tell us otherwise.  This is an occupying American military force, at a place where they have no business, taking on the role of the bad guys.  Hey, maybe it was a little unfair to do that (maybe), but it was gutsy on James Cameron's part to construct his story that way, a story for a big blockbuster movie, no less, not some small political art-house film.

Anyway, now that that's out of the way, the main reason I'm writing this review is to tell you about the DVD, as people everywhere have pretty much already seen this movie and have decided whether they like it or not.  I'm here to tell you that the good old standard DVD of ""Avatar"" looks spectacular.  It's one of the most cleanest, sharpest transfers I've ever seen.  In many ways it's even better than the 3D version of ""Avatar"" seen in theaters, because as good as the Cameron's 3D process was, there was still a little inherent-to-3D murkiness here and there that sometimes inhibited the sharpness.  Here things are sharp and clear from beginning to end.  And because the movie was composed as a movie first and a 3D movie second (there are no cheap ""comin at ya"" shots), I found that I didn't even miss the 3D while watching the DVD.

So, if you're hesitating to buy the standard DVD of ""Avatar"" because you're worried that only the Blu-Ray version or the future 3D Blu-Ray version of ""Avatar"" will do the film justice, there's no need to worry.  This will tide you over just fine.",1272585600,,1917,4.663690476190476
3933586,2,B002HEXVUI,"First, let me say that the special effects were incredible, stunning, eye-popping, etc etc etc. I can't even imagine how they can do all that and make it look so real. I was very glad to have Blu-Ray.

But having said that, what was left of the film? A cliche-ridden comic-strip sci-fi of the old school that was actually laughable in parts. Here we are, in some distant future, in a world where ""Gyrenes"" talk and act straight out of a Rambo movie. The dialog was ridiculous -- and could they get the guns any bigger? Naturally, the end had to come down to a showdown between hero and supervillain (and, gee, who is going to win????)

Take Dances with Wolves, throw in some reruns of The A-Team, stir with a smidgen of Terminator and video game robot war machines -- give them all a good dose of steroids -- and voila, you have Avatar.

The worst part was that, in a film purportedly rhapsodizing the goodness of a simple peaceful people living in harmony with their world, the victory goes to the side who can kill the most of the ""others."" Well, ain't that an enlightened message?

Such a disappointment.",1272585600,7,1107,4.492537313432836
3933587,4,B002HEXVUI,"First the problems:  Stripped DVD - the movie that was ALL there was.  Not one single extra.  There was no reason for a menu.  The movie and whether you wanted it subtitled or not.  That was IT. I had pre-ordered this DVD and therefore had no idea it wasn't going to have anything on it at all other than the movie, and that is why I am displease extras was still pending - and for that reason, the fifth star is lacking.  I will return this and re-purchase it when the release with the extra 40 minutes comes out; an entire sub-plot was cut to make the movie shorter and in my experience, anything cut from a James Cameron movie should not be cut - look at The Abyss; the part cut explained so much, without it, the alien's motivation didn't make sense, there was no reason without that missing few minutes.

The fifth star will appear when I obtain the release with more than just the movie - and I had no advance warning that this was just the movie - the movie is 5+ stars, the packaging of it, without the omitted material, particularly the missing 20-40 minutes of the movie, will be 5 stars.

And now the positives, which are self-evident, but I'll talk about them a bit:

As far as content is concerned; It is a brilliant movie.  James Cameron's gift is to take the important messages and put them in a package that the masses who don't CARE about issues will go and see - and nonetheless without being aware that it is happening, will they, nil they (i.e. ""willynilly"") pick up the message.  Abyss has the same issues; Our inability to take care of the planet, our violence, how we are destroying the planet, our lack of evolution; how backward we are and insist on remaining, mired in violence, racism, ethnocentricity and stupidity -  unable to value the important things, unable to value our planet.

Hiyao Miyazaki does the same thing and his work is all wonderful as well, message movies - dressed in stunning anime, drawing in audiences who otherwise wouldn't watch a ""message movie.""  The same gift, and many of the same issues.

Unfortunately very few want to hear a genuine analysis.  I've tried to talk about the real content of things; on Amazon? It's an invitation to get trolled.

With respect to this movie, all anyone wants to talk about is tech and the special effects; and yes they were stunning and Cameron had to wait 11 years until the technology was sufficiently advanced such that he could make his vision possible.

And so, yes - a lushly stunning visual experience.  But... for me, the face that he melds the important issues with the admittedly stunning ""eye candy"" that everyone wants to see is his genius.  Most go for the visual experience and the effects, but can't help absorbing at least some of the message; and in that he does a great service to and for all of us.

Of course it was done this way in order to release a later edition with extras; but I find this practice reprehensible, as it's all about getting more money out of the consumer.  I wanted those extras, and I am sending this copy back - and I'll wait until I can get one with the extras I wanted to see; with a movie as brilliant as this one (and yes, I do mean the plot also, Cameron's gift is in taking important messages and packaging them in effects such that the masses - everyone who wouldn't go to a ""message"" movie, do come to his movies.

In that sense it was like Abyss, and many of the same (almost all of the same) messages.  I love Avatar, but I truly wanted more, not just the movie, but with an event such as this one, there are so many ""extras"" - I wanted all of that, and got nothing.",1272499200,2,3608,4.382882882882883

You will not find Avatar on my List.

Hey, great CGI does not a great movie make. And Avatar certainly has some of the greatest CGI that I've ever seen. But let me see if I've got this storyline correct: Basically there's this moon or planet inhabited by The Blue Humanoid People. The Blue People have hair-in-a-ponytail that can connect to various living organisms that literally connect their minds to the extent that The Blue People can control the organism; okay, kinda cool.

But The Bad Humans (us) want to take over The Blue People's Moon/Planet/whatever in order to harvest some energy-rich resource. So The Bad Humans clone some Blue People, and via some magic machine that allows a human to take over the cloned Blue Person, The Bad Humans can put a spy into The Blue People's society in order to find out where they are and what they're up to. The human has to be asleep to take over the mind of the cloned Blue Person and the cloned Blue Person must be asleep whenever the human is awake. Okaaaayy.

Now the really good part: When the cloned Blue Person is introduced to the Blue People's society, he is for all intents and purposes immediately accepted...to an extent. Then he becomes more accepted and as predictable as ever, likes being a Blue Person more than a human, turns double agent and of course gets himself some Blue Person tail (pun definitely intended).  Uh huh.

And The Bad Humans get really bad: The leader of the expedition makes a decision in a vacuum outside whatever human government control there is, and as advanced as human civilization has become for whatever year this is supposed to be, is allowed to commit genocide on The Blue People with the help of a military-type commander that is even more extreme than the expedition leader. Ahhyyyye don't think so.

Oh and by the way, they're gonna take 2 hours and 40 minutes to tell the story. But heck, what do I know? The movie was number 1 at the box office for weeks; it's the number 1 selling DVD for weeks; if you try to rent it on Netflix you'll be a grandparent by the time it's available and the movie was up for Oscars and stuff. And I'm another sucker...see that at the top of my review where it says Amazon Verified Purchase? Ugh.

Look, with all my sarcasm aside, it's a relatively good movie and I was moderately entertained. It's just that all the hype, hoopla and hub-bub had my expectations set for so much more. So if you have the patience, wait for Netflix or cable. Avatar is not a collector's item.",1272499200,3,2971,5.063394683026585
3933591,5,B002HEXVUI,"I did not see Avatar in the theaters and waited for the Blu-ray release; this is my usual pattern. Having been a science fiction fan for over 70 years I was curious to see what this movie would bring to the genre. Frequently movies that are hyped to the extent this one has been hyped can be, to some degree, disappointing when viewed. This one was consistent in that regard but to a lesser degree than I had feared.

Having never seen it in 3-D I can, nevertheless, see how it was produced to serve the features that 3-D offers; many scenes present objects that move toward the viewer in a manner designed to provoke a reaction from the 3-D viewer. This does not, in my opinion, interfere with the enjoyment of the movie in 2-D.

My overall reaction to the movie is favorable in many regards. First is the interesting idea of the avatar; this idea has surfaced in sci-fi, but not often in my experience. The second is the idea of the sentient planet which has been used much more often; this version minimizes the proactive nature of that sentience by comparison with other sci-fi stories. Thirdly the picture quality and audio quality are both outstanding as are the much touted special visual effects.

If I were to identify some flaws I would have to mention the rather prosaic, stereotypical characters that occupy certain supporting roles in the movie. The short-sighted, narrowly focused corporate manager character has been done far too often; Sigourney Weaver's character in Alien had a corporate antagonist cut out of exactly the same cloth. The tough, driven, mercenary commander's character has also been used to the point of annoyance; they were some of the evil straw men set up for the audience to hate.

The tough mercenary soldiers were similarly designed to generate audience revulsion. Devices such as these are manipulative and I would have hoped this movie would rise above such simplistic alternatives. I would say that such choices as were made in this regard can be understood and overlooked if one can accept the basic premises of the movie in general. Some of the battle scenes were reminiscent of ""Star Wars"" but were suitably bombastic. It may be a propaganda piece as some have pointed out but that is fairly easy to overlook.

I have watched the movie twice now and actually enjoyed it more the second time. A lot is happening fast and I would say it will take two viewings at least to begin to absorb all that is being displayed on the screen. The scenery is fascinating in its detail and provides the viewer with many interesting backgrounds; it is evident that a huge amount of work went into creating the movie and the planet Pandora.

It appears that many who bought the disc have had problems viewing the movie. Blu-ray is a technological marvel but it does require some tender, loving care; most importantly Blu-ray machines can, and should be updated with the latest software. In this regard Blu-ray players are more like computers than the DVD players of the past. I have two OPPO players which are both capable of playing the disc; they are both connected by an Ethernet connection to the web and inform me automatically when an update is available.

I would strongly suggest that all of those who are having problems avail themselves of any updates that might be available from the manufacturers of their equipment. Updates can usually be made from a network connection, through a USB input, or from a disc. For those who are disinterested in technology it may be wise to have a knowledgeable friend help with setup or hire someone to do the necessary setup; this is a problem that won't go away if ignored. If, on the other hand, the manufacturer is not providing the needed updates, or the player is obsolete and cannot update, then that is another problem entirely. If you find yourself deciding to get a new Blu-ray player, may I suggest the OPPO BDP-83; I am looking at one as I type this and can recommend it highly. It is available from Amazon and will play Avatar.

By way of summary, this is a disc worth having; some have complained it does not have extras and that is true but for $19.99 one can enjoy the movie now at home and then, should one desire, treat one's self to a Christmas present when the ""Ultimate"" edition comes out.",1272499200,7,4283,4.663576158940398
3933592,5,B002HEXVUI,"""Avatar"" on Blu-ray is absolutely amazing, the picture is truly incredible! This movie is quite an experience the first time you see it.

I own alot of Blu-rays, nothing comes close to this picture quality!

After seeing the movie in 3-D in the theater, I knew the Blu-ray dvd version would be great. I was also happy with the fact, that although this version doesn't have all the bells and whistles (extra footage, special features and trailers) that the extended DVD versions due out later this year will have, the Blu-ray does come with a regular DVD. Which has been great for me, because I've been able to lend it out to my friends, so they can enjoy it along with their families. Personally I would not have wanted to wait until the end of the year to see ""Avatar"" again. This is the highest grossing movie ever, a worldwide phenomenon, if it turns out that the extended Blu-ray dvd is that much more amazing then this version, I'll buy it again.

If you haven't seen this unbelievable ""epic"" movie, do yourself a favor and watch it on Blu-ray ASAP!

*** By the looks of reading the other reviews here, seems that some older Blu-ray player models cannot play ""Avatar"" without a firmware update. I do find that pretty ridiculous, not that the dvd requires an update of the Blu-ray player itself, but that they don't give consumers buying this at the store a fair warning. I would be extremely upset, if I purchased ""Avatar"" only to find out that I couldn't play it. This is noted at the top of Amazon's page however, good on them for that. My player is around six months old and had no issues playing the dvd. If your unsure, you may want to rent it first on Blu-ray!

""Avatar"" is the future of movies and I'm looking forward to more....

However, the creation of the world of Pandora, the Na'vi, the creatures, the vegetation (especially the giant tree) and the battle scenes are simply so unbelievable that they're believable, if you know what I mean.

And so to Avatar, this film will be the benchmark for many things. Testing ones home theater (Mine's a Panosonic 5.1)out for the myriad of sounds from various creatures, machines and other noise making events as they jump around the various speakers and hit you from all directions. Or perhaps to showcase your plasma screen TV such as I have (46"" Sony Wega) at its ultimate best. Or even that Blue Ray player making it all happen (Mine's a Panosonic Digital Twin Tuner). Whatever your set up is, this movie will make your system/s give up their absolute best and leave you wondering if what you have is an awesome set up or maybe time for an upgrade.

To the movie itself. Well I ignored the pre release blurb/hype. I wanted to judge it for myself. I loved the Abyss and I loathed Titanic. I found myself watching a cross bewteen an action story, a love story, a conservation story and even a dry humour story. I don't know what Cameron had to do to satisfy the purists whom seem less than enamored by this film, but for me the 162 minutes took me to a place where I want to go even if it is dangerous. It took me away from the real world. Isn't this what Cinema is all about? To tell a story? And Science Fiction can take you to places that may exist as but far as we know it, is currently only in one's imagination. I really don't know where the time went. There were no slack bits, the romance delicately handled, the action at times ruthless, and the conservation theme very much there.

I felt the actors gave it an awesome effort and that Cameron's direction ensured that the amazing effects did not over shadow the actors in the fore. I mean there's plenty going on in the background yet the fore ground still keeps your attention. Being on Blue Ray, I was also able to pause, get up and have a look at something in the background and be amnazed at the indepth details.

The musical score was consistant and a pleasure that helped enhance rather than distract. The total package is well wrapt together. Weta workshops did themselves proud and as a New Zealander, I am very proud of their work done in studios not 25 miles from my residence. I don't know anyone whom worked on this film, but I wish I did. I shall have to remain a proud New Zealander and dream of one day visiting Pandora.

3933604,5,B002HEXVUI,"I too look forward to the 3D release of Avatar, but realize that the technology and standards are not quite ready, and decided to pick up the Blu Ray for my brother and I to watch together.  We had both seen the 3D version in the theater some months back.  We watched this edition without interruption on a Mitsubishi 73 inch DLP with 6 channel surround, and found the experience nothing short of stunning.  We actually agreed that the presentation on Blu Ray seemed to have more impact than the original 3D theatrical experience. The combination of a very strong story, impeccable special effects and cinematography, and very high quality transfer, seemed to be the reason.  For anyone doubting that Avatar was a 3D gimmick, they will have no doubts once they have seen this release.

To top it off, the studio provided a Standard Definition copy along with the Blu Ray, something that contradicts the accusation of taking advantage of the fan.  At a price of barely over $20, this release has to rate easily as the best deal I have found yet in a Blu Ray release (of which I buy relatively few compared to regular DVD).

It seems to have become fashionable to bash a studio for ""milking"" their product at every opportunity, and no one criticized the release of the Lord of the Rings Blu Ray set more than I did, but the similar reaction by many to this release amazes me.

Can I wait for the ""extended 3D edition""?  Absolutley not, and this in no way compares to the Lord of the Rings example.  First, the producer is faced with considerable online piracy if he does not release the film sooner rather than later.  Second, no fan has yet seen an ""extended edition"" so the comparison is invalid.  Third, many fans will never buy the 3D version anyway, so why prolong the release of the regular Blu Ray version.

I for one will instantly buy the extended, 3D version when it becomes available, but this will not be for everyone.  I highly recommend that any fan of the movie pick up the Blu Ray and enjoy the original theatrical experience again in the highest quality Blu Ray release that I have yet seen.",1272412800,16,2106,4.537037037037037
3933605,4,B002HEXVUI,"""Avatar"", the largest-grossing movie of all time and has cemented James Cameron's status as a writer and director who has been able to surpass his original box office record with his 1997 film ""Titanic"".

Created with an outstanding budget of $237 million, needless to say that James Cameron has laid it all on the line with this film.  It would become a financial disaster or a goldmine.  And sure enough, ""Avatar"" has become the latter.  The film has grossed over $2.7 billion and with this Blu-ray and DVD release, during the first two days of its sale, it has sold over $5 million copies.

Needless to say, this is the easily James Cameron's masterpiece.  Avoiding anything that resembles sci-fi kitsch with the use of its CG and becoming just eye candy, ""Avatar"" is a fantastic film that deserves to be seen and this is coming from a reviewer who was more than caustic towards this film before reviewing this Blu-ray release.

VIDEO:

""Avatar"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:78:1) and is the true definition of reference quality video.  Detail and colors are just amazing.  The close up of the CG work looks so realistic and are so remarkably detailed that it looks as if Cameron and crew have achieved CG perfection.  You see skin pores, the application of the pain on the skin, the sweat glistening on the characters.  How do they do that?  There is amazing detail in land of Pandora as each step and each touch produces this light around a plant or surrounding and the colors just glow and look fantastic in HD.

And it just doesn't stop there.  There is detail everywhere.  From the mecha vehicles that Spec-Ops command, the large vehicle units, the creatures on Pandora are shown with a large assortment of colors.

This is the best looking film on Blu-ray that has come since the first release of Blu-ray discs.  I know this is a statement that is hard to believe especially with so many fantastic reference quality releases on BD but ""Avatar"" has set the bar up high of how gorgeous a film can look on Blu-ray.  Incredible!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Avatar"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English Dolby Surround, English Decruption Audio, Spanish, French and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital.  And you think that ""Avatar"" has raised the bar for picture quality, the audio for ""Avatar"" is equally fantastic!

Immersive.  This is the word I describe this film as the DTS-HD Master Audio lossless audio track takes control of your soundscape and sound is coming from the front and center channels, surround channels are active throughout the film. May it be the forest ambiance, creatures rustling in the leaves, large animals heard flying above and of course, the pulse-pound action as the LFE is fully engaged.  Expect your subwoofer (and literally all channels) to go on over-drive as the film, especially during the second half of ""Avatar"" makes those scenes come alive.  The vehicles flying and the rotors blowing the trees, missiles firing and causing destruction and trees falling everywhere and the scream of the Omaticaya's as they are losing their home.

Again... Incredible!

As for subtitles, ""Avatar"" is presented in English SDH, Spanish and Portuguese.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Avatar"" does not come with any special features but more than likely we will see a ultimate edition coming out later this year.

EXTRAS:

""Avatar"" comes with a slipcase and a DVD version of the film.  The DVD is presented in Widescreen 1:78:1 and Dolby Digital 5.1, English, Spanish and French Dolby Surround.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When ""Avatar"" was released in theaters, I admit that I took a caustic approach to the film.

It's not that dislike James Cameron films because I have enjoyed many of his films but it deals with my feelings of technology and films infused by CG that the more I see a sci-fi film utilizing it to the nth degree, I look at these films as becoming kitsch.  Granted, I'm not expecting the return of thousands of talents and epic filmmaking along the reigns of D.W. Griffith's ""Intolerance"" but when I saw the trailer for ""Avatar"", I was sensing CG eye candy ala ""Transformers II: Revenge of the Fallen"".

With so many films being released on 3-D (which I have been told that ""Avatar"" must be seen in 3-D), in some ways, I just want to watch my movies straight.  It's not the 3-D that makes me excited, it's the good ol' fashioned form of cinema.  But with today's technology, for a sci-fi film, I'm expecting a beautiful scenery in this new world, unique characters, good acting, well-paced and a well-written storyline and most of all, because it's James Cameron who has raised the bar with ""Titanic"", I expect the best and not sci-fi kitsch.

Of course, ""Avatar"" has gone on to breaking records and fan anticipation of the Blu-ray and DVD release are high (despite the first release being barebones) and upon receiving my review copy, I admit that I was curious about the film.  What will James Cameron bring to the big screen in terms of character development, storyline and what message does he have for the viewer.  Without it becoming an all eye candy film.

Well, let's just say that after I watched ""Avatar"", I was blown away.  Yes, ""Avatar"" is eye candy but it's pleasing eye candy that has a strong storyline behind it.  Films such as the ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" films have been able to take the viewer and let them believe they are away from reality and you know these worlds.  That is why so many decades later, people still know the settings, the surroundings of these films and the same can be said about ""Avatar"".

Like those films that will forever be etched in the minds of movie fans, ""Avatar"" will do the same as people will remember the lush world of Pandora, it's creatures but most of all the Na'vi.  Technology is to the point where creatures or other life forms do not need to don a rubber suit or wear excessive make-up to make one think that being is from another planet.  Somehow the wizards were able to take the likeness if Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Zoey Saldana and make the characters of Jake Sully and his avatar, Neytiri and Dr. Grace Augustine come alive.

The detail of this film is amazing.  On Blu-ray, it's fantastic!  The detail and vibrant colors come alive in full effect.  The characters on both the human and Na'vi side are believable and the acting is not forced.  I admit that very early on the film, I thought about the character of Jake Sully (and no offense to Sam Worthington) but we were going to get something similar to Channing Tatum's Duke (""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"") and deal with a character that was concerned about his own virility and place as a soldier on Pandora but that is not the case.  Worthington's Sully is a man is a disabled man who has found new life using his Avatar, the ability to take part in lifestyle of the Omaticaya, embrace it and find love with Neytiri, the planet and its inhabitants.

The chemistry between the characters of Jake Sully and Neytiri is natural but works extremely well.  And for fans of James Cameron films, to see Sigourney Weaver in ""Avatar"" is a nostalgic blessing.  She may not be as forceful as her character of Ripley in the ""Alien"" films but her role as Dr. Grace Augustine was well-done.

In fact, I felt the movie and it's pacing for a longer film was well-done, the viewer is immersed in the world but also gets to see political corruption and greed come to play and how Cameron is able to work this film and make it exciting and believable underneath all the CG is quite amazing.  What the ""Star Wars"" films were to me back in the late '70s and early '80s, ""Avatar"" was a film that captivated my attention throughout its 162 minutes and made me appreciate what sci-fi films today can accomplish (granted, not many films will ever get the budget that Cameron was able to achieve with this film).

But as this film has received mostly positive reviews, I was surprised to read ""Salon"" critic Stephanie Zacharek's opening paragraph of her review.  Zacherek writes, ""The problem with taking 15 years to bring audiences the future of filmmaking is that someone else is bound to get to the future before you do. And while there are certain technical effects in James Cameron's ""Avatar"" that aren't quite like anything we've ever seen before, the movie is hardly a historical event, or even a grand achievement. It is  a very expensive-looking, very flashy entertainment, albeit one that groans under the weight of clumsy storytelling in the second half and features some of the most godawful dialogue this side of `Attack of the Clones'.""

I disagree with Zacharek's comment of the movie is a grand achievement.  The film has broken box office records worldwide and now has its place in the record books as the #1 earning film in the world.  Granted, for critics...many probably didn't think early on that James Cameron could repeat his box office success that he did with ""Titanic"", let alone beat that record with a sci-fi film.  But he did and if that is not an grand achievement, I don't know what Zacharek was expecting. Even if you remove yourself from the earnings, the CG work is amazing.  The cinematography is amazing and just the amount of detail on the characters at this time is phenomenal.  And when you think about its competition during the Oscar year, ""Avatar"" was deserving in winning ""Best Achievement in Art Direction"", ""Best Achievement in Cinematography"" and ""Best Achievement in Visual Effects"".

She goes on to say that the film was under the weight of clumsy storytelling in the second half and like many sci-fi films, there must be action.  You know early on that there is a war coming between the humans and the Na'vi.  It's expected, it's going to happen and yes, you are going to lose some of that emotional connect through those sequences.  And the ""godawful dialogue"", I did mention this earlier on in my review that I felt that the character of Jake Skully was getting near Channing Tatum's Duke but for ""Avatar"", it works. Skully is introduced in the beginning as someone completely opposite of his intellectual brother and it shows.

But similar to Zacharek, I was surprised that ""Village Voice"" critic J. Hoberman would feel the same about the second half as well.  Hoberman writes, ""For the first 45 minutes, I'm thinking: Metropolis!--and wondering how to amend ballots already cast in polls of the year's best movies. Then the 3-D wears off, and the long second act kicks in.""

I found the comment to be quite interesting and for the most part, I can see where Hoberman is coming from in comparisons of both films.  Where the Fritz Lang epic featured a man from the upper-level associating with and underground woman in which the underground has been subjective to corporate corruption to its highest level, I see the connection but at the same time, comparing ""Metropolis"" and ""Avatar"" is comparing apples to oranges.  Where both films feature a revolt, ""Metropolis"" denizens have lived their monotonous life the same every day and are not warriors.  In ""Avatar"", the Na'vi are losing their homeland, their planet is being destroyed and they have either the choice to give up and move to another area or fight.  And what kind of film would ""Avatar"" be if we watched these warriors being displaced?

The second half needed that battle and like ""Metropolis"", where Freder joins Maria in the grand fight, Sully joining the Na'vi was just right!  That battle needed to be epic and for an audience who have sat that long at the theater for something grand to happen, this was their pay off. Yes, the film is pragmatic but for a sci-fi film, it works and definitely not kitsch.

So, I came away enjoying ""Avatar"" much more than I expected.  The Blu-ray delivered in picture and audio quality.  Special features are none but similar to ""Sin City"" which came out with a near barebones DVD release was then given a magnificent Blu-ray release much later and it's expected the same will happen to ""Avatar"".  I am sure like the video releases of ""Titanic"" and ""Terminator 2', Cameron has a lot of planned for the upcoming ultimate or special edition of ""Avatar"".  This release was just to satisfy the masses who have enjoyed the film and definitely looks and sounds incredible in HD.

I know many people may hold off until the better version of ""Avatar"" is released on Blu-ray but for now, if you want to enjoy ""Avatar"" now, you can.  James Cameron's ""Avatar"" is the best looking film on Blu-ray since the release films on Blu-ray disc.  Although, this is not the ultimate release of ""Avatar"" and does not include any special features, in terms of picture and audio quality alone, ""Avatar"" has not only broken box office records, it has raised the bar on what perfection looks and sounds like on Blu-ray.

Highly recommended!",1272412800,8,12829,4.735254389914453
3933606,2,B002HEXVUI,"Well, everyone else has weighed in on Avatar, I suppose I should too.

I might as well get the obvious out of the way first. Visually it is very well done. Granted you could get the same thing by watching a cut scene in a modern video game these days, but no one really plays those for plot now do they? I had utterly no desire to see this in 3D. From what I could tell, that was more of a marketing gimmick than anything else. When they come out with a psychological suspense/thriller in 3D, then I will spring the extra 4 bucks for it. Untill then... I'll pass on action flicks in 3D.

Plotwise... oh dear, where to begin?

With regards to the story, this movie needed a huge injection of background material. Jake, the main character, is paraplegic from serving in some war or other (it's never explained). The corporate and military antagonists are hunting for some rare mineral, but the audience is never told what it does or why it's important and worth so much to the Terrans. In the absence of such background set up, the conflict between the Terrans and the native Navi of Pandora seems overly simplistic. It's a shame because I would have liked to see more complex villains to go with the pretty visuals.

For the main good guys, if you like anti-colonialism stories, or conservation minded stories, you will probably like them well enough. It's just that in more than a few places, the ""OMG pretty pictures!"" seemed to take priority over story elements. That and the romance part of the tale was faceplamingly predictable. I was okay with and liked most of the protagonists overall, although I kind of wished that more of Jake's interaction with his human cohorts had been expanded upon. I wonder if he started to withdraw from them while getting to know the Navi.

It is rather like Dances with Wolves... but with a double shot of Zulu to go with it. It kind of makes me wish that they had opted to adapt Anne McCaffery's Decision at Doona instead (it also has cat people aliens in it).

I should't have been concerned, the movie is stunning (MUCH better than the theater 2D experience), and this is on a 32"" 720p HD LCD.  For 20 bucks how can you go wrong?  It costs five dollars more at the local W*****t.
I knew there weren't going to be any special features (it really wasn't all that hard to do a little homework in advance) and like many other reviewers I didn't care.  In the past when I've watched how the CGI effects were done it took some of the fun out of the movie.
I just wanted the best possible home experience I could get without 3D and I wasn't disappointed.  Simple plot?  Well yeah, but again, who cares?  There is still a meaningful message with lots of incredible visuals and fun action scenes --- a great escape movie (when I want more substance I watch something like ""The Secret Life of Bees"").

nothing will compare to the IMAX or 3D you saw in the theater.

3933611,1,B002HEXVUI,"I was going to write that Avatar could be put on the blog Stuff White People Like under the heading ""romance with exotic natives,"" but really isn't there so much more to Avatar... like a big battle!  So, instead, I'll just point out that while others have noticed that Avatar seems like a remake of other movies like Dances with Wolves and Aliens, you can see elements from other movies/scifi here, too, like Dune and Robotech.  But I really see Avatar channelling Jurassic Park.  Unlike the Star Wars prequels, in which the special effects were overhyped, Jurassic Park took moviegoers by storm because the movie was so unexpectedly successful at creating realistic primeval beasts to hunt people in the jungle.  Avatar pretty much has the same feel.

So, you're James Cameron.  Maybe you're watching Rebecca Romijn in X-Men and thinking how you'd like to meet her in Second Life.  Then you come up with the idea for yet another Sigourney Weaver Alien film, but this time with sexy blue aliens instead of ones with exoskeletons: Avatar.

How do you make Avatar?  Hmmm... think, James, think.  How about re-staging the Battle of Endor from Return of the Jedi and create a Dances with Wolves backstory to explain why the rebels are allied with the Ewoks?  No, seriously.  You just make the Ewoks giant blue humanoids like the Zentradi from Robotech and make the stormtroopers look like the marines from Aliens. (But hey that works out really well, because Giovanni Ribisi looks sort of like Paul Reiser and acts like him, and Sigourney Weaver's already in the movie--what a coincidence!)  Then you set the battle in Jurassic Park instead of on Endor.  Wait, isn't there a space battle in RoJ in addition to the Ewok battle?  No problem, there's pterodactyls in Jurassic Park, so the Zentradis can fly them just like the kids in Dinotopia, and the marines can have a big triangle mother ship like a Star Destroyer that's going to blow up the home base if it's not stopped in time, just like the Death Star in the original Star Wars.

And of course it's important to make the battle manipulate the audience the same way, so the good guys have to start winning in the beginning, then you have to change the music and make the bad guys start winning and show the up close deaths of a few beloved minor Ewoks, errr, Zentradis, errr whatevers.  Then the hero has to have a show-down with his arch-nemesis, just like Luke and Darth Vader.  But they can't have light-sabers, so you have to give them giant knives.  Okay, I think that about covers it.  Oh, wait, the Zentradis are really big in addition to being blue, so how will that work?  Well, in Robotech, the people made giant robot suits so they would be the same size, so we can do that, too.  Plus, if we steal the cargo loader from Aliens for the robot suit, it will be just like when Sigourney Weaver fought the alien at the end of Aliens, and Sigourney Weaver's already in the movie--what a cool coincidence!

Okay, we can make lots of money with that, but how do we set it up?  Hmmm.  Let's just rip off Aliens again with the whole deep-space cryogenic sleep/mining colony thing.  That'll work great.  And the main character can meet the Jurassic Park Zentradi, fall for Robecca Romijn, and eventually become ""one of the tribe,"" just like Dances with Wolves.  The only thing is, how to turn our human into an alien?  Let's look through our shelf of scifi DVD's... hmmmm... oh, yes, The Matrix.

Andrew Lloyd Weber, your 'Phantom of the Opera' was not only a musical phenomenon, it is now considered a way of life.

Last but not least, James Cameron. Terminator 2 and Titanic. Thank you for those, although the dialogue in Titanic was childish between Jack and Rose. What were you thinking with 'Avatar?' I got upset when I saw Pocahontas, Blue Man Group, and drag all over this piece. I could have thoroughly enjoyed each art form separately, without having to listen to silly nonsensical mumbling and utterance.

Sigourney Weaver! Please leave 'Wizard of Oz' out of this mess! On the red carpet you claimed that it is the new 'Wizard of Oz.' If anything, I think you need to go see a Wizard!

3933617,5,B002HEXVUI,"Let me come clean right up front here, so opposed to the hype surrounding Avatar was I that I literally refused to stand in line with the drones that flocked to the theatres a few months back.  Friends of mine went down one by one, succumbing to the propaganda, the rave reviews, the hoopla but alas I was steadfast in my resolve.  Hype, or so I've concluded throughout the years, is a film destroyer.  It has the capacity for raising expectations beyond what's achievable and, after all, unmet expectations is simply another way of saying disappointment.  With the exultation surrounding 2009's Avatar, I feared there was only one place for it go in my appraisal and you can be sure my having held out for so long before finally giving the film a chance was an abstention laced with ambition of discrediting those critics before me who were haplessly tripping over themselves with admiration.

After all, I reasoned, computer generated imagery is essentially the bane to modern visual storytelling and you would be hard pressed to find a movie more dependent upon it than this one.  I am the stick-in-the-mud who will always take the original Star Wars trilogy over the more recent one, Star Trek II The Wrath of Kahn over the 2009 retooling, 1981's Clash of the Titans over the CG-heavy remake and Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings over... oh wait, so there is one example of technology-laced filmmaking that has managed to rival my definition of ""classic"" visual storytelling.

It turns out my plans of disputing Avatar's unrivaled ambitions were very short lived indeed and I shouldn't be all that surprised either.  This is James Cameron after all, the man who brought the world The Terminator, Aliens and Titanic.  It seems like about once a decade, Cameron becomes inspired enough to remind everyone in Hollywood how it's done.  Perhaps his greatest ability, aside from having an uncanny knack for telling stories that capture the very highest highs and lowest lows of the human condition, is his knack of suppressing the temptation to simply harness the latest techniques in filmmaking, but rather to surpass them even if it means reinventing the very process itself.  But before I get ahead of myself here, let's take a moment to review the hard facts.

Tracing its development roots as far back as 1994, when Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for the film, Avatar is set in the year 2154, when humans are mining an abundant mineral called unobtanium on Pandora, a lush natural satellite of a gas giant (Polyphemus) in the Alpha Centauri star system.

Though officially budgeted at $237 million, estimates put the actual cost of the project closer to a little over $300 million in production alone, with some additional $150 million for promotion. It premiered in London on December 10, 2009, and was released theatrically overseas on December 16 and in North America on December 18 where it immediately began breaking several box office records.  It went on to become highest-grossing film of all time in North America and worldwide, stealing the title away from Cameron's own Titanic, which had held the records for the 12-years prior.

Avatar was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, of which it captured three: Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Art Direction.

According to Cameron himself, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements coupled to 40% live action, and makes use of traditional motion capture miniatures (models) as well.

Work on the film had been delayed since the mid-1990s if effort to allow filmmaking techniques to reach the necessary degree of advancement to adequately portray the project's unique vision. Since photorealistic computer-generated character models were an absolute necessity, Cameron integrated new motion-capture animation technologies he had been developing in the 14 months leading up to December 2006.  Among these was an improved method of capturing facial expressions, whereby the actors wore custom made skull caps fitted with a camera positioned directly in front of the actors' faces at all times; their facial expressions and eye movements were then transmitted to directly to the computers for animation layering.

Additionally numerous reference cameras were implemented to provide the digital artists multiple angles of each and every performance so as to provide unprecedented shadow effects and reflected light between digital elements.

So even in taking into account all of the inconceivable digital techniques required to make the film possible at all, a budget that could make Bill Gates sweat, a roster of production talent with credits predating the use of panoramic lenses, and some of Hollywood's brightest up and comers and most revered veteran actors alike, what is the Avatar experience like?  It's surprisingly impressive and I'm not referring to the superfluous visuals alone either.  Michael Bay has certainly proven to the world that eye candy alone does not a good film make.

Avatar opens with Sam Worthington's character, Jake Sully's narration; an appropriately drab tone that hints to the conflict within him that will later become the core of this grand tale.  There are undeniable homage cues that fans of Cameron's Aliens will certainly recognize in the early sequences especially; long distance space travel with cryogenic suspension, a rigid and heartless military, a greedy corporation behind the financing of the operation and so on.  In fact, now that I think on it, there are even mechanized loaders present and Sigourney Weaver to boot!  All that's inexplicably missing is Bill Paxton.

Believe it or not, a strong argument could be made that Avatar is in fact simply the inverse of Aliens- In that both tales work from the idea of human beings forcefully annihilating an alien race on their own turf.  Aliens does so with the human's best interest in the foreground, Avatar tells the same story, only this time from the point of view of the victims.

The undertaking by which Cameron manages to switch the viewer's loyalty from his fellow humans to the indigenous inhabitants of the alien world Pandora is nothing shy of genius.  Much of the film's 162-minute runtime establishes momentum to accomplish this feat.  Rather than ""force feed"" the good guys and the bad guys here, Cameron approaches the tale by presenting the opposing points of view pretty evenly and simply steps back to allow the viewer to decide who is right in the debate.  In the end, and certainly a forgivable trait, the conflict becomes a bit more black & white. The hope of course is that by then the viewer will have chosen sides with the same conviction that drives Jake Sully.

It would be impossible to skate through this critique without mentioning the highly publicized visuals.  And while I am doing all I can to avoid heaping praise on an already mountainous pile, the truth is that the visuals deserve a lot of the credit for taking what boils down to a typical tale of imperialism, oppression, and suspension of rights (that in many spots plays out eerily similar like events from our own history books) and turns it into an ethereal experience that isn't soon forgotten.  For not only was the production crew charged with the arduous task of showing in intricate detail an entirely fictional world, they had to create an entire race of inhabitants that though more animalistic than human beings, were every bit as human as we ourselves (and perhaps more so at times).

Failing to inspire viewer sympathy for these primal Pandorans could very well have been the kiss of death for the entire picture but such concerns are futile as Cameron and company nail the objective a hundred times over by the film's conclusion.  Chalk it up to a combination of solid casting and lessons learned from classic animated films from the likes of Disney, the digital animation process here uses oversized eyes and near-caricature-like overly exaggerated features of the character models to ensure the complete and utter inescapability of the viewer's emotional surrender.

Further tying the prose together is the patented James Cameron love story; a bittersweet poignant whimsy that somehow manages to break down the emotional walls of even the most impassive (and skeptical) of viewers.  And with that comes an indescribable feeling of tension throughout the entire experience in simply knowing that Cameron is no stranger to concluding his works with the death of characters you come to know and love in the name of timeless artistic tragedy.  Throughout the film I found myself struggling to maintain a level of emotional detachment out of sheer remembrance of Kyle Reese, young Newt, and a very popsicle-like Jack Dawson.

The scoring is, as is perhaps expected from a film of such high-class production value, top notch as well.  James Horner's soaring composures take the visuals to new heights (sometimes almost literally) while introducing a sort of tribal rhythmic tone to the formula that is ineffably appropriate.  While it presents no danger of dethroning John William's Star Wars theme as the most whistle-able tune of all time, there is little debate to the fact that Avatar's soundtrack will likely adorn the CD-players of countless folks who, until now, wouldn't have considered themselves the movie soundtrack type.

So in all, would I be so brash as to suggest Avatar as a film that would appeal to nearly everyone? Surprisingly, perhaps.  A self admitted science fiction aficionado, I came in with high expectations of Avatar's highly publicized alleged revolution of the genre.  While it wouldn't be considered hard science precisely, there is just enough space travel and mecha usage to keep my brood satisfied.  Action junkies will surely find much to love here in this firefight-heavy roller coaster ride and even the emotional-set will likely clamber to the Na'vi 's portrayal in earnest (box of tissues at the ready).

In fact I could go as far as to say it's rare indeed for a film to come along with such universal appeal but then again to do so would be to discount Cameron's rich and extensive catalog of titles up until this one.  The man who made the world fear Schwarzenegger, admire Sigourney and cry for that kid from Growing Pains has somehow managed to raise the bar again, this time with ten-foot tall blue skinned aliens and a story that offers irrefutable testament to the fact that no matter how jaded the world around us becomes, the human heart was, is, and will forever be one driven by love.",1272326400,11,10567,5.028080229226361
3933618,4,B002HEXVUI,"Not so much long awaited (as the film was playing in theaters up to a week ago) but with the release of AVATAR to DVD the public fascination with the film increases. Already the DVD is setting sales records much like the film did at the box office. So is the movie worth adding to your collection or watching? Sure. But it's not near as good as some people thought.

Set in the future, the story revolves around Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), an ex-Marine whose legs no longer work. Jake's brother was to be part of a scientific expedition to the planet of Pandora. To discover more about the planet, Jake's brother was part of an experiment where his own DNA was combined with that of the planet's native inhabitants, the Na `vi. This cloned body or avatar would be linked to him via equipment in the lab enabling him to see, touch, and feel everything the avatar did. But he died prior to heading out, thus presenting Jake with the opportunity to take his place since they shared DNA.

Upon arriving, Jake finds himself a fish out of water. Not quite still a Marine as he is wheel chair bound, he's also not taken in right off the bat by the scientific group either, especially by the head scientist Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) who views him as a dimwitted Marine. But he'll have to do and the link is made. Jake is ecstatic about the chance to walk, run, to feel his feet once more and it appears he just might work.

At the same time Jake has been recruited by the top Marine commander on the planet, Col. Quaritch (Stephen Lang). Quaritch wants Jake to get more intel on the Na'vi and the layout of the land where they live. In return he guarantees Jake he'll put a word in to get him a new pair of legs.

It seems that the Marines and the corporate sponsor of the entire expedition are there for one reason. The planet of Pandora has a reservoir of a rare ore known as unobtanium (couldn't they have come up with a better name than this?), worth millions for a single ounce. But the biggest location of this ore is right under the main base of the Na' vi. It seems the scientific group wants to learn more about the people and work with them while the evil corporate big shot and the Marines want to simply destroy them, get them out of the way and take the ore.

Jake heads out on his first mission but ends up lost from the rest of the group. Alone and in the jungle, he nearly becomes a meal for the local animals but is saved by a female Na `vi named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). A sign from the planet's deity causes Neytiri to take an interest in Jake and to help him on this new world as a Na `vi.

As the film progresses, Jake supplies the information to Quaritch that he desires but begins to change with each passing day. Not only does he begin to take an interest in Neytiri, he also begins to see the Na `vi as the people they are, learning more about their heritage and beliefs. And when the Marines begin to move in to destroy the main source of their beliefs, Home Tree, Jake must decide whether he is going to do what he has been ordered or do the right thing.

The movie is a breathtaking experience to see. It is a beautiful combination of colors and visuals that make you feel as if you're truly seeing another planet that actually exists. For this and this alone, the movie should be seen and appreciated. Not only did visual effects artists create a new world for all to see, they also created the Na `vi as well. Yes, the 8 foot tall, blue skinned aliens are all computer generated and completely believable.

The only problem with the movie is that with all of this technology, one would think they would have thought to make a deeper film with less simple plotline that was less political pandering and more story oriented. As another reviewer I read put it, the film is like watching DANCES WITH WOLVES set in outer space.

The simplest idea put forward with this film is that all corporations and military people are bad and that all indigenous people are good; technology is bad and nature is good. Kind of an odd thing to say in a movie made from some of the most high tech available out there. In this film world, there is no common ground, there is no gray area. It's all black and white, good and evil. As I said, an overly simplistic look at environmental issues.

The film does offer some great action and high adventure. It does present a great science fiction film, a genre that gets less attention than it deserves. But for all the hoopla the movie could have been better. Will you watch it more than once? Certainly. But not as much for the story being told as for the visual world of Pandora you will encounter.

As has been stated by many others here, this DVD release is as bare bones as one can get. Just the movie folks. Rumor has already leaked that a special edition will be seen in the near future. So if you're a fan of the movie, pick it up now. But if you're looking for extended versions, commentary tracks or the like, hang on and just rent this time around.",1272326400,,5018,4.321997874601488

3933623,1,B002HEXVUI,"I've enjoyed many of Cameron's films over the years: The Terminator films, Aliens, The Abyss, Titanic.  However I guess the 11 academy awards won by Titanic alowed Cameron to come out of the closet and announce to the world that yes, he is just another tired America-bashing leftist.
Now don't get me wrong Avatar stunk on many levels: the plot was basically a Dances with Wolves rehash, the environmental message silly and done before.  However I love the fact that although the military men appear to be a renegade mercenary army bought and paid for the evil corporation exploiting the planet, they clearly appear to be U.S. Marines (commanded by the cliched, stereotypical  Southern psychopath) and we are supposed to cheer when they are killed by the angel-like aliens.  Yay.  (Perhaps if Cameron and one of his film crews get into trouble while filming in a hostile country, he can have the aliens from Avatar come to his aid.)
This is a stupid, tired film from the word go.  The 3D was impressive for the first few minutes.  Afterward, you forgot that you were watching a 3D film.  (Gee you don't suppose the fact that 3D and IMAX tickets cost a lot more had anything to do with this film being the highest grosser of all-time?)
If you enjoy a silly and insipid film with a plot that has been done before, Avatar is the film for you. (A friend saw this film before I did and told me that it would make my blood boil.  It really didn't: I just thought the film plain stunk.)

The story line wasn't original enough to be given that title. Very predictable. I enjoyed it, but I was not included in the group of people angered that it did not win the Best Picture Oscar. It did not deserve it. Worth a watch, but, in my opinion, a little overrated.",1272326400,,445,4.309523809523809

And for entertainment purposes, it does a great job.  This movie hits the trifecta of everything I look for in a Blu-Ray....great story, great picture, great sound.  No extras??  Who cares?  Do you seriously buy a movie for the extras?  If so, then you are a joke of a movie fan.  If you are like me and buy the movie for, I don't know, THE MOVIE...then pick this copy up.  I don't care about any ""Special Editions"" or ""Director's Cuts"" or whatever because I'm not going to buy them anyway.  I wanted the movie and that's exactly what I got.

For those who have compatibility issues with this flick, GET A BETTER BLU-RAY PLAYER YOU CHEAP M'FERS!!!:p",1272326400,11,819,4.45945945945946
3933626,5,B002HEXVUI,".  Okay, so people are upset that this DVD hasn't got extras and isn't 3D.  The movie itself is great.  I had not seen it in the theater because I can't see the 3D.  But I really don't think I missed much.  The screen is filled with lush vibrant visuals.  James Cameron may go way over budget with his movies, but every dollar is up there on the screen.  I have never seen anything like it.
The movie clocks in at nearly three hours.  Do we really need a director's cut that makes it longer?  It already felt complete to me.
And as far as it not being in 3D.  How many people have gone out and bought a 3D TV yet?  Not to many, I bet.  That is why they didn't release it in 3D  Even if I could see the 3D I would not buy a 3D TV.  Who wants to wear those stupid looking glasses just to watch TV?
If you enjoy well made action movies you can't go wrong with Avatar.  It is fantastic!  I can't wait for the sequel.",1272326400,14,912,3.875
3933627,1,B002HEXVUI,"Watching this movie is like trying to enjoy a film about spousal abuse starring OJ Simpson.

James Francis Cameron (film's creator) has publicly stated that ""we"" need to do something about the environment on earth. No kidding.  Only...the ""we"" part of that statement excludes Cameron. This self appointed expert on environmental matters clearly believes that the resources required to make, release, and view one of his films saves countless square miles of the rainforest by some unknown phenomenon yet to be fully understood by science.  Cameron also stated that concerns such as joblessness rates always put environmental issues on the back burner.  So, did the folks that were hired to produce this movie and the plethora of others James Francis Cameron produced not get paid? And, did they otherwise live their lives with a zero impact on the environment?  Does Cameron??  How exactly does Cameron and those he employs feel about environmentally friendly nuclear power - or is oil a much better and environmentally friendly alternative in these expert nuclear physicist opinions? Or, is science not something filmmakers think they need to be familiar with to be experts on everything?  Blah... I think I will stick w Japanese anime for now on...just to avoid ""Hollywood pompous expert opinion"" from interfering with my movie viewing experience in the future.
Cameron also stated that people like Glen Beck are to blame for public apathy over global warming and excessive use of resources.  Huh?  To be fair, Cameron identified Beck as responsible for all human excesses and apathy toward the environment only after being repeatedly prompted to do so by MSNBC's Chris Mathews.  Oddly, he didn't say who was responsible before Beck arrived on the scene. I do give credit to Cameron for not agreeing that the  US of A has caused and continues to causes any and all environmental damage.  Perhaps he is an expert.
I feel very strongly that the environment should come first, and that one of the reasons the environment is not the primary focus of our 21st century civilization is because former truck drivers gone film makers are heralded as ""experts"" on the environment.
I do not go to movie theaters, by the way, because it is not environmentally friendly to do so.  Cameron doesn't care about this fact because his tens of millions would be adversely affected if people did not go to theaters.  So, it is not he that should be doing ""something"" ..it is the rest of us peons that should be doing something!!!

The movie is good no doubt about it, but not worthy of the top spot in box office history. The aliens and Pandora look amazing. It must have taken years to render all of these scenes out and they look fantastic. The movie itself takes a little too long to get moving. It just sits there and slowly puts the pieces together. It would have been given a five star rating had the plot been developed a little faster. The movie lasts for two and a half hours. I think they could have taken at least a half an hour out in the middle to make the move flow better. I hear that there is going to be a version that is forty minutes longer, and that just shocks me. I thought that it was too long as it is. The characters are pretty well developed and the story itself is nicely finished when the credits roll. It takes a little too long for the main character to learn all the customs of the Pandoran people. I just would have liked the movie to turn against the aliens quicker. It takes too long for the evil humans to try and destroy them. It was a good movie and I recommend it to sci-fi fans, but don't go into it expecting the greatest film of all time you will just be disappointed.",1272326400,,1291,4.126984126984127

The plot line, however, is so predictable it made my teeth ache, and in places, so silly all I could do was groan (for example, the cavalry charge, duh).  The real pity is that they had the basics for a si-fi movie that would have eclipsed everything that came before - a sentient planet connected to all the life, both animal and human, on it; a trained marine and a combat pilot who should have had an understanding of basic tactics; and a group of highly trained, motivated scientists.

Please DON'T give BAD reviews because you expected THIS version to have it ALL!
The Blu-Ray Disc version of the film is the BEST QUALITY Blu-Ray you can find! It is 2% away from REALITY it is so Crisp/Sharp/AMAZING!

James Cameron's love affair with profanity persist from Titanic and into this movie and I don't understand why. It does not enhance the movie at all and certainly cheapens it. Furthermore both God's and Jesus' name has to be used in vain. Doesn't he realize that bucket loads of kids are going to see this movie? Why trash it with a filthy mouth? Does profanity make the film more realistic, more exciting? It's a fantasy type movie. Someone tell me how this adds to the movie's enjoyment. The CGI is amazing but still flawed. You can see imperfections everywhere but it is so bold, you don't really care and the story is very interesting except humans are portrayed as evil, wanting something that if they don't get, the owner of that commodity is made into an enemy that must be destroyed. Otherwise, the movie is a must see, no doubt. I recommend it but with the reservations I mentioned.",1272326400,,974,4.5397727272727275
3933634,1,B002HEXVUI,"I have not seen this in the movies so I have no idea what is or isn't missing on the DVD.  Whatever it is, it wouldn't help. First off, the technology and the use of the Avatars was breath taking and that is the only interesting thing about this movie. And it was interesting for about 10 minutes. Oh, and Signourey Weaver, who improves any movie but couldn't save this mess.

I can only quote J.R.R. Tolkein here: ""I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence.""

Avatar harbors not just the presence of allegory, but hits you over the head with it, over and over again until you just want to fast forward and get it over with.  I guess I have just read and watched too much great science fiction over the last 50 years to be impressed with this shallow derivative script and characters. Happily ""borrowing"" from Dune, Deathworld Trilogy, Star Wars (think elongated Ewoks) and so on ad nauseum Cameron has churned out another bowl of paplum for the young that ranks right up there with ""Titanic"" for its banality.  Why not tell the REAL story of the Titanic instead of making up a boring story about a necklace?  Why not give us some depth and surprise in this utterly predictable plot?

Don't buy this buy DVD unless you wish to encourage Cameron and his ilk.  Go and read some good sci fi and nourish your brain.  This kind of thing will only give you cerebral cavities.",1272326400,9,1460,4.479245283018868

But I wouldn't tell people not to buy it because Avatar is the single best looking Blu Ray currently available. And this is what Cameron said you would be getting from this Blu Ray. Nothing but the movie looking the best it can possibly look because there are no extras. What you are paying for and hopefully gladly is a chance to buy this film for home viewing while it is still in the theaters. And it is spectacular.  You aren't getting the cheap dumbed down product some well intentioned people are warning against. This is a premium quality disc. This is your chance to purchase the theatrical version. Later on you will have the chance to buy the extended edition and a 3D version. Both of these will no doubt cost more than this version.  Not many people will be able to take advantage of 3D so it not being in 3D right now is fairly irrelevant. I love extras. But the truth be told most of the time I only need the movie. The extras all too often go unwatched.

Suprisingly, James Cameron, despite the heavy weight of hate stacked against him, managed to make me like this movie.

You can quickly and clearly see  the parrallels between the human conquest of Pandora and the European conquest of America (and other places). There are irritatingly stupid one dimensional characters such as the almost cartoonish (GI Joe action Hero type) Colonel Miles Quaritch and his evil CORPORATION boss.

But if you can forgive Cameron the propaganda, this film is actually quite good. Visually stunning, good plot (although perhaps slightly predictable - but which blockbuster plots aren't?) and it gets you thinking about our impact on the Earth.

Worthwhile movie, I'd recommend it.",1272326400,2,926,5.1879194630872485

Thank goodness it came with a DVD copy :). Anyway, Amazon is shipping me a new one and hopefully that the one they will ship is not faulty.

Back to the review. The movie is simply amazing! The storyline is superb. It saddens me to think about the future and how us could do such a thing. Hopefully that's not the case in the future.

In fact these very same reviews will probably carry over to the other editions coming out thus needlessly lowering the ranking for an absolutely fabulous movie.

Having watched it in 3D I was floored and loved the movie.  A left the theater feeling that I had just watched one of the best movies of my life so far, and that is not easy to do.  The special effects were amazing (despite what some haters out there are saying that the graphics are cheesy.  C'mon, hate the storyline, but you can in no way say that the graphics are cheesy!) and I enjoyed the storyline and plot, the combination of action, drama, love sci fi and so on.  Everything nowadays has been done in one way, shape or form, so it matters in how it is delivered that will make something stand out.  And stand out Avatar does and then some.

While I thought the theater version was absolutely fantastic, I couldn't help but enjoy watching on my 52 inch HD TV in Blu Ray, enjoying the colors and graphics even more in depth than if I were at the theater.  If you can hold off and don't mind spending the extra money than wait for the special editions coming out (which I agree is pretty lame, why not release the extras with this release if not to make more money later on?  I was a little let down when I went for the extras and there weren't any).  But if you're like me and you wanted to watch it now and you don't want to spend the extra money than run out and get this Blu Ray.

3.  Sometime after the 3-D version comes I bet there will also be a Special Extended 3-D Edition.

I had to stop watching 3 times to stop crying, before continuing. - The bottom line, I think, is that despite technological advances over the years, the people (on both sides) opted to resort to solving their differences by going to war.

I will give this 3 stars for what I feel about the movie itself, but no more than that as a reflection of the bare-bones release.  It's a statement about the fact that they are deceiving consumers by releasing this at a separate time as the not well known future slated deluxe version of the film.

The ""green"" message of this movie was pretty clear.  Don't exploit your environment.  By quietly releasing this movie in two different versions at two completely different times the studio is doing just the opposite.  People in the ""know"" are holding off unless they don't care to own the future release.  Others, well, they will be upset, baffled and most likely convinced they need to own the deluxe version as well.

I think the studio got the wrong ""green"" message.  The only green they saw with this sub par early release was money.  Now, many people will double dip.  Using more resources and waste than if they had just released the two versions at the same time.  Giving the consumer the un-deceptive choice up front on which version they wanted.  Thus printing fewer copies of each version creating a balanced use of material, plus using less gas and energy in the method used to purchase each version.

I am not the greenest person in the world.  I'm trying though.  But all I can say about this is, shame on Fox and James Cameron for being that very villain portrayed in the film.",1272240000,5,1582,4.530035335689046

I can't run anymore, it made the movie even more appreciated to dream of being able to jump, run, even fly on one of the animals there. So much insight went into the making of this movie to bring a realistic possibility into creation. Absolutely mind boggling to dream this is a possible reality. I would want to stay myself if this were possible and such a place. I love the wonders of the forest and trees, the simple life without machinery and greed. Beautiful trees, plants that glow in the dark, flowers with colors that enhance the mind with appreciation for the work that went into this work of art.

3933658,1,B002HEXVUI,"I want my $20.00 and two hours of my life back.  This was the worst film I have seen in years.  While the special effects were impressive, they were used to the point of rendering them overwhelming and counter productive.  Special effects are supposed to be a bridge between the reality that a film is a work of fiction and the ability of a person to ""willingly suspend disbelief"" and invest themselves in the story.  The most important trick with special effects is to give enough to get the audience hooked but leave enough for the imagination so that the audience invests itself into the story.  The special effects in this film were so pervassive and overwhelming as to leave nothing to the imagination so there was no room for the audience to invest itself into the film.  The overwhelming nature of the special efforts made the movie a completely passive experience.

The other problem with this film is that the special efforts were a bridge to nowhere since there was no meaningful story to invest in.  The critics were right to label this movie ""Dances with Smurfs"" since it was just a high tech rip off of ""Dances with Wolves"" with blue natives.  The characters are two dimensional and utterly predictable.  The story has been done time and again by a Hollywood that has nothing new to offer and instead just recycles the same politically motivated scripts.

The only good thing about this film was the incredible job done with individual special effects but ultimately the audience is so swamped by scene after scene that offers nothing more than a cool visual that by the end of the film you are left thinking ""Oh God, not another pretty light ..."" and praying for anything of substance, which unfortunately never, ever materializes.

3933660,3,B002HEXVUI,"I will be honest: the reason I got this movie was because A) I recently bought an LCD TV and a Blu Ray player and B) I've heard nothing but glowing reviews on the visuals in this movie.  So I figured, why not try out my TV/Blu-Ray with the best that exists?
John Sully (Sam Worthington) is a parapalegic Marine who comes late to Pandora and the Avatar project, run by Dr. Grace Augustine to study the Na'vi and get them to negotiate so the humans can mine for the highly coveted Unobtainium (yeah, I know, it's a weird name).  When John gets separated from his team, he ends up befriending Neytiri, the daughter of the chief of the clan.  Thrilled, the greedy humans tell John to penetrate the group and find out how to move them out of Home Tree so they can mine the Unobtainium.  But John not only learns from the Na'vi...he's beginning to grow to like them.
First off, the acting wasn't all that bad.  Sam Worthington was enjoyable as the lead, and I felt he did a good job going from Jarhead to Na'vi.  Sigourney Weaver, Michelle Rodriquez, and Zoe Saldana were good to...but somehow, I feel that they were just doing what they've done elsewhere (I see this is Michelle, whose character here isn't much different from her character on LOST).  So, they aren't bad, but just aren't reinventing the wheel.  Not necessarily a problem.
The visuals, on the other hand, were astonishing.  It's still astounding to me to think that much of it wasn't real!  The movements, the skin, the surroundings, heck the animals and the weird floating mountains--all looked like a camera crew found somewhere in the world and were filming there!  I shudder to think how this would look on my old TV.
Unfortunately, the story is nowhere near as original as the visual effects, which is a pity.  It's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pocahontas/dp/B0007KTBIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pocahontas</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Samurai/dp/B0001JXOVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Samurai</a>&nbsp;or even a bit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hidalgo/dp/B00005JMOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hidalgo</a>&nbsp;(and those are only the ones I've seen, I've heard it also bear resemblances to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dances-with-Wolves/dp/B00008PBZZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dances with Wolves</a>).  Create a tech-savvy, militaristic society that wants something.  Add a noble race of savages who use bows and arrows.  Make the something the advanced society wants where the noble race lives and won't move, and you have yourself Avatar.  None of the characters--particularly the human marines and non-scientists--display any subtlety.  They are all gun-toting, tobacco chewing, tree burning, shoot-first-ask-questions-later red necks.  The most disturbing scene for me, is that none of the men and women who participated in destroying Home Tree ever exhibit one iota of regret, as they watch the trees burn, as they watch the Na'vi flee, as they see people die.
Would I recommend Avatar?  If you have an HD TV and Blu-Ray, I shouldn't even have to finish this: YES!  It's absolutely stunning, the wave of the future.  Sure, the story is meh, but honestly, just watching John soar on a pterodactyl-like beast is more than enough to counter it.  If, however, you plan on watching on a DVD, on your old TV, I would say no.  The story just doesn't make up for what you lose in visuals.

NOTE: I had a brand-new Blu-Ray, a Samsung BD-C6500, and had to go online to find a work around (pressing STOP several times then hitting DISC MENU) because there was no new firmware so I could view the movie by just inserting into my Blu-Ray player.  Hopefully, this will quickly be remedied.

3933663,2,B002HEXVUI,"After reading several pre-release critical reviews of Avatar I decided to skip the theatre version and borrow the DVD. Now I wish I had watched the 3-D version; that would have added some interest to a movie with a boring storyline.

Other reviewers have written eloquently about the predictable plot and other weaknesses of this movie, so I'm just going to mention a few things I found strange:

* Humans have mastered space travel, but Jake rolls around in a mechanical wheelchair (while the Marines use hydraulic loaders that are lifted straight out of Aliens) - and after almost six years in cryosleep, shouldn't his muscles be more atrophied?

* Cigarettes still exist 150 or so years into the future but there is only one smoker on the base (probably because Ellen Ripley smoked... and Dian Fossey, but most of you are probably too young to remember ""Gorillas in the Mist"").

* With the exception of a few facial features, a human-alien hybrid looks 100% alien.

* Who dived into the tanks to braid the avatars' hair while they grew?

* Unlike all other alien females, Grace's avatar needs D-cups (sorry, but Sigourney Weaver doesn't need them either!).

Despite the above-mentioned oddities the film provided okay entertainment while I was couch-ridden with a stomach bug. However, I kept wishing that Cameron had used all this CGI power to put Alan Dean Foster's ""Midworld"" on the screen instead of this unoriginal, cliche-ridden story.",1272240000,2,1444,4.9421487603305785
3933664,4,B002HEXVUI,"Has anyone not seen James Cameron's juggernaut?  Is it worth seeing on DVD or Blu-ray?  Even though the film is now officially the highest grossing movie of all time (approaching $3B!), there are millions upon millions who have not seen it - in America and abroad.  And yes, the magic still works in 2-D, especially with a high-definition TV displaying a Blu-ray disc.  That said, this film is an otherwise lame, highly derivative story but executed in eye-popping, breakthrough technology.  Essentially, it's a blatant homage (rip-off?) of Sam Fuller's Run of the Arrow, which was ripped by Dances with Wolves, Fern Gulley, Disney's Pocahontas, Last Samurai, Cabeza de Vaca and a host of lesser films and stories.

Perhaps the greatest source influence on Cameron was Poul Anderson's 1957 short story ""Call me Joe.""  It's about a paraplegic who telepathically connects with a synthetic life form to explore a harsh planet.  Sound familiar?

If I ignore that glitch, the movie was completely spectacular. The effects are such that the cgi is flawless and appears real, even when in scenes populated by human actors and real objects. The story has been told before, but the new setting of the lush and exotic world of Pandora leads you away from how familiar the tale actually is.

3933671,3,B002HEXVUI,"First, I'm removing a star for the stripped down first release many people here have been complaining about. This marketing gimmick is deplorable on the part of 20th Century Fox. But, it is Fox; what else would we expect?

James Cameron told a predictable story: corporate greed strengthened by militaristic bloodlust threatens a beautiful indigenous people. They have to fight for their survival. One man among the bad guys finds the true spirit, mends his ways, fights for the people, and after a hard battle, they emerge victorious and they all live happily ever after. We saw this with Dances with Wolves, the Last Samurai, and many others. No surprises.

The physical appearance of the Na'vi themselves seem somewhat formulaic in a more subtle way. The ears and noses are clearly animalistic and feral to human eyes, but the mouths are very human (except the teeth). Netyri's mouth is very sensuous. The eyes seem to hold both qualities; but lean toward a Disney-esque appeal to the ""aww, isn't that cute"" reflex our culture has been programmed with.

The extended battle scene is just that; an extended battle scene. In most movies with these, my mind blanks out and I wait for something interesting to happen. But Cameron and crew did a very effective job of it

One other complaint to Mr. Cameron: the music was dull, unimaginative, and formulaic. With that, they played it too safe. I didn't like it one bit.

These complaints merit the removal of another star.

Having said that, it is still quite a good movie. The acting is good (barring some half-witted dialogue here and there; mostly from the jarhead in charge of security), the visuals and production as a whole are breathtaking, and the plot moves quite briskly. I was particularly impressed with the details of the Na'vi, their culture, and their world. A great deal of thought went into this, and holds the lion's share of the movie's artistic merit.

There is also the subtext of the warning about corporations using military force to increase their profits and power. The invasion of Chile during the Nixon administration having set a terrible precedent the world suffers from.

One of the most interesting aspects of the movie was that it turns the whole sci-fi horror formula backwards. This time, human beings are the evil and destructive invaders from outer space! This alone was a brilliant and daring move on Cameron's part; for which he should be congratulated.

There is another idea that pops into one's mind. Many ancient myths describe malevolent beings that committed atrocities against humanity. I wonder if those mythological creatures were extraterrestrials that our ancestors had bad experiences with (not an original idea, I know). I also wonder if the day comes when we can travel to other stars and if we encounter primitive cultures, if we end up being portrayed in their histories as mythological creatures? Just a thought.

3933674,4,B002HEXVUI,"Honestly, there was no way the release of ""Avatar"" was going to get by unscathed from every comment under the sun by movie critics and the audience. The top-secret project from a director who hasn't directed a film in 12 years, the last of which was number 1 in the box office Stateside and worldwide, it won 11 out of 14 Oscars including Best Picture and birthed a song you couldn't seem to escape no matter how fast you ran. Then the weirdness started pouring in like James Cameron's really long-winded speech at the E3 Expo explaining the movie for nearly 20 minutes to the visuals of bright, colorful animals and blue cat people and would incorporate 3D technology that no one has either tried or pulled off successfully. But then it came out, reviews were solid, the 3D format become THE way to see it and the film so far has earned way more money than Titanic did. Unfortunately this almost meant the naysayers would be out in droves concerning the familiarity of the plot to other movies which had plots similar to other movies and now we have an absolutely bare-bones Blu-Ray/DVD; a release completely devoid of special features with the only thing missing is a ""better edition later"" advertisement somewhere. How's the movie? Well Cameron is certainly one of the premier directors and clearly hasn't lost his touch but at the same time the film does have some issues as well.

On the planet of Pandora, humans have established a colony there and are trying to mine a very valuable (yet lazily named) metal known as ""Unobtainium"". It would be easy if Pandora wasn't filled with dangerous wildlife and a toxic atmosphere, requiring everyone to wear breathing masks outside. The other problem is the indigenous tribe on the planet, known as the ""Na'vi"" who don't take to kindly to this threat to their home. So the humans set up a lab built of ""avatars"", Na'vi and human DNA cloned in a lab controlled by brainwaves but there has to be a suitable fit for each avatar so in comes Jake Sully, the twin brother of another driver recently killed. While Jake finds the experience exhilariting as he's paralyzed from the waist down, the military also has a mission for him: enter the tribe, gain their trust and convince them to move off a piece of land which has one of the biggest mineral deposits they've found. While initially Jake follows orders, meeting tribe member Ney'tiri and growing more in love with the harmony and purity of the forest starts to see the bad guys being his own kind so with the help of some friends, including project leader Grace Augustine, Jake has to figure out how to defeat and drive off a technologically-superior force, the love triangle he gets himself involved in as well as his mission and what happens when the tribe finds out.

I'll admit the story is unbelievably familiar, not only in terms of the basic premise but certain archetypes as well. The upfront and sassy project leader, the nerdy lab member threatened by the new guy's progress (which is weirdly never delved into), the wise shaman woman, the would-be-husband threatened by Jake who later respects him as a warrior to the no-nonsense military general who might as well be twirling his mustache or petting his evil black cat on a chair. But then again, if Avatar is Dances with Wolves in space, wouldn't Dances with Wolves be the Pocahontas story in the Civil War? See, Avatar's premise is one seen many times over but it comes down to how the director made that premise worked for the film. After all, how many Sleeping Beauty or Romeo and Juliet-type stories have you seen/heard/read in your life and how many took that idea into cool places? But that's one thing where Avatar becomes a bit flawed, mainly in its pacing. Whereas I'm sure a sequel was inevitable or even planned, it feels like the film is just crammed with stuff that it sacrifices the flow of the film, worrying that a shorter film would yield less cooler stuff to show. Like Titanic, scenes could've been chopped but were left in which slightly bogs the film until it really kicks into high gear later.

And when I mean cool stuff I mean there is some really awesome and dare I say ""gorgeous"" stuff in Avatar. Like the Lord of the Rings, it feels like the world of Pandora has been meticulously designed and developed even if we never understand its purpose or its very existence. From the ground which briefly glows a-la Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean"" video to bugs that twirl in mid-air, bio-luminescent trees and almost neon-colored forestry makes the film really beautiful to look at and the creature designs look quite extraordinary as well. Then there is the Na'vi themselves: nearly 10 feet, all blue, cat eyes and ears who bond with animals and the forest through the tips of the long hair. Kay. But regardless of what you think of the film, there's no denying just how amazing it all looks and sadly I was unable to find a theater near me that didn't require an 8 hour drive that could not only display the film in a digital screen (our local theater uses projectionists still, how lovely) to the IMAX 3D screenings. Like Star Wars which was a good film and a step forward in terms of digital effects, Avatar feels like a movie that will start to open up even more advanced forms of digital creativity in the next decade. Sound is also great not only in sound design but in the mix as the score is powerful and emotional without overbearing while the design has great impact in loud moments, balance in quieter moments and well put together. Only weird thing is that I swear one Pandoran creature's bark sounds like it comes straight from Jurassic Park's velicoraptors.

How's the acting? It's...okay since Cameron knows how to stage action scenes incredibly well and he's right up there with Spielberg and Jackson in creating exciting battle scenes but then again his dialogue tends to be slightly...off. One liners don't quite work, characters feel a bit too broadly-drawn and the ""I see you"" line seems to want to replicate the ""you jump, I jump"" line from Titanic but without the impact. And while Sam Worthington plays his part really well, it's Zoe Saldana, fresh off the success of the Star Trek reboot who completely steals the show as Ney'tiri. Sigourney Weaver plays the sassy and almost too-*****y Augustine but then Giovanni Ribisi plays the swarmy Parker who is part of the corporation funding the whole deal on the planet. My one disappointment is that we have Michelle Rodriguez of ""Fast and Furious"" and ""Resident Evil"" fame about to show that she can play more than the tough-as-nails female who seems to want to punch whatever looks at her funny yet she gets barely any screen time. And side note: she's actually hotter in this film than other ones too and that's just criminal given her small screen time.

Should you buy this? I'd seriously debate this since the film's great, the transfer is near flawless with the effects becoming a bit more slightly obvious and it comes with the DVD for those in your homes without a DVD player but then again this is another victim in the double-dip strategy: release a bare-bones release to quench your thirst until you release the packed Special/Collector's/Limited edition down the line which might even get a triple-dip when a Extended Edition or Director's Cut comes later. Ultimately it becomes a question of how often is your household going to watch Avatar and whether or not that'll be enough till the bigger edition is released later but if you absolutely want to watch the movie whenever you want without re-visiting the theater then go for it but the film's good enough to watch though it's debatable whether it's a purchase right this second.",1272153600,,7697,4.711210096510765

This Two-Disc Blu-Ray/DVD Combo is an absolute disaster and not worth the headaches it causes. First of all the DVD is blurry. I know that DVD is supposed to be less sharp than a Blu-Ray version of the same movie but in this case it seems as if they made a concerted effort to create something extra blurry. I've seen DVD's that are as sharp and clear as their Blu-Ray counterparts so I know it's not a limitation of the material at hand. It seems almost purposeful to me and if it's not on purpose then it's incompetence because either way you have a inferior DVD product.

Now let's talk about the Blu-Ray disk. I have a newer Blu-Ray player and it was unable to play this disk.

With this technology they wait until there is a must buy DVD and tweak their product, making many Blu-Ray players unable to work and you need to be technologically proficient to do the updating. Computerless people are out of luck I would guess. Well, I am proficient with the computer and found an 'update' for my Blu-Ray player which after a few hours of trying to get the unzipped file on a USB Drive I was able to update the player. Great. I put in the Blu-Ray disk and a third of the way through it I am confronted with a glitch. The scene selection dialog and the graphics for it come up every minute for two hours of the movie. I can press the menu button when it comes up and the menu comes up, the scene select graphics fade, I press the menu button again, it goes away and the scene select graphics pop back up to cover a third of the screen. It does this for the second two thirds of the movie. I find as I google it, sure enough, it's a verified 'glitch' that affects some Blu-Ray players and not others.

You need to return this two disk disaster and get your money back. It's a defective product on both counts, the DVD and the Blu-Ray disk. I don't even know what sort of extra DRM and other 'enhancements' they needed to make to make your Blu-Ray experience more slow and painful but that's what they did. Return this Turkey, complain to the manufacturer of the movie or don't buy it at all. It's really a disaster.",1272153600,3,2437,4.2387096774193544
3933677,5,B002HEXVUI,"This movie is THE BEST movie I have seen in a long time!  The visuals are stunning, the music is perfect, and the intensity is very forgiving and makes you want more!  I could not wait (and why should anyone who has seen this movie in the theaters) to buy this movie in 3D or the extended edition.  Also, I highly suggest watching this movie on an LED HD TV...so real you think you are looking out a window!!",1272153600,2,408,4.139240506329114
3933678,3,B002HEXVUI,"We purchased this movie and watched it as a family....loved the movie but was totally disappointed with the language used in this film.

Come on....can't a movie be made without all the trashy words used in this film.  What a wonderful movie it could have been...I am not a square, but I value morals for our children on all age levels, and I know others do too.",1272153600,,362,4.388059701492537
3933679,5,B002HEXVUI,"Although there is much about this film that has been hung on a framework of past films, such as ""Dancing with Wolves"", and ideas, and is not particularly original, I found a number of things about this film to be very appealing, making it of some merit in adding to one's library. The love story is, of course, splendid, even if there have always been such tales of recognizing the worth of an individual, despite his or her discouraging position in life (i.e. the Cinderella story). As an aesthetic experience, the paradisiacal planet (with its strange name, Pandora) was often presented beautifully. In addition, one has the perennial question caught in the depths (admittedly not emphasized) of the film of what precisely constitutes the ""good life"". For the paraplegic soldier, isn't it better to create for him a ""cyberworld"" in exchange for his life of enforced inaction? One sees a kinship here to the movie ""Matrix"", and it brings one's imagination to bear a bit to go beyond the superficiality of much of the action that dominates the film.
As a final comment, I believe that the ""reviews"" for films tend to fall into two distinct categories, one of which one does not generally see for books. In addition to the intellectual content of the film, a great deal of importance is attached to technical aspects. I find that a great many of the people who write film reviews seem to be focusing on technology. Certainly, the technology associated with this film is very impressive. This was how, in my eyes, the movie earned its ""fifth"" star. In a way, it is gratifying to see that there are those who so appreciate modern technology: It is indeed extraordinarily impressive and is mostly too taken for granted. Of course, there is the obvious environmental message in the film, and as technology is being used (not just in the film) everywhere, in the service of humanity for both constructive and destructive purposes, it is important to pause and think about this. I'm not sure that there are any satisfying ""answers"" to the issue of the abuse of people and the environment in using technology.
In fact, the planet itself seems to have an intelligence, somewhat like our vast communication networks on Earth intimate. One is faced with the unity of life, as the cyborg world of Earth, represented by the ""company"", meets the ""carbon-based"" technology of this planet, represented especially by the ""Indians"" or indigenous peoples of the planet. When one thinks of these two comparable ""intelligences"", a result of ""convergent evolution"", the image of ""tooth and claw"" on the scale of planet vs. planet comes to mind. In this sense, the word ""Pandora"" takes on a special meaning as, following the interface of the planetary intelligence with the paraplegic soldier from the company, a ""consciousness"" awakens on the planet. It is just a small leap of imagination to see the setting of ""Avatar"" as the first part of a trilogy, which evolves to the ""Alien"" series and then, as the struggle continues, to the level of the autonomous robots of ""Terminator"". After one sees this side to the movie, one also thinks about Stephen Hawking's recent remarks about our efforts to contact alien intelligence. From this perspective, humanity and its technology is seen as very much a part of nature.",1272153600,,3291,4.889087656529517
3933680,3,B002HEXVUI,"I didn't see this movie in the theater. What prompted me to buy AVATAR was ALL the hype about it's ACADEMY AWARD nominations. After seeing AVATAR, I'm not surprised how it FARED at the CEREMONY. Some of the story lines I had seen in other productions. For example when the flying creatures were pared up [for life] with riders, the selection process was very similar to the pilot of ""DINOTOPIA""!

Well it's in my library now and probably won't be watched again unless I lend it to someone. I'm NOT saying DON'T SEE IT, I AM saying RENT IT FIRST!!!!!!",1272153600,,550,4.5
3933681,3,B002HEXVUI,"The evil Earthmen want to take the land away from the noble Blue Men, the inhabitants of a distant planet. Earth is ""dying"" (no doubt because it has not hugged enough trees.) The evil humans want to make sure that their Company has a good quarterly statement (I swear to God, it is in the movie). To assure these corporate profits, they must mine the mineral ""Unobtainium"" (you cannot make this stuff up; this is also in the film) which is of course right underneath the sacred tree which is where the native inhabitants live. Rather than attempt some form of trade or negotiation, the Earthmen just move in with bulldozers, and the fight is on!  (As the Klingon said: ""Well frankly, I've never liked Earthers..."")

The hero of this epic, through evil Earth technology, can enter an artificial body that is in the form of one of the natives of this planet--a clone or something. The natives are attractive, blue-skinned, lean-limbed, hard-bodied, well, you get the picture--gorgeous people. The original idea is that our hero is supposed to learn about the natives to figure out how to get them away from the ""unobtainium"" and presumably onto the reservation. But our hero, in the best tradition of ""Dances With Wolves,"" goes native and fights the Earth People. You can probably guess the rest. I did.

The special effects in this flick are quite literally fantastic, and the film definitely gets across the idea that the natives of this planet live in a low-gravity natural paradise that beats the heck out of the Upper East Side of Manhatten or similar parts of New Jersey. Everything looks incredibly real, which helps get the viewer past the never-ending parade of cliche's that characterize this film. If you can suspend your critical senses for the better part of an evening (this is a long, long, film) this one is great fun. Heck, who doesn't like trees? RJB.",1272153600,,1867,4.773993808049536
3933682,5,B002HEXVUI,"This review is NOT about the film. Having read through the majority of all the listed reviews, I am surprised that nobody has commented on the fact that this bluray has been released with 1:78-1 aspect ratio! When I saw Avatar in my cinema, it was projected in 2:35-1 format!
Having just invested in a 2:35-1 cinemascope screen, I was eagerly awaiting the bluray release of Avatar, assuming that it would be in the full width cinema aspect ratio (as most other 2:35/2:40-1 films are). Imagine my horror to discover that we have been deprived of the full presentation! I thought the whole idea of bluray was to give us the ultimate experience?
I can suffer the omission of extras etc, (although we shouldn't have to), but I do feel that we should have the film presented in the correct format.
Ok, so a lot of people will be happy that the available picture is going to fill the whole of their tv screen, but instead of giving us a standard def dvd with our bluray that we will never ever use, why not have the 1st disc (bluray) in the 1:78-1 ratio to keep all those people happy who want to fill their tv screen with no black bars, and the 2nd disc (bluray) in the 2:35/2:40-1 aspect for those of us who want to see ALL the film?",1272153600,3,1229,4.3478260869565215

The story, well i didn't really understand what was going on and who the hell these guys were and what they were doing here. I didn't see this in the theater so I don't know if there was more story line handed out in the building or what. My parents saw it in 3D and they saw things they missed watching it the 2nd and 3rd time. My brother was able to play it back on his PlayStation 3...(second time my DVD third time his PS3 and his Avatar BD)

OK, well wait. Putting the disc into my player after an update I still get a warning... Blue-Ray not ready for Prime-Time again...( maybe they should tell the BD player peeps what kind of software they're using so they can get an update for it...

3933684,1,B002HEXVUI,"Its a good movie, especially for young people.  It is an alternate reality of what was lost when this country was settled, by mostly white people.  The indigenous people were in touch with the environment, and had a very nice way of living with nature, unfortunately, as has been our nature, from the beginning of recorded history, we are a people of adapt or parish.  I'm not making any judgements on which lifestyle is better, but I wouldn't want to give up my flush toilet, hot showers, and air travel, none of which would exist if we weren't a people of adaptation.  So why only one star and the title rent it?  Because as many reviewers have already said "" wheres the special features?""  Why a dvd version as part of the package?  To justify the price, to suck you in to thinking it was more then it really was.  Word is the full version is coming out within a few months and then yet another 3D version will be following that, probably just in time for Christmas!  So rent it now if you haven't seen it or borrowing it from you relatives or friends would be even better.  When they finally know what their doing, and it's in 3D, I think most people will really enjoy this, just don't try to analyze it, its more fun watching it as escapism, a beautiful reality if only fantasy world, you can't miss the comparisons, so over look them.  Ain't nobody going to know, unless you write a review, and with a thousand reviews already, dose anyone need another?  But if you wouldn't mind, I could use a little help with rating this 1 star.  Lets send a message to hollywood were sick of getting ripped off and their hypocrisy about saving the environment while they force us to buy three or four versions of the same thing in the name of their profit potential.",1272153600,,1759,4.408668730650155
3933685,2,B002HEXVUI,After all the hype and buzz about this movie I bought the Blu-ray version. Having never seen it at the theater I expected to be blown away by the story and cgi effects. It turned out to be the same old plot line about the evil humans destroying everything in their path. The cgi although getting better still looks like cgi. I had to watch this overly long movie in two sittings to keep myself from using the fast forward button. If there is a sequel I'll avoid it.,1272153600,5,465,4.235955056179775
3933686,4,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron is a top-notch filmmaker who never does anything small.  In terms of special effects, Avatar is the greatest film every produced.  While the CGI still doesn't look like real-life, it's closer than anything else ever attempted, and it is offered with excellent Blu-Ray video and Dolby DTS audio.  Although the film is long (and apparently will get longer in an upcoming director's cut), it doesn't seem that way because it is so well paced.  A problem with fantasy/science fiction is maintaining plausibility, but Avatar does that well despite the heavy fantasy.

Stephen Lang is a marvelous actor who deserves better recognition than he receives.  He does accents very well and inevitably becomes his character, as he did in Gettysburg playing George Pickett, in Gods and Generals as Stonewall Jackson, or playing a New York police detective in The Bronx is Burning.  He did well here until . . .  Read on.

However, when it comes to the film's story line, let's face it:  Avatar is Dancing With Wolves on CGI steroids.  DWW works well because it looks back at what happened and handles it with reasonable historical accuracy.  Avatar looks forward in time and concludes that the white power structure (STILL white after all those years?) is worse than ever.  Not only have those evil-doers raped Planet Earth barren, they want to steal everything from those nature-lovin' Na'vis and don't by God give a damn what happens to the dumb ""savages"" in the process.  Giovanni Ribisi's Norm Spellman is a stereotype who seems 300 years out of date.  Even Lang's Col. Quaritch becomes more and more of a caricature as the movie progresses.  At the climax, his question to Sully on how it feels to ""betray his race"" only lacks a burning cross and pointy, white hat.  The Southern accent was present and accounted for.  Cameron has not been known as a director known for infusing political viewpoints in his films, but he certainly did here.  It would have been nice had taken into account the social changes of the last sixty years when predicting the future.

On the other hand, he may not have had a movie.  Avatar is, of course, just a movie, and it's an entertaining one despite its heavy-handed message.  I can't read his mind, but Cameron may well have said to himself, ""Let's go with the 'in' topic because it will make me a LOT more money.""  He sure succeeded.",1272153600,5,2373,4.776412776412776
3933687,5,B002HEXVUI,"Like other reviewers, I am upset to learn that none of us have the final, final complete film in our possession.  That like ""Kingdom of Heaven"" there is a longer and more complete version of this film on the near horizon.  From some reviewers, I gather this later edition is better.

Whatever is going to happen, I am going to only comment on what I saw last night for the first time and then rewatched today.

In one word, ""Wow!"".  I have seen where FX is going.  What a jump for this film goer who loved ""Kingdom of Heaven"" director Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" and Cameron's own sequel to that sci fi classic; some say that sequel was better than the original.

My biggest complaint about modern movies is story given up for FX.  There are too many films out there the last many years in which that is happening.  But not here. And I hope the story line will be intact in the upcoming DVD release of Benecio del Toro's take on the Wolfman.  Another film with, as the teasers show, incredible FX, but also two Academy Award winning actors in del Toro and Hopkins.

But back to ""Avatar"".  A wonderful story.  Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.  Sure, I know it's been told alot of times.  But it was told very well here.  Very believably well.  And the FX only added to the magic of the sci fi saga.  They did not become the reason for the film in my opinion.

So even if there is a longer and better version of ""Avatar"" on the horizon don't wait. Buy this and enjoy the film.  The acting, done a great deal by things that don't really exist and get your head around that concept, is excellent, the music uplifting, and the scenes are breathtaking.  Every single shot of this film is breathtaking.  From a gritty cremation to free falling down a cliff miles deep into a bottomless valley.

Why wait?  A longer, and frankly better version of ""Kingdom of Heaven"" did not make me wait when that DVD first came out.  I'm glad I did not wait here.  You will too, I suspect.

It's a treat.  ""Avatar"" does what films are supposd to do and does it well, longer version or not.  It entertains.

You will be entertained.

The script(dialogue)itself is quite predictable and just bad in places, especially the military banter and
I really could not feel much for the anime' eyed blue skinned earthy klan. The whole movie felt like watching
a video game with all it's computerized special effects and flash. Overall just too predictable as to where it
was going. Plenty of cliche's throughout. After seeing it, made me wonder how hype takes off anymore when a
big budgeted and promo'd to death--movie comes out. Great though for the dumbing down of viewers everywhere.",1272153600,27,750,4.905511811023622

3933691,1,B002HEXVUI,"Let's get a few things straight. James Cameron already made this movie over 20 years ago, it was called The Abyss and it was actually a good movie as opposed to this bloated, cartoony moronfest.

Second, if the idea of putting Dances With Wolves, Princess Mononoke, and Aliens in a blender sounds appealing...this is probably a fantastic ""film"". The problem is, it's not fantastic...at all, in any way! The story is a generic composite of every ecological science fiction or fantasy story of the last 40 years, with horrendous dialog and truly hideous visual effects that make the Star Wars prequels almost seem sane. Bottom line, if you enjoy this movie you might want to have your morphine IV drip checked for air bubbles.

Lastly, this steaming turd clocks in at an almost unbearable 2 hours and 42 minutes...are there seriously people that think an additional 30-40 minutes is necessary? I'd understand feeling scammed by the folks at Fox if bonus features, the 3D version, or additional footage would help make this ""experience"" less painful, but it just makes bad seem even worse!",1272153600,52,1086,4.9289617486338795
3933692,4,B002HEXVUI,"After seeing this movie twice in the theater, once in 3-D and once in 2-D I decided to purchase it even though I know that there is additional footage that will come out later this year. After watching it on the big screen and getting the Blu-Ray disc, it was everything I hoped it would be -- even better! I know I will be purchasing the Extended Edition, but we don't know when that will be coming out. I have a Samsung Blu-Ray player, a Pioneer receiver, a 51 inch Samsung HDTV (LCD), and 5.1 surround sound system. This DVD did not disappoint, and as a matter of fact I actually enjoyed watching it in my own home where I can make my own popcorn, drink my own soda, pause the movie whenever I want to or rewind, and caught things in my home entertainment system that I did not notice when I was watching it on the big screen. For the low price that you're going to invest, for me it was $15.99, it is definitely worth it. When you buy the theatrical release you get what you pay for, however, when the director's cut comes out I will also purchase that and then sell this edition. But for my friends who have never seen it, they were blown away. The picture was crisp, sharp, and watching it on a perfect system made it worthwhile. I would not buy this if I did not have the home entertainment system that I currently use. But hearing the helicopters fly over your head, listening to the rumble of the animals that live on Pandora, and the beautiful colors that are optimized in the Blu-Ray edition I would not hesitate to recommend this to a friend.

I know that there will be people who are going to wait for the director's cut, and I have no problem with that. I did the same thing when it came to the Lord of the Rings trilogy on DVD. I purchased each theatrical release, and then upgraded to the extended release when they were available. I will however he waiting for the director's cut in Blu-Ray for that particular series, but avatar is just one movie not a series and therefore definitely worth the investment. I've watched it three times in the last 24 hours and see something new every single time. To each their own, but I would buy it now while it's on sale rather than wait. With the 50+ Blu-Ray collection I currently have, this is definitely in my top five.",1272153600,4,2278,4.31002331002331
3933693,1,B002HEXVUI,"Okay, to get this straight:  My review is more of the actual Blu ray disc rather than the movie itself.  I saw the movie in 3D at my local theater, enjoyed it, was not that impressed with the actual story, but do consider the movie groundbreaking in terms of CGI and 3D use.

This is a disgusting example of double dipping by 20th Century Fox and for no real reason.  When you purchase this disc, you'll see either on Amazon or on the box itself in store that there are NO special features.  No trailers, no making of, no commentary by James Cameron.  Nothing.  Nada.  Nil. Zippo.  The movie is also presented in 2D only, but... Yay, you included the standard DVD film only disc as well.  Huh?  I bought the blu ray version because I wanted the blu ray version.  I'm sure somewhere out there (probably in James Cameron's mega box office funded mansion) exists a treasure room full of extras for this movie.  The only justifiable excuse for not including them (and it's not really justifiable) is that they didn't have time to get it all ready for this release.  This leads to my biggest confusion and question:  Why release this version at all when the movie was still near the top of the box office less than 2 months ago?

Would anyone, especially fans of this film, have suffered by waiting say 2 or 3 more months for a quality release?  I can understand if you tell me that you need more time to get the 3D version ready since it most likely will take advantage of the ultra new and ultra pricey 3D technology TVs, but If you told me that it would be ready, I don't know, lets say in August, I certainly would have waited.  For the love of Pete, the movie came out during the last 2 weeks of December!  Does anyone remember when Jurassic park came out on VHS?  The movie hit theaters in June of 1993.  It didn't bow on VHS until October of 1994!  It was an event.  Avatar comes out December 18, 2009 and is released on DVD and Blu ray on April 22, 2010!  Four months later?  Four months?  Make us wait a little.  Keep us hungry.

Of course the real reason this movie was released so soon (and don't tell me Earth Day) was so that the studio could cash in on the people that saw the box on the store shelf and thought to themselves, ""Oh!  Look!  Avatar!  I loved that movie a few months back when I saw it on the big screen!  I have to have it!"".  Within 6 months, they'll release a version with 3D and special features, and people will buy it.  Then they'll re-release the film with added content in theaters before they put that on the store shelves for people to buy.  My wager would be that within a year we will see at least 3 versions of Avatar released on Blu ray which is pretty disgusting.

Congratulations Fox.  You've stooped to new lows.  This in my opinion deserves a 1 star rating far more than the recent blu ray release of Lord of the Rings.  No, it's not the extended version, but for me the extended and theatrical cuts are both great versions.  I'll buy both with no complaints.  At least New Line or Warner or whoever owns the rights now did put a ton of special features on that release.",1272153600,4,3111,4.276632302405498

Avatar takes it to a new level.  Regarding the other reviews- I think people need to review the product and express their gripes to the movie studio separately .  The movie is great, and the Blu Ray experience is awesome.  As with anything else you spend cash on, read before you buy.  It clearly stated that this is just the movie, with nothing else included.  I read it, and that's what I got.  And it's great.  For those who want to wait for the version with all the other features, go for it.  If you don't want this one, then don't buy it!!!

3933695,1,B002HEXVUI,"Disney's Pocahontas story is back, bigger and badder than before. At least, badder. Imagine a hallucinogenic-induced version two of Pocahontas, rife with stereotypes and cheesy-lines worthy of the maker of Titanic; that is Avatar.
Previously, Avatar's director, Cameron held the distinction of creating one of the most over-rated films in history (""Titanic""); now, he holds the distinction of creating two. This movie was overrated in nearly every aspect. Its storyline was a sci-fi, under-the-sea version of Pocahontas, complete with the done-to-death ""evil businesses out to rule the world"" staple of so many films. Of course, Avatar mixed stereotypical characters and less-than-stellar dialogue in with this ""original"" offering. The characters themselves were not terribly likeable; the acting was good, but the cheesy lines did nothing to help it. Not to mention that the two leading female characters were about as friendly as acid. And, of course, Avatar was heralded for its tremendous graphics; on that score, I can say only this: I did not see the 3D version, but the DVD version was surprisingly lousy. Shiny/plasticy-looking textures and mediocre-video game graphics abounded.
I know this review puts me in the minority, but, in summation, the only good thing about this film was the acting - and, unfortunately, the actors and actresses were performing in a steaming pile of crap.",1272153600,33,1392,5.389908256880734

3933699,2,B002HEXVUI,"I bought this the first day out because I missed this in the movies.  Couldnt wait to see it finally!!  Fantastic visuals on blu ray.  You can tell alot of time (and money) was spent ensuring the graphics were top notch but definitly less time and effort put into the speaking parts, especially on the human side.  Acting in my opion was average to poor.  The script was just poorly written.  The use of current slang, and cursing in a futuristic movie seemed ecessive, out of place and unecessary, dragged the movie down. not that I don't curse just seemed weird.  All in all it was decent but to me just short of the mark.  Hurt locker was much better.

As far as the complaints from others about lack of special features, well I don't mind. im tired of blu ray load times and all the bull crap you have to swim through to finally get to the movie.  no special features, no commercials no previews suits me fine.",1272153600,7,914,4.355029585798817
3933700,5,B002HEXVUI,"I saw this in both 35mm and iMax at the movies, and prefer this combo to waiting for the special holiday edition.  Walmart was sold out today, a large 7 shelf endcap display empty.  Happy we bought this on Amazon and saved $5 plus got it on release date from UPS.

The movie speaks for itself and the Blu-ray offers a much improved experience over standard DVD.  This move was not meant to be watched on a DVD.  To this end the bargain crossover combo will get many people to pick-up a Blu-ray player.  I have a higher end Sony 500 series and it took longer than usual to come up.  I would hate to be someone with a cheap knock-off player trying to watch this but update your firmware and you may have a decent chance.",1272153600,8,718,4.197080291970803
3933701,5,B002HEXVUI,"this was one of the best movies i have ever seen specialley in theatres and wether that remains to have carry overed without 3d imax was a question i had that has finalley been answered. YES!!!!!! the clor on this blu ray jumps off the screen and with amazing audio it still makes the movie 3d without glassses.

Now to answer some more questions there is no special features, deleted scenes, comentary, or even trailers. it is as barebones as it gets. But i am still giving it 5 stars because of the presentation with the best picture i have ever seen and audio i have ever herd. plus i am tired of these bitchers giving this movie 1 star. know what you are buying befor u buy it and then later don't cry about it.",1272153600,9,715,4.257352941176471
3933702,5,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron has done it again, forget what the first reviewer here is telling you by NOT buying this movie, this movie IS WORTH EVERY PENNY, special features or not and I got my blu-ray/DVD edition for $19.99 at Wal-mart, the picture on both the DVD and Blu-ray is clear and sharp but the blu-ray presentation on a 52"" LCD TV has to be seen to be believed, been having some technical difficulties with my surround sound system but when I did put it on, it sounded AWESOME!.
After seeing this, I am surprised it didn't get best picture Oscar but THE HURT LOCKER did deserve it, it was a great movie as well.
James Cameron did such a great job with the presentation of this movie on blu-ray, no black bars on the top or bottom of the screen, it's the way all blu-rays should present their movies, I didn't have to make any adjustments to my settings to get it that way either.
My only hope is that when 'TITANIC' finally makes it to Blu-ray, the same considerations are made for that movie as was for 'AVATAR' because I still cannot get over how beautiful the picture was to look at.
In closing, all the reviewers on here can tell you what they will about this movie but only YOU can make the final choice on whether you want it or not, make the right choice, you won't be sorry.",1272153600,13,1279,4.289256198347108
3933703,1,B002HEXVUI,"I use a computer for my blu ray player.  Tried 3 different player packages (all newly updated) and none of them will play this disc.  There was even a new patch for one of them designed SPECIFICALLY for this one disc and that won't play it either.

I knew about the 'no extras' in the blu ray release and I'm totally fine with that, but what I got and paid for should still play in players that are blu ray compatible.  I hear online that the problems all stem from copy protection that Fox put on the disc.  Their take on it is 'upgrade your firmware' but that's not working for people either.

I'm returning it and waiting for them to put out a blu ray that actually plays on something I have access to.",1272153600,3,705,4.185185185185185
3933704,5,B002HEXVUI,"If your a Huge Sci-Fi Fan then this movie is a must. If you don't care alot for CG like me, Then this Movie probably will turn the table around for you like me becuase it's the best Most life like CG to date and I mean it looks great. The Plot is great, acting is supurb its a long movie but dosent feel so becuase your so drawn into it you don't even notice. Get this Movie. Its the best movie I think of All of 2009 and 2010 to date.",1272153600,9,435,3.739130434782609
3933705,1,B002HEXVUI,"I purchased Avatar two disk, Blu-Ray/DVD edition.  I just purchased my Sharp Blu-Ray player in February which makes me wonder why my player should already require a firmware update.  The Blu-Ray disk will not play at all!  The menu looks great, but once I selected 'play' the picture went dark and nothing happened.  I had to telephone Sharp tech support.  They had me reset the player by holding down the power button so I could get the disk ejected.  They are still working on a firmware update which should be done within a week.  The firmware update attempt at this time was a dud.  I find it inexcusable that the publisher created this disk to be so totally inaccessable as to require expert programmer knowlege just to play a movie.  I recently purchased ""The Blind Side,"" and that movie works just fine, as do my other Blu-Ray titles. I think Fox owes people like me an apology, and an exchange for a Blu-Ray copy that works on my player.  Sharp assures me that once they've come up with the effective firmware update I will enjoy the picture quality Avatar promises.  Thankfully I can still watch the DVD disk, and I'll try to resist the urge to use the Blu-Ray of Avatar as a drink coaster.",1272153600,,1199,4.530232558139535
3933706,1,B002HEXVUI,I hate giving this movie  a negative review but although the special effects are terrific it lacks an original plot. Admittedly I didn't care for the first Avatar air bender series and the continuation of the worn out plot -- Evil white men plunder alien planet destroying the natural habitat of a loving culture which is in tune with nature. Maybe they should stick to aliens coming out of the stomachs of corporate miners who are protected by militant women marines. 3-D movies came out in the 50's and are fun to watch but the 3-D effects are lost on home viewers who rent the movie. With the price of theater tickets sky rocketing and the shortage of jobs and money I suggest saving your cash (if you still have any) and use it for necessities. Remember 'all that glitters isn't gold'. Maybe your kiddies would like this fairy tale.,1272153600,7,836,4.573333333333333
3933707,5,B002HEXVUI,I hadnt even noticed that there were was no bonus material on the Blu-Ray but regardless....this movie is amazing! It had to be one of the best movies ive seen in years.....A complete original idea.....not some regurgitated movie from the 70's or 80's.....Or even worse....a movie from a TV show. Im a big fan of sci-fi action-adventure movies and Avatar will take its place up in my top list of all time movies.,1272153600,11,412,4.657534246575342
3933708,5,B002HEXVUI,i didn't see the movie in theaters so i bought it as soon as it came out this move was excellent no questions asked even though the movie dosen't have special features it was still great. a movie like this dosen't need them,1272153600,7,223,4.209302325581396
3933709,1,B002HEXVUI,"I understand it is business, but in business you learn you can't keep ripping off your customers and get repeat business.

No director commentary or behind the scenes anything on it. I can accept it isn't 3D. I can accept it isn't an extended edition. I can't accept there are 0 extras. I am tired of buying the same movie 4X. That is the last 20. fox is getting from me.",1272153600,2,371,4.225352112676056
3933710,5,B002HEXVUI,"I purchased Avatar on Blu-Ray on it's release date, went home and watched it. I was very impressed. Then I bought a new 240HZ LED TV and OMG this movie is AMAZING!!! It is by far the movie to show exactly what a Blu-Ray movie should be! I really like the story, acting, oh and did I mention WOW the detail is off the charts!! This movie actually looked 3D!! My recommendation, go buy it, you won't be sorry!",1272153600,8,407,4.1645569620253164
3933711,4,B002HEXVUI,"The movie was just amazing - the story is O.K., but the visual effects are simply unbelievable. I bought the Blu Ray / DVD combo and was expecting some special footage at least on the Blu Ray - a huge disappointment that there is no ""making of"", no cast interviews, no take outs, nothing but the movie on the Blu Ray - not even any live internet content. How can something like that be missed? Almost as bad as not releasing the 3D version...

Anyhow, $20 well spent - it was for sure not the last time I watched this movie.",1272153600,2,524,4.188118811881188

3933713,1,B002HEXVUI,"Short Summery...DON'T BUY THIS RELEASE OF AVATAR...Wait a few more months for Fox to release the ""real"" version of the DVD...

Fox in their infinite wisdom has figured out a way to milk one of last summers biggest movies by ripping off it's customers that have been waiting for the Blu-Ray release of this movie...How is that you ask?  No special features of any kind...Not a single one...No commentary, no behind the scenes, no nothing but the movie most of us have already seen.  I am severely disappointed...I've had the movie on pre-order for months because I was really looking forward to seeing the behind the scenes special features about this movie only to find out that I'm going to have to buy a whole other copy of the movie in a few months just to get what in my opinion should have been on the disk to begin with.

Hey Fox...Way to make use of Earth Day...Feeding us a DVD that's just going to end up as a coaster in a few months when you finally get around to giving us what we want...Way to trick your fans guys...This is probably what ran through Fox's collective minds before this release...((Let's celebrate Earth Day by creating as much garbage as we can to fill up our local landfills, and force our fans (should they even remain fans after this insult) to shell out more money in the future just to get what we should have given them in the first place))...

Again...Do not buy this release of the movie...be patient a little longer and wait for the good stuff...",1272153600,,1484,4.5018587360594795
3933714,5,B002HEXVUI,"It's a shame that when suposedly writing a review of a movie that people write about everything but the movie, first off, Avatar is one hell of a movie, it passes so fast you don't realize the true length of it, the acting is top notch, and yes some of it is done in a sort of cartoonish way ( the evil men, are played somewhat over the top) but that only adds to bring in the viewers emotions, doesn't detract a bit, the visual effects are as stunning as anything on BLU-RAY, the depth of field allows you to see far into the picture, literally looking through your living room window, so to speak, into a magical land who's beauty is dazzling, and was apparently drawn from many of the species found under our own seas,only the new Star Trek is in the same bracket, for $19.99 this is a steal, the DVD doesn't cost much to manufacture and include, why complain about it? the release of other sets had been anounced (before this disc went on sale) you want one of the other ones, wait, let those of us that just want the movie as is, enjoy it, without your whining, I can't recommend this movie to highly, if there were 10 stars, I would have given them to it",1272153600,12,1160,4.22972972972973
3933715,1,B002HEXVUI,"I bought the movie for a birthday gift.  The birthday girl really wanted it on Blu-Ray.  Cool.  A win-win for everyone...  except that I had to buy a DVD that I will never, ever watch because the family now has the Blu-Ray!  And this is the ONLY way I could get the Blu-Ray version!  I haven't even removed the cellophane wrapper -- in fact, I haven't even seen the movie -- and I am still going to give this product a one-star rating.

I don't care about the reviewers that slam this review because I'm not reviewing the movie itself.  I don't care about the reviewers that slam this review because I'm not reviewing the quality of the video itself, or the audio, or the price, or the cool cardboard sleeve.  Slam me or don't slam me.  I'm giving this item one star because of the marketing ploy behind the sale of the movie.

3933716,5,B002HEXVUI,"From other reviews I've read, I was expecting a so-so story with very good special effects. But the greatest praise I can give this movie is that as I watched it I completely forgot about the special effects.  The art and the effects were done so expertly and are amazing but they were done solely to support the story, rather than the other way around.  I was completely pulled into this world and  the relationship between Jake and Neytiri.  The love story is never forced on you, there are no corny scenes that are supposed to show you they're falling in love.  It just happens in the background almost at the same time as you are falling for Neytiri and her world.  Seriously, I may have a crush on a 9ft tall blue alien!  This movie is great entertainment and great film-making that allows itself to be whatever you want it to be or are capable of seeing.  There are some very deep messages and considerations going on which provided a lot of the emotion for me.  But if you're just looking for action, that is there too in sizable quantities.  I'm probably rambling now but I just have to say one more thing...thank you Mr. Cameron and all the other people responsible for making this movie.  I absolutely love it and can't wait for the next edition to come out with extended scenes.",1272067200,10,1289,4.465811965811966

This is a great movie, but will teach me to read the packaging prior to purchase.

What I crave as a movie buff is good theatrical presentation and Avatar does not disappoint. The picture is stunning and the sound is engulfing. You can't help but become completely invested in the entire story line of the film. After the latest Star Wars trilogy I was convinced that digital effects were becoming a type of ""looky what I can do!"" contest. Avatar has changed my mind. The effects in this film are seamless from live action to computer generated and make the story all the more engrossing. You find yourself trying to find items on the screen that look ""fake"" and it just doesn't happen. Watch this film on a High-def TV with surround sound and try and say that it's not the best viewing experience you've had with Blu-Ray.

Okay...visually stunning, no doubt. You will be wowed! However, this is a storyline done before a million times over. There is nothing original about it. Not to mention some serious plot holes. I am also tired of humans made out to be the bad guys. As if all we do is rape and destroy not only the planet but cultures. The film reeks of Anti-American sentiments and even seems Anti-Human! There are shots taken at Capitalism left and right! I wonder just how much money James Cameron has made from me and millions of other Americans (not to mention the corporations that pay his rear end!)??? James Cameron also attacks the war on terror!!! Look at the way he portrays the ""military"" in this movie. Some of the dialogue just stands out like, ""fight terror with terror"" and ""they are planning some big shock and awe attack""!

I really wanted to like this movie! It was exciting, well acted and directed. The CGI is amazing and realistic as well! However, Cameron's assault on basically all conservative republican beliefs is ridiculous. This a movie made by a far left nutjob!

Oh! I almost forgot...Mr. Anti-Capitalism released a crappy bare bones disc in order to get another $25 from you for the Ultimate Edition to be released for the 2010 Holidays! Way to go Jerk Cameron!

I tried to watch the rest of the movie today and the screen had an error message stating that my Samsung DVD player needed to be upgraded.  What is this?  I purchased the DVD player less than 2 months ago.  The plain DVD works in my player but it is not as colorful as the Blu Ray version.

It is seldom nowadays to see an 'EPIC' motion picture that keeps you glued to your seat throughout. I am happy to say this is one of the best in my memory. The storyline was perfectly written, the cgi and especially the merging of cgi with live action was perfectly done. I have watched it three times in succession today, and really hope Mr. Cameron does a sequel soon...or 10!!!

**Edit** I can't understand how many people actually missed the enjoyment in this movie, or were disappointed 'only' because their disk didn't have ""Extras"" on it! Sure it has obvious similarities to other movies. I constantly thought of 'Dances With Wolves' all through it, but I consider that a major plus...this movie does something that very few movies do, it touches us deep down inside where we exist. If you have that 'special place' double locked and isolated in your life, then you'll miss everything important in the story. But if you have it open, then you'll feel the tingles all through your body while watching Avatar...ok ok, enough existensionalism, heh heh.

It played smoothly on my Panasonic blu-ray player, but the regular DVD looked almost as good on my Toshiba HD-DVD player.  It is a shame that inferior technology, bought by Sony buying out the studios, is what we are stuck with.  Visually the movie is very nice as the CGI was well done.  The plot and the alien evolutionary assumptions were very weak.  Five fingers and finger nails, give me a break!!!  Don't think too much while you are watching this movie and you may enjoy it.  The plot line follows the Gaia ideology mixed in with Dances with Wolves.  It is a watch it once movie and forget it.",1272067200,3,675,4.467213114754099

3933727,4,B002HEXVUI,"Story, mediocre.  3-D and CGI, awesome.  But since the DVD doesn't have 3-D and I'm not watching at a movie theater, why would I bother (I didn't, by the way)?  After seeing at the theater I went away thinking it was too long, first half was really fun seeing this entirely new world, but second half was just typical story that dragged on for far too long.  But since the affects and 3-D was so good it was still a fun movie to watch.  But at home without the 3-D, just not really that interested.  Maybe when the extended version comes out I might get it, at least will have some more story to watch.  Hopefully it's stuff at the start of the movie and not the typical long, drawn-out battle and action sequences.  Bottom line, skip it, wait for HBO or whatever, or wait until something comes out with some extras at least.

UPDATE: Since this has been out I've watched it a few more times, once in it's entirety, a couple times in bits and pieces.  I find myself liking it a little more than I did when I saw it in the theater so I'm changing my rating from 1 to 3-stars.  I still say the story is only mediocre, it's just pretty simplistic and typical.  I also still find the last half a little tougher to sit through.  But in re-watching I think I find myself liking the first half even more than I did originally.  The world is just very refreshing and original, and the colors and effects of the movie are awesome.  The actors and characters are also very good and fun to watch.  Saldana and Worthington, along with the effects help, are so believable and interesting in the main roles that it makes up a lot for any of the dislikes I have about the movie.  BTW, everyone else who has seen it at my house really loves the movie.  With that in mind, I guess I'll bump it up to a 4-star.",1272067200,5,1792,4.220588235294118

On a positive note, Fox did include the plain DVD version which does play.  Obviously they knew that their developers had created a POS program that would not work on many players.  I feel really bad for the folks who have players with firmware that can not be updated.

3933729,2,B002HEXVUI,"Okay, so Avatar! The movie that is supposed to change the very face of cinema as we know it! James Cameron's first movie after Titanic! I became really interested in this after the first trailer appeared and went over with a splat, and the special 15-minute preview had people coming out saying it looked REALLY DUMB. Then you had the expected positive early reviews--studio plants and morons, to be dismissed--and the people I chose to believe, who said that the pretty pictures get tired after thirty minutes and what you're left with is two hours of really tired, clich-ridden white liberal guilt over Native Americans in the form of a Dances with Wolves and Ferngully rip-off. So I was of course interested, but expected to hate it and be very dismissive.

So imagine my surprise when I found myself not just liking it, but QUITE liking it [but not loving it--let's not get carried away], and pretty much completely behind James Cameron's attempt to show us all something a little different.

First things first--does it change the face of cinema? No. It is just much more detailed and rich CGI than you have ever seen before, but that's about it. If people want to talk about Cameron changing the face of cinema, they should talk about The Abyss, in which he used CGI in a way it had never been used before, laid the cornerstone for the CGI apocalypse we're experiencing today. Anyway, all this is really are pretty pictures, but these are REALLY pretty pictures. We'll get into further issues as we go along.

So suddenly-everywhere star Sam Worthington is this marine. His brother was suddenly killed, and since Sam has similar DNA, he gets to take his place. This detail is important to establish that Jake is not part of the mission, he just jumped in and is subbing. The deal is that there's this distant planet Pandora where there is this mineral Unobtainium [I'm serious] that is worth a lot of money. We never find out what else mankind needs it for--lots of money? Is that it? Anyway, the largest store of it is right under the big tree/town of the Na'vi, this race of big blue aliens who are an obvious analogue to Native Americans. The humans grow half-Na'vi/half-human people that they can inhabit via computer hookup. The humans are split into two camps: the good scientists, who just want to study the Na'vi and learn their ways and respect them and reach a peaceful resolution, and the evil military, who consider the Na'vi a bunch of stupid ""savages"" and, since they won't get out of the way, want to just kill them and their dumb tree and take the mineral. I am not known to get sentimental over betrayals of the military, but it must be said that the military are portrayed here as particularly one-sided, stupid, insensitive, greedy, and all-round venal. They are just the age-old clich of the military as invading brutes who understand nothing but force and have no respect for any beliefs but their own.

So Jake is sent in with the scientists, but the big bad Military guy--he really looks straight out of Street Fighter--cuts a deal on the side that he'll report back to him with any of the Na'vi's weaknesses so he can blast them when the time comes. He promises Jake his legs back if he cooperates.

Jake ventures into the jungle, is soon separated from his crew, rescued by Neytiri, the hot female Na'vi, who is going to kill him, but receives signs that he is some sort of chosen one. She takes him back to the elders and quick as a flash they decide to let him join them and learn their ways. The next hour is devoted to Jake becoming one of them, learning that they apologize to the animals they kill [""Sorry `bout that! My bad!""], and goes on and on about ""The flow of energy"" and ""the spirit of animals,"" and ""a network of energy that flows through all living things."" On this planet, however, that is to be understood literally, as all of the trees and plants are connected through a vast neural network, and all the animals and Na'vi have USB plugs at the end of their braids, that literally plug into the alien horses and dragon-things they ride. Jake passes many tests and is finally fully accepted into their tribe and engaged to Neytiri. Once Jake says ""Everything is backwards now... it's like what's out there is the real world and in here is the dream"", you know part one is over, Jake's allegiances have fully shifted, and it's time for the conflict to take over!

So the military dudes have discovered that Jake has gone native, and use his video diary [Jake is dumb enough to use his military-provided video diary and think it's private] saying the Na'vi will never surrender as excuse to just try to kill them and take their land. You ca see where everything is going from here--in fact, you could probably write the script right now and be 89% accurate, as not one thing happens that hasn't happened in every single movie like this. We do have some special phrasings meant to slam home some contemporary resonance, such as ""Fight terror with terror"" and ""Shock and awe."" Things end up pretty much exactly as you'd expect.

But you know what? I didn't care. In fact, I barely noticed [maybe this is because I've thankfully avoided seeing Dances With Wolves]. I'm usually dismissive of pretty pictures with uninteresting character or story, but for me the visuals were so amazing--and the new world they describe so thoroughly imagined and full of variety--that I was really just carried away by the imagery. It is a successful conceit--to provide a new way of looking at movies to show us a new world full of wonderful creatures and amazing plants. The 3-D is nothing new, but this level of DETAIL in it is, and the new planet provides lots of use for it, to the point where the story just became so much background noise. In fact, the very clich nature of the story WORKS for the film, as you don't really have to follow it, and thus are more easily taken in by the stunning pictures. This also makes it essential to see this movie in 3-D at the theater, as this film will be POINTLESS on video; all of a sudden the sameness of the story will be apparent, and you'll just have this rote Native American apology story. I'll be very interested to see how this does on DVD, for that reason.

What strikes me as interesting about these movies is their unarticulated purpose, which is apparently to assuage white guilt about the way we have treated indigenous people throughout history. You sit there and watch a fantasy about how the indigenous people are just soooo great and in tune with nature--they apologize to the things they kill!--and so much more balanced than us evil greedy capitalists who don't care about all that and dismiss others' beliefs and just want money! So you sit there in the audience and think ""Well, this big white imperialist society [that I am a part of] may mow down indigenous peoples in its greedy quest, but I'M not like that. I'm on the side of the nature-lovin' indigenous peoples!"" ...And then, in this fantasy, the indigenous peoples win, and you feel kind of vindicated and rewarded for your allegiances, and ultimately feel like there's no real problem at all. We pushed Native Americans off their land, but that was eons ago, and we're all more enlightened now, so it probably wouldn't happen again. But look, whatever you think about the Iraq war, the fact is that those people didn't have anything to do with 9/11 and didn't have weapons of mass destruction [which WAS quite apparent at the time], and all these well-intentioned whiny liberal movies didn't do much to stop THAT, did it? The public just sort of went ""Oh dear, oh dear,"" but largely stood by and let it happen--I think largely because of the anaesthetizing effect of movies like this, and the feeling walk out that we're all smarter than that now, or that this situation is different, or that the administration may pursue that aim, but YOU didn't vote for them, so you are still on the side of the indigenous peoples, and ultimately that's what counts. You need do nothing--but sit back and watch more movies!

The other interesting thing is how these movies--from Return of the Jedi on--tend to portray the good guys as simple people who live in caves or jungles and strike back with rocks and arrows and ingeniously simple improvised devices--like the Iraqi insurgents, for example--and the evil enemy uses high technology, massive bombs, remotely-controlled drones or huge tanks that can mow down legions of the unprotected, while keeping the evil invader safe behind walls of steel--like the US Military, for example. In fact, this film explicitly uses footage of US troops as a model for the scenes of the invading forces here, and we have those clear call-outs aligning the bad guys here with the Iraq war. So how is it our popular culture teaches us all to be on the sides of the low-tech indigenous peoples, and frames it PRECISELY in ways that allude to real-life conflicts, yet the net effect is to leave the populous feeling like there's no real problem and nothing to be done? All the exact mechanics are obscure, but somehow movies like this, while seeming to rouse people to action and ""right-on"" liberal opinions, actually anesthetize the public, make everyone feel that everything is pretty much okay, and one need do nothing.

There's also a curious little subtext running through this movie about infidelity, which I believe is unintentional, since it shows our heroes in a negative light, but it resonates so much with the content of the rest of the film, it raises a strange little wrinkle. First, when Jake is matched with his dragon-thingy, he is told that he must choose it and it him, and they will be united for life. However, later on Jake gets a flashy new dragon-thingy... and we never hear any more about his original. Did it spend the rest of its life wasting away, pining for Jake who left her by the side of the road like so much detritus? The other incident is that we are told that the Na'vi also choose a mate for life, and that Neytiri is already betrothed to someone, whom I assume to be the big Na'vi warrior dude. Yet she nor the movie bat an eyelash, real or narrative, when she hooks up with Jake and becomes ""joined"" to him. What about the other guy? He can just disappear? These issues are never resolved or reflected upon, and might come off as just a storytelling glitch, details that got lost in editing the sprawling movie, if they didn't dovetail so nicely with all of the other content of the movie that revolves around betrayals, allegiances made frivolously and tossed aside, and broken promises. So it leaves the unintended impression--which actually works by deepening the movie--that even our heroes are unfaithful to their ideals to some degree, make promises of allegiance they later just forget, that we all make compromises and all of us are in some way complicit.

Okay, but aside from all the heady issues, what's the bottom line? The bottom line is that it's quite something to see and is successful at wowing one with its visuals and vision of an interesting new world, and the rote story actually helps you park your brain in neutral and just be drawn along. But you MUST see it in the theater in 3-D, or I wouldn't bother seeing it at all.",1272067200,4,11256,4.6427496236828905
3933730,5,B002HEXVUI,"I'm reviewing this product for what it is, not what it isn't. It isn't the special edition that Fox has clearly announced will be arriving in the Fall. It's ridiculous to give this release one star because it isn't that release.

This release is the new reference-quality Blu-ray Disc. It contains a high-definition transfer that was clearly done with love and care, with the purpose of creating a home release with no visible flaws. It is a success. Whatever you may think of the film as art or as commercial media, as a technological achievement this disc cannot rate less than 5 stars, as the best looking Blu-ray ever released.

3933732,1,B002HEXVUI,"Dan, I really respect your honesty. This film borrowed a lot from a lot of different places. You forgot to mention japanimation. Don't the Nav'i look like Peter Chung's character designs, bodywise, i.e. stretched, athletic, exxagerated proportions? And don't the so called ""hallelujah mountains"" look a lot like the floating mountains in Escaflowne? Like you, I didn't care for any of the characters in this film at all. Cameron-riders will point out how much money this film made as validation of how good it is quality-wise. Like you, I found District 9 to be far superior to Avatar. In regards to effects, pound for pound, District 9's were much better at about a twentieth of Avatar's cost. And if you read all of Avatar's positive reviewers you begin to notice a telltale pattern: they all laud the film's 3-D effects. None of the reviews laud the film's storyline at all. So, most of Avatar's positive reviewers also didn't think much of the movie's other elements. The success of this film says a lot about where we are as a society: style over substance. To say that this mediocre presentation--Cameron's weakest by far--is one of the greatest films ever is like saying that the Yugo is one of the best cars ever made. I wonder where films by Fellini, Bergman, Hitchcock, Kurosawa, Amoldovar, The Archers, Lang, Lean, etc. would rank on such lists? Can anyone with a straight face and a reference of truly great films compare a vehicle--yes vehicle--like Avatar to a film like say Lawrence of Arabia? Please! Avatar was a vehicle to prostitute the next entertainment format--3-D technology--and to pimp gullible, empty, blind, ignorant comsumers out of as much cash as possible. Think people! Consumers are just beginning to warm up to Blu ray and it's hard--and very expensive--to replace all those DVDs we've been collecting over the past fifteen years; now, they come out with yet another ""must have"" format that they claim will drive expensive blu ray movies and their players into obsolesence in a year or so. And don't believe Cameron's hype machine that he had this cookie cutter story mothballed for years but was only waiting for the tech to catch up with his ""visions."" Give me a break! Just because he said it doesn't make it so. Be honest about it: besides the 3-D process he used, what about this film looks like it took over a day or two to conceive by a twelve year old? I'm going to look into my crystal ball now and make a prediction: 3-D will not change the world. It won't stop the killings in Palestine; it won't help earthquake victims in Haiti or China; it won't cure cancer or hunger, etc. But what it will do is put a lot of money in Cameron's bank account and get a lot of techno-sheep to blindly cough up thousands of dollars to upgrade their blu ray players and televisions. Also, 3-D will not take over Hollywood. Has anyone noticed a trend? 3-D technology is only being used in animated films, cgi heavy action films, horror films, and some sci fi. I don't think quality directors like Clint Eastwood, Pedro Amoldovar, Peter Greenaway, etc., will be using the process in any of their films, and this is because these directors' films appeal to older, sophisticated audiences who appreciate plot, character development, nuance, etc. over style, noise, and flash. Don't believe me? Check out every last film that's scheduled to come out this year in 3-D; all of these films will fall into one of the categories I mentioned above. So, Dan, my friend, you are not alone in your sentiments. Like the picture showing amoebas evolving to fish, to lizards, to monkeys, and finally to man, we've hit the end of that plateau and now we're sliding backwards. The appeal of this film proves that.

3933744,5,B002HEXVUI,"WELCOME TO AN AGE WHERE ENVIRONMENTALISM RULES ALONGSIDE CONSERVATIONISM!!

There's multiple reasons for why I have decided to refrain myself from criticizing James Cameron. One , he's probably one of the bravest movie directors I've ever seen. Two , he can surpass himself and that's something I thought he couldn't accomplish. I used to think that he was doing his films in the past for big money and big bussiness'sake , so I said stupidly 'he can't succeed at anything because he's a 33rd degree Freemason'. Now I realize that this film is a chilling portrayal of what happens when you allow retarded people to run the course on such things as space exploration - what you get is the consequences of such stupid actions. This film is of course his all time best movie. Here , James Cameron surpasses all previous films. I was explained by a few fellow youtubers that Cameron can surpass himself and I had to view Avatar a few more times to understand as of why. James Cameron decided to do something else most movie directors of today do not have courage to do - join in the fight against the insane Bel Monte dam , which was the result of faulty environmental politics , and mental retardation among those behind it. I decided to conduct some research and saw that rumours about that he's a highly qualified and perhaps genuine leader will not convince some of his fiercest critics , which is understandeable in light of the events circulating the absolutely unnecessary Bel Monte dam which should never have been conceived in the first place. Signing for the dam to increase the probability for it's construction as a result of preassure from those behind it's project is nonetheless one of his biggest mistakes in the views of a lot of people around the world , including myself , Cameron and many others. Avatar's storyline is already known by everybody - the soldier who decides to rebel against his general once finding out that he has better leadership capabilities and that his general has begun to break certain codes of ethic intelligent people do not have the ability to break. The film is also a serious , intergalactic attack on worldwide left - brained culture. Some of them have been sending me dumbass comments when I have attempted to successfully put authors such as James Randi down the sink whenever I so felt fit to do so. After James Cameron decided to go to Brazil to aid the natives , I realized that here is a man who knows absolutely no fear. Here is a man who will not let his viewers down. Here is a man who knows absolutely what to do to surpass himself on anything , without the guidance of anybody. Here is a man who has the knowledge , resources and know - how on how to film in space if he wants to. Here is a good , gentle giant who knows absolutely how to be wary when approaxing the smaller directors - here is a man who has accepted that being raugh in the past may not necessarily have to work in the present when directing film , in ways that he would do all by himself. Here is a man who hasn't been criticized in any conspiracy book to date as a film director. Here is a man who will not make a movie because somebody tells him to do , but because he wishes to do so himself. Here is a man who can think for nearly 20 years about doing something before he does it. In Avatar , he succeeds beyound most of his past achievements. Yet , even so , in a previous attempt to criticize this movie , I remain absolutely certain in my view that I felt the special effect of Final Destination 3 - D to be somehow better and much more captivating.
Two other Avatar films are absolutely necessary to explore the world of Avatar and the other worlds of Pandora , and perhaps some cooperation with Iceland may be needed. It's sad to observe how 'unoptanium'turns out to be good news for big government and big bussiness in the movie. It reminds us of the insanities of the present era of the current collapse of the developing companies. We do not need to 'develop'the world more than we have already done - it was all smoke and mirrors and self - deception. As Gaahl put it; 'if nature is not allowed to run her course , there'll always be master and slave'. Avatar rocks , because Avatar is kickass. The whole ideology behind Avatar will not prevent other authors and writers to use similar ideas , and Avatar bases it's concept on things like that that are from older and less known works of sci - fi. That is only a plus for the movie to be added to the myriad of other pluses. As of the one - star reviewers , it's hard to make a film like this. Put yourselves into James Cameron's shoes.....and try to make something better......if you dare. The politics of Avatar is the politics of now , because this is what we have to do right now if we're going to wish to take back our planet Earth.....and return it to it's earlier state of paradise it was in nearly 5 to 6000 years ago - albeit with of course more forests , more swamps , more vegetation and more biodiversity , albeit perhaps less water.",1272067200,,5033,4.400214592274678

After the long load time a screen comes up telling that this Blu-ray must be used on a player with the latest firmware updates and if you have any problems to report them to this website blu-raydisc. I then selected play and Begin to watch the movie....the movie looked stunning!!! Vivid colors,and very sharp picture then the fun started. Around the time of the one tree attack a menu popped up with a time line and a picture of the start of the scene,then like magic it was gone...then it was back again....then it was gone..This went on through the rest of movie!! In an attempt to troubleshoot the problem I removed the disc,powered down,then powered up,and started another movie(pirates 1) then stopped it and removed Pirates 1 from my player and reinserted Avatar which, then jumped to the exact spot in the movie where I removed it with the option to ""Resume the movie from here?"" Yes or No? Another thing I noticed is that my player no longer says HELLO on the display when it's powered up but does still say bye when powered down. So even though the movie is good I have to give the disc a 2 stars rating just because it acted weird on my player. After I post this, I'll also post a picture of a scene with that menu in it ...maybe there's a fix for it but I think it's the disc. I would really like to know if others are having this problem...please comment.

THIS IS AN UPDATE: Pioneer came out with a new firmware update this week sometime between,O4/26/10 and 04/30/10.

3933746,1,B002HEXVUI,"I had been expecting a really great movie, from all the media hype. When I finally got a copy, I was very disappointed. It is not that great a movie. It is only okay and is only worth about $15 at best on DVD. It lacks imagination and is boring. Some places I almost fast forwarded my way through. It is at best a children's movie ala Lion King. It should have been marketed as such. The plot line is almost non-existent and the characters are flat stereotypes. I was particularly offended by the blatant characterization of the blue aliens as seemingly simple minded but actually very wise and pure in heart American Indians riding their blue space ponies. That was too hokey. As was the Gregorian chant, the choice of Sigourney Weaver (Alien) as one of the good scientists, and wasn't the bad corporate guy also seen in Alien? Even the beautiful animation wasn't all that imaginative. And the bad soldier leader was straight out of Toy Story. And maybe they are blue because they are supposed to remind us of smurfs. Also, their cat faces and cat characteristics, such as growling and hissing, are not very imaginative.
It did not win an Oscar because it did not deserve one. I wish people had been honest in their assessment of it as it would have saved me a trip to the store. As it is, I am going to return the copy I had bought as a gift and wish I had not opened the copy I bought for myself as I would like to return that copy, too.

Here's my story.
About two months ago I was in an electronics store, and they seem to use nothing but Avatar scenes to showcase their 48 plus inch TV's. (Obviously scenes were released for just this purpose_I noticed that it seemed to have much more detail and saturation than in the theatre, in which both  3DImax or RealD seemed to push the source paste it's prime...I also know that shops love to mess up the contrast, saturation, and sharpness to win you over with shock and awe. What am I watching here..Earth, Wind, and Fur? But I sensed then in the store that when the Blu-ray came out on the film, that it would more satisfying to see at home. I use a front projector by Sanyo, and a pull down 74 inch screen. Movie over...screen goes up...no ugly TV dominating any room. So I watched Avatar tonight...and it completely blew me away. I felt that I finally saw what Cameron had really intended...Glorious saturation, vivid, endless surface details...well, ya just gotta come over and check it out. Since I caught Panasonic's 3D TV demo in town about three weeks ago, that will trounce the 3D in theatres also, in terms of perfection and clarity.
Ok, that's my story. The sharpness of Avatar in the theatres compared to Blu-Ray at home on, hopefully for you...at least a 48 inch screen, well it's like comparing DVD to Blu-Ray. it's thrilling. You can see raindrops on characters shoulders so clearly...the skin on the reptiles is so much more detailed...You feel like this is what Cameron really intended for you to see...in terms of richness and detal. You guys remember how the film used rich blue and red...from firelight, battles, nightime scenes...glowing plantlife....wait till you see this at home...

1. To play this Blu Ray, your player will most likely need a firmware update unless the model Blu Ray player you are using was released after the movie. These firmware updates can usually be found by accessing ""settings"" under you Blu Ray player's menu selection and then pressing ""enter"" on an option similar to ""software update"".

There are also sites where these updates can be found if you wish to use an flash drive to transfer the information. Usually, the manufacture's site will have a link to download the firmware.

2. This release is just the movie. As of right now the reasoning behind this is that the color and the detail of the film were wanted to be shown at their highest possible levels. Because of this an entire Blu Ray disc is simply devoted to the movie. Obviously, special features could have been added on another disc, and according to the reps who stock the film where I work, somewhere between Sept. and Nov. is when they plan to release this version (probably to be in time for the holidays).

3. No 3D for a long time. The current televisions that display 3D still have a long way to go before they are affordable for most of us, and because of the means they use to generate 3D images, they downplay color. Again, according to the reps that I speak with, the release of Avatar in 3D is some two, to perhaps three years out when televisions that are 3D can generate the ""Avatar quality"" color.

In any case the movie is shown beautifully in its Blu Ray format and reasonably well on the DVD. While neither of these contain special features, I do not have a problem with this as after watching a nearly three hour long movie I am kinda done with Avatar for a while (not that I do not enjoy watching the film multiple times).

As for sound, the discs do very well in capturing the movie's audio BUT this is NOT true 7.1. All of the audio tracks are in 5.1, this can be seen by looking on the back of the disc's case. Of course, however, all of the tracks are presenting in high quality forms.

Anyways, I hope that I may have helped one or two of you out there. It is a good film, not exactly original if you saw it in 3-D, but still the film is well tolerated by the majority of movie goers (which is a hard thing to come by these days). If you haven't seen it, give it a watch. It is worth your time. Just be aware that more is on the horizon with this film.",1271980800,10,2705,4.252918287937743
3933751,5,B002HEXVUI,"I didn't expect to like this movie.  In fact, since I don't ever watch previews I actually thought it was going to be a kid's movie.  Was I ever wrong!  While this review is probably not going to be helpful to those who are familiar with the movie and eagerly awaited its release, I'm hoping it will be helpful to those like me who may not have seen anything on it beforehand or just heard snatches of information regarding the movie.

Avatar features the world of Pandora, a place that has been discovered by us Earthlings many years in the future, 2154.  While our technology has advanced, we have ruined our world.  While toxic, Pandora creates a lure for Earth in the form of unobtainium (yes, that made me laugh).  However, another surprise is the sentient humanoid race called the Na'vi.  These are giant blue human looking creatures that have tails and a special braid that allows them to connect to the world around them.

One of the humans who came to the human base on Pandora, Jake, is chosen to replace his brother as part of the Avatar program.  The Avatar program is a computer generation that can put a person's mind in the biologically created body of a Na'Vi.  With this they hope to learn more about the people. Well most hope it, because of the unobtainium the main desire is to relocate the Na'Vi from their home where a great stash of it is buried, using military efforts if necessary.

Jake is chosen to go undercover for the military effort and report back on the Na'Vi weaknesses.  By luck, he is separated from the Avatar group in an animal attack and saved by Neytiri a Na'Vi huntress.  She brings him back to her clan where he is not killed, but instead taken in to learn how to be one of them.  Over time he might change his mind about the Na'Vi home, but would he be able to convince those who desire the unobtanium, or the military power?

The graphics in this movie were wonderful.  It was quite impressive what they were able to do in replicating people and all the special effects.  While a lot of fuss is made over this first version being released without all the special features, I honestly don't care if its in 3d and has a multitude of special features.  Its a movie, seen on a square screen, and I like the fact that it looks like a movie. I'm not too invested in trying to make it real so this version was perfect for me.

I also enjoyed the music.  They seemed very fitting and the song that played to the credits I thought was especially beautiful.  The characters were all well portrayed as well and there aren't any actors I thought someone else could have done a better job.

My only complaint about this movie is that it is a little disheartening in regards to the human race.  The vast majority when you look at percentages were not good people.  And even more terrible was the fact that we destroyed our Earth and had no qualms about doing it to another one with little thought to the local populace.  I'd like to think that the percentage of good people would be higher in real life.  As this is a movie though, I have to forgive this concept for the theatrical relevance.

In all, I thought this was a wonderful movie.  However, it should be warned, don't as I did, think this was for children.  There are violent scenes and vulgar language.  Little ones might want to avoid the movie but if you're ok with older children hearing cuss words, it should be ok for them.

For those disappointed in no extra features I can only say - yeah it would be nice to have them.  BUT, the movie is pushing 3 hours long and even for blu-ray that's a lot of bytes to encode.  Secondly, I got the double disk set from Amazon (free shipping with Amazon Prime) that included both the blu-ray and DVD for only 20 bucks.  I kept the blu-ray and gave the DVD to my daughter.  Since I missed it at the show I feel great about the deal and a chance to own the movie to watch whenever I want.

It's so representative of how the U.S is. Anyways, personal views aside, I really enjoyed this movie. Now that I have seen it on DVD, going to see it in theaters this summer should be a real treat. I definately think seeing the movie this way first and seeing it in 3D later will make the experince that much greater. I can definately understand those who saw this in 3D first, having trouble watching the movie any other way. That's a problem I see with movies shown in 3D before the technology has become mainstream like Blu-Rays and HDTV have. Even they are still catching on.

3933757,2,B002HEXVUI,"I should begin by stating that I did not particularly like 'Avatar'. The story was insipid and the acting of Sam Worthington was incredibly flat. As a SciFi buff and a fan of such speculative documentaries as Discovery's 'Alien Planet', NatGeo's 'Extraterrestrial', and BBC's 'The Future is Wild', I enjoyed the movie purely on a visual and astrobiological level. If you are like me, you get the most enjoyment out of visual films with the widest, cinemascope aspect ratio. James Cameron seemed to agree with this up until filming 'Avatar'. Almost all of Cameron's epic films utilize cinemascope, and his films are, without argument, at least visually stunning. Of course, 'Avatar' was meant to be his greatest work, for which he oddly decided to use a humdrum 1.78:1 widescreen aspect ratio. And if at this point you are very much like me, first I offer my condolences, and second, I would think you'd be asking yourself (or possibly screaming) WHY, WHY, WHY??? You'd ask this especially if you saw the 2D version in the theater and noticed that it was presented in cinemascopic 2.35:1. The reason is 3D IMAX. Cameron thought the additional height of the 1.78:1 picture would enhance the 3D and 3D IMAX experience of the film. So the film was shot entirely in 1.78:1 aspect ratio, and in a bizarre reversal the cinemascope ratio was actually cropped from that for its 2D presentation in theaters. So the good news is there is no information loss with the DVD/Blu-ray 1.78:1 AR. And the bad news is, in my opinion, that any film looks proportionally less visually stunning the squarer the picture becomes. Humans have stereoscopic vision, which makes a panoramic picture more pleasing to our eyes. And on the subject of vision, I feel it was a bit shortsighted of Cameron to shoot a film like 'Avatar' in anything less than super-wide, cinemascope ratio considering that it will ultimately be viewed far more often in 2D than 3D, which to me is gimmicky anyway.

I think every movie studios now should follow this example, just put the movie by itself in one disc, and the other extras or special features in another. I am very happy and extremely satisfied with this blu-ray. In my opinion, AVATAR is one of the best movies ever produced and it is now in my top 5 favorite movies of all time.

Would you rather be enjoying the movie until the extended version is released, or do you just want to spend your time trimming your toe nails?  As for special features, on movies such as Lord of the Rings, I've looked at the special features only once.  When available, I will probably do the same for Avatar, but I'll watch the movie many times.  For lesser movies, I never even look at the special features.

3933765,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is simply a masterpiece, superb in all departments: storyline, photography, acting, special effects, message, you name it. This is a work of science fiction stepping a bit in fantasy and mysticism, developed in the tradition of the good old sci-fi masters. As for the SFX, instantly became a landmark in SFX, impressive the way Cameron improved CGI technology to reflect the real actor facial expressions in the CGI characters, and also the seamless interaction of CGI characters with real actors. The beauty and quality of the landscapes is spectacular. Avatar really took CGI to the next level.

Other key highlight of the movie is how Cameron managed to smoothly deliver an environmental message that effectively raises public awareness in a universal way. Here you might think of the Spaniards discovering and exploiting the Americas, or European countries colonizing African countries, or the U.S. army fighting the Indian tribes, or ...

The movie held up, as it did with the first 3D viewing on theme and interest, of course, but it did not have the same impact as 3D. Some might wonder what 3D verse Blu Ray or DVD means?

3933769,5,B002HEXVUI,"For starters I would just like say that I am amazed at how many people believed this release would be in 3D. Apparently these ignorant people could care less to investigate what the Blu-Ray release would contain before the release or how the film was made, let alone read the Amazon page that specifically states it `IS NOT IN 3D'. The 3D used for Avatar is new technology and not some gimmicky ""popping-out-at-you"" crap that is normally associated with 3D movies. As a result, Fox cannot do what Spy Kids 3D did and include cheap cardboard-frame, blue and red lens glasses. Avatar 3D will require more memory the blu-ray disk, a new 3D television (which is not even released commercially yet) that will cost thousands of dollars along with a new 3D Blu-ray player. Which brings me to my next point; there are no extras contained in this release and for good reason, to provide the best picture and audio quality possible and many have already commented that the Blu-ray version's quality is one of the best out of any film to be released in that format. I would prefer to have excellent film quality then a bunch of extras that I would watch of all of once, if that. Besides, many of the extras that would be included are of similar style to the ones already on Youtube. This version was obviously for those who don't have money to burn to purchase another television and blu-ray player. And for heads up, the release in November will not contain 3D either. Just a low quality version with tons of pointless extras that will inevitably make it costs more money. I don't understand some people. Purchase this version and then hold out for the 3D version which will also have extras when you have the money to get all the new hardware that is necessary to actually watch it in 3D. Anyways here is my brief summary of the story:

Avatar is a wonderful film about an indigenous species (Na'vi) that is being forcibly removed from its home by Humans for a precious material, Unobtainium (a real term) which is contained underneath. Jake Sully, a former marine, sustained a major injury in Venezuela which has left him paralyzed without the resources to afford surgery. He is contacted by the Resources Development Administration about the murder of his twin brother Thomas. Jake is informed that his twin brother was working on the Avatar Program, assigned with the task of creating remotely controlled bodies that are a hybrid of a designated human operator and Na'vi DNA. The only person who is able to control the late Thomas's avatar is Jake himself because of his DNA match. Thus, Sully is persuaded by RDA agents to take an almost 6 year cryogenic travel to Pandora where he is introduced to his avatar and the Na'vi people. Once there, Sully is confronted with the task of assisting RDA in extracting Unobtainium by whatever means deemed necessary. However, he discovers the beauty of the world of Pandora and its indigenous organisms and encounters conflict with what is expected of him and what he knows to be ethical. The film follows this journey of conflict and James Cameron and his team creates a highly detail world that causes you to care for the characters and the world that is Pandora--finding yourself actually rooting against your own species.",1271980800,3,3260,4.729349736379613
3933770,4,B002HEXVUI,"There are a lot of people on here who have gone out their way to complain about this movie. Whatever your opinion is on the story, the visuals are revolutionary. While it's true this is a very bare disc, which only contains the film. The transfer is pristine and they really did utilize nearly the entire capacity of the BD format for video and audio fidelity. I've seen nothing better on the format. The bitrate on this blu-ray peaks near 50Mbps at times, average is around 30. Most other very good BD movies are in the 22Mbs range, so you're seeing something special here. The DTS-HD audio track can provide the volume and punch that I recall in the IMAX theater.

I enjoy the movie a lot. I don't think it's story is a classic but the presentation is and I think it's worth having in your collection. Especially if you're a picky about the technical qualities of your media :) It would be nice if we could have an extras disc with HD content instead of a ""DVD"" copy of the film, which is a nice throw in, but certainly not what a blu-ray enthusiast would prefer. Fox has a very valuable franchise here, so I don't blame them for milking it, but it does get a bit excessive. I'll probably just rent the next release to check out the extras. I doubt we'll see a better transfer of the 2D version of this film so I'm pleased with this blu-ray. I'm glad I got see this movie in 3D a couple of times. It transfers well to the home experience on a standard 2D set.",1271980800,7,1461,4.274368231046932
3933771,5,B002HEXVUI,"^^^Ok, gave it a 5! Before I get flamers coming after me, I will explain my 5.

My 5 rating was more heavily based on the movie itself and not really the other stuff (u know, the whole special features thing).

Movie:
  I really liked/loved this movie. Interestingly enough, I have never seen Pocahauntus nor Dances With Wolves, and I hear people complaing how Avatar is just an exploitation of these movies. The basic features of the story may be copied, but the whole experience is magnificently new. Believe me when I say this, many of the movies that we love are ""copies"", or are similar to previous works done. Just think of the story of Romeo & Juliet by Shakespeare, it is a very good story, and undoubteldy a copied one which we have seen used numerous times in moves as the main theme. Before you go on about how the story is unoriginal though, realzie that the elements and environment used to tell the story is very different and provides such an enriching experience. Before you judge it too harshly just ask yourself what you want out of a movie, chances are it is unreasonable. A ""good"" movie is one that can embue you with a wide range of emotions and make the movie real in your mind. I have never seen a movie that made me hate humanity so much (but note that not all humanity is destructive and ruthless, just some here and there). As far as movies go, Avatar (in my opinion) is one of the best of all time. Thus, 5 stars.

Special Features:
This is a big one; probably the main reason why Avatar has 3 1/2 stars. I agree with the negative remarks. It is unfair and downright greedy for Fox to try and milk us like this. Releasing the normal version now only to relase the bigger and better version later is a very good tactic that they use to get almost twice as much money out of Avatar. You got to admit those rich (*edit*) are smart; and their smarts/greed are just going to make them even richer/greedier!  However, just think about it like this, if YOU do not want to give the fat cats twice the money for this movie, then dont. If you feel that buying this movie twice is not going to put you out on the street, then who cares! Buy it again, go for it!! Them being the rich milkers-of-the-people and us being the economically average(/""the milked"") is just the way it is. The quality of the movie should not be based on whos getting paid bank and whos buying what twice or three times. It is up to you (the customer) to decide if you want to buy this product or not. If you can afford to buy this movie several times, then you shouldnt be complaining. If you can't afford to buy this movie multiple times, then it is up to you about which version you want to buy (if you want to buy it at all) and how long you are willing to wait for it. Its that simple. Theres no need to make things harder than they actually are.

I just wanted to add my opinion, because I feel that the rating system used on Amazon is a very useful tool when shopping online. And rating should really just be about the quality of the product itself and not about how companies are screwing us over. That kind of stuff belongs somewhere else on a blog or something. But I mean no offense to anybody, and of course this is just my opinion. Thank you for reading.",1271980800,8,3257,4.277597402597403

Wow, this means we will shed more $$$ for future version/s! Didn't they already make a lot? Overall, hats off to Jim Cameron but I dare say that I was not impressed this time. But, buy this for the sake of keeping a copy of one of the most successful movies of all time!",1271980800,,850,4.176829268292683

Decided to wait until it was released on Blu-Ray/DVD, just got my copy delivered late by UPS last night just before 8PM via Amazon, watch the entire movie on Blu-Ray.  I have a feeling they release it too quickly that means the movie isn't that great only 4 Months since the theater. ""Titanic"" was longer before they released and I think way better than this movie.  Like a lot Sci-Fi, but this movie didn't impresses me much. Pretty confusing a disabled vet went into this soul transformation into an Avatar body or actually get to another planet with this suit?  The computer graphics is not too realistic, obviously can tell it is computer generates, compare to this week's release ""The Lovely Bones"" have much beautier computer graphics animation, I think cost less to make and better. Borrow from a family, friend, to see if you like first, before buying, there's two additional version of this movie to release.",1271980800,2,1045,4.693989071038251
3933776,5,B002HEXVUI,"I'll keep this short.  Yes, Avatar loses some luster by not being in 3D yet.  Yes, there is a 4-disc special edition coming out right before Christmas.  Yes, there are no special features.  And yes, this package is still worth it.  There are no special features OR previews.  However, the complete dual-layer blu-ray disc is used up.  This means that Avatar has the whole disc to use solely for the movie.  And this really shows.  The picture quality is perfect.  It's not 3D, but its still razer sharp and extremely colorful.  It's perfect.  The audio is equally perfect.  While not having as many features as other blu-rays, it still comes with the DVD version for free.  And the price is right, considering it just launched yesterday.  Avatar will never look better on blu-ray, since the disc is completely devoted to the video.  If you loved Avatar, just get it.  If you really don't have $20 to spend and want to wait 8 months, just pass.  But the video still looks fantastic.

3933778,1,B002HEXVUI,"I just can't see how this became such a money maker. I guess the schools and colleges have finally managed to brainwash and dumb down everyone into falling in love with movies like this. The poor downtrodden little blue people who love life were enough to make you sick. Cameron ""borrowed"" elements from many other movies, books, and even video games for this unoriginal and uninspired movie. They wasted all these visual effects to re-hash Dances with Wolves, when off the top of my head I can think of a dozen science fiction books that would make wonderful movies. But alas, Americans and the world are not interested in originality, they want the same old thing re-packaged over and over again.
I would like to make a comparison with another recent Sci-fi epic and this movie.
District 9 had similar themes but was a far better and original movie than Avatar. You hated the corporation and its mercenaries in District 9, you also felt great empathy for the protagonist Vickers, in D9. This was Avatars main flaw.  I just could not hate the bad guys in Avatar, while at the same time I could not really bring myself to feel anything for the good guys. Both protagonist and antagonist were very shallow, and then cocooned in visual eye candy. Pretty on the outside hollow on the inside. 3 hours and $17 wasted.",1271980800,8,1312,4.655172413793103

I watch the movie in Blue Ray then none HD. There is a world of difference in the picture quality. The none HD  the colors are flat, simply put it is not the same movie. This movie realy show what HD can and should do. So many movies say they are HD but really are not. My over all view of the move is very good.

3933780,5,B002HEXVUI,"I watched this movie 3 times in theaters all in 3d, one in Imax 3d, and loved it every time.  However, despite how cool the 3d was in theaters, I really enjoyed this bluray presentation in 2d moreso.  In 1080p, on a Samsung LED TV at 240hz (blur reduction at 10 and dejudder at 0 with local dimming; now that is a treat for the eyes.  So many details I did not see in theaters, so much clarity, can actually see what's going on at all times.  Also much smoother.  The excessive 3d judder is distracting.  I watched this bluray the day of its released on Thursday and will watch it again before the end of the weekend.  Love it.  This is what high definition is.

In regards to the movie itself, I'm not going to get much into that.  You either love it or you hate it.  I'm just one who loves it.",1271980800,12,795,4.097402597402597

Once again Hollywood took what could have been a cool concept,great ideas,and a pretty good story,and turned it into...The evil corperation,the horrable armed forces. All headed up by the worst thing to ever exist,not only on the face of the earth,but the whole solar system. The dreaded white male. This movie went even further than 2012 with the writers liberal views. Hollywood!

3933784,5,B002HEXVUI,"Let me start off by saying that I am one of the people that saw Avatar multiple times in theaters and loved it.  The CGI , as well as the 3D technology infused, were by far the best I have ever seen.  James Cameron and all of the people who participated in the making of this movie did a tremendous job.  Weta workshop is taking its place at the top of the mountain, as far as visual effects companies go.  Watching this movie was like being transported to a different universe.  I was completely immersed throughout the almost three hours I was in the theater.

As for the story and acting for the film, I am probably in the minority on most of these reviews.  The story for me, while predictable and reminiscent of other movies I'd seen previously (What movie isn't nowadays?), was extremely enjoyable.  Watching this made me feel young again.  It made me forget about all the worries that an adult life brings, and just enjoy myself in the moment.  Many people argue that the acting in this movie was subpar.  These people say that the portrayals of the characters were downright cartoonish.  I would argue strongly against that.  For the type of movie that this is, the good versus evil portrayals given by the actors works in the movie's  favor.  Sam Worthington especially does well.  If you haven't seen him in Terminator: Salvation, do so.  He made the movie worth watching.

Now, to get to the actual product at hand.  I ordered the Blu Ray / DVD combo pack from Amazon.  From the moment the menu came onto my screen, I knew this was going to be something special.  When I pressed play, there was no turning back.  Over the next three hours, my senses were completely assaulted and my mind was dumbstruck.  Simply put, James Cameron's Avatar on the Blu Ray format is the best picture and audio we have seen or heard to date.  I have a feeling it will be years before anything better is brought to the table.  Watching the visuals was more stimulating than looking at a real life forest.  Every detail could be seen from far and away.  The walls of my house shook, and I just hope the neighbors did hear.  I would tell them to buy the movie themselves and experience it.

With this release comes certain issues.  While I don't have any of them myself, I will still talk about them as it would be uninformative of me to not.  This release of Avatar is not in 3D.  Many people complain about this, and a large percentage of those people do not even have the right equipment to properly experience 3D yet.  The technology for home theater 3D is very new and very pricey.  Next year, after all the quirks have been worked out, is when we will likely see Avatar in a home release 3D format.  Another gripe is the complete lack of special features.  This again has a good reason.  In the Special Edition coming later this year, there will be scenes incorporated into the movie not even visually completed yet.  Documentaries in high definition have to be put together.  A commentary track needs to be recorded.  No one is being forced to buy this ""stripped"" edition, however. I am one of the people who will knowingly double or triple dip on this.  The reason for that is because I love it so much.

Now to the biggest complaint.  During the initial release, many people were complaining that Avatar would not play in their Blu Ray players.  The reason for that seems to be some new copy protection put on the disc.  While I was not one of the people with this problem, I can certainly sympathize with those who did.  A new firmware update is all it will take to fix the issue.  My PS3, which serves as my Blu Ray player, had a firmware update ready for me before I watched the movie.

So if you are one of the millions who loved Avatar when you saw it in theaters, or one of the people who didn't get around to seeing it, now is your time.  Pick this movie up right away without hesitation.  Keep an open mind, and let yourself become immersed.  You do not want to miss what many people believe is one of the top movies of all time.",1271980800,74,4035,4.392422192151556
3933785,5,B002HEXVUI,"I read everyone's review about how this blu-ray version doesn't include all the bells & whistles of most new releases especially the 3D version. But i decided to buy it anyway. Let me tell you that you won't be disappointed. If you have a true high def TV (decent size) then it is all worth it. The colors are amazing & the clarity is just unbelievable. I didn't get to see this in theaters so maybe that adds a little more to my viewing experience on my 52"" TV. In my opinion, the 3D version would be too much. My eyeballs were constantly moving trying to capture everything on my screen. As for the extras that are not included in this (menu goes straight to movie menu where there are not many options), who really watches those anyway. I know out of all the movies I own maybe a handful have I actually watched any of those extras & they usually aren't anything special. Buy this version & you won't be disappointed!!!",1271980800,8,922,4.366279069767442
3933786,5,B002HEXVUI,"After reading the negative reviews of this movie, I felt compelled to re-list my own review. Obviously people aren't getting the message. This movie is reminiscent - obviously - of what we Cherokee endured. I actually wept many times while watching it, knowing the parallels hidden within, perhaps overlooked by those not ""Native American"". The action, CG, technical effects and acting - all have depth and subtle, underlying meaning - especially in the scientific and military crews. If you're a CG appreciator, go for it - purchase this movie. There's more to it though, but the effects are astonishing. So now, risking cyber-throttling for my diatribe to come, here goes. Just take into consideration that people have different reasons for enjoying movies, and their consequent value. Not only is this an important movie, it may awaken all who see it - including some Human Beings - so many whom have slept in apparent complacency - for so long, side by side with those who attempted to slaughter us all not too long ago - and for the same reasons depicted in this remarkable movie. Resources. Land. Greed. Should this happen? Should we awaken? It is inevitable. Just as the travelers experienced a long sleep prior to reaching their destination, this analogy was not lost on me. I've noticed a few comment mentions indicating ""Native American"" likenesses, but decided to expand the obvious nature I perceived - as well as many friends. We saw it clearly from the beginning. So, in order to assist understanding from this viewpoint, here goes. Our oldest Cherokee authenticated ""city"" has been dated at over 5,000 years. This was a major trading center, there were many more. We have learned to be patient, and learned it well, most recently by the terrible things done to us - truly genocide. In order for Euros to own land, resources and people - we learned the reality of who is empowered here - then and now. Impossible not to recognize in this film, this correlation. At the least the earth would be protected once again if Cherokee and all our Native Nations had the opportunity for legitimate governmental input - this movie merely condenses the action, bringing to fore the tranquil previous lives on Pandora - and like us, thanking wildlife for giving their lives in order to sustain ours. Could something ""real"" like this happen here? Yep. It could. However, knowing what we do for sustenance in this would require research and time....something people don't have these days, in this economy, with required two income households, ninety+ hour work weeks, etc. I suppose one must truly want to learn how to feed their families if there weren't grocery stores, but there is nothing available in these stores able to surpass the nectar of ripe blackberries picked from a wild bush or the satisfaction of eating a personally tended tomato while standing in your own garden, its juices running down your arm. The Indiginous beings inhabiting Pandora were working with their unique planet, relishing its fruits - so well depicted by Jake's Avatar - and something we Cherokee still enjoy right now, right here, today. That's how Native cultures survived here for centuries. Yes, it would be difficult to the extreme for most to live that way; the required change in lifestyles. Not for us, however. At the worst? People will not exist here in the US from whence we ""Native Americans"" came - and continue to come, albeit with quite different lifestyles for most, yet I believe Human Beings would flourish once again if we were forced to return to the old ways. Well, not so very old. In this movie? The indiginous humanoids were knowledgable, working with and enjoying the bounty of their planet. They are Human Beings in this film. Only ""Native American"" readers will understand what I mean. We will continue to survive, for we know how. I realize this may be perceived as nonsense by many readers. Know this and make no mistake: we teach Our Own our way, and the crucial importance of balance within the earth wherever we live, (it would surprise you all) however we may appear - the blond guy with blue eyes and an Irish name in the next cubicle may be Indian. Yes, I said Indian. This politically correct nonsense makes little sense to my clan. Indian = indiginous, shortened to Indian all over the world. We frequently recognize Our Own, just as depicted by the female shaman in this movie. The Earth is the main thing to protect as was Pandora...protect it, and it shall feed and protect us who continue living; understand the sad truth that we, here, not only in the US but globally, are on the edge of the abyss. This is the most profound depiction in movie form I have seen reflecting this fact to date, CG, special effects, well fleshed-out characters and all. I have watched many movies, and noticed their changes along with the times. These are strange days. Recently, movies began to reflect current horrors - real horrors, not only to us Indians, but to us all - and in incredibly intelligent formats. I wonder who will live? I wonder who will flourish? Watch the movie. Our journey, again, is much the same, regardless of the format amd plot. Awaken. This movie, when watched in this manner may open your eyes...allowing folks to become much more cognizant here in the US especially - and those who haven't, to wake up. This I hope. This we hope. This we shall work toward, for it is the only way. We lived, we endured, in spite of the odds. We learned. Just as the Avatars did. All Cherokee didn't see the humor in relocation and the consequent Trail of Tears. And registration? Further removal of our freedom by shedding our blood via lies in hope of killing us off completely? Schools which included nothing of our own history? Incomprehensible. Unacceptable. We did not all go. We, of my clan did not go. Research what I write. You may learn something amazing. Try the keyword Yahoo Falls, see the last recognized atrocity - certainly, there have been many, many others - this, a minor one in Euro eyes, and then weep yourselves. Heart-breaking, it is forever remembered by us, passed down to our children - who made up the majority of lives taken at Yahoo Falls on their journey to safety, so they thought. Killing children. This is not our way. However, it is the way accomplished in so many fashions by Big Corporation - the true government - here and globally - as well as on Pandora. This is an important addition to anyone and everyone's film library, should be protected, and utilized as an unique learning tool. It is worthy. Let us not revisit the past, but learn from it by whatever means grace us all - i.e., this movie, any genius medium which brings history and possibility to light, research on the 'net - however you can learn about the reality of these strange days. History repeats itself. Perhaps this was an intentional attempt by Cameron to enlighten folks...who knows what motivation pushes some? We who were here before shall continue our attempts to live peacefully on and of these lands. Should peace be an impossibility? We shall do exactly what we did in WW II, and that was the right thing at that time. But, let's not get into these war and nuclear issues - we hope there will never be another bomb. Anywhere. If only a single pair of eyes open via the effects on folks from this incredible movie, that's a wonderful thing. Like the indigenous inhabitants of Pandora, we hope for the best - and handle the worst. Here and now, we hope those in government positions cease to speak out of the side of their mouths. Money and greed? They have no home. We Indians shall live on, for Human Beings are graced with a Home, an eternal one - we hope - Earth. Pandora's Human Beings lived that way. And they fought well, with Honor. Enough about our reality. See this film, and try to learn from it in ways more than how impressive its CG effects are or the entertainment value, or what tiny mistakes there may be - if any. I don't see any - but some viewers do. Regardless, this is worth the investment - purchase the DVD or Blu-ray. See it on Video on Demand. You will not regret it. As far as waiting for the additional releases? Heck, I'll purchase them all. Thanks for reading my lengthy comment. I welcome any replies. Anyone who doesn't understand the parallel between the ""blue people"" and us Indians? I will happily describe the historical likenesses in great detail. Be well - everyone.",1271980800,7,8438,4.705882352941177

3933788,5,B002HEXVUI,"Simply put, this is the most stunning Blu Ray I've seen. The colors, the detail are simply remarkable. YES it is a double dip - as Fox and Cameron HAVE ALWAYS ADMITTED a more elaborate edition is on the way. It is NO SECRET. So, if you don't want to buy a strict movie only edition, don't buy it. I'm not sure why people are upset as clearly there is a choice offered. The movie is only 4 months old, there's no time to assemble alternate cuts and the no doubt in-depth supplements we'll see later. So every official announcement stated plainly this was a movie only edition with a loaded version to follow. Giving you a choice. Buy, rent, or wait. So it's really not clear how people are being ripped off?

The movie itself plays much better in 2Dd as opposed to 3D. The story, while simple and told many times before, works well. My girlfriend was even drawn into the film and liked the ""love story"" elements. The movie is epic, no doubt, sweeping and grandiose. Entertaining and exciting.

When I popped the disc in and it actually worked on my Sony Blu-ray (which hasn't had a firmware update in over a year) I was overjoyed. I did get one glitch in chapter 16 but it was OK when I re-powered. I will update the firmware. The fluorescent colors are the best I've ever seen on a movie.
Some similarities to Dances with Wolves:
1. War scarred soldier goes to far away territory.
2. Meets girl with bad hairdo.
3. Writes diary.
4. The rest would be spoilers. So buy it and watch it.
What a great job they did to convince you that you are watching actual people, or creatures. It's not till after that you might think,,,hey did I just watch a cartoon? Naw, they were real!
So people are complaining about the lack of extra features. Well Cameron has been a very busy man lately. It's gonna take a little more time to get some good features and commentaries together. I was happy to pay the $19.99 as is.

3933792,1,B002HEXVUI,"Please note this review is about the product, not the movie.

There are zero special features on these two discs (blu-ray & dvd).  I was shocked to get this in the mail today only to find no special features.  Then I find out James Cameron has already confirmed a special edition due out in November with 20-40 extra minutes of additional footage and most likely special features.  Let me get this straight, we (the average consumer) made Avatar the number one grossing movie of all time and this is how you repay us?  By giving us the short end of the stick?

If you consider that this release has no special features, this makes Avatar the most over priced Blu-Ray disc I've purchased yet.  First Lord of the Rings, now Avatar.  We need to send a clear message to the distributors and movie producers that we will not put up with this kind of service.  I love this movie and have been eagerly anticipating it's release on Blu-Ray only to find it the worst released title to this format.

Shame on 20th Century Fox for this sub-par release, and shame on James Cameron for not sticking up for what is right.

I must say this 2-D Blu-ray is absolutely stunning, beautiful, and more vivid and vibrant than watching it in the theaters. It's like watching a different version of the movie.  [I'm viewing this through my Panasonic 42"" 1080P plasma TV (it has been color calibrated) from 8' away.]  I find, I enjoy the crispness of this 2-D Blu-ray version more than the 3-D (in the theaters), because some of the background is a bit hazy in order to enhance the 3-D effect in the foreground, thus scarficing some of the clarity.

The picture is breath taking and the sound is just amazing. Our family enjoy a lot of great Disney Pixar movies and AVATAR could be this incredible movie for adults.

If you only have to buy one bluray movie this year, AVATAR should be it.  I just finnished watching the movie and I can not wait to see it again.",1271894400,10,475,4.2555555555555555

Avoid this early money making rip off.  You will want to wait for a better version that has extra cool stuff that will probably cost about the same.

Avatar represents the second great propaganda film of the 21st Century.  The first was V-for Vendetta.  Every fantasy story about the evils of humans in the world is played out in vivid blue colors.  But since I LOVE propaganda films, I really enjoyed it for what it really is.

The academy awards hold far less weight for me now and I trust the Golden Globes more. But I really want the maximum length of this film. I first saw Avatar, the 2:55 version, then it was reduced to the 2:30, but I hear there is a 3:14 and this is my preference. I will hold off on any purchase of the DVD until then.",1271894400,,428,4.168674698795181

I don't even mind the somewhat derivative plot---in fact, I actually like stories about underdogs fighting imperialist bullies. Make the underdogs exotic tribal warriors, the bullies space marines, add a bunch of prehistoric-looking animals, and set it in a gorgeous jungle setting, and you have an awesome movie.

What prevents me from giving this DVD 5 stars is the special features---or rather, the complete lack of them. Other than basic setup stuff and the movie itself, this DVD has nothing on it. I would have at least appreciated a director's commentary.",1271894400,,620,4.961538461538462

After watching the movie on my Panasonic High Definition Plasma TV, I was totally blown by quality of the picture and the fantastic DTS True-HD surround sound on this disc. Even though Avatar on Blue-ray is not in 3D,it is the next best thing to watching it in theaters. If you have a good HD video and audio equipment, this Blue-ray will show case your system the best. By the way, my Sony model BDP S-560 player had no problem playing back this disc.

Thanks James a heads up on your new security software would have been nice.

As most of you know this movie has no extras, but it does come with a fantastic DVD version. Why anyone would want an extra copy of this movie on DVD when they bought the Blu-ray version is beyond me.

I loved the movie and seen it many times in theaters. However, when my friend bought this movie and we wtched it on DVD we were shocked. Not only are there no extras, there were MISSING SCENES. There were some scenes in the movie that were not on the dvd version. I heard that another version will come out that will include new scenes and footage and the extras and the 3D version, but you ave to wait till the end of the year to even 2011.

 Now i don't really care about having it in 3D or not but i want the extras and not have missing scenes. and i hate how these movie companies are releasing a crappy version first then a special later just to get your money. just do it like they used to and have all versions out t the same time. im waiting to buy this movie because im not going to pay for it twice.

I suggest that if you havnt bought it yet that you wait for the real versions. If you already bought it well hope you can return it or sell it and get the better version.",1271894400,2,1064,4.004716981132075

I was eagerly awaiting the release of the home video version only to be terribly disappointed in the bare bones version released today.  The most technically complex film produced in history and they don't include any real features of note in the initial video release.  Unbelievable.  Like Fox needs more money.  Until the expanded edition comes out, with behind-the-scenes featurettes like picture-in-picture comparisons of actors performances before being digitally enhanced, I am not wasting a dime on this rot.  This is a version for your grandma to watch, not anyone else.  They should've put it on VHS.  That's all it's worth.",1271894400,2,698,4.956896551724138

Well do that and you are missing out on the finest blue ray disc ever made.  The color and detail are stunning and this will truly show off the power of your BD player and HDTV.  This is one to show off to your friends for sure.  I've never seen a blue ray look even close to this good.  I own over a 100 BD's myself, and have rented dozens more.  The closest I can think of is Speed Racer.  Also the audio is phenomenal!  Have you seen Iron Man or Rambo on BD?  This is better than both of those.  The only disc that I've seen with better audio is probably the LOTR collection.  But seriously, do yourself a favor and BUY THIS NOW!  You will not be disappointed.  Plus, if you are a true fan you'll probably go out and get the Ultimate Edition and the 3D version when they come out.

Give me details so I can make an informed purchase.

People talk about how CEO's of corporations make too much money. Spare me... Remember Star Wars - trilogy on VHS and then Lucas added his CGI and came out with another version.  Then of course on DVD and then all six, etc. etc.  It is endless the versions they come out with, but hey, why not - people keep buying it.

So, no for me on Avatar.  The visuals were good.  The storyline was cliche'.  I just wanted to see it on my home theater.  I'll buy something else.",1271894400,,842,4.135802469135802
3933812,1,B002HEXVUI,"I am extremely disappointed James Cameron and the studio decided to release this movie with NO SPECIAL FEATURES AT ALL!!!!!  There isn't even any previews of other movies.  JUST the movie.  When I pre-ordered this Blu-Ray I was excited to be able to see it again.  I had a lot of mixed emotions when I saw it in the theater (in Imax-3D).  The 3D technology was incredible. I enjoyed the movie from an entertainment stand point but was a little put off by the 'way to easy' references to the Green movement and the plight of the American Indians.  Not that he referenced these points, but by how obvious and sometimes cheesy these references were... 'Unobtainium'? Well the more I thought about the movie later the more I liked it in my mind.  So I was looking forward to getting it on Blu-Ray and especially to see the extras.  I was VERY eagerly waiting to see a making of documentary since Cameron basically took the relatively new technology of motion capture to the N'th degree and beyond.  But, alas, NOTHING.  I was very upset when I got home, put it in the Blu-Ray player and found no special features listed.  Then I came to Amazon and read some reviews and found out they are releasing a new edition in November with all the features I think everyone was expecting.  Too bad James Cameron didn't seem to make enough money two of the highest grossing films of all time that he had to dupe us into buying this nearly worthless edition by not letting it be known ahead of time that there would be a second edition.  Now, if I am not too mad still in November, I will have to buy the NEW edition to see the making of I have been waiting for.  Besides if he was so conscious of the environmental impact, he would realize that he is going to create a lot of plastic cases that may end up in the landfills. Because, let's face it, who will want this edition when the new one comes out?",1271894400,3,1887,4.354285714285714

Instead, Fox will release an ultimate edition in November. What the hell is that about? I just bought the combo pack ; believe me, I will be taking it back to Target early tomorrow morning. If you care about getting more bang for your buck and care about the extra stuff,stay away from this edition and wait a few months. If you really want to see this movie at home, Rent It!

3933814,3,B002HEXVUI,"Ok, I'm not a fanboy, and I expect there will be a lot of people who disagree with what I'm about to say, but I wanted ""regular"" people who are thinking about buying this to have a (somewhat) fair review.

I saw Avatar in the theater in 3D (simply because I felt it was one of those ""experience"" movies that you'd forever be kicking yourself if you didn't get to go see).  It was good, but I really didn't see what was so life-changing about the story.  It's pretty thin, and sometimes a little cheesy.  Not bad, mind you, but not enough for me to think of Avatar as the best movie of all time.  The effects are another story.  I understand that years from now we may actually look back on Avatar as a game changer for how movies are made and perceived.  The 3D effect was not overdone, but while cool, I still felt it didn't add to the story.  Maybe repeated viewings would have changed my mind, we'll never know.

So now, I received my Blu-ray/DVD combo today.  I'm enough of a movie fan that I've spent tens of thousands of dollars in equipment and dvd/blu-rays to give myself the best experience possible in my home.  So my first problem here is the lack of special features.  I know it's been discussed to death, and I understand that some people don't care about them and some people do (I'm one of those).  I appreciate Fox rushing the movie out so quickly, but I'm not convinced that the ""double dipping"" was necessary.  I've made my peace with that though, but it should be noted for the sake of the review that there is a lack of special features.

Now here's the reason I have to give Avatar a 3 out of 5 (instead of the 5 out of 5 I'd hoped this disc would be ... I wanted a Blu-ray I could show people to show them how awesome it is):  I popped the blu-ray into my home theater PC and fired up the disc ... and got frozen picture and pixilation.  Fox has encoded Avatar (blu-ray) with a new encryption that is incompatable with a few players, requiring an upgrade.  Fine -- this is not my first trip around the block, and I understand that firmware updates are necessary to improve protection methods to deter pirates.  Unfortunately, I'm hearing estimates of a day or 2 for an update so I can watch my movie.  I can live with that, but Avatar was released on a Thursday. so a Friday/weekend night viewing seems out of the picture.  This is a (second) slap in the face for someone who OWNS the blu-ray.  I can't watch something I paid for, and I totally blame Fox, not the software manufacturer's.  They *knew* firmware updates were going to be needed (heck it even says it at the top of the page here), but because of a concern of piracy, discs were not made available to manufacturers until the day of release, causing half of the end-consumers to be left in the dark.  I am beyond angry about this.  Many who wait to buy this (which is what I'd recommend), will probably not have this issue.  But you might, so just a warning.

So, I did the only thing I could -- I popped in the DVD and watched that.  I stopped about 20 minutes in.  This movie is really meant to be enjoyed on blu-ray (and 3D, but that's a whole different story).  DVD was okay, but not DTS audio was really disappointing.

Movie?  3 out of 5
Blu-ray? Unrated/Unwatchable
DVD? 2 out of 5 (no DTS audio, movie doesn't look as good as the (few) frames of the blu-ray I could watch, but that's sort of expected.)

Overall?  I'm majorly disappointed.",1271894400,4,3431,4.309375

But this release, though ""widescreen"" to a degree, is not presented in the theatrical CinemaScope aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  I expect that they are using the IMAX version, which has a squarer screen than typical movie theaters.  I purposefully didn't go see the movie in an IMAX theater because I enjoy the wide-widescreen of regular CinemaScope presentations... even if the screen isn't as gargantuan as IMAX.

I'm disappointed because I love the movie, but I will wait for Fox to get their act together and release this movie the way I want to see it.  It will probably sell like hotcakes, but I secretly hope it doesn't until they release a better version.",1271894400,3,890,4.709677419354839

I'm not about to invest several thousand on new hardware, only to have to replace it again once the standard is finalized past the ""Minimum"" - remember the first milti-media PC's?  The standards changed every few months and were finally simi-finalized a couple of years later. The same will happen for 3D.

Way too many companies screw-over the public by re-re-re-releasing movies.  Remember ""Stargate"" - ?  The original release, limited edition release, anniversary release, director's cut, limited edition director's release and so on. Literally. Same with LOTR.  What, four different versions on DVD, with and without little statues?  Now the same thing with LOTR on BluRay. Same with Resident Evil. Now Avatar.  I'll bet we'll see five versions over the next year or so. This release, the Director's Cut, the cinema 3D version, Director's cut 3D version, then we'll see a special extended (we found missing footage!!!) super duper cut. Probably followed by the ""Official extended director's cut with a look back on the social impact of Avatar.""

Just look at all the versions of Army of Darkness.  This will be even worse.  I was going to purchase this, but decided to jump off the little hamster wheel.  I'll wait several months and then pick from the myriad releases.

I did rent it.  Guess what? It was not that great. Without 3D it's nothing special.  I lost count of how many ideas were ripped off from better movies.",1271894400,7,1590,4.81549815498155

3933821,3,B002HEXVUI,"It is very very hard for me to give this low stars, but I am not reviewing the movie, I am reviewing the blu-ray.  The Movie gets 5 stars as a movie, the blu-ray gets 1-star as a blu-ray disc.  BUT it also include a standard DVD as part of the package.  So overall all the average is 3 stars.  First let me just say it is very very beautiful to look at on a 50in Plasma tv.  THAT being aid it has NO, i repeat NO special features.  I did not know this when I pre-order the DVD (when it was originally price at $39.00).  Now I know why it is 50% off.  The blu-ray has only the version that was in theaters and it sounds great and it looks great, but since this is 2010, we are now spoiled.  We want more than just the movie, at least I do.  And we know what they did with Terminator 2 and the many versions of DVD that came out on.  We know that Cameron likes to tell us about his movie, and how it is made.  We seen specials on TV (HBO) on Avatar.  Yet all we get is just the movie... HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING.  For those who haven't seeen the movie, I say get it immediately. For those that want more, wait, there will be a special featured AVATAR released in the future.  We may see a slow roll out of this movie (basically several versions) for months because a popular movie like this, they want you to buy multiple copies.  Here is a novel ideal... if you buy this version, give it away as a gift to someone who hasn't seen it or to a child once the spectacular version comes out.

3933823,5,B002HEXVUI,"Five months after ""Avatar"" received its initial big-screen release, we are presented with its first release to the home-video market. Much has been written about the double and triple-dipping. We know this is a bare-bones release, devoid of ANY extras, special features, deleted scenes, commentary, etc. We know the studio is releasing a more complete edition of the film on Blu-ray in November 2010, and a 3D version at some point in the future. We've all heard the complaints from those who think this stripped-down version is merely a cash grab. So now Earth Day has arrived, and ""Avatar"" has been released in this bare-bones edition. For those who, like me, love the movie, and want to have something on-hand to enjoy until the more thorough release arrives in the months to come, is this worth it?

In a word, yes.

This Blu-ray is the movie only, with some basic search/bookmarking features and subtitles. There is no commentary, no trailers, no previews, no annoying advertisements that play before the movie starts. It's the movie only, much like the way DVDs presented films back in the early days of that format. You insert the disc (the disc loads and starts playing automatically in my Sony BDP-S570). There will be a moment or two of a blank screen as the disc loads. You'll see a brief message informing you to update your player's firmware if you experience any problems playing the disc. Then you'll see a piracy warning (thankfully it's brief), and then a basic Fox Home Video title screen. Now you come to a nicely animated menu screen, which gives you options to play the film, set up your options or search for a scene or bookmark.

The disc has an advanced feature which allows you to resume playback if you power your player off during the film playback. This option comes on automatically when you turn on the player again, even if you've removed the disc and reinserted it.

The video quality is astonishing, easily besting last month's Toy Story and Toy Story 2 releases from Disney. You have a full 16x9 (1.78:1) picture, which is how I remember the film being presented in RealD and Dolby 3D Digital in theatres. Colors are crisp and bright. No visible artifacts.

Audio is superb, a quite robust mix that will engage fully your 7.1 system.

This is the finest-looking Blu-ray of the year, thus far, and the best way to enjoy the film until the next more complete edition is released in November. Is this stripped-down edition a cash grab? I don't think so. I appreciate having a bare-bones release. It's refreshing to have a disc that is the movie only. Who needs all the junk that we get on most Blu-ray discs? Yes a making-of documentary would be fun, but is there anyone who loves the movie who doesn't already have some idea of the craft that went into making it?

This release is for people who love the movie, end of story. If you love the movie, you'll appreciate having such a wonderful, flawless transfer to enjoy in high definition at home. If you don't love the movie, you will find things to quibble about such as the lack of extras. I, for one, am happy with what we've got now.",1271894400,412,3119,4.6497277676951

Why not release a disc much like the one available today in concert with an ""ultimate"" edition with all of the other goodies that nerds like myself appreciate. I could care less about 3D, but I do think it is generally predatory to the consumer to not offer both options initially at the same time. I mean, its not like the version released today is all of the sudden going to be $10 when the ""ultimate"" edition comes out. I would venture to say, that come November, the DVD/Blu-Ray combo will still be somewhere around $30 (as per normal pricing for a new release combo pack) and the ""ultimate"" edition will be around $40-50 (also a combo pack i hope, and loaded with special features much like the aforementioned LOTR Special Extended Edition DVDs). If that is the case, I'll gladly fork over the couple extra bucks for the ""ultimate"" edition, but that by no means states that I endorse the sales practices of Mr. Cameron and FOX in any manner.

Frankly, I'll buy the movie in November, when some retailer is practically giving the movie away during the peak of holiday shopping season.",1271894400,3,1283,4.554112554112554

3933831,5,B002HEXVUI,"EDIT: STOP COMPLAINING! if you care that much about extra features and not the movie, then you can just wait for the other releases and shut up already.

It seems like those giving bad reviews for this care more about extra features then the actual movie and quality. Personally I could careless about dvd/blu-ray extras. I rarely ever mess with them. But seeing as this movie is almost 3 hours long, looks great and you get a dvd copy with it, then its worth the $20.

Movie it-self:

This is the first time I seen it. Did not watch it in theaters or in 3D so I waited for the blu-ray release. Though the whole story and movie itself I think was a little over rated being as its a simple, known story that is every where don't in a simple way, it still was done well. Its very unoriginal and preachy but anyone with common sense or isn't heartless would agree with the message that everyone already knows.

3 out of 5

Picture quality:

This is where the movie shines. This easily the best picture quality on blu-ray yet. Crisp, clean, vibrant. Think of the Imax scenes from The Dark Knight and how good they looked. Avatar is the Imax version throughout the while film but looks even better. This is mainly due to most of the movie being computer generated images thus the clean and vibrant look. This is the movie you use to show off your High def entertainment system. The picture and sound quality alone warrants the purchase. Most people will be amazed by the quality.

6 out 5

Sound Quality:

To most the sound quality will seem like its just as good as many other movies on blu-ray but if you have a good quality sound system, you'll be immersed in the environment sounds and the chanting. The battle scenes rival that of other big action movies without over using the sub woofer. The only bad part is some of the in door dialogue sounds either echos really bad to where it sounds like their are repeating themselves making it hard to understand certain things they say or the opposite where in some scenes the voices sound muffled. Out door dialogue is great though.

4.7 out 5

Extras :

true there is no real extras but you do get a dvd copy of the movie with it. While stores are selling the dvd version for near $20 or more, you're getting both the blu-ray and dvd version for that price. As I stated earlier, I don't really care about dvd/blu-ray extras since I find most of them to be boring and pointless unless you care about how movies are made.

3933837,2,B002HEXVUI,"I'll start off by saying that yes the special effects are something to behold, but in this day and age i just wish some directors would go back old school, ditch the super CGI effects and make a great film with a great story. There is no substance here, it lacks any ""real"" plot other than the corruption(again like Aliens and Terminator) of a coporate greedy company who wants to scathe the land for its own profit regardless of the outcome. They are on the planet to collect a rock called Unubtainium, i mean come on is that the best you get from James Camerons mind? As in unubtainable get it huh? huh? The movie starts as a very adult kind of film right out of the box with the gds and other four letter expletives, then once they start to move into the Avatar bodies its like a Disney adventure with strange looking creatures and horrible kidish dialogue. To me the Navu' look silly and i just couldn't take the movie seriously or even with a grain of salt for that matter. It just seemed like Aliens meets Pochahontus and seemed more for kids than adults, remove the adult language and thats basically what you would have had. I was pretty siked when it first came out, it just looked like an awesome spectical for the eyes which is ""all"" it turned out to be. I was also excited to see the return of Seagorney Weaver after all these years but her dialogue seemed as though she was being forced to play Ellen Ripley(Aliens movies) and not herself, especially when  she first gets out of the cryostasis chamber and rants ""Where my God D cigarette"". Sam Worthington did a pretty noble job and carried the movie from an actors perspective very well, much like with Clash Of The Titans, i look forward to him in some more down to earth drama type rolls in the future. So this movie is basically just a puffed up CGI fest for people to watch on there Plasma and LCD tvs, nothing more nothing less. I personally would by the Lovely Bones on Blu ray before this, and i just may, at least Peter Jackson is laying of the super special effects for awhile, so come on James make another epic Titanic or even a last Terminator, or Aliens movie, thats what people want believe me i know.",1271894400,6,2179,4.380246913580247

Fellowship of the Ring is the only film in that trilogy that on the whole I think benefitted, although there are things they added that I dislike.

There are those who will go through all sorts of rationalizations to deny this, to tell us that it is JUST a movie and that it has no meaning, no implications, no significance whatever beyond mindless entertainment.

But there is a prompt and overwhelming refutation of that point of view to be had immediately - WATCH THE MOVIE.

A MAGNIFICENT achievement at all levels.  Many thanks to James Cameron and the thousands of people and long hours of work involved in producing this blockbuster!

Also, I have not yet checked, having just seen it, but I hope their will be a novelization of this great film ... with the idealogical parts included!

  ive seen it in imax 3D(digital-shutter glasses), digital widescreen 3D(polarized), and now on blu-ray, i gotta say digital wide 3D was the best. the aspect ratio was full wide(imax crops it), and the quality of the 3d seemed better. imax was HUGE and in my face, and awesome, but simple polarized 3D in full screen let me see the full frames, as they were meant to be seen. until i get a 240hz tv, the blu-ray is the way to go. the dark knight was my favorite blu-ray for detail up until tonight.
cons-
sadly, no scene where we see jake tame his big ride (imax only?)
no 3D. you do catch alot of detail, now that yer brain isn't working out the perspective, but those 3D flight scenes for me were like spiritual head.

3933846,5,B002HEXVUI,"This is BY FAR the best looking and sounding blu ray disc I have ever seen.

PICTURE QUALITY
The picture quality is beyond description and is so clear that it is like looking through a window.  The colors are vibrant beyond belief.  Every detail of every image is sharp and exquisite.  I've never seen anything like it for a home theatre system before. The image had more detail than I noticed during the 3D presentation I saw in the theatre and the colors were even more vivid.  Many scenes on this disc look as though they are in 3D, there is that much depth to the images.  I'm beyond words to describe how incredible this disc looks.

AUDIO QUALITY
For english language this disc offers DTS 5.1 HD audio and DOLBY 5.1.  I listened to the DTS. The sound is equal to the image.  Every speaker in your system will be busy with this one.  Rear speakers are in constant use with all sorts of immersive sound effects and the subwoofer will shake your house.  This is spectacular entertainment and unprecedented in home video history.

PACKAGE AND FUNCTIONALITY
The 2 disc set comes in a striking reflective slip case.  The discs are housed in a standard sized two disc keep case with the left side containing the DVD and the right side holding the blu ray disc.  The disc menus are gorgeous and very easy to navigate.  Pop up menu is quick and easy to read.  There are NO FORCED TRAILERS or advertisements before the menu pops up but there are the usual warning screens.  Although my player is usually fast loading, this disc took a bit more time to load than most (about one minute).

EXTRAS
There are none unless you count the DVD as an extra.  There are however two inserts.  One is a $25 off certificate toward the purchase of a Panasonic Blu ray player.  The other insert contains an access code to the website which allows you to watch bonus material/sneek preview stuff.

FINAL THOUGHTS
It isn't expensive. It is well worth the money (at least to me) as I found it to be the most impressive home video release (in terms of picture and sound quality) that I have ever seen.  Buy it!",1271894400,18,2086,4.4603174603174605

3933850,5,B002HEXVUI,"Hello to everyone who reads this. I have bought from Amazon over 125 Blu-ray titles by now.. and this would be my first ever review on a Blu-ray title if I am not mistaken I think I did one review on ""Short Circuit ""  not sure. I still didn't get my ""Avatar"" Blu-ray from Amazon, as at the time I am writing this, it is 04-21-2010 12:37PM on PST. I should receive my copy of ""Avatar"" Blu-ray tomorrow which is 04-22-2010 on it's official  schedule release on ""Earth's day"". Yet I received a copy of it on Blu-ray yesterday from another very well known source to me which  I can't mention  here due to legal street issues date. Firstly I have to let you all know that my friends TV is calibrated and this review is mainly based from what I see on my friends calibrated  TV settings. ( in other words if your TV is not yet been calibrated please don't blame my review after watching ""Avatar"" on your none-calibrated TV )  Let me start with just saying this UNBELIEVABLE quality. I have no idea how Mr. Cameron did it. This is the best-ever Blu-ray title  that I have ever witness. Just amazing and mind blowing ( Waiting on Star Wars Blu-ray set and hoping it will have the same quality knowing Mr. G.Lucas )  It took my breath away. ( I think I disturb my friend Gary many times while watching the movie by parsing the quality of it) Mainly I take my hat off to Mr. Cameron for  giving the viewers of ""Avatar"" experience by taking off all that Hollywood crap out from the menu which they usually adds... and cheers again  for that Mr. Cameron. Cheers a lot for having respect for viewers. Cheers again  for giving us a such a nice treat we appreciate your art with great respect. My ratings on video quality I gave it a Five Stars, Audio Quality I gave it a Five Stars, Overall Blu-ray quality I gave it a Five Stars,Overall for the movie 'Avatar"" Five Stars and Two thumbs up.

  I do also know that the release on 22nd of ""Avatar"" will not have the extra Forty Five minutes. But Mr. Cameron were nice enough to let us know way-ahead about it so we can make our choice of which version to by such as April 22nd release or the late November 'Avatar""  Directors Cut release. Therefore we will not have to double dip-it.  ( Not many in Hollywood movie industry does give that early information  of a late ""Directors Cut"" release before they release their very first title release, they always grab our money by releasing a late ""Directors Cut"" with a surprise )  Also I will not forget to thank the ""Fox"" Studio for releasing the Blu-ray for $ 19.99. Where they would have unarguably sold it for very easily over $ 26.99 ( which is considering with the cost of the movie/even though they covered in Two weeks of the opening well as thinking  of other prices of some  not so good new releases ) My hats off to you on that ""Fox"" Studio. Still there is one thing that bugs me and I am sad or rather upset about what ""Fox' Studio did. Which is stated here by me. ( this is only my opinion and does not say I am right here, but it's a strong opinion ) We here in USA produce all the Blockbusters  and still England and Europe gets the best deal and pricing why?. I don't know. It is a Million Dollar question for me. Example ""Avatar"" in England gets a choice to buy the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack with a Steel Book and other survival guide book of ""Avatar""  for British Pounds 24.99 which is $38.00 at today's currency exchange rate. Or else they can buy just the Blu-ray at a cheaper price.  It might be expensive for most of us yet the choice would have been give to us in  the USA market too. And most of other titles that are released in England and Europe they always  gets a very good buying options well as good pricing too... mainly Amazon UK. Then-again this is only my opinion like I have mentioned above. What I am trying to say here is.... we the USA make these films and such choice should have been given to us in USA too in-definitely . I have pre-ordered the USA and the UK version of it.. the UK version was ordered because I wanted the Steel Book Edition. But if the choice was given to the USA market I would have saved the $38.00 that I have spend on the UK ""Steel Book Edition' as it would  helped me on the long-run as I am going to buy the ""Avatar"" November ""Directors Cut"" release too. There-after if they release a 3D version I will not buy it because the movie was not shot on 3D camera. But still it would have help me if we in USA had the choice overall. My European version of ""Avatar"" Blu-ray will not go a waist as I will keep the steel book and give the Blu-ray to my nephew who lives in Spain. ( For those who are waiting for a good 3D movie... in 2011 Mr. Michael Bay's ""Transformer 3 "" is the best why!!!... he is shooting it in the real way how it is meant to be shot. With 2D and 3D dual lens anamorphic camera. Just a tip for fans.

  Overall my anonymous respect goes to Mr. Cameron for taking us into a such a wonderful,unforgettable  excursion in life. Million thanks to you again. And cheers to ""Fox"" Studio for keeping the price at $ 19.99 for Blu-ray and DVD combo pack. ( at Amazon )  And thanks for the great production crew of this movie ""Avatar""... well as let us not forget to thank the Geeks who work in it too without them there wouldn't be a ""Avatar"" movie. Cheers to all of you. I will not have to write in here asking people to buy it within another week time  if you read [...] I am very sure this will be the ( AVATAR ) most sold Blu-ray title in currant Blu-ray  history. Enjoy your ""AVATAR"" copy. Please if you can try  and calibrate  your TV before you watch it,  calibrate your sound system and watch it ON DTS-HD ( UNCOMPRESSED sound ) Those who doesn't have Blu-ray system and 1080P TV with their own good reasons... whenever time permits you please buy it as this is how movies are meant to be watch. I thank you all a lot for reading my review on ""Avatar"" Blu-ray. Take care may  Peace Prevail On Earth. Please plant a tree whenever you can, and don't destroy any that you have.

Love,

3933851,5,B002HEXVUI,"I liked the movie, so I'm giving it 5 stars. It has some of the best animation I've ever seen. It's even superior to FF7: Advent Children, which I own on BD. That movie is phenomenal, but seeing Avatar in 3d showed me that computer animation has vastly improved in the past few years. I think this is a movie worth owning if only for the technological aspect of it. Some people find the plot boring, a rip off, too predictable, etc. I agree. However, I don't watch movies for complicated plot devices and intricate character development. You cannot get that in 90 or even 120 minutes. (The only movies I've seen that even come close is the Sci-Fi channel's miniseries adaptation of Dune and Children of Dune. Both of which I own in the director's cut version; they're over 5 hours long each.) If you want detailed plots and characters, read 19th century novels. If you want some entertainment and decent plot and character development done in a limited amount of time, movies are much better for that. Avatar is entertaining, beautiful to look at, and has a positive message about not destroying the place where we live. Is it shallow? No more than anything else coming out of Hollywood. I'd say it's better than most of the movies I've seen in theaters lately.

This version doesn't have special features. I don't like them because I never look at them anyway. I wish more BD were done without trailers, previews, forced ads and other junk. I hate having to watch ads on a product I buy. I can watch trailers on youtube. All of these things take up space on discs, often to the detriment of the AV quality of the movie.

This version will make use of the large disc size to have the best picture and audio quality available. Is this a possible marketing ploy? Maybe. If they make use of the entire 50gb available on a BD-50 disc, then it will be literally the highest quality picture and sound ever offered on BD. I've never seen another BD devote the entire 50gb to just the movie. We will see in a few days whether or not it's a marketing ploy. If they make full use of the disc like they claim they're doing, I will be completely satisfied with my purchase.

This movie comes bundled with a coupon to buy the Ultimate version coming out later, so I could sell this one in several months and buy that one at a discounted price. If you only want the BD and not the DVD, you can sell that too. You're getting a BD AND DVD copy for $20 along with a coupon to get the extended version. How this isn't a good deal is beyond me.

I don't see why people are complaining about the lack of extras. Amazon should remove the one star reviews that only talk about how this is ""fake"" or inferior because it doesn't have special features. I don't want special features, and my 5 stars are for the movie itself. If you want special features, wait until they're done. They haven't finished making them yet, so they'll be out in November, a mere 7 months away. You can buy the movie now or the movie and special features later. This is not double or triple dipping. I'm glad the studios have announced their intentions. In my mind this makes them honest for telling the truth about what they're doing. We are all now informed consumers, so buy whatever version you want. For those that complain people won't know this doesn't have special features, I imagine people like to read the movie's info online or on the back cover at the store before they purchase it. If people don't read and, consequently, buy the wrong version, they are at fault for not taking the time to inspect a product before purchasing it. If you want only the movie, like me, then buy this version.

Edit:
After watching the movie numerous times on my HDTV, I'm still blown away by how good the picture looks. It really is stunning.",1271808000,9,3789,4.446043165467626
3933852,4,B002HEXVUI,"Saying this is an inferior release simply because it doesn't have extra's is kind of stupid.  When's the last time you seriously watched 'out takes' or any of the extra crap that drives up the price of a DVD more than once?  I've seen the 'extra' stuff on various DVD's I own a grand total of:

ONE TIME

So if I can get the movie, that I watched and enjoyed in the theater for 20 bucks, then WHO FREAKING CARES.

And as for 'deleted or extra scenes'  Tell me how many of those, after you see them, did you sit there and go 'Man that should have been in the movie!!'  Most of them are utter garbage and are best served by being on the cutting room floor.

I can guarantee one thing - If James Cameron wanted them in there, he would have left them in there because he has enough clout to have the movie be 6 hours and still release the stinking thing.  It was cut FOR A REASON you simpletons.

And as for someone crying about 3D versions.  Have you seen a 3D tv yet?  They are complete trash.  Like I'm going to sit on my couch like some sort of homotron wearing glasses and straining my eyes whenever I want to watch it.

I'm liking that this blu ray is 20 dollars.  Reasonable price for a reasonable movie.  If you insist on smearing yourself in peanut butter while watching extra footage that was CUT FOR A REASON, then knock yourself out and buy in November.

So enough with the tears and the 'warning the general public'.  I think most of you need to get back to your L.A.R.P. groups, hold hands, then go jump off a cliff.",1271808000,,1526,4.167808219178082
3933853,5,B002HEXVUI,"I love Avatar. I think it is a great movie. I highly recommend it. I am confused by all these reviews. Everyone is complaining that the movie is not being released in 3D. How many people are willing to spend $5000 for a 3D TV and Blu-ray Player? There are a lot of other 3D movies out there. Granted Avatar looks fantastic in 3D in the theater. Unfortunately watching Avatar at home in 3D is not an option. I don't feel we should berate the movie because we can't watch it at home in 3D. I agree that it sucks that they don't include any extras in the standard DVD version. However, how many people actually watch the extra stuff? Does it really matter for most people? Let's keep our reviews to the movie and not the DVD and Blu-ray content. Avatar needs to be celebrated as another great movie by James Cameron.",1271808000,8,813,4.3202614379084965
3933854,5,B002HEXVUI,"Let me see if I have this correct. Avatar is 19.99 since I have prime I get free shipping. I get a 10.00 off if I buy the upgraded one in the future, making this one 9.99. I can then take this one to the Movie Trading Company and get 3.00 to 5.00 for it if I am lucky but 3.00 is the most likely price. So I am out 6.99 to rent this for 7 months. That is a dollar a month, that is less that a Blockbuster rental, a Redbox rental or my Netflix subscrition. Tell me again why I should not buy this version? I get to watch this  as many times as I want for a dollar or 2 a month. Yes I am getting this and I am going to enjoy it. The ones that want to whine about things missing and waiting for the special edition can wait. I am going to enjoy the movie.",1271808000,16,752,3.670807453416149
3933855,1,B002HEXVUI,What a rip-off. No extras until November release of another DVD. Don't buy this release - send the money grubbing studios a message. How much $$$$ money do they need to milk from consumers? This was the number one grossing movie of all time. Scum.,1271808000,5,247,4.511111111111111

That is a pure dirty trick on hearing disabled people and people who need to improve English reading skill when they buy DVDs without English subtitle.  Also, we learned the truth dark secret for these DVD products - that Avatar DVDs came from China and they made those counterfeits DVDs since they were not capable to create English subtitle and closed caption.

3933857,1,B002HEXVUI,"While I thought Avatar was certainly enjoyable as a film, this DVD/BLU-RAY release of Avatar is very poor. The studio has quite deliberately not included any additional features or content, so that they can get people to buy a second ""special edition"" Avatar DVD/BLU-RAY at a later date. I recommend skipping this edition of Avatar completely. I may even skip the inevitable ""special edition"" because I'm so turned off by the studio's behavior.",1271721600,4,444,5.095890410958904
3933858,4,B002HEXVUI,"I see several comments and reviews that are bashing this particular DVD simply because there are no special features... Who really cares? Seriously? I think I have watched the special features on DVD *maybe* 2 times in my entire life. I don't know anyone that cares about special features.

As for 3D technology. I highly doubt it is perfected at this point. So, there is no need to rush out and buy a 3D ready HT system for probably another year, at least. However, after seeing this movie in 3D twice in the theaters, I do think that seeing it in HD will not be as rad as seeing it on a massive theater screen. Also, IF you happen to already have a 3D ready system, I highly doubt it will come close to the theater experience, unless you have a 3D HD projector and THOUSANDS, and I mean THOUSANDS of dollars wrapped up in your mini theater. I doubt the average consumer has the want, or knowledge of such things. What's my point?! I don't have one. LOL. I am just sharing my thoughts.

Basically, if you loved the movie and you don't give a rip about special features and scenes that WEREN'T in the movie, then I am sure that this will suffice. Avatar was a great movie, with state of the art 3D and HD ""stuff"". Not having a state of the art 3D ready system will more than likely make the movie not as good as it was in the theaters, however. So, just be ready for some disappointment in that sense.

I really want to get this movie home, watch it on my theater, and load it onto my iphone.  I agree with people not wanting to be double dipped, so just don't buy the November release.  This movie has a lot of dialogue and 99% of deleted scenes in movies need to stay deleted(we had to wait 20+ years for Star Wars added scenes that were awful!).  Watch the bonus features on utube, and instead buy one of the summer movies that will be hitting shelves on blu-ray around November.  Unlike LOTR, which we have all seen and purchased a million times, I don't want to wait for this release.  I still hope that everyone does stand firm on not buying decade old movies 2x-4x on blu-ray, after we have already bought them multiple times on dvd and vhs.

No need to rehash the film or specs - I think I have read 50 different outlines here of it all - just checking the outcome.

Testing on a variety of plasma and LCD displays, I was very pleased with how the presentation has come across. If the LCD panels are not tweaked to a certain extent the Navi can appear almost fake it is so clear. But the benchmark scenes throughout the film color and fill the displays in every way imaginable. I enjoyed the fact that there were no trailers or ads to fill either disc. There is only one insert for the online registration of fun sites and activities. The sound is mixed to a fulfillment level that exceeded how I thought it would be. The animal/jungle sounds fill every channel perfectly. I pause checked a hundred different spots and saw nothing to pick apart. I even tried/paused the listed goofs on various sites and I could not find several of them now.

The menu itself plays nice with moving scenes and pics in HD. The only manipulation is for bookmarks, otherwise as has been rehashed a million times - nothing else to review. A standard two disc BD case with each disc on their respective side (no hinges).

That said, I cannot comprehend how people are complaining about the theatrical release at such a low price.  Its the cost of two movie tickets for pete's sake!  You want to wait till November to get the extended edition and not be able to see the movie now, at home?
Are you waiting till Christmas for some new restaurant to open and are avoiding any other place until then because you don't want to ""waste your money""?
It's a wonderfully entertaining movie, it will have both BLURAY as well as DVD copies in the package, making the BLURAY version as cheap as the BLURAY version of HOME ALONE; and you complain?  Get the movie.  When the extended version comes out, give the old one to your kids, or your friends, or just use it as a deluxe and conversation-starting drink coaster.

Get a clue, people coming to this site most likely have seen and already want this movie and could care less about what disappointed some stranger about this flick.

While it's somewhat valuable to know if another BR is coming out with additional scenes I'm kind of unmoved by that too when it comes to the initial purchase. It's kind of refreshing to get just the movie that you watched and liked enough to order a copy for your home. So many BR/DVD packages come with so much extra junk (interviews I've already seen on other shows/cheap games/deleted scenes that should have stayed on the cutting room floor)that it's nice to see one put out with a more 'zen' approach.

Based on all the hype leading up to the release, I was expecting a new breakthrough in Special Effects that erased the distinction between reality and animation.

Yes, the animation was interesting.... but in no way realistic.

Instead the movie felt like being inside a video game.
The 3-D was an impressive technology, but for me a story is more important than eye candy, and AVATAR was simply a rehash of Pocohauntus with some subtle modern day political preaching tossed in by James Cameron.

So I respect the work that went into making this film.
That effort and hard work deserves respect and I would never take that lightly.

AVATAR served as an impressive showcase for some new 3D camera technology, but as a movie it left me flat and disinterested.

Certainly nothing I would ever care to watch again.

3933885,1,B002HEXVUI,"A lot of people get confused and upset when they see a bad rating for a movie that they really liked.  However, they need to be reminded that they are rating the overall product itself and not just writing a movie review.  If I was writing a review for this movie, then it would receive five out of five stars as Cameron has done some pretty amazing stuff.

However...I'm rating the product.

It's already been leaked that this edition will contain just the movie while they are going to release a special edition of it later this year that will contain a bunch of extra stuff including 20 to 40 minutes of footage from the cutting room floor.  So how would I rate this product knowing that a special edition is coming out later?

One star out of five.

The reason why is that a lot of folks who liked the movie well enough but not to the point where they have a new Avatar desktop theme are going to be pretty upset when the special edition is released later this year.  It's this kind of behavior from the film companies that are really starting to upset the consumer and will eventually force some people not to rush out and buy the product right away.  I myself will probably rent this video through Netflix or Redbox, but I won't buy it.

If all you want to see is the theatrical version of the movie sans 3D, then by all means, go ahead and buy this product.  If you are a movie fan like myself, save yourself the time and trouble by waiting a few more months for the special edition.

08/16/10 Edit:  As of today, one person found my review helpful while 12 others said that it wasn't.  Doesn't matter as today I can show why I rated the product the way I did originally.  The movie is being re-released into theaters on August 27 with additional footage.  It appears that the movie companies have taken that extra step to suck more money out of the consumers.  They release a movie in theaters, then on DVD, then re-release it in theaters with additional footage, and then sell the extended version on DVD.

Again, if I was rating the movie, it would have gotten a five out of five stars.  This product, packaged as is, is nothing more than a capitalistic venture wrapped in the cloak of greed.  I still have not purchased this movie (even at the rental store where they are selling used copies for $4.99) simply because I knew that this edition was coming out.",1271462400,,2369,4.377574370709382

3933890,3,B002HEXVUI,"I was very curious to see if there was ever going to be a movie that would beat the record that Titanic has held for over ten years. The funny thing is I had a feeling that it would be another film from James Cameron. If there is one movie that had this nation a-buzz around the end of 2009 it was the imaginative grandeur of Avatar. This film had major critics to the average movie watcher going bonkers over almost everything it offered. Still, this movie fan has a great deal to say about this one.

I have to give James Cameron some credit to his sci-fi epic. Giving us some of the greatest sci-fi action films in Aliens and Terminator, after Titanic it was only fitting for him to return to his fantasy roots. One of things that have been mentioned about Avatar was that it was an idea that Cameron had dating all the way back to 1995, that's even before Titanic was even released! You have to give a guy props when he says I have this great idea for a movie, but the technology has to catch up with the idea. Even dating back to 1999 we had seen George Lucas, The Wachoski Bros, Zack Snyder and Sam Raimi give some of the most visually stunning films of the decade. Yet, Cameron still felt his epic was not ready. Then suddenly the thought of brining movies back to the theaters in 3-D must have officially nailed it and James Cameron had started getting to work. It was a good idea to keep the public waiting for Avatar because the creatures and the landscapes were like Lord of the Rings on an acid trip. Everything was so original and so imaginative it was as if you walked into a dream. The action sequences were fluid and perfect; however there were a few flaws. While the technology of using digital characters has reached a climax, to the point where we are completely eliminating actors there is still a great deal of work to on using digital characters for slow, emotional segments in film. I feel that the animation was a little stiff and sometimes broken. I saw a much better performance from Andy Sirkis in Two Towers and I am sure a lot of people can agree. Yet I digress, Avatar came and it was graciously accepted in its entire imaginative wonderment. It was a movie that has been seen in all theaters 3-D and non and average fan has seen it in theaters at least 3 times! It went far beyond Titanic shattering every box office record and now with its DVD release it will no doubt shatter more records in the coming months. With that all said, it brings me to the real meat of this review. The only question I have had all this time after seeing it myself and seeing the overall reaction. Was Avatar really THAT good?

I have been a fan of sci-fi fantasy films for many years, since my first Disney film at age 3. Ever since I saw Star Wars at age 9 this genre of film has been my utmost favorite. So Avatar for me was a movie I was actually NOT interested in seeing when I had first heard it was being released. Over time the hype was beginning to take me. Through many trailers and reading about the back story of how this movie came into existence I was sold. Just because to have put so much effort into getting this story to the big screen, it was something I had to witness. I walked out of the theater after about 3 hours amazed, but confused. No, I did not have the same reaction I did after seeing films like Spider-Man 3 or the DaVinci Code. That reaction being 3 hours of my life was stolen and I will never get them back. Still, even after seeing it almost 5 months ago I am wondering what all the fuss was about? I have to say that the special effects were mind blowing and as said earlier `like walking into a dream.' Well, the funny part is the blend of action and drama I felt was so uneven that the slow parts threw me into major dead spots. At one point I had actually fallen asleep! Yes, I stress that point...I FELL ASLEEP! I am not trying to bash this film in any way, but I wonder if Cameron actually took the time to revise his script? Unless I missed something entirely because I know I slept for less than ten minutes, there were just so many things missing in that movie. The character development was also extremely weak. I mean there was a decent amount of story linked to Jake Sully the main hero. Still, what about all the back story of the supporting cast? I mean there were just major dead points in the movie where Sully's Avatar was walking through the Pandora forest. We all knew who the enemies were in the movie, but why were they, and what made them such evil people. The main military officer had those 3 scars on his face, how did he get them? Was it an old phantom wound or something he received through his work on Pandora? What about the Navi in general, what is their story and why is James Cameron making a sequel and not a prequel? I feel that Cameron really focused more on the special effects and not enough on plot. Also the acting was dreadful! I almost gagged a few times with how pathetic some of the dialogue was. Apparently the AFI agrees with me because that movie while being nominated for a great deal of Oscars barley received any.

  Still, what angered me the most about this movie was the message that was sent. It is one of those saw that before done that before deals. To replace American Indians or any group of people that has suffered in world history with digital blue people is a major insult in my eyes. To witness a take on true peoples plight for the purposes of just making billions to sell movie tickets is a true disgrace and always has been. Now, take a movie like Schindler's List, which I am sure many are going to bring up after reading this review. Yes, it is a story about the Holocaust, yes it was a movie that made Stephen Spielberg money, but the presentation on telling the story that in a dark time in history there was actually a good person who felt something had to be done is a true tribute and a gift. The movie while depressing was well acted and really gave us an incredible actor in Liam Neason. I feel however that there is another message in Avatar that is extremely overshadowed. It is the dangers of online gaming. In a world where technology overruns us and we are totally dependent, many of us use it as an escape from reality. In that moment we forget about the world we live in and how it runs. We lose sleep we don't eat properly and some people get so caught up in the game they don't even leave the house to socialize. Things like this cause people get so caught up in a false reality which can lead to serious mental and physical issues. Sometimes it can even lead to death. I do proudly play World of Warcraft, but one of the things I am happy to say is I can pull myself away from the game when I have to. I have a full time job a well maintained social life and maintain myself in current events. I give myself one day a week to just shut the world out so I can be alone with my thoughts and dedicate my time to my hobbies. Using online gaming in that manor can result in lowering stress levels and blood preassue and I have the medical records to prove it. In Avatar Jake would be so anxious to go back into his Avatar until the very end of the film where he actually became the Avatar! Is this to say it is ok to keep playing on YOUR Avatar because you live in a world of infinite lives and nothing can ever harm you? To that, I say shame on you. Yes, the real world is a bad place, but only you have the tools necessary to make it better and there are so many stories from celebrities to the average human being that were able to crawl from the destitute and find happiness. Probably one of the most heartwarming is the story of J.K. Rowling the author of Harry Potter. I won't go into any details, but if you Wiki her, her story will melt your heart.

In summation, I do feel that Avatar is one of the movies you should see before you die, whether you love it or hate it, the ball will be in your court. In my opinion, like many of James Cameron's other films I have seen I can only say this. I'm glad I saw it, but I will probably never see it again.",1271376000,,8083,4.208252740167634

Then a 3rd for the 3d version??? That's disgusting. I don't know if that is true but I'm reading reviews saying this is the case. I was on amazon looking for a cool huge special edition and couldn't find it so I guess this is why. I am so disappointed. And yea revolt and not buy it but this movie is awesome I can't wait!!!!!!! So i'm caving in and will buy this version and have to wait till a 3d version comes out. That's horrible. And a slap in the face to fans.,1271289600,,641,4.17741935483871

Si es un simple fan, seguramente querr tener todos los extras, bonus y special features del film, por lo que comprar la edicin ms completa y Ultimate Edition. Ahora si hablamos de un fan extremo y ansioso, seguramente no podr esperar hasta noviembre y comprar esta versin ahora y luego la otra ms adelante.
Y all est el negocio del estudio Fox, lo cual es plenamente vlido y entendible aunque algunos no estn de acuerdo, ya que no obligan a nadie a comprar, ni ahora ni ms adelante. Simplemente se hacen dos ediciones una ahora y la otra con varios meses de demora, ya que el potencial de compradores de las 2 versiones es muy grande.
Lo que uno tiene que preguntarse entonces es si compra esta edicin ahora, o controla su ansiedad para comprar la versin completa ms adelante, o bien compra esta edicin simple ahora y adems compra la edicin completa ms adelante.

I know America is suffering an economic turmoil but this is ridiculous and just another reason why there going to be milking this crap-fest of a movie till lets say at least christmas with about 3 or 4 editions of garbage you don't need. And James Cameron allowing this to happen proves his laziness as a director and his unappreciation towards his fans or what he might as well see as dollar signs. Look Cameron ...director's cut or not you have so much clout in Hollywood all you have to do is make one version/one edition and people will accept it especially coming from a world famous director and they would respect you even more for it especially if nobody has money to buy 5 editions of your crap in these harsh economic times.

Twentieth Century Fox chosen Earth Day as ""Avatar's"" U.S. and Canada home video release, because the film's theme matches the day's goal of environmental awareness.

The April release will be in 2-D and is thought to be one of the first major movies put out in home video format without any of the special features that are normally included, such as deleted scenes, trailers and behind-the-scenes footage.

The studio plans another home video release in November of the ""Ultimate Edition"" of ""Avatar,"" and that will include extra features. A third version, in 3-D, will likely come out next year, but by then, more consumers are expected to have 3-D televisions in their homes.

April 22nd 2010 disc will come without extra features.

3933910,4,B002HEXVUI,"Just about everyone who has seen ""Avatar"" has an opinion about the film. Put me firmly in the ""impressed"" camp. James Cameron has created what he intended: a trailblazing film replete with ground-breaking technology. Cameron has changed the rules regarding 3-D as a marketing vehicle, and he made a big mark when it came to sending a message about the effect humanity is having on the environment here on Earth. It is true that sometimes Cameron slips up with dialogue in Avatar, but this is nothing new for him; some of the same was visible in his previous films. Overall those movies stood up well, and so does Avatar. Others have criticized the plot, stating that is copied from ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""The Last Samurai."" It is indeed true that Avatar's plotline is similar to both films, but the setting and characters are completely different, as is the central theme of environmental destruction-and in this case the natives win a great victory over the invaders. Cameron goes far beyond the other movies in that he creates an alien world, complete with original flora and fauna. He also invents a unique lifeform in the Na'vi; while they are basically humanoid in appearance, their anatomy and physiology differ greatly from Earth-based humans.

I feel no need to go over the effects work and other technological wizardry of ""Avatar,"" as these aspects of the film have been analyzed to death by critics and moviegoers alike. I think the box office numbers provide all the evidence we need about that. ""Avatar"" has changed the ballgame when it comes to public perceptions regarding 3-D technology. Before Avatar, 3-D was basically a novelty. Now it is being shoehorned into films after they've already been filmed in 2-D (some of it rather poorly done), and 3-D televisions are the next big thing on the tech horizon. It's a likely possibility in a few years ALL movies will be in 3-D.

I have seen the film twice, once at an IMAX theater, the second at a standard venue (both times in 3-D). I told myself I would not get caught up in the film the second time, as I wanted to analyze details I'd missed the first time around. I was unable to accomplish my mission: Once again, I got wrapped up in the entertainment and ended up tossing objectivity out the window. Therein lies the message of ""Avatar:"" It is at the top of the heap when it comes to the entertainment  quotient. All the technology involved in making the movie merely serves to show the audience a good time. Remember the line Maximus (Russell Crowe) shouted at the audience in one of his matches in Gladiator? ""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?"" I was. Very much so. I will rent ""Avatar"" in this DVD version, but will wait for a future full-feature version with extras for purchase.",1270857600,4,2745,4.714583333333334
3933911,1,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is a great Movie.  Yes, it has elements from many other stories that were told before, but every movie has elements of a story that has been told before, so I don't see this as a negative.  It is absolutely fantastic.  My one star rating is not for the MOVIE, it is for this edition of the BLURAY, as I don't support the double selling tactics of manufacturers.

With that said, this is a review with regard to this BLU-RAY edition, and this blu-ray edition is BAREBONES!!!!!!  I repeat, BAREBONES!!!

No 3D (the way it was meant to be seen), no Behind the scenes specials, and no EXTENDED versions, as what will be released later this year.  If you don't want to wait, and buy this version, you will only encourage the producers to keep releasing films in BAREBONES fashion, and then later again as a Special Edition, instead of just releasing a SPECIAL EDITION with everything now.  I could live without the 3D, but I don't want to buy this movie twice.

I love Avatar, as well as The Lord of the Ring Trilogy, but I will not support BAREBONES versions of Blu-ray Discs, knowing full well that they intend to sell a better version later on.

3933913,5,B002HEXVUI,"Taking more than five years to conceive and over two years to make, AVATAR should probably and will most likely go down in history as a modern-day classic. The theme of the film will probably last throughout the ages, as it is as relevant to our culture and it has been for centuries in the past among the beginnings the Native Americans as they have had a profound connection with the land they lived and worked on. AVATAR's theme focuses on just that, the connection the natives of the planet Pandora have with the biological inner-workings of it, and this is a staple of the movies attempts at connecting with the audiences' hearts. The Native indians always held that the land was sacred and it became a way of life for them to worship it and protect it at all costs (it was considered wrong for them to kill or harm a tree).  This is just what Jake (Sam Worthington) discovers as he becomes more and more connected with the sheer beauty of the alien palnet Pandora and their gentle population, the Navi'. He also, as a DNA matched fit-in with his own Navi' body (An AVATAR), finds and falls in love with a beautiful Navi' girl who shows him the way of her people until he finally becomes one of them like they are with their planet.
  The beauty of this film is that James Cameron doesn't make these parallels stated without us discovering them as the film progresses, and we watch, in horror, as a futuristic American military posted on Pandora denies any of the beauty associated with the planet and plans its destruction for its own monetary gain.  This process of discovery is a trait not found in too many movies today as we are taken on a journey to a foreign land but are made to be involved and engaged in our hearts and minds as the true narrative of the story unfolds.
  The film is stunning in scope and cinematic wizardry, using todays best state-of-the-art technology to bring film-animation to life, and in 3-D as well.  The film deserves all the attention it has gotten and is sure to be a classic along the lines of a Ten Commandments or a past Cameron classic Aliens. Cameron is to be applauded for making Earth's military the villian without making them guitless.  They may not be shown to care about what they are doing to Pandora and see how wrong it is, but they are certainly shown to pay for it, and that guilt for which they suffer for should be enough for us.  The ending is sad yet we cheer at it, and you will see why. Sigourney Weaver as the lead bio-scientist may not be the star but her part serves as the backbone for the anger and betrayal felt by some of the American soldiers and scientists who are forced into an ultimatum at the films final hour, and what an hour it is, it is the finest series of action sequences ever filmed, sure to make you sweat and truly feel for the natives of Pandora.

3933920,3,B002HEXVUI,"What I have determined from seeing AVATAR is that the only reason for seeing it is the effects. James Cameron has always been a groundbreaker when it comes to pushing the envelope of special effects use in Hollywood. His effects company, Digital Domain, pioneered the ""morphing"" technology initially in THE ABYSS, but really put it to work with TERMINATOR 2. He is a technical filmmaker beyond compare. And, before TITANIC, which is another film that is technically amazing to watch, he was a consumate storyteller as well. But with TITANIC, suddenly we were thrust into a world of stock characters that were so cliched, they bordered on insulting, and dialogue so stilted that it seemed to be lifted from other films.

And this is the same case with AVATAR. While beatuiful to look at, the emotional attachment that is so vital in telling any story is, for lack of a better term, absent. I didn't care about any single character in this entire film enough to want to see them succeed or fail. Sam Worthington unfortunately suffers again, as he did in TERMINATOR: SALVATION, from his total lack of emotional connectivity. He seems to have no real core, but he's a character we are instantly designed to care about because he's been crippled in a... actually, how did that happen? Sigourney Weaver is a tough-love scientist and we're supposed to like her because she's tough, but she really cares about people beneath that tough exterior. Giovanni Ribisi is essentially Paul Reiser's character from ALIENS. He only sees profits. We're supposed to hate him. Okay, I get it. Stephen Lang is the gruff and morally bankrupt single-minded military man who cares only about the mission. Ok, so he's Michael Biehn from THE ABYSS. Zoe Saldana (or her Na'vi-ness) is tough, resourceful, and independent, and teaches the intruder about her culture and helps the intruder learn their language. So, she's Mary McDonnell from DANCES WITH WOLVES.

Starting to see the point here?

Even the plot is recycled... now, before you go off on me and say that every story has already been told and that I don't know what I'm saying, well, to the first part of that, you'd be right. Every great story has already been told.

But does it have to be such a direct rip-off of DANCES WITH WOLVES? A man of one world gets to have experiences with indigenous peoples of another ""world"" and through their culture, he grows beyond himself and becomes one with them... but then the people whose culture he originally belonged to want to take the land away from the indigenous peoples and he is branded a traitor, and he must fight the very people he once gave his allegiance to.

And obviously, Cameron's heart is in the right place, making statements about the problems with private military contractors and taking control of a land and forcing the people out just to get at their natural resources. And therein lies the lynchpin of this film. He's trying to make statements, and not tell a powerful story.

It just doesn't hold water anymore, James. You once made us care about a cyborg killing machine. Why can't you do that with living breathing people anymore? The best advice that I could give to Cameron is to pull a Spielberg and make a smaller film that is more personal to him and forgo the effects and all the bells and whistles and just make a small film with a compelling story.

You may be the King of the World, box-office wise, but you've lost the faith of the people like me who used to love you because you opt for spectacle and not for emotion.

And bravo to AMPAS for recognizing that a small film released in obscurity mid-summer has a more resounding effect on people than one released in time for the holidays that cost $300 million to make. And they recognized that film accordingly, because truly, THE HURT LOCKER was one of the, if not THE best film of 2009.",1270425600,3,3851,4.694814814814815

3933922,5,B002HEXVUI,"My five star review of this movie and product, just to offset the one star reviews of all the haters:

If you fell in love with this film in its original theatrical release, then this is the best product for you. If you are intrigued about an extended version of this phenomenal film then wait for that version or simply buy both.

I know I am going to double or even triple dip on this movie.

This initial release is essentially a super bit version of the first theatrical release. No other version of this film on blu-ray will ever be as lossless or have as much high-fidelity to the original source medium.

The Studio isn't forcing you to buy this version and they are certainly NOT trying to pull a fast one on you either. Fox and Cameron have both released statements of an extended version that has been created and to be released on home video at a later date (most likely early next year). The extended version of the film will be making a world wide debut this summer with a run in the theaters of at least six months. Now think about this: If a movie is going to be shown in the theaters, then why would the studio supersede this event by releasing it on home video prior to it?

On top of the new extended version there will be a 3D home video release based on the NEW 3D technology, a technology that NONE of your homes are outfitted with. This NEW technology at its cheapest quality will still cost the average consumer $3000 or more. This is NOT the old school 3D tech that incorporates red/pink and blue/green cardboard glasses. Just to give you a heads up, even the NEW glasses will cost you an average of $150 a piece. Even most brand new blu-ray players sold today won't be able to support this NEW 3D tech, and add the price of the NEW 3D HD televisions you will end up paying $4500 or more on a system to handle this NEW tech in all that it can offer.

Just google RealD or Tru3D to find out more about this NEW stereoscopic technology.

Some might claim that they already own blu-ray that are in 3D, but they are mistaken if they think this is the same tech that AVATAR will be using. Right now there isn't a single home video for sale that utilizes this NEW tech.

Sure, I want the (to date) unseen extended version, but it won't be anywhere near the visual and audio quality of this version. Just speculation here: I would think that the extended version would have to be placed on a dual-layer double sided blu-ray with only one half the film on either side. If this is not done then there surely would be a loss of information as the movie would have to be highly compressed.

If you ""avoid"" this release, I can guarantee you will be missing out on the BEST transfer this film will EVER have on blu-ray.",1270425600,13,2730,4.2957198443579765
3933923,5,B002HEXVUI,"For those of us with home theatres in place and not planning to delve into 3D in the near term, it makes a lot of sense to consider this release.  Personally, I think 3D is on the bleeding edge at present with first generation gear and expensive glasses being sold.  I would wait until the second or third generation appears, image quality reviews have been conducted, and enough content is available to justify making the investment. 3D viewing in the home is experimental, at present.  While it is dissapointing that the special features are missing, we all enjoyed the movie first and foremost and we did not have the features in the theatre!  I like the idea of having a DVD backup for use on computers, auxiliary systems, etc. I will buy the disc when it comes out this month and enjoy it for what it is.",1270339200,12,809,4.482993197278912

While I do agree that it happens quite a bit, the case is different here.  James Cameron and Fox are being very up front with the releases.  They are explaining each release and what it contains BEFORE any of them are released.  The reason for the first release not containing any extras is because Cameron wanted the film released on Earth Day.  The movie was only released in December!  It became so popular and even though he wants to release the version with the deleted scenes back in, he needs time to finish the visual effects work, the sound, sound effects editing, James Horner needs to compose additional material, etc. It takes time for this to happen if you want a high quality product.  Now, it seems to me that no one has the right to be complaining here about the release.  Complain about the film all you want, but don't bitch about the releases.  If you don't want a particular version of the film, DON'T FRICKIN' BUY IT!!  It truly amazes me how some of you are so inept to understand that.

This means waiting for the version and price I want. When ""Ronin"" came out at Best Buy it was $34.95 for months and months, and it was a bare-bones edition. I saw it the other day at BB for nine and change and bought it then.

The first Blu Ray edition of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy is soon to come out. But I won't buy it because I want the longer director's cut. So I have to wait. Big deal. It's not like there's a shortage of other movies for me to watch.

Now here comes the first iteration of the blockbuster Avatar. I won't be buying this Blu Ray release either. Because:
1. It's a bare bones edition.
2. 20th Century Fox has already announced a better ""Ultimate"" edition coming out in November.
3. Fox has announced a 3D version coming out sometime in 2011.

What? Am I supposed to buy all three versions: the movie I must have now; the movie with extras; and the 3d version? These companies get away with greed because consumers let them.

Not this consumer. They can hate me now. They can love me when I buy the edition I want at the price I want. In the meantime, I will not be bored.

We should all vote with the power of our wallets and teach these jokers a lesson.

Here's an excerpt.

If you want all the extra features, you'll have to wait until November, when you can buy a second ""Avatar"" DVD, currently titled the ""Ultimate Edition,"" which will include all of the fancy stuff. And then, if you have really deep pockets, you can come back to the video store next year and buy a third, 3-D, version of the DVD. This naked attempt to get consumers to buy the same disc twice (or thrice) has been common practice for years in the music business, where new ""specially remastered editions"" of the same old CD, sometimes weighted down with a few extra ""never before released"" tracks, have earned record companies the lasting enmity of music fans everywhere, who after being exploited over and over by record companies turned to illegal downloading with barely a twinge of guilt.",1270166400,30,2170,4.340740740740741

3933934,3,B002HEXVUI,"It is a visually amazing picture with hues and depth in action, some drama with romance and yet it struggles to appeal to the viewers artistic stance with computer graphics and three dimensional effects. What was apparent to me within the first hour of the film was the age-old repetition of the conqueror versus the indigenous. You have all the elements here.

You have the mechanically and militarized superior race of men whom disregard the indigenous culture as weak and inferior, even referring to them as ""indigenous"" and ""savages"";

You have the greedy industrialist that hire the military to ""pave the way"" for a valuable resource, not unlike oil, natural gas, coal, gold, uranium etc.;

You have the sympathetic and culturally driven scientist (anthropologist or religious missionary) that study the ""natives"" and see their plight and survival as valuable;

and you have the ""natives"" that are engulfed in the environment, nature, animals, plants and spiritual existance that naturally gets in the way of ""man's civilization"".

Take away the SCIFI and the computer graphics and you may have any number of films that deal with the basic issues of greed, militarism, anthropology and indigenous cultures, beginning with American history.

The only difference being that in reality, Geronimo does not live happily ever after and the American Indian does not run or regulate the casino, but becomes the janitor instead.",1269993600,,1424,5.223684210526316
3933935,5,B002HEXVUI,"In the genres of action and sci-fi films... this is the very best film that I have seen in my 57 years of life.  It is truly spectacular.  The detail is incredible.  The computer generated material is seamless.  The story is interesting and the action is really excellent.  Even the military stuff is remarkably well done.  The scope, imagination, and spectacle is unequalled in film to date.  I never thought that I would ever say that a film blew away LOTR 3... but Avatar did.

Look at the stats.  $2.6 BILLION dollars worth of viewers can't be wrong.  This film doubled the #3 grossing film of all time... LOTR 3.  It has almost equalled the revenue of all three Lord of the Rings films combined!!  And of course it has eclipsed the former #1 film... Titanic... both domestically and internationally and it is still in many theatres!!

I don't care if they create a dozen versions of the DVD.  This film is so special that the pain of buying the DVD is soon forgotten when one sits down and watches this amazing motion picture.  The studio is entitled to its profits.  They gave us top quality entertainment.

3933936,2,B002HEXVUI,"In 2-3 years once the 3-D home technology is perfected (and cheaper)I'll buy the Blu-Ray 3-D edition. For now I'll just rent this so my wife can finally see it.

I already feel burned as now I want to REBUY many DVD titles in Blu-Ray format (some DVDs have only been watched once) and I'm starting to wonder if I should just scrap buying movies and just renting them.

After all, with so many new movies coming out every week, how many times are we really going to watch the same movie over and over again in the next 10 years? For most of us just once or twice yet a lot of us feel we need to OWN it.

Well, at least for me my Blu-Ray price point is $10 a movie or less. If it's not there now it will be soon enough.

In a perfect world we would rent a movie for $1 and use the other $9 to help out somebody with REAL problems...but alas, we are definitely not in a perfect world!",1269993600,,881,3.9604519774011298
3933937,4,B002HEXVUI,"Amazingly visual.  Stunningly vivid scenery.  Avatar takes you to a world that washes away the memory of skyscrapers and concrete.  I am guessing that the 3D depiction will change the way we watch movies in the future.  There is already plethora of 3D follow ups scheduled and it wouldn't surprise me to see more hit the drawing board.  If you have not seen Avatar I don't only suggest you see it in 3D, I insist.  I can't imagine sitting through the 2 hours and 40 minutes without the pleasure of the lifelike background.  The movie makes you feel as if you were in the woods basking in the color of the surreal make believe land name Pandora.

Now that we have the positives out of the way we can take a gander at the movie.  James Cameron must have spent so much time on the 3D special affects that we lost a little attention on the storyline and directing.  The movie isn't bad it just wasn't epic.  The feel of the action didn't come anywhere close to the groundbreaking backdrop that was so amazingly colorful.  You basked in the new plant life and admired the animals in all of their glory and in doing so your focus left the actors allowing you to miss some of the necessary subtleties.  I guess one of the negatives of 3D is deciding where to focus the camera and in such the attention of the audience as the scene plays out.

Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a man without legs.  He happens to be the twin brother of an Avatar scientist but his brother was killed a week before he was scheduled to head out on the adventure of a lifetime.  Jake being a twin shared the same DNA and he was asked to fill in his brothers shoes.  Making an Avatar is expense.  Avatars are genetically grown replicas of the indigenous life forms from the planet.  By linking your mind to the Avatar you can control it as if you were inside of it.  For Jake Sully, a man with no legs, it gave him back his freedom.  His ability to move, to run, to jump, to live life as he had before his spine was snapped like a stick.

Jake jumped into the facade full force and in his first assignment loses his way in the woods and is rescued by the princess of a nearby tribe.  As you can imagine the two get acquainted, there is a bad guy, the bad guy tries to blow things up and the princess' dad is killed.  Jake does the unthinkable and above all odds leads the tribe in a war against the corporation.  The plot is basic and the storyline is nothing that we have not seen a hundred times before.  Again the differentiation of this movie versus anything I have ever seen before is the fantastical depiction of a world that is as vivid as your imagination.  I wonder if we will lose track of books given the movies can do a better job at fantasy than our own imagination.

The message that is underlining the entire film is our world and the natural resources that we squander so readily.  The people of this planet are unique in that they connect through their hair to animals, plants, trees, and life all around them.  Everything is one.  You don't kill if you don't need to.  You don't waste life or water or energy of any kind.  All creatures are coexisting and living together using what is needed and sharing resources.  I am guessing that Mr. Cameron is a big fan of recycling.  The movie drove home the point but then again I am a fan of recycling as well so I understood the message from the beginning.

If you are going to see just one movie this year I would suggest Avatar be the one.  While the story is basic the film itself will be discussed for the next two decades as the catalyst for redefining the theater experience.  I am curious how they will work the DVD sales and if they will ship glassed out with the movie.  I don't even know if you can watch 3D on normal TV but it is the only way that this movie should be viewed.  Interesting movie, adequate action, decent storyline and a visual experience like nothing I have ever seen before.

3933940,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is unprecedented. It has no equal. It is simply the best. Best of its kind and the best film i've ever seen, and very well deserving of all its praise.

This film is why i go to the movie theater, heck, it's why they were built! This isn't just a movie, it's truly a one of a kind experience that nobody should miss out on; and a true film experience doesn't happen often. No movie will immerse you, grab and take hold of you like Avatar. The visuals are stunning and breathtaking, no doubt near the best created to date. Spectacular.
Now for the story. Some people love to knock the storyline and i'm sick of it. There's a reason that this particular story/situation has been used time and again. Because it works, its a GOOD story, a true story as in its played out many, many times throughout history and thus people respond to it, it hits you in the heart and touches you. It's incredibly moving no matter how predictable. It's a well used plot because it's a good one, and being predictable doesn't necessarily make something bad, you add Avatars story and strong messages of acceptance/understanding and respect to the visual aspect and you've got one remarkable film.

As for the DVD's, I don't mind the double and triple drip at all. If you don't care about extras buy it now, if you want extras, wait. I know i'll be purchasing all versions and i don't mind in the least. We have been given plenty of clear warning as what to expect and when. They're not sneaking around behind our backs. It's been made perfectly clear whats coming. I've no doubt this first edition will be the best Blu-ray we've seen so far, fantastic quality. I'm also very interested in all the extra features so i will buying the November release as well. Never have i double dipped before, never before have i wanted to and not minded in the least.

If you missed out on seeing it in 3D in theaters, you should be ashamed and i suggest you get back there to see it if/when it's re-released into theaters this Fall. The way Avatar used 3D is why it was so successful. There have been plenty 3D films in the past but none to ever use it quite this way, which is why i don't think 3D as just a gimmick will last. It has to add depth and completely immerse you in the movie the way Avatar did. It has to fill you with wonder, not simply make you duck or jump. Avatar accomplished this in the most beautiful way, and it deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible. This is why i'm in no panic for the 3D Blu to come out. They're right to wait. Simply not enough people own 3D TV's/Theater setups yet. A 2011 3D Blu release sounds good, it'll also give me something to look forward to in between this and the sequel.",1269820800,6,2706,4.333333333333333

The Avatar blu-ray will be released in a bare bones edition with no special features (other than a DVD of the film) on April 22, 2010 with a special edition to be released in November of 2010, and a special 3-D blu-ray version of the movie to follow sometime next year when more 3D TVs and 3D blu-ray players are in homes. I personally do not like to have to purchase multiple copies of a movie or double or triple dip so to speak. I do understand that James Cameron and Fox would rather get his film out ASAP than to wait a year or two to see if 3D blu-ray takes off. As for the special edition with 30-40 minutes of extra footage that was not in the film, well I fell in love with this version since it's the one I saw in theatres.

According to the press release even though the blu-ray disc itself will have no extras inside the Blu-ray/DVD combo of the film will be a special code giving customers exclusive access to bonus materials and offers, including a coupon towards the purchase of the planned special edition release in November. Fox and the Earth Day Network will also plant one million trees in fifteen countries before the end of 2010, which fans will be able to adopt by registering at [...].

3933945,4,B002HEXVUI,"As a film, Avatar is the Star Wars of this generation, in more ways than one.  Its story is mostly derivative, taking some of the best elements from dozens of stories that have already been told, and covering it with a glossy coat of paint the likes of which filmgoers have never seen.  Also like Star Wars, its journey from concept to completion took so long that its creator was able to write more stories within the universe (the forthcoming sequels).  I enjoyed this movie, despite its flaws, much like I enjoyed the original Star Wars: familiar, predictable, simple, and a feast for the eyes. ""Greatest movie ever?"" Not really.  Groundbreaking and entertaining piece of cinema history?  In my book, yes.

That said, I'll definitely be getting this on Blu-ray for showing off my HDTV.

I totally agree that if you can see the 3D version, do it now before all theaters quit showing it.  I saw the 3D version 3 time and regular 2D once.  My only regret is that I didn't get to see the I MAX version.  I kept my glasses and used them each time, and hope that the 3D DVD comes out soon.  Anything less would be a slight disappointment, but once the movie starts, even 2D keep you captured during the whole experience.  Repeating previous reviewers advice, Use The Restroom Before The Movie, you won't have time once the movie starts.  Even the beginning is not slow, when the whole idea is being introduced.  Sam Worthington did a wonderful job of showing his human and Na'Vi side.  His character development, and his speech to gather clans was superb.  I would go the the theater now and watch again if there was one nearby.  Being Christian did not hinder my enjoyment.  Their Mother was created by someone.

With Avatar, however, we LOVED the show so much that it was well worth the money to see it twice in 3-D.  We had heard the plot wasn't very strong but when we saw it we didn't feel that way at all.  It was engaging, fun and touching.  If anything, we just didn't want to see the movie end - we wanted it to keep going.  My husband loves sci-fi and I don't but we both loved it equally.

3933957,5,B002HEXVUI,"I HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE OF CINEMA...James Cameron's AVATAR Review
By Carl F.

  Back in 1939, audiences were left breathless when Dorthy stepped into the Techincolor world of Oz.  70 years later, audiences are in for the same treat.
  For the past four years people have been doubting James Cameron's next film, AVATAR.  They would say it'd be horrible.  The effects would be a joke, the story stupid, and they even compared it to the biggest flop ever, the animated film DELGO.  Well, Mr. Cameron can look at all of those people and with a smile on his face simply say ""Ha ha.""

  We enter the alien world through the eyes of Jake Sulley, a former Marine confined to a wheel chair.  But despite his broken body, Jake is still a warrior at heart.  He is recruited to travel lightyears to the human outpost on Pandora, where coprparations are mining a rare mineral that is key to solving Earth's energy crisis.  Because the air of Pandora is toxic, they have created the Avatar program in which human ""drivers"" have their consciousness linked to an Avatar, a remotley controlled biolagical body that can survive in the lethat are.  These Avatars are gentically engineered hybrids of human DNA mixed with DNA from the natives of Pandora- the Na'vi.
  Reborn in his Avatar form, Jake can wlak again.  He has been given a mission to inflitrate the Na'vi, who have become a major obstacle to mining the precious ore.  But a beautiful Na'vi female, Neytiri, saves Jakes life, and changes everything.  Jake is taken into her clan and learns to become one of them, which involves many test and adventures.  As Jakes relationship with the relcutant teacher Neytiri deepens, he learns to respect the Na'vi way and finally takes his place among them.  Soon he will face the ultimate test when he leads them in an epic battle that will decide nothing less than the fate of an entire world.*

  When it comes to CGI, I usually hate it.  I prefer my effects to be done for real as much as possible.  The perfect example of that would be THE DARK KNIGHT or even Cameron's last film, TITANIC.  But  James Cameron does  such an amazing job at telling this fresh and wonderful story with the most impressive visuals I have ever seen, my old line of thinking fades away and the new one is that if they can make it look so real, I'm game.  The work that Cameron has spent doing over the past 12 years has more than paid off.  For the first time ever, it's nearly impossible to tell what is CGI from the real world.  The Na'vi's look so real you could reach out and touch them and the world of Pandora is so lush and colorful it seems almost as if Cameron just went to a real planet a shot as documentary.  The speical effects in this film are so good, that they make films like TRANSFOMERS, STAR WARS (the new ones), & DISTRICT 9 look like childs play.  Using a much better form of motion capture that director Robert Zemeckis has used so creeplily in THE POLAR EXPRESS, BEOWULF, and this years A CHRISTMAS CAROL, Cameron avoids the infamous ""dead eye"" look and makes the creatures look real, not an odd mixture of real and plastic.  To sum up the visuals, and not ramble on, what you will see on screen will surely leave you in awe. With years of hard work and trials and tribulations, James Cameron has raised the bar for CGI and motion capture to a point that I think only he can reach.  And when it comes to the 3D, Cameron score again.  Every live action film to date in 3D has been a horrible cheese fest.  From the cheesy JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH, the down right awful MY BLOODY VALENTINE, to the lackluster THE FINAL DESTINATION, live action 3D has only had one purpose: gimmick.  But with AVATAR, Cameron makes sure that doesn't happen. Not once is something forced into your face.  While stuff does feel like it'll get you at a few points, the main advatage is how the 3D brings you into the film, not bring stuff at you.  When a group of soldiers are being prepared for battle, you feel like your sitting right there with them.  When Jake and Neytirir are flying around on creatures, you can almost feel the wind through your hair.  With 3D, Cameron has finally proven how it should be used.  To submerse the audince in the film.  To surrond it aorund them.  Now I would have no issue with every film, from action to drama to horror to romance being in 3D.  Could you imagine what i'd feel like walking  down the yellow brick road with Dorthy?  Sitting next to the Godfather as he makes an offer no one can refuse? Or hanging off the bow of the Titanic as she slips into her watery grave? It would be beyond words.  And thats exactly how the technology of AVATAR is.  (By the way, Cameron is planning on a 3D re-release of TITANIC, so thats one adventure you won't wanna skip either!)
  When it somes to the rest of the film-contrary to other reviews- its just as good.  Well a few characters may not equal the greatness of other Cameron classics, their just as good.  Sam Worthington (TERMINATOR SALVATION) stands out above all as our hero Jake.  He comes off as natural and you instantly connect with his character.  Other great cast member include Zoe Saldana (STAR TREK) is perfect as Neytiri, Sigourney Weaver (ALINES) is absolute perfection as always as the hard lined Dr. Grace Augustine, Stephen Lang (PUBLIC ENEMIES) as the down right nasty Colonel, Michelle Rodreguiz (FAST & FURIOUS) as the risky pilot Trudy, and many many more.  Not once performance is wasted in the film.  There are a few cheesy lines of dialouge in it, but what film doesn't have that?  The story is great and its so refreshing to see a story not based on a book, toy, or comic.  It's so refrshing to enter a wrold you have no idea about.  And don't worry about the running time.  Nearly almost 3 hours, you fly right through the film and when the credits role with the tear jerking ""I See You"" Leona Lewis song, you'll want to stay seated and enjoy the ride again.
  Overall, James Caemron's AVATAR not only lives up to the hype, it explodes it.  No one had a clue how great it was going to be.  From the awesome effects to the relatable characters, you can't loose with this film.  Not only is AVATAR the best film I've seen this year, I dare say it's one of the best films EVER made.  And the man who proclaimed himself ""KIng of the World"" at the 1998 Oscars, well not only is he still the king of the world, but now he's officaly a true god of cinema.
I give JAMES CAMERON'S AVATAR an A+
-Carl F.

Get the BLU_RAY now. Don't wait for the Ultimate Edition.  This is a film that deserves to be seen over and over as soon as possible.

3933960,3,B002HEXVUI,"I have absolutely fallen in love with this movie in all aspects...but... I agree with most of the other 1-star reviewers. Fox is really pi$$ing us off with this multi-release crap. First of all, I also have to comment on all of the ""no 3D, no buy"" reviews. Given that the technology for actually utilizing the 3D effects in home theaters is so new and still big $$$, I don't think I can take the multitudes of self-proclaimed 3D elitists seriously. So, I take them with less than a grain of salt.
But that said, I originally placed a pre-order for this Blu-ray/DVD set but later cancelled it in favor of renting, then buying the ""special edition"" with the extras. I think it is worth the wait.  I have 2 home theaters in my home. Both HDTV, Both 5:1 audio. Only one with Blu-ray so having the combo-set would be good. But I want the extras. (But, I don't care about the 3D).",1269302400,2,874,4.361963190184049
3933961,3,B002HEXVUI,"3D is a rip-off. Why? The color depth capability of most newer HDTVs is around 24 to a high of 48-bit (Panasonic, etc.). Software (movies) currently being released are 8-bit for standard DVD and 16-bit color depth for Blu-Ray. All the studios needed to do was increase their movie release's color depth to [say] 36-bit and we would all have great 3D - and no dorky 3D glasses to wear. But the hardware (manufacturers) and software (studios) industry would not make any money doing that. They have to stick it to us once again and shove another ""format"" down our throats. Ain't greed wonderful! Now we have to purchase a new 3D capable HDTV and Blu-Ray player and all new movies, again! Not going to happen here! 3D will fail again, as it did many decades ago because it is still a gimmick - not real.

To clarify my statement above, I purchased the Blu-Ray 3D version of the new ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" with Brandon Fraser. The home 3D effect on that movie was so distracting, that I got nothing out of it the first time around in 3D, until I watched it in 2D. Also, and this may be a stretch, but the 2D movie's color seemed washed out. I think the studio intentionally reduced the color level [depth] on the 2D version of that movie so the 3D version would look better (the packaging included both 3D and 2D versions). My 60-inch Pioneer Elite Kuro plasma (36-bit color depth) doesn't lie to me about things like that.

BTW, I have never seen this film. I never go to theaters because why waste the money when you can watch it without all the chaos and hassle found in theater environments, etc. I hear it is good though, and I am looking forward to seeing it. I especially like the idea that it is not being released in 3D (at least this time). However, I would like some addition footage not shown in theaters, so I will (also) wait for the extended edition release.

If you ""fall"" for 3D, the corporations will, once again, laugh at you [fools] all the way to their banks. Boycott 3D!",1269302400,2,2002,4.405405405405405

Usually when a movie is a huge blockbuster, the studio can afford to sell the DVD/Blu-ray for less due to the fact that they don't need to recoup the production and advertising money back.  So my question is why is the price of this Blu-ray so much?!  Especially considering that before Christmas you could get District 9, Inglourious Basterds, and Harry Potter all for under $18 each, with special features, and a digital copy. It seems like the studio is being way too greedy for selling this Disc for $25.00 knowing that they are going to release at least 2 more versions of this movie in the next year.

I saw this in the theater in 3D and must tell you, I can't imagine seeing it any other way.  This movie was meant to be experienced in 3D and thank goodness home technology is making that possible.

I guess it was too easy to give the consumer the additional movie features the studio and director already have from the get go! That's called greed.

Those of you who keep complaining about there being no 3D don't seem to realize that you need a 3D TV 1st to do it the best way. 99% of homes still have 2D so why would they release a higher priced movie for the sake of 3D TVs that only 1000 people in the whole world have?  2nd, do you have $4000 for a 3D TV set after you just bought a HDTV? Doing 3D on a regular TV is NOT the same quality as in the theater. It won't look nearly as good.  I think they want to wait and do it right, when more of the sets are in people's homes.

A man is unhappy and looking for direction. Through fate, he's given an opportunity to go into the unknown. The West, Pandora. He's given a mission. Once there, he encounters the wonder of it all. The sky, the wildlife, the isolation from an uncaring world. He tries to communciate with those, who know this land. He becomes closer to a mysterious woman, who teaches him about her world. Romance blooms, as he soon begins to lose himself. His mission becomes less important.

She teaches him how to talk. They laugh and smile, and fall in love. The land around him grows and grows. He learns about her world. Her people's history, battles, and way of life. He eats their food, devours their poetry, and becomes one of them.

He consumates their union. His connection to her grows. His past reaches back. The world he served... wants control over everything. He watches, as something he loves dies. The loss effects him greatly.

Dubbed a traitor and captured, he no longer has anything in common with his former world. He escapes.

Killing many who were once his kin, he beomes a symbol for his people. Given his own name. Reunited with his beloved, he lives on. Turning his back, on his former life.

Is this Avatar or Dances with Wolves?

Both films are solidly made, but one can't help but notice. Similarity.

Both films are well over three hours. And had huge box office success. Which tells me, it works. No matter how many times it's tried.

3933972,5,B002HEXVUI,"I've read hundreds of reviews from a wide diversity of people.  And for the majority of detractors, I think they have limited imagination.  This film is great, I enjoyed it immensely!
I saw many clips and trailers, read critical reviews that chopped Avatar to pieces and sneered at its creator and people who generally enjoyed it; all before I went to cinema to see it myself.  Yet, I saw in two trailers what many harsh critics fail to even mention.  And what I saw stirred excitement to see this film, to experience it myself.  So, I went, I saw, I laughed, I felt anger, I shed tears and I felt joy.  My disbelief suspended, I was carried away by this story as much as any good book can do.  And that's unusual for a film to manage.  That one neglected thing is the emotional impact the acting has.
The visual and audio experience is stunningly beautiful. The acting IMO is superb.  The story is simple, easy to get along with, doesn't jump around with plot twists and normal story devices many film makers and authors use.  It doesn't need them.  Some will naturally pick up on and hold political issues they feel they see.  They are simply story elements, carrying a 'normal load', without intent to make political statements.  There are two stories being told here.  Really, one is Jake and Ney'Tiri's relationship.  The other is the technical wizardry involved in making this film FEEL real and natural.  The relatively simple storyline is still filled with action, adventure and emotion.  And that emotion comes across in so fluid a way you believe it.  The second real story is what you do not see that is actually what brings the performances out so very well.
A method of motion capture that allows real time LIVE playback of ALL performances, live actor and 3D CG, just as it would appear in the film.  The director and actors could all see exactly what their performances were, even while actually performing.  ""Instant Feedback"" is what we call this.  And clearly, its a help for everyone involved.
YES, I thoroughly enjoyed the film in cinema, I will go enjoy it again in cinema, and I will buy the film on DVD as soon as it's out.  And I will gladly watch it again and again and again!
I do highly recommend seeing Avatar at the cinema, even in 2D it is stunning.  And frankly I feel sad for those who seem unable to immerse themselves in this story and film.  I think they missed out on something very special.

3933973,1,B002HEXVUI,The release of this DVD and Blu Ray is BS.  They have released other movies in 3D why not this one? Most recently Final Destination and Coraline were available in 3D. Because they can make money from the ill informed. They will be able to cash in on the initial release and then the holiday crowd in November. They claim that they want to wait until more people have 3D TV sets in their home.  Can someone explain to me why we need 3D TV's? I can go and buy a 3D movie and watch it on my current TV. Why can't they just broadcast in 3D format and all we need to get are the glasses. I see it as an upgrade in the future just like HDTV. I think they will eventually do this and 3D TV sets will end up like laser disc.  But I may be wrong.,1269129600,11,737,3.8675496688741724

3933981,5,B002HEXVUI,"Despite the fairly evenly divided reaction of moviegoers (about half seemed to love the movie, the other half thought it superb on effects but weak on plot), Avatar may have the potential to become one of the most important films of our time.  Its thematic content, the importance of environmental action, is timely without being preachy or too overt. Avatar is set on a faraway planet called Pandora, which is rich in a valuable ore called unobtainium. Because the planet's atmosphere is toxic to humans, scientists have devloped avatars: genetically engineered bodies of the indigenous Na'vi, a blue-skinned, tribal and traditional people, in order to navigate Pandora and secure a diplomatic solution to their corporate desires.  It soon becomes clear that the worldview of the Na'vi -- a love of tradition, nature, and their homeland -- is incompatible with the corporate and industrial greed of the humans, and war breaks out. The genius of the story is that it places the viewer in the emotional context of its hero, Jake Sullivan, who falls in love with the alien culture, whose society and whose interaction with the world around them is more healthy, realistic, and genuine than those of his own race; and from this character-based approach, the defense of nature becomes not a philosophical position to uphold, but rather the only common sense conclusion than any sane person could come to.  The war that ensues is between two species, but it is also between two ideologies, which are currently struggling against each other within humanity's current affairs. When Miles Quaritch, a human colonel, claims that Jake has betrayed his race by siding with the Na'vi, it is clear that this is intended ironically. It is the colonel who has betrayed his race because of the philosophical choices he has made.

Despite the strong and well-presented thematic content, and the stellar imaginative execution of the Na'vi and their planet's natural world, the film does suffer from a few flaws. The most notable of these is the failure to ground the thematic claims in any objective way. Without some sort of absolute or supernatural basis, there is no room for the sort of objective claims (E.g., ""Environmental devastation and narrow, greed-feuled imperialism are wrong"") that Avatar makes. Pandora's native people do have a religious belief system in place, but as it is explained and understood to be merely an expression of the planet's biological connections, it cannot be viewed as anything that transcends nature, and thus it is stuck in the realm of relativity. Without an objective source of knowledge, this relativism makes one unable to really claim, in a logical way, that the humans are in any way less justified in their violence and narrow thinking than the Na'vi and the movie's few human heroes. For this reason, Avatar is not in any way anti-religious; if anything, it depends upon some sort of abstractly assumed religious belief.

Despite this and other related weaknesses, Avatar remains an emotional, visceral, and -- despite humanity's place as villains -- an ultimately human story that has the potential to help change the way we think about our industrialized and technology-dependent civilization. Whether we choose to act in a better way is a different question; but Avatar is at least a beginning. And a quite beautiful and compelling one, at that.",1269043200,4,3377,5.077477477477477

So, what is so bad about Avatar, apart from everything.
1) No plot and no original ideas. For marines with lots of guns - see Aliens, nauseating 'love' story - See Titanic, For the amount of blue, see the abyss.
2) no acting worth a mention
3) Worse racal stereotyping since Jar-Jar Binks!
3) Complete ignorance of the laws of Physics and Biology. This film is supposed to be Science Fiction - the clue is in the word ""Science"" as follows
Pandora is a moon of a gas giant with a thriving ecosystem - Wrong - The tidal forces alone would prevent this, let alone radiation and EM waves.
The Pnndorans are Blue - Wrong - Pandora is a Carbon based ecosystem (compatible with human DNA). Blue is virually unseen in Carbon lifeforms above the size of a small fish.
Pandorans have 'humanoid' - wrong - since in an ecosystem, the various higher level creatures (Mammals, Fish, Birds Reptiles) all follow the same limb pattern - On Pandora, all the big creatures seen (even the dragons) are six limbed - So should the pandorans.

3933983,1,B002HEXVUI,"Don't assume this film has a normal and 3D version like every other 3D film out there. Why no 3D? Because this is a joke. The punchline assumes that people who own Blu-ray players have money to burn and will dive on any plastic case with a blue strip at the top. Oh no no no we won't! It has me seeing red!

UPDATE: After one person called me dumb (apparently the news media has taught us that civil behavior just isn't as cool as attempting to elevating ourselves and our opinions by calling other people names) and another said he had no idea where I was coming from, I decided to update this review with part of my answer to each.

This movie didn't wow the children in my life because it had a great story they'd never heard before and super production values. They begged to see this and Alice in Wonderland because they were in 3D. Unless they make a version of this that you can view on a normal set with glasses, I won't buy it and recommend that parents ask their children if a great picture will make up for not having 3D before they purchase it.

I saw from the previews that there is a whole wave of these films coming out, including a remake of Tron. While I'm sure that will make for good box office attendance, it will not make my niece want a take home version without the bells and whistles, nor goad me into buying technology that will be upgraded to something else in 6 months (that is my definition of dumb). Sorry but I won't buy a ""version"" of what I want because they are using the ""real thing"" as a come-on for new technology. They've lost my 3D DVD dollar completely.

That is why I have no reason to buy this or any other version of a 3D movie not in an affordable version of 3D that can be viewed by the children in my life on my year old 50"" flat screen. If I had bought it, I would be listening to disappointed children all day. Now that would be really dumb!",1269043200,6,1888,4.164383561643835

3933986,5,B002HEXVUI,"Being that I'm a fan of science fiction and war dramas I have to admit that this was already my kind of movie before I ever even saw it. My love for campy, over the top or gritty realism films of all kinds aside, I found myself extremely skeptical of this one going in.  There was a lot of hype about Avatar before it's release and having been nothing short of violated by George Lucas' pointless and ill-conceived return to the Skywalker Legacy, I was strongly leaning towards the world of Pandora as being another special effects laden dud meant to distract my eyes away from rigid actors and invisible plots.  In short though, to me, James Cameron has always had vision and patience, the core elements that truly make for a unique and lasting movie going experience.  The only other modern day director I give credit to in this area is Peter Jackson for his masterpiece Lord of the Rings trilogy.

I was not let down.  Not in any way whatsoever by Avatar.  For the first time, I was watching a film enhanced with seamless CGI that actually helped build on the plot and character development, rather than try to cover a horrid line like ""I wish I could just wish away my feelings"" with floating fruit and beeping robots that could have saved themselves all sorts of trouble if they had used those spiffy built in jets later on in life. (Think R2-D2's first arrival on Dagobah).  I was immediately astounded by the world of Pandora and it genuinely feels like you're landing there with Jake for the first time and taking it all in.

Cameron's rendition of the military, or if I was following the story right, a powerful mercenary team with access to military equipment is awesome.  The scorpion airships look sharp and tough and actually lend to the eye, the imagery and behavior of a real scorpion.  Nicely done but there's waaaay more to Pandora than just what the humans have brought.

 This world is a snapshot of Cameron's imagination.  Everything around you is unique but still maintains a feel of familiarity.  Which is exactly what's happening to Jake, the film's hero.  He is embedded into a returning peace envoy of scientists as part of a covert ops mission to find the Navi's weakness because they happen to be sitting on the biggest deposit of unobtanium within 200 clicks and the natives refuse to move.  Jake manages to be accepted into the clan because of a sign from one of the symbiotic lifeforms on Pandora and it is from here that most of the character development takes place.  I fell in love with Neytiri too and thus became intrinsically linked to Jake's dilemma.  He finds that he was meant to come to Pandora for an altogether different reason.  One nobody, not even the viewer of this film could possibly imagine.  Although the basic premise of this story has been done before, it is still used here efficiently and the acting is strong enough to remind us that there is a reason why we're seeing every single thing we're seeing.

It does not matter if you're not a sci fi fan or you don't care for the hyped up special effects laden garbage they've been hailing as blockbusters for the last few years (and they wonder why the theater business is in the toilet).  Avatar is THE film that has set the new standard and single handedly did its own part in upholding a sluggish global economy with a current worldwide gross approaching 3 Billion dollars, dethroning Titanic as the top grossing film of all time.  It's the kind of film we've always wanted to see done with CGI and the idea of using real world jungle settings in the principal photography and THEN overlaying the CGI, now that's just plain brilliant.  Cameron has taken Peter Jackson's technique for body acting CGI on Gollum's character and run with it to create the Navi and probably some other indigenous lifeforms as well but, I couldn't tell and you will not be able to tell where reality ends and the CGI begins when you see this film.  It's flawless and breathtaking.  The Hallelujah Mountains are of particular note and they are aptly named because if I saw something like that for real, I would say the exact same thing.

Please see this film, hopefully in IMAX 3D if you're lucky.  The 3D used doesn't hurt your head and make you nauseous like every 3D movie before it.  I believe Cameron developed new 3D cameras for this film?  I could be wrong about that but, Avatar should definitely be seen on the big screen in some format in order to truly appreciate it's scope.  You will not be disappointed.

Thank you James Cameron for giving us tired, financially strapped movie lovers something worth believing in again!",1269043200,6,4614,4.6095471236230114
3933987,5,B002HEXVUI,"A one star rating for this movie is rediculous. Some people just enjoy special features, (how the movie is made, pop ups while you're watching etc..).

Having the movie playing while you're in the menu is totally wrong. Is it ""cool"" to have that tecnnology and apply it just because you can do so much with a disc now? ABSOLUTELY NOT!!! It's the most annoying thing to have to yell ""don't look!"" ""don't look!"" to friends, while you're trying to navigate the menu.

3933988,3,B002HEXVUI,"There is no question that James Cameron is a genius. He had a vision that many doubted and he proved everyone wrong. Good for him. However, while visually stunning, the actual plot of Avatar is ridiculously predictable and not that deep. Who could not predict what would happen at the end? Who could not predict who would live and who would die? It was all too easy. For years greater films than this have tried to topple Titanic's reign, and failed miserably. So for a film such as this, with a pretty shallow plotline, and cliche is hell at times, to accomplish the impossible, is just plain astounding. I do not begrudge Cameron's success. He is an extremely talented director-but Avatar happens to be his worst film to date. He spent YEARS working on this film and goodness knows how long to create a script, and the best they could come with is-UNOBTANIUM??? Seriously?

I know it seems like I am bashing this film left and right but that really isn't so. I happened to like Avatar- it is perfectly watchable, if only for the visual effects and the acting, which is flawless all around. I just don't think that this film is anything super special or fabulous. And watching it in 3D actually didn't help matters. I almost felt the effect seemed underutalized and unecessary at times.

Avatar is a great film visually, but lacks depth and heart, so hopefully Cameron can see to this issue when he makes the sequel(however many years THAT will take).",1269043200,2,1452,4.64591439688716

Overall this film was a huge dissapointment for me as I had looked forward to it for a long time.  I will not be purchasing this or any other edition of Avatar.  Alice in Wonderland was a far better film, I'll save my funds for that one.",1269043200,8,570,4.594059405940594
3933991,1,B002HEXVUI,"""Avatar"" takes place in the future on Pandora, a moon of a gas giant named Polyphemus, that is located over 4 light years from Earth. Pandora is being explored for certain resources that Earth needs since Earth's economy is bad.

Pandora is a lush, tropical planet filled with unique wildlife and is inhabited by a race of primitive humanoid beings called the Na'vi.

One Na'vi tribe occupies an area that is plentiful in Unobtainium that a private corporation wants to extract since the mineral would be of some use on Earth since it is extremely valuable.

The corporation has also provided its own protection force made up of former members of the U.S. military. The Unobtanium is located under the Na'vi's Hometree and corporation forces will conduct a Blackwater-style raid against the Na'vi if the natives refuse to allow the company to extract the mineral.

A Marine named Jake Sully travels to Pandora to take his dead brother Tony's place in which Jake assumes control of his brother's avatar in order to make contact with the Na'vi.

Jake Sully is paralyzed from the waist down as the result of an injury he sustained while participating in a combat mission on Earth. He is the only person who can successfully use his twin brother's avatar since Jake's genetic material is the same as Tony's.

After assuming the use of the avatar Jake begins the task of winning the Na'vi's trust in hopes of convincing them to allow the Unobtainium to be mined. Sully does this so he can get an expensive operation done to recieve a new set of legs that is promised to him by the Pandora Earth colony's Marine commander.

In ""Dances with Wolves"" fashion, upon interacting with the local Na'vi tribe Jake Sully begins to appreciate their way of life and goes so far as to befriend a Na'vi woman who is also the tribal chief's daughter.

Later Jake becomes torn between his duty as a Marine and the existence of the Na'vi that he has learned to know and love.

Where the movie goes bad isn't so much Jake's conflict as much as it is the movie's underlying plot.

In ""Avatar"" the primitive, simplistic lifestyle of the Na'vi and their quasi-Gaia worship of Pandora's ecology is held to be a moral virtue while the company representative and most of the military members are portrayed in the film in a one-dimensional, negative light which demonstrates where Cameron's loyalties lie.

We see also see Cameron's political sympathies in one other film he made which was the highest grossing film of all time: ""Titanic"".

""Titanic"" not only generated lots of ticket sales, it is the apple of almost every Marxist's cinematic eye.

The overall message in ""Titanic"", simply put, is egalitarianism. No one is better than anyone else, we are all equal, wealth is bad, being poor is good and, while you are at it, don't think for yourself.

Now Cameron has weighed in (yet again) with another morally repulsive movie that, like ""Titanic"", portrays self sacrifice as one's highest moral end.

This time it is a nod to the evil philosophy of environmentalism that calls for the destruction of human life by indirectly calling for people to sacrifice their lives and livelihoods to the needs of nature.

This message is embodied not only by Jake Sully's actions during most of the movie but also the Earth scientist's hypothesis that the ecosystem of Pandora is interconnected and should not be touched while at the same time ridiculing the idea of economic development in the form of utilizing a planet's resources.

While one could appreciate ""Avatar"" from an artistic perspective, it is obvious that the artistic elements of the film are secondary to Avatar's awful theme of nature worship.

The movie itself is said to be one of the most expensive ever made. At a price tag of up to $300 to $400 million viewers of ""Avatar"" will be treated to a special effects bonanza while James Cameron symbolically spits in their faces.

Despite the film's huge box office returns, it is my hope that people will not buy the DVD versions of ""Avatar"" and reject James Cameron's platform to propagandize for his subtle anti-human plot.",1269043200,13,4105,4.797163120567376
3933992,4,B002HEXVUI,"I really enjoyed the movie in the theater, and was blown away by the beautiful art and 3-D effects.  As a visual artist, I found the art end of the movie to be incredibly rich, and went back to see it (and likely will yet again) just to LOOK at the world!  I could look at this for a very, very long time.  I am also a biologist/ecologist, so I appreciated the sources that they drew on to create this world - especially the incorporation of coral reef elements into the forest environment.  Nice concept!  (LOVE those tube worms!)

That said, I found the plot and characterizations disappointing. The plot was very ""Dances With Wolves""; there was nothing really original about the story arc. As an ecologist, I liked the fact that the film pointed out the mistakes that we have made and are still making here on the only habitable planet that we know.  But I think this could have been done with a bit more of an original spin to the story.

Additionally, the characters (with the exception of Jake Sully) were very one-dimensional, and would have benefited from a bit more depth. Long as the movie was, I would have liked to see it split into two parts so more attention might have been paid to story arc and character development.  The film is beautiful and definitely worth seeing, but it is unlikely to become a classic that really holds up over time.

As to the Blu-Ray/DVD: Isn't there a way to convert the 3D done in the theaters to a standard HDTV?  I want those effects, but am unwilling to go right out and buy a new, very expensive 3D TV to get them, especially at the price they are now offered at.  THAT technology needs some time to mature and become more accessible to those of us who are not independently wealthy.

3933997,4,B002HEXVUI,"I saw this movie, and it was a very good sci-fi epic, but in my mind it's still not even HIS best. I actually still like ""Terminator"" and ""Aliens"" better, basically because the stories were more original with better dialogue, acting, and in the case of Aliens a great and memorable musical score. ""Avatar"" had none of those things. The story isn't original(basically ""Dances With Wolves"" in the future on another planet), the acting was fairly mundane, and the musical score was in fact forgettable. Unfortunately James Horner hasn't recaptured his old magic here lately.

The best parts of ""Avatar"" definitely are on the technical achievement side. Cameron has set the stage for other movies beind made that up until now weren't possible without you thinking ""what terrible CGI!"" I'm still not a huge fan of cgi and probably never will be, but at least in this movie I was able to suspend disbelief more than in other cgi-fests. Cameron also filmed one heck of a battle scene at the end which rivals any ever shot for a sci-fi/action movie.

In the long run you should buy this movie if you're a sci-fi fan.

If your not going to pick this up which you must, don't review and move on. My copy is pre-ordered! wooo",1268956800,4,556,3.8859649122807016
3933999,5,B002HEXVUI,"It is the correct aspect ratio and this Blu Ray is worth the money. The original framing for 3D is 1 : 1.78, which works better for 3D. It has more vertical room for 3D effects. A perfect example of this comes early when we see the curved display of the flight controller as the camera moves past it. In 1 : 1.78, we see the whole screen protruding,
top to bottom. Cropped to Panavision, it protrudes but the top of the display is gone. Apply this to every shot that has a foreground object beyond the screen plane, and you see how much more realistic it becomes. The widescreen version is a compromise of the original, for theaters that have only the Panavision screen to work with. Size was chosen over accuracy.

As for this edition, with no 'extras', it is being done as a ""Superbit"". By eliminating extras more bitspace is available, and the more space the movie takes on the disc the higher the quality of the picture and sound can be. Even at 50 Gigs, a Blu Ray can't come close to the smallest file size of Avatar which is at minimum 250 Gigs for 4k projection. This will be one of the best Blu Rays yet, for picture and sound quality.",1268956800,8,1143,4.291666666666667
3934000,1,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is the single most over rated film of the 21st century, and possibly ever.

This sci-fi action movie would have been as well attended as as the mostly unheard of sci-fi film ""Serenity"" (a far superior film) if not for the 150 million dollar Avatar ad campaign that turned a silly movie about blue super model aliens into the top social currency of the decade.  If you didn't see Avatar, you couldn't participate in all the conversations at school, work, the gym, on late night talk shows, or the news, or celebrity interviews, or newspapers, blogs, twitter, etc.  This movie's hyper inflated social value has nothing to do with the quality of the film, rather everything to do with the cultural spectacle of a half-billion dollar movie.

Anything enjoyable about this movie is purely from the brilliant use of movie making tricks and audience manipulations, generally used to enhance a good story and good characters, not generally used to replace them.  From the big sympathetic eyes of the aliens (the same eyes that Disney has been using to great effect for the last 90 years) to the almost-glimpses of the hot blue chick's breasts, to the blatant milking (no relation to the previous statement) of the current and ever so popular, environmental movement, Avatar proves that you can replace quality storytelling with cheap movie making tricks and money spending spectacles in order to earn millions.

The characters are pure stereotypes and clichs, straight out of Saturday morning cartoons.  The story is so predictable you'll swear you've seen it before (and probably have.)  The plot is excruciatingly formulaic. (I think they used Hollywood Action Plot number 0016-B.)  And it's all purely a slave to the special effects: everything that happens, happens because it will result in a gratuitous CG sequence.

If you aren't sold on this thing so far, allow me to set it up for you:

There is a native alien race, of eleven foot tall blue supermodel cat people with great abs, that live close to the nature (in their case on the planet Pandora). They love all nature, have the ability to mentally interface with all the animals and in fact the planet itself.  The native alien race don't have any unlikeable native/tribal tendencies, like war, jealousy, pooping, hunting and killing animals, polygamy or any form of sexism, etc.  They are the perfect race, living in perfect harmony with their perfect planet and all of nature.  Aliens = good guys.  Got it.

And then...  an evil corporation, lead by a selfish and single minded company-man (played by Giovanni Ribisi) who wants to strip mine the lovely planet of all the precious ore, aptly named ""unobtanium"", to make a profit, without care for any harm to nature or the natives.  Are you getting dumber yet?  Your brain is being strip mined for a profit.  Corporation = bad guys.  Brilliant.

The corporation is backed up by a military, who want's to destroy everything, regardless of consequences or strategy or logic...  They are represented by a war mongering battle scarred military-slogan slinging emotionless hard-ass, armed with hate for that which he doesn't understand and unlimited military ""pep talk"" speeches: ""Out there, beyond that fence, every living thing that crawls, flies or squats in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for jujubes.""  Military = bad.  We get it.

So the supermodel Smurfs with great abs, go to war with the evil corporation and the evil military when their sacred magic tree-fort of life is threatened.  Because it sits right on top of the unobtanium motherload.  (This whole thing is a mother-load.)  Caught in the middle of it all is Jake, the nice paraplegic soldier-hero guy that wants to do the right thing.  At first he wants to be loyal and help his military unit by infiltrating the alien tribe, by injecting his consciousness into the body of a genetic copy of one of the sexy aliens, or an ""Avatar.""  After infiltrating and living with the aliens in his Avatar, Jake decides that they have it ""so right"", living with nature, respecting the planet, flying around on dragons, not to mention his new alien girlfriend is super hot.  So Jake has a change of heart and perspective and decides to help the aliens fight the bad guys.  Thank goodness the white guy showed up to save the natives!

(I wonder if the main human character would still have fallen in love with the alien princess and opted to help the alien natives if they had been short fat frog people with acne and patchy body hair, and a propensity for chronic laziness and eating bunnies.  Would audiences have been so willing to worship the film?  Way to challenge the status quo James.)

The love story is astoundingly trite and hopelessly silly: the hottest, strongest, smartest alien chick, who's also the princess of the tribe, was apparently holding out for an incompetent guy that she has to keep from dying 15 times a day.  Apparently that's what hot alien princesses are looking for in a guy.

To sum up the story/plot: the main character arrives, dopey dialogue, bad guys are established, more dopey dialogue, main character meets sexy aliens, blue side-boob, dragon flying sequence, dopey dialogue, more flying, melodramatic moment with blue side-boob and more dopey dialogue, big battle sequence, one liner, more battle sequence with more dragon flying, battle, battle, battle, dopey dialogue with weak moral lesson, set up for sequel, end credits.

One question for James Cameron, et all.  If you have half a billion dollars to make a movie completely from CG, you can do anything you want that no one has ever done or seen before, you can blow the minds of everyone with unprecedented visuals and ideas, you can build an entire world from scratch so you can tell any story conceivable, limited only by your imagination and the imagination of hundreds of artists, writers, and technical people, and you give us ""Dances With Smurfs""...?

You could create any kind of unimaginable alien species and creature, things we would never be able to see unless it was created in CG for a movie, but we get blue cartoon cat people, and the same jungle monsters and flying dinosaurs that are from every summer CG movie from the past ten years.

You can show us anything you want, employing hundreds of CG artists to show us something visually extraordinary, a whole new perspective, and you chose to show us war and violence?  And not even realistic combat that might show people the terrible reality of war and violence; you gave us glorified video game violence with flying dragons.  ""Look how cool I can make this look!""

Many argue that Avatar had ""amazing visuals"" that had never been done before.  I was ""dazzled"" by the same CG video game cut-scene stylings in the 2001 film ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.""  Original visuals?  The ideas and visuals that make up the world of Pandora are cool, just like they were when artist Roger Dean did them back in the 60's.  I wonder if Dean has a good copyright lawyer.  And those Dinotopia books from the early 90's were cool too.  And what's all this talk about some movie called Delgo?  (Google this stuff folks.)  If you want the same story, but done well, I recommend Dances With Wolves, Never Cry Wolf, The New World, etc.  And if you want cool animated visuals look into any Pixar film.  Skip Avatar, unless you need to fit in with the ""seen it"" crowd.

What's your 500 million dollar idea?  Avatar was simply an exercise in gratuitousness from top to bottom, beginning to end.  The whole thing was horribly unoriginal and unnecessary.  Pandora was pretty looking, but there are actual places on our real planet that are even more beautiful.  The CG characters were kind of lifelike, but you could have real actors, that are actually alive.  Would audiences respond better to seeing actual people with real emotions rather than artificial representations of them with pre-recorded voices?  What was the point of all the artificially created elements if you're giving us something that can be accomplished as good or better without all the expensive CG?

Would you rather have 25 twenty-million-dollar movies you could go see, or one Avatar?  I guess you could go see Avatar 25 times...

3934002,4,B002HEXVUI,"First I'll say that I enjoyed this movie and I think that the movie won the academy awards that it deserved. The computer graphics were quite spectacular.

Otherwise, the movie first struck me as a cowboys and indians story. The white men are moving into the country and slaughtering the buffalo, polluting the country, making deals and breaking them, etc., all in the interests of making a buck. Later after some thought the movie seemed to be a commentary on American capitalism. Yes greed has done some serious damage in our history and as recently as the sub-prime debacle.

Truth hurts doesn't it. An interesting dichotomy of capitalism making us great but also being our achilles heel and likely what will destroy the US long before any terrorists. Rome didn't last and neither will we if we don't find our souls and a reason for living besides a quest for money and power.",1268956800,,879,4.738562091503268
3934003,4,B002HEXVUI,"I watched this movie in theaters after much reluctance. As a rule I generally avoid books/movies/TV until the excitement dies down so I have a more objective view.

Yes, the movie is very visually beautiful. It has absolutely lovely environments and the acting of most of the characters, particularly Zoe Saldana's (Neytiri), are done rather skillfully. The music also contributed to the scenes without being obtrusive. It is in these regards that I enjoyed the movie very much and would recommend it to friends and family.

However, the reason I did not give it a five star review is because of the other elements of a great movie that were missing or underrepresented. This is primarily the script and plot, both of which I felt could have been much stronger, opportunity missed.

The dialogue is very prescribed and unnatural/unrealistic in sections and this takes me out of the movie, rolling my eyes or groaning. And when I say ""unrealistic"" I don't mean something along the lines of ""scientifically impossible"" because yes it is a fantasy movie, I get that and Sci-Fi is one of my favorite genera, but the character's development and personality can so gracefully and interestingly be demonstrated in what words they choose to say and the mannerisms they have. The development of the characters in this movie were very amateur and predictable. Mr. Cameron may have broke new ground in the visual and technology departments but apparently felt the need to stay away from doing anything interesting and new with his characters. Other than design, of course.

The plot has been done many times. As one of my friends mentioned it is a very expensive movie child of Fergully and Dances with Wolves. Again, nothing new or fantastic about man against nature, using military arm to bully natives, someone ""coming to their sense"" and trading sides, and ultimately the movie displaying why the native way is the way to go.

Also, one integral part of the movie, and maybe someone here could share their opinion with me, what was the ultimate purpose of the people in the movie spending copious amounts of money to create the Avatars in the first place? I only saw the movie once and could have missed it, but the way I understand what was said in the movie is it was easier for the native peoples to speak and accept the visiting race. If this is the only reason, it is acceptable? Seriously? As a Native American I can't help but feel slightly offended at that notion. When settlers came to America did they dress up in Tribal garb in order to be more accepted/less threatening? When people came to Africa to make contact or collect slaves (as the case/situation deemed) did they try to blend? No, because who in their right mind would think that someone doing that was on the level. Illogical really...but if perhaps there is more to it than that then please tell me so I can settle my thoughts. Maybe in the long run it would've been more cost-effective than buying and bringing all that oxygen. But regardless it is something that could have been explained easily in one or two lines and then be done with.

This early release version contains NO EXTRAS OF ANY KIND (i.e. no additional scenes, no running commentary, no trailers, no anything!). There will be an AVATAR SPECIAL EDITION released on Blu-Ray in time for Christmas this year and a 3D SPECIAL EDITION released sometime next year.

I urge fans of this movie NOT to purchase this crippled early release and if you cannot wait to see Avatar in your home theater then you can just as easily RENT this version from Netflix and then purchase either the special edition or 3D edition once they are released.

As movie fans, we must band together to send a message to the Studios that we will not accept their blatant multi-dip marketing tactics and will only purchase these movies when they include all of the special features that current technology allows!",1268956800,98,998,4.691428571428571

The 2D version was cropped to give it the black bars on theater screens. The bluray is in the ratio as filmed and will look like the IMAX scenes from ""The Dark Knight"" and "" Transformers 2"". It will fill the whole screen but will still be wide and will not cut any of the movie off. Be happy that you actually get to see more of the amazing Pandora like being at the 3D cinema. Also the Original audio was recorded in 5.1 HD and not 7.1 so it is as shot too. The only thing to complain about is the lack of special features and additional footage. Cameron is re-releasing this film this fall in 3D for a second run and it is supposed to be the extended cut so after that happens a bluray with the extended cut will most likely be released soon after before Christmas 2010. it will probably be more expensive but the Ratio and sound will not change so get used to that. People think that this ratio is like a full screen DVD but it is not. it is wide screen it just does not have the black bars cropped into the picture. The cameras he used to film the movie were the same Ratio as IMAX cameras just not the same size film.  The movie going to be just a awesome as in the theaters.  And 7.1 sound is a gimmick anyway.

3934007,5,B002HEXVUI,"I have not seen any DVD version of this film but have seen the theater version in 3-D three different times (once on IMAX screen, which did not add that much to the movie).  At the end of the movie the first time I viewed it, the audience actually clapped their hands (something that I had not witnessed in any movie for several years).  But, the images from Avatar were that extraordinary.  It is eye candy for senses and well worth the money spent.  As I said, I saw it three times with three different people and was anxious to see it every time.  In fact, if anyone asked me today if I wanted to go again I would gladly attend.  I have not seen this movie in 2-D so I do not know how it will translate into a DVD.

The plot (good guys against bad guys - in this case the bad guys are human) has been done so many times before.  A lot of the characteristics of the good guys seemed to be replicated from American Indians and the human military personnel versus the scientific personnel was somewhat of a cliche.  One factor of the movie that should be well received with today's economic problems is the depiction of the big corporation's willingness to sacrifice whatever in order to realize profit. What makes this movie great is the magnificent scenes - floating mountains, the flying episodes, the vivid colors.  This may sound like more of a travelogue but there is enough story (including a love story and incredible battle scenes)to make this a very entertaining film.

I am not sure that I would be satisfied with a 2-D DVD version of the movie but I would be afraid of a 3-D version based on current DVD technology - I am not inclined to purchase a 3-D TV due to current cost, limited programing and the potential problems associated with a new product.

3934008,5,B002HEXVUI,"This DVD is being released in a short window after the theatrical run of the movie, not to cheat the consumer, but to do a couple other things.
1.  Piracy is a big issue with this movie.  Movie piracy, especially in russia (where most pirate copies come from), is huge.  For years Region 5 (R5 is Russia, like R1 is North America), has been targeted by movie distribution companies to release DVDs early so that they can capture sales alongside pirate copies openly sold in shops.  It is a much different picture than the U.S., where stores are owned corporately and only buy directly from distributers.  By releasing this DVD early here (also should not it took 12 weeks to master this on DVD, as opposed to the 6 weeks typical of a movie), thhey cut the piracy window down.
2.  This picture was a huge success.  #1 in countless categories.  People want to get their hands on the movie.  IF there was not a demand for this movie to be out, they wouldn's have released it in a short time.  Some of us refer to this as capitalism and supply & demand.
Yes, this is a ""bare bones"" copy of the film.  Don't expect any bonus features.  The special edition will release in november.  If you want to be able to enjoy this movie, for the price of 4 Venti Mocha Frappucinos you can own a copy of the film in April.  If you view the coffee as a better purchase than a bare bones edition of this movie, buy your coffee and wait til november.  Don't, however, chastise and mock the consumers that want to watch it April 11th in their home, as that is their right.
Oh, lastly, this movie is a retelling of the Native American story...think about it... it is not ""propaganda"" to make americans look bad...  If it bothers you to see a very similar portrayl, minus the space aspect, of what early americans did to the natives of this country, don't watch Avatar.  However, those that do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it, and we are coddled enough as a society.  If the only way we can be educated that destroying ""savages"" in the name or ""progress"" is through a sci-fi movie, then so be it.",1268956800,16,2089,4.354005167958657
3934009,5,B002HEXVUI,"I, too, am angry that once again the desire for profits leaves the consumer uninformed,ignored and basically cheated!

My AVATAR journey:  first saw it in IMAX 3D at Universal City Walk in So. Cal.  Yes, it was overwhelming, brilliantly composed, basic characters and script far overshadowed by the brilliance of the technical genius.  A bit overpowering, however, in IMAX and not as comfortable as I had hoped.

Second time was a screening at Fox Studios in West L.A.  Actually the presentation was much better in the normal wide screen 3D.  And seeing it at its home studio didn't hurt at all.

Third through now......a screener sent to the AMPAS voters, watched at a friend's on a 50"" screen, surround sound fully enhanced....for some reason it WAS almost in 3D, no glasses needed.  For me, I have found that there are certain glasses that have been used for some music videos and travelogues which dim the input to the right eye and when the camera pans or moves, the sense of depth and 3D of the characters is created.  I have a pair that were given away years ago when the Rose Parade was presented in this kind of 3D, not the colorized double image that cuts out real color and is very blurry and ghosty (JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH with Brendon Frasier, for example).  I have watched many BIG films wearing these glasses and the 3D is more ""depth"" than ""in your face"" but certainly a big change.

I may not have the money to buy a 3D wide screen in the near future, but I am DEFINITELY waiting for the later release of the film, with the expected additions and discussions and making of docs, etc.

3934010,3,B002HEXVUI,"I saw the IMAX version and while I thought the 3D and CGI were great; unfortunately the story was basically a plain vanilla cowboys and Indians story that you can see in any western circa 1930+.

The Na'vi, a bow and arrow stone age culture living in harmony with nature (insert the peace loving native Americans/Indians) are beset upon by the evil mining company the RDA corporation who want a rare mineral found on the land occupied by the Na'vi (insert evil 1800's railroad company here).

The Mining company has hired soldiers; Marines, (insert the evil US Calvary) to move the Na'vi off their land to a new settlement (insert Indian Reservation here minus the casino of course).

I mean c'mon! All that was missing was John Wayne on a horse!

The almighty James Cameron was miffed that his ""epic"" didn't take every single Oscar at the awards. Maybe that's because his ""epic"" story was merely a 1930's B movie western storyline rehashed and repackaged in a a sci-fi setting with pretty graphics! As far as the scientists role goes, that element is always present in a vanilla western by a group of ""palefaces"" who feel sorry for the Indians and try to help them by opening schools and teaching them English and showing them as a civilized people....wait a minute...that's EXACTLY what the ""scientists"" do in the movie! Not even an attempt to hide the western theme there.

The lead role in avatar is a disabled marine disgruntled with the service because they will not pay to heal his disability so he signs on with the Calvary...erm, I mean the mining company security force who will pay to fix him up if he signs on with them.

He uses the avatar created for his twin to get close to the natives to spy on them for the evil ""Colonel"". Instead he ends up falling in love with the native's, their culture and a native woman and he ends up being accepted by the ""tribe"" (insert Kevin Costner and a few dancing wolves here) and siding with them and turning against the evil marines and their psychotic colonel.

Despite all this, I did enjoy the movie (I like westerns) and I was never caught looking at my watch or yawning during the nearly 3 hour movie. The CGI was simply amazing although the 3d gave my wife and I both a mind searing migraine that lasted 2 days.

I feel it was quite pretentious of Cameron to expect to get best picture by just cutting and pasting a generic western story into a sci-fi movie. The movie did deserve all the awards it did get and should have gotten every award for graphics design and the technicians that made it happen.

I was highly offended by Cameron making the Marines out to be rabid blood thirsty animals and totally unrepentant. At the end of the film Cameron makes the evil mining Corporation seem to repent a little by having the CEO stop, look up at the Na'vi with a seemingly new found respect then hang his head down in shame as he's led away yet the marines are seen glaring at the Na'vi with blind hatred.

I was visibly upset by a fellow moviegoer as he repeatedly yelled ""yes!"" ""yes!"" every time a soldier was killed. Blissfully unaware that he was being manipulated.

Seems clear that Cameron loves big money grubbing corporations and hates the military.

We have enough nut jobs in this world who hate the US and our brave men and women in uniform fighting and dying every day for an ungrateful elite and a generally lazy,cowardly civilian population/world and I don't appreciate seeing them smeared by Hollywood yet again.

The slap in the face to the military could have easily been avoided by changing the marines to a private security company (mercs).

I just don't understand why Cameron hates his country so much as to ruin what could have been a good and original story with his anti military sentiments/theme. Sadly Hollywood throws originality in the trash in favor of pretty graphics and big explosions.

There was no need to use ""marines"" as the bad guys. I mean technically they were a private security company because they worked for the mining company but the movie constantly refers to them as ""marines"" and they wore military uniforms not security uniforms.

I do intend to buy this movie, just not the initial release. Cameron stated himself he would wait 6 months after the first DVD release to release an enhanced possibly 3D version. I'll wait for that. Some may yell hypocrite for buying a film that I felt disrespected the military but if I refused to buy a movie on that premise then I'd be prohibited from buying 99.9% of all movies made since the 1960's. So I will concentrate on the pretty pictures and grit my teeth and try to ignore the propaganda.

I gave Avatar 5 stars and subtracted 2. One for the cheap cowboys vs indians storyline and the second for the anti military theme.

FYI For the record I am not in the military. Never was. I am disabled and unable to serve. I am simply the Very proud son of a WW2 combat veteran who is sick of seeing his Fathers and every other serviceman and woman's sacrifice and courage belittled every day by Hollywood elites.",1268956800,6,5049,4.578713968957872

Everything else is a waste of money. The studio is obviously still trying to make even more money off the film so they'll release as many DVD versions as possible to milk it for all it's worth.

Because at a press release, it was revealed the dvd or blue ray won't have special features, no trailers...nothing but a menu and the movie. According to the producers this is because the movie is so big there possibly couldn't be any room.

Ok that is the lamest excuse ever. Made a 2nd disc...hell a third disc. I want to see how this movie was made.

The only saving grace would be its in 3d. This movie made billions of dollars in the theaters thanks to 3d...no neither Blue Ray or dvd will have this. If the dvd had special features or 3d I would 100% buy it, but now I don't know.

So...I bought it. I don't know the special edition will be only for Blueray and if its also on dvd probably will cost a lot, so I figure Ill rent the other edition or something.

Hey, $16 still isn't bad for a movie of this caliber. So what if its missing the good stuff like behind the scenes, commentary, 3d, deleted scenes and the other fun stuff.

3934020,3,B002HEXVUI,"Back when `Avatar' was released in the theaters I wrote a little review for it entitled `10 Things I Thought About While Watching Avatar (including 7 reasons why, if this film had been released in the summer, it would stand no chance at a Best Picture nomination)' and so I've decided to share that with you.  The review I wrote wasn't elaborate, just basically ten thoughts I had that evening spouted off for the enjoyment of some friends on a film forum.  I'm going to elaborate a little bit on those thoughts for you here at Amazon.

So, let's get started.

10) I hate family togetherness.  I'm not talking about the cute ""aw that's her mother but that's her best friend"" kind of togetherness either.  While standing in line for nearly 30 minutes just to get in the theater I had the grave discomfort I standing in front of the family from hades.  The first thing I notice is this very awkward looking, bucktoothed crazy girl in the most hideous sweater dress I've ever seen standing directly in front of me staring at a poster for `The Karate Kid' that was hanging above my head and I hear ""Dad, oh my god, dad...they are making another karate kid"" and then he's like ""yeah it's staring that Smith kid, you know, Will's son"" and all of a sudden a bell goes off and she's like ""I LOVE HIM, he's so cute!""  I should have known right then and there, but I didn't.  The mom then asks me if this is the line to get into Avatar and I should have told them it was for the bathroom (even though I was like the THIRD person in line directly in front of the door) but I told her the truth and they settled in right next to me.  For the next twenty minutes or so I had to listen to them discuss everything from Smith's cuteness to the difference between Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford to the fact that, as their son put it, ""the new Wolf Man looks like it's having so much fun knowing that it's a remake of a crappy 30's movie but like, it's totally going to be intense.""  Then the son gets a phone call and he's all ""oh my god, oh my god, dad here's the phone...`so and so' just died"" and his dad gets all quiet and after he gets off the phone the son was like ""who's `so and so'""...and then the father tells him that he's this guy who was dieing of cancer and they all went to church and prayed for him and the cancer went away (apparently not) but now it appears that the cancer came back and it was too strong for god to cure.

It gets worse...

 We get into the theater and THEY FOLLOW ME and wind up sitting RIGHT NEXT TO ME (at least the son does) and during `The 20' I have to deal with their gross togetherness as they talk about how James Cameron is a god and how Katy Perry looks like a trashy Zooey Deschanel (actually, I'm the one that said that, to my wife, but the moment those words left my lips the daughter was like ""heck yeah"" and gave me this big bucktoothy smile...)

I'm shocked she didn't try and give me a high five.

9) Sam Worthington is going to be a star, and I, for one, am thrilled about that.  He has the look, the talent and the charisma to be HUGE and I really hope that the world takes notice and he gets some juicy roles coming his way.  I see that he is in the remake of `Clash of the Titans' and for that sole reason I am totally anticipating that film.  I just see a big future for him.  I only hope that he doesn't get typecast as the whole `cute guy in he-man action movies'.  I want him to experiment with his range and challenge himself and wind up Oscar nominated.  Really, I want that for him, and it's not like he was anything AMAZING in this movie, but I just really, really want him to be a big star.

8) Sex in movies is always hot, even when it involves repulsive blue cat people.

7) Speaking of repulsive blue cat people, is it just me or does James Cameron have the imagination of a prepubescent boy?  I say this with a tinge of love and affection, but just a tinge.  I mean, this film and everything that went into it seemed so, childish to me.  The color pallets were so, cheery and `alien 101' to me.  There seemed to be no real uniqueness to it.  The evil monsters looked like generic evil monsters and the blue cat people just, to me, seemed `been-there-done-that'...let's move on.

6) I may be speaking out of line, but the graphics here really weren't that amazing.  I mean, am I the only one slightly offended that this film is nothing more than a cartoon?  Peter Jackson's `King Kong' looked better than this.  Sure, the 3D and Imax helps, I'm sure (I didn't see it at the Imax) but I kept wondering why exactly this took 20 years to make.

5) Speaking of 20 years, couldn't Cameron have penned a decent script?  This storyline is ridiculously unoriginal.  More than that, it's forgettable!  This movie is very much `Tarzan' meets `Star Wars' meets `Pirates of the Caribbean' meets `Jurassic Park', in 3D...with Kevin Costner's Oscar juice squirted all over it.

4) Steven Lang gives the worst performance I've ever seen any actor give in any category this entire year, maybe even this decade...seriously; it was THAT gross.

3) Those braided genital things gave me the creeps; big time!

2) People really get into this stuff, I mean...the girl sitting on the opposite end of my wife was balling her eyes out through like the entire second half of this movie!

1) Mother nature kicks serious booty (predictably so)

All that said, I'm glad I saw this movie in the theater and I'd probably watch it again.  It is entertaining, really entertaining actually; but it is incredibly stupid and amateurish and no where near as amazing as the hype wanted you to believe it was.  In my opinion, this film was no where NEAR the best of the year, and it's not like this year was a great one for film (although a few films released this year could make a claim at `best of the decade', like `The White Ribbon' or `Where the Wild Things Are').

This film is childish, trashy, tacky fun; nothing more, nothing less.",1268870400,5,5955,4.296594982078853
3934021,5,B002HEXVUI,"Yes, they're going to milk this thing as long as they can.  Over two and a half BILLION isn't enough evidently.  But what gets me is this.  The argument for a bare bones disc is to give the film as much space as possible for the best video and audio on the disc.  Ok... so what happens when the ""Ultimate"" version comes out in the fall with the added footage that they are rumored to include.  Speculation on the net is that there could anywhere from ten to forty additional minutes of footage added to the movie.  So, do we then get a movie of less quality to squeeze more footage in or is this claim for the bare bones release just a lot of hot air?
I like the movie a lot and have already preordered this title.  Just very suspicious of the claims being made for the bare bones release and the ""Ultimate"" version later this year.  Maybe Cameron's press release on the 23rd will shed some light on this and perhaps some sequel news.",1268870400,10,934,4.237288135593221

Avatar itself is a wondrous movie, and it will be awesome in 2D at home on a good tv, this a really great feel-good movie and it immerses you into a fantastic new world.

Also whats great is that this dvd will not only have the best picture and sound possible, but that its in the 1:78 format which means it will fill your WHOLE tv screen instead of the horrible 2:35 format that leaves big letterbox black lines above and beneath the picture, i wish more dvd's would come out in the 1:78 format.

So buy this version unless you HAVE to have extras, its the way to go for me.

3934024,5,B002HEXVUI,"SKIP THE 2Disc THEATRICAL EDITION -- BUY THE SPECIAL EDITION OR 3D VERSION INSTEAD

1. A special edition including 20 minutes of additional footage was released just months after Theatrical Edition. (But fans weren't told until it was too late)
2. No special features in 2 disc Theatrical Edition.  If you are a fan, of all the discs in your collection this is the one you really want the extra stuff.
3. 3D version also now available, though not in the extended version yet.  This movie is considered a reference disc in 3D and the extensive CGI use makes it a great story to be seen in that medium, as are most animated movies.  Hopefully a 3D Extended Version will be released soon.

Regarding the multiple releases while holding back on the whole package: The studios are becoming so brazen.  Offering bare bones Blu Rays shortly before re-releasing the movie with additional footage was a classless act that kicks dirt in the face of fans.  I completely understand the business side of the equation.  However, I think we would all like to see them release multiple versions and let fans decide how much they need verses how much to spend.  At least release a complete package a year or so on.  There still isn't an extended 3D version US general release at the time of my update Dec 2014.  The first 3D release was just the theatrical edition, even though the extended footage was already available.  It's like pulling teeth to get these studios to release everything fans want in a single package, even down the road.  After all the releases we have had, they really owe it to fans to do something for us, rather than themselves.  We all understand the business side and multiple releases are no surprise.  But seriously, this is somewhat an old movie now!  Avatar is a particularly egregious example of this practice.

If 3D doesn't interest you regardless, then you are set with the Avatar Special Edition.  That is the one I recommend until the 3D Extended Edition comes out.  I originally wrote this article as a one star protest review, but there are so many versions of the movie out now and reviews to all of the versions are linked on Amazon to each release so it's better just to explain what to look for.  Other worthy reviews cover both the general plot and the content differences between the standard and extended content.  I will leave those aspects to them rather than duplicate it.",1268870400,"3,672",2403,4.660332541567696

3934026,3,B002HEXVUI,Avatar was one of the main reasons I went to the movies this summer.  I'm very disappointed that fan's like myself have to pay $25.00 for the blu ray DVD combo pack.  Bare in mind this is the bare bones of the movie.  What's included is the theatrical release in which Cameron and company is spending six weeks on to make it a very pleasant viewer experience for blu ray.  There going to probably have a DTS True HD surround sound for it as well as 1080 P AVC transfer.  I'm happy there spending so much time perfecting the movie but I'm very disappointed there cheating the fans out of special features and that 10 minutes of extra footage Cameron promised us.  For die hard fan's that want to own the movie right away and don't mind paying a premium for it then go ahead.  But for fans like me that want to see the special features and what went into making this movie wait save your money.  Remember that ten minutes of extra footage I was talking about he's going to re release it this summer to get us the fans to pay more money for 3d again about 15bucks a pop.  Fox and Cameron are greedy!  So if you don't mind waiting till next December that's when the 3D version will be released.,1268870400,2,1190,4.248888888888889
3934027,5,B002HEXVUI,"I loved this movie when I saw it in 3-D at the theatre.  When it was over, and I looked at my watch, I was surprised to see that 3 hours had passed.  The theatre experience for a film like this can never be as good at home, no matter how good your system is.

Some reviewers are complaining because they want an ""uncut"" or ""director's cut"" extended version of this film on blu-ray.  I personally feel that the 3-hour theatrical cut is sufficient.  I did not feel like I was missing anything.  Do you really want to spend 3 1/2 or 4 hours watching this movie so you can see it with footage that the director decided to remove?

As for the blu-ray not being in 3-D, this is not really a problem.  I have several of the recent 3-D releases.  The experience is currently quite different at home from what you see in the theatre.  You have to wear glasses with red and blue lenses.  Not only do they give you a headache, but they ruin the colors of the film.  The picture comes out dark and looking almost black and white.  Also, the 3-D effects are nothing to what you experience in the theatre.  Wait a few years until they have perfected the home 3-D TV.  The 3-D blu-rays will be processed in a different way to be viewed on a different type of monitor, with a different type of glasses.

I have an old dvd that features famous roller coasters.  It was shot in 3-D, but does not use red and blue glasses.  The glasses are polarized.  The colors of the film are not damaged, the picture is bright, sharp and clear, the 3-D effects are superior, and the same picture can be viewed without the glasses in 2-D with no loss of quality.  Why are they not using this superior process for the feature films currently being released on home video?

Don't complain about the version being currently released.  Just wait two or three years, buy a perfected 3-D TV, a new 3-D blu-ray player and a blu-ray disc that is specifically processed for the 3-D TV.  You will still be disappointed because it will not be the same as the theatre experience.",1268870400,2,2034,4.322751322751323
3934028,5,B002HEXVUI,Avatar on Blu-Ray is a day one purchase for any fan of the film.  Yes this version is only the bare bones but later an all out special edition will be released.  If you want this BRD you won't be disappointed!  If you are just complaining because of its bare bones - shut up and move along as you are not reviewing the BRD just commenting on your disatisfaction of this release.  James Cameron will do his best to make this BRD a great release!,1268870400,3,444,4.188235294117647
3934029,3,B002HEXVUI,"I am reviewing the product and not the movie. Like everyone else should be. Everyone should be aware that this is this a bare bones bluray that has no special features whatsoever. Its classic Hollywood milking their big movies for everything it has, but from what news I have read they are putting more time into compression(6 weeks as opposed to the usual 2), getting rid of any menu, etc, so that audio and video quality is the very best. I admire Cameron and Landau for this, but its still lazy thanks to FOX. A proper bluray with extras and special features will be coming out in a November release and the 3D version as of this date is most likely coming out 2011. I was really hoping to get my hands on my favorite movie and the most revolutionary movie to date, but then I heard FOX was being lazy with their first release.

3934033,3,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar
Not quite new.
While the movie Avatar has originality it is nothing new.  The movie did not live up to the expected hype.  The CGI is nothing new.  Motion capture has been used in Lord of the Rings and The Polar Express, not to mention many others like Appleseed.  Granted, a new camera was designed to captured facial expressions.

Sustains

Avatar was visually stunning.  The environments were beautiful to look at and vehicles and creatures fit seamlessly into world that James Cameron created.
There were elements of character development that are needed in any film, the whole good vs. evil complex.
It is a fun movie with elements of adventure.
Lack of a sex scene.  While there was an intimate moment, the audience did not get the actual act that so many movies go with.  By itself this deserves two thumbs up because movies with a sex scene tend to ruin the movie.  Implying is perfectly acceptable, since it is a naturally occurring event, but the audience does not need to see the actual act in progress.

Improves

While visually captivated, the movie relied too heavily upon it.  Hope that visual elements would drive the scenes.  It relied too heavily on the scale of the environment to build epic scenes.

The movie did not possess the drama and suspense necessary for vital scenes.  At the beginning the audience gets a sense of the tensions between the humans and Na'vi when a mining truck goes by with large arrows sticking out of the side.  The scene is about five seconds long and does not build up the hostilities both sides have for each other.  Instead of telling the audience that this planet is extremely hostile (Grace tells Jake at one point), show it!

Plot line.  The plot proceeded too quickly; it felt like it was rushed.  The movie hits the ground running and does not stop to let the audience breath.  Maybe it should have spanned two movies.  While the movie is two hours and forty minutes it could have been better if it followed Lord of the Rings and lasted for three hours.  The movie tended to act as a roller coaster, moving really quick and wanting more when it was over.  In this case not more because it was awe-inspiring, but more content to expand and explore the story.

There is a lack of character development.  The main character Jake does not even think twice before joining the Na'vi (the indigenous population on the moon Pandora).  He feels no remorse when he scouted out Hometree (a giant tree that the Na'vi live inside) and gave the intelligence necessary to bring it down.  Nor does he have any remorse for becoming a traitor to his own species.  He feels more remorse for the fact that his girlfriend is disappointed in him than the fact he helped the destruction of their home.  Another scene later on in the movie is when Jake meets Neytiri (the main female character) for the first time.  She tells him he has a good heart, but she only has known him for about three minutes after she saved him from Viperwolves.  Hardly any dialogue is expressed at this point, so the characters do not know each other that well.  Colonel Quaritch is seen to be this evil war mongering soldier.  The only title he deserves is soldier.  All he was doing was his job, the corporate executives failed in their negotiations and all that was left was the military option.  Colonel Quaritch was one of the better characters who actually stayed loyal to his job and his race.

It is okay to base characters off real civilizations.  However, James Cameron goes too far with similarities.  The Na'vi hit the audience over the head with a bat that they are like Native Americans, mimicking their actions and vocalizations almost seamlessly.  It was like watching Last of the Mohicans in space.

Soundtracks are supposed to be created for one movie.  While James Horner is a fantastic composer you hear too many of other movies in this soundtrack.  During the track to Climbing Up ""Iknimaya"" - The Path To Heaven"" you can hear smidgeons of the soundtrack Glory track Preparations for Battle.  Glory was composed by James Horner.  During the track The Destruction Of Hometree there is the distinctive ambiance to the movie Enemy at the Gates composed by James Horner.  The audience should not be thinking of other movies when they are watching it.

If Unobtainium was the only resource that could preserve the Earth, then the humans would have utilized more destructive tactics.

Content rating.  The movie seemed to try to connect with too many viewer ages.  It was not afraid to show someone getting smashed by a block of explosives, yet there was no blood when a character gets shot several times.

 Final Rating and Closing Elements
This movie deserves 3 to 4 stars (say 3.5 stars for averaging) and is worth seeing at least once.  It is not one of James Cameron's best and is maybe a bridge for better movies to come; after all he has been out of the loop since Titanic, a twelve year span.  The movie had and has great potential, so everyone will hopefully see when the next one comes out since the actors are singed on for two more movies.",1268784000,,5084,4.639013452914798

I like gory movies,action, suspense which I knew this wasn't in the first place my type of flick. So they begged me enough that I went and really all I can say to sum it all up is im glad I did and this movie is amazing. I will never second guess a movie again I can't believe the special effects that Avatar has. Transformers 2 was amazing this just ate it all up for breakfast and lunch an still wanted more there photo realistic an what will be used for years too come. I didn't think this movie would have any action and man I was wrong it has about everything you could want. Take Transformers 2, The Matrix, Dances With Wolves, Jurassic Park, Last Of The Mohicans and King Kong put them on steroids an you now have Avatar.

I know a lot of people were wondering what James Cameron was up to after ""Titanic.""  Considering that most of his films have been huge successes both from a box office standpoint as well as from a critical standpoint, I was wondering what he was doing.  Aside from the television show, ""Dark Angel,"" and a few other small projects, I was also curious about when he was going to get back to making a movie.  It took James Cameron over 11 years to make ""Avatar.""  And thank God it took him as long as it did.

Avatar may well be the most visually stunning film ever made up to this point in time.  If you aren't completely enthralled by the colors and visual effects of the planet, Pandora, then perhaps you had your 3-D glasses on backwards!

James Cameron has pretty much had the same theme running throughout the course of nearly every one of his films: nature vs. technology.  His films beg the viewer to ask the question, ""Technology is a wonderful thing, but if man, himself as evolved so little, what good is it?""

Gene Roddenberry had similar themes running throughout the course of Star Trek.  What happens when technology out-distances man's wisdom?  What happens when technology causes man to forget what is really important in life?  Better yet, what happens when man believes the technological advancement is the stick that measures evolutionary advancement?

For many years, man has believed that he can conquer nature.  The Native Americans, as well as other tribal people, found a way to live WITH nature.  For many years, including today, many people believe that we are more advanced than people were several thousand years ago.  Scientists are already proving that this is not the case.

We learn in Avatar that we have pretty much used up the resources of planet Earth.  Earth is briefly described as a barren wasteland.  On the planet, Pandora, the military under the authority of an undisclosed company (James Cameron invariably uses a ""company"" which pretty much represents exploitation in his films) is attempting to acquire a rare mineral worth millions of dollars.  The problem is the indigenous people, the Na'vi, are unwilling to part with it, or give their land away so that the company can get it.

Enter Jake Sully who is a bitter marine who has lost the use of his legs.  Eager to prove that he can still function as a marine, as well as avenge his brother's death, he enters the Avatar program.  The program provides Na'vi bodies to be used by their respective ""pilots.""  The mind is downloaded into the Na'vi bodies.  Jake's avatar is given a specific mission: to infiltrate a tribe of the Na'vi, learn about them, and find a way to exploit them.  At first Jake is eager to undertake the mission, and joyful to find that he now inhabits a body that can walk and run in ways that even his fully functional body can't begin to achieve.

Here, the story takes on similar themes as films like ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""The Last Samurai.""  Jake quickly finds himself becoming more enamored with the Na'vi and their culture.  The Na'vi, although a bit suspicious of him, ask Neytiri to teach Jake their ways.  She shows him how everything on the planet is interconnected; the plants, the animals, everything.  The Na'vi have long braids which gives them the ability to ""plug in"" to animals or plants for the purpose of communication.  But it is more than simple communication.  It's a bond.  And this is where the idea of interconnection is truly demonstrated.

Eventually Jake falls in love with Neytiri, but also with the way of life of the Na'vi.  It can be argued that Jake has never truly lived until now, even when his body was whole and functioning.  He finds a wonderment in everything that the Na'vi do, and he realizes that he must now do everything in his power to protect it.

The characters of this film are pretty much all first-rate.  Sam Worthington does a terrific job as Jake Sully.  He is able to subtley show the changes in Jake, and how his mind and being shift from an unquestioning military thinking to one whose eyes have opened.

Zoe Saldana is simply brilliant as Neytiri.  She is able to tap into the love and devotion that Neytiri possesses for her people, the animals, the plants, and all life on Pandora.  She is a warrior, with a a warrior's spirit, but she has a softness that Jake is able to tap into.  One can't help but feel her pain when she feels betrayed.

Supporting characters such as Sigourney Weaver's, Dr. Grace Augustine, give excellent performances.  Dr. Augustine knows the Na'vi people, and she's at first upset that Jake (a jarhead) is now in the Avatar program.

The only performance of the film that I felt was over-the-top, was that of Colonel Miles Quaritch, played by Stephen Lang.  We understand that this is a military commander who doesn't give a damn about the Na'vi and is only interested in wiping them out.  We understand that he's bitter and angry regarding the wounds he received from them.  But sometimes, subtley is much more effective than outward bravado.  Quaritch comes off as stereotypical of so many similar characters that we've seen in the past.  The dialogue written for him could have been vastly improved.  One can't help but think, ""I've heard this before.""  Perhaps a quiet rage would have been a more effective way to go.  We understand he is a ""gung ho"" commander.  Subtle demonstrations would have made him more effective and less laughable.

I can't say enough about the visual effects.  I understand that Cameron didn't feel that his film was ready to be made until he saw Golem in Lord of the Rings.  He knew he was undertaking something tremendous, and he succeeds beyond measure.  He envisions a planet that easily rivals the Star Wars planets created by George Lucas.  To my mind, he surpasses Lucas.  He not only is able to create a planet with incredible landscapes, floating mountains, and bright Fluorescent colors, but he gives everything amazing detail.  I venture you could watch this film five or six times, and catch something you didn't see before.  There is that much for a person to take in.  James Cameron also spent some time in Hawaii attempting to learn the behavior patterns of the plants and animals; to give him an idea of how they would act, react, and interact within the environment.

Avatar pretty much has it all.  It is a far deeper movie than one might expect.  I feel that we can learn a lot about ourselves through watching this film.  Avatar speaks to the simplicity of life.  Jake finds that he cannot deny that for a people who ""seem"" far more primitive, they are happy.  Masters have stated, ""life is, in fact, very simple.  It is WE who make it complex.""

Avatar is a film that you can't forget.  It seems to resonate within the fabric of our very souls.  It invites us to question how we live, and how we interact with everything and everyone around us.  And we wonder why our planet is in such dire straits.  We wonder how we got to where we are, and why we pay little or no attention to what we are doing to everything around us.  We can learn from those of the past.  We have forgotten that we must work with nature, not against her.  We have forgotten that everything and everyone is connected.  What we do to one, affects another.

Henry David Thoreau stated, ""Where there is one, there is a majority of one.  And when the rights of the majority take away the rights of the one, then the many will themselves suffer.""",1268697600,2,7486,4.638233054074639

...as emotionally flat as a pancake.

After seeing the trailers and featurettes I took the trouble to see Avatar in a theater, to see the effects to best advantage. I'm glad I did. I agree with most of the hype about this movie's ground-breaking technology, effects and visual beauty.

I even sincerely recommend that everyone see it at least once, and see it for what it is: a remarkable achievement.

But a GOOD movie is not only images and sound-bytes, special effects and artwork: it is an orchestration of many components to produce an exciting and satisfying whole. It must appeal to our emotions, move us, touch our heartstrings. Avatar does NOT. At least, not mine. The only scene that came close was Sigourney Weaver's departure.

The best I can do is demonstrate by comparison:  though they all relied heavily on CGI and special effects, ""Star Wars,"" ""Eragon"" and ""Stardust"" are all moving, exiting and satisfying films - not to mention ""Snow White"", ""Fantasia"" and ""Mulan"" - which is why I own most of them.

Though I will probably see Avatar at least once more, I doubt I'll ever buy it.",1268697600,4,1107,4.734375
3934038,5,B002HEXVUI,I have a large number of movies and consider myself as well versed on all styles of movies. Avatar is the BEST movie I have ever seen. I went to see it at the theater 3 times and that is something I have never done before. I just couldn't get enough of it. The story is wonderful and the graphics are amazing!

3934039,4,B002HEXVUI,"When a movie boasts the incredible feat of becoming the highest grossing picture of all time, ground-breaking visual effects, extremely favorable critical reception, and has a director that undoubtedly still believes himself to be ""King of the world!"", a person does wonder, ""Is it really possible for a single movie to be that awesome?"" That's the question that continued to nag at me until I finally got around to watching director James Cameron's (""Titanic"") sci-fi/fantasy epic, ""Avatar"".

""Avatar"" follows a paraplegic Marine, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), as he undertakes a mission for the government to assist in gaining possession of an extremely valuable mineral nicknamed ""Unobtanium"". Standing in the government's way is the indigenous populace of the planet Pandora, a cat-like alien race known as the Na'vi. To complete his mission, Jake must become one of the natives, gain their trust, and convince them to leave the only place they've ever called home. The problem is that the more Jake learns about the Na'vi, courtesy of his guide Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), the more he begins to lose sight of his objective; thus, putting not only his mission in jeopardy, but the very lives of the Na'vi.

Let's start by discussing the most pressing matter regarding this movie, in my mind... the visual effects work. Well, as much as I didn't want to admit it, James Cameron has managed to create one of the most realistic CGI worlds and people (the Na'vi) ever to be seen on the silver screen. Those that know me, heard me say many times that I doubted he would be able to make the eyes look right, as this has always been a trouble spot for CGI born characters. Not to mention, nine foot tall, blue, cat-like aliens interacting with live actors would be difficult to accomplish realistically.

Despite my misgivings, the folks at WETA Digital (visual effects house) along with the incredibly complicated motion-capture techniques that Cameron employed, have blown the lid off of what computer generated imagery has been able to accomplish thus far. From the smallest details (facial ticks, pores on the skin) to physical movements (walking, talking, fighting), and yes even the eyes, almost everything about these characters looks authentic.

As for the lush world of Pandora that the Na'vi inhabits, it is a world of beauty and wonder, and looks absolutely stunning. However, the creation of Pandora isn't nearly as big of an accomplishment as the characters. Realistic worlds have been created in several other movies prior to this one, perhaps not to this magnitude though. The bottom line is this movie represents a significant leap forward in the realm of CGI and officially sets a new standard for visual effects in movies.

Now, there was at least one flaw in the CGI that I spotted, and I would be remiss not to touch on that for a moment. Another issue that plagues visual effects, aside from life-like eyes, is creating realistic fire. For the most part, the fire and explosions looked fantastic, and one could be hard-pressed to find an actual flame or fireball that looked any more real. However, there was a moment where the character of Jake takes a stick to make a torch, and in that scene the fire on the torch looks horrible by comparison. Nothing about it looks even remotely true to life, and I was surprised that James Cameron would allow this less-than-stellar result in his otherwise visually stunning movie.

The story for ""Avatar"" is a fairly simple one. It's your basic undercover story, where the person sent to essentially spy on someone eventually either falls for their quarry or joins their cause, foregoing all other allegiances. The plot points play out in a fairly predictable manner, especially in the final 45 minutes when the battle over Pandora really begins to heat up. Even with the predictability of the story, I didn't really find that it detracted too much from the experience. Although, there were a few moments where the story became so telegraphed that you knew exactly when a certain aspect of this tried-and-true storyline would occur; in those moments, the predictability would become a little bit distracting.

While discussing the story, I did have some issues that chipped away at what many believe to be a nearly invincible movie. To be honest, I would have absolutely been enthralled by this movie and potentially heralded it as one of the greatest ever created if Cameron could have left his politics out of the entire affair.

For instance, a major dose of ""Go Green"" was threaded into the story, to the point that Cameron almost suggests that nature will fight back to defend itself if necessary (a theme borrowed from M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening""). Then, there's the anti-military/war in Iraq and Afghanistan agenda that is woven into the obvious comparison of the Na'vi to the Native Americans. We get it, Hollywood doesn't support the war on terror and for the most part, it appears they don't support our troops either. What I don't get, is why these writers and directors think that audiences can't get enough of these political agendas in the media, so we need it to infiltrate our entertainment as well.

Also, the story does slow down in the middle portion when Jake is learning more about Pandora and the Na'vi. I understand that for the story to work Jake must integrate fully into their society and how they connect with the planet, but I don't believe this area of the movie needed to drag on as long as it did. After a while, I got the point that he's learning more and more, so the story could feel free to move along; however, James Cameron just hammers this segment into the audience to an almost exhausting degree. After spending so many years working on the story for this movie, as he waited for technology to catch up to his ideas, one would think that James Cameron could have perfected the script to the point that a lull never occurs. Oh well, it was just a thought.

If the aforementioned part of the story had been shortened to some extent, plus had most of the environmentalist and anti-war propaganda been removed from the movie, the running time could have been trimmed by approximately 30 minutes and been much better for it. But, from Cameron's perspective, the man has a captive audience so the temptation to force his agendas down their collective throat is too good to pass up.

As for the cast of this movie, every one of them was extremely capable and showed more depth of character than one would typically expect from a science-fiction movie. Of course, to comment on the performances of the CGI characters is to presume that most of the performance was due to the motion capture of the various actors portraying the roles, and not the skill of some computer wizard in an office somewhere. At least, that's the approach I am taking with this aspect of the film.

In his first predominantly starring role, Sam Worthington (""Terminator: Salvation"") shows more range than I thought him capable of delivering. That's not to say that he will be winning any Academy Awards for his acting prowess anytime soon, if ever. He does manage to squeeze out a few emotional outbursts that don't appear forced or uncomfortable for him. The reason this surprised me was because I wasn't sure if the man could react emotionally. Have you ever seen an interview with this guy? Anyways, even though he is allotted several opportunities to loosen up his typically stoic demeanor; for the most part, Sam appears most comfortable when working in an action sequence that requires little to no emotional output on his part. Let's face it, the guy knows his limitations, and is wise enough to take roles that strictly showcase his strong points.

As the other main character in the film, and also the member of the cast most worthy of mention, is actress Zoe Saldana (""Star Trek"") as Neytiri. Her performance was one of the film's main keys to success, because aside from Jake, she is the only other character with which the audience really gets a chance to relate. Zoe imbues such heart and warmth into Neytiri that you forget you're watching a CGI creation rather than a real person. If an actress can bring a nine-foot tall, blue-skinned, cat-like alien to life in such a believable way, then she's done an excellent job in my book.

In the major supporting roles are Stephen Lang (""Tombstone"") and Sigourney Weaver (""Aliens""). Stephen Lang obviously relishes every moment he appears in the film as the scheming Colonel Miles Quaritch. One minute you believe him to be the epitome of the great wartime military leader, but then he'll show his true malevolent colors as he seeks to destroy every living thing in his way. Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Grace Augustine exudes a no-nonsense, tough as nails attitude that belies her gentler, more caring side that she conveys only amidst the Na'vi. It's a shame that such a talented actress became so typecast by her role as Ellen Ripley in the ""Alien"" franchise, because she always manages to deliver top-notch performances and is an actress worthy of more and more quality roles.

Even though this film has become the highest grossing movie of all time, and boasts some of the most impressive visual effects one has ever seen; in the end, the movie is held back from the greatness it could have achieved. While ""Avatar"" is still a very solid, entertaining movie, James Cameron's desire to stand on too many soap boxes over the film's overly long duration causes the movie to fall short of its potential.

""Avatar"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality/brief nudity.",1268438400,2,9603,4.849908480780964
3934040,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar. The story - predictable, camp, simple. Earth, its military-industrial complex, wants to get its hands on the minerals of beautiful planet Pandora. On Pandora lives a peaceful race of extraterrestrials, in harmony with their environment and in peace with themselves. With colonial arrogance and hypocrisy humans want to get the riches of the planet, seeing the natives as ignorant and underdeveloped.
Before raping the planet a scientific study on the natives is undertaken nevertheless. For the researchers to really be able to mingle with the natives artificial natives, Avatars, are created and remotely controlled by humans. One of these humans is a soldier who had lost his legs before. Now, when controlling the Avatar, he finds new freedom of spirit and body.
He 'goes native', falling in love with a beautiful girl. He manages to rouse the natives to fight against the invaders and finally beats them.
So far so good. Kitschy, ecologically and politically correct, naturally with a big battle, huge explosions and superhuman deeds in the end, as it seems to be 'de rigeur' for almost any new movie nowadays.
The saving grace of the movie is certainly the masterful use of 3D and computer animation. The reality of the world of Pandora is overwhelming, each computer generated animal is believable, each and every plant is more than just a prop, there seems to be an inherent logic in this Pandora ecosystem. All fits together well, Pandora is a real world as far as it can go in the cinema. Not a world I would like to live in though. Not because I am afraid of all these flesh-eating monstrosities living in that world. No. Rather because the defining element of the planet of Pandora seems to be bad taste, kitschy colors and 'glow in the dark' beauty. I hoped that the 1970s 'glow in the dark' artistic atrocities would never be revived, but, alas, these hopes have been in vain. In Avatar everything glows in the dark, floats gently in the night etc. etc.
Nevertheless Avatar defines a new period in movie making. Never has 3D been so natural, such an inherent part of the movie. After leaving the cinema I marvelled how one could see this movie not in 3D and still enjoy it. There are no '3D effects', no balls thrown at the viewer, no arrows aimed at me and all this. Now, 3D is here simply part and parcel of the movie.
And thus I recommend the movie, not for its story, not for its beauty, but by creating a new class of visuals and by being believable in the world it creates.",1268438400,3,2500,4.6840909090909095
3934041,3,B002HEXVUI,"This is a beautiful movie to look at on the screen. All the creatures, the setting, the colors, the makeup, the special effects.  This was all absolutely splendid.  However, the story was another comic book come to the screen of good vs. evil with earth's military being the evil.  The commander for the military is every bad cliche about a military man you've ever seen.  At two hours in, I gave up.  The over the top military aspect took over the story and I had had enough. Cameron has always made visually arresting movies.  He is a master at handling extravaganzas.  However, I am really tired of his simplistic good vs. evil story lines and the ensuing battles between the two.  Oddly enough, this reminded me of DANCES WITH WOLVES but without Kevin Costner's light handed humor added into it, which was a great leavening factor.  If you love art, you will love looking at this but two hours of looking at it is more than enough. Three is really pushing it.  I, for one, am not at all surprised this did not win the Oscar.

In both comparative cases, this is not necessarily a slight, because each of the four films is very good, if not great.  It is, however, a bit lazy and heavy-handed.  Avatar may be one of the best movies of 2009 - if not THE best - but it's as predictable as a sunrise.

Light years away from Earth in the distant future, a planet called Pandora has been discovered.  On this planet exists a wide array of exotic flora and fauna, indigenous people known as the Na'vi (more later), and incredibly valuable ore humans wish to extract.  Initial intentions are both scientific and humanitarian; exchanging knowledge, sharing in cultural understanding, providing advanced medicine.  To further this objective, the human race has created a method to splice DNA from humans and aliens creating actual Na'vi beings mentally controllable from connection pods (aka futuristic coffins with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Therapeutic-Head-Scalp-Massagers/dp/B0006VSX1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Therapeutic Head Scalp Massagers</a>).  When the largest deposit of precious material is discovered in the Na'vi woodland and underneath an unfathomably massive tree that links the inhabitants to a physical and spiritual solidarity - an ecological Mecca to the Na'vi - the confrontation between military backed corporate greed and resistance to cultural extinction becomes nearly inevitable (breakout the smallpox blankets!).  In rolls Jake (Sam Worthington) - a paraplegic war veteran substituting for his recently murdered brother - given three months to resolve the situation diplomatically (read: get the Na'vi to leave) through the usage of his own Na'vi avatar.  Flown into action by helicopter pilot Trudy Chacon (Michelle Rodriguez), and accompanied by the resident Na'vi expert Dr. Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) - essentially Diane Fossey for blue ""gorillas"" - Jake soon encounters trouble with the unnatural surroundings, gets separated from others, and runs into Na'vi Princess Neytiri (Zoe Saldana).

From there it's EXACTLY as you expect: Jake confuses priorities, attaches to his new culture, earns alien trust, finds an obvious love interest, hears nearly impossible Na'vi lore, betrays his new family, accomplishes the previously thought impossible, and leads the way in a massive battle of ""good"" versus ""evil.""

Combining a brisk story with a classical folk tale, James Cameron has created wonderful support the real star of this movie: The visuals.  Put simply, this is the most awe-inspiring visual spectacle ever created.  Ever.  Stunningly beautiful, even a plant or a bug can cause ""oohs"" and ""aahs,"" reality and CGI blend seamlessly; even the people voicing the characters seem to match perfectly.  Add in the incredible usage of 3D - not used for the cheap ""throw things at the screen"" effect - and it's a visual feast unabsorbable in one viewing.  That's the good.

The bad aspects of this film, however, are a bit unnerving.  As mentioned, the similarities to Dances with Wolves are so ubiquitous that the movie may as well have been titled ""Dances with Na'vi.""  From the foreign feeling to the Indian hoops and yips, the cultural immersion to the acceptance and connection, the animal and environment connection, the mohawks and adornments, it's a nearly identical Native American story with more parallels than worth mentioning; for crying out loud, Wes Studi voices the Na'vi Chief!

The other major flaw of this film is the characterization of good versus evil, and how the message gets heavy-handedly applied without real critical analysis.  The good guys are the pacifists and the scientists, and the bad guys are greedy military and corporate types.  The Marine Colonel responsible for most of the evil may as well have been named Col. Bad Guy in the credits.  With references to the ""hearts and minds,"" ""shock and awe,"" and the fact that the Na'vi are called terrorists, it's a sloppy reference to U.S. military action of recent history.  The mineral ""unobtainium"" (read: oil) is what the blue (read: red and/or brown) Na'vi unknowingly protect, and they are better off without our (read: the U.S.) help and intervention (read: Western influence).  To be quite honest, it's intellectually lazy and I'd appreciate avoiding the political sermon while I'm trying to be whisked off into fantasy scenarios where there are blue Indians, mutant dogs with 437 razor-sharp teeth, giant Stay Puft Marshmallow men rampaging cities, oilmen drilling into asteroids, gorgeous women created by ancient computers, time traveling Deloreans, self-aware computers, and every 80s movie in which Keith Gordon is inexplicably the male lead.

I can't blame Cameron, and I actually like the movie quite a bit.  Despite the flaws, and the incredibly simple, foreshadowed story, the technical aspects cannot be overlooked, the visuals worth 5 stars on their own merit.  Subtract the politics and the anti-military angle, and it's a 4.6 star movie worth rewatching (round it up to 5).",1268092800,3,5591,5.876390605686032

3934052,5,B002HEXVUI,"Even without knowing what this film was about, knowing that it was James Cameron's new film and that he spent something like 10 years creating this was enough to know that this was going to be something of a hiccup within movie going society. so going into the film only knowing that the graphics would be 'groundbreaking', i of course thought it would suck. however, i was pleasantly surprised.

i've heard and spoken to people who were not very impressed by the plot and pass the film off as a 'Pocahontas in space' kind of story, and it's true, that's an accurate description. something to keep in mind however is that all stories borrow from that which came before it, and most often the best stories are simply re-imaginings of earlier ideas. it could be said that pride and prejudice is nothing more than a glorified cinderella story, but that doesn't make it bad. basically, even though this movie is a blockbuster, try to keep an open mind.

the film takes place in the future and focuses on this marine, jake sully, who lost the use of his legs on the job. he gets called back to duty when his scientist twin brother dies, to take his place as an operator of an organic being grown from his brother's dna and the dna of the na'vi, the people on the planet pandora. earth is running out of resources and humans want to farm an ore found on pandora (which has become the equivalent of gold or diamonds). so the army recruited a team of scientists to create these beings that could be used to communicate with the natives and essentially move them out of their home so that they can mine the ore underneath the tree they live in. of course the scientists only have a professional interest in pandora, in the people and the land, but are funded by the government/ military and are therefore at the disposal of the source of the funding. on his first journey to panodra, jake gets separated from the other two scientists he's with and is forced to attempt to survive the night in this unknown and deadly jungle. before an unfortunate 'death by jungle dog' incident, he is found by the chief's daughter, neytiri, and she saves him. before she can leave him to fend for himself, the holy being of the na'vi signifies to her that he is important so she takes him home and he is ultimately given a trial period in the tribe to learn the ways of the people. as he learns more about the na'vi he comes to support their perspective. pretty standard stuff, but the plot isn't what grabbed me most about this film.

one of the most obvious themes in the movie was the push for environmentalism, or preserving our planet. the reason humans were in pandora was because their planet was dying, because the people on earth used and wasted almost all of their resources. this of course represents the perspective of mainstream north american society. it's pretty much an accepted philosophy that the economy rules nature, destroying nature in the name of money is logical even if it may rub some people the wrong way. it's logical. but people haven't thought this way forever, not all people and cultures think this way, and an alternative perspective is represented in the Na'vi. for them nature is the economy. to harm or destroy whatever is alive is akin to harming yourself. this of course is reminiscent of a sort of aboriginal ideology that takes time to respect the living aspect of nature and the symbiotic relationship they share with it. this connection to nature is presented in a very literal sense in the movie. the na'vi literally connect to their environment. they all have a long pony tail hairstyle, and at the end of their hair are these tentacle- like feelers that can wrap around certain things and allow them to 'plug in' to that thing. this allows them to create a bond with animals they ride and with the tree that represents their deity and holds the memories of their people. this was a lot like the way people today are constantly 'plugged in'. whether it's cellphones, ipods, computers, tv, radio, we are rarely without our technological network to connect us to our world, or the part of our world we care about. it might be harder for the average post-colonial north american to truly appreciate a connection to nature as did pre-colonial societies, so i think the way this was presented helped get that message across.

my favourite scene in the movie, and the reason i enjoyed the movie as much as i did was the scene when neytiri and the general were fighting near the end of the movie. i loved it because symbolically they were both 'plugged in' to the technology of their own worlds and were using that connection to fight each other. neytiri was connected to a this wild, jaguar/ jungle dog animal through the 'bond' and the general was sitting in this robot, gundam wing/ escaflowne kind of idea. the two of them had to use where they came from as a means to fight the other, they couldn't just face each other person to person. they were kind of like jake's na'vi body, jake was sitting in some lab somewhere while his intentions were lived out through a body not his own. basically their ideals and i guess you could say worlds were fighting against each other with the help of the intentions of the people behind the wheel.

it was not the most ground breaking film i've ever seen, nor the best told story, but overall i'd say it was a good movie and worth the watch.",1267920000,,5396,4.553038105046344
3934053,5,B002HEXVUI,"What can be said about this film that hasn't already been?

3934055,5,B002HEXVUI,"You would think that the man who redefined science fiction and action films over the past quarter century (Terminator, True Lies) and culminated with the best hat trick in movie history with Titanic garnering superlative reviews, earning the all-time box office, and winning a record 11 Oscars, would be satisfied and perhaps go on cruise control with a smaller film.  But no, Cameron aims higher with a thrilling adventure that combines game changing special effects that have to be seen on the big screen in 3-D.

In the not too distant future, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a physically challenged soldier, volunteers for an unusual mission on a far away planet, Pandora, a beautiful yet dangerous world where the blue skinned Na'vi are a primitive, enlightened race who are at one with nature and its balance of life as epitomized by the Tree of Souls, a kind of fiber optic tree that has a consciousness.  Utilizing a unique technology that enables Sully to become sentient in a genetically engineered substitute Na'vi body or avatar, he is deposited on Pandora to assimilate himself into their culture.  Led by a stern, no-nonsense scientist Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), Jake learns the ways of the Na'vi people especially through Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a proud warrior (much like the heroine in Heavy Metal) whose father is the tribal leader.  You just know that Jake and Neytiri are going to become closer in their relationship.

Sully's commanding officer, Col. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), expects him to gather intelligence on the Na'vi defense and capabilities in an effort to secure the valuable minerals beneath the Na'vi settlement.  It seems that a mining company wants the minerals at any cost.  As Sully bonds with these people and realizes that what the military plans to do, he has a change of heart and rallies all the villages to band together for a last stand and a simple battle between good and evil ensues with the Na'vi hopelessly outgunned and overly matched.

The story is simple with political overtones about preserving a green planet and the clash between science and the military.  This military is an extension of the bad asses in Cameron's Aliens.  There are obvious parallels to the Iraq War with its natural oil resource.  You can see elements of The Matrix with its out of body experience, and Star Wars: Return of the Jedi with its David versus Goliath setup.  Any fan of old Tarzan films knows how nature is harnessed by the hero.  You get the feeling that this planet's life force is a collective much as the trees in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and that something extraordinary might happen.  The avatar plot device bares loose similarities to the 1960's TV show Outer Limits episode Chameleon.  While Jake has damaged legs, he is able to revel in his new body and experiences what amounts to a rebirth. His initiation into Na'vi life is not dissimilar to the initiation rites in Dances with Wolves.

Apparently Cameron has been gestating this idea for many years, waiting for movie technology to catch up to his complicated visuals.  It was worth the wait.  He has always been at the forefront of state of the art effects (The Abyss, Terminator 2) so it comes as no surprise that he has single handedly elevated the creative possibilities of 3-D presentation to the mainstream.  Cameron does not resort to using 3-D as a gimmick by simply throwing objects at the screen but rather organically and even shots of the planet's jungles are fully realized settings with plant life and insects that jump out of the screen.  The motion capture compliments and reflects real acting.  What is remarkable is that this film is simultaneously demonstrating multiple visual effects in a seamlessly integrated presentation courtesy of Cameron's fertile imagination.

Production values don't get any better.  James Horner composes an energetic yet tender score that evokes his own Titanic and Glory.  Although the second half settles into a more conventional war film, that's a minor complaint. There is a reference to Jake's late brother (a subplot that does not add much to the story) who was originally slated for the mission.

Worthington and Saldana (Star Trek), in expressive motion capture, do a very solid job of emoting real feelings and making their love a tangible, believable union.  Lang has an intimidating presence as the military commander and it's nice to see his career resurgence (Public Enemies).  Weaver lends strong support as the wise, impassioned scientist who will defend the Na'vis even with her life.

Make no mistake: this is a groundbreaking film in terms of technical achievement and theatrical presentation.  It needs to be experienced in 3-D to get the complete experience.  Do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this landmark film.",1267747200,3,4813,4.986232790988736
3934056,2,B002HEXVUI,"No one can deny that this movie carried a significant amount of hype prior to its release. Why wouldn't it? It was James Cameron's first big movie since Titanic. This movie was the brain-child of Cameron since the 80's and now he felt he could do the movie justice with the recent innovations in technology. James Cameron succeeded in creating the most beautiful movie ever conceived, yet there is one area where he drastically failed at, the story.

  Avatar is the story of a Marine's adventure in human diplomacy with an alien species called the ""Na'vi"" on a far away planet called ""Pandora."" The way the humans conduct diplomacy is through human-Na'vi hybrids. The humans are on Pandora because there is a native substance called ""Unubtanium"" that is worth a considerable amount of money. I will not go to much further into the story so I do not spoil anything.

  The best part of this film is the visuals. The visuals are spectacular. I promise you, there is no other movie as visually jaw-dropping as Avatar. I personally watched this film in I-MAX 3D theater and was completely blown away. Every piece of this film looks extremely detailed and colorful. ""Avatar"" has set a new new bar for cinematic visuals and it will take a bit of work for anyone else to match it, let alone top it. The next best part about Avatar is the acting. There are some very solid performances and they fit their rolls nicely.

  Even with breath-taking visuals and solid performances, Avatar is met with some considerable negatives. First off, the story. If you have viewed any of the trailers for Avatar, then you basically know the story. The film is nearly 3 hours long, and many parts seem to drag on. Some parts of the movie were seemed to be elongated so we could marvel at the movie's visual brilliance, but even that fails. You see, by about an hour and a half into the movie, you start to get used to the 3D visuals and they quit looking as appealing to you. This is about the part of the movie where Cameron apparently felt that we should bring the story to a near-complete halt in order to gander at some colorful trees and such. What made Avatar a great movie also made Avatar a rather bland movie, and that is the use of vibrant visuals over a compelling story. The movie never makes any attempt to set itself apart, other than with visuals. Sure, visuals are nice, but is that all Cameron wants from his 25 year old brain-child is for it to be known as looking pretty? When maybe 10 to 15 years later the visuals used in Avatar will be considered obsolete? Avatar seems like a starch contrast to Titanic, which did have an excellent story and great visuals for its time. But looking back, do we remember Titanic for its great visuals? No, we think back to its very engaging story-line because its visuals are very obsolete. Avatar will for now be thought of as being the most visually gorgeous film thus far, but how long will it be able to keep that title?

  The second problem with Avatar is emotional detachment. How is a viewer suppose to feel any kind of emotion toward a side that they are bullied into following? Avatar pulls every trick in the book to make us want to turn away from the corporation/military/human-side and join the Na'vi. The problem with this is that there seems to be no transition between following the humans and then to the Na'vi. The human-side is full of stereo-typical corporate figureheads and military people who are more interested in genocide than negotiation. This makes it hard to want to side with them but the movie insists for us to, at first. Later, the movie forces us to follow the peace-loving Na'vi people and hate the humans. Wait, so now the movie wants me to hate the humans that they told me to love but I hated at the beginning and now love the people that at the beginning I was suppose to hate because the humans told me to? By not allowing the viewer to make up their own mind voids the emotional bond one can make with the film. If there is no type of emotional bond, then we are just staring at a bunch of moving objects for an alloted amount of time.

  ""Avatar"" is a visually spectacular in every way, but that is its only great feature. James Cameron fitted his latest film with all the eye-candy it would ever need, but just didn't give it anything else that would stand out. With a weak story and emotionless effort made by it to bond with its viewers, Avatar can ONLY be chocked up by one phrase, ""visually beautiful."" One might think that would be enough, but think hard about the best looking movie before Avatar....exactly.",1267660800,18,4590,4.519903498190591

3934058,5,B002HEXVUI,"When I read the official Amazon review first offered (and without an opportunity to say it was helpful or not), I really wondered if that reviewer had even seen the movie.  For example he described Pandora as a ""planet"" which it is not -- it is a moon, not a planet.

He was also obviously not into the movie -- at three hours, he probably spent most of his time out of his seat taking care of his ""business"" after drinking too much sugar soda and eating too much popcorn -- surely he was not moved by the story if he saw it at all.

But all three of the non-official reviews were wonderful, written by people who obviously did see it start to finish, and who understood all the implications.  For example the third and last of the non-official reviews understood how it paralleled our own European White invaders of the American continents, and their cruelty to the original inhabitants.  Even Columbus himself indulged in it, on the basis that as ""pagans"" they didn't have a soul, so it was all right to kill them, or work them to death building forts as in Puerto Rico, to where the last live native american local died once the last stone had been laid in their fort.  The Spanish did it first, but were matched by their late coming Englih invaders who were no better.  And Pocahontas (correctly named Mataoka) could have been the role model for a similar princess among the na'vi.

I saw it first with my daughter in an ordinay theater (in 3D of course), and then took my wife to see it in an iMax theater (aso in 3D -- don't think it comes in 2D in iMax versions).  I saw so much more that I now remember the 2nd time around, that I'm anxious to see it a 3rd time, and will find friends who haven't seen it to make that happen.  My wife loved it, but couldn't understand that it was ""art"" and not just photography, but she did understand that sad to say it was fiction.  I also bought the book of the same name from Amazon which told me so much more about details, that I think a 3rd viewing will be rememberable even more now that I know details I didn't know before.",1267574400,3,2074,4.278772378516624

Zoe Saldana did a fantastic job as a Naytiri. Great performances from all the actors. Great movie. I just hope James Cameron doesn't wait another 12 yrs before he makes a another movie. If you are the only few remaining people who hasn't seen this movie don't miss it. Highly Recommend this movie.",1267488000,2,596,4.4
3934060,4,B002HEXVUI,"Wow! James Cameron's ""Avatar"" is stunning and meaningful. This movie was one of the best I've seen in 2010. I went in the movie not interested but came out really wanting to watch more. The 3D version I watched made it all the better, although the movie would have been able to stand alone.  The 3D made the landscape and visuals more intense and eye appealing than I imagined.
Pandora is the planet that the valuable Unobtainium resides. The military contractors are interested in going after this despite their hardships with the Na'vi people. The Na'vi people are in tune with everything on their planet and vice versa, their connection with the mother tree is interesting. Pandora is going to be uprooted and destroyed if the military contractors don't get what they want. This is where the main actor, Jake, comes in. His DNA is going to be transported into the ""avatars"" that the scientist created to interact with the real avatars.  Jake is joined with two other scientist one played by Sigourney Weaver. They all become avatars and interact within the village. Little did Jake know that he would fall for a female warrior, Na'vi, Neytiri played by Zoe Saldana. She doesn't know Jake works for the military and scientist to figure out their way of life.
Many times the romantic bit ruins what the movie is really about, but this movie is different because of the way producers incorporate the use of nature and visuals to amuse the audience. The movie is pretty predictable because of the romance novel bit and all, but I think that the movie is still powerful even if it did incorporate some of the lovey dovey stuff.

I always am a bit of a curmudgeon about seeing/reading any movie or book that is wildly popular, there is a grumpy imp in me that thinks, ""well if everyone loves it it can't be that good"".  Well, sometimes I'm right but this time I was wrong!  From a purely technological point of view this is a masterpiece of a film, worth seeing for the visual effects alone.  And it is true that the story is incredibly simple, and predictably archetypal.  But so are most of the stories that endure and fascinate people through time.  I was drawn into the gorgeous world that Cameron created and found myself deeply touched by Jake Sully's character--the heartbreaking contrast between his life in his avatar and having to return daily to his ""real life"" in his damaged body, selling himself into service in the hope of being able to afford the medical treatment to repair his spine.  How many of our veterans now are facing such a cruel life with no hope of escape or healing?  I could not help but feel that pain in my own body and soul, I think Sam Worthington gave a wonderful, compelling performance.  The ""tough lady scientist"" role is such a natural for Sigourney Weaver that I  almost have a hard time seeing her play other characters now--yes it was predictable but wonderful nonetheless.  I couldn't help smiling at her remark that she'd die to get samples from the Tree of Souls--funny how we see into our futures without knowing it.

As other reviewers have noted, yes there is a ""noble savage"" romanticism to the film, but I find it forgivable in that this is not a  saccharine romanticization of some real group of people but a fictional creation.  Some reviewers have called this movie ""Dances With Wolves/Pocahontas with Aliens"", but I think there is a very big difference between a science fiction story that is entirely made up, and the distortion of actual historical facts and events that characterized those movies (gag retch).  One my favorite moments of the movie was when the Pandoran animals joined in the battle--my husband and I looked at each other and grinned and said, ""The planet is fighting back!!""  Yes, we're tree-hugging environmentalists, and James Cameron was certainly preaching to the choir with us as far as the ""message"" of the film was concerned.  But I came away feeling an even deeper appreciation for our own planet and fellow creatures and a renewed commitment to our ideals and goals--it's very rare that a sci-fi epic does that for me, this film was much more than the yummy brain/eye-candy entertainment that movies like Star Wars provide.

I think this is a film that can be appreciated on a lot of different levels, I will definitely be buying the DVD.  I confess I haven't been a huge fan of James Cameron's in the past, I generally have found his films to be heavy on action and spectacle but the scripts wooden and forced despite the amazing cast's best efforts (think Titanic) but in this film I think he finally found the magic blend--truly beautiful!",1266969600,4,3077,4.6648148148148145

3934064,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is one of those rare movies that really should be seen (if you possibly can) during its theatrical release, especially the ""3D"" version of the film.  I'm not dissing the (at this writing) future DVD and Blue-Ray releases, but this is clearly a movie designed to completely immerse you in the world that James Cameron and his team have created.  You will miss some of that experience at home, even in many of the more sophisticated ""Home Theater"" setups that are out there.

In addition to achieving many major technological breakthroughs in his quest to provide such an experience, Mr. Cameron has also devoted a great deal of effort to make the ""World"" of Pandora as realistic as possible.  This includes developing a whole biological encyclopedia of several thousand alien plant and animal species to populate the world, as well as investing in the development of a true spoken language for the Na'vi people, who are the natives of Pandora fighting to preserve their lives and culture in the face of human exploitation of their world.

Many past ""3D"" films had two major flaws, the first being inadequate technology: resulting in a 3D experience that was clearly not quite true to life - with various artifacts such as blurring, double images or odd colors if you didn't have the 3D glasses on just right and your head oriented perfectly.  I experienced none of this in watching Avatar.  The ""3D"" imagery worked for me throughout the film without eye-wrenching distortions or artifacts.  Once the film started, I completely forgot about the special glasses, nor was there a need to hold my head ""just so"".

The second common flaw in 3D films is that those who make them often fall into the trap of thinking that ""3D"" is so cool that their audience will enjoy having the integrity and flow of the film compromised just so they can experience some cool 3D effects, such as things jumping out of the screen at you.  While things certainly do ""jump"" in this film, I never once felt that a scene was staged with that as the primary goal.  Again, Cameron clearly stayed focused on the quality of our immersion within the world he had created: all the new technology he employed in making this film was a tool, not a toy.

Now, on to the storyline itself...

I was really impressed with Cameron's ""turning the camera around"" to show us how we might be seen by other (less technologically advanced) cultures who ""get in the way"" of our expansion.  This theme is one that has been played out in real life time and time again throughout the history of humanity.  I think that the lesson here is a valuable one; yet, it was done imaginatively and without being too heavy-handed or ""preachy"" as I feel that other recent films (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Feet-HD-DVD/dp/B000V7O0GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy Feet [HD DVD</a>] have done.  To put it another way, the storyline is just as impressive and thoughtfully done as the visuals, and again the goal of producing a realistic and engaging experience that we can immerse ourselves in was pursued without allowing distractions to creep in and compromise the finished product.

Finally, the themes in this film are so similar to Alan Dean Foster's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midworld/dp/0345350111/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midworld</a>&nbsp;(published in 1975, and a book I highly recommend) that I would be very surprised if Cameron had not read Midworld at some point before he began work on Avatar.  There is no mention of this in the film's credits, though I have found some speculation about this on various blogs and newsgroups.  Though an interesting side note, this does not distract from the film's quality or impact.

In summary, I will say something I have not said in any of my past reviews, which is that this is a superb film, and one you should see at least once in the Theatres, if not several times.  You should also consider getting a copy-of once it becomes available on Blue-Ray and DVD.  Avatar is definitely worth a rating of 5 Stars, enjoy!",1266796800,4,4132,5.036710719530102

James Cameron stopped making movies long ago. Now he makes events.  He made history with Titanic and he's made more of it with his latest film, Avatar. There is a reason he keeps us waiting sometimes ten years or longer between his films: he wants it to be done right. This is something which seems to be overlooked entirely by many of today's directors making big scale action pictures.

At last - a huge Hollywood Blockbuster worthy of computer generated characters is upon us. Rumors placing Avatar's budget at somewhere between 250 and 300 million dollars, are not in the least bit unfortunate; as the film has already more than doubled that amount in profits, and is still continuing to roll in the dough for 20th Century Fox.

James Cameron promised the world he would deliver us something that we had never seen before and needless to say, he delivered. He filmed a rough cut of the entire movie once, three years ago with the entire cast in special-ally designed suites that would visually capture their every movement, to later be loaded into computers. Then, he waited; for technology to advance so that he could apply the CGI to his actors properly, and finish the film.

I have heard a lot of what I like to call jealous and or insecure people, ripping on Cameron for being a poor writer. I have read a lot of screenplays and I recently read his script for his 1986 film, Aliens. I'm here to tell you, it was the best original screenplay I have ever read. James Cameron is a true artist both visually and on the page.

He may not create some of the most dialogue-driven characters and his films do tend to have the traditional three act structure with a boy meets girl concept to them; but clearly he's doing a good job, or his films would not be as successful as they are. Much like Michael Bay, Cameron doesn't need avid fans like me to defend him - the ticket-sales speak more than loudly enough on his behalf; so I'll shut up about that now, and get on with the review.

Sam Worthington stars as a wheel-chair-bound Marine, by the name of Jake Sully. The year is 2154 and wars still wage on. When a group of Military officials decide to raid a foreign planet called Pandora, in search of valuable minerals; they need Jake's help.

Prior to being killed, the Military had a special avatar designed for Jake's twin brother to operate. They planned on using this avatar to blend in with the natives of Pandora, in an effort to obtain valuable information regarding the whereabouts of the precious mineral. Having the exact genetic build as his twin, Jake sees how valuable he is. If he agrees to help, he will be given an expensive operation that will restore his legs to working order. He agrees.

Pandora is a truly beautiful place. In a way it resembles Earth a great deal. It has rich green forests and breath-taking waterfalls. It also has islands, but rather than poke up from the ocean, they simply float in mid-air. The downside is that its air source is not adaptable for human lungs.

The inhabitants of Pandora are a race of large blue people with tails, pointy cat-like ears and yellow eyes, standing at maybe 10 or 12 feet in height. Jake's avatar, is designed to look like one of these natives of Pandora, called the Na'vi.

He is heavily sedated in a special tube-like chamber and once unconscious, is able to mobilize his avatar with his brain. He can taste, touch, feel, hear, see and even walk or run with his new body. Worthington is marvelous at convincing us that it has been God knows how long, since he had the use of his legs.

Once on Pandora, Jake meets a beautiful native named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). She saves his life from a savage beast of her forest, and takes him to meet her people. He becomes attached to the Na'vi and especially Neytiri.

When the Military reveal their plans to annihilate the Na'vi, if they don't disperse from the area where the sacred mineral is believed to be; Jake must defend them. The Military is headed up by one of the best villains ever: Colonel Miles Quaritch. He was played superbly by Stephen Lang.

If you get a chance to see the film in 3-D, I highly recommend it. It's without a doubt the best 3-D film I have ever seen. It's not done to have cheap thrills pop out your face simply for the purpose of making you jump in your seat. It's designed to make you feel like you are there with the characters and that's exactly what it does.

One of the things I found most interesting about the film, was the numerous uses of avatars. Jake's character obviously uses his avatar to blend in with the Na'vi. The Military use avatar-like robots similar to those used in Aliens and Iron Man, to navigate around; and the Na'vi use animals and creatures in the forest as avatars, by linking their tentacle-like membranes into the ears of these beasts.

It's more than obvious that the film has underlying themes regarding the early Americans and the Native Americans. You can arguably find similarities in today's political issues and conflicts as well. What's great however is that they aren't forced down our throats, and if wanted they could easily be overlooked entirely, for the purpose of just enjoying the film.

I've heard countless opinions of people who think James Cameron is a racist against whites because he makes them look bad by taking over the Na'vi; I have head others say he's racist because the Na'vi are played by either black or Native American actors and he purposely had them be dark-skinned characters etc, etc. Having seen the film twice and having heard James Cameron defend it in countless interviews; I can honestly say that I don't think he is coming from a racial, anti-American or in any other possible way, negative place with Avatar. It's simply a film about people in general and the main thing to take from is as simple as the oldest rule in the book: do unto others as you would have done unto you.",1266710400,2,6216,4.602169981916817
3934066,3,B002HEXVUI,"The vision of the director and the visual effects are stunning. The motion capture cameras are a true technological marvel. No amount of animation or prosthetics could have made this possible. The imagination and creativity which went into creating pandorum and its inhabitants is mind boggling.

Alas great visual effects does not a movie make. With a wafer thin story line, you always put the movie in peril when you drag it out past the 2 hour mark. Also it seemed like the movie had an identity crisis - it seemed to shuttle between between the action genre as well as drama. But in the end fulfilling neither to satisfaction.

In summary, watch it for the visual effects. Don't expect anything more.",1266710400,2,704,4.762295081967213
3934067,5,B002HEXVUI,"Some people have expressed disappointment with Avatar.  I can only imagine that this was because they could not find the game controller during the entire film.  Perhaps they felt let down because of the aspects of drama and human interest were mixed in with the action.  Perhaps some part of the storyline seemed too familiar with the real world.  Perhaps the failure to liberate Pandora and make it free and democratic was a rub with some.  However, I found it to be spectacular with good character development and morals.  Packed with action, fantasy, stunning visual effects, and a love story on top of it all.  If you get a chance to see it at the movies in 3D you will be glad you did and you will most likely want the DVD when it comes out.  I must admit that I fell in love with a girl that never was and she is blue.  I have always been a sucker for that.",1266624000,3,864,4.283950617283951
3934068,5,B002HEXVUI,"There are a lot of wonderful in-depth reviews for this movie and I'm a johnny come lately. I know, however, that I have been well fed if after three weeks of seeing the movie I am still thinking about it :-) How many movies can you say have had an impact on you, an impact strong enough to help you rethink about what we take for granted and how easy it is for some humans to take something that isn't theirs to take. It's a story that has been told by many people and cultures about living in a place of stark beauty and the monster of envy crushing that beauty. In this story the people fight back but they aren't enough to push back the intruders what transpires thereafter is awe-inspiring to even the most insensitive soul.

I have been surprised, however, that there have been a few people who watched the movie and they just plain said: ""I don't get it."" Then I smile because I think that's the theme of Avatar: The war between those who don't get it and those who do.",1266624000,5,975,4.241935483870968
3934069,1,B002HEXVUI,"Wow.  Every frame of this film is desinged with one aim, to manipulate the audience.  And if your into consensual mind-F, then you'll really like this movie.  Me, when I see a heavy handed morality tale that seeks to take my mind and turn it into play-dough, I bristle.

Cameron lost me when the Indians...I mean Natives...I mean Navi were first shown.  With their huge cute eyes that subconsciously elicit certain responses in humans.  The first response to this neotenous trait is the same response people get when looking at babies.  You know sympathy, an urge to care for them, and yes even love.  The second characteristis is restricted to men (and alot of men find the Navii protaganist to be sexy).  Men prefere women with big eyes because it signals a high level of estrogen which makes getting pregnant easier.  So big eyes are a very effective means of manipulation.  As an aside, magazines and advertisers almost always increase the size of the eyes of women on their covers, and often times babies too with photoshop/cgi.  And hey, lets have the Navvi look almost exactly like humans, and lets have some of them speak perfect English...yeah real they real alien.

Then Cameron wheels out the bad guys: the psychopathic corporation and the psycopathic military. Oh and lets not forget the evils of technology.  No moral ambiguities here, thats for sure.  It's the ugly techno-baby-killers vs the big-eyed-beautiful-good-people.  You know, as an aside, pre-Columbian cultures were just a vicious and ruthless as the Euros.  And no they didn't live in harmony with the environment.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1491-New-Revelations-of-the-Americas-Before-Columbus/dp/1400032059/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus</a>.  And the dislocation of the Natives was no different than what had been happening in human history since time immemorial.  The only difference was that the euro settlers did not wipe them out or enslave them,  and they tried to make it legal buy paying them money.

Anyway, this movie works only if your mind is like plastacine.

Finally, the revolutionary-ness of this film has been way overstated.  CGI worlds?  How about The Phantom Menace from 1999.  3-D, crickey 3-d movies have been spreading like a rash for the last 5 years.  And the 3-d in this movies suffers from what all 3-d movies suffer from.  First, the bluring of rapid movement, the loss of brightness as each eye is only recieving 50% of the light it would have in a 2-D screening which destroys lighting nuance and detail, and finally the loss of the ability to take in the whole frame.  You have to focus on a particular plane when watching 3-d, which makes the rest of the image out of focus.  Yes, I will admit that this movie and Lovely Bones (released at around the same time) make use of 3-d cgi more extensively than other movies, but realistic 3-d cgi is not new nor revolutionary.

Side note: 3-d films are not actually 3 dimensional.  They use the same stereoscopic technique that was invented in the mid 19th century.",1266624000,26,3116,5.110891089108911
3934070,1,B002HEXVUI,"James really delivered a disappointing film this time around, which leaves me with the question of what the hell was he doing the past 10 years? Did he really think some of us wouldn't notice the stolen material from other films that he used in his movie. James STOLE already used ideas from Aliens, King Kong, Conan the Barbarian, The Matrix 3, Lord of the Rings and more. The robotic machine the marines use were already in the 3rd Matrix, James just added a cover to the machine. Almost every animals movements in the film mimic the animals in Peter Jackson's King Kong, which his Co. did the CGI but didn't change the movement patterns at all, the giant lizard in King Kong moves exactly like the giant cat in Avatar, no originality at all. In the movie when Avatars are gathering others to fight they arrive at a tribe call 4 winds in the desert, 4 Winds is the name of a GOD in Conan the Barbarian & happens to be in the desert also.  I'd also like to add that a book series and DVD series called AVATAR has been made since at least 2003 so James didn't create the name either. The list goes on & on. Bottom line is that this film was missing so many details that the CGI really couldn't make up for it, and your left looking at some pretty colors. The sad thing is alot of people like this movie, even though its pure garbage, they are just easily entertained. James had 10 years to write this movie & all he came up with is junk. At the beginning of the movie, we are told that the lead characters brother died from "" being mugged for the cash in his wallet"". 75% of our $ now is in computers, are you really gonna believe that we still use cash in 2125 ? So right away the movie starts off bad. If you wanna see a good movie of James's watch Aliens, cause Avatar is a BIG disappointment.",1266537600,14,1796,4.205797101449275
3934071,4,B002HEXVUI,"Although the general plot of Avatar has been filmed many times before, the vivid, imaginary world created by Cameron transcends the predictability of the story line.  When you sit down to watch this film, particularly if you are lucky enough to see it in 3-D, you won't care that others have compared it to Dances With Wolves or Princess Mononoke or any other white man versus indigenous people/nature because you will be swept up by the fantastical landscape and the particulars of the indigenous culture.  Once you are immersed, you might even forget that this world, Pandora, does not exist, not even in some remote place on earth the way New Zealand stood in for Middle Earth in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Avatar is that convincing.

The basic plot, with no spoilers:  Jake (Sam Worthington), a paralyzed Marine with the same DNA as his recently deceased twin, arrives on Pandora, a planet described as a ""hell hole,"" to take his brother's place in an experiment.  Scientists, working parallel to the military and to a private venture seeking to obtain valuable ore, have created a hybrid body made of human and indigenous Na'vi DNA to allow the humans to intermingle with the natives in a kind of half-anthropology, half-diplomatic effort.  Jake exceeds everyone's expectations as he finds himself in the middle of the native culture, part of an inner circle that believes he has the blessing of their god.  As these story lines tend to go, the greedy villains try to use Jake for their own purposes while he begins to realize that this alien people needs his protection.

Steven Lang is wonderfully snarly as the Colonel, a man who values no one above himself.  Sigourney Weaver, while not at her best, provides a decent portrayal of the principle investigator running the avatar project.  Zoe Saldana (who played Uhura in last year's Star Trek) provides the voice and computer data points for the face of Neytiri, the young Na'vi woman entrusted with Jake's education; although we never see the actress for real, she is very much part of the success of this film.

The 3-D experience was breathtaking -- literally.  The scenes on the edge of high drops as Avatar Jake and Neytiri leap from place to place gave me the same sickening experience as if I really saw two people close to the edge of a cliff.  And the real-ness of Pandora was enhanced by given the impression that I was actually immersed in this imagined world.  Of course, when the DVD is released, viewers won't have any of these sensations; however, the beauty of Pandora, with all its wonderful and dangerous creatures, should still be conveyed.  If you haven't already seen this film, you should, whether in 3-D or 2-D.

3934072,3,B002HEXVUI,"[The following review of James Cameron-directed ""Avatar"" refers to the 2-D version of the film.]

James Cameron's hugely successful ""Avatar"" is a sci-fi action film that has state-of-the-art visual effects with a ""Titanic""-like storyline. The setting crucial to the story (created by the director himself) is detailed and convincing (visually, I mean), and the film certainly delivers as action spectacle, but Cameron's latest effort suffers from lackluster script (with some major plot holes), one-dimensional characters and overacting from the supports - just like his Oscar-winning film in 1997.

As other reviewers have provided a good summary of the plot, I add only this. Even seen in the 2-D format, the film's visuals of the imaginary star Pandora is staggering. Seen on the big screen of the theater, some scenes (like the bird's eye view of the rocky cliffs and characters climbing them up) might cause you dizziness, though it must be said some of the visuals during the action scenes need improvement. Also, as to the star Sam Worthington playing the hero Jake Sully, he deserves every accolade he has received.

However, the same cannot be said of the script, which looks like a reheated version of ""Dances with Wolves."" ""Avatar"" describes the futuristic world in which scientists can create ""avatars"" of the native humanoid ""Na'vi"" while Jake, a paraplegic marine, has to use a wheelchair. Maybe the contrast, which some viewers would take as inconsistency, was intended as irony. Maybe not. We are not sure because the film's script (penned by Cameron) deals with thought-provoking themes very clumsily, with a greedy big corporate and its irresponsible manager, plus the militant ""Colonel"" hired by them, both played by Giovanni Ribisi and Stephen Lang with their over-the-top acting.

""Avatar"" is an entertaining action movie with eye-popping visuals - entertaining as long as you let yourself drawn into the visual world and can accept the heavy-handed storytelling.",1266451200,2,1984,5.288888888888889
3934073,5,B002HEXVUI,"This will be a brief review.

I have seen the 3D version twice and the 2D version once.  I first saw the 3D version to make sure it would be appropriate to take the kids and was stunned by how good it looked!  Definitely the current state of the art in 3D.  But you can read all about how good it is in 3D from others here.

However, like everyone else, I have 2D at home and wanted to see how good it would be when I finally bought it for viewing on my 72"" Samsung DLP.  Wow!  What a disappointment!

From what I could see, Cameron appears to have taken one of the ""eyes"" (video channels) of the 3D version before they did the color, etc. enhancements and sent it directly to film.  The colors were washed out (almost pastel) and the film was very ""soft"", almost blurry (I even had the projectionist check the focus, and it was ""in focus"" from the projector).  Compared to a 2D visual stunner like the ""Star Trek"" reboot, this was almost like watching a standard definition animation.  UGH!  And don't get me started on the horrible 24 fps judder during the many action sequences (compared to the 72fps PER EYE, 144fps total of the theatrical 3D version)!

IMO, if this film had been released only in 2D, with this level of ""fit and finish"", it would have been a horribly expensive flop.  I truly hope that Cameron and company do a proper job in finishing it for a 2D blu-ray before its release (and put in the additional 40 minutes he wanted, but was left on the cutting room floor) or they won't be able to give it away.

OK, here is the short version of this review:  Run, don't walk, to your nearest theater and see it in 3D!  If you saw it in 2D and liked it, you will LOVE it in 3D!  Skip the 2D version until they properly process it (hopefully) for the 2D blu-ray release!",1266451200,,1781,4.218934911242603
3934074,5,B002HEXVUI,"My daughter practically had to drag me out of the house to see Avatar.  I usually insist on waiting to watch movies at home on my 42"" TV because movie theaters and I do not get along.  Can't stand the dirt, the crowds, the over-priced snacks, the deafening sound systems, etc...  I'm seventy years old, and entitled to my crankiness...

When we got to the theater, we discovered that their 3-D projector was under repair.  My daughter was disappointed that I'd be unable to experience Avatar that way,  but I wasn't looking forward to wearing weird glasses for hours because....  Well, you recall that seventy-year-old thing...  Not seeing it in 3-D turns out to be a REALLY GOOD THING!  Why?  because now I have a good excuse to go see Avatar AGAIN!!

Other reviewers have said just about all that needs to be said of the magnificent and groundbreaking qualities of this film, so I won't trouble to go there again.  Instead, I will tell you of my personal reactions and thoughts.

1.  Avatar is a visual feast.  The details of the world and the creatures in it are amazing, and simply beautiful.  It made me recall watching ""Planet Earth,"" but this was an imaginary world of wonders created by a human mind. The sheer glory of the planet and it's people took my breath away, brought tears to my eyes, and gave me what I call ""beauty-shivers.""

2.  The oneness of all things, as expressed so beautifully in Avatar, is a truth that does apply to any ecosystem, as we are discovering the hard way right now.  The religion of the people of the world in the film simply expresses gratitude to their deity, and puts into action their recognition that no creature can make a move that doesn't effect all other creatures through interdependence and interconnectedness.  As it is said, all energy is borrowed.  This same gratitude and recognition is very common in the philosophies of our world.  While watching the film, I found myself thinking repeatedly of St. Francis of Assisi, who even carried a worm across the road so it wouldn't get hurt.  Ditto Gandhi.

3.  There is reason to hope that Avatar will encourage people to be kind to each other and to the world.  Tree-huggers and ecologists, arise!!

4.  At the end, the scientist and the awe-struck child are the same being.  We should quit acting as though that isn't true.

5.  The Wizard of Oz, Gone With the Wind, Cinderella, King Kong, and Titanic have been pushed down a notch on the list.  Avatar is now number one.

6.  I can't believe Avatar was around three hours long!  My (seventy-year-old) bones can't usually sit in one position that long, but today I had an out-of-body experience at the theater. Great story!

7.  AVATAR MUST BE SEEN ON THE BIG SCREEN!  Then buy the DVD or Blu-Ray as a memento.  That's what I'm going to do.

8.  The comparison others have made between Avatar with Dances and Wolves makes sense on a very superficial level, but Avatar outweighs all competition by a huge distance because of its depth and amazing creativity.

3934076,5,B002HEXVUI,"The 1970 film ""Little Big Man"", starring Dustin Hoffman and directed by Arthur Penn, marked a turning point in America's perception of its history. It was the fictionalized account of the unforgivable massacre by American soldiers of a  Southern Cheyenne village at Sand Creek, and of the totally justified revenge of the Cheyenne and Souix at Little Big Horn. A huge box office success, Little Big Man followed the fine book ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee""; both the film and the book lamented the genocide committed against the aboriginal peoples of North America. In 1970, it was too late for apologies, but the guilty conscience awakened by  such a confession has persisted. ""Little Big Man"" was not perceived, however, as ONLY about genocide; it was recognized immediately as a repudiation of ecological destruction in the name of 'capitalism' and progress -- a manifesto of environmentalism -- and as a 'parable' of America's senseless, criminal conduct in the Vietnam War, that war which the US Armed Forces LOST despite their overwhelming superiority of war machines. The hateful, arrogant, unredeemable villain in ""Little Big Man"" was George Armstrong Custer; when Custer was finally ""rubbed out"", young Americans cheered in theaters from Sea to Shining Sea.

Sound familiar, all you who have seen ""Avatar""? [If you haven't seen Avatar, stop reading! I can't possibly avoid 'spoilers' in this review.] The first two-thirds of ""Avatar"" is a remake, almost scene by scene, of ""Little Big Man."" The paraplegic hero of the former coincides with the height-challenged hero of the latter. There's the same inter-racial love story, the same conflict between rivals, and the despicable commander of the American occupying forces is Custer resurrected in all his odious bloodlust. Also, the use of napalm against a forest-dwelling enemy is bound to remind some people of Vietnam, don't you think? But this time, in Avatar, the indigenes WON! Hurray! I'm with them, Pale Face. Go home, Earthlings! Perish on your own ecologically devastated, overheated planet!

The levels of analogy pile higher. Detail after detail of Avatar resonates in the context of America's futile occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan. As 'Little Big Man' alerted audiences to the ambiguity of America's role in Vietnam, one hopes that 'Avatar' will touch the psyches of Americans who still insist that Might can make things Right in the Middle East.

Make no mistake, movie-goers: This is a powerfully, painfully anti-American film! Yes, of course, the Spanish, Portuguese, English, French, Dutch, and Belgians were every bit as guilty of genocide as the Americans, so one could argue that 'Avatar"" is more broadly an anti-colonialist film ... but, but, but, all the characters are plainly Americans, in an American-owned future. And even more broadly, it's an anti-capitalist film, since the essential conflict it portrays is explicitly between the ""interests of share-holders"" and the 'new world paradise' being ravaged for mere greed, gold being replaced in the story by the mineral ""unobtainium.""

Oddly enough, it's also a hi-tech computer graphic exposition of the philosopher Spinoza's perception that Nature is the sum of itself, and an adequate explanation of its own existence if one only gathers enough empirical evidence, and that therefore Existence is identical to God and God is nothing more or less than the totality of Existence, i.e. Nature. [Now, if that insight doesn't earn me a few dozen negative responses here on the Amazon, I'm a Neanderthal's uncle.]&nbsp;

And predictably, I hated it at the start of the film. It all looked like a glorified cartoon. But soon enough I got immersed in the story and forgot about the cartoonish presentation.

I am generally a total sucker for movies about indigenous, 'primitive' people. In fact I'd love to learn from them how to live in the wild in various parts of the world, with no job, no mortgage, just hunting, gathering, and finding my place in nature and using its resources with skill. My favourite all-time movie is Apocalypto.

So it's no surprise really that this film entertained me. I'm not too fussed about 3D and the technical aspects, like I said if you don't get into the story, then it all looks like a video game, rather than a film.

Heard comments that this is as Anti-American movie. Hmmm I don't know, the movie certainly made heaps of money to some globalist Americans in Hollywood. Go figure. Maybe the makers are so arrogant they don't care what people think, as long as they get their money. I think the global market is increasingly anti-imperialist and eco-conscious, and the producers saw a demand for such a movie. Lucky for us.

3934081,5,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron's Avatar does for science fiction movies what Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight did for action thrillers in 2008. Both of these pictures raise the bar as to what must be considered entertainment and expand on the notion of a movie-going experience, not to mention the fact that both films blur the boundaries of their respective genres.

Like The Dark Knight, Avatar is a movie that refuses to be defined by labels, a movie that is so delightfully entertaining that it makes the viewer question why they have settled for so little during their previous movie-going experiences.

Simply put, Avatar is a movie of epic proportions. It's a film that boggles your mind not by its complexity but by the strength of its creator's imagination and willingness to push the envelope to previously unforeseen depths.

It's clearly evident that James Cameron spared no expense in filming Avatar, but he didn't do it for the sake of overspending. The world he conjures up, that of a different planet with an indigenous population that speak their own language, deserved tremendous scope - from CGI filming, to humongous battle scenes, to blowing things up, to costume and makeup design that must've made daily routine a nightmare on the set.

You might've heard the critics claim that Avatar's plot is unsatisfactory. Although it might be the case that the plot is very simple, the visual storytelling more than makes up for the simplicity of the story. Visually, it's hard to find a more worthwhile movie to see in theaters. Not only did Cameron reinvent the way 3D movies are filmed, he recreated the way they look on the big screen. Then again, I would even go so far as to argue that the world that Cameron created in Avatar is so rich, so gratifying and so magnificent, that the actual plot of the movie is secondary, at best.

As someone who thinks Titanic is the one of the most overrated movies of our time, I found the incredible vision of the legendary filmmaker compelling, to say the least. It's hard to fathom that the man who was responsible for dragging the viewer through a sappy love story can envision a world this richly textured.

If there ever was a movie that must be watched in theaters, specifically, on an IMAX screen, Avatar is definitely that film.

Is Avatar the smartest film you'll ever see? Hardly. Is it a film of Academy Award caliber? Definitely. Is it a breathtakingly beautiful film that you'll want to watch again and again? Absolutely! In fact, I'm going back to experience it in IMAX 3D as soon as I can.",1266105600,2,2546,4.746606334841629

3934083,5,B002HEXVUI,"I didn't expect to like ""Avatar"", the new film from director James Cameron, as much as I did. From the moment I first saw the trailer, the people Cameron spent almost a decade perfecting, the tall, blue Alien race created with new advancements in filmmaking and 3-D technology, seemed fake. And it didn't help when I learned the film would run almost three hours. Three hours is a long time to sit wearing 3-D glasses over your existing glasses. But as the hype began to grown, I dutifully purchased two tickets for a screening in an AMC IMAX screen. I knew I wanted to see the film in 3-D, but after experiencing 3-D on an IMAX screen, I knew I had to take this extra step for this event.

""Avatar"" is an experience, more than a film. The story is not the most original (I have seen two comparisons of how closely the story matches two other popular films, and I have been told there are more) but the same could be said of ""Titanic"", Cameron's last film. What sets the filmmaker's works apart from others is the scale of the canvas he tells these stories on and the craft he uses to tell these stories. It almost seems like he wants to get the story hammered down so he can start to concentrate on the other elements involved and craft a really great film. In ""Titanic"", he recreates the large cruise ship's only sailing to tell the story of two young lovers traveling across the Atlantic to what they hope will be new beginnings. Of course, they don't arrive in America as planned, but the story remains an indelible and romantic film. It also launched both Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet into a new era of their careers. As you know, it became the highest grossing film of all time. Until ""Avatar""...

So, it took some time for Cameron to come up with a follow-up. As the story goes, he went to a couple of his visual effects partners to talk about this project and they stated they were at least ten years away from being able to tell the story he wanted to tell in the way he wanted to tell it. What does Cameron do? He waits. And develops technology of his own to help improve the motion capture technology he would use, the same technology Robert Zemeckis (""Polar Express"", ""Beowulf"", ""A Christmas Carol"") has been using for some time. The difference is Cameron has taken this technology to a new level, giving all of the characters more life and more human reactions, movements and expressions.

It is also, in my mind, the first film to fully embrace the 3-D technology in a way that adds to the film. In many 3-D offerings, the 3-D enhances the look and feel of the film, adding dimension and depth to buildings, walks, etc. In ""Avatar"", the 3-D helps make the action scenes more exciting and visceral. It reminds me of the 3-D films of the 50s. ""House of Wax"" opens with a busker hitting a ping-pong ball to get the attention of people walking by. A few times, he hits the ball at the camera and people in the audience were said to flinch back because they thought the ball was coming at them. In ""Avatar"", there are a few moments when the characters are riding on these winged beasts and the 3-D camera work seems to scream, ""Look at me"" but in a good way. You actually get a feeling for the flight of these creatures and it makes an exhilarating experience.

Jake Scully (Sam Worthington, ""Terminator Salvation"", the upcoming ""Clash of the Titans"" remake) is a paraplegic former Marine who steps in and takes over an assignment meant for his twin brother. He is going to travel to Pandora, a planet holding a necessary and valuable resource for Earth. Given the Earth needs the new power supply, they have already set up a colony on Pandora, to mine the resource. But the indigenous people, the Na'vi, blue skinned creatures standing seven and eight feet tall, are fighting back, trying to save their planet. Dr. Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), sympathetic to the Na'Vi, has come up with a program in which Avatars are used by real people to enter and hopefully help the people who are indigenous to the planet. They want the Na'Vi to relocate to allow easier access to the valuable and necessary mineral the humans of Earth need. The government and the private contractor they have hired are becoming impatient and want to move things along, so they decide to use trained Maries. The assignment is attractive to Jake because it allows him an escape from his wheelchair, giving him the freedom he craves and misses, even if only while using his Na'Vi Avatar. He quickly meets Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a fierce warrior who doesn't trust Jake at first. But Jake begins to help the Na'Vi in ways his boss, Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) doesn't like.

I have seen comparisons of this basic story to both ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""Pocahontas"" and I have heard of many more. Most films made today could fall under the same scrutiny. It is very difficult, at this point, to tell a completely original story. What is important for me is how the screenwriter, director and actors make the new project their own. In ""Avatar"", Cameron creates a completely new world with the same skill and expertise he has used on every one of his previous films. While watching ""The Abyss"", I often feel I am trapped in the underwater vessel along with Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Every time I watch ""Aliens"", I feel like I am at Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver) side as she battles the Alien. In ""Terminator 2"", I feel like I am along for the ride with Ahnuld, Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong, personally invested in stopping Judgment Day. That is Cameron's gift. He gives his characters such insurmountable tasks we can't help but find them intense. Their intensity makes them more interesting and believable. We feel every moment of pain they go through as they try to meet these seemingly impossible goals.

He is also one of the few filmmakers who seem to invest as much in his characters and story as he does in the special effects. Cameron is a very creative filmmaker and doesn't care if he pushes the boundaries of what can be done with special effects. The 'water sprite' in ""The Abyss"" was created with new technology and this same technology was further refined to create the T-1000 for ""Terminator 2"". As mentioned before, when he first came up with the idea for this film, he had to wait for the technology to develop and to create some of his own magic to aid in the process.

To give you an idea of the kind of magic Cameron has created here, a number of top Hollywood filmmakers, including Spielberg and Peter Jackson visited the set during production, eager to check out the new technology.

As Jake becomes more invested in the Na'Vi people, we learn more about their lives and their culture. All of the people have these long ponytails they use to connect to the animals and their planet. When they are using these large winged animals for battle and transportation, they connect their ponytails to them and they form a symbiotic relationship. Neytiri also shows Jake how to use the ponytail to connect to the planet, the fibers seem to intertwine with the roots of trees. And all of these lead to a larger parable about the environment. The Na'Vi people are trying to protect their unique and beautiful planet. The humans are trying to mine a valuable resource and don't really care if they destroy it; Earth needs this mineral to continue to survive.

There is a scene late in the film in which we come upon a large gathering of Na'Vi, sitting cross-legged in front of the ""Tree of Life"". All of the people plugged in with their ponytails, swaying back and forth, chanting, the blue palette glowing with the rhythm of the music. This scene initially struck me as a little too 'hippy dippy', but somehow Cameron managed to make me quickly forget it and I became even more involved in the story.

Ultimately, what I am trying to say is that this film is an experience that needs to be seen to give it justice. Nothing I can describe or discuss would adequately impart anything that can do the film justice.

Perhaps even more important? The film doesn't feel like it is two hours and forty plus minutes long, it feels shorter.

And when you see it, please see it in 3-D. IMAX 3-D is even better. You won't regret it.",1265846400,,8238,4.570074475287745
3934084,5,B002HEXVUI,"I don't know all the details, but at some point, James Cameron (Titanic, Aliens, Terminator) and Pixar were both considering doing a film based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter of Mars, a series of science fiction novels that followed his Tarzan series. For whatever reason, Cameron decided instead to do an anti-capitalist, New Age picture that is vaguely inspired by the novels; while Pixar opted to do a faithful adaptation of the series, the first of which is due to come out in 2012. One reason the series has not been attempted before is because the technology hasn't been available to create the weird creatures that populate Burroughs' version of Mars, which he calls Barsoom. Both Cameron's film Avatar, and the upcoming Pixar film, utilize a seamless combination of digital animation and live action, as well as state-of-the-art 3D technology.

Avatar is a visual and cinematic masterpiece, with eye-popping scenery and special effects. The story, on the other hand, is a bit worn. One younger viewer compared it to Pocahontas - the big, bad white conquistadors invading the innocent natives' pristine jungle. That may make for a politically correct tale in an age gone mad over ""green,"" but it doesn't add up if you think about it too much. Nevertheless, Avatar is a very entertaining film, and one that breaks ground for future innovations.

While art direction and special effects are the obvious stars, Sam Worthington (Terminator Salvation), turns in a strong performance as Jake Sully, a paraplegic Marine that scientists can transform, virtually, into a creature called an avatar, so that he resembles and can interact with the beings that populate the moon Pandora, where the story takes place. Also good is Zoe Saldana (Star Trek, Vantage Point) as Neytiri, a native with whom Sully falls in love. Sigourney Weaver also stars as Dr. Grace Augustine, one of the scientists testing the new avatar technology.

What I think Cameron did was to merge the stories of Tarzan and John Carter of Mars, and then give them a New Age, politically correct twist to cash in on the global warming frenzy. But Burroughs was anything but New Age and political. His novels are right at the center of the pulp fiction, action-adventure genre - full of violence and love-making - that early 20th Century American males ate up - which is the antithesis of what Cameron has come up with. Nevertheless, I like most aspects of Cameron's vision and how he has used the technology. The film has a wonder to it that one does not easily forget. PG-13

3934085,2,B002HEXVUI,"Be advised, Abrahamic themes discussed here.

Technicals aside, Avatar appears to be Cameron's take on how the biblical Book of Joshua might play out allegorically but reversed and depicted as science fiction. Imagine a fantasy where the alien, ""pagan"" enemies of some futuristic, space-faring ""Israel"" instead have the righteousness and might of the true deity on their side. In his cinematic brilliance, Cameron shows just how this futuristic ""Israel"" is brought to its knees by its would-be pagan targets. The humans are snarkily depicted as claiming the superior means and values, yet in this fantasy they are THE god-forsaken, rapacious foreigners - in the eyes of the pagans.

The blue Na'vi appear to represent a fantastic version of the ancient, partly-human Anakite giants (Anakite: long-neck) of the bibilical land of Canaan, metaphorically represented here by Pandora. Since the movie is from the traitor's and aliens' POV (Sully: ""Excuse me, this is my video log here!""), there is of course no attribution to any kind of divine hand behind this metaphorical Israelite army. OTOH, it is a force which does possess a thematic proxy for the power of the human's (Israel's) deity, in the form of unimaginable - in the eyes of the pagans - advantages in armaments, high technology, and organization. Not coincidentally, the human (Israeli) army is depicted transiting the wilderness of space from a blighted Earth (Egypt) while subsisting on in-flight rations (manna), bent on an overarching mission to seek their nation's survival and prosperity by winning the rights to the promised rock (land) of Pandora (Canaan). The idea of ""Israel"" as the divinely favored people is figured in the movie as humans aspiring to an ""Unobtanium"", a ""Rock"" no less, which in the end proves to be unobtainable due to enemy action. Which is precisely Cameron's point, and likely motivation.

After being forced to take a swim (biblical Jordan) by the nasty wildlife (biblical ""land swallows up people and things""), ex-Marine (Israelite warrior) Jake meets Na'vi princess Neytiri, a figurative stand-in for the ravishingly beautiful biblical Rahab. In this tale, Rahab's biblical character as fearful prostitute is uplifted into a stalwart and loyal Na'vi (biblical Canaanite) princess. Then Rahab's biblical role as the Israeli sympathizer who hid the two Israeli spies scouting Jericho is smartly reversed into a die-hard noble pagan defender and seducer. And so this version of Rahab also figuratively plays a secondary role as the infamous Moabite sex-princess who carries out the orders of the biblical Canaanite king Balak (paralleling the biblical advice of the pagan sorcerer Balaam not to confront Israel indirectly) to seduce an enemy Israeli warrior into betraying his own nation. Instead of getting speared in the act with said enemy (biblical Phinehas/Zimri incident) as in the original story, this revised Rahab-cum-sex-princess does get to turn the tables by spearing the enemy Colonel (biblical Joshua). A sneaky reversal of an Old Testament story marvelously retold from the Canaanite point of view.

Among other things, Pandora/Canaan's magical floating mountains stand for the biblical mountaintops from where biblical King Balak and Balaam attempted to hex their Israelite enemies. These figuratively stand for the high places in ancient times where Israelis would not only practice worship, but more importantly also seal holy covenants, or marriages between entities. The offsite Avatar link couch assigned to Sully is tellingly named ""Beulah"", which means ""Israel"" and/or ""married"" in Hebrew. Hebrew prophets were always warning Israelites against marrying gentiles or recognizing a marriage between YHWH and ancient pagan goddesses such as Asherah. In this reversal, an Israelite turns against his nation because he literally marries into a rival religion.

The age of the chief scientist Dr. Augustine and and her expertise in botany marks her character as figurative of the first biblical spy team tasked by Moses to scout Canaan's agriculture. Sully is buddied in a paired spy-team just as in the original story. We are not even touching on details about the ancient Canaanite mother goddess Asherah, associated with the living tree and fertility and child-sacrifice rites. Not to mention sex in the pagan commons-  were private quarters available to sexually-active pagans (Na'vi)? Or did they, like ancient OT pagans, implicitly practice sexual rites in those high places (floating mountains) safe from jungle predators?

Other reverses/parallels abound. The treasonous human science team almost directly parallels the biblical ten faithless spies of Moses's 12-man spy team, of whom only Joshua (figured by RDA Colonel Quaritch here) and Caleb proved strong and faithful (Colonel to initially-zealous Sully: ""I wish I had ten more like you""). Then there are the 12 human sectors which figuratively correspond to the biblical distribution of land among ancient Israel's twelve tribes. And there's marine (Israelite) warrior Jake Sully as a traitorous refiguring of the biblical Caleb who in this revision meets pagan Princess Neytiri (biblical Rahab) at Hometree (Jericho) which eventually falls to the circling human army (Walls and trumpets). Alien wildlife are seen communicating with the indigenes (Balaam's biblically hilarious donkey).

As for the biblical Ark which brought down Jericho's walls on the seventh run after circling the city 6 times, figuratively substitute Shuttle 1-6 and its humongous daisycutter bomb as proxy for the presence and power of the Hebrew deity. Watch as Cameron delightfully orchestrates the onscreen failure of the daisycutter/Ark to deliver the final providential blow, while the supposedly unaligned Eywa-mother-earth (Neytiri: ""Our Great Mother does not take sides Jake"") finally does the Abrahamic God divine intervention routine. It's pagan catnip, I tell you.

If today's neopagans could somehow revise the original OT story into a fantastical triumph for the Canaanites in place of their historical defeat and conquest by Israelites, this movie is their gift. It seems Cameron is Speaker-for-the-Dead of all vanquished pagans, voicing ghostly wishes from beyond the grave for what could have been but never was.

Excellent movie-making, though.

***

Further parallels discovered since:

In yet another direct OT parallel from the Deuteronomy book, an enemy of the Israel would be ""undercut"" with crippled legs. Jake Sully's role as crippled traitor-to-be is strongly predicted by this.

Also, go over the movie segment where the executive Parker (figurative high priest Eleazar) is looking at the imagery of Pandoran (figurative Canaan) sector 12. Twelve, which is metaphorical for the OT tribe of Benjamin from which the future hebrew messiah would descend - along with 11 of his apostles, added to which makes yet another metaphorical 12. Parker (figurative Eleazar) then revealingly/mockingly comments, ""Stop... Where .. Stop. Jesus... ...I mean, look at all that cheddar..."" Google hint: Cheesus

3934089,3,B002HEXVUI,"this is perhaps the strongest example of how the expert use of a medium (3D) can trick the viewer into believing they have just seen the best movie in the history of the human race. superb 3D rendering, awesome colors, extremely imaginative creatures and ecosystems manage successfully to hide the unoriginal plot and political agenda (yes, even a crippled war veteran who's a nobody back home, can become something if they dream hard enough).
the story borrows heavily from previous movies like many reviewers have already pointed out; Dances with wolves, Gattaca, and The last Samurai, being among the most glaring examples.
the concept is a worthy idea but it's old; it desperately calls for an innovative twist to differentiate itself from the established classics. it calls for the umpteenth time for the respect of the environment, its resources and its people but its narrative is just the same typical paint-by-numbers formula already experienced by every moviegoer. between 1997 and 2009, James Cameron had the ample time to figure it out. his technical approach (with 3D) is almost spotless and i give 2.5 stars for the movie's technical prowess alone.
but when you strip the 3D gloss away we're left with a very clich'd story. we've seen this before. only the format has changed.
that's why i don't feel this movie deserves the 5 star ratings a lot of reviewers are giving it.
concerning replay value, only time will tell, but IMHO i don't see myself going back to it because, 3D as a medium will evolve and 3 years from now we won't be impressed by avatar as we are now. so once the medium is taken to even higher levels of rendering, there won't be anything left in this movie to attract us. i'd play Costner's 'dance with the wolves' anytime instead of avatar because they roughly share the same concept, plus, Costner's movie showcases better acting.
last and not least, the soundtrack is too generic, its climaxing parts always predictable from a mile away and the celine dion closer was just too much for me to bear, however my rating doesnt touch on those aspects or else i'd be tempted to remove another star.
i recently went back and listened to the movie soundtrack and the closer theme song is by Leona Lewis and not Dion (my apologies); her singing style is much in the vein of celine dion but I digress; i still find the soundtrack lacking in drama and emotional delivery after a second listen.",1265587200,16,2418,4.7595238095238095

And then came Avatar.

Avatar is the project that Cameron has been trying to make his career. 12 years after Titanic, and who would have known he had topped the movie in every single way possible. I went to go see the movie in IMAX on opening weekend with my girlfriend- we got up super early and got to the theater at 9 AM. One interesting note is that there were people dressed as Na'Vi- we thought it was pretty funny and cool! As for the movie: was it worth the hype and the wait?

Definitely.

Of all films, James has followed his craft spectacularly with Avatar. Remember when we all saw Jurassic Park and were all blown away? Well this is that times a thousand. James creates a spectacular movie with beautiful visuals and a plot that pays homage to similar movies of this plot, like Dances With Wolves, The Matrix, and Pocahontas to name a few.

It is the near future. Jake Sully, a paraplegic soldier has awaken from 6 years in cryo. He is chosen to replace his recently deceased brother on a new mission: To travel to Pandora to wipe out the entire population: An alien type species called Na'vi. However, while there, he also discovers the joy of being a Na'vi through a technology that gives people Na'Vi bodies called ""Avatars"". While on a mission one day, he is saved by Neytiri, a Na'vi lady who leads him to the village she lives in. After some pretty bad first impressions, Jake begins to slowly assimilate, but finds himself torn between whether or not he should continue the mission or be a Na'vi.

This is an excellent movie. At 162 minutes it doesn't feel padded out or fleshed out. J-Cam takes an interesting concept, and crafts it beautifully here. Beautiful visuals, and a wonderful story are to be found here- the movie also compels you to question spirituality in a way you haven't before. The conflict between the Na'vi and Humans is stunning, the relationship between Jake and Neytiri is beautifully handled.

Also, like I said, James pays tribute to similar assimilation type movies. Influences from Dances With Wolves, The Last Samurai, Pocahontas and other movies are seen, and it's like when all combined together, they create a beautiful story. People have claimed it is a ripoff of all of those but I couldn't disagree more. Sure it's not the most original movie ever made, but then again what is? nowadays?

The only drawback for me is the Leona Lewis song at the end, but other than that, I enjoyed this movie a great deal.

Bottom line: James Cameron hasn't become a writer since doing ""Titanic."" That leads to the film's main shortcomings.

But it doesn't matter. This is such a breakthrough in film--in nearly erasing the boundary between live action and animation--that anyone who cares even a little about film must see it, and see it in a movie theater, and in 3D. I don't care if you mainly like sombre low-budget Sundance films or Swedish movies so depressing you want to step in front of a train afterwards. I don't care if you find most Hollywood films jejune, or whatever other artful adjectives you prefer. You still have to see this. You can't talk about cinema unless you do. Besides, it's an eyepopping, unforgettable experience.

Someone had described it as a film you have to have seen in order to be able to talk with anyone under 40. I suppose that's so, unless you have the sort of prosaic mind that can only relate to movies about people who look and act like you in places much like what we see around us.

I'm not sure it's a great movie. But it is great fun, as long as you don't think too much. And a bit moving, as long as you don't feel too much. And it redefines what you can put on a screen (if you've got his $300M budget)!

To me the most important aspect is facial animation. One of our group was underwhelmed by it--by how they'd been able to instrument the live actors' faces and transmit their expressions to the animated characters you see onscreen. Our friend had heard such glowing reports of it that perhaps he expected too much. He said he'd seen better facial expression animation in other films. But the rest of us thought it worked well and looked great. Perhaps it's that none of the actors were showing a lot of nuance--whether that's the acting, or the direction, or the limits of facial expression animation today, I don't know. But the animated characters definitely looked like the live actors.

In some ways it's like a cross between a traditional fantasy movie and a traditional science fiction movie, with a hint of sci-fi explanations for the sorts of things that are normally explained magically.

The forest scenes on the alien planet reminded me of the forest scenes in Hayao Miyazaki's great (non-computer) animated film ""Princess Mononoke."" If you haven't seen this film, I'd strongly recommend seeing it after you see Avatar.

The military scenes reminded me--less so--of ""Starship Troopers."" That, too, would be interesting to see after ""Avatar.""

I'm an educated layman when it comes to military technology, biology, exobiology, cinema, and Cameron's films--I've seen ""Abyss,"" ""Aliens,"" ""T1,"" ""T2"" & ""Titanic."" And enjoyed them all. I know what to expect from Cameron. Unfortunately, I know enough about those subjects to know when Cameron was going for an onscreen effect and defying logic and what we know about those subjects. I'm also a veteran scuba diver, and I saw where he borrowed from underwater scenes I'm familiar with. Only sometimes the transplant needed anti-rejection drugs so I'd stop thinking about how he was borrowing cool images without thinking through what kind of sense they might be making. Still, Cameron's better than George Lucas and many others in terms of borrowing images more than real ideas.

Yeah, I know I'm a voice in the wilderness on this subject.

My biggest complaint is the same one I have about most Hollywood sci-fi--more fi than sci, and not always understanding that a whisper can sometimes be more powerful than a shout. Cameron puts all the money onscreen.

And speaking of screens--we saw it in a big Imax theater, on the far side, about halfway back. This was because we got there half an hour before showtime. Mistake. It wasn't awful to see it to the side like that, but it was definitely suboptimal. You'd see this best in an Imax theater from the back row as near to the center as you can get. Everyone in the audience who wasn't near that spot got less for their money.

The 3D was very, very good. This was, as I recall, ""RealD"" or some such. It used inexpensive 3D glasses with what looked like mylar lenses. I had some annoying reflections from the bottoms of the big lenses, though they didn't directly interfere with the screen image.

Later I want to see it once more in 3D on a non-Imax screen. Again, not necessarily because it's better than lots of other films with more intelligent screenplays, more nuanced acting, etc.; but because I want to see this cutting edge cinematic technology at work on a wide screen in 3D--and with me sitting in the exact middle and pretty far back.

So did the animation look real, or did it still look like animation--especially in the scenese that combined animation with live action?

Close. Not quite. Not yet. But we're getting close.

You can read dozens of reviews of Avatar that tell a lot more about the story and whatnot than I did here. Avoid em until you've seen it. You'll enjoy this film more if its surprises actually surprise you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I just saw ""Avatar"" for the second time, under very different circumstances--nearly empty theater, on a conventional big screen instead of IMAX, using the Real3D system and glasses.
The theater being nearly empty, we got to sit it the right place this time. Huge difference being able to sit smack in the middle of the theater.

But also--I think I liked it better on a conventional wide screen than on IMAX. I can't say this for sure, since our seating was so crappy for the IMAX showing. We've seen other IMAX films, and always found that we only enjoyed the viewing if we were sitting in the back row in the middle, or nearby. This is a hard one to universalize, though. You may prefer the IMAX version. I will say they make for a distinctly different viewing experience, so you shouldn't just flip a coin. You'll probably prefer one over the other. Think it through.

As for Avatar itself--my spouse and I enjoyed it the second time around. The visuals are so spectacular, from the very first shot to the last, and so real-seeming, that they quite overcome the formulaic plot. As my Russian friend said, you could always tell what was coming.,

I told her that this isn't always bad, though. Some films are more like rituals, where unpredictability isn't what people are looking for. This is one of those films.

So don't let smartypants friends dissuade you from seeing it because they have objections to the screenplay. They're probably right, but if they weren't noticing what they were seeing in order to criticize the uncreative narrative--then they've got a real problem.

Some people regard works of art for what's missing. Someone wants said music lovers listen to music, while audiophiles listen to problems in microphone placement.

""Avatar"" has strengths and weaknesses. Most of the complaints about its weaknesses are probably true, but the strengths are so off-the-hook strong that they make it not just worthwhile but necessary to see the film, and see it in a theater, in 3D.

Speaking of which we saw it this time with the Real3D glasses. I wear eyeglasses, and these fit over them comfortably. I was happy with the 3D experience they provided.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What follows are some further comments that you should probably wait to read until you've seen the film, though it doesn't have plot spoilers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the storytelling risks Avatar could have taken:

None.

Unless Bill Gates whips out his checkbook, a $300M film must be a blockbuster to make a profit for all involved.

That's impossible for a film that just shows domestically. It has to be a world blockbuster. It has to be PG-13 for all those conservative countries, and it has to have an easy to follow good guys/bad guys plot for all those lower middle class moviegoers in Lahore and Belo Horizonte and, and, and.

Of course Princess Mononoke was vastly deeper. It could make a profit on domestic Japanese sales alone. Ditto various Japanese anime series.

Ditto, for example, the scariest, most morally complex vampire film ever, the Swedish shocker ""Let the right one in."" Which had virtually no special effects and no name stars...and which, I'm sure, could make a profit from domestic Swedish sales alone.

And ditto another film you could compare Avatar with, the Finnish/Russian collaboration ""Cuckoo.""

OTOH making the Na'vi look/act so much like us might have shown a lack of imagination or simply needing to make the film fly in the world market, but it made sense biologically. Actually I objected (on scientific grounds) to the Na'vi being as different from us as they were: erect bipedal hominids aren't going to have tails. Nor blue skin. And the huge yellow eyes--you'd see that in a nocturnal animal, while the Na'vi were diurnal. The hairy USB port thing was magic with a sci-fi gloss.

I say this because sci-fi fans generally suffer from what I call the ""Star Wars Cantina Syndrome."" They assume aliens will look/act alien unless proven otherwise, as in Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama, where everything to do with the aliens was at all times inexplicable.

But science has a great rule of thumb principle called the Assumption of Mediocrity: we assume what we see and know is par for the course unless proven otherwise.

Moreover, you can see the convergent evolutionary forces throughout nature--and I've seen nature at its wildest, most diverse and fanciful, because I'm a veteran scuba diver who has dived from Indonesia to Canada to the Caribbean. It all seems like a hurricane of life forms at first, but later you discover there's a reason for everything.

And erect bipedal hominid is the ticket for a dominant tool using terrestrial lifeform.

The hexapedal animals, pollen sucking horse equivalents and other stuff was a lot less likely. Didn't interfere with repaying that $300M investment, but it lessened my own buy-in. One of most powerful evolutionary forces we've seen is the one forcing down the leg count on terrestrial animals above the scale of one with an exoskeleton.

If you want to see a fairly recent sci-fi film with an actually interesting plot/characterizations/moral complexity, see ""Serenity.""

There's no use to watching Avatar and thinking about how it should have been adapted to the viewing desires of an educated minority. As others have said, just wait for the technology Cameron pioneered to become available at a lower cost.

Then it will get very exciting. But for now and forever, the most cutting edge huge-budget films will always be lowest common denominator crowd pleasers.

Except, of course, for ""2001."" I'm still amazed Kubrick was able to get that financed.",1265068800,2,10960,4.968835429196282
3934098,4,B002HEXVUI,"The visual effects and technology in this movie are stunning.  The 3-D is there, but never gets into your face.  It's the first movie I've seen in a long time that truly conveys a sense of wonder.  James Cameron can really direct and boy! can he put a movie together!  It is worth the price.  You simply must see this in a theater, preferably at an IMAX, but definitely in 3-D.  This movie is going to change the way movies are made, permanently, but will not survive the transition to Blu-Ray or DVD.  It won't be the same, and the magic will be gone without the 3-D and big screen experience , because...

James Cameron can direct brilliantly.  He can create stunning visual images.  He can deliver a fantastic movie, with all the money right up there on the screen.  What he couldn't do is write a whole new story all by himself.

This is a flawed masterpiece.  The story is eminently predictable, full of cliches and you've seen all this before. The incredible magic he's created will carry you 3/4 of the way though the film, and you'll still enjoy the rest in spite of the heavy-handed sermonizing, but essentially this movie is Dances with Wolves meets Apocalypse Now with a bit of Star Wars for seasoning (just substitute the words ""The Force"" for ""Eywa"").

Cameron says there will be a sequel.  I hope not, because by the time it comes out other films will have duplicated this technology, and it will have to survive on story, for which he'll need some really good writers.  Leave it where it is.

If course, maybe he could make it a really short sequel, which unfortunately could show the problem of relying on Eywa to save the day against greedy people who have the technology to travel faster than light.  The sequel could be based on a line from one of his other brilliant films.  All you'd have to do is pick up from the end of Avatar. The Earthmen are in the shuttle and the engines are winding up.  One of the bigwigs turns to another and says,

""I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure""",1264982400,2,2048,4.3936170212765955
3934099,2,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is the Matrix meets Pocahontas on the planet Endor with a GI Joe Corporate bad guy. The movie is an incongruous mixture of other films. The Matrix, Star Wars, other films borrowed ideas (e.g. Apocalypto), and maybe even GI Joe and Pocahontas - were novel when introduced. Here they are replayed to cover a nonsensical and incoherent story line. I broke out laughing during the movie over how sadly predictable is the story. I however could not have predicted the regular needless profanity, occult environmentalism, and the hero ""mating"" with a female who is engaged to the future chief. The graphics are magnificent. The acting is formulaic and stereotypical. For adults this movie is a waste of time and for children lessons in bad behavior.",1264982400,13,750,4.9603174603174605
3934100,5,B002HEXVUI,"This is the most beautiful-to-look-at movie I have ever seen.  The special effects are stupendous.  If you like breath-taking scenery with huge depth of field that goes on for miles, you'll love this movie.  The rain forest scenes are spectacular.  The detail is amazing.  For example, in the forest, there are all kinds of little insect-like creatures flying around in various directions, making it feel like you are watching a real living scene.  The delicateness of some of the plant life is so realistic, such as the tree-seed things floating around that resemble jelly fish.  The luminescent night scenes where the plant life gives off a fairy-like glow is so dream-like, they have to be seen to be truly appreciated.  In some scenes, the 3-D effect was so excellent that some of these floating luminescent things seemed to actually pass by my seat.

If there was a slight negative, it was the predictable storyline.  Despite that, it was very movingly portrayed.  You really felt for the tall blue natives fighting for their homeland.  The plot elements and action sequences reminded me of such movies as Broken Arrow, Zulu, Alien, Jurassic Park, and Starship Troopers.  The female lead, played by Zoe Saldana, makes this movie.  I think she is what made me give it that fifth star.  She should be nominated for an academy award.

I have a couple of nitpicks, but it should not be an excuse for not seeing the movie.  In one scene, there was a floating mountain with a waterfall.  The waterfall should have depleted the source of the water within an hour or so, even if the 150 foot wide mountain got rained on every day.  Perhaps we were seeing it during one of those several hours.  More importantly, the planet was so dangerous to live on (one clumsy move or lapse of attention would cost you your life), you wonder how the natives could survive.  One slip off the tree trunk, and you'd fall 500 feet to your death (everything is huge on this planet).  The place was crawling with vicious animal life intent on killing every living thing they came in contact with.  Concerning the plot climax, I knew it was coming, and it did:  the main bad guy and the main good guy duke it out in a battle near the end.  In movie after movie, you have ""casts of thousands"", yet somehow these two characters always manage to find each other on the battlefield.

My final assessment, despite a little weakness in the storyline, is this is a movie that should not be missed--a veritable smorgasbord for the aural and visual senses.  See it tomorrow!",1264896000,,2541,4.677200902934537
3934101,5,B002HEXVUI,"I came to this theater for the first time to see Avatar, also for the first time. The Buttkickers and the Tempurpedic seats were pleasant surprises and both added greatly to the theater experience. It was really amazing to feel the ground tremble violently while a helicopter was taking off, or when Jake high-dived into the base of a waterfall. Fantastic sound, massive screen, bright projection, and a movie so overwhelmingly beautiful it brought tears to my eyes. Definitely sit in the front half of the room towards the middle for a fully immersive view. For those who get cold easily, be forewarned; it did feel a bit drafty during the latter half of the movie.

For the first few scenes, while I was adjusting to the 3D glasses, I had serious double vision, especially in the corridor scene when Jake is first being retrieved from storage by technicians. I also observed some ghosting in the smaller objects floating through the foreground, like water droplets and flowers. However, the 3D effects worked flawlessly after the initial trial and error (with the 3D glasses on top of my own glasses), and after Avatar was done and the credits finished rolling, I walked away in a daze, reluctantly, as if I had left a higher grade of existence. As an aspiring artist, I get out of bed in the morning dissatisfied with my current goals--any thought of finding satisfaction in the mundane or mediocre has been utterly compromised in view of the outstanding craftsmanship on display in Pandora and among its inhabitants.

I have since watched every behind-the-scenes video I could find, including interviews with the special effects team, concept designers, environment painters, camera technicians, etc., and I submit that the closer you can get to stepping into the shoes of James Cameron and his crew, the greater your appreciation for the film will be. After seeing how eagerly the actors wanted to perfect their roles, and how disappointed they were when no more work was to be done, I could not help but feel envious of how fulfilling their work must have been--and Cameron's own work most of all. I am also in awe of the staggering number of technical obstacles that were overcome in the name of realizing Cameron's dream. Achieving this work of art is unthinkable at this height of excellence if not for one man at the helm whose determination, technical expertise, and relentless ingenuity are so strong that solving impossibilities is the order of the day. If you want further evidence, I recommend watching ""The Making of The Abyss.""

I am not one to nitpick the dialogue because in Avatar I believe the actions speak much louder than the words. I think the purpose of Avatar's dialogues is not so much to tell us the story as to provide a plausible context, so that during the most emotional scenes, the visuals, the sound effects, the score, and Jim's compositions can communicate with us using as little verbalization as possible--I think the emotional impact is more deep-seated this way, and exploits the greatest advantages available to the film-maker's craft. If one could watch the movie with the recordings of all conversations edited out, it would be interesting to see how well the story holds up. I would love to nitpick a number of things, but I'll need to watch the movie several times more before I do so. I will go so far to say that any review not based on IMAX 3D is not getting the intended experience.

Both the haunting beauty of the film and the achievement of it's creation stand as testaments to the electrifying ambition of Cameron, who not only shot for the stars, but succeeded beyond anyone's wildest imagination. Believe me, I think the theatrical release of Avatar is far from perfect, and yet--combined with a glimpse of how the film came to be--nothing in recent memory has pushed me to ask more of myself, has commanded more awe and humility, and for this, Avatar and its production deserve the greatest appreciation that I can muster. The most important thing I want to say about Avatar is that it is a blessing that this movie exists at all, and that the more I open my heart to what it offers, the more I find myself shedding tears about something in every scene.

To reiterate, my review is based on my first and only viewing of Avatar in IMAX 3D with Buttkickers, Tempurpedic seats, sitting in an ideal location in the theater, and having watched afterwards a large assortment of related reviews, interviews, b-rolls, behind-the-scenes footage, and having read the first half of the script and published interviews with the special effects artists.",1264896000,,4597,4.821292775665399
3934102,4,B002HEXVUI,"The graphics are brilliant, often I felt I was in the scene.

However, the story was bad and predictable. I could have left the picture half way through once the tree was destroyed and do not think I would have missed anything.

The characters were extremely stereotyped. Despite that Giovanni Ribisi, I thought did a very good performance. No-one else was any good, not that I blame the actors as the script was so bad.

This film is worth seeing only for the 3D graphics.",1264896000,2,473,4.541176470588235
3934103,5,B002HEXVUI,"I throughly enjoyed this 3d movie, the special effects are amazing, parts of the movie reminded me of other movies I had seen, the spiritual aspect reminds me of Starwars where Yoda explains to Luke that ""The Force"" is in the reeds, the trees,the rocks, all living things ""that life creates it"". In Avatar is exsists between all the living things, the trees, the creatures found on this planet and the indigenous natives. This race is primative no technology here, but seem to be happy as they know no other way. If they need to kill a living thing, they seem mindful of it's suffering and helping it's soul pass over to the after life. Then we have the greedy corporation with it's Army might, hell bent on getting what it wants and only making a faint hearted approach to negotiate with the natives. When they seem to be making some headway, greed steps in, and the way to get what they want now is by force, how ironic this is to the way we live on Earth. The movie does have a predictable ending with good prevailing over evil, but the true meaning in the film for me is that we never would have understood the indigeneous natives if their world had not been infiltrated by the Human/native clones, so for me the story is about understanding others,compassion,empathy and that the planet we live on is a living thing, that we need to respect and protect for future generations instead of living in the now, the question is what will we be leaving for our children and the future genarations?, if we have no respect for our planet and the technology we possess to save our planet, will we allow human greed to continue that seems to be hell bent on destroying this planet that we call home?, will the human race have a future here on earth?.",1264809600,,1744,4.470219435736677
3934104,3,B002HEXVUI,"Beware: This movie has fallen under fanboy syndrome.  This syndrome is typically characterized when grown men act like teenage girls over sci-fi/anime movies.  Unless you are male, probably 13-40 and spent a good deal of your life thinking of yourself as a nerd, you're probably going to be impressed by this movie, but will find it hard to relate to the fandom for it.

Here are some strengths:
1) It looks great.  I mean, it looks really, really great.  No doubt about that.  Waiting for the technology to come around paid off, it's fantastic to see.

2) The setting is well put together.  You can tell that Cameron did put a lot of work into the details of this planet, and it shows.

3) The characters are archetypes, but that's not unusual for Cameron.  He serves up predictable, yet reliable characters that function well within the story itself.

Here are the weaknesses:
1) The score.  You expect a movie like this one to have a memorable score that you just can't get out of your head.  The Dark Knight, couldn't get it out of my head.  LOTR, couldn't get it out of my head.  This score is a total phone in that sounds like a mix between Titanic and The Lion King.  It's not original at all.  During the movie, I kept waiting for Celine Dion to chime in, ""My heart will go on!""  I'm a huge music buff in movies, oftentimes it makes or breaks a movie and this broke the movie.  Cameron should have sent Horner back and said, ""Do it better.""

2) By coincidence, the other night, I watched Aliens and was surprised at how well it held up.  Sure, the effects aren't perfect, but to make up for it, Cameron just created other worldly suspense.  I was often amazed by Avatar, but never surprised.  I knew the big battle was coming.  I knew the blue people were gonna win.  I knew he was gonna get the girl.  I knew it all.  Part of the downside from this exceptional CGI is that there is literally nothing that cannot be created, nothing we cannot see, and thus there is very little to be imagined.  The movie lacked a certain mystery that some of Cameron's previous works exploited so well.

3) It's too long.  I don't care what anyone says, cutting 30 minutes from this movie bumps it from 3 to 4 stars.

4) The blue people sex was awkward and unnerving.  Call me close minded, but I thought it was stupid, and it looked terrible.  That whole section of the movie was unbearable.  It was terrible.  TERRIBLE.  A D- stretch during an otherwise decent flick.",1264809600,4,2461,4.427293064876958

""Avatar"" is James Cameron's $237 million parable on the evils of imperialism, corporatism and Manifest Destiny.

The time is 2154, the place an earthlike moon called Pandora, where an American company has set up a major mining operation to extract a precious mineral - presumably an energy source - from beneath the planetoid's lush, verdant surface.  The problem is that one of the richest veins lies directly under a massive tree that holds great spiritual significance for the indigenous folk who live there - a race of nine-foot-tall, blue-complexioned natives called the Na'vi who dwell in the forest, wield old-fashioned bows-and-arrows, fly around on giant pterodactyl-type birds, and have a strong pantheistic connection with the world around them.

As the story begins, it is clear that, thus far, the earthlings have had very limited success in winning over the Na'vi through such outreach efforts as building them schools and teaching them English.  Fortunately, a group of scientists have found a way to create facsimiles of the Na'vi - called Avatars - into which a human mind can be transported while the original body remains behind in a state of suspended animation.  Enter Jake Sully, a young marine who's lost the use of his legs in battle and now has been chosen to enter into an avatar so he can learn more about the Na'vi by living amongst them in the hopes of eventually winning them over to the Americans' side.  Unfortunately, not everyone is as concerned with making nice with the Na'vi as is Grace Augustine, the humanistic biologist who heads up the research, and Jake soon discovers that the more he comes to feel like a Na'vi himself, the more he is expected to spy on and then betray his new-found compatriots in the earthlings' cause.  Jake's gradual transition from cocky, human-centric warrior to nature-loving ersatz-alien provides the dramatic and thematic arc of the film.

The parallels between the conflict in ""Avatar"" and America's involvement in the Iraq war are never far from Cameron's mind and the movie suffers a bit for it (ironically, ""Avatar"" is a far more overtly political film than ""The Hurt Locker"" which is actually SET in  Iraq).  I suspect that, had he wanted to, Cameron could probably have gotten his point across without taking a narrative sledgehammer to the audience.  Heck, there's even a reference to ""shock and awe"" as the Americans gear up for battle, just in case you missed the inference.  That being said, ""Avatar"" is enough of a technical triumph to overcome its occasional heavy-handed polemical tendencies and to successfully take us to a place we've never been before.

Through the wizardry of computer-generated 3-D special effects, Cameron has created a magical world of shimmering forests, floating mountains, and strange and exotic flora and fauna - a place where love can convincingly flourish between creatures from alien worlds and alien species.  In fact, the romance between Jake and a female Na'vi who teaches him the ways of her people - an even more unlikely coupling than Rose and Jack in ""Titanic"" - has something of a ""New World"" quality about it.  And, indeed, Cameron's near-worshipful attitude towards nature here echoes Terrance Malick's work in that earlier film.  Actually, that seems a particularly appropriate reference point given that ""Avatar"" can easily be viewed as an allegory of the European white man's conquest of the American continent and the genocide perpetrated on the native population that played such a crucial role in bringing that outcome about.  The look of the movie is something akin to a John Howe painting done in bold florescent colors and placed under a black light.

Of the performers, it's frankly a little hard to evaluate fully Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana's work in this film since clearly much of what appears on screen is the product of CGI manipulation and enhancement.  But they're both certainly adequate to the task they`ve been called upon to fulfill, and Sigourney Weaver as Grace and Giovanni Ribisi as the corporate administrator for the mine - and the movie's arch villain - turn in genuinely powerful performances.  And once again, as with ""Titanic,"" James Horner provides a soaring power-ballad to help transition the audience out of the theater and back into the real world.

Almost inevitably, perhaps, ""Avatar"" is one of those movies wherein the storyline is bound to become at least partially subsumed by the special effects.  But, as he did with ""Titanic"" - though to a somewhat lesser extent in this case - Cameron proves that he is capable of finding that happy medium between the two sides better than most.",1264464000,3,4662,5.018158236057069
3934112,1,B002HEXVUI,"I am very, very disappointed with this movie. The way people talk, it was like this movie was going to change everything about movies. I guess in some ways it did, and in others it failed miserably.

Let me say I've been a big fan of James Cameron until his last few movies. I grew up in the 80's, and he did change film making in the 1980's. From Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, and Terminator 2. Those movies influenced many people and movies. Sadly the last three films True Lies, Titanic and Avatar have failed or maybe succeeded. I guess it depends on your point of view. What is more important to you a good story and great acting or amazing visuals/action that will blow you away, because that will blow you away. If you are looking for the latter than this is the movie for your.

I don't know what's wrong with Cameron, maybe it's the writers he has but I believe he wrote the story for all his movies. The early ones from Terminator to Terminator 2 all had interesting stories and characters and were able to blend it together with great visuals. So I don't know what's wrong with him, except maybe he's lost his touch.

Oh yes the review for the movie.

First of the good: Simply the visuals/action, it was absolutely amazing. The world and life he created is stunning. Do I think he will change film making with what he's done with this heck yes. The world comes alive and you feel it. Sadly that's the only thing alive in this movie and leaves me thinking what could have been.

Now for the bad:

Story: It's absolutely terrible. It's essentially what we(The Europeans) did to the native Americans of North and South America. This story has been done many times over and much, much better. Also the anti-American/imperialism is rampant through this movie. I can understand if Cameron wanted to make some kind of statement, he just should have done a better job of it.

Characters: Thanks to the left-wing story, the characters are cardboard cut outs and uninteresting. From the company man who only cares about the making money and nothing else. The evil colonel who thinks the indigenous population are nothing but savages and hold no value. To the stereotypical Indians(The Na'vi). I mean some on it is down right laughable. The only characters that interested me were Trudy(Michelle Rodriguez) and Grace(Sigourney Weaver), but they were stuck to the back ground.

So overall if you enjoy nothing but great action/visuals/special effects this movie is for you, but if you also enjoy a good story and interesting characters this movie isn't for you and will leave you disappointed.

It left me wondering what could have been. What if this movie had a decent story interesting characters and good directing. Than I truly believe this movie would have been one for the ages and people would be talking about decades from now.",1264377600,32,2836,4.678714859437751
3934113,3,B002HEXVUI,"I'll admit that I was expecting a lot from this movie. I had heard about the huge budget and effort required to create it and had heard that it was a landmark movie that was going to take the movie business to a new level. I didn't like the movie at all. It was a trite straightforward drama with colorless characters, recycled elements, WOW factors we've seen before and a weak ""showdown"" climax.

Ground breaking CGI: Big deal. I don't know about 10 year old kids, but I've seen so much CGI, for so long, that it's simply boring. Yes the glowing flowers and such were beautiful (even if the dandelion seeds were overused), but so what? Movies are best about things in our real world, like courage, loyalty and friendship. Glowing flowers are nice but can't carry a movie.

Too many recycled elements from Aliens, Terminator, Star Wars, and Transformers: Weaver, cybersleep, the loaders, the veloci-copters, the gunship, the flight deck, the pilot, the sarge, the combat drop, the walkers (Star Wars). Even the guy that can't walk now being able to walk is from ""Lost.""

Trite, straightforward and pretty ham-handed drama of the military guy against the ethical soldier against the scientists against the natives...Universal Soldier (Van Damme), Soldier (Kurt Russell).

Avatar concept is old, and even more so now that that concept is recycled into the virtual reality gimmick: Sargon controlling Kirk, Kirk exchanging minds with that crazy lady that wanted to be Captain, Spock's Brain (where his body was controlled by a remote control), The Matrix.

Weaver's character was a waste - she did not play a big part in the story and the part that she did play was sketchy. Weaver had been there how many years? Teaching them English? And she's still there leading the team even though the military is there moving? And the natives still accept her? Weaver is all hostile to the new guy right up until she puts him in the mind link chamber. Then they meet up on the other side and she's all smiles and charm towards him. Huh?

The climactic battle was a lot like the Ewoks against the Empire in ""Return of the Jedi,"" right down to the grenades in the engines.

The big revelation in the movie of the neural network of the trees fell totally flat. That was supposed to be a big dramatic moment but I think everyone in the audience, just like those on the command deck were like: ""So what? Is that supposed to mean something?"" There was only a few lines in the movie that supported that plot line and after the big revelation it was pretty much dropped.

Characters were not colorful and well differentiated like in Aliens (All the characters were colorless: The wheelchair guy, his buddy, Weaver, the traitorous pilot, the native mother and father had extremely small parts, the native prince was colorless, even the princess was pretty colorless, the pencil pusher heartless bureaucrat, the Colonel was the only character that was almost good), there was no sparkling dialog like all throughout Aliens.

It seems that some of the ""Wow factor"" of the movie was contained in the computer displays in the lab, especially the ones that could be swiped off the wall and onto a tablet PC. If they thought that would impress me....oh please. Spielberg already tried all that exact same stuff in ""Minority Report"" to equally unimpressive results and Cameron, of all people, should know that no matter how impressive your production is, it's useless without a great drama with all of the elements needed to make drama great.",1264377600,7,3514,4.785478547854786

In the end I came away disappointed I wanted to be entertained instead I sat through a sermon, I wanted to me mentally challenged instead I had a highly formulaic movie that held no surprises. This movie could have been so much more.

3934117,5,B002HEXVUI,"While its initial previews made it look like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FernGully/dp/B000A9QK78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FernGully</a>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dances-with-Wolves/dp/B00008PBZZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dances with Wolves</a>&nbsp;with extra-large Smurfs in action, you can rest assured that James Cameron's epic return to the game, ""Avatar,"" is more than meets the eye. With twelve years gone by since the director's previous record smashing film, it's safe to say that his absence has been felt. There are very few directors who throw themselves into their work like Cameron does, and more often than not, his films are not only hits, but cinematic landmarks. Like his special effects break-through in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-2-Judgment-Day/dp/B001VLBDD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 2 - Judgment Day</a>&nbsp;and the massive scope and success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titanic/dp/B00000JLWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titanic</a>, ""Avatar"" is yet another benchmark film.

All the work Cameron put into ""Avatar"" (which has been on the back-burner since the mid-90's) has no doubt paid off, and if its box office receipts are any indication, this is a movie that is not soon to be forgotten, and is one for the ages that will be appreciated by generation after generation. Yeah, it's that good. If this generation has a ""Star Wars,"" then this, my friends, is it. Its visual effects are absolutely stunning and combined with the unique 3D presentation creates a world that you can truly disappear into. At times, you will forget you are watching a movie. You'll feel like you're in the jungle and you'll feel like you're a part of the battle. It's the little the things and the attention to detail that make the film so sweet. James Cameron is a perfectionist, and not for one moment does he let the 3D element of this film go to waste. It's less of a gimmick here and more of a device to transport you into the near-perfect world he has created.

While the plot itself isn't ground-breaking material - the man vs. nature thing has been done to death - it is presented in a way that manages to entertain and stimulate the senses while not beating you over the head with its message. It helps, too, that the pacing is smooth and the plot never sags. At about two hours and forty-five minutes long, you never feel the urge to look at the time or think of anything else (especially if you are seeing it in its best element - an IMAX theater). As far as the action sequences go, fans who have been craving a dose of the good stuff since ""Terminator 2"" hit theaters back in 1991 will feel more than satisfied, even if the bulk of it is saved for the final act.

 If there are any flaws to be found, it is in the character department. While some are well-fleshed out and as three-dimensional as the film itself (Worthington, who also starred in the Cameron-less&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-Salvation/dp/B001FB55HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator Salvation</a>&nbsp;gives a strong and sympathetic performance) there are a few that seem to fall by the wayside. Take the characters played by Joel David Moore (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hatchet/dp/B000WC389G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hatchet</a>) and Michelle Rodriguez (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fast-and-the-Furious/dp/B00005R87Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fast and the Furious</a>). Both characters fade in and out of the plot, and there are moments where you aren't sure where they stand. I suspect this is a case of the film being edited down to fit a fair time slot (although it could have been longer and not worn out its welcome) and there are some character moments that will be restored in a future ""Director's Cut"" of the film.

All in all, ""Avatar"" is a simply awesome cinematic experience. There have been few films to succeed with such broad goals, and yet, Cameron has managed to come back after many had either written him off or assumed he was done, and changed the game completely. Yes, it's hard to swallow all the hype that has accompanied this project, but if ever there was a film so deserving, it is this. If movies are meant to take you away to a different world to escape reality for a few hours, then ""Avatar"" more than does its job. Experience it now, while it's still in theaters. This deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible, and is a film you won't want to hold out for on DVD.",1264291200,10,4771,5.761702127659574
3934118,5,B002HEXVUI,"In interviews James Cameron gave on 60 Mins and Charley Rose prior to release, he discussed that his concept was to give a good story with many common themes (including fantasy and wonder of a new world, romance, war, religion, good vs evil, and the ecological tug of war between protection and use of resources) with a focus on new 3D technology that he worked with Sony and Panasonic to develop specifically for this production (thus the 10 yr time period) that would allow the artists to create a truly 'new world', with a good basic ""story and plot"" that he hoped would not only be entertaining but would cause people to think.  Cameron also noted in one of his discussions that they had much more they could have included in the way of story but that they were limited on time, in part because they did not know if the 3-D would be too fatiguing for the eyes, and he did not underestimate the ability of viewers to complete any missing story lines for character development.

I'll tell you what ""theme"" ideas entered my mind during my viewing experiences  (yes, we've seen it more than once and may go again! A first for us) that fleshed out the story more for me.

1) Predictable space adventure where humankind has screwed up earth to the point that they want to or must leave it and exploit other worlds.  Unfortunately a truth that we keep seeing over and over again on this planet.  Some call it exploitation, some capitalism at its worst, some just greed, while others call it ""utilization"" of the land for what humankind needs to exist, even a God Given Right.  This a topic for discussion.  Anyone thinking about that?

2) If a corporation is involved in a movie, it is likely evil, or at least focused only upon what 'it' sees as its sole purpose...  maintain a good image so as not to piss-off the greater public and keep the shareholders happy by making ever more money.  Anyone thinking about ways to make corporations more humane and earth/human friendly?  Is there a way as stockholders that we can influence the way our world is exploited/used?

3) The military tension is portrayed in this case as a corporate mercenary force mostly/partially made up of EX-military, it doesn't really say.  The bearing upon current events is right on!  The ""Military Force"" in this movie is NOT, repeat NOT military!  It evokes Blackwater (now Xe Services) among other corporate mercenaries, and fit the bill like few other movies of late.  This was a slap NOT at members of our military, but at those individuals and mercenary businesses who employ individuals trained by the military at taxpayer expense to do the bidding FOR PROFIT of whomever is paying them.  It is an expansion of, and additional warning of, Pres. Dwight Eisenhower's warning of the ""Military Industrial Complex"" and the road it can take us down.

4) Ah yes, the romance.  Always a nice ploy when members of different races or communities can cross the barrier and love.  Yes, all too typical in these stories, but hey, it is a nice dream that, if universally held, could help deter strife.  And anyway, I'm a hopeless romantic; so for the like-minded this is a nice touch and I had no problem falling into it!

5) Resources/land/water first, indigenous peoples and critters unneeded and relatively worthless.  My first thought here was, wow, how our Native Peoples could have used their own ""Jake Sully"" to help them keep their lands when our forefathers invaded.  I watched this thinking that, were I of Native heritage, would likely be thinking, Damn, where was OUR Jake Sully?!  Yes, this again is a story of repetition, not just in the Americas, but all over the world and for thousands of years, it is part of human history.  This is a story that can be found in so many cultures, of peoples longing for a ""savior"" to deliver them from invaders or oppressors.  Side note:  To those few 'out there' who had to whine about a 'racial slur' because a 'white guy' comes to save the day of the ""poor oppressed/indigenous peoples"", give it a rest!  Could have put anyone in the Jake Sully character and he/she would have been of a different 'race' from the indigenous Na'vi!  I don't hear a lot of whining about it being a man and not a woman, or any other segment of the human population!

6) Spirituality.  Some find this icky unless it is their own ""brand"".  Many don't like the I for one really loved the ""Oneness"" being parlayed here.  There are cultures on our planet  that people lead by the 'great religions' have tried to eradicate, relegating their spirituality to paganism and mythology, but there is a beauty of Oneness portrayed here that would do us all good to try to grasp.

7) Action, Action .. and Killing.  But, with a nice nod to some of our Native American (or First Nations in Canada), there is a nice showing of respect for all life in general, even in the hunting for food.  Idea here is we don't NEED to kill, we don't NEED to destroy life unless we take it for good reason.  Ah, but there is a thought to keep you going awhile ... who defines ""Good Reason""?!  All you 1-3 star folks should spend some time pondering that, as Cameron would like us to do so we can all discuss it.

8) Beauty!  Wow what artwork.  I know we've all likely seen many aspects of this 'world'before (I can't recall where), but if so, dynamically brought together.  Any of this that was 'borrowed', read inspired, buy other artists, this should serve as a major complement. This was a world, Pandora, that I would dream to travel to.  What natural dream scapes!

9) Special effects, OMG!!  Now, my wife and I rate movies as potentially extremely good and worth a ticket to a theater; worth buying in Blue Ray; just a renter, or not worth the $1-3 to rent.  Most fall into the last category, many into the renter, a very few into the purchase group and we can count on our hands the ones we have gone to in the last 10 years.  We seldom even consider going to the theater (much less more than once to the same movie) because we have a 7.1 sound system superior to any of our theaters and our Sony XBR LCD provides a picture better than the theaters.  But the 3D prospect, as well as subject, sucked us in and it was SO, so worth it!  And the animation of the critters and the plants and bugs just gets better.  But the emotion conveyed by the faces and movement of ""characters"" of the Na'vi is a fantastic technical achievement that comes home.

This new 3-D technology is a new breath of air for theater movies.  The Buddy Holly glasses are a bit much, especially over my own frames, but hey, I've been so bummed ever since Cinerama, CinemaScope and Panavision died years ago (yes, I'm in my 50's for those who have to look those terms up) it is nice to see something truly amazing at the theater! Now if they can just get good sound systems and train the operators how to run a high fidelity surround system so it doesn't sound like the sub in their car is rattling the trunk lid and doors!

Now, could the characters be a bit more fleshed out?  Could Jake, especially as the Na'vi, have been a bit more mature? Could the dialog have been more mature and less influenced by cliche?  Sure, you bet to all.  Missing aspects that would have made it a more complete movie.  Is it filled with re-tellings of many themes?  Sure, but how many movies are not?  Does it call out many of the really bad aspects of human nature?  Yes, like many good stories, movies, plays ... gives us something to work on.  Does it also suggest we have many redeeming qualities?  Yes - ability to love, to be empathetic to be open to change and 'new ways' and to love. Does it lean heavily on ""Natural Spirituality""?  You bet, unabashedly.  Spirituality and connectivity with the natural world is far older than any of the worlds religions and is a basis of some.  But all this aside, this movie was intended primarily to be vivid and exciting entertainment with a smattering of thought provocation that would be accessible to most viewers.  I think it more than succeeds on all accounts!",1264291200,127,8040,4.5246015246015245

It's not just me who thinks this: some wag has cataloged online somewhere all the ways that James Cameron has plagiarised himself!

Without a doubt, Avatar is a technological triumph - this is CGI well beyond anything you've ever seen before: it's graceful, beautiful, day-glo and heart stopping, though proud: you wouldn't say James Cameron wore his technical ability demurely - if he did, this film would be at least an hour shorter. There is a *lot* of gee-whiz-for-the-sake-of-it show-offery. It makes, at nearly three hours, for a challenging experience for those of a delicate backside.

A pity, then, that seeing so much care and attention was rendered to visuals, so little was apparently given to plot, screenplay and dialogue and character development: for its plotular similarities, Avatar is even cornier than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Independence-Day/dp/B00005V9IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Independence Day</a>&nbsp;- yes, and that is saying something - its characters are wafer thin, there is none of George Lucas' or Peter Jackson's sly humour the dialogue hackneyed, and the underpinning morality is preacherous and hokey. Some right-on liberal Hollywood digs at the war on terror were intended to lend gravitas: they fail.

As with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titanic/dp/B000VS6R26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titanic</a>, Cameron has on his hands a certified box office bunker buster: a pity he wasn't more energetic in his dramatic ambitions. You'd think a man with Cameron's reputation in Hollywood didn't need to aim so relentlessly for the lowest common denominator. (Compare this with The Lovely Bones, a far more ambitious project from similarly feted Peter Jackson).

In short, this film looks a billion dollars - and probably was - but it's all mouth, no trousers.

3934120,3,B002HEXVUI,"""King Kong"" is one of my favourite movies.  Always has been, always will be.  I love all three Kong's, each for different reasons, but for the purpose of this review I'll be citing the 1970's version with Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges.  I was but a young tyke of nine when my dear uncle took me to ""Kong,"" the big Christmas movie of 1976, and I was completely blown away!  I was captivated by the then-state-of-the-art special effects, of course, but I was genuinely moved by the story as well.  ""Kong '76"" was also the film that made me a movie fan for life; for the first time I took notice of how a movie's musical score could literally transport me into the world unreeling before my eyes and how a powerful film score could evoke vivid and magical memories of a movie long after the lights have come up.  And yet, while many others shared my love for the film at the time, history records that the ""'76 Kong"" was a box-office bust and a critical disaster.  Neither of which is true, of course, since the film was one of the biggest hits of the Seventies and was lauded by such noteworthy critics as Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert, but history, like beauty, like art, is largely a matter of perception, and PERCEPTION IS EVERYTHING.

So what does a harshly ridiculed,  perpetually perceived ""bomb"" such as "" King Kong '76"" have to do with the movie that's soon to overtake ""Titanic"" as the biggest box-office smash of all-time?  Well, James Cameron and 20th Century Fox spent a rumoured $500-million bringing ""Avatar"" to the screen, but apparently that wasn't enough, since two key battle scenes feature sound effects that are instantly recognizable from the much-maligned 70's version of ""Kong!"" Every time I heard Kong wail in AVATAR I cracked up, but I also took a measure of satisfaction that the ""King of the World!"" movie director was acknowledging one of my most treasured movie touchstones.

For all its technical brilliance, ""Avatar"" ultimately loses points for Cameron's most glaring weaknesses as a filmmaker: his reliance on stock characters and clunky dialogue to tell a story.  There are moments of great beauty in ""Avatar,"" but the cliches begin to pile up, especially during the final act, which plays like the climactic confrontation from Cameron's ""Aliens""  on steroids.  Apparently, the one thing $500-million CAN'T buy is originality.

If a director of Cameron's celebrated stature is going to pay homage to  John Guillermin's version of ""Kong"" then it may be time to re-evaluate the merits of the '76 monster hit and celebrate the movie magic conjured all those years ago.

3934121,5,B002HEXVUI,"I'm in my sixties and have well over 3,000 titles in my collection.  Avatar instantly became my lifetime favorite and I consider it to be the 'perfect' movie.

The plot is an update of the treatment of Native Americans by the white man.  The Na'vi are very similar to our Western Plains Indians in several ways; culture, love of the land, horsemanship, connection to their environment, etc.  The humans use any lame excuse to run them off, steal their land, destroy their environment and kill them, all for the land and what's in it.

The film could have stood on special effects alone but choose to have a deep heart wrenching tale of a peoples' survival.

About those special effects.  WOW!  Wow to infinity.  It's like an entire generation of CGI was skipped.  But beyond that, the art of the effects set a new standard that I honestly feel will never be surpassed.  It was beautiful past all possible description... so I won't try.  Suffice it to say, it brought tears to my eyes and took my breath away (and that ain't easy).

MOST IMPORTANTLY, you MUST see this, at least once, in Imax 3D.  You 'become one with the force'... no, wrong flick... you slip into the world of the film... a world you may not wish to leave.

I can understand the so called Avatar Depression Syndrome that has been discussed.  It is said that people become depressed because they can't remain part of the Na'vi world.  I can see that, but I also see a source of depression in the totally believably commentary on the selfishness, greed and self righteousness of humankind.  It demonstrates that even after we rape and destroy our own world we are likely to do it again to someone else's world.

I never, ever have commented on the reviews of others, but anyone who pans this masterpiece is an idiot.",1264204800,5,1782,4.564668769716088

And then towards the end of the movie, the main character became the only person who could master the biggest and strongest flying creature.  Why him?  He is just in that jungle for such a short time, yet he has to be the best.  It feels too much like he just have to be the best.

And what's more, why does the main character always have to go to the other tribe and make baby with the most desirable woman of that other tribe?

3934124,5,B002HEXVUI,"Cameron's big theme is mortality and how to make our lives meaningful.  In the Terminator films he situates this theme in the relationship of man and machine.  In Titanic, he invests the machine with the dreams (and weaknesses) of man.  And now, in Avatar, he finds a new way of developing this theme:  the Avatars themselves are a hybrid of the the living and the (bio) mechanical.

A lot of people complain that the story line here feels too familiar.  So what?  Shakespeare recycled old plots.  Most westerners/police thrillers, etc do the same.  The point of the plot is to give a framework to the filmmaker in which to work his magic.

And, in Avatar, Cameron delivers some of the most extraordinary magic ever seen on this planet.  And though the world he shows us is alien, he shows it to us always with the aim of making us see our own world-- and our own flaws as a species-- more clearly.

Some have complained about the film's supposed critique of America.  Those people probably are the shallow and corrupted souls who have warped our country away from its best instincts.  What does environmental destruction, greed, and imperialism have to do with the dreams of the founding father's anyway?  And what kind of American would defend the destruction of the planet?  These knee-jerk reactions against the film are merely expressions of the depraved mindset of a certain paranoid sector of the right wing which has been getting a lot of attention lately but whose attacks of progressive ideas-- and science itself-- really only represent the ever present existence of barbarians in every society since the dawn of man.  Sarah Palin's recent comment that ""it's arrogant for man to think he can influence nature"" is one of the dumbest things ever uttered by an animal with two legs.  (No, I don't think she's human. I think she's an Avatar herself: of the devil.)

Avatar dreams of a utopia which defeats these barbarians-- and their political front men forever.  Cameron has made the sci-fi dream which best represents the hopeful side of man.  All of us are lucky to be able to see a blockbuster as sincere, idealistic, imaginative, and brave as the film James Cameron has given us.",1264032000,2,2192,4.7612732095490715

""Avatar"" is groundbreaking as far as special effects go. Cameron's enormous performance-capture stage, the Volume, dwarfs anything Weta Digital has ever used before, and the system used for facial rendering is another level above what was used for the PS3 games ""Heavenly Sword"" and ""Enslaved: Odyssey to the West"", both of which are as beautifully rendered as this film.

Avatar is living, breathing art: every frame is filled with eye-popping colors and effects unlike anything ever seen on the big screen before, or since. Cameron once mentioned in an interview that Pandora was inspired by these ""phantasmagorical"" dreams he once had, and boy howdy, do they look it. The plants and animals look as though they were dredged up from the bottom of the sea and given legs and lungs, and due to the bioluminescence most look like they were crossbred with jellyfish sometime in the past. If the film is viewed as art and not for the done-to-death predictable story, ""Avatar"" certainly surpasses anything ever seen before or since, as I have said.

The plot is minimalistic at best, but the script is very well done. Each character sounds and acts unique, with performances by the actors executed with great skill. Without actors and actresses this talented, the film would really be a lot more boring. Cameron shows off his legendary humorous one-liners and love for big battle scenes, as well as his skill with emotion. Whether or not one believes that the film is manipulative, there is no denying that it manages to pull on the proverbial heartstrings at times.

""Avatar"" probably belongs as more of an art house film than a winter blockbuster, but as it stands, it is certainly setting the bar for upcoming so-called ""winter blockbusters"". The next big-budget winter blockbuster, as it looks now, is ""Tron Legacy""; now we will wait and see if the trend continues.

""Avatar"" is best seen on the big screen in 3D, but with an HD TV and Blu-ray, the overall effect dissipates only a little. Don't even bother getting the 3D version next year - even if polarized lenses or Dolby 3D technology replaces those heavy, headache-inducing LCD shutter glasses, ""Avatar"" is best seen in true high definition with the highest possible refresh rate. It's a true masterpiece of digital art that, although becoming quickly forgotten, will remain on the ""most influential for CGI technology"" list for a while.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: January 20, 2010

Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a parapalegic Marine, is sent to Pandora to replace his twin brother in the AVTR program. Through the program, he is allowed to take control of his deceased brother's avatar, a hybrid of human and native Na'vi DNA, giving him back control of his legs and freedom to roam the exotic vistas of the moon. At first his mission is to protect the scientists attempting to reestablish good relations with the ten-foot-tall blue natives of Pandora. However, he is separated from the group and brought to the Omaticaya, a clan of the Na'vi, and immersed in their culture. Over time, he comes to love their mother goddess Eywa and enjoy their peaceful existence... until that existence is threatened by the RDA Corporation, their military force led by Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang). Jake must now choose between his love for the beautiful Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and the Na'vi, or the humans, who only want Pandora for its valuable Unobtanium.

The visuals are stunning. James Cameron managed to avoid the ""uncanny valley"" normally associated with CGI humanoids, and you feel for the characters... to a point. The semblance to any actual, thought-provoking storytelling, unfortunately, ends here.

Traditional storytelling points (script, character depth and development, and so forth) all fall flat on their faces. Although the actors put on a fantastic show, the lack of actual conflict in the story makes it hard to connect to them. The visuals alone will have you mesmorized for weeks, but once the sparkle wears off, what's left for a film? Well, like with Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, the characters and conflict still snag you. With ""Avatar"", much of that is quickly lost. There's very little conflict in the long run. Sure, there's the conflict between the Na'vi and the RDA at the climax of the film, but that's about it.

Jake never has to sacrifice or give up anything to live the rest of his life in his Na'vi body on Pandora. Sure, he must ""choose"" between the one-dimensional, greedy humans or the peace-loving Na'vi, but there's nothing else to add to the conflict. He gets to walk and run, breathe fresh air, and live simply, all without a sense of remorse for what he has done. He saved a moon, only to condemn Earth, which is in the middle of a crisis and needs the rare Unobtanium to save itself. Does he regret his choice? Never. In fact, both times I went to see the film, I found it highly disturbing that he was mowing down humans left and right without regret. No regret for betraying his species. No regret for condemning his homeworld. Worse yet, we get no exploration, not even exposition, of Jake's brother. What was he like? Did Jake even miss him, or barely know him, or what? Minor details like this can put a twist on even the oldest story.

We aren't given a chance to feel any sympathy for the humans: they're portrayed as greedy, one-dimensional cardboard cutouts. Why is Quaritch the way he is - cold, calculating, and thirsty for Na'vi blood? No reasons are given. Earth's plight? We never hear about it. The dark side of any sentient being's nature? Nope, the Na'vi remain ""noble savages"" throughout. Jake getting any character development, losing anything important, going through grief, being at all disturbed, anything like that? Not a hint. We never see his Marine side explored.

This film had so much potential, but beyond the beautiful and eye-filling visuals, the film simply falls into another cliche storm. The two stars are for the visuals and Zoe's performance as Neytiri; the other three stars have been shaved off for simple storytelling that could have been built on so much more.",1263945600,17,6127,4.891136801541426
3934126,3,B002HEXVUI,"I saw James Cameron's ""Avatar"" on its opening weekend.  With all of the hype surrounding the film I expected it to be either A) one of the greatest films ever made or B) just another visual feast with a hollow plot.  It turns out that it was actually a visual feast with a plot stuffed to the brink with borrowed ideas from other films including many of Cameron's own previous projects.

The film's basic plot is that a human mining company has arrived on Pandora, home to the Na'vi, in order to mine unobtanium, an extremely valuable mineral.  The head of the mining operation, Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), has determined that the blue-skinned Na'vi must move in order for mining of Pandora to continue.  However, the Na'vi have no plans to leave the sacred forest in which they live.  In order to appease the Na'vi and attempt to persuade them to leave peacefully, the Avatar program is established.  This program uses genetically engineered human/Na'vi beings that can be remotely controlled by a mental link established with a human host.

Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), is a paraplegic Marine who is brought into the Avatar program when his twin brother dies and a genetic match is needed for his avatar.  Despite resistance from the program's director, Dr. Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), Jake is allowed take his brother's place.  While on a mission, Jake is separated from the rest of the team he is on and must fend for himself in the very deadly and very beautiful jungles of Pandora.

The mining company, meanwhile, has grown tired of the peaceful attempts to move the Na'vi.  Under Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang), a massive force is built up to physically and/or fatally remove the Na'vi from their homes.

While lost in the jungle, Jake befriends Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a Na'vi princess.  Eventually, Jake befriends Neytiri and a bond begins to form between him and the rest of the Na'vi.

Quaritch sees Sully's friendship with the Na'vi as a way to learn of their weaknesses in order to make a military strike successful.  At this point, Sully becomes a double-agent for the military and the Avatar program.  He also begins to fall in love with Neytiri and her people.  Soon enough, Jake finds himself torn between the people he has learned to love and the military that he was once part of.  His ultimate decision might prove fatal not only for himself, but the Na'vi as well.

Of course, that's the plot on the surface.  If one reads any other reviews or watches anything about ""Avatar"" on television, they will soon find people arguing that the film is everything from a ""white guilt fantasy"" to an anti-military rant to an environmentalist's plea and beyond.  While I can see sound reasoning for most of these arguments and do agree with some of them to a point, I have to call this film out for what it really is:  deja vu.

If you've watched films like ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Pocahontas,"" you've seen the plot before.  Basically ""Avatar"" is exactly like any film that's ever been made that involves one particular species, race, religious group, etc. attempting to invade another group's lands in order to use it for their own gain and one member of the invading party has a change of heart and becomes the victim's champion.

The only thing that sets this film apart is the fact that it has brilliant special effects and gorgeous visuals.  With that said, though, the Matt Leblanc clunker ""Lost In Space"" also had brilliant special effects and gorgeous visuals as did the three ""Star Wars"" prequels.  My point here is that you no matter how pretty a film might look, it doesn't mean that the actual story is worth watching.

I believe that Cameron became too caught up in wowing the audience with the film's look and allowed the plot to fall to the wayside.  With each scene in the first two hours of the film, I could almost hear Cameron saying, ""Look what I can do!"" as jellyfish-like creatures and tall blue people ran all over the screen.

The acting in the film was okay.  I preferred the avatar version of Jake Sully much more than his human counterpart.  Stephen Lang chewed his way through the film as Quaritch. His character reminded me of a number of R. Lee Armey's military performances but was not as fun to watch.  While I liked Zoe Saldana's portrayal of Neytiri, I felt that the animated character actually hindered her overall performance.  Sigourney Weaver stood out from the pack with her portrayal of Augustine.  Another actress who I feel hasn't received enough recognition for her role in this film is Michelle Rodriguez as Trudy Chacon.  In a film full of stock characters, hers was actually fun to watch.

I do believe that as time passes and the wow factor wears off, this film will be remembered only for its advances in special effects and not much else.  I do recommend watching it at least once, but that should suffice.  As far as all of the political, environmental, religious aspects that many see in this film, I'll leave those subjects to the indiviual viewers.  The film was a bit preachy as far as environmental activism is concerned in my book and it was also an unfriendly reminder of what was done to the American Indians early in our country's history.  However, I must applaud Cameron for not trying to hide or sugarcoat his own ideals about these subjects.  I just hope he's prepared to defend himself from the numerous attacks that have come his way.",1263945600,15,5414,4.7209797657082
3934127,1,B002HEXVUI,"I cannot believe there is such a number of great reviews for this film! After watching it I had nothing but questions: have people's tastes really fallen so low? Did the director, being an experienced and talented man, really think he accomplished something great with this? Am I wrong by not enjoying it at all when everybody around me does?

I haven't been so bored watching a film for a long time. Granted, the effects were spectacular (and my only star goes exclusively to them)! from the very first scene I knew almost exactly what was going to happen in the rest of the film. Since I heard the story about that big orange bird I couldn't help but waited when the protagonist was going to ride it. It was crystal clear from the start that the bad military men and greedy businessmen were going to try and ruin the planet and the good guy will save it (turning into an avatar himself and, of course, reuniting with his beloved) but not without some sacrifice on the good people's side. There was no surprise whatsoever at all! There was nothing new, nothing exciting, nothing interesting. I will never bring back those 3 hours of my life!

I cannot believe film professionals really think that nowadays this is enough for a film just to have some very special effects and virtually nothing more. Turns out they are right considering all the raving reviews and crowds of people going to the cinemas. What a depressing thought!......",1263945600,43,1435,4.645669291338582
3934128,5,B002HEXVUI,"I am 38. I am cynical to this degree. When I went to the movie I was expecting a teen flick. What I've got was a best experience that lingered for weeks with me. I have definitely not expected that much of an impression. I went to see the movie for the second time. The same result. Cameron has done and amazing, truly amazing job!",1263859200,2,331,4.107692307692307
3934129,3,B002HEXVUI,"Great effects!  Wonderful display of visual imagination!  BUT . . .

I have to add my voice to the chorus of those singing ""I've seen this movie before!""

The plot was simplistic, obvious and a mash-up of several other movies on the exact same subject.  I found myself saying ""Yes, I already know that we humans get carried away in our greed and are capable of destroying a race of people to satisfy it.  Tell me something that I don't know.""

I would have liked to see a more traditional Sci-Fi exploration of the Na'vi culture.  That's what I was interested in, not the thinly veiled message.",1263859200,9,594,4.485981308411215
3934130,3,B002HEXVUI,"To begin with this movie features bits and pieces of Cameron's other movies. Lets start with Aliens, well in Avatar they are trying to farm for natural resources , not much different in Aliens. Also featured from Aliens is the radar scanners and Sigourney Weaver. Next Cameron movie Terminator, Avatar features ships robots just like in Terminator. Finally, Titanic is also featured in Avatar though not a big part, a ship does go down. Having seen the movie all the way through 5 times and just the ending 15 plus times, I still think this movie is not all that it's cracked up to be. You may ask why have I seen the movie 5 times, well I work at a movie theater that requires us to collect glasses at the end of the movie, but have to sit in theater and watch the movie with the paying customers. That being said other 3-D movies such as Up I watched over fifteen times and never got tired of it.",1263859200,,898,4.319526627218935
3934131,1,B002HEXVUI,"I saw this movie at my local theater and at first I enjoyed it but later on in the film I was not pleased with what I saw for a number of reasons.

First of all as a Sci-fi film it should have a lot of action scenes. This movie had only one battle scene at the end that lasted for about 10 to 20 minutes.

Secondly the film portrayed the marines as stupid, heartless, family killers.

The main character was a traitor to the marines.

It dragged on and on and was boring and redundant.

The natives to the planet had a religion that closely resembled the Force.

The movie was a big promotor of environmentalism.

The movie resembled the Vietnamn war.

I did not like this film. Do not go to the Theater and do not by the DVD, but atmost rent it.",1263772800,9,746,4.096551724137931
3934132,5,B002HEXVUI,"Before I went to the IMAX to see the 3-D movie, I read these reviews first so this is for those wondering if you should fork out the extra cash for the IMAX and then another couple more to see the ""IMAX-3-D"" instead of the standard 3-D movie.

The answer is YES.  Let me give you an example.  My ""thrifty"" boyfriend went to the $3 matinee at this cheap movie theater with smaller-than-your-average-theater screens with his friends.  I refused to go since I was not going to waste my time unless I got to see it in 3-D.  To him, it was a waste of money because his last 3-D IMAX movie experience 2-years ago left him disappointed and we'd both gotten headaches.  But I had read the ""Avatar 3-D"" hype and was willing to see if it really was going to be an ""experience.""

The next week was his birthday and he was rather put-out with me since as his birthday present I had gotten us tickets to see the ""IMAX 3-D"" Avatar at our local IMAX.  He could not fathom how I could waste all this cash when for a fraction of these IMAX tickets; we could have gone to see the $3 movie.
Since he enjoyed seeing Avatar without the 3-D, I asked him to tell me AFTER he saw the 3-D movie whether I had wasted my money or not.

Needless to say, after the movie, all he kept repeating was my favorite phrase:  You're right.

He mentioned the following that he enjoyed at the IMAX 3-D movie that he did not get to enjoy @ the bargain theater:

1)  The movie previews were also shown in 3-D so you keep the 3-D glasses on the entire time.  One preview had a 3-D effect that was so good that you could hear the entire audience gasp in awe.

2)  The IMAX ""Experience"" means that when a bomb goes off in the movie, you feel the bomb go off because the floor or chair shakes and maybe it was just us but we thought the air moved too.

He said watching Avatar again but this time in 3-D was worth it.  I can't imagine not watching Avatar and especially the ""Pandora"" scenes in 3-D.  He agreed.  Best of all, neither of us got the 3-D headache.

Nobody moved and nobody talked.  We all just sat and ""experienced.""

This is not the eye-crossing 3-D effect from decades ago like when I saw Friday the 13th part 3 in 3-D cardboard glasses to watch cheap effects like the eye-popping out of the screen.

We thought we did well by getting there 40 mins early since we already had our tickets but if you want to see the 3-D movie from the middle of the screen, I suggest you get there earlier.

FYI - This Saturday and Sunday at our IMAX 3-D Avatar movie viewings, both the 2:45pm matinees were sold out.",1263772800,4,2570,4.17479674796748
3934133,5,B002HEXVUI,"I have seen Avatar twice now.  The first time I was so overwhelmed I couldn't stop thinking about it for two days.  The second time was equally wonderful and I was able to absorb more of it (by the way it's perfectly wonderful in 2D - 3D added very little to the experience).  This film conveys the beauty of the natural world, and the need to protect it, better then any speech or scientific data.  There was a time when the Earth was like this - beautiful and dangerous and naturally sustainable.  Human beings in their desire to survive and create more security have worked hard to change the world and we have succeeded.  The cost has been great though and it is finally becoming clear that we have gone too far.  Avatar reminds us that there is something greater then short term need and greed, and if we don't recover a vision of a sustainable world our own survivability is in jeopardy.  Some viewers find the conflict in Avatar unnecessary and cliche, but I feel it's just holding up a mirror and reflecting what is happening in our world.  As we speak the Amazon rain-forest is being cut down because of the need for more grazing land for the beef industry.  The ice caps are melting, the coral reefs are threatened - it goes on and on.  We cannot go back to the hunter/gatherer stage, but we can go forward and use our science and technology to reduce the human footprint.  I can image a sustainable modern world but it will take time and sacrifice, especially from 1st world peoples who have come to take for granted that energy is unlimited.  The biggest obstacle is the denial that persists and I fear that the environmental impacts will have to get worse and cause more direct suffering before we will get serious.

Avatar filled me with wonder and broke my heart, and I am grateful.

Edit:
I feel the critical comparisons to other films are invalid.  All stories contains elements of other stories.  If this was a problem 99.9% of all films, books, etc, would have to go away.  To the contrary the artful retelling of stories makes them richer.  That said if you wish to compare Avatar with another film have a look at Emerald Forest.",1263772800,3,2149,4.506459948320414

There is a nagging thought though....I have seen this movie more then once. Campare it to the Stunningly gorgeously viewable film, The Last Samurai, which in its turn was compared to the gorgeous film of Dances with Wolves. I expected more from James Cameron.

3934136,5,B002HEXVUI,"I saw ""Avatar"" in 3D on the giant screen in a packed Imax theater. It's a very good movie though not a great one. The special effects are sensational, of the knock-your-socks off variety, and go beyond anything that's been done before in film, particularly the depiction of the Na'vi people and its creation of entirely new strange animal creatures, and the views of an alternative nature with floating mountains and colossal trees as big as cities.
 The movie, after the great scenes of Marine corporal Jake Sully's indoctrination into the natural world of the planet Pandora and into the Na'vi tribe, resorts to the usual film hoakiness and clichs. Briefly it even resembled a Tarzan movie.
It's very violent, in the tradition of the action blockbuster genre. It turns into another gruesome war, battle and combat movie. The battle scenes are really horrifying and no different than the century old cowboys versus Indians baloney, except this time the Indians are mounted on strange creatures.
Instead of blazing new territories of content Cameron is mining all the old stereotypes and reliving the past. Will movies never grow up? Technically and in terms of eye-popping effects they have surely progressed, but the violent content remains, and we have to ask ourselves why?
 I think Cameron underestimates the intelligence and tastes of audiences today. To some extent a movie maker should be breaking new ground not only technically but in terms of sensitivity and morality. The film could have gone in another more pacific direction and not catered to the baser emotions and the vicarious thrills of watching senseless violence.
How could the movie have gone in another direction? Signoney Weaver in one scene talks about the trees on the planet Pandora that can communicate with each other on the entire planet by means of their root system. Why not have the roots of these trees underneath the alien military base uproot and destroy the perimeter of the base and the base itself and avoid the heart-wrenching combat scenes?
The war whoops and cries for revenge and violence from both sides seemed all too familiar. Cameron was showing how indigenous peoples have been wiped out, and he was also perhaps trying to show the futility of war, but he did so without offering alternative actions.
Because of its great technical leaps forward this movie deserves to be seen and acclaimed. Cameron has taken a giant leap forward for moviemakers and audiences.",1263686400,2,2459,5.009779951100245
3934137,4,B002HEXVUI,"Take the Story of The Last Samuari or Dances With Wolves move it to the future add some excellent CGI and make it 3D for good measure and you have this movie.  This time around the Earth is a dying planet and a group of scientists and military are interested in a specific mineral (maybe dilithium crystals?) from the planet of the Navi.  They are a large humanoid species that live in a ecological system where all forms of life seem to be connected to each other and everyone worships a tree God called Awai.

One of the soldiers is selected for a mission (because his twin brother has died) to use an Avatar (a part human part Navi body) because he has similar DNA to his brother.  The soldier is crippled so when he links with the avatar his brain transfers to the avatar and he can do whatever the avatar can do, which includes walking.  He is told that he has three months to infiltrate the Navis and send back useful information to the military and scientists so they can get the needed mineral supply.

Like in the other mentioned films, the more he lives among them he starts shifing his allegience to them.  Eventually, he has tough decisions to make.

The movie is one of the best science fiction films I have seen for all the aspects combined make up a total movie that is excellent.  The movie has a running time of about three hours which for someone as old as me is a little too long to wear those 3D glasses (I started getting a small headache by the end).

There is one thing though that I couldn't help but notice during my experience with this visual and stunning masterpiece - Cameron has indeed been viewing (and become greatly influenced by) the artwork of Roger Dean (famous for his surrealistic / fantasy album covers by Yes and other prominent artists).  The colorful flying dragons, the floating mountains, the majestic and mystical arches ... they're all there!!  And being a bigtime Yes fan myself, I was simply enthralled by the whole thing.

Those of you who maybe skeptical, just know that the world that James created has foundation in current earth research on how the universe, our planet and all its diversity (including us) functions and is connected. The research on mono-atomic elements, ""There are many mysterious and magical things that have been recorded in history. The Biblical manna, the Philosopher's Stone, the Fountain of Youth, Orgone energy, prana, chi, the Holy Grail, the Great Pyramid and the Ark of the Covenant are a few of these things. It looks like these things and more might be related to a new class of materials that have been identified and described in the last few decades. In the late 1970s an Arizona farmer named David Hudson noticed some very strange materials as he was doing some gold mining on his land.  Hudson spent several million dollars over the following decade figuring out how to obtain and work with these strange materials. In 1989 David Hudson was granted patents on these materials and methods for obtaining them.(1)

Other researchers were also making similar discoveries around this same time but Hudson was the first to get information out to the public about his discoveries. During the early 1990s Hudson toured the United States giving lectures and workshops about what he had found. Transcripts of portions of three of David Hudson's lectures are available on the Web. The most complete of these transcripts is the transcript of his Dallas lecture and workshop.(2)

The materials that David Hudson discovered appear to be related to the things I listed in the first paragraph of this article and to concepts of modern physics like superconductivity, quantum coherence and Bose-Einstein condensates.""  By Barry Carter

The best part is that Ormus is in minerals, plants, water, animals, and us,it is in everything.  The Ormus actually a ceramic-mono-atomic according to quantum-physics has the ability to be in the physical world and the non physical world simultaneously, and because it is highly PHOTONIC in nature, a mountain spring deep in the mountains of N.C. scared water to native Indians of that area doesn't need to be pump out of the ground it's natural flows up toward the sun because of it's Ormus level is high, rich in this mono-atomic element.

SOOO the floating Mountains of Pandora, are in line with the science of Ormus.  The connection between the NAVI and their natural surroundings much like our own indigenous people of this earth is both insightful and based in the most advance science and findings on our blue planet.

Then I have to say that he put it all together as a great story teller, and illustrator, as a entertaining, inspiring, and prophetic genius would...as for the film technology and visual fun...that was really great also, but secondary to his profound imaginative and visionary stories, just as in the Abyss James sees and feels all the connections in AVATAR. He also understands that story telling about how the characters are developed and how they connect...if I can not relate to them, it is just another action film. Not sure how much of this he realizes (I think more than he talks about), in his interviews he doesn't get into it quite in the way that I have described, maybe because he does not want to be view this way, but rather as a talented writer, illustrator and movie maker.  And I am not look to elevate him to some cult status, as I believe we all, everyone of has the ability to connect beyond space and time and know as Einstein expressed his desire ""to know the mind of God""  we all have it within us to know the mind of the Universe, so those of us who are passionate we can do this also, James just seems to tap in more easily than others.  He has let go of the destructive filters that prevent us from receiving these wonderful messages from the universe about how it works and who we are.

Congrats to James, well done, well done!  If you have not seen this MOVIE AVATAR...you must see it!  If it doesn't inspire you, you are not awake...",1263600000,4,4275,4.772357723577236

A certain section made this movie some kind of cultural phenomenon and just like other movies and entertainment there are those who are going to learn the language the aliens speak and just go way overboard in an attempt to show how much they think this movie is awesome.  Yeah it was a visual feast no doubt-amazing effects.  The story to provide the conflict is shallow and the characters are pretty surface as well.  This movie would have been way more fun had the story not been the same old recycled stuff we have seen many times before.  Yes Love is more powerful than war, might does not make right, yes humans are dumb careless creatures...all true but theres one problem we've seen all that before.  This movie was far from fresh-sitting there knowing what would happen is not a lot of fun ya know?

I won't even begin to address the overboard fans that ""envy"" the aliens in this movie.  Most of these fans couldn't live more than two days with nature since they would go berserk after not getting thier manga/anime/video game fix.

2 stars only because the effects were out of this world...if you are considering a career involving 3-d models and effects you can't miss this otherwise you can-i promise you've probably seen it before.",1263513600,16,1373,4.590163934426229
3934142,3,B002HEXVUI,".....but not this time.

I REALLY wanted to like this movie. I have been a huge James Cameron fan ever since 1984 with the release of the original ""The Terminator"".

Let's start with the obvious; the special effects. James Cameron boasted that the FX in this film are unlike anything ever seen before and they would revolutionize the FX industry. Well, I personally think he was absolutely right.

The effects are so amazing and totally engrossing. This movie had the ability to literally transport me to the world of Pandora. If future films can utilize FX to the same magnitude that Cameron has done so here, boy, are we in for some really great movies in the future. Truly ground-breaking.

The problem with Avatar is that the FX cannot carry the weight of all the hype that came along with this film. Although visually stunning, the true weakness of this film is the story. The story is rather predicatble and, truth be told, the plot is a LOT like ""Fern Gully: The Last Rainforest"" (yes - really!) and both films share MANY similarities.

The whole time I was watching the film, I felt like I was being preached to. Although the enviromentalist theme is pertinent to all societies of the world, when I go to the movies, I want to be entertained; not to be condescended to. I know that we should do our best to live in harmony with nature and protect our environment from over-exploitation, but I don't need the media shouting it in my face every time I turn around. Trees - good; greedy corporations - bad. I know it. I get it. Now just shut up and entertain me! I go to the movies to escape the problems of the world for awhile, not to be slapped in the face with them!

I found the acting to be a bit of a weak point as well. All of the actors do a passable job, I guess, but for some reason, I felt like Sigourney Weaver was performing her role as if she were in on some kind of joke. Weaver is an amazing actress, but I just felt like she was going through the motions with Avatar; like she didn't want to be there.

Avatar is an amazing FX film, but overall, it's only an OK film. If only the story would have matched the scope of the visual effects, then maybe Cameron could have indeed securd his title as ""King of the World"" (LOL!).",1263513600,19,2245,4.343675417661098
3934143,4,B002HEXVUI,"I saw this movie on opening night and nobody gave an applause at the end of the movie except for the mentally challenged girl who was clapping throughout the entire film.  I agree whole heartedly with them, the movie was too long and the movie was extremely corny and over emphasized to be a tree huger and be kind to any forms of life we find.  Those are good morals and all but it was like the entire picture, 2 hours and thirty minutes of being spoon fed the idea of having respect for everyone and respecting our planet. The thing that I hated most about Avatar is that it basically took everything from the lore of Warcraft and made a movie out of it.  The blue aliens are the Warcraft night elves, their forest cannot survive without the huge tree exactly like in the movie.  The healing things floating around represent the wisps in Warcraft. If the movie was shorter and wasn't half stolen from Warcraft I would've probably thought this was one of the better movies of the decade but It's so much like Warcraft that it seemed like a cheap ripoff.  I cannot understand why such a simple minded film had to be 2 hours and 30 minutes, oh wait they wanted to make sure the movie costed an epic amount of money so the movie had to be long...  I like the morals, action scenes, picture quality and the sci-fi elements in this movie so I will rate this 4 stars as if the movie wasn't made to long, otherwise it is a 3 to me.",1263513600,2,1425,4.2592592592592595

3934147,4,B002HEXVUI,"The movie Avatar is just amazing. In a nutshell it's James Cameron's view of what things look like when a militarily powerful planet (country), earth, discovers a needed commodity on a unsophisticated and relatively peaceful planet-moon (country), Pandora.  This is one of the new generation of movies which feature both live-action and animation in a pleasing mix, and the 3-D goes a long way to enhancing the feel of the action as well as disguising the fact the movie is largely an animated cartoon.  If a critical examination is needed it must start with the recognition the story itself was already old when David v Goliath was written but that hasn't stopped the likes of Shakespeare, James Fennimore Cooper, J.R.R. Tolkein and many others from adding to the pantheon.  Cameron himself directed another version of this same theme in his 1986 Aliens.  Speaking of which Signorney Weaver's and for that matter Giovanni Ribisi's performances here were shadows of their former selves (which is not surprising since their scenes were acted out well away from any 'action' that was later or previously created by the cgi techs), and at least two of the principle characters/voices admitted in interviews they'd taken acting lessons from 7-10 year old nieces and nephews.  Weaver cited her Diane Fossi role as `good training' for her own dual role as an actress and a voice.  In retrospect it is clear Cameron borrowed heavily from his own former work as well as from Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings trilogy and other similar movies.  So what's all the buzz about?  Well, to answer that question one needs to get off the critical high-horse and remember what it felt like in the theater. For my part I had to use my sleeves when my tissue got too soggy, and while I'd probably not be interested in becoming one of the Na'vi and sharing their life on Pandora I heartily applauded Jak Soo Lee of the Jarhead Clan's decision to do so.  `Nother words, Cameron managed as he so often does to weave together a great little story that plucked all the right strings.

It must be noted here that I'm reporting on a movie experience, not the dvd version.  I watch movies at 'early bird' matinees during the week which means I usually have the auditorium, the big screen, and the sound system all to myself.  Like having my own, very expensive, private screening room.  I watch home movies on my laptop so the dvd experience is bound to be different.

3934149,4,B002HEXVUI,"This film is a visually appealing CGI-fest, with a fairly banal plot involving a corrupt group of developers intent on plundering an alien planet of natural resources. Enter Jake Sully, ex-marine, who is hired to pilot an Avatar, an alien body which will allow him to interact with the locals and try to convince them to abandon their ancestral lands so that the developers can mine ""Unobtanium.""

What I liked most about the film, was the CGI. The alien race was visually stunning, appealing, and attractively portrayed. The romance between Jake and the princess of the local tribe was cute, but a bit trite.

Unfortunately, where Avatar failed most for me was in the plot. The storyline was simply not that good. I felt Jake as he was portrayed and implemented was not satisfying. He is in fact a traitor to both Na'vi and to his own species. Instead of helping to broker some sort of truce, or trade deal, or at the very least, work for a more bloodless outcome, Jake goes native, turns traitor and kills his own people. The Na'vi's acceptance of Jake after his betrayal was too convenient. Jake's lack of angst at killing his own species seemed too callous.

I felt Jake to an extent had become a VR junky like those who play WOW for 24 hrs a day.  Instead of reaching internal acceptance of his own humanity, in order to become accepted and happy, Jake embraces his role as a big blue elf and leave humanity behind.

The Na'vi themself were quite Mary-suish. All cultures have flaws, and yet the Na'vi seem too perfect. Even the princesses' boyfriend seems to accept Jake ruining his betrothal with far more grace than warranted. The parallels between the Na'vi and Native populations have been mentioned numerous times, but it is so glaringly obvious almost to the point of being irritating. Cameron's creation entirely lacks subtlety and goes directly for the sledgehammer.  I would've liked to see the Na'vi have a few flaws.  Instead it was Saintly Na'vi vs. Corrupt humanity which equaled a rather simplistic and Ferngully-ish plot.

Still, as films go, I was vastly entertained by the CGI, the na'vi and the world of Pandora. Although the soapboxing also annoyed me.",1263340800,6,2177,4.7712765957446805

3934152,2,B002HEXVUI,"boy they made a big deal about all the visual effects in this movie, and they are pretty amazing. but it seems like a really long roundabout way to cg a movie. capturing the actors actual facial expressions and rendering them on a computer seems like alot of work for a little pay off.

honestly my biggest complaint about this movie has to do with where the emphasis was placed on the production. for a movie with a budget the likes of which has never been seen before they went with a schlock story with a predictable curve and no pay off. seriously the whole spectacle of it all is overshadowed by how mediocre the plot is. it's not a bad plot mind, but it's so basic it really feels empty. they couldn't have spent maybe one of those millions on something original?

thats where it really gets me, for such stunning visuals the whole movie isn't very original. the horses they ride are pretty much horses. the bows are just bows, and with a few exeptions the florra of pandora is mostly things you can find watching a decent underwater documentary. the closest they get to original are the dragons, which were kinda cool but original creatures are not hard to invent.

i also thought they missed alotta oportunities with the little stories. jake sully is a wheelchair bound marine, and he has no trouble picking walking back up at all once his legs are restored by the avatar process. and after spending weeks in the new body he is still an extremely capable cripple. they never once show him have a moment where he struggles with pulling his dead legs out of the machine.

sigourney weever plays a marine hating pocket protector wearing environmentalist nerd. who hates jake imediatly because he's a marine, big surprise, but the second he puts on the avatar body she warms up to him. and really without much trouble she continues warming up to him almost regardless of jakes actual actions.

overall, the story is bland, the characters are pretty poorly built up and the beastiary is pretty familair if brightly colored. but hey, the movie looks great. thats about the best thing i can say for it. boring but beautiful.",1263168000,7,2125,4.611111111111111

The colors, the textures and the physics are truly amazing. James Cameron has raised the bar again. Now he'll have other directors like George Lucas and Michael Bay nipping at his heels. The story I can't say the same for. Maybe it's cause I've seen it done over and over again; Pocahontas, Dances With Wolves, The Last Samurai. I could already tell where the story was going 20 minutes in. So I say for no-brainer leave the world behind entertainment, see it in IMAX 3D.",1263168000,,601,4.375
3934155,5,B002HEXVUI,"It starts with the visual. Cameron's epic just changed the landscape of CGI. These effects-meisters have mastered the tension of muscles working hard, and the yielding where something presses against a body's soft tissue. These figures truly come to life, instead of resembling over-medicated puppets. But the technology is only the paint and brush - artistry comes from how they're wielded. Cameron's fantastic land- and skyscapes, his luminous nightworld, his thundering devastation of war all set new standards of their own, as well.

But imagery alone doesn't make a movie memorable. It's the plot, the character, the scripting, and the acting (if the word actually applies) that engage the viewer's feelings and imagination. Cameron succeeds again in more ways than I have words to describe.  Although the ecofable tends toward the predictable, it's beautifully done. The imagery and character form such a dense mesh of strands that readers can see almost anything they want in it: religious, moral, social, political - I'm sure there are long arguments being held over every way pick the threads of this movie apart. One thing I appreciate is how every scale holds something of interest. Minutiae like the Latina pilot's warpaint contribute moment by moment.

At the larger scales, though, Cameron echoes C.S. Lewis's thought that ""The greatest evil ... is conceived ... in clear, carpeted, warmed, well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voices."" Once those quiet voices have spoken, von Clausewitz's dictum comes to mind: ""War is regarded as nothing but the continuation of state policy with other means."" Even if the distinction of corporation and state blurs, the adage remains true.

The grand visual scale of this movie demands a big screen. Detail will get lost when I see it again on DVD (and I shall see it again). But the complex flow of ideas and beliefs will come through as clearly as ever, and I expect to see more in it with each viewing. Whether you want a thrilling visual spectacle or a modern morality play of the most complex sort, Avatar is what you want.

3934156,1,B002HEXVUI,"Stunning sure; revolutionary, absolutely. Pomp does not a movie make.

Avatar was one of, if not the most, predictable movies I have ever seen. (Not the worst, that honor still belongs to Wanted.) I really do believe in the main message of this movie - It IS wrong to steal and destroy someone's home. This is not a new theme. It has and probably will be done over and over again, but it's not this that I find lacking. The story is, as I said, completely predictable, with stereotyped characters and little development; not to mention incredibly long winded. An hour in, I was already twitching in my seat. Then, of course, there are the heavy-handed, ultra-environmental messages and the Mother Goddess junk, with which I won't even begin to bore you. (To be honest, I could have even forgiven this stuff.)

There is nothing new under the sun. Every story takes something from somewhere else, but I still need it to wow me. I can't in good conscience tell someone to drop $10 and 3 hours of life to see screensavers, however beautiful they may be. I've seen films made for pennies compared to this, and been left excited, entertained, and satisfied. This movie gave me none of these things.

3934157,5,B002HEXVUI,"The story of Avatar has been nicely told in other reviews, as has the stunning beauty of the film. I think that anyone who goes to see Avatar will understand from the beginning that Sam Worthington's Jake will be drawn to the Na'vi and eventually join them.  The audience certainly wants to see that happen, because we are drawn to the Na'vi ourselves. Jake, however, is in conflict over his obligation to infiltrate the natives of Pandora and his sympathy with them; his journey to understanding the Na'vi that is the heart of the film.

Yes, this story has been told before, as noted by others, in Dances With Wolves.  I am sure there are other examples as well.  Indeed, how many stories have the same basic core?  How many love stories, adventure stories have the same basic plot?  I read a comment from an author that we simply re-tell stories from different perspectives. Although Avatar is a story of the exploitation of indigenous people, bringing to mind the American Indians, Australian aborigines and African people it is a theme bearing repeating.  People on this planet are still being exploited and it is not a stretch to imagine humans going to other planets to do the same.

The story of Avatar is also one of intolerance. The corporation carrying out mining operations has its own mercenaries to bend the will of the Na'vi.  This is a universal film theme going back to D. W. Griffith's Intolerance. James Cameron creates a compelling world where all of nature is connected, and the majority of we urban bound viewers find such a magical place fascinating. Naturally, the greed of the humans guarantees that the unique world of the Na'vi will be destroyed. Mr. Cameron is pointing a mirror at us.  The debate is still going on as to how much of our environment is to be sacrificed for the good of economic development.  We need to be reminded of environmental loss. When a decision is made to exploit the land, the destruction cannot be undone.

Unfortunately, there are many who politicize Avatar into an attack on the Marines or an attack on the policies of the Bush administration.  It is just a movie, not an environmental manifesto or a threat to our security.  Can't ex-Marines be treated as fictional villains?  There are those who are far too eager to twist film stories into a political attack or supportive of a political view; this only succeeds in perverting the film, which is a fiction is the first place.  The message of Avatar is that the underdog can defeat their enemies, a rarity event indeed. If one considers the fate of the American Indian's the story of Avatar is a marvelous fantasy. It is a fantasy that is beautiful to behold and if it motivates people to think about nature and the environment as something to appreciate and preserve instead of a source of profit, so much the better.",1263168000,2,2828,4.694331983805668
3934158,3,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is one of the most exciting blockbuster films to come along in a long while, especially if you have the chance to see it in 3D.  Some have argued that the plot is generic, predictable, and full of plot holes, but it's still very entertaining, and, If you're looking for a dense, thoughtful storyline, you shouldn't be watching a multimillion dollar CG blockbuster in 3-D to begin with. However, as much as I enjoyed the film, I have to say that its messages truly concerned me.

Avatar tries to be a film that promotes good messages, taking on issues like environmentalism, corporate greed, military imperialism, and even introducing its audiences to a sense of New Age spiritualism.  I support all of these ideas, but here's what I feel we should all be considering about the film's messages:

---

1. THE MAIN CHARACTER IS FORCED TO FIGHT.  In the real world, choosing to confront threats to the environment and to oppressed cultures is difficult because these issues do not directly affect our lives.  The truly difficult (and heroic) part is to take action when your life would be easier and more comfortable if you stayed out of it.  However, the hero of Avatar is forced into his situation, failing to choose a side until the military literally tries to run him over with a giant plow for no apparent reason all while conveniently forgetting who he is and that he is working for them.  He's forced to take a side in a way that no one in the real world ever is.  The US military isn't going to invade your bedroom in order to protect the world from terror, nor will greedy corporations drill for oil in your backyard.

We therefore can't learn anything from Jake's example because it does not pertain to us.  In order to truly confront these evils in our world, we need to learn from the examples of heroes that risk everything by standing up when it isn't in their best interest to do so.

2. OVER-THE-TOP VILLAINS.  These guys are so absurdly bad that they bear little resemblance to anyone you'll find in the real world.  I consider myself a leftist, and I am generally anti-war, but even I know that the military isn't made up of gun-happy maniacs.  If anything, the US military of today has the hardest job possible, playing diplomat to real-world cultures and communities that resemble the Navi, building their schools and coming to love their children, all while waiting for roadside bombs and suicide bombers to come out of nowhere at any moment.  That doesn't make the military perfect, nor does it justify our presence in many countries where I feel we do not belong, but it does make the military incredibly different from the monsters portrayed in this film.  If we genuinely want the people seeing this film to be able to take a stand against, and make informed decisions about, military imperialism, then they need to first understand their enemy and what his side of the argument is.  But Avatar won't help anyone understand the real thinking that promotes military imperialism.  It will just make people angry against an exaggerated stereotype that doesn't apply to what's really happening.  It might also offend a whole lot of decent veterans who risked their lives to protect this country in the process.

3. HIGHLY DISTURBING ESCAPIST MESSAGE.  I spend as much time online as the next guy (if not more), and maybe that's why I see the most disturbing aspect of this film for what it is.  The main character escapes his bland and unpleasant life by living through an ""avatar"" (which is, conveniently enough, the word for an online profile/identity) which he is able to do via sophisticated technology.  This allows him to be part of an idealistic fantasy world that is more exciting and colorful than the real world Jake has spent his whole life knowing.  In fact, with the exception of five comrades, every human in this film is portrayed as being thoroughly evil.  So Jake escapes to a world where these people are not present, and when they threaten to take him out of this world and pull the plug on it, he fights back and tries to kill them.  Let's also not forget that the emotional high point of the entire film (hopefully, this isn't much of a spoiler for anyone) is when Jake is transferred permanently to his Avatar body and now knows he will never have to return to his old life.  Do I really need to draw the disturbing parallels to having an online life, here?

I don't think impressionable kids are going to grab grenades and start trying to blow up mom and dad, but I do worry that what we're really teaching them to value in this film is getting away from it all, escaping to a technologically enabled fantasy world where our problems don't follow us, whether they be physical short-comings (Jake is handicapped), disillusionment with the real world (Earth's environment has been ""killed"", greedy corporations run everything), or inability to get along with others (as said before, nearly all humans seem to be evil).  How many people will leave theaters wishing that they too could live with the Navi on Pandora or, worse yet, extend that sense of escapist excitement to World of Warcraft, Second Life, or even Twitter and Facebook?

----

The bottom line of all of this is that, while Avatar is an incredibly fun film, most of its messages are useless because they are exaggerated to the point that they bear no resemblance to the real world, and one of the film's messages actually has the potential to be really damaging.  I do think that people SHOULD catch this film in the theaters (in 3D!) because it's an amazing experience, but you should carefully consider the messages the film is telling you in the process, and then evaluate them for yourself.  If bringing children along, I would suggest having a conversation with them about the film's messages afterward.  I don't think anyone should ever avoid a good film, show, or video game just because it has disturbing messages, but those disturbing messages shouldn't be ignored, either.",1263168000,7,5991,4.726923076923077
3934159,4,B002HEXVUI,"Apparently some people have chosen to interpret the theme of James Cameron's Ferngully remake, Avatar, as racist.

The theme of the outsider who arrives, becomes an insider, and then helps save them, is about as anti-racist a theme as one is likely to find. The Thirteenth Warrior had the same theme (Arab becomes accepted among barbarians), as did the recent remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still (alien decides not to destroy humanity). Even Twilight has a touch of that theme. This theme goes back at least as far as Beowulf (a Geat hero among Danes -- and the story which inspired The Thirteenth Warrior), if not further.

People who cherry-pick their examples only to include races against which they have a grudge, and then use that as evidence of some kind of racist message, really need to examine their motives, imo. The message isn't about ""race"" at all. It's about crossing cultural boundaries. It's about synthesis.

Yes, the human ""saviour"" in Avatar could do things the Na'vi couldn't -- because he would do them. He was not constrained by their assumptions about what was possible or proper (praying to the tree/planet/god, capturing a big red bird, etc.). But anyone who thinks that the Na'vi did not also teach him things completely misses the point. He was able to accomplish more as one of the Na'vi than he could ever have done as a human -- and not just because he was big and blue.",1263168000,2,1405,4.703252032520325
3934160,5,B002HEXVUI,"Wow!  I saw the movie in 3D and highly recommend it.  the theater was fuul so we had to sit in the front rwo (the place I HATE sitting in movies), but nonetheless this film had me riveted from stard to finish.  THis movie was a well made cross between the story of John Smith (the guy who lived with the native Americans and was torn between the woman he fell in love with, his new kinship with these people he started thinking of as savages and become like one of them and his own people who were there simply to take everyhting form the native people) and a Sci Fi short story entitled ""Call me Joe"".  The 3D version of Avatar pulls you in and makes you part of the movie.  The visual effects are completely stunning and the story powerful.
  You may hear people whine that the movie has a preachy message.  Well, it does, but ask youself this, as a species, how many times have we went in and taken from another race?  Then shut up because you know, given the chance EVERY TIME we as a species will take what is not ours, murder, rape and kill (hello, remember the people that lived here in the US before we Euros got here?).  But of course we always justify it, or pretend it never happened.  So, the message is simple truth.
  That all aside, the movie was just plain fantastic.  I'm glad I saw it at the theater, glad I saw it in 3d and may even go see it again.",1263081600,2,1368,4.132575757575758
3934161,3,B002HEXVUI,"Cameron and Jackson and lots of Hollywood people are really learning fast how to ride the new special effects bicycle and the effects in this movie, especially in 3D, are just astounding.  What cannot possibly be, is.  What cannot possibly happen, does.

For that reason alone I recommend the movie.  It was a very fun ride.  You will slap away bugs that never were, walk among beautifully rendered plant life, and swim in water that will make you wish you could just stop the movie for a few minutes and take some pictures.  But there isn't time between dodging rounds from weapons not yet invented and staring mouth-wide-open at the six-legged horse things and Banshees.

The special effects almost overcome the fatally flawed story line.  The movie has been done with more or less telling effect in Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas, and Fern Gully, among others (the bulldozer/rain forest scene is totally gratuitous, a two-minute afterthought that doesn't give the audience credit for understanding that Cameron is taking us through territory we know well).

In fact, this movie is a perfect example of why directors and producers need to leave the story-telling to story-tellers, in most cases.  Imagine how astonishing it would be to remake Frank Herbert's Dune with this new power to render whole worlds demonstrated in Avatar.  Imagine the battle of Gettysburg made of whole cloth, a canvas with 200,000 soldiers, 20,000 calvary, 250 cannon, and the assault on the third day rendered from perspectives other than a shaky helicopter that evokes Viet Nam more than 1863.

I credit Cameron for his vision and his new toys.  But even his ""horses"" look like Sioux spirit horse art right down to their brightly dotted manes.  So, yeehaw for the special effects and realism beyond comprehension, and yawn for the story.  We will have to wait a few more years for everyone to get the mechanicals down pat and then we should start to see some real UNREAL movies that really will blow our socks off on every level.

Oh, and it was cool to see Sigourney's body double.  She brings sci-fi cred to movies on the edge of reality and worked well in this piece.  Predictable but nice to see again.",1263081600,3,2187,4.833333333333333

3934163,4,B002HEXVUI,"At the time of writing this, Avatar has made over $1 Billion worldwide. An amazing feat and yet it all seems to ring a little hollow. More on that sentiment shortly as I focus on the praise it would be foolish to deny this film for it's technical achievments. This is a finely crafted form and function altering film. There's 3-D a la Beowulf, A Christmas Story, Toy Story and then there's the immersion that is present in lush detail in almost every scene in Avatar. Blades of grass, altitudes and subtleties abound.
The 'green' message here is obviously present in an anti-industry plot that puts the viewer square inside the minds of the Na'vi, the tribal race that makes every effort to protect the lush planet from mining of rare minerals by humans. The human component is big-business, seeming to expand on the technology visualized in 'Aliens'.
Every aspect of these cultures is breezed into the viewers eyes and rotated for picture perfect clarity. It's almost a shame that the 3-D thrill wears off after the initial exposure to the mechanism so tightly wound into the thrill of what is on the screen. If any scenes from the latter part of the film were the first exposure, jaws would drop. The subtle introduction to the 3-D effect is quite effective nonetheless and Avatar succeeds on these merits. Breaking the plot down is an entirely different animal. Although Avatar is, put simply, a no-expense spared revisioning of Ferngully, there were serious messages on glaring display that may tend to mar this film if it is to be reflected on beyond the 'cool' factor.
Avatar, the word itself means, in computer games, a character or persona of a player with a graphical representation. In the Massively Multiple Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), an Avatar grows and becomes a separate networked character complete with online relationships, attainments and abilities beyond normal human endeavor. Jake Sully, the main character in Avatar, is in a wheelchair and as times goes by, his Avatar's involvement with the Na'vi serves to weaken his physical state even further, showing weight loss, scruffy hair and unkept beard. SPOILER TO FOLLOW: In short, the obvious message here is as technology caters to the furthering of experience from the human body, the less the human body is needed. When Jake Sully eventually depletes his wheelchair bound human body, gathering enough strength in his Na'vi Avatar, he leaves the human body to die so he can exist solely in the Avatar. There are even comments later on about the human Jake's neglect of hygiene. With a story so closely linked to the MMORPG social settings catering more to a virtual social realm, forsaking real social settings, the message ultimately makes Avatar a hidden downer of a film. Despite the visual enjoyment and the obvious graphical talent on display here, it's unfortunate that Avatar doesn't make the virtual reality trumping reality message a bit more cryptic.",1262995200,,2940,4.9655172413793105

Titanic was crap and not only that Cameron recycled his composer for Titanic and used the same guy (James Horner for this one) I was not impressed by the very weak story in this film.

3934165,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is an example of amazing film making trumping skillful storytelling. Its plot is wafer-thin; a cadre of human scientists use some highfallutin scientific process to become avatars (carbon copies) of the Na'vi, a peaceful society living on the remote planet Pandora, in the hopes of enticing them away from their mineral-rich home. This outline forms the playground where James Cameron has allowed his imagination to go nuts, to wondrous results. Every frame is filled to the edges with unsurpassed special effects, creating a gorgeous yet somehow realistic world- and that isn't easy to do with glow-in-the-dark plants and phosphorescent dirt. The characters are thin but interesting enough to keep us involved in the story, and the picture is constantly dotted with exciting sequences that take your breath away. Themes such as the futility of war and the necessity of ""going green"" are obvious throughout the film, but there are also subtle underlying lessons about man's tenuous relationship with the environment which I personally found most interesting. In the end this is a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi masterpiece that reinvigorates and redefines the genre, and has enough heart and spectacle to interest the most jaded of moviegoers.

 Many books, audio CDs and video DVDs have been expressed by doctors, psychologists and nutrition experts about food or mental health. Avatar brings emotional health by using plant and animal fantasy far greater than Earth's ordinary plant and animal life, even though the story and characters, and soft tribal-classic music just disappear in our imagination: creating our own biographical camp adventure by imagining ourselves in Pandora. Reality of poverty, disease and work stress can be an emotional battlefield. Avatar is our emotional super-protector. Since many suburbs surrounding main cities do not have a museum, zoo and rollercoaster showground park in each area, I believe many viewers on a low budget have no other choice but to see Avatar again because travelling long distance to reach one of the desired places can use up money fast. I saw Avatar in RealD 3D at a cinema-joined shopping mall just walking distance from where I live. The 3D experience was like a dreamy journey through some Disneyland show. I usually forget some of the story and miss most of the words said by actors. I would have to buy the DVD when it is released later this year - when the price has dropped from $30 to $20 or under (Australian dollars).",1262995200,,1303,4.922727272727273

Only this time the aliens are not out to implant something inside you that will only burst out of your chest later to wreak havoc.  The interesting twist is the humans are the ones doing that.
In a way, Avatar is a James Cameron greatest hits film that goes over themes that we have seen over and over again.
You have all the common Cameron themes including the dangers of nuclear holocaust, strong female characters, and humans and aliens both using technology.
I really wish Cameron would have told a less predictable story.  However, I am glad that Avatar is doing well at the box office to take the attention away from all the bad horror movies that have spawned up over recent years like the awful Paranormal Activities, all those dreadful Saw movies, and endless mind numbing Final Destination films, that make the average movie goer stay home and watch something from Netflix.
Avatar will be a good thing if Sci Fi makes a much needed comeback in 2010. Both the Sci Fi and Horror genres are at an all time low.

3934168,5,B002HEXVUI,"1/8/2010

Well, my instincts don't usually let me down but I have to say I was dead wrong about the movie Avatar before seeing it.

I went in as completely prepared to be disappointed by the liberal overtones, the disrespect to the Marine Corps and America and struggled with whether to even see the movie. I got in several extended discussions on line about the movie and the things I'd heard about it. I read a lot about it, I heard from my brothers, one loved it one hated it, and I was left with the dilemma of, do I slap down $10 bucks to go and watch all the things I hold dear trashed as Hollywood almost always does? I almost didn't go.

Being a big science fiction fan as a kid, and loving the new 3-D technology and all the technological breakthroughs reported to be in this movie I decided to go today. My initial reaction after seeing Avatar is that this is going down as one of my all time favorite movies. It was brilliant in every way and it turned out that for me the technology was a nice aside but the theme of the movie was what captured and held me from the very beginning. It was funny, I was loving the movie so much that I consciously was braced for the pending disgust which I just knew was going to be right around every corner. It never came.

This movie was everything I would have wanted it to be in every sense. For once there was moral clarity. All this crap about everything being ""gray"" that is so popular these days was no where to be seen. Rather, it was ""right versus wrong"" and there was no doubt which was which.

This story was a brilliant illustration of the fact that greed, hatred, disrespect and lack of empathy will lose every time to morality, decency, love and respect for nature in the long run.

Some say this movie was another contribution from the environmental whack jobs. As one who despises the rush to self destruction that al gore and his sheep are jamming down the throats of mankind, I found the respect for nature and it's harmony with the Na'vi in this movie to be precisely how I feel about the beautiful aspects of nature, animals, plants and other life forms. That was beautifully portrayed and was no way offensive in the way that so much of the radical left's absurd approach is.

I've never before seen a more accurate portrayal of exactly how I feel about the creatures around me than the relationship the Na'vi have with their fellow inhabitants. Don't kill for sport, if you kill to eat, be grateful to the creature and limit their suffering. I resonated with so much of this movie as I have never before.

Some say this was a hit piece on America and the Marines. As a former Marine I can state without a doubt that MY Marine Corps' reputation was beautifully portrayed and is in tact in this movie and any decent Marine will feel the same way, after all, the hero of the movie is a former Marine and though misguided initially, he soon discovers the moral path and never wavers going so far as to disobey orders which is what a REAL Marine is commanded to do by the Uniform Code of Military Justice when he's given an unlawful order.

Sure, the evil Colonel is portrayed as a former Marine leading a bunch of mercenaries but that just means he was a Marine who went bad. Let's remember that Lee Harvey Oswald was a Marine and so was that fat pant load, Congressman Murtha, both disgraces to the Marine Corps. We're all humans and no group on earth is perfect, (though My Marine Corps comes pretty close! ;)

The overwhelming message about the Marine Corps was that a basic Marine, while maybe not a college graduate yet, can rise above the evil power structure which is driven by all manner of college wizards who are running over with scholastic information but who don't have a shred of common sense or decency and who look down on the masses from their self imagined pinnacles of supremacy. Sigourney Weaver was perfect in that roll and I loved that even SHE was converted to the moral side before it was over.

All in all, I can't remember the last time I was more moved by something that came out of Hollywood. That movie spoke to me. Were I in the situation of the lead character, I would like to think I'd have the courage to take the exact same path and make the exact same decisions he did. That's certainly what my heart would want to do.

Thank you to Mr. Cameron.",1262908800,2,4344,4.369268897149938
3934169,1,B002HEXVUI,"Terminator, Aliens, T2, The Abyss, True Lies, Titanic ...

Avatar, sold out everywhere, queues around the block, of course, I was a little excited. At worst, I expected the fun of True Lies.

Briefly, the 3D is excellent, as are the effects, but who cares when the designs look like stupid ugly blue Disney aliens from a bad dream about Abe's Odyssey. The rest of the effects look like Halo 3, but it's more fun to play Halo 3, the dragon things are rip-offs from the Panzer Dragoon saga, but it's more fun to play Panzer Dragoon. It's even more fun to watch the Panzer Dragoon FMV's on the Saturn.

So why one star? The plot is 100% predictable, and when you've worked out the ending within ten minutes, it isn't nice knowing you have to wait three hours to see it. But you might be thinking 'Well, we knew the ending of Titanic too.' Fair enough, but Titanic had a script, a main character who was smart, cool and every bit a hero as a blockbuster requires. The main character in Avatar is a moron. I don't look up to him, I don't aspire to be like him, I don't find him funny and I don't care if he lives or dies.

In short, that's it. Avatar has no script, no plot, no likable characters, no dialogue that couldn't be improvised. If it inspires more films like it, more hollow 3D nonsense, then I fear for the future of cinema and the generations who grow up with it.",1262908800,16,1371,4.281853281853282

3934172,3,B002HEXVUI,"My chief complaint about this movie is just what my title says.  Anybody can throw money at a movie to make it pretty these days.  And don't get me wrong, Avatar is a very pretty movie.  The 3d was really good, the design of Pandora was amazing, the scope of the movie was Epic.  But just because it's a very pretty movie, does it mean it's good?  I don't think so.

I was reading the making of book and there is this intro by Peter Jackson, and he talks about ""suspension of disbelief.""  Mr Jackson is talking about the world created in this movie, and yes it is a very pretty world.  The problem is it doesn't get by my suspension of disbelief because the story, dialogue, and characters are so bad in this movie.

Avatar is basically ""Dances With Fern Gully in Space.""  The bad guy is bad because he is bad.  He does bad things because hes the bad guy, even things that are illogical.  Because the bad guy isn't a character, he is just some poor shmuck who is being pushed about by Cameron's keyboard because he has to be bad to advance the plot.  The army guys who work for him, well they are all bad too.  Why are they bad, I don't know they just are.  Except for the named pilot soldier character who hangs out with the main characters, she has a heart of gold.  The good guys are intellectual scientists, who are trying to save the planet.  The main character is good because he learns there ways, and the natives go along with it and teach them all their ways IN THREE MONTHS because he is somehow better than all the people who came before him.  Everybody just magically does things, and is able to do amazing things, just to further the plot.

The result was the movie is pretty, very very pretty.  It's also very predictable, and is a paint by numbers evil tech vs noble savage plot.  Also the message I got from it at the end is that humanity has no hope.  Anyway if all your looking for is something cool to watch, your not going to do better than Avatar.

3934174,5,B002HEXVUI,"This is my first time writing a review for a film on Amazon.  I must though regarding this movie.

Let me start by saying I LOVED this movie.  I will start by addressing the negative reviews though.

People are calling this a tree hugging, post consumer, global warming, anti American (or Anti Human), Anti Military etc, etc, etc....

This plot has been used for many years even in table top games like Mechwarrior.  Here in this movie a corporate interest is trying to mine a material for a profit and want to relocate the indigenous population whether they want to or not.  The people are trying to protect their way of life and their planet.

The military, if you listen, are all former (not ex Marines) who have been hired by the company to protect their interests.  It talks about how humans have taken over, and destroyed everything they have touched. (Don't want to spoil for those who have not watched so I won't go into more detail here).

I believe the director was just trying to paint a picture of a beautiful fantastic world and place a story in that setting.  How many of you would have watched a Planet Earth style show about the imagined planet Pandora.

In his CREATED world of Pandora the director touched me and my wife.  He made you feel the story and buy into it.  I did not leave this movie a converted tree hugger, environmentalist, anti militarism, or global warming protagonist.  Just like I did not leave any Harry Potter movie a wizard or a believer in such.

What I find ironic is the same anti consumer, anti human, anti military claims can be made about Aliens, Terminator, and Jurassic Park but I find those who hate this movie praising the others.

The bottom line, is this movie is a pleasure to watch.  This is the first movie I have ever enjoyed watching in 3D.  Halfway through the movie I told me wife we are seeing this movie again next time in IMAX 3D.  I could not help but being amazed by the CGI and effects.

Most movies with CGI and real video you can tell the difference, subtle as it may be you can tell.  Either the actors don't look directly at the created effect or you can see discolor and other issues.  In this movie I could not see the transition or misplacement.  Maybe on my home theater in blu ray I will be able to see the slight adjustments (I hope not) but maybe...

Some of the problems with adults is that they can not suspend reality to watch a movie.  Enjoy fiction for what it is fiction.  An attempt to entertain and inspire.

There are plenty of movies with underlying themes, Wizard of Oz, Saving Private Ryan, Clockwork Orange, Blade Runner, I Robot, Animal farm, etc, etc.  I do not believe this movie was an overt attempt at an ideological statement.  Cameron left that to others.  Matter of fact how many movies nowadays don't have ideological statements woven into them.  Heck even Diego and Dora on Nick are vessels for global warming, and green themes.  However the shows are still very educational and enjoyable for my children.  Most people look right past the underlying themes and enjoy the movie for what it is... a movie.

I hope if you have not seen this movie that you do.  Take your family and have a seat and just enjoy the movie.  If you want to have a ideological debate afterward so be it, but don't let it take away from the wonderment of this movie.

3934175,5,B002HEXVUI,"When this movie opened, it immediately became a milestone in cinematography and part of the film canon. It simply has to be seen. If the viewer can go with an open mind and a sense of wonder, so much the better. Much has been made of the tried and true plot, which is told enjoyably. However, the real point of the movie isn't the exploration of the Na'vi culture or even the exploration of corporate greed. The view at the beginning of the movie when the shuttle flies over the strip mining to land at the functional, technologically advanced, utilitarian human headquarter on Pandora sets the tone. The alien awesomeness of Pandora is presented for comparison. Then the clan psychic tells Jake, ""We shall see if your insanity can be cured.""

Cameron is saying we are the insane. Insane to have ravished our planet to the point we have, and to end up arguing among ourselves about the need to repair the damage. Jake isn't really taking to a tree. He is speaking to us. The message is plain. Earth itself may be waiting for our answer.",1262822400,,1036,4.540106951871658
3934176,5,B002HEXVUI,"Just got back from seeing it in stereo.  First, the 2k Dolby 3D digital projection was certainly not lacking in detail or contrast.  I'm even feeling a little home-sick for this Pandora planet.  About half way into it, besides the recent discomfort of the glasses starting to subside, I realized something:  I was having a visceral reaction to the stereoscopic, like our brains are hard-wired to suspend disbelief emotionally in a deeper way than we realize with stereo 3D when done right.  The reaction is involuntary.

Having been an early adopter of stereoscopic for flight simulators, helped people running remote-controlled aircraft use 3D head-mounted-displays, helped a helicopter flight school in Europe use the same gear for training, and with how distracting it was in the animated movie Up, I figured this would be distracting and rob the film of the artistry in composition.  I had concluded stereoscopic was great for games, simulators, and virtual presence, but not art.

Cameron and friends have created a new form of composition.  Avatar is universally a ground-breaking achievement in the arts.  And no one can tell me someone like Orson Welles wouldn't be agreeing with that.  Funny thing that humans have managed this.  I think perhaps the imperfection in the synthetic stereo like this is where the art is.  Perfectly-replicated real 3D vision, which would allow us free-moving selective focus, is replaced with this flawed but creatively useful technique.  Cameron's choices of deep focus, selective narrow focus, and the composition within each at any moment I think is what gives him the tools to control and sculpt it into art.  If it instead was exactly like looking into a window (which is impossible technically), it wouldn't have nearly the potential or effect for film-making.

I'm wondering, though, if Avatar is the moon, I mean the Apollo Program.  Will anyone be able to not just top it, but even equal it?  I have a hard time believing anyone but Cameron is in the position.  48 or 60fps stereo will give an order of magnitude higher fidelity throughout, not to mention for scenes with fast or numerous elements of motion.  But he's convinced me 3D was the correct route to take now even being constrained to 24fps with current bandwidths to the projectors.  I'm not sure if the live action for this one was filmed in 24fps, because it could even warrant a re-release when the projection is ready for higher.  Still, the strobe effect was not enough to abandon 3D or wait.  The experience of watching Avatar in stereo was almost a taste of the avatar experience of the characters inside the film.

As for those characters, I was astounded they managed to keep the eyes from looking dead and doll-like, as we saw in such CGI films as Final Fantasy.  All the range and drama was there, and I cared.  This is the polar-opposite of our reaction to Jar-Jar Binks.  Those head-mounted cameras and the painstaking rendering to match all the facial expressions, especially those eyes, paid off.  The real actors' performances captured are nuanced, moving, and powerful...the equal to the photographed variety.  After a while, I found them to actually look sharper and more vivid in some ways than the live action.  That's likely because Pandora was so colorful and alive, rather than some difference in apparent resolution.  Normal reality starts to look drab by comparison.  You can't help but feel that even more walking out of the theater.

Is the concept simple?  Is the name unobtainium meant as a joke?  What difference does the simplicity of the concept make or the proper name of a rock?  In my opinion the proof is in the execution.  This film is proof something small can be made grand, and there is far more than anyone can absorb in a single session in Avatar.  Perhaps the biggest compliment I can give is at 2 hours and 30 minutes it actually felt short, to the extent I wanted to sit through it again immediately or sit through a sequel.  Don't get me wrong.  It doesn't necessarily need more.  Avatar had a beginning, a middle, and a perfect ending.  The ending, and the film as a whole, proved James Cameron did not peak with a seminal masterpiece like Aliens, or plateau with blockbusters like Terminator 2 and Titanic.  He has redefined what ""Film"" is.  We're lucky to be alive to witness it.

To the young man I incidentally met at Wal-Mart not an hour after seeing Avatar who does not have the ability to perceive depth perception: my parents thought it was fantastic in 2D.

3934177,5,B002HEXVUI,"Well, it's true - the characterization is a bit derivative: the colonel really lusting to use his destructive power on the ""aliens"" who are rapidly cast as ""hostiles"" descends directly from Kilgore in ""Apocalypse Now""' - and then we have Jake doing the ""Dances with Na'vi."" But it doesn't matter. This is an amazing experience, a turning point in film craft. Visually incredible, it reminds me of Arthur C. Clarke's famous dictum, ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""

I do not believe any other movie has presented such a huge and total immersion in such a richly imagined and detailed - and let's say it, beautiful - environment. The 3-D of course has quite a lot to do with it: it works well - in the version I saw - with the comfortable and non-intrusive glasses one wears. These are not the old red-and-green things of yesteryear. I wore them over my regular glasses and was scarcely conscious they were there.

A sign that this is indeed a harbinger of things to come is that most of the trailers before the movie were for 3-D movies to be released this year. The question comes naturally: well, what's next? Smellavision? Feelyvision? (there have been experiments.)  It seems to me the next step is a more wrap-around experience. I want to see the Imax version: Imax is somewhat more immersive: but I'd like a theater constructed so that the screen subtends an angle of, say 150 degrees at the viewer's eye horizontally and maybe 120 vertically - enough so that you have to look just a little bit down to see the very bottom of the display and a little bit up to see the top.  Not so far round that you miss significant parts of the scene, but far enough that you are not aware of the physical theater apart from the row of heads in front of you.

I believe the military have 360 degree simulation environments, but presumably they only work for one or a very few viewers in the middle. Not the recipe for mass entertainment.

Heigh-ho - we are beginning to live in the world that the science-fiction writers of the 50's and 60's imagined.  The funny thing is, I suspect that even as the writers imagined their new technologies, many of them didn't really believe these things could be possible,at least not for a much longer time to come.

3934178,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is the most entertaining movie of this holiday season, IMHO.
I will only mention a few things since the plot is well described elsewhere.

The only place big enough to do the blue screen special effects for this movie in the actual hangar in North Beach (?) California where Howard Hughes built the huge airplane, The Spruce Goose! (See ""The Aviator"", another excellent movie).

Actors were fitted with sensors to articulate the subtle motions and body language of the special effects entities that appear on the screen. This has done before but never with this level of detail and accuracy. Actors actually jump down long distances from the top of the hanger on wires! Lifelike!

People involved in creating the movie must have done a lot of scuba diving, there are creatures on Pandora that are inspired by Feather Dusters, and Christmas Trees tube worms growing on the bottom of the ocean that disappear into their tube if you tickle them. Also the sentient seeds from the Tree of Life look like Baseball or Arcade jellyfish! There are creatures reminiscent of angry sharks. When the actors fly down the sides of the flying mountains on the pterodactyl-like birds, this reminds me of the vertical effects of diving down an underwater Wall. Or like rapelling fast down a cliff face. Moreso than any other movie I've ever seen, this is a vertical movie! The humans can't breathe the air of Pandora so they need to bring air or wear scuba gear on the planet surface. Natives of Pandora interact with each other and plants and animals through sensors in their tails.

A great adventure movie, one with heart! See it in the theaters with stadium seating and in 3D, don't wait for the video! Take the kids. My nominee for best picture.",1262736000,,1739,4.748344370860927

3934180,3,B002HEXVUI,"If someone wants to learn how to write a screenplay, i would say to study James Cameron's scripts. In terms of structure and dialogues, he's a true teacher. Not a Master. A teacher. When you listen to him in his DVD documentaries, you always learn something about story telling. And if you want to practice on your characters, he's the one to learn from as he always uses great, big archetype characters.

Archetype characters which in turn can bother other viewers for it makes for a very simple story line. Good guys. Bad guys. And the bad guys will die bad guys. Black and white.

That is the ONLY part of ""Avatar"" i didn't enjoy. The simplicity of the charcters. Not the obvious story line, mind you. Just the characters. There's nothing wrong with a simple story. After all, as a child, you always want your parent to read you the same old story as it is comforting. Sometimes, it's fun to watch a good old love story where you know how it's gonna end and that-you-want-it-to-end-that-way. But one-dimensionial characters can easyly get boring after a while. And Cameron's movies tend to last long. Not long in a bad way, though. But long enough that the characters are becoming a bit too simple.

But in terms of special effects, music, rythm of the scenes, logic of the script and emotion, this movie is truly a unique experience. To destroy this film is to be condescending. I don't think this should be nominated for BEST movie of the year but it is definetly a great entertaining work of art. You come out of it knowing that you've seen Cinema change. Like seeing ""Star Wars"" back in 1977. Or ""Terminator 2, Judgment Day"" in 91. Even ""Jurassic Park"" in 93. History has been made. We're starting to get use to it with James Cameron.

But i don't see why he insists on giving us one-dimensional characters. It's frustrating cause it undermines his movies in a way that it keeps them from being truly memorable. And he has clearly a superior intelligence. Listen to him for christ's sake! He's a teacher.

And you know he can write a good story with great characters. To this day, i still think that ""The Abyss"" was his best film. His most personal one. Of course, Ed Harris has something to do with it but still, i've never seen a superior Cameron film.

""Avatar"" is a GREAT experience that you sould not miss. It is not a great film but it is a GREAT piece of entertainment. The ""Where-were-you-when-it-came-out"" kind of experience.

It's funny but my favorite part is the... end. When, along with the music, we see the aliens implore Mother-Nature and the hero open his eyes (like in the beginning - i told you: teacher as far as structure goes) in his avatar body and the title fills the whole screen.

3934182,5,B002HEXVUI,"First, if you have any interest in spectacle and special effects, it's definitely worth it to see it in 3D.  The effects are well done, realistic, sometimes exciting and often beautiful, and do gain a lot from the depth perception.  The glasses are light, no more distracting than lightly shaded sunglasses, fit over other glasses comfortably, and work.  In some places you can see it in an IMAX theater.  All the better with the larger screen and high resolution.

Avatar combines the futuristic graphic novel feel and some themes of the director's earlier Aliens and Terminator movies with plot elements and more reflective themes paralleled in films like Dances with Wolves and The Mission.  A soldier is sent to a planet to help deal with the natives so mining can proceed and ends up being drawn to their way of life.  The rather big wrinkle is that he does so via an avatar, a bioengineered native body that he controls with his mind.  A further wrinkle is that he's paraplegic and his avatar isn't.  There's a central romance, a planet full of exotic beauty, American Indianish spirituality, lots of adventure, and a huge battle climax.

It isn't all that deep intellectually or especially witty in dialogue, and it's predictable, but with the wonderful physical setting and archetypal themes, it still has a visceral impact.  I was into it the whole way.  It shows evidence of having been thought through very carefully.  Even though it's two hours and forty-two minutes long, everything fits well and has a purpose in the overall.  It went by pretty quickly for me.

The acting is good.  The main good guy, Sam Worthington, is a bit like a young (but post-Disney) Kurt Russell.  The main bad guy, Stephen Lang, is impressively rugged, and threatens to steal all the scenes he's in.  Everyone fits their part well.

The message, to the extent there is one, is mixed in the same way it so often is in violent movies with themes about higher spirituality.  It does satisfy some low blood lust on its way to the higher good.  It's clearly done with kids in mind, with some swearing but no sex.  The kids I know who have seen it have loved it, all teens though.

If you have any inclination to see this, do it while it's still in theaters.  It won't be as overwhelming on the small screen.  Really, it's worth it in 3D.",1262649600,2,2323,4.648648648648648

She wasn't supposed to be the same character so I would get over that point if I were you!  The movie is supposed to entertain and I feel it did just that.  The special effects were a plus!

3934185,3,B002HEXVUI,"AVATAR is a visual feast. And at an estimated $280 million to make, it had better be. James Cameron, best known for spending as much money as he can on a project (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titanic/dp/B00000JLWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titanic</a>&nbsp;and his other flicks that have given him the nickname ""The $200 million dollar man""), leads the way again as writer/director. And with him comes Aussie actor Sam Worthington who also starred in Cameron's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-Salvation/dp/B001FB55I0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator Salvation</a>&nbsp;film.

As stated at the beginning, this is a highly stylized, visual film that has 3-D effects galore. You feel like you're riding on the back of some faraway creature as it dives through clouds, brushes the forest tops, and skims floating cliff faces. It is THIS that gives most, if not all, of the film's entertainment punch. If you didn't see it in 3-D, then you're missing out on the best part of the movie.

But where the film falls down is its story. This film is basically a rip-off of two ideas:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dances-with-Wolves/dp/B00008PBZZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dances with Wolves</a>&nbsp;and Frank Herbert's lesser known Pandora series of books (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Destination-Void/dp/0425018644/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Destination: Void</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jesus-Incident/dp/B000RK9FRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jesus Incident</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lazarus-Effect/dp/0441475213/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lazarus Effect</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ascension-Factor/dp/0517031892/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ascension Factor</a>). In fact, Wes Studi, who starred in Dances With Wolves as a tough Pawnee Indian, holds a similar role here in Avatar as the roughshod Eytukan. Granted, this is a space epic, but the transfer of ideas from Dances With Wolves still holds very true: A white man comes into native country, battles with them, learns to respect them, switches allegiances, helps save the natives from complete annihilation. This is pure Dances With Wolves.

As far as Frank Herbert's Pandora series goes, there's quite a few similarities. The first big one is the planet. In both Frank's and Cameron's universes, the planet is called Pandora. Nothing to get in a fuss about since the mythology of Pandora is well known since the time of the early Greeks. But where the similarities merge is with the planet itself. In both universes, the planet is alive. Literally. And this living force has a name. On Frank Herbert's Pandora, it is a life force known as Avata (hmmm, that sounds familiar too). On Cameron's Pandora, it is known as Eywa. Both planets are hostile to humans but are valuable in their own way (for Frank Herbert is was the expansion of humanity, and for James Cameron a rich mineral source).

So for those out there that are touting how ""original"" this is, I think you just haven't remembered (or weren't around) when actor/director Kevin Costner filmed his western epic and/or haven't read Frank Herbert's Pandora series (starting with Destination: Void and going through The Ascension Factor).

All this being said, Avatar is entertaining. It has that big-screen appeal and escapism that so many movie-goers pine for. And it has some of the best visual effects you'll ever see. But just don't tell me it's ""original.""",1262649600,7,3724,6.591836734693878

3934187,4,B002HEXVUI,"Don't get me wrong. This was a very impressive endeavor in IMAX 3-D, with astounding special effects, a solid script and good acting, but it's like watching an ultra-expensive futuristic version of ""Dances with Wolves,"" except that the main character in ""Avatar"" pulls a ""Capt. Kirk at Starfleet Academy"" move and changes the ending so the natives win.

Stephen Lang is awesome as the head of security in this movie and it's nice to see him get a great role. Giovanni Ribisi is also great to watch as the corporate guy focused on the bottom line. Excellent choices.

There were, however, a few issues, such as: 1) Why is it no big deal to transport billions of tons of people and equipment to a planet with a non-breathable atmosphere, hostile wildlife and resistant humanoid life forms, but getting ""unparalyzed"" is a hideously expensive venture? 2) How did Sam Worthington get some of the corniest lines you've ever heard in a movie? 3) Why didn't the humans just map out their various target locations from space and use tactical nukes (or something else), thereby eliminating the need for the line-of-sight mission at the end of the movie? I almost laughed when I saw a bunch of guys trying to shove a load of explosives out the cargo bay. 4) Why is it that the avatar technology (i.e. the brain link between human and avatar) works anywhere on the planet, but guidance systems, FLIRs, etc. don't? Despite all these quibbles, Cameron and crew did a fantastic job and have raised the cinematic expectations of the movie-going public.

The actors all did an excellent job and seemed totally realistic which for a sci-fi movie is an achievement in itself.  All in all an excellent movie BUT and that is a very big BUT -- the screen play was trite and message ridden to the point of annoyance.  The military as usual were  portrayed as ignorant savages bent solely on mindless destruction.  The Earthlings had already raped and destroyed Mother Earth and were now on a mission to rape and destroy another planet in the name of corporate greed.  This was a transparent metaphor for how the white man raped and destroyed North America crushing the Indians who were at one with the land.  However, this propaganda ridden screen play ran up against reality because natives armed with bows and arrows cannot stand against modern weapons and technology.  So the ridiculous author of this even more ridiculous screen play had to throw in attacks by heavily armored animals who were impervious to all weapons in order to orchestrate the very obvious and necessary victory over the military and greedy corporate rapists -- the message being that Mother Nature would rebel against greed and the raping of the planet.

3934191,5,B002HEXVUI,"In case you haven't seen the more revealing trailers, Avatar's story falls in the family of films like Pocahontas or Tarzan - the clash of two disparate worlds. A human company has arrived at Pandora to mine for a very valuable rock, but there's a village of natives, the Na'vi, who are sitting on a large deposit of this rock. Sam Worthington's character is part of the Avatar program, in which a human's being can be transferred to a genetically engineered Na'vi version of himself, to try to learn from the Na'vi and find a way to get this village to move. I know that sounds like I just spoiled the whole movie for you, but that all probably happened in the first 20 minutes. It's literally nearly 3 hours long, so a lot happens in it. I'd say 4 major acts, in all.

There are some movies that you can look at over the history of film making and know that they are classics for one reason or another. On my short list of classics would be Chinatown, The Godfather, The Matrix, Star Wars: A New Hope, and Raiders of the Lost Ark. You can say what you will about them, but they're definitely classics. If I had an honorable mentions list it'd probably include Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, but neither of those series' starting movie was as important as the movies I just listed (which is obviously not an exhaustive list). I think Avatar is a movie we're going to look back on as a big deal in science fiction films and probably in films, in general.

I heard all this hype about the movie but didn't buy any of it because the movie didn't look interesting to me. I was as big a skeptic as they come and insulted that James Cameron claimed a CG movie was an innovation, even if it was 3-D. Both those technologies had already existed, so what was the big deal? Well, he was right: I don't think I've ever been so impressed with computer graphics before in my life. He was able to map his actors/actress's faces to their computer-generated forms to display real emotions. It's phenomenal. I felt more for these characters than many movies I've seen with live action movies. As for being in 3-D - it looks amazing in 3-D. It's no longer that stupid gimmick at your local science museum from when you were little where at special moments you'd put on these gigantic classes to see something silly coming at you. It's not a gimmick at all in this movie, in fact - it's a part of how you experience the movie. It makes everything very palpable to the point that I don't know how I'd react to some scenes if I saw them in 2-D. The idea of depth of field you get in some scenes is very valuable for conveying a lot of information to you without having to spend a lot of time on it or just use camera tricks. To not see this movie in 3-D is a disservice to yourself since seeing it in 2-D will be easy once it's out on home video. Back to just the visuals though: the level of detail in this movie is awe-inspiring. You definitely willfully would forget that the world you're seeing isn't real and that these creatures are just computer generated - they're that realistic. Part of what makes you believe is that when you see scenes that didn't need to be computer generated - the scenes between just humans - they don't look computer generated at all. If you see this movie for nothing else other than to enjoy it as a visual feast then it was well worth the price of admission.

When it comes to the acting and writing, you start entering somewhat thorny territory. I enjoyed the story more than I thought it would. It was somewhat formulaic but still epic and engaging. It wasn't as predictable as I thought it would be, and I was still happy with the direction it went in. Some of the writing came off to me as a little kludgy and corny. Strangely, I found myself moved even by a couple of the cornier scenes. The acting by most of the leads was strong, especially Sigourney Weaver, Sam Worthington, and Zoe Saldana. Giovanni Ribisi never made sense to me though and Stephen Lang's role as the Colonel felt hollow and stereotypical. I think that's more due to the writing than his portrayal though. I did find myself enjoying Michelle Rodriguez as the same character she always plays, but I have a soft spot for her so I was ok with that. The movie was definitely way too long. I don't know what they could've done about that, but it was quite long. To be honest, I enjoyed it enough that I didn't mind sitting through all of it, but I can see other people losing interest during the slower parts. The set up of the film feels like a bunch of scenes I won't want to watch whenever I get it on Blu-ray, but once it gets going it really does fly by. It reminds me a bit of the end of a Metal Gear Solid game where the ending keeps getting prolonged. I know I'm saying a lot of bad stuff here, but the writing was good overall and I thought the language they created was actually kind of cool. All the Na'vi characters were very cool and well-designed.

The bottom line is that you have to see this movie. There's no reason to not go out and see this movie in 3-D if you're in a place that has it in 3-D. If you do not you will almost certainly regret it. Whether or not you like sci-fi, this is an important movie to see right now in theaters. Even if you don't love it like I did, you will at least appreciate the significance of the technology at play here. Even the people I knew who didn't love it definitely didn't hate it, so I think it's a fair bet that you won't hate it either. It'll almost certainly come out on Blu-ray in 3-D, possibly the first movie to do so, but unless you're rich I'm guessing that you're not getting a 3-D TV set and this is one of the very few movies where 3-D adds to the experience. If you see it in 3-D and hate it then you can yell at me about it later. My overall score for Avatar is an A-.",1262476800,,5831,4.25045045045045

However, as a screenwriter, Cameron resorts to familiar clichs and often corny dialogue in this unwieldy amalgamation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Land-of-the-Lost/dp/B002IKIHEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Land of the Lost</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dances-with-Wolves/dp/B00008PBZZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dances with Wolves</a>. Character development and original dialogue have never been his strong suits, and fortunately, these shortcomings are not as pronounced as they were with ""Titanic"". At the same time, I really wish he could have seen the benefit of a writing collaborator who could have made something more provocative out of the arresting science-fantasy premise and ultimately push this movie toward the echelon of being one for the ages.

Set in 2154, the fanciful story focuses on Jake Scully, a paraplegic former Marine who has been recruited for a special mission by the U. S. Armed Forces because he's a genetic match for his dead identical twin. The mission is to Pandora, an earth-sized moon in orbit around a massive star, which gives life to minerals that the Earth needs after centuries of abuse and desecration. Pandora's native inhabitants deep in the planetary forest are the blue-skinned Na'vi, a race of slender, agile twelve-foot giants who are at one with their natural environment. In order for humans to connect with the Na'vi, avatars have been created from their DNA, which allows select humans to become Na'vi look-alikes on Pandora, while still being mind-controlled by the original humans wired up on the hovering ship. Physically, there is no difference between the avatars and the Na'vi, but their inner selves reflect a great divide in sensibilities and priorities of which only Scully seems to know how to traverse the deep spiritual chasm.

From that premise comes the inevitable love story (Scully falls for the brave, soulful Neytiri) and of course, the equally inevitable showdown between the Na'vi and the increasingly aggressive military forces led by the gung-ho Colonel Miles Quaritch. The similarities between the peace-loving Na'vi and Native Americans are purely intentional down to the earthly wisdom and the yelping battle cries. Horses have been replaced with pterodactyl-like flying creatures with which the Na'vi connect through intriguingly sensual tubes of dancing cilia. There are other layers of allegory, but Cameron focuses more on the story's visceral thrills rather than bothering to elucidate the government's motivation behind the avatar program, especially since the program director, Dr. Grace Augustine, appears completely out of sync with the corporate-military brain trust almost from the outset. It's pretty clear that none of these nuances matter once the climactic battle occurs, a genuinely masterful sequence that brings the digital technology to a whole new level.

For a movie like this to work, the characters are merely presented to support the action and supply a recognizable set of emotions which an audience doesn't have to think about. Toward that end, the cast is effective in a workman-like manner. Sam Worthington (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-Salvation/dp/B001FB55HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator Salvation</a>) plays Scully appropriately like a young Clint Eastwood type, never complicating the character more than Cameron allows. Zoe Saldaa's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B002HWRYJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>) role consists primarily of digital performance capture since her character doesn't have a human counterpart. She lends a palpable voice to Neytiri even though the Na'vi facial expressions remind me of those of the aliens at the end of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Close-Encounters-of-the-Third-Kind/dp/B000VECACG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>.

Sigourney Weaver, who starred in Cameron's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00012FXAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>&nbsp;23 years earlier, contributes a few, sassy scene-stealing scenes as Grace.

3934195,5,B002HEXVUI,"This Sci-Fi film, with its unique blend of fantasy and reality, developed with the painstaking use of both CGI and 3D technologies, overtakes them all and should take the Oscar as the best film of 2009. Avatar is a basic story of an evil empire of infinite superiority invading a lush, paradisian rain forest on the planet Pandora in order to plunder its vital mineral resources. Unfortunately, the mining operations on the planet must take place at a location occupied by a civilization of tall, blue, large-eyed, gentle inhabitants, the Na'vi. And, also unfortunately, it's the Marines who are tasked to ensure that the job gets done, in the event that Avatars cannot talk the peaceful tribe into giving up their Eden-like homeland. Avatars are scientific transformations of humans designed to look like the Na'vi for the purpose of infiltrating and studing them.

Acting is more than adequate and all the characters are both likable and credible: Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, the disabled ex-marine whose avatar clone makes friends with the Na'vi and who falls in love with the cute Na'vi princess, Neytiri played by Zoe Saldana; Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Grace Augustine, the scientist responsible for Avatar development and experimentation; Stephen Lang as the mean, single-minded Colonel Miles Quaritch, leader of the marine assault force; and Michelle Rodriguez, as the enthusiastic marine chopper pilot.

Obviously, the time spent developing the blue Na'vi animations and the lush jungle landscape results in a mind boggling scenic stage for the actors and primitive creatures to interact. The colors, flora, jaguars, and perydactyl-like birds are impressively rendered. The Na'vi animations are about as visually realistic as they can be, and as the story unfolds, and it becomes clearer what they have to lose, they become worthy of your sympathy as they suffer through the brutal invasion.

The only aspect I disliked was the use of ""shock and awe"" to describe the Marines'impending attack of the Na'vi, an obvious jab by Cameron to compare it with U.S. invasion of Iraq, a mission to stop evil. It certainly does nothing to convince anyone in the world that the U.S. is on a mission to fight evil and terrorism. I found this disturbing because of what takes place later in the battle scenes. On the whole though, I can look at the marines in this movie as perhaps being part of a rouge group that violates their original orders to protect rather than assault - that works for me.

But don't let any ""message"", intended or unintended, ruin your viewing entertainment. It is in the end, an extremely good movie, and it will transport you into an incredible world. The movie will be perfect for your home theater when it's released.",1262476800,,2741,5.004385964912281

3934200,1,B002HEXVUI,"Science Fiction Version of Dances with Wolves

PLOT: Evil humans have depleted the natural resources of Earth. An evil corporation from Earth with the assistance of evil military from Earth tried to rape another planet of its natural resources to fuel humans' insatiable need for technology and power and kill the indigenous people who get in the way. When the evil ones are about to kill the indigenous people's deity, the indigenous people retaliate against the evil corporation from Earth and evil military from Earth with unfettered hatred (indigenous people incorporated high tech weapons from the humans to help them fight). When the indigenous people are about to be defeated, their deity intervenes and saves the planet (Mother Nature triumphantly does to the humans what they were going to do to her and her people). Once the evil military is thwarted, all the humans except for a few (those who have been enlightened) are forced off of the planet never to return. Those who are left behind have the privilege of living in a utopia and replacing their evil human bodies to take on the perfect anatomy of the indigenous people and worship Mother Nature who slaughtered thousands of humans.

AGENDA: Couldn't they find a cheaper and more honest way of promoting green (350 million dollar propaganda commercial). Leave all the resources in the ground and kill corporate giants was the message. I wonder how much of the movie used green technology. Like most of Hollywood, they never practice what they preach.

CHARACTERS: The villains of the movie were way over the top, unbelievable. Most were based on false premises--political caricatures of corporate giants and the military. Most of the heroes were static; they lacked any character flaws. Sully had the greatest transformation both psychologically and physically. In the beginning, the evil military forced Sully to fight in a war where he lost the use of his legs from injury. At the end of the movie, the perfect indigenous people and their deity gave Sully a perfect body because he denounced his evil human race and adopted the perfect way of the perfect indigenous people.

SERMON: The whole movie hinged on the idea that those who live as one-with-nature and are absent of all technology are better. And those who use natural resources to create technology are evil. And that all the comforts in modern human society have been created at the expense of those who are one-with-nature. BALDERDASH! Avatar was the science fiction version of Dances with Wolves. It was high technology that produced the movie. Its writers drive high tech cars, its producers live in mansions, and its actors live in the lap of luxury. This was the biggest propaganda since Hitler and his anti Jewish movement.

PREACHY: WOW! While watching this movie, I kept having flash backs to hellfire and brimstone sermons I had to hear growing up in church. Half way through, I was expecting the movie to pause so that we could sing hymns to MOTHER NATURE while ushers passed around offering plates. When the movie ended, I was also expecting the high priest of the church of environmentalology, Al Gore, and his prophet, James Cameron, to step out and usher everyone to the altar for repentance where cups of Cool Aid would be distributed to all new converts.

WHY ONE STARS: The CGI was phenomenal, the fictitious world was awesome, the action was great, and the whole avatar concept to interact with the indigenous people was brilliant. But these elements alone do not merit a five star rating.",1262390400,14,3535,4.942760942760943

3934203,5,B002HEXVUI,"At this point, a mere two weeks into Avatar's premier run in the theatres, it's trite to say that the filmaking is revolutionary.  Cameron establishes himeslf as the master filmaker of our generation, surpassing Spielberg, I think, for the history books.  Avatar is a magnificent work of the imagination, magnificent in that the makers were able to transfer the vision into the media. Putting the 3-D specs on really brings ya back half a century - though Real 3-D is a technological advance with Real potential - and the feeling is ironically apt - from the ""Dances with Wolves"" perspective of the story. Unequivocally, my favorite part of the film (and I love blues and greens and fine romance) is the critique of the basic ignorant, violent, imperialist, ethnocentric, exploitive, cruel, arrogant, and jarheadly stupid foreign and environmental policy which has characterized the American pursuit of privilege and exceptionalism - from the four plus century old genocide of the Native American to the present misguided insanity (given a good shot in the arm by the 1947 establishment of the Dept of Defense) which some have the temerity to call ""conservative"" foreign policy. As the heart of the movie-going audience is aged 8-18, Cameron couldn't have guided his arrow any better, despite evident glitches along the periphery of the storyline.  A great film - and I hope - no, pray - that people FINALLY get the POINT!!!",1262390400,3,1424,5.02542372881356
3934204,2,B002HEXVUI,"""Avatar"" is an assault on the senses.  Filmed in 3D, it is grand on a truly colossal scale.  The viewer cannot help but be impressed or, potentially, overwhelmed.  Apparently twelve years in the making, it is not difficult to see why.  But, ""Avatar"" is more a massive piece of computer driven effects than physical drama.

Infact, in spite of its enormous scale, I left the theatre after seeing ""Avatar"" somewhat disappointed.  The story line is weak and seems to be little more that a green tinged propaganda tale.  That is, greed is bad, the environment is sacred and anyone trying to do something different is evil.  The classic case of the little guy fighting back against the nasty capitalists.  I really do tire of the types of stories.  There is good and bad in all clashes.  It is rarely limited to just one side.

I have little doubt that ""Avatar"" will be an outstanding cinematic success.  It has taken the industry in general and science fiction in particular to a whole new level.  If one were to compare ""Avatar"" with, say, ""Jurassic Park"" of some twenty years ago, the advances in cinematic technology are only too apparent.  ""Jurassic Park"" almost looks like the original version of ""King Kong"".  It is clunky where ""Avatar"" is seamless and smooth.

But for all its technological wizardry, ""Avatar"" fails to deliver the goods.  It has a weak story line, clear prejudices and far from outstanding acting.  I'm sure my criticisms will do nothing to prevent people from seeing it.  It is, at the risk of repeating myself, a truly great experience and technically stupendous.  It's just a shame that it has nothing else to offer.",1262304000,7,1640,4.765124555160142

3934206,5,B002HEXVUI,"The excitement had been building for a couple of days. Finally the day had come. We were going to see the Imax 3D Avatar experience on the opening day for the 11:30 matinee.  We piled in the car and drove the 20 plus miles into town to the downtown IMAX theater. We got our popcorn and drinks and picked up our 3D glasses. Entering the screen room, we were pleasntly surprised to find good seats right in the middle about half way up. Everyone was chattering away and I could feel the anticipation in the air. We enjoyed the previews for upcoming movies, especially the 3D preview for the upcoming Alice in Wonderland, with the Cheshire Cat floating in front of your nose.

Then the movie started and we sat mesmerized, no....stunned is a better word, right up to the very end. I have two words to describe this movie: Absolutely Astounding! James Cameron out did himself with this movie. The color, the effects, the acting were superb. There are a lot of big special effects movies these days and for most of them, that's the most you can say. But like all of Cameron's films, this one has a great story. The actors are so convincing in their roles that you become involved in their lives. When a movie can elicit deep emotions from the audience like anger, concern, sadness, and joy for the characters then it can only be regarded as a great film. I thought Segourney Weaver did an outstanding job, as always, playing the gruff Dr. Grace Augustine. I liked the way her personality shifts, when she is in her avatar Na'vi body, to the sweet and concerned teacher of children. And I can't say enough about the performance of Zoe Saldana, unknown to me before this movie, for her portrayal of the Na'vi ""princess"" Neytiri. The passion, expression, and emotion she puts into this role makes her alien character totally believable.

I will not talk about the plot for this movie because I don't like revealing spoilers. Suffice it to say that if you choose not to see this movie, especially in 3D and if possible in IMAX, then you will be missing a singularly unique experience you may never get another chance at. I doubt that any 3D DVD or blu-ray version that comes out could possibly do this film justice. Recall the dismal failures for the Polar Express and Journey to the Center of the Earth. Now, after writing this review, I realize I have to go and see it again. I know my kids will want to.",1262304000,15,2397,4.505747126436781
3934207,2,B002HEXVUI,"If you've read any of the reviews of Avatar, one thing you keep hearing is that this is essentially Kevin Costner's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dances-with-Wolves/dp/B00008PBZZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dances with Wolves</a>&nbsp;mixed with James Cameron's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00012FXAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>. The plot is almost an exact replica of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dances-with-Wolves/dp/B00008PBZZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dances with Wolves</a>, with the disillusioned marine joining the alien natives and fighting against the white occupiers. Only in this version, the natives are blue-skinned aliens rather than Lakota and the occupiers are space marines along the lines of the troops in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00012FXAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>&nbsp;rather than Col. Custer's cavalry. Since I love both of these movies, and being something of a sci-fi geek, I had high hopes for Avatar. However, I found myself somewhat disappointed.

First the good. The special effects were indeed impressive. The aliens, the Navi, really do look realistic, even when next to live actors. I generally thought the computer-generated plants and animals looked like real living organisms rather than cartoonish creations. The planet where all the action takes place, Pandora, is beautiful. Cameron's concept design and art departments must have had a lot of fun. I love the bioluminescent plants that glow at night. Even though I wasn't crazy about Avatar the movie, I would definitely want to take an eco-tourism vacation to Pandora and learn more about the wildlife.

Now, the disappointments. Avatar's plot is just too unoriginal, too cliche. I'm not accusing Cameron of copying any particular movie. Obviously, the concept of the ""noble savage"" have been around for a while (at least since de Montainge utilizes it during the late 1500s). However, Avatar just bears too strong a resemblance to too many other movies, from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FernGully-The-Last-Rainforest/dp/B000A9QK78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FernGully: The Last Rainforest</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1492-Conquest-of-Paradise/dp/B000J0UD94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1492: Conquest of Paradise</a>. However, Cameron's embellishments to these prior plots are only skin-deep - literally. Despite living light years away on another world, the Navi are almost identical to Western stereotypes of the Noble Savage among Native American tribes: from the braided hair to communicating with animals to the communal/egalitarian society to the use of bows and arrows. At least design some other weapon besides bows and arrows (a boomerang might have been a neat idea for a primitive weapon)!

Second, I felt the special effects really overwhelmed the movie. Of course, as mentioned above, the special effects were very impressive - but that's not enough to make a good movie. Too many times, it seems like somebody in the art department had a bunch of crazy ideas and nobody really bothered to ask whether they would advance the plot. For example, the movie features floating mountains. Really? I'm willing to suspend my disbelief (after all, I was willing to accept the Force in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Trilogy/dp/B001EN71DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars Trilogy</a>), but I don't get why the movie really needed floating mountains as opposed to really tall ones. (incidentally, if you want to see a really interesting an original idea of what an alien planet might actually look like, check out the documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Planet/dp/B002C39T2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Planet</a>).

Finally, the villains of the movie, the human occupiers, were generally two-dimensional characters (despite the 3-D glasses I was wearing). They were simply greedy corporate raiders and mercenaries - something we've seen dozens of times before. Almost no internal conflict, no remorse whatsoever (only the ""good guys"" are allowed to feel remorse). This is the type of movie when you really enjoy seeing the ""bad guys"" getting beaten at the end - they really do deserve it. However, there are no memorable ""bad guys"" in Avatar who rise to the level of a Darth Vader or Gollum or Khan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-II-The-Wrath-of-Khan/dp/B002I9Z8B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan</a>) or even a Lord Voldemort (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince/dp/B002PMV9FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a>). This is important, because I think one of the things that separates good fantasy/sci-fi from great is the presence of a deep, complex villain.

So, did Avatar live up to the hype? Unfortunately, I don't think so. Don't, get me wrong - it's a good movie and decent entertainment, certainly worth renting when it comes out on DVD. The moral of not conquering other peoples and respecting the environment are worthy. I just don't think that, 10 years from now, we'll be raving about this movie the same way fans still obsessively watch The Lord of the Rings or Star Wars. There's no spark of originality or really cool characters that make Avatar worth watching again - much less make it last for decades.",1262304000,45,5755,6.7077747989276135
3934208,5,B002HEXVUI,"This movie will have all other directors and producers asking themselves ""How can we ever compare?""  It is simply that good.",1262304000,3,124,4.904761904761905
3934209,3,B002HEXVUI,"First, let me say that I enjoyed this movie in spite of myself.  I had even hesitated to go see it.  There was so much that seemed wrong, including the fact that most of Hollywood gets science fiction wrong.  They just don't know what to do with it, other than make grandiose and visually spectacular films that almost always lose sight of the essence of the original story.

Second, ""Avatar"" turned out to be what I feared most:  a collection of cliches and SF stories that have been around for decades.  For instance, the idea of a human's essence occupying another form in a hostile world while the real body lies sleeping in a seemingly safe environment (my own short story, ""Jessica's Body"" is just one of many).  Or the human who is part of a force that is supposed to help conquer an alien world and in the end turns into one of the aliens, or whose heart is turned by the plight both of the world and the aliens (e.g., Judgment on Janus by Andre Norton or Enemy Mine by Barry Longyear).

Third, there are the noble savage cliches that have been around for decades in the movies, for centuries in literature.  The film ""Dances with Wolves"" comes to mind, of course.  But there is also ""Last of the Dogmen"" with Tom Berenger, less popular, but more interesting in several ways.  This goes hand-in-hand with saving the world from industrialization and abuse, found even in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy.

All told, there is nothing really original in this movie:  Even the 3-D format, animation, mix of animation and live action.  Nothing.  Yet, it is a beautiful film, the world so different, and the ways of the people so appealing.  Even if their story has been done many times before, it seems that each generation must renew the hope and idealism expressed for our own world, ourselves, and the future.  Americans are known for favoring the underdog, even if it's counter to our human goals.  We admire and favor those who have the courage to stand up against greater odds.

So, it's easy to get sucked into such a story when told so realistically and beautifully.  No, there is nothing new in ""Avatar,"" if one looks back on literature and film of the past.  It is a retelling of a story for this generation and I'm glad I saw it.",1262304000,8,2246,4.523573200992556
3934210,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar was beyond doubt, and without a close competitor, the most spectacular movie that I've seen. Even in flatscreen it would likely have been dazzling; in 3-D it was simply breathtaking. The world Pandora was like Oz and Wonderland and Middle Earth blended together, but far transcended any of those other places.

On top of the visual feast, the story was good, too; after the initial set-up of the plot, there literally was not a slow moment in the movie. It was, however, very much a political and a religious statement in favor of Green and Gaian principles. These were presented so compellingly, however, that even the strong Republican-Evangelicals with whom I watched the movie cheered for the natives trying to save their homes from, and the rouge humans who helped them in their struggle against, the strip-mining corporation ready to ruin a world for its natural resources.

Aside from its politico-religious aspects, the story was one that Edgar Rice Burroughs and his imitators have written over and over: an outcast human finds redemption, purpose, and fulfillment on a hostile and hazardous alien world. Seldom, however, has the story been told better than James Cameron told it, and never has it been illustrated more gorgeously. The next movie that I see will be Avatar -- I hope still in 3-D.",1262217600,4,1312,4.959090909090909
3934211,3,B002HEXVUI,"With all the hoopla surrounding Avatar, I hate to stink up the party but I just didn't think this movie was all that. I went to the theater concerned that it would be just another special effects extravaganza in search of a plot. As it turned out, Avatar is somewhat better than that, but only just barely. In fact, I think that the plot was a very good one the last time that it was used by Kevin Costner on the plains of the American mid-west. But that was twenty years ago. That said, my biggest disappointment was actually with the 3-D. I did not find this particular version of 3-D technology to be all that convincing. Apparently this technology requires that everything be shot with a very narrow depth of field, because everything on the screen except for the exact focal point of the scene was always a little out of focus. By the end of the movie I had a slight headache from the constant eye strain of trying to bring the scenery into focus. Also, I think that Mr. Cameron missed an opportunity when he elected to shoot all of the action sequences in traditional third person perspective. The 3-D effect would have had a lot more visual impact had he shot those scenes from the first person perspective. All in all I found Avatar to be good solid escapist entertainment, but not much else.",1262217600,2,1300,4.466386554621849
3934212,5,B002HEXVUI,"Anyone who hasn't yet seen this movie - especially in IMAX 3-D as it is meant to be seen - is in for not only an epic movie - but a true breakthrough in movie-making historic technology.

And James Cameron does it with aplomb. He doesn't forget to give you a character-driven, explosive action-filled epic along the way. Most directors would be lost in just the special effects. Not Cameron. He gives you everything!

That's why the Box office sales are going through the roof.

So please, don't listen to those few bad reviews. They obviously are either purely false, just to stand out, or they are the typical paper reviewer who wouldn't know a great movie if they tripped over it. If you leave AVATAR without feeling some kinf of pump-up exileration, you just don't have a hearbeat.

Sure James Cameron borrowed from classics. There are tones of everything from Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan to historic tones like those of Native Americans walking the Road of Tears. But Avatar still manages to stay fresh and true of its own accord.

There are several messages to this beautiful film that certainly ring true for today's movie-going audience. WE MUST STAY GREEN.

But after watching this fil 4 times now, it never gets old to feel like I'd rather be a 10-foot blue Avatar Na'Vi than a nearly 6-foot human any day of the week.

Without a doubt, AVATAR is going to run away with numerous Oscars. And it should.

Goodbye Titanic.

Hello Avatar!

Trust me, its more than a great movie.

It is an experience.",1262217600,4,1507,4.649056603773585
3934213,3,B002HEXVUI,"First and foremost, the CGI in this movie is very well done and will no doubt win Oscars for those who created it. To be honest, I actually expected a little better after hearing all the buzz about this film's production costs and the technology that was going into it, but the CGI is certainly well done. That said, I wouldn't say this film surpasses other CGI-fests like the most recent ""Star Wars"" trilogy.

I paid an extra $3.50 per ticket to view this in 3D in the theater. I'm sorry to report that the new 3D technology isn't all it's hyped to be. On the plus side, this is the best 3D I've ever seen. By that, I mean it's not the blurry, nausea-inducing mess that 3D films using older technology were. On the negative side, I still developed a bit of a headache from watching this, and another adult and a twelve-year-old I was with did too. For the record, a message played at the start of the film said that the projector and screen were installed specifically for this type of 3D film, so it was not a problem of substandard equipment. The bigger turn-off for me was that the 3D is really not an enhancement to the film, it's a detracting factor. As improved as it may be, it still doesn't look like reality. It does give a greater sense of depth, just like older 3D films did, but there's still that gimmicky, hyper-reality look to it that just doesn't convince and actually detracts from your ability to get absorbed in the story. Unfortunately, we'll probably be fed a steady stream of 3D films from Hollywood from now on, following ""Avatar's"" success at the box office. This will be the last 3D film I pay to see.

The story has some interesting elements, but much of the basic plot was blatantly lifted from much earlier films like ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""The Last Samurai"": Military man lives among less advanced, indigenous group--learns their culture and language astonishingly fast--falls for their hottest woman--is converted to their way of life--and lastly joins them in a battle against his own kind. The stag-hunt scene from ""Last of the Mohicans"" is included here, and some of the most intriguing aspects of the forest bear a strong resemblance to ""Princess Mononoke"" (one of the best anime films ever made).  ""Avatar"" is fairly predictable, and there are no real plot twists or surprises along the way. Even many of the monsters portrayed have obvious counterparts in the real world (horses, rhinos, jackals, jellyfish). I might have become bored at times had it not been for the visual goodies. Aside from the interesting avatar concept--which could even be called a ripoff of ""The Matrix""--there really is very little that feels new in this film outside the realm of the excellent visual effects. I've deducted one star from my rating for what, at best, is a lack of originality in the story and, at worst, plagiarism.

The saving grace here is the CGI, which, as I said earlier, was very well done. The film also has a good cast.  I was especially impressed with Stephen Lang, who does a fine job playing the colonel.  He has a sort of Ed Harris toughness while being a new face for me.

""Avatar"" is definitely worth seeing for the impressive CGI effects, but if you've seen ""Dances with Wolves"" or ""The Last Samurai,"" don't expect a novel storyline. Best just to sit back and enjoy the visual ride.  On that level, at least, it does deliver.",1262217600,6,3373,4.619365609348915
3934214,2,B002HEXVUI,"OK, fine, the demographic Cameron was ordered to shoot for was 12 - 18 year olds and, geez, for the mutton heads who bury their minds in digital toys this kind of fare surely has its appeal.

Any ADULT raving about this film needs to get out a little more often, though.

For Gawd's sake, couldn't Cameron have hired a decent writer to blather about the pretty pictures on his tiresome slide show?  How about some nuance, character development (other than pubescence to early adolescence), or even a little plot twist (to reduce squirming)?  Naw - can't take ANY chances on a $300 million budget.  Nope - here we get the standard Hollywood line, from stem to stern.

Is there anyone, anyone, who gave a tiny rat's rear end about any of the neato cartoon action figures or, for that matter, any aspect of the inane plot?  Wow, what a stunner, the mercenary (former, of course, so as not to offend) marines are the bad guys who are out to exploit the goony aliens (ten feet tall, COOOOOLLLL!!!) who are as morally pure as the driven snow (YAWN) and as innocent as Forrest, uh, Forrest Gump.

Imagine Hollywood depicting white male military types as bad guys.  Haven't seen that in a while (well, since the last time I turned on my TV).

What really galls is all that utterly wasted technology.  It's outrageous, really, that one of the most visually arresting films of the past decade is so utterly devoid of meaning.  I've had epiphanies in the toilet more enduring than anything I learned from this shiny, noisome trip to the land of the purple ferret people.  And, just imagine, that some nincompoop actually got paid to ""invent"" the language of the Nervies.  Boy, that effort sure helped suspend disbelief, in between efforts to look at my watch.

It must be nice to wallow in one's adolescent wet dreams and get paid boatloads for your trouble.  It's just too bad, though, that Cameron's legacy here won't have anything to do with worthwhile cinema.  Maybe, just maybe, next time he'll try creating something for the 20-somethings that's a tad more worthwhile.",1262131200,7,2063,4.686111111111111
3934215,4,B002HEXVUI,"First and foremost, let me state this up front : 'Avatar' is probably, visually speaking, the most amazing movie that I have ever seen. Big words, yes, but an even bigger movie. I chose to see this film in 3-D (and if you have the option for either 3-D or IMAX, I highly recommend it), and it was almost overwhelming. I don't mean that in a negative sense, but it was just so visually vibrant, that it's almost impossible to take it all in. In fact, the thought of ""this will be the biggest selling blu-ray movie of all time"" actually popped into my head at one point.

All that said, I spotted this movie an extra star because of the visuals. In terms of a story, it's largely unoriginal. This isn't to say that this is a bad movie, but it mirrors to many extents 'Dances With Wolves' (a sentiment I've read and heard repeatedly, and can now verify).

The story is told through three very distinct acts. The first act, while setting up the story and establishing the character of Jake Sully (played by Sam Worthington), trods along at a snail's pace. In some ways, the visuals overlap the dull pace of the first act. The second act is told in classic fashion, and for fear of spoilers, I will not reveal more than that. The third act, also, is told in classic fashion.

While there was no bad acting in this movie, there was also no noteworthy acting in it, either. Therefore, I will not comment on the acting performances other than to say that nobody was bad, nobody was amazing. This is not the kind of movie that needs to rely on master thespians to carry it.

James Cameron found himself in a somewhat enviable predicament : he'd created one of the most popular and highest-grossing films of all time in 'Titanic', garnered every possible award, and was (yes, I'm going to say it) the king of the world. As a movie maker, where does one go from there? He was in near-obscurity for the better part of a decade, which might have been the right career move. In that time, 'Avatar' was born. He could have possibly needed 10 years to put together the visual seen in this movie. This film is very, very well-directed. In the hands of a lesser director, this movie could have easily been D.O.A. upon release.

Overall, 'Avatar' is a very entertaining movie, but I wouldn't call it a ""great"" movie. I sincerely believe it should win most (if not all) of the technical awards this season, but I do not feel it is deserving of the Oscar for Best Picture (thus far, my vote would be for 'Up In The Air', given the dynamic of the way the awards are given out). Given the gargantuan presentation of the movie, if you're at all inclined to see 'Avatar', I cannot recommend seeing it in 3-D or IMAX enough. For the visuals in this movie, it will be money well spent.",1262131200,4,2758,4.4

3934218,3,B002HEXVUI,"Here's a 2 hour 30 minute film which would have been a great two hour film. The central characters act well the two of them but beside them I thought the star-cast was particularly ""poultry"" and I didn't think they did justice to the film. But that's not my major complain.  I felt the film was a bit far drawn out with the whole 2154 scenario and men still chasing rocks and minerals. I mean, come on, let's be a little original here. Not a lot of backdrop on the Pandora before actually jumping into it made the film seem 2-sided which didn't do good.

The graphics, the acting of the central actors was commendable, of course. I absolutely loved those dragons that flew, easily the best part of the film. But what I didn't quite appreciate was the whole story of the villains being sold to me. That made the film lose it's impact and made it look rather predictable. Someone said this is the best film they've seen in a long time. I'm 25, a harsh critic, cause I give every single film half-worthy of being watched a go and I thought this film was good but not great.

This film will go on to break record and it's good to see movie goers actually give film like ""Avatar"" with true artistic intent credit rather than going for films like Twilight and making them blockbuster biggest hits. Out of all the blockbusters I watched in 2009, I thought District 9 was hands down the most original, the most thought provoking film.

I must give the film crew credit for making such an astounding piece of art but I felt it's a little far fetched calling this the best film they've seen in the last decade. The best film of this decade has to ""there will be blood"" in my humble opinion.",1262044800,3,1680,4.357827476038339
3934219,4,B002HEXVUI,"My g/f dragged me along to this, I had no intention to ever see it due to the trailer not taking my interest because to me it looked like to sort of movie that only die-hard animie fans could enjoy. However, my pre-thoughts where way off as we began watching this movie.

The film is set in the future where humans have apparently destroyed there own planet and are invading other planets now to mine for something or other. On this planet the tall blue people inhabit the land with the animals and a form of mother nature as there god. Along come the humans to invade and want to mine the planet and the blue guys home that is a gigantic tree is sitting on top of the biggest area of whatever metal it is they want to mine.

A marine is brought in under the guidance of a few scientists and they have the ability to transfer themselves from there own human body into a genetically engineered body of the tall blue guys so they can communicate. However negotiations haven't gone too good so the army invading just blow the crap out of everything while a small select group know the planet inhabitants are not hostile and should not be forcebly removed from there own homes just to please share holders.

A few reviewers raved on about it being a political plot of anti-Americanism from Hollyweed, but for god sakes guys, there is about 5 of you and 100's saying the movie is good, so stop over analising things and looking for deeper meanings and just sit back and enjoy a movie for once. You will be dead by the time you are middle aged and all alone if you wanna believe the world is just one big conspiracy theory after the next and we should all start wearing foil around our heads to stop the government controlling our thoughts.

The visual of this movie was awesome. It was like when Fantasia awed audiences back when it released by Disney, now this movie is showing what can be done with today's CGI and special effects, and I don't normally praise anything for visual effects, and do agree that CGI is used way too much these days, but this movie's was pretty breathtaking.

3934221,5,B002HEXVUI,"I went to see Avatar today with my 10 year old grandson, I am 65.  We both came out of the theater absolutely blown away.  I am not a big moviegoer, but was fascinated by what I had heard and seen about the movie before Avatar came out.  My grandson is a big Sci'Fi fan and had been bugging my daughter to let him go to see it.  She happily let Pop take him to the movies.  Neither of us was disappointed.  As far as I am concerned, this is GRAND Hollywood Spectacle in the best sense of the word.  The created world of Pandora is lush, beautiful, and dangerous.  I think the plot is very believable; sadly it is a very realistic critique of the worst parts of Western civilization.  The characters are well drawn although they could always be more developed.  While their is profanity, I didn't think it was overdone.  There was one sex scene, but it was so gently done that I did not find it objectionable to have a 10 year old boy next to me.  The creatures of Pandora are amazing and believable and the natives are graceful and sympathetic.  Some have criticized Avatar for having borrowed from other sources and for me that is what made it so great.  It stretched my horizons, while still giving me a known foundation from which to enjoy all the movie has to offer.  The only thing I want to do when I see it again is to see it in IMAX 3D.  10/10 in my book.",1262044800,6,1363,4.184615384615385
3934222,4,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron's Avatar.  What more is there?  This is a movie I've anticipated for years and the pay-off is a spectacle of mostly seamless special effects partnered with slam-bang action.  It is an entertaining film well-worth the price of admission and is one not to be missed this Holiday Season.

However, that being said...Avatar suffers from several flaws mainly concerning its plot and cheap dialogue fused with dues ex machina devices that come close to muddling down the feel of the entire film.  You can tell when actors don't improv because, I hate to say it, but Cameron's dialogue is not very believable, nor is it engaging in this film.  Veterans such as Sigourney Weaver (who ad-libbed the most famous line from Cameron's ALIENS) proves to be (for me) the most likable character in the entire film; Weaver's a veteran and she flows smoothly in her role.  In fact several performances in here are very good.  The rest of the supporting cast is also utilized effectively...That is until we get to our star, Sam Worthington (who earlier this year starred in the weak Terminator: Salvation).

I have to compare Worthington to Keenu Reeves in the Matrix movies just because this is another case where it seems the entire supporting cast has more talent and enthusiasm for the project than the lead-actor.  This guy just doesn't seem interested in the material at all!  He just gives the vibe that he's reading directly off a teleprompter whenever he speaks.  There was very little depth to this performance and never did I identify with the emotional responses conveyed by Worthington (even WITH CGI motion-capture fix-ups).

That brings me Worthington's character Jake Sully...I don't know whether it's Worthington or Cameron's script but I often found this character unbelievably bland.  He's obviously supposed to represent an ""everyman"" but even being wheelchair bound he failed to catch my interest as an individual.  Backstory is clich, as is most aspects of this character and he just felt like a tired retread of ""that dude who makes things happen.""  In fact I don't think this character had ANY flaws outside of being crippled; no emotional issues, obsessions, or anything that could complicate his character.  In short: He could probably try out for sainthood.

Not to worry, for our supporting characters manage to win my praise.  Stephen Lang (Gettysburg) is the particularly cold Colonel Miles Quaritch proving to be a very intimidating screen presence in his apathetic tone towards the violence surrounding him.  Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Grace Augustine just about steals away the entire movie with her limited screen time and throughout the film I was wishing the plot concentrated more on her.

Zoe Saldana through the magic of motion-capture and computer wizardry plays our female lead of Neytiri and I'll say this: she is far more engaging of a character than her male-lead.  She does suffer from some clichs as the Worthington character did, but this actress gave a lot of spunk to this gal that made it very easy to forgive her shortcomings in the script.

The rest of the Na'Vi...they're okay I guess; nothing really unique about any of them.  Chief, medicine woman, lead warrior...that's basically the only other characters there are because for a movie that tried to center on the Na'Vi we only really get to know is Neytiri.  The rest are basically  CGI rendered, moving backgrounds running around without any unique features (though, towards the end we get a 10 second look of the female chief of the coast dwelling Na'Vi who has a red triangle painted across her chest: in those seconds she already became more interesting than most of the other Na'Vi characters).

As for the visual look: it is fantastic, as you would expect from its budget, but that being said: like the plot it also has its fair share of flaws.

For the human compound and vehicles Cameron basically copies many designs previously employed in ALIENS, and as much as I loved that film's designs, I didn't want to see them being used again in this manner: it feels at times like Cameron was too lazy to come up with new designs so he spruced up his old ones and refurbished them.

The jungle obviously had the most work put into it.  There are beautiful shots of floating mountains (still bothers me that those are NEVER explained: I can only suspend disbelief for so long without so much as an illogical explanation).  Every creature, tree, and aspect of this screams of adventure...but some of the things just seem like Cameron wanted to blow his budget in as many ways as possible.  Everything is beautiful, but some of the things in this jungle make such little sense that I doubt they were created except as an excuse to fully utilize the budget.

Also, the Na'Vi are impressive visual achievements, but given the budget I am enormously disappointed by Cameron's lack of diversity with these characters.  Most of them look EXACTLY the same.  At one point we are show several of the tribes across the planet and all they have are different cultural garb...otherwise they are all exactly the same color, design, and look.  Was it too hard to change the skin tones between these regions?  This is the most expensive movie ever made and they aren't going to try and diversify at all?  It would have added a whole other degree of realism...maybe he could have done that instead of having lizard-insects that flew like little helicopters.

Wrapped in Cameron's veteran direction the film at least succeeds in being constantly thrilling to the eyes.

So I've mentioned art, direction, acting, characters...so there's only one thing left.

My biggest gripe about this film is the plot.  It is very generic as well as predictable.  Every character you meet in this film you essentially know the moment they speak what role they're going to play in the plot.  I'll list a few types here:

Movie's villain
Corporate official more concerned with profit than life
No nonsense doctor
Guy who begins hating lead than allies himself with him

You also can predict EVENTS far before they happen.  Most of the movie is self-spoiling, and not in the Greek tragedy foreshadowing type of way.

Hero starts out of place
Hero does what no one else could
Falls in love with other
Hero is accepted into group after short amount of time
Hero becomes the leader during this short time
Hero chooses to side with new group

The list goes on, but I think you get my drift.  As for the plot it's a generic ""outsider"" story with a few new twists, but overall it's the same story previously found in Lawrence of Arabia and The Last Samurai...if you mixed them with...Romance...Ugh, it just did not work in this film.  Every. Single. Bit. Of romantic dialogue fell flat in this piece, as well as having Cameron's most spontaneous sex scene since The Terminator in 1984 (convenient that the aliens here have the EXACT same ways of showing affection, and mating as modern USA citizens, is it not?).

As well-done as it is the film can't help but leave gaping plot holes every which way it goes while ramming obvious symbolism and messages down the audience's throat to the point that I wanted to write a letter to James Cameron saying ""I don't want to be lectured about environmental issues by someone who just spent over $300+ million on a bloody movie.""  Is he subtle about these messages?  Nope; not at all.  Unless you have NO knowledge of European/USA forces dislocating Native Americans or the Iraq War the symbolism you may find yourself sighing at the dialogue where they essentially lecture the audience about things any adult should be well-aware of.

I also don't like how human the Na'Vi were made out to be.  I  had a similar gripe with the very-human aspects of the Prawn in District 9, but at least in that film the aliens looked...well, alien.  Here we essentially have giant Native Americans, painted them blue, threw on tails, and tossed them out for a sci-fi reenactment of American history (but with a happy Hollywood ending).  This also means we get some horrendously clich dialogue modeled off what must have been Indians in 1960's Westerns; it just wasn't believable in the slightest.  Never ONCE did I believe the Na'Vi to be aliens or that culturally they were different from human tribes.

As a visual achievement the film is astounding, but I don't feel it's really left a lasting impression on me; it doesn't come close to topping the visuals of Pan's Labyrinth as the most visionary movie of the decade.  Avatar is a fun, engaging ride that leaves the viewer thoroughly entertained, but in the end isn't much more than a well-made blockbuster that doesn't transcend greatness as other films of the genre had.  Cameron just seemed at times that he did things not because the plot required it, but because he wanted to be praised as a ""visionary.""  I wish he had spent more time on his script than he had on the look of this film.

I was completely surprised that the entirety of the film was done in 3D and, at times, was a little uncomfortable but still totally engrossed in the storyline, the characters, and the world of Pandora.

3934224,5,B002HEXVUI,"Well this is my first review..just deal with it. :)

This movie WILL change your opinion on CGI. I'm not going to lie I'm kind of a skeptic when it comes to CGI, it's become something that's so easy to produce that directors are pumping out movies more then ever, and aren't taking enough time to make the quality of the animation convincing... (GI Joe for example).
  Well James Cameron certainly took his time, and it paid off. I have never experienced a visual spectacle like this. I was concerned with previous trailers the movie was going to be too colorful and not be convincing on screen and look even cartoon like, not at all. I was shocked at how wonderful the pigments were and how rich it appeared on screen. James Cameron's imagination in creating this beautiful planet; Pandora, I wanted to be there. It was magical almost, all the creatures and plants were so life-like, watching this movie in 3D made that even more real.

Several critics have given this movie an average rating. This is because they believe it had a weak story line and bad acting. I don't completely disagree but, the movie was not made to have the greatest story-line. I think the creativity takes over the story-line in this movie, and it is very believable.
  Basically it's about a young marine sent to understand the way the Na'vi live and survive. There had been a new technology created to give him the body of an avatar. He begins his mission in the hope to relocate these mysterious creatures, as they are sitting on a gold mind of protected rock that will sell for 20 Million a kilo. He learns the way and the Na'vi and falls in love, and becomes a warrior for them. He fights back the human race to defend his new home. (just slightly predictable)
  If you keep an open mind... over $300 Million went into the production and took James Cameron over 10 years to produce, let alone it took 30 hours to render a 30 second shot of CGI, you can't beat how ground breaking this movie was, even just for that fact!

I strongly recommend it, just to experience something truly different. It's exciting, there were parts that make you want to cry and even make your hair stand up straight. The tension of the war between the humans and the Na'vi makes you really connect to the characters. You can feel the emotional struggle on screen and can really sympathize, if a movie can stir your emotions it's worked. 5 stars!",1262044800,2,2404,4.52073732718894

3934226,5,B002HEXVUI,"Like most reviewers I was blown away by this movie. You truly get lost in this world and come to believe it's REAL.

James Cameron captured every tiny minute detail bringing the forest, the animals, and the natives to life. But what was most astounding was how these digital charters seemed to be possessed by the soles of the actors.
If you saw ""Beowulf"" then you know how motion capture doesn't capture everything. The charters in that movie looked somewhat like the actors, but they were lifeless, like hollow puppets.
In ""Avatar"" the digital charters have depth, they really come to life, so much so you forget that they're computer generated.

Sure the story is something that has been told before. Even I wished (after picking up my jaw from the floor) that certain charters motivations had been more clearly defined, but what people forget is that this story still has relevance. It's happening in the South American rain forest even as I type this. But the movies majesty makes up for what its lacking in story.

It's ironic that a Eco-minded Mother Earth type story is presented so amazingly by a artificial, technologically advanced medium. The 3D imagery is constant and unobtrusive. He used it to enhance the story rather then be the focus. I had only one slight moment of dizziness at the beginning, but I think that was the intended reaction since the main charter was weightless and floating at the time..:) I just wish he had been able to use the full scope of the IMAX screen, but then it wouldn't be shown in regular theaters.

If your still on the fence about this film...don't hesitate to see it, and if you have the extra money, make sure you see it in IMAX 3D so you can really appreciate it.",1262044800,3,1714,4.628289473684211
3934227,5,B002HEXVUI,"So where do you start, reviewing Avatar?
Unless you've been living in a cave, you'll have heard it's an extravaganza of amazing special effects that cost $300 million. You've probably heard that ""professional"" reviewers have called the storyline weak, and the acting sub par.
I saw it last night in 3D, which I imagine is how James Cameron envisaged having it watched. After the customary 10 minute eye adjustment the effect was incredible.
I understand that over 2500 individual special effects were used, along with the most sophisticated computer aided graphics and even newly invented hardware (for example a camera where Cameron could see the actors fully rendered through the lens while filming) to give a ""real"" feel.
And ""real"" it is, you come out of this movie thinking Pandora is a real place! And by the representation on screen Cameron has been there!
This isn't Mos Eisley circa 1977, every creature here looks like it belongs on this planet (itself an eye popping vision) The Na'vi don't look plastic (like they appeared in early trailers) they look, move and act real before your eyes, it sounds corny, but you feel swept away into this new World, almost like it was a real planet discovered.

The story was solid, I didn't find it weak, although to some it may appear simple, if I had to make a negative comment, it is predictable.
Paraplegic Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) gets a chance to fill his recently deceased twin brothers shoes and ""pilot"" an Avatar (DNA home grown Na'vi human controlled) under the guidance of Scientist Sigourney Weaver and crew. Being a marine, he's also under the scrutiny (and allegiance) of Gung Ho Col. Quaritch (excellently played by Stephen Lang). A basic synopsis would be, Weaver wants to save the Na'vi and Pandora, Lang wants to help Selfridge and Co. (Giovanni Ribisi slimy as ever)  ""kill em all"" and mine the ore under their sacred land, Worthington soon realizes he's playing for the wrong team, like I said it's a simple plot.
That doesn't however make it weak.
People are going to talk about this movie for a long time, from the sky high production costs, to the box office records it's sure to smash.
People are also talking about the movies subtext, message, morality. Is it an allegory for invading foreign lands? Afghanistan? Iraq? Personally I doubt it, this movie has been mulling around in James Cameron's head since he saw George Lucas make Star Wars in the 70's, and has been itself over 10 years in production. The end result, a detailed, meticulous and believable Sci Fi like nothing you have seen before.
At 162 mins, it's not short, but the movie is paced very well and feels the right length.

The bottom line for me was an excellent, unusual and thought provoking epic that will stand up for many many years. If you can see it in 3D try to, or even IMAX 3D. If not just see it, but make sure you do, you won't forget it quickly. 5 stars.",1262044800,6,2912,4.694716242661448

3934230,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar was a wonderful...exciting.....beautifully made, well acted movie with tons of color, fight scenes and lots of movie magic. The plot was good, although  not terribly original. The humans want something, in this case a mineral worth millions for just an ounce, from the natives (8 foot blue people known as Avatars).  The Avatars want to maintain their culture/traditions, beliefs (trees containing the souls of those that have departed) while they keep their land (Pandora) as it is (unsoiled and untouched). The humans don't want to take ""no"" for an answer and create a time table for the Avatar to relent or be destroyed. Will Colonel Quariteh and his mighty military dominate? Meanwhile, Dr./Anthropologist Grace Augustine (Weaver) wants to study the Avatar culture and will stop at nothing to protect their interests. She is part of the team that created the technology that allows her to inhabit the body of a genetically grown Avatar while her human form remains safely asleep in a chamber.  Enters the main character played by Sam Worthington (Jake Sully), who was the identical twin brother of a Doctor who was very involved with the project. Sully soon finds himself in quite the dilemma. If he helps the organization find the weakness of the Avatar, they have promised to get his legs back (apparently an expensive surgery that he could not afford if he doesn't do what they want), but this would mean betraying those that he has come to love (Neytiri played by Zoe Saldana).  Jake soon finds that mingling with the Avatar (even if it is for only 3 months during which time he is to betray them) is going to be more complicated than he thought.

There  were several things to love about this movie.  Besides the wonderful acting (Weaver is always great in Sci-Fi movies, and all other characters were equally believable.), the technology used was simply breathtaking. The colors and wonderfully vivid world of Pandora came to life on the 3D/Imax screen.  And while I was expecting a lot, with all the hype and advertising that accompanied this movie, this was one of those rare occasions that I was not disappointed. Whatever you do, take some time out of your life and see Avatar and you will not regret it. And while I know that seeing this on a regular television will not be the same or do this epic drama justice, I will still await the release on DVD.  It will be a wonderful addition to my DVD collection.",1261958400,4,2429,4.778042959427208

3934232,3,B002HEXVUI,"I am one of the few people that did not enjoy Avatar but admired the imagination and artistry to create the fauna and flora of the movie's planet, Pandora.  I am also one of the few people who got violenty ill watching it in Imax 3D (headache and nausea).  I found the live action 3D rather flat comared to the CGI 3D.  The sound design is also great, especially with Imax speakers.  James Horner's score is serviceable but derivative of his other scores, especially his signature four-note danger motif.  The movie is also very long and nearly three hours.

Without the visuals, I don't think the movie would have been successful.  It's Dances With Wolves-like plot is one dimensional and left me cold and detached.  I will add that those sitting behind me and pockets of others in the audience cheered the end confrontation and applauded at the end.  I did not feel that way.

Except for the headache, nausea and jumpy legs, I don't regret seeing this movie.  But I could also have lived without seeing it and I will probably never watch it again.  There just weren't those movie ""moments"" or bond with the characters that would make me want to return.

I do have a suggestion when watching this movie.  If watching it in an Imax theater, sit at least halfway up the rows.  There is a lot of camera movement in the movie and Imax 3D has a way of making a huge screen look like you're sitting six feet from a large projection television (I discovered that watching Avatar and an underwater documentary years back in Imax 3D).  Judging from the Alice in Wonderland trailer (which I saw in Real 3D and in Imax 3D), the 3D effect is a bit more pronounced.  However, in the live action footage that incorporated CGI effects (monitor readouts, holographic maps, headscans, etc.), it seems to strain the eyes a bit.

In closing, I don't want to disencourage anyone from seeing this film.  The effects are not revolutionary but they are very refined and highly imaginative.  But I do disagree with the glowing 5 star reviews even though I experienced audience members who would no doubt have given this movie a top rating.",1261958400,4,2116,4.606951871657754
3934233,4,B002HEXVUI,"I have waited for this moment for months. Now, it is an anti-climax of sorts.
Avatar is what I had expected and is also a disappointment. There is absolutely nothing original here. Anyone who has read a few sci-fi novels (you don't have to be a fanatic like I am) that are examples of the main genres will find bits of influences (and downright plagiarising) everywhere.
There is ""Winds of Altair"" (where there is a six-legged panther which is remotely controlled by a human), there is ""The End of Winter""(where there is entwining of tails)... I could not come up with all the references, I must confess. I hope due tribute is given to the original owners of the ideas somewhere...
The movie is striking visually. As expected.
The world of Pandora is well-built. Obviously a lot of thought wnet into designing the flora and the fauna. And it shows. Whether plagiarised or not, it is an incredible effort to be applauded.
However, there the originality ends. The subject matter is very very very familiar.
It is, in brief, ""Pocahontas"" meets ""Aliens"" (with a lot of ""Dances with Wolves"" in between). The references to the Native Americans is so strong, you can't help feel Jim Cameron is trying to apologize for what the white people did.
Don't get me wrong. You enjoy every second of the movie. You don't even feel the 3 hours pass by. But this movie won't age well. Repeat viewing will not be so much fun without the 3D (meaning at home). And when you remove the visual splendor, the remainder is not that strong. There are better movies that tell the same story.
Still it is a must see and will certainly be a cornerstone in movie-making because of its technology. Just don't expect anything more...",1261958400,,1701,4.6544850498338874
3934234,5,B002HEXVUI,"It is true that any negative reviews you read about James Cameron's AVATAR is completly FALSE.

People who hated AVATAR somehow got their political buttons pushed the wrong way; they took offense prematurely when they should have lightened up and enjoyed a historical masterpiece.

I hear people complain that AVATAR is a remake of ""Dances With Wolves"" + ""Pocahontas"".
Okay, so what's wrong with that? Those are 2 great stories. But neither one of those great stories have the presentation that AVATAR is able to deliver.

Okay, so we got the politics and classic story out of the way.
Pretty much every movie these days is based on some other story and politic. That's nothing new.

Now let's talk about what makes this story unique and one of a kind -- the cinematography and CGI special visual effects.

When CGI characters look exactly like real people and living things in every way, that is truly special.

When CGI characters can make you feel ""connected"" to them as if you feel connected to real live people, that is truly special.

The acting is absolutely fantastic. Heck, even the CGI characters did an amazing acting job. :)

Can we please give Best Actor to Jake Sully (the blue Na'vi) and Neytiri (the Na'vi princess)?

3934235,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is a very entertaining movie with great eye candy. It's basically everything I hoped for from Star Wars Episode 1. The plot isn't as original as James Cameron thinks though. The plot is basically a combination of Ferngully: The Last Rain Forrest and Dances with Wolves. But CGI wise and excitement wise the movie was well worth the expense.
  Also, Avatar is less for females than Titanic, it's more for the Cameron fans that loved films like Aliens and Terminator 2. Which to me is a very good thing since I'm a guy and since I only watched Titanic once lol.",1261958400,,566,4.53921568627451
3934236,4,B002HEXVUI,"During the Titanic roll-out, Director Cameron observed that his highest purpose as a filmmaker was to take his audiences to places they otherwise could not travel. If you look back over his accomplishments, he's at least consistent, and more consistently than any other director, even Spielberg, James Cameron has delivered on that promise. (I would also argue, in another place, that Mel Gibson is 3 for 3 on that same, albeit implicit, challenge.)

Avatar is, as the reviewers have extolled, ""immersive,"" particularly in 3D and Dolby 5.1 (although I'd also argue that, even without 3D the viewer would literally be pulled into the frame - think the two great long scenes in ""Children of Men"" for immersive cinema). Cameron has created a compelling, believable society and culture for the Na'vi, pretty obviously based on northeastern American woodland Indian culture, and a strange world, of strangely beautiful  flora and fauna, for the Na'vi to inhabit (although like the worlds of Star Trek, this is, with a few interesting exceptions, a largely bipedal and quadrapedal world). And Cameron, through standard story devices, wins our total sympathy to his uplifting vision. With different scenarios and visual pieces, he's done this before (and so, of course, have scores of filmmakers, over and over): ""narrative tension 101,"" with a good guy and a bad guy in a very asymmetric duel (Billy Zane, Paul Reiser, Michael Biehn in The Abyss), a monstrous, prehensile capitalist, HUGE technologies, HUGE vistas, very simple, very emotional thematics - Cameron knows, intuitively, that stories can be fanciful and and even unbelievable, but the emotional kicker is real, does indeed course through our nervous systems in ways that we've all felt and understood before, like ""puppy love,"" so real to a 14-year-old but absurd to grandpa, who's been there before...but forgets how real, how true the FEELING of the thing is.

So hats off to Mr. Cameron and his crew for the Na'vi and all the glorious effects he's surrounded them with. I've docked him a star simply because he's repeated so many familiar elements of earlier pictures and now showing us anything new in the story department...but I'm already reconsidering that, because, as a cinematic experience - which is of course how we approach this work of art - this movie is thrilling and, yes, takes me to a place I could never have got to without having been led by Mr. Cameron's sure hand.

If you think that's a sappy assessment, you have missed the entire point of the movie.

3934240,2,B002HEXVUI,"Warning: This review may contain spoilers-- Classifying 'Avatar' as science fiction is a misnomer. If you take away the whole idea of the Avatar technology, you end up with a standard Hollywood action movie. And the technology is truly dispensable. For the year 2154, I'd rather have a genetically modified humanoid standing on his own two feet rather than an 'avatar'. Both ideas are far-fetched, but the idea of an avatar who is controlled through some kind of vague telepathic commands emanating from a human being deep asleep while in a coma seems much more the stuff of comic books than semi-plausible science fiction.

  Without the Avatar 'gimmick', Cameron's story is nothing more than an allegory of the mistreatment of Native Americans by the 'white man'. Cameron harks back to the 17th century where the idea of the 'noble savage' was in vogue. So-called 'primitive' people were held up as 'natural' and 'spiritual', untarnished by the corrupting effects of western civilization. Also at play were deep-seated guilt feelings over the perceived deleterious effects of European colonialism.

  In Cameron's tale, the 'colonialists' have been updated to military contractors who have somehow bought the 'heart and soul' of the American military itself (we're told that the adventurers on 'Pandora' are ex-Marines, all there for the money). The contractors are headed by two stock villains: Parker Selfridge (the civilian corporate chief) and Colonel Quaritch (an amalgam of the worst right-wing military types you could ever think of). Cameron makes no effort in humanizing his two antagonists. On the other hand, the indigenous people, the 'Na'vi' can do no wrong. Not only have they mastered their skills in surviving in the wild but have tapped into the mystical forces of the forest which put our own holistic healers to shame.

  While the Na'vi are certainly stand-in's for Native Americans, they are not Native Americans of the American West in the 19th century but rather more akin to earlier forest dwelling Indians as depicted in James Fenimore Cooper's ""Last of the Mochicans"" (is it a coincidence that one of the stars of the early 90s film version of that book is Wes Studi who plays 'Eytukan' here?) Cameron must bring in other cinematic influences to make sure that this is not simply a rehash of an early 18th century romantic novel. In the beginning, with images of space travelers coming out of suspended animation inside a spaceship, one is reminded of such iconic films as '2001: A Space Odyssey' and the sci-fi horror tale, 'Alien'. And what about all those futuristic helicopters that are constantly firing missiles at the hapless natives? I can only think of mediocre Vietnam-era war movies such as 'The Green Berets' starring John Wayne. Avatar is also derivative of Spielberg films such as ""Jurassic Park"" with its emphasis on prehistoric creatures who seem to have a continuous anger management problem.

  As for Avatar's plot, it's all rather predictable stuff. The enlightened 'scientists' are pitted against the hard-boiled military, none of whom seem to have a conscience. The film's hero, Jake Sully, already is told that the bad guys are planning to wipe the Na'vi out but it takes him three months to warm up to them. I had a hard time believing that Sully would side so easily with the evil Colonel from the beginning--yes he was offered the 'carrot' of getting his legs back but as a paraplegic wouldn't that have made him wary of the Colonel's unrelenting disdain for the underdog? In other words, wasn't it obvious that the Colonel was a real bad guy from the very beginning? What's more, wouldn't Sully have tried to warn the Na'vi earlier instead of waiting to the last hour? He could have perhaps persuaded one or two Na'vi to form a reconnaissance team and to check out the base in order to convince them that the enemy had the capability to wipe them out. Also, at the end, why did the Na'vi let the defeated enemy leave the planet? Wouldn't they have slaughtered all of them? (Oh I forgot--they're Noble Savages!).

  Despite the derivative and mediocre story, Avatar keeps your interest due to its excellent special effects. Cameron is a master at computer animation and keeps you riveted on all the action despite insulting your intellect. Avatar is a sensory delight but seeing it more than once is not recommended.",1261872000,4,4370,4.9753086419753085

3934242,1,B002HEXVUI,"Mozart was a very gifted twelve-year old, cranking out all manner of compositions seemingly beyond his tender years.  The sad news is that the works he created as a mature composer seem hardly any more sophisticated, to still echo with the jolly emptiness of childhood, a distinct lack of a fully formed, tragic worldview.  Watching James Cameron's Avatar, I kept having to fight off the sensation that, for all its marvelous technical achievements, I was watching the work of a gifted, precocious twelve-year old.  But one that had fully absorbed a lifetime's worth of meticulously correct environmental claptrap.  Al Gore's enlightened fingerprints are all over this movie.  The ease and utter lack of moral complexity that accompanied the main character's betrayal, not just of his comrades but of his whole planet, was breathtaking.  Given Cameron's gift for finding the noble and the romantic in tales of treachery and betrayal, perhaps his next project should be a sympathetic telling of the Major Nidal Hasan story.

While I was initially puzzled by the uniformly rapturous reviews accorded Avatar (especially when compared to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/District-9-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B002SJIO4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">District 9 (Single-Disc Edition)</a>, a vastly more original movie) I could only conclude that it's Avatar's syrupy post-Christian, post-American values that so enthralled the critics.  Surely its bland stew of recycled pantheist/ nature worship clichs appealed to the sophisticates for whom the faith of most Americans is to be ridiculed.  And surely no movie has so passionately depicted Americans, in their role as earthly imperialists, and the US Marines in particular, as the spearpoint of that conquering role, with such visceral contempt.  Perhaps it's because no organization clings more tenaciously to the values and traditions that once defined this country that the U.S. Marines tend to be singled out for contempt and loathing by the likes of James Cameron.  While Sam Worthington's ""warrior, jarhead tribe"" character was mostly squared away in his appearance, watching Stephen Lang's rah-rah speech to his ragtag troops before the big climactic battle I was reminded of nothing so much as the ""gutter trash"" bounty hunters with which Robert Ryan had to pursue William Holden and the other members of The Wild Bunch.  Who wouldn't root for their defeat?  This was plainly Dances With Wolves with bigger arrows and more impressive face paint.

And I suppose the timing for Cameron's movie was just right.  The sight of the World Trade Center towers vanishing in a whirlwind of pulverized concrete and human remains is a rapidly fading memory, one which our education establishment works tirelessly to erase all together.  So I suppose it was high time for a movie where people can once again cheer as the American fighting man is impaled with the arrows of noble, environmentally correct aborigines, where earth in general, and America in particular, can finally be subjected to a humiliating trail of tears as we're driven from the Eden-like Pandora and forced to retreat to the planet which we (of course!) ruined.

So I confess to being chagrined and puzzled that at movie's end, a substantial part of the audience applauded.  It's as if people were to applaud after having been urinated on for 2 and a half hours.  But I suppose if the urine is raining down in spectacular 3-D, well you just have to clap.",1261872000,19,3501,5.36745886654479
3934243,5,B002HEXVUI,"I saw Avatar in 3D Presentation and I think it is the new step in creating the marvels of entertainment and pure spectacles. It is worth every dollar that has been spent on its amazing effects and visuals. It is a very good action/adventure/sci-fi/thriller anti-war futuristic movie but watching it in 3D is something I will never forget. James Cameron IS the King of the World, the world of great cinema that is. What imagination he's got and the possibility to bring the images born by his vision to big screen in the incredible artistic manner. 12 years in makings, 300 or 400 millions spent, perhaps thousands of the first class specialists in their fields creating the breathtaking world of the planet Pandora and her inhabitants, her flora and fauna.  163 minutes long, AVATAR is an event in moviemaking. It's got many important messages, too, regarding the wars, nature and connection of all living creatures, but first of all it is breakthrough in creating visuals in the modern film.  I think many people all over the world will accept and admire it. Even if they won't love the story which is anything but new and relies heavily on the ideas that have been presented before in the films like Matrix, New World, Dances with the Wolves, Last Samurai, Star Wars, and many more and they find the characters not very deep and their dialogs often clichd, there is still a lot to admire in the new film by James Cameron, the visionary who has given us Aliens, Terminator and T2, True Lies, and yes, Titanic.

It is about love in the face of heroic difficulties, but its the connection between the two main characters which lifts the movie above the level of all the other great action / scifi movies we've seen.

For those of you who are reading this under the DVD release in November, 2010, I suggest that this release does have much to offer over the theatrical release, especially if you get it in Blu-Ray. The 18 extra minutes add a lot of balance to the story of the conflict between the humans and the Na'vi, before the attack on home tree. It also adds a lot of depth to Jake Sully's motivations to take the side of the Na'vi against Col. Quaritch and Co. To the theologically inclined, there is even some good material in the incomplete scenes, which did not even get into the extended versions. Some of the material on the second and third disks is a bit silly, but we've come to expect some chaff on these sets.

For those of you who are reading this under the DVD release of 22 April, I agree with others who are critical of this 'bare bones' release, not in 3-D and with none of the extras we may have been lead to expect. The only extras are alternate sound tracks in Spanish and French, plus Subtitles for the hearing impaired. For a minimal release, I would give the DVD package 3 stars. The only other advantage is that by NOT being in 3-D, certain lighting aspects are better than 3-D in the theatre.

Another, somewhat subliminal view of the movie is that it represents all the major stages of life, especially the rebirth of baptism, growth into belonging in the community, marital union, and death. Ultimately, it gives one the sense of a sinner's return to a state of grace in the garden.

In order to answer some critics, I am certain, as Cameron says himself, that the story is a gemish of every SciFi novel and film he has read or seen. There is even a hint of 'Return of the Jedi' in that both Pandora and Endor are habitable moons of gas giant planets, similar to the moons of Jupiter. This is not a bad thing. People have been retelling the same story over and over for centuries. The post-Biblical story of Simon Magus was resurrected and retold as the Faust story ever since the fourteenth century. The question is, does Cameron tell it better? I suspect he comes out in the lead by a nose

The skeleton of the story is similar to 'white man scouts indians, white man goes over to Indians, white man helps Indians fight cavalry, Indians win'. My dim memory of 'Little Big Man', with Dustin Hoffman, suggests this was the best exemplar of this skeleton. The big advance over that skeleton is based on the Avatar process, and on the one hand, the advantages it gives to Jake Scully to make contact, and on the other hand, the disadvantages, when the colonel back at home base can cut him off from his Avatar body in the blink of an eye.

The second leg of this movie is the absolutely perfect technical realization of Pandora and its inhabitants. I don't think that even the floating mountains are original (I have a suspicion these showed up in a Larry Niven story) I am certain the huge trees and the sentient connections between the flora and fauna are not original. But the details of how all these were realized is impecable. I am not well versed in movie technology, but I have seen very good movies, such as Ridley Scott's Gladiator, where the editing, especially in heavy action scenes, is very, very choppy. But Russell Crowe keeps your attention, so you don't care. A slip in filming or editing in 'Avatar' would have been disastrous. But there are no slips. Not one. Cameron and Co get all the little stuff exactly right, even so far as to invent the Na'vi language which sounds both familiar and foreign at the same time. The only 'background' aspect of the film which doesn't POP is James Horner's score. It is 'good enough', but not so good I will run out and buy a CD.

The third leg of this movie is the aura of spirituality evoked by the unique combination of story, backstory, and effectiveness of the actors portraying the Na'vi to show how they feel. As Sigourny Weaver said recently, Cameron was able to develop at least three very good female characters in this movie. Zoe Saldana was especially effective in being alternately tough and vulnerable behind her Na'vi persona.  We are used to this by now, ever since Gollum turned out to be the most interesting character in 'Lord of the Rings'. As heroic and inspiring as LOTR was, Avatar is even better, and it knows when to stop. I literally cried through the second half of the film, so taken was I by the evocative spirit of the Na'vi and their environment. This is tree-hugging writ large, very large. I was taken aback when I ran into a passage in 1 Timothy 4:2-4 which warned against itching ears, and wandering away to myths. I can wish that the level of spiritual octane in our religious services and teachings could come close to the artistry being applied here to 'mere myths'.

A week after writing this review, it occurred to me that there are mythic undercurrents to this movie, especially in the realization of the Na'vi which dig deep into some of our most basic notions of the divine. In some early Jewish writings, Adam and Eve are described as being clothed in effervescent light (just like the Na'vi) and who must be clothed with artificial clothes when they fall from grace. The Na'vi are still connected to their God, and fight to preserve that connection.

The links to classic spirituality and folklore just keep coming. I just discovered, in the title to Howard Schwartz' book 'The Tree of Souls' that this tree was, in Jewish folklore, the heavenly analogue to the Tree of Life in the garden of Eden. The author, Schwartz told me he has no idea if Cameron got the idea from Schwartz' book, published in 2004.

As an aside, I have to add that allowing for the layers of special effects, Zoe Saldana is simply outstanding in this flick. Give us more!

LOTR surprised me, because I thought it couldn't be done, but it was. Avatar did not surprise me, but that doesn't mean it failed, because it simply lived up to expectations, as the expectations were very, very high.",1261872000,18,6312,4.5078671328671325
3934245,4,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is the fastest three hours I have ever spent in a theater. That's the strongest testimony I have to offer that it is, if nothing else, a well assembled, captivating entertainment. This is all I expected of the film, and it did deliver. I have no major complaints. (Yes, it does take elements and concepts other Sci-Fi writers introduced, but it whips basic ingredients provided by Clifford Simak, Ben Bova, Robert Heinlein and probably others into something enough unlike the originals to serve a popular film. Cameron never claimed to be a major Sci-Fi writer, at least the last that I heard.)

Those looking clear around the story, the characters, the neat SFX solely to the so-called message  -- as virtually no one else but the Right fringe of the audience is -- are the ones making a problem for the film. You can view Avatar as a Sci-Fi action/adventure with a social message, but make no mistake: It is first and foremost a Sci-Fi action/adventure film. It is obvious that the film's huge audience is eating it up in spite of, not because of any interpretable message.

In political terms -- let's be totally real here -- there is nothing to argue with in the gospel according to Avatar. The position is as simple as the tale being told: Good things should happen to nice people; mean people suck; if you are good to your land and planet, it will be good to you in return; when your only tool is a hammer, every problem begins to look like a nail. That all this sounds like a bumperstickerization of a complex topic may be the clearest indicator the nitpickers and would-be polemicists have that their decision to argue with this film was misguided at it's inception.

Ultimately, Avatar succeeds or fails, not as a political statement, but as an action/adventure film, and very adroit thrill ride. It's this aspect of the film that will draw millions and perhaps ultimately billions to see the film. As a thrill ride, it cannot be denied that Avatar is well put together, cracklingly paced, full of dazzling set pieces that out-Spielberg Spielberg and out-Lucas Lucas. If you're a fan of action/adventure movies, that's a good thing.

It may gall those who have picked this film as a culture war battleground that more people wish to be amused in these troubled times -- and identify emotionally and personally with the down-trodden and victimized -- than will ever be evangelized to their political doctrine. But how, exactly, is that supposed to be Avatar's, Cameron's or the audience's problem?",1261872000,8,2512,4.778801843317972

To clarify that statement and avoid being flamed by someone who did not enjoy it as much as me, I offer this statement. When I say 'best', I mean more that it could be my personal favorite, not necessarily 'best' in a quantifiable and measurable manner. Anyways, I will surely be buying this movie on blu-ray when it releases. And I almost never buy movies, so that's saying something.",1261872000,2,606,4.188034188034188
3934247,2,B002HEXVUI,"Never has so much money been spent on a such a small idea.

Avatar is a dumb, ham-handed movie relying on stereotypes, oversimplifications, bad dialogue, silly moralizing, and very little originality.  Almost nothing about the film is creative.  Even the plants and creatures inhabiting the far away planet of Pandora are only marginally removed from Earth's menagerie, and, at night, Pandora's forests are cast in a luminosity that seems straight out of one of those dreadful ""paintings of light"" by Thomas Kinkead.  For $500 million, you think you'd get more.  Apparently, not in Hollywood.

And, I've just described the good parts of Avatar.  Enjoy the candy visuals, because there really is almost nothing else.  Don't expect the slightest bit of subtlety.  We know by now that Cameron isn't capable of it.  As a bonus, there are no real characters to hold your interest, only cookie cutter stereotypes -- like the paper-thin ""macho Latina marine"" that Cameron now has down fairly pat.  In short, it's highly derivative, lowest-common-denominator escapism which, I suppose, would be fine, except that it also happens to be hugely preachy at the same time.

Watch it for the spectacle, but don't think you're going to care a bit about anyone in it, see a single thing that isn't telegraphed with the subtlety of a moose in the underbrush, or learn a single insight about the nature of good and evil and why human being sometimes do terrible things.

As I watched this vastly expensive and infinitely thin movie, my mind kept going back to District 9 -- a film that touched on the very same themes, but with artistry and vision.  If only someone had said ""no"" to Cameron and divvied this money up among more worthy filmmakers.  That, however, is the craziest fantasy of all.",1261872000,10,1776,4.892976588628763

Directed by James Cameron
(2009)
----------------------------------------
I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and was very glad that I got to see it in the theater, rather than on DVD.  That's part of what's great about this movie, that it so powerfully and so clearly makes the case for film as a medium which, at its best, HAS TO be seen on the big screen.  I am not a huge fan of James Cameron's work (""Aliens"" was fun; I loathed ""Titanic"") but I was really wowed by this one.  It's a true spectacle and, in its finest moments, will have you on the edge of your seat, rivited by what you see onscreen.

Sure, as has been pointed out by many reviewers, the film is largely a pastiche of other films and themes -- ""Pocohontas,"" ""Eragon,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Dances With Wolves..."" (even a bit of Disney's Pixie Hollow/Tinkerbell franchise...)  But it is brought together in supreme popcorn munching fashion -- this is a great Hollywood film with a powerful visual sense that is truly breathtaking. The political messages -- a critique of corporate greed, imperialism and ecological despoilation -- is admittedly simplistic, but frankly a breath of fresh air in a time when the post-9/11 patriotism is giving way to a confused disorientation and loss of direction for America.  In the packed theater I attended, some of it seemed to fall -- not on deaf ears, exactly -- but to a muted response, as if modern viewers have been given so few points of reference for this sort of eco-friendly messaging that they weren't quite sure how to respond.  But there was no way they could misinterpret it: Cameron clubs viewers over the head with the bluntest possible script, but we are so busy being overwhelmed by the sumptuous special effects and vibrant color palette that no one really minds.  Character development may suffer as a result, but the film as a whole is nothing short of dazzling.  I could have done with a little less of the shoot-em-up action at the end, but I was rooting for the good guys and moved by their victory. Who could ask for more?  I think I'm gonna go see it again.

3934250,4,B002HEXVUI,"If you have read the MPAA PG-13 rating for ""intense epic battle sequences and warfare, sensuality, language and some smoking"" and you are still asking ""should I take my younger child to go see this movie,"" this review is for you.

On Christmas Eve, my husband and I took all five (ages 8, 7, 6, 4, 3) of our children with us to see Avatar. We live in Japan, and the dialogue was in English with Japanese subtitles.

True to the rating, there were a few fecal matter related swearing instances, nudish blue humanoid Na'vi decked in strategically placed beads and loin-cloth size clothes, kissing and implied sex. The fibril linking between the Na'vi and the beings in their world was brilliant but erotic. The kids didn't notice.

Children younger than 13, especially those who are acquainted with video games and sci-fi, should be fine with parental supervision.

All of my children enjoyed the movie. My six year old, who has a tough exterior, a tender heart, and kicks butt on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halo-3-ODST/dp/B001HWB68K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halo 3: ODST</a>, held my hand during one of the battle scenes. He did not cover his eyes, he just wanted to know that I was nearby. He will kill me someday for sharing this with my readers.

While the MPAA was fretting over cigarette smoking, the strong focus on pantheism was the most malignant aspect of the movie. Today (Christmas morning here) I intend to talk with my children about praying to the spirit of the earth versus praying to the Almighty God. We have had a similar conversation over G-Rated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lion-King-Disney-Special-Platinum-Edition/dp/B00003CXB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lion King (Disney Special Platinum Edition)</a>. Keep in mind, in a country where less than 1% of the population are Christian, my children are exposed to the worship of false gods from the moment we step outdoors. We are sensitive to this, as we should be.

The movie is gorgeous. I have never seen such CG. The creatures, plant life... the whole world of Pandora... was amazing. I am in awe of James Cameron's ability to capture a glimpse of his genius and share with us creative plebeians. The bioluminescenct plants in the forest were so other-world beautiful, I wanted to touch them.

I cannot wait to see the pictures my children will draw for the refrigerator gallery after seeing Avatar.

While I did not experience Avatar in I-MAX with 3D glasses, I have a feeling it would have been fun. Without these enhancements, I imagine my viewing experience would compare to walking through an iridescent-on-black-velvet Ocean City, NJ, boardwalk poster shop without the UV lights.

Jake Sully, the film's hero, is a paraplegic There's-No-Such-Thing-As-an-Ex-Marine. His twin brother was a doctor set to work on planet Pandora as a driver for a DNA-personalized avatar. Through mind control, drivers are able to safely operate their avatars from a distant base while they interact with the Na'vi aliens in the forest. Shortly before the mission begins, Jake's brother dies. Jake's biochemistry was a match and, despite lack of scientific training, he is offered his brother's job.

When Jake's mind was reborn into his perfect new avatar body, he couldn't contain his overwhelming joy at being able to walk again. It was very moving.(There is one other moment that grabbed me by the heart. I won't spoil the moment, but when you hear the line, ""My Jake,"" remember this review!) I loved the character's determination despite his bum legs. He kept up and never made excuses or complained. He did not allow others to treat him delicately.

I am looking forward to revisiting a dialog on with my children on disabilities, and asking them what they would do if their legs stopped working.

Cameron captured the details of the world and the characters very well. He underscored the clashes that occur between corporate interests, a private military company, and scientists on the ground who are all working on the same project for different reasons, and how each group interacts with each other and with indigenous inhabitants.

The storyline, albeit entertaining, was a recycled one. While I was distracted by the gorgeousness of the animation and the how-did-he-think-of-that creature concepts, deep down I felt like watching a sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FernGully-The-Last-Rainforest-Family-Fun-Edition/dp/B000A9QK78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FernGully: The Last Rainforest (Family Fun Edition)</a>.

FernGully is a magical rain forest inhabited by fairies. A logging company harvests trees from the forest and threatens to destroy the forest environment and the fairies' world in the process.

One of the loggers, pure-hearted Zak, gets lost in the forest and is accidentally shrunk by one of the FernGully fairies. Fairy-sized, he can view the world from their perspective. Like Jake, Zak comes to understand the symbiotic relationship between the forest's inhabitants and the beautiful environment around them. Things are going well between Zak and the fairies until the logging crew knocks down a huge, spiraling tree, nearly identical in appearance to a large tree at the heart of the forest in Pandora that is also destroyed. When the tree is destroyed, an ancient evil is unleashed and the fairies realize that, although Zak looks like one of them, he is still a logger. Zak must chose between his job in the human realm and helping the forest fairies he loves. Can you guess what he does?

Avatar was a movie that went well with popcorn. We enjoyed seeing it as a family, but we also enjoy the discussions that come from watching a stories unfold. Sexuality, violence, stewardship and praying to false gods are things we have talked about before, and I felt comfortable allowing my children to view instances to the degree portrayed in this film while sitting next to me.

Do I think that children should be exposed to worldviews other than their own? With supervision, absolutely. When children are young, this might mean parents sitting right next to them. As children get older, supervision could manifest itself in asking questions to keep young adults mentally engaged with the world around them.

As an adult, how do you watch movies?

I leave you with a quote from one of my favorite books on Christians and entertainment:

  Two of the most frustrating replies to hear when asking people what they thought of a move are ""I liked it"" or ""I didn't like it,"" accompanied by an inability to explain why. With an elementary understanding of the structure of storytelling, an informed moviegoer can watch a film and enjoy the story while also engaging his or her critical faculties to understand what the movie is trying to say about the way in which we ought or ought not to live. Stories do not exist in a vacuum of meaninglessness. Movies communicate prevailing myths and cultural values. And this cultural effect is far deeper than the excesses of sex and violence. It extends to the philosophy behind the film. The way we view the world and things like right and wrong are embodied in the redemptive structure of storytelling itself. -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-End-All-Wars/dp/B00021R7BM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To End All Wars</a>&nbsp;screenwriter Brian Godawa from his book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hollywood-Worldviews-Watching-Films-With-Wisdom-Discernment/dp/0830823212/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hollywood Worldviews: Watching Films With Wisdom & Discernment</a>.",1261785600,,7728,5.498313659359191
3934251,5,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron's ""Avatar"" is a brilliant, well-written and superbly crafted look at life on Pandora, a mining outpost manned by ex-US servicemen. The problem is that the locals, a blue-skinned band of ""savage"" cat people, is sitting right on top of the planet's biggest lode of mineral wealth. What's an imperialist power (with investors demanding a fat quarterly bottom line) to do?

This is one of the most visually exciting and innovative movies I have ever seen. The scenes in the primeval forest are breath-taking. Phosphorescent plants illuminate the night. Tiny animals -- a cross between jellyfish and downy seedlings -- float about, like blessings from a beneficent deity. The people live in the Home Tree, an enormous elaborate self-contained habitat that is of a piece with the rest of the planet. The animals are terrifying and thrilling -- 6-legged horses, blue and orange variegated pterodactyl-like birds, packs of sleek,black dog-like animals. The scenery is equally astounding -- full of floating mountains, cascading waterfalls, tendrils and gigantic plants. Avatar is a visual feast that outdoes even ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy in raw beauty and inventiveness.

I also loved the ""plausible enough"" premise that the Earthlings needed to develop inhabitable bodies to try to communicate with the ferals in the forest. Sigourney Weaver was terrific as chain-smoking Grace, a no-nonsense scientist who wants to study Pandora's habitat. Sam Worthington was fine as Jake Sully, a wheelchair-bound Marine who finds freedom from his injuries when controlling his own Avatar.

But the film's message is as hard to miss as the gigantic Home Tree itself. Avatar pits militaristic, spiritually-bankrupt and greedy exploiters against a warrior-shaman race that lives in harmony with its surroundings. The film's extraordinary special effects and it weird, terrifying creatures aside, it is almost impossible to see it as anything but an elaborate allegory of the history of the Western powers over the last few hundred years. The cat people are modeled physically on African and American Indian physiognomy, culture and body decoration. Their spirituality is entwined deeply with the natural world they co-inhabit. And if you fail to get the parallel, there no mistaking the African-themed music that pounds out of the theater speakers. Anyone doubting Cameron's critique need only read the histories of the Caribbean under the Spanish, the Philippines and the US West under the Americans, Vietnam under the French, the Congo under the Belgians, and South Africa under the Dutch and the British. It's astounding and fairly courageous for Cameron to have conceived of such an attack against the dark side of his own culture, and to make it into an appealing blockbuster at the same time.

Though movie fans will note borrowings from ""Lord of the Rings,"" Apocalypse Now"" and ""Star Wars,"" Avatar stands as an extraordinary achievement on several fronts -- artistic, technological and political. It will likely be a huge contender at the next Oscars.",1261785600,4,3056,5.3078512396694215
3934252,5,B002HEXVUI,"There are already lots of reviews posted that rave about this ""fantastic"" movie Avatar. I won't re-hash most of what has already been posted... but, wanted to put my 2 cents worth in.
By far, Avatar is one of the best SyFy movie I have ever seen. The new CGI Technology is nothing short of spectacular. To fully experience the spellbinding quality of  this movie, you must see it in Digital 3-D. (Preferably iMax 3-D). WARNING!!!! Some theaters are showing this movie in 3-D... but not Digital 3-D! Which is stupid... and the equivalent of eating Pizza with no sauce or cheese. Or buying an HDTV, then using an analog box with it.

My husband and I saw it Christmas night and were blown away!
What I don't ""get""... are the ""So-So"" even some ""deeply negative"" reviews I read before seeing the movie. I can only conclude that the unflattering reviews are based on what is ""PC"" (in their eyes)... and personally, I'm sick of it.
I don't care that Sigourney Weaver smoked a couple of cigarettes on screen. I don't care that the U.S. Military was made into the ""bad-guy"".
This movie did not make me want to smoke, or hate our military.  It's a Damn good Movie! Lighten-up!
I loved the story line. No, it's not the ""deepest"" or ""most complex"" movie I've ever seen... but you will find yourself REALLY caring about the characters in the movie.
Over the past few years, the vast majority of movies (especially SyFy movies) have been boring. Mostly because ""they"" paid too much attention to the special effects and almost none to the story.

The film is spectacular but I would say no more than your average 3D film made for Imax. The script/story is full of cliches, predictable, naive and disappointing for a film that took allegedly 12 years to  make and was so expensive. I especially ""loved"" how the US army pushed from the plane, literally, using several soldiers, the gigantic bomb to drop on sacred site. So the equipment they had for this was from the I World War?? And why the bomb looked like 1000 coke cans tied together with an adhesive tape??? Ridiculous. Of course if they were to use the normal way of dropping the bomb the natives would have stood no chance, so Cameron went for this rubbish. And so it goes in this movie, for ex. how on earth did they manage to steal the battle helicopter from the US military base?? Cameron is supposedly full of respect for ""native"" culture but in the end it is a former US Marine who has to save the natives and lead them to a fight. What a condescending, mediocre tripe of a script. In hte end, could this one battle decide the outcome of the war?? Of course not, so why make the entire movie about it?? If the survival of the US super power depended on it surely they would later return with more firepower?? And I wonder why the scene in which the hero ""conquers"" the dragon to ride him looks almost like a rape, without sexuality of course. Was it on purpose or just so? He subjugates a less intelligent creature by brutal force and since then it ""will serve him for ever"" Was Cameron ""drinking"" to religion here? And later in the film the hero abandons the dragon anyway, when he has to upgrade his ride. If Cameron really aimed to hide some deeper general sense in this it would be interesting to find out. And the music score could and should have been much better, more memorable if they had so much time to do this.

3934254,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar deserves a 5-star rating not merely because of the technical accomplishments which are myriad, but for the coalescing of film, science, adventure, space exploration, and religion.

3-D was experimented on first when this reviewer was a child, and shelved because of an outpouring of objections from petty to real.  The field was considered to be worthless and forever abandoned.

Advancements in film, under the aegis of CGI in particular, meld with this present age to flower the perfect day to reintroduce this course of media to a world waiting for an exponentially advancing vision to keep pace with the surging knowledge explosion.

Observations as critiques suggesting shallowness in the storyline of Avatar are not unlike the initial reactions of many seeing the first 'Rocky.'

Subliminal wars such as intellect versus brawn, sensitivity against perceived reality, and the ever-dominating challenge of loyalty battle throughout the frontlines of what has become perhaps the first of a genre of experimental epics that will shove past the frontiers of concious acceptance, racing for the ends of time.

Recognition of borrowed beliefs from religions across the eras grind into status quo foundations, demanding what is right from wrong.

Only the initiate traverses the crest and grasps the skyline of nothingness made bare with the skeletons of man's failures.

OK, this is the most astonishing movie I have ever seen. First word I heard leaving the theater was 'amazing!' No doubt about it.

I won't discuss the plot. Suffice it to say the plot is good, but nothing, I repeat NOTHING can match the special effects of the 3-D. Plot aside, this movie is a visual feast for the senses. The flight and fight scenes are magnificent.

Here's the least you need to know:

1. It's the best of all the action movies rolled into one. Sort of like Lord of Rings meets Jurassic Park meets Dances with Wolves meets Tarzan meets Transformers meets Narnia meets Rambo meets Eragon meets Apocalypto meets Dragonslayer--meets the most realistic video game you ever played! (You get the picture? You're IN the picture!)

2. It is 'new age' all the way. Christians will sneer at the Earth Mother, reincarnation, tree-loving motif. The 'we are all one with nature' theme isn't pushed ad absurdum, but if you aren't into it--better get used to it.

3. It's a long movie--nearly three hours, and the parking lot was packed here in Lexington. Be sure you have your snack in hand and your 'business' taken care of.

4. There's a lot of cursing--somewhat overdone in my opinion--so keep that in mind when you take the kids. The only thing remotely sexual is the 'hair-bonding' ritual (now THAT was interesting...) so sexuality is not much of an issue. There is a lot of creature 'death' however.

5. The ending is as predictable as it is inevitable in this 'nature versus machine' extravaganza. Sort of makes you empathize with how the Aztecs must have felt when they saw Cortez coming with the  metal! The last hour of so is truly the Armageddon scenario for the world of Pandora. If you're not worn out from being pounded with the visuals and Dolby super-sound, well--just buckle your seatbelts and enjoy the final ride! Nevertheless, I couldn't help joining the applause at the closing credits.

6. Finally, the special effects are astounding. You'll be reaching for the floating jellyfish 'tree seeds', dodging the flying dragon-birds, marveling at the rare mineral unobtanium's anti-gravity effect on the Hallelujah floating mountains, choking in the underwater scene, and cringing at the drops (and falls and jumps) off cliffs! This stuff is so good you quickly stop asking yourself how they did it, and simply sit there and experience it. You really are IN the movie!

There you have it, without giving away anything. Bottom line? Just pay the extra bucks and get the glasses, appreciate the creative mind that could come up with such a story, and get lost for three hours in a world of sight and sound you cannot imagine (only the smell is missing!). If this is a preview of the future of TV, I'm reserving my 3-D model right now! Wow!",1261699200,110,2829,4.741344195519348

For someone who is an artist and sci-fi/fantasy writer herself, I was in a state of bliss watching the utter exotic beauty of this created world and the sentient beings who live upon it. This is old fashioned movie watching as in when you were a kid, eyes wide and shoving popcorn in your mouth.  The two and a half hours fly by.

3934257,4,B002HEXVUI,"It is the year 2154, and Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) arrives on the planet Pandora, which is home to a rare mineral needed back on earth.  Scientists there have created ""avatars"" which are a cross between humans and the indigenous blue Na'vi people; Sully is asked to use his avatar to befriend the locals and get them to leave the area so mining can expand.

The movie blends live actors and computer-generated scenes and its story  reminded me a lot of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FernGully-The-Last-Rainforest/dp/B000A9QK78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FernGully: The Last Rainforest</a>; both have innocent Mother Earth-loving natives pitted against evil, nature-hating  industrialists, lush forests with a pleasing color palette of greens, pinks, and purples, and even a sacred tree.  This movie is lovely to look at and the 3-D effects are fun, even if much of it does seem like a fancy comic book.  The actors are all fine, the animation is well-done, and the script is predictable but exciting.  Recommended for fans of animation, action, and adventure.",1261699200,2,1107,5.713414634146342
3934258,5,B002HEXVUI,"In Medieval India, Sanskrit was the spoken language and `AVATAR' is a Sanskrit word, meaning incarnation. Most of the Gods of the Indian pantheon had several Avatars or incarnations. I saw `AVATAR' the first day, it was released worldwide. Like most of the other reviewers have done, I will not spoil the suspense for you by narrating the story in detail. Suffice to say that it's a great extravaganza. A film that is seen only once in a lifetime. One has to see the film with a totally open mind. Erase all concepts and stories of films till this day and absorb this film into your heart. No wonder James Cameron had the idea brewing for such a long period and finally decided to make the movie in 2009. Needless to say that the film might even surpass BENHUR and TITANIC and go on to take to win 12 Academy Awards creating Motion Picture history. The film is truly awesome. I felt that I was being transported to another plane of existence.  The Visual Effects, Sound, Sound-Editing are all out of this world. The Make-up and Costumes are superb. It was heartening to see Sigourney Weaver and James Cameron working together again.  The negative character of the General, portrayed by Stephen Lang, is so realistic that audiences were literally cheering in joy whenever Lang's character took a beating. I have yet to see a portrait of a villain so uniquely done. Hats off to Mr. Lang and I personally think that he should be honoured with the Best Supporting Actor Statuette.",1261699200,2,1476,4.6513409961685825
3934259,5,B002HEXVUI,"AVATAR will blow your mind.  See it in IMAX if at all possible; if not, opt for 3-D, but do not see the 2-D.  You need to experience this movie as a viscerally as possible.  At once a corny diatribe against war-mongering, and a not-so-subtle cry for ""greenery"" (aka WALL-E), this is so much more than a movie.  AVATAR transcends whatever your expectation might be - based on the somewhat baffling, weird previews, and based on your collective knowledge of James Cameron's showmanship at the movies (kickass movies that linger - and hold up! - but each with a distinctive look, and YES, heart!) The heartbeat of this wildly conceived story is what will make you remember it.  The palpable love story between the two lead characters, as well as the story of one soul's salvation from certain doom, are the things that make this Pocahontas-Jurassic Park-Aliens adventure work so brilliantly.  I've already said too much - you need to SEE this thing to believe it, and trust me - you WILL.",1261612800,3,985,4.6976744186046515
3934260,5,B002HEXVUI,"I won't repeat the storyline because it's described in the other reviews. I just wanted to add that this movie is creative genius. Cameron created a new world, and it was amazing. There was no time that I thought I was looking at CG. It was completely believable and magnificent. He created planets, plant and tree life like you've never imagined, mountains that float in the air that couldn't have looked more real if they were real, a species of people that are visually beautiful (different enough to be alien, but similar enough to us so that we can relate to them), with a culture, language, spiritual life, biology and behaviors all their own. It was spectacular from that perspective. With the 3-D, the audience gets to walk through the amazing new world and discover the wildlife and plant life along with the lead character. We even get to fly. Wow.

One thing I found interesting was that the film didn't rely on old 3-D tricks.  As a matter of fact, I forgot I was watching a 3-D film, because everything was so natural and flowed.

If I had one wish and could have contributed to this film, I would have asked for more emotional development between the main characters. In Cameron's Titanic, the audience feels the depth of the love and commitment between Rose and Jack in a way that moves you as far as I think a movie can. There is a love story in this movie, and it's done nicely. However having experienced what Cameron COULD create in Titanic, I think it could have been taken up a notch. I also think that perhaps Cameron could have used a litttle humor to draw in the audience more.  But I don't want to be too critical here, because I believe that this was a breakthrough movie that everyone should see.

We saw it at an IMAX theater, and in my opinion this is the optimal way to see this movie. There's nothing like it, and it's indescribably different and better than seeing it in a regular theater.",1261612800,7,1921,4.492836676217765
3934261,5,B002HEXVUI,"My wife and I saw this opening weekend and we both loved it. I am tempted to suggest this should get 4.5 stars because I expect more from James as far as story goes, but then I think about the complete and awesome development of the world and animals and I'm back up to 5 stars.

And now for my guide on How to properly view AVATAR:

1. Go see it in 3D. It is worth the extra money to upgrade the experience. It would still be good in 2D but the 3D is done at a new level for 3D (I've seen a number of 3D movies and nothing has compared to this). FINALLY, someone has made a good, worthwhile reason to see a 3D movie!

2. Upgrade one more time and see it at IMAX if you have one available. The extra screen size would make it even more amazing, especially in the forests.

3. Keep in mind that the combat forces are mercenaries and not government military. They tell you this in the movie but it seems most people miss that brief piece of dialogue. (I hate it when movies use State and Federal troops (real heroes) as the bad guys.)

4. DO NOT let your mind compare it to Native American stories. Yeah, it is the same story and the blue people often look and sound like Indians, but suspend your memory of Dances With Wolves and history class and enjoy the movie as a fresh experience. (You might also have to temporarily purge ""Kaena"" and ""Final Fantasy: Spirits Within""... so, yeah, the story is not original at all, but the world around the story sure as heck is!)

5. DO NOT drink a liter of cola during the first hour. It is almost 3 hours long but it goes by as if it were a 90 minute movie. I can't think of any parts where you would want to spend 5 minutes trecking to the bathroom.  The theater was packed and nobody made a sound for the duration of the movie, so I'd take that as a sign that most other people were as glued to the screen as I was.

6. Last but most important: just go Experience It!  This movie is worth supporting by seeing it at an expensive 3D showing, first-run theater.  I say ""Experience It"" because, even if you took all of the story elements out, it would still be a fantastic experience.  The world that has been created is AMAZING and, thankfully, much of the movie feels almost like a safari where you are enveloped in that new world.  It really is an experience.",1261612800,6,2301,4.157657657657658
3934262,5,B002HEXVUI,"The most special effects I've seen in a movie. They probably used $1.5 million per minute. You can't see the difference between computer generated people and ordinary people anymore, between what's real and what is special effects. The movie is one of the best ever made.

The story was a bit predictable, but the rest was all a surprise.",1261612800,3,338,4.728813559322034
3934263,4,B002HEXVUI,"Was ""Avatar"" a three or a four star movie?  Dang tough choice, because this show has the best eye candy I've ever seen.  Spectacular 3-D effects, battle sequences, colors and shapes all fill the screen.  At the same time it's pure Hollywood formula and cliche.  Other reviewers have remarked on its similarities to ""Dances with Wolves,"" and we can mention the recently released ""Battle for Terra"" which has a similar theme.

That theme consists of a technologically superior western (or human) civilization, spearheaded by shoot-first militarists, come to exploit a primitive people who are naturally in touch with Gaia/Mother Earth/The Great Spirit/What Have You.  In ""Avatar"" Jake Sully is the crippled Marine who works with a science team as an avatarist studying Pandora's aboriginal tribes.  He, along with a few others, control huge bodies which resemble the natives.  He's also recruited by the military to ferret out the native tribe's weaknesses and possible negotiating points.  Behind the military is, of course, the obligatory heartless businessman there to exploit whatever resources are in demand at any cost.

Accidentally separated from his group, Sully is first spared his life by the princess of the local tribe (the Na'vi) when a seed of the Holy Tree settles on her arrow.  She later saves his life from a pack of hairless jackals-on-steroids and is eventually adopted into her village.  Like the Kevin Costner character in ""Dances with Wolves,"" Sully goes native.

Some might consider bits of the following to be spoilers, but if you know anything of typical Hollywood plots none of this will come as a surprise or twist.  Sully sails through his rites of passage while balancing his double agent act with the science team and the military.  He and the princess fall in love and mate, then there's the obligatory crisis where he falls out with the princess and her tribe when the humans gather to attack the Great Tree where they live.  But he later does something only the great Na'vi legends speak of, regains his prestige in the tribe and the love of his mate, and leads the counterattack against the humans.

The tribe has only bows and arrows and flying reptilian beasts to use against the modern technological juggernaut the humans have.  Yet it, apparently with help from the tribal deity Eywa, prevails.  It's an exciting war to watch with James Cameron's superb special effects, but entirely unbelievable that the tribe could overcome such firepower.  Every possible movie cliche is dragged out, including a final mano a mano combat between Sully's avatar and the military commander.  You can probably guess how that turned out.

Rating this movie depends on what you want to emphasize.  It has an entirely unoriginal, totally derivative plot revolving around hoary cliches and several one-dimensional characters.  There're the mumbo-jumbo earthy (in this case Pandoran) connections to nature contrasted with advanced civilization's cold technology.  But it was great fun to watch, entertaining as all get-out, and has the usual satisfying ending.  Catch this movie in the theater if you can.  No home screen can do ""Avatar"" visual justice.",1261612800,,3170,5.128654970760234
3934264,3,B002HEXVUI,"My family and I went and saw the Avatar movie this past weekend. I have to say, Avatar certainly lived up to its $400 million budget! I was impressed by the computer graphics, which were definitely innovative. The acting was good, and I liked the storyline.

Avatar is about a planet called Pandora. In the year 2154, Americans have established a base on Pandora and are mining a special resource. Marines are used on the base for protection purposes, because the native populations are unwelcoming. Scientists are also on the base, attempting to research the planet. Their research is done using avatars, a human/native hybrid that is made using the DNA of a specific researcher. This allows a researcher to form a link with the avatar that is made from their DNA through a mental link. The research team, with the help of a Marine, worked to befriend the local population. Unfortunately for the researchers and locals, Americans possess an unquenchable thirst for expansion.

The acting in the movie was great. Sam Worthington played a Marine, and did a great job with his role. He has a certain attitude, which you can hear in his narration, which lends to his tough-guy persona. The other actors played their parts well, although I can't say anyone's acting was a stand-out performance. The costumes were great, although they too, were nothing stellar. The avatars were a combination of the actors and computer animation, and looked cool. You can definitely tell they are animated, but the animation blends perfectly with the scenes so the visual effects are fantastic!

Unfortunately, regardless of all the flashy graphics and the enjoyable plot, I found the movie borderline offensive! It's been a very long time since I saw a movie which was so blatantly racist. Normally when I watch a movie, I just watch it for enjoyment and don't bother analyzing the story. Unfortunately, my brain seems to have been on that evening, because from early on in the film, all I could do was think about how racist the film was. When we walked out of the theatre, the first thing my dad mentioned was how racist/stereotypical the movie was! The locals on Pandora were portrayed as very primitive. They worn loin cloths, war paint, and headdresses. They whooped their war cries, and had no stronger weapons than bows and arrows while the U.S. Marines laughed at their pitiful weaponry.

I suppose my issue with this movie was that I don't understand why Americans feel the need to portray native populations as primitive. Yes, we do have a lot of technology and an awesome military, however that doesn't mean we're entitled to portray ourselves as culturally superior! I grasp that they didn't want to stick to the stereotypical alien that is technologically advanced, however it was almost like we were laughing at primitive cultures. I was not a fan.

That being said, it's an enjoyable movie so long as you are watching it at face value and not really paying attention to subtext... which I know is how most people watch movies. So go ahead and go see the movie and make your own judgment as to whether you like it or not! The graphics are cool and the storyline is great, so I'm sure most people would enjoy it!",1261526400,3,3205,4.788426763110308
3934265,5,B002HEXVUI,"If you enjoyed ""Dances With Wolves"" (sans Tatonka) and you appreciate the best computer generated special effects available today, then you'll love ""Avatar.""  It really is fun.

I won't take any points off for the story.  It's a good one, but it's a common one which goes something like this:  Explorers from far away arrive in a new world and the explorers want something.  However, there is a problem in the form of an indigenous population.  One very special individual among the explorers who is both brave and open-minded is chosen to make contact with the natives.  He meets a female member of the tribe and her fatherwho happens to be the chief directs her to learn as much as she can from the stranger.  The explorer and the girl fall in love as they learn from one another.  In the meantime, the rest of the explorers get impatient.  They want what they came for so they initiate a fight.  At first, the interlopers seem like they'll destroy the natives without a problem.  Then, that one brave man does the right thing and turns back his own, albeit misguided, small-minded people.  In the end, he decides to stay behind with his woman.

Sound familiar?  It is.  The first part of the story is Disney's ""Pocahontas"" or more recently, ""The New World"" which featured Q'Orianka Kilcher.  The second part of the story is ""Dances With Wolves.""  That's okay, because those are good stories and I really didn't mind seeing them again.  In this case, the natives are computer generated images; the role of John Smith/John Dunbar is played by Sam Worthington as Jake Sully.  Pocahontas/Stands With Fist is the voice of Zoe Soldana (who I really like) as Neytiri.  The protagonist, the leader of the explorers is Stephen Lang who plays Marine Colonel Miles Quaritch.  Sigourney Weaver even has a role as the hard-nosed but understanding scientist.  Weaver adds to an ""Alien"" feel to the project.  Instead of North America, the new world is actually a new world.  It's called Pandora.  Instead of Indians, the native people are called the Na'vi.  The difference between the older versions and ""Avatar,"" aside from the actors, is the special effects which are extraordinary.

Think of the film that has the best special effects you've seen.  Was it one of the recent ""Star Wars"" films?  ""Up?""  ""Walking With Dinosaurs?""  Whatever it is, ""Avatar"" is at least half again as good as that.  The images of the Na'vi are extremely realistic.  The fauna are dinosauresqe and relatively credible in terms of anthropology and evolution.  (I wouldn't be surprised if scientists in those fields were enlisted for consults.)  The landscapes are breathtaking.

The effects will not disappoint.

Getting back to the story, like ""Pocahontas"" and ""Dances With Wolves,"" there is an underlying political message which I believe most movie-goers won't mind.  Some may.  It comes down to the European Caucasian imperialists are ruining the planet; there is a reference made by Worthington's character, Jake Sully, that the humans had already destroyed their planet and would do the same thing on Pandora if the Na'vi did not repel them.  Fine.  So, for reactionary viewer, you may have to bite your tongue a little.  Frankly, get over it if only to enjoy the film.  It's ground-breaking.",1261526400,8,3265,4.890310786106033
3934266,5,B002HEXVUI,"Best 2010 Picture and one of the best movies in history, whether the Academy likes it or not!!!
The ceremony of the Oscars was obviously partialized to give the awards to ""The Hurt Locker"" which is an excellent movie great directing but totally forgettable.  When I saw it, I found it to be a good war related movie.  The end was shockingly empty and depressive, I got the message... but that was it.  I left the theater and 2 days later was it totally forgotten, why because acting and directing well is not enough to make a good epic movie... there were some holes that needed to be covered (see my comments for the ""Hurt Locker"")
I can not say the same thing about AVATAR, I saw this movie last year and I still have it in my mind pounding in my heart and for the millions of people who have carefully watched,  understood and appreciated AVATAR I can assure that they will have it in their minds and hearts not just because of the Na'vis, Pandora Creatures, the Outrageous Cinematography, or the Outstanding Visual Effects & Technology used... they will have AVATAR dearly close to them because of the message is sending to the world, we're killing our planet and all that lives in it including ourselves, we invent and make wars to own what is not ours no matter what... the global warming is a fact NOW and a big problem for the human kind, people is dying every day because of its consequences and nobody cares, because of ignorance, greed or pure evil.  It is our turn now to take action to stop this massacre that our Governments or industrial s pursue in order to take, own, control, and steal from others their goods.
Some say that AVATAR was full of clichs... a clich is a convenient word used to diminish an action that supposedly has been used too frequently that eventually loses its meaning.  Well it is the life of our planet we are talking about here and there will never be enough clichs to call the attention to this matter.  Pandora was used as a representation of our planet in they way it was intended to be rich for all of us to share, peaceful and spiritually pleasant; but Pandora was destroyed the same way we do in real life, just next to my door I can see devastation and nobody cares.  When a truth is slapped in your face some people use very conveniently the word clich.  ""The Academy"" tried to diminish AVATAR success by ignoring it in the Oscars.  Well despite the obvious, hilarious and ridiculous attitude of the Academy past Sunday I have to say that see if James Cameron cares, he's has done his part already, and he's got the BIG $$$,$$$,$$$,$$$.$$ (billions in his bank) and not the ones that were awarded.
James Cameron:
The Academy needed for personal/political/social reasons to give the awards to: a woman period... someone that has not been awarded period... some even said that it was something you said in the 1998 ceremony.  Well whatever excuse I've heard or read in the news just don't mind them and keep the good work, because you're excellent and perfect in what you do and you do it flawlessly.",1261526400,6,3047,4.511796733212341
3934267,2,B002HEXVUI,"This thing will no doubt win those special effects, cinematography, etc. awards, but please, its a B movie plot and dialog that you might expect to see on the Scifi channel, in fact the dialog is almost unbearable at times.  Sigourney Weaver's character was terrible, nothing like her parts in Alien.  The only part of the movie that I thought was effective was the battle scene at the end, but you have to wade through 2 hours of crap before you get to that part.

Something odd about the 10ft blue people, are we to believe that all the males and females in a tropical forest setting could be runway model perfect?  All the males are thin and muscled and all the females are thin and small breasted(old and young).

Something odd about the costumes to, I have seen enough documentaries about indigenous tribes in tropical settings and the women don't typically wear anything covering their breasts, and I never really saw any thongs on them either.  You would expect that a creature with a tail would be more animal like and not have the modesty these creatures showed.  Even shooting for PG-13 they could have had a little more realism here and there.

There was a blatant ripoff of Eragon(winged flying thing that gets chosen for life).  The only thing that would have saved this mess is to have toned out the bad language(which added nothing to the movie anyway) and made it a PG rated kids movie.

3934268,5,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron has possibly given movies a new life where 2D movies just do not compare to a 3D visual sensory extravaganza. Going to a theater once again feels worthwhile. This movie is possibly the closest you could get to experiencing what life could possibly be on another planet. I was constantly amazed at the little details like a shrinking plant, a lizard with a parachute thing, bio-connection with other lifeforms and so many other little things within the movie.

The story was not too unique and from a sci-fi perspective, there are better stories out there (Enders Game for example). But what this movie has done is to create a benchmark for a new genre of 3D computer generated movies. The benchmark being both in detail and production quality.

This is possibly the first time I have seen a movie where despite a lukewarm story, I still was 100% focused on the movie and left the theater with the feeling of having experienced a new civilization. It took me some time to digest all that I saw within this movie and I may do another trek to the theater to look at the finer details in the forests once more.

There is a strong eco-friendly and anti-war message throughout the movie with the good and bad guys clearly defined. This one is a monumental work and definitely worth watching.",1261440000,3,1299,4.639130434782609
3934269,2,B002HEXVUI,"You on that stuff, man? Cause 5 stars... I love great sci-fi and fantasy. BEST movie in a long time??? No. Just considering sci-fi, ""District 9"" BLOWS Avatar away in every way, including special effects. Dialog, plot, special effects(!)character development, editing, music -- thumbs down.

The characters are simple and boring. The dialog is soo unbearably cliche and lame...I'm not a big fan of the U.S. Marine Corps but what a Hollywood liberal slap-in-the-face. Not that real Marines should care and, btw, when people have a job to do it helps for them to LOVE it and be enthusiastic. Also, if it happens to be a job that risks your life and require you to be brutal, your going to create psychological defense mechanisms to deal, or you'll crack. That's why Marines are gung-ho and crazy. They murder people for a living. The aliens are as one-dimensional as the Blackwater/Marines. Just like as is fashionable these days with American Indians and all tribal peoples, they are presented as simpletons full of pure goodness in touch with nature. This romantic, fictional view is not truly respectful of native people. Never mind this hippie alien dialog... but at lest they don't refer to a made-up metaphysical realm --their planet really is conscious and communicating with them, unlike Earth to our New Age humans.

These scientists... well if they care about Earth Mother, time to pack it in because their whole project and science is built on exploitation of nature. Need natural resources and money from those resources as corporate- cliche jerk Giovanni Ribisi rightly points out. But, so maybe we can exploit the people and Earth more nicely, with a happy face. You bribe the locals, build some stuff for them, speak their language. ""Win hearts and minds"". Which is what corporations would typically prefer anyway when it is possible. When not, well THEN you call in the Marines and make the natives bad guys. Same old story. Same old story. If you love the Gaia theory (at least it's real on Pandora)and New Age philosophy this will be a movie you will love and cherish till it is time to return to mother spirit or and ""give back your energy"" with the ancestors.

Avatar is such a simplistic, ham-fisted message movie I was amazed. Are we supposed to actually be moved and care about it's ""message"" or just enjoy the effects?? In this manichean fairy-morality tale military and business = bad, scientists are...meh...kinda neutral, and indigenous generic Native American/African/island peoples aliens are = good. Characters and roles all one-dimension. Do people need this kinda propaganda and oversimplification of reality to actually care that in reality right NOW WE ARE DESTROYING THE REAL WORLD?? Who actually cares? You know the the oceans are being so over-fished Japan is having trouble getting it's sushi? Hip, moral liberals should care about that *especially*. That should be enough to put down that micro-brew and get busy! (Or never-mind Obama is in office, so it's all good.) Your part of the problem, just like Sigourney Weaver. But seriously, right now mining companies are removing _entire mountains_ in Appalachia. It's called, fittingly, ""mountain top removal"". And Avatar points out Iraq so heavy-handedly I had to laugh. Jesus that dialog. It was insulting. It was for the children I guess. Or Fox News views. Anyway, so a war in Afghanistan is escalating! C'mon let's do something. Or maybe just watch a multi-million dollar Hollywood movie and pretend we did.

Obviously the major draw is eye candy, as always. Avatar special effects are supposed to ""change how movies are made"". Starts off bad: the space ship? OK, not looking real. Pretty flat. The aliens looked really cool: about as real as CGI can look in 2010 (not including the amazing District 9 pawns which are incredible) ,but I liked their design. I skipped the 3-D but have repeatedly heard it isn't too fantastic. The Pandora rain forest often looked like an almost real CGI rain forest. Some of the trees and plants were amazing, especially the tribe's home. The animals of Pandora aren't too absurd, except for the giant beast with a couple of feathers it's back. The whole world should be called planet Psilocybin, but that makes it sound cooler than what it is. The night time shots with all the glow-in-the-dark, tripy black-light lifeforms is very pretty, but crossed the line into kitsch.

It all looked familiar --plot, characters, imagery. But not in good way, the way a good myth hits deep with archetypes. Avatar has been compared to a children's cartoon called ""Ferngully"". Calling the planet Pandora is lame and clues you into how much care and originality was given to the story.

Actually, hippies and New Agers and ESPECIALLY environmentalists and anti-war activists deserve much better than films like ""Avatar"".

3934270,5,B002HEXVUI,"AVATAR is a tough movie to review and perhaps even tougher to put a score on.  On one hand, it is technically (or technologically, if you will) one of the most stunning, game-changing movies you'll see.  It makes you feel what audiences seeing the original KING KONG must have felt...a sense of what was POSSIBLE in movies that you never knew before.

On the other hand, the story it tells is pedestrian and predictable in many ways.  Remember how James Cameron's TITANIC took  a lot of heat for having a poor script?  AVATAR is much the same...while its romantic scenes aren't as painful as the ones George Lucas penned for Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen in the latest STAR WARS epics...they aren't exactly convincing either.

If the movie were measured purely by storytelling, acting and all the conventional items we usually judge movies by, it would be a solid 3 out of 5.  If we were to judge it purely on technical merit, it's perhaps a 10 out of 5.  (And while I'm thinking of it, let me say right here and now that this movie MUST, MUST, MUST be seen in 3D.  In most movies, even with today's current excellent technology, 3D is a ""nice"" add-on.  It's integral to the enjoyment of AVATAR.  So get out there and see it in a theater!)

AVATAR is set about 150 years in the future.  Earth has apparently become a bit of a desert, and so mankind (or at least a corporation eerily similar to Halliburton and a military eerily similar to the one liberals apparently think Dick Cheney would run) has invaded the planet of Pandora, where a rare mineral named Unobtanium exists in abundance.  Problem is, the Humanoid species on the top of the food chain there, the Na'Vi, live in a giant, wondrous tree that is right on top of the biggest deposit of Unobtanium.  In the best tradition of all movies where the clumsy, conniving, greedy and bloodthirsty white men yearn to trample over the differently-colored, close-to-the-earth natives in order to earn money, AVATAR draws no ethically gray areas.  The Na'Vi are 100% the good guys, and the military/corporate interests are bad.  In the middle is a tiny group of scientists who yearn to study and learn from the Na'Vi and Pandora, and to perhaps obtain a sort of peace between the two species.  A diplomatic solution (as someone says).  The scientists, led by Sigourney Weaver in a strange, tone-deaf  performance, are interested in building schools, learning the language and seemingly don't  understand that the company's patience is at an end.  Why build a school if it doesn't result in a pile of Unobtanium?

Into the mix, we throw a paralyzed soldier, whose brother was one of Weaver's team.  He had been about to have an Avatar grown from him when he was killed.  So his brother (Sam Worthington) is talked into taking over the Avatar, and using it to befriend (and spy on) the Na'Vi.  What's an avatar?  It's basically an empty Na'Vi that has been created by blending DNA from the Na'Vi with the DNA of the specific human destined to use the avatar.  Once the avatar is fully grown, the human can ""inhabit"" it by having his consciousness transferred to it.  Worthington agrees to do this when his colonel (Stephen Lang, in a gloriously over-the-top performance) promises that his legs will be repaired if he can deliver good intelligence on the Na'Vi.

You might guess that when Worthington enters the 10 foot tall, blue but able-bodied Avatar, he becomes hooked not only on having mobility again, but is enchanted by the lovely planet and his lovely female guide and teacher (Zoe Saldana).  Conflict ensues when the information he has gathered is used against the Na'Vi, whom he now loves and wishes to protect.

This mundane story, full of clichs that are almost laughable in their earnestness, becomes almost secondary to the experience that is Pandora.  It is a beautiful, lush planet filled with unusual plants and animals.  Creatures that show remarkable imagination from Cameron and crew.  We are shown one swooping vista after another that takes our breath away.  There are flying creatures, something like dragons, that Worthington and the other Na'Vi fly...and we truly get a sense of flying (making stuff like the flying scenes in HARRY POTTER look amateurish).  The depth of the 3D is like nothing you've seen before.  Layer after layer of jungle, mountains, and people.  The movie is gorgeous in a way that I've never experienced.  I'm a somewhat jaded moviegoer, and my 22 year old son has a 2nd career being jaded...but we were both blown away by how COOL this movie is.

I've barely touched on who wondrous this film is in so many ways.  I don't think I really have the vocabulary to describe how happy I was to be seeing it.  It's a longish film (160 minutes)...but I did not want it to be over.  I wanted to see some more of Pandora.

And the movie was also greatly assisted by a grounded and capable performance by Sam Worthington (who also made TERMINATOR SALVATION watchable).  He's a rugged, manly actor...but his performance is self-effacing and open to the wonder that is Pandora.  We experience it mostly through his eyes, and his reactions inform our understanding.  I think this guy now needs a more down to earth, non-sci-fi film to really show us what he's got.

Cameron is a great director in many ways.  While his scripts are often a bit uninspired...he knows how to construct a story.  It takes a long time for AVATAR to come to its real ""action"" scenes...but Cameron knows that if he's built everything up correctly, made us care about the right people, understand the stakes and simply feel the tension...then finally getting the payoff makes things work so much better.  The battle scenes are pretty impressive, and worth the wait.

In the end, although I think there are some significant flaws (some sketchy performances and some clumsy writing), I must give the film top marks, because so many things aren't just right, they are revelatory.  Take your friends and family and experience AVATAR!",1261440000,4,5996,4.757751937984496
3934271,3,B002HEXVUI,"The hero is a grunt of the ""Jarhead Tribe"" which is to say, a Marine with a young, plain face, who wears two outstanding characteristics; (1) he is paraplegic and weelchair-bound, AND (2) he is twin brother whose sibling has only very recently taken the dirt nap.  Somehow he is drafted into a hyped-up ""Hearts and Minds"" effort to subvert a native population on a distant planet rich in strategic minerals as a last-minute replacement for that brother.

Here we are:  We find ourselves immediately on a recognizable next-generation Marine Outpost movie of Sci-Fi flicks like the second ALIEN movie, in the company of characters that seem virtually identical to those trigger-happy guys 'n gals, and not only that, there's a familiar, older version of Ripley.  She's a chain-smoking Science virago in an orange marcelled wig, and she's running the remote-conrtrol neuron-link ""Hearts and Minds"" thing, with irritable ineficiency, hampered by yet a new version of the Corporate A-hole smartypants.

The first scenes of what appears to be a fairly complex exposition, take place in a series of metal pre-fab shelters and control pods overlooking a landing field and exercise yard in which newer versions of Sci-Fi Military hardware grind, zip about, hover and stomp by.  (These would be newer, larger helicopters like olive-drab dragonflies; armed, transport battle-barges like Herculese lifters, but bigger with multiple fan-wings; and occasionally large armed steel exo-skeleton walkers out of the one Ripley debuted in her hand-to-hand battle with the Alien Queen, and the morphs of those machines the defenders of Zion used in MATRIX REVOLUTIONS.  The way the movie is laid out, this military-industrial complex is to this story as the modern version of the old Western Stockade of Indians vs. Cavalry movies would be.  (Its Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan again.)  Outside of the perimeter, a dangerous and hostile world of painted savages, and creature hungry for blood.

Ripley, here called GRACE, is diffident about the paraplegic replacement (Grunt) for her prize subject in the experiment, which depends on a kind of mind-meld between the human (controlling partner) and an artificially-grown replicant of one of the savage in habitants of this new star.  All the Grunt has is a twin's identical DNA to the dead replant-subject.  He hasn't been trained!  We glimpse the large humanoid the Grunt is to animate, floating in his tank of amniotic fluid, an elongated 8 or 9 foot male like a computer blend of an Massai warrior and a leopard, with yellow eyes and a tail and not-quite super physical powers.  He is about ready to be born, or activated.  The mind of this blue humanoid will be totally animated by the mind of the paraplegic grunt while he lies unconscious and dreaming in a kind of sensory deprivation box, wearing an electrical harness.  This enormously complex system will enable the Grunt to spy on the natives and to become 'one of them.'  That's the scheme.  Once he is accepted by the tribe or one of the tribes, he will persuade them to abandon their rights to the minerals coveted by the Americans.  Meanwhile, during those times he sleeps as an humanoid savage, awake and out of his box, the Grunt will betray whatever strategic information he learns while undercover.

Now, it happens that the Grunt is not the only human being to work in this way on these people; Grace herself also travels among the natives in a syntho-body, and we learn that it was she who so disguised set up what little contact and communication there is when she opened an english language school -- the equivalent of a Missionary School -- and made some progress with the foreign culture.  What progress there was, was taken over and is now completely controlled by the Corporation, and managed by a smug, unprincipled manager, aided by his harsh, bigoted military captain.

That's the set-up.  The rest is the beautiful wallpaper of artificially contrived flora and fauna, or ""nature"" of this planet PANDORA.  We are plunged into that colorful scenery when Grace takes her small crew into the jungle for a brief 'drop.'  There, the Grunt (who is often called stupid or inattentive) wanders away from his mates, following his senses in a new world of plant life that bears many of the characteristics of earthly acquatic life.  Aside from the flashy and benign life-forms, he contacts some dangerous mega-forms -- the Sci-Fi equivalnts of wild dogs and rinos and elephants -- and after losing himself completely in the phosphorescent gloom during a defensive fight against predatory animals, he is contacted by one of the natives, a female, who saves him by killing one of the predators.  He is as thrilled by the presence of the female of his species, as a teen-aged football hero would be, meeting the head cheerleader at a prom.  This biological truism is apt, because we fill find out soon enough, that the female is the Chief's daughter.  And this inescapable cliche is apparent when she leads him to the Great Tree (or village) of her people.  Then, true to form, we get a bit of renactment of the Pocahantas and John Smith situation, with grunts and body language right out of Central Casting in the generations of American movies where the native princess brings the white intruder to her village.  There, of course, he will have to prove himself in order to be accepted into the tribe.  And there, true to form yet again, the daughter of the chief will be instructed to teach him.  (Sometimes it's Polynesia, sometimes Arizona.  Gary Cooper did it in Kubelai Kahn's China, in MARCO POLO.)

All this is wildly delightful to the Americans back on base, as the Grunt awake and functioning on his own out of his box, tells his story reviews maps, and begins to narrate his daily diary.  One of the things he or his alter ego will do with the native people, is to find a mount in the native way.  Now, we've entered DANCES WITH WOLVES on steroids.  You see, the Princess rides or rather flies around, on a kind of blended or synthesized version of a flying dynasauer, (or peridactyl) but with the head modified to look like one of the flesh-eating earth-bound animals.  Beautiful animation.  She rides the thing through the skies like a rodeo trick rider, high-pitched shrieks and all.  Well, obviously the Grunt has to have one too; all the other males have theirs.  So, the group sets out for ""the land of floating mountains,"" where enormous vine-draped clods float or hover.  Its rather like a Chinese lamdscape painting on a mirror.  There, at the very tippy-tops of these mountains, in noisy nesting gaggles, the peridactyls live and squawk, crawling about not like birds, their wings folded against their pectorals, but like repriles who must walk on four legs, their extended skin-stretched digits folded.  Like a group of irritable umbrellas, they are annoyed by the intruders.  The Grunt must choose one, or as the Princess says in her Plains Indian way, it must choose him.  Well, that's done with a struggle, but the animators have chosen an interesting, parallel way to show the collaboration between mount and rider.  The beast's crest ends with a kind of long tassel.  All the natives, male and female, wear long braided pigtails.  What the Grunt must do is touch the end of his pigtail to the tassel of the flying lizard.  Tendrils will spring from both ends, grasp each other, entwine and be covered by a kind of skin cocoon.  That is the way the natives communicate with their mounts.

This pigtail tendril device is important because it is an unique method of joining with or tuning into various beings; trees, often.  And particulaarly the Soul Tree, or thickets of them, which is an essential part of the symbolism of Earth Worship and its resultant sympatico the natives have, and Americans (the Sky People) do not.  (NOTE: the tails of the Pandorians serve no spiritual function.)

The plot lumbers on:  The Grunt is accepted into the tribe and into the princess' arms in a mercifully brief Teen Love episode.  Meanwhile, inevitably, driven perhaps by Stock Market Pressures, the Company makes the first move by buldozing a sacred grove, one day, with bulldozers as big as those used in open pit mining.  There's an armed protest, which the natives cannot possibly win, but there's a stalemate wherein the Grunt's hidden identity is compromised.  Rows with the Princess.  Rows with the Chief and the Tribal Council.  Rows when the Grung's awake in the Strategy or Briefing area.  The Corporation intends to use the US Military to attack and destroy the giant Tree (native village) in order to capture the minerals underneath it.  Grace protests.  The Grunt protests.  Pleads for time to persuade the natives.  Granted little or none, and the attack takes place.  Fleets of olive-drab flying machines attack the tree with incendiary missiles and bring it down in flames.  Many natives are wounded.  The Chief is killed.  The Princess is PO'd.  The Grunt is driven away.  But...  But...  A prfoundly butch Latina-looking pilot deserts, refusing to fire on civilians, presumably (or civilian females) and returns to base.

At Headquarters the Grunt is relieved of his duty.  But, before he can be returned to earth, the Latina-traitor-chopper jockeyette facilitates a plot whereby the Grunt, one of his buddies and Grace, will be transported back into the bush, with one of their control pod dwellings, from which, in suspended animation, they will be able to re-enter and re-animate their native bodies and sieze control of the situation.  This is done, but the action animates headquarters, and the Corporation authorizes the Military to mount a full-scale bomb attack on the center of native culture, Soul Tree Central.

Drums.  Big music.  Everybody's on the march.  The armed might of the USA takes to the air for a little Shock and Awe.  The Grunt gets a mind-flash from native history and decides to appear as the Racial hero of the Planet, riding a mega-lizard.  He finds one, its orange and huge, captures it and appears to the assembled, dispirited people, a Geronimo among men.  Like a Fazenda bodybuilder in a loincloth, they accept him as leader and the word is sent out to all the people on the planet who hurry to join in the defense of the Soul Tree.  (It is the open air equivalent of the MATRIX's Zion.)  But, after a very interesting and colorful battle, though Grace is killed and cannot be regenerated, the natives win the war and the Military Sky People are sent back to Eath, their machines of war in ruins.  The moral seems to have been that you are not permitted to take whatever you want from others simply because you want it.

(Do I have that right?  The moral, I mean.  I wonder.)  One thing particularly sticks in my mind, more than any other in this elaborate and occasionally fascinating movie.  It is this detail from the great battle scene.  There's an actor who plays the formidably muscular and scarred Marine Commandant, ol' Steel Sphincter.  He looks the part and plays it well throughout the movie.  During the final battle scenes he's shown in the command cockpit of a huge bomber loaded with incindiary explosives, standing just behind the pilot's seat, huge muscular arms folded, giving orders.  His body is shown full length, with that of the seated pilot through the machine's window.  The camera is not far away, and we can see clearly that there is an emblem painted on the side of the plane, immediately under the window.  It's where one would expect to see one such war emblem.  Strangely, it is a painted Chinese dragon in red and white, with gold stripes, and one has the impression that the Commandant is standing on the back of, or riding the dragon in the angle of attack.  This shot only appears twice, and the second time the impression is inescapable.  This is the only time in the entire movie that any political or national emblem is seen.  We know these are Americans in the mobvie, on the planes, armed and in battle uniform, but no American emblem is ever shown anywhere.  The flag is never shown.  And I wondered, although the dragon is not the national symbol of China, and is not shown on the Chinese flag, it is the universally recognized symbol of the Chinese culture.  Can that be intentional?  Are the producers of this show attempting a little subliminal propaganda here?  Is somebody trying to forge an imaginary link between China's participation in the Nigerian Oil industry (and some say their exploitation of Nigeria) and tentative rumors of dread out of Washington about Chinan's global intentions?  Hard to tell.  Easier to imagine the original art on the plane to have been the Stars 'n Stripes, fluttering, until -- who knows? -- after a screening, somebody high up in the Money end of the biz sent a memo suggested that it wouldn't be a good idea to suggest that possibly the USA once used its Military to attack a small nation for its mineral wealth.  And that might suggest Iraq to some and Arbusto.  Or Viet Nam to others.  Or the forced Regieme Change in Iran in '52, or Haiti twice in one century, or even, God!  The war to bring Christianity to the Phillipines.  (Never mind they were already Catholic.)  The Korean War?  Or the Hawaiian takeover and annexation?  Or it might just put people in mind of the fact that most of the wars of the 20th century have pitted the USA against one after another of populations of brownish people all over this world, never mind our own indiginous population, we call Indians.  Maybe by portraying Pandora's ""Natives"" as 9 foot blue-striped leopard people with yellow eyes, the intention is to soften or diffuse that recollection.  But that's Pandora's Elixir.  An expensive 3D illusion, doubtless, though no Gilliad's balm.  Like cheap, artificually flavored and brightly colored gin, it deadens as it insults the mind.",1261440000,3,13867,4.851851851851852
3934272,5,B002HEXVUI,"I almost didn't go to see this movie this past Saturday due to predictions of a bad snow storm here in the Northeast, however the tickets were already paid for via online with no refund and were $16 a piece so I decided if I didn't see it now I probably would not buy another ticket at that price and would have to wait for a DVD release. All I can say is thank goodness the snow didn't come until a couple of hours after the movie was over and I did go see it, I have nothing but praise for this movie and would find it really hard to point out any real flaws to this movie.

  I'll give you the premise without giving away any spoilers of the story. The movie takes place in the future, the year 2154 and on the Planet Padora, actually Pandora may be a moon and not a planet but regardless it looks like it could be a jungle here on Earth, also the air in unbreathable by Humans and they must wear masks when outside. Humans have come to Pandora to mine a precious mineral called Unobtanium (do not ask me how you say it) anyway this stuff is worth a fortune, and the largest vein of it is located right below a village of one of the native species known as the Na'vi. The Na'vi are about 9ft tall with tails, blue skin, and bones reinforced with carbon fiber, although they appear primitive compared to the humans they are putting up a good fight to protect there land.

  The movie foucses on former Marine Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) who is paralyzed from the wiast down after a battle that took place on Earth, although they do have procedures to cure this it costs lots of money and the military does not cover the costs. When the movie begins Jake is on his way to pay his last respects to his twin brother Thomas who was a scientist working on the Avatar program on Pandora and was murdered. The Avatar program is where they created human-Na'vi hybrids these clones were mentally linked to the DNA of the there hosts and after Thomas is killed Jake gets invited to take his place as they are twins and share the same DNA allowing him to link up with Thomas's Avatar which cost a small fortune to make. The purpose of these Avatars is to find diplomatic ways to negotiate with the Na'vi, however this has not been working and a military composed of ex-Marines and mercenaries is about to do things the hard way. Through a series of events during the early parts of the movie Jake ends up in the Na'vi village in his Avatar body and is given three months by his superiors to get them to leave peacefully, and at the same time to expose the weak spots of there hide out.

  Okay the story is not really anything new, as far as movies I have seen It's like The Last Samurai but with Aliens and on another planet instead of Japan. However that doesn't mean the story is bad, I loved the whole thing from start to finish, this had to be the quickest two and half hours I have spent at a movie, I did not want it to end. I saw it in IMAX and in 3-D which looked beautiful for the most part, but I'm glad to say it is not needed and this movie will hold out on it's own without the 3D, which means I will definately be picking this up when it comes out on Bluray down the road. There is plenty of action to keep you adrenaline junkies happy, and there are also some tender moments as well. This movie was well worth the $16 admission I paid and coming from someone as cheap as I am that's high praise, I liked it so much that if my girlfriend and her kids want to see it I would gladly go see it again.",1261440000,2,3503,4.147275405007364

3934275,4,B002HEXVUI,"It's best not to compare the original theatrical release of Avatar in 3-D to an ordinary movie.  It's more like one of those rides at an amusement park, where you put on 3-D glasses and sit in a moving chair, or like an Imax event, where what you really want is not so much a story but an experience, to see something new, something you've never seen before.  Most of those films do not really have brilliant stories behind them, and the narration in Imax films is usually pretty preachy, but what you get from them is a few moments of immersion, an exciting new experience.

So when I saw it from the dvd I was disappointed. My wife, who missed it in theaters, couldn't see what all the fuss was about.

The basic plot line of this one is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dances-with-Wolves/dp/B00000F187/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dances with Wolves</a>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pocahontas/dp/B0007KTBIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pocahontas</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Samurai/dp/B0001JXOVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Samurai</a>) in space, but each of those was, in its own way, a pretty powerful movie, in spite of everything that might be said about the bluntness of its message.  Avatar combines the emotional impact and message of those films - of a vibrant culture and way of life on the brink of destruction by armies with big guns, and of a lone person who discovers how terrible that loss will be - and combines that message with the astonishing richness of a whole new world, with alien characters who come vividly to life and breath with realistic performances, and with incredible visuals that never quite overwhelm the characters.

Jake Sully is a paraplegic and former military special forces soldier, who is invited to take the place of his deceased twin brother on a mission to make contact on an alien planet.  The planet is Pandora, and it is inhospitable to human life, so to really get close a select few are linked to genetically engineered hybrid human-alien ""avatars"" that they control with their minds while their bodies lie dormant.  Best of all, linking with his brother's avatar gives Jake the experience of being whole again, of running and moving in ways he couldn't even have managed with his human body before the unmentioned crippling incident.  He ends up befriending the Na'avi natives, and (somehow) ends up being initiated into their tribal wisdom in the course of a few months (perhaps implausible, but it works in the story).  The only problem is, that was the deadline he faced for convincing the natives to leave their lands and make way for a major mining operation beneath their sacred tree.  Initially gung-ho for the mission, Jake begins to identify with the Na'avi, leaving him with the important question where his loyalties lie when the military-industrial mining corporation decides to give up on diplomacy and use force.

Okay, so this is a James Cameron film, which means it wears its message on its sleeve, which means it will feature over the top and one-dimensional villains and gruff but lovable heroes, but which also means that it will show you something you've never quite seen before in film.  For those who go into this looking to poke holes in the script, there are holes to be found - as a story this is not quite on the level of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-Trilogy/dp/B000GTLR2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</a>&nbsp;trilogy.  Still it's quite clever and complex in its own way, and in spite of the novelty of its look, this is classic Hollywood style epic storytelling, with a central character whose personal quest comes to coincide with a cause much larger than him, with a romantic subplot whose successful outcome is tied to the fate of the world.  You can poke holes in most of the major classic Hollywood films too, if that's what rocks your boat, but if you are in the mood for a truly moving and immersive motion picture experience, best to let go of the inner critic and prepare to be overwhelmed and astonished.  I was enchanted, and couldn't take my eyes off of the screen, and didn't want it to be over when it was.  This is epic filmmaking, that has to be seen to be believed, and I strongly recommend that you see it in 3-d in theaters.  This is the first ""live action"" film where I've seen 3-d that didn't feel like a gimmick - but was completely in the service of creating an immersive theatrical experience.

It is a movie we have already planned on seeing again, this time at an imax theater...tickets were sold out so we settled for just 3d.  The audience was so spell bound no one left their seat or talked during the film, and everyone applauded at the end.  I haven't been in a theater that quiet for 20 years.

3934277,1,B002HEXVUI,"Take everything wrong with American culture in the last millennium (racism, sexism, Manifest Destiny, Imperialism, exploitation of the earth, etc.) and toss them all together in a cinematic soup and overlay that with a weak sci-fi plot; and with even less forethought, and what falls out is a horrible and expensive movie like ""Avatar."" It is a ""Cowboys and Indians"" movie to embarrass all ""B-rated"" ""Cowboys and Indians"" movies.

And as always, its context is transparent chest-beating (chomping at the bit to go to war) ""white male heroism."" That Sigourney Weaver shares the lead in this now familiar trope, as the white female surrogate version of the white male hero, does not lessen the impact of its sexist and racist subtext in the least.  And of course, the antagonists are a thinly disguised cross between Native Americans and Watutsis, whose only difference is that they have tails (yes, that's right tails); their skin color is a funereal parlor purple and they are flat-nosed, cat-eyed and at least ten feet tall. Otherwise they are clones of 17th Century American Indians: with war dances, war paint and all.

To go with this image, in 3-D no less, we have as a plot line: a supposedly advanced American society seeking to exploit minerals and to otherwise colonize a stone-age society in outer space somewhere. The Americans, as they somehow always are in these kind of movies, are an uptight, tightly wound bunch led by straitlaced militarists who have no values beyond their imperialist intentions and their love for playing pocket pool with their military hardware.

Then comes the other familiar trope: the morality play. And I admit that within the rigid confines of a racist and imperialist paradigm, it does require some fancy footwork if not a bit of imagination -- however tortured it may be -- to come up with the idea that the white heroes get to live in both societies at the same time. That way, they get to play white morality against itself, (I guess to forgo the necessity of having to introduce a possibly superior alien morality directly into the plot).

As always the whites are divided into the ""good ones:"" the tree-hugging, environmentally conscious liberals; and the evil warmongering racists ones, without a conscious at all. To complete this ""closed incestuous moral circle"" of ""white only  on white only moral inhumanity,"" the Space Indians become little more than a sexual prop to donate their chief's princess as the ""white male hero's lover,"" and then after that solitary deed is done, just as in history, they then become fodder for white superiority as demonstrated by advance weaponry and the unsparing Saddam Hussein like brutality (They even use CW against the space Indian's bows and arrows?).

Oh, did I mention that the two-or three ""good whites"" all began the movie as ""bad ones too,"" but during the course of all the 3-D mayhem, they become guilty and are then somehow touched by ""real (non-white Indian) humanity. And as a result, they undergo a moral transformation and flip, the same as Kevin Costner did in ""Dancing with Wolves.""

The rest of the movie is so predictable (and meaningless) that it is not even worth mentioning. The most memorable thing about the movie will not be that it was in 3-D, or that space level modern tech weaponry went up against bow and arrow war-fighting, or that it was an intramural morality play, but the colossal lack of imagination that went into this production. And the way the plot hewed so closely to the well worn white supremacist/Manifest Destiny/American Imperialist narrative. Either we have not grown up much as a society or the moviemakers simply do not trust us, or our kids, to have a brain.  Save your money.

The CGI was really expertly done.  We wouldn't have been able to have this kind of movie experience in the 1970's or 80's.  I thought that the ability of the Na'vi to be able to link up with the flora and fauna of the planet and interact with it using a direct mind link was a nice touch.  Some said this story was predictable, but I was not entirely sure where it was going to go next.  Rather than spoiling some main plot points, a few of which were really good ideas, I will leave it at that.

All in all, this movie is a success.  It keeps a certain level of tension throughout, where you begin to fall in love with the protagonists, and you develop a fear of them failing and/or dying.  If you are a fan of sci-fi and fantasy movies, definitely give this movie a chance.  You might find it's one for the collection.",1261353600,2,1034,4.2615384615384615

3934280,4,B002HEXVUI,"""Avatar"" is an experience you do not want to miss in the theaters if you are a fan of fantasy and love intense, gorgeous imagery. Director and writer James Cameron clearly spared no expense creating images that will stick with you.

Jake Sullivan ""Sully"" (Sam Worthington) is a recently injured Marine who's also lost his scientist twin brother.  When he gets the opportunity to take his brother's place in the Avatar experiments, he accepts the scientists proposition to take over the alient avatar being grown specially for his twin.  He also accepts the charge of Colonel Miles Quantich (Stephen Lang) to infiltrate the Na'Vi people and find out how best to get them to move away from a rich deposit of newly discovered mineral ironically named ""unobtainium"" which an American corporation wants.  An accident brings Jake into the thick of Na'Vi society, where he is charged to learn their ways and given the chief's daughter, Naytiri (Zoe Saldana) to help him do so.

Jake has three months to pass the Na'Vi ritual and learn their ways--or the bulldozers come to destroy the Tree of Souls where the richest deposits of the unobtainium are to be found.

CGI:  You are literally on Pandora with the strongest longing to join the Na'Vi and commute with the magnificent Tree of Souls.

PLOT:  ""Avatar"" has been likened to ""Dances with Wolves"" in Space, ""Manifest Destiny"" by Barry Longyear and many others. The plot is stereotypical, which in some ways, is a good idea because I am not sure most people's brains could hold both the scenery and the story at the same time.

WARNING:  People with vertigo should use caution watching this film.  You are going to be flying on a dragon's back in 3D and the effects are very realistic.

If you hadn't already guessed, ""Avatar"" may be one of the top merchandised film of the year.  Already, you can see games, action figures, guides, and coffee table art books just to name a few of the selections.

But unfortunately, as a result, the whole film comes off as an extremely hi-tech, brilliantly conceived, lavishly produced --- cartoon.  The few gritty (and thus realistic) scenes inside the ship, where we can see real people, are a welcome relief from the mind-numbing (and, as a result, patently artificial) jungle/planet scenes that pervade this film.  I found it hard to empathize with the Na'vi and their plight (despite the frequent pathetic squeals of outrage and sorrow vocalized by many of them), because I felt like I'd be weeping tears for Simba or Nala in The Lion King -- they were digitized fantasy-creatures, not a real race of people, with real feelings and real lives.  I believe that the whole thing would have come across tremendously more effectively had they employed real actors (in blue costumes and makeup, if you like), instead of CG-created fantasy-people.

3934283,5,B002HEXVUI,"I am not going to insist on the technical prowess and creativity of this film. The special effects, both visual and sound, are superb, sublime, perfect, the merger of Star Wars and Matrix, of all the best means ever devised to make our eyes and ears believe the unbelievable. James Cameron is a god of sorts in that field and he used the most advanced studios to produce a divine and magical fairy tale. Anyone who pretends to love the cinema cannot and must not ever be reluctant in the slightest way to go and watch that film, two or three times if possible. And James Cameron is just as good when he deals with the surreal and supernatural of this extra-terrestrial civilization and when he exposes the brutality and human underdevelopment with no hope to ever be emerging from their dumbness of both military higher-ups and greedy industrialists. To list and explain all the allusions to all the films you can and will recognize would need two hundred pages. So I will pass and trust your own knowledge to enjoy the many allusions. I want to insist on the central message of the film, both ideological and cultural. Americans arriving on this planet finds a humanoid species, both intelligent and developed, but in a direction that has kept and exploited the direct relation that every individual can entertain with the beasts of nature and the telluric or subterranean forces of nature seen as the mother of the equilibrium without which nothing can survive. The only aim of the Americans is to recuperate some ore that is in great quantities under the main home-tree of this species, under all the sacred places and natural temples of this civilization, and to use brutal force if necessary to clear the area.  Greed and death instinct are the two teats on which all these Americans have been fed. Genetic science makes it possible to invest the personality of a human into the genetically modified cloned body of a local humanoid, producing a spy who is to get into this community and bring back the information necessary for the military genocide while his human body is kept in some hibernating pod. The problem with that project is that the happy few who can thus get into that community fall in love with their civilization, their culture, their deep human feelings and their absolute cult of prowess, courage and intelligence invested in the full respect of mother nature. Eventually for one of them that love will mean falling in love with the daughter of the political (father) and religious (mother) leaders of the tribe. James Cameron is a genius in the way he depicts the strong human emotions on the American side, both negative and positive and this depicting is immediately effective on us who are well trained in reading, receiving and experiencing these emotions. We feel the full horror James Cameron wants us to feel in front of the ugly conquistador colonel and the admirable courage of this female marine who prefers betraying her camp to being part of a planned genocide. James Cameron tries hard to depict in the same way the extra-terrestrial feeling and emotions of these humanoids, both real and cloned, but there we feel them less because they are different and we are not in phase with them, especially since the special effects are making us slightly blind. But it remains absolutely sublime. The meaning here is that of the meeting of two human species and their divided objectives on both sides. It is the merging of the two species in order to produce collaboration, cooperation, exchange and even total gift of culture, technological power, natural knowledge, spiritual representations, and all other common or different domains. In other words we are dealing with the fascination of the other. Some call that inverted racism or mixing cultures, salad bowl or melting pot, integration or assimilation. But James Cameron shows us how that approach is dangerous and fatal for the weaker species who will always be the victim of the stronger species, understood as being the Americans who have  no word of honor when greed is in play. At the same time if we do not respect the other in its total personality, religion and religious beliefs included, we will only produce a genocide, be it at least a cultural genocide teaching English and imposing our culture, and negating the natural evolution of the differentiation of languages, the punishment of the tower of Babel in our religious lore. James Cameron is telling us a parable more than a fable, and he is in perfect line with the deepest Judeo-Christian tradition of ours, of the Christ who was rabbi Jesus before being crucified. That deepest belief of ours is called love: to love the other in his or her difference and to give to that other all we have and share it with him or her, expecting the same attitude on the other side but at the same time refusing violence in the other case and loving our ""enemies"" as much as our ""friends"". In other words, and to cut short a long story, this film is the First Gospel after Barack Hussein Obama's election, even if that new spiritual approach of the world did not produce a miracle in Copenhagen. The Second Gospel of this Obama era will be the announced film by Steven Spielberg on the last novel by Stephen King, Under the Dome. After Saint James, the first Bishop of Jerusalem and the elder brother of Jesus in the end stoned to death at the foot of the wall of Jerusalem, we will have Saint Stephen, the Protomartyr of Christianity, stoned to death on the encouragement of Saul of Tarsus, the future Paul.

3934284,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar certainly could have been a disaster, a technological husk with no soul. Worse, the reliance on CG characters could have landed it smack dab in the uncanny valley...the realm where special effects wizards attempt to match reality but reap unsettling and awkward results. Beyond all reasonable expectations, however, Avatar must be considered a smashing success.

It's easy to see why 3D has been pushed in lock step with Avatar; the film melds CG and reality to create breathtaking scenes and believable characters. The eye candy on offer simply hasn't been paralleled this year. But Avatar's most significant technological feat lies in its ability to confuse the viewer. Halfway through, I had entirely lost track of what was and wasn't CG. The main characters, though some of them were alien, appeared to be fully-fleshed entities, and the world surrounding them was simultaneously impossible and yet flawlessly presented before my eyes.

Beautiful scenery and high octane action can only carry a film so far, but Cameron's screenplay, though not without a few warts, succeeds in inviting viewers to a new world and lulls them into caring for its characters. The barebones story isn't particularly complicated, and many of the plot points are telegraphed well in advance. The focus here is on a simple story told well. Cameron takes his time introducing his world and slowly unraveling its mechanics. The 162 minutes are judiciously apportioned such that the pacing avoids the twin pitfalls of skipping proper character development and drowning in excess exposition. Some of the characters are necessarily flat, and a handful of one-liners fall a bit short, but most of the writing implies a sure hand at work.

Of course, Cameron writes with a message, and the elegance of his delivery comes very close to perfection. Science fiction and fantasy often deliver morally or politically charged messages via metaphor, and Avatar can be viewed as one epic metaphor. Said metaphors risk crossing the line from art to rhetoric when they try to attach explicit anchors to the real world, and Cameron's script commits this error in two unrelated lines. Still, considering the length of the film and the otherwise effective development of the metaphor, this is a decent record.

On top of these aspects of the film are more conventional concerns such as acting. Sam Worthington, Segourney Weaver, and a host of other notables fill their roles with polish, but again, the true acting miracle in Avatar revolves around the CG characters. Never will a glitch remind the viewer that they aren't watching humans. The wizards behind Avatar have managed to simulate the full breadth of human expression and movement; the execution is flawless.

Combined with another rousing score from James Horner, Avatar's superlative special effects, measured pacing, and likeable characters form an unlikely synergy. By the film's climax, my heart was in my throat every time the life of a character was threatened. Sitting through the credits, I realized that Cameron's enormous gamble had paid off. Avatar is a cinematic tour-de-force and fully deserves the accolades it will surely garner at upcoming awards shows.",1261353600,5,3198,5.201941747572816

The stage is set for a cataclysmic clash of cultures.

Writer / director James Cameron has delivered big time with his first fiction film in ten years, which breaks new ground technically while telling a compelling and moving story.  No one injects human drama into special effects extravaganzas more effectively than Cameron.  Here, he indulges a fetish for technology that would shame Tom Clancy and juxtaposes it with a fascinating alien ecology and a noble race of arboreal aborigines.  Thankfully, he avoids heavy-handed messages with a tight focus on character, some incredible action sequences, and absolutely jaw-dropping visuals.

3934287,5,B002HEXVUI,The bar has been set at an all time high with this film.  Absolutely astonishing experience. Cameron may come across as somewhat of a big head....but the man sure knows how to make a movie.,1261267200,,189,4.4
3934288,1,B002HEXVUI,"If this was the movie James Cameron has wanted to do since he was a teen, then maybe he should have taken better notes, or should have taken a very sharp editor's eye to his script.

Because while this film is indeed pretty and a spellbinding achievement in the most stunningly realistic CG of any movie today, the plot is almost insulting in how stale, cliche'd, and just plain boring, ordinary, and generic it is.  There's no surprises to be had; you know exactly who's going to win and who's going to lose, you know exactly how different action (not just fight) sequences will turn out, you know exactly what characters will live and which will die, which ones will have an abrupt Heel-Face turn, and which ones will turn out to be good all along.

I can't really tell just why such a film like this comes out so cheesey and cliche' in terms of its plot, whereas a film like Star Wars, in its trilogy, contains a great many classical and common elements of folk tale and mythology and literature, and yet manages to be a stellar and timeless story.

This story in ""Avatar"" is anything but.  The only thing that will be memorable of this movie is its visual effects.

Right from the start, the film does wonders with visual effects, showing us a highly realistic-looking sleeper ship, and a zero-g environment on board, that neither looks overly cartoony or overly CG'd.  It looks perfectly real all around.

Every effect just screams ""real real real!"", from the computer monitors and holographic displays, to the plants and vegetation and variety of animals.  Cameron does not overindulge us by making us look at everything in detail, showing off, but neither does he rush through intricate details in an attempt to stay grounded to the script.  It's a perfect mix of showing us nifty new creatures and inventions without stalling long enough to make us think he's showing off.

The Na'vi start off looking quite real, but very blatantly CG.  There's a very slight sense of artificiality in the Avatars when they are first on screen, and shown awakening and interacting with humans.  But as the movie progresses, the effects seem to get better and better, to a point where towards the end, when Na'vi and Humans interact closely, both of them look incredibly REAL, as though the Na'vi were a huge puppet creation, and yet it's entirely CG.

Where they went all-out with the visuals, they completely lost it with the story.  It becomes less ""Avatar"" and more ""Dances With Wolves In Space"" or virtually any Generic Action/Adventure Film In Space.  The parallels with Dances With Wolves are the most powerful, likely due to the commonplace aspect of it.

But the story doesn't treat this as some sort of surprise.  Nor does it even try to be distinct in some way.  You know exactly how characters are going to react to situations.  You know exactly what's going to happen next.  You know that the Generic Nerd Sidekick appears jealous and resentful of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) now, but you know later on he's going to become the HERO who tries to save him.  You know that Sully is going to be initially hated by Action Girl Love Interest (Zoe Saldana), but eventually get her to love him, You know that Bad Ass Action Girl (Michelle Rodriguez) is going to betray the humans and side with Sully and the Na'vi.  You know that certain characters are going to die.  You know that Sully will earn the trust and respect of the tribe.  You know that Sully is going to admit he's been spying on the Na'vi, and cause Action Girl Love Interest to cry and scream and hate him and tell him to go away, You know this and that and everything.

It's all so obvious that it becomes stupefyingly boring, and you wouldn't have ever noticed that fact if the movie weren't so much fun to look at.

But while the effects and even much of the story was interesting enough to keep me drawn in, the most spectacular visual effect focus was on the Na'vi themselves...  and the Na'vi themselves, as a society, were a breakneck yank out of immersion, and into a silly and childish realization:

""They are exact alien copies of Native Americans!""

They are exact copies, from the mohawks, to the way the Elder Father and Mother characters look and dress and sound, to the high pitched yipping sound they give in battle, they are EXACT COPIES of Native Americans.

It would seem to me that this element was lazily left in from the ripping off of the plot of ""Dances With Wolves"", and that would probably be a great discussion point, but like a great many modern ""PC"" portrayals of Native Americans, they sugarcoat them so much, they become just as racist as the Savage Red Man (Blue Man?) portrayed in older stories.

These Na'vi Americans are so in touch with their environment, they can talk to animals by sticking tentacles in their hair into plugs coming out of the animals' heads.

They can wrap these tentacles around long tendrils from the ""Tree of Souls"" to pray directly to their God.  They have to cry and chant a ritual chant every time they kill an animal.  They use bow and arrows, ride on animals, and make yipping sounds like the Natives in old ""cowboy and indian"" movies and storypieces.

It wouldn't be so bad, and it never really ventures into a racist depiction (especially since most of all these are ALIENS and not Native Americans), but the parallels are too strong to ignore---this is not even a metaphor or parody or Horatian satire, these Na'vi are nearly word-for-word copies of stereotypical Native Americans, with a little bit from everywhere, such as the Caribbean-sounding Elder Mother, to the ""Great Chief Man Sitting Bull"" sounding Elder Father, to the Warrior Son with the mohawk and pithy attitude to Sully.

But since these AREN'T Native Americans and they ARE aliens, James Cameron can get away with essentially portraying them as the stereotype of the ""in perfect harmony and touch with mother nature"" good guys, whereas the Humans, with the exception of only the obvious ones and the Nerdy Pacifist Scientists, are all evil, greedy, corporate-thinking scum who can't do anything with a planet except rape it and kill it slowly for resources, as though environmentalism efforts today would never ever work out or catch on.  THANKS FOR THE FAITH, CAMERON!

While the story is essentially glossed over with a spiffy coat of paint to seem new-ish, there's no real need to worry about spoilers---there's nothing here we haven't seen before, and nothing here that wasn't told better and more realistically in other movies and stories.

It's a stereotypical ""White Men vs Indians"" tale of the 90s, with the evil Humans being thwarted by the holy Na'vi.

And yet we get the Unfortunate Implication that the Na'vi apparently could not have survived or banded together without the leadership of Jake Sully, White Man Sky Person.

THANKS FOR THE SUBTLE RACISM, JAMES CAMERON!",1261267200,46,6877,4.725293132328308
3934289,3,B002HEXVUI,"Spoilers:

This film is fool's gold. It makes you want to pick it up. It makes you think you have something beautiful and great but it's substance is nothing more than iron pyrite. It's worth seeing for nothing more than the fantastic visuals. It's also Dances With Wolves but not as good.

As I watched Avatar all I wanted to see and experience was Pandora. That was the only part of the film that mattered to me. When Jake Sully was wandering around there the film was a home run. Other than that I cared little for the contrived plot about why the humans were there and how they had to destroy in order to get some sort of fools gold. That humanity would destroy a fantastically huge tree and a native alien culture in our distant future seems an unlikely thing for us to do, especially given the current ecological and humanitarian direction that we seem to be steering ourselves, and our consciences in.

The story of the unthinking marines and the corporations looking for `gold' just flat out sucked. I could have done without all of it. Any message the film cared to impart was unnecessary and seemed like preaching to the choir. Also, the mindset of the marines and corporation seemed so one dimensional. I could not buy their uncaring nature for a second and all those characters seemed like cardboard placeholders.

I am also amazed at how anti-war messages always seem to be conveyed in films these days by depicting a fantastically exciting battle that is so much fun to watch. Cameron loves war. I can tell by watching his films. He loves to design specific types of hovering death machines that are in Terminator, Aliens, and now Avatar. I'm not sold that he is sincere with his message for peace given that his films are always so violent. Is showing and depicting violence the only path to peace? I feel Cameron, rather than just showing us great battles, which I feel is his true nature, has, due to his success and financial gain over the years, placed a phony moral faade over his films so as to come across as politically correct.

The moral core of the film did not seem sincere and I am not even sure what message if any was trying to be conveyed. My son and I walked into the theater already knowing that wanton destruction is bad, hitting is bad, and violence against others is bad. We did not need to see and be lectured that humans have the capacity to be bad. We know that already. Could not the film have been told in a more peaceful way? Couldn't humanity have been depicted as having matured hundreds of years in our future? The same story could have been told about a man in an Avatar body becoming one of the residents on Pandora without all the bloodshed. The film did not need all the destruction. Cameron likes destruction though. Cameron is that awful part of humanity that likes to see what happens when the anthill is stepped on or a wasp's nest set a flame. His true nature shows through with this film. He burnt his own creation. He destroyed Pandora and it's people and after seeing the film and reflecting on it I feel it was unnecessary. This is a man who wishes he were there to see the Titanic sink so he made a film with a flimsy story so he could show it. Avatar is no different.",1261267200,4,3227,4.45346869712352
3934290,3,B002HEXVUI,"AVATAR has changed everything, has pushed the envelope, will be the landmark in film that changes the way movie are made, just like STAR WARS did when it was created. Yet, in a boring year for movies it was propped up higher than it probably deserved.

You make think that I'm off base here, but this review comes from a huge fan of James Cameron, The Abyss, Aliens etc. Yet, in a few years, after more directors and more movies are made with the technologies that James Cameron has pushed here, AVATAR will lose its luster.

Notice the one category that AVATAR was not nominated for at the Oscars. SCREENPLAY. When Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) explains why the humans are on Pandora it was so blunt and quickly explained, I thought, that was really bad, but I figured it was gonna be a rare occurence. Then Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) starts telling Jake Sully (Jake Worthington) what he needs him for and you can't imagine how the alarms wouldn't have been going off in Jake Sully's head at how one-dimensional despicable this character was. He tells him that if he succeeds at stabbing the inhabitants of Pandora in the back, he'll get his legs back. Jake Sully's in a wheelchair.

James Cameron is one of, if not my favorite director, because unlike Michael Bay and Rolland Emmerich, he knows that every action movie has to have a heart, and he's right. He knows that among all the flash and circumstance, you must slow down and make the audience CARE and he does it better than anyone.

Yet, I thought Cameron was above using his films to make political messages. The Marines call the Na'vi terrorists. The attack on the Na'vi is referred to as 'shock and awe'. The unnecessary and unexplainable comparisons of the Na'vi to the terrorists that we fight today who behead journalists, blow up unarmed citizens and hate jews and christians for just being jews and christians, is detestable and boarders on treasonous.

While the Marines and the company behind the human invasion are so horribly one-dimensional, and the plotline is sadly predictable and been done a thousand times, the STORY is like something you have never imagined. The story is far from typical because the story is the people. The story is the characters. The story is Neytiri, played by Zoe Saldana, and the beautiful culture of the Na'vi. The story is how a crippled Marine went from a man on a mission, to a man reborn.

The truth is though, I hadn't been sucked into movie like AVATAR in a long time. I was there on Pandora. I could feel the trees and the lights and the environment. It succeeded brilliantly at taking me away from my life and taking me somewhere, and that is the brilliance of movies.

The production of AVATAR and its credible colors, environments and seamless transformations between what is real and what isn't is what will take this to its rightful place. It's a brilliant film and I will see it many many many times again. Yet, its screenplay will, in a few years, make it just another movie, after better movies are WRITTEN and produced with similar technology.

3934292,5,B002HEXVUI,"Wow, ""Avatar"" is a beautiful movie, the trailers, viewed in 2D, don't begin to do justice to the depth of artistry and imagination devoted to the creation of the world of Pandora.  The flying rock mountains, the fluorescent plantlife and animals, the soaring flying scenes are all just fantastic.  And of course, coming from the creator of the first two ""Terminator"" movies, the action scenes are first rate and terrifying.

The storyline is a very recognizable one that is often repeated in American cinema.  The story is basically a combination of ""Pocahontas"", ""Dances With Wolves"",  ""Fern Gully: The Last Rainforest"", ""Dune"", ""Tarzan"", and lots of other similar tales of a young man's journey into heroism,  rising from nothing to become a powerful leader/defender of another people, another world.  And along this journey, the young man meets the female who will be his devoted mate for life.  The story has echoes of Joseph Campbell and ""The Power of Myth"",  with the added post-modern, post-Title IX twist of the female saving the life of our hero at the end.

The fact that this story resonates so deeply in American culture is simply a reflection of its importance in early American history, as this was not a myth based on white guilt, but a true story and common occurrence.  In the early days of contact between white settlers and Indians, many young white men did in fact choose to run away from their repressive European cultures to the free and open Indian societies,  often taking an Indian woman as a wife.  Sam Houston, a hero of Texas, was but one such example of a young man who ran away to live with the Indians, taking an Indian wife along the way;  Houston did go on to lead not the Indians, but the Texans, to freedom.

And as pointed out in the book ""1491"", it was this interaction between white settlers and the Indian tribes that fundamentally shaped the character of early Americans, transforming the rigid and hidebound hierarchies of their European origins into the egalitarian and libertarian ideals of Indian culture.

Supposedly, James Cameron took four years to make this movie.  It shows in the facial features of Sam Worthington who was only 31 when he was first cast and looks noticeably younger and more baby-faced in some of the scenes compared to others.

I kept thinking back to when the last time was that I had seen such lush and powerfully creative fantasy images - so much of the background scenery from this movie could stand on their own as superb fantasy artwork, suitable for framing.  It has been a really long time - not since the fantastic artwork of Frazetta and others in the 1970's have I seen such beautiful fantasy artwork.  And so in the end, it was not the much-hyped CGI that drew me into this movie, it was the all-encompassing, outstanding fantasy artwork which made the world of Pandora come alive.

The movie is certainly one of Cameron's best efforts yet (supplanting ""Aliens""), and worthy of repeat viewing in the theaters... now if I can just get those darned 3-D glasses to fit...

Addendum:

Well, I managed to see this movie three times now, all in 3D, the first time in Dolby 3D, the second in IMAX 3D, and the third time in Real 3D.

The IMAX 3D was actually the worst experience for me - because of the ancient linear polarization technology, the 3D effect was lost any time I tilted my head, and I would start to see double images onscreen.  As is often cited, the IMAX technology produced the greatest amount of 3D effect, but things tended to blur in the periphery of the image onscreen.  All of this gave me a headache after three hours of watching this movie.  Part of that may have been from the effort of having to keep my head straight and level for that period of time.

The Real 3D was probably the best experience for me - the large glasses fit easily in front of my own glasses, and I had no trouble watching the movie and getting a 3D effect.  It was the most comfortable experience, and the bright screen made the images stand out, making it look as good if not better than the IMAX images.

The Dolby 3D was only so-so.  The biggest problem was the small glasses.  It is often mentioned that the glasses are more expensive, perhaps that's why the lenses are so much smaller than the other two technologies.  I had trouble fusing the two images together into a 3D effect at times.  The picture was not quite as bright and sharp as the other two, as this technology is projected onto a regular movie screen.  But at least I could let my head loll around during the movie.

So if you get the chance, I would recommend going the Real 3D route.  There are websites that identify which theaters have which of the different technologies, which I will post into the comments section.",1261267200,2,4763,4.614014251781473
3934293,5,B002HEXVUI,"I saw this movie via Imax in 3D. I think this is one of the most fantastic movies ever! The story itself is engaging and well thought out. The special effects truly set a new standard against which other movies can be compared - completely amazing! Everything is so realistic it's real easy to just let yourself go and let your mind believe it's real.

I've read various articles stating that this movie cost around 350 million dollars to produce. So, it will need to take in at least that much just to break even. Everyone needs to go see this incredible achievement and support this effort. If not, it will be a long long time before anyone dares to do something like this again.

Go see it - it's one of the best movies ever!

I, for one, will not hesitate for even a second to get it once it becomes available on Blu-Ray :)",1261267200,2,827,4.288461538461538
3934294,5,B002HEXVUI,"Avatar is movie magic, pure and simple.

I'm honestly having trouble writing a proper review of Avatar, the memories of watching the movie and the feelings it brought about are so overwhelming, it is hard to properly jot down what I think of it. However the word magic is the one that constantly comes to mind. Avatar is without a doubt the definition of movie magic. During all the pre-release hype for Avatar, I recall a movie director, whose name I can't quite remember at the moment, described watching Avatar as dreaming with your eyes wide open. At the time I scoffed at the idea, I knew the movie would be a good time, I mean it is James Cameron after all, but that seemed a tad hyperbolic at the time. Well after seeing Avatar not once, but twice, I have to almost agree. Experiencing Avatar was almost like a dream. Witnessing the monumental landscapes of Pandora, the lifelike CG creations, it was all nothing short of awe inspiring. James Cameron created something that is almost 100% purely digital, yet with more of a resonating heartbeat than the countless of tired blockbusters that seem to come out every summer. Avatar feels real, the emotion feels real. Just remembering scenes from the movie evokes a strong emotional sense, that you wish you could go back to the movie as soon as possible.

Cameron combines his beautiful creations with pure classic Hollywood storytelling. No cynicism here, just pure sincerity. But what truly sets apart Avatar from the countless would be ""epic"" movies these days, is its heart, and its thematic underpinnings. Avatar is a story about seeing and understanding people as they really are. Accepting different cultures for what they are, no matter how they are different. This is the heart of the movie, and in my mind is what will make it timeless. It is a story that will seemingly forever be parallel to human society. It is a story Cameron wrote 15 years ago, but is as valid now as it was then, if not moreso.

I could go on and on about the many wonders of the movie, however I would be spoiling the experience...In the end, Avatar may perhaps be the most CGI heavy live action feature film ever, yet it is one with immense heart and soul. Avatar is a reminder of why we go to the movies.",1261267200,2,2246,4.596009975062344
3934295,5,B002HEXVUI,"Okay, we all know about ""the Circle of Life"" by now, right?  It's the idea that life is connected and sacred, and the idea has become a huge cliche that makes even the tree-huggers among us (of which I am one) groan by now.  We've all seen the ""Avatar"" premise in many previous movies; it's a story about how the native people of America/Japan/the jungle/etc are connected to the land and respect it, and the invaders that come in pursuit of material gain are Bad, Bad, Bad.

""Avatar"", however, embraced its sci-fi side to take the metaphor to a whole different level.  The native people of Pandora aren't just attuned to the land, they're literally connected it.  They can't just leave their home; it would be like you or I trying to scoop out part of our brain and function without it.  Thus, we the human invaders aren't just destroying a culture when we start burning Pandora to the ground to steal its resources, we're literally signing a death warrant for living creatures as intelligent and developed as ourselves.

With that bit of imagination, ""Avatar"" became both an allegory for colonization (like ""Dances With Wolves"", ""Fern Gully"", ""Last Samurai""), and also a tale of survival.  Our heroes are fighting not just for their beliefs, but for life itself against enemies who are unable or unwilling to spare them as long as there's profit to be made.  Thus, ""Avatar"" is both a classic story and a new one with a truly modern twist.

The rest has been said: the visuals are stunning, the acting is great, the story flows well and never gets dull despite its length.  ""Avatar"" isn't for everyone, being heavy-handed and light on characterization.  But as a visual spectacle, a sci-fi adventure tale, and an epic story of survival and love, ""Avatar"" is perfect.",1261267200,3,1767,4.738562091503268
3934296,5,B002HEXVUI,"In Greek mythology ""Pandora"" was a woman who was given the gifts of the gods, thus translated ""all gifts"" as well as given her ""box"" (actually a jar) which, when opened, released ills to all Man -- greed, avarice, lust, anger, etc.

James Cameron, after quite a hiatus after his number one best-selling film Titanic (still number one on the Hot 100 movies of all time) created a smooth world, actually a green moon orbiting a Jupiter-like gas giant planet.

Earth is in dire need of a mineral (Unobtainium, named for obvious reasons) that's worth millions on the market.  They invade this moon and have conflict with the native peoples, the Na'vi, very similar in scope and story to Native Americans, with a story and a spiritual connection to their planet Pandora as our Native Americans have with North America.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirits-of-the-Earth-A-Guide-to-Native-American-Nature-Symbols-Stories-and-Ceremonies/dp/0452276500/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirits of the Earth: A Guide to Native American Nature Symbols, Stories, and Ceremonies</a>

The similarities are striking, the story is as old as time, and the originality is there as well.  I think what strikes me as others are the technical marvel of creating a world that is so full of life as Earth, how Earth may have evolved on a different plane.  Flowers of fantastic colors, hyena-like dogs with several eyes, and communing with dragon-like animals (in nearly the same way as Anne McCaffery imagined in the novel Dragonriders of Pern)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dragonriders-of-Pern/dp/0345340248/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dragonriders of Pern</a>.

Jake [Sam Worthington, as  Marcus Wright in:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-Salvation-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B001FB55HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator Salvation (Widescreen Edition)</a>]is a Marine who is also without the use of his legs and is forced to use a wheelchair.  Cameron's sensitivity here is clear and I think anyone with a disability would feel grateful for how the character is portrayed.

The Avatar is actually a DNA construct between human and Na'vi, a body is grown (this is the 22nd century after all) and then you're plugged in and for all intents and purposes you run the new body.  For a man with no use in his legs, having a new body where you can run and play is intoxicating.

Animals:  The flora and fauna are amazing.  We can only imagine in a dream what crazy evolutionary accident made life become like on Pandora.  The Na'vi have a way of connecting their neural pathways through their ""braid"" from their heads.  Interestingly they can connect and communicate to the life on their planet.

Before you start going ""Oh, it's a Gaea worship myth!"" Sigourney Weaver (working again with Cameron after the awesome Aliens&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00012FXAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>) explains the biology and how connected they all are.  There is even a Tree of Life and a Tree of Knowledge -- the religious connections and Native American connections are very clear.

I mentioned the Dragonriders of Pern for a reason -- as the dragons hook up with their riders in the same way a cat will hook up with her kittens, so these dragon-like creatures hook up with their riders.

Jake is torn between his duty as a Marine and his honor and responsibility as a member of the tribe of Na'vi who call him ""dreamwalker"" because he is an alien, not of their people.

We've seen variations of this story before in history (invasion of the Europeans upon native peoples, invasion of Iraq for oil -- oops, never mind) and in impacting the environment -- Jake says ""they've killed Mother Earth and now they want to kill you!""

Breathtaking scenes of flight, violent rhinoceros-like animals that can crush steel, love, honor on one side -- the corporate greed and military mind of taking what you want and bulldoze the leftovers -- it's all here.  The amazing animation of the world, the peoples and space & planet scenes is seamless and realistic -- this film could be as big and as groundbreaking as King Kong was for its time, in terms of animation & special effects.

What I think will attract the viewer is not only the science fiction trappings but an old story of sticking up for what you believe in.

The moon Pandora had as the Greeks granted -- a gift of the gods&nbsp;.  But Man attempted to open Pandora's box and let loose a hell upon themselves.

But as in the myth, so too there is hope.  Hope that the planet will heal and grow.

Personally, I got the same shivers and goose bumps I got from watching Harryhausen's Jason and the Argonauts as the skeleton armies rose from the planted dragon's teeth!!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jason-and-the-Argonauts/dp/0767810864/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jason and the Argonauts</a>&nbsp;What a rush!

3934297,5,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron's Avatar is an amazing accomplishment.  He has taken animation and the action movie genre to a new level.  The plot is something of a ""Dances with Wolves,"" in space.  It's predictable at times, but not unrealistic.  Corporations are mowing down the Rain Forest and the U.S. government kicked out the Native Americans in real life.  This movie just dramatizes these historical themes from the perspective of the natives along with a visitor from the would-be conqueror's side who falls in love with the culture and with a beautiful girl, why not!  The movie is visually spectacular, astonishing really in how real this Real 3D technological makes this world seem.  The main characters are well cast and their performances are quite good, with Zoe Saldana stealing the show.  The action sequences are so fast that your eyes can't leave the screen, and I found the story tugging at my emotions just a little.  There are plenty of surprises to keep you guessing on the final outcome.  The movie runs nearly three hours, but I only glanced at my watch because I wondered how long I'd have to wait to use the rest room.  The James Horner score is competent, as his always are.  This is the movie to see this year, and it's the best reason to actually see a movie in a theater this decade.  Enjoy!",1261180800,,1304,4.666666666666667

  I was well satisfied with the graphics. This is a film that had to wait to be made. George Lucas did not have the depth of field and range available to even try to do something like this.
  So argue as much as you want, I liked this movie. I even went to it twice one day after the other. If you know how few theatre visits I make, then you would know what a compliment that is to the film.

3934300,5,B002HEXVUI,"""Avatar"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: AVATAR takes us to a spectacular world beyond imagination, where a reluctant hero embarks on an epic adventure, ultimately fighting to save the alien world he has learned to call home. James Cameron, the Oscar-winning director of ""Titanic,"" first conceived the film 15 years ago, when the means to realize his vision did not exist yet. Now, after four years of production, AVATAR, a live action film with a new generation of special effects, delivers a fully immersive cinematic experience of a new kind, where the revolutionary technology invented to make the film disappears into the emotion of the characters and the sweep of the story.

We enter the alien world through the eyes of Jake Sully, a former Marine confined to a wheelchair. But despite his broken body, Jake is still a warrior at heart. He is recruited to travel light years to the human outpost on Pandora, where corporations are mining a rare mineral that is the key to solving Earth's energy crisis. Because the atmosphere of Pandora is toxic, they have created the Avatar Program, in which human ""drivers"" have their consciousness linked to an avatar, a remotely-controlled biological body that can survive in the lethal air. These avatars are genetically engineered hybrids of human DNA mixed with DNA from the natives of Pandora... the Na'vi.

Reborn in his avatar form, Jake can walk again. He is given a mission to infiltrate the Na'vi, who have become a major obstacle to mining the precious ore. But a beautiful Na'vi female, Neytiri, saves Jake's life, and this changes everything. Jake is taken in by her clan, and learns to become one of them, which involves many tests and adventures. As Jake's relationship with his reluctant teacher Neytiri deepens, he learns to respect the Na'vi way and finally takes his place among them. Soon he will face the ultimate test as he leads them in an epic battle that will decide nothing less than the fate of an entire world.

The cast led by Sam Worthington (as Jake Sully) is excellent! The directing and story and screenplay by James Cameron (who also did the film editing and produced) (who also directed ""Titanic"" (1997, also produced, film edited, and wrote the story and screenplay), ""The Terminator"" (1984, also wrote the story & screenplay), ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" (1991, also produced and wrote the story and screenplay), ""The Abyss"" (1989, also wrote the story and screenplay), ""Aliens"" (1986, also wrote the story and screenplay) & ""True Lies"" (1994, also wrote the screenplay and produced) is excellent!

The music by James Horner (who also did the music to ""Aliens"" & ""Titanic"", he also did the music to ""Apocalypto"" (2006) is excellent! The cinematography by Mauro Fiore (who also did the cinematography to the upcoming ""The A-Team"" (2010) is excellent! The film editing by Cameron, John Refoua & Stephen E. Rivkin (who also did the film editing to all 3 Pirates Of The Caribbean movies (2003, 2006 & 2007) is excellent! The casting by Margery Simkin (who also did the casting to the upcoming ""Extraordinary Measures"" (2010) is excellent! The production design by Rick Carter (who also did the production design to certain Steven Spielberg's & Robert Zemeckis' films and the upcoming ""Sucker Punch"" (2011) & Robert Stromberg (who also did the production design to the upcoming ""Alice In Wonderland"" (2010), he has done visual effects work on ""2012"" (2009), ""The Road"" (2009), ""G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra"" (2009) & the upcoming ""Shutter Island"" (2010) is excellent! The art direction by Nick Bassett (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""XXX: The Return Of Xander Cage"" (2011), Robert Bavin, Simon Bright (who also did the art direction & set decoration to ""King Kong"" (2005), the art direction to ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King"" (2003), Todd Cherniawsky (supervising art director) (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""Alice In Wonderland"" & ""Sucker Punch""), Jill Cormack, Stefan Dechant (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""Alice In Wonderland""), Seth Engstrom, Sean Haworth (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""Thor"" (2011) & ""Tron Legacy"" (2010), Kevin Ishioka (supervising art director) (who also did the art direction to ""G.I.

This is an impressive and beautiful film, visually and emotionally. This is one of James Cameron's best films, if not best film, since ""Titanic"". This is also one of the best films of the year, so far.",1261180800,2,5288,4.937078651685393
3934301,5,B002HEXVUI,"Initially concieved in 1999 as Cameron's follow up to Titanic, Avatar was put on hold when Cameron realized the technology did not exist yet to support his vision. Over the course of the next decade, Cameron created much of the technology he needed to make this movie possible. In 2002, Cameron watched The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and through the character of Gollum realized that his vision was finally possible. Twelve years have passed since the release of James Cameron's Titanic, will his new film prove that Cameron is still ""King of the World""?

Much has been made of Cameron's Avatar long before it's release. Hailed as a revolution in 3D and CGI technology, Avatar holds a lot of expectations, not the least of which is the fact that the budget and marketing for this film add up to approximately half a billion dollars, making it the most expensive movie ever made. Of course, Cameron has been here before. Titanic cost $200 million to make, the largest budget for a feature film at the time, and just when it looked like it was going to goose that laid the rotten egg it proceeded to make $1.8 billion worldwide, making it the highest grossing film of all time. Cameron's also not new to the idea of revolutionizing the world of film with almost every movie he makes: with The Abyss he had the first all digital water effect, with Terminator 2 he had the first CGI character with realistic movement, and so on. Can lightning strike yet again?

I'm generally someone who's adverse to using all caps for anything, but: DO NOT WAIT TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!! Also don't wait for it to come to DVD or to a TV station near you. Why, you ask? Because this movie is a movie that has to be seen the way it was intended to truly get the fully immersive experience. I watched the trailers on TV and online, and none of that compared to seeing the film in theaters in 3D. With Avatar, Cameron has truly outdone himself. When District 9 came out, I raved about the CGI effects in that movie, but Avatar is a whole other monster. With Avatar you truly cannot tell where the CGI begins and reality ends and vice versa, and on top of that it is the most beautiful film I've ever seen, CGI or otherwise. On top of that, Cameron's new 3D cameras create an experience that is in no way uncomfortable. No headaches and no motion sickness for those of you who suffer from that sort of thing. Instead, you get a highly immersive experience that leaves you begging for more (which is saying something, considering the film's run time is 162 minutes) and wanting to return when you leave.

I've seen a lot of reviews lately that talk about the film having a weak script with too many cliches and one dimensional characters. What you really get, in my opinion though, is old school story telling with a message, even though the message is drowned out in special effects and action. The script moves quickly, there is no downtime, but you also never feel like the pacing is off, or that it's moving too fast. Cameron has built a complete world, we don't just see characters and action, but we see complete eco systems, and are introduced to many characters. While the entire cast is amazing, Sam Worthington as Jake Sully and Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch are the real standouts here. Sam Worthington creates a character that you feel for, and through his progress from pawn to leader is truly believable and heartfelt. Stephen Lang, on the other hand, gives us a character that starts off just trying to do his duty, but eventually becomes a character on par with Sergeant Barnes from Platoon or Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now.

I purposefully chose not to mention anything about the plot for this movie. I think this movie is going to be the revolution of movies that Cameron believes it's going to be. I've seen reviewers compare it to The Wizard of Oz (the movie to truly lead the color revolution) and King Kong (the 1933 version, which revolutionized special effects), and I wholeheartedly agree. I still can't completely fathom what I just saw, and will probably see it at least one more time on the big screen if not more. Anyone who's into film, the tech of film, or just wants to keep up with where film is going in the future should see this film. On top of that, this movie touches on so many different genres (SciFi, fantasy, romance, war films, drama, etc.) that it will appeal to almost everyone. Once again, James Cameron is ""King of the World""!

3934302,5,B002HEXVUI,"Whenever I've watched a movie with mates, it's not long for one of them to dismiss a situation within the story as unbelievable. My response is simply to ""suspend your disbelief & enjoy the story"". With Avator though, the unbelievable takes place before your very eyes and find yourself mesmerised & immersed in James Cameron's triumphant return to film (after the gayfest that was Titanic). Whereas The Hangover is my comedy of the year (and possibly the decade, although Role Models still rocks!)

Avatar (not AR-VAH-TARR as some pretentious cock-blocking morons will say) is simply a breathtaking, visual feast for the imagination, young or old. Forget recent, lame attempts of 3D that apparently awed me at the time (A Christmas Carol for instance) Avatar doesn't chuck things at you from the screen, it draws you in. Imagine if you will, being inside a Wii or Xbox console's virtual world in 1080p, get my drift? I'm sure by now that anyone who's not seen this film, will know its basic plot. Let's face it, JC isn't prepared to bore our pants off, although we could've done without that tree-hugging BS that crops up occassionally and cod bohemian crap. Luckily, Giovanni Ribisi's Parker Selfridge (I don't make-up these names!) acknowledges this with an hilarious obeservation, during the movie.

Avatar isn't without its flaws however, but Cameron more than makes up for it with A+ performances from a perfect cast and a couple of sweet touches to boot. What makes me laugh, is that when Terminator Salvation came out this year, a movie magazine had hailed Christian Bale as the saviour of franchise reboots. Don't get me wrong here, I like Bale; but to me, Sam Worthington was the more likable character of Marcus Wright (obviousy so much so, he's already wrapped up Clash Of The Titans, another reboot maybe?) And here, he turns it on again as Jake Sully, a crippled war veteran who doesn't give a hoot about his disability. I like Sam, as he's one of the lads, a real man (unlike me,a shameless metrosexual!) If he's not on every A-list director's call sheet by 2010, I'll shave my hair! (strike that, please!) It's his ability as well as a well-rounded cast, including Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver (in a great role) and Stephen Lang as an Apocalypse Now type Colonel, who has some of the coolest lines ever! Mustn't forget Michelle Rodriguez, who made me laugh out loud with a wisecrack about a firearm. What is the film's overall message you may ask? Personally I think it serves as being almost Anti-Republican (or American perhaps) in terms of what Stephen Lang and his crew's true motives are, but we'll save that debate for an old folks discussion.

They say Twilight's New Moon is the biggest opening film last month, grossing $72,000,000. Who cares? What that gay excuse for a vampire film has done in ruining a legend; Avatar will sweeten the bitter taste in your mouth once again. I've already booked my place for the IMAX on Jan 27th 2010 (the only booking where I could get 2 seats!)

3934304,4,B002HEXVUI,"It's not just been the most talked about movie of the year - it's been over a decade James Cameron has been building to this - so it would seem that Cameron has built expectation too high and that the movie could only disappoint.  And yet, while not a perfect movie, he certainly has pulled something special out of the bag - a real spectacle of a movie, something new, and finally - a film where the 3D is not a distraction (or worse, a headache).
For the record, I saw this in IMAX, so perhaps this helps the immersive nature of the 3D.  While it is still to my way of thinking a gimmick which does not truly add to the experience, it does have the virtue in this case of actually working, rather than distracting you.  Cameron seems to be the first to make a feature in 3D where there are certainly moments of things shooting out of the screen (Look, floating drops of liquid! Duck, the flamethrower is coming this way!), but always within the confines of the story development, and never shoehorned in because of the medium.  What we are treated to is utterly spectacular worlds which are entirely a figment of the creator's imagination, believable in a way that cgi has seldom, if ever, been before.  There's a richness of lore and background here that will actually make this worth watching twice to catch the detail.
But what about the movie itself... The story is vintage Cameron, and has been much discussed - enough to say it wears it's anti-war and pro-environment credentials on its sleeve.  The planet Pandora has been targeted by one of those big cumbersome corporations Cameron specialises in, with big brutish machinery and military to back it up, to take a valuable mineral in large strip mining operations.  However, the planet's population don't take too kindly to this.  To interact with the 12 foot high N'abi and this world where everything is oversized, genetically created Avatars are used.  It's the `user' of one of these Avatars who becomes the lynchpin of the story - an ex-marine, who now has to decide whether to gain his redemption by fulfilling his marine training, or to embrace the new Gaia he finds on Pandora.  Sam Worthington is perfect in the role - it works that he is relatively unknown, so that we just believe him in the role.  Sigourney Weaver is also her usual terrific self and several other character actors fill out the other roles.  However, the natives (who are to all intents and purposes like Native Americans), and the bad guys (the evil land-raping corporation with its attendant military) are just a little too stereotypically bad.. there's no feeling that you can get inside their heads or understand them.. they are just ciphers in the story to make a point.  Perhaps that's ok when it's a point well made, but the bluntness and obvious nature of the message here could grate with some.
At over two hours long, the movie seems just a little long, but it would be tough to decide which spectacle you'd like to cut to make it shorter - the floating mountains?  The aerial battles?  The flying.. well ok, enough said, I don't want to give any more away...
So a popcorn chewing event movie it is, classic cinema it isn't.  It might not be spectacularly good - but it's definitely good - and certainly spectacular.  Frankly, with all the hype, and with all the new cinematic technology on display, if you don't go see it to make up your own mind, you're going to find yourself left out of a few conversations...",1261180800,4,3462,4.603252032520325
3934305,5,B002HEXVUI,"James Cameron's ""Avatar"" is one of those films where you're happy to just sit back and let it happen. The story is unoriginal on just about every level, yet the way the story is told is an experience unto itself, not utilizing cinematic 3-D technologies so much as revolutionizing them, veering them away from conventional fly-off-the-screen tactics and ushering them into the twenty-first century. Yet again, Cameron's infamous tendency towards perfectionism (and really, really big budgets) pays off, allowing for one of the most creative, striking, immersive environments ever created for the big screen. To look at this movie is to envelope yourself in sheer visual delights, from futuristic spaceships to high-tech gadgets to fantastic creatures, all so finely crafted that they may be mistaken as the real thing.

The plot treads familiar ground as a fable about colonization, intolerance, corporate greed, wastefulness, and war. It takes place over 100 years in the future, when Earth, although not actually seen, has apparently been in the grip of an economic and energy crisis. In an effort to alleviate this issue, Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephan Lang) leads a military operation to the lush, distant moon of Pandora, which is home to a valuable mineral source known as unobtanium. Unfortunately, the largest deposit rests under a patch of land populated by the indigenous Na'vi, graceful ten-foot-tall creatures with glistening blue skin and gold eyes. Because they lack technology, because they believe their land has spiritual properties, they're considered primitive and savage by human standards.

Since Pandora's atmosphere is incapable of supporting human life, interaction with the Na'vi depends on linking the human mind to engineered Na'vi clones called avatars. Here enters Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic ex-marine sent to Pandora to replace his identical twin brother, who has since been killed. His mission: Use his avatar to infiltrate a tribe of the Na'vi, earn their trust, and convince them to move away from their current location. Under the supervision of Earth scientist Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), Jake assumes control of his avatar and enters the jungle, where he soon encounters a Na'vi princess named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). Torn between distrusting him and appreciating his bravery, Neytiri is told by her mother, Mo'at (CCH Pounder), to teach Jake in the ways of their tribe in the hopes that he will become one of the people.

The story then becomes one of great conflict, not just between human and alien, but also between Jake's duty as a marine and his place amongst the Na'vi, which has been complicated by his growing affection for Neytiri. It also becomes a clash of priority, the heartless administrator Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) interested only in making a profit while Grace, who has studied the Na'vi for many years and can speak their language fluently, wants to see their species and way of life preserved. It inevitably comes down to a final battle between good and evil, in which Cameron relies on his own formula of pitting the mechanical against the organic; watching Jake fight Quaritch as he operates an enormous robotic walker, one cannot help but be reminded of the battle between the queen alien and Ripley's power loader in ""Aliens.""

Much has been made of the technical innovations utilized in ""Avatar,"" and I have to say, everything you've heard is true. The 3-D process, made possible through the development of stereoscopic cameras, gives the picture a realistic sense of depth. This is especially true in the scenes taking place on Pandora, which is entirely computer generated. The Na'vi were brought to life by means of motion capture technology, adding a realism the likes of which I've never seen with computer generated imagery, not even in the last three films directed by Robert Zemeckis. They're undeniably otherworldly in appearance, yet they're not so exotic that basic emotions - fear, anger, grief, satisfaction - are impossible to point out. This was a wise move on Cameron's part; we can only invest in the Na'vi if we're able to relate to them at fundamental levels.

But the film's greatest achievement, like ""Star Wars"" before it, is in the way it blends special effects with common story elements. Jake, an example of the Amazing Grace paradigm, starts out as just another guy doing his job before realizing that actions have consequences, some of which could have and should have been prevented. The Na'vi can be symbolic of any number of mistreated indigenous peoples, from Native Americans to Aborigines. There's obvious distrust on both sides, which means there will eventually come a point at which differences must be set aside. The bad guys, most notably Quaritch and Selfridge, are very broadly drawn and not at all likely to have a crisis of conscience anytime soon. Just look at the name Selfridge. Doesn't it sound awfully similar to the word ""selfish""?

All of this seamlessly combines into an unreasonably entertaining film, one that will be appealing, I believe, to audiences both inside and outside science fiction circles. It delivers as a visual effects extravaganza, yes, but it also delivers as an action spectacle, a morality play, and a surprisingly beautiful examination of spirituality, which in this case is backed by measurable scientific data. It also delivers as a showcase of 3-D, and if there's a choice, I strongly recommend you pay the extra money to see it that way (be it at a traditional venue or on an IMAX screen, which I hear is quite an experience). James Cameron has always been an innovator, and he has definitely proven himself once again with ""Avatar,"" a testament to the art of filmmaking.",1261094400,3,5742,5.116204690831556
3934306,4,B002HEXVUI,"I'm a pretty big James Cameron fan, so it's nice to see him back on top in the Sci-Fi genre. Avatar didn't quite reach the brilliant levels of Aliens, The Terminator or Terminator 2: Judgement Day, but the visual beauty of the CGI here, especially in 3-D, is mind blowing. The story and some of the dialogue are the only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars. It borrows heavily from films like Dances with Wolves, Aliens and about three or four more others, so the plot itself wasn't unique. Some of the dialogue is near George Lucas territory and reminded me of a few of those horrible lines from The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and yes, Titanic. Thankfully, most of it is pretty decent.

Now don't get me wrong, Avatar is in my top three movies of the year. The feast for the eyes and the imagination behind it reminds us just how superb James Cameron can be. He has crafted something here that I actually felt a part of as I watched it. Seeing it in IMAX 3-D added huge amounts of depth and I can't imagine seeing it any other way. I felt all the performances were good, especially Sigourney ""Ripley"" Weaver and the main baddie, Stephen Lang. I also thought that Zoe Saldana delivered the most believable motion capture performance since Gollum first came along in 2002. James Horner's music seemed to borrow a little from Titanic at certain times, but I thought it captured the overall mood of Pandora and the ten foot tall blue creatures that inhabit it.

Take my word for it, Avatar is a must see event movie if there ever was one. Everyone I heard as I left the theater had nothing but positive things to say. I think one guy best summed it up by saying ""I feel like I just came out of a two and a half hour dream"" and I couldn't agree more.

4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",1261094400,4,1779,4.304477611940299
3934307,4,B002HEXVUI,"Plotwise, Avatar is basically the intellectual equivalent of a Disney animated feature with a lot of PG-13 grade action and killing added in. That's not to say its bad, by any means.  In fact it's entertaining, has some memorable characters and moments, and keeps you interested from start to finish. It's simple, predictable, formulaic, etc... but its executed pretty well. In that respect, its similar to Titanic.

Based solely on its merits as a science fiction story, Avatar unfortunately pales in comparison to some of Cameron's previous work such as Aliens and Terminator. However, its definitely a milestone for what it accomplishes as a technical achievement in film making. I definitely think that everyone should see this movie at the theater in 3D. Not to do so would be to cheat yourself out of a very unique and enjoyable cinema experience. From start to finish, there were constantly moments where I found myself thinking, 'wow that's just really cool.' And the final battle sequence is nothing short of mesmerizing.

The simple minded story, the overplayed pseudo-native american characteristics of the Na'vi, and the hammy gaia worship spiritualism did make me mentally chuckle.  And when the cartoonish plot attempts to preach with half baked political statements, I did have to roll my eyes somewhat. But I must admit I was having too much fun for any of that to really bother me. All in all, Avatar is awesome for the experience and the sheer fun of it... not for being thought provoking or having a groundbreaking storyline. Sure it would've been all the more awesome if James Cameron had delivered a story just as epic and phenomenal as the presentation.  Nevertheless, a great presentation by itself does make a great movie sometimes.  I believe this is the case with Avatar, and I recommend you see it on a big screen in 3D!",1261094400,2,1847,4.922829581993569
3934308,3,B002HEXVUI,"""Avatar"", directed and written by James Cameron

In the distant future an extremely rare and valuable mineral has been discovered on a distant planet called Pandora. All that stands in the way of the human race mining this mineral is the local alien population known as the Na'vi whose main sanctuary is located on the largest deposit. The human race has developed a program which uses an Avatar or a Na'vi body grown by humans inhabited by a human's mind and controlled. The humans intend to work with the Na'vi in hopes of convincing them to move so the mineral can be mined but so far there has been no progress. Jake Sully, a former marine whose brother has had an Avatar grown for him steps in to operate the Avatar when his brother is murdered. Jake is given 3 months to work out a diplomatic solution with the Na'vi at which point Colonel Miles Quaritch intends to use superior military force to clear the area...

Avatar is a visual and effects masterpiece, let there be no doubt about it. The story however could be described as anything but stellar and the on the nose politics present in the film posed a problem for me as well.

The Good: Avatar is an absolutely beautiful film to view. The effects, the planet, the digital characters and the 3D were excellent. The casting of the film was done well and all actors seemed to agree with their characters. The film was also well scored.

The Bad: The filmed seem a little hollow at the center as I wasn't drawn into great characters usually present in a Cameron film. Cameron doesn't usually re-invent the wheel when writing a story either but is able to carry a film with the great characters. With the great characters being absent in this film we are left with a very average story.

Cameron seems to want his story to be a parable or allegory presenting obvious references to the current situation in the Middle East. Cameron often points the negative finger at big business and the like in his films but usually approaches it with some subtlety. That is not the case in Avatar as he clearly points to the United States and capitalism as great doers of evil. It goes so far as to use phrases such as ""Shock and Awe"" and ""Terror on Terror"" and to point out the company attempting to mine the mineral will eagerly kill all who stand in the way. It basically seems that the mineral is intended to represent oil and the Na'vi are suppose to represent Iraqis. Differing political points of are fine but I will turn on the news for that and would rather not have it forced down my throat in my entertainment.

There are numerous plot holes and gaps in logic throughout the story but I can't go into detail without giving spoilers but can only say I expected more out of James Cameron.

Overall: It's no Aliens. I had high hopes for this film but it fell short. Beautiful on IMAX but not a stellar film overall.",1261094400,12,2868,4.482758620689655
3934309,5,B002HEXVUI,"So many movies promise much in the trailer and then fall flat in the theater.  Avatar is one of the rare cases where no trailer can match the thrill of the film itself.  I've written many customer reviews for Amazon but rarely award five stars.  With Avatar, I did not hesitate to give it the top rating.  It has all of the following in large measures: fully captivating storytelling, amazing visuals, excellent voice acting for the animated portions, and even such things as the score and credits worked really well.  And none of that even touches on the breakthrough technologies we've all heard about in the pre-release hype.  I saw the movie in 3D, and I certainly encourage everyone to do the same.  Often modern 3D movies don't really seem to take full advantage of the possibilities of the form.  Avatar has an unprecedented number of scenes with breathtaking 3D views.  Then there's the brilliant creativity and imagination at work in designing the world of Pandora itself.  The color palette used for the flora and fauna is simply beautiful to behold, and so many of the creatures are just way cool, especially the flying ones.  On the quality of animation, it's not perfect.  I have yet to see any CGI that's 100 percent believable where things like facial expressions are happening, but Avatar comes very close.  As CGI characters engaged in conversation, I was not distracted by the fact that I was watching CGI vs. live action.  And I had fun comparing the avatars' facial features to the live actors/characters they were based on (Sigourney Weaver's, for instance).  in all, I haven't enjoyed a movie-going experience this much in a long time!",1261094400,46,1657,4.826241134751773
3934310,5,B002HEXVUI,"Last night I was among the sellout crowd for one of the two midnight openings at the local IMAX in San Francisco. The most anticipated movie event of the year, and it did not disappoint. IMAX, an exceptionally tall movie screen, with an exceptionally sophisticated 3D state of the art sound system.

Donning my 3D glasses I wondered what to expect. Even though I arrived early, so did everyone else, so I recommend an early arrival, to get a good vantage point.

Jake Sully, former marine, gets drafted in to replace his twin brother recently passed, on a very important mission to the Planet Pandora. At great expense his brother's DNA has been sampled, and combined with the local somewhat humanoid species, to create a hybrid which can be controlled remotely. In this guise, an avatar, an identity assumed in order to interact with the local species, and complete the mission.

Jake enters the world as we do, knowing nothing about Pandora or the Na'vi people. As we observe with our 3D eyes, we experience the world as he experiences it, we come to know and love this world as he does, and we care about its people as he does. As Jake's virtual world becomes more compelling than his real world, he inevitably becomes torn between his mission, to attain the unobtainium, and his choice, save his legs, save the world.

Avatar reportedly cost over $200 million to make, and the money is not invested in a name star, but to greater effect in stunning visuals, and groundbreaking technology.  Our 3D experience is not gimmicky like other movies, but rich and possessing both dimension and depth. Director Cameron goes all out to be totally original in this movie in every way, even in its 3D appearance, and in so doing ushers in a new era in moviemaking.

Avatar as a movie has so many different levels spiritual, psychological, emotional, physical, ecological, a hero, and a heroine who shares her intuitive gifts, a vicarious adventure. Some of these are so subtle, because as the mind becomes occupied with the visual spectacle and the beauty of what you are watching, you many not even notice, that even though none of this movie is set on Planet Earth, your mind in searching for connection with what it already knows, goes to unusual places, almost like you have a double awareness, a hypnotic experience, a 3D way of looking, seeing both sides of the coin at the same time. It says a lot about our world, our history and our time, without saying anything.

The greatest accomplishment of this movie seems to be, something that cannot be seen but can be realised. It's as if Cameron goes into our home which is more of a mansion than we imagined and opens all the windows, and opens the locked doors, and lets light in everywhere, and you think, I didn't realise my house was this big, and I haven't seen that before.

I can hardly wait to see this movie...again. I'm hooked. Undoubtedly, Avatar will be huge. It deserves to be. A unique and new moviegoing experience. I hope you found this helpful.",1261094400,6,3007,4.671077504725898

  as for the 3-d it is unlike anything you have seen! and the cgi has raised the bar, the motion capture is unbelievable! the navi seem like real people! and the creatures and the world just look beautiful! itis just great to look at you will feel like you are in the movie, it has been a long time since i have seen a movie where everything was so detailed down to what the navi ate,how they lived,and how they moved, it is amazing!! just go see it if you give it a chance, you just might like it!!!",1261094400,7,2113,4.186732186732187
3934312,5,B002HEXVUI,"I saw it at a midnight 3D screening after a long day, and never once closed my eyes, except when I absolutely had to blink. The movie is absorbing and seamless, and the invented technology and biology interesting and convincing. The plot moves with economy and speed; the action is dynamic and makes sense. Cameron is a disciplined filmmaker being generous with his audience: a rare combination in a blockbuster, most of which are nowadays made by directors who, regardless of talent, have no discipline (Gore Verbinsky, Michael Bay) or have turned stingy (Steven Spielberg.)

The protagonist is a fine surrogate, recognizably callow and human, and the actor gives a good performance, but (in another instance of Cameron's generosity,) the movie belongs to two women: the scientist played by Sigourney Weaver, and especially the Na'vi romantic lead. This is Cameron's best since ""Aliens"", and a timely reminder that he never merely  replicates a past success, and always (except for ""True Lies"") pushes forward and outward not just the technology but the art of popular cinema. Because his movies are experiments, they are not perfect. But I don't see others improving on them, do you?",1261094400,4,1185,5.103092783505154
3934313,4,B002HEXVUI,"The year is 2154. With resources on Earth being at critical levels, human race is looking into space for survival. Pandora, a moon six years of intergalactic travel away from our planet, is one of such places. The moon's crust is rich with a rare mineral, unobtainium; on Earth just one kilo of the mineral brings an astronomical 20 million dollars! The mining however, is hindered by the presence of Na'vi, technologically primitive people, yet spiritually and physically connected to the fauna and flora that surround them. Those ten-feet-tall blue giants mistrust humans or ""sky people"" as they call them, and want nothing more then to send the intruders back home. In order to ease the tension, the mining company creates Na'vi looking/human controlled avatars. As the Avatars live and move amongst the Na'vi, they are intended to peacefully influence them into relinquishing the control of the unobtainium rich territories. However, as it often is when you put a heavily armed band of trigger happy mercenaries together with profit hungry but scruples poor business people, a peaceful solution does not look likely for the Na'vi. Enter Jake Sully. He is a marine vet, paralyzed from the waste down with hopes that a stint on Pandora will earn him his legs back. As a last minute replacement for his deceased twin brother, he is ill prepared for the assignment. Still, with an open mind and a pure heart, Jake begins to explore the wondrous world of the Na'vi... Soon, he finds love... then, purpose...

I really wanted NOT to like this film. In my mind, its obscene budget of $250,000,000 was a perfect manifestation of what is wrong with the cinema today where budgets often play more important roles then talent. Still, I have become so enchanted with the visual spectacle that is Avatar, I see no other choice but to wholeheartedly, although not unreservedly, recommend it for viewing. I cannot stress this enough: the film MUST be appreciated in 3-D, or else its appeal will be significantly diminished. Avatar's strength is clearly in its astonishing visuals. The story itself is somewhat naive, full of stereotypes, and likely does not make much sense emotionally: boy meets girl; they go off into the sunset; capitalism bad; technology bad; giant blue people good. In order to fully enjoy the show, you must NOT allow yourself to focus on what the story lacks. Instead, allow Cameron's vision of the Pandora World to entertain you. The writer/director had spent close to 15 years bringing Avatar to the screen. During that time over one thousand artists, craftsmen, and scientists had touched this product in some way. The Na'vi had been equipped with a thousand word strong language. An elaborate structure of customs and culture had been created for them. Pandora's eco system had been established in astonishing detail. All of this filmed using new 3-D technology that never, during the two hours and forty minutes of viewing, makes you doubt the reality of the Pandora World. It is an impressive achievement on Cameron's part. I feel I have witnessed the birth of something new in the film industry. How can you say NO to that?! Solid four stars from me (though I am still undecided if this trully felt like a quarter of a billion dollars worth of entertainment; likely not).

The opening seen flying over the forest blew me away, and right there I knew I had just witnessed something I have never seen and this would continue to blow my mind throughout the movie. It was beautiful and more real than life. Like if we could see more detail in our world, this move showed us that.  I love nature and wildlife, and many times I see something and it looks just so beautiful.  This movie is like that but all the time.  It really touched me, just the beauty aspect. The plot was good (thats my opinion), but now that I have read reviews I can see teh dullness.  But most movies have aspects of other great movies, it just matters how you portray them and deliver teh emotion.  It felt weird feeling emotion for these 10' tall blue creatures, but it wasn't hard with their lifelike faces that express so much feelings.  Its amazing what Cameron did with this movie. Avatar has changed my outlook on movies and the capabilities of modern CGI technology.  I have never walked away from a movie and missed it like I did with Avatar.

This is how animated and real life should be worked.  Reminded me of Star Wars with the alien environment looking believable.  This movie raises the bar like the original Star Wars did when Gorge Lucas came out with a Scifi movie that didn't use rubber suits and pie pans for special effects.  The story line is universal and the story is very engrossing.  If you can afford it take your significant other or go by yourself it is worth seeing on the big screen in 3d.  Oh for the adults out there with kids this movie is too violent for children.  I am one of those people who think that violence depicted on the big screen is more harmful than a pair of naked breasts. That said I would recommend this motion picture to anyone who thinks that 3D movies are for children or lowbrow-ed society.  This is the only 3D movie I have ever gone to that was worth the extra money to see it.

3934316,1,B002HEXVUI,"This is the Yahoo Movies synopsis of Avatar (probably supplied by the production company's PR department):

""AVATAR takes us to a spectacular world beyond imagination, where a reluctant hero embarks on an epic adventure, ultimately fighting to save the alien world he has learned to call home. James Cameron, the Oscar-winning director of ""Titanic,"" first conceived the film 15 years ago, when the means to realize his vision did not exist yet. Now, after four years of production, AVATAR, a live action film with a new generation of special effects, delivers a fully immersive cinematic experience of a new kind, where the revolutionary technology invented to make the film disappears into the emotion of the characters and the sweep of the story.

""We enter the alien world through the eyes of Jake Sully, a former Marine confined to a wheelchair. But despite his broken body, Jake is still a warrior at heart. He is recruited to travel light years to the human outpost on Pandora, where corporations are mining a rare mineral that is the key to solving Earth's energy crisis. Because the atmosphere of Pandora is toxic, they have created the Avatar Program, in which human ""drivers"" have their consciousness linked to an avatar, a remotely-controlled biological body that can survive in the lethal air. These avatars are genetically engineered hybrids of human DNA mixed with DNA from the natives of Pandora... the Na'vi.

""Reborn in his avatar form, Jake can walk again. He is given a mission to infiltrate the Na'vi, who have become a major obstacle to mining the precious ore. But a beautiful Na'vi female, Neytiri, saves Jake's life, and this changes everything. Jake is taken in by her clan, and learns to become one of them, which involves many tests and adventures. As Jake's relationship with his reluctant teacher Neytiri deepens, he learns to respect the Na'vi way and finally takes his place among them. Soon he will face the ultimate test as he leads them in an epic battle that will decide nothing less than the fate of an entire world.""

Now, if you believe the above description and want to see this probable-piece of crap movie, I think I have a large bridge to sell you in the Virgin Islands.

***UPDATE***:

Well, I saw it last night in Seoul, went to see it just out of plain curiosity. I now have very mixed and skeptical feelings about the film.

On the one hand, the visual quality of much of the movie is some of the best I've ever seen, and whatever technology James Cameron and his team have developed it is amazingly effective at rendering exquisitely aesthetic moving images. This technology will apparently revolutionize moviemaking for the forseeable future, that much I do agree with.

I also have to respect the skill and creativity and talent in developing elements of the Na'vi civilization, customs, rituals and values expressed in the story and the visuals and production design which the writers and artists came up with.

However, I view this film to be at least somewhat (or maybe VERY) cynical in the way that it tries to use innocence and purity in the story and motivations of the Na'vi as well as Jake and his human allies while at the same time glossing over the realities of the inherent evil of the military, and the nature of corporations and corporate economic dominance which those characters should have known about. And also while making the Na'vi people seem cluless and naiive to the point of being almost ignorant or moronic.

While much of the Na'vi folklore and Pandora's ecology in the film is undeniably beautiful and is morally and spiritually touching and uplifting, I find the overall statement of the film after seeing it rather manipulative on the part of the producers and writers. This film is like a Cinderella fairy tale for five year-old's. But guess what, girls do not turn into princesses in real life when they put on emerald-colored slippers. Avatar has no basis in reality in terms of life as it exists in the real world and the way we human beings, or humanoids for that matter, live and understand our life and our relations with our world and fellow people; yet its premise is, what would happen in a realistic future if corporations and the military teamed up to try and exploit and colonize inter-galactic worlds.

We are asked to believe that Jake and his buddies in the corporation and Marine squadron are ""good guys"", yet they are employed by the military or the corporation, and at least in terms of the doctor and the scientists, if they are intelligent enough to have doctorates and be some of the brightest scientists in the world, aren't they intelligent and discerning enough to know from the beginning, before they signed their contracts and chose these positions, that they would be asked to exploit people and foreign planets and engage in very morally questionable activities??

In the case of the female helicopter pilot, did she only find out recently that the military commanders often have evil intentions and that ""lighting up"" the natives and valuable rain forests is wrong??

When the Na'vi realize they are about to be destroyed, and decide to fight back, that is kind of like a third world country deciding to fight back against a first world power like the U.S after it has already lost. It just doesn't happen. It doesn't happen for a very good reason -- Countries, or even tribes, generally will not commit mass suicide by challenging an opponent who totally dominates them and can annihilate them at will, they will attempt more intelligent ways to survive, and eventually hope to gain freedom through outsmarting their foe.

The Na'vi only have horses and giant birds and arrows; the humans have battleships, helicopters, robot soldiers, machine guns, and also presumably nuclear and chemical weapons. When the Na'vi fight back and actually win the battle in the film, it is more than ridiculous -- it is simply, and totally, implausible. And if the Na'vi had closed the humans' school so long ago, why did they only now decide to mobilize for self-defense and fight back? Why did they allow their Dream Forest to be burned and bulldozed without already being mobilized for defense, since they already knew about and distrusted the humans and knew they were trying to colonize them??

Also, why was it only Americans and U.S. Marines who made up the corporation and the military?? In the year Avatar takes place, has the United States taken control of all off-world commerce and colonization? Has the U.S. become the world's sole government? Or was Pandora a U.S. Zone-delineated planet? There was no explanation that I remember why all the human people were American and mostly white or fair-skinned Americans and spoke Americanized English. I didn't see any Asians, Africans, or other types. Maybe only the U.S. and Americans are sinister enough in our present world to portray the evil parts and characters in a story like Avatar?

None of it makes any sense, but it sure is beautiful to look at at times. And the Na'vi rituals and rites of passage certainly are emotionally compelling (if you can leave your logic and common sense at the door, that is).

However, visual beauty, creative, emotional sentimentality, and high-technology filmmaking advances do not a great film make.

And, I also didn't like the epic, ear-shattering Star Wars-type battles that Cameron felt obligated to put in for the climaxes. Must every blockbuster film have loud, over-the-top mega-battles?? I don't even enjoy them, they give me a headache and they're disturbing and uncomfortable to watch most of the time.

Avatar has achived some very important technologies for the craft of filmmaking, but it is nowhere near a cohesively written and thought-out film, and its amazing beauty and heart-rending symbolism cannot support the house of cards that the story is built on. The story is riddled with fallacies like a large piece of Swiss cheese. This is not a film for thinking people, this is pure escapism and emotionality with some macho action scenes which does not pass the smell test of further consideration.

I will not go see this again, all the cinamatographic beauty and elegant turns of phrases and artistic talents in the world can not make up for a story, plot and backstory that are completely illogical, impossible, and make zero sense. The fact that so much of this film is so beautiful and compelling makes it even more frustrating and ultimately irritating to watch.",1261094400,22,8477,4.885873347251218

3934318,5,B002HEXVUI,"I just got back from a midnight showing in 3D. The movie was fantastic. I'm very interested in technology and am also an artist so this movie had me very excited for a while leading up to the showing. So it had to meet very high expectations. And it blew them away. From an objective standpoint, the story is solid and good. It is engrossing as well as a well thought out narrative that will emotionally draw you in. It is not however, unpredictable. You can pretty much tell what is going to happen and guess it rather easily. But if a movie is predictable or not doesn't really make a difference in an action drama, as much as say, a suspenseful movie. So this did not really bother me.

The movie is a very good representation of struggles of power and culture, and an interesting take on the matter to boot. So without taking into account the visual effects of the movie I would consider it a 5 star film in the acting and emotional response triggered in myself watching this film.

When i consider the visual effects, being an artist myself, it blows my mind. Avatar has set a precedent for any CGI film that is going to be made in the future. The faces of computer generated characters are no longer soulless and empty. The eyes are still a window to the soul. As the film states, ""I see you."" As in seeing into you, understanding you. You will feel as if the Navi are living breathing entities. With this new technology and the care that was taken in how this film was made the suspension of disbelief is all but gone. You are presented with something that looks so real, that feels so real watching, that it is not so farfetched to believe.

Avatar was a fantastic film for me, I will for sure be showing this to my students when I am teaching art. I hope everyone gives it a chance, if you don't like it thats fine. But every film deserves a chance.",1261094400,10,1858,4.318051575931232

It now resides with my 8,000 dvd movie collection and it is a welcome and much anticipated addition!",1528329600,,286,3.9482758620689653
8370257,4,B002HEXVUI,"I wasn't sure what to expect here, knowing absolutely nothing about the movie before watching it.

On the positive side, the movie is definitely engaging, and the visual effects are both stunning in execution and outstanding in their creativity.  It's also an amazingly fresh premise for a story. On the whole, a thoroughly enjoyable and visually satisfying presentation.

That said, the storyline was predictable.  As different elements were encountered during the timeline, it was pretty obvious that they would all be revisited sometime later.  Did anyone NOT see the ending of the movie during the scene where they try to transfer Grace's essence to her avatar?  Was there ever any doubt that Jake would be the next Tokar Macto as soon as that element was exposed in the story?

It's also hard to walk away from this story-line without feeling like I've just seen a remake of Dances with Wolves.  There were the obligatory one-dimensional bad guys.  The was the warrior/leader among the native people who initially opposed the hero, but would become a stalwart supporter.  There was the love interest that would serve as the catalyst to allow the hero to become integrated into the tribe.  Yes, the ending was less dark, but the parallels were too significant to ignore.",1528243200,,1274,4.990521327014218
