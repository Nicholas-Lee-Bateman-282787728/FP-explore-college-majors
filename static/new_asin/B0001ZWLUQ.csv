2047338,4,B0001ZWLUQ,This movie was a refreshing breathe of clean air.  The plot was believable.  The acting was good to very good.  I was particularly impressed by Charles Robinson.  How many farm hands do you find who carry a high level of maturity along with seasoned wisdom and a gentle wit.  The script writers did a good job.  But Robinson deserves much credit for handling the part very skilfully.,1244764800,,383,4.641791044776119
2047339,4,B0001ZWLUQ,"This film was produced by the cable channel TNT and having noted that one should not expect that the result is a bonafide theatrical release, but taken for what it is MISS LETTIE & ME is great tear-jerking, holiday entertainment. Holiday films are sappy, they are supposed to be because that is why we watch... Who would watch A CHRISTMAS CAROL if Scrooge made no kind of transformation?

MISS LETTIE AND ME is the story of a family that is brought together by the unwanted intrusion of a young girl who needs to be wanted almost as badly as her great aunt needs to be needed. The players here are comfortable and in good form. Mary Tyler Moore and Burt Reynolds head up a talented cast and make a nice Christmas themed movie for the whole family.",1133136000,10,747,4.452554744525547

8019051,4,B0001ZWLUQ,"Miss Lettie (Mary Tyler Moore) receives a letter that her niece is on the way. It's not really a problem. Lettie has the room for her in the big house on the farm, but it was unexpected.
  The little girl, Travis (Holliston Coleman), arrives by bus and the handyman, Isaiah (Charles Robinson) picks her up at the station.
  Lettie is too business-like and stern. It takes Aunt Lettie a while to warm up to Travis.  She did not know Alison (Jennifer Crumbley) had a daughter.
  Travis has never seen a small town before, especially without sidewalks. However, the small town life with Miss Lettie and Isaiah's help is good for her.
  Isaiah believes Lettie's real problem is that she hasn't been in love for a long time.
  Sam Madison (Burt Reynolds) moves back into this town where he grew up to open up his own ice cream & soda fountain shoppe.  Lettie knew him years ago.
  Perhaps Travis can be of some help.

Irma P. Hall is also in the cast.

Filmed in Griffin, Georgia.

  Good decent movie. Would have liked a sequel to this one or a tv series, but they never did.

Burt Reynolds and Mary Tyler Moore appeared in the same episode (#9) of the ""Riverboat"" tv series in 1959.",1274227200,2,1179,4.446009389671362
