8351565,3,B00260HH3U,"Overall, this is not what I'd call a total failure but I was expecting more from John Boorman, the director who gave us the likes of Deliverance, Zardoz, Excalibur, The Emerald Forest and, one of my all-time favorites, Hope and Glory. In this uneven mix of comedy and drama, a successful Irish real estate tycoon tries to fend off an aggressive doppleganger who might be the product of his imagination or it could be his actual twin. The plot held a lot of potential and could have been an entertaining affair but it's spoiled by characters who don't ring true--the most glaring example is the main character's Marxist-spouting son. Ultimately, the tone of the film is so off-base that director Boorman could have changed the entire film into a farce by simply replacing the dramatic music score with lighter comedic cues.",1296086400,7,822,4.836879432624113
