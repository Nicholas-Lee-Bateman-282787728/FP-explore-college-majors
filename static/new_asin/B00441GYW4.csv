If you are not familiar with Bandai they have been translating anime since the 1970's.  They are an excellent company with many titles. You want a good animation this is it..",1394409600,,332,4.39344262295082
8415563,4,B00441GYW4,"Just when you thought the last volume of ""Kurokami the Animation"" was spectacular and action-packed, here we are with volume four of the anime series which kicks off the second season with more action, drama and the highly anticipated battle between Kuro/Keita vs. Raiga!

""Kurokami"" vol. 4 features the episodes 12.5-16 of the TV series on one Blu-ray disc. Here is a brief, spoiler-free synopsis of each episode:

  * EPISODE 12.5 - Intermission - A special episode which aired before episode 13 in Japan.  Keita narrates a recap of what took place from episodes 1-12.
  * EPISODE 13 - New World - Kuraki orders the Pro-Kaionji Tera Guardians to find Keita and destroy anyone who gets in their way.
  * EPISODE 14 - Breakthrough - Bernhard leads Noble One operatives including Yakumo and Riona to infiltrate the Kaionji group.  Meanwhile, Yuki plans to kill Akane in order to become a negative root.
  * EPISODE 15 - Carnage - Kuro and Keita go against the powerful Shinra but Kuro worries that Keita will die if he diverts all his life energy into her.
  * EPISODE 16 - Ruin - After the events which took place in episode 15, we are introduced to a new and much more powerful duo of Kuro and Keita.

VIDEO:

""Kurokami The Animation"" is featured in 1080p High Definition. The series is quite vibrant and looks absolutely beautiful in HD. Blacks are nice and deep, colors pop and I didn't notice any edge enhancement or compression artifacts during my viewing of the series.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Kurokami The Animation"" is presented in English PCM 2.0. And as mentioned in my previous review of volume 1 of the series, ""Kurokami"" does not include the lossless Japanese audio while the DVD
does include both soundtracks. It is discussed on various message boards that because the series is being released at the same time in Japan, to prevent reverse importation, the lossless Japanese soundtrack was not granted for the U.S. release (note: In Japan, the Blu-ray release costs about three times as more than the U.S. release and to prevent reverse importation over there, they didn't include English subtitles).

Unfortunately with Japan and the U.S. on the same region for Blu-ray releases and people demanding simultaneous or near simultaneous releases, this is easily going to be an issue for American anime fans if more series continue to feature the lack of a Japanese audio track.

As for the English dub, for the most part the English dubbing was well-done. Jason Griffith (as Keita) known for his work for the character Shadow for ""Sonic X"" does a very good job but anime voice acting veterans Laura Bailey (as Kuro) and Julie Ann Taylor (as Akane) do a solid job as the voice of their characters.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Kurokami the Animation vol. 4"" contains the following special features:

  * Textless theme and ending themes - Included are one textless opening themes and four textless ending themes for ""Kurokami the Animation"".
  * Bandai Entertainment Previews

JUDGMENT CALL:

Just when you have thought that ""Kurokami the Animation"" had ended the first season with a bang!  The first few episodes of the second season continues the action-packed storyline as the Kaionji group continues their fight against the Noble Ones.  With the Terra Guardians helping out the Kaionji group, Kuro, Keita and friends are literally in defense mode, especially Kuro as she is unable to fight without Keita (who is in a coma).

But what makes this latest volume so exciting for me was that it devoted itself to furthering the bond between Kuro and Keita.  Especially with Kuro worrying about Keita's life and him fighting and fighting and literally killing himself in the process.  So, it was very interesting to see how things have developed in these first four episodes of the new season and I'm even more excited to see how things develop in vol. 5 as the new and very powerful Kuro and Keita aim to do the impossible.  So, it'll be interesting to see if they accomplish that.

As for positives, the major positive aside from the story is this series looks fantastic on Blu-ray. Character designs are well done and are vibrant onscreen, the detailed artistic backgrounds definitely look beautiful and the fighting sequences look absolutely fluid. I didn't catch any edge enhancement or any significant artifacting but I haven't compared the DVD to the Blu-ray series either. But I'm confident on how beautiful this series is on Blu-ray.

On the negative side, I think that many anime fans who prefer a Japanese soundtrack and also prefer to purchase anime on Blu with a lossless Japanese audio soundtrack. So, I can feel their pain! As mentioned, with Japan and U.S. sharing the same region on Blu-ray and with people wanting simultaneous (or near-simultaneous) releases, this is going to be a major issue in the near future and I hope this is something that can be resolved for future releases.

The other negative that I can think of for anime fans is episodes per volume. With other anime companies releasing complete series or breaking down their releases by a dozen episodes, ""Kurokami"" which is a 23-episode series features only four episodes per volume (although vol. 4 does come with five episodes with the inclusion of the special recap episode 12.5) and also releases thus far have not really included many special features but the textless opening and closing themes and Bandai Entertainment trailers.  But I suppose without a Japanese vocal track, it makes it difficult to include anything related to the Japanese releases of ""Kurokami"".

Overall, ""Kurokami - The Animation"" is an entertaining anime series that so far features a solid storyline and really cool animation/background art. Volume 4 continues that action-driven storyline where the last volume had left off.  As well as continuing the dramatic component that made the last volume so enjoyable.

If you have watched the first three volumes thus far, you're definitely going to enjoy the fourth!  ""Kurokami the Animation"" is definitely an anime series on Blu-ray worth checking out!",1292284800,,6061,4.9476284584980235
