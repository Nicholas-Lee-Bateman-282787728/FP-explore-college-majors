350774,5,6301708113,"This is a great movie! I wouldn't recommend it for kids,but it managed to completely terrify me as a child. Even now I get spooked when I watch it and keep in mind this movie was made in 1981. Some movies are timelessly  scary,although i'm probably warped for life I love this movie. Its a classic  movie that can didn't need blood or violence to really make you shiver!",943833600,2,370,4.3478260869565215
350775,4,6301708113,"I too saw this movie as a child and still regard it as one of the spookiest movies I've ever seen.  I still get chills thinking about the blindfold.  I definately recommend this film for people who do not like the  blood and gore of today's ""horror"" movies.  My advice is not to  let the children watch it when they're too young!",942105600,,329,4.241935483870968
350776,3,6301708113,This flick is really fun because it was at the time so unlike Disney to make a film about possesion by aliens that has such an eerie tone.  Looking forward to the DVD,935452800,,166,4.03030303030303

I was excited to find out that they were coming out with a new letterbox video version and I bought  it right away.  I did not like the book of this story, but the movie is  great.  It was made by Walt Disney productions but don't let it fool you,  it is very scary.",933292800,,388,3.7160493827160495

350917,5,6301708113,"RELEASED IN 1980/1981 and directed by John Hough, ""The Watcher in the Woods"" details events in England when an American family moves into a country manor for the summer while the mysterious owner, Mrs. Aylwood (Bette Davis), lives in the guest house. The teen daughter, Jan (Lynn-Holly Johnson), readily discerns something weird is going on, which is linked to Mrs. Aylwoods missing daughter, Karen (Katharine Levy), from decades earlier. Jan investigates the mystery with the aid of a neighbor stud (Benedict Taylor) and her younger sister (Kyle Richards). Carroll Baker & David McCallum play the girls parents.

This is a great mood movie thick with haunting ambiance, augmented by an unnerving score. DONT expect typical Disney kiddie fare. Despite inexplicable criticism, winsome Lynn-Holly Johnson shines as the protagonist and carries the film with Davis superlative as the curmudgeonly crone. Baker was still stunning as the mother.

The original ending of the movie wasn't finished in time so important expositional scenes were cut, which left the story nonsensical. Negative critical response to a test run in spring, 1980, resulted in the movie being pulled from theaters and, after reshoots, a more subdued ending was inserted for its official release in fall, 1981, which is the official ending.

The original ending included a cool a skeletal-insectoid alien as the Watcher, who eerily floats in thin air, which also appeared in the 1980 test run, minus an explanatory other world sequence (which was the part that wasn't completed in time). While the 1980 ending fails to properly explain events, I thought it was quite effective for the time period and for this type of movie. Not everythings tied up, but thats okay because its a haunting mystery movie anyway. The longer version with the other world sequence goes overkill with the gobbledygook.

For a way more low-key version with an intelligible and more interesting (but less entertaining) climax, which happens to be more faithful to the book, see the 2017 TV movie by Melissa Joan Hart.

THE FILM RUNS 84 minutes (theatrical version) and was shot in Warwickshire, Buckinghamshire & Pinwood Studios, England, with further studio work and reshoots (directed by Vincent McEveety) done in Burbank, California. WRITERS: Brian Clemens & two others based on Florence Engel Randalls novel.

350918,4,6301708113,"I loved this movie when I first saw it, and it still holds up today. I also own the DVD with the alternate ending. Although Im curious as to why in one version, Karen is played by one actress as a young girl and then when she returns she is a different actress, and also looks like she got older. In the other version, Karen is played by the same young actress and is also credited at the end. Anyone know the answer to this question?

351299,5,6301708113,"To this day, this will be the movie that terrified me the most, and this is coming from someone who now loves horror movies and has seen Annabelle, Ouija, etc.

My grade 6 teacher showed my class this movie for Halloween, and it crippled me for years. I was probably 10-11 at the time, and that was my very first horror movie. There was just something about the movie that really spooked me out, from the blindfolded girl to the mirrors. The ""help me"" scene in the house of mirrors was the one scene I couldn't get out of my mind and it ate at my soul.  Despite the ending when everything is solved and all of that is explained, I was still ridiculously terrified. There's something about seeing mirrors and blindfolded girls (there was something about her specific blindfold that made it so creepy - maybe how it covered so much of her face) that was so frightening.

To this day, this was the horror movie that had the longest lasting effect on me, and the one that terrified me completely. A movie I need to watch again now that I'm a bit older than when I watched it. This is one movie from my childhood that I completely remember watching and one that still gives me goosebumps thinking about it, from the effect it gave me.",1451606400,,1229,4.381578947368421

351515,4,6301708113,"Genocide.

Its a word that, like the crime itself, seems always to have existed, whether it was Imperial Romes systematic killing of Christians, the 17th and 18th century French Catholic persecution of the Huguenots, or Americas attempts to eliminate the Indian problem.

But the word wasn't coined until 1944, when Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jew who lost 49 relatives in the Nazi holocaust, combined the Greek word for family or race (genos) with the Latin word for killing (cide).

Watchers of the Sky is partly about Lemkins lifelong attempts to draw attention to international crimes of genocide and to work to prevent future mass murders. But its also based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide, by Samantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.

Power is frequently shown on camera and in action at the U.N., while Lemkin, who died in 1959, is shown in photos and reenactment clips. Other activists are shown as well, such as Emmanuel Uwurukundo, who must be accompanied by armed guards as he goes from his residence to the three Darfur refugee camps in Chad that he oversees as a worker for the UN Refugee Agency. Also shown talking about genocide is Ben Ferencz, who was a friend of Lemkins and a prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials, and Luis Moreno Ocampo, chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, who is shown as he builds a case against Omar al-Bashir, who remains at large as President of Sudan.

Sometimes its an uncomfortable weave that threatens to unravel, even as we watch the crusaders hit roadblocks and wonder if the job is too big and prejudice too rampant. Sometimes the focus jumps from the killers to the investigators and back again. Sometimes Watchers of the Sky seems tediously slow and disjointed by so many narratives. But every good documentary enlightens you, and Watchers of the Skies certainly does that. Some viewers may not know about the Einsatzgroups that reported killing 90,000 people for Hitler between June 1941 and June 1942 alone, for example. Some of the most fascinating historical footage is of those accused of genocide, like the Serbian leader Ratka Mladic or the Sudan president Omar Hassan al-Bashir. There are segments and stretches where you find yourself so transfixed that you're prone to forgive director Edet Belzberg for tackling too much or trying to be a little too PBS in her filmmaking so that it sometimes gets in the way of the story.

Ironically, if you look at the bonus features, youll see that some terrific segments were omitted because they also would have gotten in the way of the storyor rather, the films theses. What the film emphasizes is Lemkins unflagging commitment to trying to convince the U.N. to take action against genocide, but what some of his family and friends say on camera is that he could be a pain in the ass. Here comes Lemkin U.N. delegates would say, closing their doors to hide in their offices. He could be a nuisance, one of the relatives admits. Persistent doesnt begin to describe it, another one says. Obsessed does. Fewer than 10 people attended Lemkins funeral, and his relatives say that his greatest disappointment was that the U.S. was one of the nations that did not fully sign off at the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, expressing the reservation that the nation must grant consent for any of its citizenry to go before an international court for the crime of genocidewhich, of course, is problematic if the authority in power is responsible.

Another enlightening bonus feature shows Ferencz addressing a U.N. subcommittee on genocide and taking them to task for having voted as a body to condemn genocide but debating for10 years how to define an act of aggression that would allow the body to act. It sheds light on how deeply endemic the problem is, and how internal politics remains the United Nations worst enemy.

As a work of documentary, Watchers of the Sky is average in its execution. Theres nothing here to push the genre and it won't be mistaken for one of the best examples of the form. But it does illuminate the subject matter and archival footage scattered throughout does much to compensate for a pace that sometimes drags.",1425340800,,4257,4.862068965517241

351545,3,6301708113,"The Watcher in the Woods was a doomed Disney project plagued by numerous writers and reshoots and several endings too many.  It's true; too many cooks spoil the broth.  The incomparable Brian Clemens adapted the novel by Florence Engel Randall into a screenplay that Disney executive Ron Miller determined was ""too dark"" so Rosemary Anne Sisson  had a turn revising it, then Gerry Day took a swipe at it, and so on.  Disney Studio wanted a film that was dark but not too dark, intense but not too intense.  This is what they ended up with.  Supposedly, there were about 152 possible endings roughed out before they ran out of time and settled on the obscure finale that now saddles this sorry film.  It also didn't help that they had second thoughts about using `occult' elements in the story.  Better to make it a sci-fi flick than that.  Worst of all, they took an ice skater (Lynn-Holly Johnson) and thought to make a star of her, under-utilizing far greater available talent: Carroll Baker, David McCallum, Ian Bannen, not to mention Bette Davis........for pity sake.

More of a curiosity than a classic.  I've kept it for Bette Davis and because it features fabulous camerawork by my favorite cinematographer Alan Hume.  Otherwise, I cringe every time Lynn-Holly Johnson tries her worst to emote the full range of her lack of talent.",1422403200,,1338,4.794759825327511

Later, I did get to see it on some cable station--for some reason, I think Hallmark channel--and though the film played like a made-for-TV Lifetime movie. A family moves into a mansion, they have two young girls who begin to experience odd things--especially in connection with the surrounding woods. Bette Davis is their landlord, who also lives on the property in a separate house. Thirty years before, her young daughter disappeared during a childish ""ritual"" a group of local kids were doing in an abandoned church. What happened to the girl? Well, apparently, she was sucked into another dimension (or to another planet, take your pick), while a creature from that dimension was sucked into our existence. The creature wants to get back, but the only way is to have the kids, now grown, re-enact the ceremony. The key is the older girl, who gives one of the most vapid performances I've ever seen. Just her voice is enough to tell me the part is beyond her. Anyway, the creature starts reaching out to this teen, showing her flashes of Bette's daughter trapped in the other dimension. In the end, everything works out...except the girl we'd seen throughout the film (Bette's daughter) is played by a completely different actress in the end! There's a supplement to the DVD that had been cut out of the original film and should've stayed. It shows the creature in a great payoff, and we see exactly where Bette's daughter is and how she's rescued. As it stands, Watcher in the Woods is tame material indeed. As one reviewer put it, there is a nice sense of dread, but that's about it. Bette Davis is wasted in a thankless part, as is the great Carroll Baker--though she looks lovely.

351633,2,6301708113,"I recall having seen this film when it first came out in 1980. I was about 15 and it was... not scary, not engaging and not so great. The biggest impression it left is that it was kinda dull. It just kind of faded into that lineup of lesser Disney films from the Ron Miller era when Walts son-in-law was president/CEO at Disney from 1978 to 1983.

For me, it fell right in there with movies like Condorman. The Devil and Max Devlin, Herbie Goes Bananas, The Black Cauldron, and The Last Flight of Noahs Ark. There were bright spots like Tron, and The Fox and the Hound, but they weren't enough and this wasn't one of them. Under Millers leadership, the company became the target of corporate raiders and he was eventually ousted by Disney family member Roy E. Disney in favor of Michael Eisner, Frank Wells, and Jeffrey Katzenberg.

Heres the short version of the films plot: an American family moves into an English cottage in a wooded area and strange things begin happening to 17-year old daughter Jan and 10-year old Ellie. Jan eventually figures out it has something to do with the disappearance 30 years earlier of the property owners daughter and takes it upon herself to investigate. And, oh yeah, something watching them - from the woods.

Anyway, I was hoping that not having seen this film for more than 30 years, it would strike me differently now, but not so much. Its no fun, takes itself way too seriously (theres pretty much no humor in it), and takes me nowhere worth going. It tries to walk the supernatural chiller/horror route, but really doesnt get there, has poor effects and the muddled explanation of the titular Watcher ultimately makes no sense. This film has all the trappings of a ghost story, but devolves into something else.

From the DVD artwork for the 2010 release, youd think the story revolves around screen legend Bette Davis, who was celebrating her 50th year in films with this outing. As it turns out, as the property owner, shes an important but not central character and she looks bored most of the time here.

On paper, the rest of the cast looks great as well.  Playing the dad is David McCallum, who is known as both agent Ilya Kuryakin from the 1960s TV series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and more recently as Dr. Donald Duckie Mallard on the series NCIS. Portraying the mom is Carroll Baker, an accomplished actress with more than 80 film and television credits stretching from 1952 to 2003 including the movie Giant with James Dean in 1956, and Kindergarten Cop with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1990. The problem is that none of these folks really has a lot to do or is even on screen all that much. Instead the film rests on the shoulders of Holly Lynn-Johnson, who plays Jan and who is best known as the teenaged ice skater who tries unsuccessfully to seduce Roger Moores James Bond in 1981s For You Eyes Only. She is also known for 1978s Ice Castles. Its sad to say, but Lynn-Johnson isn't a strong enough actress to carry this film and by the end, I just found her annoying.

Director John Hough had a long career and previously helmed some bona fide hits including the  The Legend of Hell House and Disneys two Witch Mountain movies about young aliens trying to find their way home. Some critics list Watcher as the beginning of a fatlering of his track record but note he came back with 1982s The Incubus.

In addition to the theatrical version of the film, this DVD includes two alternate endings, which give a more physical form to the watcher than what was seen in theaters, but still aren't very satisfying. Those endings and two theatrical trailers are the extent of the special features here.

This film might pacify and possibily even scare younger children for 90 minutes or so,  but my advise it to avoid these woods, as theres better choices out there.",1396310400,,3809,4.603244837758112

Having recently seen the alternate endings available on the DVD, however, I am pretty glad they stuck with the ending they did. It leaves a lot more to the imagination and it does make sense, even though I thought it was too simple. In comparison, it made for a much better conclusion.

I wish they didn't describe Bette's character on the back of the box as mean and eccentric! In reality, this was one of the nicer characters she has played!

351885,5,6301708113,"Holy cow, it's Halloween---time to watch some scary movies! However, I don't care for hard-core horror, so I'm sticking to only very slightly spooky films.  And so I've just viewed ""Watcher in the Woods,"" an old favourite from 1980.

This picture has a lot of nostalgic appeal for me; I remember there was quite a lot of press about it as it was being filmed, because this was the very first time the Disney studio seemed to be attempting to do a film a bit more ""adult"" in nature, as compared to their usual output. Unfortunately, the film doesn't quite succeed, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth watching.

It's marvellously atmospheric and spooky---great cinematography, fantastic eerie locations, good scary music. The problem comes in the last five minutes, which are a let-down after all the build-up. To be frank, the ending simply doesn't make any sense. (Let me tell you, ""magnetic pull of the eclipse"" is an absolutely meaningless nonsense phrase--drives me crazy!) And in fact the finale was always the problem with this film.

Upon its initial release, all the critics took note of the bizarre ending, and the film was immediately pulled for retooling. After some additional shooting and editing, the film was re-released a year later; there was an improvement, but ---eh---the ending was still kind of iffy and a bit disappointing. Still... I can overlook that problem, because I enjoyed the earlier portions of the film so much. The DVD of ""Watcher in the Woods"" contains three different endings, and frankly none of them really work. The best solution, I think, would be to edit together portions of all three, for a new composite conclusion. However, what it all comes down to is problems with the script---problems that were quite unnecessary, in my opinion. I've read the book upon which the screenplay was based, and the mystery makes perfect sense at the end of the novel---it's a pretty cool concept. I don't know why on earth the writers of the film couldn't have stayed closer to this logical way of summing up the plot, for goodness sake.

The acting talent on display in this picture is decidedly mixed. Kyle Richards (sister of big 1970's child star Kim Richards, who worked on a number of well-remembered films and television series) is cute as a button, but kind of annoying. Now, I don't want to sound too mean-spirited, but Lynn-Holly Johnson unfortunately displays no acting talent whatsoever, in my opinion. She plays every scene in the last two-thirds of the picture in full-blown-hysteria mode; more than a little grating! (Diane Lane was considered for this role, but she either turned it down, or was unavailable at the time.  It's kind of frustrating, thinking what a actress with Lane's skill could have done with the part.)  Benedict Taylor, as the potential love interest, is blondly dreamy (heh) in a 1970's teen-girl-magazine pin-up fashion.

But of course the real honours here go to Bette Davis, who puts all others in the shade. She doesn't have much to do in the film, but is effective in her few scenes. Just look at her in the last scene: with one look and three simple words (the last words spoken in the film) she shows just what a great actress is capable of ---I found this moment very moving. A critic at the time spoke of how she ""made bricks without straw,"" meaning of course she rose far above the material she was given. This was the last theatrical feature she made, before she had the stroke which so drastically altered her speaking voice and appearance.

So, the film has its problems, but I recommend it nonetheless, as a good spooky film for younger people. Heck, watching this at night, alone in a dark room, there are still moments that make me jump!

Reading the comments about this film on the Internet Movie Database was fun; the comment you hear over and over is ""This film scared the **** out of me when I was a kid!"" Ha! Several people, in fact, said that to this day they will not sleep in a room containing a mirror because this film scared them so much when they were young.

When looking for this film, definitely go for the Anchor Bay DVD release which contains supplemental material missing from the Disney release, including a commentary track from the director.",1288483200,5,4243,4.759183673469388

351887,5,6301708113,"I love Bette Davis. When I stumbled upon The Watcher in the Woods while searching for her classic titles on Amazon, I knew I had to see it. I was a kid when this flick hit movie theaters in 1981, but don't remember a thing about it - and my Mother doesn't remember it, either. We were stunned at just how good it is. Subtle, spooky, with great acting and fitting music, The Watcher in the Woods relies on plot to drive viewers to the end - not blood and gore.

The film is subtly suspenseful, but not suspenseful in the nail-biting sense many expect today. The movie is kid-friendly. You cannot miss a moment, otherwise you might miss an interesting or important detail in the ghostly hauntings of the English manor where a young girl disappeared years ago.

The DVD offers two alternate endings. It's a good thing Disney went with the ending it did.

They are interesting to watch, but definitely would have taken away from the subtle nuances of everything the director built throughout the first 80+ minutes.

The ending is awkward and a little anticlimactic, but mostly it's an enjoyable ride.

It's a good movie, but if you love it or hate it really boils down to your age (good for most kids), or if you are an adult it depends on whether you want to be amused...or genuinely scared.

351955,5,6301708113,"Honestly, even though I LOVED this movie as a 10-year-old kid -- it scared me to death, no joke!  So parents, don't underestimate this movie's powers to give your kids nightmares.  (Seriously, a trianglar crack in a mirror containing a blindfolded girl reaching out to you and mouthing ""HELP ME!"" is FREAKY, no matter what age you are.)

However, this is a great film for slightly more mature kids, as it really fires the imagination and will stick with them for years.  I will always love this movie, despite its early 1980's appearance, outdated special effects, and some of the more annoying moments of Johnson's (Jan's) whiny voice and overacting.  I still love it because the premise of the story is so fascinating, and there are moments and aspects of it that I STILL FIND SCARY!

For example (I won't give away too much, don't worry):

I love the eerie lullaby that Jan and Ellie hear in the woods, it's so whimsical and innocent-sounding that its juxtaposition with the frightening elements of the story is utterly creepy.  I love the way it gets played at the very end, it makes the movie end on a note of unease, despite the resolution -- and I really like that sense of the unsettled and unresolved at the end of this creeeepy story.  I don't want to see any other alternative ending!

I LOVE BETTE DAVIS in this role, she is such a leading lady, and her character is so haunting.  She perfectly conveys the loss and loneliness that an old widow would feel if her beloved daughter had mysteriously disappeared many years ago.  The part where she looks at the forest and says ""They're going to stay...is that what you wanted?"" gives me chills just thinking about it -- because it's at that point that you realize she KNOWS there is something out there in the woods, and she too is confused as to who or what it is, and perhaps even thinks it IS her daughter out there in spirit form.  (Jibblies!)

Jan looking in the large dresser mirror -- unable to see herself in it.  I always imagine myself in her shoes at that moment, and I think I would run screaming at what happens next, or at least think I was going absolutely crazy.  I love that moment.

Ellie writing backwards on the bathroom mirror in the dark, talking to herself.  Yeeeee.....

That strange, glowing blue triangle that appears at the foot of the stone coffin in the chapel... and especially the way it disappears with a wipe-motion is so creepy, creates such a great tension for when Jan approaches it.  Seeing Karen inside of the coffin still freaks/weirds me out.  And when I was a kid I was petrified!

And there are many more great scare-elements.  I highly recommend this film!  It's a classic with a one-of-a-kind paranormal plotline.",1219017600,4,2716,4.598752598752599

351958,3,6301708113,"Creepy, subtle horror/mystery by Disney was a good attempt to produce more mainstream movies (as opposed to strictly kids' fare) back in the early 80's.  Though, if you think about it, Disney was always pretty willing to include scary elements in both its animated and live-action movies, so this initiative really wasn't much of a stretch.  The great Bette Davis lends additional credibility to this modest but well-crafted film via her fairly small but nicely-performed role as the grieving mother of a long-lost child.  The DVD I saw included the two alternate endings described by other Amazon reviewers.  They're interesting to see, but the ending attached to the film- though it IS somewhat abrupt- is probably the best of all the conclusions.  The other endings spell out too specifically things (the nature of the Watcher, where he/she/it comes from, etc.) that are better left imagined or speculated about by the film's characters.",1200009600,2,940,5.157894736842105
351959,4,6301708113,"The Curtis family moves into a secluded English country house.  Strange things happen right away. Daughter Jan (Lynn-Holly Johnson) sees things.  When she touches glass it breaks into a triangle.  When she looks into an old dresser mirror, she cannot see her reflection.  When she touches it it cracks into a triangle.  And in the triangle she can see the reflection of a blindfolded girl.

That night she is awoken by her sister Ellie's sleeptalking.  But Ellie (Kyle Richards) tells Jan it was her that was talking.

The next day the girls are visiting a farm and Ellen in a trance writes NERAK on the barn window.  From the other side it reads Karen and Mrs. Fleming becomes disturbed by this.  Back at home, Ellie is drawn into the woods and Jan goes looking for her.  She finds Ellie by the pond.  The girls hear disembodied singing followed by a light flash and then a circle in the water.

Jan falls into the pond and gets trapped by a branch underwater.  Mrs. Aylwood (Bette Davis) rescues her.  Jan tells her of what is happening.  Mrs. Aylwood tells Jan about her daughter that disappeared 30 years ago.

The following day, the family goes to a motorcross race.  Ellie starts to scream for Jan to come to her.  Moments later a motorycle goes off track and lands on the rock that Jan was standing on.

The girls go horseback riding neighbor Mike (his mother was present whan Karen disappeared.)  Ellie's horse bolts and Mike goes after her.  Jan's horse gets spooked takes her to the chapel where Karen disappeared.  She sees a trianglular light on a coffin and then Karen's image in the coffin.  While there a sudden gust blows out a window and two circular panes of glass fall at her feet, one with a sunburst being covered by a dark piece of glass.

Next Jan is in a house of mirrors and suddenly every reflection is of the blindfolded Karen. Jan decides to find out what happened the night that Karen Aylwood disappeared.  John Keller tells her to leave it alone.  But Tom Colley tells her want happened.  That Karen during an initation the chapel was struck by lightning and caught on fire.  The three ran leaving the blindfolded Karen alone.  Tom turned around and saw the tower bell fall but Karen had already gone.

Mrs. Curtis (Carroll Baker) tries to take the girls away from the house but the woods stop them, setting up the rescue of Karen.

This was part of Disney studio trying to change its image from low budget family orient films to a more main stream films.  This film was left on the shelf for over a year before they reshot the end and released it.

This film is very interesting and despite some minor story flaws and rather rudimentary special effects (even for those days), this film is enjoyable for the entire family.

By the way Kyle Richards looks incredibly like her more famous sister Kim Richards.  And it is great seeing Carroll Baker working again.

DVD EXTRAS
Alternate Ending #1 (6:32) - this gives a form to the watcher - which looks like something from Alien.  In this one the special effects are more elaborate but there is something missing.

Aleternate Ending #2 (13:38) - this is an extended version of alternate ending #1.  The beginning is like the current ending but the last half is like ending two. But in each case extended.  This takes Jan to the alternate universe to save Karen.

I think that these two ending were too overly sci-fi and the current ending is simpler yet edgier.",1199923200,,3437,4.5763546798029555
351960,4,6301708113,"Back in the good ol' days of Disney before putrid sludge like High School Musical and Hannah Frickin' Montana, you got cool little movies like The Watcher In The Woods.  This was back when you could make a ""family"" horror film and have it work.  Watcher deals with a family moving into a nice new home near the woods.  Bette Davis, the previous owner of the house, still lives on the grounds and becomes interested in the older daughter, Jan, who reminds her of her daughter who had disappeared under bizarre circumstances in the woods many years ago.  Jan starts to notice bizarre goings on with the woods like flashing lights, eerie messages from her younger sister, and images of a blindfolded girl who seems to be begging for help.  This starts Jan on an investigation to find out what happened to this girl and how to help her, whether she's alive or dead.  This movie was quite good, and with alot of the plot points I can't help but think that recent movies like The Ring, Stir of Echoes, or any of the other billion movies that deal with a ghostly child, have in some part been influenced by this movie.  This manages a great sense of spookiness throughout with practically zero violence or death.  You're not gonna be lying trembling under a blanket with fear crying for mommy or anything, but to create spookiness with what is practically G-rated material is impressive.  Then in the last five minutes or so of the film, there's a big zinger thrown at you that shifts the entire plot.  This twist, which jumps right into sci-fi almost, may seem a bit corny, but you gotta admit it's original.  This forgotten classic from the Wonderful World of Disney is well worth checking out.  It's a helluva lot better than a That's So Raven marathon, that's for sure.",1198022400,2,1766,4.589171974522293
351961,5,6301708113,"I've loved this movie ever since I saw its first release back in the early 1980s! It is, to me, the perfect type of horror flick. It is genuinely creepy without the overdose of profanity, blood, guts and gore so typical of today's genre films. The creepy atmosphere of the film's location adds much to the suspense of the film. I would not spend one moment in the house in which they reside.

What I like about the film is the despair that Bette Davis' character feels after losing her daughter without a trace some 25 years earlier. This is not just a horror flick, but a mystery film as well; every moment Ms. Davis is on screen her sadness is conveyed with skill. I cannot imagine the pain of losing a child, but in this film's case she was not even afforded the simple knowledge of knowing what led to her daughter Karen's disappearance. Actually, I like all of the performances in this film, although I think a few of the scenes feel a bit forced.

Another aspect that is quite effective are the use of wide angle lens whenever the ""watcher"" is present. All in all, each of the film's elements including the sound and special effects add immensely to the creep-out factor of this movie. I noticed some of the other reviewers here feel the ending was a bit of a letdown. I totally disagree! The hairs on my arms stand up every time I see the film's climax. I actually get goosebumps watching the final moments.

This is the kind of horror film that I like best (much like George C. Scott's 'The Changeling,' also released around the same time). 'Watcher in the Woods' is creepy and scary, yet not to the point that I wouldn't be able to sleep afterwards. This may not sound like a compliment (but it is), this is a great (safe) horror flick!

351963,2,6301708113,"This Disney thriller is unique, in that it may be one of the earliest attempts from the studio to do straight horror. That the film is a compromise is probably as much due to the climate of the times as it is to their reluctance to be too intense and frightening. A good supporting cast is unfortunately subjugated to the pretty but unimpressive Lynn Holly Johnson, whose performance doesn't quite convey the desperation or depth that might have made the film more compelling. Bette Davis seems curiously restrained. The film might be a good companion piece to ""Burnt Offerings"" another Davis film in which a family comes across a mansion that's ""too good to be true"" for a summer rental. ""Watcher"" is infamous for its aborted first release, in which the film's finale was hastliy assembled. After negative reviews and some tampering, it was released again, but the damage had been done. This DVD version includes all three (!) endings to the movie, and this may be its biggest value for fans. The print is clean and the image sharp. I am guessing by all the positive reviews posted here that ""Watcher in the Woods"" was a sleepover favorite for young girls, and it still might serve that function, in that it's a spooky movie without much to offend younger viewers.

It's too bad that nobody could decide precisely how to end this film, because up to there it's a very nice atmospheric suspense/mild horror film, very much in the grand Hammer tradition.  Quite a departure for Disney at the time.

Lynn Holly Johnson (who made about three films, playing an ice skater in two of them - wow what a stretch) is fine, and the rest of the cast are more than adequate, particularly the great Bette Davis as a Scary Old Lady With A Secret.*

Well worth while, though none of the alternate endings actually work perfectly; the book's ending was a little tricky to translate to visuals, apparently.

*One touch i greatly appreciated when first i saw the film was that, for the flashback, they didn't try to find an 18-year-old who looked like the young Bette [or use make-up to make a young actress look like her], but rather they seem to have found someone who, years later might well look like Davis in her later years.

351994,4,6301708113,"As a major lover of all things eighties, I was shocked when I recently heard of this movie in comparison with ""Escape To Witch Mountain,"" one movie which I'd seen as a child and was wanting to see again now, as an adult. But I'd never even HEARD of ""The Watcher In The Woods,"" so after seeing the many glowing reviews, I was determined to download it and see it as soon as humanly possible.

I just finished watching this excellently crafted movie from 1980 and must say, it REALLY stands the test of time. Though it actually feels set in the mid-Seventies (probably was filmed around 1978, which fits), it really holds up incredibly well close to thirty years later. It started off feeling quite a bit like a horror film, then started moving into territory closer to that of the recent gem ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" introducing a decidedly magical element that really got under my skin, and stayed there for the remainder of the movie.

I totally agree with another person's review stating that Disney really doesn't make films like this anymore. It's a shame, too, because they SHOULD. The way the world is these days, a little magic and spiritual feel injected into their movies could really help things and bring back some of the long-lost feeling of beauty and wonder in our lives. Though I never managed to see this film as a child, I can't help but imagine what a major influence this would've been on me if I HAD seen it back then. It's really a great movie, and it's only a shame that Disney has wandered so far away from their original path of actively and passionately exploring our imaginations.

Fortunately we still have plenty of creative geniuses out there like Guillermo del Toro, Terry Gilliam, Darren Aronofsky and others who determinedly follow their hearts and continue to create stunningly passionate visions that simply and powerfully resonate within our souls. ""The Watcher In The Woods"" is one such vision, and although I wouldn't go so far as to call it a MASTERPIECE, it's definitely a great piece of movie-making history, and one which I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to any fans of dark fantasy or magical fiction.

351997,5,6301708113,"John Hough of the ""Witch Mountain"" movies directs the other Richards sister, Kyle, in this short but suspenseful 1 hr 22 minute movie.  For a Disney flick, there are a couple of ""jump out of your seat"" moments.

Bette Davis is formidable as usual and Lynn-Holly Johnson does a great job, but it's Kyle Richards who essentially steals the show, sublimely transitioning from innocent little sister to taking on another voice.  If you notice the timing of the movie, it came out shortly after the Exorcist and the Shining.  Therefore, there are few elements in Watcher in the Woods that pays a bit of homage to these flicks like writing backwards on mirrors.  Of course, Hough had to keep the spook factor to a family-friendly minimum. Other highlights of this movie, is the camera angle used to enhance the effect of the main characters being ""watched"".

This is, by far, Disney's edgiest film. Yet, it's still clean enough to be family entertainment.  Unlike the ""Witch Mountain"" films, ""Watcher"" has few special effects but are nonethelesss key to the story and the suspense.

The DVD doesn't offer any behind-the-scenes commentaries, but it does offer two alternate endings which are not too different from each other. They are somewhat hokey and seem to take away from the suspenseful and mysterious tone of the film.  The ending that was chosen for the film is much better suited: simple, surprising and very effective.

Just what does this loving family have in store for them this summer?

One of Disney's first non-G-rated productions is rather enjoyable, if not rather hokey.

352034,4,6301708113,"""The Watcher in the Woods"" is a first rate suspense movie that can also be enjoyed by young viewers, thanks to the film's creators at Disney.  Lynn Holly Johnson teams up with Kyle Richards (Kim Richards' real life sister)  as sisters that move into an English mansion with their parents for the summer.  Strange things begin to happen, even on the day that they're moving in.  Lynn is determined to unravel the mystery that is beginning to haunt her and Kyle.  Bette Davis co-stars as a mysterious elderly lady that lives in the guesthouse of the estate, and Lynn soon discovers that all of the supernatural phenomenon that's been occurring surrounds the disappearance of Davis' long lost daughter.  The dvd has a nice clean transfer and great audio.  Special features include the film's original trailer and a nice addition of alternate endings to the film.  Also of special merit, is the co-starring of Carroll Baker (Baby Doll, Giant, The Carpetbaggers) as Lynn and Kyle's mother.  I highly recommend ""The Watcher in the Woods"" to fans of suspense and the supernatural, and especially to Disney live-action film enthusiasts.

352039,4,6301708113,"Based on the novel by Florence Engel Randall, THE WATCHER IN THE WOODS is a finely-crafted Disney thriller with Bette Davis and a great cast.

The story is about an English-American family (David McCallum, Carroll Baker, Lynn-Holly Johnson and Kyle Richards) who move into a creepy mansion in the English countryside.  The estate also includes Mrs Aylwood (Bette Davis) who acts as a caretaker of sorts.  Mrs Aylwood's daughter Karen mysteriously died in a fire many years ago and she has never really come to terms with her grief.

Once the new family moves in, strange things begin to occur.  Eldest daughter Jan (Lynn-Holly Johnson - ICE CASTLES) senses something watching her, and starts seeing a blindfolded girl in mirrors.  Younger daughter Ellie (Kyle Richards) adopts a little dog and calls it 'Nerak' ('Karen' spelled backwards).  Everything that happens seems to lead back to Karen Aylwood and her mysterious death.  Jan and Ellie join Mrs Aylwood in a race against time to stop the hauntings and hopefully find out what really happened that fateful night...

Bette Davis gives a mesmerizing performance as Mrs Aylwood (with Georgina Hale also fine as the younger Davis during the flashback sequence).  David McCallum sadly doesn't get much to do as the father, though Carroll Baker impresses in her relatively-small role as the mother.  Lynn-Holly Johnson (following her breakout role as Lexie in ICE CASTLES) is a knockout as Jan and Kyle Richards is just plain spooky as Ellie.

Filmed entirely on location in England, the tense and eerie atmosphere is perfectly carried throughout the whole movie.  Also featuring Eleanor Summerfield, Ian Bannen, Richard Pasco, Frances Cuka, Benedict Taylor and Katherine Levy.",1110758400,31,1726,5.187725631768953

My friend and I wouldn't go into the woods even during the day, in a group. I still won't go into amusement houses.",1100908800,2,707,4.404580152671755
352101,4,6301708113,"It seems unlikely that ""Watcher in the Woods"" would be made for theatrical release today.  While the movie may be frightening for younger audiences, it is but spooky for older audiences and the ending has a little bit of weakness, even with the re-vamping indicated by the alternative endings provided on the DVD.

Lynn-Holly Johnson, whose most notable roles were in ""Ice Castles"" with Robbie Benson and the Bond film ""For Your Eyes Only,"" little sister Kyle Richards and their family move to a beautiful English country home when their father, played by David McCallum of ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" and ""The Invisible Man"" television series fame, is transferred to England.  The family soon encounters ever-eerie Bette Davis as an appropriately scary old lady who does little speaking but looks at the new family intently (and an intent look from Bette Davis in her latter years was always scary).  It takes a while for Lynn-Holly Johnson to learn why Davis, playing Mrs. Aylwood, looks at her so intently.

It takes very little time for strange things to start happening to little sister Kyle Richards, who was also on the television series ""Little House on the Prairie.""  Kyle writes ""Nerak"" on a window and names her dog the same, not realizing that Nerak has a very special meaning to Mrs. Aylwood.  Kyle writes on mirrors and says strange things.  Lynn-Holly Johnson hears strange voices and has visual hallucinations, which are also eerie and just shy of being scary.

The suspense in this movie is increased slowly but steadily to the climax, when we learn the secret of three people who met in an abandoned church many years earlier, and even then we wonder at the plot twist Disney put into the end of the picture.

The pre-digital age special effects are seamless and effective.  This movie maximized the use of minimal special effects to create a movie that is just shy of being scary for adult audiences, but is eerie and spooky to the end.  There are a couple of moments when I was concerned that Lynn-Holly Johnson might be harmed when I was still unsure of whether the ghost or whatever it was evil.  The ""possessions"" of younger sister Kyle Richards were even spookier, especially because she seemed to be unaware of each time she did something under the control of the other being.  The most effective and perhaps one of the weirdest moments in the movie is when Kyle is speaking under the control of something when she enters the church near the end of the movie.  The style of her speaking is effective and is probably one of the high points of the movie.

Included on this DVD are two alternate endings.  One is a bit more than 13 minutes long and the other is just over 6 minutes long.  Watch the long alternate ending, then the shorter one, and then that used in the movie, and you can see the logic the producer used in modifying the ending.

In the original ending the plot has an interesting creature that distracts rather than enhances the plot.  There are more details added in regarding this being that change the tenor of the movie in a much less effective manner than the final version.  The shorter version retained a portion of the much longer version, but again the ending distracts rather than enhances the movie.  The final version where the unknown is used to the point where the nature of Kyle's possession is revealed is the most effective version.  One other problem with both the alternate endings is Bette Davis's over-the-top acting, which caused a lot of laughs.  The final version was more effective.

This movie pushes the envelope of what it means to be a Disney made movie, which are stereotypically family oriented.  Later Disney created other studios to produce films that were unsuitable for all or most family members and resolved the problem of how to make more intense movies.  However, this movie is suitable for most children above the age of 8 or 9 and for some more mature younger children.  There are few moments of any real danger, but those few moments and the overall eerie feeling of the movie can cause nightmares for some children.

The DVD also includes trailers, and there appeared to me to be at least a portion of the movie that did not make the final version in at least one of the trailers.

While this movie has some weak points, the overall style is like that of the short-live television series ""American Gothic,"" though much less violent and bloody, and fans of that style or those looking for a relatively family friendly ghost story will find this movie to be worth watching and owning.",1100822400,7,4563,4.710327455919395

You start out with a ghost story and you end up with ""What the f""k?""  I was okay with about an hour and ten minutes of this movie.  It was the last ten minutes that i cant accept.

Basic setup, a family moves into an old house or manor, whatever youd like to call the large thing.  The two daughters begin to tap into the spirits around the place.  The oldest daughter seeing images of the girl who was lost long ago while the younger daughter gets used as a channeling board for the spirits.

A good mystery is developed, only to fall apart in the end.  I felt mind raped straight through my ear.  I kept coming up with possibilities for what it might be and what it was i never would have guessed, mainly because i wasn't pitching from the parking lot.  The idea the story ended with wasn't even on the movies playing field.

The directors commentary offered no insight into this.  All he did was tell how a shot was done, tell you what was going on in a scene (which you could tell by WATCHING the damn thing!), or bitch about his ending being better than the one they went with.  The dvd i had had ""two"" alternate endings on it but they were pretty much the same thing.  ###And for some reason the actress they had playing the grown up little girl looked like a man in a wig???###

I realized later that this movie was based off of a book, which i suppose lets the director off the hook for not telling me why the ending of the movie was so different.  Perhaps the book did a better job at transitioning the reader from one aspect of the story to the next because this movie just throws it at you and expects you to catch it, even if you don't have any hands.

This entire paragraph is a ### so you might wanna skip it.  The idea behind Karens dissapearance is that these young people, playing what i assumed was a prank because they were initiating her into their group, was actually some kind of witchcraft...somehow.  The youngest girl comes in at the end, possesed by The Watcher.  Turns out Karen was sucked into an alternate dimension and switched places with this Watcher, whatever it is.  Oh wait, its some kind of alien!  The deleted endings show this creature which is quite menacing.  Its just the idea of this character, after expecting a ghost story and getting an alien, that i have a problem with.  The alternate endings also try to explain what happened to Karen, adding in things about negative energies and whatnot which really only make the idea more retarded. Explaining the specifics breifly (as the possessed little girl does) was the best route. I thought perhaps whoever wrote the book had an episode of Star Trek on in the background when writing this ending and decided that was a cool idea to go with.###

For the most part i have no problem referring this movie.  Just know that the payoff in the end leaves quite a bit to be desired.  Oh and some of the acting is horrible.  I swear the one guy had to be drunk the whole time they were shooting this movie!",1100649600,3,2995,4.339928057553957

When a family of four move into a spooky new home owned by none other than Betty Davis strange things begin to happen to the two children both teenage girls.
Of course being that this is a Disney film of an era when kids no matter how scared out of their wits they were had a tendency to investigate and solve capers and strange occurences start snooping about while the local residents appear ominous and cryptic yet reluctant in the end to deny said girls any and all info needed to aid them in their quest for the truth.
So the teenage girls the eldest of the two being a wholesome beauty with feathered blonde hair overact and mug and of course try to figure how just who or what The Watcher In The Wood is and if Davis' daughter 30 years missing have anything to do with one another.

A bad joke?  Yes it was, but I was stumped for a way to start my review, and inspiration seems to have failed me yet again...The Watcher in the Woods (1981), released by Disney, directed by Englishman John Hough, who also did Escape to Witch Mountain (1975) Return from Witch Mountain (1978), and a couple of episodes for television program Hammer House of Mystery, stars Bette Davis, Lynn-Holly Johnson, who also appeared in films like Ice Castles (1978) and the James Bond film For Your Eyes Only (1981) (the early 80's were pretty good for Johnson, but her career has since taken a detour in the land of the B movies), and Kyle Richards, who started out on the television show Little House on the Prairie, but then moved to major horror features appearing in The Car aka Deathmobile, John Carpenter's Halloween, and its' sequel Halloween II.  Also appearing are Carroll Baker (Baba Yaga) and David McCallum, probably most known as secret agent Illya Kuryakin from the popular 60's television series The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

The film begins with an American family, recently re-located to England, looking for a home.  McCallum plays the father, Baker the mother, and Johnson and Richards as the two daughters.  They find a real deal in an old English manor, owned by a peculiar old woman named Mrs. Alywood (Davis), who happens to live in a smaller house on the property, and is very particular about who rents the larger house, but, on meeting Jan (Johnson), and her younger sister Ellie (Richards), she agrees to allow the family to rent the place.  Even before the family moves in, Jan has uneasy feelings about the place, almost like she's being watched (hence the title), and soon afterwards, begins experiencing strange and odd visions, visions regarding Mrs. Alywood's long, lost daughter, missing now for some 30 years.  As the visions progress to other, more intense supernatural phenomena, Jan feels compelled to learn the true nature of what's happening to her and her sister, and also to learn the truth about Mrs. Alywood's missing daughter.  What terrible secrets does she uncover?  Who is the watcher in the woods?  Why's that Mrs. Alywood so very creepy?  Answers to these questions and more are forthcoming, if you care to watch...(who watches the watcher?  I did, and it was pretty good...)

When I purchased this film, I didn't know it was a Disney release.  As another reviewer already stated, Disney had an odd period there for awhile, releasing films that didn't necessarily seem very Disney-like, like this film.  I actually liked the movie a lot, as it was very suspenseful and I honestly could not figure out the ending until it was revealed.  I will admit I found myself somewhat attracted to Johnson, and it felt odd as she seemed to be presented as someone in her teens, but in reality, she was in her early 20's at the time this was filmed, so I felt a lot less creepy.  I did think she seemed a bit too old for her part, and after checking on her age, my feelings were confirmed.  All the actors did very well, and given their collected past acting experiences, I wasn't surprised.  Whoever casted this film did very well, choosing highly capable and experienced actors.  Johnson's character did become a bit of a pest as the film worn on, especially as she tries to uncover the dark secrets that now seem to plague her and her sister in visions and the odd possession or two.  Davis' character seemed a bit weak and two dimensional, but one is willing to cut the woman some slack, given her body of work, and those very creepy eyes.  The sets and location shots all added a great deal to the story, providing a wonderful backdrop to the story.  I did find it kind of annoying when Johnson's character kept looking out various windows, as if she could see whatever strange force keeps causing the wee hairs on the back of her neck to stand up...The script was very well done, and tended to focus on the important elements, keeping the viewer in the thick of things.  The plot moved along very slowly, almost excruciatingly so, but it did allow for the viewer to ponder and develop their own theories, which will most likely be wrong, as I was...the ending in this film was so very oddly fantastic I doubt I would have ever figured it out on my own.  Some may have already given it away in reviews here, which is too bad, as it's pretty mind-boggling.  It really seemed to come from nowhere, but did provide a satisfactory, if highly unusual conclusion.

The wide screen print here is very clear and sharp, along with the audio, although the DTS track on the earlier Anchor Bay release (now out of print) is missing here.  There are a few extras on this official Walt Disney Home Video release (although less than there were on the pervious Anchor Bay release), including two alternate endings well worth checking out, and two trailers.  After watching the alternate endings, I would think they weren't used maybe because they would have been too frightening to younger viewers, or too goofy for older viewers.  The ending used in the final product, compared to the alternates, seems the best route to have been taken.  Overall, this is a very good thriller, one that forsakes visceral elements for story and genuine suspense.  It moves a bit slow, but does reward at the end.  It is a Disney film, but probably not one for very young viewers, as it could cause nightmares and the subsequent staining of the sheets.

352107,4,6301708113,"If you've looked at my reviews, you know that I have an affection for Rod Serling. Most of my favorite films are Twilight Zone types of stories and this one is no exception.
Disney has fluctuated between outstanding animated features and some very good live-action films. At one point, the studio lost some of its direction (after Walt died, by the way), and the animation became less than perfect, the live-action films strayed from being family classics (in the sense of Swiss Family Robinson, Old Yeller, etc.) and called up a darker side of the studio. This story, along with Black Hole, Something Wicked This Way Comes, and Child of Glass, is of that era, or should I say, flavor. All four films are not your standard Disney fare. Of them, only Child of Glass remains in the vault, possibly because it was made for television, rather than for the theater. It is well worth looking for and hopefully the studio will release it some day in the future.
Back to the present. This one is due for rerelease in August, 2004. I have it on DVD and as a one-time video store employee, I would recommend it for someone who wanted to see something different in the way of suspense and horror. And, like the good suspense film it is, it does not resort to violence, but a collection of oddities which seem more surreal and strange than supernatural.
Ironically, the original release (and the Anchor Bay DVD has all the alternate endings and other goodies - I can't speak to the new release) has one of the strangest twists at the end that one can imagine. Thank you Disney for doing it this way, instead one of the alternatives, for it truly remains the best approach, even if the FX needed to pull off the other approaches had been available and perfected. This is the best and it turns out to be something different!
Science Fiction.
Huh?
Yes. The ending is purely science fiction in nature and scope. Something that you wouldn't expect given the gothic setting of the story and yet, that is exactly what it is. I won't reveal how, but not one customer came back and disagreed with me after watching the film.
A note on my rating. Normally, I would have given this five stars, but after watching this a couple of times, I found Holly's voice to wear thin and grate on my nerves. As the story progresses, her voice correctly shows the tension that she is developing as the mystery deepens. It reaches a shrillness that is seldome used as she approaches her own breaking point. Unfortunately, the increasing shrillness works only with the alternate endings. With repeated watchings (it isn't noticeable in the first watching) it fails to work well with the selected ending, even though the ending was the best choice as I mentioned earlier. It is unfortunate that the studio didn't go back and remix her voice to correct the problem, but they were running out of time once the producers realized they couldn't pull off the original ending. As I mentioned, you probably won't notice the problem on your first, or even second watching, but it is there.
One final word. Even on the third and forth watchings, I still tended to jump out of surprise... and that's something that's a rarity.",1077235200,3,3177,4.634751773049645

It may look cheesy by todays standards, but they don't make movies like this anymore. An old fashioned ghost story without gore and violence. Just good creepy fun.",1061251200,3,430,4.130952380952381
352150,2,6301708113,"Initially planned for a 1980 opening, The Watcher in the Woods was released for a few screenings and it was not well received. The ending in particular earned a lot of criticisms, so producers stuck the movie on a shelf and went about reshooting a few alternative conclusions. Regardless of these changes, audiences and critics did not embrace the movie and it died a quick box-office death. It wasn't until several years later - when the film hit home video - that more fans began to crop up, most of them citing fond childhood memories of a creepy flick. The controversy surrounding the film's difficult birth only added fuel to the fanbase fire, which is just one of the reasons that this Anchor Bay DVD is a long overdue sight for the hardcore fans. The plot is a family-friendly pastiche of nighttime creaks, forest-bound shivers, past-life problems, and ghostly messages. Hollywood legend Bette Davis plays Mrs. Aylwood, a kindly-yet-creepy old lady who rents her massive estate to a friendly American family. The Watcher in the Woods is an intermittently creepy and quite well photographed piece of ""gothic lite"", but newcomers to this movie may struggle through the movie's numerous slow spots and ponderous pacing. The screenplay (based on the novel by Florence Engel Randall) sets up a few provocative ideas, but they're rarely followed up in satisfying style. Most of the acting performances are essentially wooden, with Ms. Davis turning in a glorified cameo that doesn't leave much of an impression. On the whole, The Watcher in the Woods isn't a really bad movie; it's just a bit too safe and more than a little drab. Fans of old-fashioned, atmospheric ghost tales will undoubtedly forgive the film's obvious faults more than others might, but even they will have a hard time generating much enthusiasm for the movie. To call this ""the scariest movie ever made"" is a flat out lie. I mean you're more likely to laugh at it that get scared in it. I really wanted this to be scary, but I was very dissappointed. Haven't been this dissappointed since When A Stranger Calls. See it if you want, but don't expect anything like The Exorcist or The Shining. Watch it alone in the dark. May be it'll scare you.",1056585600,6,2215,4.816272965879265

352154,3,6301708113,"In the late 1970s the Walt Disney Studios was a kingdom of make believe perilously perched on the verge of extinction, thanks in part to changing audience tastes and, to a series of high profile big budget flops. While some of these, like ""Pete's Dragon"" have since been given their reprieve on home video, the proliferation of others to the home market, ""The Watcher In The Woods"" being a prime example, seems only to heighten the overwhelming loss of artistic sensibility that plagued decision making at the studio during its dark and gloomy transition period. Worried that the market for family film fare had been irreversibly eroded with the proliferation of more gritty adult flicks, Uncle Walt's heirs dove head first into more mature story telling - effectively alienating both its remaining loyalists and the conventional film attendee who had outgrown Mickey Mouse.
""The Watcher In The Woods"" is a ghost story that begins in earnest with the greatest potential. It stars Bette Davis as Mrs. Aylwood, a reclusive landlord of an old English estate rented to the Curtis family: mom, Helen (Carroll Baker), dad, Paul (Peter McCallum) and their two daughters, Jan (Lynn-Holly Johnson) and Ellie (Kyle Richards). From the start Jan is in tune with some strange psychic forces haunting the house. She notices that a mirror above one of the fireplaces gives off no reflections of people and sometime provides a strange porthole image of a young girl who is blindfolded and reaching out for help. Jan also begins to suspect that some of the town's folk know exactly what's going on at their secluded country estate. Through a bit of her own investigating Jan learns that many years before Mrs. Aylwood's daughter disappeared without a trace from an abandoned church after three of her friends performed a paranormal sacrifice.
In an off beat attempt to recapture some of the magic of earlier Disney-fied mystery flicks like ""Candleshoe,"" ""Watcher"" cannot make up its mind whether it wants to be an adult horror flick or a ""Freaky Friday"" comedic knock off with a feel good ending. There is something cinematically insincere about the way in which the film introduces Peter McCallum's character, Paul and then quickly jettisons him from the plot. Ultimately the focus shifts from family to daughters, Jan and Ellie.  To be certain there are disturbing vignettes and more than one good scare buried under the rubble of this lost opportunity. A perfect example occurs when Jan and Ellie wander off into the woods and stumble onto a gnarled tree stretching over a tiny pond. Ellie climbs one of the tree branches and accidentally falls into the water where she becomes trapped in a mirrored parallel universe. Frantically, Jan uses a broken tree branch to free and restore her sister to safety but not before the mirror produces a glimpse of the blindfolded girl, reflecting back at her with a look of desperation about her silenced lips.
The primary problem with ""Watcher"" is that it stumbles upon its frightening moments almost by accident and then does not know how to either successfully link the moments into one cohesive narrative or bring about a logical ending to the whole darn mess. In 1980, with a rush release date pushing the production onward to completion, director, Richard Hough slapped together some sort of ending in which an alien creature has been keeping Mrs. Aylwood's daughter a captive in a computer generated alter-universe ever since the ritual sacrifice. Reportedly laughed off the screen at a New York premiere, Hough cut together a version in which Jan is sucked into a vortex. She rescues the girl from her prism prison by doing battle with something in the vane of a Jim Henson puppet back lit by phosphorus effects as the creature responsible for the girl's disappearance. Ultimately, only Jan and a truncated version of the vortex finale eventually was released to the general public with the return of Aylwood's daughter surfacing as something of a tacky, tactless tack-on that betrayed both the gothic mystery of the rest of the film and the Disney legacy for crafting vintage family entertainment. The film was a box office bomb in 1981 but ironically has resurfaces as something of a cult classic.
Disney DVD gives us an identical anamorphic widescreen DVD transfer to the one previously made available from Anchor Bay. Though the main title sequence is riddled with age related artifacts and dirt and scratches, once the film begins the overall picture quality is fairly pleasing and easy on the eyes. The use of soft filters renders many scenes a hazy fuzzy mess of warm colors but this is not the fault of DVD mastering efforts. Colors are overall rich and vibrant, though some slight smearing is present during night scenes. The effects photography does not hold up well under this sort of pristine digital scrutiny, appearing very one dimensional and almost pasted on as an afterthought. Contrast levels are overall quite good though blacks are rarely solid or deep. There's minor edge enhancement present also as well as some heavy pixelization in various scenes. The audio has been cleaned up and is presented at a reasonable listening level. It is dated but adequate. Extras include an audio commentary in which director, Hough laments being rushed to finish the picture, two alternative endings, a theatrical trailer and some stills. Bottom line is, if you're looking for the usual Disney perfection working overtime, look elsewhere.",1047859200,,5476,5.010976948408342
352155,3,6301708113,"I first saw this movie on VHS in the early 80's and it scared me to pieces!  I remember dreaming about it and playing that i was in the movie for months and months afterwards.  For years my sister and I would refrence it when scary things happened.  So, needless to say, I was excited to find it was on DVD (and with all the bonus material) that I scooped it up right away.
My first reaction was that ""gee, it's not nearly as scary as I remember"".  Still it's a creepy film that will surely creep out kids and early tweens.  Sure the acting isn't that great, some of the effects are cheesy and the story doesn't always add up, but the creepy mood sells it and I found myself still jumping and getting as tense as I did as a child.
The commentary is pretty boring and adds little to your understanding or appreciation fo the film.  The alternate endings are quite dumb and I'm glad they were never used, still I'm to have the chance to view them and see  how the filmakers designed the story.  But Im most excited to finally see the movie in widescreen.
WATCHER isn't the stongest film but it's style and mood of uneasiness will get to you.  This is a perfect film to get if you remember it when it first came out or for Disneypiles as this is an important stepping stone for the company.",1045180800,11,1287,4.220408163265306

Anchor Bay has done a really great job on this disc. The widescreen print looks fantastic and the remastered dts/thx likely sounds better than when the film was released in '81. Several trailers are featured on the disc, and I have to say that they nicely put together, they're far creepier than the movie itself. There is a feature length commentary by director John Hough which is self serving at best. He spends the majority of the movie talking about himself, his career, and what Watcher meant to him. Who cares?! When I listen to commentary I want to hear stories from the set, about working with the actors, about the script/story development. Sadly, that's missing from this disc. The crowning glory of the dvd is the chance to finally see the original ending. All I have to say is, they changed it for good reason. The original ending features a giant alien puppet that takes Jan away to an ""otherworld"" where she rescues Karen. The special effects are mind-bogglingly bad. The reshot ""ball of light"" ending makes far more sense.

352236,2,6301708113,"I dunno--this movie just didn't do a thing for me!  ""Watcher in the Woods"" was made at a time when the Disney Corporation was trying to break into the adult market. They produced a number of disjointed, unsatisfying films: ""Tron;"" ""Something Wicked This Way Comes;"" ""Tex;"" ""The Black Hole;"" and ""Watcher,"" among them. They were really trying to find their way and eventually hit paydirt with ""Splash."" Alas, ""Watcher"" is much ado about nothing. The great Bette Davis is completely wasted in a thankless role. Basically, it's a hoary old plot about ""something in the woods"" that, uh, ""watches."" Oh, and it also likes to follow you around while you're biking.  Is it a ghost? A monster? Answering that question would give away the ending, which (according to lore) was reshot twice. This is definitely After School special stuff--replete with zooms, horrid acting by ""typical"" kid stars, cheesy special effects, and flacid attempts at shock (a screeching cat, snarling dog, little girls talking in someone else's voice, yada-yada). You've heard and seen it all before. Scary? Nope! Dull?  Yep!  This is surprising, since ""Watcher in the Woods"" was directed by John Hough, who also helmed the terrifically spooky ""Legend of Hell House."" ""Watcher"" has a nice video transfer and received the deluxe treatment from Anchor Bay.
