8494789,5,B0068JFC8W,"My parent's really enjoyed ""Bavaria: World Odysseys Series"" and learning a deeper history of King Ludwig II of Bavaria. My mother is Bavarian. She loves the Neuschwanstein Castle as much as I do. My dad reminded me of the beer stein that I gave him of the Neuschwanstein Castle. And, of course, he drank out it during the show!

This is what my parent's had to say about it, ""We just finished watching this beautiful tape. It's so gorgeous! Pretty soon we won't fit any more tapes in the cabinet. And this one tops them all!""

She continued with, ""Oh my god, it's a shame that we never saw the Neuschwanstein Castle. We were so close. We just never had the means. I cannot believe they declared Ludwig insane. It appears like someone killed him. He spent all his family fortune on the castle, but look at all the generations who enjoyed it  1,200 people a day! The family must have been really rich!""

My mom finished with these words: ""I just can't get over that they claimed Ludwig was insane, but he never made any wars. No, not this king! This king just built beautiful castles. Made gorgeous art. He didn't want power  just beauty. Unbelievable, so much splendor ... Must have cost a fortune! All that gold ... Beautiful!""

My dad agreed with my mom that it was one of their favorite DVDs so far. And, also, felt what a shame it was that they never saw the Neuschwanstein Castle when in Germany. [My dad worked at Siemens there, after the Army. In the 1960's, he made 125 marks a week  making motors for vacuum cleaners. And my mother took time off from her work in a factory when a second child was born.] They had no time and money to go with starting a family. And now, they feel they are too old.

So, the video did make them very happy. They felt like they were there, living the fairytale, well just for the hour. But they enjoyed it a lot. And that's all I can say. Hope you enjoy it, too!",1520035200,,1901,4.335211267605634
