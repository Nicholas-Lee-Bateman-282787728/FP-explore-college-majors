7923457,1,B00004U0ZE,I agree with the one star review below that this video does not offer much more beyond what you can find on the Internet.,1368144000,,121,4.083333333333333
7923458,1,B00004U0ZE,"This video is billed as a how-to, when in fact you can learn MUCH more by reading on the internet. While billed as a demonstration of techniques, they SHOW very little - the two people who star in this videotape must really have loved getting their 15 minutes of fame, because much the largest part of the program is them TALKING about what they did, with intermittent (and not very informative) glimpses of the actual work. Boring discourse and very little useful demonstration of techniques. Charging $45 for this talkfest is a JOKE!",1194739200,2,535,4.763440860215054
7923459,5,B00004U0ZE,"This video was a great primer for anyone who is interested in learning vacuum bagging techniques or how composite structures are built.  While the video suggests advanced audiences, I think it is also appropriate for intermediates and even newbies to composite structure construction.  The video does a pretty good job of laying out a repeatable process as well as showing via the video how to follow these steps.  While some ""how to"" video's move at a snail's pace, this one moves along more briskly but shows just enough that you should be able to get the hang of things and repeate the process.  While some previous work with composites are certainly a plus when watching this video, I think this video could easily be used by new comers without too much trouble.  The finished composite structure that is built from this video is beautiful and inspiring to those hoping to construct their own homebuilt creations.  Kudo's too for building a video on a set of techniques are often thought to be ""beyond the reach of home builders"".  This video brings home the attainability of this technology.  I think the video actually could have benefited from being a bit more technical to help more advanced audiences (for example they don't give detailed specifics on the vacuum pressure or equipment used) but other than that it's a great video.
