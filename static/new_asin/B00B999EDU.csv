8564595,1,B00B999EDU,"Update: Okay so I just got an exchange for the same DVD because the first was scratched badly. So I just received it and once again the dvd wasn't in the case and it has scratches as well. I'm very disappointed with this service. I always order from amazon and this is the first time this happened. Amazon you're slacking. Obviously someone needs to be fired for screwing up so much.

Original review: I ordered this DVD and it came scratched.
Not just little but alot and it won't even play without skipping. Before I opened it the disk was shaking freely in the case not even inside right. My baby was excited to watch this. He loves babytv and this is hard to buy anywhere.  Very disappointing.",1452470400,,697,4.4375
