5966983,5,B00F3TD9GA,"The poster and trailer may sound  like a horror film but It is a decent suspense/mystery thriller. Tried an entirely different NON-LINEAR story telling approach which some people felt as a bad editing. But actually please pay special attention to Restaurant scene where Joe chases Rachel inside and Paul's house..To make a long story short, Rachel recalls every night what happened that day, rewinding the same events but she sees a new picture of the same event. It is some what mind challenging for the people who get used to the sequential movies like point a to b to c. This is a different approach. If you like Momento, Jacob Ladder type film, you will love it.....this movie changed my life",1386720000,4,696,4.75206611570248
5966984,2,B00F3TD9GA,"When I watch a movie for review, I usually categorize it in one of several ways.  For example, there are some movies that blow me away; they are well made, the acting is good, and the story is excellent.  There are also films that are mediocre overall but still good because the production was top notch or the story was original.  Then there are films that are so bad, they're good.  And finally, there are those movies that just outright suck, usually because there is no continuity to the story or even no story at all.

Im not sure where to classify THE SECRET VILLAGE.  It is not a good movie at all, however it does not even really qualify as a so bad its good sort of film.  I guess I should just call it a dud all the way across the board.

It pains me to say this movie is a miss.  I really wanted to like it.  The plot synopsis makes it sound dark and sinister...but unfortunately, the film is neither.  The result is a bland, lifeless production that looks like it came from a high school AV class.

THE SECRET VILLAGE is shot ok, although there are barely any moving camera shots, and the stationary scenes begin to drag on after a while.  The production value looks very low, and while Im sympathetic to low-budget films, this didn't feel like even that for some reason.  The whole film just felt...odd.

The acting is almost nonexistent, with the actors portrayals coming across as cardboard caricatures.  Theres no real reason to be vested in them at all, which makes the plight that Rachel endures ho-hum and not intense in the least.  And speaking of tension in the film, there is none.  I literally fell asleep twice during the film and had to rewind it to catch what I missed...which was, well, nothing.

The story of THE SECRET VILLAGE is a convoluted mess that flips back and forth between the past and present with no rhyme or reason.  Whereas some might call this art, I call it confusing and boring.  There are elements never used or even explained in the film (like all the people in black robes that are never explained or fleshed out), and the big twist at the end of the film is almost a cop-out.

The promo for THE SECRET VILLAGE says it is inspired by real-life events, but I couldn't imagine what the basis for this film was.  I would daresay that is just a marketing ploy, however I cannot confirm that.  In my opinion, this film is one secret that should be kept and never shared with the rest of the world.

The film is available next week if you want to check it out.",1386720000,9,2502,4.363636363636363
5966985,2,B00F3TD9GA,"Rachel (Ali Faulkner) is a reporter who is investigating the weird events at a small village in Massachusetts. In 1666 a slave was convicted of killing someone through witchcraft. Since that time numerous rye ergot outbreaks has caused people to hallucinate followed by mass deaths. The quiet town likes to remain isolated. We see numerous people walking around in black robes with candles and a ghost having a bad hair day while they play a lame soundtrack. This would indicate something else is going on besides simple ergot poisoning.

The production had all the elements of a mystery/thriller. The acting was fair, the dialog boring, and it had a twist, a twist that was my second choice. The horror aspect was minimal. We see dead bodies, a person hanging, but no one being killed or sacrificed. If you took away the cell phones and computer this could have been an 80's made for TV movie.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1384560000,10,939,4.790123456790123
5966986,1,B00F3TD9GA,"I frankly don't care that the producer has a medical degree. Although he was probably a consultant, It does not confer any legitimacy to this ridiculous premise......whatever that is.
First of all ergot is a naturally occurring fungus, there are no ""outbreaks"" as in cases of viruses such as those that cause avian flu.

There is no really clear explanation as to why this village is the way it is, why they are doing whatever it is they're up to or why they all run around in black robes. This is a movie with nothing but a twisted, incomprehensible contortion of loose ends and a complete lack of substantive coherency.

This is like a garbled dialogue between"" Children of the Corn"" meets M.Night Shyamalans' ""The Village"".
The dialogue is also unbelievably stupid.",1428451200,2,768,4.8106060606060606

5966991,2,B00F3TD9GA,"First thought I had -- what the heck is ergot poisoning?  Had to go to the internet to find out what it was.  It was not explained well in the movie.  So not knowing what they were talking about I couldn't get the jest of what the big deal was or what importance it had in the film.  Many things didn't make sense in the movie and the director's deal of flashing back and doing the same scene over with different results while not being explained seemed ridiculous and very annoying.  A girl shows up in Salem to do a story on the Witch Trials and mysterious people are after her and she is seeing strange things.  You set through this whole movie to have some people give her a shot and say she is the one suffering from ergot poisoning and everything was her hallucinations.  A side effect of ergot poisoning is hallucinations.  Ergot is a diseased Rye seed.  The next time you see a Reuben on Rye, be afraid -- be very afraid.  Just kidding! You might want to pass this one by.",1414713600,,980,4.248648648648649
5966992,1,B00F3TD9GA,"This movie is categorized as a ""Horror Film"".
The only thing even remotely horrific about this  is how a movie this incredibly DULL could ever get made.
There is more dramatic tension in a sixty second commercial for antacids.

Leading Lady Ali Faulkner stumbles through every scene as if she is heavily medicated. She continually confused :look of fear""
with ""Constipated"".  Jonathan Bennet is thrown into this mess mostly as ""Eye Candy"". He smiles through several scenes, but does nothing to advance the plot.

Normally in a film this insufferably bad the Director can blame the Writer... and the Writer can blame the Director.  Sadly, in this case the film was written and directed by the same individual  - ""Swarmy Kandan"".  This individual is more suited to a career in Food Service. He/She is not even up to the ""Ed Wood"" standard of Direction.

No doubt there are some people who will love this movie. For those of us who do NOT live in our Mother's basements... it is a total waste of time.",1412812800,,998,4.695402298850575

5967002,1,B00F3TD9GA,"I've never reviewed a movie on Amazon, but this warrants an exception.  What a steaming piece of suspense this thing is.  The synopsis of the film was great, but they failed horribly on nearly every aspect of the execution.  There were some good actors in this movie, but the writing, the editing, the cinematography, the score, even the foley work was beyond crap.  I can forgive some things not being polished due to budget, but not when its retarded at a fundamental level.  I longed for ergot poisoning myself before I was 20 minutes into this tragic waste.  I can't believe how bad this movie is, seriously.  I really can't believe NOBODY put a stop to this before it made it to the digital market.  Furthermore, I can't believe they have the audacity to charge full price for this thing.  It's too late for me, but you can still save yourself from spending money on this.

Awful story, awful acting, awful plot. It's so bad that it makes you want to scream and stamp on your ipad.

Be prepared for a story with absolutely no meaning or continuity. Lame beginning middle and ending.  As for the acting, I'm just left speechless. Throughout the movie, you'll see scenes that are just out of place. It will make you question what they're doing there. After a while, you'll feel that you just don't care at all about the plot, the characters and then the whole movie. I wish Blockbuster had a money back policy for really really really bad movies.

5967005,4,B00F3TD9GA,"It is a good movie to watch with somewhat a different screenplay.  There is a suspense element that is worth watching the movie till the end as it unfolds only at the end.  One has to give a bit of an effort till the end to piece together the style of the screenplay in order to appreciate the movie.  I am sure there may be people who jump into the conclusion that the movie is not good but if they see it again, they will understand the movie and the screenplay.  I am one of them - when I watched ""Sixth Sense"", I neither caught the twist nor the clues built in the movie until I watched the movie second time.  So, first time if you don't follow the different dimensional change of the story or the characters' thought process, watch the movie again and you would be happy you did so.",1386892800,,788,4.157894736842105

After I saw it, I tricked my sister into watching it by telling her it was kind of confusing and weird, but that the ending really tied everything together (this is NOT the case), and it's the worst thing I have ever done to someone, and I still feel guilty about it. On the other hand, I am often surprised that The Secret Village doesn't get the recognition it deserves for how bad it really is.

8612148,1,B00F3TD9GA,"This movie was utterly bad. I have a high tolerance for cheap production and acting that is less than stellar but this movie was just plain bad.
 There were huge holes in the story. I mean, you could drive an express train through them big.

Spoilers:

 For example:
 The 'twist' ( which you could see coming a mile away and then some) is that Rachel has ergot poisoning herself and has been hallucinating, well, pretty much everything. The problem with that, however, is that the audience sees stuff that obviously never happened but the movie is selling it as real. Like Goatee Guy almost getting attacked by a bunch of kids and him injecting one of them with a mysterious substance. And him carrying a body around in the woods. In other words, the movie is cheating. Big  time.
 Nothing is explained: Ok, Paul, Jim and (I'm assuming) the cult members are not real. Well, what about Mary? Both Greg and Rachel mention her as though she lives there too. Where did she go? Who exactly are the two guys who keep following her? We're given to understand that in her delusion she broke into their house and started chatting with, well, no one. And they didn't call the cops why? A better plan was to stalk her and freak out an obviously mentally unstable woman? Did ' The Secret Village' even exist? Why was Greg giving the guy those books?
