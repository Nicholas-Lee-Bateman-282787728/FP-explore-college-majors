8555150,5,B00AO6JZOM,"I loved this DVD.  It clearly told the story of how the Star-spangled Banner was written.  In addition, it explained the War of 1812 and the role of music in colonial times.  Outside of one unfortunate female statue that it showed (I got comments from my students on that one), it was wonderful and very informative.  It was put out by the State of Maryland and included comments by the then-Governor Martin O'Malley.  I highly recommend it.",1425427200,,441,4.675324675324675
8555151,5,B00AO6JZOM,American history at its most interesting.  This documentary is very interesting and very well told.  It should be required viewing for anyone interested in the national anthem and its origin.,1404345600,,191,5.333333333333333

8555153,2,B00AO6JZOM,"""Anthem"" is full of information but I purchased it for use at the elementary level.  It is too slow and is mostly people talking to the camera.  It is not appropriate for that age level.",1392076800,,186,4.285714285714286
8555154,5,B00AO6JZOM,"The wonderful music and great history lesson make this a must see!  We all think we know all about the National Anthem, but this production gives you a insight on how it really happened.  Wonderful detail, beautiful music, knowledgeable narrators and a very satisfying history lesson all in one video!  Must see for everyone!",1362268800,3,325,4.981481481481482
8555155,5,B00AO6JZOM,"This video tells the story of the writing of the Star Spangled Banner, including explaining the musical styles of the time, and a heavy dose of Maryland history around the Battle of 1812. It is wonderful watching it in 2012, along with all the other commemorative events around that battle. Highlights are extensive narration by Governor O'Malley- his knowledge and passion about Maryland history really shine through, and prove infectious to make me want to learn more about this era. He is a great story teller! However the absolute best moments of the show are the various choirs singing the anthem at the end. The best you will ever hear is the Naval Academy Choir, it is spine tingling. I would have enjoyed hearing the anthem as sung at Camden Yards, with a loud ""OOOOOOO"" where we all know it goes. I hope to learn more Maryland and musical history from other documentaries from this director!",1355529600,6,900,4.7756410256410255
