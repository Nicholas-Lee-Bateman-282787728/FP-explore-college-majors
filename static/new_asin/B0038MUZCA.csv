4088740,5,B0038MUZCA,"Excellent characters and performances highlight this updated version of the 70's British cult show, Survivors.  Similarities abound between this and the old version, as in some of the exact same characters and plot lines, however there is enough fresh material and new faces to keep fans (like me) of the original entertained.  For me, the highlight of series 1 was episode 4.  Several different storylines and action going on everywhere, all culminating in a very satisfying conclusion.  Keeping up with the rapid pace and action of sci fi shows today, these events would have taken 3 episodes to unfold in the old series.  I also think that nearly all the characters here feature enough mystery to keep you guessing as to how they will act next, which is a more dramatic portrayal over some of the low-key original characters.

I was a tad disappointed in how series 2 turned into more of a continually running plot line than some of the more individualized series 1 episodes.  I always like TV seasons better when they feature individual primary stories, than one spread out over a whole season.  Luckily, the performances and gritty portrayal of life and survival after a catastrophic disaster make this season fulfilling nonetheless.

Trivia: The original series was created by the late Terry Nation, who was also responsible for Blake's 7 and the Daleks from Dr. Who.",1270080000,6,1373,4.960698689956332
4088741,5,B0038MUZCA,"We've just discovered this series on television and are thrilled there's more to enjoy.

The characters are believable, and the interaction interesting. Good writing and plot. There's action to fulfill the needs of the guys in my house and I'm fascinated by the concept of how society would behave in the event of such an apocalyptic disease. Apparently it's a re-imagining of a series from the 1970's.

Two seasons have been filmed (as this DVD set shows) and I really hope they carry on into a third season - We'll watch!",1268006400,27,523,4.736263736263736

4088777,5,B0038MUZCA,"Generally I'm not a fan of British TV or cinema but I love post apocalyptic themed shows so I decided to give this one a chance and I'm glad I did.
Although British produced the show is easy to follow and relating to the characters comes easy
For a TV production it's well written, directed and acted.
My only complaint ... no season three, yet, but hopefully soon, hear that BBC ?
Highly recommend this show if you like this genre.",1464739200,,432,4.345679012345679

4088779,4,B0038MUZCA,"Love this show and hate it was cancelled leaving us with a cliffhanger.  The characters were well developed in the short time the series ran, and the dynamics between the characters were great.  In addition to the abrupt cancellation,  I also docked part of a star for the glossing over of necessities of life in a post apocalyptic world.  For instance, the doctor in the group wanders about without any sort of bag or supplies.  And the group gets ready to pack up and move out in one of the episodes without taking their chickens stating there isn't enough room to carry them ...three or four small animals that can eat bugs and produce food aren't valuable enough to crate up and carry along?!?!  Overall, it's a really good show and I was sorry see the 12th and final episode end.",1457481600,,784,4.524822695035461

I am giving it a one star because BBC cancelled it after the second season right in the middle of a cliff-hanger story.  Amazon didn't bother to mention this in the description of the show.  Shame on Amazon for not telling people they're buying a dead end story and shame on BBC for cancelling such a good show before the story was complete.

4088835,3,B0038MUZCA,"Survivors claims not to be a remake of the nineteen seventies BBC series with the same name. However it has the same premise. that a plague wipes out all but a tiny minority of people and many of the characters have the same names. Comparisons are bound to happen, and I am afraid this version falls well short of the original.  The nineteen Seventies version balanced adventure storylines with the need to show how people would manage to survive, grow crops, keep animals, provide medical care. One particularly distressing episode involved a mentally retarded man on trial for murder.

This series is almost all pure adventure and everybody looks so clean. The first series also saw regular and we loved characters killed off on a regular basis. If you want to see a series about coping with the sudden loss of everything we take for granted, electricity, clean water, medical services, food then forget this and watch the original.",1419811200,,934,4.867924528301887

4088840,3,B0038MUZCA,"Pretty good as a rule . A liitle too much running and sucessfully rescuing each other and somewhat predictible overall. One thing that was an issue for me is the family, despite numerous looters and daily dangers, no one seems the common sense to arm themselves when having weapons would have helped them in most of their scrapes. I know it's a gunless UK but they could get whatever they needed from any empty police station or military installation. By the same token most the criminal types don't seem to have given themselves a similar advantage.",1382745600,,550,4.739583333333333
4088901,5,B0038MUZCA,We love this series. Love the character's. This drama series is one of the best. It would of been nice if it continued longer.,1380758400,,126,4.291666666666667
4088902,2,B0038MUZCA,"The first episode is the best.  Everyone dies in a big flu.  The government minister in the form of the Right Honourable Samantha Willis MP, lies about it until it was too late.  So billions die.

Each episode that follows is a lesson in how to be politically correct.  The flu originates in China but is called the European flu (perhaps it would be impolite to call it a Chinese flu). The regular cast is introduced. It is diverse according to the proper gender, sexual, ethnic and racial requirements.  Al Sadiq, a Saudi playboy picks up Najid Hanif, a young Muslim boy.  Anya Raczynski, a gay medical doctor who watches too many people die and Tom Price who kills a guard to escape prison when everyone else dies, are introduced.  The main character is Abby Grant, who gets sick but survives.  We also meet nice guy Greg who wants to be alone but is willing to give Abby a ride. In the second episode we meet Sarah, a poor hopeless slut who spreads her legs for a liquer warehouse and later for every guy who is nice to her and a few that are mean to her.  She is played by Robyn Addison who seems to be the best actor on the show - the character is weak and annoying - always the first to tell the other characters that their plans won't work and whining - but she is believable and well played. We also meet Dexter, a small time thug who kills looters and threatens the group.

There are three themes that run through the episodes. First, is that guns are scary and good people do not use them. The audience is subject to repeated lectures from everyone about how bad guns are.  Greg won't shoot them because once when his wife left him for another man Greg punched the other man and Greg was ashamed so he concluded that violence never solves anything. Abby is all gung ho to join the new government lead by none other than the Right Honourable Samantha Willis MP - the only surviving member of the government.  This is the second theme: everyone loves government and can't imagine life without it.  When Abby is later kidnapped she tells a sheltered woman, Jill, that everyone is dead and there is no power Jill is surprised but when Abby continues ""there is no government, no services.."" Jill's eyes widen and her lips tremble and she just loses it.  No government! What? That means no health care. Yikes. We had better put the Minister in charge of the government health care in charge of everything and ignore what happened last time she had some responsibility. Abby decides not to join the new government because Willis shoots a looter after a show trial.

Dexter later becomes a government enforcer of rules and shoots Greg but instead of blaming Willis's government he blames Tom who once shot a government thug who was kidnapping Anya.  Willis sort of decided to have a socialist utopia - from each according to his ability and to each according to his needs.  She basically enslave all of the people for their ""ability"" and distributes rations based on her determination of ""needs.""  The government higher ups live nicely, the others work hard.  She gives speeches and Dexter enforces the new constitution brutally.

The final theme is that anyone who provides a decent service for a profit must have evil motives.  The writers, of course, could not let anyone get away with selling anything honestly.  So Sarah buys what she wants and pays for it by spreading her legs even if she has to take some brutality too.  The guy who sells knicknacks out of his truck enslaves people too.  Abby is kidnaped by a nefarious pharmaceutical company.  The business plan of the corporation seems to be: Step 1. kill everyone on earth Step 2. Make terrific profit by selling the vaccine to the few remaining survivors Step 3. World capitalist domination.  It doesn't make much sense but the writers seem completely ignorant as to how people could even walk upright without a permit from the Minister of Walking, let alone share, trade and cooperate freely to improve their lives.

Most episodes are boring and predictable. I could live with that if there were some good visual shots of burning cities, sick and injured people or something but this isn't even filmed in HD.  It is 35mm film.  There are no special effects.  This is not a sci-fi series even if it is plugged as one.  Except for the death by genetically engineered virus, there is no science to be found anywhere.  The pharmaceutical stuff is mundane.  There is nothing imaginative or futuristic or alien or whatever.  It is not sci-fi. Maybe that would be OK too if there were at least some good philosophy or deep understanding of how people actually behave.  Had the writers sat down and read Hobbes, Locke, Marx, Rousseau and Machiavelli before starting this show, it might have been interesting.  Instead what you get is trite morality lessons, endorsements of banal political correctness and a bunch of sissies waiting for someone to save them but afraid to pick up a gun and save themselves.  I keep wanting to scream at them ""Your grandfathers defeated the Nazis and you are cowering because of some teenagers with a baseball bat!""  If the writers of this show reflect what the UK really thinks, Britain should be ashamed of what they have become.",1378684800,6,5221,4.633695652173913

4088907,5,B0038MUZCA,"I purchased this knowing that the series had been ubruptly cancelled - and as a result the story abruptly ends.  But I knew this in advance, so it didn't bother me as much as it did other reviewers,

What's to love about this series?  It is extremely well made.  The actors are fantastic.  The story is realistic.  Set in Britain it takes a very different approach to most US set Post Apocalytic shows.  There are few firearms and there is very little of the 'shoot them up, blow them up' story lines.  The menace is not armaments, instead it is people.  The suspense is gripping.

What's not to like?  Some things just not very realistic eg after a few weeks very few cars will start without a battery recharge.  The Leftist leanings of the BBC are on show - subtle but easy to spot ( of course the budding dictator is the only one wearing a cross).  While the box set is Seasons 1 and 2 - there are only 6 episodes in each.

 But it is easy to put those things aside and simply enjoy what is a fantastic journey and exceptionally well made show.",1366761600,,1047,4.270408163265306

Terrific cast (my favorite is Tom, once upon a time a killer and crook who keeps redeeming himself throughout the show, he is courageous, no nonsense, loyal, no one really appreciates how he keeps his group of survivors together), but the rest of them are good too. I confess I was skeptical at first because I had not cared for the British version of Torchwood, though I am hooked on the US version broadcast by Starz).
Anyhow, to make a long story short, once again, this is a good solid show, people rising up against odds and doing a good job of it.
But no finale... I feel unhinged.
I hope Starz will pick this up, and at the very least, produce a conclusion???????",1364688000,,870,4.512658227848101

I was determined to get a copy, and I did through Amazon. Too bad they didn't go for a third season.

In the pilot the outbreak happens so fast, that its actually not believable.  Not to mention the poor editing.  But, AFTER the outbreak, it gets MUCH MUCH better!!!!  The characters are extremely well written and the Actors and Actresses do an excellent job in bringing them to development.

4088944,4,B0038MUZCA,"Survivors (2008-10) is a BBC production based on a book by Terry Nation that ran for two seasons, each with six episodes.  The story follows a group of people in Britain, in the aftermath of a worldwide pandemic that leaves few left alive.  This version is the second BBC adaptation of Nation's work, as a series of the same name was also produced in the mid-1970's.  Some spoilers follow.

The story opens just as a global pandemic goes critical, and kills most of the world's population.  In Britain, Abby Grant (Julie Graham) contracts the virus, but somehow manages to survive.  With everyone dead, Abby leaves her suburban home to search for her son Peter, who is away at school.  While on the road, Abby meets Greg Preston (Paterson Joseph), and they decide to travel together.  They find other survivors, that include Anya Raczynski (Zoe Tapper) a doctor, escaped convict Tom Price (Max Beesley), playboy Al Sadiq (Phillip Rhys), and Najid Hanif (Chahak Patel), a young boy.

Banding together, the group takes up residence in a large house.  They forage for food and supplies from supermarkets, and homes, but somehow don't seem to gather any weapons or many tools.  On one of their forays, they are challenged by another band of survivors, led by a dislikable fellow named Dexter (Anthony Flanagan), who threatens them with a shotgun.

Joined by Sara (Robyn Addison), the group works together peaceably, while Abby ventures off alone, looking for her son.  Abby finds a high tech settlement being run by Samantha Willis (Nikki Amuka-Bird), a former Government minister.  Willis seems rational, but has radical plans for the rebirth of a new government.  In the finale of Season One, with Dexter as her aide, Willis attempts to begin to implement her distorted vision.  Things turn violent, as Greg is shot, and Abby is abducted.

The second season opens with Abby a prisoner at a research facility headed by a scientist named Whitaker (Nicholas Gleaves), who reports to a man named Landry (Patrick Malahide), the head of a pharmaceutical corporation.  Having survived the virus, Abby's blood can be used to create a vaccine, and she is reinfected in order to increase the strength of the antibodies in her blood.

Abby miraculously escapes, and reunites with the rest of the group.  Leaving London, they encounter a trucker named Billy (Roger Lloyd Pack), who is much more than he appears.  While Abby and Greg recover, Price is captured, put on trial, and found guilty by Willis' group.  Abby's group mounts a rescue mission, but Willis proves to be quite devious, as Tom and Greg become slaves in a coal mine.

After another rescue, the survivors find refuge with a group of female farmers, and tragedy soon strikes.  Abby decides to return to the research lab, and allow the team to use her to develop a vaccine.  But an outbreak has occurred, and Abby's son Peter (Jack Richardson), becomes a player in a deadly game that brings the mysterious Mr. Landry out of hiding.

Survivors features some interesting characters and is generally well acted, however as the first season progresses, the adventure becomes increasingly disconnected with reality.  The limitations of television, no doubt contributes to what is a very ""sanitized"" view of the complete breakdown of society.  Although there are some slow points, the level of action is markedly greater in Season Two, as there are few times when someone in the group is not in danger, or in need of rescue, which leads to an increase in the level of violence, and use of firearms.  And, more time is devoted to exploring and developing the relationships between the various characters.  With a stronger second season, the series rates 3.5 stars.

While the writing falls short at times, and the program is probably not suitable for the whole family, Survivors is still an entertaining fantasy adventure, that also explores different aspects of morality.  The series was intended to continue for another season, but BBC decided against it, so a few matters remain unresolved at the conclusion.",1345334400,,4054,4.96
4088945,1,B0038MUZCA,"First off, this is a review of the series I just watched on NetFlix, not the DVD, so I won't comment on features, extras or packaging.  This review is of the 12 episodes in season 1 and 2.

I liked the basic end of the world concept.  While it has been done before, there is no reason why it can't be done again.  And again.  I have no problem with the acting, the concept, or the professionalism of the production.

What I do have is a problem with is the script and the characters.  Keep in mind that this is the end of the world as they knew it.  The countryside is full of looters, including themselves.

As I watched the series, about half way through I started rooting for the ""bad guys"" to kill off the ""good guys.""  Although I thought the remaining survivors would even shrug that off and keep pretending that the world can't be that bad.

No matter how many times the ""good guys"" were threatened with violence and guns, they refused to protect themselves.  They were continually rescued by the one ""good guy"" with a violent nature, and then got upset at him for being violent.  Although they never got upset at him rescuing them.  Only that he used violence to rescue them from violent people.

No matter how many times the ""good guys"" supplies were stolen, they refused to set guards to prevent the theft.

Most of the people they met, including themselves, were incredibly naive.  They seemed to act as if there was nothing wrong and everybody would obey the rules.  Anybody who wasn't naive was a ""bad guy"" and threatened them.  And the ""good guys"" were always surprised when this happened.  This is even after months of roaming the countryside and meeting lots of ""bad guys"".

Here is another point I found annoying, more so as the series progressed.  Most of the planet has been decimated by a plague.  Yet every week the ""good guys"" had no problem stumbling into another group of survivors.  Some good, some bad.

All in all a disappointing viewing experience.",1341273600,9,1975,4.526912181303116
4088946,5,B0038MUZCA,"Survivors is a BBC TV show about...you guessed it, survivors.  A virus kills off most of humanity.  The survivors are faced with a changed world including threats, challenges and unlikely alliances.  What made this show so good was how they developed the characters and made you care what happened to them.  People who would never have been drawn to one another in the world they lived in before the virus, find value and strength in each other.  AWESOME SHOW!!  Both seasons are definitely worth buying.  I'm disappointed BBC didn't make more.",1333152000,,544,4.912087912087912
4088947,5,B0038MUZCA,"For those of you who became fans of the show in the US, if you have a DVD player that can be programmed as region-free I suggest purchasing the complete two seasons from Amazon UK.  To be shown on US television each episode was cut down by 15 minutes or more, and the US version of the DVDs and on netflix were marketed in the same way.  We watched the show originally on netflix and happened to discover the difference in episodes and then purchased the UK version.  Some of the storylines seemed a little ""fuller"" and made a bit more sense, and honestly gave us a little more closure as we all know by now of the cliffhanger ending.  There was one scene/storyline in particular of which both myself and my husband couldn't believe was left out!

So, long story short, if you really liked the show on TV or netflix, buy the Uk version if you can for a similar price.  Keep in mind it will require a region-free DVD player (or one that can be programmed to be region-free; this is easy to do with several DVD players).

4088948,4,B0038MUZCA,"The survivor genre answers our need for a ""simpler life"" in this complex world. As one of the characters in Series One notes, we all live by pressing buttons but we don't understand anything about the fundamentals. We've become infantile - dependent on our technology for the basics of survival. And when that disappears... what's left? The series follows a small group of people who manage to survive a virulent virus that kills 99% of the population. The various characters span the spectrum but all are fairly true to life. None are saints, some are irredeemable. The characterisation is really why you should watch this series: no Hollywood erzatz sentimentality here. And the manner in which the ""government"" re-establishes itself by relying on thugs and forced labor is so painfully true to life that it makes for deeply uncomfortable viewing. And like all neo-fascists everywhere, the UK government minister who sets it all in motion truly believes she is ""saving"" her people - much as Stalin and Mao ""saved"" theirs...

Of course, as a TV show, it can't be fully realistic. No one gets blood poisoning from an abscess or a rotten tooth; there are no feral dogs roaming the deserted streets to pick off stragglers. And for some reason the opening titles show bacteria reproducing whereas the conceit of the show is that a virus was responsible for the depopulation of the UK.

I watched the whole series in a day. The only downside to this series is it will leave you angry at the ending(or cancellation of the show?) like so many have before.",1321833600,,342,4.276923076923077
4088950,2,B0038MUZCA,"This is an interesting premise and I soaked up the first few episodes fast, but something was annoying me and it was only getting worse with each new episode. The politically correct garbage that makes absolutely no sense at all in an apocalyptic environment. Repeatedly, the characters argue with the alpha male character of Tom over having a gun. He has a shotgun and they spend a ridiculous amount of time and energy trying to get him to give up his gun and run around the horrifically dangerous landscape unarmed, even though Tom's gun saves them from a pack of rapists and hellbent murderers. When the rapists are stopped, the fun loving rape duo are simply taken to the countryside and let go on their merry raping way. At one point, the doctor character tells Tom ""It's the gun, or me."" WTF? I realize that attitudes to firearms are very different in the UK than in the US, but certainly people cannot be expected to believe that people would find it preferable to be unarmed in this kind of environment.

The characters go on to repeatedly do the stupidest things imaginable, for no real reason other than to create more chaos and move the plot. There are characters going off exploring alone, which is obviously a bad idea, and then when they get into trouble, everyone else has to go risk their lives to save them. Months into the apocalyptic disaster and still, no one is growing their own food, or even attempting to plant anything. Supposedly only 1% of humans are remaining on Earth and yet EVERY market and supply store has been depleted or taken over by thugs. The math does not add up. With canned and dried food, there would still be plenty for such a small population. The idea that it is months into it and no one is growing food bugs me more though. I should mention I only made it to episode 8 because this show got too stupid too fast. And what is with the dopey looking bad guy with the gun in the first few eps? The brits have an odd take on what a menacing bad guy might look like. That guy weighs about 140 pounds and I could have kicked his ass in junior high.

This show is like watching the dumbest people you've ever seen try to handle a crisis, but these idiots are squeamish about actually defending themselves.",1312588800,12,2244,4.470731707317073
4088971,4,B0038MUZCA,"Survivors is a cross between Stephen King's THE STAND and the television show Jericho and the characters are varied the way characters on Firefly were (though these characters don't match up to the extremely high level of the Firefly series they are strong enough to be reminiscent of them, which is enough to warrant a look).  If you enjoyed any of these shows, you'll probably enjoy this series.  It starts slow through the first three or four episodes as the world as we know it ends and you get to know the main characters but one of the strongest positives of this series is that the characters grow, progress and change - not always for the better.  They aren't your formula-driven good and bad guys and even when you don't like them, you are given insight into their decision making.  Many reviewers have noted the fact that the series ended on a cliff-hanger because apparently there was hope there would be a season three. In the last episode that was made there is some closure to a loose end as they open up more story-line potential, so the viewer gets some closure while also being frustrated.

4088973,4,B0038MUZCA,"I really enjoyed parts of this series even though it was by and large typical of the post-plague genre. That's understandable as the series is a remake of another series made in the 1970s. All that said, it was well-acted (especially Max Beesley) had some interesting story-lines. However, some of the elements of the story were way to jerky and unconvincing. Without spoiling the story for anybody, I would just like to say that I question the erratic characterization of the political leadership of the new human colony. Also, I thought the young female doctor character tended to be all over the place.

Something I always find surprising (and unconvincing) about many of these post apocalyptic type stories is how willing people are to leave a group and go off on their own, even when the environment is so unbelievably hostile. There are several characters like that in this story, both minor and major characters. I'm just not buying that. Humans are social creatures and seek comfort in numbers. Why would that change when the vast majority of your society is either dead or psychotic?

Ah well. All that griping aside, I would recommend these two seasons with the warning to potential viewers that this series was canceled in mid-story. In order to get the complete story you'll need to dig up the original 1970s series.",1305763200,2,1328,4.871681415929204

The series is about the survivors finding out how to survive in a world without rules.  The cast/characters are all great and I can't even choose a favorite!!

4088977,4,B0038MUZCA,"A great series inspired by Terry Nation of ""Blakes Seven"" 1970s British TV sci-fi fame.  Its an important reference as one of the characteristics of that show was a character called 'Avon' - amoral and prepared to sell others down the river to protect his own interests - a character reborn in the form of a criminal who is at times saviour and other times destructive to the team.  Survivors deserved a longer run in its reincarnated form and possibly was affected (ironically) by world events and the economic crash starting in 2008 which had people looking away from depressing TV - no matter how well crafted.

I am going to flag four issues i have with the series, however must make the point that I watched both series over a 36 hour period (i.e. it was simply impossible to stop watching).  Firstly, I never saw the characters use a swiss army knife / leatherman tool etc. - surely crucial aids in the post-apocalyptic world.  Second the characters often found themselves in situations where their opponents were armed - yet only one has an automatic shotgun to defend them.  Fair enough, though I would have liked some kind of rationale as to why they did not all 'tool up' at earliest opportunity.  Likewise armour - at no point do the characters seek to protect themselves physically with armour - I understand the desire to avoid a mad max type scenario - but a bulletproof vest - surely ??  Fourth noone ever tries to steal the groups land rover even when frequently abandoned.  Lastly and I have worded this carefully to avoid spoiling it for those whom have not seen the second series finale, given the importance of the exchange in the final episode of the second series to the pratagonists of the heroes - why on Earth did they meet with only two armed guards ?  Odd, given the small private army working in the Laboratories in earlier episodes....

All that said, please do not get the wrong impression - firstly it is a very thought-provoking series and second it is very well worth watching.",1298851200,,2010,4.633802816901408

4088979,5,B0038MUZCA,"End of the world dramas have been around since, well, man first began to explore the concept. What these dramas reveal suggests that humanity in the aggreggate (pre-collapse) is not that much different from the hunted and harried survivors.  If human beings are foolish, egotistical, self-sacrificing, or optimistic, they will continue to be so even after the Apocalypse.  In the BBC drama, SURVIVORS, the team directors collaborated to present a vision of a plague-infested England that within a few days killed nearly one hundred percent of the population.  Those who survived were few, dispirited, or driven by a messianic desire to re-establish Law & Order, even if that meant the reimposition of a society that smacked more of white-coated mad scientists than it did of true humanitarians. This BBC drama is based on a book by Terry Nation, who thirty years earlier (1975) wrote a script of the same name and contained much of the plot, characters, and themes that he would update for this production.  I have seen both versions, and though this one is a clear remake, these survivors ultimately learn that the greatest threat to their collective ongoing existence lies not in the plague and a collapsed infrastructure but rather in the competing visions of themselves as to how their Brave New World will play itself out.  These visions are for the most part mutually exclusive.  One simply cannot have a slave labor Gulag mentality patched onto a libertarian commune mindset that yet values the Magna Carta or the American Bill of Rights.

  The first episode is a 90 minute introduction in which the viewer is treated to a rapidly collapsing England.  A lethal flu, begun in China, has spread world wide and thanks to jet travel, has infected the entire globe within days. The dead and dying soon outnumber the living.  Essential services (police, hospitals, power) disappear.  The series protagonist is Abby Grant (Julie Graham), who emerges as one of the few who refuse to allow her humanity to similarly vanish.  She spends all the the series' 16 episodes seeking her teenage son who may have also avoided the plague.  Abby falls victim to the flu but recovers, thus ensuring that her blood may hold the key to a future antidote.  Abby meets other survivors and unconsciously organizes them into an organic entity that is frequently fractured by external events and internal squabbling.  The series regulars include an escaped prisoner Tom (Max Beesley), a doctor Anya (Zoe Tapper), an uncommunicative loner Greg (Peterson Joseph), a rich Arab playboy Al (Phillip Rhys), and a devout Muslim boy Najid.  What this disparate group shares is a belief that takes most of the first season to take root, namely that they must learn to care for the fates of their informally adopted family before they can hope to find individual satisfaction and happiness.  Viewers have complained that several of the episodes have a formulaic quality about them.  The survivors must contend with personal differences exacerbated by frequent contact with assorted loonies and crazies.  Yet, it is precisely this interaction between Abby's maternal ""family"" and competing visions of hostile others that give SURVIVORS an unforgettable air.  It is reasonable to assume that some aspect of central government has also survived and when representatives of this government appear led by a minor government minister (well played by Nikki Amuka-Bird) it becomes clear that the need to re-establish an efficient government must first answer the tricky question as to what type of government is sought.  Abby has met far too many individual non-elected power-seekers to submit meekly to power-seekers wearing outmoded badges of authority.  All around the assorted survivors are the shards of a fractured civilization.  Whether, these survivors can re-integrate their similarly fractured moral compasses into a Greater Whole for the Greater Good is the key question that causes viewers to tune in regularly for an answer that SURVIVORS provides even if many watching do not like this post-apocalyptic vision.  SURVIVORS truly is one of the best dramas of this or any age.",1292630400,,4150,5.1398809523809526
4088980,3,B0038MUZCA,"Make a post-apocalyptic show and Im already half way impressed, and to a degree I enjoyed the series for this reason alone. But after a few episodes once the show establishes a post-apocalyptic scenario the show quickly turns into a repetitive 1 hour drama, where someone gets kidnapped each week. Its a story arch that is done to death... over and over again.

Im sure they could have come up with something more dynamic and ambitous. The lack of imagination in the second season was ridiculous.

It comes across some good ideas... the new government and the slavery compound but it always resorts to the same conflict-resolution: kidnap - escape

There are so many societal ideas one could explore, primal instinct, the resurrection of man, coexistence, survival... And we see all of this on the show but its all done in a very soap opera way. Nobody ever loses. Nobody ever absorbs their experience as the series moves on. The characters stay the same and every week they do it all over again as if nothing happened the week before. There is no real danger. There is no real sense of commitment by the makers of this show. It reminds me of the sci-fi ""sliders"" in many ways, with every episode the characters encounter a new dilemma and thats about it.",1291161600,2,1255,4.669683257918552

Not since Jericho and FireFly have I been impressed so much by a non-mainstream series.  I'm not sure how I got talked into watching this, but it was worth it.

None of the main characters look like Barbie or Ken dolls, and all of them are flawed.  But together, the whole is definitely better than the sum of the parts.  My only gripe in the first couple episodes is why aren't they stockpiling on guns.  However, this is quickly explained that violence begets violence.  Plus, the more I think about it, the more I figured there's only a few places to buy guns, and you can bet those would be among the first things looted and stockpiled somewhere else.

I sure enjoyed the ride, and wish it would have continued.  But at least most the storylines were resolved, and the way it ended was very satisfying.

Political Correctness. Like or not this kind thing ruins a story and makes the characters nothing more then caricatures of what would otherwise be an interesting story.

Tom the gangster seems to have been lifted whole cloth from a British gangster film and is the only one willing to fight to survive. Dexter holds power using one shotgun, ONE!!!

I've read that this is a remake, and as of this writing am unaware of the original. However, this remake, if that is truly what it is, without having seen the original, does it justice. Perhaps not in the literal sense, but standing alone, I am captivated, and amused. A rare condition to be in, these days.

I hope for an additional season beyond the second, and only suggest they refrain from the typical, every lasting plot, and concede to diverge into additional demands upon the characters, their goals, and the series.",1289088000,4,849,4.6158940397351
4089025,4,B0038MUZCA,"Dang, but the BBC puts on some good shows. SURVIVORS was one of them good shows, except that it came and went in a blink, and canceled after two series for not having garnered enough viewership. This sucks supremely. I'd been looking for a post-apocalyptic series on the telly to latch onto, ever since JERICHO got the bum's rush, and I had my eye on SURVIVORS. I highly recommend this show... if you don't mind that the second (and final) series ends on a cliffhanger.

On this go-around, it's an unstoppable strain of influenza which kicks humanity to the curb, killing off 90% of the global population. The show focuses on a makeshift community of survivors in England, and it really is a particular treat to see repressed British people trying to cope. Associated themes crop up inevitably, mostly revolving around the retaining of one's humanity versus the adoption of sheer pragmatism and aggression in order to stay alive and even to propagate the human race. It's always that same question, right? How do you face the end of the world? With grace, or with teeth and claws? Whenever the infrastructure of society crumbles, it's sort of hard to fit in those civilized sessions of tea and scones.

The cast is a diverse one. Extraordinarily, the mantle of de facto leadership falls on a mother named Abby whose primary motivation is to find her vanished 12-year-old son. Abby is the one who coaxes this pack of strangers to stick together, and she provides the group's moral linchpin. Other members consist of a self-sufficient loner, a rich (and shiftless) playboy who ends up taking a teenager under his wing, a young doctor who'd renounced her calling, and a complex stone-cold killer.

This show didn't last long enough to really explore this desolate new world, and it certainly wasn't special effects heavy. The writers instead focus on strong character development and the premise certainly lends to plenty of fodder. To me, the real hook is Tom Price (Max Beesley), the killer in the midst who now finds himself in a savage world that fits him like a glove. Beesley plays Tom Price as almost inscrutable, very hard to read - and there are many moments when he's just so still - but he lets you know that something seethes underneath the stoic expression. Tom is always assessing and re-assessing. And when he wants to, he exudes a chilling menace. Tom Price early on turns his attentions on Anya, the beautiful doctor (who doesn't want to let on that she's a doctor), and I seriously didn't know where this was going. But, as this relationship evolved, it quickly became my favorite one to follow. Tom reminds me of a murderous but absolutely loyal guard dog. He would kill without remorse to keep Anya safe. Tom and Anya are polar opposites. Anya (Zoe Tapper) hopes for a better world and she cares about people. Tom's first resort is that of violence and intimidation. And isn't love sweet?

Outside forces intrude on our group's struggles for survival. Apparently, the British government still exists, shakily, in the shape of a lone government minister fighting to regain order. Because, even in highly contagious pandemics, a politician, like a roach, is sure to make out okay. Abby and her group get tangled up in the minister's increasingly dark schemes.

Technological amenities are still available for some. Ominous helicopters are glimpsed over the skyline. Black-clad paratroopers scour the empty cityscapes for survivors, except that these soldiers aren't fueled by charity or good will. Somewhere, there is a science laboratory conducting some very sinister experiments. And it's Abby Grant's pure bad luck that she had originally caught the deadly influenza but then survived it. Some very bad men are looking for her now, to open her up, see what makes her tick.

So many things unresolved and unexplored. SURVIVORS' budget didn't allow for a more epic canvas, and so what we get are the little personal stories, many desperate moments of human drama, and I loved these, especially since the episodes do manage to inject action sequences here and there and enough doses of conspiracy intrigue. It's fascinating to observe the shifts of loyalties and personal ties in the group. It's sobering that most of the survivors the group encounters shape more into Tom Price's mold, and how most people in power cling to that  very dangerous maxim: ""We do what we must for the greater good."" It's also fascinating how Abby and the others see Tom, regarding him as this unsavory character and yet so very much dependent on his brutal skills to help keep them alive. Lovely Anya struggles with this the most. I do seem to go on and on about Tom and Anya, huh? Max Beesley and Zoe Tapper, they work these characters so well. To reiterate, it sucks supremely that SURVIVORS got the axe.

Now I'm eyeing the original 1970s series.

Five DVDs compile the twelve episodes making up the first and second series. Regarding bonus material, Disc 2 has ""A New World: The Making Of SURVIVORS"" (00:26:34 minutes long); Disc 3 offers ""Character Profile"" clips on series characters Abby Grant (00:04:37), Tom Price (00:04:28), and Greg Preston (00:03:21) and a SURVIVORS special effects segment which features the CGI team touching up the abandoned freeway scene (where Al and Nadj play soccer) and also fabricating the explosion at the petrol station (00:05:48).",1283126400,5,5366,4.907386990077177
4089026,4,B0038MUZCA,"I bought the DVDs because I heard great things about the show. I also bought it because they marketed series 1 and 2 together. I thought they must have done this because there would be a season three in the works. Alas it turned out that this was not to be. The BBC canceled the show after what was a heart stopping cliff-hanger.
So I think that the BBC in essence cheated the consumer. It's like buying a novel only to find out that the last three chapters are missing.
They had a great product and they ruined it---incomprehensible. When you think that a season is only 6 episodes anyway. they should have not left it incomplete. A two hour finale would have been great just to give it a sense of completion.
I also think it is unfair for them to now show the series on BBC America knowing that it is essentially going nowhere--it's been already canceled and it's incomplete. All those viewers will watch the final episode of season two all for nothing, as they will get no answers.
If I had known all this before hand I would not have bought the DVD's.

4089027,4,B0038MUZCA,"SURVIVORS is another captivating BBC drama that tries to answer the question:  What happens when a horrifically virulent plague wipes out 90% of the world's population resulting in total anarchy, lawlessness, and the collapse of civilization?  With only two seasons of only 6 episodes each, SURVIVORS keeps you fascinated and wanting more.

SURVIVORS is a remake of a 1970's series based on a novel by Terry Nation (the creator of Doctor Who).  The series is remarkable in its atmosphere.  The horror of mass death, the realization that only 10% of the population is left, the loss of power, transportation, medical care, communication, law, government are all well done and very believable.  You really feel for these characters and are completely drawn in.  How do you go on when everyone you know has died?  How do you continue to survive, when there are no groceries, no clean water, no medicine?  And no way to bury the millions of dead bodies...

But what is really interesting about SURVIVORS, what really makes it tick, are the characters who are given a second chance at life.  SURVIVORS focuses on a small group of very diverse people who are now thrown together in an almost familial unit:  Abby (Julie Graham), the matriarch who is determined to find the son she's convinced is still alive; Tom (Max Beesley), the convict who was doing time murder when the virus struck; Anya (Zoe Tapper), the pretty young doctor; Greg (Peterson Joseph), the untrusting loner whose life had already been falling apart; Al (Phillip Rhys), a rich, lazy playboy who can't do anything for himself; and Najid, a devout, 11-year-old Muslim.  How has the global tragedy changed them?  Can the convict reform?  Will the doctor ever practice medicine again, or has she seen too much horror?  Will the playboy suddenly grow up?  Watching these people, their interactions with each other, and their reactions to both the plague and how to go on is what keeps the audience coming back each espisode.  Can they remake themselves?  Can they overcome all obstacles and keep on living?

My only criticism of SURVIVORS is that the story lines get a bit repetitive after awhile.  The ""family"" doesn't seem to learn from their mistakes from week to week.  Hey, it is h-e-double-tooth-picks out there; to really survive these folks need to learn a little faster.

Over all, though, SURVIVORS is worth watching.  There are a number of continuing story arcs, and luckily, several of them are tied up nicely by the end of season 2.  Since the series has, unfortunately, been cancelled, I am very glad that a few things, at least, had been resolved.  RECOMMENDED.",1282003200,4,2635,4.904977375565611

Granted, I did find it odd that the few survivors who meet up with each other don't seem particularly happy to see one another (I mean, wouldn't you be a little excited?).  And, found it odd that there wasn't a more cohesive 'plan' once the group got together (why didn't they ever sit down and make some cohesive decisions as a group about where they wanted to settle, what they planned to do in the future, etc.).  And, once they found other survivors along the way that weren't out to kill each other, why did they just have lunch with them and then say, ""Well, see ya!""?  It seems there would have been more of an effort to say, ""There are so few of us left on this earth, and you have a nice crop of food growing here, and you seem to have room for us, can we stay with you?""  I mean, make a colony already!  But, then I guess there wouldn't have been much of a story.  I did so love this, and loved the characters (even the really evil ones).

4089052,4,B0038MUZCA,"I rented this out of curiosity.  A pleasant surprise.  The basic thread of the story is that (* spoilers ahead) a lethal virus of unknown origin has wiped out and killed most of the inhabitants of Britain; although, for some reason, a small few have an immunity to it and live.  The plot chronicles how they must now live without electricity, gas, and the modern conveniences we all take for granted (like a grocery store full of food).

I like the premise of the story itself, but also the excellent writing.  The characters are real, diverse, and interesting to get to know as a viewer. The screenplay dialogue is always surprising and fresh. Stangers must now interact with each other and help one another to survive, while they deal with the sudden grief they their lives are now totally changed forever in a blink of an eye.

An added plus is the great cinematopgraphy, which films many scenes outside in nature and uses a wide lens to show the vast emptiness of the landscape, and yet the landscape itself is beautifully shot.

** first rate drama, a must-see **",1274659200,7,1068,4.619047619047619
4089053,4,B0038MUZCA,"Things started out great but as the show went on, things were redundant and I'm surprised the characters lasted as long as they did.  Most of the cast's personality were set in stone and remained that way until the bitter end.  Sure they would give an exception now and again but what you see from the beginning is what you get at the end.

Also their survival technique and ways to defend themselves were laughable at best.  Everything was open arms like naive little kids.  Even after the initial shock of being in the 1% club, they just keep doing dumb stuff (no spoilers here) as you'll see throughout the show.

The two characters that annoyed me the most was Abby and Nejid/Najid?.
Abby's incessant delusion that every kid she meets is somehow her son or Nejid's I can run away where-ever when-ever I want (more the once even).  This kid should of been dead along time ago.

There were good things in this series though like the polar personality of Tom's bleak views of humanity to Abby compassionate views, and Sarah's change through the series.  There is more of course but I want to keep this review not too long.  All in all, I would give this a 3.5 to 4 stars (thats just me).  Decent and enjoyable.",1273968000,,1211,4.4840182648401825
4089054,5,B0038MUZCA,"If you loved ""The Stand"" or ""Jericho,"" then Survivors is must-see BBC.

Think The Stand minus the supernatural and gore.  And Jericho except the characters didn't know each before the calamity, didn't live in the same town and are on the move.

Excellent production quality, very well-acted and compelling characters.  But for the accents and driving on the other side of the road (not that it matters much what lane you're in after the flu wipes out 99% of the population), Survivors could be in America.  Well, there's also the relative dearth of guns compared to American productions in this genre.  Terrific series, if you've read this far you're going to love it.",1273104000,8,668,4.867256637168142
4089055,1,B0038MUZCA,"Attempting to bring Terry Nation's ground breaking apocalyptic drama series up to date was never going to be easy, especially with the original having such a cult following. But  the BBC's  have failed miserably to create anything but bargin bin entertainment.

Not only are we force fed PC corectness - where it seems that all ethic minorites are affected to a lesser extent by the virus, but we have bad scripts, terrible acting and padding to an unbelievable high.

The Original Survivors might have been padded and lost its way towards the end,But are wonderful and thought provoking drama.

Awful does not even begin to cover this lamentable garbage. Poorly written abysmally acted and directed mishmash of PC nonsense . The world has ended and everyone conveniently arranged to die at the same time!!!!! 99% of the human race is dead but in every episode more and more large groups of people are discovered, did anyone actually die in this plague ? Childish melodrama written by PC morons avoid it like the PLAGUE.

Utter rubbish that you should avoid like the plague!!!",1273017600,9,1076,4.884615384615385
4089056,5,B0038MUZCA,"I discovered this show on BBC and can't wait each week for the next episode.  This series keeps me guessing (which, as a jaded tv watcher, is fairly difficult to accomplish).  Just saw season 2 finale and I can't wait for the 3rd season.",1272326400,3,237,4.363636363636363
4089057,5,B0038MUZCA,"For me to call this series the best show today, is a lot. I watch too much TV and expect a lot out of television shows. Survivors is one of the best shows I've ever seen (barring Firefly). It is smart, the actors are excellent, the story is at once human, horrible, and thrilling. The first few episodes when the virus sweeps through England and everyone is dying were a bit rocky - but you have to start somewhere. Around the middle of the first season, when the group consisting of seven people were forming as a sort of family - even though they were strangers to each other, Survivors begins to shine. The brilliance of this series is how these people are very different from each other, but somehow manage to hold on to civility in the face of incredible inhumanity, which is very real and quite frightening as you watch it unfold. Each character holds his or her own in this series, something one rarely sees on television today. Abby is the matriarch - a very kind, maternal woman before the virus, becomes a very strong, central character who holds this ragtag group together and to a level of humanity others cannot seem to do. Tom is the strong, silent mystery man who holds himself separate, but as the story progresses becomes more and more the other half of Abby. We learn he is a murderer and doesn't have the moral balance that Abby has, but the two are almost a perfect complement to each other regarding this family. Greg starts out kind of wimpy, but under Abby and the family's influence blossoms as a man of great character and intelligence. This ""family"" is the focus of Survivors as they deal with the aftermath of almost complete annihilation of society as we know it. We see one group trying to establish some sort of government, but the flaws are outstanding. We see another who enslaves people to try to jump start an industrial society again. We see groups of people without hope, food, decent water, shelter, and most of all, direction. In the middle of this chaos is Abby's ""family."" I really hope this show goes on for a very long time, and I hope people will start watching it to continue its longevity. Too many fantastic shows are canceled before their time and this show is too good to end. I highly recommend this one to all of my friends and family and am buying it to share with them. Not everybody gets BBC America to watch it here in the US. But it is one you won't be disappointed with. Much, much better than anything offered on American television today.",1271721600,45,2496,4.5
4089058,5,B0038MUZCA,"Great show! Series one, each episode was hour and a half, each one was a complete story. Characters are very real and by the end you care for each one of them.

Ruched ending to the point that I had to check online that there was never another season. Excellent acting and production vales I expect in BBC productions.
