8110673,2,B000EJ9RTC,"Luckily, I had a lot of AmEx reward points that I hadn't been using and essentially got this at no cost.  Good thing, because I'm not really all that happy with it.  There are no real rules to this ""game"".  It's simply trivia questions with bad background music.  There are about 300 questions so don't expect this to be a ""game"" you can play too many times before you run out of questions.  Since there's really nothing else quite like it for classic rock trivia that I can find I guess it's better than nothing, but it leaves much to be desired.  If re-designed and had some real rules to it there's a good chance this could be a good product.  In the end, I'm glad I bought it for myself rather than as a gift because I'd be rather embarrassed giving this as a gift to someone given its limitations.",1313884800,,802,4.271523178807947
