2440517,5,B000BT96EQ,"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman is my favorite show of all time. The show was on for four seasons from 1993-1997. What made this show so special was the great chemistry Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher had on screen along with a great supporting cast. I was a huge fan watching the first episode in the fall of 1993 (I was 16 years old) and never missed an episode. When the last episode aired in 1997 (I was 20 years old) I was sad because like so many other reviewers I grew up with this show and it was a huge part of my life. I remember every Sunday night I would look so forward to seeing Lois & Clark. Me and my best friend Maria would talk about the show the next day and say how we had so many similarities to these characters. I am so happy that that the fans are finally getting a DVD release of all four seasons of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. This show means so much to so many people because it was a good show that lasted longer than anyone ever imagined it would. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman Season 2 DVD set will be released January 17th, 2006. Own the first 2 seasons of Lois & Clark and you will have a super time watching this awesome show that ended far too soon.

8092252,4,B000BT96EQ,i loved this series when i was a kid i wish they would have made a fifth season the only think i wanted was more detailed special features,1301184000,,138,3.9642857142857144
8092253,5,B000BT96EQ,"While this show was oftentimes silly and downright cheesy-I loved every second of it!  The chemistry between Dean Cain and Terry Hatcher was perfect-they could not have found 2 actors more suited to these roles.  Superman himself was sometimes the problem in this show.  The show had to make do with the special effects available at the time but many events could have been portrayed in less cheesy ways.  My favorite episodes were the ones that included Tempus-diehard fans will know who I'm talking about but for the rest of you, trust me that he always stirred things up.  All in all, an excellent show that I would have liked to see continue for 4 more seasons.",1204675200,,665,4.64957264957265
8092254,4,B000BT96EQ,"Very, very nice!

The subject is a charming television series that is presented in DVD format by Warner Bros.  The menus are easy to navigate, slick and stylish. Picture and sound quality are excellent.",1162684800,,202,4.911764705882353
8092255,4,B000BT96EQ,Its was surprisingly good. Although I am not a fan of Teri Hatcher but enjoy the show.,1141776000,,86,4.117647058823529
8092256,5,B000BT96EQ,"I never watched the Lois and Clark series when it was first on, and discovering these discs after watching a few years of Smallville is quite refreshing. Don't get me wrong; I LOVE Smallville, but Lois and Clark is definitely a happier sort of Superman series.  While Smallville portrays the angst of growing up, and, indeed, growing up ""different"", the Superman of Lois and Clark is more about hope.  About making a life and making a difference with that life.  A little closer to the old ""truth, justice and the American Way"" that was so much a part of the 1950's George Reeves' Superman.

I highly recommend these to any Superman fan--they HAVE to be part of your collection.  And, for others that might not know Superman too well, this is a GREAT way to get a feel for the character.  An ongoing series that allows characters to develop is so much more intriguing than what can be portrayed in an hour and a half movie!",1140739200,5,923,4.530120481927711
8092257,4,B000BT96EQ,For fans of Lois and Clark it was a trip down memory lane!!! i loved the fact that you can buy the 2 seasons together but i can't wait to get the next 2 seasons. if you are a fan of smallville and you were too young for lois and clark it is worth a look. (and Dean Cain is so cute as superman/clark aswell!),1140566400,,307,3.7384615384615385
