4437132,3,B004OAPF66,This movie dares you to look away. I wanted to so many times. I struggled but watched 45minutes. . I couldn't get that time back so I chose to change my attitude and stick it out. I stopped expecting this to get better and  got some munchies.  Salted popcorn later and I realized how silly funny this awful movie was.,1469577600,,317,4.266666666666667

4437134,2,B004OAPF66,"Toy promo? Series premier? I'm not certain I should over think this.
The CGI is dated. The story line is not very deep or well developed. There are no real good moral stories here.
There are weird creatures and some fighting. Also death doesn't seem too exist here but people and creatures turn into piles of goo when mortally wounded.
Personally the comical dubbing was almost endearing. There are several dubbing styles, these people went with the tactic of a word in any mouth movement so there are oddly staggered coversations.
I enjoy cruising children's shows from time to time just too see what kids are exposed too. Aside from this sugar.coating death with turning into goo that can be remade, there aren't any real good things being put forward. However I would not rate this as awful. With a little work this could become a decent kid series.",1469491200,,852,4.724832214765101

4437136,5,B004OAPF66,"My kids and I loved this movie. It's not a big - budget blockbuster movie, but that is what I like about it. The characters and the ""fusimals"" are awesome. Great concept, humor and animation.
I hope someone picks this up and makes some toys, I know my kids would love it!",1305763200,,271,4.230769230769231
8437043,2,B004OAPF66,"Not worthy. This movie is like a child's attempt at entertainment, every facet needs significant improvement. How did this even get released?",1513900800,,141,5.454545454545454
8437044,5,B004OAPF66,It would have a series I would have watched and the writers planed to complete. A lot better than some of the other stuff on tv.,1483142400,,128,3.9615384615384617
8437045,3,B004OAPF66,"I liked this movie. Essentially it's about this guy who uses alien technology to fuse animals into Chimaera-like animal.  For example it could be bullfrog, gorilla, & scorpion.  Time passes and the guy then has built this into a popular entertainment industry that's sort of like Pokemon and the WWF combined.  About 15 years have passed and the alien is back and creating general mayhem and during this he kidnaps 4 seemingly random kids.

The thing that downgraded this from 4-stars to 3 is the animation.  This movie was made in 2011 but the computer animation is very subpar unless your frame of reference is 1998.  It's poor enough that it was distracting at times.  Other that that I actually enjoyed the movie.",1474675200,,717,4.780487804878049
8437046,1,B004OAPF66,"Lousy animation,ridiculous characters. Somehow I'm sure tweens have better taste and would find my assessment accurate. Anyone older wouldn't
stick around for more than 3min...even avid anime fans. Just dumb.",1473638400,,208,5.966666666666667

8437049,1,B004OAPF66,I wasn't so thrilled with the animation,1472774400,,39,4.714285714285714
8437050,4,B004OAPF66,Simple animation techniques with great creative futuristic concepts,1472774400,,67,7.5
