8053780,4,B0007Y08XI,"This Chinese folktale, directed by a Serbian, takes place in 1924 Skillet, the real back-of-beyond in post-WW1 rural Ireland.  Poverty, rain and hard lives are set against beautiful rugged scenery.  The farmers grow cabbages, have sheep and cattle.  The small town where they trade and buy necessities is controlled by the pub owner, who drives his own car.  The rest are still on horses and carts.  Women do a lot of housework in the kitchen and laundry.  Water on turf stoves needs constant boiling.

It is the world my own mother was born into back in 1929 in County Mayo, fourth child on a farm near Swinford.  So I watched this with particular interest.

The main characters are the pubowner, his wife; a newly acquired ""girl"" to do some work and then be sold off, a grudge-ridden father and his son, and the local priest.

Everyone knows everyone else's business and there is no free and easy living.  There's a lot of recrimination and guilt and anger.

The plot consists of the small farmer deciding to make the pubowner his sworn enemy, to harass him and accuse him of injustices, which to the viewer almost seems laughable.  The pubowner barely pays any attention to a small and poor farmer, rather more interested in having affairs, acquiring more properties, throwing parties in his pub and having a good time.

Rather than delve into plot details, let me just say that this is a film of surprisingly good and suspenseful turns, like a good old yarn spun by Agatha Christie.  People count for their personalities:  it determines what they do next, and they evolve throughout the film.

The Irish accent and the wet woolen clothes, the white freckled and reddish faces, the thick hair and the bad teeth - all these old Irish characteristics make the people seem absolutely real.

Like all Irish films made about the past, especially out in the country, it seems to be a story of universal truth that lingers in the mind.

Careful that you don't mix this film up with films and books of the same title; in England it's called ""When Harry Became a Tree"".",1402704000,,2063,4.680555555555555
8053781,5,B0007Y08XI,I think I had a crush on Cillian Murphy when I bought this.  It's a pretty good story.  And hey Colm Meany from Star Trek.,1393027200,,122,3.84
8053782,1,B0007Y08XI,"Amazon did it again.  The ad said this was Bitter Harvest with Patsy Kensit and Jennifer Rubin.  It's not.  When this switch happened before on another movie, I thought it was the seller's fault.  The seller explained that they provide movie information to Amazon, who sometimes mistakes which movie is which when they write the ad.  This time, at least, they provided the box cover, which I should've read to realize that these are two entirely different movies.",1283212800,,463,4.884615384615385
8053783,4,B0007Y08XI,Irish movies are entertaining just because they are so different than movies made in the states.  Cillian Murphy is the reason I bought it and will continue to buy his movies.,1173312000,,175,4.645161290322581
8053784,5,B0007Y08XI,"This is the kind of movie Hollywood needs to start making. I'm so sick of American films. Blowing up buildings, sex scenes that really don't fit the film, violence for no reason. I'm enjoying films from other countries more and more and this one is fantastic. A human story told beautifully and the acting is just wonderful. None of that Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise acting but real true acting. The actors are just real ppl they aren't barbie or ken dolls, they have crooked teeth and real bodies. In addition to the fact they can really act. This is a wonderful original story and you would be a fool not to add this your collection.",1172793600,,628,4.469565217391304
8053785,4,B0007Y08XI,"`Bitter Harvest' released in '01 is a fascinating blending of an enchanting Irish countryside circa '24, first love and what could have been a life of quiet contentment for the citizens of the town of Skillet if not for the obsessive, irrational mindset of one mean-spirited local named Harry (Colm Meaney).

Harry is convinced that the measure of his personal greatness is measured by his enemies. Hence he decides to make the most successful man in the community his chosen adversary. Fueled by a series of dreams in which he envisions himself turning into a great tree, he devotes himself to his hatred as though fueled by a revelation from God.

`Bitter Harvest' is cinematically mesmerizing with an excellent soundtrack and wonderful performances by the entire cast. Cillian Murphy delivers a strong, though understated performance and Kerry Condon is lovely as his love interest Eileen. However the magic in this film is conjured up by Colm Meaney. Following the bizarre journey of Harry's mental machinations in an effort to destroy his would-be adversary is what makes this film so enthralling.",1167955200,,1102,5.116666666666666
8053786,5,B0007Y08XI,"As an American, it took me a bit to get used to the language of rural Ireland in the 1920's, but this film draws you into a world that seems not at all foreign after a while.  Unlike the relentlessly depressing ""The Field"", this is a drama of real tragedies - the small, silly tragedies that we create and that are created for us- and also, of real hope.  The original Irish title of this film ""How Harry Became a Tree"" is so much more fitting than the US ""Bitter Harvest"" (what were they thinking?), though fortunately the brilliant allegory of the tree is not lost with the title change.  Performances are universally outstanding and poignant, the photography beautiful, the music haunting.  See this film and see how the Irish continue to astonish with their mastery of language and vision.",1161820800,,793,4.642857142857143
8053787,4,B0007Y08XI,I bought this movie because of Cillian Murphy. That's not why i like it though. Colm Meaney was extraordinary in this movie. The things he does to get back at his enemy is comical at times. The scenes with Cillian are funny to watch because of his character and his relationship with his wife. The ending though is a sad one. The movie is enjoyable.,1121472000,,349,4.384615384615385
