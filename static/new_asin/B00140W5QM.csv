3121123,1,B00140W5QM,Proof! Scientific proof! Evidence! That's science. Having a feeling is not science! Bring testable evidence to the table and we'll talk.,1324166400,9,136,5.523809523809524
3121124,5,B00140W5QM,"Loved this.  Most of all I love that it gives glory to God -- entirely -- for all of creation.

It absolutely captivated our 6-year-old (although this may not be typical).  He watched it over and over again, and kept asking for it.  He was especially fascinated by the description of some of the huge stars.

The thing I really got out of it is the absolutely ENORMOUS size of the Universe.  The feeling I had after watching it reminds me of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy quote, ""The Universe is Big. Really big. It may seem like a long way to the corner chemist, but compared to the Universe, that's peanuts.""  (Which is actually pretty ironic considering Douglas Adams would have hated this presentation, as he described himself as a ""militant atheist."")

Our family really enjoyed it, and would definitely buy it as a gift.",1323388800,5,833,4.619047619047619
3121125,5,B00140W5QM,"I must say that this presentation of the Cosmos, created by God - is the most powerful I have ever seen. I've seen Carl Sagan's Cosmos and I've seen other secular presentation of the Cosmos, but they all fall flat compared to ""The Created Cosmos"".  God is indeed the Creator God and this presentation doesn't beat around the bushes about that assertion which is straight from the Bible, and I appreciate that so much. Jason Lisle did such a fantastic job with the visual imagery presented. One really has to see this at the AiG Planetarium to get a jaw-dropping visual on God's universe.  I highly recommend this.",1323388800,3,613,4.666666666666667

3121127,5,B00140W5QM,"This has something for everyone, but it is a wonderous glimpse of the vastness of space in a Biblical perspective. I am a tough costomer when viewing material on human origins. Both the visual presentation,the science, and Biblical support demonstrated in this short video is well worth the investment.",1297382400,8,302,5.183673469387755
3121128,5,B00140W5QM,"We visited the Creation Museum with our kids in the summer of 2010, and saw this planetarium show twice.  It was awesome to see the vastness of God's created universe and see the earth in its perspective.  Yet to know that each of us is so important to Him.  I wanted to have this at home for a resource in our home school.  There are so few things produced from a Biblical worldview, and this one is.  I highly recommend it for everyone.",1296777600,7,438,4.228915662650603
3121129,5,B00140W5QM,"I think it is a great video to educate yourself and your kids about cosmos. It is modern, filled up with modern science discoveries - but through the view of God as the Creator. I think any person, who can think, will understand, after watching this video, that there is a God (and Bible wholly represents His words).",1282521600,6,317,4.482758620689655

This was a really good presentation I enjoyed. The quality could have been better, but it was not terrible.",1463788800,,222,4.439024390243903
8253842,5,B00140W5QM,"One of the best creationist-perspective videos on astronomy out there! ;)
I think this used to be shown at Ken Ham's Creation Museum. So glad we were able to get a copy, especially since it is the only way to see it anymore!",1456617600,,224,4.232558139534884
8253843,5,B00140W5QM,"This movie is excellent. It takes you on a journey from earth, to the closest stars to us, compares those stars with our sun, and has all kinds of neat information about our universe. I really enjoyed this movie.",1428883200,,212,4.461538461538462

8253846,3,B00140W5QM,"I thought this was the latest (2011) Creation Museum version , but it was not.

As the 2007 version, it is ok, however the latest 2011 version with the enhanced color is best, which is the version which was  shown in the Creation Museum when I visited it  in June 2014. I rec'd the 2011 DVD there as a gift, but also gave it  away as a gift.  I subsequently ordered another  2011 version from  the  creation museum""  webite  (""answersingenesis)",1407110400,,444,4.4375
8253847,5,B00140W5QM,Really great content! I used this video for a discussion/talk I gave on the the universe and Biblical topics. Everyone loved it and was deeply impressed by the facts of our universe.,1394668800,,182,4.71875

That said, I suppose it's perfect for you, you being the sort of troglodytes who believe you can learn everything you need to know about the universe in 23 minutes.

8253849,4,B00140W5QM,"Just 23 minutes long it puts forward the young Earth postion of about 6000 years.  Sharp graphics, it explains that the International Space Station is 200 miles above the Earth.  The Moon is 240,000 miles away which is the farthest that humans have gone.

All the planets would fit in a box that measures 6 billion miles. From there the rest is pictures of Alph Centauri which is the next solar system.  It just keeps going on about how far things are away which make the viewer feel very small.  Interestingly, when it goes to the location of the other stars and looks back toward the Earth it explains that the stars look different from there. Constalations are pointed out, blue and red stars mentioned. Nebula and globula clusters, M-4. Fairly amazing. Difficult to comprehend.
