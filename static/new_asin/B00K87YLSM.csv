6407056,5,B00K87YLSM,This was hella worth it and i would recomend it,1408579200,,47,3.8
6407057,5,B00K87YLSM,"The classic yu gi oh is one of my fav amines of all time, this set comes with all 5 seasons and the bonds beyond time movie it would have been even a better set if it would have come with the 2004 yu gi oh movie but my guess is that 4k media doesn't own the rights for it. The set has 32 discs and it's 86 hours 47 mins long",1408406400,4,324,3.513888888888889

6407059,5,B00K87YLSM,Finding the complete set is a time saving way to cut down on shipping expense plus the hunt and peck system of trying to get all the season.  My first aniame experience and Yu Gi Oh is an excellent story line and this is an excellent find.,1407283200,3,239,4.085106382978723
6407060,2,B00K87YLSM,it says region all regions but im in u.k and it doesn't play in my player it only play's in your player's aka (usa) so it's not all regions. but other then that mass fan off series still glade i got them. sorry about bad rating.,1407196800,5,228,3.9782608695652173
6407061,5,B00K87YLSM,"As a long time fan of the original Yugioh series I was excited when yugioh classic started coming out in volumes last year, I was going to purchase them separately but I heard of this set. It's a little more buying the set together for pre order than purchasing 5 sets for 25-30 each, pre order was 160 or so, but it came with the yugioh bonds beyond time movie, which is cool. And came all together in a wicked cool box with an episode guide. This includes all yugioh in English including capsule monsters which was released after the original series. Contains like 32 or discs, something like 86 hours, Duelist kingdom, battle city, Noah's arc, battle city championship, waking the dragons, Kaiba grand champ, capsule monsters and dawn of the duel. It's perfect for any collector.

10/10 would bang",1406592000,60,800,4.673758865248227
6407062,5,B00K87YLSM,"I've loved the Classic Yu-gi-oh. I would always rush home from school and would refuse to do homework till I watched it. This is the show that first introduced me to anime and I've been in love with it ever since then. It been super hard to find all the seasons of this show seperatly. Thank you so much for releasing this!!

6407100,3,B00K87YLSM,"Very disappointed in the fact that, so far, two of the episodes randomly through the series, we're forced to skip episodes because of a flaw in the discs. Considering how much it costs, I would expect better quality. We're almost done with season three, so we'll see how many more episodes we're forced to miss.

The packaging is great, my son thinks it's awesome.",1505260800,3,364,4.6875

6407102,1,B00K87YLSM,"When I first got this I was super excited because this was my favorite show as kid and I haven't seen all 5 seasons. But my excitement soon turned into disappointment and frustration, once I started on season 3 every disk would freeze on the last episode. It was a combination of either right after the theme song or after watching 5 min into it and it sends me back to the home page. So many missed episodes and it kept happening  until the second disk in season 5. Upon further investigation some of the disk came scratched!! I spent my hard earned money only to buy GARBAGE,  for the price I was expecting better quality.",1503446400,,624,4.370689655172414

From when Yugi first puts the puzzle together to the final duel, relive these moments anytime you want. At first I use to collect the volumes of the series but was never able to get them all. When I saw this was available I was excited to finally have the series! Now as I watch these episodes it takes me back to when they were first aired on TV and how I became a Yu-gi-oh fan.

6407162,5,B00K87YLSM,Love this anime due to many childhood memories. But the only problem is that it comes without widescreen support and is not HD.,1479686400,,127,4.565217391304348

6407179,1,B00K87YLSM,"My box set came and a lot of the discs were dusty and scratched. Some are scratched so bad (all coincidentally Season 3 discs for some reason) that they get instances of the dreaded ""disc cannot be read"" error partway through episodes, and I know it's not my player's fault. This product was technically sealed, but scratches this severe indicate this is most definitely NOT ""factory new!""",1475107200,,389,4.82089552238806
6407180,4,B00K87YLSM,I'd like to give this 5 stars it is a very cool box set but the part that holds the disc feels very cheap,1475020800,,105,3.4166666666666665

6407203,5,B00K87YLSM,"I watched Yu-Gi-Oh! as a kid but I started late so it was awesome to catch up on all the episodes I missed! The packaging is beautiful and beyond worth the value! Everything was in pristine condition. If you're a fan of 4Kids YGO duel monsters then this is totally for you(I honestly love the 4kids dub). I watched all 5 seasons in 10 days, and then rewatched it!

6407209,3,B00K87YLSM,The packaging is extremely flimsy the plastic cases starting coming off after the 1st day and the disc are annoying to take out I just put the disc into a cd binder. Its amazing to get the entire classic show but the packaging is complete crap and you cant skip the intro/outro song its great after like 4 times for nostalgia but after that you just want to see the episodes and gets annoying,1467504000,,392,4.3108108108108105
6407210,4,B00K87YLSM,"Not a review of the series, but just the box set. I bought my copy of this monster of a box set from an individual seller on Amazon for about $84 including shipper, a steal for the complete series and second movie of classic Yu Gi Oh. The box set itself is a little hard to manage since it consists of stacked plastic sheets with two discs put sheet that aren't attached to the box or each other. Keeping 15 of these perfectly even and trying to insert them and the wrap around cover into the box is a little frustrating considering how much this set cost. For content this is an A+ buy, for packaging, it's manageable and looks nice on a shelf from the outside.",1467158400,,662,4.2204724409448815
6407211,5,B00K87YLSM,"Absolutely excellent series. A few bits of wear and tear, but came when expected!",1466640000,,81,4.857142857142857
6407212,4,B00K87YLSM,"It should be said first - the set is intended for a specific sort of Yu-Gi-Oh fan. If you enjoyed the anime as 4Kids released it, then this set is absolutely worth your time and money. If you're an anime fan who needs uncut episodes, Japanese audio, original openings and endings, don't bother - none of that is present.

The show itself is great. 4Kids picked a great voice cast (mostly anyway), but otherwise edited and spliced the show as they saw fit to its detriment. You will notice several inconsistencies if you're paying attention, but the plot will overall make sense. What makes it worth watching are the mind games, monsters, and generally funny lines. No subtitles at all, though, even for the hard of hearing.

The set itself is impressive. It's 32 discs long, the whole series plus a movie, and it's organized two discs per tray and overall sturdy. The episode guide is a nice touch, but the box is what really looks nice on your shelf.

I'm happy with mine, and if you know what you're looking for, so will you.",1466467200,,1027,4.54054054054054

6407214,5,B00K87YLSM,"This is one awesome series and was my very first childhood anime, now that they have put all the episodes into one DVD box set! I was so happy to get this, so worth every penny. I just wish it had the first movie into this set instead of the newer one ""Bonds Beyond Time"" but still worth every penny. If anyone is a Yu-Gi-Oh! lover, get this set!

6407251,5,B00K87YLSM,"Finally, a childhood favorite is finally here in its complete glory. When it comes to kids shows, it's really hard to find some in their complete sets. Sometimes, companies don't even release them at all! So seeing this is a gift from above to us long time fans. First and foremost, this has fantastic packaging. The outside fits the themes and look of the show perfectly. Inside, there's a very nice and convenient episode guide that helps you get your mind around the 200+ episodes and movie, plus season synopses too.

For anyone who has watched the show, you know exactly what you're getting. The only real set back is that this is not blu-ray, or even high definition. But that's ok. This beautiful complete collection is truly a God send for anyone who calls themselves a Yu-Gi-Oh! fan. If you're debating getting this, just get it. I promise, you won't regret getting this gem of a release.",1453334400,,897,4.677215189873418

However I will say the disc trays are very fragile.
they break if you are you are not careful.

They are not the greatest if you're looking for HDTV quality picture and sound, which is why this is getting 4 instead of 5 stars, but for the price, this wasn't a bad deal. I recommend this boxed set if you're looking into buying the complete collection and are just a huge Yu-Gi-Oh fan.

8656780,2,B00K87YLSM,"I don't typically give reviews.  I read reviews prior to purchase and they where mostly positive, but I saw one issue several times.  That issue was that it would freeze and episodes would not be watchable.

This review is not based on the shipper, the packaging, or the quality of the discs.  All of that was great, the discs are clean and no scratches.

My 2 is based on the fact that I am halfway through season 2 and I've had about 5 episodes I couldn't watch or watch entirely.  It froze and no matter how many times I took removed the disc and reset the blue ray player same issue at the exact same spots.  I also maybe another 10 or so times where it froze and skipped one to two lines of dialog.

Others said similar things,  I cannot recommend this version of this item.  I think the discs themselves have bad data on them.  I hope the issue is only on what I've seen because I haven't seen the last 3 seasons or the very end of season 2.

I'm not returning or requesting a refund on the item (for those of you that may be thinking that) because I did get the item I paid for in good quality, and I saw the issue on several reviews.

I would recommend a different version of the complete series in case they don't have this issue.",1532736000,,1239,4.15546218487395

8656785,2,B00K87YLSM,Not worth 200 or even 100$.  I will warn everyone right off the bat that the packaging is cheaper than it should be.  The plastic DVD holders are super fragile and the spine is just tape!  Not to mention I found mine crammed into my mailbox I stead of at my doorstep so it probably crushed the plastic even more.

8656786,2,B00K87YLSM,"All the episodes of the original series are here as well as the DVD of the movie Bonds Beyond Time.  So it's a nice way to relive what you saw in the past or what you may have missed. However there are some quality issues with this release.  Some minor ones such as plastic breaking off of the trays that hold the DVDs in them are forgivable due to shipping as well as the nature of these trays.  What I can't forgive is how the treatment of the episodes and the discs themselves.  On the discs there are several instances I've come across of the audio in episodes skipping for unknown reasons so the audio and picture don't match,  thankfully its not a common occurrence in what I've seen but it was common enough to be a issue in my eyes.  Not only that but the quality of the video on the DVDs leads me to believe that either 4K Media's master tape copies of the episodes have severely degraded over time or they were using VHS copies recorded when the show aired on television.  Given the fact that one of the season one episodes showed the TV rating box, aka the ""Y7"" box, in the introduction I'm wondering if that is what happened.  I've included a picture to verify my claim. I'm rather disappointed in this release and I wouldn't recommend fans of Yugioh purchase this.",1523577600,2,1277,4.358649789029536
