8423100,5,B004CJB0B8,I have been into model railroading since 1946. I'm also interested in how railroads operate in other countries. My interest came from hanging around down by the Milwaukee Road tracks where they passed under Vliet Street in Milwaukee WI. Besides having tips one can use in his/her train hobby these videos provide insight as to how and where real railroads operate.
