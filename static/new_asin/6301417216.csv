330386,3,6301417216,"Good , honest , depressing , truthfull film . But it deserves only 3 stars ... not a bit more . The reason why it was a big hit in US :
1. It was depressing anouph to be used in propaganda compain in US .
2. The 2 nude scenes in it , what was BIG deal for Soviet films then , and perfect for male population of the US .
 As result , Natalya Negoda get couple good roles in American films . Check out "" The Comrades of Summer "".",1038268800,4,427,3.5913978494623655
330387,5,6301417216,"During the late `80s in Gorbachev's Soviet Union most film's took advantage of the liberalizing climate to address problems and realities that were often ignored in more oppressive times. Little Vera is one result. The story of a young rebellious girl in a dysfunctional Russian family confronted with adult decisions.
Natalya Negoda is wonderful as Vera, a confused and angry teenager growing into adulthood. Equally excellent is Yuri Nazarov as her alcoholic father. Vera self-destruction steers herself, her lover and the family into flurry of difficulties, including run-ins with police and pregnancy.
This is one of the more realistic depictions of life in Russia that I've seen on film (though most Russian families aren't this dysfunctional). In the midst of Vera's calamities and rebellion we see some genuinely touching scenes with her father, who in spite of her shortcomings and his own alcoholism loves her.
With excellent acting and directing, I highly recommend Little Vera.",1034121600,3,988,5.380645161290323

330389,3,6301417216,I saw this mivie in Russia when it first came out. It was one of the first films of its kind. Now it would only be relevant and interesting for very serious Russian cinema buffs.,1006473600,,178,4.114285714285714
330390,3,6301417216,"I agree with Inna ( who lives in my same town! ) that this movie is ok... Really, it shows a poor working class family's troubles, of which Vera is one of those troubles.",994982400,,170,4.029411764705882
330391,1,6301417216,"I remember when this movie first came out in USSR. I was fourteen and it seemed that everybody was crazy about this child of perestroyka. But the craze was not so much for the plot, but rather for ""let's show the  world that perestroyka allowed us to show sex in our movies too!&quot...I personally didn't  like the movie. Really nothing special, unless you would like to learn  about life of working class in the last years of Soviet era.",964915200,8,439,4.531645569620253
330392,2,6301417216,"""Malen'kaya Vera"" opened in Russia in the late 80's, featuring the nation's first on-screen sex act between Natalia Negoda and Soviet heart-throb Andrei Sokolov (sort of a ""Leonid"" DiCaprio to  Eastern teens). Picketers surrounded cinemas protesting it, decrying the  morals-corrupting influence of depraved ""Western values"".  Actually the sex scene is extremely tame by American standards.  What made  this film truly revolutionary was the heretofore prohibited portrayal of  toxic family life, including grinding poverty, alcoholism, domestic  violence, despair, and youthful rebellion.  The film may be  ground-breaking, but it is also ear-splitting in its stridency.  None of  the characters are likable enough to care about what happens to them.  As  other reviewers have mentioned, the acting is superb.  The film  accomplishes its goal, but it is enough to see it just once.",964915200,18,881,5.6692307692307695
330393,4,6301417216,"I've seen this movie in Moscow, when it first hit the screens, and it was a really revolutionary one for those times.  I think it depicted quite well the problems of the young people in Russia, also the grim details of  the life of Russion people in general - drunkenness, rudeness, total lack  of culture, ignorance and so on.  For those interested in furthering their  interest in Russia it will provide another source.",962496000,12,421,4.712328767123288
330394,2,6301417216,"I've seen this film long ago in the former Soviet Union when first  video-clubs were officially opened. People wathed this poor quality tape  about SU everyday life and at first so close the sexual act with Natalya  Negoda as Little Vera in soviet film was shown. It is hard to imagine how  great was the influence of this one scene to youth in country where  ""sex was not at all"". Russian actors played great as always but  such themes as alcoholism, relationships between children and their parents  were shown in very heavy (""No future"") manner. For me it was  enough to see this film just once.",961027200,3,598,4.5754716981132075

7811727,5,6301417216,"Excellent movie, so ahead of its time. I think it was underappreciated / misinterpreted when it first came out. It is a very honest portrayal of life and desperation in Russia at the time. Excellent directing and acting. Still watchable today, maybe even more watchable now.",1463961600,,274,4.978260869565218

7811731,3,6301417216,"The Bottom Line:

Revolutionary for its time (I believe it's the first Russian movie to show nudity and feature a sex scene), Little Vera now is a sometimes-interesting take on the lives of two lovers in 1980s that now functions better as a piece of history than as a film.",1238803200,,273,4.46
7811732,5,6301417216,"If you were around prior to the fall of the Soviet Union them you may remember how eastern European and Russian women were depicted.  The image of the East German female weightlifter who would put the Rock or Arnold Schwarzenegger to shame comes to mine.

What made this movie interesting is that it was one of the first times where you could see Soviet women depicted as women, as well as the crushing poverty that many still face in the Former Soviet Union.

If you are considering meeting and dating foreign women online then this is a recommended film for you.  Not so much as a cautionary talk but rather as an eye opener.

Cheers!",1204502400,2,636,4.495652173913044
7811733,5,6301417216,"They used cheesecake to get attention. It worked. Vera is red hot. Amen. The twist is that this is a great film! Very much a political allegory. A family is falling apart along with its country. However don't forget that besides good looking, Russians are intelligent, tough & dangerous. Vera's educated boyfriend is disrespectful to her parents. The boyfriend pushes his luck & the father stabs him. Later dad has a heart attack -what will they do when dad is gone? At the time, I saw this film as the Soviet Union asking the world for understanding.",1122422400,3,551,4.690721649484536
7811734,4,6301417216,The video quality is low. Subtitles (English only) are not optional and leave quite a bit untranslated. The DVD contains no bonus features. But the film is a definite masterpiece and worth seeing by all means!,1110412800,5,209,4.833333333333333
7811735,5,6301417216,"I saw this movie when I was in Leningrad, before Gorbachev resigned Christmas Eve, 1991. The state-run television station ran it one evening, and I watched it with my Russian friends, who insisted it was a {adult film}. After the movie, the same people who thought they'd be able to see explicit {adult} scenes ended up sitting around the kitchen table discussing the movie over vodka and pickles as if it were an obscure painting of the Peter and Paul Fortress.
Whatever, the movie gave me, as a United States citizen, an insight on Russian family, lifestyle, fears and hopes. To many Russians, it seems they consider the film effluvium to be dismissed as they are probably used to so much state-sponsored affect flotsam and jetsam. But to some of us ""uneducated"", it was enlightening and funny/ironic toward the end, with that ""HAAA! HAAA!"" attempt at mental escape.
Not to mention, Natalya Negoda is hot! Or should I say, sovsim garyatchaya...",1039564800,4,946,4.881987577639752
