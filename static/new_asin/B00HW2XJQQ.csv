8636796,1,B00HW2XJQQ,"I didn't hate it --- I bought it because I really like the movie and wanted to own my own copy. Even though you (Amazon) usually indicate when a DVD is foreign nad might NOT accomodate our DVD players, I don't remember reading such warning for this movie ---- so I bought it nad it doesn't fit. Returning it is too much trouble, so I now own a DVD I can't watch. I should have paid closer attention.",1467676800,,399,4.128205128205129
