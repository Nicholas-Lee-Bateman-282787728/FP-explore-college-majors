8146666,3,B000IOMZEW,"It is like taking a dance class, where you get good choreography.

But the dances aren't exactly the kind you can use on the dance floor with a partner.",1215302400,,152,4.241379310344827
8146667,4,B000IOMZEW,This collection has been a great addition to my workout routine.  The steps are presented in an easy to follow way and the dances are fun to do.  I use these DVDs when I can't get up the motivation to make it to the gym.,1204243200,2,220,3.8666666666666667
8146668,4,B000IOMZEW,"After working out with MaDonna Grimes on FitTV I thought it would be a great idea to purchase more of her videos.  It's easier to enjoy yourself than to just workout because you HAVE to get in shape.

I am very interested in the African and Latin American culture so I was pleased that the Afro-Latin dance was included.  Although the warm up session seems to really work you out,  I enjoy the foundational concepts that MaDonna uses to get you into the dance, and after being inactive for sometime, I did not find the moves too strenous!  I was so busy enjoying myself that I forgot that I worked out for 40 minutes!  I can't wait to try the other dvds in the series!",1197590400,4,668,4.304
8146669,2,B000IOMZEW,"I am a big fan, but there was nothing to warn me that these are repackaged from old videos (except for Afro/Latin, hadn't seen that before).

So if you have MaDonna's earlier stuff, you've probably got this too.

Bummer, I was looking for new choreography.",1194825600,,256,4.666666666666667
8146670,4,B000IOMZEW,"I bought this, not ever having heard of MaDonnaGrimes, but from reading the cover, saw that she had a master's degree in dance performance and had been in many fitness and fashion magazines.  Her body is amazing!!  Also, her personality is very vivacious.  First, I tried the Dance Street 2, Afro Latino Moves, because I'm interested in African Dance.  She classified it as between beginning and intermediate, but I'm intermediate level, and it was very challenging for me both choreography wise and aerobics-wise.  I didn't feel that she gave and adequate warm-up and she does mention to do a little of your own, but it would have been better if she, the professional had provided a full warm-up.  Her warm-up was more of a workout.  Once I got into it, I had fun and felt very challenged.  Next, I tried the Dance Street 4, Electric Moves.  It was amazing.  I felt like I was in dance class again(I used to take jazz and hip hop).  I really had to concentrate on her instructions which were very articulate and she gave lots of time to go over each step.  I had so much fun.  I can't wait to try the other two! The one downside:  the quality of the dvd visually and sound-wise was mediocre.
