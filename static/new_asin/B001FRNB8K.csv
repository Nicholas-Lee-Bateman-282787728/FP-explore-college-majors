3588427,5,B001FRNB8K,"I bought this for my sister cause I told her I had seen this movie on TV and that it was interesting since it was based on Adam's first wife. The movie is probably a ""B"" movie but I enjoyed it the first time and now having purchased it. It is based on some truths but the movie is fiction. It isn't a great movie but I enjoyed it. The quality of the dvd was excellent and it was shipped very quickly. I watched the movie for any damage etc. the dvd was in excellent working order. I am very pleased with purchase.",1275177600,,513,3.9902912621359223
3588428,3,B001FRNB8K,"I first saw this on the Sci-Fi channel.  I liked it immediately and tried to find it but couldn't.  For several years I looked but only recently located it because I was browsing on ALLCDCOVERS and found it by accident.  I then looked on AMAZON and it was available.  I bought one and it turned out NEW.  I realize that it is a ""B"" movie and low budget, but I usually like Sci-Fi titles and this is no exception.  I also understand that many people are more difficult to please than I am, but, many titles are good entertainment if you simply give them a chance.  Overall, I am happy that one of the titles on my unavailable list has finally been crossed off for good.",1272499200,,668,4.253968253968254
3588429,3,B001FRNB8K,"bought this movie because i dearly love shiri appbleby, the plot is a good one but the story line was slow. shiri does the best she can with what script she has to work with. movie lacked passion. special effects were a 6 and i was hoping for a 9. i like movies about the bible, that deal with myth and legends and lilith is quite an interesting subject but this movie does not deal much with the lilith myth, but instead cheapens that legend. buy this movie for a couple of bucks, but not worth more than that..wait and catch it on tv on a day when you have nothing else to do.",1252713600,19,578,4.078947368421052
3588430,4,B001FRNB8K,"After waiting for years, I am finally able to satisfy my craving for this film.  I know it's not a great film, but it is one of those ones you see and don't forget.  Everytime it was on I had to see it and every year I looked for it to come out for sale.  While doing my annual check for films I've wanted but couldn't find, there it was.  Finally, one off my list.  However, I'm sure I'll be adding one back to replace it's spot in my revolving list of films I just wish someone would put out.  It's campy, but a fun ride for sci-fi fans and general teen-aged boys like mine.  Heck, I probably like it better than them.",1246924800,12,620,3.991869918699187
3588431,5,B001FRNB8K,"My nephew has been waiting with baited breath for this to available and has already watched it more than once. You don't know how happy you made him. It came quickly and in great condition and he will always order from you when his favorites are available. I know, because he calls me and I order them from you.",1239494400,9,311,4.288135593220339
3588432,5,B001FRNB8K,I've always wanted this movie ever since I saw it on the SF Channel! Was overjoyed to find it on DVD!,1234742400,7,101,3.857142857142857
3588433,5,B001FRNB8K,"I mostly got it because one of my all-time favorite actors is in it, but it's actually a pretty good movie.",1365206400,,107,4.142857142857143
3588434,5,B001FRNB8K,"but i can tell u this, she portray lilith excellent. along with the veteran actors. i hope to see her in some more movies",1363392000,,121,4.083333333333333
3588435,5,B001FRNB8K,ARRIVE RIGHT ON TIME GREAT PRICE I WOULD TELL ANYONE WHO LOOKING FOR THIS MOVIE JUMP ON IT A VERY GREAT DEAL,1357776000,,108,3.9545454545454546
3588436,4,B001FRNB8K,It came fast and it is just as described. I had seen this movie a few years ago and enjoyed it's angle.,1351296000,,103,3.727272727272727
3588437,3,B001FRNB8K,"pretty much makes no damn sense really like alot of scifi these days.

the girl from Roswell is the best thing.  she's likeable and the rest are bland as hell  some of the actors are from episodes of Charmed  when playing demons.  ugh  by god that show had the dumbest rubbish happening.",1337644800,,287,4.423076923076923
3588438,5,B001FRNB8K,"The CGI scenes were good and the fight was ok too, but it gave alot about the legend of Lilith",1335052800,,94,3.75
3588439,4,B001FRNB8K,This is one of the few quality movies that the SyFy channel has released. The acting is good and the special effects are decent for a made for tv movie. Fans of Appleby(Liz from Roswell) will definetly went to check out this movie. At amazon prices this DVD is worth a look.,1310688000,2,274,4.288461538461538
3588440,4,B001FRNB8K,"This movie is worth watching simply because of Shiri Appleby, a highly underrated young actress.  Without her it would get 2 stars from me, but Shiri is worth 4 stars all by herself.",1296086400,6,182,4.515151515151516
3588441,4,B001FRNB8K,"On a whim one evening I originally watched this movie on television.  I liked it enough that years later when it finally came out on DVD I ordered it.

The story moves rather slowly, but for anyone who is a bible buff, the history is very interesting.  The story tells another possible version of Lilith's actions.  Watch the movie, do some research and decide for yourself.

I enjoyed it!",1294444800,2,389,4.579710144927536
3588442,4,B001FRNB8K,"This movie came fast and in good condition. The movie itself, is another story. It is an older movie, so the graphics are pretty poor, to me it is funny to watch. I only got this movie because two of my favorite actors are in it, Richard Burgi, and John de Lance, otherwise I would have passes. The story line is alright, and some of it is true about Lilith and items about the garden of Eden, but some parts if you are not paying attention jump around too much. Over all if my favorite actors weren't in it, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did. My friend didn't like it at all, but he doesn't like Sci-Fi, so I wouldn't count his vote.",1279670400,2,653,4.109375
8302503,5,B001FRNB8K,Thanks,1493337600,,6,6.0
8302504,4,B001FRNB8K,Viewed it on Netflix and liked it. Interesting concept and fairly well done. Took more than a year to locate an affordable copy of the DVD.,1426204800,,139,4.384615384615385
8302505,5,B001FRNB8K,"Nice Movie! Those who don't follow Hebrew/Jewish Traditions aren't Aware of Adam's 1st wife Lilith - she was the TRUE FIRST FEMINIST B/C She refused to lay down beneath Adam since she believed them to be equal. Well, the Christian god didn't like it so he banished Lilith out of Eden & turned her into a demon. The story of Lilith follows bedtime stories based in the Jewish faith b/c mothers always laid charms around the cribs of their babies to fend off Lilith from taking them, after the Christian god made another wife for Adam only this time he made her by supposedly using a rib from Adam's body, which I gather was supposed to make her feel as if she owed him or something but regardless, she became the little wimp & before you can say it, she was Adam's bitch since everything in life revolved around a man. Wow how she could've taken lessons from Lilith! But I digress...

Lilith comes into play when she's captured & studied while others who are part of this cult-like group known as The Faith realize someone has created a Demon so the once 1st Wife of Adam may be humankind's only Savoir.",1423180800,,1102,4.455445544554456
8302506,2,B001FRNB8K,"I admit I am a devoted Shiri Appleby fan since the pilot episode of ""Roswell"" so many years ago. I had never heard of this movie and bought it solely because she had star billing in it. In a nutshell; the movie stinks. Shiri is excellent at what she does; she is a fine actress able to pull off a variety of roles. She is attractive to look at, but she immediately draws a person to like her and sympathize with her character. She has a natural gift for displaying emotions with just a slight movement of her mouth or eyebrow. Her tears can bring the viewer to tears as well and her joyful smile is light a light in a dark room. Here she is miscast in some attempt to parallel a ""Buffy the vampire slayer"" type role. She, like Sara Geller is petite and unlikely to fight massive and brutal demonic characters. The Buffy T.V. series worked because of excellent writting and directing (at least the first few seasons) by Joss Wedlon and Marti Noxon. Sara is not a versatile actress in that she is not capable of carrying off any role set before her. Shiri is limited only by what her fans want to see her in. This movie is choppy and inconsistent. The directing is like something a college class would produce. There is no character development. We like Shiri's character because we like Shiri. I understand the idea was that this would be a pilot for a proposed series. Much as I love Shiri I am glad that didn't happen. The plot is thin and unbelievable. Buffy I could believe from the first episode. ""Roswell"" had me hooked from the first 2 minutes and got even better. ""Darklight"" is as bad as the miserable product marketed as ""Bloodrayne"" that totally missed the premise of the video games and the comic books. I am grateful for good writing and production on ""Life Unexpected"" - a fantastic venue for her talent, and continue to watch that series again and again. This DVD goes in the trash.",1423094400,,1896,4.435530085959885
8302507,3,B001FRNB8K,"I only vaguely remember seeing Shiri Appleby in movies like I Love You to Death so I'm not a major fan (not that she was bad in that one). This movie is very slow and there are several moments where I could see what they were trying to do but they didn't pull it off. It had so many elements that I normally like: an interesting demonic female lead, characters slowly walking away from explosions, that part after a fight where characters just sort of stare at each other in the rain. Somehow the mood was always missing that one element that would make it interesting. I think Lillith would make a good 90s fighting game character though, but maybe that's just because of the Playstation 1 quality CGI in this movie.",1410912000,,717,4.4393939393939394
8302508,3,B001FRNB8K,"Not an example of good writing, or spectacular directing, but still a fun cheesy movie. L is a girl without a memory, only to have a strange guy appear and tell her she's a cursed biblical villain who has blindly attacked and massacred people for thousands of years. So now she works with a secret organization originally formed to destroy her to eradicate a new villain, whose power of darklight has been harvested from her own powers. It ends with a clear hint that it could form into a series, which did not follow. It's about what one could expect from the SciFi (now SyFy) Channel, low budget, not terribly original, and not high quality, but fun.",1406419200,,652,4.581196581196581
8302509,4,B001FRNB8K,"I've seen it on SciFi channel a couple of times, but no movie dvd is worth what people are asking for on this site",1398729600,,114,3.7916666666666665
8302510,3,B001FRNB8K,"This could easily be a sci-fi channel pilot as it has all the earmarks of a Hallmark presentation with a little blood thrown in so they can call it sci-fi.

The plot is hokey, the execution is so-so, and there is no redeeming social value.

The only reason most people purchase this movie is because it contains Shiri Appleby as Lilith / Elle; it is true that she has come a ways since her original Taco Bell commercial days.  However one person does not make a movie.

The plotline is a distortion of myth with a little sci-fi tossed in to create a winged creature with a cute smile that shall protect humanity from evil creatures with snarly smiles.

This movie passes time for people that do not have anything better to do.",1387843200,2,726,4.428571428571429
8302511,5,B001FRNB8K,Saw this on TV several years ago and enjoyed the suspense.  Was glad to find it available to watch again.,1379894400,,105,4.25
8302512,5,B001FRNB8K,"I'll be the first one to say that this movie isn't for everyone, I bought it because Shiri Appleby  is in it and I've been a big fan since Roswell. It's definitely a B movie at best but it's a pretty good B movie. Good cast, decent story and B movie special effects, not Oscar material but still worth a look. Shiri's character is Lilith except she doesn't remember her name due to reasons I don't want to get into here! All she remembers is that it started with L so she goes by that name L! It's all about a demon seeking to redeem itself or herself and her fight against her own nature! It's a good popcorn movie so pop a bowl and check it out!",1372982400,,647,4.0546875
