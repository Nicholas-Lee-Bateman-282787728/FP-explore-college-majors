Tom Delonge was not even in it, which automatically ruins it.
The sound quality is completely aweful.
Also, they keep bringing in random people, making things more nad more confusing.",1075939200,9,206,5.088235294117647
8166694,5,B000069I0U,"This dvd is so funny. it has scott in it, and he is so cool. way better than the new drummer travis and i wish he had never left. there are some extremly funny laugh out loud moments and its worth every cent. get it even if you are remotly a fan of the band, you will not regret it.",1060905600,,282,3.716666666666667
8166695,3,B000069I0U,it was interesting and cool but way to short.it showed the aqua bat members which was cool but it only showed mark and scott of blink and not tom.he was hiding back stage the whole time.so if ure a true fan get this video but if u don't know anything about blink and you are a new fan this will probably bore you.,1030665600,7,313,3.984126984126984
