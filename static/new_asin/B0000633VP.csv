were trained by Goku (Goten's Father). They can fuse into
Gotenks.",1022025600,,123,4.904761904761905
1687848,5,B0000633VP,"It appears that Piccolo, Gotenks, and Super Buu are trapped in the Time CHamber for NO REASON!  Gotenks was only faking being helpless and Piccolo thought he was serious, so destroyed the door to the time Chamber.  However, Buu creates a rip in the dimension and exits to the Lookout, where he turns EVERYONE into chocolate and eats them!  Gotenks powers to to Super Saiyan 3 and then does the same thing that Super Buu did.  He leaves the Time Chamber with Piccolo and continues his fight with Buu, gaining the upperhand.  However, the Fusion is wearing off quickly, but there is a new hope for Earth.  In a very emotional scene, Gohan's training is done and he leaves Supreme Kai's Planet, saying goodbye to Goku.  Kibito teleports him to Earth and gives him a gi like Goku's.  But does Gohan even HAVE to fight?  Can Gotenks beat Buu by himself?  Watch the video to find out!",1021939200,7,878,4.535031847133758

7958613,5,B0000633VP,"I am glad to see that the 4:3 or original version of DBZ is still sold.
Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,254,4.3125
7958614,5,B0000633VP,"After the entrance has been shut, Buu becomes hungry and creates his own escape route out of the time chamber. Upon escaping, Buu decides to eat all of the Z fighters and their families. Gotenks and Piccolo arrive too late to help. Even if all seems lost, Gohan is still undergoing his training in the world of the Kai's.",1355702400,,321,4.4576271186440675
7958615,5,B0000633VP,"IT'S AWESOME I LOVE IT THE Japanese version was alright
i'm glad the Japanese one had the origenal music",1044921600,,104,4.526315789473684
7958616,4,B0000633VP,"This DVD has 3 somewhat funny, somewhat action-oriented episodes. When I first saw the english episodes, I was disappointed. But I wasn't disappointed because of the music, dialogue, or anything to do with FUNImation's interpretation of the episodes. I wasn't happy because there was next to nothing that I couldn't wait and see for free on Cartoon Network. I personally couldn't see anything that would warrent an edit from FUNImation. The entire reason for owning a Dragonball Z DVD over the cheaper edited video is the censorship. But, when I took a look at the Japanese Version, I realized that it was well worth my 20 bucks. The parts that were supposed to be funny were, and made more sense than the English dialogue. Overall, if you like the funny parts of Dragonball Z and can bear some minor cusswords (they say them a lot in the Japanese version of these episodes) than I would recommend this DVD. Otherwise, wait for Cartoon Networks release on TV.",1028678400,3,959,4.783132530120482
7958617,5,B0000633VP,"This is now one of my favorite DVD's, now.  This leaves off when Piccolo has destroied the enterance to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.  Buu still finds a way out (motivated by his lust for candy) and leaves Gotenks and Piccolo trapped.  In a weird turn of events, Buu transfromes everyone left on the lookout into candy.  Gotenks finally uses his ""special technique"" to get out with Piccolo.  Inraged with the knowlege of both of his mother's deaths (remember, he's both Goten and Trunks), he starts to get the upper hand until he de-fuses!  However, Gohan's power-up with the Elder Kai is complete, so there is still hope (thus the title of the next DVD).  I recommend this DVD to anyone who want's to see more of Gotenks's crazy attacks.",1028505600,3,737,4.666666666666667
