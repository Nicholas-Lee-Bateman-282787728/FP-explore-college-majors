6589943,5,B00MN9PPZQ,"I have never been disappointed with the original Law and Order series, even in the midst of the writer's strike, it still provided thought provoking entertainment with the grittiness of NYC as its own character.

6589959,5,B00MN9PPZQ,"Bit pricey, but great writing, acting.

This season reminds me of great writing, and acting of season one.

Too bad ADA Borgia didn't have more seasons.

The seasons of ADA Serena Southerlyn aren't that good because of her crusading character and episodes aren't that good. Only bought because of Jerry Orbach.",1443657600,,310,5.03921568627451

expect from the series. Even though I has seen the season during its first run on television, the twist in season finale still came as quite a

8673149,5,B00MN9PPZQ,"I really like this season. It had a varied mix of stories. It also had Dennis Farina. I always liked him. He had a natural way of acting. I really liked the chemistry between him and Martin. They complimented each other. The reason I like this installment was because people forget he was a real police officer. So when you see him you see how to correctly hold a gun, interrogate a suspect/witness, pursue someone, etc. There are some liberties that are taken on this segment but it helps to ground the series.",1515628800,,511,4.505376344086022

8673153,4,B00MN9PPZQ,"I'm a Law and Order fan but the 16th season feels like the beginning of a downhill slide. Simple plots, bad dialog, bad acting etc.  I haven't watched the entire series yet and will modify my review when I have.
Update: Overall this was a good year with a few not so well written episodes so I'm upping my rating to a four star form a 2 star.",1503446400,,342,4.029411764705882
