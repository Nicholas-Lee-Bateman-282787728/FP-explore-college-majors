1924384,5,B0000DFZZ5,"I really enjoyed this whole series, regardless of all the sexual referances and lot of nudity. I read alot of reviews that said the ending is incrediblely sad. it is sad but not as bad as a lot of the endings I seen. Don't read on if you haven't seen the ending. In the end that girly looking cyborg from managment is sent to kill Suguru. Mahoro and Suguru run away to try and escape while Slash and Suguru's grandfather kill all of Managment. The girly cyborg find Mahoro and Suguru but Mahoro self destructs to kill him and save Suguru. With Managment dead peace is made between Humans and Saint but Suguru is thrown into a depression because everyone he has ever loved has died. He moves to a neutral colony and becomes a half human half machine Managment cyborg hunter who greatly resembles Gene Starwind from Outlaw Star. Saint reserects Mahoro to finally make Suguru happy and he moves back to earth to see all his friends again. This is a somewhat good ending but i would love another season where everyone is an adult.",1077408000,7,1026,4.491978609625669
1924385,5,B0000DFZZ5,"If you haven't seen the rest of Mahoromatic, I reccomend starting from disk one and watching the whole thing in one sitting. This ending had to be the most powerful, emotional, and psychologically amazing ending I have seen in a series in a very long time. Hell, I've never seen an ending quite like this. It made me angry...and I was on the verge of tears. Even now, 2 hours later, I am still knee deep in shock.",1072137600,4,413,4.3076923076923075
1924386,5,B0000DFZZ5,"The first 2 disks of Something More Beautiful had a lighter mood than Automatic Maiden (1st season of Mahoromatic), but that changes immediately at episode 10. This story is a tragedy at it's heart and these 5 episodes are a headlong plunge into betrayal and death. Episode 14 tries to give you a little hope to end the series with, but you may want to watch this disk alone if you don't want anyone to see you cry. Do watch it though, this has got to be the finest heroic tragedy in all of anime.",1071619200,2,497,4.242105263157895

8000843,5,B0000DFZZ5,"Mahoro is a retired combat android. She has a little over a year left in her operational life span. She decides to spend it helping people. She takes a job as a live in maid for a middle school boy named Suguru. She quickly works her way into his heart with her devotion and pure intentions. They become very close and overcome many challenges. A sexy teacher who has her eye on Suguru is always trying to split them up, an old enemy returns to settle the score with Mahoro, and Mahoro's impending fate weighs heavy on her heart. Despite these trials, their bond remains strong. Thye may be able to overcome any challenge together, but what will happen when her life span comes to an end?

This is a great anime. It is very similar to Steel Angel Kurumi. It also has a bit of a Love Hina, and Girls Bravo mood about it. I personally like it better than Kurumi, and Love Hina. The animation is pretty good, there are lots of great characters. The voice acting, and soundtrack are also very decent. My favorite part about this show is the many different genres it spans. There is action, comedy, drama, and romance. This show has a very sweet love story going on, but there is also a lot of nudity and pervy stuff thrown in there. This show has everything. I can't believe that I just found out about it by accident. It's over 10 years old. I'm very glad I discovered Maharomatic. I think any mature anime fan can find something to love here.",1353196800,,1440,4.373134328358209
8000844,3,B0000DFZZ5,"The last episode left a feeling of disconnection and confusion. Suguru( who you find out is part alien in a previous episode) is 20 yrs older and on another planet. He also has artificial body parts in some places. Mahoro comes back (not born, though, as I read somewhere) because it seems her conciousness or soul/essence is used to bring back her existence. She is still the same mahoro with the same memories and still as she was before she died. There is just way too much time that has passed and you never get to fully understand what has happened all those 20 years. Plus you never hear what happens to Suguru's friends. You see Miss Shikito, because she is on a field trip with students, and she hasn't aged in looks. So there is just too many loose ends that really need an explanation. So I guess emptiness is another feeling I got left with. Plus the stuff said in the credits creates more confusion. And if you see the ova after, it leaves a weird feeling, at least it did for me. So don't expect too much.",1350345600,,1018,4.363157894736842
8000845,5,B0000DFZZ5,"Outstanding!  Keep in mind this anime is from Japan.  I get a kick out how some people like to say that this anime has a lot of fan service that is not needed. I say that it is part of the story and one should respect the wishes of the story tellers.

  In other words, how would you feel if the Japanese would to say that they don't like the way we play baseball and we should play the game Japanese style.  Get my point?  Poeple should try not to be so obtuse about anime that is from another counrty.  That's part of their culture.  Enjoy it for what it is.

  The ending broke my heart and I have many feelings about what went on with our little Mahoro-san.  I do have this to say about Mahoro-san.  She may have not been an android after all.  Think about it.  A android that bleeds?  Feels pain? And has strong feelings about life and living?  I think she was a cyborg and a clone of Matthew created by Vespar. After a battle, a Saint agent asked if they could help repair Mahoro-san.  The Vesper scientists stated no way and would not let them near her.  Why?  Anyways, get this DVD!!!

  If one is really into this anime I would also read the comic books as well in order to get a better understanding on how and why it ended the way it did.  I think the TV people were press for time when they ended the anime, which left a lot of questions.  This anime is popular all over the world and for good reason.",1145836800,,1413,4.084249084249084
8000846,4,B0000DFZZ5,"This was my first school/harem type anime and I must say it was quite enjoyable.  In the near future Earth is under attack from an alien race called `Saint'.  A secret society employs humanoid combat androids to fight against the attackers.  The greatest of these is Mahoro, in the shape of a comely 19 year old.  When her tour of duty is done she requests to be allowed to live out her limited lifespan caring for a young 14 year old named Suguru.  The son of a war casualty she feels responsible for.  Mahoro meets Suguru and passes herself off as a simple maid who happens to have been a warrior in her prior life.  The series then moves through a slow arc as the two sweetly come to love each other while dealing with the more mundane scholastic existence of Suguru and his friends.  Meanwhile the darker side of the plot continues to fester in the background as Saint's greatest warrior goes after Mahoro.  In the second series Minawa a young android from a third faction called Management comes into play.  As Mahoro nears the end of lifespan things escalate, both feelings of love and the plots against her where she must make a decision that will affect her and Suguru for years in the future.  The final episode is one that has been ravaged by fans, I will admit that it really emotionally hit me hard seeing Suguru in such a state.  Anyone that has loved and lost will feel a twisted knife of a reminder in their heart seeing what he has gone through.  The dichotomy with the rest of the series is quite extreme as it got back to being so serious in the last couple episodes after the majority of the lighter versions.  Taken together though the Mahoromatic series is a lot of fun and an engaging love story with plenty of fan service and a nice ensemble collection of secondary characters.  Recommended.",1128556800,2,1814,4.487804878048781
8000847,5,B0000DFZZ5,"I started off buying the manga at my local bookstore, until I found the first dvd of Mahoromatic at Suncoast. The story is exactly like the manga so far, there is still one book to be released. The second season has a nice intermission of the holiday season and then jumps right back into the conclusion of the series. The ending does leave alot of questions unanswered in my opinion. I would like to see an OVA evolve out of this series, if even just a short one to explain what has happened and to find out if miss shikigo ever ages. OMG that lady never changes. She has got to be one of my favorite characters and one of the only bits of comedy in the last couple of episodes. No matter how depressing the story gets she is always there to add a perverted sideswipe to the events depicted. I do believe they pushed the ending. It was a good ending, but could use a better and more drawn out explanation. I had to watch the final 2 episodes a few times through to finaly have a strong understanding of what happened. I do suggest you share this series with others, but only if the mature content doesn't offend them. Maybe there will be an OVA one day, propably not, but we can only hope.",1127952000,,1190,4.246696035242291
8000848,5,B0000DFZZ5,"What can i say, from the beginning to the end of the series was a great enjoyment, story, characters, and humor were all great but the real drama comes in the last disk of the series. I won't spoil it but the ending did put make me a bit teary eyed and does make you think what that the best happend and it just wasn't all an illusion or just a 1 minute of happiness type thing, the drama is superb though in this last disk, just a total shocker from being light hearted and perverted to just good drama with an excellent story and ending.",1119916800,,539,4.09433962264151
8000849,5,B0000DFZZ5,Ok this anime was one of the best i've seen and i've seen alot. ending was sad and diffrent but great. the only thing that keeps me thinking is that it may be a dream?,1106870400,,167,3.8
8000850,5,B0000DFZZ5,"....leave such a deep emotional scar?
Just like the third disk of the first season, we get hit with the revelations of battle, the ""last date"" with Suguru.  And the commemcement.  Again, filled with flashbacks and introspective moments, this last set of episodes make for an intense experience.  As the viewer, many scenes reminded me of moments that occured over the couse of both seasons.  After ""living"" with Mahoro, Suguru, and friends with such enjoyable memories, it all comes down to keeping Suguru away from danger.  We get a deja-vu moment of ""the picnic that never happened"" from the first series.  And we are left to our own imagination to decipher what we just saw.
Saying much more than that would be too revealing of the plot.  Way too many people have spoiled this story in their reviews, here and on other sites.  For better or worse, I think it takes a work of genious to seed such strong emotions in an audience.  Mahoromatic is that work.  To quote another opinion on this series, ""Mahoromatic betrays the atmosphere, and
more importantly the carefully constructed character personalities developed throughout the series.""  That betrayal is the finishing touch on a true work of art that breaks the rules right when everybody expects the norm.  The end result being a solid polarization of the audience containing both good and bad reatcions.
This series has been over the top in every way.  From the beginning, it was aparrent that this story would come out no-holds-barred.  Perverse, funny, corny, sweet, and upsetting.  This series is an experience that I'm glad I subjected myself to.
(Vague Spoiler Warning)
To debunk any Television Economics Naysayers.  I have seen a scan of the final page of the manga.  The story wasn't butchered for the sake of television.  In fact, I would conclude that Gainax merely sprinkled a little sugar on it.",1087776000,,1864,4.900958466453674
8000851,5,B0000DFZZ5,"Holy Mackerel!  I'm still in a state of shock the day after viewing the final two episodes.  I've thoroughly enjoyed the entire series.  You're totally drawn in as you get to know each of the characters and begin to care and feel for them, particularly Mahoro and Suguru.  When I first started watching it I was just expecting a typical light-hearted comedy along the lines of the Love Hina series.  But late in the first season and especially at the end of the second, you see a much darker and sinister side to it and you become totally engulfed in the events that are to transpire.  Without giving anything away, the writers could have taken the easy way out as the series wound to a close.  But their final solution was, shall we say, unique but definitely original; so you've got to give them credit for that.  I had to watch the final two episodes each a second time just to try and take it all in and to confirm and reassure myself that what I had just witnessed had actully happened.  Basically the series runs the enitire gamut of emotions.  It's got it all: comedy, drama, romance, suspense and even a slight aura of mystery about it.  Yes, the ending is sad and somewhat depressing, but certainly plausable and as I said before, unique and original.  I've certainly never seen anything like it before.  It definitely makes you think.  For it to be able to have such an emotional impact and still have you talking about it the next day, how could it not succeed?",1085270400,5,1472,4.484962406015038
