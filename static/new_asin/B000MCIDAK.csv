8167791,5,B000MCIDAK,"This is an amazing anime, so it's a shame that ADV hasn't released it until now; three years after they got the license. To give a little bit of background, this was made by Studio BONES, the studio behind Full Metal Alchemist, Scrapped Princess, Wolf's Rain, and Cowboy Bebop: The Movie. This anime was my favorite thing made by them, hands down.

The editorial review is incomplete so here's the deal:

Set one hundred years in the future, Kurau Amane is the daughter of a scientist on the moon who's been experimenting on the revolutionary, newly discovered ""Rynax"" energy. On her birthday, Kurau goes to work with him, but something goes wrong, the energy breaks containment and flashes out, hitting Kurau and disintegrating her. Although she reforms, she now identifies herself as ""Rynax"", revealing that the energy was sentient. More pressing, although retaining Kurau's memories and experiences, she is unable to leave the body until the appearance of her ""pair"", who was injured in the experiment and is resting.

10 years pass, and ""Kurau"" using her special energy related powers has become a top mercenary on Earth. However, despite the long time for recovery, her pair has yet to appear. Not only that but she seems to be under a lot of surveillance...

Graphically astounding, a fantastic soundtrack, and an action-filled but dramatic plot, this is an amazing anime. It will regularly make you shed tears out of the level of sadness sometimes, so be aware that it's a little more emotional than usual fare.",1175472000,25,1518,4.9411764705882355
