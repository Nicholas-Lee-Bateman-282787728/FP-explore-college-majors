I got two copies of the DVD/CD, and both DVD's has problems...they stop for a fraction of a second several times. It is no a major issue but it is not what you expect when you buy a DVD.",1315872000,,304,4.258620689655173
8424639,5,B004D0AMQ0,".....another outstanding showing by ACAS with new younger talents as well as the solid core group. While hoping that this was an all new show live in Europe there is also the previously released 'Live in Japan' combined with the newer band footage. Also included is the newer concert on a audio CD. This release renders the "" Live in Japan"" DVD as obsolete though the packaging on the former is superior....musically the band is on fire showcasing the new blood ,great piano and horn section, scintilating percussion, danceable.....5 *'s",1302912000,2,537,4.977777777777778
