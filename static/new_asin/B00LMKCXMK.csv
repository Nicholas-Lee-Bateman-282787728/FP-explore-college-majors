8666671,5,B00LMKCXMK,This movie is amazing. I will never understand why so many of Orlando's movies are not released in the U.S. He rarely gets the credit he deserves and I feel like this role really shows how versatile of an actor he is. He doesn't always have to have a sword for the film to be worth watching :) A must see for any fan of Orlando's but also a great action flick overall.,1520467200,,368,4.054794520547945
