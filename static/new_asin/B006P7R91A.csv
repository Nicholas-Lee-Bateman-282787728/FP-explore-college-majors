8502647,3,B006P7R91A,"The main attraction here is Roy Dupuis, a major Qubec star and sizzling ""sex symbol"" for French-Canadian women. He plays a Swiss art dealer who is smitten with a Hogtown (a.k.a. Toronto) hottie who is a minor television female celebrity. He removes his business to the Ontario capital to pursue her more readily and more frequently. She, for her part, falls for him but also for a budding novelist who works in a bookstore. The plot's turns see Dupuis inadvertently helping his romantic rival to see publication of his recently completed novel, a first for him. In the end, it is the art dealer who ""gets the girl"", and just in the nick-of-time, as he has closed down his gallery and, dejected, is about to return to Switzerland.

Roy Dupuis, with his ruddy, farmboy-like flush of health, in some poses, at least when when his leonine head and mane of hair do not appear too massive. Dupuis even manages, at times, to look rather a bit like Michelangelo's famous statue of the young shepherd-warrior David. That is especially so in a scene near the end in which he is closes the lights on his now empty gallery, shifts position variably, and ends up striking a very similar pose to what emerged, from Michelangelo's hammer and other sculpting tools on marble, of that immortal youth, David (albeit fully dressed and in silhouette, in Dupuis' living semblance of the statue), a subtle and effective touch of imaginative camera work. The man, who can pose so well, knows how to act, too.

The film is redolent of sophisticated Qubec or European ""tel-roman"" broadcast series, but with production values good enough for outright cinema. The interior decors are quite pleasant to the eye, the domestic living spaces artfully decorated and in appealing colour-schemes. Eric Robertson's music comps and vamps away agreeably and nondescriptly, as that Canadian musical figure' craft always has been content to do over the decades in a proficient if not particularly striking manner from Robertson's teen days recording for the Toronto budget dime-store, rack-jobbing label, Arc Records, onwards. The production only rises a bit above the usual television level of dramaturgy, but the movie does make for a pleasant viewing, at least once.",1520035200,,2230,4.991935483870968
8502648,5,B006P7R91A,"The movie was great and so was Roy Dupuis! This was a great romantic comedy. He is an enjoyable kind of actor that you could watch all day and still want more. He just pulls you in with that voice and those eyes. You hang onto every word he is saying. I could look and listen to him all day and all night! I remember when I was watching him in ""Le Femme Nikita"" in the late 90's and he was excellant then. I would like to have more of his works.",1347408000,3,445,3.847826086956522
8502649,4,B006P7R91A,It was a cute film. Theme song is perfect. I believe this was the director's first film and he did a really good job. Roy Dupuis is awesome as always. You must see.,1346716800,3,164,4.0
