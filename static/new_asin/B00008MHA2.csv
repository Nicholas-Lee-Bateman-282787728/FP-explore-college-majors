8173714,4,B00008MHA2,Sammo Hung Kam-Bo shows here that his fight directing skills are superior in this early film I also enjoy watching Chang Yi who is also good in this film. Really good sword fighting for it's time.,1234396800,,196,4.472222222222222
8173715,2,B00008MHA2,"I'm gonna skip the movie and get to the product! This movie has
the worst sound quality in the world! This movie must of been
transfered straight from a 25 year old 8mm film or whatever! The
first 36 minutes of the film is irritating as hell! There's this
roaring sound in the background and it sounds like heavy rain
pouring and the voices and music is muffled! Then after the
36 minutes suddenly the movie becomes almost mute and the voices
don't match with the mouth movement! And may I remind you this
movie is in original language, not english dubbed! And then
after like 20 more minutes the movie goes in it's regular
sounding 1971 sound quality or whatever! And it sounds the
better than the other two but still bad! This product is to be
avoided becuz of the sound quality and I think this movie was
even edited too! I don't know! The back of the DVD case, the
time limit is 81 minutes not XX! BUT if you are THE HARDEST OF
THE HARDEST OF THE HARDCORE ADVOCATE OF KUNG FU then get this!
The movie is good but again ruined by sound! Otherwise avoid
like the plague!",1112486400,2,1072,4.285714285714286
