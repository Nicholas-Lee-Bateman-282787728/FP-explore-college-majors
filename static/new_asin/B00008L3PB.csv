1850133,5,B00008L3PB,"""As Time Goes By"" is the gentle, funny story of Jean Pargetter and Lionel Hardcastle, two people who used to be in love in the early fifties. When Lionel went off to fight in the Korean War, the two lost touch. They meet again 38 years later, quite by accident, and what is at first an awkward friendship slowly morphs into a warm romance.
""You Must Remember This"" is a retrospective one hour episode which originally aired in the UK in August, 2002. The final season had just finished airing, and this 'look back' was thought of as a good way to send-off the series. It doesn't, for the most part, disappoint. Many of the series' highlights are shown, and it all makes for nice, sentimental viewing.
The set-up for ""You Must Remember This"" is that Jean & Lionel are now alone in their Holland Park house (daughter Judith has married and moved out, and lodger Sandy has left for Canada with her fiance). It is suggested that Lionel write a book about his life/romance since being re-introduced to Jean at the beginning of the series. We see the couple going about their day, discussing their life together, and this of course segues into flashbacks from previous episodes. A good cross-section of clips are used, and things are covered such as: Jean & Lionel's first tentative steps when they were re-starting their romance, their first adult kiss on the banks of a river, the moment when Lionel proposes to Jean, the time when they both decide to dance to a waltz in the kitchen of a meeting hall, and of course the marriage of Judith & Alistair. There were a few moments from the series which were not included, that I wish would have been, but overall I have no real qualms with the retrospective.
Bonus episodes are included on this DVD version of ""You Must Remember This"", including the one where Lionel finds the long-lost letter which he sent to Jean while he was in Korea. It is one of the best episodes of the series. I love ""As Time Goes By"". There are very few TV series that I can say that about - less than I can count on one hand - but this is one of them. The writing is always impeccable, the acting superb, and the stories warm and funny. This retrospective does a wonderful job of capturing everything that made this series such a viewing pleasure. It is a must for anyone's ""As Time Goes By"" collection.",1058400000,240,2322,4.491725768321513

I'm on a free trial with Amazon Prime and watched several episodes of the series, but when I went in to watch more it was and is unavailable which upset me to no end.

Fate brings Gene and Lionell back together after 38 years in this lovely and comical story about a later romance that never unkindled.",1424476800,,500,4.164948453608248

1850162,5,B00008L3PB,I enjoy British comedies very much such as Doc Martin and Reggie Perrin and this did not disappoint.  I wish their 'series' were longer and more often but I think it helps keep it fresh every time.  The relationships explored in As Time Goes By (and others) is quite subtle compared to American sitcoms.  You can enjoy the show for the half hour or hour and feel content when it's over.,1411084800,2,386,4.408450704225352

1850170,5,B00008L3PB,"Being old, I can appreciate a series about older people. Always loved Geoffrey Palmer, from BUTTERFLIES on. Judi Dench I saw in an unforgettable Anthony and Cleopatra in London opposite Anthony Hopkins. But everybody is good, the actors who play Alistair, Steven, Rocky, the women who play Penny, fabulous! Mrs. Bale....Only the Sandy character is terrible. Both script wise and the actress who only has one facial expression throughout the long series. But can't spoil my enjoyment. And the sausage joke from the Fawlty Towers episode that Palmer was on is alluded to a number of times...still funny.",1397520000,,601,5.142857142857143
1850171,3,B00008L3PB,"Basically, this DVD is series i /episode 3, 3/2, and 6/7, each very nice, but you don't need it if you have the whole of all. The first is the beginning of their reunion, the second when they take part in another wedding, the third a search for ways to keep the thrill, ending with a fortunate discovery. This might be good to get someone interested in the show, but you really need the whole collection to enjoy the great story that it becomes. This might be called a Sampler.",1393891200,4,477,4.311111111111111

1850223,4,B00008L3PB,"This delightful series was my sinful little dalliance during my lunches, this past winter. I would curl up on my couch, before going to work, and watch an episode. I selfishly stretched out the shows, as much as I could.  I simply loved the characters, the humor and the sense of extended family.
This collection is definitely for the over 50 crowd. It is so nurturing.
By American standards, the characters are not, at first glance, beautiful, by any means of the word, and then they grow on you..Their beauty shines from within. I wanted to be a part of their lives. When the series was over, I wanted to start it again, but I will give myself a year, or so. Definitely a series for your collection, to watch in your doddering old age.
Love comes around a second, and a third time. It is always a precious experience. Indulge in Jean and Lionel's love story. You will hardly regret it!",1235865600,,887,4.4753086419753085

1850231,5,B00008L3PB,"If you have followed this series on your local PBS station from 1992-2002, or on DVD from 2002 to the present, you will enjoy this show.  It's roughly an hour in length (most PBS stations show it for 90 minutes to 2 hours to milk the pledge drives) making it equal in length to 2 episodes, featuring Lionel (Geoffrey Palmer) and Jean (Judi Dench) now in an empty apartment deciding what's next (pardon my West Wing) while flashing back to some of there most memorable moments of the series.  Also included are 3 episodes from other discs, the episode from Series 1 where Lionel and Jean spend their first weekend together and find the old inn where they first loved, the episode from Series 3 when Lionel's father Rocky and his long time love Madge get married, and Jean and Lionel are in the ceremony, and the last episode of Series 6 when Lionel surprises Jean with a trip to Barbados to help her recover from a dull week at the office (at the time this disc was released, this episode had NOT been released on DVD, as it came out between the releases of Series 5 and 6).  The bad side is with the release of the Series 8&9 2 bagger on August 30th, this episode will be included with the Series 9 disc (According to ""my spies"" (sorry Jim Perry), series 9 only had 4 episodes not counting this one).  So realistically (as of Labor Day) with the entire series available on 11 discs, in 4 2 disc sets and 3 single disc sets, or an attractive 11 piece megaset (coming out the same day as the last set), this disc becomes simply window dressing.  Of course until the 8&9 2 bagger's picture was displayed (just today), there was no way to know, so many people (me included) bought this when it was first available.  My advice, if you have none of the other discs, buy the 11 bagger.  If you have some of the others, finish your colllection with the other ""complete series"" titles, and you will get this when you get the 8&9 2 bagger.  This way you save duplicating 4 (counting this one) episodes.",1118361600,72,1992,4.37940379403794

It does, however, contain an episode (the one where Jean wants a surprise, and Lionel plans to take her to Barbados) which is particularly funny. Still, I was hoping for more.

7985074,5,B00008L3PB,"Had purchased this once before, and loaned it out.  No return.  Ordered again as I really loved it.  (Had seen it on TV initially, and wanted to see it from beginning to end.)

Love all the actors, the story line, the humor ... It's a relaxing place to revisit, ... to watch marvelous actors draw you in to their lives.",1506384000,2,319,4.266666666666667
7985075,5,B00008L3PB,"Love this show!  Have the boxed set - which brings me to my review.

Please note that if you have the boxed set (As Time Goes By: Complete Original Series), this show is included on the last disc.

I read the description thinking it was a show with flashback commentary from the cast but it is a normal flashback show with clips from the series. (Which is fine by me as I don't mind watching 'em twice.. )",1505433600,3,405,4.166666666666667

7985077,5,B00008L3PB,"While this is certainly not for everyone, for those who like gentle, romantic stories, this is perfect.  This is worth watching, while it highlights a few episodes, it is a great follow up to the original TV series.  Very funny in places and touching and just like life should be.",1497657600,,280,4.58
