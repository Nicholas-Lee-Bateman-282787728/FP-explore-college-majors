706081,5,6303686842,"This film is very often forgotten when you make the whole account of the great American films in any age. Artur Penn made a superb sociological portrait about the chase and wishes of revenge of the crowd with interesting insights and serious connotations. This film threw the ring to Robert Redford and gave Brando another opportunity to play an unusual and magnificent role.

And despite the multiple problems among Penn and the illumination supervisor according to Penn told in an interview with James Lipton in Inside the Actor's Studio, the film deserves a special place in the reduced golden list of the great American artistic triumphs.",1107820800,5,642,5.056603773584905
706082,4,6303686842,"I realize I gave this flick 4 stars--but I also have to say that Brando gets the highest rating of 5 stars. This film could have been greater than it was...and it just may bother you for that reason. One of my problems is that it was shot on some studio backlot (probably Universal, as the set looks a lot like the set used for Back to the Future) the other weakness is Robert Redford. You want to see how great Brando was in everything he did? Just try to compare what he does with what others do? Your eyes are always drawn to him, no matter who else is in the scene with the guy--and this film had an all-star cast, too......
The other thing that bugged me about this picture is just this: could a punk breaking out of prison (as does the Redford character in the film) by the name of ""Bubber"" Reeves (who ends up being falsely accused of murder) cause so much turmoil and havoc in a redneck town like this? (Blame it on the screenwriters... Never read the novel the movie was based on, so can't comment on that aspect of it.)
My other complaint is also with the director, Arthur Penn. Someone else should have directed this thing--don't ask who, maybe someone like Kazan (who reportedly turned it down).
First saw this thing in the sixties in Chicago as a teen, and the damn picture, or rather the Brando character stayed with me all these years. He plays a decent man trying to do the right thing in a rinky-dink redneck Texas town, does his best to protect the Reeves character from the moronic townsfolk who are eager to ""lynch"" him without a trial even.
 Checked the DVD out the night BEFORE Brando passed away, not sure why, just to see if the flick had withstood the test of time. Well, as you know, Brando passed on the very next day...and it left me, as it did so many others, plenty bummed out. I doubt we'll ever see another like him. So many actors try to duplicate what he did (and so often it is in your face obvious and pathetic) and all it does is makes you ache for the original (in order to take a second look at what the real thing was like.) This is why I had rented the DVD, as well as others over the years with Brando, because most actors don't even come close.
Anyway, I gave The Chase four stars, felt about it as I did back in the 60's: Brando great, but the telling of the tale troubling ( maybe over the top/over-produced; too much plot for what should have remained a far simpler story).
I'll say it again: should have never been made on fake studio sets. The writers tried to do too much with too many characters, etc. Probably would have worked better had it been shot in black and white, the way they did with The Last Picture Show (and they would have had a better movie than the vastly overrated Last Picture Show.)
See it for Brando as Sheriff Calder. The gifted Marlon Brando lives on.",1089158400,28,2824,4.2785046728971965

706222,3,6303686842,"Imagine if you had the following line up in a film: Marlon Brando, Robert Redford, Jane Fonda, E.G. Marshall, Angie Dickinson and Robert Duvall. This film did indeed have that cast. In addition to that the film was written by Lillian Helmond based on the book and play by Horton Foote and directed by Arthur Penn who would direct BONNIE AND CLYDE the following year. With all that talent combined why isn't this film more well-known or discussed?

A lot of that could be due to the story itself. The base of the story does seem interesting but the way its handled here, major talent involved in its writing or not, it plays more like a soap opera than an action film which was how it was marketed. A great trailer can make a movie but if you don't deliver what you promise an audience will remember.

The story revolves around a small Texas town that is run by and basically owned by the Rogers family. Convict Charlie Bubber Reeves (Redford) has escaped with another con and is heading for Mexico. His partner kills a man, steals his car and leaves Bubber to fend for himself.

Back in town Val Rogers (Marshall) is about to celebrate his 60th birthday. The employees at the bank toast him while the wife of milquetoast and bank VP Edwin Stewart (Duvall) watches as his flirtatious wife Emily (Janice Rule) confronts Val about why she and her husband are never invited to his parties. Emily is the catalyst for much that happens in the film, a woman intent of stirring the pot, having an affair with Edwins married co-worker Damon (Richard Bradford) and spending as much time with a bottle as a person can without passing out.

Vals son has his own situation to deal with. Unhappily married for the sake of his father, Jake (James Fox) has been having an affair with Anna (Fonda), the wife of Bubber. The entire town, with the exception of his father, is well aware of the affair but no one speaks up.

In the middle of all of this is the local Sheriff Calder (Brando). Living in his office above the jail with his wife Ruby (Dickinson) Calder is intent on doing his job. The job was given to him by Val and for that reason many who are considered a class beneath Val look unfavorably on Calder, seeing him as a hired hand rather than a lawman. What they don't realize is that Calder is indeed a man of integrity, a man whose soul will be eaten by both classes before the end of the film.

More time is spent with the whole set up of the town, a dissection of the characters who make up this city and its various classes. There is the upper crust, donating millions to the building of a college Val has high hopes for. There is the middle class, the hard partying drinking revelers on a Saturday night who resent the Rogers family while working for them none the less. There are the blacks in the town who, being in the mid-sixties still, now have rights but rarely have anyone to defend those rights for them. And finally there are the teens, bound and determined to follow in the footsteps of their parents, hard partying and drinking all the way.

The ins and outs of these groups, who is sleeping with whom, develop more tension than the chase for Bubber. In thinking back we get a better glimpse of these people, their lives and their interactions than we do Bubber. Eventually Bubber is given a chance to speak about the injustices of this town and the people in it, but thats more of a speech than character development.

As various members of the town get drunker as the night goes on, as their resentments begin to surface thanks to the alcohol, tension builds and confrontations begin. Calder is assaulted by a group of Rogerss employees, not because they want to help their boss but because they resent him. Beaten and bloody he still attempts to find and save Bubber before this group can get their hands on him.

In watching the movie it was entertaining enough but felt too long to reach the end. Brando gives a decent performance, Redford does what he can with the part, Fonda isn't on screen nearly as much as you would expect and no one really stands out. Reading about the film later I discovered that the story had failed as a book and play and the movie didn't fare much better when it was released. Producer Sam Spiegel wanted a message movie, director Penn wanted a more straight forward approach and in the end Spiegel took over and cut the film the way he wanted. Penn eventually disowned the film. Hellman, who was friends with Penn, blamed him for the way it turned out and the two parted on bad terms.

Fans of the actors involved or of Penn will want to check the film out just to see how they do here. If you like movies like PEYTON PLACE then youll find plenty to enjoy. But for most it will not be a fan favorite. The movie is being released by Twilight Time so the usual applies here, limited number of copies and few extras but a glorious looking print involved.",1479772800,,4896,4.442093541202673

706225,4,6303686842,"Okay lets go by the numbers here. Take a play about small town oil boom town 1960s Texas by the great Texas novelist Horton Foote (okay, okay maybe not the greatest that title would have to go Larry McMurtry in his prime with The Last Picture Show). Throw in a screenplay by Lillian Hellman who despite her inability to tell a politically truthful statement back in her Stalinist sympathizer days could write excellent screenplays-just ask Dashiell Hammett. Add in a great and thoughtful director Arthur Penn (who later expressed dissatisfaction with the results of the film). Top off with a whole crew of young up and coming actors like Robert Redford, Jane Fonda, Angie Dickerson, and Robert Duvall, who were still hungry (and a well-known one in Marlon Brando when he still had a hungry edge). Result a pretty good sleeper film from the 1960s The Chase which I am surprised I did not see back in the day but which sticks out as ensemble cast film from an age when such melodramas would be too over-played.

Funny this film could be called The Chasers since it is much about the sordid, dysfunctional, sometimes comic life styles of the towns residents as about the guy being chased. That guy Bubber (played by a very young Robert Redford who frankly did not, does not fit the category of Bubba when you think about that good old boy type) who escaped the state penal farm with another con who had gotten frisky with a guy they were trying to rob and killed him so the escape turned into felony murder thus creating the chasers as Bubba headed back to town after being left behind high and dry by his fellow con and after striking out on his other options.

Naturally Bubbas movements are of great concern to the high sheriff,  Calder, played by Marlon Brando, to Bubbers young and attractive wife, Anna, played by Jane Fonda who while he was in stir was having an affair with the son of the local magnate banker, to that son Jake who was a friend of Bubbers from childhood, to that banker who was worried once he found out that his son was having an affair with Anna, to one of that bankers Walter Mitty employees, played by Robert Duvall, who ratted him out when they were kids, to his distraught parents worried that the sheriff will shoot first and ask questions later, and to half the townships population worried that Bubber will come back and seek revenge for any hurts imposed on him. Will wild out on them and their comforts mainly drinking too much booze, rousting blacks, and having a confusing set of sexual affairs for which one would need a scorecard-if one were interested.

Although Sheriff Calder tried might and main to impose the sense of the rule of law on the angry, scared and drunk townspeople who in the end turned into just another vicious mob bent on vigilante justice that drunken mob got out hand and Bubber got a few slugs and his face down right on his hometown street. Some of this one is a little too melodramatic especially the casual sex-capades thrown around during the nights drinking bouts but overall the film gave an interesting slice of life in the golden age of the oil boom down in oil fields Texas.",1472342400,,3143,4.577264653641207

706429,5,6303686842,"For some reason this movie is only rarely shown on television even though it has one of the greatest casts ever assembled.
Marlon Brando plays the reluctant, disillusioned, sheriff of a small southern town where the townsfolk party like maniacs and have so little respect for the law that several of them enjoy beating up the sheriff within an inch of his life. So many of the men in the town are rabid racists that it is uncomfortable and disturbing to watch at times. Pretty boy Robert Redford as ""Bubba Reeves"" escapes from prison, but he somehow never looks very uncomfortable, even though he has nothing but the prison clothes on his back. Come on Mr. Redford, at least get a little dirty and hungry once in a while! The crazy out of control townsfolk make a party and a celebration of hunting down the escaped convict. They bring so many roman candles to the huge junkyard of wrecked cars where ""Bubba"" is hiding that it is turned into a giant inferno. That is pretty exciting to watch. Those people are quite immoral and lecherously chase each other's wives around during a wild drunken decadent party.

706631,5,6303686842,"Sam Spiegel's film of Horton Foote's 1952 play ""The Chase"" was very much anticipated in 1966 when it was released as it boasted a script by Lillian Hellman and starred Marlon Brando in addition to Jane Fonda, Robert Redford, E.G. Marhsall, James Fox, Angie Dickinson, Janice Rule, Miriam Hopkins, Martha Hyer, Robert Duvall, Richard Bradford and many other notables including everyone's favorite (mature) teen-ager, Paul Williams.  Spiegel had just produced David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (who must really take credit for that film's ultimate triumph, but for ""The Chase"" Spiegel had Arthur Penn directing who still had not proven himself having directed ""The Miracle Worker"", but his work on ""Mickey One"" was critically applauded but misunderstood and ""Bonnie and Clyde"" with Warren Beatty was still to come.  Because there was a chance for failure, I understood the film's final cut was by the studio.  It may not be the best John Barry score, but I think it still needs to be given a chance.  It barely intrudes on the narrative, which, as written by Hellman, draws on some powerful emotions of hate, disgust and all the potential of the human spirit to bring itself down to the devil's dues.  There is a long excerpt from Barry's score at the end of the film as exit music that should be available on CD as it needs to heard repeatedly than after seeing the entire film and then being graced with the themes.  I did not see the ending coming, although the character of ""Bubba"" (Redford) sees ""his own end"" from the very beginning actually, although I think some of the acting is so ""to the hilt"" like Janice Rule and Martha Hyer, it becomes melodramatic (especially Miriam Hopkins, who has appeared in some role in every film version of Hellman's ""The Children's Hour"").  Redford, Fonda and Fox provide an admiral trio, it's too bad they were given more of the emphasis than the townspeople.  But then, it is really Brando's picture and his upright and disillusioned sheriff, overcome by lawlessness in the townsfolk ignites the screen with a power, and bravura acting including Dickinson, that adds a complementary balance to the film's message.  Arthur Penn soon after became something of an auteur in less than a year with ""Bonnie and Clyde"" receiving another AAN (he had received one for ""The Miracle Worker"") and then again for ""Alice's Restaurant.""  Sam Spiegel lined up another fabulous cast in also 1967 for ""The Happening"" (not released on home video) starring Anthony Quinn, Michael Parks, George Maharis, Robert Walker, Jr., Faye Dunaway, Martha Hyer, Oscar Homolka and Milton Berle directed by Elliot Silverstein (Cat Ballou"").  That had the great theme song sung by the Supremes.  Now, more than ever, needs a DVD release.

706634,3,6303686842,"Arthur Penn had an especial eye for the minutia of American life and this is particularly true of this film. The obvious massive gap between the rich - the world of Val Rogers played by the great E.G. Marshall - and the poor such as the Mexican cheap labour, the African-Americans - is manifest. But the image of a very big American automobile - known in Australia as a Yank tank - driving down the dirt road of the centre of this southern town by the son of the richest man in town, reveals the problem facing the USA where private wealth lives and plays among public squalor so tellingly pointed up and studied by Mr Galbraith in his book The Affluent Society. Indeed, it's no stretch to suggest that the seeds of the American demise, or at least, the waning of the American Empire, is everywhere evident in this fine film. The dentists' convention, the birthday party, the housing of the poor, the businesses, the adulteries, all point to a society more or less corrupt and corrupting.
As well,put aside if you will, the mannered acting of Mr Brando, and focus on the depth of talent that is everywhere apparent even in the smallest parts.

Luckily, a simple TV-color adjustment can do wonders - thereby downplaying the obvious use of Hollywood backlots while emphasizing the stark contrast among the numerous small-town characters (too many for the film's own good). Marlon Brando gives one of his few outstanding 1960s performances in a fine ensemble cast. Despite its production problems and excessive length, ""The Chase"" holds up surprisingly well.",1344643200,2,669,5.568627450980392
706737,1,6303686842,"About an hour and a half into the film, the story starts. ""A breathless, explosive story?"" This movie doesn't explode, it implodes.

For all it's stars and legendary talent -- Sam Spiegel producing, Lillian Hellman writing, Arthur Penn directing, John Barry score -- The Chase is an incoherent mess, and the problem is in the script, which goes off in way too many directions at once. All the great talent and money are there on the screen, but it doesn't gel. Somehow the strong auteur vision is missing. And the liberal themes come across as cliched and phony.

The ""meaningful"" exposition about the escaped ""Bubba"" character (Redford) happens in dialogue, not through action, which is among the most burdensome aspects of this movie -- a royal disconnect between action and dialogue. The story takes place in Texas but is mostly shot on the studio backlots. Every one of the mainstream Hollywood actors has to affect a Texas accent, to varying degrees of failure. Every one of them is miscast, starting, of course, with Redford, who is too handsome to ever escape prison successfully. Brando does a fine job as the sheriff, but still the script doesn't give him free reign to be at his best.

And who hired John Barry to score this movie? It's not just the Texas story, which calls for some country flavor which Barry cannot deliver. I am a huge fan of John Barry, but a John Barry score with Redford or Brando on the screen is just plain WRONG.

There are too many characters, too many story lines to follow. The writer overloads us with too much material, and as a result we never get to focus on one or even two people for more than 4 minutes at a stretch.

I conclude that the legendary producer Sam Spiegel, fresh off his monumentally successful project, Lawrence of Arabia, felt he could do no wrong. As such, he tried to make The Chase into an epic story along the same lines of Lawrence of A, when it would have better been executed on a smaller and more intimate scale.

But if you want to see Robert Redford just prior to his home run performance in Butch Cassidy, see this film. If you want to see Arthur Penn fail as a director just before he made Bonnie and Clyde, see this film. If you want to hear a lousy John Barry score just after he worked on Goldfinger and Thunderball, see this film. If you want to see Jane Fonda just before she and Redford became famous in Barefoot in the Park, see this film. If you want to see Brit James Fox try to play a Texas oilman, see this film.  If you want to see Brando and Duvall before they made The Godfather, see this film.

""I'm telling you Spiegel, it can't miss!"" Sam Spiegel thought this was going to be a huge hit. But he put it all together and it failed miserably...a production executive's worst nightmare.

706739,5,6303686842,"The Chase is an excellent early film of Arthur Penn and every scene is imbued with intelligence. The story is simple:prison escapee Bubber Reeves(Robert Redford) returns to his home town in search of shelter and justice,and manages, on the night of a community convention,to stir up a tsunami of guilt,corruption,lust,betrayal and violence,lurking not far beneath the surface. Penn imbues the story with a clarity and depth of vision to give it a mythic resonance as well as contemporary relevance. Brando was never better as a conscientious public servant.

Based on a play by Horton Foote,The Chase offers Penn's vision of a modern capitalist society in which the norm is victimization and greed,and the superficial mores and codes governing ""polite behaviour ""are simply for show. There is a constant tension between surface and reality,and as the film progresses,the strict social distinctions and structures witnessed simultaneously in 3 parties(those of Val,the Stewarts and the teenagers) begin to corrode, until at the end anarchy reigns as order breaks down completely (appropriately in a central junkyard).A sense of violence seething under the skin of a community is palpable,Penn's close work with the actors subtly revealing their characters in evidence.

Redford lying tired and soaked on a river bank after his arduous escape excitedly miming the act of shooting geese,or the fidgeting,uncomfortable manner of Sheriff Calder(Marlon Brando)in his formal attire for the convention(after we have seen him rigorously and lengthily get himself ready).This is a moral film,engaging with the whole concept of morality and human experience,uneasy bedfellows. It succeeds in conveying the immediacy and primacy of violence and social conflict. Penn never looks down on his characters nor lectures. He understands the source of violence,what its costs and effects areand he burns in the flames with the rest of us.

For most of the filming, Redford/Bubber was distant from the other actors and production. Most of his scenes involved shooting on location showing him running through the swamps and marshes making his way back to his hometown after the prison break. This distance of his character, since he is such a centerpiece of speculation and turmoil for the other cast members, creates a distance from the film's story to the audience. To to make this story work, it needed to be told in a non-linear fashion. The audience needed to see flash-backs to when Bubber Reeves was in town and what led up to his frame up for murder and arrest.

However, there is a movie similar to this one, and that's the Miramax teen porn movie ""Kids"". The plots seem similar in the sense that everyone feels that they're indestructable, and that they don't have to answer to anyone. Now that I've gotten that out of the way back to my original statement. If there had to be a remake of this movie I'd make it even more darker than the 1966 version. Mind you not to where there was gore, and demons chasing people around, but where there was total lawlessness in this small town. For starters have the sherrif's wife killed, or so it seems by the vigilante townsmen right alongside with the black man, then where Bubber gets killed when the townsmen start to assult the sherrif have the sherrif kill all 3 townsmen who started the trouble in the first place. Then have the sherrif rip the clothes off the one party hearty woman, and kidnap her to the local motel, and break her spirit. Don't show the real hardcore rape of her, but give the implications that she's been seriously violated, and then have the sherrif go through the town branding his own version of justice as the fires are going have him shoot and kill some of the teenagers who saw the adults causing trouble, so they figured...well we can do this too, and the other party hearty girl hack her long hair off with a machete. Then bring in the surprise where the sherrif's wife is not dead, but just wounded, but enough to where she can go, and try to calm down her husband. The finale have it where the sherrif is found guilty...but mentally ill, and have committed to a insane asylum. Never again to be a sherrif. The ending keep it as is because it had a strong moment of where the mayor laments over what happened with Bubber's wife. Mind you this is a little more graphic, and they may have to give it a NC-21 rating, but like I said don't put the graphic sex scene in the movie. Have it where the woman is trying to calm down the sherrif, and then when the sherrif makes a grab for her fast cut to the outside of the motel with the woman making a blood-curdling scream...with some heavy loud music. Then cut back into the room with it almost pitch-black, and here have some cymbal and maybe some gong playing as you show the woman crying softly in the background, and the sherrif going through his transformation. The songs for this segment I would recommend ""L America"" from the Doors, and ""Genesis"" from Tangerine Dream. Another song I'd recommend where the sherrif hacks off the long hair with the machete ""Golden Glass"" from The Misunderstood. Finally at the end with the closing credits ""Ghetto Nation"" from Warrior Soul. Dark enough for you all? Well I found the 66 version to be rather graphic, and not for the innocent. It was a tough piece of film, and to do it more justice make it even darker, and more sociopathic, but not with some graphic explicit sex, but make it seem like that's what's happening, but implied.

Marlon Brando plays the sheriff who tries to track down Bubbers whereabouts while Angie Dickinson is on hand as his supportive wife. Jane Fonda plays Bubbers ex-girlfriend and James Fox her secret beau. Janice Rule appears as a drunken woman of dubious morality, Robert Duvall her hubby and Richard Bradford one of the men with whom she cheats. E.G. Marshall is on hand as the town mogul. Look for a young Paul Williams as one of the partying teens (hes easy to spot).

The Chase is mid-60s Southern Gothic in the manner of The Fugitive Kind (1960), In the Heat of the Night (1967), Cape Fear (1962), This Property Is Condemned (1966) and The Long, Hot Summer (1958). Its arguably on par with most of these, but is significantly superior to the last one. The first act is weak as it establishes the characters, but the story becomes captivating starting with the second act and the surreal drunken party at the moguls mansion (and the teens in a neighboring abode). Imagine if Village of the Giants (1965) was shot as a serious melodrama, minus the giants, and thats the general vibe.

The movie addresses elements of hedonistic revelry, racism, sexual revolution (several of the players are involved in affairs), political corruption (the sheriff is wrongly thought to be bought by the mogul), and vigilante non-justice. The most iconic scene is when the sole voice of reason is viciously beaten by the character played by Bradford, along with his buds. Marlon later cited this as an example of his renowned Method approach. The wild last act in an auto graveyard is also iconic.

Despite the pictures many strengths, its too meandering and unfocused to be wholly effective, as was Penns great Bonnie and Clyde (1967). But you cant beat the cast, especially Brando.

Hot Toasty Rag, September 30, 2017

What starts as a simple prison break turns into an incredibly tense emotional thriller in The Chase. With an all-star cast and a perfectly eerie tone set by director Arthur Penn, youll be kept on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

Robert Redford and his cellmate break out of prison, but when his cellmate kills a man and flees the scene, everyone thinks Robert Redford is the murderer! He tries to make his way back to town to see his wife, but when the town residents get wind of his plan, they all panic. E.G. Marshall, a very important figure, is worried about his sons safety, since hes having an affair with Redfords wife, Jane Fonda. Robert Duvall, whose wife is having an affair with Richard Bradford, is worried because he knows a secret about Redfords crime. Redfords parents, Miriam Hopkins and Malcom Atterbury, feel guilty about not hiring him a lawyer before. Ken Renard knows where he is, and knows hell get harassed because of it. And finally, Marlon Brando, the sheriff, tries in vain to keep the peace.

Lillian Hellmans script, based on Horton Footes play, is very well-written, with plenty of characters to root for and against. Marlon Brandos character is by far the most interesting and likable, and even though he isn't usually cast in peace-keeper roles, hes very convincing as hes pulled by all sides and still tries to maintain law and order. This is a pretty heavy movie, so be prepared. Theres infidelity, violence, and racial harassment. But if you tend to like dramatic films from the 1960s, rather than the fluffy ones, youll probably enjoy The Chase.",1506729600,,1648,4.735191637630662

7853086,5,6303686842,"English is not my native language, so I was not a fan of American movies until the late '60s. Of the few that I saw, it was Robert Redford who fascinated me and I instantly fell in love with him in ""This Property is Condemned.""

Later I came upon a very old musical, ""Guys and Dolls"" and fell in love with Marlon Brando.  I simply couldn't believe that once upon a time this great mumbling and brooding actor could sing, dance, and romance.

Now that my English seems to be improving in leaps and bounds, I had to check out English films as well.  So I did and instantly fell in love with the young hot James Fox in ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines."" (Magnificent Men remains my most favorite ""feel-good"" movie of all time.)

Imagine my delight when I discovered ""The Chase"" where all three of my beloved male stars are in the cast!  How can I not give it five stars?

Well, okay. To be honest, I don't know what to make of the story.  It's a Greek drama with at least two separate unhinged Greek choruses bent on destroying the tragic hero, the sheriff.

It's a soap opera of a tepid love triangle with a double ""deus ex machina"" escape.

It's a morality play of lawlessness, corruption, racism, adultery, phariseeism, mob rule, unfair labor practices, failed redemption, and paternal and maternal loves -  portrayed by a slew of unevenly developed, improbable characters. (But I do like that it all happened in one day.)

Somehow, to tie these desparate ingredients together, a disaster of epic magnitude had to be concocted, and it did.  It would have been more satisfying if everyone died in the end.

Redford's character is an escaped prisoner trying to get home - for what?  To check on his wife who is having an affair with his best friend?  Yet on confrontation, he expresses no outrage.  An escaped prisoner yet he remains clean-shaven the entire time and with his well-groomed blond hair glistening in the dark!

Brando is understated and ever so delicious.  His character is well-formed as befitting a hero.  This is probably one of his best films.

But my biggest delight is the young James Fox and his interpretation of an aristocratic Texas American accent. Somewhere in the movie, I gathered that his character was sent abroad for his education, an attempt to explain his elegant bearing and the way he talks.  His friendship with the Jane Fonda and Robert Redford characters is not too convincing (blame the plot), but he did his best.

Nevertheless, to see Brando, Redford, and Fox all together makes this film worth watching.  But maybe it's just me.

English is not my native language, so I was not a fan of American movies until the late '60s. Of the few that I saw, it was Robert Redford who fascinated me and I instantly fell in love with him in ""This Property is Condemned.""

Later I came upon a very old musical, ""Guys and Dolls"" and fell in love with Marlon Brando.  I simply couldn't believe that once upon a time this great mumbling and brooding actor could sing, dance, and romance.

Now that my English seems to be improving in leaps and bounds, I had to check out English films as well.  So I did and instantly fell in love with the young hot James Fox in ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines."" (Magnificent Men remains my most favorite ""feel-good"" movie of all time.)

Imagine my delight when I discovered ""The Chase"" where all three of my beloved male stars are in the cast!  How can I not give it five stars?

Well, okay. To be honest, I don't know what to make of the story.  It's a Greek drama with at least two separate unhinged Greek choruses bent on destroying the tragic hero, the sheriff.

It's a soap opera of a tepid love triangle with a double ""deus ex machina"" escape.

It's a morality play of lawlessness, corruption, racism, adultery, phariseeism, mob rule, unfair labor practices, failed redemption, and paternal and maternal loves -  portrayed by a slew of unevenly developed, improbable characters. (But I do like that it all happened in one day.)

Somehow, to tie these desparate ingredients together, a disaster of epic magnitude had to be concocted, and it did.  It would have been more satisfying if everyone died in the end.

Redford's character is an escaped prisoner trying to get home - for what?  To check on his wife who is having an affair with his best friend?  Yet on confrontation, he expresses no outrage.  An escaped prisoner yet he remains clean-shaven the entire time and with his well-groomed blond hair glistening in the dark!

Brando is understated and ever so delicious.  His character is well-formed as befitting a hero.  This is probably one of his best films.

But my biggest delight is the young James Fox and his interpretation of an aristocratic Texas American accent.
