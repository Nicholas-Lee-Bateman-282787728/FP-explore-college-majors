While the content is adequate to interesting, you'd be better off tracking these down on YouTube, which is what it looks like the producers of this disk did. The image quality is so low-rez that the chunkiness and artifacts are really obvious on a TV screen or computer monitor. Historically, it's worth the money but the image quality is so poor that I'd recommend you find other sources.",1258761600,,483,4.627906976744186
