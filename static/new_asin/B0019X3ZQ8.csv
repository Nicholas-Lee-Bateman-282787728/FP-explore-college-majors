Just as a note: many sites are wrong about box set two being dubbed. Media Blasters did dub the first box set, but they did not do the second due to cost concerns and lower than expected sales for the GaoGaiGar series (which, in my opinion they did very little advertising for compared to the media blitz for Voltron).

So if you love it subtitled both sets are perfect! If you prefer a good dub (which MB did on the first set-it's one of the best dubs ever) box one will tickle you, but box two isn't dubbed so take that into consideration.",1235692800,3,665,4.1875
3444751,5,B0019X3ZQ8,"Perhaps like me you have read the declarations online and in print of how GaoGaiGar is one of the best Mecha shows in existence. And perhaps also like me you rented or bought the first half of the show and were left wondering what they were talking about. Granted, the first half of the series has nice animation, good main characters, and a fantastic orchestral score. It's also essentially the same battles over and over again, to the point of monster-of-the-week overload. And then a very pleasant surprise.

 This boxed set picks up just before the final battle of the first story arc. And a very nice battle it is, with GaoGaiGar having quite a showdown with Pizza of the four Machine Kings (yeah, so the name sounds ridiculous in English). And just when the last of the Zonders that have been harassing our heroes for so long are finally defeated, a new threat emerges that makes all the previous ones look like a walk in the park.

 The 31 Primitives are basically the Zonder Masters, each one with a different strength that corresponds to a different part of the body. Naturally this leads to lots of fights just like the first half of the show, but the big difference here is that Pizza, before he was brainwashed into a Zonder General, was a warrior for the anti-zonder forces that fought an ancient war against them. And when he's reawakened as the man he was before, things go all Harlock (if you've never seen Arcadia of My Youth then think Alex Row from Last Exile or Captain Nemo from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea). So basically he went from being a rough enemy who was really really fast to the captain of a giant space battleship that transforms! Along for the ride is one of the pint-sized green-haired hero's classmates, who like him also has mysterious anti-zonder powers.

 What all of this means for you is that the show takes a major turn for the serious at this point, and comes to greatly resemble anime like Macross and Arcadia of My Youth in tone in parts, as the former Pizza (now calling himself King J-Der) takes on the forces of evil alongside GaoGaiGar.

 The best part is undoubtedly the end of the series, where all questions are answered and a massive showdown takes place at Jupiter between all the heroes and every one of the Primitives combined. The explanation that the two kids with powers are the last of an ancient race, and that the one was the hope of his people and the other a weapon created to fight Zonders is the stuff that fanboys live for. Combine that with the death of Gai's father and his reuniting with his mother, and the death of King J-Der and the destruction of his battleship in the last desperate fight with the Zondarians, and you have one of the best Mecha show endings in history.

 All that was plenty and I would have been satisfied, but the soft ending of the final episode that shows us a new Zonder type with no purpose but to destroy all life, inhabiting one of the characters we care about most. The final, FINAL battle is the emotional high point of the show, with all of the robot heroes being destroyed and being uploaded into the parts of GaoGaiGar in order to help Gai. The battle between the two giant Mecha, wherein GaiGaiGar is destroyed piece by piece, blow by blow, ends with Gai walking up to the woman he loves as his robot body disintegrates and she begs him to kill her before the Zonder inside destroys the world. And then a miracle happens and we have the perfect ending. For people who have followed the story this far, it's a fitting end to the King of the Braves.",1231113600,,3553,4.4945736434108525
8275634,3,B0019X3ZQ8,The videos were only dubbed in Japanese w/English subtitles no English voiceover.,1446076800,,81,5.833333333333333
8275635,5,B0019X3ZQ8,Incredible Series. Note this box set is subtitled only. But no worries because the sub is absolutely killer. Anyone who hasn't seen Gaogaigar before needs to do themselves a favor and watch it. Highly recommended for giant robot fans.,1408320000,,234,5.0256410256410255
8275636,5,B0019X3ZQ8,One of my fav anime's. Looks and sounds nice!,1404086400,,45,4.111111111111111

8275638,5,B0019X3ZQ8,Very happy with my box set since it's one of my favorite animes. If you like mechs that transform this series is a must have for your collection!!,1363392000,,146,4.25
8275639,4,B0019X3ZQ8,"This second half begins with a battle against the villains, for these villains it's actually their last-ditch effort. Unsurprisingly, this battle gets exciting fast. The only bad thing here was after EI-01 appeared that part felt monotonous.

However once the second group of villains appears things get crazy, including... well, let's just say even robots with disks that power up their allies by playing the theme song eventually feel normal compared to later abilities displayed by heroes and villains. Somehow though it never becomes excessive or capable of alienating the audience.

All things considered, Gaogaigar might not be the fastest-moving series but once things get moving, they really get moving! If you're patient enough it's worth watching.",1301875200,,757,5.461538461538462
8275640,3,B0019X3ZQ8,"So I'm a big fan of Full Metal Panic and I've watched a number of other mecha anime. So I googled to try to find which mecha anime was highest rated among fans and this title came up.

Well I was a little disappointed. Its not a bad anime, but it's not what I was looking for. I think maybe if I was a lot younger (currently 31) then I would have loved it.",1300147200,,356,3.810810810810811
8275641,5,B0019X3ZQ8,"If you're a fan of Transformers or Brave, you will not be dissapointed. Fan service and mecha all around! the english dubb is ok, but the Japanese version is better. Hard to believe Hasbro hasn't imported the toys yet. Who doesn't love morphing robots?",1279065600,,252,4.75
8275642,5,B0019X3ZQ8,"yuusha oh gaogaigar would have to be one of the best out of the 8 brave saga titles (and not because of the monster budget the anime had during production) as others have stated other sites are wrong about the second half being dubbed which be it the fault of the other sites or media blasters itself this is still a great title for fans of the giant mecha/hot blooded mecha anime style. picking up where the first box set left off the second half picks up the pace a bit with story and characters, but unfortunately it's slightly hard to enjoy. doing a thurough review of the anime quality and the dvd quality I've to say this, the quality of the anime is great but the quality of the DVDs are Sub standard with video and audio quality equivalent to that of an Old Vhs tape rip. the anime is hard to enjoy if your a big audio/videophile and can't stand bad quality with video and audio. though this anime did come out originally in 97 it's not excusable for poor video and audio quality especially since other anime companies have been known to digitally repair the audio and video qualities or atleast clean it up a bit on classic titles that they've re-released, main issues with audio is that the volume shifts slightly throughout each episode or stays at a constant high while the video quality stays at a constant old Vhs quality. all that aside the king of braves gaogaigar is well worth anyone's time and adding to their collection, just wait for another anniversary re-release and hope for a different company doing a better dubbing and possibly the release and dubbing of the OVA sequel yuusha oh gaogaigar final. the main reason why I push the fact of a better dubbing was due to the fact that media blasters hired voice actors/actresses from 4kids which many anime fans know don't do high quality work so actually watching the dub of the first half is rather painful if your big on dubbing with most of the characters and voice actors/actresses mismatched or stereotypically casted the fact that media blasters didn't finish the dubbing should be looked at as both a blessing and a pain in the neck. if your impatient and wish to get this anime go ahead just don't hope for a DVD replacement plan from media blasters in case of defective DVDs in which case amazon will be your best bet since media blaster's doesn't even support the idea of a DVD replacement program let alone a free DVD replacement program unlike funimation and bandai

:one side note: you don't even need to be a big anime fan to tell that the voice actors are from 4kids just watch a dozen or so episodes of a 4kids dubbed anime or two then watch king of braves gaogaigar part one and you'll pick them out right away especially if you've watched the first season of pokemon and yu gi oh. all in all great title plenty of action, comedy, drama, and story but poor quality and a half @##ed job in dubbing along with audio and video quality while still worth adding to anyones anime collection",1257292800,,2972,4.503703703703704
8275643,4,B0019X3ZQ8,"I have been a big fan of Japanese animation for a long time, but this was always one fo my favorites. I'm glad I got a chance to get the series before it was gone. I have missed a few in the past thinking ""ill wait for it to go down in price"" Bad idea, my advice, if you like it, buy it before it gets away.
The voice acting is good in this series, the only thing I wish they did was subtitle the names of locations when they are splashed on the screen, other than that it was great.
And one last thing
