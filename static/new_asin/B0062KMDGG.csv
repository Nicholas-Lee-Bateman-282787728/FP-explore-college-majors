4932246,4,B0062KMDGG,"If you can get through the first 30-ish minutes of crude-ish, trite, teen-age drivel, you will find yourself immersed in a sweet, little love story.  The two lead actors (Britt Robertson as Aubrey and Dylan O'Brien as Dave) were superb.  Britt has a striking resemblance to and the feel of Renee Zellweger in this film and Dylan looks like my high school love.  Fortunately in this movie, the guy isn't a complete jerk.  The character of Dave is just what every girl wants to find and about 3% of girls find.  The character of Aubrey is pretty darn unrealistic, but charming nonetheless.

I was shocked that I fell in love with this movie, but I did.",1363219200,5,650,4.560344827586207

It the actors they are age appropriate for their roles and act amazingly, definitely going to see what other movies they are in because I enjoyed their acting that much!

The story line melted my heart in to goo at certain parts and others I was cringing for the character's embarassment. The film over all was a sweet romantic comedy and I'm definitely going to be rewatching this several times or any time I need a pick me up.",1363219200,,538,4.2745098039215685

I saw a GIF on Tumblr and through the comments, found the name of the movie. Being bored with nothing on the agenda for tonight, I rented it through Amazon with low expectations but figuring 'how bad can it be?'

Glad I did. It was interesting from the start, great chemistry between the actors, spot on with both the comedy and the teenaged awkwardness. All around, a great movie. I would definitely recommend this for a fun night at home and a walk down memory lane. Really good acting and a thoroughly entertaining (if a little predictable) execution.

4932253,4,B0062KMDGG,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***

Teen romantic comedies seem to be a dime a dozen.  It doesn't seem like too many fresh stories come along anymore that aren't filled with the typical clich&eacute;s.  But, sometimes when you are least expecting it, and you are resisting giving another teen comedy a chance, one surprises you.

The First Time is a little gem of a film that is intelligently written and directed by Jon Kasdan.  He provides us with an intriguing story with smart, every-day characters that we like.  The story is about two teens who arbitrarily meet at teen drunk-fest.  However, rather than being inside with all of the other kids, Dave (Dylan O'Brien) is outside in an alley practicing how he is going to share his longtime feelings with his friend Jane, who is basically worshiped by boys everywhere.  Through the door comes Aubrey (Britt Robertson) who obviously isn't into the party scene but was dragged there by her friends.  Suddenly, these two kids strike up a conversation.  The wonderful, and frankly, best part about this movie are the conversations that are shared between Dave and Aubrey throughout the film.  They discover that they have something in common, despite Dave's infatuation for Jane, and despite Aubrey's ""boyfriend.""

Aubrey is a girl with many ideas about life.  But, like a teenager, it's all theory and no experience.  This is not a slight against the character, but a realistic one, which is why the movie works so well.  She is an intelligent girl who isn't thrown into ideas of wild fancy.  She slights ""cheesy romance"" even though on some level, she likes it.  She hates PDA for the same reason.  She is inexperienced in the areas of romance and relationships, which obviously includes sex.  However, she has a certain wit and charm that makes her very likeable.  She is more guarded with her emotions than Dave.  It's a scary thing to let go of those walls long enough to let someone in; to risk getting hurt.

Dave is your ""good guy.""  However, he doesn't fit the typical mold of the ""nice guy"" by being some kind of a loser.  He's a cool guy too.  He is caring, and it becomes quickly obvious that he is falling for Aubrey.  He knows he has more in common with Aubrey than he ever would with Jane.  However, like Aubrey, Dave is also inexperienced.  Dave is a bit shy, but he opens up around Aubrey.

I like the fact that the friends of the main characters aren't clich&eacute;d either.  We expect Jane to be one of those typical stuck-up girls.  She knows she's attractive, but she also wonders why she can't seem to attract ""a real man"" as she confesses to Aubrey.  Jane isn't wise enough to realize that her best ""guy"" friend fits the mold to a T, and Aubrey nearly tells her this when she quickly bites her tongue.  Ronnie, however, is more in line with the typical unfeeling, uncaring boyfriend who is only interested in one thing.  He just doesn't get it.

The interesting thing about being a teenager is that they idolize and idealize a number of ""first time"" experiences.  Show me a teenager who doesn't dream and fantasize about things like the first kiss, the first time you make love, etc.  And, of course, when things don't pan out to their expectations, it's as if the world has conspired against them.  They quickly believe they have done something wrong, rather than understanding that it's really nothing more than a lack of knowledge and experience.  In other words, teenagers are great talkers about experiences, especially ones they have never had.  Life is often a journey of trial and error, and it is unfortunate that our kids often have to learn the hard way rather than have an understanding parent to enlighten them.  Of course, it would help if these teens would talk to their parents, but we understand the fears surrounding that.

After less than two days' time, Aubrey invites Dave over to her house when her parents are going out.  We all know what is going to happen.  However, the viewer may be surprised by what actually does happen.  Dave shows up.  The two get to the point where they are talking so much while they  are kissing, that it's painfully obvious, that they are about to hit that wall; the wall to which on the other side, lies the unknown.  There is an awkwardness that hits them both like a mack truck.  And why wouldn't it?  They are both aiming for perfection of experience and expression.  And yet, neither one knows how to go about it.  This is what parents mean when they ask their teenagers to ""wait until you are ready and you have the maturity to deal with what follows.""  The physical aspects are simple compared to the emotional aspects.  This is the area that befuddles teens and adults alike.  A bond is created, and inevitably what follows is uncomfortable silence and awkwardness.  Dave and Aubrey are trying to figure out what went wrong.  Why didn't things work like they expected them to?

Teens can often look at experiences as an ""all or nothing"" proposition.  So, if something as big as a first time of love-making doesn't work out, is that then the end of the relationship?  Dave and Aubrey try to figure out who did what wrong.  Who is to blame?  Wisdom is passed on by Dave's quiet friend, who tells him, ""it was sex.  One time.  The first time.  You don't know anything from that.  You're going to tell me that it isn't worth giving one more shot?  But you need to be a man.""  In other words, don't give up and throw in the towel like many teens (and even adults!) would do.  Instead, talk to her and figure it out.  It can be worked out.

The movie works because of the two characters.  Britt Robertson all but steals this movie with her portrayal of the perky, quick-witted, but emotionally scared Aubrey.  She has a charm and a certain vivaciousness that makes Aubrey stand out and apart from so many other teen-girl characters.  Dylan O'Brien pretty much keeps pace with Britt.  He matches her in every scene, and both actors do a phenomenal job of expressing their characters' naivety and vulnerabilities.

There are some peripheral characters that we just don't see enough of, and unfortunately, it detracts a bit from the film.  Dave's sister is cute as a button, but she is only in two scenes.  Aubrey's parents are the only parents that we see, and unless they were planning to explore both of these relationships a bit more, they don't really add much to the film.

I think this movie should be required viewing for older teens.  I think they could all relate to the two main characters in many ways and see some parallels between them and their own lives.  In the end, it is about communication.  And we can all do a better job at that.",1361923200,70,6664,4.6216908625106745

4932288,5,B0062KMDGG,"I was leaning toward 4.5 stars but given the choice of 4 or 5, 5 would be my vote.
This is a simple plot but the characters are excellent, even the secondary characters are 3 dimensional and likable. You get their personalities right away with a few well placed lines of dialog. Too much good acting not to give the director a nod. Subtle expressions frequently make the dialog work quite nicely.
The leads, however, really make the movie... there is a decided chemistry there.
Two strangers meet, one a bit akward, one a bit jaded, both witty and understated. Simple dialog between two people trying to figure out how to figure out what they want out of life, being candid as one can only be with a stranger.... and at some point they stop being strangers and the truth is a bit more akward and difficult... unless you step up your game.
This is not Marvel's The Avengers, or Casablanca..... it is, however, a very pleasant movie that you will likely watch again and again over the course of time.",1503878400,2,998,4.519337016574585

THE FIRST TIME (1978) is about the sexual awakening of a young woman who's been browbeaten into supporting her abusive, unemployed boyfriend; ORIENTAL BABYSITTER (1976) is the plotless story of the sexual awakening of a 15-year-old girl (who looks 25).

4932306,4,B0062KMDGG,"Reading the other reviews, I think there must be two different movies being reviewed. This is a recent, but classically styled teen angst movie, not some kind of soft porn from the 60's as some of the 1 star reviews have stated. It's definitely accurate to give it a PG 13 rating because it does have mild adult content, but it does a whole lot more implying than anything too risque.

As to the film itself, the lead actors do a good job, and the support characters range from stereotyped (friends) to realistic (parents). The writing takes a harder look at what is more likely the common ""first time"" experience...ie. lots of fumbling, moments of insight, as well as moments of immaturity. It doesn't get bogged down too much in the backstory, but these aren't carbon copies of other teen comedy flicks, either. It has a bit of nostalgic flair reminding me of Cusack's Lloyd Dobler in ""Say Anything"" without the 80's cheesefest.

If you are looking for prat falls, horny jokes, or over the top behavior, this will bore you. If you are looking for a modern version of the classic romance that has a more realistic take on what most kids are doing...and that they aren't doing it because they are ""bad"" but because they are learning how to be adults, you will probably really enjoy this.

It was nice to see O'Brien hinting and more complex acting skills than the ones we see in most of his other work. Robertson is a little less polished, but she's still very good.",1484870400,5,1466,4.566539923954372

There's also a number of bootlegs of this release sold on DVD-R

One of Linda Wong's best early roles is the title role in 'Oriental Babysitter,' a sizzling sexual tour-de-force that showcases Linda in a variety of lusty scenarios & situations.
Linda Wong is super underrated she was a legit game changer and gets very little respect or even shine for what she brought to the table in the early days of adult films

4932366,3,B0062KMDGG,"First Time and Oriental Babysitter is yet another line of Anthony Spinelli directed films released by Vinegar Syndrome. The First Time tells the story of a couple Sue Morris (Mimi Morga) and Jan (Joey Sivera) who's constantly bickering because Jan is unemployed and they can't make it on the eighty-five dollars Sue brings home working as an operator for the phone company every week. To buttress her income as a means of keeping a roof over their heads, Sue begins working in adult films. On the set of the film, she meets a lawyer Jake Pantera (Jack Wright) who allows these movies to be filmed at his house and hosts swinger parties at his house twice a week. He invites her to a swing party and she agrees.

At the party, Sue explores her sexuality in the open, including a hot girl-girl scene with Angie (Georgia Ilene Drugg). After the sensual scene is over, Spinelli takes the movie in a different, more masochistic direction as the very next scene has Sue whipping Angie--hard. This is not for the faint of heart. While this movie took place in 1978, a simpler time in adult entertainment, Spinelli touches upon taboo subjects such as sexual coercion and masochism.

In Oriental Babysitter, Linda Wong plays May Ling, a 21-year old secretary who works for a corporation and reminisces about her days as a teenage babysitter. In the first scene, a drunken husband (David Brook) rapes May, but as the scene progressed, she liked and enjoyed it. Thankfully, this awful opening scene was over in four minutes. Ling and Mr. Justin (Fred Anton) started off promising but the actual scene was rough, animalistic and only lasted two minutes. There was nothing in Oriental Babysitter which was arousing. The constant camera close-ups of the people's genitals was annoying. It was a lukewarm film at best. A respectable release from Vinegar Syndrome. The First Time was clearly the better of the two films.",1467504000,3,1904,4.837423312883436

4932411,5,B0062KMDGG,"I first noticed BRIT ROBERTSON from the movie <ASK ME ANYTHING> and fell in love instantly. She is rulling the movie. Yes she was. It's not because she is super pretty or something. She just knows how to interest the audience.
I didn't know that she is already famous back then.
And then I saw the movie <THE LONGEST RIDE>. Many people loved Client Eastwood's son Scott Eastwood better because he was the main actor. But for me I only can see Brit in that movie. She was that good.
Now that I've seen this movie, It seems more clear that she's ability and ability only is the reason why all of the movie she were in is so good because of her. And a little bit of luck of course. Because obviously all the movies she were in seems very interesting.
This movie is full of all kinds of cliche. A boy and a girl about to become adults. When to loose virginity and all that stuff.
Telling the story means really nothing at all.
Through the movie two main actors are shine like stars. They had 100% chemistry.
Britt Robertson was charmming then ever. She doesn't have to be naked just like the other movie <ASK ME ANYTHING>.
Even just looking at her in the screen can kill the boys right away.
She is not as famous as other actors like ANNE HATHAWAY or JENNIFER LAWRENCE yet and I don't know she will be ever, but one thing for sure is  she will have more cult fans in the future.

The two main characters are very likable and interesting, you do know where the story with the film's title and the fact rom coms all follow the same storyline will go, but the conversations between the two characters, as well as with their friends are interesting and enjoyable to watch.  If you were a teen watching this you might think it to be a bit unbelievable that a good looking girl like Britt Robertson's character with plenty of options would date a total jerk like her older boyfriend, but unfortunately those of us who are a bit older will tell you we've witnessed and baffled by that occurring in real life time and time again.

Her parents probably weren't too realistic either that or were just incredibly stupid, plus you can't imagine they wouldn't here her talking to him on the roof or on the grass, or when she'd just closed the front door.  I mean I can hear conversations out front of my house.  Both lead actors Robertson and O'Brien do a great job though, as do the minor characters which include Victoria Justice from Victorious.

4932443,5,B0062KMDGG,"I did not expect much of this movie, except as something fun to put on in the background while I was working on other things.  It totally sucked me in!  I fell for Dave right away--he was hilarious, bumbling, and totally relatable. I could see myself having a celeb crush on him, if he wasn't 5 years too young for me. It took a tiny bit longer, but I also grew to love Aubrey.  Initially, she came off as aloof, but then you got to see that she was quirky and awkward just like the rest of us were at her age.  I ended up feeling bad for Jane--sometimes popularity means people like you for the wrong reasons, and she really deserved a nice guy like Dave (unfortunately for her, I was cheering for Dave and Aubrey to get together).  Also, I'd like to add that while the title seems to indicate that this movie is all about sex, there's much more to it.  Putting that aside, the romantic scenes are great, because they were so raw, funny, awkward and real!  If more teen/college girls watched movies like this, they would have a more realistic view of physical intimacy--whether it's as important as teens make it out to be, what kind of partner you want to be with, and what to expect when it happens.  As Beca from Pitch Perfect would say, ""make good choices!""",1443225600,4,1262,4.340425531914893

4932596,5,B0062KMDGG,"Oh, how I love this little movie. I can't believe it wasn't more popular. It's near-perfect: funny, moving, surprising and sweet. The performances are amazing. Dylan O'Brien is completely natural as a slightly awkward teenage boy who longs for romantic love, and Britt Robertson is both brittle and aluring as a girl whose public side is much more knowing and sophisticated than she actually is. The movie's message: that a succesful relationship requires more than chemistry, and that love might sometimes be hard work, is perfect.

If you have an older teen in the house, this movie is as watchable as a John Hughes comedy, without the dated racist stuff and the, you know, intoxicated-sex-bording-on-rape thing. It's sexy, hillarious and rewarding, and it will give you something to talk about. 100% recommended for teens and adults alike.",1408060800,4,842,5.145985401459854

4932603,5,B0062KMDGG,"I watched this movie because of my love for Dylan O'Brien. In my opinion, he is the best actor under 30 in the world, and is so underrated. I love that he was casted for The Maze Runner, hopefully that will help him get J Law status because he deserves an Emmy based on the few things he has been in. Anyway, I'll stop expressing my complete love for him as an actor, and get on with the movie at hand.

I also wished to watch this movie because I felt that I could possibly relate, being close to their age group and having to deal with the awkwardness that Dave expresses so well. He was so wonderfully awkward it reminded me of myself. Anyway, This is a teen movie, but any age group will enjoy it because it is not just about hormonal teenagers. This movie is simple, and inspirational, and beautiful. It does revolve around virgins and ""the first time"" highlighting the large conflict teenagers often face, giving into the hormones and pressure since everyone around is going for it, or waiting till you find the right person. The movie is, like I said, incredibly simple. Nothing like I thought it would be, which is a good thing. It shows you that things can happen when you least expect it.

The writing of this film is incredible, and it appears to be a major motion picture. It isn't, however, rather it is more or less an independent film that made it to Sundance and limited theaters from what I can tell. This does not do it justice as it is better than half the crap in the theaters. The movie has so many levels, from the awkward first time, to the runaway drug addicted father, to the feeling of being in love with your best friend (something that I'm sure all of us have felt but don't wish to admit).

Brit and Dylan have wonderful chemistry in this movie. Dylan is perfect in everything he does, I have never seen an actor so gifted before. This is one of those few movies that feels incredibly natural. The acting is simply that good. Dave is completely awkward which makes it feel as if you are reliving your own experiences. I can't get over the naturalness in the movie. So often in teen movies, the actors are sort of crappy, and you can't really buy half of it. You can tell they are acting if that makes since. I mean, obviously it is a movie, but it is so natural you feel like you could have a conversation with these kids, and everything flows so well. You cannot tell they are acting, rather it seems someone may have a hidden camera somewhere. The acting is that good. Then again, O'Brien is that good in everything. There I go again, I'm sorry I love him as an actor. It takes place over a weekend, which I thought would be weird and rushed, but it was perfect. This movie is very different and is well worth it.

To sum up:
1. Dylan O'Brien is incredible, so number one, you can't go wrong with this movie since he is in it.
2. Inspiring, beautiful, well written, amazing acting.
3. different, a teen movie that actually serves a purpose and actually can be related to.
4. Way underrated, and so much better than half the crap that makes it
5. Best sun dance film i have watched.

Overall judged against all other movies - 7/10. Overall judged against all teen dramas 9/10 (TFiOS, if you put in in this category with teen movies, has this movie beat completely, but if you don't put TFiOS in the category, this is probably the closest teen movie to a 10 I have seen.)

Watch this movie. It is worth the hour and a half. Even if your just a teen wolf fan like myself and were in teen wolf withdrawal waiting for season 4, it will surprise you lol. :)",1403913600,,3582,4.315007429420505

This movie is sweet and cuddly even at its more awkward points. The characters are real and relatable and it calls to memory all the blush worthy moments of my teenage years. The chemistry between Britt and Dylan is great and the fact that they ended up together in real life after this movie is hilarious. But I just have to say that even if they hadn't, the movie would still have convinced me that they could.

The first time is a great movie that should have ended up in theaters but is well worth the viewing anyways.

As we all know, teenaged boys are devoting much time to thinking about sex and naturally lying about to their friends.  Three friends cross into Canada at Niagra Falls looking for a nonexistant brothel one of them has lied about visiting.  They find a woman in a bar where she has just stopped in to use the phone and assume that she is on the menu.  They sneak her back across the American border and offer to let her rest in their hotel room.  Then they plot to go to the room one at a time to have sex with her, still convincing themselves that she is a prostitute.  They actually have to encourage each other to go first.  All are virgins and terrified of not being able to perform and having their friends find out.  Beautiful Jacqueline Bisset plays their intended partner,  Although her character's live is in shambles, she shows great compassion to one of the boys.

Oriental Babysitter, Mai Lin, is of great shape and ripe age.  She works here and there part-time.  This simple plot points not to
babysitting.  It links to the baby's parents as far as to threesome.  Because of her working schedules, there are scenes showing

4932631,4,B0062KMDGG,"Let it be noted that I'm a fan of seventies porn. These ""Drive-in Collections"" from Vinegar Syndrome are some lesser known hard core movies. They actually did have drive-ins that showed these. The screen had to be facing in such a way that they couldn't be seen from outside the the lot, but it didn't take long for that to be banned as well. The women were real; no fake breasts, no shaved bald. The quality is claimed to be ""scanned 2k from 35mm elements"". These are quite clean video.

""The First Time"" stars Mimi Morgan (I've seen her in ""Candy Stripers""). She's doing video for the first time, not sex. Mimi is a tall, slender petite woman (I'm guessing 'A' cups) that reminds me of my wife. In this one they waste no time in getting right down to the action and it doesn't stop.

""Oriental Babysitter"" stars Linda Wong in her first porn movie. Although 25 years of age she plays a 15 year old babysitter that learns to enjoy all manner of sexual activity. It isn't as perverted as it sounds as she doesn't look young and you forget that she's supposed to be that young. Wong is a busty Japanese woman with her only drawback some facial blemishes.

If you enjoy the old seventies porn where they had to pretend to have some story (there wasn't even VHS back then) to get people to the theater, this is a great selection.

4932635,4,B0062KMDGG,I rented this because basically I had seen everything else.  It was a pleasant surprise.  Nice story and decent acting.,1381795200,,119,4.9
4932636,5,B0062KMDGG,"This is probably one of the best teen love stories I've seen.  Most romance movies make relationships and sex seem like this fairytale type of experience, even with the first time.  I really enjoyed that this movie took a different,  and more realistic, approach.

The acting was very good too!  I absolutely love Dylan O'Brien.  He was adorable as always and I loved his character!  I would definitely recommend it to anyone!",1381536000,,426,4.833333333333333
4932637,5,B0062KMDGG,"The performances are flawless, the story is mesmerizing, and the music so well chosen that one wants to see this over and over again! I have watched it numerous times and still enjoy it like the first time I saw it!",1381017600,,215,4.2682926829268295
4932638,3,B0062KMDGG,"I watched it on the plane, it was entertaining. I wanted something easy to watch (no violence) it was just perfect.",1379116800,,115,4.523809523809524
4932639,5,B0062KMDGG,A very endearing story.  Loving the characters. Dylan O'Briens acting was perfect. If your a romantic you will love this movie,1378771200,,126,5.0
4932640,5,B0062KMDGG,"Very charming story of first time young love - well worth buying just for that premise...but for those of us in the standing Army of Teen Wolf Fans - OMIGOSH, you need to buy this - Its Stiles and EVERYONE needs more Stiles!  Dylan is great, his young lady interest is appealing, his nerd friends are hilarious and he finally gets the girl.  I'll be watching this more than once - it'll help bridge the gap between seasons of his Teen Wolf show and other movies he's sure to be in - So Talented and So Cute!",1378166400,,507,4.216494845360825
4932641,5,B0062KMDGG,"This was a fantastic movie. Heartwarming and lots of fun. Well and truly worth seeing, and up there with the best romcoms for laughs and loves. Dylan O'Brien is a special treat, and the chemistry between the protagonists is absolutely fantastic. Can't wait to watch it again!",1377993600,,275,4.872340425531915
4932642,5,B0062KMDGG,This is my favorite movie! Reminds me of how I fell in love at 20 with a boy very similar to Dylan O'briens character.,1376697600,,118,3.9583333333333335

4932644,4,B0062KMDGG,"I was surprised by this movie. One would think this was something of a generic teen sex romp movie - horny boys trying to get laid. However, this movie is much more subtle and less formulamatic than most I've seen in this genre.

I guess one could say this movie has more heart and soul. It is much deeper and more touching that most. I was truly impressed and truly satisfied watching this movie. Very good performances by Dylan O'Brien and the supporting cast.

If you want an out of the ordinary teen romance movie with just enough humor to keep it light, then I can whole-heartedly recommend this movie.",1376352000,,607,4.509090909090909
4932645,4,B0062KMDGG,"4 STARS The First Time is not your typical teen chick flick. The depth and easy dialogue reminded me of YA contemporary romance novels. I loved the flow and authenticity of the characters' emotions and reactions. The girl has an older boyfriend (a relationship that totally bothered me) and the boy has an insane crush on the girl next door who is more interested in washboard abs than her super cute and sweet guy friend. Not original, but no one turned into a raging anything. There was no backstabbing or cattiness, just teens figuring things out and not all that gracefully. The parents weren't evil pod people. They were part clueless, part helpless, and part wonderful. The boy was respectful with just a dash of stupid. The girl was the same. I'd watch it again for sure!",1376179200,,778,4.686131386861314
4932646,5,B0062KMDGG,"This movie was much better than I had originally anticipated. The only thing I had seen Dylan O'Brien in was Teen Wolf, but now that I've seen this I can confidently say that he is a superb actor. The stars of this movie had great chemistry with one another, and the story is not farfetched like every other movie in this genre. I also love the fact that the lead (O'Brien) wasn't pining over a 25 year old supermodel posing as a High School senior. Great Movie!!!!!",1375401600,,466,4.367816091954023
4932647,3,B0062KMDGG,I really only watched this because it had Dylan O'Brien in it. Other than that is was typical and not really worth watching.,1374969600,3,124,4.434782608695652
4932648,4,B0062KMDGG,"This movie was a love story with a message at the end.  There was not a long drawn-out love scene, so it is suitable for teen to watch.",1374624000,,135,3.8214285714285716
4932649,5,B0062KMDGG,"This movie is not only the best movie I have ever seen but it is a true love story. I get so sick of seeing these chick-flick plots that never happen in real life.

Much more thoughtful than most teen movies.  I bought it so that I could watch it again.  Surprising to me that it never got wide theatrical release.

I won't say a whole lot more, you can read the reviews and trust the positive ones are spot on.  I was actually pretty bummed when this was over. Would love to see a sequel!  Naaa, that would probably ruin it!",1367884800,,569,4.222222222222222

The memorable words from filmmaker/writer/actor Jonathan Kasdan's (""Californication"", ""Dawson's Creek"") teenage romantic comedy ""The First Time"".

Starring young talents Dylan O'Brien (""Teen Wolf"", ""High Road""), Britt Robertson (""Dan in Real Life"", ""Scream 4), Victoria Justice (""Victorious"", ""Zoey 101), Craig Roberts (""Submarine"", ""Jayne Eyre"") and Lamarcus Tinker (""Glee"", ""Friday Night Lights"", ""Cougar Town""), ""The First Time"" would be nominated for The Grand Jury Prize at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival.

VIDEO, AUDIO AND SUBTITLES:

""The First Time"" is presented in 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen and English 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Picture quality for the film is very good.  Lighting is well-done and for the most part, the film looks very good on DVD.  Audio is good with dialogue and music being crystal clear.  I detected no major problems video or audio-wise but I do wish this film was released on Blu-ray.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The First time"" comes with no special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have watched a lot of teenage romantic comedies in my lifetime and within the last decade, there have only been a handful that I can say were very good.

Having watched ""The First Time"", this is probably one of the best teenage romantic comedies I have seen in the last decade!

Sure, a lot of teenage romantic comedies these days tend to have a music element tied to it.  From the ""Step Up"" films, the ""High School Musical"" or many Disney features to the often banal, wealthy girl and guy from the other side of the tracks storyline.

But ""The First Time"" works because of its two talents, Britt Robertson and Dylan O'Brien.  For anyone who grew up and attended high school and has experienced the feeling of liking someone but knowing you don't really have a chance or even having this connection with someone but yet they are dating someone else.  These feelings and emotions are what presents itself in this teenage comedy.

But its efficacy is due to the nature of the characters.  Aubrey is your mature teenager who does not like to be your average teen on Facebook or Twitter, showing public affection in public.  She watches foreign films, she listens to classics on vinyl, she wants to travel.

And you have Dave, the teenager who represents a lot of shy guys with no dating experience.  Sure, the guy may have the hot female friend but he is more of the ""brother-like"" figure that listens to the girl's problems and never looked at as a guy they want to date.

Many guys have been in the position of Dave and the feeling when the girl you like dates a guy that prefers the bad boys over the good guys.

There is wonderful chemistry between both Dylan O'Brien and Britt Robertson and their role as awkward teenagers not knowing much about love, you can't help but root for them and hope everything works out.

And while we see the awkwardness and growing connection between both characters, it's the depiction of what happens when they have sex for the very first time and I don't want to ruin the film, but these are clearly experiences that some people have experienced.

This is probably one of the most captivating, witty and yet charming teenage rom com film that I have seen in a very long time.  These are experiences that teens and even adults can connect with because they are real emotions and fears that many people have experienced.  Finding someone they connect with as a teenager and that first time experience, how it's presented in the film is wonderful and ""The First Time"" distinguishes itself from other teen romantic comedies because it's not too banal.

I really wished this film was released on Blu-ray but on DVD, the film looks and sounds good but where are the special features?  No commentary, no featurettes, nothing.  For a film that I enjoyed so much, I was a bit disappointed that the DVD didn't have any special features.

Back in the '80s, teen films such as ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""Pretty in Pink"" won over audiences because people can connect with those films and the feeling of awkwardness but most importantly, a storyline that was entertaining, characters that people can identify with and a film that feels real.

Many teenage comedies have deviated from that and have become films that want to connect with people through music or choreography or issues that affect people today as teenage pregnancy, sickness or the usual status tends to come into play much more these days in teen romance films.

Overall, Jonathan Kasdan's ""The First Time"" is a teenage romantic comedy that is about its characters with a story that people can identify and be entertained by it.  It's a wonderful film and probably the best teenage romantic comedy I have seen in quite some time.  While the DVD is a barebone release, I still recommend this film as it is a must-see, for those who enjoy teenage romantic comedies!",1364601600,10,4917,4.844311377245509
4932699,5,B0062KMDGG,"An amazing movie! For a movie in such a tired genre to feel so fresh, just left me speachless. I literally just finished watching it, and had to leave a 5 star review to help anyone on the fence of weather to give it a chance, DO IT.

cast- great
acting- flawless
story- wonderful/fresh/real
directing- great",1364515200,,308,4.5
4932700,3,B0062KMDGG,"5 stars? Come on people, it wasn't THAT good! I'll give you my opinion on the pros and cons of this movie to explain my three star rating.

PROS:
-Entertaining
-Adorable and likeable leads (esp. the guy, who was one of the good guys out there)
-Awkward but cute couple with good chemistry
-Fun to watch the sweet, romantic beginnings of young love

CONS:
-The plot was weak
-There was no great msg that I got from this movie. Infact, teens may walk away with a negative message. ""There's nothing wrong with having sex in h.s. AND if it sucks the first time, keep having it because it will get better!""
-Some of the supporting characters were so awkward or underdeveloped that you didn't always get them. I kept finding myself thinking, why are you even on screen right now? Either their personalities were not defined, or their relationship with the leads were foggy, or their attempt at comedy was just that, an attempt (Character ex. the main girl's first beau, the girl's parents, and the male leads two best friends). These awkard/underdeveloped characters lead to boring, awkward, and poorly written script lines. My point is, I only enjoyed the scenes with solely the two leads.
-Ugh! And is this how teens are now? I worry for the day my children are teenagers! Holy cow... So much crude, skanky, vulgar material in this film. Not to mention the unintelligent dialogue from the supposedly 'smart' characters. I blame the writers. Hmm... And society as it declines. lol.

Cons aside, it was a simple cute story that was enjoyable enough, but not worth the money. Since I was the only low review I felt it my responsibility to warn others out there, who too, will not share a five star love of this movie. That is a rating I don't just give to anything, it has to deserve it. This movie? It deserved three stars.

Parental advisery warning: Constant swearing throughout in casual conversation, including one use of the F word. Sensuality, though despite what the title would insinuate, they never actually show them having sex. However it is strongly implied up until that point. Lots of making out. Teen partying including, drug and alcohol use, and topless females (They cover with hands). Crude, vulgar moments and adult content throughout. This is a good site that gives the break down on content for movies.

I was really satisfied with the shipping!

I WACTHED IT A FEW DAYS AGO!. IT WAS GOOD YOU CAN TELL THAT THE SCRIPT WAS WELL WRITTEN! the ending could've been better though! i felt like it just left me hanging. but overall it was a great movie! its such a chick flick though",1364342400,,592,4.103448275862069
4932703,4,B0062KMDGG,"If you go into this expecting the usual sort of teenage fare, you're going to be disappointed. Coming at it from that angle, it's slow-paced and overly teenage-y philosophical.

On the other hand, if you go into it understanding that it's entirely a character study and, in its own way, a love letter to the John Hughes movies that captured teenage life in the 80s so well, you'll enjoy it.

The performances from Dylan O'Brien and Britt Robertson are superlative, particularly given the pool of talent they usually muddle through with, the dialogue is well done and (thank God) does not dwell overmuch in the Nicholas Sparks camp. It pulls the warm, fuzzy goggles back from the first sexual experiences while still giving you enough of a romance for a smile. I found it a refreshingly real take on this stage of this person's life--whether they experience it in their teens or the twenties. None of us really have a clue when it comes to firsts.

It's a movie I liked enough to buy, but definitely not something for everyone. Then again, it doesn't try to be.",1364256000,11,1060,4.657754010695188
4932704,4,B0062KMDGG,"A flashback of the past and be a teen again with the same aspirations of love and sex. The same fears and bravado of an age to look back on but was there done that and do not want to be there again. Yet, the chills & thrills that were the foundation of adulthood. My first love, my first time and my every time. Rock & Roll, true love my first condom no condom, beer & booze, fiends & girl friends. Rock my world.
Very good movie",1364256000,,429,3.942528735632184
4932705,5,B0062KMDGG,"Brittany Robertson is great in this film. Britt and Dylan both do a great job in enacting a awkward situation we all face at one time in our life. They and this movie made it more true than most movies trying to romantisize the First Time. I have seen most everything Brittany Robertson has done in Film,TV and photo shoots,as lead and early in her career as a cameo or a walk on. I have believed for serval years now that Britt is welll under rated as an Actress she is as good as most twice her age and can play a wide range from comedy to horror ,to drama and syspense trillers.

4932706,5,B0062KMDGG,"I watched this movie not really expecting much and was very pleasantly surprised. It was predictable. The title pretty much tells you what to expect. What I didn't expect was to find the characters so engaging and the story so believable. It was very well done. I loved that there was no nudity. I was fully expecting that, given the subject matter. The whole subject was handled so tastefully. This wasn't just a movie about sex, it was a movie about the feelings that bring two people to that point and then the aftermath of that decision. The day after watching this movie I was still thinking about it(after all, we have all been there and experienced that). I found the movie to be very sweet, very funny and very true.",1363910400,,724,4.534351145038168
4932707,5,B0062KMDGG,This is a fantastic movie. I don't normally download movie due to the red box but after seeing this movie with my girlfriend this changed. I check amazon to see if they had it and immediately ordered it for my DVD collection. I was very pulled in to a different love story. It isn't so cliche or predictable as Hollywood love story and really portray realistic experience that teenagers normally go through.,1363824000,,407,4.666666666666667

8491166,5,B0062KMDGG,"I found this movie by accident a few days ago and I was hooked from the opening conversation between Dave and Aubrey.  I would have to say that I am not the target demo for a movie like this.  I have not been a teenager for a long time and I am a guy.  But despite all of that, this movie had a timeless quality that went beyond a typical teenage romantic comedy/drama.  Even though the movie is several years old, it didn't feel dated.  I think it will still be good to watch 20 or more years from now.

For one, it was fresh and the acting was real.  I had never heard of Dylan O'Brien or Britt Robertson, but they played their roles so well that I began to forget that they were acting in a script.  The only items that were forced in my opinion was the compressed timeline of their emotional and physical connection (in real life it would take a bit longer in my opinion) plus there were a couple of cliched supporting characters.

The movie was heavy in dialog between the two main characters and the connection between them felt natural.  Their attraction and eventual connection was built on talking and listening and being themselves with each other.  That is how lasting relationships are built.  The physical part comes along for the ride and is much more substantial because of the firm foundation it is built on.  And the movie indirectly made the point (in my opinion) that the sex part between Dave and Aubrey was probably premature and almost killed their relationship before it really got going, especially considering their ages.  This is real life and it is rare to see it depicted so well in a movie.  My own experiences growing up are that relationships built primarily on physical attraction with little else behind them don't last in the long run.  As an old friend of mine used to say.......at some point, you have to have a conversation.  I think the presence of Ronny and Jane in the movie are there to make that point, notwithstanding that Ronny was also in the movie for comic relief.

The bottom line is that this movie is a rare find and I highly recommend watching it, even if you are not a teenager.",1528416000,,2130,4.445876288659794
8491167,1,B0062KMDGG,Super boring and slow. Basically just one giant rant between the two main characters. VERY difficult to follow (because I was falling asleep).,1524614400,,142,5.217391304347826
8491168,5,B0062KMDGG,"Dave is the thoughtful, sincere hero that all teens need as a role model. I'd say he's one of the best personifications I've ever seen of what it means to be a good man. Aubrey is quirky enough to be unique while still being relatable as she strives to enjoy life beyond the superficial trappings that most people, teens and adults alike, get caught up in. Their chemistry and awkwardness while navigating what it means to have a real relationship, one that requires communication and sometimes hard work, is love story perfection. And how nice to see a teen movie where the guy friends were actually good friends, no jerks in the bunch, and that the movie portrayed it as perfectly normal for three guys to get together to talk openly about relationship stuff without hiding behind machismo. Even Jane, Dave's original crush, isn't the stuck-up airhead stereotype that teen romcoms used to portray in the role of the misplaced object of affection. This is now solidly one of my favorite romance movies ever. I can't believe it came out 5 years ago and I just now stumbled upon it!",1523318400,,1081,4.6947368421052635
