8384252,1,B002YK46FY,"Hi,
  loyal Amazon customer. This is the 2009 Penn State Michigan game on DVD. The problem is that only one half of the game is sent. This is supposed to be a 2 DVD set but only one disc is mailed. I called to report this and Amazon immediatley sent a replacement and the same thing happened again...only one disc is mailed. You only get the first half of the game. I am returning for a refund.",1278979200,,394,4.103896103896104
