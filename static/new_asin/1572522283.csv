The DVD format provides an opportunity for a topic such as this to be covered richly.  Unfortunately that is not the case with this disk.",1040947200,9,246,4.444444444444445
188811,4,1572522283,"`You're the Top'  is a short, but worthwhile trip through the turbulent life of a 20th Century Icon. A great deal of depth and insight is communicated by sharp editing and carefully selected film clips. Originally  this was an hour long Television special. Don't let that put you off, the  word `special' is very appropriate here.  Why should you buy this  Documentary?  To appreciate and enjoy his musical  talent chiefly by a  bewildering number of rare excerpts from films and TV shows (notably a  Kinescope of the original cast of `Kiss Me Kate') and see the ironies of  someone who lived a private life very different from his public persona.  Even today, the classy image of Porter as generated by his timeless songs  and music hide a veil of a tragic and melancholy man, who was born into  success, but died unhappy.  His story is not just of music, but of a  struggle against life itself. What makes this a special event is that the  combination of good interviews with contemporaries, the relaxed and adult  approach make for repeated viewing and a thirst for more.  Whether you  are a Porter fan, or have never heard of him, you will gain something  special from this documentary, and perhaps learn a little in the moral  sense of the pitfalls and unhappiness that can come, even with great  wealth.  What lives on is his music, which history will never erase.  Watching this Documentary will leave you feeling better for the experience.",963705600,50,1447,4.741935483870968

7797567,5,1572522283,I don't think most people realize that his music is well known to most all people. Its upbeat and soulful. This disc has many songs sung by many great singers from that era and are still being sung today. Seller was prompt and the price was fine. Give it a free listen and you'll be hooked too. Highly recommend as gift and for yourself.,1403827200,,337,4.28125
7797568,4,1572522283,Look if you don't like Cole Porter music then don't buy this.  However if you do this this is a keeper.  Only problem I found with it is that the singers are many times out of the 30's and the sounds and style is set when they recorded it back then.  On the flip side this was how is was done then and even today each band and singer(s) restyle it for themselves.  So well this will not make any charts and it's greatest fans are older than dirt it still Cole Porter and he is Tops.,1391904000,,482,3.9381443298969074
7797569,5,1572522283,"For a Cole Porter fan, this is an entertaining look at his life and the comments of performers and friends.  The tunes that are included are well chosen, and the performers do them justice.  Bobby Short as host is a welcome treat.",1315612800,,230,4.4523809523809526
7797570,5,1572522283,"There aren't many documentaries about Cole Porter and so far, this is the best that I have seen. It consists of several interviews by relatives, friends and co workers as well as many well known performances of his songs. There are a few clips of Cole Porter on the Milton Berle Show and a couple of his recordings. It covers his life from the time he was a small child until his death.  My only regret is that it is only 56 minutes long.",1237507200,,438,4.214285714285714
7797571,5,1572522283,"An enjoyable overview of Porter's life and career. Far too short for my liking but an improvement on that dire ""DE-LOVELY"" movie.
The contributions from Porter's friends and collaborators is a treasure as most of them have passed on.

7797572,5,1572522283,"If you want to know Cole Porter, this is a better introduction than the recent film effort, ""De-Lovely,"" and far better than the old Cary Grant fiction.  Both movies fudge on Cole's character, with ""De-Lovely"" trying to depict Porter as a guy working out his gay issues through marriage, which is total nonsense.

Cole Porter was arguably the greatest of all the composers of American Standards, for reasons explained in ""You're the Top"".  And to explain this, as well as to outline one of the most colorful celebrity lives of the 20th century, are people who actually knew Porter, knew him socially, worked with him and performed his music - people like Bobby Short, Kitty Carlisle (Mrs. Moss Hart), Brendan Gill, Linda Ronstadt, Harry Connick, Jr., Porter's family from his childhood, etc.  Especially insightful are the observations of Porter's childhood and his marriage.  They go far in explaining both the people and the era that nurtured his talent and later provided the milieu from which he drew his ""delightful, de-lovely"" themes.

No punches are pulled, nothing glossed over for the sake of image or box-office receipts.  And of course the Porter music, complimenting the narrative, is a chronicle itself, for it captures the zeitgeist brilliantly, performed by the headliners of the times, from early sound to TV's Golden Age, when the audience was more up to Porter's level of elegance, style and wit than today's dressed-down, dumbed-down generation.

I suggest that if you have seen or are going to see either of the bio-flicks, that you treat yourself to this ""wonderful, marvelous"" look at a life and its era - alas, as intimate a look as we'll ever get.  They truly broke the mold...",1097366400,64,1701,4.961267605633803
7797573,4,1572522283,"This is really a wonderful treat for fans of Cole Porter or those who know little about him. It has a nice mix of rare and familiar songs mixed with thoughts and recollections about Cole by various friends, musicians, and performers. You get a nice sense of what his life was like along with a decent overview of his music.
If you have never heard of Cole (or know very little about him), you will probably be a fan after viewing this. Even if you are very familiar with Cole, you still will find some interesting tidbits in the DVD. My only complaints with this are the length (only an hour) the lack of additional material. It would seem that so much additional material could have been placed easily on this DVD; but the only additional material is a listing of the songs on the DVD (without any information about them) and quick list of his musicals. How about fleshing out some of that information?
Definitely recommended.",1042761600,24,927,4.5568862275449105
