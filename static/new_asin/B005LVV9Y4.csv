4830638,5,B005LVV9Y4,"Italian neo-realism is a term that describes an Italian national cinematic movement that is characterized by stories set amongst the poor and working class, filmed on location and frequently using nonprofessional actors. The queen of this type of Italian cinema in its heyday (post-WWII and well into the fifties) was the great Italian actress Anna Magnani, whose abilities were described as volcanic among many other superlatives.

LITTLE GIRL (LA PIVELLINA in Italian) evokes not only the semi-documentary style of Italian neo-realism cinema, and the best of its directors, Vittorio de Sica and Roberto Rossellini, it features a central performance by Patrizia Gerardi that is reminiscent of the great Magnani herself. What more could one ask for?

According to DVD extras, the abandonment of children in Italy is a common occurrence. The film-making team of Tizza Covi and Rainer Frimmel decided to use this tragic truth as the starting point of LITTLE GIRL. An abandoned two-year-old girl name Asia (played with remarkable precociousness by Asia Crippait doesnt get any more natural than this, folks), is rescued by a family of small-time circus performers, themselves outsiders to mainstream society. The filmmakers found a real-life family of circus performers and constructed scenarios around which each scene in the film was played. A scripted beginning and end to each sequence was elaborated upon with improvisation that is so believable and intimate that it humiliates a lot of professional actors who attempt the same (Im thinking about you, everyone involved with Blue Valentine).

Without revealing what ultimately happens (and, to be truthful, not a lot does happen, nor needs to) the final shot is as poetically cinematic as, say, the final shot of Garbos Queen Christina, in which the artists stillness and the perfectly-sculpted composition of the shot draws the viewer into the mind of the subject and forms a visual impression not easily forgotten. In the case of LITTLE GIRL, the image is of an aged, weary, but still potentially volcanic Madonna With Child and is as beautiful and poignant an image as one is ever likely to see on film again. It is perfectly timed against the real-time twilight and the sleepiness of the child. All the trials of a difficult life and the resilience to forge ahead is evident in the eyes of Patti, the surrogate mother, whom we have come to love and admire.

LITTLE GIRL is yet another gem of an out-of-the-mainstream film from First Run Features, the New York City-based American distributor of countless foreign and independent films that might otherwise never see the light of day in North America. While sometimes pushing the envelope in terms of what audiences might appreciate as cinematic art, First Run Features has been doggedly supporting small-scale fiction and non-fiction films since 1979. Their survival is an example of the Little Engine That Could and long may they continue to bring films like LITTLE GIRL to discerning audiences.

There isn't a false note to be heard in this glorious example of a genre that can all too quickly become tedious without the right balance of restraint and tact. Apart from the interaction between Patti and Asia, one is certain to smile at the way Patti scolds her wayward mutt, Hercules, (the growling and teeth-baring aren't fake) and the way she swerves to avoid the half dozen knives thrown at her by her husband, the wonderful Walter Saabel, as they demonstrate their agility and skill with one of their circus acts. The slight smile on her face as she dodges the blades is like a metaphor for how she faces lifewith a little bit of humour and a huge dose of determination, putting on a brave face to potential danger.

Patrizia Gerardi, with her bright orange hair which isn't the least bit distracting as it is simply her, is unlikely to win an Academy Award (as did Anna Magnani for her towering performance in The Rose Tattoo in the mid-fifties) but she gives a performance that is astounding in the purity of its emotion and the simplicity of its truth. That is pure Magnani, and that is why the comparison is apt.

LITTLE GIRL (LA PIVELLINA) is not to be ignored or abandoned to obscurity. Find it. Watch it. Remember it.",1397433600,6,4236,4.983026874115983
4830639,1,B005LVV9Y4,"I was trying to get into,but as soon as she found Herculues the dog, (who had previously gotten lost) and slapped him a few times for getting lost,and she then grabbed him by the scruff of the neck (he let out a real howl)  who does that these days? ......that was enough for me.  She wasn't faking it, so then I looked at the year it was made.  Um.....2009 is recent enough to have some animal cruelty laws or clauses for movies.  Goodness gracious,  that poor dog.  I wonder how many times they had to redo that scene to get it right.  She treats the abadoned girl like a princess, and treats the dog like a smuck.........go figure.  Italy--catch up with the rest of the world, and treat your animals with some class.",1392076800,,719,4.353383458646617

4830641,5,B005LVV9Y4,"I could go on and on about the plot or lack of, but I will make it simple, it's one of the best movies I have seen in years. As a movie collector, close to 1000 movies so far, I am so glad I got to see this movie on Netflix and cannot wait to add it to my collection. Patti is wonderful,so is Walter and Tairo.....however the star is the ABSOLUTELY super cute Asia, she is just so cuddly,it's impossible not to fall in love and worry about her well being through out the movie. At times it seemed I was watching a documentary and that added to concern for all the characters. In short this is the kind of movie more people should see. Word of mouth is a great way to do that.",1374192000,2,675,3.9705882352941178
4830642,4,B005LVV9Y4,"The title of this review could well be the daily headline in Italy where there is an ongoing and ignored crisis of parents abandoning their toddlers to the streets on a regular basis. Director Rainer Frimmel and writer/director Tizza Covi wanted to bring the attention of the world to the crisis of Italy's abandoned toddlers. They chose to tell this story through the use of real street gypsies with the aide of a couple of professional actors in the lead roles. The gypsy class of Italy are people who live on the edge of abject poverty and destitution, abandoned themselves by the society in which they struggle to stay alive.

A gypsy women, Patti, played by professional actress Patrizia Gerardi, finds La Pivellina, an abandoned toddler, in a swing one late afternoon as she searches for her dog in a park near the gypsy encampment where she lives in a small trailer with her husband and a band of street performing circus gypsies. The swing is still moving when she finds her suggesting that the mother has just left her baby when she spots someone she hopes might take her in.

The baby will tear your heart out. She is absolutely trusting, achingly sweet. You want to die with tenderness and fear for her. The toddler, Asia Crippa, embodies goodness and innocence and beauty.

In the end, the anonymous mother of La Pivellina leaves a note in Patti's rusted mailbox promising she will come reclaim her baby in a couple of days. So the gypsies, who have done their best to care for and truly love this little baby girl, throw the toddler a going away party. But in the end, the mother never shows up, and Patti is left sitting in the dying sunset with La Pivellina asleep in her arms. The scene foreshadows the dark futures of La Pivellina and the poor gypsies who have done their best to care for her. Poverty and want engulf them regardless of the deep love in their hearts.

Be warned if you are an animal lover: There is one quick scene in which Patrizia Gerardi hits her little dog very hard, ""punishing"" it for running away. The hit is real, and the dog reacts with pain, both physical and emotional. It seemed like an unnecessary scene to have in a film that is all about someone who does everything she can to care for and protect an innocent thing when Patti and her husband themselves have barely enough to survive.

This movie is meant to haunt you long after you've viewed it. And it does.",1361836800,4,2409,4.54147465437788
4830643,3,B005LVV9Y4,"""La Pivellina"" is a truly charming movie with, unfortunately, a non-ending. A story needs to conclude with an ending or validation of some sort to confirm for the audience that the time they spent was worthwhile. This movie doesn't do that, but it's actually worth watching despite that failure.",1323475200,4,295,5.040816326530612
8478702,2,B005LVV9Y4,I waited for 50 minutes for something to happen.  It didn't.  A huge turn-off was how that woman treated the dog and made it yelp as she hit it and picked it up with such cruelty.  Shame of her.  Didn't finish.,1524268800,,210,4.048780487804878

The people that took in this little girl treated her so wonderfully, probably better than she had ever been treated in her life. They don't have much but what they do have, they share with her without flinching. The ending really surprised me. Definitely worth your time.",1524096000,,367,4.575757575757576
