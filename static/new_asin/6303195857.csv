I wish there was a follow-up video that would take you up to the next level.",1244073600,,283,4.2407407407407405
7840586,4,6303195857,"Very well instructed. Short but relaxing. I like his instructions, very well done and you do not have to think so much about what you are doing as he goes slow and is very clear in his instuctions. I found it very easy to follow. I would recommend this one for beginners like me.",1016323200,8,279,4.185185185185185
