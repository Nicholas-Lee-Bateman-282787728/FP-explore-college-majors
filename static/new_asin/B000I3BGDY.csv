8143883,5,B000I3BGDY,"My 5 stars rating is for the entire series, each and every episode. But this DVD is just Disc 3 of the Season 1 set. The clarity of the picture is excellent and the sounds of the Old West will come alive in your living room.

 There are 3 episodes to savour on this disc.
 Episodes 5, 6 and 7

 Episode 5 - ""Trial of Jack McCall""
 ""The Jury will now retire to the whored rooms and begin deliberations...""
 ""The Gem"" becomes a courtroom and Deadwood in it's own unique style, makes up the laws as they go along to try Wild Bill's killer. Calamity is devastated by the loss of her friend and goes on a long bender. Swearengen sends Trixie to help ot Alma with her new charge - the orphaned girl. Cy banishes his friend Andy, as he thinks Andy's illness will be bad for business. Jane finds Andy dumped in the woods dying.

 Episode 6 - ""The Plague""
 ""treat the hoople heads free, that's cheap good will""

 While tracking a murderer down to bring to justice, Bullock encounters native resistance and must fight for his life. Al now has Farnum reporting to him on what Trixie and Alma are up to. Smallpox hit Deadwood and Jane becomes an unlikely nurse. Al co-authors an article in the ""deadwood Pioneer"" meant to help minimize the threat of the outbreak.

 Episode 7 - ""Bullock Returns to Camp""
 ""They're nice here. And Mr Swearengen's funny as hell""

 Bullock returns after tracking down the killer, but is a changed man(No more Mr. Nice guy). A pair of teenagers arrive in camp on the pretense of looking for their father. Calamity continues her nursing duties in the ""pest tent"", Swearengen is on to Trixie, while Alma coldly refuses Farnum's bid on her claim.

 The muddy midway of Deadwood comes alive in this very real series. Legendary characters mix in with the fictional characters who are some pretty gritty and most often lecherous people, who speak like they were brought up on the King's English, but may also set a new record for the most swear words in any program. There is also quite a bit of sex, nudity and violence. And although all of that only add to the ""ambiance"" of the setting, it is certainly not one for the kiddies or anyone who cringes at 4 letter(and longer) words.

 The cast of the series is marvelous. Timothy Olyphant, Ian McShane, Molly Parker, Jim Beaver, Brad Dourif, William Sanderson, Powers Boothe, and Keith Carradine(Wild Bill), will all draw you in immediately. The music is so good I bought the Season 1 soundtrack that mixes short quotes from the series(also explicit) with some western style music and some great blues. each episode runs about 50 minutes.

 Don't call or come over while I'm watching Deadwood!....
