THIS is the movie to watch!  Powerful. Insightful. Totally mesmerizing in it's scope and depth of how the clandestine, ""behind-the-scenes"" political machinery is used to destroy every shred of truth and replace it with fabricated diversion.  I have the utmost respect for Mary Mapes, and every member of the specific ""60 Minutes"" segment portrayed both in her book and in this movie.  I'll be inviting friends over to watch it many, many times.  If I was allowed on this site to rate it as 100 stars, I would have done so.",1454198400,3,697,4.688524590163935

7560946,4,B0192PEOGY,"Truth is about the scandal over a 2004 CBS 60 Minutes report investigating President George W. Bushs military service, which noted that he had exploited family connections and political privilege to avoid military service in Vietnam. After the story breaks, CBS  news producer Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett) and CBS news anchor Dan Rather (Robert Redford) attract scrutiny.

The film follows the downfall of Rather and Mapes. They believe their report is based on solid research and credible interviewees, only to see other news organizations find flaws in the story after the fact. This forces network executives to do what they have to in order to save face and preserve the news divisions reputation. The jobs of Rather, Mapes, and their team are on the line.

Because the film is based on Mapes book, it is sympathetic to both herself and Rather, but still raises interesting questions about agendas  both of the news reporters and those who attacked the aired story. Issues of journalistic responsibility and fairness are raised, but there is an emphasis on the underlying drive to get the scoop and beat competitors at all costs, frequently leading to shortcuts. High on the success of her expose of torture in Abu Ghraib, Mapes is filled with a combination of arrogance and determination to break another huge story, but what is perceived to be the biggest story of the year results in an unforeseen, career-destroying backlash.

Both Redford and Blanchett are excellent. Redford has a tough job, since Rather was such a well-known presence on television, but manages to channel the essence of Rather, capturing the anchors vocal style and physicality.  Blanchett portrays a range of emotions from elation to dejection, with anger, resentment, and defensiveness part of the mix. As she circles the wagons when the public outcry increases, we see her self-confidence and self-image begin to erode. The distinguished supporting cast includes Dennis Quaid, Stacy Keach, Elisabeth Moss, Bruce Greenwood, and Topher Grace.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a Q & A with Cate Blanchett, Elisabeth Moss, and writer/director James Vanderbilt; commentary with Vanderbilt and the films producers; and the featurette The Team. A digital HD copy is included.",1454112000,3,2261,5.212121212121212

7560953,4,B0192PEOGY,"""Truth"" (2015 release; 122 min.) brings the story of the infamous CBS 60 Minutes 2004 segment on then-President George W. Bush's track record at the Texas Air National Guard, and more specifically whether he got preferential treatment from officials that allowed him to avoid having to serve in Vietnam. CBS anchor Dan Rather (played by Robert Redford) and producer Mary Mapes (played by Cate Blanchett) quickly find themselves on the hot seat, as it appears there are issues with the authenticity of certain documents used in the 60 Minutes segment. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie is bound to be divisive. I personally don't care much one way or another. I vaguely remembered these events, but certainly not in the details as they are displayed here. Whether those details are accurate is impossible to tell. Why? Because this is not an objective, independent look at these events. It isn't until the end credits role that we are informed that the movie's script is adapted from Mary Mapes' book ""Truth and Duty: The Press, the President, and the Privilege of Power"". In other words: this is the truth according to Mary Mapes. All that aside: is the movie any good? And the answer is: yes, but... It is ""yes"" because Cate Blanchett (as Mary Mapes) gives a towering performance, as if she WILLS the movie to be good. Robert Redford is okay as CBS Dan Rather (but because Dan Rather is so well known and Redford looks nothing like Rather, you never get the sense that you are watching Dan Rather on the big screen, if you know what I mean). The movie is good in a  ""yes, but"" way, because ""Truth"", while at times engaging, is as an investigative journalism movie not nearly as good as other movies in that genre such as ""All The Presidents Men"" (still the gold standard), or that other recent release ""Spotlight"", just to name those (""Spotlight"" is already garnering tons of nominations for the upcoming awards season; ""Truth' is conspicuously absent).

""Truth"" opened in theaters in early November, and the Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay, although I had expected a bigger crowd, given it was the first day it was showing. Despite the movie's shortcomings, Cate Blanchett's performance is of such magnitude that I'd recommend you check this out, warts and all, on Amazon Instant Video or on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions.",1450656000,51,2505,4.82093023255814

It begins in October 2004. Ms. Mapes meets a man for a consultation. She is a producer for 60 Mimutes, she finds news stories. In April Dan Rather addresses a audience after he is introduced. He interviews an Army General about Abu Ghraib, which uncovered a scandal. Mapes tells about an investor in Arbusto, then about how the son of a Congressman was put into the Air National Guard. A news team is looking into George W. Bushs past. Is there a scandal here? They make telephone calls to various people. One man says he had documents that will create a scandal; but they are copies. [So too the Pentagon Papers.] They see a videotape of a politician who didn't know he was being recorded. Dan Rather gets involved. There is a question about the documents, the chain of custody. Can they get the name of the man who gave them the documents? There are differences in the signature but the experts say they are the same man.

Mapes talks to General Hodges about the memos. Is this confirmation? There is a question about superscripts: were they available then? The TV program discusses the pasts of Kerry and Bush. A site questions the authenticity of the documents because of the proportional fonts. [The IBM Executive typewriters used proportional fonts in the 1960's.] they must find the th superscript in the official records from that time; they do! General Hodges now says the papers are fake! This causes a problem. CBS management wants to talk to Mapes source. The source has a new story about the papers! Will he go on the air? Yes; he admits he didn't tell all. To protect people. CBS wants an investigation of the story. They must protect themselves now. CBS News apologizes for the story. An outside law firm will investigate. A private investigator was hired to check their files. There is a dramatic scene on the tenth floor when a reporter is ejected!

Is the investigation fixed to blame the reporters? Mapes father turns on her. [Does he have a hidden agenda?] Her husband asks Mary to fight back. Mary is advised on her defense. There will be no official record, they say. Mapes is questioned by two lawyers and holds her ground. Back home she gets a call from Dan Rather at night, he talks about the news as a business. Dan will no longer the anchorman after the election. Mapes tells off the panel that investigates her. They respond at attack her. Mapes explains the difficulty in forging the documents. Is the burden of proof on the reporter? The investigation leads to her termination, and others. Dan gives his farewell on TV. Goodnight. That panel found no evidence of political bias in the report. But four were fired. CBS won an award for Mapes report on Abu Ghraib.

The second term of George W. Bush led to the worst economic depression since the 1930's. Even two terms of Obama couldn't undo the damage from NAFTA, CMO, and other Wall Street swindles. Could Mapes report on Abu Ghraib resulted in a plot to ruin her career? Since then economic changes led to a decline in newspapers and magazines, and jobs for journalists. This movie is based on Mapes book Truth and Duty, her account of this event. How has CBS been doing since 2004? This movie is slow moving at times.",1518307200,,3218,4.63047285464098

7560971,4,B0192PEOGY,"Review for Truth
Hot Toasty Rag, September 26, 2017

If you couldn't tell by the title, Truth is a true story. Cate Blanchett plays the producer of 60 Minutes, Robert Redford plays Dan Rather, and Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace, and Elisabeth Moss play the supporting crew. In 2004, right before the presidential election, Cate hears of a potential story that President George W. Bushs military record might have been fabricated. With something that serious, theyd better make sure they have a reliable source and can defend such an accusation, otherwise theyll face a terrible backlash from the American public, their own network, and the government!

If you remember what happened in 2004, you won't be that surprised by the plot of Truth. But if you're too young to remember, or you weren't paying attention to politics back then, its a very suspenseful and tense story. Cate Blanchett gives one of the finest performances in her career; I was baffled as to why she was nominated for an Oscar for Carol that year instead. Robert Redford is also very good, and before you get mad at him that hes not doing a good Dan Rather impersonation, you should know he chose not to imitate. He wanted, well, a truthful performance, rather than one that would garner gasps and giggles from the audience as they say, Wow, hes just like him! Dan Rather himself was very pleased with the film, and with Redford.

Not all politicos will like this movie, even though James Vanderbilts screenplay is very thoughtful and suspenseful. If you're a die-hard Republican or thought Robert Redford should have minded his own business in All the Presidents Men, you might not like this one.",1506384000,,1662,4.845070422535211

Truth is a 2015 American political documentary film written and directed by James Vanderbilt in his directorial debut. It is based on American journalist and television news producer Mary Mapes memoir Truth and Duty: The Press, the President and the Privilege of Power.

The film focuses on a 60 Minutes II story that ran on national television in the months before the US 2004 presidential election.  It  purported that then-president-and-candidate George W. Bush not only dodged service in Vietnam but didn't serve time in the Texas Air National Guard, his assigned duty to avoid combat.

7560998,5,B0192PEOGY,"Great story and acting by Kate Blanchett and Robert Redford as Old Man Father Figure Dan Rather of 60 Minutes.  This concerns a team of journalists digging up the military records and related military officers involved with the files of George W Bush as a National Guard pilot in The Vietnam  War.

I enjoyed the snappy dialogue of this crew, the seeming innocence of Elizabeth Moss, and even Dennis Quaid as an aging ladies' man. The old southern military men did their acting bits well, very convincingly.

However, the real Mary Mapes must have been on some weird anti-Bush power trip to think that her investigative story would have put Al Gore into the White House if her mother hadn't died in 2000.  So now she thinks she can get John Kerry into the White House and prevent a second term for Bush.

How?  by showing he had cheated his way out of the Vietnam war duty as most of the sons of the rich and powerful did.  I don't think anyone would be shocked by this.  The American public is a jaded one for many decades.  None of this is a surprise in the least that he went AWOL and was not really qualified as a pilot.

It would be safer to say they didn't like rich boy Al Gore and his negative climate change bore.  And they didn't trust John Kerry aka Fritz Cohen II. Any real Irish person knows that Kerry is not a family name.  If you are going through life with a fake name and nationality, it oozes too much slime.

Bush did a lot of bad things.  All the presidents did.  Journalists can expose what they are doing in office rather than how they skated through young adulthoods of privilege.

I once was in Andover Massachusetts near Philips Exeter academy.  I had heard that the bushes had gone to school there along with many other people of high power and position now.  So I and my sister joined the spring registration tour and had a free lunch in the big and marvelous wooden cafeteria. I loved it and would have loved doing it then as a kid.

So these kids of privilege have it pretty good but maybe not as great as I thought.  Bush seemed to be a fart around much like Obama.  Both didn't study much.

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

Political history is often quite ephemeralwhat seems so relevant in the moment soon becomes ""yesterday's news."" Such is the case with James Vanderbilt's ""Truth."" How many of us remember what happened during the 2004 election? A few months before George W. Bush's election to a second term, Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett), a 60 Minutes producer, uncovered documents signed by Bush's commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian (deceased in 1984), suggesting that Bush received preferential treatment while he was in the Air National Guard in the early 70s. Truth is based on Mapes' book which chronicles her downfall along with her colleague, the iconic TV journalist, Dan Rather.

While Truth may be a story that is fast becoming completely irrelevant in the annals of the overall history of this country, it remains a fascinating footnote in the sub-genre of the muckraker's artin other words, films about journalists and their passion for uncovering the ""truth,"" have proved to be worthwhile contributions to the canon of cinematic suspense stories.

Truth plays out as a detective mystery, as we the viewers are mainly concerned in substantiating the truth (in our own minds) concerning the purloined documents that Mapes ultimately relied on--leading to the 60 minutes broadcast weeks before the 2004 election, which later had to be retracted. Mapes received the documents from Bill Burkett, a not so healthy looking former Lieutenant Colonel, who is (understandably) reluctant to go on camera and name his sources.

Mapes, along with a crack team she's assembled, consult with experts to verify the authenticity of the documents (which proves difficult, since they are photocopies that have been generated numerous times). After numerous phone calls that lead nowhere, Mapes finally hits pay dirt when she gets confirmation from a General Bobby Hodges that Killian's charges are correct--that Bush skipped guard duties to work on a Senate campaign in another state while in the Air National Guard.

Soon after the airing of the 60 Minutes piece, everything falls apart for Mapes when it's discovered the documents were printed on Microsoft Word software and couldn't possibly have been created back in the early 70s. How the ""experts"" could have missed the simple clue that the documents weren't authentic remains unexplained. What's worse is when General Hodges retracts his claim over the phone to Mapes that Killian was speaking the truth about Bush and Burkett reveals that he lied about the source from whom he obtained the documents.

Soon CBS News convenes a special investigative committee that eventually leads to Rather's resignation and Mapes' firing. The committee included a former attorney general under George H.W. Bush, suggesting that the network was not a liberal bastion in the leastserving its own corporate interests by throwing Mapes and Rather under the bus.

Blanchett does quite well fleshing out Mapes, a bundle of energy who has not worked in the network news business since her firing in 2004. In addition to her exciting scenes where she takes on her corporate nemesis, there are also a few additional staid scenes involving her husband, who remains a supportive figure throughout (not so much for Mapes' father, who publicly berates her for the ill-fated 60 Minutes piece).

Redford does a fairly good job capturing Dan Rather's mannerisms but unfortunately he still reminds me too much of Robert Redford to be effective. One still gets the feeling that Rather was a dupe in all this and cannot be held responsible for the mistakes that were made (it was Mapes' responsibility to ""vet"" the documentsRather only had to read the piece on the air).

So what actually happened? Was Mapes the victim of a Republican conspiracy that delivered phony documents which they hoped Mapes wouldn't notice were created on Microsoft software way in the future? Or were the documents (the originals long destroyed) based on oral recollections passed down by people who knew Bush's original commanding officer? Such a group opposed to Bush, couldn't have been very sophisticated, as they ignored the risk of typing their ""copy"" using fonts from a different era.

The bottom line is that Mapes didn't use ""due diligence"" before airing her story. The problem wasn't uncovered before the story aired because Mapes and her team were up against a deadline and didn't have enough time to really ""vet"" the piece. As to preferential treatment for Bushthe story was never denied by our 43rd Presidentand it would seem to me it was likely that some shenanigans were afoot.

Even so, as I pointed out at the beginning of this reviewpolitical history is ephemeral. In the grand scheme of things, does it really matter that George W. Bush did a little ""cheating"" in his younger days, relying on nepotism to get by? The answer is probably no. Nonetheless, Truth is a well-made film on a subject fleeting as the wind.",1477526400,,4985,5.103067484662577

7561045,5,B0192PEOGY,"What is truth? Is it written down on the papers?
Cate Blanchett is an expert and she believed base on her instinct and most of the time she was right and just this one time she just has not enough proof and that lead her to a pit hole and never made her come back. Never be able to see the sun again, never able to work in the broadcast business in her life again.
But then again who can judge that it was a fake or forge that she came up with the fact that President Bush avoided being drafted to Vietnam through his father's political advantages. The proof was there it's just that the copy of the proof was not the original one and there is this slight possibility that the print can be forged because the letter was not current and can be recent version. But there is also possibility that at that time it could be possible that at that time that version can be made by some of the copy machine can be produce that kind of copy too.
It's just that there is not eough proof.
Yes, she made a mistake that she didn't double check before she actually broadcasted through her '60 Minutes' that she is responsible.
The result was critical. All of her team members were fired or at least had crucial impact.
She herself never had a chance to be hired to another broadcasting company in her life till now.

Have you had an experience writing something all night long and the next morning someone reads it and says you are brilliant, you rock!
She and her colleague work for just that.
Not for fame, money or anyother things.
Also they work for TRUTH.
They just want the truth.
And I believe that they just DIGGED IT.
IT's just that they didn't had enough proof!

Sometimes life isn't fair enough.

The one who truely believed Cate Blanchett,  Robert Redford a great guy, a true leader quite the CBS after her being fired and all the investigation, and he no more worked for them. He protested for what had happened.
He could have worked with all the fame, money and dignity.

7561075,2,B0192PEOGY,"This movie wasn't bad, but was a little boring.  Sure Cate Blanchett was great, as were a couple other actors.  In some ways it showed how they would go thru and try to gather evidence and put it all together.  But the problem with this movie was is its premise that it pretends to ""know"" the facts without any substantive proof.  Like we already know what happened but just need to prove it.  They don't know have all the facts of what actually happened.  The reasons they didn't have the proof they needed was because that proof never existed.  Did Bush get preferential treatment? Most likely.  Was he AWOL?  Not likely.  They got some false made up proof that was debunked and that is the reason Mary Mapes and Dan Rather took the fall on this.  But one good thing the movie did tell us was how some journalists will basically stop at nothing to run down a conservative politician.

7561126,5,B0192PEOGY,"It is interesting and poignant that actor Robert Redford played Bob Woodward in ""All the President's Men"" in the 1970's, a film portraying Washington Post journalists who uncovered highly questionable and possibly criminal behavior enacted by the Nixon White House. At the time of the Watergate Scandal which eventually forced the resignation of then-president Richard Nixon, journalists were as highly regarded as they've ever been in the United States, probing the activities of our elected officials in order the public make informed choices fir whom they vote. Woodward was a republican and as far as we know had no political ax to grind in revealing political dirty tricks financed by campaign funds. Woodward and Carl Bernstein's only driving motivation was to find the truth for the public good. Forty years later in ""Truth"", Redford plays television news journalist and CBS News anchor Dan Rather who was involved in a 60 Minutes story in 2004 alleging improprieties concerning President George W. Bush's service record in the military during the early 1970's. Questions about the authenticity of certain documents obtained by CBS News arose after the story aired, and journalists, both television and radio, experienced a wave of public questioning and even disapproval.

Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett in an academy-award caliber performance) and a small team of behind-the-scenes investigators working for 60 Minutes had clues that the current US President George W. Bush may have faked his military record and been AWOL, military shorthand for Absence Without Leave or Unauthorized Absence. The story surfaced in early 2004 when the incumbent was in a fierce battle with then Senator John Kerry who was challenging Bush's reelection bid as the Democratic Nominee for US President. Bush had been in the Texas Air National Guard and questions arose as to whether he had received preferential treatment because of his family connections. In other words, he obtained his spot in the TANG to avoid the Vietnam draft. While that alone may be questionable, it certainly wasn't criminal as there had many ""draft dodgers"" among the US elite. Then some evidence came to light which suggested George W. Bush never actually served in the Texas Air National Guard at all even though the record showed that he was there, but may have been AWOL for at least a year, possibly two, not fulfilling his duties as a trainee and officer. If his military record had been fabricated to conceal he was derelict in his duties as a young officer, it raised serious questions about Bush's character as Commander and Chief of the US Armed Forces.

At first Mapes and her team trace leads but to dead ends, where all living former military personnel of the Texas Air National Guard indicate under no uncertain terms that Bush was legitimately accepted into the program without strings being pulled and that he adequately fulfilled his duties. Then Mapes receives a tip from Bill Burkett (Stacey Keach), a former Lieutenant-Colonel of the TANG. Burkett and his wife meet with Mapes and Mike Smith (Topher Grace) at a restaurant, and there Burkett submits documents which became the focal point of the story. In the film they are presented two documents, but in reality there were six in all. The authenticity of these documents have been continually debated and disputed since 2004. They allege that Bush had fulfilled nearly none of his service commitments to the Texas National Guard and the documents are memos about how his military superiors should deal with his situation, most likely because Bush is a member of one of the most powerful political families not only in Texas but in the United States.

Mapes and her team take the documents and attempt to the best of their abilities to authenticate them with CBS News' document and hand-writing experts. Generally, according to the film, they were more or less authenticated. With the documents and other pieces of the puzzle, they rush a story onto 60 Minutes II which used to air Wednesday nights in the early 2000's. But shortly after the story airs, the world comes crashing in on the 60 Minutes team as other news organizations begin questioning the authenticity of the documents. However, it's not just questioning. The right-wing news media led by Fox News engages in a smear campaign against 60 Minutes and in particular Mapes.

This is an engaging story, one of the best films of 2015, and one of the best films about television journalism, according to the real Dan Rather, who was forced to step down as anchor in the wake of this story. To add insult to injury, CBS corporate has ""disapproved"" of the film, but they won't say why. They refused to allow advertisements of the film's release to air on any of their network affiliates. What is particularly troubling about CBS' responses is that they and 60 Minutes going on about 45 years have been the ""gold standard"" of television journalism. Since the so-called Wigand/Tobacco story of 10 years before ""Memogate/Rathergate"" when CBS corporate feared CBS News might be interfering with a corporate take-over deal involving Viacom in which certain stock-holders would earn millions, this story does not paint a flattering picture of CBS and CBS News. In one very telling scene, Mike Smith explains to one of the other young heads of CBS News that in the 21st century, corporations are taking much interest into what news organizations are broadcasting and which stories shouldn't be aired. Why? Because their corporate interests may be threatened, which begs the question, which is I think the point of the entire film: who owns ""the truth""?",1466380800,,5636,5.037513397642015

7561194,5,B0192PEOGY,"This film tells an important story, very much as it was told in Mary Mapes' s book Truth and Duty. It's serious and detailed,  not light entertainment.
A bonus is that Mary Mapes is played by Cate Blanchett, possibly the best actor in movies today, and she is on screen almost every minute. Blanchett is a different person in every movie. In this one, she's a working girl-- hair messed up and clothes looking slept in.
The history is misunderstood by almost every one. To set something straight, the committee Viacom paid to find fault with the journalists who exposed George W. Bush's irresponsible and illegal romp through the Texas Air National Guard found no bias in the CBS News coverage, produced by Mapes. The worst they did was drop an opinion that the timing was undesirable. Let's be clear: Timing is not part of journalistic ethics. Journalistic duty is to get the story and present it to us, the people. They have no duty to save the story until. . . what. . . a more appropriate time?

7561201,4,B0192PEOGY,"First time film director James Vanderbilt using his own screenplay, based on Mary Mapes book, brings to the screen the events surrounding the CBS scandal of 2004.  Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett), a producer for CBS, and her team had just completed their shocking revelation about the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and were searching for another story.  They began to investigate an allegation that President George W. Bush had received favorable treatment and was allowed to join the Texas Air National Guard and train as a pilot back in the late 60s at the height of the Vietnam War.

The now former Texas Lt. Governor was actually bragging how he used his influence at the request of George H. W. Bush.  While this particular part of the story seems irrefutable, the continuing investigation suggested that Bush rarely went to his assignments once he completed flight school.  One of the key sources only had copies of memos from Bushs military commanders mentioning his absence, but it was difficult if not impossible to fully authenticate them without originals.  Mapes and her team [Mike Smith (Topher Grace), Roger Charles (Dennis Quaid), and Lucy Scott (Elisabeth Moss)] and others were trying to nail down the proof but were on a deadline.  They wanted to get it done to secure a spot on Dan Rathers Evening News program well before the election.

It can be difficult to portray in film much of the components of investigative journalism and keep the story interesting.  Certainly the Oscar winning Spotlight and All the Presidents Men are two great examples where they got it right.  Truth while a very good film, isn't quite up to that standard.  Fortunately this film has Ms. Blanchett in yet another remarkable performance.  Robert Redford as Rather is terrific as well.  So does the film balance the narrative?  I think it does.  Mapes most likely has a political viewpoint, if not overstated.  She and her team seem more concerned with getting another big story however.  This time it would be on Bush, but it might have been someone else.  It also seems fair that the film portrays Mapes as a bit overenthusiastic and somewhat annoyed to have to double and triple check sources and facts.  But I think that was more influenced by time constraints than anything.

While watching this film, I kept thinking about the O. J. Simpson trial being recreated on TV.  I think there are certain similarities.  In Truth much is made of not dotting all the is and crossing the ts, much to the distraction of what the story was all about.  Did President Bush receive favorable treatment and avoid military action during the Vietnam War?  Remember the draft was in effect at this time.  Was O. J. found not guilty because he really didn't kill his former wife and her friend or because the L. A. police were racists?

While this film focuses on the lapses in investigative journalism it also deals with the modern reality that the craft isn't what it used to be.  In one example ABC News instead of pick up on the Bush story and to whether it was true or not, just focuses on the CBS scandal.  In other words, latching on to the material others created.  A slippery slope indeed.",1460073600,2,3173,4.749542961608775

The story should show how ruthless power can be used against the media that dares to discredit those in power, but all of that seems to be buried in monotonous minutiae of the reporting world.

7561282,1,B0192PEOGY,"A disappointing movie that reinforced why the media is unreliable. Documents appear out of thin air, a few experts deliver divided opinions about their authenticity and the media runs with it. Watching the movie, I just couldn't get past the Blanchett character's foolishness in plunging ahead with the thinnest of evidence to discredit the president at all costs. Blanchett's and Redford's characters, while trying to elicit sympathy, only suceeded in further discrediting the entire ""profession"" of journalism. As a former journalist myself, I was appalled at what passed for investigation in this film - it was more like badgering. Glad to be out of the profession, because it has become entertainment, driven by ratings. Glad to see it exposed in this film. With that said, I felt Redford phoned it in, and Blanchett's agenda was too obvious. There was nothing vibrant about the photography or the story, and with one or two exceptions, the minor characters were also very forgetable. Quaid especially was unremarkable, relying on a cheesy smirk instead of doing any actual acting. Lousy premise, a script that didn't showcase anyone in  particular, and too much agenda just ruined it for me.",1459036800,11,1196,5.164948453608248

7561288,5,B0192PEOGY,"James Vanderbilt (The Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2, White House Down, Zodiac, The Rundown, Basic, Darkness Falls)  penned this brilliant screen adaptation of Mary Mapes novel and went on to direct what many viewers believe is the finest film of 2015. How some of the lesser films were nominated and this film wasn't may be due to the fact that viewers don't want to see corruption (exception: SPOTLIGHT and the shoddy production of THE BIG SHORT) or fear criticism of the conservatives.

At any rate this is the story of The Killian Documents controversy in the days leading up to the 2004 presidential election. When veteran newscaster Dan Rather (Robert Redford) and CBS News head Mary Mapes (a stunningly brilliant performance by Cate Blanchett) choose to air a segment on 60 Minutes exposing how President Bush avoided being drafted to Vietnam through his father's political advantages, the resulting fallout ultimately costs them their jobs and reputations. In other sad words, how CBS caved in to the George Bush administration in 2004 to discredit a true news story.

The cast is uniformly outstanding  - Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace, Elizabeth Moss as Mary Mapes team of journalists, Bruce Greenwood, Stacy Keach, Dermot Mulroney, Noni Hazlehurst, Conner Burke, and ALL of the cast members, the pacing of the direction is brilliant, the unraveling of the story compelling, the score, cinematography et al all top notch.

Why was this film overlooked both at the box office as well as the awards? Perhaps that is the follow-up story of how the saying truth will out doesnt always hold true. 5+ stars. Grady Harp, March 16",1458345600,,1624,5.0
7561289,4,B0192PEOGY,"If you are old enough to have lived through the Watergate scandal of the 1970s the forced Richard Nixon to resign the presidency, this more immediate (it all happened during the 2004 election cycle) case of muckraking will point out to you without doubt the way things have changed in American society in the intervening 40 years.

While Watergate was based on uncited sources and real documents, ""Truth"" revolves around the ""60 Minutes"" program that aired in the 2004 election season that cast doubt on President George W. Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard. The bottom line is the CBS team assembled its report quickly, using documents that were of dubious authenticity, rushed the program to get it on the air, and ended up with egg on their collective face later when the whole world seemingly cast doubt on the source documentation used to support claims that Bush shirked his military duty.

The title of the film, ""Truth,"" seems to beg the point from the Watergate era -- that, if you present the honest truth, so what if some of the steps you took to get there weren't quite right, correct or truthful? Isn't the big picture more important than the trail followed to find it? To put it mildly, the answer in this case was a resounding no. This program blew up to such extent it cost Dan Rather and a half-dozen more people their jobs at CBS. The producer of the program, played by Kate Blanchett, is said never to have worked in television again.

So what can you make of such a film? Is it entertaining? Very much so if you enjoy modern politics and reality programming. It details the case against Bush made by the CBS team exactingly, and it later introduces an element -- CBS's corporate ownership -- that may or may not have cast a deciding vote in whether or not to support the case presented on ""60 Minutes."" The movie also seemingly went out of hits way to not present any right wing Republican attacks on the program and instead to allow the elements to gather as they appeared in real life.

I found this movie involving but not particularly ingratiating to the CBS people. It appeared to me, whether true or not, that this program came as close to libeling the president as one can do. It did something I didn't think possible: made George W. Bush a sympathetic victim of the media. This is, after all, the same George W. Bush that was perhaps the worst president in American history, one who sat and watched as 9/11 happened, began an endless war in Iraq over a lie about weapons of mass destruction, and whose policies directly led to the 2008 meltdown of the American economy that ravaged the marketplace and plunged the U.S. into the greatest recession since the 1929 collapse.

Yes, this movie made that guy seem like he was being picked on by a media giant out to get him. And, for her part, actress Blanchett came off as a completely unsympathetic character. Whether this was her and the director's expectation I cannot say; I can only say I felt no sympathy for the outcome she, Rather and others received, regardless of the unfairness involved in the way those cards were dealt.

Finally, getting back to Watergate, this film joins several others -- notably ""Kill The Messenger"" from 2014 and ""Nothing But The Truth"" from 2009 -- that will make clear to you that the new millennium is definitely not the 1970s and that, if you are out to fight City Hall today, you had better have your ducks in a row and cast in concrete before you publish anything ... because people all over the place are going to question the validity of your ducks later and those questions are going to far outweigh the ""truth"" of your conclusions.

If it had been me working for CBS in 2004 and my career was badly sent backward or perhaps even ended by what happened in this movie, I'd have considered my investment in it a waste. Whether or not George W. Bush did or did not appropriately do his National Guard duty in Texas had no bearing on the 2004 election and was not important enough to cost people their livelihoods. That, perhaps, is the way this story is the least related to Watergate.",1458345600,,4111,4.569877883310719

7561337,5,B0192PEOGY,"I was one of the millions of Americans who watched this debacle regarding why George W Bush didn't complete his Air National Guard training . . . and specifically believed Dan Rather to ""get it right."" I thought then that he had gotten it right, but that higher powers had prevailed, and that he had to go on national television, retract his reporting, and resign in disgrace. He had a lot of money, and he was 70, so it wasn't like his whole world fell in. But it did fall in for Mary Mapes, who was the lead investigator and producer, the one in charge of being sure all the evidence was solid. Many years have gone by. I watched Ms. Mapes acquire veneration (and maybe some vengeance) by making sure the Abu Graib scandal got reported. But she never worked for network news again. After watching the film, Truth, I think they got it right back then: I haven't changed my interpretation. The story in the film was told masterfully, leaving it to each individual watcher to make his or her determination of whether Rather and Mapes has been duped, or dumped.

It also gave a great view into how management throws people under the bus when controversy arises. If Brian Williams had been treated as harshly as Rather, maybe he would have learned something.

7561346,3,B0192PEOGY,The movie was well scripted and acted but had an agenda.  The protagonists had a story they believed in but rushed to produce it (prior to an election) without proper diligence.  Their story that Bush used influence to secure a National Guard slot during the Vietnam war and to not properly serve that commitment was decades old and would clearly serve a political agenda if aired just prior to the 2004 election.  If he received extended leave and an early release during 1972-1973 was not exactly a big deal.  The US military was offering early release to officers during that period to reduce costs when manpower was not needed.  The main documented evidence was a CYA memo that had questionable authenticity.  The producer kept claiming that the story was important apart from the proof.  The movie's title is undeserved.

7561381,1,B0192PEOGY,"The movie bombed at the Box Office, making $3.5 million vs. a budget of $9.6 million.

Two months before the 2004 Presidential election, a hit piece aired on 60 minutes. Dan and Mary used unverified documents that turned out to be blatant forgeries.  Within hours of airing, the authenticity of the documents was challenged by internet bloggers.  What they found was documents that were supposed to be made on a typewriter in 1973 actually had proportional spaced fonts made with the 2004 default settings of Microsoft Word.

When challenged, Vice President Johnathan Klein of CBS news said ""You couldn't have a starker contrast between the multiple layers of checks and balances at 60 Minutes and a guy sitting in his living room in his pajamas.""

Dan and Mary were so blinded by their bias, they ceased being journalists and were political activist trying to influence the outcome of the presidential election.  They believed they were right, even if the facts were wrong.

CBS came out with a report in January 2005 and on page 130 it noted that Mary had documented information in her possession before the controversial September 8 broadcast that George W. Bush, while in the Texas Air National Guard, did volunteer for service in Vietnam but was turned down in favor of more experienced pilots.

 In October 2015, Gil Schwartz, the chief spokesman for CBS who is depicted in the film, said ""It's astounding how little truth there is in Truth.""

This fiasco quickly became known as Rathergate. (google Rathergate).

Here's to those bloggers in their pajamas.(google Killian documents controversy and/or or Pajamas Media).",1456704000,13,1625,5.048689138576779

7561383,4,B0192PEOGY,"I remember the brouhaha over the 60 Minutes story that led to the downfall of Dan Rather,  one of TV's most beloved and respected journalists. I knew the general details so I was curious about the deeper facts. I had read this script so I knew the movie would be strong and powerful. And one can't overlook this fantastic cast of leading and supporting actors. All the actors shine in this film. Cate Blanchett, always the professional, is again marvelously stunning. Topher Grace and Dennis Quaid also are exceptional in TRUTH.
The 2004 Presidential elections are coming and Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett) believes she has uncovered a story about President George Bush's military service. He allegedly used political connections to join the National Guard to avoid being sent to Vietnam. Maybe that's not so bad until it appears he went AWOL from his National Guard service.  Dan Rather trusts Mapes that her sources and documents have been carefully vetted and the story airs. Chaos  ensues as reputations and jobs are in jeopardy after allegations quickly arise that the documents clear are forgeries. Or are they forgeries? Mapes, Rather and the team believe their sources are correct but maybe CBS as reason not to antagonize the President.  TRUTH becomes a study of journalistic integrity. What if a seemingly reliable source might actually be questionable? What if a source changes his story or clouds the facts?

Presidential candidate John Kerry did serve in Vietnam and political campaigns brought into question some aspects of his military service so possibly George Bush and questions about his National Guard service were fair game. Still, in the end, it doesn't seem like that much of a story to put careers and reputations at stake.  Never dull but often slow moving, TRUTH will bring up more questions than answers. It's a deep study in politics and the world of news. TRUTH brings up some interesting questions but in the end, Cate Blanchett on screen makes the movie worthwhile.",1456704000,7,1993,5.006042296072508

The movie does bring up some disconcerting facts about powerful people and the abuse of that power. Depending on how you feel about the people portrayed in this account of that story will play into how you feel about this movie. It brings up a lot of questions about how reporters get their stories and their responsibility to insure their accuracy even if it means giving up on story that may be true but is not verifiable. When compared to a movie like Spotlight whose principals went to great lengths to verify a truth that needed to be told, this story to me shows that 60 Minutes failed to meet that standard although their story was possibly the Truth.

7561507,5,B0192PEOGY,"An absolutely engaging and enlightening and entertaining (because a well-written script, even about something this awful, can entertain) movie!  In fact, along with ""All the President's Men"", the  movie ""Truth"" would make for a great double feature on the subjects of journalism and politics.  The former, of course, ends with journalism striking a blow for justice and outright winning against ""the machine"" (of politics and Big business).

""Truth"" shows how sometimes even honourable efforts and intentions can be mowed down if a country allows it's politicians and corporations to make and break laws -- and demands -- that eventually leave freedom and, yes, truth, trampled in the dust.  It also shows that one should NEVER give up the good fight.

Yes, it's a fictionalized account of a true event -- when Producer Mapes and Dan Rather reported a legitimate story, without having 100 percent of the evidence confirmed (some documents were ""only"" copies, but the Rightwing nut crowd and Karl Rove spun stories like Rumpelstilskin, and always with duplicitous intent) --but the director/writer did a terrific job of adhering to the facts.  And along with being a warning about wrongly twisted power of modern politics and Big business, it's also a fine parable regarding the power of mass media (how reporting and news have become less that and more ""entertainment"").  The script is so even-handed that -- because it had been a long while since I read about the story (revelations and _truth_ came out, in the years afterward) -- I was convinced that the movie was going to be about a news crew doing all the _wrong_ things and screwing up the job of reportage.

Instead, it was about how much heart and effort and courage is needed to be _real_ reporter of news in these times of neo-conservative/McCarthy-minded Americans.

7561600,1,B0192PEOGY,"During the 2004 election, a producer at CBS news did a controversial story in the middle of a presidential election. The story was problematic in that it was based on thirdhand photocopies from a crackpot who refused to reveal where the photocopies came from (and further claimed to have inexplicably burned the original documents). The reporters behavior was even more problematic when she began crossing basic ethical lines by, for example, personally introducing her source to the rival presidential campaign. The story blew up in the network's face when critics were able to point out that the documents were in microsoft fonts and were in all likelyhood produced on word. The network launched an internal investigation which went against the reporter in question.

This film is an attempt to retell the story based exclusively from the viewpoint and perspective of the news producer. Despite its title, the film plays fast-and-loose with history and the truth from beginning to end. Everything that doesn't back the reporter is either swept under the run or excused with questionable arguments.

The film unintentionally plays Mary Mapes as a total egomaniac. The impression is given that she runs CBS news, that Dan rather is a news reader who works for her and that the head of CBS news isn't really in charge of anything. The film utterly misrepresents the role of the TV news producer to blow Mapes up into something far more important than she actually was.

The film starts out by openly fabricating the biography of its subject. Mary Mapes did not personally ""break"" the Abu Ghraib scandal alone. She did not ""do"" jail time for not revealing a source. Rather, she was threatened with jail time if she did not produce a full transcript of an interview with a white man accused of dragging a black man behind a pickup truck until that man died. Its uncertain, as far as I can tell, that she personally won two emmys (she did win other awards including a peabody).

The film moves on to explain how CBS works. While outsiders may think that journalists do the stories, according to the film its really the producers at CBS who do everything. Those who work for ""producers"" are simply intern-like minions who help turn the vision of the producer into news. I imagine that is how Mapes views herself, but its an open insult to her profession and those who worked with her. We also later learn that CBS news is really organized like pick-up basketball. If you need to investigate a story, you just hire random people off the street. Mapes also explains that ""nobody reads newspapers"", New York Times who? The real journalism is all done at CBS. Mapes is so important that she just calls into the top of the news division and says that she ""needs"" Dan Rather. It appears that even Dan Rather really worked for Mapes.

When they start getting into the story, the problems are immediate. She says that Ben Barnes is an ""old Texas Pol"" but somehow forgets that Ben Barnes was driven out of politics 30 years before the events in the film by his involvement in a massive political stock scandal and was at the time of the film a rather notorious big-money political fixer and fundraiser. It would be like referring to Nixon as an ""old california pol"" in 1992.

The film then assembles a phony team of ""team"" of experts around Mapes. The experts are mostly there to provide opinions that seem expert but are not. We are shown a soldier handing out flags in military cemetaries. The soldier later comes back to tell us that the Air National Guard is just a dumping ground of ex-military ""jocks"" who want to keep their flight rating and that the Air Guard never trains pilots. The problem with that is this joker is a marine. This is one of many cases where the film presents false information by the opinion of a supposed expert who is not.

Then the get to Bill Burkett and his documents. Contrary to the film, Burkett was well known as a crank years before he ever talked to Mapes. He had already claimed years before that he had been transferred in the military for refusing to cover-up for Bush. Rather than saying what really happened in 2000. That Burkett made claims and then couldn't back them up, the film claims that Burkett was silenced at the time by an attempt on his life. They introduce Burkett's wife as an all-purpose excuse as to why he does things that don't make sense. The wife's introduced concern that her husband will be assassinated by the Bush family explains away everything that was questionable about his as a source. In real life, Burkett faxed copies of the ""documents"" to Mapes rather than handing anything over in person.

We are then told that Mapes was sloppy with her journalism because of Billy Graham and Dr. Phil. Another less than truthful moment. They act that 60 minutes wasn't even a regular program on CBS and that she was fighting for airtime as if she were doing a documentary special. At a certain point its clear that the film is more interested in excuses for Mapes than the ""truth"" of its title.

Then we have another dramatic moment. Not only is Mary Mapes running CBS news, she was personally responsible for the election of George W. Bush in 2000 because she took time off from work when her mother died and did not finish the ""story"" that would have cost Bush the election. One would have thought that those who wrote the script would have managed to keep this sort of egomania somewhat in check.

When the problems with the documents break and its mentioned that ABC news is investigating, Mapes explains that its just a plot to ""get"" Dan Rather. The film glosses over all the problems with the documents by reducing all the questions associated with them to the simple question of if a typewriter in the early 1970s existed with a superscript ""th"". It doesn't solve the problem of the fonts and the spacing or proving that the documents were produced by a that sort of typewriter, but Mapes is ""proven"" right to her own satisfaction.

Then the film uses exposition to show us that all her critics on the internet were hateful, violent, sexist and politically motivated.

The film defuses the revelation of Burkett's lying by spinning the situation to be about evil corporate executives forcing ""good"" journalists to badger a ""good"" man in poor health. By the end, the total fantasy and improbabilty of Burkett's stories about the documents have faded from view. Burkett's story of burning the original documents while preserving copies is just accepted as well as his claim to have received them from someone he didn't know. Things are spun around with Burkett's wife appearing to tell us that Mapes should have protected them as sources and had no right to confront them.

When CBS is forced into an outside investigation, the film again falls back on exposition to make the paranoid claim that the investigation is under the control of the Bush family. There are republicans participating in the investigation which also makes it obviously evil. We are told that one of them was a US Attorney under the Nixon Administration which is shorthand to tell us that he is a baby-eating monster.

Then we get to a series of tantrums:

1) First up is Mapes recently-hired ""ace"" journalist from people magazine. He shows up at the CBS offices as if he had worked there for
20 years and launches into a canned angry speech about the politics of media companies. It has nothing to do with the story or Mapes.
And that is probably the point. Rather than focus on Mapes decision-making or the facts, the film attempts to manipulate through emotion. He accuses CBS of taking bribes in the form of tax breaks from congress in exchange for crushing Mapes. Oh. And this is also about (in 2004)
CBS ""making it up"" to Republicans for running stories on Vietnam over thirty years previous.

2) Then there is Mapes. She is shown first proving the investigation wrong about everything. She then explains to the investigation that the memos cannot possibly be fake because it would be too difficult to fake them. And if someone was good enough to fake them, they would have not used Word to create them. She is basically saying that her personal news judgement trumps document experts and a lack of any real source for the documents.

Then she goes into a speech about how the issue should really be Bush rather than asking questions about how she put the story together or if the story is true. The film, like Mapes, fails to understand the basic ethics of journalism. The story is not more important than the facts or evidence that make up the story. She doesn't understand that the rules of journalism exist to protect the credibility of stories. Ultimately, she fails to understand that she did anything wrong at all.

Ethics and proof matter in journalism. Because minus them, your left with a situation where journalists can make any accusations and the target is left to prove themselves innocent. If the standard for proof is third generation photocopies of documents from an unknown source, that don't exist in any archive, anyone could be accused of anything. Ethics and proof is the difference between the National Enquirer and CBS or the New York Times.

The film reaches a point where she says that her story was no different than what the New York Times did when it ran the Pentagon Papers. But it was very different. There was no doubt about the source or the reality of the Pentagon papers. The government was actively trying to suppress their publication. There were threats of prosecution. Nobody claimed to have burned the only originals and there was no Lucy Rameriz who didn't exist pulling the documents out of nowhere. Then she compares scummy disgraced politician turned political fixer & fundraiser Ben Barnes to Deep Throat. Deep Throat was a senior person in the FBI during Watergate. Ben Barnes was a sleazy guy who was driven out of office in a major political scandal in the 1970s and who in 2004 was raising money for John Kerry's campaign. But she doesn't see the difference.

The film avoids the most damning things she said then and after. For example, while she has one set of views about Bush & Vietnam, she has a very different set of views about Bill Clinton and Vietnam. While everything Bush did is evil, everything Bill Clinton did was absolutely ok. The film steps quietly around her decision to introduce her source on the story to the senior levels of the Kerry Campaign. Its not something she could explain or defend. And the film doesn't have her defend it.

At the end of the film, Mapes wraps herself one more time in the Abu Ghraib story. Again, as if she deserved sole credit for it when that was far from the case. Also, nothing is said about the fact that CBS negotiated with the government to delay broadcast of the story.

Cate Blanchett's performance is ironically good. She captures the egomania of the subject rather well. She comes across as a really awful and reckless person who doesn't understand even the basic ethics of journalism. The film tries to draw sympathy for her every way it can, but with mixed results.

Robert Redford's performance as Dan Rather is not very good. He is playing Robert Redford rather than playing the character. His personality and mannerisms are all wrong. The other huge problem is that gives Rather a charisma which he never had and which was one of his major problems in his career.

In the end, the film doesn't really understand the bigger picture. America has a very complicated relationship with draft dodgers. Its worth noting in that every election from 1992 to 2008, the country picked the draft dodger or the person who didn't serve over the decorated veteran running for president. Being a draft dodger never hurt Dick Cheney or Orsen Welles or John Wayne for that matter. The film's delusion that the 2000 or 2004 elections hung on issues from 30 years before about Vietnam is in retrospect rather silly. People who complain about Vietnam Service inevitably see one side as bad and the other as good based on their personal politics. Thus the same people who question Bush's connections getting into  the guard would never question how exactly Al Gore became a ""military journalist"" during his time in Vietnam. The patriotic republicans who honor the service of veterans have no problem making fun of John Kerry's military service. The people who denounce Bush in terms of the guard have no problem with how Bill Clinton avoided Vietnam. The ""truth"" is that by 2000, Vietnam was a boutique issue in American politics and it never mattered as much as people thought it did.",1455148800,38,12610,4.731329690346084

7561623,3,B0192PEOGY,"It's clear that Mapes et al got caught up in the contest to file a dramatic scoop on a politician, POTUS, whose character did not often present itself with integrity.  All it takes is missing that one i to dot, that one t to cross, and suddenly you have a situation that your foes can blow up into a disaster in the time-honored hunt for ""a fall guy.""  These disasters are embraced by corporate cultures when a reason is needed to shake things up, re-align, re-organize the deck chairs and cover their butts.  Mapes should have known better.

The public faces of these stories--the celebrity journalists like Rather, Wallace, etc.--often have little to do with the investigation and story building, relying heavily on their producers to do all the heavy lifting, seeing their role as the salesperson who who attracts the audience and lends their reputation to the merits of the story.  They provide the broadest of oversight.

This film has a lot in common with The Insider, the story of Mike Wallace, his producer Lowell Bergman, who fought CBS's corporate fear of angering Big Tobacco by publicizing the claims of Jeffrey Wigand, the whistleblower.  In fact, it models one scene on a classic one from The Insider when the story finally makes it to air and the camera shows people in the airport transfixed, accompanied by the score of a mournful Greek chorus in the background.  From there, these two stories take different directions because the Rather story didn't hold up.  The politics, however, remain the same--brutal and selfishly self protective, .  You can almost hear the knives sharpening as corporate men get ready to slash their scapegoat.

Not as evocative as The Insider and surprisingly formulaic.  But the story is told well and keeps your interest.",1454976000,25,1768,4.895973154362416

7561652,3,B0192PEOGY,"THE TRUTH is one of those movies that should have been much more powerful in terms of impact than it actually is. A re-telling of an ill-starred moment in CBS's media history, when the seminal program SIXTY MINUTES ran a story about George W. Bush's military service and ended up being vilified for it it, James Vanderbilt's film makes some trenchant points about the way in which commercial interests often affect the media's perception of what ""truth"" might be.

Yet we have heard this all before, most notably in Sidney Lumet's film NETWORK (1976), where Peter Finch gave a memorable performance as the news anchor speaking out at the end of a telecast and being judged insane as a result. In this film Robert Redford does a creditable impersonation of legendary anchor Dan Rather, whose career came to an ignoble end as a result of the scandal. In Redford's characterization, Rather comes across as a highly competent journalist, the sort of person interviewees believe they can trust, giving him the chance to get the story.

Cate Blanchett takes the other leading role as producer Mary Mapes. With her perpetually tousled hair and aggressive manner, she comes across as the stereotyped reincarnation of the Power Woman, the person who will stop at nothing to get the story. This characterization works well in the film's first half, as she puts together the piece about Bush's career, but she comes across as highly unconvincing in the more intimate scenes, especially in her exchanges with husband Robert (Conner Burke).

TRUTH includes several plot-clichs characteristic of this kind of journo-film, especially at the end, when Mary decides to go against her lawyer's recommendations and tells CBS's investigative committee precisely what she thinks of them. Nothing comes of the move, of course (except Mapes's eventual sacking), but at least viewers are left with the feelgood factor.

Throughout the movie one can't quite help feeling that commercial interests have affected its construction. Distributed by Sony Classics, a subsidiary of Columbia, which is in itself part of the same empire that includes, TRUTH is one of those films that purports to tell the truth about media censorship but actually ends up reinforcing it.",1454803200,6,2237,5.120547945205479

7561656,3,B0192PEOGY,"The problem with a movie like this is people who seek it out already have a bias.  Part of the human condition, unfortunately, is to pre-judge things... we pick a side with very little information going in and then forever after begin to select and disregard new facts/info/ideas/approaches, etc. to bolster what was basically our initially rash rush to judgment.  This very human response is sometimes attempted to be explained through the theory of cognitive dissonance.  Matters not... the bottom line is people specifically going to see this movie already have a notion that will not be swayed.  With that out of the way...
This movie will elicit passions for those who believe they know the fact of the story and they will either love or hate the movie based upon how they perceive it to coincide with their prejudice.  I went into this movie with little prejudgments... though I'll admit to admiring and respecting Dan Rather as a news reporter.  My wife ordered the movie because it starred Robert Redford and she likes a lot of his movies.  After watching several minutes of it she basically came downstairs to informed me that she purchased it on Amazon and said its not her kind of movie but I might really like it... but I have to watch it in the next 24-hours before its gone from our Amazon Video Library.  So the next afternoon, with only 3 hours left I began to watch it... so in a sense I went into this movie blind, not knowing what it was going to be about.  Also once I did start to figure out the story they were telling, I only had a vague memory of the events, and then it was only what most of the general public saw on the evening news.  I was not aware of all the backstory and what was occurring on the Internet and in political circles or about Viacom connection, etc. however I did read the article years ago written by Dan Rather where he gave his historical view of how news programming, including the evening news, changed from being considered a network loss-leader to the need to make it a profit center after the huge the success of 60-Minutes in its early days (the CBS big money maker of the times)... and I recognized how the movie had cleverly turned a summation of that article into a piece of dialog from Rather (Redford on the balcony).  From my perspective I knew and remembered just enough of what happened that I found the movie interesting and it even prompted me to do some Internet researching of those events and the people associated with these events as I was seeking more enlightenment (bottom line, basically the facts of what was told in the movie are true and the events did happened, however the movie leaves much open to interpretation).  So that's me, on the other hand, my wife perfectly represents the average public (non-political) viewer... someone just wanting to see a ""good movie"" and from that standpoint I think this film doesn't quite cut it.  Like most controversial films based upon real events, one usually needs to be prime with enough background information to fill in what the movie makers often take for granted people know about it when writing the dialog and laying out the story board.  The concerns of the movie are often lofty and well be above the heads of most average viewers (who have no idea how reporting of the news has changed over the years) and thus the whole topic may not be thought provoking but instead become rather frustrating if not tedious to watch.  Therefore, I would give this a 5-star rating (recommended watching) for those already interested and knowledgeable on these events but a 1-star rating for everyone else (apolitical general movie goer).... THUS explains my averaged out rating of 3-stars.
Oh and be aware if you've not already figured this out, the Amazon rating system for this particular movie here is merely substituting as another chance to reassert one's vote for president back in 2004.... as most 1-star ratings are from those who love and voted for Bush and most 5-star ratings are from those who didn't like Bush and voted for Kerry.... with only a very tiny fraction of ratings actually based upon the theatrical qualities and entertainment value of the movie itself.

Far right movies aren't being made and if they are they're not seen or featured in theaters across the country. But heroes are created by and for the left in droves. The only thing is most people tend to ignore these films when they hit theaters (see LIONS FOR LAMBS).

TRUTH proposes to tell the real story about what happened to Dan Rather and CBS news when they rushed to present a story that would damage the reputation of George W. Bush during an election year only to discover they had been duped by false documents. I will give them credit in this film for getting most of that information correct. Where it falters is its attempt to still try and make out producer Mary Mapes as a hero destroyed by a conglomerate rather than by her own poor choices fueled by her beliefs. More than anything reporters should remain objective. When that fails they just become advertisers for a cause.

In the days leading up to the Presidential election in 2004 the news people are scrambling to give wall to wall coverage to the candidates running for the highest office. When word reaches producer Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett) at CBS that there is a potential bombshell available that will bring down President George W. Bush she leaps at it. Meeting with Bill Burkett (Stacy Keach) she is presented with documents that show Bush records of time spent in the Air National Guard as being falsified.

As the movie progresses we find that this was a story Mapes pursued during Bush first election but couldn't get traction with because there was no physical proof. With these documents in hand the proof is now there. Or is it? This is where things get muddled as Mapes sends the documents out to be verified. Except that since they're copies they cant be verified. Using a team of experts to find out they are at odds with one another as to the validity of the documents. But Mapes has an agenda and thats what matters.

That mistake ended both Mapes and anchorman Dan Rathers careers. The movie here plays out like many films concerning the press, showing a team of hard working individual in search of the truth who face insurmountable odds to face off against the political machines that hope to destroy them. Except that here we never see any political machine doing that. Instead we see their willingness to accept for fact that which they want to believe rather than to find out the factual and provable truth. An overzealous desire to get the scoop, to bring down the mighty and to reap praise from co-workers supplants the requirement of verifying before taking a story to air. Failure to do so results in what happens in this story.

While the first half of the film depicts the events that led to the story being aired the next half shows how that story was unraveled, not by a right wing conspiracy but as the facts began to actually come out. The documents were proven to be false. Even though this happened the movie still tries to present them as possibly being real. But it fails as did the defense both Mapes and Rather came up with to legitimize their actions. They were blinded by the potential of being stars rather than factual reporters. Thats sad because the truth of the matter is that Rather was indeed a great journalist.

The move is well made when it comes to the technical aspects on view here. Its shot well and moves at a steady pace. But it fails with the storys formation trying to create journalistic heroes rather than real people. None of those who lost their jobs are seen as having learned anything from their ordeal. Rather than admit that they were duped they instead hold their heads high as they leave jobs behind having fought the good fight. Rather than being portrayed as a group that chose to follow a story because it suited their political beliefs, they're shown as standing up for the freedom of the press even if in this case they were wrong. Mapes is shown crumbling into a fetal ball at one point until encouraged to speak her mind and stand up for herself before a committee put together to render judgement on her actions. Like Joan of Arc raising her eyes to Heaven as the flames burn around her, the music swells and she holds her head high. Only a footnote at the end shows Mapes has never returned to work in network news since.

Perhaps the worst moment for me was as the film depicts Dan Rather (played unconvincingly by Robert Redford) leaving on his last night on the air. With an eloquence that Rather actually possesses he says his final words and finishes with an old final word he once used before being asked to stop, Courage. And heres where it goes south. Rather stands to slow motion applause and the music swells with violins creating a sweet and heroic sound as he looks around the room and then makes his way off the set. If you turned away for a moment and turned back you would sear you were watching the ending of THE NATURAL which starred Redford instead of this film.

The movie does tell a story but as for offering truth Im not sure that it actually does so. It did offer a more balanced view than I expected considering the cast and those behind the scenes but in the end those last few digs at anyone who disagrees or who sees this as a bad time for journalism come out and praise is brought back to its two main figures even if what they did was wrong. Perhaps one day a documentary will be made that will offer the truth. Until then we have this film which through enjoyable and easy to watch doesnt quite completely deserve the name its been tagged with.",1454630400,5,5824,4.491973559962228

It shows us how the reporters gathered the Bush air force reserve story and were rushed to meet a deadline. About a third of the way through Rather canonizes Mary Mapes by telling us her biography. The production includes scenes where they have to tell her the resume of Dick Thornburgh, something that most likely didn't happen but was done for us ""stupids"" in the audience.

Redford did a good job. You could close your eyes and see Dan Rather when he spoke. Nailed it. Blanchett did a convincing job of Mary Mapes, a woman who depicted as a hard and honest worker with daddy issues. Since Mapes wrote the book on which they based the script, expect to see a story told from her viewpoint. People who ""are now or have ever been a liberal"" might enjoy this film more than a conservative.

Almost immediately the report is called into question and the careers of everyone involved are in jeopardy. This movie hits all the right notes for me is is a true story, it's political and historical. I was looking forward to this movie, and was not disappointed at all.

Regardless of your political beliefs this is a hard movie to ignore the facts of. I'm not talking about the facts of the report, but the events and the ""witch hunt"" that essentially took place.

8743562,5,B0192PEOGY,"The press has often been called the Fourth Estate, serving as a check on undue influenced against the other three pillars of our democracy, the Executive, the Legislative (Congress), and the Courts.  But the rush to get the Big Scoop out there, which began with the rise of CNN and other cable news outlets at the beginning of the 1980s, and the tendency to spice things up with entertainment paraphernalia that has nothing to do with news has led to mistakes being made.  This became especially true after 9/11.  And the most notorious (though not necessarily egregious) example of this came about in 2004, where an expose done by CBS News on the military record (or possible lack thereof) of then-president George W. Bush blew up so badly in their faces that it resulted in their longtime evening news anchor Dan Rather basically stepping down from the job he had held for twenty-four years.  The story of that scandal was brilliantly told in the 2015 political docudrama TRUTH.

Robert Redford stars as the legendary CBS news anchor who worked with 60 Minutes Wednesday producer Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett) in 2004 on a story where documents are found that suggest that Bushs service record, during the time that the U.S. was involved in the Vietnam conflict, was of a rather dubious nature, and that he may have gotten preferential treatment to join the Texas Air National Guard to avoid actual combat in Vietnam (unlike John Kerry, whom a pro-Bush political action group managed to successfully smear during his 2004 run for the presidency against Bush).  Topher Grace, Elizabeth Moss, and Dennis Quaid are the crack team that Redford and Blanchett assemble to uncover the truth about the contradictions in Bushs record, including interviewing an officer (Stacy Keach) who gives them documentary evidence that Bush may have gone AWOL (Absent With Out Leave) from the National Guard in Alabama in 1972 and 1973.  However, the bottom falls out in the aftermath of the story airing on 60 Minutes Wednesday in October 2004, just weeks before the election, when accusations surface that the documents may have been forged on Microsoft Word, and didn't use the same print type that was used on military typewriters of the early 1970s.  Keach admits to not telling the truth to Blanchett or Redford to protect the identities of those who had given him the documents; and it isn't too long before CBS News, under the protection of chief Andrew Heyward (Bruce Greenwood), must make the decision to investigate whether the procedure was done wrong, and whether Blanchetts liberal politics had any bearing.  While no actual evidence was ever found of either bad procedures or political ax-grinding playing a part, Blanchett finds herself out of a job, Redfords career in some tatters, and CBS News itself having to eat a huge amount of crow.

Vanderbilt, who had already written the screenplays for, among other things, 2003s BASIC and 2007s ZODIAC, not only adapted Mapes book but also made his directorial debut here with TRUTH, bringing the whole CBS News/Dan Rather/Mary Mapes saga to light, with a look at how journalists, particularly of the caliber at CBS, tried to put an important story together, but wound up being smeared with accusations of trying to smear a sitting presidents military record, flimsy as that record may have been, while the pro-Bush Swiftboaters tried to politically maim Kerry, an actual Vietnam war veteran.  Both Redford and Blanchett do good turns in portraying, respectively Rather and Mapes as people who doggedly tried to expose malfeasance and found themselves being targeted for some of that same kind of malfeasance by the people they were trying to investigate.  Grace, Moss, Greenwood, Quaid, and Keach also do good turns; and the film itself does try to show this true story from both sides without malice.  But it does make clear that malice was done, just to the integrity of the Fourth Estate.

The saga that was depicted in TRUTH may very well turn out to be the defining event that would lead to what we saw got started in 2015 with the ascension of Donald Trump and his shrill shrieking calls of Fake News to journalists who question his veracity and other right-wing politicos of his type.  But it is also a film that reminds us how, in the struggle to be the first on air with a big story, the news media can be easily manipulated; how it has to fight back more than ever against the Orwellian term of Fake News; and why good, dogged journalism is needed more than ever.  While people at CBS, and TV journalism did suffer from this incident, TRUTH makes the case that they need not have suffered in vain.",1536710400,,4649,4.851010101010101
