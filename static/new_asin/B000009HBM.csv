8189007,4,B000009HBM,"This film is a must for any Stephen Chow fan. As well as featuring Yeun Wah, Teresa Mo (All's Well That Ends Well) etc. any English viewer will be  dumbfounded at the appearance of Jimmy ""Whirlwind"" White's  performance as the gwailo snooker champ Chow has to beat to save his  village falling into the clutches of a HK business man. With all respect to  Jimmy White (british snooker champ) he could not look more confounded and  oblivious to what's going on in the film and it's nutty behind the scenes  footage at the end. The ""Legend of Dragon"" refers to Chow's  father's (Yuen Wah) Bruce Lee (..""Si-lone.."") fixation and  mirroring his real life, he tells people throughout the film that he did  stunts for the big man in ""...the film where he beats up  foreigners.."". The film features all of Chow's trademarks - sporadic  high energy kung-fu, women getting punched in the face, flawless Bruce Lee  impersonations, gormless gwailos and in-jokes on HK films past and present.  My favourite joke is when Chow leaves the mainland to visit HK for the  first time, Yuen Wah makes him promise not to fight and get into trouble,  and gives him a sealed note "".. only see what it says when you fear  for life..""- Chow promptly gets in trouble with some local thugs as  soon as he gets to HK. He opens up the note, which simply says  ""FIGHT!"" and beats up them all up with an umbrella to the Wong  Fei Hong theme (From Once upon a Time In China).",967939200,3,1442,4.498069498069498
