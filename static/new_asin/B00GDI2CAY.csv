The movie does a great job of depicting the life of military personnel in a remote location and how the camaraderie helps you get though the assignment.  Now throw something alien and lethal into the close knit group and all hell breaks loose.  The Navy personnel were on top of things and worked hard to battle against something that was difficult to fathom at first.  The acting was decent but the depiction of the Navy personnel from mid-level up to the rear admiral was well done and very accurate to the normal competence you would see in real life.  Nicely done!",1474070400,,668,4.533333333333333
8622363,1,B00GDI2CAY,"I love old sci-fi / horror movies, even the less than big budget ones. I had been looking for a copy of this one for a while. I was intrigued about the behind the scenes story of the making of the movie and blended stock footage. The quality of the original print is not so great in places but I doubt this movie is high on the list for restoration.  It was still watch-able. The biggest problem is that  about 3/4 of the way through my copy the movie freezes and won't play.  If it had worked properly I would rate it around 3 - 4 stars as bad films go.",1461542400,,554,3.972972972972973
