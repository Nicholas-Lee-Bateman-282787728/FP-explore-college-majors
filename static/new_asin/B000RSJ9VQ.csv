2874827,5,B000RSJ9VQ,"If anyone knew anything about the people, the scientists, the Teachers with degrees ect., that put these videos, ""CREATION ADVENTURES"", out there for kids to view and the adult DVD's..You would simply take in the information as I have and enjoy their point of view and not get so irritated about it..
 I have met some of these people and been very impressed...even my friend who was there and met them as well...she has a HUGE question as to whether GOD created or not..But their knowledge made her re think a lot of what she believes...So, I really think these Dvd's are VERY helpful and full of great teaching.
People that have such negative comments in here seem to not care about difference of opinions. These dvd's are a wonderful tool for learning.
Can't people simply see it as a difference of opinion? Where is your tolerance?  Where is your respect of another point of view? Why be so Rude?
Why couldn't you simply allow this video to be something that that has been brought to the table as a Christians point of view? Why rant and rave about it? If you don't agree, that's your right, but why go on about it in a review..( I seem to be doing the same thing..yes...LOL)
I feel that you really have an argument about the ""WHO"" they are teaching has created this universe, which plainly points to GOD.
 BLESS you .....",1312070400,8,1325,4.5125
2874828,1,B000RSJ9VQ,"I don't even know how to describe the level of absolute scientific ignorance is employed in this video.  If you want to brainwash your kid into an irrational religious belief, this is the video you're looking for.  This video is not a substitute for actual fact based reality.

I received this as a gift from someone who thought it was an actual Science video.  there isn't ANY science in this video, its a training and conditioning tool used to condition kids into denying Science, remaining willfully ignorant.

It suggests to children there are no answers to question Science has answers to.  That Human beings and 40 foot meat eating dinosaurs existed together, does the video produce any Science to back that up? No, it just compares Science to the Bible and if the Science doesn't fit into the bible box, the video says the Science isn't true, the bible is.

It suggests we can't know what an animal ate based on it's teeth, not realizing the difference in teeth from Herbivores and Carnivores and Omnivores.

The video amounts to conditioning Children to dismiss anything that might contradict the bible says.  It amounts to telling your kids,  if it's not in the bible it's not true.

Being a good Christian doesn't come from dismissing good science, but embracing the world we can unfold.",1300406400,15,1297,4.797297297297297
2874829,1,B000RSJ9VQ,Not much else to say.  Anyone with a middle-school level knowledge of science could tell you how ridiculous this is.,1290384000,18,116,4.8
2874830,1,B000RSJ9VQ,"I personally believe that every person has the right to their opinion and to practice any religion they so choose.  However, I don't think people have the right to deceive others.  And that is precisely what this video attempts to do: deceive.  Couching itself as scientific and blatantly appealing to children through the use of computer graphics and puppets, these videos attempt to show that Creationism is a valid scientific theory and worthy of respect.

Alvin Plantinga an esteemed scientist, who by the way is Christian and very vocal about his beliefs, defines science this way:

  1. a systematic and disciplined enterprise aimed at finding out truth about our world, and
  2. has significant empirical involvement. Any activity that meets these conditions counts as science.

The information contained in this video is based on neither of these axioms.  Everything within this video flies directly in the face of centuries of scientific research, with the only basis for its claims being ""the Bible tells us so.""  Nevermind that there are many varying interpretations of what is written in the Bible and that even the Catholic church--bastion of conservatism that it is--recognizes that the Book of Genesis is meant to be interpreted figuratively and not literally (as this video does).

This video promotes ignorance.  It encourages people to blindly believe things without exploring the facts for themselves.  I cannot recommend this video for children because if they repeat to others what is contained in this video, they will simply be laughed at by pretty much anyone with an education or even an inquiring mind--including other Christians.

This is not an attack on Christianity.  I have seen Christianity bring remarkable joy and peace to people's lives.  That is why it is even more important, I think, that people do not tarnish Christianity by promoting junk pseudo-science such as this.  As Alvin Plantinga has explained, there is no conflict between evolution and Christianity.  Evolution tells us how creatures evolved--it doesn't tell us why.  Some choose to believe that ""why"" is God, which is fine.  Therefore, this video is not only unnecessary, it is harmful to both children and the reputation of Christianity itself.",1275609600,39,2247,5.2005571030640665
2874831,5,B000RSJ9VQ,"I, AS RELIGIOUS TEACHER, STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS SHOW FOR EVERY CHRISTIAN PARENT AND RELIGIOUS TEACHER. KIDS FROM AGE 7 TO 10 REALLY LIKE THIS SHOW. IT IS OF GREAT HELP IN EXPLANING WHY EVOLUTION HYPOTESIS IS UNLOGICAL. GREAT THING IS THAT IT GIVES SOME OF GEOLOGICAL ARGUMENTS FOR YOUNG EARTH, NOAH'S FLOOD AND RAPID BURRIAL OF LIVING FORMS IN FLOOD, SPECIALLY DINOSAURS. IT GIVES INFORMATION ON HOW NOAH BUILT ARK AND PUT EVEN SAUROPOD DINOSAURS ON ARK. IT INFORMS ABOUT UNFOSSILIZED DINOSAUR BONES AND UNFOSSILIZED T-REX SOFT TISSUE AND BLOOD CELLS AS STRONG EVIDENCE OF YOUNG HISTORY OF LIFE ON ONLY THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLD EARTH. IT IS ALSO HUMOROUS AND DYNAMIC MATERIAL. GREAT !

2874833,5,B000RSJ9VQ,"these are some of the most idiotic people i have ever watched on television!
the content of this dvd was ridiculous!

what thses people are doing to science is like taking a loaf of bread, putting bunny ears on it and calling it a rabbit, its just that stupid

BUT
i gave it 5 stars. why?
because the crap on this dvd is so unbelievingly asinine that it was actually funny!, in that stupid, un-fulfilling sort of way

i cant beleive they are forcing this stuff down the throats of children hahahahaha... poor kids....",1188691200,24,517,4.4787234042553195
2874834,5,B000RSJ9VQ,"This video includes some animation, and humor to help keep the attention of younger students while they are learning about dinosaurs in creation, and on the ark with Noah.

2874838,1,B000RSJ9VQ,"This is the lowest form of Creationism- targeting children with distorted and completely false information which misrepresents actual science. This video series takes a collection of the most rudimentary creationist lies (including plenty that even most professional creationists wouldn't dare touch) and runs with it, to the point of even portraying the lies themselves are completely laughable. It's nearly as bad as the tripe Kent Hovind was spewing (before he was imprisoned for tax fraud, among other things), and easily outdoes stupid creationist arguments like Ray ""Bananaman"" Comfort's Banana Argument.",1363910400,22,610,5.788888888888889
2874839,5,B000RSJ9VQ,I purchased this DVD to replace our old VCR tape.  I thought it was worth replacing.  This is one of the best creationist videos out there about dinosaurs.  It was professionally done and keeps the kids' attention.  The whole family thinks this is a winner.,1359763200,7,257,4.644444444444445
2874840,5,B000RSJ9VQ,"A little too much information in one sitting for children, so it's better to watch it in thirds and then discuss what they learned after each segment.  But my son thought it was funny and it covers everything from creation, the flood, the existence of dinosaurs and the result of sin.  Liked it much better than Six Short Days, One Big Adventure...that one was cheesy.",1358467200,8,368,4.6461538461538465

2874842,1,B000RSJ9VQ,"This video reminds me of a saying.

It's okay to have a penis (creationist belief)

it's okay to be proud of it (though it's wrong)

But please don't wave it around in public

and for the love of God, don't shove it down your children's throats.",1336867200,14,245,4.260869565217392
2874843,5,B000RSJ9VQ,"I have a seven year old and twin 10 year old boys and all three loved this DVD!  It keeps things moving and includes concepts that keep the kids thinking after the show is over.  Creatively done with funny characters and a mix of cartoons, high tech puppetry, and actors keep the kids interest all the way through.  They've even asked to watch more from the series.  Well done and very fun!",1312156800,17,390,4.375
8202433,1,B000RSJ9VQ,"Horrid production. I won't take points off for special effects as they clearly had a low budget and I stand by the fact you can make something worthwhile on a very low budget, but honestly I think this is absolutely atrocious. People are entitled to their own beliefs, but when those beliefs stepped into hard proven scientific fact, they need to have evidence to back them up. Not only does this special absolutely fail to cite any of its sources to prove anything, it blatantly lies about other facts to make their arguments seem better. If you need an example, the special claims that 'Buddy' and his team uncovered about 100kgs of unfossilized dinosaur bones in Alaska, and says this is proof dinosaurs lived until very recently or else the bones could be fossilized. Thus far, over a decade and a half later, Buddy and the Creation Museum have failed to display, making any reports on, or even show a picture of these suppose a dinosaur bones. And when they were asked about them, they removed any mention of them from the websites and only survives in this documentary and its accompanying book.

In other words, they lied. It also teaches children to be on trusting and condescending toward scientists, a vast majority of whom in America I will note are Christian or have no quarrel with the Christian religion. Instead the special very blatantly implies people like paleontologists and geologists are actively trying to lower people away from the faith and are afraid of the 'truth'.

Oh and on a faith basis, it completely mishandles and lies about the story of Noah's flood and its purpose in theology.

So,-

-Lying about science, check.
-Teaching impressionable kids false ideas about other people, check.
-Lying about their own religion to abide by their needs, check.

There's making your points, and then their is just rabidly attacking something. I'll give you one guess what the special does.",1523404800,,1909,4.861538461538461

8202436,1,B000RSJ9VQ,"Great misinformation! Sorry but humans didn't walk with dinosaurs. This video is basically claiming the flintstones as historical fact, people claiming this shows evidence for men and dinosaurs walking around Together but it's best arguement is ""where you there?"" But they don't acknowledge THEY WERENT THERE EITHER they refuse to show evidence for the claims made in this video, they have a fundamental lack of understanding of the science of evolution that is the foundation for modern biology. They don't even use the taxonomy system. They think individuals evolve into a different animals rather than the species (not ""kind"") evolving.

If you want to wrap yourself in a delusion and smother yourself in Biblical lies, this is the video for you. The acting, (if you can call it that) is horrid, (a bone cam, seriously?) The shoddy camera work and very low production values place this video in the ""direct to garbage can"" category. Honestly, this video is steeped in the fundamental religious dogma of a 6000 year old earth.
