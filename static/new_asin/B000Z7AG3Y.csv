3038043,5,B000Z7AG3Y,She is great. She is funny without using nasty words. If you want a good laugh without a lot of filth she is what you ned to get.,1357430400,,129,3.642857142857143
3038044,5,B000Z7AG3Y,"If you prefer clean humor, this is perfectly appropriate, supremely funny, and also deeply meaningful.  As a pastor's daughter myself, I relate specifically, but who wouldn't enjoy?  I've seen many of Chonda's, but this is my favorite.",1354579200,,235,5.324324324324325
3038045,5,B000Z7AG3Y,"The DVD arrived quickly--thank you for your excellent service.  The DVD, Stayin' Alive...Laughing, by Chonda Pierce is one of the best I have seen.  It is very funny but it spoke to me very much.  Gather your friends and family to view this with you--you will be blessed.",1342396800,,271,4.604166666666667
3038046,5,B000Z7AG3Y,I was very pleased. My order was received in a timely manner and the packaging was very good Would recommend to everyone,1311724800,,120,4.5
3038047,4,B000Z7AG3Y,"Chonda cheered me up eventually with this movie. It's a bit irreverent and slow about the first third of this DVD. She makes fun of various people and keeps saying ""Naked, naked, naked..."" She jokes about the differences in many Christian churches. Later she points out the humor in how some men in the church frown on anti-depressants while the drug of their choice is in their own pockets. She talks about Adam and Eve and how we can find joy even though we mess things up.

She suggests that even though Eve ruined the world, she was able to find joy. I believe what Eve did was heroic because she was seeking knowledge to help create children (which God had commanded her to do). The only way for her to do that was to take the fruit and realize her sexuality (nakedness) and accept responsibility for the consequences. I found Chonda's conclusions inspiring and uplifting despite our different views on this.

I would like to view this again. The funniest part is in the bonus piece where she dresses up in all kinds of dancing outfits, even as a blond Elvis!",1284681600,3,1064,4.536458333333333
3038048,4,B000Z7AG3Y,I was satisfied enough that I got this copy for a friend who watched my copy,1284422400,,76,3.8125
3038049,5,B000Z7AG3Y,This DVD is for all who love to laugh.  Chonda is such a cut-up! Love her quick wit and she also has a great set of pipes.  Five Stars for Chonda.,1262995200,4,146,3.6774193548387095
3038050,5,B000Z7AG3Y,"Chonda Pierce does great ""down-home"" comedy, primarily aimed at women, but doesn't leave the men entirely out of the picture. Her brand of comedy talks about differences between how men and women view their world in such a funny way, that you can't help but laugh. She is also an excellent singer and mixes her two talents to create hilarious parodies of popular songs that you'll want to hear many times. More importantly, however, is that time near the end of each program when she will tell a story from her personal life that will tell everyone that no matter how deep their personal pain is, Jesus is there to bring you back to life. While the phrase ""You'll laugh, you'll cry"" has been heard in many places, here it really is the truth. I have most of her programs and enjoy them all.",1242604800,17,790,4.493055555555555

3038054,3,B000Z7AG3Y,"I have heard Chondra on XM radio, and she was hilarious.  I was very disappointed with this performance as it seemed very disjointed, and at times it was hard to hear her.  Maybe this was some of her earlier work and she has gotten better with age.",1395964800,,248,4.25531914893617

3038057,5,B000Z7AG3Y,"I have been a Chonda Pierce fan since I was a teenager. Through teen years, young adult, pregnancy & single motherhood, marriage & even more babies... Chonda has been an inspiration through it all. She has a way of making you laugh so hard & then instantly turning all of that into a powerful & uplifting message that leaves you feeling so spiritually full. I love it. And you can always find some way to relate no matter what your current walk in life is.
I highly recommend any of her DVD's.",1376784000,2,493,4.369565217391305
3038058,5,B000Z7AG3Y,"We watched this DVD before sending it to a friend. It was a very good 120 minutes of good clean humor and challenging thoughts at the end. I would recommend this for anyone who may need a ""pick-um-up"" evening of relaxation. A good Christian DVD.",1375574400,,245,4.466666666666667
3038059,5,B000Z7AG3Y,We had a ladies fun & games night.  Laughed hysterically playing games and then showed the DVD so the laughter continued.  We only had time to see half.  (It's about 1 1/2 hours!) They can't wait to see the second half.,1371427200,,219,4.2926829268292686
3038060,5,B000Z7AG3Y,Chonda Pierce is a motivating person with a wonderful gift. She brings laughter to your soul which is much needed...,1365379200,,116,4.85
3038061,5,B000Z7AG3Y,"Chonda Pierce is amazing...She had B-I-G emotional challenges in her life growing up and then, much later, suffered from serious clinical depression.  She barely alludes to some of that here; more on that is learned in reading one of her books.  However, what an inspiration this woman is!  Whether you just want to spend time sharing fun or you want to SEE that depression can be overcome (which is NOT in any way a theme of this performance or DVD) this is a terrific way to invest your time - solo or with friends or family.  Chonda's performances are geared to women but are suitable for anyone.  A wonderful comedian, but by the end, she will also touch your heartstrings.",1361836800,,677,4.608333333333333
