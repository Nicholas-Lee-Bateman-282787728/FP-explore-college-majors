7730324,5,B01E5XMF9Q,A private detective coming out of retirement. Great show and good idea.,1465603200,,71,5.0
7730325,4,B01E5XMF9Q,"The picture quality is not that bad, about on par with what was released by Paramount/CBS for Cannon.  It is clearly not re-mastered but it is very watchable.  I would give it a B to B- where Cannon was a B to B+.  My main complaint is that the picture was a little more degraded becasue they did not use the original film masters and there are more film defects like rolling lines, and artifacts but they usually only last a second or two and don't distract too much from the viewing experience.  Unfortunately about 2/3 of the episodes have been edited from their original versions and are missing around 3-5 minutes of footage including the Quinn Martin Act sequences at the beginning of each scene.  Some of the edits are more noticeable than what I have experienced before.  In fact in one instance I could swear the scene cut to a break in the middle of a character's line!  Overall though, for the price I paid ($17.99) I feel it is well worth it.  I will probably wait to buy Seasons 3-8 and Cannon Season 3-5 once they fall in the $10-$15 range which if the history of VEIs other classic releases is any indicator that should be within a year or two.  I don't think they are worth the $35 they currently want for them.  I love these old 70's shows and hats off to VEI for finishing them.  We really can't fault them for the short comings in picture quality because they could only release what CBS gave them for source material.  I would rather have them like this than not at all, but in a perfect world...",1465516800,2,1516,4.355871886120997
7730326,4,B01E5XMF9Q,This second season of Barnaby Jones was very good. Buddy Ebsen and Lee Meriwether were great together throughout the series. Barnaby was also another great detective who always gets his man at the end.,1465084800,,201,4.9411764705882355
7730327,3,B01E5XMF9Q,I have seasons 2 and 3 picture and sound quality are missing compared to season 1. Also it's a Quinn Martin exclusive to Act 1 through act 4 they are missing from the originals aired. I love the show regardless and glad to be able to watch season by season hate those big box sets.,1464480000,2,281,4.127272727272727
7730328,4,B01E5XMF9Q,"I was glad to see that Barnaby Jones was now going to be released by seasons rather than having to purchase the entire series at once.  I had already purchased season one when it was originally released and had been waiting for the remaining seasons to be released.  I actually bought season two on Ebay before seeing that it was available on Amazon.  I am midway through my viewing of season two and I am satisfied with what I bought.  There have been criticisms that the episodes are not complete and that is true, most of the episodes are coming in at a running time of 46 minutes, but there are some complete episodes that run the full original 50 minutes however.  The editing hasn't harmed the stories as far as I can tell though.  Also, although VEI hasn't remastered these episodes, the picture quality and sound is fine.  I am really enjoying watching this series once again and plan on purchasing the remaining seasons over the coming months.",1463788800,6,952,4.597633136094674
7730349,4,B01E5XMF9Q,"DVD quality is terrible looking like something taken off youtube unlike S1 which is glorious and bright. The DVDs are scratchy, dark and look like television of the 70s, no clean up, remastering= nothing.... too bad, as the show finds its grove and is a nice treat to watch.",1478304000,,274,4.612244897959184
7730350,1,B01E5XMF9Q,"Don't waste your money on this Barnaby Jones DVD release.  It was a great show but, as others have noted, the episodes have been badly and obviously edited.  There is no excuse for this.",1475280000,2,186,4.4411764705882355
7730351,2,B01E5XMF9Q,"Well, I like these series. Ingenious plots and Barnaby Jones is a detective, that is not good looking, young or whatever you might expect from the leading man from a cop show. That is also very good. Don't judge a book by its cover. The bad thing here is the quality of the product. Beware: picture is not very good, the sound sometimes is just awful, the image sometimes goes in black. They can do a better job and VEI did an acceptable job with The Protectors, which is even older than Barnaby Jones. Sad",1473811200,,506,4.336842105263158

7730353,5,B01E5XMF9Q,Barnaby Jones season 2 is great.,1472256000,,32,4.5
7730354,1,B01E5XMF9Q,"Over the pathetic treatment his landmark series has received. Poor quality, butchered episodes is not the worst. The gouging price is hilarious. I would not give 99 cents for one of these seasons. This is a primer in HOW NOT to release a classic television series. One star far more than this drek deserves. You foolish followers can be sold anything!",1472083200,,351,4.770491803278689
7730355,2,B01E5XMF9Q,"First of all, Barnaby Jones is an excellent show BUT season 2 DVDs have been butchered. Some episodes have a few minutes cutoff and others just end abruptly; the video transfer appears to be from an old VCR recording. The is no excuse for this as there is plenty of available space on DVDs for the full, unedited run. I would not have purchased this if I was informed it was edited. In the future I will read all reviews before anymore DVD purchases.",1471392000,13,450,4.369047619047619
7730356,4,B01E5XMF9Q,"Absolutely loved Barnaby Jones as a youth and waited 6+ years for Seasons 2-8.  As others have mentioned, it's very disappointing to see the significant difference in quality from Season 1. Many ""Acts I - IV""- are missing and poor transitions between scenes.  However, if you enjoy Barnaby Jones as much as I do, it's worth the purchase.",1471305600,,337,4.793103448275862
7730357,2,B01E5XMF9Q,"The content is great, but the reproduction is very poor. Season's 1 reproduction was excellent.",1470787200,,95,5.4

7730369,5,B01E5XMF9Q,Just like watching old shows. Family tv,1469664000,,39,4.714285714285714
7730370,4,B01E5XMF9Q,"I absolutely love this series! I only gave this season 4 stars because I concur with other reviewers who have expressed dissatisfaction with the editing of the show. It is obvious that the shows are shorter than the first season and that, in some cases, the transitions are not very smooth. Still, it's better to have these episodes than not, so I'm pleased overall.",1469232000,,366,4.734375
7730371,5,B01E5XMF9Q,Just excellent,1469145600,,14,6.5
7730372,1,B01E5XMF9Q,Too bad CBS cares so little about these great old programs they leave the distribution in the hands of butchers. The episodes are incomplete; no epilogues. I'm glad I didn't get the entire box set. What a shame. All of the Quinn Martin shows deserve better.,1468972800,,257,4.608695652173913
7730373,2,B01E5XMF9Q,"The series is wonderful. Ebsen is a low-key, but solid, delight and Meriwether is such an amiable, soothing secondary presence. Also there is a wide variety of guest stars and types of stories, so that it doesn't get too repetitive or overly formulaic. The low rating is for this particular presentation of the show. Season One was MAGNIFICENT. Pristine visuals and excellent representation (my only carp being that one episode had a ""bleep"" in it. Apparently, language that was allowed on TV in 1972-'73 is now considered too hot for our ears?!) This season the visual quality is WAY below the previous - like 2nd or 3rd generation video - and roughly half of the episodes have been edited down by about 4 minutes. Scenes just cut off without being completely over and all the iconic ""Act I"" and ""Act IV"" graphics have been trimmed off... Really shoddy and jarring. Sad to see the show treated so poorly by the manufacturers.",1467676800,7,926,4.75776397515528
7730374,4,B01E5XMF9Q,Only drawback is that the seasons after Season 1 are not Prime Quality....Most episodes are lesser quality prints ... Picture is fine but like what you would see on TV not restored to Broadcast Quality....,1467158400,,205,4.885714285714286
7730375,1,B01E5XMF9Q,Terrible picture! Season 1 was very good.,1466726400,2,41,5.0
7730376,5,B01E5XMF9Q,"One of my favorite shows as a kid and still is today. I have had bootlegs for years but were almost unwatchable but still worth having.
Then I got season 1 and it was excellent quality with opening TV spots! but Season 2 is not re-mastered and doesn't have the TV
spots. Some of the episodes have the ACT I, II, III etc...before each ACT like first aired some do not. Some are good to very good
quality some are not and look to be taken from some other source or straight from VIDEO! but still better than bootleg reruns. I am
so glad to have my favorite season of BJ and will get the 3 and 4 before JR joined the cast. I may replace all my bootlegs but at 30.00
and up I am going to wait for the prices to come down. The original 4 seasons are the best of the series but all are still great and so
much better than the crap from Hollyweird today! This is a must have for TV detective and Buddy Ebsen fans. Drink some milk and enjoy!",1466553600,,933,3.9946524064171123
7730377,5,B01E5XMF9Q,Great series with Buddy Ebsen..another great series from QM Productions!!!,1466380800,,74,6.5
7730378,5,B01E5XMF9Q,Thank you!,1465776000,,10,4.5
8757724,4,B01E5XMF9Q,"I agree with everyone.
First, the acting and presence of Mr. Ebsen, is so excellent.
The way he is friendly to suspects, yet plays with their minds, is so ingenious and essential to the show.

Even, the aw shucks mentality, is great.

Lee is just so great, so warm and genuine. She is one of only a few actors, that had a real genuine smile, Doug McClure being another.

However, every episode in season 2, is about murder. That gets old. Season 1 had variety, and Jones rarely used a gun. Season 2 almost always has him plugging someone.

The biggest concern, though, is that every episode in Season 2, save one or two, is the exact same format:
Crime committed. He immediately has a very good idea who it is, then associates with the suspect, until he can prove the case.

Lastly, yes, it is very unacceptable to cut off part of the episode.
No epilogue really and most episodes the viewer doesn't fully understand the outcome.

But there are no other manafacturers, so I happily ordered it.

To see Buddy Epsen immediately after the long run of the Beverly Hillbillies, and not feel that he was typecast, is so great. You really think you are watching Barnaby, not Jed.",1534550400,,1172,4.5260663507109005

8757726,1,B01E5XMF9Q,"All the other negative reviews on here were SPOT ON!!  Season 2 is absolutely terrible.  The picture quality is not clear and in one episode, the picture rolled on several occasions.  Season one which was released by CBS was excellent.  I would not recommend buying this season nor would I purchase anymore seasons.",1492473600,2,315,4.886792452830188
