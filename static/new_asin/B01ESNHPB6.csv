8759493,5,B01ESNHPB6,"""Trois souvenirs de ma jeunesse"" (French title). This is one of the best movies ever made specific to the genre. ""My Golden Days"" is the prequel to "" Comment je me suis disput&eacute;... (ma vie sexuelle))"" (1996, ""My Sex Life... or How I Got into an Argument"").  Both movies are the memoirs of the character Paul Dedalus played at different times in life by Mathieu Amalric.  ""My Golden Days"" is Paul's reflection on his life as a middle aged, successful man looking back over his surprising (or not so surprising) life.  It focuses heavily on youthful misadventures and a lost love.  The first time I saw it in a theater I said that up to the half-way point it was one of the best movies I had ever seen.  Then it does loose it's way a bit.  However all is forgiven by the last 3 minutes and esp. the very final sentence uttered.  Enchantingly bittersweet with standout performances by Quentin Dolmaire as the youthful Paul Dedalus and Lou Roy-Lecollinet as Paul's lost, but unforgettable love, Esther.",1494720000,,1004,4.670454545454546

8759500,4,B01ESNHPB6,"""My Golden Days"" (2015 release from France; 123 min.; original title ""Trois Souvenirs De Ma Jeunesse"" or ""Three Memories from My Childhood"") brings (further) stories from Paul Dedalus. As the movie opens, we see Paul and his Russian (?) girlfriend lament the fact that Paul is returning to France after 8 years away. It makes him think back to his childhood, and we flash back to Paul as an 11 yr. old boy, fighting with his (mentally deranged) mother. Back to the current day, Paul is being stopped by French officials at the airport for ""passport problems"". At this point we are 10-15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: when I wrote earlier that this movie brings the further stories of Paul, it is because writer-director Arnaud Desplechin made a previous film about this character, 1996's ""My Sex Life... or How I Got into an Argument"", with the role of Paul played by Mathieu Amalric, who reprises the role almost 20 years later. I admit I haven't seen the 1996 film, but that didn't stop me from checking this out, as I think Amalric is one of France's finer actors of this generation (check him also out in the recent ""La Chambre Bleue"", ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", etc.). ""My Golden Days"" turns out to be a somewhat nostalgic look back to the 'good ol' days'. Of the ""three souvenirs"" referenced in the original French title, by far the longest amount of time is spent on Pauls' relationship with Esthel during Paul's university days, and set somewhere in the late 1980s. I grew up in nearby Belgium just a few years earlier (doing uni in the early 80s), and I can attest that the director captures the mood of those university years perfectly. It's probably the reason why this movie resonated with me so well, but I also want to emphasize that if you didn't grow up in Europe during those years, you'll still 'get it'. Newcomer Lou Roy-Lecollinet, in her first role on the big screen as Esthel, is simply outstanding, and surely we have not see the last of her. Last but not least, there is a bunch of great music featured in the film, both as to song placements and the original score, the latter courtesy of acclaimed French composer Grgoire Hetzel (""Incendies"", ""Intrusions""). A quick look around tells me that the score is available on Amazon France.

""My Golden Days"" premiered at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, to general critical acclaim. Not sure why it's take so long to play in US theaters, but this past weekend, the movie opened without any pre-release buzz or advertising at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I know what that usually means (a one week run). The Wednesday evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. That's a darn shame. Hopefully this is a movie that can find a wider audience when the DVD finally comes out. If you are in the mood for a nostalgic yet effective foreign film that looks at what it was like growing up in France in the 80s, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Trois Souvenirs de Ma Jeunesse"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1467244800,5,3145,4.60427807486631
