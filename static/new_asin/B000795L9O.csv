8046030,4,B000795L9O,"The modern incarnation (1990's) of this venerable TV series never had the buzz that shows like the Twilight Zone had. People remember an occasional episode, like Beau Bridges in ""The Sand Kings"". So this collection features a few episodes that had nudity. Sold as the ""SEX"" episodes, I think it was just a way to try and chum up some extra sales. Well, it worked on me anyway. The stories are largely about androids and humans loving them. The stories are good, with a twist as expected, and the models are beautiful. I think though, a better deal would be to buy the series by season and pick up these episodes that way, instead of this collection of stories whose main common theme is nudity.",1456444800,,694,4.56
