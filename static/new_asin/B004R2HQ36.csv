8438676,3,B004R2HQ36,"Elaan really entertained me. I especially loved Rahul Khanna's acting in this one. I also loved the special friendship that the five heroes developed as they plotted the ultimate demise of Baba, an evil man who needed his just desserts. Arjun was really good as well. I especially enjoyed the location scenes in Europe; the road action scene was spectacular! The women were pretty, especially the Sonia character, who is beyond gorgeous! I loved this movie so much that I bought it. I have recommended it to my friends who have also viewed and enjoyed it. Give it a try for yourself, even if it is just to see Rahul Khanna at work, because this guy can certainly act!",1304035200,,667,4.61344537815126
