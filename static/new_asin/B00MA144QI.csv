6565433,5,B00MA144QI,"If you are a fan of supernatural/paranormal horror films or werewolf films this is certain to float your boat.  It has production values, a good script, very good acting and some relatively unique or unusual aspects of style to it.  Little or no CGI or monster effects but strong on mood (very 'somber' or 'melancholy' as another reviewer said), an understated pathos, a haunting or elegaic quality to it.  I think the best horror films are rather dream like and transport the viewer to a kind of mythic state of mind.  You'll find few if any of the usual jump scares, irony and over the top stuff that you might expect from a Hollywood production.  Falls very much in line with the anti-hero 'monster' motif that so many of us relate to on a deep level.

I hovered between 4 or 5 stars for this.  Having just watched; it gets 5 stars due to momentary enthusiasm, but I'm not sure how it truly rates compared to other films in this general genre that I've seen.  I'll certainly watch it again at some point and do recommend it for those with an interest in this sort of thing.",1440892800,2,1076,4.426395939086294
6565434,5,B00MA144QI,"Let's be honest; any fan of werewolf movies know that they're not going to get the most mind-boggling plot ever. American Werewolf in London/Paris? Great werewolf movies, B movies at best in any other genre. It's a monster movie; a guilty pleasure. That's what this movie is. The plot doesn't contain many points and all of them are obvious. The actors and actresses do a good job playing their part, and their personalities stand out fairly well, and I liked the monster makeup.

**SPOILER ABOUT THE MAKEUP**

Now part of the fun of werewolf movies is seeing what they decided to make them look like. They're different across the board. So if you want the spoiler ahead (and why I like it), than read on. If you want to see for yourself and the movie sounds good, I'd just watch the movie.

I like the makeup because it does ""human werewolf"" very well. I like the more wolf-like werewolves too (like on American Werewolf in Paris), but I was never fond of the ""humans with a wolf head.""  It looks way too much like a Halloween costume, and not like a good movie werewolf. This one is basically just hairy on the sides and forehead, not so much the whole front, with a human face. Even the ""claws"" aren't over done.

**MINOR KINDA STORY SPOILER; SKIP IF YOU ARE GONNA WATCH THE MOVIE**

One thing I like about the movie that sets it a part from a lot of werewolf movies (not all) is that the altered state (only shown much at the end, really) feels more animalistic than most other werewolf films, because it seems neutral. There's no inherent drive to kill or to not kill like in many other werewolf movies. So it's more a reaction to how she is treated. Reminds me more of things in real nature, human or otherwise.",1440892800,8,1717,4.452229299363057
6565435,5,B00MA144QI,"A young woman is trying to lead a normal life but finds it difficult as her body starts to experience odd changes and soon people start showing up dead. This may just be the best werewolf movie Ive seen since Ginger Snaps, and I love me some Ginger Snaps. The movie is just beautiful in an exceedingly melancholy way with the dark skies and crashing ocean waves. The lead is just so lovely and carries a sadness about her that just draws you in to her little world. This is definitely a horror movie but contains high elements of drama and mystery which come from a very well written story. Its really well directed, had a low runtime that just flew by, and just did a lot of interesting things in general. Beautiful, somber, haunting, this is one film that I greatly enjoyed on every level.",1431216000,24,791,4.424657534246576
6565436,4,B00MA144QI,"Marie is sixteen and lives in a coastal town with nowt to do, no friends and a mother with a mysterious debilitating illness. The local doctor seems to take a lot of interest in Maries condition especially when she starts to grow thick body hair and she would like to know why.

Now she gets a job at the local fish factory, where she is not exactly made to feel welcome. She makes a connection with Daniel, a kindly soul who is also a good looking man whom she takes a shine too. The thing is she starts to feel that she has not been told everything about her illness and soon she will find out the hard way.

Now this is a slow burner but one that is fairly intense at the same time. There are some sterling performances especially from Lars Mikkelsen  brother of Mads but everyone is actually good even Gustav Dyekjr Giese who has a small role playing a nasty type here and was in the rather good Northwest. It is short at 81 minutes and that includes the run off credits, but it does not do much wasting of screen time and is better for it. For lovers of horror this may be lacking as it is a coming of age tale and a relationship story as much as the horror part and that makes it a more rounded film  recommended.",1465603200,,1219,4.1525423728813555
6565437,1,B00MA144QI,"This is one of those ""How dare those pesky villagers not want to live with a ravenous murderer in their midst!"" movies.  In all honesty, I thought the town folk were pretty reasonable all things considered.  The director tried (unsuccessfully) to make this a film about bullying, feminism and the fear of adolescent female sexuality, but it just came off as a further reminder of how completely unreasonable the bleeding hearts have become in their quest to be inclusive of everyone.  ""Oh, I'm sorry...was it disrespectful when we asked to check whether your wife/mom mom ate the town doctor?  Well pardon us!""

And I love the line the boyfriend (who apparently doesn't have an issue with hirsutism) says toward the end.  ""We'll sail somewhere far away"".  Really, genius?  Where are you going to sail where werewolves are kosher?  Where's that country?",1460160000,2,852,4.98581560283688

6565439,5,B00MA144QI,"* spoilers *

Marie is 16 years old and lives on an island with her father and invalid mother. She gets a new job at a fishery where they good-naturedly haze her and she feels she belongs. Then she starts to get some weird symptoms: a strange rash and patches of thick hair. Then, when the changes become noticeable, people start to treat her differently, losing their playful behavior and becoming more threatening. It becomes clear that her father kept things from her since her condition is similar to that of her mother. Marie now has two choices: does she submit to becoming a comatose invalid like her mother or just live her own life, but be hunted by the society she grew up in.

When Animals Dream is a Danish werewolf film with feminist themes in the same vein as Ginger Snaps. While Ginger Snaps is fraught with teen angst, this film is more quiet and subdued. The film opens with Marie, pale, thin, and seemingly frail getting a weird rash checked out. The doctor asks her the same questions over and over during his examination as if he doesn't trust her answers.  experienced the same treatment at the vet when trying to get treatment for my sick cat. These male professionals act like women either aren't sure, are lying to them, or have simply untrustworthy judgment. In Marie's case, she isn't being trusted about her own body, which she obviously knows better than anyone else. Things seem normal, so she's dismissed. She starts working at a fish mongers and is good-naturedly hazed by being shoved into a vat of fish detritus. The staff becomes more friendly and she feels like she belongs. At home, most of her time is spent caring for her mother who seems aware, but can't speak or move due to a mysterious illness. Marie is endlessly patient, quiet, and happy to do what she's asked without question.

Marie knows something is being kept from her, so she tries to get information in any way she can: spying on her parents and stealing evidence about attacks from the doctor. She dreams of being bloody and wild, the exact opposite of her fairly colorless, dull life. Then Marie starts a flirtation with Daniel at work (witnessed by Bjarne) and throws a glass at Esben, a jerk who tried to joke with her then insulted her mother when she didn't deign to respond. Both of these men catch up with her at her locker, proceed to force her to her knees while she's in her undershirt, and then slap her in the face with a fish from under his apron (where he isn't wearing pants) as if it's a penis. Throughout, they tell her to look at them and kiss the fish. When Marie doesn't conform to what they think women should be (quiet, apparently asexual, and subservient), Bjarne and Esben sexually attack her. It's quite a disturbing scene and they could have raped her there if they had wanted to. I felt for her in this helpless and traumatic situation where these men typically retaliated against a woman acting like a person instead of an automaton.

Then Marie finds thick hair growing on the rash on her chest. This is a super obvious, not very subtle image for puberty. Women growing out body hair is now quite taboo. The media has shown women plucked and shaved within an inch of their lives for so long that anything else is alien. The amount of disgust I've seen over a woman's armpit, leg, or belly hair is ridiculous because men showcase the same hair but usually more plentiful and it's just a natural part of our bodies. Daniel feels the hair on Marie's back when they start to get intimate and he reacts with curiosity and a little bit of confusion. Marie takes it as rejection and tells him to leave, but he tells her she's beautiful and accepts her for how she is. Throughout the film, Daniel is the only person to truly accept all of her, flaws and differences and all. He is also the only one to treat her mother as a person instead of a piece of furniture or someone to ridicule. Their romance is sweet and the most comfortable part of the film.

When Marie returns home after seeing Daniel, her father and her doctor try to force the treatment for the illness on her when she already refused. Marie's mother, in her only physical act of the film, leaps upon the doctor and kills him. The disease is just the state of being a woman. Accepting the treatment means becoming a shade of oneself to appease the society. Women are expected to be silent and compliant with no will of their own. Marie's mother accepted that fate, allowing everyone else to dictate what she did, and kept all of her thoughts and feelings on the inside. She showed in that one act of defiance that she wants different for her child. Afterwards, the awful townspeople demand that she be stripped to check for signs of transformation and violence. They don't see her as a person, but a potentially dangerous object with no right to privacy, personhood, feelings, opinions, or even life as she is murdered later on in the film.

Marie accepts that she will be rejected and becomes the woman she wants to be with thoughts, opinions, and the right to disagree and be unpleasant. I appreciate that there are men and women on both sides of this issue. It shows that both men and women can either work for or against women. Internalized misogyny can be ingrained by being raised with these ideas, so seeing a woman working so hard against Marie is both accurate and kind of depressing. She decides to shove her state in everyone's faces at the funeral, the wake, and then the next day at work in rebellion. Her coworkers react again, more violently than ever before, chasing her down on motorcycles. They eventually capture and imprison her. This shows how both sides do more extreme things to counter each other, but Marie is still just living her normal life (just not in the way the others want) while the other side is endangering her life. Everyone has turned against her except for her father and Daniel. Her transformation progresses quickly, allowing her to dispatch her enemies easily. It only gets to this point because her life is literally in danger. Beyond defending herself, she has never been aggressive or violent before. The final scene features Daniel hugging her and holding her hand, reassuring her that he is there. It's beautiful and shows that he sees the person beneath what everyone else deemed monstrous.

When Animals Dream is an absolutely beautiful Danish film. Much of the film is very quiet, much like Marie, but meaningful. There's not a lot of unnecessary chatter or filler scenes. Sonia Suhl acts amazingly as Marie. Her transformation both emotionally and physically throughout the film is well done and nuanced. Marie was always quiet, but quiet doesn't mean subservient or weak. Her messages were relayed loud and clear even if her actions were subtle. Sonja Richter does an excellent job as Marie's mother (who doesn't even have a name). Most of the film has her not moving or speaking, but her gazes speak volumes. It's clear that she knows what's going on, but can't communicate with her daughter. I highly recommend this meaningful and gorgeous film.",1455667200,,7088,4.642231075697211

6565442,5,B00MA144QI,"Darn near perfect movie. Cinematography is superb, particularly the night shots which are actual night shots that look like what you would see at night - you can see everything you need to see and yet it is still dark - Few appreciate how difficult this is to achieve and how ubiquitous it is for filmmakers to just accept an overlit frame with a blue filter or some such non-sense - darkness is a character here.  Exceptional performances (especially the actress playing Marie's mother - quietly amazing) with extremely sensitive and knowing direction and the editing is impeccable - flawless even.  Has to be in the top 100 movies ever made and where's the foreign film Oscar's talk - seriously.  The fact that it doesn't register with most folks as being as spectacular as it actually is, is really rather sad.  I will be on the look-out for more of Arnby's work",1453852800,,865,4.671052631578948
6565443,4,B00MA144QI,"The setting of a provincial Danish fishing village is credible for this intelligent, contemporary, foreign, werewolf film. The possessed are discriminating killers, sparing those they deeply care about, which lends a sympathetic quality to their viciousness. I see the teenage werewolf as a metaphor of a troubled adolescent asserting her independence, trying to separate from her family, as she transitions into adulthood, the adult werewolf as a metaphor of an attractive, perhaps overtly sexual woman, striking out at the narrow-minded inhabitants of a town that rejects her. My main criticism of the story is the lack of information on the origins of the lycanthropy. That said, it's a very good horror film.",1453420800,,712,5.366071428571429
6565444,2,B00MA144QI,It was a good idea but it just didn't really live up to its ideas. They never really said if the medication was paralyzing her mother or if she was genuinely sick.

6565445,2,B00MA144QI,"This movie sounded like a titillating and intriguing story similar to Ginger Snaps; I am a sucker for therianthropic stories, especially when the metamorphic power is tied to sexual awakening (after all, the unfettered passions and urges of the inner animal are at the core of most therianthropic myths). This one didn't really do much with the transformation or the animal nature; a girl who's mother suffers from Unspecified-itis gets a job. Then she starts growing hair and losing fingernails. There's a suggestion her fingers are becoming claws. There's some friction with the townsfolk. Her dad and her doctor seem to be keeping a secret about her mom. Then a few things happen. Then I lost interest - unless the final ten minutes of the movie do something amazing, I'd steer clear of this one; the best thing about it is it made me want to watch Let Me/The Right One In again.

Also, what the hell, movie? With a title like ""When Animals Dream"", I was sort of hoping for a surreal art piece in which a girl finds out she is really a pseudomythical predatory forest creature that only /thought/ she was human, and everyone around her has been trying all her short life to preserve this fragile dream of humanity except now she's turning from a girl/cub to a woman/adult female and the dream is unraveling. That could have been a poignant exploration of identity and existentialism and what it means to be human or animal; instead, we got this bland slice-of-life nonsense. Weak-sauce, movie!

Perhaps because it's a foreign film (if you live in the US) it has that great feeling of Otherness you get from watching ""Let The Right One In"" that makes the scenario more scary, though less so than the vampire film - perhaps because When Animals Dream features more modernity.

I would note that it wasn't scary in the way I typically crave when I'm watching horror films, but it was VERY worth watching.",1442016000,,563,4.466019417475728
6565458,5,B00MA144QI,"I really enjoyed watching WHEN ANIMALS DREAM. I have watched other Danish films and I've found that I personally have loved almost everyone I have seen. This one is no different. It's such a departure from the typical ""werewolf"" movie, that I found it extremely refreshing and much more a
""human"" story and not just a ""creature feature'. It centers around a small family living in a small community where everyone pretty much knows everyone else. The family consists of a mom, dad and a teenage daughter and you see very early on in the film that the mother is suffering from some kind of disease that is debilitating. She has a doctor who drops by from time to time to give her injections for her disease. The daughter starts working at the local fishery to bring in some money and as time goes by, it is clear that the daughter seems to have inherited the same illness that her mother has. All of this is handled beautifully in this film and the viewer has plenty of time to ""get to know"" this family and to care very much about their plight. For me, this is one of the best werewolf movies I've seen. I loved GINGER SNAPS, but it had alot more comedy and this movie is all drama and psychological thriller along with some excellent effects and violence when the ""wolf"" is aroused or angry. The actors are wonderful, as is the cinematography which highlights the dismal quality of the every day lives of the people who live in the town. One grows to care very much for ""Anna's"" situation and roots for her to escape, in some way, from the inevitability of her ""illness"".

6565460,3,B00MA144QI,"Personally I was slightly apprehensive after reading some of the reviews, but I was actually impressed after watching it, this was actually very nicely done, and it had my attention the entire time, and my wife's too. There was really no new werewolf stuff, nothing groundbreaking, that is, but if you like these types of movies, then this is a really good one, not hokey, not really low-budget looking, or anything that is negative. The make-up effects were really different, and I was impressed that they came up with that, it wasn't much, but it didn't take much to get the point across, and it made sense too. :) The acting was good, and the scenery/mood/tone was too.
Anyway, I'd actually give this 3-1/2 stars if I could, I would almost give it 4 stars, and some might, and it may be, but that might be a little much.
I liked it, and it was (almost) on par with, ""Let the Right One In"", not, ""Let me In"", the remake, I REALLY liked that, and this is about right up there with that, almost...
You'll more than likely will really like this movie, I've seen so much crap lately, it's really refreshing to see something that not only holds your attention.
