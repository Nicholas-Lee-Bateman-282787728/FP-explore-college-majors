As usual, this DVD projects attitude and personality that will motivate you to want to get that gluteus to the maximus. You will find that the workouts are designed to be challenging but not overly stressful. Jillian also takes the time to explain some of the movements.

You will need some stuff to use with this DVD:

- Dumbbells
- Exercise tubing
- Small step
- Chair or bench

The features of Six circuits are as follows:

- cardio intervals
- 2 resistance exercises
- 3X repeats
- on the front end: back, hamstrings and glutes
- in the middle: biceps
- on the back end: abs

Points to note:

- variations are provided to allow you to fit the routines to your ability;
- the high impact cardio section has a low impact variation;
- there is no warm up or cool down, so you should incorporate these into the workout for yourself.",1288828800,58,1135,5.378531073446328
2665760,4,B000J10KNC,"I really like this video but just so everyone knows it is a rerelease of a dvd that was out a few years ago.  It's a good workout but a little long for what I consider ""beginner"".  Also, there is no music and Jillian doesn't do the workout, she coaches a past biggest loser contestant through the workout.",1287878400,32,305,4.241379310344827

2665762,4,B000J10KNC,"Jullian does a great job showing you how to do the exercises, but I quickly out grew it.  It's great for a beginner and who likes to take things slowly.",1238630400,3,152,4.066666666666666
2665763,5,B000J10KNC,"Jillian Michaels puts three contestants who lost weight on The Biggest Loser Show through the paces again. Here they demonstrate exercises in five circuit-style segments. The circuit-training workout is themed so you are working the muscles of the back, but you also do some abdominal exercises and you keep the heart rate up by doing cardiovascular exercises.

This is a challenging workout that might be enjoyed the most by intermediates but will give beginners some real challenges for abs, arms and muscles on the back of the body. Shane joins her on the first segment and she teaches how to adapt the exercises for low impact. 3-5lb weights are used and weights are also used during the lunges. For the second section, Kim joins Jillian and uses a step. The back exercises look pretty tricky, so you may want to do a pelvic lift from yoga or pilates instead of the more complex bridge when you first start this exercise routine.

In the third section, there is more of an emphasis on traditional weight lifting with dead lifts and then some fun speed skating moves. Jillian's edgy teaching style comes through as she playfully teases the contestants and gets them working out at a higher level with encouragement and motivational tips.

The fourth segment is especially interesting as you can learn to row at home by using an exercise band. The donkey kicks and bicep curls in the fifth segment alternate with more stepping. Variations are shown for the donkey kicks, using the exercise band. Then back to skating and more working on the abs and back for the sixth section.

Overall this is an excellent workout

with many challenges for beginners.

2665765,5,B000J10KNC,"I really enjoy this dvd I am about 285 lbs have a ruptured disc and severe arthritis in my knees. I can do this, a few moves i cant do but its ok i just repeat the moves that I can. Im no exerciser and have a lot of flab to lose. I also purchased the frontside dvd I will update this in a few months. No dvd will work for you if you are not consistant! Stop making excuses, put those bon bon downs, get off your a$# and do something! Stop winning and complaining make your mind up and just do it!!! Buy the dvd start somewhere for crying out loud!",1423699200,2,547,3.849557522123894

2665767,1,B000J10KNC,"Jillian Doesn't Do Any of the Exercises - So I found that distracting. She could say that she wanted to do a lot of talking, but it didn't keep my interest watching her coach others in various fitness conditions.  Having said that the price is right and there are a lot of exercises if this doesn't bother you.  It bothered me enough that I will move on to other Dvd's......",1409702400,,374,4.328571428571428
2665768,4,B000J10KNC,"Overall, I think this is a great  beginner video. I used it to work out with my husband (who is just starting a routine) and not make him feel intimidated by my other Jillian videos (Ripped in 30, etc.). He enjoyed it but it was cumbersome with the frequent equipment changes. The first few circuits are slow and the equipment requirements are a bit much. Seriously, who has something stable to tie a resistance band to that can hold your weight? We actually sat face to face and used each other's bodies for that part.
The last 3 circuits are better in that the pace picks up a bit.
Great starter video, but we were left wondering... WHY DOES SHE KISS THE AUSTRALIAN ON THE LIPS AT THE END OF THE VIDEO? My husband was so confused, I don't think he'll work out with me anymore.",1406073600,2,778,4.328767123287672

2665770,1,B000J10KNC,"This video is ill contrived, with beginners carrying out the exercises and no counts. Looks like something I could have filmed in my garage. I don't know what JM was thinking! You are better off with her other videos. This was not worth it!",1396828800,,240,4.4772727272727275
2665771,5,B000J10KNC,"I love the way Jillian teaches, you not only learn how to do the exercise, but why you do them a certain way and why it is so important to breath correctly through the exercise. Great way to begin working out again.",1393977600,,215,4.142857142857143
2665772,5,B000J10KNC,great work out video that can be done when you have time to do it. Price was perfect as well. Happy with purchase.,1386460800,,114,4.0
2665773,3,B000J10KNC,"I love Jillian and all her workouts... when I first purchased this workout it worked ok for me to start my progress in my new Fit life, but I wish it would have been a little faster with the moves.  The DVD got very boring very quickly.",1386115200,,236,4.0212765957446805
2665774,5,B000J10KNC,"I LOVE this workout. I have been doing it it for two weeks and can see and feel a difference. People keep commenting that I look great. I thought I would die the first time and I run/work out 5 days a week. It's very hard, but worth it.",1385856000,,236,3.836734693877551
2665775,3,B000J10KNC,"I recently picked up this DVD used, mainly because I was curious about the instructor, Jillian Michaels.  I have never watched Jillian's TV show, THE BIGGEST LOSER, but I was interested in seeing what one of her workouts might be like.

In her Introduction to this DVD, Jillian explains that the ""Backside"" is designed to target the muscles on the back of the body, including the back, the glutes or ""tush,"" and the backs of the legs (hamstrings).  She admits that the one exception to this is the biceps but maintains that this muscle group is important when working the back because it is a related pulling muscle.

Jillian also explains the circuit style of the routine, noting that this is one of the best methods for fat loss.  There are six total circuits to this workout (with NO warm-up or cool-down).  Each circuit consists of a cardio move and then 2-3 strength exercises; this sequence is repeated for a total of three sets per circuit.  In each segment, Jillian is joined by a former BIGGEST LOSER contestant--the individual performs the actual moves, while Jillian instructs and provides form pointers.  Most exercises are performed for ten repetitions.

The exercise takes place in a white, featureless room with no windows, and there is no music.  Quite a bit of equipment is used for this workout, including dumbbells, a step, a chair, and tubing (Jillian does mention substitutions, but not until the exercise is already underway).  I have broken down each circuit in greater detail below (times in parentheses are approximate).

CIRCUIT 1 (7 minutes)
Jillian is joined here by Shane, from BIGGEST LOSER AUSTRALIA.
*Cardio=butt kicks
*Back=wide grip dumbbells
*Hamstrings=static lunges

CIRCUIT 2 (8.5 minutes)
Here the exerciser is Kim, from BIGGEST LOSER FAMILY.
*Cardio=step ups
*Back=single arm medium rows
*Hamstrings=elevated held bridge (head/shoulders resting on chair)

CIRCUIT 3 (7.5 minutes)
Pete from BIGGEST LOSER 2 is featured in this segment.
*Cardio=speed skaters
*Hamstrings=stiff leg deadlift
*Back=seated rear delt raise

CIRCUIT 4 (7 minutes)
Shane returns.
*Cardio=dumbbell punches
*Hamstrings=morning glories
*Back=seated rows with anchored tubing (varying Set #3)

CIRCUIT 5 (14 minutes)
Kim returns.
*Cardio=step ups (adding intensity with weights)
*Biceps=bicep curls with tubing
*Hamstrings=donkey kicks
*Core=reclined leg hovers

CIRCUIT 6 (8 minutes)
Pete returns.
*Cardio=speed skaters (advanced by keeping foot off floor)
*Biceps=concentration curls
*Back=supermans
*Core=bicycles (isometric contraction for Set #3)

In the end, I found this workout to be just okay.  Although Jillian was generally supportive encouraging, and gave plenty of form pointers, I don't think that this routine would be appropriate for those brand new to working out.  First, the former BIGGEST LOSER contestants featured were obviously NOT beginners; all of them had lost significant amounts of weight themselves and had clearly been exercising for some time.  Second, these circuits were actually fairly challenging, as they moved quickly and became progressively more difficult.  Although a beginner could use very light or even no weights, I still think this workout would be intimidating for those who haven't exercised previously.

Those criticisms aside, I simply found this workout to be somewhat boring and uninteresting (although the time--nearly an hour--did pass quickly given the circuit-style format).  I didn't like the frequent equipment changes, and I didn't like the way that Jillian constantly asked and answered questions of the invisible audience (e.g., ""why are we doing this?  well, I'll tell you..."").  But for experienced beginning exercisers looking for a no-nonsense circuit-style workout, this DVD might fit the bill.",1379376000,,3770,5.501736111111111
2665776,5,B000J10KNC,"Not very difficult, even for beginners, but still works the muscle groups very well. Needs a resistance band and/or weights.",1370649600,,124,5.25
2665777,4,B000J10KNC,"It's one of her ""older"" DVD's, but definitely worth it!
I like that she explains why you're doing the exercises that you are; what body parts are affected, etc.",1367884800,,160,4.551724137931035
2665778,5,B000J10KNC,Arrived on time. The workout is just the right pace and I feel really good after each workout. I recommed this to my friends.,1367712000,,125,4.25
2665779,4,B000J10KNC,"I am guessing that this was among her first videos, because there is a calmer Jillian.  It is a good instructional video.",1367020800,,121,4.5
2665780,1,B000J10KNC,"I borrowed this from my library,thinking anything with Jillian Michaels would be challenging. I've never watched The Biggest Loser. I know all these circuit moves from working out with Denise Austin and Cindy Whitmarsh. It doesn't look like a real workout to me. My idea of cardio is not watching Jillian circle around the exerciser like she is some kind of vulture. The circuits didn't flow together. I am not interested in this person, where they came from and how much they lost. Does Jillian ever exercise so you can follow along with her? She may be in shape but I have more respect if the trainer I'm watching is suffering along with you. I'm waiting for 30 Day Shred to come in but I'm skeptical about its safety due to the reviews.",1365379200,,739,4.56390977443609
2665781,5,B000J10KNC,I love this video in conjunction with the 'Frontside' video.  It gives me a pretty good workout and I feel like I have a lot more muscle tone/definition in the upper body since using both of them.  One of the things I like is that Jillian gives different variations to make it more difficult as you are progressing.  Would definitely recommend to a beginner or intermediate exerciser!,1355788800,,384,4.701492537313433
2665782,5,B000J10KNC,Absolutely Love it! I use this twice a week! I have seen a major difference! You get such a great work out!,1350604800,,107,3.909090909090909
2665783,3,B000J10KNC,"I bought this as an instant download. The image quality is awful and I have a really nice LCD HDTV, so I know it is not my tv, but awful image quality aside, it is a great workout. I have lost ~30 lbs so far and wanted something more to do at home. My responsibilities between home and work make it hard to get to the gym, so working out at home is ideal.",1341964800,,355,3.810810810810811
2665788,4,B000J10KNC,"I don't exercise regularly, so I consider myself a beginner. I've tried working out before with DVDs, and after a few days, I lose motivation and interest. But, I've been wanting to get in shape, and since I've heard good things about Jillian Michaels from various reviews, I decided to give her DVDs a chance. This DVD consists of 6 circuits which are done by three contestants from The Biggest Loser show with Jillian guiding. I've never seen the show so I'm not familiar with which contestants they are. I only made it through the first circuit on the first day and had to stop. The exercises are fun but a little rough, at least for a beginner like myself. However, even though I am sore right now, I plan on exercising with the DVD when I'm not as sore. I'm motivated to keep up with it, and Jillian is encouraging by telling you to do what your fitness level will allow you to do at the current time, but there are other tips that she offers to boost it up a bit when you are ready. All in all, I'm happy with my purchase. The only reason I did not give this 5/5 stars is: - Sometimes when the person is doing the exercises, the camera has a bad angle and you can't really see what they are doing. But after a few minutes, the camera pans out and you can see what the person is doing. - Also, when I was trying to get through the first circuit and pushing myself, not until the very end did Jillian explain that if you were not able to do the exercises as intense as the example, to do it as best as you can for now. I wish she would have mentioned that at the beginning...Oh well. Maybe that is my fault, being a beginner, and not figuring that out for myself.",1336953600,4,1667,4.180124223602484
2665789,5,B000J10KNC,"I love working out to these videos! They are challenging, but not killer. I have been doing them for a few weeks now and I already feel stronger and my clothes fit better.

2665790,4,B000J10KNC,"I will be honest I've used this DVD I'd say two or three times since I got it however, each time I've used it I.ve felt the burn. It's easy to follow each circuit. I use it in conjunction with my ab workout DVD and I hurt for the entire day",1326499200,,240,3.7254901960784315

-good excercises
-good tips
-less repetitions
-variety!!!!
-it's almost an hour, I think, but goes by quick

Don't like:

-no backgroudn music at all (which is sad cause it would make it so much more enjoyable!!!)

2665793,2,B000J10KNC,"I adore Jillian Michaels and most of her DVDs helped me lose my post prego weight. However, this video is just poor quality.  The ""students"" make up their own counts and at times zip through the reps.  There is just a bit too much chatting for my taste.  The hugging and congratulating at the end of each circuit is very annoying! And no cool down???? Crazy! Not my favorite! I love the other DVDs better!",1309564800,9,405,4.373333333333333
