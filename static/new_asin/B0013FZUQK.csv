3107329,5,B0013FZUQK,"I saw The Forbidden Kingdom with my friends opening day. I see that the movie topped the box office - If you see this movie, you will understand why - It is amazing on so many levels...
A collaboration between two superstars in their field - Jackie Chan and Jet Li - a charming story based on an ancient Chinese legend of The Monkey King, (played in flashback by Jet Li) who loses his golden staff - and is encased in stone until the staff is returned. It is a story based on one of the great epic stories of China, and a story added in of a Western young man obsessed with Kung Fu and buys old tapes from an old Chinese pawnshop, who ends up with the staff.
Actions follow and the young man, Jason, played by Michael Angarano, is hurtled back in time to the time of legends where the Monkey King is imprisoned in stone and the Jade Emperor and other meanies run havoc among the people.
Jason, with the legendary Monkey King's staff, wanders around and finally meets Lu Yan, a drunken immortal (Jackie Chan) and then meets up with The Silent Monk (Jet Li), and a beautiful maiden, Golden Sparrow,(Yifel Liu) who is a warrior/musician.
The two men set out to train Jason for his quest to go to fulfill his destiny of returning the golden shaft to the Monkey King.
At first they butt heads each trying to train Jason in their disciplines. Finally, they make a pact to work together and train the boy with both their knowledge -
They begin their journey toward the Monkey King.
The fight scenes are classically done - the staging of them is in rapid fire and so beautifully 'choreographed' you will not want to blink your eyes. Defying gravity, delighting in the pleasure of watching the best of the craft before you on screen. It just doesn't get much better.
Jackie Chan and Jet Li are magic together - Both charismatic, both masters of the story of battle.
I saw this movie with new eyes as I am beginning my journey into studying screenwriting, and cinematography. I marveled at the filming process, and the beauty of the land. And the ease that we are put there in the action.
I am amazed that East and West blended in this charming story of the Monkey King, and brought us back to Boston, where end ending is as magical as the beginning.
Great script, great cast. Beautifully filmed.
It was a joy to watch and I plan to see it many times more as well as get the DVD.
It's a WOW!",1208649600,,2381,4.352808988764045
3107330,5,B0013FZUQK,"My first response to the film was ""WOW!""  ""Forbidden Kingdom"" opened with a fabulously staged fight scene atop a mountain. The Monkey King (Jet Li) was taking on a handful of enemies and wiping them out.

Next we move to Boston where Jason (Michael Angarano), a Chinaphile and kung fu fanatic discovers an ancient staff in a pawnshop where he buys kung fu movies from Hop (Chan). Hop tells him that the staff was left there for a messenger to claim the staff and return it to its rightful owner.  Jason tells Hop he's been dreaming about this staff.  Hop tells him he's been watching too many kung fu movies.

Next, some toughs force Jason to help them rob Hop's store.  In the attack, Hop's shot and Jason awakens from injuries to find himself in ancient China with the staff to recover to its rightful owner, the Monkey King, who's been imprisoned in stone by an evil warlord for 500 years.

Along the way, he meets Lu Yan (Chan) who is a drunken immortal, Golden Sparrow (Yifel Liu), an orphaned musician-warrior who's sworn vengeance on the warlord for killing both of her parents in a raid, and a silent monk (Jet Li again).

As they journey, Jason learns kung fu from both Lu Yan and the monk as well as discovering values critical to overcoming the warlord.

Scenery, fight scenes, music are gorgeous.  There are some hilarious moments in this film particularly when Lu Yan makes rain.

""Forbidden Kingdom"" is a film I'll certainly see again before it leaves the theatre as well as probably buying the DVD as soon as it comes out.  I love both Li and Chan and this, in my opinion, was one of the best of both of their impressive collection of films--and visually, just a stellar pleasure to watch. The film began with a ""WOW"" and ended with one as well.  Kudos to cast and creators.

3107331,3,B0013FZUQK,"I really only went to see this movie to watch the two best movie martial artists since Bruce Lee kick some butt. The only real saving grace were the fight scenes, which were way over the top, but entertaining. The fight between Li and Chan was good (I would have prefered more realism), but this fight should have been epic. My main problem was the weak dialogue and the fantasy story that was more laughable than any funny line in this film. It seemed to be aimed at the younger crowd, so chances are your kids will be doing karate in the car on the way home from the movie. The Forbidden Kingdom was fun at times, but not what I had hoped for.",1208563200,6,645,4.209677419354839

3107333,5,B0013FZUQK,"Forbidden Kingdom

My husband and I make a habit of seeing every Jackie Chan film so we saw The Forbidden Kingdom on opening night.

I'm sad that Jackie Chan has to make movies with kids and sidekicks [I'm not calling Jet Li a sidekick...] these days. I also find it incredibly weird when they speak English in ancient China. Also, we missed the outtakes that Jackie often has at the end of his movies. Ok, that's enough criticism. The plot is your standard Kung Fu no brainer, but wow those were some great fight scenes, awesome costumes, cool effects, and gorgeous sets.  It is fun to see Jet Li and Jackie Chan in the same movie. It was worth the price of admission just for that.",1208476800,2,683,4.404761904761905
3107334,5,B0013FZUQK,"This afternoon, I went to the movies at Jurong Point with my gym buddy.

We chose the movie, 'The Forbidden Kingdom', starring two of our favourite kungfu movie super-stars, Jackie Chan & Jet Li.

Since it was a 3.50pm show, & both of us were senior citizens, we were entitled to half-priced movie tickets, at S$4/- each. For once, we thoroughly enjoyed the privilege of being senior citizens.

The movie was sort of a fantasy story, even though it drew a myriad of characters out of Chinese folklore.

The opening scene started of with a nerdy American teenager, Jason (played by Michael Angarano), in Boston with an unquenchable thirst for kungfu classics.

As he visited his regular joint, a Chinese artefact shop, he was intrigued by a long golden shaft in the store. The shop owner, a blind old man (played by Jackie Chan), told him that the shaft was still waiting for the rightful owner to come & pick up, ever since he had inherited the shop from his grandfather.

The teenager then left the shop, but was confronted on the way & bashed up by a bunch of young neighbourhood hoodlums. They knew he had left the shop earlier & decided to rob the old man, using the teenager as bait for the old man to open the shop.

The old man was accidentally shot, & the scared teenager ran off with the shaft, with the hoodlums in hot pursuit.

In the next instance, the teenager was magically teleported into ancient China at about the time of the Jade Emperor. He then bumped into a shabby looking drunken beggar, Lu Yan (played by Jackie Chan), who told him a ridiculous story about the origin of the golden shaft.

In a nutshell, the golden shaft actually belonged to the Monkey God (played by Jet Li), from the 'Journey to the West', one of the four great epic novels of Chinese literature.

The Monkey God was unwittingly tricked into loosing the golden shaft while fighting the evil Jade Warlord.

The shaft then mysteriously disappeared for some 500 years, while the Monkey God was turned immediately into stone by the evil Jade Warlord.

Both of them then popped into a tea-house & were confronted by some soldiers from the evil Jade Warlord. A fight ensued, reminiscent of the 'Dragon (Gate) Inn' incident from several Chinese kungfu classics.

During the escape, they were helped by a young female warrior, known as Golden Sparrow. She was apparently looking for an opportunity to avenge the death of her parents at the hands of the evil Jade Warlord.

Then, this time three of them somehow got entangled with a monk, dressed in white robes, known as the Silent Monk (also played by Jet Li), who apparently had a life-long mission to locate the golden shaft.

What followed was a seemingly extended & masterfully choreographed fighting sequence (by the legendary Yuen Woo Ping as action director), between the characters of Jackie Chan & Jet Li.

Frankly, my gym buddy & I actually got our money's worth here.

We also got to see the two heroes reluctantly teaching the American teenager some Chinese kungfu routines. That was the most comical part of the movie, reminiscent of master-disciple scenes from 'The Karate Kid'.

This time, four of them decided to work together to search for the Temple of the Five Elements, in an attempt to locate the Monkey God & to return the golden shaft to him as well.

Meanwhile, the evil Jade Warlord got wind of their exploits.

He immediately sent a bounty hunter, a white-haired demoness - she looked & sounded more like a Chinese version of Jessica Alba - with a deadly whip, to retrieve the golden shaft.

The final segment of the movie was a really exciting one, when all hell broke loose as the three heroes/one heroine finally caught up in a ferocious battle with the evil Jade Warlord, together with the white hair demoness. (Many thanks again to Yuen Woo Ping!)

The Monkey God was finally resurrected with the return of the shaft, & he, too, took the final opportunity to beat up the evil Jade Warlord.

I must say, when come to combat sequences, unarmed or with weapons in hand, Jet Li was really good. Jackie Chan was not bad, too, although I noticed that he had lost some steam.

Again, my gym buddy & I got all our money's worth.

The ending of the movie was somewhat funny too. The teenager decided to return home - magically, of course. He bumped into the same bunch of hoodlums again. This time, to their chagrin, he really bashed them out properly.

On the whole, besides the intricate fighting sequences, I truly enjoyed watching the lavish settings, which included beautiful scenes of white cherry blossom trees, barren deserts, luscious bamboo forests, & stone cold temples. The cinematography was great, too.

My end analysis is this: if you want to watch Jackie Chan & Jet Li fighting each other, for once in a joint movie collaboration, go for it. You won't regret it.",1208476800,3,4836,4.665488810365136
3107335,2,B0013FZUQK,"How long have we waited to see Jackie Chan and Jet Li finally get pitted against one another on the big screen? How could their long-awaited collaboration be anything but smashingly sensational? The only way to embarrassingly shatter our images of Jackie Chan and Jet Li finally dueling (with a wide array of masterfully choreographed fight sequences) would be to put them in a fantastical Tolkienesque world, brimming with immortals, prophecies, CG-laden magic and time travel. So that's what The Forbidden Kingdom does.

Kung fu consumed American teen Jason Tripitikas (Michael Angarano) must travel back in time to reunite a golden staff with its rightful owner - the Monkey King. In his quest to bring order back to the ancient Chinese world he has teleported to, he is aided by Lu Yan (Jackie Chan), an immortal who uses wine and drunken fighting to gain the upper hand; Sparrow (Yifei Liu), a young female warrior whose parents were killed by the injurious ruler known as the Jade Warlord; and Silent Munk (Jet Li), a guardian who is also on a mission to retrieve the staff.

The Monkey King has been imprisoned in stone for 500 years, and his only hope of restoring peace to ancient China is to regain his legendary weapon. Jason undergoes numerous adventures during his journey to the Temple of the 5 Elements, where the immortal Jade Warlord resides with his massive army, including fighting off hundreds of soldiers, and a white-haired demoness with a deadly whip.

All of the colorful and chaotic characters in the film are based on Chinese mythology, adventure pulps, and classic kung fu movies, but the average viewer isn't going to notice. You would have to be as obsessed as the ambivalent main character to recognize the borrowed concepts from ancient Chinese legend and lore. What the average viewer will undoubtedly notice is the extreme goofiness of the story, all of the plot holes that typically accompany such fantasy fare, and the many quick zooms on ominous faces and statuesque martial arts stances. And perhaps question why Jason already knows how to ride a horse, or why a Jet Li/Jackie Chan movie actually stars a scrawny American boy.

Drenched in eye-rolling fantasy jargon (such as chi magic) and grossly stereotypical characters, the plot is somewhat reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz or Black Knight (the Martin Lawrence film) insomuch as the lead character journeys to a fantasy world designed to match an overactive imagination. Fueled by fanciful yearnings for adventure and excitement, Jason explores lavish settings, including a merciless desert, luscious rainforests, and humongous stone temples, where Woo-Ping Yuen's stunning fight choreography can look very impressive. In an unbelievable world, the fighting gets equally farfetched, and so wire-fu sequences tend to overtake realistic brawling, constantly breaking up the marvel of watching two legendary martial arts masters finally square off.

The costumes are divine, the snowy-haired Asian-Jessica-Alba demoness is an interesting nemesis, and comedic training montages are abundant, but The Forbidden Kingdom forgets to show us entertainment. Lu Yan remarks that to be remembered is true immortality - which makes it a crying shame that this pitiable film will probably be the only thing to remind us of Jackie Chan and Jet Li's only movie collaboration.

Beautiful scenery, engrossing action, mysterious persons, subtle humor, wisdom, and growth of the various characters in the course of the film all contribute to the experience. The plot focuses on an American teenager, who ""knows"" all about Gung fu and its associated mythologies until he is magically transported into that very world, which is filled with glory to be sure, but also contains its share of tragedy--a study in yin and yang.
What a treat to see Jackie Chan and Jet Li, both of them in double roles, work together onscreen, once more demonstrating their skill in their respective versions of martial arts! Jackie Chan continues with the deceptively relaxed style that his fans will always associate with ""The Legend of Drunken Master."" Similarly, once again we  see the incredible precision that is Jet Li's trademark. Relative newcomer at the time of filming, Liu Yifei, as the Golden Sparrow, fulfills all of our expectation in a demanding role covering a range of subtle emotions as well as a smooth agility in martial arts.
Early Chinese martial arts films followed the style of wu xia, in which the leading characters not only were experts at fighting, but also had magical skills. A mystical form of Daoist magic allowed them to fly short distances and perform other skills that go beyond any natural abilities. In the latter half of the twentieth century, films focused more on kung fu fighting skills, as demonstrated by Bruce Lee, Jet Li, Jackie Chan, and others. The 2000 film ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" signaled the return of wu xia, and ""Forbidden Kingdom"" has shown that the trend has been continuing.
The film is filled with characters out of Chinese mythology, e.g., the Jade Emperor and the Monkey King. Jackie Chan's Chinese character is one of the famous ""Eight Immortals"" of Chinese mythology, but his name, Lu Yan, though the name of a historical person, is not usually found among the group. His depiction seems to fit closest to Li Tie Guai, the old beggar with the crutch and the bottle of magic medicine, but he could also be one of the versions of Lan Cai He, the drunken derelict.",1473120000,14,2235,4.881578947368421

It has comedy, romance, mythology, suspense, an inspirational message and lots of martial arts action. It stars Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It centers on the myth of the Monkey King in ancient China.

Jason is a fan of Kung Fu movies and is harassed by some local bullies.  He finds himself somehow in ancient China and winds up with Jackie Chan who plays a drunken style Kung Fu master and their search for the Monkey King, played by Jet Li.

I never like to give away too much when reviewing a movie or a novel because it spoils it for anyone else who might want to see the film or read the book. I will emphasize that this is a pretty good movie which has everything we movie lovers look for entertainment.

If you are a fan of Jackie Chan and Jet Li you should check out this action packed DVD.

elements such as the Kung Fu masters, magic, super powers, the young ignorant

will be right.
Nothing special about the story. But what makes the movie really good is Jackie Chan
and Jet Li. Not that they learned how to speak clear English or that they are acting
like Shakespearean actors. Now, they are exactly like we have grown to love them.
Difficult to understand at times, funny, with great smiles, and GREAT martial arts
expertise. Thus, this movie is full of great fight choreography. This is a happy violent movie,
that is with no blood scenes and extreme killings. It is entertainment, and
you have 2 of the greatest martial arts movie performers.

This also has the kid from Sky-High, 24 (Day 6), and the Lords of Dogtown, just to name a few, and while the whole idea behind it, where a kid finds a long lost magical staff and gets transported, somehow, back to middle ages China, and has to undergo a journey to return the staff back to it's rightful owner, learning martial arts in the process, while laughable at times, is still a better plot than some of the stuff being put out by Hollywood these days (Hello? Noah anyone?)...

Watching Jet Li and Jackie Chan during their fight sequences was enjoyable to watch, along with how they played off of each other in their normal scenes was a real treat to anyone who likes either person. Their styles, while completely different, made it look like they'd been working together to perfect their scenes for years.

For a style of movie which is normally prone to many jokes (mouth moving, no dialogue or the reverse) this movie was one that I will probably watch many times... The ending, while predictable, was still quite enjoyable to watch... I don't want to give anything away to those who haven't seen it, but if you're like me and can watch movies like Pacific Rim, Man of Steel, Battleship and more, over and over again, you'll probably like this one too...",1422835200,,1333,4.522821576763485

3107653,5,B0013FZUQK,"I must start out by saying that I am not a fan of martial arts movies. I hate them, actually. But I am very much into Chinese culture, food, scenery, etc. So I cannot speak to how good or bad of a martial arts film this is. Don't care. It was just great fun with a very Wizard of Ozian feel with a lost traveler in a foreign land, a band of misfits and an adventure to confront evil. The scenic shots of China are breathtaking and exotic, and the acting was solid. I always enjoy Michael Angarano in movies, whether comedy or drama, and he did an outstanding job here. If I have any complaints its that the front end build up could have been a little longer so that we were more familiar with Michael Angarano's character, Jason. We're sort of dropped into the fantastic quest within moments of the opening of the film. Would have been nice if this pivotal character could have been fleshed out more from the start. Still, 5 stars in my book for the fun and the beautiful Chinese landscape.",1411862400,,990,4.2994652406417115

3107720,5,B0013FZUQK,"Right now there are very few movies available about the Monkey King - Sun Wukong. This movie is a reflection of that 600 year old Chinese folk tale. But this isn't done like the new (2014) movie with Donnie Yen and Chow Yun Fat, where we get the whole book in one film. The plot is not the story of the Monkey King exactly and he doesn't even show up until the last 1/4 of the movie. But when he does appear, its actually very cool.

This movie begins in modern times and has a lot of the typical themes of bullies, old Chinese masters, mythology and magic. The plot has some great twists and goes deeper and deeper in Chinese mythology as the film progresses.  Regardless of the worn-out themes this is one incredible Gongvu movie and Jackie Chan and Jet Li and the supporting actors are amazing. The film is high quality with good, legible sub-titles and there is enough sword play, fighting, magic, demons and Chinese folk-tale here for a wide variety of folks.",1398643200,,964,4.440677966101695

Normally I'd review such a disaster as average (3-stars) but with the expectation from those two, and the resulting disappointment, I'm going to go with 1 star.  Blast me in the comment if you disagree.

Plot is mediocre.  I was *really* disappointed to have the Chinese dialogue subtitled as ""Chinese"" - I fully understand and agree with the mediocre Chinese reviews.

It would have been such a better movie (globally) to have the kid been Chinese.

His pathetic ""Michael J Fox"" impression grated on me the entire time, and I had no sympathy for the character at all.

3107730,5,B0013FZUQK,"I think Wu Cheng'en, the author of one of the four great classic works of China that is Hsi You Ji, Journey to the West in English, would be proud of the recent adaptations to his original story.  After all, he created it with all the concepts and understandings of his time 500 years ago, complete with all the fun 'National Enquirer' stuff that was going around in his day too.  I see nothing wrong with adapting such a great work to modern sensitivities, as long as it stays faithful to the original in spirit.

The obvious problems the producers had were obviously 1) how to get this story, already well known throughout Europe / Eurasia, through to an American audience very squeamish about Buddhism and China centered thought and 2) how to get Jackie and Jet into one movie, a feat never before accomplished. I think the fact that Jackie and Jet, two fantastic warriors who have picked up nicely where Bruce Lee left off, have agreed to do this film says a lot about their belief that it can indeed help break the American ice when it comes to the greatness of China.

The English and Australians in particular know of the original classic through the groundbreaking major television production done in Japan called Monkey Magic (Sai Yu Ki), a production which never made it to US TV screens. Many people in these countries grew up with this series as children and remain so fond of it today that they find it hard to take a look at more modern adaptations like The Forbidden Kingdom. The Japanese adaptation was and still is excellent, retaining all of the spirit and most of the scenarios from the original 500 year old book, with a good dose of erotic suggestions and hilarity added.  This and the all Japanese casting are probably some reasons it never made it to the US.

The Harry Potter films seem to be the first American produced, non American subject matter to feature all key roles played by native people and make such a huge US and worldwide profit.  Believe it, producers tried to get an American boy to play Harry but living author J.K.Rowling insisted to the point of withdrawing permission. The result? Not what most US businesses expected at all, the largest HP fan base in the world existing in the US.  This gives me hope that one day the great works of China, Japan and Korea will not need a prerequisite white American guy in the lead.

As for those of us who know and love the original Chinese classic Hsi You Ji,  we can revel in the performances of our main man Jackie, the Kowloon guy who has done so much for us worldwide, and Jet, another Kowloon guy who is just as determined.  We can enjoy the references to the great Hong Kong classic film Come Drink With Me. We can admire Michael Angarano, who really did a great job holding his own with all the cultural and actor heavyweights in this film.  We may not be happy with the film idea that all of Sun Wu Kong's power comes from his staff, but we can forgive that in exchange for having one of the great symbols of Sun Wu Kong impressed upon newbie viewers.

Finally, for those interested in getting to know the awesomeness of the original, Chicago University Professor Anthony C. Yu has done the first complete translation of Hsi You Ji in English, complete with notes to aid in understanding the various Chinese Taoist and Buddhist concepts of the day.  It's available here on Amazon, in four volumes so fair warning, it is not an easy/fast read nor is it a 'children's' read. It should be taken nice and slow, with plenty of time for introspection / reflection. Yes, it is that deep. It is great for a reason, and I highly recommend it.

I also recommend this movie, for it's great historical contribution to one of the world's greatest works of art as well as for it's wonderful entertainment value, including fantastic special effects and costumes.",1388448000,2,3838,4.558139534883721

3107797,4,B0013FZUQK,"""The Forbidden Kingdom"" is great! This is how the story goes: While hunting down bootleg kung-fu DVDs in a Chinatown pawnshop, Jason makes an extraordinary discovery that sends him hurtling back in time to ancient China. There, Jason is charged with a monumental task: he must free the fabled warrior the Monkey King, who has been imprisoned by the evil Jade Warlord. Jason is joined in his quest by wise kung fu master Lu Yan and a band of misfit warriors including Silent Monk. But only by learning the true precepts of kung fu can Jason hope to succeed - and find a way to get back home. The cast led by Jet Li (as The Silent Monk / The Monkey King), Jackie Chan (as Lu Yan / Old Hop), and Michael Angarano (as Jason Tripitikas) is great!

The costume design by Shirley Chan (who also did the costume design to ""Kung Fu Hustle"" (2004) is excellent! This is an action-adventure comedy that will keep you entertained until the very end.

Still, this was an enjoyable few hours, with many good fight scenes and both Jackie Chan and Jet Li. However, there are many references to Taoist mythology that non Taoists will have to research later. This only increases the depth of the movie, and the ending was surprisingly clever.

3107878,1,B0013FZUQK,"I bought this according to all the great reviews.  I also figured that since Jet Li was in it that I could overlook Jackie Chan.  Nothing against Jackie Chan's skills, just his acting and choice of films which I have never enjoyed.  I am rating the movie, not Jackie Chan.

Let me front load this by saying that I am not a fan of Jackie Chan.  Never have been.  So if my martial arts comedy standards may be a bit different from yours but I want to be perfectly honest about this.  After watching Chan's last movie The Forbidden Kingdom I can safely say I never will watch him willingly again.  I relented to watch after a 15 year fast from his last movie and was immediately sorry I had gone back on my word.

BO-RING.  Cheesy bad, all around insulting to kung fu fan's everywhere.  I figured if I fast forwarded to the fight scene with Li/Chan that I would at least feel like I didn't waste my money on this.  I figured wrong.  It was an exercise in annoyance.

It makes me wonder if all these reviews are fake.  I've always trusted Amazon.  I bought this on Amazon based on the reviews which I question now if they are legitimate or just people paid to give a good review who probably didn't pay for the dvd like I did.  I feel duped.",1352160000,,1237,4.217948717948718

3107881,5,B0013FZUQK,Had a lot of culture and left me wanting to see more. A lot more of the movies to follow this one.,1348531200,,98,3.5
3107882,5,B0013FZUQK,"When I picked this up at the library all I knew about it for sure was that it stared Jackie Chan and Jet Li. Being so completely unspoiled for it turned out to be a bad thing because frankly, the opening of the movie did not encourage me to want to spend the time to watch the rest.

We start with a really bad fight sequence in which a character in fantasy makeup leaps around mountain peaks while taking on a large group of opponents. The wire work is awful. There is no attempt to make it seem at all like the improbable leaps are the result of anything but a flying harness. Then it turns out to be a dream sequence and I'm willing to forgive it. Jason Tripitikas, the kid having the dream,  is completely obsessed with kung fu movies. His room is wallpapered in posters, stills, and cut outs from magazines. He feeds his addiction by buying bootleg videos from a pawn shop in China Town for a couple of dollars each.

We follow him there and meet the owner, and old man called Hop and see Jason accidentally discover that Hop has a beautiful golden staff in a back room. He explains that he is waiting for the rightful owner to return for it.

On Jason's way home he gets caught by the local high school tough guys who plan to force him to help them rob Hop's shop. Jason doesn't put up much resistance to them and this is the point where I hit pause so I could rant at the screen. This kid idolizes the kung fu movie heroes, the old man is a good friend, and he can't find the balls to stand up to these guys a little more? They shove him against a wall in a crowded public place and he doesn't even try to get away? This is where if it were a novel I'd be flipping through pages looking for something to see if it got better. It's hard to do that with a movie so I went to Wiki instead. Almost totally spoiled for what was to come I restarted the movie.

Something happens when they get to the shop that ends with Jason and the staff (which is magical of course) getting dropped into The Middle Kingdom.  Sort of manga/anime fantasy version of China where the evil Jade Warlord has been ruling for hundreds of years. The Monkey King had tried to oppose him but was defeated and turned to stone. The Monkey King's staff was flung away at the last moment so the Warlord couldn't get it and that is the staff that Jason has. Jason has to journey to the castle of the Jade Warlord and find a way to return the staff to the Monkey King in order to go home. If all goes well and the Warlord is defeated it will also allow the return of the Jade Emperor and the Middle Kingdom will be free from tyranny.

If you spend any time reading manga or watching anime you run into Journey to the West eventually. It's to Eastern storytelling what King Arthur or Robin Hood would be to a Western audience. Elements of it show up even in tales that aren't direct adaptations. If you're interested head over to Wiki and they'll give you an extensive plot synopsis. In this case they lifted characters from the tale and made use of the fantasy China setting.

The Wizard of Oz influence comes from the structure of the story. There is the framing sequence in the ""real"" world, a fantasy land that is more vibrant and beautiful than the place the protagonist comes from, and people and things that we see in the framing sequence are echoed in the fantasy world.

Once Jason falls into The Middle Kingdom things get good and stay good until nearly the end. Visually it's stunning. The scenery, both natural and CGI enhanced, is breathtaking. If the landscape porn isn't enough you need to see costume design. The robe the Jade Warlord wears at the end is worth the cost of a rental alone. The make up, particularly the Monkey King design, is really well done and the CGI is some of the best I've seen in a movie like this. I only realized it had to be CGI because there was no way they would have built some of the sets that lavishly for just a few minutes of film. The wire work and fight choreography when we get to actual fights outside of Jason's dreams are everything you'd expect from a film with Jet Li and Jackie Chan.

The story is a bit predictable but that's okay. There are some twists to add interest even if they keep to the expected structure.

Jackie Chan is Lu, who is essentially an older version of his Drunken Master character. I loved Drunken Master so I was a happy fangirl when I realized this. Jet Li is ""The Silent Monk"" who is really only totally silent during the bit where we first meet him and he has an extended fight scene with Jackie Chan that is amazing and funny and yet another element that's worth the rental just to see if you like kung fu movies even a little. Lu and the monk double team Jason to teach him kung fu before they reach the final confrontation so he has some small chance to survive. The middle part of the movie is has lots of Rocky and/or Karate Kid type training stuff and shows the budding romance between Jason and Sparrow, a beautiful young assassin with a vendetta against the Warlord.

Before Jason gets home there's an beautiful but evil kung fu fighting sorceress for Sparrow to fight, more scenery and costume porn, a temple of kung fu fighting monks, and near escapes. Once he gets home there is a sequence that had me yelling at the screen again for a few minutes but then it gets good AGAIN for the rest of the movie.

On the whole I really recommend this. It has nothing in it that's unsuitable for kids, in fact they should adore this.",1348099200,,5488,4.2806171648987466
3107903,5,B0013FZUQK,"The Forbidden Kingdom is a fairy tale based on the ancient Chinese classic ""Journey To The West"" by the famous Wu Cheng'en. It tells the story of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, both a hero and an antagonist in both the book and the movie though mostly the former. The movie version differs quite a bit from the book though keeping the spirit of the Monkey King intact. Also, as is often necessary, a modern spin is put on the story in the form of an American kid, the main protagonist, Jason who is played by Michael Angarano.

  In short and without giving away the entire story, the Monkey King is tricked by his rival the Jade Warlord, played by Collin Chou, into putting down his magic invincibility staff and is then imprisoned. He needs his staff back to break free and defeat his enemy. It is Jason's job to get it to him. Jackie Chan plays the Drunken Immortal, a supernatural being that helps Jason along. Jet Li plays the Monkey King. Enough said about the plot.

  This movie has it all. There is comedy in the form of slapstick moments and well-placed jokes, moments of triumph as the heroes win and sadness as all seems lost. Through it all the film is family friendly and most importantly fun. The special effects are good and the fighting scenes are very good, being choreographed by the legendary Yuen Woo Ping. All around, this movie rocked. The HD release also includes a ton of extras, many of which are definitely worth watching.

  I highly recommend this movie. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could. The only other thing I can say is click Add To Cart.",1342483200,3,1580,4.439446366782007

Nope not for me a kids movie maybe. Being a 30 something guy who has loved martial arts movies since I was small this looked like a huge let down for fans. Years passed and caught it one day on HBO while home sick from work. I'm so glad I did. As many reviewers have said it's a good movie. I won't beat that like a dead horse. The things that really caught me off guard were the story. Yeah the white kid back story can be cheesy but really it's kind of a modern day fairy tail that kids and adults will enjoy. The two big names do make a nice addition to the movie they are good especially Jet Li as the Monkey King. By far the best parts of the movie. This movie has it all, giant sweeping vistas, action, nice leading ladies and the monkey king. Check out the special features on this double disc set as well. Awesome feature with the director and some back story to the whole project. The ""film city"" in China they use and it's brief history was almost worth the price of admission itself!

Then one day I found myself watching this again for, what, the 4th or 5th time, without getting bored, and I realized what the producers and writers had done. They had combined the sensibilities of the west with the legends of the east, brought in the two greatest stars of their era, and ended up with film in which there is not one scene out of place. Extraordinary. (And if you wondering how many kung fu films I have actually seen, the answer is hundreds.

3107911,3,B0013FZUQK,"2008's ""The Forbidden Kingdom,"" written by John Fusco and directed by Rob Minkoff, plays almost like a dry-run for the remake of ""The Karate Kid"" that was to be released two years later.

In this earlier film, Michael Angarano plays a martial arts movie geek who finds himself magically transported back to war torn Medieval China after he picks up a mysterious staff in a local porn shop.  Jackie Chan stars as a supposed ""Daoist immortal"" who teaches the transplanted teen the ins and outs of martial arts - and who, apparently, has no trouble comprehending modern American English as spoken by a boy from South Boston.  Jet Li portrays The Monkey King, an immortal who was turned into stone by the evil Jade Warlord and must now be freed with the help of the magic staff now in the boy's possession.

The major selling point of ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" is, of course, that it offers fans the rare opportunity of watching the two greatest icons of modern kung fu cinema doing what they do best in a single film.

Thus, while the script - filled as it is with action movie clichs, cheap sentimentality, two-bit philosophizing and anachronistic one-liners and quips - is certainly nothing to write home about, the production design and karate chop spectacle make the movie at least watchable for the martial arts movie geek in all of us.",1318464000,5,1336,4.716738197424893
3107912,4,B0013FZUQK,"I liked this movie, although I found it a bit slow.  Perhaps it could have been edited a little bit tighter and some scenes could have moved faster.

This film takes the legendary Monkey King and a drunken Immortal as well as other characters from the Chinese mythos and attempts to tell the story in an American  flick with Chinese martial arts.  That idea is still a work in progress, it seems.  Still, take it as it is, a Western film aimed at American teenagers and martial arts enthusiasts.  Even though most of the action takes place in China and has primarily Chinese actors, I, somehow, don't consider this a Chinese film.  The dialogue is also primarily in American English and for me, it seems the film is filtered through American eyes, style, format, custom, fantasy, production and ideals.  For the work it is, I give it five stars, although others may not be so inclined.

Anyway, the film has two great living martial arts legends, Jackie Chan and Jet Li.  It also stars Michael Angarano who plays the young Bostonian with the martial arts fascination and he actually demonstrates quite a few nice martial arts moves.",1315353600,7,1132,4.700507614213198

When I saw this film the first time, I thought it was okay. My preconceived notion of a white protagonist in an essentially all-Chinese cast got the best of my bias leading to me to believe it could've been better. The second time I saw it, I liked it a little more. The subtlety of the story and a few of the themes managed to get a little more empathy out of me. The third time I saw it (as of this review) with all of the extra features and having just been severely disappointed by the big-screen adaptation of The Last Airbender, I now love it. The Forbidden Kingdom is a prime example of how to fuse Eastern atmospherics with Western storytelling, something not easily done in recent memory aside from a handful of titles like Crouching Tiger, Hero, and Huo Yuan Jia (aka Fearless). Granted those are all strictly Chinese productions spoken in Chinese (i.e. more authentic), but what I find so great about Forbidden Kingdom is the degree of detail taken in really capturing the mysticism, fantasy, and martial arts essence of classic Chinese cinema and turning it into an adventurous kind of fairytale that can appeal to both Eastern and Western audiences alike. With people like Peter Pau (Crouching Tiger's photographer), the great Yuen Woo-Ping (choreographer to a lot of great martial arts movies), and two of the biggest Chinese stars in Jackie Chan and Jet Li, it's a grade-A crew. But big props to director Rob Minkoff, producer Casey Silver, and writer Jon Fusco for putting it all together. Thematically, I think the story represents two very important things: the journey West (as in Eastern beliefs and ideals coming to Hollywood), and a little bit of hero/idol-worship (sort of an inverted take on the journey East, since the whole thing was filmed over there and with a Chinese crew). The result was, for me, a very enjoyable film with a little bit of everything (action, adventure, comedy, drama, fantasy). On the downside, the fact that 75% of the movie is in English tends to detract the Chinese actors' performances a little, but I don't think the subtlety would've worked as well without it. But for what it is, I still think it makes for a great kind of escapism compared to another particular movie.

Video - 4.5

As mentioned above, the photography for the movie was done by Oscar-winner Peter Pau of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. And with that said, the video quality of Forbidden Kingdom has a very vibrant and lush presentation. Colors are bold, putting audiences right in the middle of some very beautiful locations around China. As most people probably know from his highly-acclaimed work in Crouching Tiger, the presence of deep green bamboo forests are present yet again in this movie, providing a lot of the same visual nuance and elegance seen there. Image detail is also excellent showing a lot of the fine textures and facial features in the backgrounds, costumes, and actors. Black levels have a nice inky quality to them as well and help in balancing out a lot of the subtle colors in the set design. Contrast is fine, and overall image quality rarely falters throughout the film's run. There were a few times where the image appeared a little softer, though it's never a major distraction. All in all, a great job by the crew, and kudos to Lionsgate for the excellent transfer.

Audio - 5.0

While the picture quality is just short of perfect for me, the 7.1 DTS-HD track delivers on all aspects. High and low ends are reproduced perfectly. Every nuance in the sound effects ranging from forest noise to wind blowing to water dropping is flawless. Dialogue stays clear and understandable (despite some thick accents) through the center channel with no dropout or quality issues. Separation is by far the most crucial factor dividing all sorts of noise throughout the front, sides, and rears. Pay especially close attention during any of the big battle sequences either one-on-one or group-versus-group. No matter how many people there are or how big the stage is, every single voice, sound effect, and chord of music come through clear and sharp. But my favorite scene is the fight between Jackie and Jet. A good deal of LFEs will literally roar your room when Jackie starts fighting in Tiger stance. There are also many other instances within the movie when a lot of body hits make for a nice bassy oomph as well. Outstanding effort by the people at Lionsgate.

Extras - 4.0

For what little there is quantitatively, there's actually a surprising amount of depth in the extras. The most riveting of them is in the P-i-P commentary which takes most of the other behind-the-scenes stuff, dices them into the movie, and adds a little more length to their overall importance. Mind you, the standalone extras are still good in their own right and worth watching (all in HD, too), but fans of the movie should definitely give each of these a watch. Topics discussed cover a lot of ground ranging from production, logistics, shooting, general perspective on both Chinese filming and overall culture and how it's perceived in the West, the conditions in which the film came to be written and cast, and much more. I found all of them to be quite informative and hope that in seeing this movie, more audiences (myself included) will find something to explore and discover beyond just Hollywood.

Overall - 4.5

To this day, I consider The Forbidden Kingdom to be amongst my favorite martial arts fantasy epics. It does an excellent job of blending East and West and makes for a very fun adventure movie. It's something of an oddity in that I feel it's geared more towards the kung fu fanboy in all of us, but at the same time it somehow manages to stand on its own as a kind of fairytale story as well. With some of the top of the top in production crew and cast, the film is a wonderful experience in discovery and movie-watching and is presented with excellence in another great effort by Lionsgate. Highly recommended for martial arts and fantasy fans.",1278633600,5,6002,4.741379310344827

Those tend to be darker with complex relationship and usually the fighting and killing are ruthless with body parts getting ripped apart. Maybe that is why reviewers are saying this is more family friendly. Overall, the story was well thought out. The kung fu fighting scenes were intense and top quality. All actors did very well in portraying their characters. I never watched it because I heard bad reviews from critics when the movie came out. Finally saw it. And I was thoroughly entertained. In terms of showing it to kids, there are still some spots of violence that are not for kids. I probably would limit this movie for kids at least 14 years old. One more thing.

3107977,5,B0013FZUQK,"5 of 5 stars for the fantasy adventure movie The Forbidden Kingdom. FK stars two of my favoriteaction actors in lead roles, Jackie Chan and Jet Li. I understand that this movie is based on a Chinese story of the Monkey King (btw I was born in the year of the Monkey). Jet Li plays the Monkey King who is captured by a evil lord and held forever. The magic staff (long pole) of the Monkey King makes it way thru time to a shop in LA. A young man (Michael Angarano) is given the staff by the shop keeper and told to return to its rightful owner. He finds that he has been transported to the Forbidden Kingdom where his adventure begins. First he meets a drunk man (Jackie Chan) and later a young lady ""the Sparrow"" (Yifei Liu).

A really nice story that is beautifully photographed. The wire line fights were good but as always seem fake (ah I mean super-natural). The story is good for the whole family. Great fight sequences (of course when you have Li and Chan). I specially liked how Li played the Monkey King during fight sequences. The beautiful sweetheart of the movie is the Sparrow (Liu). The sexy one is ""the Witch"" (Bingbing Li) with her magic hair.

3107979,5,B0013FZUQK,"Okay, given that the century is still fairly young, and given that Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee had their fights ALL THE WAY back in the late-1900's, this is still a very worthwhile movie to watch.

The storyline is a bit tacky with a white kid going into this parallel/past universe/timeline, but the fighting sequences definitely carry this movie. The acting, when compared to old Chinese fighting movies, is pretty on-par, and the always-humorous Chan paired with the statuesque Li (and his hyperactive jovial monkey alter-ego) makes for a very entertaining movie throughout.

This is the first Blu-ray movie that I have viewed (decided to give my PS3 a healthy workout), and the detail and sharpness of everything is extraordinary. The fighting scenes defnitely come alive. I am still trying to figure out how to fully utilize the Blu-ray's functionalities (like the RGBY buttons?), but not a whole lot of different menu options than a normal DVD.

Jackie Chan is my favorite actor though and the fight scene between them was worth the price. I thought adding the kid would make it lamer but it didn't bother me too much.

""The Forbidden Kingdom"" is another example of his talents, geniality and flair for comedy in addition to the obvious martial arts skills he's shown us all these years.

To make long story very short, this is tale an American teen who finds an ornate bo-staff at a friend's shop in Chinatown and the kid's mission winds up to deliver this age-old weapon to its rightful owner across the world in China and in a different time period. Yeah, I know, the story is ludicrous, but who cares? It's an entertaining film with some great stunts and some good humor. We have young people, old people, amateur fighters and pros, pretty girls with pretty moms, exotic locales and a lot of seriousness mixed with goofiness and Chinese mythology.

Jet Li plays a silent monk, while Jackie Chan adopts the persona of a drunken scholar.  The fight contrasts the different styles of these two masters, and is well worth the price of the dvd for martial arts fans.

The story itself is a bit of a stretch.  An American martial arts film fan gets his hands on an ancient bo staff, and is transported back in time to ancient China.  In order to return home, this boy, Jason, must return the staff to the legendary Monkey King, played by Jet Li.  The story is a stretch in the sense that the inhabitants of ancient China wouldn't know English, and the film just fuzzies out this detail.

But then again, with so many action scenes packed into this film, an inconsistency in the script is a minor thing.  After all, people watch The Forbidden Kingdom for its multiple fight scenes, not for the story.  As long as you understand what to expect from this film, you will find yourself dazzled by the incredible action scenes.",1237334400,2,1265,4.508771929824562

Its a fun movie worth watching and re-watching. Looks and sounds amazing in Blu. The picture at times is breathtaking. I am not sure that i would call this a family movie, but i am bit conservative so it might be fine for you. For me it seems like a ten and above movie. Its not that there is much language but there is some, and the ineuendos are sometimes over the top, for little children i think. but for teens and adults great story with a great message.",1236038400,2,655,4.046153846153846

The movie has some fictional kung fu and characters which Im not that big a fan of. Even still this is acceptable if the story is good. This movie falls way short of this. I mean the storyline is just bad. The dialogue sucks and it looks like no effort was put into this.

The only reason I didn't give it a one is because I liked the fight between Jet Li and Jackie Chan. I also thought the movie was warming up to a 3 in the end. It started to get a little interesting. But the fact that this movie was not well thought out just hurt it too much. I couldn't come to give it a 3.

The ending wasn't good, the beginning was corny, and the middle was so so. This combines for a lucky two. If you want to be disappointed by expecting a classic movie then go ahead and buy it. You've been warned, this movie is not even fair.",1235606400,,1087,3.954337899543379

The action and fight scenes are pretty good. The plot is weak but doable. It's the acting that really ruins this movie. I thought Jackie Chan was awful. His scenes pretending to be drunk were awful. He just totally didn't pull it off. I thought the main kid in this movie was pretty bad himself and the girl that followed the three guys around was pretty forgetable herself.

You'd think if you could afford Jackie Chan and Let Li that that they would be able to attract other actors who at least took some acting classes but that apparently was not the case.

The film maintained many characteristics of classic kung fu movies but replaced the irrational dialogs with good character development.  We all know Jackie Chan is a comedian of great sort, but it was nice to see a jovial side of Jet Li as well.  These two played well off of each other and progressed the story well.

3108028,4,B0013FZUQK,"The Forbidden Kingdom is a great romp through time travel back to when there was a bid for superiority in China of the Immortals.  Pretty cool stuff for the kid who just can't get enough of Kung Fu movies.  Maybe the young boy from Boston who could not fight his way out of a paper bag liked KF movies so much that he fantisized about beating his opponents.  He goes back in time to deliver to the rightful owner of an ancient staff that has great powers.

Chan is a drunken ancient who lives off of wine and Jet Li is a priest of sorts who is on a quest to find the person who will give the staff back to its owner as well.  The young boy from Boston learns martial arts while in the care of Li and Chan.

Really, I could see the writer of this amazing action fantasy being a would be Kung Fu expert who wished all of his or her life to be just that expert.  It represents good verses evil and hard work to get to improve yourself.  Again, keeping in mind it is a fantasy, people flying through the air, well, it is no difference than a Harry Potter type of film.

Chan and Li together make a great team.  I hearkened back to the time of Bruce Lee type flicks.  Definate fun for the Kung Fu buff.",1234051200,2,1197,4.029661016949152

3108031,4,B0013FZUQK,"Director Rob Minkoff's The Forbidden Kingdom is at once influenced by, and a tribute to early martial arts films, notably the Shaw Brother's classic, Come Drink With Me.  In fact, two of its main leads Yifei Liu's Golden Sparrow and Jackie Chan's drunken master Lu Yan, are directly derived from that 1966 pioneering Kung-Fu film.  Minkoff however adds an element of fantasy and even tosses in a sprinkle of The Karate Kid.

The film opens in modern day Boston.  Jason (Michael Angarano) is obsessed with Kung-Fu films and frequents a pawn shop run by Old Hop (also played by Chan) to buy DVDs.  When a neighborhood gang forces Jason to help them rob the old man, Jason escapes with an antique staff he finds himself transported back to ancient China.  Jason learns the tale of the Monkey King (Jet Li), and immortal Kung-Fu master who was tricked and turned to stone by the ruthless Jade Warlord.  Only the return of his staff can free the Monkey King and end the Warlord's rule.

Jason meets the drunken Lu Yan and the beautiful Golden Sparrow, who seeks vengeance against the Warlord for the murder of her family.  They are soon joined by the Silent Monk (also played by Jet Ji) who recognizes Jason as the Seeker of prophecy to return the staff.  Soon both Lu Yan and the Monk are tutoring Jason in the martial arts as they trek towards the Five Elements Mountain and a showdown with the Warlord, the White Witch, and the entire Jade army.

At its heart, Forbidden Kingdom is a typical fantasy quest story, not unlike the Lord of the Rings or hundreds of other books lining the fantasy shelves.  We have the reluctant hero in Jason who only wants to go home, his wise (and wise-cracking) mentors, and the vengeance-driven heroine.  On the other side, Collin Chou is charmingly evil as the Jade Warlord and Lin Bingbing rounds things out as the dangerous White Witch.

So while the plot isn't necessarily original, the film excels in its production, action, and special effects.  The set design is simply magnificent, from the breath taking scenery from the tops of the mountains to the meticulous authenticity of the Jade Warlord's palace.  While some of the fight scenes may go on too long, there's no denying the dynamics of the choreography and incredible high-wire stunt work.  There are moves and maneuvers pulled off that you've never scene before in martial arts films.  Lu Yan's battle with the White Witch whose long tresses are her main weapon was one of the true highpoints of the film.  The Monkey's King's final showdown with the Jade Warlord is also fantastic.

As you might expect from a film with Jackie Chan, there is a good deal of humor in the script, most of it initiated by him or at the expense of his character.  While not known for humor, Li holds his own as the straight man.

You do have to suspend beliefs on a few things, such as how Jason is able to communicate with the rest of the characters when he doesn't speak Chinese and they, presumably, don't speak English.  Also there is the fact that Jason seemingly becomes a Kung-Fu master with just a few days training but if you can believe that Sam was able to mortally wound Shelob than you can certainly believe this as well.

I agree with the blurb that this is a must see movie, the best martial arts epic ever made. Everything about this movie is excellent: its story, its costumes, its training and especially its martial arts sequences. I have seen most Jet Li and Jacki Chan's movies but I have never seen them fighting so gloriously as in this DVD.  After 1 viewing one is usually familar with its story. But, it requires many viewings to appreciate its martial arts sequences. I have seen this DVD 7 times and still want to see its martial arts sequences more and more, perhaps because I am a senior instructor in a Kung Fu School and a black belt in Ju Jit Su.

3108058,4,B0013FZUQK,"The Forbidden Kingdom marks the very first time in the Iconic careers of Jet Li and Jackie Chan that they have worked together; fans of both these superstars are bound to have high expectations, but keep in mind this is an American production and in general Li and Chan, while making some good movies in the States they don't hold a candle to their Hong Kong flicks. But despite any flaws The Forbidden Kingdom makes a solid flick for these two Icons to team up together. Who knew it would take this long? One would have figured by this point in their careers some filmmaker would have tried to cash in far earlier.

The Forbidden Kingdom may not be a Martial Arts flick for the ages, but I have to say I really enjoyed this one. The movie is just so much fun that any flaws that can be found are quite easy to overlook. This isn't gonna go down in history as one of the greats, but due to the first teaming of Li and Chan it will go down for that. This may not be Fist of Legend, but this is as fun of a movie you'll come across.

Writer John Fusco (Young Guns & Young Guns II) does a fairly good ob with the script. This may not be one of the all time great screenplays, but it works well and is highly entertaining. I've seen a few movies written by Fusco I find his work entertaining. With The Forbidden Kingdom the script isn't perfect, but has a good mix of light drama and good comedy as well as in my opinion very likeable and fun characters.

Who knew the director of such movies as The Lion King and Stuart Little could make such an entertaining action flick. Going into The Forbidden Kingdom I wasn't sure what to expect with Rob Minkoff directing. This is very far removed from what he's known for and again I really didn't know what to expect. But I have to give Rob Minkoff credit he actually does an excellent job. The pacing is solid and never lags at all; each scene is as entertaining as the last and while Minkoff doesn't make a perfect film he does make a very fun film. The action scenes are solid and overall Rob Minkoff makes one of the better American action movies the past few years.

When you have Woo-ping Yuen doing the fight scenes you know right off the bat no matter how the movie is overall the fight scenes will be good. Woo-ping Yuen has been involved in some of the greatest action movies ever made and while The Forbidden Kingdom may not be his most impressive work in his career, but it's still better than most of what we see in Hollywood. The fight scenes are excellent, but not quite on par with Yuen's other movies, but the fight scenes are fun and the viewer should enjoy it.

Obviously the highlight of the movie is the fight scene with Jet Li and Jackie Chan; fans of these two are bound to love that and it runs at a good length and granted it may not be their strongest work, but it still gets the job done and is bound to put a smile on the faces of the viewer.

The performances are strong for the most part and Jet Li & Jackie Chan are fun to watch and both seem to be enjoying themselves with their roles. Yifei Liu, Li Bing Bing and Michael Angarano provide solid performances and are able to hold their own along side Li and Chan.

The Forbidden Kingdom is by no means one of the great Martial Arts flicks, but for what it's worth it is one of the most fun times you'll have. Despite any flaws The Forbidden Kingdom is highly enjoyable.

The Blu-ray looks simply amazing! The picture is crystal clear and it really enhances the movie watching it on Blu-ray. I'm still new to Blu-ray, but The Forbidden Kingdom will be tough to top.",1230768000,3,3584,4.252569750367107

Along the way, Jason meets a drunk (played by Chan) and monk (also played by Li) who help train Jason in kung fu fighting so he can return the staff to the Monkey King.

The camera work was not too crazy so you could actually see the artistry in the fights. The best fight scene had to be the one, mid movie, b/n Chan and Li's characters. I wish there were a little more laughs, better script, and the English was a little easier to hear (thick accents). The wirework in the fight scenes was pretty obvious during some parts (and not just during the Monkey King scenes where it seemed to be intentional). Chan's drunk character was a little too slurry for me and Li's Monkey King character was a little too flippant. I thought the third person talk by Golden Sparrow and the hair parts at the end of the movie were pretty random and out of the blue.",1229299200,,1111,4.240566037735849

If you thought that you will be disappointed. It is much more serious than ""Karate Kid"", but it has a fair amount of humor thrown in initially. It is meant to be a movie the family can enjoy and they will. A nice mix of modern and ancient with East meets West. Good casting with Michael Angarano as the Jersey American thrown into the past, where he meets three masters of Kung Fu in Ancient China played by Jackie Chan, Jet Li, and Yifei Liu. He must take a special staff that was given to him by a dying Chinese Pawn Shop owner, played by Chan, to the Monkey King, played by Li. Chan reuses his role as a drunken master in the Ancient China role as he has done well before in other movies. Although this movie is more adventure than huge Kung Fu choregraphed fights, there are still plenty of those in the movie. Chan and Li both played two parts adeptly, and I recommend it. I give it three and a half stars. Great quality DVD with extras and good replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Kung Fu Hustle"".

3108067,2,B0013FZUQK,"I saw this movie couple times and both DVD and in the theatre. On average, this movie is below any kung Fu Movie either from China, Hong Kong or even Kung Fu Panda! Let me explain.
1. The main character Jason - the American kid  he might be a teen ager, neither he is cute or handsome. I don;t why the director chose this guy, from the beginning to the end of the movie, I didn't see anything sparkling about him.
2. The basic color or tone of this movie looks like a old 60's or 70's style. From the beginning in Chinatown, ( any costume in the movie) to the end,... It's all very dark, old, looks really strange and like a batman movie, even  the characters - forgot the name of the bad guy - his mandarin is very strange and his make up is too much.....
3. This might be a movie for families, but I think from beginning it;s still too vilentcy. It's not good for kid,
4. The two girls in the Movie- White hair girl and Golden Swallow,  they're both very good actors from China, and from this movie, it's a waste for their talent.
5. Like what I said before, the basic tone of this movie is very dark, looks more like a animation and the scenery is very fake....

It's even worse as a kung fu movie.

That two masters of the craft such as Jet Li and Jackie Chan would pick this as their first movie to do together tells me they didn't understand the English script too well. Even Yuen-Woo Ping's fight choreography was lacking in this and that is a first. The script is boring and plain. Chan is not as funny as usual. Li's character has little substance, and Yifei Lu has little reason to be there at all. The villains have names like the Witch and the Warlord, terrible. The kid was likable but, hard to believe he became a kung fu master in a few days and even when he did it looked bad.

The fight between Chan and Li is good even though it's set in the wrong film and they're a little older and slower, they're still 1000 times better than everyone else in the movie.

Found in all countries with a Buddhist tradition, this very long novel has never (to my knowledge) been translated into an English language Hollywood production... until now.  Fortunately, the producers cast the world's two most famous martial arts actors, Jet Li and Jackie Chan, to star in it.  Having read the Monkey King story, I can say that this movie only loosely follows the original legend.  However, it has not been romanticized too much by Hollywood.  Even though the movie stars two very attractive Chinese actresses, there is no romance scene.  There is a lot of action and a lot of comedy.  The comedy is great, and highly original to Western viewers, though not necessarily to Chinese viewers familiar with the story.  The action however is where the movie lets done.  Being a Chinese movie, almost all the action focuses on martial arts fight scenes, and they all look copied from previous kung fu movies such as Crouching Tiger; Hidden Dragon, Shanghai Noon, House of Flying Daggers, etc...  Probably the best part of this movie is storyline, numerous scenes are quite unpredictable and engaging.  So overall, a good movie but not a great one.",1224892800,,1230,4.837320574162679

This is the most enjoyable work I've seen from Chan since ""Who Am I"" or ""Gorgeous"" in the late 90's.  Li still looks good in performance (he does some fantastic stick-fighting), and we might still have a little while with him.

The plot is a cross between ""The Never Ending Story"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"", with a dash of ""The Karate Kid"" and ""Highlander"" thrown in.  Point being:  It's silly.  Bearing that in mind, it's very well executed and visually stunning.  Plus it contains a crapload of references to various Shaw Bros and Wuxia films.  HERE GOES:  A young martial-arts-movie-enthusiast named Jason (Michael Angarano) dreams about the Monkey King (Li) at night before entering an old store in Chinatown run by the elderly Hop (Chan), who sells bootleg DVDs.  Some bullies then use Jason to break into Hop's, since he knows the owner.  During the chaos, Hop is shot by the gang leader.  Despite his injury, Hop gives Jason an old staff and tells him it must be returned to its rightful owner.  Jason runs away from the gang to a nearby rooftop, where he is magically whisked away to ancient China!  Having no idea how he got there, he wanders around until he is attacked by soldiers, who are looking for the staff.  He is helped by a wandering drunk named Lu Yan (Chan, again), who tells him that the staff belongs to the Monkey King, and must be returned to him, and kept out of the clutches of the evil Jade Warlord (Collin Chou, ""Flash Point"", ""Fearless"") who imprisoned the Monkey King in the first place.  Joining them along the way are Golden Sparrow (Yifei Liu), a young girl whose parents were killed by the Jade Warlord, and a monk (Li, again), whose vested interest is also to return the staff to the Monkey King.

The fights are done by Yuen Woo Ping, and while pretty good, could have been better.  I know that he's the man when it comes to martial arts choreography, but I've grown tired of his style, especially concerning wires.  He just doesn't seem to know when to say when.  Luckily, this is the type of movie where it's more in keeping with the story.  After all, this is a fantasy movie with plenty of magic.  Hell; the Monkey King, the Jade Warrior, and Lu Yan are all immortals.  In fact, Lu Yan is one of the 8 Drunken Immortals, referenced in a style during Chan and Woo Ping's 1978 classic ""Drunken Master"".  One thing I will say about the fights is that there are quite a few of them, so I shouldn't gripe too much.  There are some pretty sweet (and very creative) moments during the action, the highlight of which is the fight between Chan and Li.  Their fight could never live up to its expectations, but it's still a lot of fun, much like the rest of the film.  Even the character of Jason does some cool stuff in the last act.  I rented this, and am considering purchase, so I musta liked it quite a bit.  At the very least, this is the best martial arts fantasy aimed at kids since ""Surf Ninjas"".

Upon its initial release, there were already 3 versions of the disc, including Blu Ray.  This DVD is in widescreen with fantastic picture quality.  The xtras are plentiful, but I was hoping for some interviews with the two leads, whose behind-the-scenes antics are barely glimpsed during the other features.  It's in English and some Cantonese with subtitles available in Spanish.  This also has running commentary by director Rob Minkoff and screenwriter John Fusco.  Fusco's script is based on the classic Chinese novel ""Journey to the West"".  I would love to see a serious movie about the legend of the Monkey King.  He is the trickster of Chinese mythology, and I'm fascinated by his folklore.  3.5/5

I had a sinking feeling a while ago, when I saw that this movie was being promoted with the youngsters in mind. Turns out, THE FORBIDDEN KINGDOM is good enough that I'm glad I got the chance to see it, and to enjoy it for what it is, which is a decent but routine and defanged martial arts picture aimed at kids. But should fans of Jet Li and Jackie Chan feel cheated? Maybe. Probably.

The premise revolves around Jason Tripitkas (Michael Angarano), a bullied Boston teenager who is geeked about all things wushu, to the extent that he hangs out a lot at a shabby Chinese shop in search of bootleg kung fu movies. An unconvincing chain of events transports this kid back in time to an enchanted ancient China, during the reign of heavenly emperors, mighty warlords and the legendary Monkey King. Jason ends up with the Monkey King's staff and unwillingly sets off on a quest to free the trapped Monkey King, who had been transformed into stone. It's the only way Jason can get home.

The kid meets and is taken under the wing of the tatterred, boozy Lu Yan (Chan), one of the eight Immortals, with this particular Immortal's powers stemming from a constant intake of wine (those who've already seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drunken-Master/dp/B00005YUNV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drunken Master</a>&nbsp;will get a refresher course on drunken-fist kung fu). Some time in the movie, Jet Li's white-robed Silent Monk shows up and, along with Lu Yan, strives to mentor the kid (cue in flashes of THE KARATE KID). And naturally there's also a beautiful but troubled orphan girl named Golden Sparrow, who's out to revenge her murdered parents. And Sparrow touts a mean martial arts skill set. These four end up challenging the fearsome Jade Warlord, who rules ancient China with an iron fist and who can magically influence earth (he was the one who transformed the Monkey King into a stone statue). The Jade Warlord right away shows the potential to be a pretty formidable big bad, but in the end the predictable storyline renders him mediocre.

Thing is, THE FORBIDDEN KINGDOM is much less than what I expected from a first teaming up of Jet Li and Jackie Chan. These two icons deserve more. It would've been wicked cool if they'd landed a richer, more ambitious, more epic story. Something with a more emotional and philosophical core. An R Rating also would've elevated this film, possibly have made it darker and more intense in tone. Instead of this lightweight product, which is entertaining, but is still fluff. The movie also instantly lost credibility points with me when the main protagonist turned out to be this American kid, and that the bookend scenes took place in the U.S. No knock on the kid, 'cause he was okay, but I can't help but feel that this collaboration would've been better served - would've resonated more - if filmed in the East and in Chan and Li's native tongue. Because then they would've been fully in their element. In this movie, Jackie Chan's accent is thick enough that, most times, I couldn't understand his lines; I was craving sub-titles so bad. By doing it the way they did, the film certainly takes advantage of the two stars' crossover appeal. But a measure of integrity and street cred slips away. Was I expecting too much, hoping for a meaningful movie?

The very best parts, it shouldn't be a surprise, are the action sequences, with the riveting one-on-one tussle between Jackie and Jet shaming the other fight scenes (although Jackie's tavern brawl is also nice). It does shock me a bit that both of these guys are still so limber and athletic; I believe Jackie was 54 years old at the time and Jet, 45. But then, with action choreographer Woo-Ping Yuen in charge, we're talking first rate wire-fu stuff here. Jet is quite good as the Silent Monk (he scatters a few words here and there) and also as the cheeky, mystical Monkey King. Note that Jackie also plays two roles, although his old shopkeeper isn't really a very sexy part. However, his inebriated Immortal is certainly showy enough. Jackie and Jet's moments together make for intriguing viewing, not so much because they're tearing up the scenery or anything, but more because of the historical significance. Throughout the watching of the film, I couldn't quite believe that someone had finally managed to get these two together.

Yifei Liu plays Golden Sparrow, who annoyingly refers to herself in the third person. Bingbing Li is the Jade Warlord's accomplice Ni Chang, who will remind old-schoolers of the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bride-With-White-Hair/dp/630502054X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bride With White Hair</a>. I read that these two girls, who are big names in the East, didn't have an extensive background in the martial arts, but that they trained their you-know-whats off and, on screen, they end up looking like they know what they're doing. They're quite graceful.

There are bits of humor present, mostly provided by Jackie Chan's Lu Yan. The funniest bit takes place when Lu Yan, in the scorching desert, prays for water and then kind of has his wish granted. In a way, what happens to Lu Yan in that scene is kind of how I feel the hardcore martial arts fans were treated.

The visuals are very good, but don't quite achieve the spectacular poetry of HERO or HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS or CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. The CGI stuff here is okay, but, honestly, I would've bartered the computer effects for more of Jackie and Jet in action. They may now be older and greyer and less spry, but you won't convince me that they can't still qualify as walking, breathing, kicking, punching, flippin' human highlights.

If you're craving family film fluff, then THE FORBIDDEN KINGDOM is made to order. But if you're a diehard fan of Jet Li and Jackie Chan, you might not help but feel a bit cheated.",1222992000,2,6084,4.9393939393939394

3108131,4,B0013FZUQK,"This film catches a lot of flack for having little depth to it in terms of story and for being like a cheezy kung fu flick with good stunts and special effects. And personally i'd be inclined to agree, since that's exactly what it is.

In summary, Forbidden Kingdom is the story about some wanna be kung fu white boy from Boston who loves old badly dubbed Kung-Fu flicks who gets sucked into the past to Ancient China by some mysterious vortex gate thingy to return this mystical staff to its ""rightful owner"" who we later find out belongs to the Monkey King. Yeah...

So anyway, as I said, the story isn't really all that deep. Its got all the basic elements that make a movie plot work and move forward, but frankly, this movie was just an excuse to get Jet Li and Jackie Chan together in a movie and let them kick each others and everyone else's butt. And truthfully, I gotta say I loved it. well, maybe not loved, but liked a lot. Personally I don't really think this was made to be some huge masterfully done epic movie like Hero or Fearless, but rather just a fun to watch Kung-Fu flick that pays homage to a lot of the old school films that we grew up on. So if you never seen it, I suggest you not look so deep into and take it for what it is; a fun movie.

3108143,4,B0013FZUQK,"The Good Things
*Good video/sound quality (great on Blu-Ray).
*Avalaible in either a single-disc version with no features, or 2-disc or Blu-Ray versions with numerous featurettes and a digital copy of the film.
*The movie itself has quite a bit of great fight scenes and slick special effects.
*Its very well-filmed.  Lots of strong imagery and colors.  Good cameramanship.
*Production design is great.  Costumes and sets are very detailed and vivid.
*Storyline is okay.
*Okay music.
*Violence is not so bad, and there is nothing graphic.  Would be acceptable for older children (rated PG-13).

The Bad Things
*Characters are nothing to scream about.  The Monkey King and the guy Jackie Chan played were probably the most memorable characters.  The main character is just a boy who wants to go home, and shows no development (other than is fighting skills).  Bad guys were cool, but also shallow.

The Questionable Things
*The movie overall is short and simple.  Its great for quick and easy entertainment, but don't expect anything as deep, complex, or moving as other wuxia films (like ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" or ""Hero"").

This is what you get when you mix ""The Neverending Story""'s plot structure with an Asian fantasy epic.  It's pretty darn fun, with lots of great fighting, special effects, and smooth photography.  But it lacks depth in its characters and story.  It makes for some awesome mindless entertainment, but if you're a fan of the genre and looking for something thought-provoking or deep, this would not be it.",1222214400,2,1536,5.067729083665339

The best fight scenes are when Li and Chan are fighting each other.  Li and Chan are about 15 years past their prime, but the fight scenes still work. There is a underlying respect each character has for the other.

The best scenes are when the masters are teaching the young American kid kung fu. The kid at an early point in his training asks Jackie Chan's character if he gets to learn all the moves he's learned in the video game. Jackie takes a bowl of rice and gives him an object lesson about learning and life that is somewhat profound.

3108148,4,B0013FZUQK,"While the '08 film `The Forbidden Kingdom' starring Chinese superstars Jet Li and Jackie Chan certainly doesn't qualify for the Martial Arts Cinematic Hall of Fame there is definitely more positive than negative to be said about this production. Admittedly there's not a lot original here, one can clearly see a plethora of storyline elements liberally borrowed from other films, some of the most obvious being; `The Neverending Story', `The Karate Kid' and `The Wizard of Oz'. There are also occasional hints of; `Warriors of Virtue', `Narnia' and `Lord of the Rings' that are hard to miss. Since this is a martial arts film one cannot help but notice a few similarities with such Chinese films as the blockbuster `Hero' and the lesser known cult classic `Legend of Zu'.

Ok, I think I've made my point. Originality is definitely not the strength of this film. However that doesn't mean that the viewer, especially the younger males in the audience won't enjoy this one immensely. The action is fast and furious, Shia LaBeouf look-a-like Michael Angarano is likeable and solid in the role of Jason Tripitkas, the fung fu fan who is transported through time and space to ancient China to return the magical staff to the mythic Monkey King. Liu Yifei will also attract your full attention as the lovely young female warrior Golden Sparrow.

3108165,4,B0013FZUQK,"The Story: Some bloke called Jason Tripitakas (Michael Angarano) is entrusted a golden-staff by a dying pawnshop owner, Hop (Jackie Chan) to be returned to its rightful owner. It turns out that the rightful owner is the legendary Monkey-King (Jet Li). Jason somehow fell through the Gate of No-Gate (don't ask) and landed in Ancient China. Thus begins his quest to carry the staff all the way to the Five-Element Mountains and return it to the Monkey-King, who had been turned to stone by the evil Jade Warlord (Colin Chou). Along the way, he meets up with the Drunken Taoist Lu Yan (also played by Jackie Chan), a Monk (also played by Jet Li) and Golden Sparrow (Liu Yifei). Together, they form the Fellowship of the Staff and travel to the Five-Element Mountains to confront the evil Jade Warlord and his assistant, the Bride With White Hair (Li Bing Bing).

Acting: C'mon, you're not planning to watch this film for the acting, right? If you are, you'll probably want to murder the annoying Michael Angarano! He plays this stupid kid obsessed with Shaw Bros. kung-fu movies who is thrust into this fantasy world where everyone speaks English with a Chinese-accent. Therefore, he appears blur throughout the film - even when he finally kills the evil Jade Warlord! The best actor in the film is Jackie Chan. He's not as good a martial artist as Jet Li but he's a far better comic-actor. As for the others, Colin Chou does a good job as the megalomaniacal Jade Warlord. Liu Yifei is under-utilized here. She doesn't do much except to look good and to play the pipa. I was surprised by how good her English was though (unless it's dubbed). Li Bing Bing, known for her roles as the quiet and demure girl, puts in a surprising turn as the maniacal Bride With White Hair (a role made famous by veteran actress Bridgette Lin).

Cinematography, Setting & Soundtrack: The sets and scenery are breath-taking. Throw in a beautiful soundtrack and the whole thing looked and felt really epic. I also loved the opening credits with animated shots featuring old Shaw Bros. movie posters. The whole movie comes across as a weird mixture of The Lord Of The Rings, Chinese mythology and Shaw Bros. wuxia but it works! The whole Ancient China landscape is really an imaginary fantasy-wonderland. Watching this movie (and seeing through the eyes of the lead character Jason Tripitakas) is like being immersed in a fantasy-land of flying characters, magical weapons, mystical mountains and maidens who looked like Liu Yifei.

Fighting: Finally, the main reason why you want to watch this movie. Just to let you know, there's only one real long fight scene between Jackie Chan and Jet Li but that alone is worth the price of admission. Very well choreographed fight by veteran Yuen Wo-Ping. In other words, Jackie Chan does his Drunken Master stuff and Jet Li does his lightning-fast kicks & punches. Other than that, we also get countless other fights with the soldiers of the evil Jade Warlord, Jackie Chan beating up a lady (Li Bing Bing) into pulp and the 3,294,285th time Jet Li fights Colin Chou in a movie! There are also some really good expositions of Zen-like thoughts on martial-arts during the scenes when Jackie and Jet both take turns to teach Jason Tripitakas.

Overall: Very fun action-adventure movie for the whole family. The kids will love it (and so will the ""kid"" in you). I'm getting the DVD once it's out. Knowing my kids, they'll probably watch it again and again and again... :)",1220918400,2,3484,4.772802653399668

3108168,5,B0013FZUQK,I really enjoyed this movie... I have been a Jackie Chan fan since I can remember and it's so great to see him make a movie with another Master like Jet Li --- you can distinctly see the difference with their fighting style and it's amazing to see it on the big screen --- I do hope that this won't be the movie they will make together -- this is definitely a must on your DVD collection!!!,1220054400,2,390,4.077922077922078
3108169,4,B0013FZUQK,"I think people should not be taking this movie seriously. I think the story line is too far fetch (to connect somebody from New Jersey to ancient China) but the actions are awesome. It's an ""OK"" spin off from the story ""Journey to the West.""",1220054400,3,241,4.377777777777778
3108170,4,B0013FZUQK,"Since I've been studding martial artes(Kung Fu, 7 Star Praying Mantis) for a year or so now, I thought it'd be cool to view the latest kung-fu flick. Obviously, as all Kung-Fu movies are, the main feature of Kingdom is sparring, and throughout, my inner nerd came out to say ""Bad Ass!"" on more than one occasion. But, as all martial artes movies are, fightings the strongs suit, while the story was lack-luster. Start off with a average joe who's fix is Hong Kong Hollywood, and soon, that's his reality, he trys to escape while fighting the immortal emporor. Which is fine, I'm not looking for a Metal Gear style story. But when you have two legends from the genre(Chan and Li), I'd expect everyone to step up their game(I'm looking at you Liu Yi Fei). But more importantly, why even have the American here? You have Jakie Chan(looking like the Chinese Jack Sparrow) and Jet Li fighting? Heck, I'd make that the whole movie. Never the less, it was neat to see the diffrent philosphy and items, that I've studied, talked about and used throughout.

 Besides being an imspirational source for me me in technique, the Kingdom has a fine frequency of fighting for a film, but just blah in between.",1219881600,2,1194,4.627358490566038
3108171,4,B0013FZUQK,"Two of the biggest icons in 20th Century martial arts band together for the first time in a great adventure film. We are all familiar with Jet Li's work as being primarily serious and very intense, whereas Jackie Chan's movies tend to be more comical when using his style of Kung Fu. This film blends the two styles together brilliantly in a fun, moving and intense fantasy adventure film.

Relatively unknown actor Michael Angarano plays Jason Tripitikas, a martial arts fanatic who, one day while making another regular visit to Lu Yan's Pawn shop discovers a legendary staff previously owned by the Sage and Warrior The Monkey King. That night Jason is forced into tricking the owner into letting in a group of robbers who shoot the elderly owner. Jason is told by the owner that he must take the staff and return it to its rightful owner, so he runs off with the staff in hand. On the roof he's dragged over the edge by an unseen force which transports him a few hundred years into ancient China.

Jason wakes up in ancient China completely bewildered by what just happened. He wakes up in a small village which is then attacked by Jade Warriors but is saved by the drunken immortal Lu Yan (Jackie Chan). Yan tells Jason the story of the staff and how it used to belong to the immortal Monkey King (Jet Li), but whilst in a battle with the Jade Warlord (Colin Chou) he's tricked into putting down his staff and is encased in a Jade prison. Managing to cast the staff away, a prophecy foretells that the staff will one day be returned to the King and the battle can be ended once and for all.

I have to be honest and say that this film isn't something we haven't seen before. It's simply a blend of the 20th and 21st century martial arts based movies, such as The Karate Kid and Crouching Tiger. Crouching Tiger in the choreography and style of the fight sequences, The Karate Kid in the way of geeky kid becomes a master at the martial arts. This type of thing could put a lot of people off, and to be honest I wouldn't blame them. Personally, the main appeal of this film is the fact that it stars both Jet Li and Jackie Chan.

Now Michael Angarano I think to some will just be a small time actor given a surprisingly big role. To many people including myself, he's simply an actor we've never heard of that kind of looks like Shia Labeouf. Although he's not really a big name movie actor, he certainly delivered in this role and it should lead to much bigger things for the 21 year old. Chan as always is great in his fighting sequences and his general comic role, this time as the loveable, yet skilful drunk. Li is as always quite the serious character, but at times breaking his own clich and actually becoming quite fun.

The fight sequences, especially the one pitting Chan against Li is something to be experienced and the skill of the two is just astounding. It's genuinely hard to believe that, Jet Li at 45 and Chan at 54 can still pull off some of the amazing moves that they did at the start of their careers. It's by no means a bad movie, but it's one only for those that are fans of both Li's and Chan's previous work. I wouldn't say it's quite suitable for the whole family as there is quite a big of graphic violence in it. That being said, as long as a responsible parent is making the decision, then I have no doubt this can be enjoyed by the whole family anyway.",1219622400,2,3387,4.361331220285262
3108172,3,B0013FZUQK,"As I watched this movie, I had a feeling that I was watching an Eastern version of THE NEVER ENDING STORY. You know the story:  the unpopular kid who is bullied and took refuge in his books. Except with this, we have a much older kid who is obsessed with Kung Fu films. In this movie, East meets west when Jason, a geeky teenager from Boston's south side is transported to ancient China. Jason (Michael Angarano) is magically transported into another realm charged with returning a magical staff to its rightful owner.  It wasn't until after he wakes up in Ancient China that he finds out who that rightful owner is.

And here comes trouble...

Enter a group of marauding warriors and cue the drunken master Lu Yuan (Jackie Chan).  And yes, he speaks English too!  Jason is rescued and over a cup of tea, Jason learns from Lu Yuan that the staff belonged to the Monkey King (Jet Li). Now the cheeky Monkey King was tricked by the Jade Warlord (Colin Chou) who subsequently encased him in carbonite. The only way to undo the damage was through the return of the magical staff. Trouble continues to follow Jason and soon they acquire a third member, Sparrow Girl (Yifei Liu).  Now Sparrow is a likeable enough character and has some impressive Kung Fu skills of her own. Really, it would be heartless not to feel compassion for this orphaned adolescent even though she likes to refer to herself in the third person.  Later, a fourth member comes along in the form of the Silent Monk (also played by Jet Li) and the party is completed (much like THE WIZARD OF OZ).

And the fighting starts...

Viewers are entertained by several minutes of fight scenes between Chan and Li.  Who comes out on top? It doesn't matter because these two are simply getting to know each other.  Truly, what better way to capitalize on these two Kung Fu stars than by pitting them against each other and letting the film capture as much of this once in a lifetime chance of getting these two Masters together in the same movie. Indeed, this is a real fete for Hollywood for they have achieved what the Hong Kong cinema wasn't able to do and history is made.

THE FORBIDDEN KINGDOM doesn't require much of your brain to be enjoyed. The plot is simple and caters more for kids, but grown-ups certainly would find much to enjoy here. I certainly did. Woo Ping Yuen (who also choreographed the Matrix, Kill Bill and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) does not disappoint in this film and provides most of the fun as we see Jackie Chan and Jet Li try to beat the hell out of each other. It is not original; in fact, we are also reminded of another of Chan's best movies DRUNKEN MASTER. In this, Chan plays the Master and Angarano the student. Anyone who has seen that movie would agree that it is almost a copycat.  However, all in all, Rob Minkoff (Stuart Little, Lion King) does a good job of keeping things plotting along enough to provide viewers with an entertaining form of escaping from the daily grind.",1219536000,6,2976,4.527985074626866
3108183,2,B0013FZUQK,"Okay- take the Movie's core as it is- the Jackie Chan and Jet Li part. Fine Kung Fu flick. No problems with that. Then- mix in an almost laughable combo of Never Ending Story with Karate Kid. I guess if I were 12 or 13 this would be fine- I wouldn't know it's a knock off, but being a child of the 80's this movie was painful to sit through. And I can't see why they did it- the movie would have been fine without this terrible sub-plot line of 'the boy who gets bullied by the meanies at school and then gets transported to a magic world to learn Kung Fu and save a world from the evil... blah blah blah'.

If it comes on HBO- watch it for free- but if you're over 28... don't get creeped out by thinking you've seen this movie before. But better.",1219190400,2,748,4.02013422818792
3108184,3,B0013FZUQK,"With anyone but Jackie Chan and Jet Li, this film would be forgettable.  The story and the production blend elements of Journey to the West, Narnia, and Lord of the Rings in an unremarkable western take on wuxia, the traditional Chinese marital arts drama.  Apparently first developed as a bed-time story for the American screenwriter's son, the plot has a certain unaffected charm that manages to shine through the film's over-polished veneer and poor choices in casting.  No one could possibly believe that such slight, rail-thin women could put a whipping on anything but a salad bar, and it's hard to work-up any sympathy for Michael Angarano as the point-of-view character, who with his sad hang-dog face and whiny demeanor fairly invites the bullying thats heaped on him.  His transformation from a pasty wimp unlikely to fight his way out of a room of kindergarteners into a kung-fu warrior is embarrassingly laughable.

Ultimately it's Jet and Jackie that make this a film worth watching.  Their fluid movement and comedic timing leave the other fighters looking clumsy and overly earnest.  The highlight of the film is the pair's extended fight scene, an amazing pairing of talents not likely to be seen elsewhere in martial arts cinema for some time to come.  See it now while you can, but be prepared for lots of incredulous eyeball rolling and spot-the-Rings-and-Narnia-references.

3108185,4,B0013FZUQK,"The idea of making a martial arts film starring Jackie Chan and Jet Li, directed by Rob Minkoff (""Stuart Little,"" its first sequel and ""The Haunted Mansion"") may not appeal to you very much. It is only natural that you become skeptical of its success if you still remember the disappointing Hollywood-made actions like ""Rush Hour 3"" or ""The One."" Surprisingly, however, ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" turned out a very entertaining film with nice actions and some interesting characters.

An avid American kung-fu film fan Jason (Michael Angarano) is magically transported to a fantasy world where his martial arts skills and courage are tested through a series of thrilling adventures. In this land where ruthless Jade Warlord (Colin Chou) reigns, the South Boston boy meets perpetually drunk Lu Yan (Jackie Chan) one of the legendary ""Eight Immortals,"" who is actually a great kung fu master. With Lu Yan, mysterious ""Silent Monk"" (Jet Li) and an orphaned girl ""Golden Sparrow"" (Yifei Liu), Jason sets out a long journey to fulfill the mission for which he was sent there.

You know this is a formula that has been used so many times before and it works amazingly well once the film gets into gear in the mid-section, showing the actions. Jackie Chan and Jet Li show orthodox-style kung fu fights (choreographed by Yuen Woo Ping) which are great fun to see. (And remember, Jackie Chan is 54 years old!) Michael Angarano playing a rather thankless role is also very good, but the most memorable is Bingbing Li, playing a white-haired villainess Ni Chang (her character most recently filmed in Ronny Yu-directed ""The Bride with White Hair"" with Brigitte Lin).

There are many references to kung-fun films including Jackie Chan's classic ""Drunken Monkey"" or Shaw Brothers films and Chinese culture in general. The most notable one is of course the famous Chinese epic story ""'Journey to the West"" and The Monkey King, also played by very comical Jet Li. Jet Li playing the double roles might look strange at first, but it is actually a nice idea to wrap up the story.

Sure, some CG images look a bit cheesy and let's face it, this collaboration of Jet Li and Jackie Chan should have been released ten years earlier. Still the fact that ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" offer lots of fun doesn't change at all. Enjoy it.",1218326400,2,2303,4.86734693877551

The Monkey King, one of the most popular figures in Asian believing and myths and his brief description in this movie correspond roughly to the venerated Idol. Jacky Chan and Jet Li making an astonishing duo and with these guys you really get ""martial art"" at top level. The movie is a tale, the tale is well told and the actors are great.

3108188,4,B0013FZUQK,"Jet Li and Jackie Chan: two of Hong Kong's most renowned superstars. Who would win in a fight? Who's faster and more agile?  This question has been in every Martial Arts fans' mind and this project has been a long time in the making, Asian film fans have all but given up on the idea after the little melee in 1995 called ""High Risk"" wherein Li would play a bodyguard to Chan. It was said that Chan turned down the project because of his character's lack of creative depth, while someone I know who worked with him said it was Li who didn't want to work with Chan. Chan attempted to break into the Hollywood fold via ""The Big Brawl"" but it wasn`t really until ""Rumble in the Bronx"" and ""Rush Hour"" did he really get noticed. Jet Li stole the show in ""Lethal Weapon 4"" and enjoyed ""Kiss of the Dragon`s"" box-office success. Those projects were about ten years ago. ""FORBIDDEN KINGDOM"" may not be the best film to have them show their stuff and the two may have their best roles behind them, but hey, they can still duke it out like no one else.

Jason is a young man who is very obsessed with Asian Martial arts films. Most of the time, he spends his time in a pawnshop owned by a kindly old man in the hunt for rare Asian Films. One day, he crosses paths with a gang of bullies who intend to rob the old man. The old man asks Jason to take the staff away from all the chaos and as if by some stroke of fate, Jason find himself in another world, another time. A mystical world ruled by the evil Jade warlord (Collin Chou) who wants the very staff given him by the old man in the pawnshop. Supposedly the staff is the key to power in the kingdom and must be returned to its rightful owner; the Monkey King. He meets up with a drunken man named Lu Yan (Jackie Chan), a pretty young woman bent on vengeance named ""Golden Sparrow"" (Crystal Liu Yifei) and a stoic monk (Jet Li). Together they challenge the forces of the warlord led by a lovely silver-mane woman named Ni Chang ( Li Bing Bing, Dragon Heat) or perish in the attempt--

The film may be America's tribute to Asian cinema and surprisingly, the film is directed by Rob Minkoff; yes, the same director who gave us Disney's ""Haunted Mansion"". No big-shot Hong Kong director takes the helm but an American director. Don't worry, at least the filmmakers were smart enough to get the services of a legendary Martial Arts director; Yuen Woo-Ping. The film has a lot of references to Asian cinema, quite a lot that would put even Tarantino to shame. Ni Chang is lovely and looks like a tribute to the Wuxia epic; ""Bride with White Hair"". While Golden Sparrow is a tribute to Cheng Pei Pei's ""Golden Swallow""; she even quotes ""Come Drink with me"", a Cheng Pei Pei film. The bamboo forest looks reminiscent to ""A Touch of Zen"" and ""House of flying Daggers"". Scenes of ""A Monkey goes West"" is even seen in Jason's Television screen. I was ready to bash this film until I saw it for what it was; an American-kid's tribute to Hong Kong cinema. Someone who loves Chan and Li, who would give Asian cinema the respect it deserves. The filmmakers had good intentions and as an Asian film fan, I applaud them for their ambition.

The film's showstopper lies in its hyper-kinetic action sequences. Yuen Woo-Ping (also responsible for Kill Bill, Kung Fu Hustle) knows his stuff and it is no surprise that he is Asia's premier fight choreographer. The fight between Chan and Li was fairly long and the film's main draw. Sure, the intensity isn't as hard-hitting as the climactic battles in ""Legend of Drunken Master"" and ""Fist of Legend"" but nonetheless, it was still masterfully done. Use of ""wire fu"" is obvious and the fight was well-executed and cleverly choreographed. It was very ""family-friendly"" as was its intention. The battles with Collin Chou (Donnie Yen's opponent in FlashPoint) was more bloody than the other fights but it still maintained its limits. There are quite a decent number of fight sequences that die-hard fans of Martial Arts films will be at home.

The performances are good for the most part; Li's performance isn't on his ""The Warlords"" caliber but it'll do as the quiet(?) monk. Chan's character is more witty and sharp-tongued. Chan's humorous appeal helps the film's pace and assists the scenes without any exciting action. Collin Chou's Jade warlord seemed a bit too underwhelming as the villain (the mascara has to go). However, his aid, Ni Chang (Played by Li Bing Bing) is so lovely that she eats up the screen with her whip-wielding, white-haired charisma that will undoubtedly strike a familiar image to Asian cinema fan boys. Sparrow may be the epitome of the ultimate Asian-woman; she has that intensity but maintains a girl next door look. Michael Angarano plays Jason; he may look very  awkward at first but his character grew on me after awhile.

""Forbidden Kingdom"" does have its share of problems but somehow, it overshadows them. The Yuen Woo-Ping directed fight sequences is the film's main strength, along with Jackie Chan's humorous appeal and it doesn't hurt to have Jet Li around either. The film is a bit too family-friendly for my tastes but thankfully, the filmmakers made it work. The plot is a bit too simple but it knew exactly what it wanted to do. Its execution may be lacking at times but the appearance of the classic ""Golden Sparrow"" and ""Ni Chang"" characters with Chan's character reminiscent of his ""Drunken Master"" days and Jet Li as a monk, reminiscent of Shaolin Temple; the film is an enjoyable affair. I give the American filmmakers credit where its due; they managed to get these two superstars together--something HK cinema wasn't really able to do.

3108191,4,B0013FZUQK,"Pop........POP.... POPOPOPOPOPOPOPOPOP!

Ok take that popcorn out of the microwave, grab your cola, and set the lights down low and get ready for some kung-fu action.

At first glance, the movie seems to be full oh wired choreographed fight scenes which I pretty much loathe. But the movie took the scenes and made them `ok'. It was like it was telling us ""Yes, we know you know it's wires, but you and we are ok with it"". And I was. It starts with The Monkey King kicking some butt up on top of a fake looking mountain top, and then *poof* we find out that it was all but a dream. Jason Tripitikas wakes up and heads to his favorite pawn shop down in Chinatown to pick up some more kung-fu movies. As Jason is heading out of Chinatown, he gets stopped by some local thugs/bullies. They make fun of him about his kung-fu movies and then show him some of their own fighting style. After the beat down they tell him to take them to the pawn shop so they can rob the place. The old man, knowing a few moves himself, takes it to them, but only cheated out of the grace of fighting like a man, by a single bullet. Jason runs from the thugs with a staff that the old man hands him. As Jason tries to get away, he falls and lands...

...in a different world in a different time. He comes across a man named Lu Yan (Chan) who tells him about his staff. That it once belonged to powerful man named The Monkey King. The Monkey King was tricked into a non fair fight and before the King was imprisoned he sent his staff away so that someone could come rescue him with it. They assume it's Jason, but is it? As they travel to where the Monkey King is imprisoned they come across Golden Sparrow. A girl seeking revenge for her family's death. They also come across The Silent Monk (Li), who is also on a mission to free the Monkey King. With their journeys intertwined, we can only hope for some sweet Kung-Fu action. And boy do we get it.

Jackie Chan vs. Jet Li was truly fun to watch. We all know it could've been MUCH better if they were probably 10 or 15 years younger than they are, but come on, it was still a great fight scene. Praying Mantis, Snake, Tiger, Crane, all types of Kung-Fu was used. It was definitely something to witness.

The Monkey King vs. The Jade Emperor, even though CGI enhanced and wire enhanced, was pretty awesome. It made the fact that they were godlike characters more believable. The CG used for this was spectacular and looked close to being real.

And there were many more scenes where Lu Yan, The Silent Monk, the Golden Sparrow are fighting all types of people. You won't be bored with a lack of Kung-Fu.

I also liked how there was a white haired woman bounty hunter after them. When she fought her hair became part of arsenal along with a whip she carried. Now I've seen some Kung-Fu flicks with people using their long hair before and the way it seems fake, always made it great. In this movie, when she starts to whip her hair around, it's CG looking (but once again this does not hurt it), until it hits the person. For instance on one scene it's got Lu Yan grabbing her hair and looks totally fake, but at the same time amazing. It felt like a throwback to some of the older movies. Man I loved it.

Some people are complaining that this was too kiddy. Well, I can see where they are coming from because there isn't a deep story here. It did feel like it was more geared towards a `not really having to think about it' crowd. And you know what. GOOD. I don't always have to think about stuff when I'm watching a good action flick. I actually had a blast watching this because I think if it took itself to seriously, most of the fight scenes would have been `eye rolling' instead of fantastic.

In the end I would say grab this movie up as soon as you can and sit the kids down with a large Papa Johns pizza and have a fun time.

P.S.  The way the story was set up, with the kid going from reality into an almost storybook tale, to come back into reality with things he learned... it sort of makes me think of The Never Ending Story but with Kung-Fu instead of a gigantic flying dog.",1210118400,54,4114,4.23469387755102

""The Forbidden Kingdom"" plays more like a Jackie Chan film than a Jet Li film.  The tone is light and it is a bit on the hokey side.  Those looking for an epic matchup between Chan and Li will be sorely disappointed.  As a family film it works fairly well, illustrating Jason's struggle for inner strength and confidence.

Jackie Chan and Jet Li though do their best work in an American film. I hear that Chan wants to work with Chris Tucker again but not in a Rush Hour movie. He's better off staying far away from him though and just making another movie like this. The kid in the movie is likeable too I should add. It's the action besides the acting that makes the movie entertaining.

  It doesn't disapoint with it's fight scenes like a lot of films do. You get a long but entertaining fight between Jackie Chan and Jet Li at one point where their basically just trying each other out.

3108204,5,B0013FZUQK,"You can't please everyone.  Jackie Chan knows this quite well as the East-West Culture Clash demonstrates itself with each of his movies released.  Jackie didn't have high expectations for this movie either, as it was tailored to the American audience.  He may have a point.

As it is, I can say that this film is a great family action flick.  It's directed by Rob Minkoff, who gave us The Lion King and the Stuart Little flicks, so he knows how to make a strong family film.  The story is very loosely based on the Chinese classic Journey To The West with snippet add-ons from other old kung-fu films, the most obvious being the Bride with White Hair.

The story has our main character, played by Michael Angarano, suffering a combination of near-death experience & time travel back to Ancient China to help return a magical staff to the legendary Monkey King.

It COULD be a time travel story as he is in Ancient China and is magically gifted with the ability to speak Chinese, as he can understand it only after encountering Jackie Chan's Drunken Immortal character.

It COULD be a near-death experience as the costuming and art style of the setting & characters is a bit more ""cleaner"" and stylized than I've seen in other old-period movies.  This would imply it's the main character's interpretation of Ancient China.  The White-Haired Assassin looks to me to be an obvious take on the Bride With White Hair.  Little things like American money in Ancient China and words of wisdom given are from other kung-fu films and martial art greats.

The meeting of Jackie & Jet Li works out very well.  Although wire-work is now becoming a normal staple in a lot of martial arts films, Jackie's reputation for not using it in his fight sequences are still in effect.  The wire-work is there for some stunts for the story - Jackie jumps over armed soldiers as he plays an immortal/god/buddha - but all his fights are solidly on the ground and very well done, especially with Jet Li.  Jet Li, on the other hand, has little qualms about using wires as it's reflected on his character - the opening fight moves has a sitting Jet Li stopping Jackie from taking the staff with BOTH legs grabbing onto it.  How was Jet Li sitting on the ground?  It was out-of-frame!  Nevertheless, the fight still remains spectacular.

The film overall can be regarded as a kung-fu fantasy and a better made one than a lot of others over the years.  I suspect the Asian market may not care for it, as America-Asia films cross the cultural border very poorly - Disney's Mulan going to mainland China comes to mind, as well as Jackie's Drunken Master 2 coming to America.  And Drunken Master 2 is my favorite!

Don't be too hard on the type of movie that Jackie & Jet agreed upon to star together in.  It appeals to the broadest amount of people, children in particular, and showcases them in their best light.  Besides, can you see them doing a Lethal Weapon remake?  Star Wars?  The Godfather?  This movie has my best vote!",1208908800,2,2996,4.60188679245283
3108205,4,B0013FZUQK,"I have a confession to make: I'm new to the gravity-defying martial arts genre. I've never seen ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or ""House of Flying Daggers"" or ""Fearless"" or any of the old standards starring Bruce Lee. Heck, I've never even seen anything starring Jackie Chan and Jet Li. So it's quite possible that I'm ill suited to review ""The Forbidden Kingdom,"" a movie that blends martial arts with family-friendly comedy and lots of cool special effects. I will say that the film generally achieved what it wanted to achieve, and I was certainly entertained all throughout. I'll also say that the story is a watered-down retread of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" about as light and airy as a flying Kung Fu master. But I guess story isn't important here; it's all about choreographed action sequences and how many can be crammed into place.

The film is book-ended by present day sequences taking place in Boston, where young Jason Tripitikas (Michael Angarano) lives for Hong Kong martial arts movies. That's essentially all we know about him, which is kind of annoying. The best we're given in terms of development is that he lives with his (unseen) mother and never knew whom his father was. Be that as it may, the film begins with Jason visiting a thrift store owned by Old Hop (Chan), a man who looks about as ancient as China itself. After looking through a stash of bootlegged Asian DVDs, Jason wanders into a back room and notices an ornate golden staff, which, according to Hop, was in the store when his grandfather opened it 100 years ago. Apparently, someone special will one day enter the store and reclaim the staff.

After Jason leaves, he's bullied by a group of thugs into getting them into Hop's store. Their robbery attempt goes wrong, and Jason grabs the staff before being chased to the roof; the thugs don't have a chance to kill him because the staff magically transports him to Ancient China, where he wakes up dressed as a monk. He walks around in confusion, not knowing where he is or how he got there, and what's worse, he doesn't speak any of the Chinese dialect everyone else is speaking. That problem is conveniently solved as soon as he meets Lu Yan (also played by Chan), who saves Jason from a group of warriors trying to take the staff: when Jason says, ""I can't understand what you're saying,"" Lu replies in English, ""That's because you're not listening!"" From then on, absolutely everyone is able to speak fluent English.

Lu--a drunken immortal who downs jug after jug of wine (supposedly an elixir)--tells Jason of an old prophecy: a traveler will deliver the staff to the Monkey King (Jet Li), a mischievous immortal who sent it away when another immortal--the warlord of the evil Jade Army (Collin Chou)--challenged him to a duel and deceived him. As protection, the Monkey King encased himself in stone over 500 years earlier, and it's there that he awaits the return of his staff. The only one who can free him is Jason, but in order for that to happen, he must learn the ways of Kung Fu. Only when he accomplishes his given task can he return to his own time and place.

They soon meet Golden Sparrow (Liu Ye Fei), an orphaned young woman who refers to herself in the third person and has a vendetta against the Jade Warlord. They also meet the Silent Monk (also played by Jet Li), who has apparently been seeking the seeker for quite some time. As they all travel across China to the fabled Five Elements Mountain, both the Lu and the Silent Monk take it upon themselves to teach Jason the art of Kung Fu, which will be a long and arduous process. Unfortunately, the Jade Warlord has learned of their plans and sends a bounty hunter to retrieve the staff; here enters Ni-Chang (Li Bing Bing), a nimble assassin who's deadly with a whip and even deadlier with her long, white hair. Should she succeed, the Jade Warlord has promised her a powerful elixir that can bestow immortality.

I've been describing the specifics of the story, but make no mistake--""The Forbidden Kingdom"" is all about the fight scenes, which are initially spread evenly but become wall-to-wall by the time we reach the climactic final battle. Each fight is beautifully choreographed and a lot of fun to watch, so much so that the story felt more like an afterthought. The same can be said for the sense of humor, which is certainly not necessary despite being a pleasant distraction. I obviously can't say that martial arts films are supposed to work this way, since this is the first one I've ever seen.

Still, I have a feeling that director Rob Minkoff was intentionally aiming for something less substantive and more entertaining, which in this case is not a criticism; at times, we actively seek escapist films like ""The Forbidden Kingdom,"" and I think Minkoff knew that all along. But as I said at the beginning, I may be out of my league here. As someone who has never experienced the visual splendors of a martial arts film, I don't know if ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" is better or worse than anything that came before it. Then again, comparisons are rarely useful for reviewing a movie--one should judge it on its own terms. On that note, I'll say that ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" is good-looking movie with lots of enjoyable stunts and an insubstantial story. That's pretty much what I expected going into it, so I have to give credit where credit is due.",1208822400,2,5369,4.6761904761904765

3108207,5,B0013FZUQK,"Jet Li and Jackie Chan have finally managed to accomplish what fans have been craving for years: the two martial arts superstars together in one super martial arts epic.

This movie was fantastic.  I have been a fan of kung fu cinema for most of my life, long before Jackie Chan and Jet Li became widely known in the western world, and like most martial arts movie fans I have long dreamt of a teaming up between these two kung fu greats.  This movie did not disappoint.

The tale that weaves through ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" is a fantastical and light-hearted love letter to many Chinese legends and martial arts movie traditions.  (The story is very loosely based on the classic Chinese epic ""Journey to the West"").  I absolutely loved it.

Jackie Chan and Jet Li give great acting performances as usual.  What surprised me was how good the fight scenes were despite the light-hearted nature of the film.  The major fight scene between Li and Chan was lengthy and magnificent.  The two friends genuinely seem to enjoy interacting with one another on a physical, as well as dramatic level.

This movie is so much fun.  Not nearly as serious as some of the two kung fu masters' previous movies.  I initially was a little bit worried about the apparent family-friendly nature of the film but it turns out all my worries were unfounded.  I think the levity and light-hearted nature of the film actually works in its favor and in hindsight seems to be the perfect choice for a first film bringing these two superstars together.

All in all this was one of the funnest, most action packed and exciting martial arts movies I have seen in a long time.",1208736000,2,1644,4.620689655172414
3108208,4,B0013FZUQK,"After reading a brief synopsis of the film with the film I knew not to go into the film with high expectations.  Fortunately (or unfortunately) the film was much pretty much what I had envisioned with a few notable exceptions.  Much halloo has been made of the fact that this is the first film with Jackie Chan and Jet Li.  Both have become international superstars, both have an excellent repertoire with martial arts, both have played Wong Fei Hung (Jackie Chan in Drunken Master (1978) and Jet Li in Once Upon A Time In China (1991)), but neither have the ever appeared in a film together.  The reasons are sundry and probably have to do with past egos, but better late than never (Spielberg, it is not too late to hire either one of these actors).  Though imagine what could have been made in the late 80s with these two.

What had me most concerned with this film was that it is centered on a milquetoast Hong Kong Shaw Brother's film fanatic Jason Tripitikas (Michael Angarano: Sky High (2005)) who spends his time buying bootleg VCD/DVDs in Chinatown and being bullied by weenie local thugs.  Though this might hit the demographic of many martial art film fans, I was ambivalent about its use of a focal point away from Jackie or Jet.  Both of these actors can carry a film and the insertion of Tripitikas felt superfluous and relegated this movie to young teen-movie status.  His performance was OK though, just nothing that special.

Tripitikas visits his normal Chinatown shop (mentioning Ten Tigers from Kuangtung (1980)) owned by a raspy voiced Old Hop (Jackie Chan in old-man makeup; thank god he did not become a Mr. Miyagi clone) and notices an exquisite staff.  Old Hop states that he is waiting to return it to its rightful owner.  Later, Jason acquiesces to the gang (about as scary as The Backstreet Boys) and helps them rob Hop.  Things go badly as Hop gets shot and just as Jason is about to die he gets transported into a different realm (through the gate with no gate).

Luckily, this is where the story gets more interesting partially because less emphasis is put on the teen and more on the environment and new characters.  Jason meets Lu Yan (Jackie Chan: though this character is more like the King of Beggars aka Beggar So played most famous by Simon Yuen in Drunken Master (1978)) whose uses drunken kung fu.  Jason learns that he must return the staff to free the Monkey King (Jet Li) who was tricked into being turned to stone by the Jade War Lord (Ngai Sing:  Fearless, Flash Point (2007)) and caused 500 years of unhappiness under his realm.  However, there is a prophecy of an outsider who will return the staff and restore order (yes a chosen one, guess who that is). Ultimately, the chosen one team up with Golden Swallow (Liu Yi-Fei: yes the same name as the character in Come Drink with Me) who is also out for revenge against Jade War Lord who ruthless killed her family and a wandering monk (Jet Li).

I enjoyed the film for what is was.  A nondescript lead does not help with the film as a whole, but there is much to like.  The action choreography of Yuen Woo-ping (Hero, Drunken Master) is quite good partially because he has worked before with Jet Li and Jackie Chan.  He knows exactly their aging limitations and makes the wire-work look beautiful.  The fight scene between Jackie and Jet is a must watch for action fans and exquisitely beautiful.  When comedy was applied it worked well.  Two of these scenes stood out for me and had the audience laughing with my favorite of the two is when Jackie and Jet used Jason as an unwilling puppet while both masters trying to teach him gung fu.  It is nice seeing Jet Li have a fun time with his characters.  The other highlight of the movie is the penultimate fight scene between just about everybody including the Monkey King and a very pissed off hired killer -- the White Haired Assassin (Lee Bing-Bing) She is an homage to The Bride With White Hair (1993) which is also mentioned earlier in the film.

The film is a hodge-podge of Asian stories with the main plot is taken from the Ming Dynasty story ""Journey to the West"" (published anonymously and is foretold with an showing early in the film of, I believe but not positive since I was partially distracted at the time, Cave of the Silken Web (1967)) and put in a Wizard of Oz (1939) outline.  There are some problems with the cohesion of the story, a nondescript lead and several plot problems exist, but it does not distract too much unless you are adamant about your adaptations being faithful.  Rob Minkoff's direction (Stuart Little (1999), Haunted Mansion (2003)) is good, but I would have liked a more action-oriented director helming this project.  I think most martial art film fanatics will be slightly disappointed by this film, but many will enjoy this movie for what it is - entertainment with a couple of excellent choreographed martial art scenes.

Let us hope that Jet Li and Jackie Chan get together again and get to be the main characters.

3108209,4,B0013FZUQK,"I am a hugh Jet Li and Jackie Chan fan. I love kung fu movies period! I couldn't wait to get to the movies to see this. I who never pay to see a movie and I always go with a date went by myself and paid to see this film.

The fight sceen between Jet Li and Jackie was really good but the dialog was awful!! I also have to add that the kid in this movie to me took away from the movie. Couldn't they have found someone better to play the part of the messenger? Is it me or did this kid suck big time?

All in all go see this movie if you are a fan like I am you'll be mad at yourself if you don't. Hopfully maybe Jet and Jackie may team up again.",1208736000,,645,3.6
3108210,4,B0013FZUQK,"While Jackie Chan and Jet Li seem like a no-brainer and the only question is ""What took so long?"", it took a lot to finally get these two together. After a thinly-veiled Jackie Chan ripoff character in one of Jet Li's earlier movies was taken as an insult by Chan, all talks of the two appearing together were killed. Now, over a decade later they are finally on screen together. The result? Not that bad, but not as good as it could have been.

For his age, Chan can still move. Unfortunately, his ""no wires"" policy is gone in recent films. Since this is sort of a period piece, you can understand that (most of these movies have the characters doing impossible things anyway). Both Chan and Li have dual roles in the movie (Chan doubles as the old man in the pawn shop and the drunken fighter, while Li is the Monkey King and the monk). And yes, there is a nice long fight scene between the two in the middle of the film. Plenty of action throughout, actually.

So why not give this a five-star rating? A couple of things. First, this would have been SO much better if it had been made ten years ago when both men were moving like lightning. Second, while I understand they both love period piece movies, they would have been so much cooler if they'd done this in a modern-time setting with no flying around...just good fighting. Imagine a type of sequel to Jet Li's ""The One"" where he plays both the hero and villain, and Jackie Chan helps him. Or better yet, have Chan play another hero and villain character, then let the good version of each fight the bad version of the other. That way we would have seen them win AND lose to both. As it stands in this film, there's no clear winner and that was obviously done on purpose so as not to hurt either's box office draw or ego.

Don't get me wrong, this movie isn't a waste of time to watch. It's a fun way to spend an afternoon with the family. As long as you understand this is like a Karate Kid/Princess Bride crossover with kid appeal. Hopefully this will open the door for a future team-up and they'll take it to the next level.",1208736000,,2085,4.313775510204081
3108211,5,B0013FZUQK,"What can one say after watching a movie like this, except ""Awesome"".  From the beginning, you really don't know what to think, except for the fact that you recognize Jackie Chan as an old man in the shop.  You know that the kid getting bullied will have something to do with 'getting revenge' as it is with most kung fu movies.  Naturally, the real winners of the movie is Jet and Jackie with their legendary 'on screen' presence and their supernatural martial arts skills.  The story and the entire feel of the movie is done with a 'Lord of the Rings' like feel especially with the 'White Haired Witch' and the way the Jade Warlord dies in the end.  Overall, the entire movie, regardless of all of the magical screenplay, is a tribute to the martial arts and the greatness (and the danger) that can come from it.

Additional Note to Parent's:

The development of the boy's skills in the martial arts and what it does to empower him ever-so-increasingy throughout the movie is a testament to the true spirit of the martial arts and how it truly exists in real-life applications.  With that said, I believe that the youth who watch this movie will have a newfound inspiration to train in the martial arts, and only hope that there will be a proper teacher with enough wisdom and knowledge to guide with the right intention at the receiving end of that spectrum.",1208649600,,1360,4.567901234567901
3108212,4,B0013FZUQK,"So the commercials all promote Jackie Chan and Jet Li. What they neglect to do is mention, I dunno, the **main character** of the film, a young Boston kid named Jason Tripitikas (played by Michael Anganaro).

So the movie's basically a kid film. You have a reluctant hero who gets sent to a fantasy version of China, and along the way he learns martial arts and Eastern philosophy.

What did I like about it? The fight scenes are, for the most part, fantastic. They start off a little weak, get better over time, and then get absolutely fantastic when you have both Jet Li and Jackie Chan in the film. The fight scenes are weakest when there's too much CGI in them -- but most of them are purely physical, and quite good.

The Chinese fantasy aspects are authentic, if not accurate (much in the same way the HBO series Rome is not a completely accurate recounting of events, but an authentic recreation of the tone of ancient Rome). They throw in things like The Monkey King and his golden staff, soldier monks, drunken immortals and even The Bride With White Hair. And the Chinese philosophy, for those familiar with it, is spot on.

Jackie Chan and Jet Li are fantastic not only as fighters, but comedically as well. (There's a scene involving rain that had absolutely everyone in the theater laughing hard.) Anganaro puts in a surprising turn physically -- he looks like he got a lot of martial training. Yifei Liu is heartbreakingly lovely.

It's probably a little scary for young kids -- there is some intense violence in the beginning, for instance. And there are sappy moments, as you would expect for a kid's film. But it means well. I have to say that I had a bit of trouble making out the English of some of the Chinese actors sometimes, tho -- and I'm Chinese-American! I worry others might have even worse problems.

Still, overall, I liked it.",1208649600,77,1856,4.575301204819277

A collaboration between two superstars in their field - Jackie Chan and Jet Li - a charming story based on an ancient Chinese legend of The Monkey King, (played in flashback by Jet Li) who loses his golden staff - and is encased in stone until the staff is returned. It is a story based on one of the great epic stories of China, and a story added in of a Western young man obsessed with Kung Fu and buys old tapes from an old Chinese pawnshop, who ends up with the staff.
Actions follow and the young man, Jason, played by Michael Angarano, is hurtled back in time to the time of legends where the Monkey King is imprisoned in stone and the Jade Emperor and other meanies run havoc among the people.
Jason, with the legendary Monkey King's staff, wanders around and finally meets Lu Yan, a drunken immortal (Jackie Chan) and then meets up with The Silent Monk (Jet Li), and a beautiful maiden, Golden Sparrow,(Yifel Liu) who is a warrior/musician.
The two men set out to train Jason for his quest to go to fulfill his destiny of returning the golden shaft to the Monkey King.
At first they butt heads each trying to train Jason in their disciplines. Finally, they make a pact to work together and train the boy with both their knowledge -
They begin their journey toward the Monkey King.
The fight scenes are classically done - the staging of them is in rapid fire and so beautifully 'choreographed' you will not want to blink your eyes. Defying gravity, delighting in the pleasure of watching the best of the craft before you on screen. It just doesn't get much better.
Jackie Chan and Jet Li are magic together - Both charismatic, both masters of the story of battle.
I saw this movie with new eyes as I am beginning my journey into studying screenwriting, and cinematography. I marveled at the filming process, and the beauty of the land. And the ease that we are put there in the action.
I am amazed that East and West blended in this charming story of the Monkey King, and brought us back to Boston, where end ending is as magical as the beginning.
Great script, great cast. Beautifully filmed.

3341827,5,B0013FZUQK,"My first response to the film was ""WOW!""  ""Forbidden Kingdom"" opened with a fabulously staged fight scene atop a mountain. The Monkey King (Jet Li) was taking on a handful of enemies and wiping them out.

Next we move to Boston where Jason (Michael Angarano), a Chinaphile and kung fu fanatic discovers an ancient staff in a pawnshop where he buys kung fu movies from Hop (Chan). Hop tells him that the staff was left there for a messenger to claim the staff and return it to its rightful owner.  Jason tells Hop he's been dreaming about this staff.  Hop tells him he's been watching too many kung fu movies.

Next, some toughs force Jason to help them rob Hop's store.  In the attack, Hop's shot and Jason awakens from injuries to find himself in ancient China with the staff to recover to its rightful owner, the Monkey King, who's been imprisoned in stone by an evil warlord for 500 years.

Along the way, he meets Lu Yan (Chan) who is a drunken immortal, Golden Sparrow (Yifel Liu), an orphaned musician-warrior who's sworn vengeance on the warlord for killing both of her parents in a raid, and a silent monk (Jet Li again).

As they journey, Jason learns kung fu from both Lu Yan and the monk as well as discovering values critical to overcoming the warlord.

Scenery, fight scenes, music are gorgeous.  There are some hilarious moments in this film particularly when Lu Yan makes rain.

""Forbidden Kingdom"" is a film I'll certainly see again before it leaves the theatre as well as probably buying the DVD as soon as it comes out.  I love both Li and Chan and this, in my opinion, was one of the best of both of their impressive collection of films--and visually, just a stellar pleasure to watch.

My husband and I make a habit of seeing every Jackie Chan film so we saw The Forbidden Kingdom on opening night.

I'm sad that Jackie Chan has to make movies with kids and sidekicks [I'm not calling Jet Li a sidekick...] these days. I also find it incredibly weird when they speak English in ancient China. Also, we missed the outtakes that Jackie often has at the end of his movies. Ok, that's enough criticism.

3341831,5,B0013FZUQK,"This afternoon, I went to the movies at Jurong Point with my gym buddy.

We chose the movie, 'The Forbidden Kingdom', starring two of our favourite kungfu movie super-stars, Jackie Chan & Jet Li.

Since it was a 3.50pm show, & both of us were senior citizens, we were entitled to half-priced movie tickets, at S$4/- each. For once, we thoroughly enjoyed the privilege of being senior citizens.

The movie was sort of a fantasy story, even though it drew a myriad of characters out of Chinese folklore.

The opening scene started of with a nerdy American teenager, Jason (played by Michael Angarano), in Boston with an unquenchable thirst for kungfu classics.

As he visited his regular joint, a Chinese artefact shop, he was intrigued by a long golden shaft in the store. The shop owner, a blind old man (played by Jackie Chan), told him that the shaft was still waiting for the rightful owner to come & pick up, ever since he had inherited the shop from his grandfather.

The teenager then left the shop, but was confronted on the way & bashed up by a bunch of young neighbourhood hoodlums. They knew he had left the shop earlier & decided to rob the old man, using the teenager as bait for the old man to open the shop.

The old man was accidentally shot, & the scared teenager ran off with the shaft, with the hoodlums in hot pursuit.

In the next instance, the teenager was magically teleported into ancient China at about the time of the Jade Emperor. He then bumped into a shabby looking drunken beggar, Lu Yan (played by Jackie Chan), who told him a ridiculous story about the origin of the golden shaft.

In a nutshell, the golden shaft actually belonged to the Monkey God (played by Jet Li), from the 'Journey to the West', one of the four great epic novels of Chinese literature.

The Monkey God was unwittingly tricked into loosing the golden shaft while fighting the evil Jade Warlord.

The shaft then mysteriously disappeared for some 500 years, while the Monkey God was turned immediately into stone by the evil Jade Warlord.

Both of them then popped into a tea-house & were confronted by some soldiers from the evil Jade Warlord. A fight ensued, reminiscent of the 'Dragon (Gate) Inn' incident from several Chinese kungfu classics.

During the escape, they were helped by a young female warrior, known as Golden Sparrow. She was apparently looking for an opportunity to avenge the death of her parents at the hands of the evil Jade Warlord.

Then, this time three of them somehow got entangled with a monk, dressed in white robes, known as the Silent Monk (also played by Jet Li), who apparently had a life-long mission to locate the golden shaft.

What followed was a seemingly extended & masterfully choreographed fighting sequence (by the legendary Yuen Woo Ping as action director), between the characters of Jackie Chan & Jet Li.

Frankly, my gym buddy & I actually got our money's worth here.

We also got to see the two heroes reluctantly teaching the American teenager some Chinese kungfu routines. That was the most comical part of the movie, reminiscent of master-disciple scenes from 'The Karate Kid'.

This time, four of them decided to work together to search for the Temple of the Five Elements, in an attempt to locate the Monkey God & to return the golden shaft to him as well.

Meanwhile, the evil Jade Warlord got wind of their exploits.

He immediately sent a bounty hunter, a white-haired demoness - she looked & sounded more like a Chinese version of Jessica Alba - with a deadly whip, to retrieve the golden shaft.

The final segment of the movie was a really exciting one, when all hell broke loose as the three heroes/one heroine finally caught up in a ferocious battle with the evil Jade Warlord, together with the white hair demoness. (Many thanks again to Yuen Woo Ping!)

The Monkey God was finally resurrected with the return of the shaft, & he, too, took the final opportunity to beat up the evil Jade Warlord.

I must say, when come to combat sequences, unarmed or with weapons in hand, Jet Li was really good. Jackie Chan was not bad, too, although I noticed that he had lost some steam.

Again, my gym buddy & I got all our money's worth.

The ending of the movie was somewhat funny too. The teenager decided to return home - magically, of course. He bumped into the same bunch of hoodlums again. This time, to their chagrin, he really bashed them out properly.

On the whole, besides the intricate fighting sequences, I truly enjoyed watching the lavish settings, which included beautiful scenes of white cherry blossom trees, barren deserts, luscious bamboo forests, & stone cold temples. The cinematography was great, too.

My end analysis is this: if you want to watch Jackie Chan & Jet Li fighting each other, for once in a joint movie collaboration, go for it. You won't regret it.",1208476800,3,4836,4.665488810365136
3341832,2,B0013FZUQK,"How long have we waited to see Jackie Chan and Jet Li finally get pitted against one another on the big screen? How could their long-awaited collaboration be anything but smashingly sensational? The only way to embarrassingly shatter our images of Jackie Chan and Jet Li finally dueling (with a wide array of masterfully choreographed fight sequences) would be to put them in a fantastical Tolkienesque world, brimming with immortals, prophecies, CG-laden magic and time travel. So that's what The Forbidden Kingdom does.

Kung fu consumed American teen Jason Tripitikas (Michael Angarano) must travel back in time to reunite a golden staff with its rightful owner - the Monkey King. In his quest to bring order back to the ancient Chinese world he has teleported to, he is aided by Lu Yan (Jackie Chan), an immortal who uses wine and drunken fighting to gain the upper hand; Sparrow (Yifei Liu), a young female warrior whose parents were killed by the injurious ruler known as the Jade Warlord; and Silent Munk (Jet Li), a guardian who is also on a mission to retrieve the staff.

The Monkey King has been imprisoned in stone for 500 years, and his only hope of restoring peace to ancient China is to regain his legendary weapon. Jason undergoes numerous adventures during his journey to the Temple of the 5 Elements, where the immortal Jade Warlord resides with his massive army, including fighting off hundreds of soldiers, and a white-haired demoness with a deadly whip.

All of the colorful and chaotic characters in the film are based on Chinese mythology, adventure pulps, and classic kung fu movies, but the average viewer isn't going to notice. You would have to be as obsessed as the ambivalent main character to recognize the borrowed concepts from ancient Chinese legend and lore. What the average viewer will undoubtedly notice is the extreme goofiness of the story, all of the plot holes that typically accompany such fantasy fare, and the many quick zooms on ominous faces and statuesque martial arts stances. And perhaps question why Jason already knows how to ride a horse, or why a Jet Li/Jackie Chan movie actually stars a scrawny American boy.

Drenched in eye-rolling fantasy jargon (such as chi magic) and grossly stereotypical characters, the plot is somewhat reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz or Black Knight (the Martin Lawrence film) insomuch as the lead character journeys to a fantasy world designed to match an overactive imagination. Fueled by fanciful yearnings for adventure and excitement, Jason explores lavish settings, including a merciless desert, luscious rainforests, and humongous stone temples, where Woo-Ping Yuen's stunning fight choreography can look very impressive. In an unbelievable world, the fighting gets equally farfetched, and so wire-fu sequences tend to overtake realistic brawling, constantly breaking up the marvel of watching two legendary martial arts masters finally square off.

The costumes are divine, the snowy-haired Asian-Jessica-Alba demoness is an interesting nemesis, and comedic training montages are abundant, but The Forbidden Kingdom forgets to show us entertainment. Lu Yan remarks that to be remembered is true immortality - which makes it a crying shame that this pitiable film will probably be the only thing to remind us of Jackie Chan and Jet Li's only movie collaboration.

3341957,5,B0013FZUQK,"An absorbing adventure, based on Chinese mythology, that keeps you glued to the scene for its entire length. Beautiful scenery, engrossing action, mysterious persons, subtle humor, wisdom, and growth of the various characters in the course of the film all contribute to the experience. The plot focuses on an American teenager, who ""knows"" all about Gung fu and its associated mythologies until he is magically transported into that very world, which is filled with glory to be sure, but also contains its share of tragedy--a study in yin and yang.
What a treat to see Jackie Chan and Jet Li, both of them in double roles, work together onscreen, once more demonstrating their skill in their respective versions of martial arts! Jackie Chan continues with the deceptively relaxed style that his fans will always associate with ""The Legend of Drunken Master."" Similarly, once again we  see the incredible precision that is Jet Li's trademark. Relative newcomer at the time of filming, Liu Yifei, as the Golden Sparrow, fulfills all of our expectation in a demanding role covering a range of subtle emotions as well as a smooth agility in martial arts.
Early Chinese martial arts films followed the style of wu xia, in which the leading characters not only were experts at fighting, but also had magical skills. A mystical form of Daoist magic allowed them to fly short distances and perform other skills that go beyond any natural abilities. In the latter half of the twentieth century, films focused more on kung fu fighting skills, as demonstrated by Bruce Lee, Jet Li, Jackie Chan, and others. The 2000 film ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" signaled the return of wu xia, and ""Forbidden Kingdom"" has shown that the trend has been continuing.
The film is filled with characters out of Chinese mythology, e.g., the Jade Emperor and the Monkey King. Jackie Chan's Chinese character is one of the famous ""Eight Immortals"" of Chinese mythology, but his name, Lu Yan, though the name of a historical person, is not usually found among the group. His depiction seems to fit closest to Li Tie Guai, the old beggar with the crutch and the bottle of magic medicine, but he could also be one of the versions of Lan Cai He, the drunken derelict.",1473120000,14,2235,4.881578947368421

There were a few spots that were pretty funny though, and like with all their movies, the martial arts is exciting and fun to watch.

3342009,5,B0013FZUQK,"Here is a movie that has everything most people look for in an entertaining movie.  It has comedy, romance, mythology, suspense, an inspirational message and lots of martial arts action. It stars Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It centers on the myth of the Monkey King in ancient China.

Jason is a fan of Kung Fu movies and is harassed by some local bullies.  He finds himself somehow in ancient China and winds up with Jackie Chan who plays a drunken style Kung Fu master and their search for the Monkey King, played by Jet Li.

I never like to give away too much when reviewing a movie or a novel because it spoils it for anyone else who might want to see the film or read the book. I will emphasize that this is a pretty good movie which has everything we movie lovers look for entertainment.

If you are a fan of Jackie Chan and Jet Li you should check out this action packed DVD.

elements such as the Kung Fu masters, magic, super powers, the young ignorant
white kid soon to be an apprentice and then a Kung Fu fighter with a mission, and you
will be right.
Nothing special about the story. But what makes the movie really good is Jackie Chan
and Jet Li. Not that they learned how to speak clear English or that they are acting
like Shakespearean actors. Now, they are exactly like we have grown to love them.
Difficult to understand at times, funny, with great smiles, and GREAT martial arts
expertise. Thus, this movie is full of great fight choreography. This is a happy violent movie,
that is with no blood scenes and extreme killings. It is entertainment, and
you have 2 of the greatest martial arts movie performers.
So it is a fun movie to watch at all times, even with your kids, if they are not that
young that is",1436486400,,926,4.485207100591716

This also has the kid from Sky-High, 24 (Day 6), and the Lords of Dogtown, just to name a few, and while the whole idea behind it, where a kid finds a long lost magical staff and gets transported, somehow, back to middle ages China, and has to undergo a journey to return the staff back to it's rightful owner, learning martial arts in the process, while laughable at times, is still a better plot than some of the stuff being put out by Hollywood these days (Hello? Noah anyone?)...

Watching Jet Li and Jackie Chan during their fight sequences was enjoyable to watch, along with how they played off of each other in their normal scenes was a real treat to anyone who likes either person. Their styles, while completely different, made it look like they'd been working together to perfect their scenes for years.

For a style of movie which is normally prone to many jokes (mouth moving, no dialogue or the reverse) this movie was one that I will probably watch many times... The ending, while predictable, was still quite enjoyable to watch... I don't want to give anything away to those who haven't seen it, but if you're like me and can watch movies like Pacific Rim, Man of Steel, Battleship and more, over and over again, you'll probably like this one too...",1422835200,,1333,4.522821576763485

But I am very much into Chinese culture, food, scenery, etc. So I cannot speak to how good or bad of a martial arts film this is. Don't care. It was just great fun with a very Wizard of Ozian feel with a lost traveler in a foreign land, a band of misfits and an adventure to confront evil. The scenic shots of China are breathtaking and exotic, and the acting was solid. I always enjoy Michael Angarano in movies, whether comedy or drama, and he did an outstanding job here. If I have any complaints its that the front end build up could have been a little longer so that we were more familiar with Michael Angarano's character, Jason. We're sort of dropped into the fantastic quest within moments of the opening of the film. Would have been nice if this pivotal character could have been fleshed out more from the start.

3342217,5,B0013FZUQK,"Right now there are very few movies available about the Monkey King - Sun Wukong. This movie is a reflection of that 600 year old Chinese folk tale. But this isn't done like the new (2014) movie with Donnie Yen and Chow Yun Fat, where we get the whole book in one film. The plot is not the story of the Monkey King exactly and he doesn't even show up until the last 1/4 of the movie. But when he does appear, its actually very cool.

This movie begins in modern times and has a lot of the typical themes of bullies, old Chinese masters, mythology and magic. The plot has some great twists and goes deeper and deeper in Chinese mythology as the film progresses.  Regardless of the worn-out themes this is one incredible Gongvu movie and Jackie Chan and Jet Li and the supporting actors are amazing. The film is high quality with good, legible sub-titles and there is enough sword play, fighting, magic, demons and Chinese folk-tale here for a wide variety of folks.",1398643200,,964,4.440677966101695

Normally I'd review such a disaster as average (3-stars) but with the expectation from those two, and the resulting disappointment, I'm going to go with 1 star.  Blast me in the comment if you disagree.

Plot is mediocre.  I was *really* disappointed to have the Chinese dialogue subtitled as ""Chinese"" - I fully understand and agree with the mediocre Chinese reviews.

It would have been such a better movie (globally) to have the kid been Chinese.

His pathetic ""Michael J Fox"" impression grated on me the entire time, and I had no sympathy for the character at all.

3342227,5,B0013FZUQK,"I think Wu Cheng'en, the author of one of the four great classic works of China that is Hsi You Ji, Journey to the West in English, would be proud of the recent adaptations to his original story.  After all, he created it with all the concepts and understandings of his time 500 years ago, complete with all the fun 'National Enquirer' stuff that was going around in his day too.  I see nothing wrong with adapting such a great work to modern sensitivities, as long as it stays faithful to the original in spirit.

The obvious problems the producers had were obviously 1) how to get this story, already well known throughout Europe / Eurasia, through to an American audience very squeamish about Buddhism and China centered thought and 2) how to get Jackie and Jet into one movie, a feat never before accomplished. I think the fact that Jackie and Jet, two fantastic warriors who have picked up nicely where Bruce Lee left off, have agreed to do this film says a lot about their belief that it can indeed help break the American ice when it comes to the greatness of China.

The English and Australians in particular know of the original classic through the groundbreaking major television production done in Japan called Monkey Magic (Sai Yu Ki), a production which never made it to US TV screens. Many people in these countries grew up with this series as children and remain so fond of it today that they find it hard to take a look at more modern adaptations like The Forbidden Kingdom. The Japanese adaptation was and still is excellent, retaining all of the spirit and most of the scenarios from the original 500 year old book, with a good dose of erotic suggestions and hilarity added.  This and the all Japanese casting are probably some reasons it never made it to the US.

The Harry Potter films seem to be the first American produced, non American subject matter to feature all key roles played by native people and make such a huge US and worldwide profit.  Believe it, producers tried to get an American boy to play Harry but living author J.K.Rowling insisted to the point of withdrawing permission. The result? Not what most US businesses expected at all, the largest HP fan base in the world existing in the US.  This gives me hope that one day the great works of China, Japan and Korea will not need a prerequisite white American guy in the lead.

As for those of us who know and love the original Chinese classic Hsi You Ji,  we can revel in the performances of our main man Jackie, the Kowloon guy who has done so much for us worldwide, and Jet, another Kowloon guy who is just as determined.  We can enjoy the references to the great Hong Kong classic film Come Drink With Me. We can admire Michael Angarano, who really did a great job holding his own with all the cultural and actor heavyweights in this film.  We may not be happy with the film idea that all of Sun Wu Kong's power comes from his staff, but we can forgive that in exchange for having one of the great symbols of Sun Wu Kong impressed upon newbie viewers.

Finally, for those interested in getting to know the awesomeness of the original, Chicago University Professor Anthony C. Yu has done the first complete translation of Hsi You Ji in English, complete with notes to aid in understanding the various Chinese Taoist and Buddhist concepts of the day.  It's available here on Amazon, in four volumes so fair warning, it is not an easy/fast read nor is it a 'children's' read. It should be taken nice and slow, with plenty of time for introspection / reflection. Yes, it is that deep. It is great for a reason, and I highly recommend it.

I also recommend this movie, for it's great historical contribution to one of the world's greatest works of art as well as for it's wonderful entertainment value, including fantastic special effects and costumes.",1388448000,2,3838,4.558139534883721

Let me front load this by saying that I am not a fan of Jackie Chan.  Never have been.  So if my martial arts comedy standards may be a bit different from yours but I want to be perfectly honest about this.  After watching Chan's last movie The Forbidden Kingdom I can safely say I never will watch him willingly again.  I relented to watch after a 15 year fast from his last movie and was immediately sorry I had gone back on my word.

BO-RING.  Cheesy bad, all around insulting to kung fu fan's everywhere.  I figured if I fast forwarded to the fight scene with Li/Chan that I would at least feel like I didn't waste my money on this.  I figured wrong.  It was an exercise in annoyance.

It makes me wonder if all these reviews are fake.  I've always trusted Amazon.

3342378,5,B0013FZUQK,Had a lot of culture and left me wanting to see more. A lot more of the movies to follow this one.,1348531200,,98,3.5
3342379,5,B0013FZUQK,"When I picked this up at the library all I knew about it for sure was that it stared Jackie Chan and Jet Li. Being so completely unspoiled for it turned out to be a bad thing because frankly, the opening of the movie did not encourage me to want to spend the time to watch the rest.

We start with a really bad fight sequence in which a character in fantasy makeup leaps around mountain peaks while taking on a large group of opponents. The wire work is awful. There is no attempt to make it seem at all like the improbable leaps are the result of anything but a flying harness. Then it turns out to be a dream sequence and I'm willing to forgive it. Jason Tripitikas, the kid having the dream,  is completely obsessed with kung fu movies. His room is wallpapered in posters, stills, and cut outs from magazines. He feeds his addiction by buying bootleg videos from a pawn shop in China Town for a couple of dollars each.

We follow him there and meet the owner, and old man called Hop and see Jason accidentally discover that Hop has a beautiful golden staff in a back room. He explains that he is waiting for the rightful owner to return for it.

On Jason's way home he gets caught by the local high school tough guys who plan to force him to help them rob Hop's shop. Jason doesn't put up much resistance to them and this is the point where I hit pause so I could rant at the screen. This kid idolizes the kung fu movie heroes, the old man is a good friend, and he can't find the balls to stand up to these guys a little more? They shove him against a wall in a crowded public place and he doesn't even try to get away? This is where if it were a novel I'd be flipping through pages looking for something to see if it got better. It's hard to do that with a movie so I went to Wiki instead. Almost totally spoiled for what was to come I restarted the movie.

Something happens when they get to the shop that ends with Jason and the staff (which is magical of course) getting dropped into The Middle Kingdom.  Sort of manga/anime fantasy version of China where the evil Jade Warlord has been ruling for hundreds of years. The Monkey King had tried to oppose him but was defeated and turned to stone. The Monkey King's staff was flung away at the last moment so the Warlord couldn't get it and that is the staff that Jason has. Jason has to journey to the castle of the Jade Warlord and find a way to return the staff to the Monkey King in order to go home. If all goes well and the Warlord is defeated it will also allow the return of the Jade Emperor and the Middle Kingdom will be free from tyranny.

If you spend any time reading manga or watching anime you run into Journey to the West eventually. It's to Eastern storytelling what King Arthur or Robin Hood would be to a Western audience. Elements of it show up even in tales that aren't direct adaptations. If you're interested head over to Wiki and they'll give you an extensive plot synopsis. In this case they lifted characters from the tale and made use of the fantasy China setting.

The Wizard of Oz influence comes from the structure of the story. There is the framing sequence in the ""real"" world, a fantasy land that is more vibrant and beautiful than the place the protagonist comes from, and people and things that we see in the framing sequence are echoed in the fantasy world.

Once Jason falls into The Middle Kingdom things get good and stay good until nearly the end. Visually it's stunning. The scenery, both natural and CGI enhanced, is breathtaking. If the landscape porn isn't enough you need to see costume design. The robe the Jade Warlord wears at the end is worth the cost of a rental alone. The make up, particularly the Monkey King design, is really well done and the CGI is some of the best I've seen in a movie like this. I only realized it had to be CGI because there was no way they would have built some of the sets that lavishly for just a few minutes of film. The wire work and fight choreography when we get to actual fights outside of Jason's dreams are everything you'd expect from a film with Jet Li and Jackie Chan.

The story is a bit predictable but that's okay. There are some twists to add interest even if they keep to the expected structure.

Jackie Chan is Lu, who is essentially an older version of his Drunken Master character. I loved Drunken Master so I was a happy fangirl when I realized this. Jet Li is ""The Silent Monk"" who is really only totally silent during the bit where we first meet him and he has an extended fight scene with Jackie Chan that is amazing and funny and yet another element that's worth the rental just to see if you like kung fu movies even a little. Lu and the monk double team Jason to teach him kung fu before they reach the final confrontation so he has some small chance to survive. The middle part of the movie is has lots of Rocky and/or Karate Kid type training stuff and shows the budding romance between Jason and Sparrow, a beautiful young assassin with a vendetta against the Warlord.

Before Jason gets home there's an beautiful but evil kung fu fighting sorceress for Sparrow to fight, more scenery and costume porn, a temple of kung fu fighting monks, and near escapes. Once he gets home there is a sequence that had me yelling at the screen again for a few minutes but then it gets good AGAIN for the rest of the movie.

On the whole I really recommend this. It has nothing in it that's unsuitable for kids, in fact they should adore this.",1348099200,,5488,4.2806171648987466
3342400,5,B0013FZUQK,"The Forbidden Kingdom is a fairy tale based on the ancient Chinese classic ""Journey To The West"" by the famous Wu Cheng'en. It tells the story of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, both a hero and an antagonist in both the book and the movie though mostly the former. The movie version differs quite a bit from the book though keeping the spirit of the Monkey King intact. Also, as is often necessary, a modern spin is put on the story in the form of an American kid, the main protagonist, Jason who is played by Michael Angarano.

  In short and without giving away the entire story, the Monkey King is tricked by his rival the Jade Warlord, played by Collin Chou, into putting down his magic invincibility staff and is then imprisoned. He needs his staff back to break free and defeat his enemy. It is Jason's job to get it to him. Jackie Chan plays the Drunken Immortal, a supernatural being that helps Jason along. Jet Li plays the Monkey King. Enough said about the plot.

  This movie has it all. There is comedy in the form of slapstick moments and well-placed jokes, moments of triumph as the heroes win and sadness as all seems lost. Through it all the film is family friendly and most importantly fun. The special effects are good and the fighting scenes are very good, being choreographed by the legendary Yuen Woo Ping. All around, this movie rocked. The HD release also includes a ton of extras, many of which are definitely worth watching.

  I highly recommend this movie. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could. The only other thing I can say is click Add To Cart.",1342483200,3,1580,4.439446366782007

Years passed and caught it one day on HBO while home sick from work. I'm so glad I did. As many reviewers have said it's a good movie. I won't beat that like a dead horse. The things that really caught me off guard were the story. Yeah the white kid back story can be cheesy but really it's kind of a modern day fairy tail that kids and adults will enjoy. The two big names do make a nice addition to the movie they are good especially Jet Li as the Monkey King. By far the best parts of the movie. This movie has it all, giant sweeping vistas, action, nice leading ladies and the monkey king. Check out the special features on this double disc set as well.

3342408,3,B0013FZUQK,"2008's ""The Forbidden Kingdom,"" written by John Fusco and directed by Rob Minkoff, plays almost like a dry-run for the remake of ""The Karate Kid"" that was to be released two years later.

In this earlier film, Michael Angarano plays a martial arts movie geek who finds himself magically transported back to war torn Medieval China after he picks up a mysterious staff in a local porn shop.  Jackie Chan stars as a supposed ""Daoist immortal"" who teaches the transplanted teen the ins and outs of martial arts - and who, apparently, has no trouble comprehending modern American English as spoken by a boy from South Boston.  Jet Li portrays The Monkey King, an immortal who was turned into stone by the evil Jade Warlord and must now be freed with the help of the magic staff now in the boy's possession.

The major selling point of ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" is, of course, that it offers fans the rare opportunity of watching the two greatest icons of modern kung fu cinema doing what they do best in a single film.

Thus, while the script - filled as it is with action movie clichs, cheap sentimentality, two-bit philosophizing and anachronistic one-liners and quips - is certainly nothing to write home about, the production design and karate chop spectacle make the movie at least watchable for the martial arts movie geek in all of us.",1318464000,5,1336,4.716738197424893

This film takes the legendary Monkey King and a drunken Immortal as well as other characters from the Chinese mythos and attempts to tell the story in an American  flick with Chinese martial arts.  That idea is still a work in progress, it seems.  Still, take it as it is, a Western film aimed at American teenagers and martial arts enthusiasts.  Even though most of the action takes place in China and has primarily Chinese actors, I, somehow, don't consider this a Chinese film.  The dialogue is also primarily in American English and for me, it seems the film is filtered through American eyes, style, format, custom, fantasy, production and ideals.  For the work it is, I give it five stars, although others may not be so inclined.

Anyway, the film has two great living martial arts legends, Jackie Chan and Jet Li.  It also stars Michael Angarano who plays the young Bostonian with the martial arts fascination and he actually demonstrates quite a few nice martial arts moves.",1315353600,7,1132,4.700507614213198

When I saw this film the first time, I thought it was okay. My preconceived notion of a white protagonist in an essentially all-Chinese cast got the best of my bias leading to me to believe it could've been better. The second time I saw it, I liked it a little more. The subtlety of the story and a few of the themes managed to get a little more empathy out of me. The third time I saw it (as of this review) with all of the extra features and having just been severely disappointed by the big-screen adaptation of The Last Airbender, I now love it. The Forbidden Kingdom is a prime example of how to fuse Eastern atmospherics with Western storytelling, something not easily done in recent memory aside from a handful of titles like Crouching Tiger, Hero, and Huo Yuan Jia (aka Fearless). Granted those are all strictly Chinese productions spoken in Chinese (i.e. more authentic), but what I find so great about Forbidden Kingdom is the degree of detail taken in really capturing the mysticism, fantasy, and martial arts essence of classic Chinese cinema and turning it into an adventurous kind of fairytale that can appeal to both Eastern and Western audiences alike. With people like Peter Pau (Crouching Tiger's photographer), the great Yuen Woo-Ping (choreographer to a lot of great martial arts movies), and two of the biggest Chinese stars in Jackie Chan and Jet Li, it's a grade-A crew. But big props to director Rob Minkoff, producer Casey Silver, and writer Jon Fusco for putting it all together. Thematically, I think the story represents two very important things: the journey West (as in Eastern beliefs and ideals coming to Hollywood), and a little bit of hero/idol-worship (sort of an inverted take on the journey East, since the whole thing was filmed over there and with a Chinese crew). The result was, for me, a very enjoyable film with a little bit of everything (action, adventure, comedy, drama, fantasy). On the downside, the fact that 75% of the movie is in English tends to detract the Chinese actors' performances a little, but I don't think the subtlety would've worked as well without it. But for what it is, I still think it makes for a great kind of escapism compared to another particular movie.

Video - 4.5

As mentioned above, the photography for the movie was done by Oscar-winner Peter Pau of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. And with that said, the video quality of Forbidden Kingdom has a very vibrant and lush presentation. Colors are bold, putting audiences right in the middle of some very beautiful locations around China. As most people probably know from his highly-acclaimed work in Crouching Tiger, the presence of deep green bamboo forests are present yet again in this movie, providing a lot of the same visual nuance and elegance seen there. Image detail is also excellent showing a lot of the fine textures and facial features in the backgrounds, costumes, and actors. Black levels have a nice inky quality to them as well and help in balancing out a lot of the subtle colors in the set design. Contrast is fine, and overall image quality rarely falters throughout the film's run. There were a few times where the image appeared a little softer, though it's never a major distraction. All in all, a great job by the crew, and kudos to Lionsgate for the excellent transfer.

Audio - 5.0

While the picture quality is just short of perfect for me, the 7.1 DTS-HD track delivers on all aspects. High and low ends are reproduced perfectly. Every nuance in the sound effects ranging from forest noise to wind blowing to water dropping is flawless. Dialogue stays clear and understandable (despite some thick accents) through the center channel with no dropout or quality issues. Separation is by far the most crucial factor dividing all sorts of noise throughout the front, sides, and rears. Pay especially close attention during any of the big battle sequences either one-on-one or group-versus-group. No matter how many people there are or how big the stage is, every single voice, sound effect, and chord of music come through clear and sharp. But my favorite scene is the fight between Jackie and Jet. A good deal of LFEs will literally roar your room when Jackie starts fighting in Tiger stance. There are also many other instances within the movie when a lot of body hits make for a nice bassy oomph as well. Outstanding effort by the people at Lionsgate.

Extras - 4.0

For what little there is quantitatively, there's actually a surprising amount of depth in the extras. The most riveting of them is in the P-i-P commentary which takes most of the other behind-the-scenes stuff, dices them into the movie, and adds a little more length to their overall importance. Mind you, the standalone extras are still good in their own right and worth watching (all in HD, too), but fans of the movie should definitely give each of these a watch. Topics discussed cover a lot of ground ranging from production, logistics, shooting, general perspective on both Chinese filming and overall culture and how it's perceived in the West, the conditions in which the film came to be written and cast, and much more. I found all of them to be quite informative and hope that in seeing this movie, more audiences (myself included) will find something to explore and discover beyond just Hollywood.

Overall - 4.5

To this day, I consider The Forbidden Kingdom to be amongst my favorite martial arts fantasy epics. It does an excellent job of blending East and West and makes for a very fun adventure movie. It's something of an oddity in that I feel it's geared more towards the kung fu fanboy in all of us, but at the same time it somehow manages to stand on its own as a kind of fairytale story as well. With some of the top of the top in production crew and cast, the film is a wonderful experience in discovery and movie-watching and is presented with excellence in another great effort by Lionsgate. Highly recommended for martial arts and fantasy fans.",1278633600,5,6002,4.741379310344827

I was surprised by a well rounded fantasy story mixed in with Chinese folk-tale. You simply can not compare it to the Chinese movies. Those tend to be darker with complex relationship and usually the fighting and killing are ruthless with body parts getting ripped apart. Maybe that is why reviewers are saying this is more family friendly. Overall, the story was well thought out. The kung fu fighting scenes were intense and top quality. All actors did very well in portraying their characters. I never watched it because I heard bad reviews from critics when the movie came out. Finally saw it. And I was thoroughly entertained. In terms of showing it to kids, there are still some spots of violence that are not for kids. I probably would limit this movie for kids at least 14 years old. One more thing.

When the aging owner of his favorite pawn shop is shot by local toughs, he entrusts Jason with returning an ancient staff to its rightful owner.  It turns out Jason can't do that without passing into another world, where the ruthless ambition of the Jade Warlord threatens to overthrow a peaceful empire.  When he gets there he's way out of his league, and finds help only in the guise of a drunken warrior (Jackie Chan) and a pacifist priest (Jet Li), and of course, a beautiful young woman of his own age on a revenge quest.  It's the classic tale of a reluctant hero, entering into a fantasy world and discovering in himself the confidence and skills needed to face up to his problems in the real world.  It's a westernized version, for kids, of the classic wuxia film, with larger than life heroes fighting in ways that defy gravity and the other basic laws physics, but look pretty impressive.

After all, someone has to watch all of those hideous reality TV shows, right?

I'm trying to search for anything positive to say about the movie... even the lauded team-up between Jackie Chan and Jet Li didn't pan out in the movie. There were so many things they could have done, but all the opportunities were wasted, such as when JC and JL were arguing over how to best train the clueless white guy - that could have been a great scene! But it wasn't.

And if the idiot white guy was such a big fan of martial arts movies, why didn't he understand he'd have to go through a tough training montage sequence like everyone else? The guy is a hate-able moron.

3342474,5,B0013FZUQK,"5 of 5 stars for the fantasy adventure movie The Forbidden Kingdom. FK stars two of my favoriteaction actors in lead roles, Jackie Chan and Jet Li. I understand that this movie is based on a Chinese story of the Monkey King (btw I was born in the year of the Monkey). Jet Li plays the Monkey King who is captured by a evil lord and held forever. The magic staff (long pole) of the Monkey King makes it way thru time to a shop in LA. A young man (Michael Angarano) is given the staff by the shop keeper and told to return to its rightful owner. He finds that he has been transported to the Forbidden Kingdom where his adventure begins. First he meets a drunk man (Jackie Chan) and later a young lady ""the Sparrow"" (Yifei Liu).

A really nice story that is beautifully photographed. The wire line fights were good but as always seem fake (ah I mean super-natural). The story is good for the whole family. Great fight sequences (of course when you have Li and Chan). I specially liked how Li played the Monkey King during fight sequences. The beautiful sweetheart of the movie is the Sparrow (Liu). The sexy one is ""the Witch"" (Bingbing Li) with her magic hair.

A really wonderful fantasy movie and well worth the time to watch. I highly recommend this movie. The Blu-Ray has alot of behind the scenes materials and is well worth watching. Pass the popcorn and let's watch it again!",1253750400,2,1380,4.407843137254902

3342476,5,B0013FZUQK,"Okay, given that the century is still fairly young, and given that Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee had their fights ALL THE WAY back in the late-1900's, this is still a very worthwhile movie to watch.

The storyline is a bit tacky with a white kid going into this parallel/past universe/timeline, but the fighting sequences definitely carry this movie. The acting, when compared to old Chinese fighting movies, is pretty on-par, and the always-humorous Chan paired with the statuesque Li (and his hyperactive jovial monkey alter-ego) makes for a very entertaining movie throughout.

This is the first Blu-ray movie that I have viewed (decided to give my PS3 a healthy workout), and the detail and sharpness of everything is extraordinary. The fighting scenes defnitely come alive. I am still trying to figure out how to fully utilize the Blu-ray's functionalities (like the RGBY buttons?), but not a whole lot of different menu options than a normal DVD.

The only detractor from watching this in Blu-ray is that the display is so detailed that you see the aging wrinkles of two great martial artists. =/",1251590400,,1098,4.956521739130435

Jackie Chan is my favorite actor though and the fight scene between them was worth the price. I thought adding the kid would make it lamer but it didn't bother me too much. If next time J&J do a movie it should just focus on them. I was impressed with Jackie's fighting in the movie considering his age. It has a good story and sort of reminded me of The Wizard of Oz, but the foreign version. I pretty much knew I would have to own this movie even before I actually saw it.

3342490,3,B0013FZUQK,"Jackie Chan has to be one of the more likable actors of his generation, a man who can successfully combine martial arts brutality and humor.....and pull it off, each time. ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" is another example of his talents, geniality and flair for comedy in addition to the obvious martial arts skills he's shown us all these years.

To make long story very short, this is tale an American teen who finds an ornate bo-staff at a friend's shop in Chinatown and the kid's mission winds up to deliver this age-old weapon to its rightful owner across the world in China and in a different time period. Yeah, I know, the story is ludicrous, but who cares? It's an entertaining film with some great stunts and some good humor. We have young people, old people, amateur fighters and pros, pretty girls with pretty moms, exotic locales and a lot of seriousness mixed with goofiness and Chinese mythology.

This is a not a film for ""hard core"" martial-arts fans, nor is it an ""intelligent"" film but if you're looking for a fun two hours of total escapism without the story being too stupid to enjoy, this fits the bill.

3342498,4,B0013FZUQK,"For martial arts fans, The Forbidden Kingdom is a long overdue film starring the two biggest names in martial arts films: Jackie Chan and Jet Li.  While the fighting scene involving these two megastars is a very minor part of the film, the scene is undoubtedly the best fighting scene in the film.  Jet Li plays a silent monk, while Jackie Chan adopts the persona of a drunken scholar.  The fight contrasts the different styles of these two masters, and is well worth the price of the dvd for martial arts fans.

The story itself is a bit of a stretch.  An American martial arts film fan gets his hands on an ancient bo staff, and is transported back in time to ancient China.  In order to return home, this boy, Jason, must return the staff to the legendary Monkey King, played by Jet Li.  The story is a stretch in the sense that the inhabitants of ancient China wouldn't know English, and the film just fuzzies out this detail.

But then again, with so many action scenes packed into this film, an inconsistency in the script is a minor thing.  After all, people watch The Forbidden Kingdom for its multiple fight scenes, not for the story.

Chan is a drunken ancient who lives off of wine and Jet Li is a priest of sorts who is on a quest to find the person who will give the staff back to its owner as well.  The young boy from Boston learns martial arts while in the care of Li and Chan.

Really, I could see the writer of this amazing action fantasy being a would be Kung Fu expert who wished all of his or her life to be just that expert.  It represents good verses evil and hard work to get to improve yourself.  Again, keeping in mind it is a fantasy, people flying through the air, well, it is no difference than a Harry Potter type of film.

3342528,4,B0013FZUQK,"Director Rob Minkoff's The Forbidden Kingdom is at once influenced by, and a tribute to early martial arts films, notably the Shaw Brother's classic, Come Drink With Me.  In fact, two of its main leads Yifei Liu's Golden Sparrow and Jackie Chan's drunken master Lu Yan, are directly derived from that 1966 pioneering Kung-Fu film.  Minkoff however adds an element of fantasy and even tosses in a sprinkle of The Karate Kid.

The film opens in modern day Boston.  Jason (Michael Angarano) is obsessed with Kung-Fu films and frequents a pawn shop run by Old Hop (also played by Chan) to buy DVDs.  When a neighborhood gang forces Jason to help them rob the old man, Jason escapes with an antique staff he finds himself transported back to ancient China.  Jason learns the tale of the Monkey King (Jet Li), and immortal Kung-Fu master who was tricked and turned to stone by the ruthless Jade Warlord.  Only the return of his staff can free the Monkey King and end the Warlord's rule.

Jason meets the drunken Lu Yan and the beautiful Golden Sparrow, who seeks vengeance against the Warlord for the murder of her family.  They are soon joined by the Silent Monk (also played by Jet Ji) who recognizes Jason as the Seeker of prophecy to return the staff.  Soon both Lu Yan and the Monk are tutoring Jason in the martial arts as they trek towards the Five Elements Mountain and a showdown with the Warlord, the White Witch, and the entire Jade army.

At its heart, Forbidden Kingdom is a typical fantasy quest story, not unlike the Lord of the Rings or hundreds of other books lining the fantasy shelves.  We have the reluctant hero in Jason who only wants to go home, his wise (and wise-cracking) mentors, and the vengeance-driven heroine.  On the other side, Collin Chou is charmingly evil as the Jade Warlord and Lin Bingbing rounds things out as the dangerous White Witch.

So while the plot isn't necessarily original, the film excels in its production, action, and special effects.  The set design is simply magnificent, from the breath taking scenery from the tops of the mountains to the meticulous authenticity of the Jade Warlord's palace.  While some of the fight scenes may go on too long, there's no denying the dynamics of the choreography and incredible high-wire stunt work.  There are moves and maneuvers pulled off that you've never scene before in martial arts films.  Lu Yan's battle with the White Witch whose long tresses are her main weapon was one of the true highpoints of the film.  The Monkey's King's final showdown with the Jade Warlord is also fantastic.

As you might expect from a film with Jackie Chan, there is a good deal of humor in the script, most of it initiated by him or at the expense of his character.  While not known for humor, Li holds his own as the straight man.

You do have to suspend beliefs on a few things, such as how Jason is able to communicate with the rest of the characters when he doesn't speak Chinese and they, presumably, don't speak English.  Also there is the fact that Jason seemingly becomes a Kung-Fu master with just a few days training but if you can believe that Sam was able to mortally wound Shelob than you can certainly believe this as well.

3342550,5,B0013FZUQK,"In this DVD, 2 ancient Chinese warriors must train and mentor a 21st century kung-fu fanatic who's been summonned to fight a centuries-old battle and free the imprisoned Monkey King. I agree with the blurb that this is a must see movie, the best martial arts epic ever made. Everything about this movie is excellent: its story, its costumes, its training and especially its martial arts sequences. I have seen most Jet Li and Jacki Chan's movies but I have never seen them fighting so gloriously as in this DVD.  After 1 viewing one is usually familar with its story. But, it requires many viewings to appreciate its martial arts sequences. I have seen this DVD 7 times and still want to see its martial arts sequences more and more, perhaps because I am a senior instructor in a Kung Fu School and a black belt in Ju Jit Su. If you are a martial arts expert like myself, you too will want to see this movie multiple times. Otherwise, you will certainly enjoy seeing it once or twice.",1231977600,,984,4.4972067039106145

3342555,4,B0013FZUQK,"The Forbidden Kingdom marks the very first time in the Iconic careers of Jet Li and Jackie Chan that they have worked together; fans of both these superstars are bound to have high expectations, but keep in mind this is an American production and in general Li and Chan, while making some good movies in the States they don't hold a candle to their Hong Kong flicks. But despite any flaws The Forbidden Kingdom makes a solid flick for these two Icons to team up together. Who knew it would take this long? One would have figured by this point in their careers some filmmaker would have tried to cash in far earlier.

The Forbidden Kingdom may not be a Martial Arts flick for the ages, but I have to say I really enjoyed this one. The movie is just so much fun that any flaws that can be found are quite easy to overlook. This isn't gonna go down in history as one of the greats, but due to the first teaming of Li and Chan it will go down for that. This may not be Fist of Legend, but this is as fun of a movie you'll come across.

Writer John Fusco (Young Guns & Young Guns II) does a fairly good ob with the script. This may not be one of the all time great screenplays, but it works well and is highly entertaining. I've seen a few movies written by Fusco I find his work entertaining. With The Forbidden Kingdom the script isn't perfect, but has a good mix of light drama and good comedy as well as in my opinion very likeable and fun characters.

Who knew the director of such movies as The Lion King and Stuart Little could make such an entertaining action flick. Going into The Forbidden Kingdom I wasn't sure what to expect with Rob Minkoff directing. This is very far removed from what he's known for and again I really didn't know what to expect. But I have to give Rob Minkoff credit he actually does an excellent job. The pacing is solid and never lags at all; each scene is as entertaining as the last and while Minkoff doesn't make a perfect film he does make a very fun film. The action scenes are solid and overall Rob Minkoff makes one of the better American action movies the past few years.

When you have Woo-ping Yuen doing the fight scenes you know right off the bat no matter how the movie is overall the fight scenes will be good. Woo-ping Yuen has been involved in some of the greatest action movies ever made and while The Forbidden Kingdom may not be his most impressive work in his career, but it's still better than most of what we see in Hollywood. The fight scenes are excellent, but not quite on par with Yuen's other movies, but the fight scenes are fun and the viewer should enjoy it.

Obviously the highlight of the movie is the fight scene with Jet Li and Jackie Chan; fans of these two are bound to love that and it runs at a good length and granted it may not be their strongest work, but it still gets the job done and is bound to put a smile on the faces of the viewer.

The performances are strong for the most part and Jet Li & Jackie Chan are fun to watch and both seem to be enjoying themselves with their roles. Yifei Liu, Li Bing Bing and Michael Angarano provide solid performances and are able to hold their own along side Li and Chan.

The Forbidden Kingdom is by no means one of the great Martial Arts flicks, but for what it's worth it is one of the most fun times you'll have. Despite any flaws The Forbidden Kingdom is highly enjoyable.

The Blu-ray looks simply amazing! The picture is crystal clear and it really enhances the movie watching it on Blu-ray. I'm still new to Blu-ray, but The Forbidden Kingdom will be tough to top.",1230768000,3,3584,4.252569750367107

3342559,3,B0013FZUQK,"Plot: Jason, a kid from the city who is well versed in kung fu movies, gets transported to some parallel Chinese universe so he can return a staff to the Monkey King (played by Li). The Monkey King was tricked and frozen in stone by some other evil kung fu guy. Along the way, Jason meets a drunk (played by Chan) and monk (also played by Li) who help train Jason in kung fu fighting so he can return the staff to the Monkey King.

The camera work was not too crazy so you could actually see the artistry in the fights. The best fight scene had to be the one, mid movie, b/n Chan and Li's characters. I wish there were a little more laughs, better script, and the English was a little easier to hear (thick accents). The wirework in the fight scenes was pretty obvious during some parts (and not just during the Monkey King scenes where it seemed to be intentional). Chan's drunk character was a little too slurry for me and Li's Monkey King character was a little too flippant. I thought the third person talk by Golden Sparrow and the hair parts at the end of the movie were pretty random and out of the blue.",1229299200,,1111,4.240566037735849

If you thought that you will be disappointed. It is much more serious than ""Karate Kid"", but it has a fair amount of humor thrown in initially. It is meant to be a movie the family can enjoy and they will. A nice mix of modern and ancient with East meets West. Good casting with Michael Angarano as the Jersey American thrown into the past, where he meets three masters of Kung Fu in Ancient China played by Jackie Chan, Jet Li, and Yifei Liu. He must take a special staff that was given to him by a dying Chinese Pawn Shop owner, played by Chan, to the Monkey King, played by Li. Chan reuses his role as a drunken master in the Ancient China role as he has done well before in other movies. Although this movie is more adventure than huge Kung Fu choregraphed fights, there are still plenty of those in the movie. Chan and Li both played two parts adeptly, and I recommend it. I give it three and a half stars. Great quality DVD with extras and good replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Kung Fu Hustle"".

3342564,2,B0013FZUQK,"I saw this movie couple times and both DVD and in the theatre. On average, this movie is below any kung Fu Movie either from China, Hong Kong or even Kung Fu Panda! Let me explain.
1. The main character Jason - the American kid  he might be a teen ager, neither he is cute or handsome. I don;t why the director chose this guy, from the beginning to the end of the movie, I didn't see anything sparkling about him.
2. The basic color or tone of this movie looks like a old 60's or 70's style. From the beginning in Chinatown, ( any costume in the movie) to the end,... It's all very dark, old, looks really strange and like a batman movie, even  the characters - forgot the name of the bad guy - his mandarin is very strange and his make up is too much.....
3. This might be a movie for families, but I think from beginning it;s still too vilentcy. It's not good for kid,
4. The two girls in the Movie- White hair girl and Golden Swallow,  they're both very good actors from China, and from this movie, it's a waste for their talent.
5. Like what I said before, the basic tone of this movie is very dark, looks more like a animation and the scenery is very fake....

If you want to see real Ku fu movie- go to search any other Jet Li or Jacky Chan's movie, will be better than this one.",1226707200,,1285,4.067193675889328

It's even worse as a kung fu movie.

That two masters of the craft such as Jet Li and Jackie Chan would pick this as their first movie to do together tells me they didn't understand the English script too well. Even Yuen-Woo Ping's fight choreography was lacking in this and that is a first. The script is boring and plain. Chan is not as funny as usual. Li's character has little substance, and Yifei Lu has little reason to be there at all. The villains have names like the Witch and the Warlord, terrible. The kid was likable but, hard to believe he became a kung fu master in a few days and even when he did it looked bad.

The fight between Chan and Li is good even though it's set in the wrong film and they're a little older and slower, they're still 1000 times better than everyone else in the movie.

3342593,4,B0013FZUQK,"One of the most famous myths out of Asia is that of the Monkey King.  Found in all countries with a Buddhist tradition, this very long novel has never (to my knowledge) been translated into an English language Hollywood production... until now.  Fortunately, the producers cast the world's two most famous martial arts actors, Jet Li and Jackie Chan, to star in it.  Having read the Monkey King story, I can say that this movie only loosely follows the original legend.  However, it has not been romanticized too much by Hollywood.  Even though the movie stars two very attractive Chinese actresses, there is no romance scene.  There is a lot of action and a lot of comedy.  The comedy is great, and highly original to Western viewers, though not necessarily to Chinese viewers familiar with the story.  The action however is where the movie lets done.  Being a Chinese movie, almost all the action focuses on martial arts fight scenes, and they all look copied from previous kung fu movies such as Crouching Tiger; Hidden Dragon, Shanghai Noon, House of Flying Daggers, etc...  Probably the best part of this movie is storyline, numerous scenes are quite unpredictable and engaging.  So overall, a good movie but not a great one.",1224892800,,1230,4.837320574162679
3342594,4,B0013FZUQK,I am a big fan of Jet Li and Jackie Chan. The martial arts reminds you of the old days of Kung Fu movies and it was quite funny.,1224806400,,128,3.4482758620689653
3342595,3,B0013FZUQK,"The long-awaited collaboration between Jackie Chan and Jet Li may have worked better 10 years ago, when the actors were still in their prime.  When you consider the ages of the two (Chan at about 53, and Li at about 44, when this was filmed) they did do an amazing job.  I'll be lucky if I can operate my TV remote by the end of this year.  This is the most enjoyable work I've seen from Chan since ""Who Am I"" or ""Gorgeous"" in the late 90's.  Li still looks good in performance (he does some fantastic stick-fighting), and we might still have a little while with him.

The plot is a cross between ""The Never Ending Story"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"", with a dash of ""The Karate Kid"" and ""Highlander"" thrown in.  Point being:  It's silly.  Bearing that in mind, it's very well executed and visually stunning.  Plus it contains a crapload of references to various Shaw Bros and Wuxia films.  HERE GOES:  A young martial-arts-movie-enthusiast named Jason (Michael Angarano) dreams about the Monkey King (Li) at night before entering an old store in Chinatown run by the elderly Hop (Chan), who sells bootleg DVDs.  Some bullies then use Jason to break into Hop's, since he knows the owner.  During the chaos, Hop is shot by the gang leader.  Despite his injury, Hop gives Jason an old staff and tells him it must be returned to its rightful owner.  Jason runs away from the gang to a nearby rooftop, where he is magically whisked away to ancient China!  Having no idea how he got there, he wanders around until he is attacked by soldiers, who are looking for the staff.  He is helped by a wandering drunk named Lu Yan (Chan, again), who tells him that the staff belongs to the Monkey King, and must be returned to him, and kept out of the clutches of the evil Jade Warlord (Collin Chou, ""Flash Point"", ""Fearless"") who imprisoned the Monkey King in the first place.  Joining them along the way are Golden Sparrow (Yifei Liu), a young girl whose parents were killed by the Jade Warlord, and a monk (Li, again), whose vested interest is also to return the staff to the Monkey King.

The fights are done by Yuen Woo Ping, and while pretty good, could have been better.  I know that he's the man when it comes to martial arts choreography, but I've grown tired of his style, especially concerning wires.  He just doesn't seem to know when to say when.  Luckily, this is the type of movie where it's more in keeping with the story.  After all, this is a fantasy movie with plenty of magic.  Hell; the Monkey King, the Jade Warrior, and Lu Yan are all immortals.  In fact, Lu Yan is one of the 8 Drunken Immortals, referenced in a style during Chan and Woo Ping's 1978 classic ""Drunken Master"".  One thing I will say about the fights is that there are quite a few of them, so I shouldn't gripe too much.  There are some pretty sweet (and very creative) moments during the action, the highlight of which is the fight between Chan and Li.  Their fight could never live up to its expectations, but it's still a lot of fun, much like the rest of the film.  Even the character of Jason does some cool stuff in the last act.  I rented this, and am considering purchase, so I musta liked it quite a bit.  At the very least, this is the best martial arts fantasy aimed at kids since ""Surf Ninjas"".

Upon its initial release, there were already 3 versions of the disc, including Blu Ray.  This DVD is in widescreen with fantastic picture quality.  The xtras are plentiful, but I was hoping for some interviews with the two leads, whose behind-the-scenes antics are barely glimpsed during the other features.  It's in English and some Cantonese with subtitles available in Spanish.  This also has running commentary by director Rob Minkoff and screenwriter John Fusco.  Fusco's script is based on the classic Chinese novel ""Journey to the West"".  I would love to see a serious movie about the legend of the Monkey King.  He is the trickster of Chinese mythology, and I'm fascinated by his folklore.  3.5/5

3342622,4,B0013FZUQK,"Three stars? Three and a half stars? On one hand, it's formulaic stuff. On the other hand, it pairs up Jackie Chan and Jet Li for the first time...

I had a sinking feeling a while ago, when I saw that this movie was being promoted with the youngsters in mind. Turns out, THE FORBIDDEN KINGDOM is good enough that I'm glad I got the chance to see it, and to enjoy it for what it is, which is a decent but routine and defanged martial arts picture aimed at kids. But should fans of Jet Li and Jackie Chan feel cheated? Maybe. Probably.

The premise revolves around Jason Tripitkas (Michael Angarano), a bullied Boston teenager who is geeked about all things wushu, to the extent that he hangs out a lot at a shabby Chinese shop in search of bootleg kung fu movies. An unconvincing chain of events transports this kid back in time to an enchanted ancient China, during the reign of heavenly emperors, mighty warlords and the legendary Monkey King. Jason ends up with the Monkey King's staff and unwillingly sets off on a quest to free the trapped Monkey King, who had been transformed into stone. It's the only way Jason can get home.

The kid meets and is taken under the wing of the tatterred, boozy Lu Yan (Chan), one of the eight Immortals, with this particular Immortal's powers stemming from a constant intake of wine (those who've already seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drunken-Master/dp/B00005YUNV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drunken Master</a>&nbsp;will get a refresher course on drunken-fist kung fu). Some time in the movie, Jet Li's white-robed Silent Monk shows up and, along with Lu Yan, strives to mentor the kid (cue in flashes of THE KARATE KID). And naturally there's also a beautiful but troubled orphan girl named Golden Sparrow, who's out to revenge her murdered parents. And Sparrow touts a mean martial arts skill set. These four end up challenging the fearsome Jade Warlord, who rules ancient China with an iron fist and who can magically influence earth (he was the one who transformed the Monkey King into a stone statue). The Jade Warlord right away shows the potential to be a pretty formidable big bad, but in the end the predictable storyline renders him mediocre.

Thing is, THE FORBIDDEN KINGDOM is much less than what I expected from a first teaming up of Jet Li and Jackie Chan. These two icons deserve more. It would've been wicked cool if they'd landed a richer, more ambitious, more epic story. Something with a more emotional and philosophical core. An R Rating also would've elevated this film, possibly have made it darker and more intense in tone. Instead of this lightweight product, which is entertaining, but is still fluff. The movie also instantly lost credibility points with me when the main protagonist turned out to be this American kid, and that the bookend scenes took place in the U.S. No knock on the kid, 'cause he was okay, but I can't help but feel that this collaboration would've been better served - would've resonated more - if filmed in the East and in Chan and Li's native tongue. Because then they would've been fully in their element. In this movie, Jackie Chan's accent is thick enough that, most times, I couldn't understand his lines; I was craving sub-titles so bad. By doing it the way they did, the film certainly takes advantage of the two stars' crossover appeal. But a measure of integrity and street cred slips away. Was I expecting too much, hoping for a meaningful movie?

The very best parts, it shouldn't be a surprise, are the action sequences, with the riveting one-on-one tussle between Jackie and Jet shaming the other fight scenes (although Jackie's tavern brawl is also nice). It does shock me a bit that both of these guys are still so limber and athletic; I believe Jackie was 54 years old at the time and Jet, 45. But then, with action choreographer Woo-Ping Yuen in charge, we're talking first rate wire-fu stuff here. Jet is quite good as the Silent Monk (he scatters a few words here and there) and also as the cheeky, mystical Monkey King. Note that Jackie also plays two roles, although his old shopkeeper isn't really a very sexy part. However, his inebriated Immortal is certainly showy enough. Jackie and Jet's moments together make for intriguing viewing, not so much because they're tearing up the scenery or anything, but more because of the historical significance. Throughout the watching of the film, I couldn't quite believe that someone had finally managed to get these two together.

Yifei Liu plays Golden Sparrow, who annoyingly refers to herself in the third person. Bingbing Li is the Jade Warlord's accomplice Ni Chang, who will remind old-schoolers of the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bride-With-White-Hair/dp/630502054X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bride With White Hair</a>. I read that these two girls, who are big names in the East, didn't have an extensive background in the martial arts, but that they trained their you-know-whats off and, on screen, they end up looking like they know what they're doing. They're quite graceful.

There are bits of humor present, mostly provided by Jackie Chan's Lu Yan. The funniest bit takes place when Lu Yan, in the scorching desert, prays for water and then kind of has his wish granted. In a way, what happens to Lu Yan in that scene is kind of how I feel the hardcore martial arts fans were treated.

The visuals are very good, but don't quite achieve the spectacular poetry of HERO or HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS or CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. The CGI stuff here is okay, but, honestly, I would've bartered the computer effects for more of Jackie and Jet in action. They may now be older and greyer and less spry, but you won't convince me that they can't still qualify as walking, breathing, kicking, punching, flippin' human highlights.

If you're craving family film fluff, then THE FORBIDDEN KINGDOM is made to order. But if you're a diehard fan of Jet Li and Jackie Chan, you might not help but feel a bit cheated.",1222992000,2,6084,4.9393939393939394

The Forbidden Kingdom is one this years (in my opinion) martial arts movies. Jet and Jackie worked great with each other and even Jet showed his comedic side. Even though this movie is mostly for youngsters it still good for all ages. Jet Li and Jackie Chan should do more movies with each other.

3342628,4,B0013FZUQK,"This film catches a lot of flack for having little depth to it in terms of story and for being like a cheezy kung fu flick with good stunts and special effects. And personally i'd be inclined to agree, since that's exactly what it is.

In summary, Forbidden Kingdom is the story about some wanna be kung fu white boy from Boston who loves old badly dubbed Kung-Fu flicks who gets sucked into the past to Ancient China by some mysterious vortex gate thingy to return this mystical staff to its ""rightful owner"" who we later find out belongs to the Monkey King. Yeah...

So anyway, as I said, the story isn't really all that deep. Its got all the basic elements that make a movie plot work and move forward, but frankly, this movie was just an excuse to get Jet Li and Jackie Chan together in a movie and let them kick each others and everyone else's butt. And truthfully, I gotta say I loved it. well, maybe not loved, but liked a lot. Personally I don't really think this was made to be some huge masterfully done epic movie like Hero or Fearless, but rather just a fun to watch Kung-Fu flick that pays homage to a lot of the old school films that we grew up on. So if you never seen it, I suggest you not look so deep into and take it for what it is; a fun movie.

3342640,4,B0013FZUQK,"The Good Things
*Good video/sound quality (great on Blu-Ray).
*Avalaible in either a single-disc version with no features, or 2-disc or Blu-Ray versions with numerous featurettes and a digital copy of the film.
*The movie itself has quite a bit of great fight scenes and slick special effects.
*Its very well-filmed.  Lots of strong imagery and colors.  Good cameramanship.
*Production design is great.  Costumes and sets are very detailed and vivid.
*Storyline is okay.
*Okay music.
*Violence is not so bad, and there is nothing graphic.  Would be acceptable for older children (rated PG-13).

The Bad Things
*Characters are nothing to scream about.  The Monkey King and the guy Jackie Chan played were probably the most memorable characters.  The main character is just a boy who wants to go home, and shows no development (other than is fighting skills).  Bad guys were cool, but also shallow.

The Questionable Things
*The movie overall is short and simple.  Its great for quick and easy entertainment, but don't expect anything as deep, complex, or moving as other wuxia films (like ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" or ""Hero"").

This is what you get when you mix ""The Neverending Story""'s plot structure with an Asian fantasy epic.  It's pretty darn fun, with lots of great fighting, special effects, and smooth photography.  But it lacks depth in its characters and story.  It makes for some awesome mindless entertainment, but if you're a fan of the genre and looking for something thought-provoking or deep, this would not be it.",1222214400,2,1536,5.067729083665339

I do know the the monkey king is a very interesting character and this movie tells an interesting story. The fight scenes are highly choreographed and a lot of CGI and wires are used. The best fight scenes are when Li and Chan are fighting each other.  Li and Chan are about 15 years past their prime, but the fight scenes still work. There is a underlying respect each character has for the other.

The best scenes are when the masters are teaching the young American kid kung fu. The kid at an early point in his training asks Jackie Chan's character if he gets to learn all the moves he's learned in the video game. Jackie takes a bowl of rice and gives him an object lesson about learning and life that is somewhat profound.

The movie has a humor and charm underneath and is aimed at adolescents. I kept my expectations low and I enjoyed it. The movie had quite a bit of heart and a charm.",1221868800,,1047,4.304568527918781
3342645,4,B0013FZUQK,"While the '08 film `The Forbidden Kingdom' starring Chinese superstars Jet Li and Jackie Chan certainly doesn't qualify for the Martial Arts Cinematic Hall of Fame there is definitely more positive than negative to be said about this production. Admittedly there's not a lot original here, one can clearly see a plethora of storyline elements liberally borrowed from other films, some of the most obvious being; `The Neverending Story', `The Karate Kid' and `The Wizard of Oz'. There are also occasional hints of; `Warriors of Virtue', `Narnia' and `Lord of the Rings' that are hard to miss. Since this is a martial arts film one cannot help but notice a few similarities with such Chinese films as the blockbuster `Hero' and the lesser known cult classic `Legend of Zu'.

Ok, I think I've made my point. Originality is definitely not the strength of this film. However that doesn't mean that the viewer, especially the younger males in the audience won't enjoy this one immensely. The action is fast and furious, Shia LaBeouf look-a-like Michael Angarano is likeable and solid in the role of Jason Tripitkas, the fung fu fan who is transported through time and space to ancient China to return the magical staff to the mythic Monkey King. Liu Yifei will also attract your full attention as the lovely young female warrior Golden Sparrow.

`The Forbidden Kingdom' may not garner high marks from the more astute martial arts fans but the kids will love it. Finally, you've got to admit classic or not it's kind of nice to see Jackie Chan and Jet Li in a film together.",1221436800,2,1567,4.821561338289963

Michael Angarano know to me as Elliot on Wil and Grace did a superb job.  Pretty girl Sparrow (I never saw her in any films before) you know she's an upcoming actress.

One thing I haven't noticed in the other reviews: the soundtrack, specifically the choral music, is deafening, even to the point of making the dialog unintelligible in spots.  Finally, I believe firmly that wire-assisted flying in martial arts films is grotesquely over-used.

The action is quite intense with the only scene that looked somewhat fake being the fight between the Monkey King and Jade Army at the beginning of the film with all the wire work. The plot is some what on the weak side but coming from one that watches a lot of Japanese and Chinese films it is one of the better for fantasy martial arts.

3342662,4,B0013FZUQK,"The Story: Some bloke called Jason Tripitakas (Michael Angarano) is entrusted a golden-staff by a dying pawnshop owner, Hop (Jackie Chan) to be returned to its rightful owner. It turns out that the rightful owner is the legendary Monkey-King (Jet Li). Jason somehow fell through the Gate of No-Gate (don't ask) and landed in Ancient China. Thus begins his quest to carry the staff all the way to the Five-Element Mountains and return it to the Monkey-King, who had been turned to stone by the evil Jade Warlord (Colin Chou). Along the way, he meets up with the Drunken Taoist Lu Yan (also played by Jackie Chan), a Monk (also played by Jet Li) and Golden Sparrow (Liu Yifei). Together, they form the Fellowship of the Staff and travel to the Five-Element Mountains to confront the evil Jade Warlord and his assistant, the Bride With White Hair (Li Bing Bing).

Acting: C'mon, you're not planning to watch this film for the acting, right? If you are, you'll probably want to murder the annoying Michael Angarano! He plays this stupid kid obsessed with Shaw Bros. kung-fu movies who is thrust into this fantasy world where everyone speaks English with a Chinese-accent. Therefore, he appears blur throughout the film - even when he finally kills the evil Jade Warlord! The best actor in the film is Jackie Chan. He's not as good a martial artist as Jet Li but he's a far better comic-actor. As for the others, Colin Chou does a good job as the megalomaniacal Jade Warlord. Liu Yifei is under-utilized here. She doesn't do much except to look good and to play the pipa. I was surprised by how good her English was though (unless it's dubbed). Li Bing Bing, known for her roles as the quiet and demure girl, puts in a surprising turn as the maniacal Bride With White Hair (a role made famous by veteran actress Bridgette Lin).

Cinematography, Setting & Soundtrack: The sets and scenery are breath-taking. Throw in a beautiful soundtrack and the whole thing looked and felt really epic. I also loved the opening credits with animated shots featuring old Shaw Bros. movie posters. The whole movie comes across as a weird mixture of The Lord Of The Rings, Chinese mythology and Shaw Bros. wuxia but it works! The whole Ancient China landscape is really an imaginary fantasy-wonderland. Watching this movie (and seeing through the eyes of the lead character Jason Tripitakas) is like being immersed in a fantasy-land of flying characters, magical weapons, mystical mountains and maidens who looked like Liu Yifei.

Fighting: Finally, the main reason why you want to watch this movie. Just to let you know, there's only one real long fight scene between Jackie Chan and Jet Li but that alone is worth the price of admission. Very well choreographed fight by veteran Yuen Wo-Ping. In other words, Jackie Chan does his Drunken Master stuff and Jet Li does his lightning-fast kicks & punches. Other than that, we also get countless other fights with the soldiers of the evil Jade Warlord, Jackie Chan beating up a lady (Li Bing Bing) into pulp and the 3,294,285th time Jet Li fights Colin Chou in a movie! There are also some really good expositions of Zen-like thoughts on martial-arts during the scenes when Jackie and Jet both take turns to teach Jason Tripitakas.

Overall: Very fun action-adventure movie for the whole family. The kids will love it (and so will the ""kid"" in you). I'm getting the DVD once it's out. Knowing my kids, they'll probably watch it again and again and again... :)",1220918400,2,3484,4.772802653399668

3342665,5,B0013FZUQK,I really enjoyed this movie... I have been a Jackie Chan fan since I can remember and it's so great to see him make a movie with another Master like Jet Li --- you can distinctly see the difference with their fighting style and it's amazing to see it on the big screen --- I do hope that this won't be the movie they will make together -- this is definitely a must on your DVD collection!!!,1220054400,2,390,4.077922077922078

Obviously, as all Kung-Fu movies are, the main feature of Kingdom is sparring, and throughout, my inner nerd came out to say ""Bad Ass!"" on more than one occasion. But, as all martial artes movies are, fightings the strongs suit, while the story was lack-luster. Start off with a average joe who's fix is Hong Kong Hollywood, and soon, that's his reality, he trys to escape while fighting the immortal emporor. Which is fine, I'm not looking for a Metal Gear style story. But when you have two legends from the genre(Chan and Li), I'd expect everyone to step up their game(I'm looking at you Liu Yi Fei). But more importantly, why even have the American here? You have Jakie Chan(looking like the Chinese Jack Sparrow) and Jet Li fighting? Heck, I'd make that the whole movie. Never the less, it was neat to see the diffrent philosphy and items, that I've studied, talked about and used throughout.

 Besides being an imspirational source for me me in technique, the Kingdom has a fine frequency of fighting for a film, but just blah in between.",1219881600,2,1194,4.627358490566038
3342668,4,B0013FZUQK,"Two of the biggest icons in 20th Century martial arts band together for the first time in a great adventure film. We are all familiar with Jet Li's work as being primarily serious and very intense, whereas Jackie Chan's movies tend to be more comical when using his style of Kung Fu. This film blends the two styles together brilliantly in a fun, moving and intense fantasy adventure film.

Relatively unknown actor Michael Angarano plays Jason Tripitikas, a martial arts fanatic who, one day while making another regular visit to Lu Yan's Pawn shop discovers a legendary staff previously owned by the Sage and Warrior The Monkey King. That night Jason is forced into tricking the owner into letting in a group of robbers who shoot the elderly owner. Jason is told by the owner that he must take the staff and return it to its rightful owner, so he runs off with the staff in hand. On the roof he's dragged over the edge by an unseen force which transports him a few hundred years into ancient China.

Jason wakes up in ancient China completely bewildered by what just happened. He wakes up in a small village which is then attacked by Jade Warriors but is saved by the drunken immortal Lu Yan (Jackie Chan). Yan tells Jason the story of the staff and how it used to belong to the immortal Monkey King (Jet Li), but whilst in a battle with the Jade Warlord (Colin Chou) he's tricked into putting down his staff and is encased in a Jade prison. Managing to cast the staff away, a prophecy foretells that the staff will one day be returned to the King and the battle can be ended once and for all.

I have to be honest and say that this film isn't something we haven't seen before. It's simply a blend of the 20th and 21st century martial arts based movies, such as The Karate Kid and Crouching Tiger. Crouching Tiger in the choreography and style of the fight sequences, The Karate Kid in the way of geeky kid becomes a master at the martial arts. This type of thing could put a lot of people off, and to be honest I wouldn't blame them. Personally, the main appeal of this film is the fact that it stars both Jet Li and Jackie Chan.

Now Michael Angarano I think to some will just be a small time actor given a surprisingly big role. To many people including myself, he's simply an actor we've never heard of that kind of looks like Shia Labeouf. Although he's not really a big name movie actor, he certainly delivered in this role and it should lead to much bigger things for the 21 year old. Chan as always is great in his fighting sequences and his general comic role, this time as the loveable, yet skilful drunk. Li is as always quite the serious character, but at times breaking his own clich and actually becoming quite fun.

The fight sequences, especially the one pitting Chan against Li is something to be experienced and the skill of the two is just astounding. It's genuinely hard to believe that, Jet Li at 45 and Chan at 54 can still pull off some of the amazing moves that they did at the start of their careers. It's by no means a bad movie, but it's one only for those that are fans of both Li's and Chan's previous work. I wouldn't say it's quite suitable for the whole family as there is quite a big of graphic violence in it. That being said, as long as a responsible parent is making the decision, then I have no doubt this can be enjoyed by the whole family anyway.",1219622400,2,3387,4.361331220285262
3342669,3,B0013FZUQK,"As I watched this movie, I had a feeling that I was watching an Eastern version of THE NEVER ENDING STORY. You know the story:  the unpopular kid who is bullied and took refuge in his books. Except with this, we have a much older kid who is obsessed with Kung Fu films. In this movie, East meets west when Jason, a geeky teenager from Boston's south side is transported to ancient China. Jason (Michael Angarano) is magically transported into another realm charged with returning a magical staff to its rightful owner.  It wasn't until after he wakes up in Ancient China that he finds out who that rightful owner is.

And here comes trouble...

Enter a group of marauding warriors and cue the drunken master Lu Yuan (Jackie Chan).  And yes, he speaks English too!  Jason is rescued and over a cup of tea, Jason learns from Lu Yuan that the staff belonged to the Monkey King (Jet Li). Now the cheeky Monkey King was tricked by the Jade Warlord (Colin Chou) who subsequently encased him in carbonite. The only way to undo the damage was through the return of the magical staff. Trouble continues to follow Jason and soon they acquire a third member, Sparrow Girl (Yifei Liu).  Now Sparrow is a likeable enough character and has some impressive Kung Fu skills of her own. Really, it would be heartless not to feel compassion for this orphaned adolescent even though she likes to refer to herself in the third person.  Later, a fourth member comes along in the form of the Silent Monk (also played by Jet Li) and the party is completed (much like THE WIZARD OF OZ).

And the fighting starts...

Viewers are entertained by several minutes of fight scenes between Chan and Li.  Who comes out on top? It doesn't matter because these two are simply getting to know each other.  Truly, what better way to capitalize on these two Kung Fu stars than by pitting them against each other and letting the film capture as much of this once in a lifetime chance of getting these two Masters together in the same movie. Indeed, this is a real fete for Hollywood for they have achieved what the Hong Kong cinema wasn't able to do and history is made.

THE FORBIDDEN KINGDOM doesn't require much of your brain to be enjoyed. The plot is simple and caters more for kids, but grown-ups certainly would find much to enjoy here. I certainly did. Woo Ping Yuen (who also choreographed the Matrix, Kill Bill and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) does not disappoint in this film and provides most of the fun as we see Jackie Chan and Jet Li try to beat the hell out of each other. It is not original; in fact, we are also reminded of another of Chan's best movies DRUNKEN MASTER. In this, Chan plays the Master and Angarano the student. Anyone who has seen that movie would agree that it is almost a copycat.  However, all in all, Rob Minkoff (Stuart Little, Lion King) does a good job of keeping things plotting along enough to provide viewers with an entertaining form of escaping from the daily grind.",1219536000,6,2976,4.527985074626866

Then- mix in an almost laughable combo of Never Ending Story with Karate Kid. I guess if I were 12 or 13 this would be fine- I wouldn't know it's a knock off, but being a child of the 80's this movie was painful to sit through. And I can't see why they did it- the movie would have been fine without this terrible sub-plot line of 'the boy who gets bullied by the meanies at school and then gets transported to a magic world to learn Kung Fu and save a world from the evil... blah blah blah'.

3342681,3,B0013FZUQK,"With anyone but Jackie Chan and Jet Li, this film would be forgettable.  The story and the production blend elements of Journey to the West, Narnia, and Lord of the Rings in an unremarkable western take on wuxia, the traditional Chinese marital arts drama.  Apparently first developed as a bed-time story for the American screenwriter's son, the plot has a certain unaffected charm that manages to shine through the film's over-polished veneer and poor choices in casting.  No one could possibly believe that such slight, rail-thin women could put a whipping on anything but a salad bar, and it's hard to work-up any sympathy for Michael Angarano as the point-of-view character, who with his sad hang-dog face and whiny demeanor fairly invites the bullying thats heaped on him.  His transformation from a pasty wimp unlikely to fight his way out of a room of kindergarteners into a kung-fu warrior is embarrassingly laughable.

Ultimately it's Jet and Jackie that make this a film worth watching.  Their fluid movement and comedic timing leave the other fighters looking clumsy and overly earnest.  The highlight of the film is the pair's extended fight scene, an amazing pairing of talents not likely to be seen elsewhere in martial arts cinema for some time to come.  See it now while you can, but be prepared for lots of incredulous eyeball rolling and spot-the-Rings-and-Narnia-references.

3342682,4,B0013FZUQK,"The idea of making a martial arts film starring Jackie Chan and Jet Li, directed by Rob Minkoff (""Stuart Little,"" its first sequel and ""The Haunted Mansion"") may not appeal to you very much. It is only natural that you become skeptical of its success if you still remember the disappointing Hollywood-made actions like ""Rush Hour 3"" or ""The One."" Surprisingly, however, ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" turned out a very entertaining film with nice actions and some interesting characters.

An avid American kung-fu film fan Jason (Michael Angarano) is magically transported to a fantasy world where his martial arts skills and courage are tested through a series of thrilling adventures. In this land where ruthless Jade Warlord (Colin Chou) reigns, the South Boston boy meets perpetually drunk Lu Yan (Jackie Chan) one of the legendary ""Eight Immortals,"" who is actually a great kung fu master. With Lu Yan, mysterious ""Silent Monk"" (Jet Li) and an orphaned girl ""Golden Sparrow"" (Yifei Liu), Jason sets out a long journey to fulfill the mission for which he was sent there.

You know this is a formula that has been used so many times before and it works amazingly well once the film gets into gear in the mid-section, showing the actions. Jackie Chan and Jet Li show orthodox-style kung fu fights (choreographed by Yuen Woo Ping) which are great fun to see. (And remember, Jackie Chan is 54 years old!) Michael Angarano playing a rather thankless role is also very good, but the most memorable is Bingbing Li, playing a white-haired villainess Ni Chang (her character most recently filmed in Ronny Yu-directed ""The Bride with White Hair"" with Brigitte Lin).

There are many references to kung-fun films including Jackie Chan's classic ""Drunken Monkey"" or Shaw Brothers films and Chinese culture in general. The most notable one is of course the famous Chinese epic story ""'Journey to the West"" and The Monkey King, also played by very comical Jet Li. Jet Li playing the double roles might look strange at first, but it is actually a nice idea to wrap up the story.

Sure, some CG images look a bit cheesy and let's face it, this collaboration of Jet Li and Jackie Chan should have been released ten years earlier. Still the fact that ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" offer lots of fun doesn't change at all. Enjoy it.",1218326400,2,2303,4.86734693877551

3342685,4,B0013FZUQK,"Jet Li and Jackie Chan: two of Hong Kong's most renowned superstars. Who would win in a fight? Who's faster and more agile?  This question has been in every Martial Arts fans' mind and this project has been a long time in the making, Asian film fans have all but given up on the idea after the little melee in 1995 called ""High Risk"" wherein Li would play a bodyguard to Chan. It was said that Chan turned down the project because of his character's lack of creative depth, while someone I know who worked with him said it was Li who didn't want to work with Chan. Chan attempted to break into the Hollywood fold via ""The Big Brawl"" but it wasn`t really until ""Rumble in the Bronx"" and ""Rush Hour"" did he really get noticed. Jet Li stole the show in ""Lethal Weapon 4"" and enjoyed ""Kiss of the Dragon`s"" box-office success. Those projects were about ten years ago. ""FORBIDDEN KINGDOM"" may not be the best film to have them show their stuff and the two may have their best roles behind them, but hey, they can still duke it out like no one else.

Jason is a young man who is very obsessed with Asian Martial arts films. Most of the time, he spends his time in a pawnshop owned by a kindly old man in the hunt for rare Asian Films. One day, he crosses paths with a gang of bullies who intend to rob the old man. The old man asks Jason to take the staff away from all the chaos and as if by some stroke of fate, Jason find himself in another world, another time. A mystical world ruled by the evil Jade warlord (Collin Chou) who wants the very staff given him by the old man in the pawnshop. Supposedly the staff is the key to power in the kingdom and must be returned to its rightful owner; the Monkey King. He meets up with a drunken man named Lu Yan (Jackie Chan), a pretty young woman bent on vengeance named ""Golden Sparrow"" (Crystal Liu Yifei) and a stoic monk (Jet Li). Together they challenge the forces of the warlord led by a lovely silver-mane woman named Ni Chang ( Li Bing Bing, Dragon Heat) or perish in the attempt--

The film may be America's tribute to Asian cinema and surprisingly, the film is directed by Rob Minkoff; yes, the same director who gave us Disney's ""Haunted Mansion"". No big-shot Hong Kong director takes the helm but an American director. Don't worry, at least the filmmakers were smart enough to get the services of a legendary Martial Arts director; Yuen Woo-Ping. The film has a lot of references to Asian cinema, quite a lot that would put even Tarantino to shame. Ni Chang is lovely and looks like a tribute to the Wuxia epic; ""Bride with White Hair"". While Golden Sparrow is a tribute to Cheng Pei Pei's ""Golden Swallow""; she even quotes ""Come Drink with me"", a Cheng Pei Pei film. The bamboo forest looks reminiscent to ""A Touch of Zen"" and ""House of flying Daggers"". Scenes of ""A Monkey goes West"" is even seen in Jason's Television screen. I was ready to bash this film until I saw it for what it was; an American-kid's tribute to Hong Kong cinema. Someone who loves Chan and Li, who would give Asian cinema the respect it deserves. The filmmakers had good intentions and as an Asian film fan, I applaud them for their ambition.

The film's showstopper lies in its hyper-kinetic action sequences. Yuen Woo-Ping (also responsible for Kill Bill, Kung Fu Hustle) knows his stuff and it is no surprise that he is Asia's premier fight choreographer. The fight between Chan and Li was fairly long and the film's main draw. Sure, the intensity isn't as hard-hitting as the climactic battles in ""Legend of Drunken Master"" and ""Fist of Legend"" but nonetheless, it was still masterfully done. Use of ""wire fu"" is obvious and the fight was well-executed and cleverly choreographed. It was very ""family-friendly"" as was its intention. The battles with Collin Chou (Donnie Yen's opponent in FlashPoint) was more bloody than the other fights but it still maintained its limits. There are quite a decent number of fight sequences that die-hard fans of Martial Arts films will be at home.

The performances are good for the most part; Li's performance isn't on his ""The Warlords"" caliber but it'll do as the quiet(?) monk. Chan's character is more witty and sharp-tongued. Chan's humorous appeal helps the film's pace and assists the scenes without any exciting action. Collin Chou's Jade warlord seemed a bit too underwhelming as the villain (the mascara has to go). However, his aid, Ni Chang (Played by Li Bing Bing) is so lovely that she eats up the screen with her whip-wielding, white-haired charisma that will undoubtedly strike a familiar image to Asian cinema fan boys. Sparrow may be the epitome of the ultimate Asian-woman; she has that intensity but maintains a girl next door look. Michael Angarano plays Jason; he may look very  awkward at first but his character grew on me after awhile.

""Forbidden Kingdom"" does have its share of problems but somehow, it overshadows them. The Yuen Woo-Ping directed fight sequences is the film's main strength, along with Jackie Chan's humorous appeal and it doesn't hurt to have Jet Li around either. The film is a bit too family-friendly for my tastes but thankfully, the filmmakers made it work. The plot is a bit too simple but it knew exactly what it wanted to do. Its execution may be lacking at times but the appearance of the classic ""Golden Sparrow"" and ""Ni Chang"" characters with Chan's character reminiscent of his ""Drunken Master"" days and Jet Li as a monk, reminiscent of Shaolin Temple; the film is an enjoyable affair. I give the American filmmakers credit where its due; they managed to get these two superstars together--something HK cinema wasn't really able to do.

Ok take that popcorn out of the microwave, grab your cola, and set the lights down low and get ready for some kung-fu action.

At first glance, the movie seems to be full oh wired choreographed fight scenes which I pretty much loathe. But the movie took the scenes and made them `ok'. It was like it was telling us ""Yes, we know you know it's wires, but you and we are ok with it"". And I was. It starts with The Monkey King kicking some butt up on top of a fake looking mountain top, and then *poof* we find out that it was all but a dream. Jason Tripitikas wakes up and heads to his favorite pawn shop down in Chinatown to pick up some more kung-fu movies. As Jason is heading out of Chinatown, he gets stopped by some local thugs/bullies. They make fun of him about his kung-fu movies and then show him some of their own fighting style. After the beat down they tell him to take them to the pawn shop so they can rob the place. The old man, knowing a few moves himself, takes it to them, but only cheated out of the grace of fighting like a man, by a single bullet. Jason runs from the thugs with a staff that the old man hands him. As Jason tries to get away, he falls and lands...

...in a different world in a different time. He comes across a man named Lu Yan (Chan) who tells him about his staff. That it once belonged to powerful man named The Monkey King. The Monkey King was tricked into a non fair fight and before the King was imprisoned he sent his staff away so that someone could come rescue him with it. They assume it's Jason, but is it? As they travel to where the Monkey King is imprisoned they come across Golden Sparrow. A girl seeking revenge for her family's death. They also come across The Silent Monk (Li), who is also on a mission to free the Monkey King. With their journeys intertwined, we can only hope for some sweet Kung-Fu action. And boy do we get it.

Jackie Chan vs. Jet Li was truly fun to watch. We all know it could've been MUCH better if they were probably 10 or 15 years younger than they are, but come on, it was still a great fight scene. Praying Mantis, Snake, Tiger, Crane, all types of Kung-Fu was used. It was definitely something to witness.

The Monkey King vs. The Jade Emperor, even though CGI enhanced and wire enhanced, was pretty awesome. It made the fact that they were godlike characters more believable. The CG used for this was spectacular and looked close to being real.

And there were many more scenes where Lu Yan, The Silent Monk, the Golden Sparrow are fighting all types of people. You won't be bored with a lack of Kung-Fu.

I also liked how there was a white haired woman bounty hunter after them. When she fought her hair became part of arsenal along with a whip she carried. Now I've seen some Kung-Fu flicks with people using their long hair before and the way it seems fake, always made it great. In this movie, when she starts to whip her hair around, it's CG looking (but once again this does not hurt it), until it hits the person. For instance on one scene it's got Lu Yan grabbing her hair and looks totally fake, but at the same time amazing. It felt like a throwback to some of the older movies. Man I loved it.

Some people are complaining that this was too kiddy. Well, I can see where they are coming from because there isn't a deep story here. It did feel like it was more geared towards a `not really having to think about it' crowd. And you know what. GOOD. I don't always have to think about stuff when I'm watching a good action flick. I actually had a blast watching this because I think if it took itself to seriously, most of the fight scenes would have been `eye rolling' instead of fantastic.

In the end I would say grab this movie up as soon as you can and sit the kids down with a large Papa Johns pizza and have a fun time.

P.S.  The way the story was set up, with the kid going from reality into an almost storybook tale, to come back into reality with things he learned... it sort of makes me think of The Never Ending Story but with Kung-Fu instead of a gigantic flying dog.",1210118400,54,4114,4.23469387755102

He's better off staying far away from him though and just making another movie like this. The kid in the movie is likeable too I should add.

3342701,5,B0013FZUQK,"You can't please everyone.  Jackie Chan knows this quite well as the East-West Culture Clash demonstrates itself with each of his movies released.  Jackie didn't have high expectations for this movie either, as it was tailored to the American audience.  He may have a point.

As it is, I can say that this film is a great family action flick.  It's directed by Rob Minkoff, who gave us The Lion King and the Stuart Little flicks, so he knows how to make a strong family film.  The story is very loosely based on the Chinese classic Journey To The West with snippet add-ons from other old kung-fu films, the most obvious being the Bride with White Hair.

The story has our main character, played by Michael Angarano, suffering a combination of near-death experience & time travel back to Ancient China to help return a magical staff to the legendary Monkey King.

It COULD be a time travel story as he is in Ancient China and is magically gifted with the ability to speak Chinese, as he can understand it only after encountering Jackie Chan's Drunken Immortal character.

It COULD be a near-death experience as the costuming and art style of the setting & characters is a bit more ""cleaner"" and stylized than I've seen in other old-period movies.  This would imply it's the main character's interpretation of Ancient China.  The White-Haired Assassin looks to me to be an obvious take on the Bride With White Hair.  Little things like American money in Ancient China and words of wisdom given are from other kung-fu films and martial art greats.

The meeting of Jackie & Jet Li works out very well.  Although wire-work is now becoming a normal staple in a lot of martial arts films, Jackie's reputation for not using it in his fight sequences are still in effect.  The wire-work is there for some stunts for the story - Jackie jumps over armed soldiers as he plays an immortal/god/buddha - but all his fights are solidly on the ground and very well done, especially with Jet Li.  Jet Li, on the other hand, has little qualms about using wires as it's reflected on his character - the opening fight moves has a sitting Jet Li stopping Jackie from taking the staff with BOTH legs grabbing onto it.  How was Jet Li sitting on the ground?  It was out-of-frame!  Nevertheless, the fight still remains spectacular.

The film overall can be regarded as a kung-fu fantasy and a better made one than a lot of others over the years.  I suspect the Asian market may not care for it, as America-Asia films cross the cultural border very poorly - Disney's Mulan going to mainland China comes to mind, as well as Jackie's Drunken Master 2 coming to America.  And Drunken Master 2 is my favorite!

Don't be too hard on the type of movie that Jackie & Jet agreed upon to star together in.  It appeals to the broadest amount of people, children in particular, and showcases them in their best light.  Besides, can you see them doing a Lethal Weapon remake?  Star Wars?  The Godfather?

3342702,4,B0013FZUQK,"I have a confession to make: I'm new to the gravity-defying martial arts genre. I've never seen ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or ""House of Flying Daggers"" or ""Fearless"" or any of the old standards starring Bruce Lee. Heck, I've never even seen anything starring Jackie Chan and Jet Li. So it's quite possible that I'm ill suited to review ""The Forbidden Kingdom,"" a movie that blends martial arts with family-friendly comedy and lots of cool special effects. I will say that the film generally achieved what it wanted to achieve, and I was certainly entertained all throughout. I'll also say that the story is a watered-down retread of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" about as light and airy as a flying Kung Fu master. But I guess story isn't important here; it's all about choreographed action sequences and how many can be crammed into place.

The film is book-ended by present day sequences taking place in Boston, where young Jason Tripitikas (Michael Angarano) lives for Hong Kong martial arts movies. That's essentially all we know about him, which is kind of annoying. The best we're given in terms of development is that he lives with his (unseen) mother and never knew whom his father was. Be that as it may, the film begins with Jason visiting a thrift store owned by Old Hop (Chan), a man who looks about as ancient as China itself. After looking through a stash of bootlegged Asian DVDs, Jason wanders into a back room and notices an ornate golden staff, which, according to Hop, was in the store when his grandfather opened it 100 years ago. Apparently, someone special will one day enter the store and reclaim the staff.

After Jason leaves, he's bullied by a group of thugs into getting them into Hop's store. Their robbery attempt goes wrong, and Jason grabs the staff before being chased to the roof; the thugs don't have a chance to kill him because the staff magically transports him to Ancient China, where he wakes up dressed as a monk. He walks around in confusion, not knowing where he is or how he got there, and what's worse, he doesn't speak any of the Chinese dialect everyone else is speaking. That problem is conveniently solved as soon as he meets Lu Yan (also played by Chan), who saves Jason from a group of warriors trying to take the staff: when Jason says, ""I can't understand what you're saying,"" Lu replies in English, ""That's because you're not listening!"" From then on, absolutely everyone is able to speak fluent English.

Lu--a drunken immortal who downs jug after jug of wine (supposedly an elixir)--tells Jason of an old prophecy: a traveler will deliver the staff to the Monkey King (Jet Li), a mischievous immortal who sent it away when another immortal--the warlord of the evil Jade Army (Collin Chou)--challenged him to a duel and deceived him. As protection, the Monkey King encased himself in stone over 500 years earlier, and it's there that he awaits the return of his staff. The only one who can free him is Jason, but in order for that to happen, he must learn the ways of Kung Fu. Only when he accomplishes his given task can he return to his own time and place.

They soon meet Golden Sparrow (Liu Ye Fei), an orphaned young woman who refers to herself in the third person and has a vendetta against the Jade Warlord. They also meet the Silent Monk (also played by Jet Li), who has apparently been seeking the seeker for quite some time. As they all travel across China to the fabled Five Elements Mountain, both the Lu and the Silent Monk take it upon themselves to teach Jason the art of Kung Fu, which will be a long and arduous process. Unfortunately, the Jade Warlord has learned of their plans and sends a bounty hunter to retrieve the staff; here enters Ni-Chang (Li Bing Bing), a nimble assassin who's deadly with a whip and even deadlier with her long, white hair. Should she succeed, the Jade Warlord has promised her a powerful elixir that can bestow immortality.

I've been describing the specifics of the story, but make no mistake--""The Forbidden Kingdom"" is all about the fight scenes, which are initially spread evenly but become wall-to-wall by the time we reach the climactic final battle. Each fight is beautifully choreographed and a lot of fun to watch, so much so that the story felt more like an afterthought. The same can be said for the sense of humor, which is certainly not necessary despite being a pleasant distraction. I obviously can't say that martial arts films are supposed to work this way, since this is the first one I've ever seen.

Still, I have a feeling that director Rob Minkoff was intentionally aiming for something less substantive and more entertaining, which in this case is not a criticism; at times, we actively seek escapist films like ""The Forbidden Kingdom,"" and I think Minkoff knew that all along. But as I said at the beginning, I may be out of my league here. As someone who has never experienced the visual splendors of a martial arts film, I don't know if ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" is better or worse than anything that came before it. Then again, comparisons are rarely useful for reviewing a movie--one should judge it on its own terms. On that note, I'll say that ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" is good-looking movie with lots of enjoyable stunts and an insubstantial story. That's pretty much what I expected going into it, so I have to give credit where credit is due.",1208822400,2,5369,4.6761904761904765

The tale that weaves through ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" is a fantastical and light-hearted love letter to many Chinese legends and martial arts movie traditions.  (The story is very loosely based on the classic Chinese epic ""Journey to the West"").  I absolutely loved it.

Jackie Chan and Jet Li give great acting performances as usual.  What surprised me was how good the fight scenes were despite the light-hearted nature of the film.  The major fight scene between Li and Chan was lengthy and magnificent.  The two friends genuinely seem to enjoy interacting with one another on a physical, as well as dramatic level.

This movie is so much fun.  Not nearly as serious as some of the two kung fu masters' previous movies.  I initially was a little bit worried about the apparent family-friendly nature of the film but it turns out all my worries were unfounded.  I think the levity and light-hearted nature of the film actually works in its favor and in hindsight seems to be the perfect choice for a first film bringing these two superstars together.

Both have become international superstars, both have an excellent repertoire with martial arts, both have played Wong Fei Hung (Jackie Chan in Drunken Master (1978) and Jet Li in Once Upon A Time In China (1991)), but neither have the ever appeared in a film together.  The reasons are sundry and probably have to do with past egos, but better late than never (Spielberg, it is not too late to hire either one of these actors).  Though imagine what could have been made in the late 80s with these two.

What had me most concerned with this film was that it is centered on a milquetoast Hong Kong Shaw Brother's film fanatic Jason Tripitikas (Michael Angarano: Sky High (2005)) who spends his time buying bootleg VCD/DVDs in Chinatown and being bullied by weenie local thugs.  Though this might hit the demographic of many martial art film fans, I was ambivalent about its use of a focal point away from Jackie or Jet.  Both of these actors can carry a film and the insertion of Tripitikas felt superfluous and relegated this movie to young teen-movie status.  His performance was OK though, just nothing that special.

Tripitikas visits his normal Chinatown shop (mentioning Ten Tigers from Kuangtung (1980)) owned by a raspy voiced Old Hop (Jackie Chan in old-man makeup; thank god he did not become a Mr. Miyagi clone) and notices an exquisite staff.  Old Hop states that he is waiting to return it to its rightful owner.  Later, Jason acquiesces to the gang (about as scary as The Backstreet Boys) and helps them rob Hop.  Things go badly as Hop gets shot and just as Jason is about to die he gets transported into a different realm (through the gate with no gate).

Luckily, this is where the story gets more interesting partially because less emphasis is put on the teen and more on the environment and new characters.  Jason meets Lu Yan (Jackie Chan: though this character is more like the King of Beggars aka Beggar So played most famous by Simon Yuen in Drunken Master (1978)) whose uses drunken kung fu.  Jason learns that he must return the staff to free the Monkey King (Jet Li) who was tricked into being turned to stone by the Jade War Lord (Ngai Sing:  Fearless, Flash Point (2007)) and caused 500 years of unhappiness under his realm.  However, there is a prophecy of an outsider who will return the staff and restore order (yes a chosen one, guess who that is). Ultimately, the chosen one team up with Golden Swallow (Liu Yi-Fei: yes the same name as the character in Come Drink with Me) who is also out for revenge against Jade War Lord who ruthless killed her family and a wandering monk (Jet Li).

I enjoyed the film for what is was.  A nondescript lead does not help with the film as a whole, but there is much to like.  The action choreography of Yuen Woo-ping (Hero, Drunken Master) is quite good partially because he has worked before with Jet Li and Jackie Chan.  He knows exactly their aging limitations and makes the wire-work look beautiful.  The fight scene between Jackie and Jet is a must watch for action fans and exquisitely beautiful.  When comedy was applied it worked well.  Two of these scenes stood out for me and had the audience laughing with my favorite of the two is when Jackie and Jet used Jason as an unwilling puppet while both masters trying to teach him gung fu.  It is nice seeing Jet Li have a fun time with his characters.  The other highlight of the movie is the penultimate fight scene between just about everybody including the Monkey King and a very pissed off hired killer -- the White Haired Assassin (Lee Bing-Bing) She is an homage to The Bride With White Hair (1993) which is also mentioned earlier in the film.

The film is a hodge-podge of Asian stories with the main plot is taken from the Ming Dynasty story ""Journey to the West"" (published anonymously and is foretold with an showing early in the film of, I believe but not positive since I was partially distracted at the time, Cave of the Silken Web (1967)) and put in a Wizard of Oz (1939) outline.  There are some problems with the cohesion of the story, a nondescript lead and several plot problems exist, but it does not distract too much unless you are adamant about your adaptations being faithful.  Rob Minkoff's direction (Stuart Little (1999), Haunted Mansion (2003)) is good, but I would have liked a more action-oriented director helming this project.  I think most martial art film fanatics will be slightly disappointed by this film, but many will enjoy this movie for what it is - entertainment with a couple of excellent choreographed martial art scenes.

Let us hope that Jet Li and Jackie Chan get together again and get to be the main characters.

The fight sceen between Jet Li and Jackie was really good but the dialog was awful!! I also have to add that the kid in this movie to me took away from the movie. Couldn't they have found someone better to play the part of the messenger? Is it me or did this kid suck big time?

All in all go see this movie if you are a fan like I am you'll be mad at yourself if you don't. Hopfully maybe Jet and Jackie may team up again.",1208736000,,645,3.6
3342707,4,B0013FZUQK,"While Jackie Chan and Jet Li seem like a no-brainer and the only question is ""What took so long?"", it took a lot to finally get these two together. After a thinly-veiled Jackie Chan ripoff character in one of Jet Li's earlier movies was taken as an insult by Chan, all talks of the two appearing together were killed. Now, over a decade later they are finally on screen together. The result? Not that bad, but not as good as it could have been.

For his age, Chan can still move. Unfortunately, his ""no wires"" policy is gone in recent films. Since this is sort of a period piece, you can understand that (most of these movies have the characters doing impossible things anyway). Both Chan and Li have dual roles in the movie (Chan doubles as the old man in the pawn shop and the drunken fighter, while Li is the Monkey King and the monk). And yes, there is a nice long fight scene between the two in the middle of the film. Plenty of action throughout, actually.

So why not give this a five-star rating? A couple of things. First, this would have been SO much better if it had been made ten years ago when both men were moving like lightning. Second, while I understand they both love period piece movies, they would have been so much cooler if they'd done this in a modern-time setting with no flying around...just good fighting. Imagine a type of sequel to Jet Li's ""The One"" where he plays both the hero and villain, and Jackie Chan helps him. Or better yet, have Chan play another hero and villain character, then let the good version of each fight the bad version of the other. That way we would have seen them win AND lose to both. As it stands in this film, there's no clear winner and that was obviously done on purpose so as not to hurt either's box office draw or ego.

Don't get me wrong, this movie isn't a waste of time to watch. It's a fun way to spend an afternoon with the family. As long as you understand this is like a Karate Kid/Princess Bride crossover with kid appeal. Hopefully this will open the door for a future team-up and they'll take it to the next level.",1208736000,,2085,4.313775510204081
3342708,5,B0013FZUQK,"What can one say after watching a movie like this, except ""Awesome"".  From the beginning, you really don't know what to think, except for the fact that you recognize Jackie Chan as an old man in the shop.  You know that the kid getting bullied will have something to do with 'getting revenge' as it is with most kung fu movies.  Naturally, the real winners of the movie is Jet and Jackie with their legendary 'on screen' presence and their supernatural martial arts skills.  The story and the entire feel of the movie is done with a 'Lord of the Rings' like feel especially with the 'White Haired Witch' and the way the Jade Warlord dies in the end.  Overall, the entire movie, regardless of all of the magical screenplay, is a tribute to the martial arts and the greatness (and the danger) that can come from it.

Additional Note to Parent's:

The development of the boy's skills in the martial arts and what it does to empower him ever-so-increasingy throughout the movie is a testament to the true spirit of the martial arts and how it truly exists in real-life applications.  With that said, I believe that the youth who watch this movie will have a newfound inspiration to train in the martial arts, and only hope that there will be a proper teacher with enough wisdom and knowledge to guide with the right intention at the receiving end of that spectrum.",1208649600,,1360,4.567901234567901
3342709,4,B0013FZUQK,"So the commercials all promote Jackie Chan and Jet Li. What they neglect to do is mention, I dunno, the **main character** of the film, a young Boston kid named Jason Tripitikas (played by Michael Anganaro).

So the movie's basically a kid film. You have a reluctant hero who gets sent to a fantasy version of China, and along the way he learns martial arts and Eastern philosophy.

What did I like about it? The fight scenes are, for the most part, fantastic. They start off a little weak, get better over time, and then get absolutely fantastic when you have both Jet Li and Jackie Chan in the film. The fight scenes are weakest when there's too much CGI in them -- but most of them are purely physical, and quite good.

The Chinese fantasy aspects are authentic, if not accurate (much in the same way the HBO series Rome is not a completely accurate recounting of events, but an authentic recreation of the tone of ancient Rome). They throw in things like The Monkey King and his golden staff, soldier monks, drunken immortals and even The Bride With White Hair. And the Chinese philosophy, for those familiar with it, is spot on.

Jackie Chan and Jet Li are fantastic not only as fighters, but comedically as well. (There's a scene involving rain that had absolutely everyone in the theater laughing hard.) Anganaro puts in a surprising turn physically -- he looks like he got a lot of martial training. Yifei Liu is heartbreakingly lovely.

It's probably a little scary for young kids -- there is some intense violence in the beginning, for instance. And there are sappy moments, as you would expect for a kid's film. But it means well. I have to say that I had a bit of trouble making out the English of some of the Chinese actors sometimes, tho -- and I'm Chinese-American! I worry others might have even worse problems.

Still, overall, I liked it.",1208649600,77,1856,4.575301204819277

I think it is the only movie where Li and Chan Share screen time and fight each other. though the wire work was a little over done, the martial arts choreography was otherwise good.
my only complaint was the subtitles where out of sync. I am hard of hearing and subtitles are helpful to catch dialogue during parts of the movie when its hard to hear people talking or to clarify what is being said. the subtitles started out ok, but about halfway through, they became at least 5 -10 seconds out of sync with the audio.",1524441600,3,644,4.375
