2663946,5,B000IU3810,"My husband and I found these treasures a couple years ago, around Christmas time actually. My entire family watches it. There is always something new to see each time you watch. We have Animusic 1 and 2. My two year old will put this in our dvd player and ask for the ""nusic"" to play. I recommend this for anyone who loves music.
We are eagerly awaiting the release of Animusic 3",1291248000,,379,4.277777777777778
2663947,5,B000IU3810,"We received the first Animusic as a gift, and both my girls (ages 2 & 5) loved it.  After watching it so many times we decided we needed to buy Animusic 2 if only for our own sanity.  I have to admit they are both amazing videos and quite entertaining even after watching them 100 times.",1264464000,2,287,4.107142857142857
2663948,5,B000IU3810,"The concept behind Animusic makes for some great work. The songs are catchy and relatively simple, but the animation they produce is mesmerizing. These are the most intricate music visualizations that I know of. Each time you watch you'll find something different.

Animusic 2 takes the same concept as the first and runs with it. You can easily see the progression of the tools used to create it and the added details. Bonus features - great ones that are still joys to watch even after multiple viewings - abound on this feature-packed DVD.",1259539200,4,542,4.827956989247312

2663950,5,B000IU3810,"I stumbled across one of the Animusic trailors at a local science museum.  Took me a while to find out what it was called, who made it etc.  Bought Animusic 1 and 2, and love both.  Well, I grew up programming 6502 and 68000 processors :)  That may tell you where my infatuation comes from... Nevertheless, highly recommended and highly amusing (both volume 1 and 2).",1241827200,3,367,4.515151515151516
2663951,5,B000IU3810,Great for everyone no matter the age. Our 15 month old grandson loves to dance to it. When we start Animusic he stops what ever he is doing to watch. Our 6 year old grandson took it to school and shared it with his class. They all LOVED it.,1240272000,3,240,3.9183673469387754
2663952,5,B000IU3810,"Bought Animusic 2 for two different sets of G-Grandchildren, for Christmas.  They are all pre school age and loved it.  Their Mothers said they watched it over and over.  I already had Animusic 1 and 2, myself, and enjoyed them, many times.",1233964800,3,240,4.666666666666667
2663953,5,B000IU3810,"IF YOU ARE INTO MUSIC AND COMPUTER ANIMATION, THIS VIDEO IS A MUST HAVE. IT IS TRUELY AMAZING IN A 3D EFFECT. ON AN HD TV THIS IS TURELY UNBELIEVABLE.",1231200000,5,150,4.033333333333333
2663954,5,B000IU3810,"I first saw a clip of Animusic on a PBS special and was enthralled! I bought both of the DVDs the next day.
Like the first Animusic, number two takes creative settings and instruments that stretch the imagination to produce a total experience. Not just the music or the performance but the total package.
The graphics are so realistic that I even received a clip of one of the songs via email under the premise that the musical machine had been designed by a team of MIT graduate students for their final project. The graphics are so well done that obviously many folks believed this premise.
It is very difficult to describe what Animusic and Animusic II really are unless you have seen at least a little clip of it. Basically, Lytle has graphically created a musical robot (a different theme for each song) that reproduces one sound or maybe one instrument. He combines all of these robots together to create the sometimes chaotic, sometimes serene, but always tightly assembled piece of music. Seeing what manner he used for each part of the song is like unwrapping a present little by little, layer by layer until the whole is revealed.
If you can, preview the DVD and see if it appeals to you. Both DVDs are similar in premise so if you like the preview, you will like the whole thing. If it's not for you, seeing the whole thing will probably not change your mind. However, every single person I have shared these DVDs with has loved them.",1231113600,8,1445,4.583011583011583
2663955,5,B000IU3810,"They're ALIVE!  The instruments come to life on your TV as they play to some great music.

An amazing idea!  Great music set to awesome graphics.  Think: computer geek meets music freak - they bash ideas around, get serious about the ideas, compose some great music and set AWESOME computer animation to the music.

The music alone plays on our TV throughout the afternoon when my 9 year old has his way.  He could watch this DVD and listen to the music all day long.

The tracks are varied in their music style, from stadium rock, to techno pop, to chamber music, and all of the music is tasteful, well written.

The graphics are perfect.

I can't wait for Animusic III!",1224028800,19,671,4.479338842975206

2663957,5,B000IU3810,I like this version more than the first one.  My niece watches it over and over every time she comes to visit and I need to get her one of her own.,1379289600,,147,3.59375

2663959,5,B000IU3810,I really enjoyed Vol. 2 but I feel Vol. 1 was better.  I enjoy them both and I play them for guests when they come to visit.,1359676800,,124,3.5925925925925926

2663961,4,B000IU3810,"hile this disk was interesting, I was actually looking for volume 2, nit the second release of volume 1. for instance, the string section was the same piece as release 1. This disc was wortht the price, but I am looking forward to volume 2.",1352937600,,240,4.355555555555555
2663962,5,B000IU3810,"I absolutely love it. I played it on Christmas for the family. My brothers and sisters are going to order it as well. Everytime a segment stopped, the baby grabbed the remote trying to restart it. Great family fun. Plan to order the others.",1326326400,,240,4.4772727272727275
2663963,5,B000IU3810,These videos really captured my sons attention immediately. This is a great kids video if you'd like to expose them to some excellent music and animation. Almost everyone is blown away by the production quality. I think you can get both videos for $30 on the animusic site.,1324598400,2,273,4.708333333333333
2663964,4,B000IU3810,"While most of these animated music videos are top quality and a real treat for the eyes and ears, they were still of lesser quality than the first video collection.

Pipe Dream, the favorite of the original Animusic, is merely rehashed here as Pipe Dream 2. The Pogo Sticks (my personal favorites from the first video) make a welcome return, with some glow in the dark friends. The weakest entries were Resonant Chamber (a creepy and out-of-place guitar/wooden spider fusion), Cathedral Pictures (I don't like religious music or themes), and Gyro Drums. The rest are decent, particular Fiber Bundles. The intricate and perfectly timed light bundles glow with ethereal beauty.",1303689600,,675,5.136363636363637
