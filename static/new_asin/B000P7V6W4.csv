2814495,4,B000P7V6W4,This show had some good reviews so I gave it a try.  There is some girl/girl action but most is solo scenes.  It is not as explicit as some shows but you get to see everything.  No complaints here.,1388361600,4,197,4.0
2814496,5,B000P7V6W4,"Never sure what to expect from Peach but most of releases from this era (2007, 2008) are consistently fair to good, with a few great ones thrown in the mix. This might be the best of the lot, and it certainly is the most explicit that I've seen.

Pretty obviously, this is a send-up of ""Sex in the City,"" where top-billed Melissa Jacobs blogs about her friends and their sexual experiences. Holy mother of God, Melissa leaves no holds barred. Unique-looking with a face best described as cartoonish, Melissa isn't afraid to show us anything and everything. I had been  leaning toward four stars for this release until the very last scene where Melissa generously throws her legs apart and gives us a few more lengthy, lingering looks at her...self.

She's featured naked in three separate vignettes, including one hot girl-on-girl scene. I have to add that,  too: I  don't typically care for girl-on-girl in any context, and the girl-girl Peach scenes tend to be maddeningly  dull, but the two on this DVD both really are hot. Never have seen that from Peach anywhere else. The second G-G scene is with Charlie Laine and Jennifer Emerson and HOLY  SMOKES it's the hardest thing that Peach ever put out, as far as I know.

The addition of solo scorcher Dae Daniels is a major positive. Why haven't I seen her in more of these releases? Wow, what a body! And unlike many other releases from this company, the videography doesn't screw things up!

The negative here is that things get started on a bad foot with a bizarre segment featuring Laine. We're thrown into her strip sequence very quickly, and continuing  with that  theme, for some reason it's sped  up to about twice the normal  speed. I have seen Peach slow video down before, but never speed it up like that. Laine is a hot number but we don't get much good out of her opening vignette. Hang on until the  end,  though...it's a doozy.

Very explicit (for Peach),  some of the  hottest stock offered  by this label, great voiceover acting by Jacobs, even some genuinely  funny moments and strong direction that  doesn't avoid  the  backside (or any other shots for that  matter). Not necessarily a pennant-winning grand-slam  by Peach, but a grand slam  nonetheless.",1379376000,8,2224,4.7265625
2814497,3,B000P7V6W4,"I bought it mostly because I like Charlie Laine who has two scenes.  The 1st is almost too dark & she's moving around pretty fast which makes it hard to get a good look at her, not that you can't.  The 2nd one is awesome.  Her breasts litterally glisten as she bathes with probably the worst of the 5 girls on the DVD.  There's one more than on the box & the one not pictured may actually be the 2nd best one IMO.

I didn't like most of them from the box cover but I liked them on the DVD better so if you like the DVD cover, you'll probably like the DVD since I think they look better than the cover might suggest.

Only 5 girls makes it a little hard to rate above 3 stars esp. when my favorite is only in 2 scenes but it's a good solid softcore video.  About the same risque factor as one of the later playboy video calendars with probably a LITTLE more focus on down below than Playboy which generally doesn't go there much esp. pre-2000.",1352419200,5,942,4.059459459459459
2814498,4,B000P7V6W4,"I saw this DVD at ""amazon.com"", and I always like to see more of Celeste Star at left on the box, and Charlie Laine at right isn't bad, so with two girls I like in it, I wanted to buy this DVD. Sexy Celeste is good in it, but she's better in some other DVDs. Dae Daniels, whom I hadn't seen before, has the sexiest scene in it. Jennifer Emerson and Melissa Jacobs just aren't my cups of tea, but many men like them. 3 gals I love to see out of 5 is a good score for such a DVD. I buy some and watch only one girl, but this one has Celeste, Dae and Charlie to keep me content.",1316044800,2,575,3.760330578512397

2814500,1,B000P7V6W4,"NOBODY SHOULD BUY THIS DVD......EVER!!!!  This thing sucked so bad for me.  I gues it is all about what you are into.  The write up makes it seem like this is a few sexy tales about some attractive ladies having wild nights, when in reality, it is a commentary while some young ladies dance around and strip.  There is not a single guy that appears anywhere in the feature.  This was bogus and I would not recommend it to anyone.",1204243200,5,429,4.3125

8189774,1,B000P7V6W4,"I was sold on this after reading some of the other reviews. Really not sure what those people were watching because this one went straight in the shredder. Horrible lighting, annoying sound track and washed up skanks. This one isn't even worth the cost of shipping...which was free.",1395964800,,282,4.895833333333333
8189775,4,B000P7V6W4,"In Lust in the City you join star Melissa Jacobs as she takes you on a lusty tour of the City with her friends Charlie Laine, Celeste Star, Jennifer Emmerson and Dae Daniels. DVD features include a Photo Gallery of the sexy vixens of Lust in the City and Trailers of other Peach DVD releases for your future adventures in fantasy land.

I found the DVD to have a softer look to the video, as if the Contrast and Brightness were not adjusted properly, but still quite viewable on a HDMI DVD Upscaler and 16x9 Toshiba TV although I keep my backlight/brightness turned down below 50% as it adds years to your TV. There are also signs of interlacing, as if the filter didn't a great of a job and left behind some soft lines, a 'yadif' filter would have been a better choice as it's probably the best there is. I think a yadif filter (instead of what was used), and Contrast/Saturation kicked up a notch would have made quite a nice quality than what is presented. My TV does a great job of stretching a 4:3 (1.33:1) to fill the screen as I'm pretty sure this is presented in standard 4:3 ratio; which isn't much of an issue considering the films age (2007) and content. I'm nit-picking at this point, they're non-issues really.

This is Softcore by nature with little to no plot, but; Peach doesn't cheat you by not showing the goods -- everything is in full. Face it, if you wanted plot and story, you would just watch Gone with the Wind right?. Think of it as Cinemax Late Night on Steroids and I think it may become clear as to what you will find.

This was my first venture into Peach territory and I'm quite satisfied with the results of my adventure. I will most definitely be back for more Peaches. So join Melissa in Lust in the City as she takes you on a ride down into southern territory and builds you up until you fire your Cannon!.",1395100800,2,1840,4.343023255813954
