The songs are ok (from an educational standpoint), but the story is a bit corny.  It's fine though and many kids enjoy it.",1260662400,,254,4.361702127659575
3026218,5,B000YDKA1C,"My son loves this double dvd.  When he wakes up in the morning the first thing he wants to do is watch ""shongs"" and he sings and dances along with every tune.  He also loves the Fiesta dvd  and sings along with those songs as well.",1252108800,3,231,3.9782608695652173
3026219,5,B000YDKA1C,"The DVD was purchased for my twin grandchildren Alessandra and Jameson. It came to our attention when they received their first haircuts, the stylist played it for them to settle them down and they were totally enchanted with it and the haircuts were a success.  My son related that story to me and I in turn looked all over for the DVD and found it on Amazon. Highly recommend this DVD, it is fun, exciting and thoroughly enjoyed by one and all.

8232046,5,B000YDKA1C,There are so many great Sesame Street DVDs to choose from that it's hard to decide but you get a 2 for one bonanza with this one. It's fun and energetic. I love to watch my 3 year old sing and dance along to all of his favorite classic characters!,1482537600,,247,3.96

8232048,4,B000YDKA1C,"This isn't my son's favorite Sesame Street DVD, but he did watch parts of it.  I think it was more annoying for us (as parents) to listen to it.  haha.  He does prefer the sing-a-long DVD's more so that's why I bought it.",1367366400,,221,4.093023255813954
8232049,2,B000YDKA1C,"I was a bit disappointed when I selected this video.  The advertisement at the beginning and/or ending of Sesame Street videos.  They were dancing and it seemed very lively.

That is not what you GET when you play the dvd.  The colors are NOT as vibrant and some of the songs are quite boring.  I love learning and only give this a two because it does seem that they are attempting to teach Spanish numbers and some greetings in Spanish, which is suitable.  However, I did buy this video for the FUN that doesn't seem to exist very long in this dvd.

Unless, your child is being taught Spanish, I say SKIP.  FYI.",1325116800,,612,4.353982300884955
8232050,5,B000YDKA1C,"i originally set out to purchase the fiesta, but decided on this for the sing along feature. two year old granddaughter loves both and watches all the time.",1276387200,,156,4.607142857142857
8232051,4,B000YDKA1C,"My daughter was 15 months old when I got this and she loved the Fiesta DVD. It was very energetic and keeps her attentive. The songs are catchy not to mention she can learn some Spanish words. It's definitely great for babies that are energetic and likes happy songs. The ""Sing Along"" is more for an older Toddler. I'm hoping when she is older she'll like that one too. But for now she loves the Fiesta and she can watch it over and over again.",1274918400,,444,4.235294117647059
8232052,5,B000YDKA1C,I bought this for my 2-year old niece and it is still really wonderful to sing these beautiful songs after all these years. A must have for toddlers.,1268006400,,149,4.357142857142857
8232053,5,B000YDKA1C,"We bought this for our 1 year old son.  He absolutely loves both of them.  He loves to watch singing and dancing, not so much talking.  Both of these constantly sing and dance.  Our son even dances with it!
Sing along includes the following songs:
John Jacob Jingle Himer Schmit
Old McDonald
Rubber Duckie
The Pigeon Walk
Cheer Up
Stand Up and Pinch Your Nose
An Echo Song
Sing, Sing a Song
What's the Name of That Song
We All Sing With the Same Voice
etc.

Fiesta has several songs teaching a few basic spanish words including numbers, weather, greetings, etc.

We love this double disk DVD.",1265932800,4,592,4.485981308411215
