8719565,4,B00Z710UAM,"Definitely a B movie, a bit surprised to see the ""A"" actors in a film like this. Sorbo for sure but Fonda is a has been and never was a very good actor in my opinion. I'll take a B western over a lot of big name movie more often than not.",1534636800,,238,3.5961538461538463
8719566,1,B00Z710UAM,"What a horrible mangled mess of a film this is. Badly written and directed even worse by Brett Kelly. It has no plot,half the crew are the cast and Peter Fonda looks like he was forced to repay a debt to someone.  This is the worst piece of dreck that Kevin Sorbo has heaped on his once respectful fanbase. No wonder he can't get anyone to invest in his projects,they are just bloody awful....",1450483200,,393,4.3108108108108105
8719567,4,B00Z710UAM,"In a story told mainly in flashbacks,J. Frank Dalton(Kevin Sorbo)claims to be the imfamous outlaw Jesse James. He is interviewed by the editor of the local paper and tells how he helped stop the Hoyt Killian gang from taking over a small town. Peter Fonda has a small role as the mayor of the small town. I thought Sorbo did a good job with the character and the dialogue he had to work with. The DVD cover would have you believe that Sorbo & Fonda have scenes together-that is not the case. Aside from that,this is a good movie and I would recommend it if you like westerns!",1444348800,2,575,4.333333333333333
8719568,1,B00Z710UAM,"The worse western in history. Stay away from it. The acting was a real bomb. The only..and I mean only good thing about it was the opening credits..using the GRAND CANYON as the opening..thinking this is going to be darn good. Even the music background was good..BUT my friends..that's it. Kevin Sorbo..a good actor tells the story..it's terrible. Peter Fonda must have needed lunch money..his role was terrible. All the actors were terrible..unbeliverable all the way. It's like if you take a vacation and you come across a western type town for visitors to watch a stunt actors falling off a building & speaking like their reading their lines..This has it. It's 71 minutes of a big bomb. Catch a real western like...""APPALOOSA"" with VIGGO MORTENSEN & ED HARRIS.....now that's a western! This is DOGFOOD!  ThankyouOh by the way..the jacket on JESSE JAMES LAWMAN...looks great..but don't judge it by the cover..it's a terrible,terrible,terrible western. And after it starts..it doesn't even take place near or around the GRAND CANYON at all.",1443139200,2,1041,5.123529411764705
8719569,1,B00Z710UAM,"I purchased this movie after seeing ""Shadow on the Mesa"" thinking it would be another good low budget western with Kevin Sorbo, however this was not the case. This movie is bad, really bad. Everything about this movie from the acting, directing, filming, to the costumes and props are terrible. Every scene from the opening credits to the point where you stop watching (Nobody will make it to the end) is worse then the one before it. The opening credits show a typical flyover of a canyon except instead of an actual flyover, it looks like the camera is hanging from a string filming the same area as it swings back and forth. The opening scene shows Kevin Sorbo as J. Frank Dalton being interviewed about his claim as to being the real Jesse James and is filmed on a small stage with unedited hollow sound. After this scene, the rest of the movie is a flashback using another actor as Jesse James. Kevin Sorbo is only in this movie long enough so they can legally put his name and picture on the cover. The guns have a very fake cap gun sound and the hand to hand fighting is ridicules. The props and staging are also terrible. The saloon is just a single table with a canvas hanging behind it painted to look like a wall. It goes without saying that the writing and acting are also horrible.
I usually enjoy a good low budget ""B"" movie and can appreciate what the filmmakers and actors can do with a limited amount of money. Many of these movies go on to become ""Cult Classics"". This on the other hand looks like the director was told that he could keep any money that he doesn't spend during the making of the movie. The whole thing looks like something a bunch of junior high school kids and their parents filmed in the backyard. Now as far as the actual story or what this movie is about. Does it really matter? You are not going to be able to make it thru it anyway.
So, if you want to see Kevin Sorbo in a western then buy or rent ""Shadow on the Mesa"" but avoid this garbage at all cost.",1442966400,4,1995,4.294429708222812
8719570,1,B00Z710UAM,"J.Frank Dalton (Kevin Sorbo) is being interviewed about his claim as to being the real Jesse James, whose death was faked. Dalton tells a far fetched tale where he cooperated with a lawman (Lawrence Evenchick) in order to take down Killian (John N.E. Hill) a local outlaw. Exactly how his death was faked was not mentioned in this film.

The movie was bad. The acting was super bad. The characters were stiff. Peter Fonda had a minor role as the mayor. Nice opening film of an owl and scenery.

Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

Historically there was a man named J. Frank Dalton who signed an affidavit claiming he was the actual Jesse James. He was interviewed and his story didn't wash with the relatives of Jesse James. In 1995 the body of Jesse James was exhumed for mtDNA testing, showing that Jesse James was indeed Jesse James and was killed by Bob Ford.",1442016000,,864,4.561290322580645
