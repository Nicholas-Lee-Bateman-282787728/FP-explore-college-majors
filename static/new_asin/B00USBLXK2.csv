7070742,3,B00USBLXK2,"This is a B movie from the 80s.
Doesn't make much much sense,
But I love Glenn Plummer in it.
It's different from his other work.
Not as good but he's the best thing in here.
Too bad he didn't get a larger part.",1463702400,2,211,3.8181818181818183

8708028,5,B00USBLXK2,"I saw this movie opening weekend on a date- I immediately knew it would be a cult classic. This copy is fine, however I've since found copies with more extras available (I had some on dvd back in the day). For the price, this is definitely worth it, Darlin'.",1520035200,,258,4.285714285714286

8708033,5,B00USBLXK2,"First, a short review of the movie.  If you haven't seen it, surely you've heard.  This movie is so bad, it's good. Actually, it's so bad it's bad.  But I love it anyway!  What a lot of people don't know is that the acting, especially Elizabeth Berkeley's, was intentionally amped up.  The director told them to overact. He thought that was the vibe that was needed for the film.  Well, he was wrong.  At least, if he wanted a hit.  I think with the right acting and toned down just a tad (or more) he may have at least broke even. But the direction he set them in resulted in one of the most campy, over-the-top productions ever to make it to theaters.  I don't know how any of them kept a straight face while saying their lines.  Lots of female nudity, one male butt shot, very in-your-face sex scenes and something rather disgusting I wish they'd left out. It involves menstruation. I'll stop there.  But it's a movie about Vegas, overindulgence, glitz and glam, and ambition.  Can't beat that, right?  If you're looking for an Oscar contender, look elsewhere.  If u just wanna have fun & maybe laugh at the actors instead of with them, this is your movie.  For me it's a must-own.
My movie arrived with the 2015 Blu-ray case but the 2010 anniversary edition disc.  I contacted Amazon & had a correct replacement in 2 days.  No need to return the other one.  Amazon is always top-notch!",1497398400,2,1389,4.46613545816733
8708034,4,B00USBLXK2,"Fair Movie, Blu ray plays well and crisp",1492473600,,40,4.125
8708035,5,B00USBLXK2,"Everyone said this movie was ""bad"" and ""unintentionally funny."" People are dumb. It's like, we recognize that Starship Troopers is an intentional satire. Yet everyone things Verhoeven here didn't know what he was doing?

This movie is fantastic. For real. As in, it's a good movie.",1467417600,6,281,5.108695652173913
