This new box gives you all five films for approximately $8.50 each at the current Amazon price.
A GREAT BUY if you are new to these films.
Less so if you already own one or two.
Fortunately, each film is packaged separately in it's own case, so you can sell the titles you don't need or want.

Five black and white films from the tail end (1951-1955) of the Film Noir era.
Not the greatest examples of the genre, but enjoyable nonetheless.
Great film noir casts.
""A Bullet for Joey"" looks like a couple of 1930's gangsters caught in a time warp: Edward G. Robinson versus George Raft,
Film noir icon Audrey Totter rounds out the cast.

The oldest film in this collection - ""He Ran All the Way"" (1951) - is presented in it's original 1.33 to 1 aspect ratio.
The remaining four are widescreen.
[1.85 to 1 for ""Storm Fear"", 1.75 to 1 for the remaining three.]
Trailers are included for each film, but no other extras.
No subtitles - my only real complaint.",1459382400,38,2080,6.9884615384615385

8753236,5,B01CJCQCB2,"Great movies.  Gift for my wife, a film noir fan.  Edward G., George Raft, John Garfield who died way too young and would've had a spectacular career.",1529884800,,150,4.518518518518518
8753237,3,B01CJCQCB2,"I gave it a ""3"" not because of the film, which are all excellent but the fact there is a lot of grain in the movies. The Blu Ray disks aren't HD as we think of HD today!",1529884800,,169,3.473684210526316
8753238,5,B01CJCQCB2,this isn't a product review only a fair warning to potential buyers hi brad I am going to receive the BLU-RAY set. today and for anyone that is considering a purchase of this set yes there are only 4 films in the standard set and if you click the link boxes BLU-RAY or standard the standard DVD only shows 4 films for about $8 dollars less. then the $40 blu-ray set because I almost made the same mistake but as I scrolled these commentaries I saw you'rs and re-edited my purchase,1522886400,3,480,4.285714285714286
8753239,1,B01CJCQCB2,"The DVD & Blu Ray sets are different as one has ""Big House USA"" and the DVD set does not !  This sucks as that was the one film I bought it for!

I did not realize the sets were different until I got it in the mail and would have paid a little more for Big House !  Even the packaging is different if you look close enough !",1513555200,3,324,3.6

8753241,5,B01CJCQCB2,Clearly a great buy and addition to my collection. Old noir and watching actors I admired when a child was a gift to myself. Watching black and white photography is never a disappointment. Always a surprise in the shadows,1500854400,2,221,4.6923076923076925
