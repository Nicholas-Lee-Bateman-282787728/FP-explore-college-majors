8480799,5,B005NW96SW,"""A Festa da Menina Morta"" was the first directorial work by actor Matheus Nachtergaele, who had already demonstrated his good acting talent in films as ""Amarelo Manga"", ""&Aacute;rido Movie"", ""City of God"" and ""Central Station"". Maybe it was this gift of his as an actor, what helped him to obtain remarkable performances from his cast, and not only from professionals as Daniel de Oliveira and C&aacute;ssia Kiss, but from the natural actors he directed. A reflection on people's mysticism, racism and the material and spiritual misery that motion pictures seldom risk to show, ""A Festa da Menina Morta"" reveals sordid anecdotes of the relationships between the leading characters, behind the magical thoughts that inspire a town in the middle of the Amazonian jungle. The story is simple: in the home town of the Dead Girl, people are about to celebrate the 20th anniversary of her cult, directed and conducted by O Santo or the Saint (Oliveira), a young, self-worshiping homosexual, with a volcanic temper, and an emotional life that includes a marital, sexual-active life with his father, and vague memories of his Caucasian mother. Close to him and his alcoholic, roguish father, are the devout women that keep the cult alive, and sensual Tadeu (Juliano Cazarr&eacute;), the Dead Girl's brother, who has lost his faith and is beginning to question the cult devoted to her, including the Saint's leadership. During the night of the feast, tensions and violent emotions grow, and an unexpected visit arrives, leading the story to a denouement in which the Saint's annual message to the devotees is an echo of his personal drama. Although the violence surrounding the story can erupt in any moment, one perceives Nachtergaele's affection for the characters, their customs and the story, an affection that moves the film away from manifestations of the so-called ""porno-misery"" that could have been generated. Nachtergaele had full control, opting for ethnographic observation that sometimes reduce dramatic action to a minimum, with fine support from cinematographer Lula Carvalho. Highly recommended.",1404345600,,2102,5.315315315315315
