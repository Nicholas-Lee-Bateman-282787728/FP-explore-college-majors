It is one of those rare finds that can be an easy-relaxing Sunday afternoon watch and then a second go-round there is still more to discover.  There is a reason why there is an indie-film industry and this is one of them.",1442448000,2,310,4.6

8612621,5,B00F680664,"I stumbled upon this film purely by word-of-mouth and was absolutely blown away.

I had no idea what I had gotten myself into when I chose to watch this. I only knew that it was a coming-of-age film about a young guy from a small town who wanted to experience more beyond the confines of his sheltered home. The realization that I was watching a story about a curious and driven person who was challenged to balance duty to his family, loyalty to his friends, and inherent need to forge his own path was an incredible shock that resonated to my core.
Moreover, I was also impressed by how this film skillfully portrayed delicate and complex issues including abandonment, domestic violence, and heartbreak in a way that truly felt organic and authentic.

It made me laugh. It made me sad. It made me reflect on my own past and I thoroughly enjoyed this thought-provoking film. This film is definitely an amazing piece of work and I absolutely recommend checking it out!",1402963200,3,968,4.654970760233918
8612622,5,B00F680664,"I saw Born And Raised, I loved the naturally of the performances, and the way the story was being told, helped you to understand and make you feel that you are part of the Film as well, the music by Jay Vincent is a perfect fit for the story, there's a balance between the movie and the music, and I think that's very important, Of course It's a must see movie, It's a very down to earth Drama, with no exaggerations, just straight to the point!

I Like the color of the film, every character grows into you, as the film evolves, its a very professional job, and definitely is a film that keeps your mind busy after watching it, it has its funny moments and heart touching parts as well.

Amazing cast and script, this is a living proof that, it is not needed a huge amount of money to make an amazing film.

A must see!",1397174400,,820,4.177215189873418
8612623,1,B00F680664,"I turned it off after the first 5 minutes.  vulgarity and crude language,  Not suitable for my audience.  Wouldn't recommend.",1390435200,,125,5.15
8612624,5,B00F680664,"My initial interest in this film came from discovering that it had been shot in Panama City, Florida. Having grown up there myself, struggling and finally succeeding in leaving, I felt a connection to the place as well as the characters.

After months of patiently waiting for the film to become available, I finally got the chance to see it, and it is wonderful. A well written story, beautifully performed and shot with great direction - There needs to be more quality films like this one.

Touching on topics ranging from broken families restoring ties to dealing with domestic violence, and the struggle to how to react to it appropriately, this film is filled with real life struggles, a mother afraid to let her son set out in the world, her own father having left when she was young, only to return years later, trying to reconnect with daughter and grandson.

Just as in life, this film pulls no punches when it comes to telling a story about not only how a young man comes into his own, but of how his family, friends and loved ones grow as well.

There's so much to say about the topics covered in this film, I can't cover them all without depriving you of the finer details.

If you find that you are offended by colorful language, violence, drinking, or smoking, then you might be bothered by this film, however, if you can accept that these things are part of daily life for many people, and try to view it as what it really is - A facet of a well thought out character, who's unique flavor lends to the tone of the film. The sense of honest humanity that this film brings to the table would be lacking otherwise, in my opinion.

My only complaint regarding this film was that I had hoped to have more readily identifiable locations in it. I've spent time at the Panama City Marina and at some of the smaller bars. As a former local, I had hoped for more of Panama City in the film, though I have no complaints about the locations used, I had secretly wished that it would be more like Ruby In Paradise, which had captured some of the beach from an era that has long passed.

Small disappointment aside, I really enjoyed the film, and I plan to buy a copy on bluray to support future films from the creators of this production.

I implore you to take heed of all the rewards and reviews this film has well earned for itself, and to spend a little time unwinding with this film. It will warm your heart and inspire your soul.",1389744000,5,2437,4.4
8612625,5,B00F680664,"Very well written and produced film with great actors. Enjoyed watching this film at the Film Festival, great story about a small country boy trying to find his way in the world and taking the necessary risk. Definitely worth watching!",1383350400,2,235,4.9

8612627,5,B00F680664,"After waiting a LONG time to see Born & Raised in its entirety, I can say the wait was worth it !  An honestly written coming of age story, with a great cast and gorgeous location.  Nick Loritsch shines as a young boy finding his way in the world.  Wish it was possible for Indie films such as this to make it to the big screen where it deserves to be!",1380585600,2,352,3.9295774647887325
