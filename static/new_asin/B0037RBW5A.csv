8390713,1,B0037RBW5A,"Even if I had spend only $5 on ""From Czars to Dictators"" it would have been a waste of money.  The video quality on this DVD is horrible.  You will find better video quality on YouTube.  Even video from after World War II is fuzzy, not just the really old pre-WWI footage.  The writing is geared towards elementary school teaching AND it is often wrong.  For example, according to this video the last Czar of Russia was Nicholas III.  Yes, the same Nicholas II that was murdered in 1918.  This DVD is so bad, Amazon or any vendor should be ashamed to even sell it.",1313280000,12,564,4.314285714285714
