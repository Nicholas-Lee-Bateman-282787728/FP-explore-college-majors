2961421,5,B000W4KSV0,"Arrest and Trial. Another good series that lasted only one season. I'd never seen this show but bought it because of the two lead actors. Chuck Connors and Ben Gazzara. This is a good show but not great. Maybe because of it's running time 74 minutes that the shows stories fail to be as gripping as it could be. But this series is not boring and has plenty going for it especially the guest stars. Actors like Richard Basehart,Leif Ericson James MacArthur and Tony Franciosa to name a few. I'm very happy to have seen this series. It's a pity it didn't last longer. I guess it was ahead of it's time as Law and Order which has the same format lasted for 20 years. Also this series has Don Galloway in it as one of the team before he became famous in another series as Sgt Ed Brown on Ironside.",1328400000,5,793,4.258278145695364
2961422,4,B000W4KSV0,"Sunday nights were special because my parents allowed me to stay up and watch ""Arrest & Trial.""  My favorite show will always be ""The Naked City"" because of the prolific scripts by American screenwriter Stirling Silliphant, the live setting of the New York streets, and the realistic characters Silliphant created.

""Arrest & Trial"" tried to copy that format in the first half and threw in a little ""Perry Mason"" in the second half.  I enjoyed the shows.  The first episode ""Call it a Lifetime"" with Anthony Franciosa as a truck driver turned cop killer, and Ben Gazzara as Sgt. Nick Anderson in hot pusuit is the hook for most of the show.  Shot in what looks like the Mohave Desert it's a cat and mouse with Franciosa evading capture only to be caught by Gazzara.  There's a human side to Sgt. Anderson in the second half: ""The Trial"" when he works with Defense Attorney John Egan (Chuck Connors)to give the truck driver/killer a second chance. This happens after they discover the circumstances that caused the accidental death of a motorcycle cop.

I enjoyed most of the episodes. Here's my gripe: the video and audio quality is not on par with other 1960s shows that have made it to DVD.  The back of TIMELESS VIDEO GROUPs DVD box states: ""This 10 DVD set containing all 30 episodes is faithfully reproduced from the ORIGINAL masters.  I know hollywood shot most TV shows on 35mm film stock using a Nagra reel to reel magnetic recorder to capture the actors dialog.  My question: What the hell happened to the original elements?  The original 35mm negative film stock and the Nagra tapes?

As an avid film collector in the 1970s I was fortunate to find some old 35mm network prints and had them in my collection. I know the three major networks: ABC, CBS and NBC ran these 35mm prints when the shows first aired.  When the shows went into syndication they copied them down to 16mm making them easy to send to various TV stations in the states.  Here's the problem -  16mm prints have poor, grainy video image, and the soundtrack is usally distorted, overmodulated, and scratchy.

TIMELESS VIDEO GROUP copied old 16mm televison prints (many times you can see the cement splices, scratches and que marks - from various editors in telecine rooms who placed their local ads into these shows) and claim they are reproduced from the ORIGINAL NBC masters!

Timeless always runs that little blurb stating that their prints have been carefully selected from archival films using state of the art technology to present the highest quality production. However there might be some imperfections in image and sound quality that are unavoidable.  Hey Timeless!  If you had actually used the original 35mm negatives and Nagra tape elements they would have been avoidable!  They must have an old film collector who owns all the 16mm prints, full of scratches, splices, and lousy sound that they've released so far.  The old Lee Marvin ""MSquad"" show was a real ""beaut!"", but this set of ""Arrest & Trial"" and quote: ""faithfully reproduced from the original NBC masters"" is a flat out lie!",1326931200,23,3075,4.785984848484849

2961427,1,B000W4KSV0,"Don't buy this video if you are a Chuck Connors fan, eg. from the Rifleman days which is why I bought it.  Chuck is hardly in it and he doesn't appear until half or more than half the episode is over. He seems stiff and uncomfortable playing a lawyer. (at least how he thinks a criminal defense lawyer should be played)  I'm not a Ben Gazzara fan at all so this was a waste of money and I didn't watch all the videos.",1242259200,4,417,4.0120481927710845
2961428,3,B000W4KSV0,"The 30 episodes (all in B&W) of the 90-minute crime drama ""Arrest and Trial"" originally ran on ABC during its 1963-1964 broadcast season.  This three-disc DVD set includes nine of the episodes: #3, #4, #7, #11 (guest starring Martin Sheen and Michael Parks), # 15 (guest starring Mickey Rooney), #21, #22 (guest starring Nick Adams), #23, #30; seemingly taken at random from the series.

The series was an innovative concept as it was essentially broken down by the words in its title.  During the first 45 minutes of each episode LA detective Nick Anderson (Ben Gazzara) would solve the crime, arrest the perpetrator(s), and hand them over for trial.  The second half concerned defense attorney John Egan's (Chuck Connors) attempts to get them acquitted.

That Egan was for the defense and not the prosecution was what made the series unique.  Guilt or innocence thus became a relative term.  With better writing it could been a great series (think ""Hill Street Blues"" where the public defender is involved in a romance with the Precinct Captain).  Unfortunately rather than actually working in opposition to each other, most of the episodes featured little if any interplay between Anderson and Egan.  So what you got was more like a 45-minute cop show followed by a 45-minute lawyer show; with the only point in common being the same guest star(s); whose character might just as well have had different names for all it would have mattered.

The series tried to hold the cop show fans over for the second half by ingeniously breaking the show at the quarter hour when it was too late to change channels and watch something else.  It must not have worked very well because the ratings were too low to support a second season.

Gazzara was excellent but Connors was horribly miscast.  Most likely someone who is seeing Connors' various shows for the first time is mystified than he got so much television work in 1960's.  All I can say is that a lot of people were just as mystified then.

Bottom line, despite its flaws the uniqueness of the series makes it well worth a look today.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1205280000,5,2132,4.75
2961429,5,B000W4KSV0,"For those discriminating viewers who want to see top-flight TV drama from the heyday of the medium (1955-65) do yourself a favor and order this fantastic three-volume set, ""Arrest and Trial.""  Nine 74 minute shows are included in this reasonably priced compilation.  Ben Gazzara (Det. Sgt. Nick Anderson) and Roger Perry (Det. Sgt. Dan Kirby) bring the perceived lawbreakers to trial in the first 35-40 minutes; John Larch (Deputy Dist. Atty. Jerry Miller) and John Kerr (Asst. Deputy Dist. Atty. Barry Pine) then try the state's case, with the defendant most-often represented by Chuck Connors (John Egan).  When the show aired in the fall of 1963, ABC sunk a tremendous amount of money into the development of the 90-minute series; to that end they did their best to sign on two or three ""name"" actors for every episode.  These actors included Roddy McDowell, Mickey Rooney, Katherine Ross, Howard Duff, James Whitmore, Marlo Thomas, Leo Gordon, Tony Franciosa, Martin Sheen, Steve Forrest, Neville Brand, Robert Webber, Vera Miles, Clu Gulager, Telly Savalas, Dorthy Malone, MacDonald Carey, Julie Adams, Jack Klugman, David Carradine, Dennis Hopper, Richard Basehart, William Shatner, Richard Carlson, Nick Adams, Barry Sullivan, and Oscar-winners Robert Duvall, Kim Hunter, and Martin Balsam -- a darn good line-up of guest stars for a 30-episode run!  Watch these shows along with episodes of ""The Defenders"" (E.G. Marshall and Robert Reed, if you can find any copies), ""The Naked City"" (Paul Burke, Horace MacMahon, Nancy Malone), and ""East Side, West Side"" (George C. Scott), and you'll see just how far we've fallen in the production and presentation of television drama since the mid-60's.  The prints of the ""Arrest and Trial"" episodes in this set appear to be 16mm and contain the expected specks and occasional streaks you'll find in 40+ year-old film -- but really the video and audio quality is quite good.  Special thanks to Timeless Media Group and Universal for allowing these outsanding shows to be seen again.  Here's hoping more compilations of ""Arrest and Trial"" will be forthcoming.

2961430,4,B000W4KSV0,"During the Fall of 1963, a new police and lawyer show debuted on ABC.  Titled ""Arrest and Trial,"" this unique show was made for a 90 minute time slot.  The first half of the show featured the ""Arrest,"" with detectives Ben Gazzara and Roger Perry gathering the evidence and apprehending the suspect.  The ""Trial"" portion starred Chuck Connors aided by Don Galloway as defense attorneys, with John Larch and John Kerr as prosecutors from the district attorney's office.  Sound familiar?

There's no question that the basic structure and format of ""Arrest and Trial"" influenced the modern ""Law & Order.""  But there's a major difference in the two shows.  ""Law & Order"" is, essentially, a well written and acted police and judicial procedural.  ""Arrest & Trial,"" while retaining many of the procedural elements, is much more of a character study of the accused and those around him - friends and family - and how law enforcement and the judicial system affect their lives.  Disc 2 of the set represents the series well and features three episodes dealing with the theme of addictions:  Mickey Rooney is a drug addict accused of murder; Nick Adams embezzles money from his employer to pay for his gambling habit; Dewey Martin is a paroled convict dealing with alcoholism who has a difficult time adjusting to the outside world.

The series was produced during the era of the early to mid-1960s when the bar for televised drama was set very high with shows like ""Route 66,"" ""The Fugitive,"" ""Combat!,"" ""The Defenders,"" ""Naked City"" and others sharing the primetime airwaves.  ""Arrest and Trial"" shares the superior writing, acting, and direction of those other shows.  So why wasn't it a hit?  One reason may have been its odd running time - 90 minutes - rather than the standard 60 minute format for most televised dramas of the era. But there were other shows that ran for 90 minutes during the 1960s like the Westerns ""The Virginian,"" ""Cimarron Strip,"" and, for a time, even ""Wagon Train.""  More probably, it had to do with the competition.  Broadcast by ABC on Sundays from 8:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., ""Arrest and Trial"" went head-to-head with the second half of ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" and ""The Judy Garland Show"" on CBS, while NBC offered ""Grindl"" and the second longest running Western in TV history ""Bonanza.""  Sadly, ""Arrest & Trial"" was cancelled after only a single season of 30 episodes.  Co-stars Gazzara and Connors would move on to more successful series, ""Run for Your Life"" and ""Branded,"" respectively.

This release of ""Arrest and Trial,"" as well as several other DVD releases from the Timeless Media Group, is the product of a unique licensing arrangement that Timeless has with NBC Universal.  In a cost cutting measure, Universal is only licensing the use of the episodes to Timeless; it is not providing restored or remastered prints to Timeless.  Instead, Timeless is assembling episodes on its own using 16 millimeter films from collectors and other sources.  As a consequence, the prints utilized for this release are far from perfect, often exhibiting scratches, dirt and other imperfections.  While this may not be the most ideal way to release a television series on DVD, the prospective purchaser of ""Arrest and Trial"" needs to consider the rarity of this series and the likelihood of a better release.  Frankly, this was a series that I believed would never see a DVD release, and so I'm appreciative that a DVD releasing company would take a risk on such a comparatively obscure series.  Each of the three discs contained in this box set contains three episodes, with episodes running in the 75 to 76 minute range, so you're getting a representative sampling of nine of the thirty episodes that were produced.  There are no extra features included on this release.

The quality of the writing, acting, direction, and overall production transcend a flawed visual presentation.  I can very easily recommend this to vintage TV fans and anyone who appreciates a quality televised drama, but videophiles will have numerous issues with this release and are probably best advised to steer clear.  ""Arrest and Trial"" as a series merits five stars, but subtract a star for the lesser visual quality.",1195084800,65,4210,4.940340909090909

""Law and Order"" follows the same format, except the trial segment in Arrest and Trial is from the Defense's viewpoint. Still, the prosecution lawyers are integral to the conclusion, and make counter-points that add balance to an issue. The shows are also very good sources for experiencing cultural beliefs and practices of the time, as well as witnessing how some of the artifacts were thought of and used.",1383436800,4,741,5.073770491803279

2961438,4,B000W4KSV0,"Sometimes melodramatic, but intelligent and very well acted early 1960s U.S. TV series, that obviously served as the inspiration
for ""Law & Order"".

Like ""L & O"" this is divided into 2 parts; ""Arrest"" where cop Ben Gazzara tracks down the person seemingly guilty of that
week's crime and ""Trial"" where Chuck Connors defends them.

Having the 2nd half be from the defense point-of-view, not the prosecutor's makes the show different than ""Law and Order"",
and arguably more interesting. It makes blatant how much of the legal system exists in shades of grey.

It's not surprising that Ben Gazzara is very, very good as cop Nick Anderson, making him more complex and interesting than
your basic TV detective of the era. What caught me off-guard was that Connors as successful attorney John Egan, just about
matches him. Unlike Gazzara, Connors was never taken that seriously as an actor,. But he shows a lot here as a top notch,
somewhat cynical lawyer. Beyond the two leads, the guest casts were often very strong as well.

It's partly because these were 90 minutes episodes on TV, so each show runs about 75 minutes of screen time, as opposed to the
standard TV drama that runs an hour, which means about 45-60 minutes of actual story. With the extra time, the writers fleshed
out the characters, both regulars and guests, much more fully than on most non-serialized dramas.

So even if there are plot or logic holes (like charging a man with 1st degree murder, instead of a much more logical 2nd degree or
manslaughter, so the trial can be about the issue of ""intent"" ) it feels more like you're watching a solid, well acted B-film each
episode, instead of an early TV series. And the series has a nice mix of dark edginess and humanism.

Yes, the score can be painfully over-the-top, and some of the resolutions are too neat, but I'd still say this holds up favorably to a
lot of the modern U.S. character cop and/or lawyer shows of today.

Sadly, the quality of the transfers leaves a lot to be desired. I read elsewhere they were transferred from old 16 mm prints, and
they do look it: washed out, full of print damage, missing opening credits. But it's nowhere near fatal to enjoying this

(at least how he thinks a criminal defense lawyer should be played)  I'm not a Ben Gazzara fan at all so this was a waste of money and I didn't watch all the videos.",1242259200,4,417,4.0120481927710845
3195925,3,B000W4KSV0,"The 30 episodes (all in B&W) of the 90-minute crime drama ""Arrest and Trial"" originally ran on ABC during its 1963-1964 broadcast season.  This three-disc DVD set includes nine of the episodes: #3, #4, #7, #11 (guest starring Martin Sheen and Michael Parks), # 15 (guest starring Mickey Rooney), #21, #22 (guest starring Nick Adams), #23, #30; seemingly taken at random from the series.

The series was an innovative concept as it was essentially broken down by the words in its title.  During the first 45 minutes of each episode LA detective Nick Anderson (Ben Gazzara) would solve the crime, arrest the perpetrator(s), and hand them over for trial.  The second half concerned defense attorney John Egan's (Chuck Connors) attempts to get them acquitted.

That Egan was for the defense and not the prosecution was what made the series unique.  Guilt or innocence thus became a relative term.  With better writing it could been a great series (think ""Hill Street Blues"" where the public defender is involved in a romance with the Precinct Captain).  Unfortunately rather than actually working in opposition to each other, most of the episodes featured little if any interplay between Anderson and Egan.  So what you got was more like a 45-minute cop show followed by a 45-minute lawyer show; with the only point in common being the same guest star(s); whose character might just as well have had different names for all it would have mattered.

The series tried to hold the cop show fans over for the second half by ingeniously breaking the show at the quarter hour when it was too late to change channels and watch something else.  It must not have worked very well because the ratings were too low to support a second season.

Gazzara was excellent but Connors was horribly miscast.  Most likely someone who is seeing Connors' various shows for the first time is mystified than he got so much television work in 1960's.  All I can say is that a lot of people were just as mystified then.

Bottom line, despite its flaws the uniqueness of the series makes it well worth a look today.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1205280000,5,2132,4.75
3195926,5,B000W4KSV0,"For those discriminating viewers who want to see top-flight TV drama from the heyday of the medium (1955-65) do yourself a favor and order this fantastic three-volume set, ""Arrest and Trial.""  Nine 74 minute shows are included in this reasonably priced compilation.  Ben Gazzara (Det. Sgt. Nick Anderson) and Roger Perry (Det. Sgt. Dan Kirby) bring the perceived lawbreakers to trial in the first 35-40 minutes; John Larch (Deputy Dist. Atty. Jerry Miller) and John Kerr (Asst. Deputy Dist. Atty. Barry Pine) then try the state's case, with the defendant most-often represented by Chuck Connors (John Egan).  When the show aired in the fall of 1963, ABC sunk a tremendous amount of money into the development of the 90-minute series; to that end they did their best to sign on two or three ""name"" actors for every episode.  These actors included Roddy McDowell, Mickey Rooney, Katherine Ross, Howard Duff, James Whitmore, Marlo Thomas, Leo Gordon, Tony Franciosa, Martin Sheen, Steve Forrest, Neville Brand, Robert Webber, Vera Miles, Clu Gulager, Telly Savalas, Dorthy Malone, MacDonald Carey, Julie Adams, Jack Klugman, David Carradine, Dennis Hopper, Richard Basehart, William Shatner, Richard Carlson, Nick Adams, Barry Sullivan, and Oscar-winners Robert Duvall, Kim Hunter, and Martin Balsam -- a darn good line-up of guest stars for a 30-episode run!  Watch these shows along with episodes of ""The Defenders"" (E.G. Marshall and Robert Reed, if you can find any copies), ""The Naked City"" (Paul Burke, Horace MacMahon, Nancy Malone), and ""East Side, West Side"" (George C. Scott), and you'll see just how far we've fallen in the production and presentation of television drama since the mid-60's.  The prints of the ""Arrest and Trial"" episodes in this set appear to be 16mm and contain the expected specks and occasional streaks you'll find in 40+ year-old film -- but really the video and audio quality is quite good.  Special thanks to Timeless Media Group and Universal for allowing these outsanding shows to be seen again.  Here's hoping more compilations of ""Arrest and Trial"" will be forthcoming.

3195927,4,B000W4KSV0,"During the Fall of 1963, a new police and lawyer show debuted on ABC.  Titled ""Arrest and Trial,"" this unique show was made for a 90 minute time slot.  The first half of the show featured the ""Arrest,"" with detectives Ben Gazzara and Roger Perry gathering the evidence and apprehending the suspect.  The ""Trial"" portion starred Chuck Connors aided by Don Galloway as defense attorneys, with John Larch and John Kerr as prosecutors from the district attorney's office.  Sound familiar?

There's no question that the basic structure and format of ""Arrest and Trial"" influenced the modern ""Law & Order.""  But there's a major difference in the two shows.  ""Law & Order"" is, essentially, a well written and acted police and judicial procedural.  ""Arrest & Trial,"" while retaining many of the procedural elements, is much more of a character study of the accused and those around him - friends and family - and how law enforcement and the judicial system affect their lives.  Disc 2 of the set represents the series well and features three episodes dealing with the theme of addictions:  Mickey Rooney is a drug addict accused of murder; Nick Adams embezzles money from his employer to pay for his gambling habit; Dewey Martin is a paroled convict dealing with alcoholism who has a difficult time adjusting to the outside world.

The series was produced during the era of the early to mid-1960s when the bar for televised drama was set very high with shows like ""Route 66,"" ""The Fugitive,"" ""Combat!,"" ""The Defenders,"" ""Naked City"" and others sharing the primetime airwaves.  ""Arrest and Trial"" shares the superior writing, acting, and direction of those other shows.  So why wasn't it a hit?  One reason may have been its odd running time - 90 minutes - rather than the standard 60 minute format for most televised dramas of the era. But there were other shows that ran for 90 minutes during the 1960s like the Westerns ""The Virginian,"" ""Cimarron Strip,"" and, for a time, even ""Wagon Train.""  More probably, it had to do with the competition.  Broadcast by ABC on Sundays from 8:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., ""Arrest and Trial"" went head-to-head with the second half of ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" and ""The Judy Garland Show"" on CBS, while NBC offered ""Grindl"" and the second longest running Western in TV history ""Bonanza.""  Sadly, ""Arrest & Trial"" was cancelled after only a single season of 30 episodes.  Co-stars Gazzara and Connors would move on to more successful series, ""Run for Your Life"" and ""Branded,"" respectively.

This release of ""Arrest and Trial,"" as well as several other DVD releases from the Timeless Media Group, is the product of a unique licensing arrangement that Timeless has with NBC Universal.  In a cost cutting measure, Universal is only licensing the use of the episodes to Timeless; it is not providing restored or remastered prints to Timeless.  Instead, Timeless is assembling episodes on its own using 16 millimeter films from collectors and other sources.  As a consequence, the prints utilized for this release are far from perfect, often exhibiting scratches, dirt and other imperfections.  While this may not be the most ideal way to release a television series on DVD, the prospective purchaser of ""Arrest and Trial"" needs to consider the rarity of this series and the likelihood of a better release.  Frankly, this was a series that I believed would never see a DVD release, and so I'm appreciative that a DVD releasing company would take a risk on such a comparatively obscure series.  Each of the three discs contained in this box set contains three episodes, with episodes running in the 75 to 76 minute range, so you're getting a representative sampling of nine of the thirty episodes that were produced.  There are no extra features included on this release.

The quality of the writing, acting, direction, and overall production transcend a flawed visual presentation.  I can very easily recommend this to vintage TV fans and anyone who appreciates a quality televised drama, but videophiles will have numerous issues with this release and are probably best advised to steer clear.  ""Arrest and Trial"" as a series merits five stars, but subtract a star for the lesser visual quality.",1195084800,65,4210,4.940340909090909

""Law and Order"" follows the same format, except the trial segment in Arrest and Trial is from the Defense's viewpoint. Still, the prosecution lawyers are integral to the conclusion, and make counter-points that add balance to an issue. The shows are also very good sources for experiencing cultural beliefs and practices of the time, as well as witnessing how some of the artifacts were thought of and used.",1383436800,4,741,5.073770491803279

3195935,4,B000W4KSV0,"Sometimes melodramatic, but intelligent and very well acted early 1960s U.S. TV series, that obviously served as the inspiration
for ""Law & Order"".

Like ""L & O"" this is divided into 2 parts; ""Arrest"" where cop Ben Gazzara tracks down the person seemingly guilty of that
week's crime and ""Trial"" where Chuck Connors defends them.

Having the 2nd half be from the defense point-of-view, not the prosecutor's makes the show different than ""Law and Order"",
and arguably more interesting. It makes blatant how much of the legal system exists in shades of grey.

It's not surprising that Ben Gazzara is very, very good as cop Nick Anderson, making him more complex and interesting than
your basic TV detective of the era. What caught me off-guard was that Connors as successful attorney John Egan, just about
matches him. Unlike Gazzara, Connors was never taken that seriously as an actor,. But he shows a lot here as a top notch,
somewhat cynical lawyer. Beyond the two leads, the guest casts were often very strong as well.

It's partly because these were 90 minutes episodes on TV, so each show runs about 75 minutes of screen time, as opposed to the
standard TV drama that runs an hour, which means about 45-60 minutes of actual story. With the extra time, the writers fleshed
out the characters, both regulars and guests, much more fully than on most non-serialized dramas.

So even if there are plot or logic holes (like charging a man with 1st degree murder, instead of a much more logical 2nd degree or
manslaughter, so the trial can be about the issue of ""intent"" ) it feels more like you're watching a solid, well acted B-film each
episode, instead of an early TV series. And the series has a nice mix of dark edginess and humanism.

Yes, the score can be painfully over-the-top, and some of the resolutions are too neat, but I'd still say this holds up favorably to a
lot of the modern U.S. character cop and/or lawyer shows of today.

Sadly, the quality of the transfers leaves a lot to be desired. I read elsewhere they were transferred from old 16 mm prints, and
they do look it: washed out, full of print damage, missing opening credits. But it's nowhere near fatal to enjoying this
unusually intelligent slice of early TV.",1345334400,3,2233,4.6811224489795915
