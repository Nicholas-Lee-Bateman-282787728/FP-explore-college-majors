Watching her walk down the ships passages is what this movie is about! She looks great, easily the best of her recent movies. If you want story get 'Second to Die'.",1036713600,3,341,4.029411764705882
1085785,1,6305870241,"Oh boy, was this one bad.  If you are a fan of Speed 2, Cruise Control, but feel it was a bit cerebral, this may be the film for you.
First of all, it was made by someone with exactly zero knowledge of ships.  I mean, how much stucco do you normally see on the bulkheads of ocean liners?  Concrete on the floors of engine rooms?
Then there were the continuity problems, with some scenes shot on the Queen Mary, and others on and older cruise ship.  Not a big problem, unless you have established that the ship is sinking violently in one shot, and then perfectly stable in the next.  Outside, the actors are running and jumping on an unmoving deck, while inside they are getting tossed around like a bad Star Trek episode.
Dialogue?  Claudia Christian must have been wistful for the worst of her Babylon 5 lines during most of this ordeal.
Plot? A straightforward terrorists seize buidling/airplane/ship with military precision only to be defeated by the Lone Hero with his Comic Sidekick(s).  We may have seen this one before...
I had a good laugh towards the end, when a nearby naval ship, hearing that the ship is going down (but getting no word of terrorists on board) organizes a rescue by sending helicopters packed with fully armed marines, including anti-tank weapons. Not sure where they planned on stashing the survivors.
You could have a bit of fun with this one, if you rent it and do a MST3K number on it. ...",996969600,8,1422,4.53125
1085786,1,6305870241,"Some people like ""B"" grade movies.....but not when they have so little action or romance to offer. The cast are so wooden, that even Ice T can't liven things up.
Erika Eleniak has obviously struggled since Baywatch and will not get many offers after this.
Imagine ""Speed 2"", but worse.",993686400,2,285,4.72

7897225,1,6305870241,"You know how airlines, aside from Quantas, don't show in-flight movies that involve crashes or hijackings?

Well, a ferry that I was on in eastern Indonesia showed this film, centered around a hi-jacked sinking ship, which was pretty funny considering their ferry system is plagued with sinkings and the country is also plagued with terrorists. The programming director for their ferries must be a true nihlist

What was even funnier was that the movie was subtitled in Thai, which meant only people that could understand English or read Thai would follow what was happening.

The best moment of the movie was when the terrorists hi-jack the sinking cruiser and my travelling companion, who is English, commented, ""What are these guys, Irish?""

This comic relief was the only thing that made the ferry trip tolerable. I don't think this movie would be tolerable in any other situation.",1121212800,,885,5.041095890410959
7897226,3,6305870241,"Another film by the 'king' of B-budget disaster movies, Jay Andrews (AKA Jim Wynorski; a few of his others being, ""Ablaze"" and ""Sonic Impact""). Like all of Andrews' films, the description on the back cover is very wrong from the actual story portrayed. This film is just a B-budget attempt to cash in on the Titanic/Disaster Movie craze of the late ninties, and it fails miserably.

 ""Final Voyage"" is the story of a male security officer (Dylan Walsh)who successfully kills off some terrorists who hijack a commercial airliner, while protecting some old movie star from harm. He then gets reassigned to protecting the daughter of Henry Franklin, named Gloria Franklin (I do wish that B movie people would come up with more interesting names for their characters). He saves her when her small plane malfunctions and crash lands (heaven forbid a woman actaully save the day!)and this sparks a whole new view between the two.

 Gloria (Erika Elaniak)then decides to take a cruise aboard the brand new cruise ship, Britannic (or 'Brittanic' as it is mispelled on the cheap life-preserver that hangs around the 'ship' at miscellaneous points)which has been completely rebuilt and refurbished. The ship then starts out on its maiden voyage but gets hijacked by the terrorist-who-is-nothing-more-than-a-petty-thief character (Ice-T) and his group of foul-mouthed anarchists. They have come to steal all the 'valueables and artifacts' that are in the ship's vault (a large brightly-blue painted tank).

 Two crewmen then find that the ship has a hairline fracture in the hull (made out of concrete!) that is leaking water and they say that the ship's vault is just on the other side of the bulkhead (even though the sea should be on the other side if it's leaking water!) but they are killed before they can tell anyone. We then find out the theship's owner cut costs while rebuilding the ship and that the Britannic is a 'Death Ship.'

 Anyway, the terrorists end up killing a bunch of people for no reason and Dylan Walsh decides that he must save the day and bring Erika and Rick Ducummn with him on his escapade where they shoot an infinite amount of bullets that rarely hit their mark. Then the robbers try to blow the vault open, but end up blowing a whole in the ship's side, causing a jet of water to shoot in, yet it is enough to sink the whole ship! So now Walsh must try to save everyone on the ship, including his ex-girlfriend who is a reporter, and kill all the bad guys, before the Britannic founders.

 The whole story is rather stupid and horribly played out, the cast and acting are poor, almost all of the special effects came from other movies. All of the exterior ship shots came from the 1974 film, ""Juggernaut"" and all of the interior sinking/blowing up shots came from ""Deep Rising."" The all of the Aircraft Carrier/rescue operations shot were taken from various films, as were all of the exterior airplane shots. THe only special effects that the film company actually made themselves were a man falling from the airplane, the hole in the ship's side, and lifeboats being lowered, a couple of explosion shots, and the ship's final plunge, that's it! And they were all very cheap cgi effects.

 THe sets were also terrible, the 'Grand Salon' was stock footage from ""Deep Rising,"" the 'Main Ballroom' was a crummy LA nightclub, the cabin corridor and 'staterooms' were at a motel, the engine room stuff was all shot at some department of water and electricity in LA (with concrete walls and floors!), then their were like two actual sets, the bridge and the comms room, and the few exterior deck places they used (plus a corridor and stairway) were filmed on the Queen Mary (one shot has Ice T walking past one of the QM's large red smokestacks on deck, but the ship they're supposed to be on has no such smokestack!).

 Overall, ""Final Voyage"" is a terribly planned out and executed piece of B-movie garbage, the only thing that kept me from giving it two stars is the enjoyable audio commentary with Andrews and actress, Claudia Christian. Plus I find this film fun to watch when I'm feeling down and want to watch a movie that I can laugh at, a movie that they actually tried to make look good, but failed entirely.",1091577600,,4234,4.7506811989100814
7897227,2,6305870241,"I like Dylan Walsh.  His boyish good looks and ability to throw off some clever lines has been a part of most of his movies.  However, in FINAL VOYAGE, Dylan is merely window dressing, along with lovely Erika Eleziak in this muddled, confusing and ultimately ultraviolent mess.  Ice T is awful as the hedonistic leader of this motley crew; Claudia Christian is gorgeous as always but looks she belongs in another movie.  The obvious differences in what ship was being filmed are glaring, and while it packs some interesting action, it ultimately falls into the B movie, subdivision.  Oh, Rick Dicommun as Jasper saves the movie with his comic relief.",1080345600,,650,4.872727272727273

GOOD ACTION, GOOD ACTING, AND AN INTERESTING STORYLINE MAKES THIS A HIGHLY ENTERTAINING ACTION MOVIE. GET THIS ONE AS SOON AS YOU CAN.",1071532800,4,439,4.301204819277109
