1120367,5,7799437278,"This movie was Triumphant!
What a story of Courage, Strength, Heart, Will, and Accomplishment!
This Girl shows all of us what is possible on this earth!!!

The movie went at a good pace... I took my 7 year old daughter with me, and neither of us were bored or un-content during the film.
The theater was full, but you could hear a pin drop, as every single person was intently staring in AWWW at the big screen...
I found myself shedding a few tears at various times!

I compare this movie with the likes of Cinderella Man, The Hurricane, Remember the Titans & Secretariat.

Helen Hunt & Dennis Quaid did fantastic in their respective roles...

I loved at the end of the movie, while the credits played, they played video clips of the real girl behind the amazing story! The clips also updated what she did in her life after the accident!
I would love to meet this girl someday!!!

I give this movie an A+, and reccomend you go and see it on the big screen!
Thanks for reading my review...",1302912000,28,989,4.412087912087912
1120368,5,7799437278,Have you ever felt like something's impossible? I like how Bethany never gives up. Even after a shark attack! When she wakes up right away she wants to now when she will get to surf again. This movie inspired me and I can't wait to go to California and learn how to surf! The main thing in this movie is to never give up at anything. Five star-need to see movie! Best movie ever!,1302912000,3,379,4.135135135135135

1120370,5,7799437278,"Soul Surfer is a very inspirational movie.  It really captures the spirit and deternination of teenager Bethany Hamilton.  The message of this movie is that faith in God gives a person strength to overcome any obstacle.  I am not overally religious, but I think that faith in a higher power is a positive message.  AnnaSophia Robb gives an excellent performance as Hamilton, She is a teenager that lost her arm to a shark bite in 1996.  There are shots in the movie showing Anna Sophia struggling with the simplest things like cutting vegetables and making a sandwich after losing her arm.  Her dedication and her talent for the sport of surfing is what makes this movie entertaining.  I admire the skill, balance and coordination that Anna Sophia shows on the surf board.  Director Sean Mcnamara makes surfing look like an exciting and competitive sport.  There is one shot in the movie that shows Anna Sophia going inside of a wave and then coming out of it.  This shot is breathtaking and is a testament to Mcnamara's talent as a director.  Dennis Quaid co stars as Tom Hamilton.  He is Bethany's father.  He gives a good performance as a father who encourages Bethany not to give up her dream as a professional surfer.  Carrie Underwood is good in a supporting role as a youth minister who also encourages Bethany not to give out faith in God as after her accident.  Helen Hunt plays Bethany's mom Cheri.  Her performance is not as good as Quaid's, but she still comes across as a loving mother.  This film is filled with good music.  There is an uplifting song entitled Set The World On Fire"".  This song is about the strength of the human spirit.  There is a beautiful Hawaiian song entitled ""Ho Oheno Keia No Beauty"" that includes excellent ukulele playing. This song adds some Hawaiian flavor to the movie. Soul Surfer is a very entertaining film.",1302393600,8,1855,4.684210526315789
1120371,5,7799437278,"Great movie well worth seeing. Film, fate, and faith and some serious heart felt dialog make this a movie that will make your heart soar.",1302393600,2,137,4.52
1120372,5,7799437278,"It takes a courageous soul to fight back when tragedy strikes, and Bethany Hamilton is a true fighter. At the age of thirteen, on the cusp of great things as an aspiring pro surfer, she lost her left arm in a tragic shark attack. Many of us would've given up on our dreams then and there. Bethany didn't. Grounded in her faith and family, her story made the international news in 2003. She even wrote a book about her experience, aptly titled Soul Surfer.

Now eight years later the movie of the same name is out and telling even more of her story, including some of Bethany's struggles and doubts after the accident. Starring AnnaSophia Robb as Bethany, Soul Surfer the movie isn't just another beating-the-odds sports flick. It's an incredible and inspiring story of a young girl who triumphed over adversity. Knowing these events really happened makes everything mean more.

With a terrific cast giving spot on performances, Soul Surfer exceeded my expecations. Dennis Quaid as Bethany's father shows the depth of his acting skills, believably playing a fun-loving guy one minute, a devestated father ready to fall apart the next. The same is true for Helen Hunt as Bethany's mom, Cheri. In several scenes her deep, motherly emotions were palpable, and yet she hadn't said a word. AnnaSophia Robb gives one of her best performances in this role, every bit as heartfelt as you'd hope. A case could be made that supporting cast member Carrie Underwood as Sarah Hill, Bethany's youth leader, was possibly the weakest link in the acting department. She had the tendency to overact a little in her scenes, but you couldn't help liking her anyway as her character came across genuine and caring.

It's fascinating how the filmmakers were able to make it appear as if Robb herself was actually missing an arm. She had to wear a green sleeve during the shooting, holding her arm behind her back, but it's almost eery how realistic it appears. Filmed on location in Hawaii, Hamilton herself was Robb's stunt double for the difficult surfing scenes.

There's so much to take away from this story, but what's most refreshing is how the filmmakers didn't water down the Hamiltons' faith. Which isn't to say it's a preachy story; not at all. The message of relying on God and His strength flowed as naturally through the movie as the Hawaiian waves. The love the Hamilton family has for each other is touching. Soul Surfer would be a fantastic movie to watch with your youth group, but all ages will find something to enjoy. This is one you'll want to watch more than once.

MPAA Rating: PG - the shark attack scene could be disturbing for young children.

1120374,5,7799437278,"I just went this afternoon to the matinee, and wow what a good movie!! A main theme of the movie is that good can come out of bad.  Also, it shows how we can help others through our personal tragedies and that life is not over when bad things happen to us.  There is a plan for everything. I was very impressed with all the acting, special effects and the family friendly tone. There are zilcho swears. Even in the characters' darkest moments, there are no typical overused omg's or anything that would indicate they were angry at God or anyone else. They don't shy away from Christian references but present it accurately, the way the family and Bethany responded in the situation. I was impressed that the faith message that was natural, but not preachy. Also, the Bible verse quoted was from Jeremiah 29:11 and really if you were of another faith you wouldn't be offended by it I don't think. In the credits they show interviews with the real Bethany and she mentions Jesus there. However, that's who she is!  Some of the critics have said oh she was too calm or sweet...but I didn't see it this way at all. In fact, in real life, it was her calmness that helped save her life!! She wasn't screaming but was in shock as well I think. I think she is just a very calm person. Later it showed how hard it was for her to deal with the loss of her limb from a functional standpoint and emotionally such as when she worried about not being attractive to boys. All the relationships and reactions were very typical of real people...nothing forced at all. It is clear how good the relationships are between the parents and among the siblings but they interact and argue like NORMAL people.  Bethany has said in real life interviews that she and her competitors weren't that catty with each other, like with the antagonist they created for the movie.  However, her response to the girl is very good which shows young people that being nice to someone gets you a whole lot further and can change the person. It also showed how she dealt with her celebrity status and how that was a real challenge. The other part critics say isn't realistic is about her artificial arm...but it's very common for amputees to reject a prosthesis when it's for their upper limb. Tony Melendez (singer and plays 12-string guitar with his feet) did the same thing and he found he could function more easily without the prosthesis. There are some beautiful shots of Hawaii and the underwater/wave effects were just breathtaking.  I definitely recommend this movie and am looking forward to having the blu-ray/dvd!",1302307200,132,2584,4.606521739130435

1120927,5,7799437278,"I had heard of the incident of a shark biting of a girl's arm when it happened, was somewhat aware that that girl started surfing again at competitons when that started happening, and am familiar with that girl when grown up from The Amazing Race where she performed better than most other contestants in most of the Detours and in general racing around the world.  So I decided to check this old 2011 movie based on Bethany Hamilton's life in the years around the shark attack.  Thirteen year old Bethany is played by AnnaSophia Robb (Race to Witch Mountain) who I think does a pretty good job both in and out of the water.  Was surprised to see her parents were played by Helen Hunt and Dennis Quaid, as I had never really imagined these two actors as surfers, let alone parents who are so obsessed with surfing culture that they live on the ocean, home school their kids so they can surf everyday, and pretty much the family lives in the water.  But Hunt and Quaid do a good job.  On the region 4 DVD there's a few documentaries where we see the real life people the characters in the movie portray.  Sure the actors don't look much like the real family members but that's pretty standard for a movie, but I think acting wise they do a good job.  Bethany apparently requested AnnaSophia play her.  She also taught her to surf.

But back to the movie, it's a kid friendly viewer family aimed film.  So that meant the Shark attack was pretty mildly shown, as well as the aftermath getting Bethany to hospital.  The fact it was done this way I found as an adult a little disappointing.  I thought those could taken up a bit more time in the length of the movie.  We don't really experience much tension from her best friend another 13 year old girl or the adult family friend and his son who helped get her to shore from a long way out, going over a reef to save time vital to saving Bethany's life. The only blood is from Bethany when I can't imagine the other's bare feet, legs and other parts wouldn't get torn up on the reefs from the coral and other sharp stuff that's there.  I would also think they would have been worried about the shark returning, which is never mentioned, especially if they themselves started bleeding.  Being also a kids film we have the typical side storyline mean girl rival surfer competing to be the best, who doesn't become sympathetic to her when she's only got one arm out in the waves, which kid viewers learn isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I don't know if that was a total fictional element, as this isn't mentioned in any of the documentaries or if this mean girl surfer was real, but it's a pretty similar side story to what you see in many kids movies.  But the main story is obviously Bethany not just feeling sorry for herself and giving up on life, but instead deciding to keep going with what she wanted to do in life and still chase her dream.  There is a little bit of religious element to the story in the movie, although it's very mild when you watch teenaged Bethany in the documentaries who mentions Jesus in just about every sentence and the shark is mentioned as having been sent by him to chomp of her arm as his plan for her to do great things. Granted the documentary is a preachy documentary made by a church group with an angle and agenda so it's probably toned up the religious element.  I think the movie is a lot more watchable because that's toned down though and Bethany's achievements are really down to her and her family and wider community support network.

Soul Surfer is a nice movie, the actors do a great job and overall it's a quite an inspirational story on someone who just never gave up.",1503446400,,3663,4.406528189910979

1122284,4,7799437278,"If this movie wasn't based on a true story, I'd give it a 3* for being a bit stereotypical and cheesy, but being that it is based on a true story... I give it a 4* despite its incredible resemblance to similar documentary movies such as The Gabby Douglas Story and Forever Strong.

Bethany Hamilton is a surfer in Hawaii who loses her arm to a shark yet battles to remain the pro surfer she has always dreamed to become. She loses the first regionals she competes in but in the next, makes a good impression despite not winning. The story is good but:

The community is really supportive and the family SO loving, affectionate, easygoing... A best friend Alana and her family are there the whole time... A church youth group counselor who is so supportive... Bethany only cries about her arm really when she messes up at the regionals. There is the stereotypical teenage nemesis who ends up sharing her medal at the last competition, and Bethany and Alana always laugh at her attempts at putdowns. Bethany goes to Thailand after deciding to quit surfing and of course gets back on the board there... When she comes back home, her family acts like going to help people in Thailand after a tsunami is an everyday thing?
Really? Doesn't sound like normal people to me... A little anger, hurt, conflict would be nice. That's real life. As I said, this is a real life story so I give it 4* but I wonder how accurate it is.

ALSO: This movie is a lot more Christianed-themed than I was aware. That's ok, but I would have liked to know.

The acting is ok, the pictures are ok - all quite stereotypical. There is nothing that makes me think - so cool. And the storyline makes it seem like Bethany's attitude is normal so instead of inspiring me, it kind of makes me think - well if a shark bites off my arm, I'll be fine.

This movie is not a waste of time, and the fact that it is based on a real person's journey is what makes it worth watching, but don't have too high expectations.",1471132800,,1977,4.376021798365122

Sad, considering if the same story were to use Magic, Superpowers or The Force then it's boosted in ratings. NOTICE HOW HIGH the ratings still are on Soul Surfer!!!  This tells you this is one of the greatest movies ever, and I agree.  Some reviews on IMDb slam the acting skills of someone who is actually a famous singer in Christian circles.  Yeah, she could've used some coaching, but I DON'T CARE.  Carrie Underwood ADDED to the power of this film.

1124390,4,7799437278,"Surfing. It is her first love. It is her passion. And she's got the skill to become a pro. At least she did. Surfing one day, Bethany gets attacked by a shark. Blood is lost in crazy amounts. She is rushed to the hospital. And although she survives, her left arm is forever gone. With only one arm, pro surfing seems doubtful.

But Bethany isn't about to give up. After tons of hard works, she faces the waves again and declares to the world that nothing is impossible with God.

I had seen a movie trailer of Soul Surfer a while ago and was pretty excited to watch this. Although I wish it was developed a bit more, it spoke of a great - and true! - story. Bethany Hamilton is a real person who lost her arm and is now a pro surfer. Praise God, who does such grand things!",1454025600,,773,4.112582781456954

1125836,1,7799437278,"This movie was truly terrible.  I was duped into watching it because of the 5 star review it received on this site.  The quality of the acting, directing, and writing was that of a bad made for TV movie.

The reason why it got a 5 star rating is because of all of the religious people writing reviews in hopes to promote this movie, which I find strange because the religious undertones in this movie were not really even that strong.

The last I checked, this received a 45% on rotten tomatoes, which I think is a fair assessment of the quality of this film.

Its such a shame, too, because this was a story that truly had some potential.",1441670400,2,639,4.291666666666667

1127874,5,7799437278,"Bethany Hamilton is a lovely young Hawaiian who passion is surfing.  Unfortunately, one day out on the water she lost her left arm in a shark attack.  This movie is the story of how the brave lass overcame all odds to once again surf ~ not only as recreation, but @ a championship level.

By law, I am obliged to state the obvious:  the religious overtones of the film are groundless.  Being attacked by a shark does not prove or disprove the existence of God (or gods).  Sharks do what they do, and they have been hunting their prey since < the age of the dinosaurs.  It is irrelevant as to whether you have religious faith or don't have religious faith;  if a shark identifies you as a food source while you're out on the water, then it's going to come after you.  You can dress your polemics up with Carrie Underwood all you want, but that fact remains constant.

Now, to be sure, Bethany's story is profound and inspiring.  Annasophia Robb does a remarkable job of encapsulating the shock and frustration of a girl who was attacked by 1 of the oldest species on the planet.  Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt turn in fervent performances as Bethany's concerned parents.

Ultimately, of course, this film is not about surfing so much as it is about overcoming adversity.  In that regard, this is a top notch film.  If you can overlook the religious red herrings, then this a story that is well worth telling!",1429401600,,1405,4.4980237154150196

1130502,5,7799437278,"This was really an outstanding and very realistic movie! I thought the shark scene was realistic, too! Having been in a few traumatic situations (being robbed, hit by a drunk driver), one DOES sometimes react with complete silence. I went into shock. You simply do not expect bad things to happen to you- they happen to other people, or people on TV.

I also liked how the movie showed her sometimes having a bad attitude, being worried about how boys would view her, etc.- THAT's real life! Real people- especially teenagers- get upset and discouraged and frustrated. That's reality. This was a very, very cool thing about this movie.

This movie made me cry. If you know someone who's had bad things happen to them for no reason, been through bad accident, etc., this is a really hopeful, encouraging movie of faith and hope. I'm not religious but spiritual, and I trust in God. I LOVED this movie. Very, very beautiful film. Good example of the triumph of the human spirit.",1419033600,,976,4.701754385964913

1130898,5,7799437278,"This movie here ... this is my 9 year old daughter's favorite movie eva.  The thumbnail pic for the movie on Amazon shows Bethany Hamilton holding a surfboard that has been destroyed by a shark.  In reality, the destroyed surfboard is much less the focal point in the movie.  The thumbnail should have been of her other arm lined up with the shark bite on the board ... and a caption / thought-bubble that reads, ""I don't even care that my board got destroyed!"".  Why it should be like that is because the movie makes a big deal about her getting her arm bitten off, but I don't even remember an homage to the board.  Hear ye, hear ye ... from this day forth we will think about that poor girls arm instead of that stupid surfboard (even though it is displayed alone in the thumbnail).  I have declared it as such.  Anyway, this movie is good.  If you are a 9 year old, it is the best movie eva!  Warning!  This movie will make 9-year-olds tear off Barbie limbs.  I would've given this movie a 4/5 stars, but how could I do that to my daughter.  I give it an inherited 5/5 stars!",1417564800,,1079,4.235294117647059

1131616,5,7799437278,"There is something fundamentally reassuring about watching someone overcome a devastating turn in circumstance.  It speaks to our own survival instincts. Yet, it takes more than the stereotypical  ""I will survive,"" storyline to keep a passive audience engaged. ""Soul Surfer"" does just this by establishing Bethany Hamilton as a ""real"" teen, pre-shark attack. The fact that she is particularly cute and successful in her sport only adds to a gnawing tension in our gut. Each time she gets in the water that tension grows, helped in part by past films like ""Jaws."" Couple this with the all too human fear of pain/loss and the film maker manages to create a film that you can't ignore despite some minor flaws. Afterall, this is not a Hollywood created story.  It's ""real"" and we're like a fly on the wall, trapped in the room/with no place to hide.

It's not all about the injury either.  What makes this movie particularly touching is the way this talented yet ""normal"" teenage girl moves through her and emerges on the other side. Reborn in hope, love, and a newfound strength that she freely shares with others. Bethany has a smile that will light a fire under the skeptic in all of us.

Soul Surfer meets you wherever you are on your spiritual journey: believer, non-believer.  All you need is a mind, heart and a willingness to be inspired.",1412726400,,1343,4.762931034482759

1132065,4,7799437278,"If you don't remember or know the story of Bethany Hamilton, in 2003/2004 her story made international headlines when she had her arm bitten off by a shark. She and her family are Christians and used the media opportunity presented to them to lift up the name of Jesus whenever they could. Eventually, a feature-film was created and Soul Surfer is the result. This film tells the story, both the lead-up and subsequent events. It is a hopeful and encouraging movie that will leave you inspired to really believe that with God all things are indeed possible, just as His Word declares.

It is a well-made, well-acted movie that has some notable talent such as Helen Hunt, Dennis Quaid, and AnnaSophia Robb. With plenty of surfing shots, you'll find yourself drawn into the world of surfing in a way you may not have ever seen on the screen if surfing's not typically your thing. Since most of us don't live on the beach in Hawaii and have a family that constantly goes surfing, it may seem like this might be a hard film to relate to. But, it actually does quite a good job of drawing you into ""their story"". It was also a joy to see that enough Christianity was left in the movie that you will not be left wondering where Bethany and her family stand - it is clear that they are Christians and that they live out of that worldview.

I only have 1 real concern with this movie, and I'm just going to be blunt and honest here. I know many other Christian reviews have kind of skirted around this issue (the elephant in the room), but I'm just going to lay it out. Much of the screen time goes to Bethany and her close surfing friend. Both are beautiful, blonde-haired, teen girls wearing what you'd expect such girls that are surfing to be wearing. In other words, there's a lot of skin. I don't particularly find this a problem in-and-of-itself, but this combined with some of the scenes in the movie, I do feel could very much send messages to other girls watching this film that might not be the best for them. For example, there's a scene with Bethany and her friend where her friend wants to buy a real skimpy bathing suit that barely covers her breasts because it's ""hot"" - they even joke about how she's going to have to be careful or it might come off in the water. Then there's the scene with the same friend later on doing a photo shoot which honestly vaguely reminded me of a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition type shoot. The photographer was telling her ""that's gorgeous"" etc. as she does all her different poses, etc. The message that I worry that gets sent to young impressionable girls is just plain concerning to me as it reinforces the cultural messages that for girls it's all about showing skin & looking ""hot"". I know that part of it is just a byproduct of the fact that if you're going to make a movie about teen surfer girls surfing, there's pretty much going to be a certain hard-to-escape ""tone"" along these lines. But it just seems like it got accentuated in a way that I wish it didn't. If this is being shown to any girls (I'd say any age under 18), I'd say some good follow-up discussion might be in order. On the flip-side, I can fully understand why there might be some guys where lust is a real battle for whom this might not be the best film to watch simply because of the amount of skin/beach scenes, etc. (although there is definitely nothing sexual in the film). So there you go. That's the elephant in the room with this movie and I've just pointed it out.

One of the concerns I thought I might have in regards to this movie, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it really wasn't nearly as much of an issue as I thought it might be. That is the issue of whether God CAUSED Bethany to lose her arm by the shark so that He could then do all that's happened subsequent for His glory. That is an implied and somewhat minorly discussed theme in the movie, but it's much toned-down from what I was worried it might be. I know different people have different theology on stuff like this, but I just think that to ascribe any tragedy of any kind to God's doing is quite a bold move. Now, we know that God specializes in taking tragedies and bringing good out of them - Romans 8:28 is indeed a promise that Christians that love Jesus can genuinely hold on to and believe. But knowing that God can work things out for our good and saying that God brought about or ""wanted"" the initial tragic event are two different things. There is hurt and pain in this world. There are sharks that will eat a human's arm if they see it in the water and they're hungry. It's part of the sin curse seen throughout our world, and sometimes those effects touch us. In other words, to say that it was God's WILL that Bethany lose her arm, I just think is quite the bold thing to say. Just because God allows something to happen to me in the natural course in this world to me doesn't necessarily mean that that's actually what He WANTS - and I think sometimes we make that easy-to-make mistake.

Make sure after you watch this movie that you watch the 30-minute ""Heart of a Soul Surfer"" documentary that's on the Special Features part of the disc. It really shows more of the heart and Christian aspects to the story beyond what you see in the movie.

All in all, this is an inspiring movie that will likely cause people to really evaluate whether they are really making a difference and using their God-given talents for His glory.

Blu-ray: The quality of the blu-ray I watched was excellent with good detail and vibrant color.

1132233,5,7799437278,"Soul Surfer is a wonderful portrayal of the story of Bethany Hamilton.
Anna Sophia Robb did an outstanding job showing her character's excitement and joy in the beginning  as well as her frustration and devastation after the shark attack and finally her hope and courage towards the end.
They could not have cast a better actress. She has acted in the well known productions of Race to Witch Mountain, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Bridge to Terabithia, and Because of Winn-Dixie.
 The music and the shark's eye view before the attack combined with the view of Bethany led to suspense and underlying knowledge of what is about to happen (for those who have not seen it or do not know of the story).
 The movie shows the hardships of the teen and her family, but also gives perspective of the hardships of others and the support they give her for her courage in continuing to compete in the surfing competitions. There is hope, courage, and love in this movie that makes it a must watch and a great movie to watch with the family.",1410652800,,1034,4.608695652173913

1133057,5,7799437278,"This true story of one person's determination to overcome one of the most fearsome adversities a person swimming in the ocean can face is told with bold honesty and professionalism.  There are no slack performances or embarrassing clumsy moments often experienced in other faith based stories where it becomes obvious the producers and directors didn't understand the story or the person being portrayed.  That typical disconnect does not happen here.  The build up of the characters prior to the accident and their struggles afterward are carefully paced with well chosen and performed music.  None of the supporting actors show any professionalism.  Dennis Quaid puts out his hallmark reputation for solid understanding of the character providing a firm foundation for the rest of the cast.  The portrayal of a one armed lady by a two armed actress is nothing less than astounding.  Behind this story is another not told, that of the deeply spiritual Hawaiian native (born there) culture which is mostly hidden under the tourism culture.  This is the true ""village"" which builds the foundation on which Bethany Hamilton and her family were prepared, then supported.  Sony gets credit for funding a project like this where the values of a Western culture are such a prominent part of of the story.  The Christian messages in the story are from a home spun evangelical perspective devoid of the usual Hollywood stereotypes of extremism where Christians are either cold disconnected clerics or holy rollers squirming on the floor.  This is the Christianity most believers know.  The struggles, the doubts, the working out of life's tangles that seem to never end, and yes, the giving up.  The Christian experience is a partnership of family, community, and world where the credit for success or survival (however that is measured) is given to Someone else.",1405641600,,1855,5.1433333333333335

As a theatre technician and a writer, I want to say that it is difficult to put everything in a two hour production - you have to take the main points of a story or life and make them fit. It's not an easy thing to do. I, personally, did not find the movie sappy or sloppy. I thought it was well done. The points are made, yet not beaten into you. It was enough to tell the story and make you think. It left me encouraged and wanting to know more about Bethany. It's a nice thing when you can go to a movie and leave wanting to meet or learn more.

1134313,3,7799437278,"""Soul Surfer"" (2011) relays the inspirational true story of 13 year-old surfer Bethany who's arm was bitten off by a shark in Hawaii in October, 2003. Despite this, she was back in the water surfing in less than a month (!).

I admit that my wife & I cried at certain points during this movie, which is  a good testimony, but I felt the movie was sometimes too stagy and awkward, not all the time, but here and there, like the ending where a certain character has a sudden change of heart. People have changes of heart in real life, so I'm not objecting to that, but rather the awkward and questionable way in which it was portrayed. This was a key climatic scene and the filmmakers needed to take the time to do it right, even if it took more time, practice, re-shoots, money or what have you; but it's like they shot it and said, ""Well, it's not very good, but we'll try to make it work in the editing room"".

About Bethany's nemesis, I liked the way Bethany took her continuing rivalry: She observed, ""At least she views me as competition"" as opposed to those who essentially viewed her with pity.

Despite the occasional stagy awkwardness, there's enough good here for me to give the film an okay rating, like Bethany & Alana and their relationship (played by cuties AnnaSophia Robb & Lorraine Nicholson, Jack's daughter), the awe-inspiring Hawaiian locations, solid performances by Helen Hunt & others (Dennis Quaid, Kevin Sorbo, Craig T. Nelson and Carrie Underwood), the music, the entire shark attack & aftermath sequence and, of course, the inspirational true story itself.

But those stagy, awkward moments are really detrimental. Too bad they didn't take the time to work out the kinks.

To view a similar inspirational coming-of-age surfing film that's done more effectively, check out 2010's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cutback/dp/B004VRK49K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cutback</a>"". It's a low-budget independent flick, but very good.

The film was shot in Hawaii and runs 106 minutes.

1135107,5,7799437278,"This is an EXCELLENT film, with BRILLIANT actors, telling an EXCEPTIONNALLY moving real story! Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

As you probably already know, this film tells the true story of Bethany Hamilton, a very promising young American surfer, who suffered a bad accident in October 2003, as the result of which she was very seriously and permanently injured. This is mostly the story of her struggle to overcome the results of the accident, return to a normal life and especially go back to her great passion - professional surfing.

This is a rather low key film, made with a rather modest (by Hollywood standards) budget, but nevertheless it packs an enormous punch, with some scenes being simply breathtaking. It was made possible by skilfull filming, good scenario, strong dialogs and a little bit of very discreet but extremely well made CGI.

All actors did their best in this film and for such a little production quite an ensemble cast was gathered:

- AnnaSophia Robb, who plays Bethany Hamilton, is of course the main star and she is AMAZING, as excellent as she was in her big break ""Bridge to Terabithia"" (and gosh, did this girl grow well since then!). I sincerely believe that she has the potential to become another Natalie Portman in the future!
- Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt play Bethany's parents and they are both GREAT
- singer Carrie Underwood, winner of ""American Idol"", makes here one of her rare appearances in cinema - and she is excellent!
- Craig T. Nelson, a Hollywood veteran specialist of second roles, plays here the surgeon who treats Bethany after the accident, and his calm and low key performance is an asset to this film
- Kevin Sorbo, mostly known for portraying Hercules in the 90s, plays here a role rather unusual for him - and he does it very well
- Branscombe Richard, an actor of Hawaiian ancestry known for his huge size and unique facial features and haircut, appears here as a Hawaian ex-surfing champion
- Lorraine Nicholson, young daughter of Jack Nicholson, appears here in the role of Alana Blanchard, Bethany's best friend - and also a great surfer herself
- Jeremy Sumpter, who in 2003 was an impressive Peter Pan, appears here as one of Bethany's brothers
- smoking hot model and surfer Sonia Balmores Chung, Miss Hawaii Teen 2004, plays here Malina Birch, Bethany's nemesis in surf competitons...
- last but not least, REAL Bethany Hamilton (filmed from some distance) appears in some scenes showing her impressive surfing

This film is deeply immersed in Christian teachings, as in real life Hamilton family was (and still is) very religious. However, there is no heavy hammering of Bible on the viewers - the message is discreet and softly spoken. This film tries to tackle with one of the hardest questions a Christian can be asked: ""Why does bad things happen to good people?"". It is hardly a spoiler to say here that there will be no fully satisfying solution given to solve this riddle - but some elements of answer, quite important, will be provided. Those answers will not satisfy everybody - but those who so wish can find more elements in the Bible, and especially in the Book of Job.

Bottom line, this is an excellent, wonderful film, which should please adults and young teenaegers alike. I recommend it with whole my heart! And to end this review, I will give the last word to Bethany Hamilton (who is now 23 and just announced her engagement), who said in her book: ""Surfing isn't the most important thing in life. Love is.""",1372896000,2,3519,4.7701149425287355

A triumph over great difficulties. A story of faith, love, support and courage. My wife ended up watching the movie with tears throughout and after the tragedy, yes, but ended feeling positive and nurtured because of the way this amazing girl and her family handled everything and have forged forward to give of themselves to others around the world.

The thing that anchors the film is Helen Hunt and Dennis Quaid.  Hunt is always great as she really brings reality to her roles.  Quaid is fantastic here.  His presence in every scene is felt.

The waves and the beauty of Hawaii really come through.  The ""duck dives"" are gorgeous.

I wouldn't say it's a great film, but again, the story, the message, the characters, the performances, and the beauty of the film make it hard to pass up.  It's also nice to see a film about someone who has a strong faith and that faith is not only depicted, but represented well on screen.  It's not a ""Christian"" movie exactly, but it does embrace the real Bethany and her family's strong faith.

I recommend it.  Enjoy it with the whole family, though the initial ""attack"" should be skipped by younger viewers.",1367884800,,1012,4.5054945054945055

If everybody had the kind of courage, perseverance and kindness as Bethany, this world would be a better place.  If her tragedy happened to me instead and I some how lived, I would probably become a hermit full of self pity.  She is an inspiration to a LOT of people.

As to some of the people saying that Carrie Underwood sucked in the movie, you have been watching way to many movies where the characters couldn't possibly be a real person or were expecting more out of her because of who she is.  Personally, I think the movie would have lost just a little bit if it were a different actor in her role.  She was so human.  She didn't sound fake at all.  She really did sound like a real life person that does what she did.....a normal person.",1362873600,,865,4.290123456790123

This movie shows the strength, courage, will and soul of the young woman Bethany. AnnaSophia Robb's acting is impeccable! She is a very dedicated to her work and has really brought the character to life. If it weren't for her I doubt I would have watched the entire movie. Many times this movie was showing on my television and I never bothered with it, one day I had nothing to do and was tired so flicking through boring channels I came across this movie again and just left it there. To my surprise I loved the entire movie! The entire cast are incredible and dedicated they all bring something to the show. You can see the courage, dedication and the will to follow one's dreams/passions. A main play in the show is also FAITH for Bethany and her family that was faith in GOD. Faith in God played a majout role in her overcoming her obstacles. While atheists might think this doesn't apply to them, it still does. Even if you personally don't have faith in God there are many other reasons to have faith in something you strongly believe in.

I would buy this show and I would also recommend it to others, both young and mature.

1137265,4,7799437278,"AnnaSophia Robb (gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") shines as Bethany Hamilton, a real-life young Hawaiian surfer who lost her arm in a shark attack. ""Soul Surfer"" may not be the first film about athletes who refuses to give up their dreams (my favorite is James Stewart's ""The Stratton Story""), and true, the film did not win any Oscar, but ""Soul Surfer"" delivers nonetheless, thanks to the strong performance from the star and beautifully shot surf sequences.

Most of you have already known the amazing story of Bethany Hamilton, and even you don't, well, it's OK. All you have to know that the story is inspirational to everyone, even those who are not particularly interested in surfing.

What makes the film special is the presence of AnnaSophia Robb, who embodies the heroine's indomitable spirit. Some complain (understandably) that her portrayal of Bethany Hamilton looks a bit too saintly. It is also true that despite the shocking incident and several complications that follow, AnnaSophia Robb's Bethany remains patient and resilient. But we also should know that some people can really behave like that. And remember, we are talking about someone who lost her arm in October, 2003 and came back to a surf competition in January, 2004!

Director Sean McNamara re-creates the shark attack convincingly, with vivid (not graphic) details about the attack itself and how she was brought to the hospital. Another merit of the film is the surf competition scenes, which I find surprisingly thrilling and involving, even though I have never seen one before.

My only complaint is Carrie Underwood's character and the Thailand episode that I think need more depth. That said, with a solid supporting cast including Dennis Quaid, Helen Hunt and Craig T. Nelson (more like an extended cameo though), ""Soul Surfer"" offers an uplifting tale of a real-life person who is determined to move on.",1355097600,,1928,5.130573248407643

1137761,3,7799437278,"The film narrates the events prior to the shark attack, the shark attack, and Bethany's struggle to return to the surfing world. We also get to see Bethany visiting a poor Asian country where she discovered that she had more to give to the world, and that there was no reason to give her dream of being a top woman surfer. Stressing on Bethany's trials and seeing her family support her makes it a good inspirational movie for all ages. No doubt that kids of her age may see in it a movie with an optimistic and necessary message. One thing that I liked about it was that in spite of being inspirational, it didn't rely on sentimental tear-jerking scenes. We never feel sorry for her, even when she's struggling to get to the beach after the shark attacks her. On the contrary, we get to see in film the whole process of her pain, her family's pain, eventual emotional recovery, and finally, success.

I confess, however, that I liked the book better because it gives you a lot of details about Bethany's parents and her relationship with her brothers, which have a great influence on her courageous nature. Bethany had a lot to say. But maybe I'm being ungenerous considering that films have greater limitations in time than the book form.

1137964,5,7799437278,"This movie was panned by secular groups for being too ""preachy"", panned by Christian groups for not being spiritual enough. (Although the Hamilton family had to pressure the producers into instilling more of their Christian values than what was wanted) But there will always be people who have to make something bad out of a light-hearted, inspirational film like this--especially considering the source of the inspiration. Bethany sets a great example for young people with her sweetness, positive outlook and faith. She is not perfect: she demonstrates this with some slight snarkiness toward her adversary Molina (although much provoked) Also she sneaks out of the house to go night-surfing knowing her parents probably would not agree to it. This basically amounts to dishonesty and disobedience. But this shows realism rather than idealism; Christian children do sin. There is also a scene in the hospital cafeteria where angry words are exchanged between Bethany's family. This is actually a good lesson to those who feel Christian families are always shown in an unflawed, squeaky-clean light. They are as real as anyone. And although the family's faith is well-emphasized, it is not overdone to the point that it should turn off nonbelievers. There are even a few ""believe in yourself"" and ""trust your instincts"" pep talks. I frankly loved every minute of it. I don't see how this exceptional young girl's story could NOT have been made a film.",1346112000,,1452,5.156779661016949

And while I personally consider spending one's days doing little more than surfing to be a mammoth waste of time, I can understand someone indulging in their life-long passion in this manner.  So, nothing whatsoever against Bethany or her family.

However, I think Hollywood's execution of Bethany's story in this film is completely lame.  It is so chock full of nauseating cheese and crappy acting (mostly by Carrie Underwood and Dennis Quaid) that I quickly lost interest.  The way the story was told was predictable and boring and the way the characters were portrayed left them flat and uninteresting.  I really can't think of anything else to say, other than it was one of the dullest, lamest films I've ever seen.",1345161600,7,858,4.763513513513513

Simply put, if you want a family friendly film - with no swearing, no inappropriate content whatsoever - then this is it. It contains an absolutely golden Christian message put into a palatable form for anyone. Thank you to the writers who chose not to water down its content. Jesus saves, heals, and protects those who reach out to him! He can turn terrible tragedy into great triumph! This film shows that very clearly, and the lead performance from the talented young AnnaSophia Robb shines through.

Some have criticized her performance for being weak, and I would make a strong argument against this. The real brave young woman she is portraying is a kind, laid-back, meek young woman, exactly like the one portrayed in the film. She was giving an accurate depiction of how she really is in real life.

1138143,5,7799437278,"A friend of mine recommended that I see this movie & I'm so glad that she did, 'cause it's become one of my favorite movies.  I love this movie for many reasons: One is the cast, especially Annasophia Robb, who plays Bethany Hamilton and Lorraine Nicholson, who plays Bethany's friend, Alana Blanchard(those two actresses work well together and play their characters to perfection!).  I also love the fact that the entire movie was shot on location in Hawaii and it makes you feel like you're there.  Another thing that I like is that the whole Hamilton family was there during the filming of the movie and Bethany did all the one-armed surfing stunts.  I also love how, despite her injury, Bethany was able to be determined to be able to surf, again, which leads to the message that the movie brings that, despite difficult times, good things can come out because Rick Allen, drummer for the British heavy metal band, Def Leppard, lost his left arm in a car accident in '84, but he enventually came back and, through the use of electronics & foot pedals, he was able to  play drums, again, with one arm.  Not only do I love this movie for those reasons, while I'm not an emotional guy when I watch movies, there's about 5 or 6 scenes that make me want to burst into tears.  I think Bethany is a good, strong-hearted person and I'd love to meet her one day.  To sum it up, I recommend this movie to anyone who loves surfing, good family movies, or both 'cause, believe me, this movie is WONDERFUL!",1338854400,,1497,4.498154981549815
1138144,4,7799437278,"Ok, first and foremost, I want to inform everybody that this movie was very much liked by Bethany Hamilton herself. She thought AnnaSophia Robb did a great job at portraying her. Bethany even said during an interview with AnnaSophia that she picked her out herself and I think everyone should give credit to her for doing the best job she could have possibly done. Much of the other people that were portrayed were also on the set as it was being made. I give it a four star because the acting wasn't the best and could have been better but wasn't worth one star. I really think it was rude of people to trash talk it since it was based off of the book Soul Surfed written by Bethany Hamilton. Also since Bethany herself thinks it did a fairly good job. Even if Bethany thought the scene at the hospital wasn't actually how it was, she still thought it was a good scene to have.
The clothing situation I mean is like IT'S HAWAII AND IT IS SURFING BASED!!!!
Another thing is the end.  Bethany in this scene never said she did or didn't want to go back to that day.  She just said that she wouldn't change what happened.
This is all I'm going to say before I start going off on random rants to those who gave it a one star rating.
This is by the way a girl not Randall.",1338681600,,1267,4.209876543209877
1138357,5,7799437278,"Soul surfer is one of the most inspirational movies I have ever watched. Bethany Hamilton is a young American teenage girl with enormous passion for surfing. She had her whole career in surfing ahead of her, as she just won a big surfing competition and became sponsored by Ripcurl. However, one tragic shark attack in the waters left her without her left arm. Daily activities became difficult to complete, and her life was changed entirely. After an unsuccessful competition, she thought of giving up, and decided to follow her church friends to help out after the natural disaster in Thailand. There, she learned about something greater than just surfing; she learned of love and compassion. It took Bethany a while, but she did decide to get back into the water and start surfing again. And though she did not win the Surfing Nationals competition, she gained the support and respect of her rival, Alana. In the end, she no longer mourns over the tragedy of her lost arm, but rejoices in the opportunity to be right where she is, doing what she loves and other people wanting to listen to her.

Bethany Hamilton and her family are practicing Christians, and Bethany's faith in the Lord has become a crucial motivation towards her recovery and positive attitude. Bethany regularly attends a youth group, and her leader quoted from the bible, Jeremiah 29:11: ""For I know the plans I have for you,"" declares the Lord, ""plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future"". It is this quote that Bethany holds dear to, and slowly understands that even though something tragic has happened, something good will come out of it (as her youth group leader tells her in a heart-to-heart talk). At the end of the movie, we do see that something good has come out of it, because not only has she been able to overcome all obstacles and compete successfully in the Nationals surfing competition, but she has also been able to inspire others and give hope to people with a similar situation. Bethany tells interviewers after the competition that she does not wish that she did not go surfing the day of the accident because it brought her to this very place, and also because the Lord did have a plan for her. This shows her wholehearted acceptance and trust in the Lord to watch over her, which is a real and touching portrayal of a Christian.

Though the trailer pretty much sums up the entire movie, I believe this movie is a MUST WATCH. Knowing how the movie ends does not mean that you should not watch it. And the fact that the plot is based on the true experiences of Bethany makes it all the more intriguing and inspiring. One of my favorite quotes in the movie was at the end of the Nationals competition, when she told an interviewer ""I didn't come here to win, I came here to surf"". After all she has been through, it is beautiful to see that she has grown and matured so much since the beginning of her recovery. The overall message and theme of this movie is extremely positive, and will indeed leave the audience with questions and perhaps reexamination of their lives.",1338681600,,3100,4.614130434782608

1138361,4,7799437278,"Teenage surfer Bethany Hamilton's real-life rise from national champion to shark attack victim and back again is chronicled in this terrific spring sleeper which generated over $40 million at the box-office -- not bad at all for an independently produced ""faith-based"" film that's accessible for all audiences and age groups.

Annasophia Robb is thoroughly appealing as the Hawaiian surfer girl whose determination to get back on the water after she loses her left arm makes for an inspiring drama that never becomes overly saccharine. Hamilton's faith is obviously worn on her sleeve, but there's no preachy stretches or anything that feels out of place, with director Sean McNamara handling both the movie's land-based domestic drama and surfing sequences effectively. Helen Hunt and Dennis Quaid are superb as Hamilton's understanding parents; John R. Leonetti's cinematography captures the beautiful Hawaiian locales splendidly; and Marco Beltrami's lovely, gorgeous score is not only one of his best, but easily one of the best scores of 2011.

Sony's Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack includes a just perfect AVC encoded 1080p transfer of the film with active DTS MA audio. Extras include deleted scenes, featurettes, an interview with Hamilton and the earlier half-hour documentary ""Heart of a Soul Surfer,"" which recounts Hamilton's accident. A standard DVD edition is also included in the combo package.",1337817600,,1401,5.481481481481482

My 8yr old grandaughter and I just watched it over and over, she said lets watch it again grandma. I love the movie and music so much that I cry every time I see and hear it. I have so much faith and believe in Gods power, I have believed in God and always known his love. And I believe without a doubt that if Bethaney didn't believe in Jesus Christ and know him through her faith that this movie probably never would have been made. This is a film that is for all of us  I am proud and grateful to see such a movie that is not afraid to show real life, love, tragedy, and most of all that Jesus Christ pulled this young family through it, to realize that truly With God All Things Are Possible. My grandaughter loved it, I'm going to purchase it for my collection  You can't believe what alot of critics say, that may speak negatively about this movie, for it is them who are mere men or women, who may not believe in our Heavenly Father, who may not be a Solider for God, make up your own mind, don't be a follower of those who lead you away from Jesus Christ.

1138499,5,7799437278,"First thing's first: if anyone complains about TOO MUCH SKIN, they are not culture savvy in the slightest. There are reviews for this movie that focus on that one detail and nothing else.
Now for the good stuff. My brother and I watched this and had a great time enjoying. My bro almost thought it was a Disney movie then realized it was better (at least in terms of today's Disney flicks). I couldn't help but notice all the beautiful cinematography of the exotic locale and angles of surfing.
The shark attack was real quick compared to what I was expecting, yet it did its part well enough for the speed to be a nonissue.
The church sequences (yes, there's a couple of them) at first may seem preachy to some, but what made it different (aside from a country singer for a youth pastor) was it being an open-air beachside church. Very, very different compared to the closed walls of American churches. Then there's the competitive surfing. Long before I heard of Bethany Hamilton, and despite being city-raised, I'd hoped to try surfing out. Haven't got a chance yet, and this urging me to try even more.
Besides the competitivity and Christian spirit throughout, there's a showing of the effects of civilian PTSD, social persecution for physical disabilities, media hunger for stories (no matter who they may end up hurting), mean-spirited competitive opponents... yet there's also hope, a teenage spirit of striving in spite of how others think they should go about anything, helping the helpless (never knew Bethany Hamilton went to Thailand to help tsunami survivors), and families striving togethet, blood-related and not. I even appreciated that it didn't show Christians to be incessantly happy-go-lucky even in the midst of tragedy right after listening about God having a plan for us, but showing confusion at it all (""I don't know how God could have a plan after this! What good could possibly come from this?""), showing a lot of realism (the very gritty kind) alongside practicality.
Humor, tragedy, hope, realism, love between one another, seeing things differently. This is my kind of Christian movie- even with a PG rating, it pulls no real-world punches.",1333238400,,2171,4.934426229508197

I found the movie passionate and something I could relate to. If you are looking for action and hard core stunts with special effects then this isn't for you. It's a great movie about life and pushing through the hardships even when you don't understand the reasons why and would want to be angry for what's happen.",1332979200,,584,4.407407407407407

1138704,3,7799437278,"I didn't care for this film, though AnnaSophia Robb did an excellent job, as always.  Bethany is a courageous young girl. Also, the water photography was awesome.

The ""message,"" however, didn't do much for me. First off, while I am not minimizing the impact of losing an arm, and the reality that everyday activities, once easy and taken for granted, becoming different and difficult, it is not a ""tragedy."" Losing one's life is a tragedy. Suffering with painful illness or incapacitation is a tragedy. Children with no home or love are living a tragedy. I could understand Bethany's love of surfing being her whole world, and her lack of perspective, she was a child. What was her parents' excuse? They seemed to feel also that surfing was the most important thing for her, more important than church, way more important than school, and more important than doing anything to help anyone else. Bethany blew off a trip to help needy children in Mexico because she had to train, and her parents allowed this. Instead, all that was important to all of them was for her to be the best and to win endorsements.

I saw after the film that Bethany did go on to be a pro surfer, continuing to focus on being the best and winning endorsements. The idea of ""surfing for Jesus"" leaves me cold. I would think that a film that feels it important to model good Christian values would focus less on Bethany's hobby and more on her trying to serve God, thinking about and helping other people rather than focusing on doing only what she enjoys, which doesn't serve or help anyone.",1330819200,,1566,4.646209386281589

1138707,3,7799437278,"I'm a guy and this movie had me wanting to cry a couple of times.  This movie has a lot going for it and a couple of things going against it.  First off I wanted to like this movie (actual review is 3.5 stars).  Who doesn't like an underdog story?  The movie, inspired by the events that occurred to Bethany Hamilton who, at 13 lost an arm in a shark attack, does not sensationalize its subject matter.  At heart it wants you to look past the person/ character of Bethany (played here by actress AnnaSophie Robb in an understated performance) in order to see and appreciate a life of faith and a motto of ""everything happens for a good reason; don't lose heart if that reason is not apparent to you, give it time and keep your eyes open to the bigger picture.""  I think the movie succeeds quite well in conveying its message (when Hamilton teaches Thai tidal wave refugees how to surf and, at the end of the movie, when she expresses how she was able to touch so many with one arm, far more than she could have touched or would have touched with two) but the depiction of Hamilton as such a saint, with her family circle and others all seemingly worshipping her (I know that's a bit harsh but come on! where was the strife between siblings and the teenager's rebellious spirit!?!) even prior to the arm-loss incident, distracted from the film's message.  Another thing that detracted from the film (IMO) were both Randy Quaid as the father and Helen Hunt as Bethany's mother (can someone give Hunt something to eat? she looks like the skin on her face is going to rip if she loses any more weight) as they were emotionally underwhelming in their performances (Quaid less so though).  Something that the movie has going for it is a depiction of a family whose religious values are taken seriously and credibly; it was good to see people go to church and then not to be played off as hypocrites or ""crazy fanatics"".  Carrie Underwood was wooden in her performance as Bethany's friend/ Christian counselor.  Perhaps the best part of the movie is saved for last when we see clips of and read about the real Bethany Hamilton.  It is worth watching.",1330128000,,2143,4.497422680412371
1138708,4,7799437278,"""Overall, it's a very inspirational story about overcoming numerous obstacles to achieve a dream. It also shows the love and support that the main character has from her family and friends, and how they're always there for her. And most importantly, the film reveals how Bethany Hamilton relied on her faith to help get her through the struggles she faced, and how she applied her values to whatever she was dealing with.

Yeah there were times where that Hollywood cheese makes its way in, but its never in an outlandish way. I like that they kept true to the fact that she placed 5th instead of rewriting so that she placed 1st. If they had done that, it would have ruined the message the film was trying to convey. There's another movie very much in the vein of this one because its based on a true events called Wild Hearts can't be Broken. Both girls must over come tragic events to do the thing they love most.

The movie has good actors, there aren't awkward actors who you can tell have been on the set for the first time... The quality is good as well.

The movie covers topics of: Family stress, taking things for granted, and fear (especially fear.)

I can't put a direct line for what age group I think this would be good for... It depends on whether or not your kids can handle trauma. I'd say for someone to get what's going on and for the movie to really make sense I'd say 11+ -But if you have a mature kid, take 'em!

The shark attack scene shows a shark's head coming out of the water and yanking on Bethany's arm. (You do not see her arm come off.) If you don't like blood, you won't like this scene... There is quite a lot of it. However, you can for sure tell that this scene is about to happen, there is no ""all the sudden a shark took her arm off."" There is a lot of tissue, blood, etc. hanging from her arm after the shark attack. (Take note, you may mistake some of it for the shirt that was tied around her shoulder.) -If you can handle blood, you can handle the scene. It just depends on your idea of ""graphic."" To me, it was for sure not the worst I have scene.

There is no swearing, the music is all Christian based. The movie concentrates a lot on overcoming your fears (to me anyhow)

""This is based on a true story."" A girl is born to parents who surfed; what is her destiny? She had two older brothers and learned to compete. She grew up in Hawaii next to the ocean. [No mention of a daily job.] Skateboards are another hobby. There is competition to be better. [Note the product placement in these scenes.] Can people make sense of things when they only see part of a picture? Bethany avoids a trip to stay in training. [Job over pleasure?] Her mother says ""it's your call"". [No parental advice?] The girls go surfing at night. [Did they ever read a book on shark attacks?] Fireworks at night. They are home-schooled. ""Why didn't you ask?"" There is more surfing in beautiful weather. The sudden attack is unexpected. ""Get to the reef!"" Her left arm is gone!

They meet the ambulance on the highway, transfer the patient, and rush to the hospital. Bethany survives but will have to relearn a lot of things. ""When can I surf again?"" There is anger and conflict in the family. Television news has this story (""if it bleeds, it leads""). Bethany yearns to return to surfing. At home she finds journalists with cameras to exploit this news. ""We'll take it day by day."" A TV show will pay for a prosthetic arm in return for an interview. She learns of the disadvantages. Its healing nice. ""I don't understand."" Later a shark was caught. ""It's a perfect fit."" [About eleven feet long?]

Life goes on for Alanna and Bethany. At home Bethany prepares orange juice for the family. She returns to the ocean to relearn surfing. Later she puts on the prosthetic arm and finds problems. ""People like normal."" Bethany continues to practice surfing. She enters a surfing tournament. There is a big wave that causes a problem. A broken board ends her competition. ""I can't do this anymore."" She meets her fans and gives them a present."" ""It's over."" Will she ever be the same? There is more to life than surfing.

Volunteers go to Thailand where a tidal wave destroyed people and homes. They pass out bags of rice. They hear of the disaster. Bad memories. They serve food to the hungry. Bethany uses a surf board to help children play in the ocean. She learns there is more to life than surfing. Back home Bethany gets fan mail. A board with a handle allows Bethany to compete again. Exercise strengthens her muscles.

The ""Rip Curl"" National Tournament is held in Hawaii. Bethany enters against strong competition. They paddle out into the ocean. The contest is very close, and may be over. Then a wave appears! Can they count it? No, it was after the horn. But it counts for Bethany. ""Nobody is as tough as you."" Bethany lives to surf, in spite of the drawbacks. The ending credits show the real Bethany Hamilton, and others. This shark attack occurred in 2003 when Bethany was thirteen. She later wrote a book about her life. This movie seems to have downplayed her religious life. Just what did her parents do for a living in expensive Hawaii?",1326412800,,2971,4.608695652173913

It was very uplifting & encouraging to see that even with struggles in life, someone can make a go of even the bad stuff that comes their way.  Excellent message, they did a great job with the shark attack, not making it too gory but getting the point across.  Bethany Hamilton was & is such a brave girl & inspirational.  HIGHLY recommend this movie.",1326240000,,593,4.157894736842105
1139175,1,7799437278,"Honestly, I'm not sure what is worse; having your arm bitten off by a shark or having this movie made about the incident.  While her story in itself is certainly inspirational, there is VERY little about `Soul Surfer' that is truly inspired.  Instead, the film teeters on ridiculous while it heaps clich&eacute; upon clich&eacute; on a story that should have been told a lot better.

`Soul Surfer' comes across like a television movie produced and (possibly) directed by Kirk Cameron.  I understand that God and his presence had a lot of influence on Bethany's life, but the way in which it is broached comes across very stagey and awkward.  The poor directorial choices make light of a serious subject and almost make the film's pivotal scenes come across somewhat unintentionally funny.

Yes, I laughed and I feel like a terrible person because of it.

Bethany's story is a very courageous one.  At the age of 13, and on the brink of becoming a Professional Surfer, Bethany suffered a serious injury as a result of an unexpected shark attack.  She lost her left arm.  Because of this attack, Bethany almost lost everything.  She almost lost her life, but it was her future that pressed on her the tightest.  She had to relearn everything, but she was determined to surf her heart out and she did.

The film could have grounded itself better into taking a serious look at the effect the shark attack had on young Bethany, but instead the film seems to intent on creating yet another teen flick.  The inclusion of a heartless competitor (I mean, anyone who would despise or antagonize a young girl who just lost her arm deserves a punch in the face) was a preposterous attempt to create some drama that wasn't needed since the subject itself presented enough drama (although it wasn't handled well enough to play off that drama).  The acting all around was pretty mediocre, but Carrie Underwood takes the cake as a singer (who I love BTW) who should really stay away from acting.  AnnaSophia Robb is the only standout here (Quaid and Hunt who are usually solid suffer at the melodramatic lines they are given), delivering a remarkably astute performance that feels genuine, most of the time.

Anyways, I would highly recommend watching some of the interviews with Bethany, for her story and her courageous rebound is beyond words inspiring; but skip this movie because it fails on nearly every level.",1326067200,8,2400,4.800486618004866

1139567,5,7799437278,"""Soul Surfer"" is an inspiring film based on the true story of Bethany Hamilton, an American professional surfer who's life was changed after a shark attack in which she lost her left her arm.

Without her arm and media coverage from all over the world, many witnessed Bethany Hamilton return to surfing but also to compete professionally not long after her accident.  And as simple as the story may seem, many things happened during those darker days of her life of whether or not she can function without an arm, if she can ever surf again but most importantly, what made her survive the entire ordeal.

""Soul Surfer"" is a film adaptation directed by Sean McNamara (producer and director of teen TV series ""Beyond the Break"" and ""That's So Raven"") of Bethany Hamilton's book about her life, what happened during the day of the accident and what happened afterward.

The film begins in Kauai, Hawaii where Bethany (played by Anna SophiaRobb, ""Bridge of Terabithia"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", ""Jumper"") is a normal teenage girl who loves to surf.  She hangs out with her best friend, fellow professional surfer Alana Blanchard (played by Lorraine Nicholson, ""Click, ""Something's Gotta Give"", ""World's Greatest Dad"") and for both teenagers, their dream is to become professional surfers.

But Bethany, her life is all about surfing...every day and every minute that she free time, she's surfing.

Bethany lives with her surfing family which includes her father Tom (played by Dennis Quaid), her mother Cheri (played by Helen Hunt) and her brothers Noah (played by Ross Thomas) and Tim (played by Chris Brochu).  The family is Christian and Bethany is also active with her church youth group headed by Sarah Hill (played by Carrie Underwood).

For Bethany, life is going very well and with a good showing at a competition, both she and Alana are sponsored by Rip Curl and both are looking forward to competing at the Regionals.

But one day, Bethany went out to do some morning surfing with Alana, her father Holt (played by Kevin Sorbo) and Alana's younger brother at Tunnels Beach and while out the ocean and talking with Alana while lying on her surfboard, a tiger shark attacks Bethany, ripping out her left arm.

Having lost 60% of her blood and thanks to the quick thinking of the Holt family and the medical services, Bethany was saved but her life would never be the same after the loss of her left arm.

The film would focus on the difficulties that Bethany would have with one arm but also her desire to surf once again.  But most importantly, how her faith in God and the support that she has received from family, friends and those who were inspired by her story to surf again, made her stronger and made her continue to compete as a professional surfer.

VIDEO:

""Soul Surfer"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  And once again, ""Soul Surfer"" is another film shot in Hawaii that continues my validation of how films shot at the island have looked vibrant and beautiful on Blu-ray.

The film features a good layer of grain but its the colors that are so striking.  There is a good amount of detail, the cinematography in and out of the waves are just beautiful to watch and skin tones are natural and overall look of the film is warm.

Personally, I felt that ""Soul Surfer"" looked fantastic on Blu-ray.  I didn't see any artifacts, nor did I see any banding, especially since this film is full of color.  Black levels are nice and deep and for the most part, PQ is absolutely pleasing and wonderful on Blu!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Soul Surfer"" is presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and comes with an English audio descriptive track.  The lossless audio for ""Soul Surfer"" is primarily dialogue and music-driven.  Dialogue is crystal clear and although there are not many action sequences, aside from Bethany's parents trying to escape from the media or hearing the waves crashing (which do sound very good), the film is not the type of film to expect immersive audio but for this type of film, the lossless soundtrack works wonderfully.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish, French and Portuguese.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Soul Surfer"" comes with the following special features:

  Deleted Scenes  - (3:48) A total of eight deleted scenes.
  The Making of Soul Surfer - (12:47) The making of the film, the casting of the talent, bringing in the Hamilton family to help along with the film and also Bethany's input but also the challenges the film crew faced during shooting and more.
  Surfing for the Screen: Inside the Action - (5:28) In order to make the film authentic and not be fake, the actual talent of the film were trained on how to surf.
  Becoming Bethany - (3:42) AnnaSophia Robb and Bethany Hamilton talk about meeting each other and how Robb got to learn a lot from Bethany during the making of the film.
  Heart of a Soul Surfer Documentary - (30:31) A documentary of Bethany Hamilton's upbringing, how she became a surfer, the day she lost her arm and interviews with family and friends who talk about Bethany's dedication to her faith and more.
  Bethany Hamilton On Professional Surfing - (4:54) A featurette showcasing Bethany Hamilton surfing various waves.

EXTRAS:
""Soul Surfer"" comes with a DVD version of the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Bethany Hamilton is a hero.

She inspires people with her life as a professional surfer despite having one arm, she inspires people because of her calmness and her resolve to helping others because of her faith in God and how her determination to compete with other professional surfers and not willing to be treated any differently.

Hamilton's story has been featured in the news, she won the ""Best Comeback Athlete ESPY Award, the ""Courage Award"" at the 2004 Teen Choice Awards and eventually in her career, taking first place in the 2005 National Scholastic Surfing Association (NSSA) National Championships, competing full-time on the Association of Surfing Professionals (ASP) and also for the WQS (World Qualifying Series).

As a surfer and also a person who has followed Bethany Hamilton's progress since the accident, I couldn't wait to watch ""Soul Surfer"".  Sure, we know of how inspirational her story is from various news segments and interviews done with Bethany Hamilton and of course, there is also her book that she wrote.

But sometimes, it helps people to see things visually on how Bethany was able to overcome a lot of the things in her life and that is because of her faith in God.

For me, watching ""Soul Surfer"" was pretty cool in the fact that the filmmakers wanted to make a film that was authentic.  Part of the problems that many people dislike about surfing films is their unrealistic portrayal of them and seeing a body double that looks nothing like the character.  The other is shoddy acting.

First, lets talk about the acting.

With ""Soul Surfer"", you have a talented actress with AnnaSophia Robb, granted, in real life, she is much shorter than Bethany but onscreen, viewers will probably not even care. Her performance was well-done!

But possibly one of the best things about this film is the casting.  You have two star talents with Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt playing the parents of Bethany and also, you have Carrie Underwood also playing an acting role.  Granted, she a newbie in the field of acting but the fact that this film was able to secure these three talents is pretty awesome.

But the next thing that made the film so much enjoyable is the fact that the filmmakers knew the criticism of surfing films and so they wanted to make sure the talent knew how to surf and they were filmed surfing.  So, AnnaSophia Robb, under the tutelage of Bethany's coach, learned to surf for a month, picked up quickly and started surfing each time she had a chance.

As for Bethany's parents who love to surf, Helen Hunt knows how to surf but Dennis Quaid also went through training and enjoyed surfing as well.

There is some awesome cinematography featured in the film and as mentioned, the acting is very well-done.

But I know that for some people who have criticized this film, it's about how the film showcases Bethany's faith in God.

It its important to note that for Bethany and her family, their faith is a big part of them as individuals and how they live their lives.  It was also instrumental in what brought them together during those darker moments but most importantly what made Bethany a stronger individual.  And a big reason of why she was able to surf again.

And while the film does focus on faith, the filmmakers know that there must be a compromise of how they can also reach a mass audience and not to deluge non-religious viewers by not overly focusing on the religious topics.

So, with that being said, the most you are going to see of any religion on film is when the film goes into Bethany attending her youth group or going to church (which are very short scenes) and when she goes to Thailand with her youth group to help those who were devastated by the tsunami.  But even those scenes, they are not preachy nor forcing religion in anyone's throats.

If anything, the more discussion of faith especially Bethany's faith in God is mostly featured on the special features in the Blu-ray release.

As for the Blu-ray release, the picture quality is fantastic!  I've been on the record of saying how outdoor shots, especially in Hawaii have looked fantastic on Blu-ray and that goes the same for ""Soul Surfer"". This is a beautiful film on Blu-ray and colors are vibrant.  The lossless audio is primarily dialogue and musically driven but there are good moments of hearing constant wave crashing that sounds very good on Blu-ray.  Granted, it would have been even better to give the wave crashing sounds a more immersive soundscape through all channels but for the most part, the soundtrack is appropriate for this film.  And of course, there are a good number of special features included on the Blu-ray.

Overall, there is really nothing negative to say about this film.  It's a straightforward film about Bethany, her darker days and her return to surfing and competing and as a person who has been inspired by Bethany Hamilton's story and now watching that story on film, I was pretty impressed by the film.  Inspiring, entertaining and yes, even brought me to tears a few times during the film.

The teenager Bethany Hamilton, a keen and tallented surfer lost her left arm in a shark attack and courageously overcame all odds to become a champion again through sheer determination and unwaving faith. Bethany's feisty determination and steadfast beliefs spur her towards an adventurous comeback that gives her the grit to turn her loss into a gift for others. The filming itself is fantastic inside thunderous wave barrels, alongside the moving boards and under water. Great value for the money!",1319241600,,625,4.961904761904762
1139857,5,7799437278,"If you are offended by a positive portrayal of Christianity, avoid this picture. Otherwise, this is a must see movie. Film critic Roger Moore considered this the best faith movie made (at least of recent years -- I doubt he's saying this is better than classics like ""Ben Hur"", ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Lillies Of The Field"" and ""Chariots of Fire""). But I consider this movie to be more comparable with ""Rocky"" than ""Facing The Giants"".

This movie is very well put together. Let me give an example. Towards the beginning of the movie, the main character and others are going to an outdoor church service. You know it's a church service because a band is singing the praise song ""Blessed Be The Name of the Lord"". For those familiar with the lyrics, the song is about praising God in good times and in tough times, when He gives and when He takes away. The song's theme was particularly relevant to the movie.

This movie is based on a true story. The real family are Christians and they lobbied to keep their faith from the editing room floor. Thus, you have a Christian perspective. But I consider this movie to fit more into the genre of a sports movie than a faith movie. The main character is a competitive athlete. The villain in the film is not the shark but the main rival. The climax does not deal with overcoming fear of returning to the water (there wasn't really any) or the struggles with lacking an arm, but with the competitor leaving their all on the court -- or in this case, the waves.

Another note. Some reviewers don't like any Christianity in the movie. But this movie is not preachy. It deals with how their faith impacted their life, but there are no conversion scenes. There is a missions trip, but that trip is more humanitarian than obvertly a preaching tour.

Knowing the theme, I was surprised the movie only had a PG rating, without the unlucky number following it. Seeing it, I can see why. Of course, parents, watch the film with your children and discuss the aspects with them.

I don't expect any Oscar buzz about this movie. But it definitely is worth your time.",1319241600,,2097,4.551724137931035

It has some sad moments, some reconnecting moments and then some truly inspirational moments. Dennis Quaid & Helen Hunt are great as always, but it's AnnaSophia Robb as Bethany Hamilton that steals the show.

A good reminder how blessed we truly are.  That even in terrible circumstances, God has a beautiful plan through those painful and confusing times.  Our human time line and perspective is so short (we have an eternity to look forward to - if we know Jesus), we are so narrow focused (typically focus only on self), and we don't trust God enough (he is the creator and father that loves us).  We need more films like this one!

I found it Amazon and they have both read it. My Little girl is 10 and my boy is almost 7. I wasn't sure if He would be O K with the shark scene. It was really amazing how quickly it occurred. The scene was realistic without being gory.  In a split second this young girls life was changed but not altered.
 My kids often refer to Bethany Hamilton when they are faced with challenges. She is a fantastic gift to humanity. In a time where kids are subjected to any number manufactured role models, here is a true spiritual giant. Her faith, grit and perseverance are a reminder to all of us that, regardless of the hand life deals us, faith is our ace in the hole. Soul Surfer is a valuable message for tough times.

I was really excited to see this film. But this movie is quite possibly the worst movie they could have possibly done. The script makes you cringe every few seconds, it is shallow and boring. The acting is dreadful. I don't know why they chose this young actress Robb, she is dreadful in this role. Flat, and teeny bopper. Amazingly, what could be a really cool flick is full of cliches. But the other actors, except Helen Hunt, of course, are also really really bad. I'm so sad, especially for Bethany, that this film is so incredibly lacking in depth and entertainment, that I have to give it 1 star. I was so bored and disappointed that had to turn it off halfway through it. I finally forced myself to finish watching it. Let me share something with you that will give you an indication of how bad it is. Every time that a mainstream surf movie comes out, the surf industry plans ahead to release a higher number of goods (wetsuits, surfboards, apparel) that are related to the movie, as they expect an increase in sales. Well, O'Neill in Santa Cruz, Rip Curl and Roxy all increased the production of women's related surf goods to coincide with the release of Soul Surfer. Well, turns out this movie is so bad, that the surf industry lost out. And they have an overstock of girl surfing goods. They didn't sell, so now they're cutting women's styles for the next season. Wow, right? It's terrible, actually, that we can't get a GOOD INSPIRING GIRL SURF FILM. The true story is inspiring: you're better off seeing her documentary as well as interviews on You tube. I believe there are now several books out as well. Don't waste your time and money. It's so drab. So sorry Bethany, you rock...",1317081600,9,1836,4.533132530120482

At least it wouldn't seem like it'd be easy to do so, anyway. Of course, there have been plenty of surfer movies made in the past. This one definitely had a different vibe to it, partly because it was based on a true story. That's not to say that other surfer movies haven't been based on true stories. With this one, as I was watching it, I really felt like I could connect with the girl and everything that happened to her. I'm not saying that I went through the same things that she did, but that I was able to lose myself in the film's subject matter and feel as though I was there. It's rare for a movie to be able to do that with me. When it happens, it truly is an amazing experience for me. There are very few movies that actually legitimately make me feel like crying. My Dog Skip always makes me cry every time I watch it. Soul Surfer made me be on the verge of crying at certain points.

Having Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt as part of the cast made the movie all the more enjoyable, but I'd have to say the drama of the whole movie was a little flat. The despair and struggle of losing a limb like this, not to mention the collateral effects on friends and family, seemed to be a barely perceptible transition from one state to the next. Also, the Christian theme underlying Bethany's ability to cope with this loss seemed merely incidental, instead of the bedrock foundation upon which she was able to soar through the struggles with a nearly super-human composure.

When I purchased ""SOUL SURFER"" I knew there would be a shark attack scene and I was not sure I would appreciate such a horrendous scene. Yet when it happened in the movie the scene was so well shot and expertly directed that I was not grossed out! The beautiful star AnnaSophia Robb playing the lead role was utterly convincing as Bethany Hamilton.

It was truly amazing and I loved every second of it. After the movie you can't help but feel really emotional and optimistic. You feel like nothing can really get you down. If this 13 year old girl can get back in the water after the shark attack, then anyone can do anything!
What I really loved was that during the credits, they show home footage of the real Bethany Hamilton training to surf with one arm (her brother in the film was taping her the whole time and they show the footage her real life brother shot).

The story line has it all including inspiration, drama, comedy, faith, competition, courage, determination and gorgeous photography of the Hawaiian waves and curls that takes your breath away.  Be ready to tear up at times as even the tough 17 year olds did and the retired sheriff did as well.  One of the best aspects of the film is that it is about a family and friends who stick together, have fun and never quit.  Bethany Hamiliton continues to be a pro surfer even after a shark takes her arm, an experience where most of us would give up.  The cutbacks to the real family at the end and the fact that Bethany did some of the surfing sequences is an added plus as well as the great performances by the stars Dennis Quaid, Helen Hunt and Carrie Underwood.

Her (true) story just moved our entire family and lifted us up in so many ways. We are reminded throughout this movie that God can take any situation, yes even the really bad ones, and bring something better than you could ever imagine out of it. This true story had me crying, cheering, and feeling a deep sense of awe at just how amazing our God is. This is one of those few movies that I can recommend to anyone without the least hesitation. There are so many Biblical truths paralleled and reiterated in the various events in Soul Surfer. For me, without giving too much of the movie away, there is a scene where Bethany is waiting for a wave, while others ask, ""What is she doing?"" This to me is a great example of faith--believing without seeing.
There are some big names and great acting in this picture, and the movie is not shy about giving the glory to Jesus. This story is like this generation's ""Joni"" in many ways. Soul Surfer would be a great movie for family movie night, or any time for that matter. This is one we want in our video collection, it's that good. Don't know what to watch?

1141494,1,7799437278,"I unwittingly assumed that the title ""Soul Surfer"" reflected the term as understood by surfers and implying
by definition no contest surfing or competitive spirit.  Well, i was clearly wrong on that.  Not only did
it not mean that, it meant Soul as in Christian, save your soul.

To add to the disappointment:
the movie never really shows the suffering, frustration, and hard work that must have been part of her
recovery and her life.  For example, when she looks in the mirror at herself after her stub of an arm
is uncovered there is a brief pause where you can sense her discomfort, but nothing heavy, like it must
have really felt at all !!! The director didn't go there.  And, she is shown working out, but it's in a
""Rocky"" type set of scenes where she goes from one exercise to the next with eye of the tigerish sound
in the background.  No real struggle shown here again.

I was really looking forward to this movie and was extremely disappointed.  It was like some kind of surfy Christian motivational porn.

As with Christmas and Easter ( to name a couple ) Christians are now usurping surfing and surfing success.

If you want to watch a surfing movie, rent Endless Summer for the 46th time and you will be much happier
than if you watch this.

I have a problem with a ""youth leader"" showing cleavage at a worship service (or anywhere for that matter), and all the SKIN shown so close up. I personally know of brothers in Christ who chose not to see this movie after hearing about it, because they had struggled with pornography in the past. It was just another example fo the ""worldly church"" to me. We'll dress like strippers, have a pretty youth counselor with low cut clothing, add a few lines on prayer or ""you can do anything"", then we'll get the world AND the Christians to spend money on this movie. We may even deceive the church into showing it at their ""movie night"". God help us! I don't mean to be grim, but my heart grieves over what ""Christianity"" has become these days and this is just another example of that very thing.  Basically, I think it was just another big money raiser with a little bit of God mixed in to draw the Christians.

1141774,5,7799437278,"This is an excellent movie, following the tale of teen surfer Bethany Hamilton. Christian and moral values are well portrayed and Bethany is a good example and an inspiration for people around the world. My only concern is that, with all the beach scenes, skimpy bathing suits are common. And while the shark attack by itself isn't scary (as it is very brief and little is seen of the shark), the paddling to shore and frenzied drive to the hospital can be rather frightening for young children.

1141775,5,7799437278,"I remember hearing about Bethany Hamilton's frightening ordeal of losing her arm (and nearly her life) to a shark attack while surfing. When the movie was released, I hoped for two things: (1) that it would relfect Bethany's faith and how that faith saw her through horrific trauma in her life and (2) that it would be a family movie. The movie met my expectations on both accounts.

Family unity and loyalty is strong in Soul Surfer and that is one of my favorite things about the movie. It's apparent that Bethany, her parents, and her brothers are a closeknit family and that they truly care for each other. When times are difficult, we need those we love most to come alongside us. Bethany is also surrounded by loyal friends, who rally around her, not only during her surfing competitions, but also after her accident. What amazed me was that she and her best friend competed in competitions, yet they didn't allow that to interfere in their friendship. What an example of how to love your neighbor!

There are many opportunities for discussion in this film:

1. Bethany sneaks out at night to go surfing. I'm not sure she had a consequence, but this provided a great discussion point nonetheless.

2. There is a girl Bethany surfs against who is spiteful and mean. How should we handle people like that in our own lives?

3. At one point, Bethany becomes discouraged about what happened. Why do bad things happen? Does the Lord distance himself from us during those times? Or does He forever remain by our side, never leaving us and never forsaking us?

4. Another great discussion topic is about modesty, as at times, the bathing suits are a bit immodest. And finally,

5. Bethany embarks on a missions trip. At times when we feel as though things couldn't be any worse in our lives, all we have to do is look around and see the pain and the suffering of others. Then, reach out and offer assistance.

I loved this movie. Yes, I bawled after Bethany was injured (I'm a mom after all!) and yes, I bawled at the end. It is a powerful movie that points to God, family, and determination. I would highly recommend it for those ages tween and up. Younger children will be frightened by the shark attack, although it was tastefully done and not prolonged. I have added this movie to my listing of family movies on my Mom-Approved Movie Listing on my Wordpress blog.

1141779,4,7799437278,"This is one of those films I was somewhat reluctant to see. I knew of the story of Bethany Hamilton, because I remember when the shark attack on her happened. I was half expecting this to be a extremely sad and depressing film, which I don't enjoy watching. This film is far from that though. Despite the tragic event it's based on, the film is very uplifting, has a lot of heart, and yet it's entertaining. It's been a few days since I watched it, but the film still remains in my mind. Few films have that lasting effect on me. I was quite touched by the closeness of the Hamilton Family too, and Bethany's beautiful outlook on people and life.

It's pretty clear now that the religious message of the film, and the families reliance on religion, has rubbed a few reveiwers the wrong way. As a guy who hasn't taken a step inside a church in years, and who still has no plans to anytime soon, I'm quite perplexed by the negative reactions. First of all, the film is about a person and a family that is deeply religious. Religion, like it or not, clearly plays a huge part in these people everyday lives. And I don't think Bethany ever claimed to be perfect. Sure she defied her parents by going out late before the attack, but she was still very young and still a kid. I think people need to lighten-up with that. I didn't think the film tried to knock-me-over-the-head with religion, it was just a part of who the family is and how they chose to deal with a tragedy that may have left a majority of people in a funk for years and years. Heck that's the one part of religion I actually respect. I mean I can be as cynical as anyone, but this seemed a story as much about love and perseverance as anything else. I don't know how to not like it.",1313452800,7,1744,4.268882175226586
1141780,1,7799437278,"Let me point out first that I respect and admire Bethany Hamilton for her strength and courage. Let me also point out that she is not the first, not the hardest ever stricken by tragedy. And finally that her story deserved something better than this soap opera...
Acting is lame at best, dialogues shallow , the actors are all beautiful, zero fat, caucasian beverly hills types, intelligent, caring, warm , nice, just never showing any defect whatsoever ...
The main actress, AnnaSophia Robb, has the athleticism of a dead fish, is half the size of the real Bethany,and nothing like her in character. A cute teen all right, the typical ""material"" for ""teen crush"" or ""teen horror"" cheap flicks..definitely out of place in a story like this one..
But the worst part is the offensive and misleading way in which religion is used in this cheap flick. I have respect for the role that religion has had in Bethany's recovery, and just because of that respect I am offended by the ""valium for the masses"" way in which religion is treated here. Instead of taking the chance to investigate, reflect or question on the ""problem of evil"" the story writers chose the disgusting approach of connecting it with ""morals"". In the first part of the movie Bethany disobeys her parents (very mildly, just going to a night surf party..) and prefers to spend her time training instead of going to Mexico on a charitable mission. But luckily a ""shark on a mission"" will soon amputate her arm to bring her back on the ""good road"" so that she never disobeys her parents again, and goes on to relieve the sorrows of the poor people hit by the tsunami... This is a perfect compendium of the sick way in which religion is used to keep adults in an childish state of mind. Obey the authority or you will be punished, and if something evil happens is just because you were not obedient enough...and I won't even go into the hypocrisy of thinking that a trip to visit the tsunami stricken populations or the poor people in mexico could do anything useful for something other than one's won ego...
In the end ""Bethany"" is asked if she could go back would she still go surfing the day she got attacked by the shark? First: I know journalist are often idiots, but can you conceive a dumbest question??  Second: she goes on answering ""Yes, I would, because that gave me the chance to embrace more people than I could have with two arms"". Please. That might have been a great sentence if it was ""Of course I would not, you dumbass! Who would be so idiotic to go have his arm chopped by a shark?? But I am still glad that this sad accident has given me the chance to embrace more people than I could do with two arms.."" This part reminds me of a genial italian comedian, Massimo Troisi.. he plays a scene in one of his movies in which he reacts a little skeptically to a priest trying to convince him that disgraces in life are actually a gift that God makes to his beloved ones. And when the priest, seeing his incredulity, says: ""I will pray for you"", Troisi answer ""Please no, or He might give some gift to me as well.. "" :)

It's got great actors in it and I remember when I heard in the news about the true story of Bethany Hamilton being attacked in 2003 and losing an arm. Some may be put off by the fact that this film does have a strong presence of Christianity in it. And most would be correct to feel that way as films made with Christianity as its base (i.e.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fireproof-Blu-ray/dp/B001HN68ZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fireproof [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Facing-the-Giants-Blu-ray/dp/B002EYLOE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Facing the Giants [Blu-ray</a>]) have been a little too cheesy and/or too preachy.

Don't get me wrong, though, just because this film does have Christianity as just one of its facets, it's not what the entire film revolves around. ""Soul Surfer"" hits all the right marks in acting (well, except maybe Carrie Underwood; one can tell she's not a professional actress and it should stay that way), direction (by surfer Sean McNamara), story, pacing, setting, and -- most important with a film like this -- surfing. Hunt, Quaid and Sorbo all give great performances, but the best here -- as it should be -- is AnnaSophia Robb. This film proves that she is star material! The film is inspirational, showcasing the potential of the best in people. It sort of reminds me of that famously great quote from Jor-El to his son Kal-El (Superman) in the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-The-Movie-Blu-ray/dp/B000K4X5XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman - The Movie [Blu-ray</a>]: ""They can be a great people, Kal-El, they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way."" Bethany Hamilton wishes to be that ""light"" to show people she meets ""the way.""

I'll be frank: it focuses a lot on Bethany's faith in God, and her struggles with His will for her life. The directors spent more time trying to make this movie as accurate to her experiences as possible; to the extent that they actually filmed real surfing, choosing not to go with any of the ""green screen shots."" They also had some of the actors/actresses live with the person they were playing to allow them to bond and learn more about them. @ Vince's 1 star review, he seems to be an actor who got rejected from a casting session for this movie and therefore has absolutely nothing good to say about it. Whether you are a Christian or not, I fully recommend this movie. The religious aspect of this movie is not aimed at converting anyone. It is simply depicting the beliefs of one person who suffered a tragic loss. You wouldn't let someone outside the new local restaurant, professing to be a Christian, prevent you from stopping to try the food. So don't jump to a conclusion that this is a bad movie just because some hacked off juvenile person decided to blow up about religion. Whether you are a Christian or just an average everyday person looking for a good movie, this is an awesome movie for anyone.

I was curious as to how you even begin to grasp being able to do just do the simple things, like put your hair in a ponytail, hook your bikini top, slice a tomato....you know, the normal things that you take for granted, until you aren't able to do those things without a huge undertaking.  Bethany's attack by the shark while out surfing with friends is very close to the beginning of the movie, so much of the movie his how she has doubts, how it isn't easy and though she is determined, how she isn't sure she will be able to come back to surf at all, much less compete.

Before I read other comments I would not have felt that this movie was overly religious or preachy.  Yes she is in a youth ministry, and like most of us, wonders why obstacles are put in her place or why bad things happen to good people.  For many, faith, whether in one's self, God, or a higher power gets people through, I certainly don't have a problem with the few times that she mentioned her faith.  It didn't detract from the movie for me or make me feel that anything was being pushed at me.

This is a good movie that aside from the shark attack, where it would be too scary for small kids, shows kids (all ages) that you can achieve if you set your mind to it, are willing to put everything into it and have faith in yourself.

She is one of those people who refuse to let anything get in their way - either physically or mentally. There have been countless people like her who not only overcame a tragedy - but went on to do truly amazing things. I believe that it's not what you go through - it's how you go through it - that will either make or break you.

I cried quite a few times while watching this. Her range of emotions following a sudden ""disability"" that threatened to limit her great aspirations reminded me of my husband. He lost his vision 26 years ago, and then was diagnosed with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma shortly after that. He beat it like a champ, and was back to work the minute he was able. He pushed forward and excelled despite on-going, life-threatening health issues. He rarely complained or felt sorry for himself, but when he did he'd actually apologize, feel horrible about it and then resolve himself to use his unique experiences to do something inspiring and positive.

Last year he survived non-Hodgkins lymphoma and B-cell follicular cancer by undergoing a stem cell transplant. His body had been through so much for so long, and that ordeal was nothing short of a living hell for him. The radiation he received at age 19 caused second and third degree burns from head to toe due to the radical chemotherapy that was necessary to save him at age 45. ""Radiation recall"" often leads to death because it is similar to being severely burned by a fire ... and in his case it was both internally and externally.

But he trudged through it and jumped right back into his music career three months after the transplant. Last night, a little over a year later, his band opened for a nationally acclaimed act and the show was sold out.

While scare at first of being unable to surf again, she was never afraid to swim in the very waters where she was bitten before. She always talk about her faith and how it helped to overcome the attack and being a surf champion. The scene were was was a misionary in Thailand, after the 2003 tsunami, was very moving and has lots of insights...Bethany was a great example of compassion!!! You can watch movies or read about people who overcomed great obstacles: Rick Allen of the english band, Def Leppard loosed one arm on a car accident, but the CD ""Hysteria"", with Allen at the electronic drums, became one of the largest selling CD in Rock music hystory. Or perhaps Ludwig Van Beethoven(1770-1827), who became deaf at age 30 and struggled with poverty and depression, but composed wonderful pieces of music, not to mention The 9th Symphony's ""Ode to Joy"". Johann Sebastian Bach was blind at old age, but composed the Branderburg Concertos. Mahatma Gandhi nor the Dalai Lama, weren't christians and the list may go on and on, but a strong faith in something grater than us, molded the greatest achievements in human history. Bethany Hamilton is another beautiful example. I strongly recommend the movie to chistians, budists, atheists or muslims alike. We all are one!!

what this movie does not show very much of is the strugles she went through day to day
Taking a shower is extreemly frustrating with one arm (with the left arm gone, you can never clean the right side of your body without help) something as simple as putting on your pants is a major chore, putting on a t-shirt takes forever.  Dealing with the fact that your body thinks your arm is there (been there done that, and it is very scarry). relearning how to balance with only 1 arm (try scateboarding with 1 arm tied to your side). If you want to experience part of what she went through, tie 1 arm to your body and go 24 hours using only 1 arm.

I love the religious theme to this movie, not everyone will appreciate that God helped her through this extreemly difficult time of life, she would say that she couldn't have done it without God.

If you are not religious, where do you go or who do you go to when you fail yourself completely? when you have feelings of total failure that you cannot overcome, feeling of total uselessness, when you are incapable of caring for yourself. Where do you turn?",1312761600,,1169,4.280542986425339

Nothing to do with a mythical fairytale that supposedly happened 1200 years ago(ie the bible).

Talk about defying the odds-13 year old Bethany Hamilton loses her left arm to a shark attack while surfing and is back in the water in just three weeks! Remarkable,yes,but it was her faith in God that kept her going,even when she experienced times of frustration. Kudos to the producers for their excellent casting choices-everyone involved was wonderful. One performance I must comment on is that of Kevin Sorbo,who played Holt Blanchard,the man who saved Bethany's life. Although his screen time was limited,Kevin made the most of it,playing a man whose quick action and thinking made the difference and prevented almost certain death for Bethany,but at the hosptial,credited Bethany with keeping him calm and rational during that tense time. Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt were great as Bethany's parents,whose faith never waivered throughout the whole ordeal. Carrie Underwood was good in her film debut. One minor quip I have is that there should have been some direct interaction between Tom & Holt since they are best friends,but that doesn't take away from the relationship shown between the two families and the support they show to Bethany and Alana.

Partly because I was busy, but partly because I was turned off by how heavily it was marketed on the Christian radio stations in town.  Then again, I'm rarely drawn to stories about overcoming tragic personal injury when they're fresh ...

But after reading several positive reviews, and even reflecting on the few negative ones I did find, I decided to rent Soul Surfer this weekend.  I wasn't disappointed.

The entire cast puts together an amazing performance, and the emotional back and forth displayed by AnnaSophia Robb in the lead role is spectacular.  Having know much of the real-life story beforehand, it was easy to figure out when certain events were going to play out.  But that didn't detract from the story or the experience of watching it unfold on screen.

In particular, the story of a teenager just experiencing the life-changing loss of a limb pouring out emotion over someone else's loss during a missions trip puts a lot of things in perspective and turns what began as a heartwarming underdog story into a powerful piece of inspiration.  Then seeing the same person overcome their injury to accomplish something many otherwise capable uninjured persons can't shows both the power of her character and the depth of the human  spirit.

There is nothing I would complain about in this film, though young children may be scared when the girl's arm is bit off by a shark.

Well they're wrong, the movie had a very good meaning to it, and in no way deliberately forced a religion onto them.

1142433,5,7799437278,"Soul Surfer will give any age viewer an honest look of youth at its best. Bethany Hamilton's story of loosing her arm while surfing was world news, then a book, and now done in film form. It's an amazing story of one girl, her family, her friends, her church, and what can be accomplished not only through recovery but a continuing life of giving others an outlook of HOPE. She is one remarkable girl, a must-see film. The DVDs has a warning about the intense accident scene but it is actually not that bad. Of course there are lots of heavenly panoramas since the film is shot in Hawaii.

Regardless of faith preference, Bethany has to give others with similar struggles a leap in optimism. For those who have been fortunate to never before dealt with a life/death episode; this can give you a taste of what it is like. This child looked to her faith. It was my nephew who encouraged my wife and I to get this DVD to view.

There are those who oppose the Christian dialogue and direction that the family of Bethany, and she herself take. But that IS the truth of this Christian family. If anything it is downplayed, but not much, as the Bethany and her family was adamant that viewers hear the true story of how and why they feel Bethany survived. Bethany becomes a champion pro-surfer, with only one arm; the film and in real life. Plenty of big names acting in this film such as Dennis Quaid as Dad; Helen Hunt as Mom, AnnaSophia Robb plays Bethany and seems almost a double to the real surfer. Singer Carrie Underwood has a non-singing role.

SUBTITLES available in English, Spanish & French. Audio also in Eng & French options.
BONUS is fantastic, as good as the feature and probably longer.

1142434,5,7799437278,"I must admit I wasn't sure I'd like this movie. When I heard the Family Friendly, religious/spiritual, Christian appellations being thrown around i was skeptical. I avoided it in the theaters because of this - my mistake.
 Even with the outstanding cast of Dennis Quaid, Helen Hunt, Keven Sorbo, Craig T. Nelson and the lovely irrepressible AnnaSophia Robb, I was wary. I was wrong.
I knew it was about Bethany Hamilton and remembered the 2003 shark attack incident but that was about it. After reading up about her online and watching some You Tube videos I decided to give it a try. I loved it! Not as sappy sentimental as I feared it would be, not as 'preachy' as I expected it to be and definitely not as cheesy as most of these type of films are. This is a professionally made story of a surfer girl, a champion athlete, who happens to live her Christian witness every day of her life and actually believes in a matter of fact way you don't often see portrayed on film.
 The surfing scenes are real, not hopped up or CGI exaggerated for excitement, this is the authentic thing. The acting is very good to outstanding. The story is beautiful and presents a real family as normal with normal problems but not dysfunctional as so many other movies both regular and Christian do for dramatic effect.  Granted, they do live in Paradise (according to many, not me, never wanted to go there) and the laid back lifestyle is revealed in all its happiness and joy that many who live there brag about.
I recommend this movie to anyone wanting to be uplifted regardless if they are Christian or not, religious/spiritual or not but can appreciate life to the full.",1312502400,13,1656,4.587837837837838

Bethany Hamilton is an amazing person and was even at a young age. The acting in this movie is great!

1142440,5,7799437278,"""Soul Surfer"", the movie adaptation of the 2004 Bethany Hamilton Biography of the same title, is a life-affirming, as well as faith-enriching and spiritually-stirring, film not to be missed.

Directed by Sean McNamara (""The Suite Life Movie"" [2011] and ""The Even Stevens Movie"" [2003]), ""Soul Surfer"" is an excellent film for family viewing. Anna Sophia Robb, ""Race to Witch Mountain"" [2009], lead an amazing cast. Dennis Quaid (Academy Award nominee for Best Supporting Actor, 1973) Helen Hunt (Academy Award winner for Best Actress, 1997), Carrie Underwood in her acting debut (multi-Grammy Award winner), Craig T. Nelson (Emmy Award winner, 1992), and Kevin Sorbo (t.v. star of ""Hercules"" and ""Andromeda"") along with several others did an excellent job portraying family and friends coping with life-altering circumstances. For brevity's sake, my review is broken down into cons and pros of the film.

Negative: (1) The film takes a bit more dramatic license regarding the rivalry between the surfing competitors than the book portrays. (2) The film may appear ""sugary"" or ""cheesy"" at times when dealing with difficulties encountered such as Ms. Hamilton's way of helping some of the 2004 Indian Ocean and Tsunami victims or Ms. Hamilton's statement at the end of the film.

Positive: (1) It's an unbelievably, true story. (2) It is a well-casted film. (3) The cinematography and surf scenes are a joy to watch. (4) It is family-oriented in the way films were before the 1968 MPAA rating system came into existence.

In conclusion, if you are looking for a film to watch with your parents, siblings, younger family members (7-12 yrs old), or grandparents, then I highly suggest ""Soul Surfer"" is the one for everyone to enjoy. It's universal tale of struggle and triumph will have you in tears before you cheer.",1312329600,2,1813,5.135593220338983
1142441,5,7799437278,"While I was generally familiar with the story of this young girl prior to watching the movie, I just knew the basics - young surfer who had her arm bitten off by a shark, she made a recovery, and was surfing again.  I didn't know she was a competitive surfer who made a truly miraculous comeback and was back on an international competitive circuit.  I was very impressed with this movie for a variety of reasons.

One thing I will point out is when we watched this, we had an age range of 9 years old to 71 watching it - this is truly a great family movie which is pretty hard to find these days.  Be prepared to tear up several times in the movie as well as feel a burst of pride as Bethany goes through her recovery.

The family leans hard on their faith in God to get them through this struggle - most movies with this type of theme fail because you feel as if the faith aspect is being put in front of the tale of the movie.  Not so in this case, but it is a refreshing thing for me to see - I believe God does have a plan and Bethany learns the plan is not for her to be a #1 ranked surfer, but for her to be an example to others worldwide for those with disabilities to overcome.

The acting was very good in this one, with Helen Hunt providing her usual outstanding job, Dennis Quaid continuing his kind of goofy but still a role model characterization, and Carrie Underwood doing a believable job of a youth / missions leader.  I've never really noticed Anna Sophia Robb until this movie - she is an up and coming actress who should be in leading roles for years to come.",1312329600,11,1580,4.1237785016286646
1142442,5,7799437278,"I have seen this movie twice, once with my children (ages 4, 5, and 8) and once with my husband. He's from CA and loves surfing so I thought he'd enjoy it too. It really is a very good movie. The only scary/questionable part is the shark attack, and even that is not particularly GORY. It's just very emotional (especially for me as a mom, when Bethany's mom sees the ambulance carrying her daughter drive by and breaks down... wow). I thought all  of the actors did a great job (well maybe not so much the guys playing her older brothers, but they were minor characters really). Even if you are not Christian and do not particularly like ""spiritual"" movies, that's only one element of the story. The real story is about the girl and how she overcomes this event in her life. And really, it's about surfing. I would say at least 25% of the movie is just gorgeous scenes of Hawaiian surfing. You can't really go wrong with that.",1312243200,6,927,4.421052631578948
1142544,1,7799437278,"While I applaud Bethany, and understand what a problem she must have had getting accustomed to her disability. I am NOT an overtly preachy christian. I was glad to read the reviews that basically spelled out exactly what this film was trying to get past us.  I have had more than enough Christians acting on my behalf and trying to get me to believe in their god to ""heal me"" it is a load of pablum fed to the masses, and I am sorry that religion has reared its head to ruin what I thought was going to be an awesome movie.",1311638400,22,523,4.127450980392157
1142545,5,7799437278,"I didn't know who Bethany Hamilton was when I saw this movie.  She is now an inspiration to me.  This movie sucks you in from moment one.  It has a great cast.  I love how they put God, worship, and trials to face into this movie.  My most favorite line in the movie is when her mom and her were lying on her bed and she asked ""Mom, what guy will ever want me like this?""  And her mom replied...well watch the movie and you will know :-)",1311292800,,437,3.909090909090909
1142546,5,7799437278,"I have a hard time reviewing ""Soul Surfer"" because I liked the movie a lot (five stars) but I squirmed in my seat a little when the Christian stuff came up.  If the heroine had been a devout Hindu or Buddhist or even Muslim I don't think the religious content would have bothered me.  But hyping Christianity makes me want to duck and hide.  I know this is a personal problem.  It has to do with politics rather than religion.  In the U.S. fundamentalist Christianity is connected to the Tea Party movement, which I absolutely abhor (I'm convinced Jesus would too).  In a nut shell, I really liked the fact that the movie had great actors, no profanity or toilet humor, a great message of acceptance and inclusion, wonderful characters.  And I didn't even know I personally had a problem with Christian content until I saw the movie.  And I hate myself for being so narrow minded.  As far as I know, in real life the heroine and her family are very religious and the movie got it just right.  I'm going to work on keeping politics out of how I view entertainment, or religion for that matter.",1310860800,23,1092,4.46969696969697
1142547,4,7799437278,"I admit that I am not normally one who likes to have faith mixed in with my movie.  I normally find myself more interested in the fantastical worlds such as Mirrormask, the amazing adventures of Doctor Who, the mindless bloodshed of Resident Evil, or the quirky humor of Shawn of the Dead than an inspirational film such as this.  But every once in awhile I find a little gem that is just too good to not watch, and this movie most definitely fits the bill.

Some people have issue with the faith based overtones.  I've though about it for awhile and decided that this is my answer to those issues:  It doesn't matter if a film has a Christian overtone, Buddhist overtone, no overtone, somewhat of a maybe overtone or whatever.  A good movie is a good movie, and this film is definitely a good movie.  From what I've seen in interviews and the like, Bethany and her family are deeply religious people whose faith helped them deal with this.  I would say that if there WASN'T an overtone it would do the story a disservice.

So why the 4 stars?  This is a slight bit of overacting at parts in my opinion, plus, while I find this an excellent film I do not put it with my favorite all time films ever.  I would give it a 4.5 but that is not an option.",1310515200,26,1249,4.272340425531915

This film shows the importance of family and friends when times are tough. It stayed true to Bethany's story and portrayed all of the real life characters accurately. Her best friend, Alana Blanchard is a main character as well and it shows the rescue exactly as she described it in past interviews. All in all, it's a great film for anyone and everyone.

It is everything I am looking for in a good movie. Drama, warmth, realism, up-lifting. This young girl is a real inspiration. There are those who might not want to watch because the message is overtly Christian, but I would ask the question, ""Have you seen the movie, Ghandi? Or Seven Years in Tibet?""

I also love how she reminded her brother that they need to give thanks before they eat. If anyone could've forgotten to be thankful it could've very easily been her. She has such a lovely spirit and such determination. I love how she was still willing to compete and do her best. The scenes with her training were so awesome. I can't even do push ups with 2 arms! She has such a blessed life and God certainly is using her. I love this movie. I also love how she went to help out in Thailand and encouraged the little boy to get into the water. I also love how she didn't even get sad when the boy poked the stub of her missing arm. She just laughed and said ""Something's missing huh?"" She has an amazing drive.

I really loved how they had the video footage and pictures at the end of the movie of Bethany after the shark attack with her achievements. AnnaSophia Robb did an amazing job portraying Bethany Hamilton. You can really tell that AnnaSophia spent some time with Bethany before this movie was made because she could not of been more believable throughout the movie.

1142649,5,7799437278,"Most of us have heard of Bethany Hamilton, or at least of the surfer girl who lost her arm to a shark off the coast of Kauai. Fewer people know that she came from a Christian family, and that her faith played a huge part in her overcoming this obstacle and continuing on to become a national surf champion.

""Soul Surfer"" features Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt as the parents, and AnnaSophia Robb (from ""Bridge to Terebithia"") does a great job in the role of Bethany. The film starts with some scenes establishing her family's faith and their playful fun together. All of them have surfing background and interest, and their lives on the Hawaiian Islands are portrayed in heartwarming ways that only add to the coming terror. The movie gives us some great surfing scenes, some beautiful photography, and when it reaches the moment of the shark attack, we are fully engaged. Although restrained in its showing of the violence, it captures the horrible feeling of loss, fear, and parental anxiety.

Soon, Bethany is questioning God's plan in all this, since her surfing days could be over. She wonders how she'll ever find a guy who will love her with only one arm. And she watches her best friend be featured in Rip Curl promotions, while she stands on the sidelines and bravely supports her. She also struggles with media attention, not to mention the expected challenges of cutting oranges and putting on her own clothes. The special effects are well done, and we feel the anguish of not only Bethany, but of her parents as well. They are strong in their faith, but they are not perfect, and each member of the family has an issue to deal with, whether its the father's desire to push his daughter back into surfing, or the mother's desire to help her daughter accept her new physical appearance as one of true beauty. We also have Carrie Underwood playing the role of Bethany's youth pastor, there to offer hugs, love, advice, and a life-changing trip to Thailand after the devastating tsunami.

For those who find any of this cheesy or too easy, they are missing the point. This is based on a true story. It's not pie-in-the-sky answers given in a fictitious setting, but the real-life struggles of the Hamiltons, and how God sustained them through some tough times. Bethany's own answers to the reporters are often word-for-word from actual interviews, where she gave impromptu responses. With even Roger Ebert giving this movie a good review, it's hard to imagine why some viewers seem to have an ax to grind with the faith element. While some movies are nothing more than sermons tacked onto a weak story, this is a strong story that would be inspiring even if it weren't Christian-based, but becomes that much more intriguing when rooted in biblical wisdom.

This movie is well-acted, full of excitement, humor, and a number of emotionally stirring moments, when inspiration can be found in the human will to live and move on, and even more so in the solid faith that can sustain even the hardest of blows when a life, even a teenage girl's life, is surrendered to God. My own teen daughters loved this story, as did my wife. It's not only the best Christian movie I've seen, but one of the best sports movies I've seen.
