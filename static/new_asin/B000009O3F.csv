7905612,5,B000009O3F,"This movie is different from normal sex instruction videos by showing how real couples share their full sexual selves with each other. The sex instruction videos and books I've seen typically focus on physical sexual positions to achieve maximum orgasm.
I would say the goal of sex is not the destination of orgasm, but being fully intimately present with each other. This will naturally lead to orgasm with a more emotionally bonding experience. This is the best video on sex I've ever seen. I highly recommend this video.
There is an Eastern emphasis on directing sexual energy. Since it is about sharing yourself with your lover, the men in the film don't typically act like the stereo typical image of what a man should be doing during sex. If your a guy and looking for the ultimate magical tool to give a woman the ultimate sexual experience, without revealing much about yourself, then this movie will be disappointing.
I recommend ""Tantric Love"" by Ma Ananda to go along with this movie. It's a short read and has some good insights. For adding extra methods to the movie I recommend ""Secrets of Sensual Lovemaking"" by Tom Leonardi and ""The Illustrated Guide to Extended Massive Orgasm"" by Steve, Ph. D. Bodansky, Vera, Ph. D. Bodansky.
Since the movie has an Eastern Oriental philosophical emphasis, which pretty much says we are all gods, I recommend  ""Marriage On The Rock"" by Jimmy Evens, to balance it out for those that are Christian.",1034985600,3,1448,4.838709677419355
7905613,4,B000009O3F,"I was skeptical when I first saw this video.  Since then I have bought it, lent it to lots of friends and given it as a gift -- for a wedding shower and an anniversary present.  My partner and I have incorporated a number of the practices outlined here into our relationship -- on a sometimes-when-we-feel-like-it basis. It has definitely increased our gentleness toward each other and feeling connected.  The communication pieces have been extremely helpful.  Some of it is silly (undulating?  A little too out there for us) but much of it is great.  If either of us wakes up in a lousy mood, all we have to do is practice the daily devotion for 5 - 10 minutes in the morning and we both feel peaceful, loving and happy.  Hard to believe but true.  This video could be life changing if you want it to be.  Or it could just be a guide to better sex.",992908800,3,849,4.322784810126582
7905614,5,B000009O3F,"During a recent bridal shower, a friend gave this movie to the soon-to-be bride. We popped it into the VCR and there was total silence as we watched this great hour long video. The video shows you real couples(with not so perfect bodies, like most of us), sharing their most intimate moments on film for the purpose of educating us. Most of us adults make love to our spouses on a regular basis, but do we ever really take the time to truly enjoy and ourselves and our sexuality?.  What I really liked about the video is that it's made up like a documentary and not like a porn movie. There's no close-up shots of your insides, yet it shows many exotic, sensual and arousing positions, with step by step instructions and comments. Most of us would like to think that we're experts in the area of lovemaking, but believe me this video has so much to offer and can be a welcoming eye-opener. It was all wonderful.  This video stresses the inmportance of taking the time to enjoy and spice up your sex life. For people who have fallen into a routine, this video will lift you right out of that and put the excitement and spice back into your life.  After the video, we all sat around and discussed it. We were pleased with it and now I own my own copy.",986947200,44,1249,4.329059829059829
