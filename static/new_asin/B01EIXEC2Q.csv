7736317,5,B01EIXEC2Q,"Great summer indie flick. 3 girls, a trip across the country, and self imposed high expectations revolving around building a boat. And Buddy the dog is the best!",1467072000,,161,4.785714285714286

8758914,1,B01EIXEC2Q,"First of all, the summary said the movie takes place in Maine, that is false.  It actually takes place in Maryland.  All of the characters are caricatures, and act in ways that completely belie common sense or explanation.  Also, there are parts of the plot that make zero sense.  Don't waste your money and time!",1468108800,,313,4.636363636363637
8758915,3,B01EIXEC2Q,"I expected a deeper plot than this very simplistic, marginally acted tale of three young women on a quest to finish building a boat.  I paid for it so I watched it but was not really worth the time spent.  Disappointment.  Also the description of the film is misleading in more ways than one.  I question the STAR rating of films I see on Amazon.  Can people really be that easily impressed?",1467676800,,391,4.375
8758916,4,B01EIXEC2Q,"Fun film written, directed and produced by young women, depicting a sweet story of a month of boatbuilding in a garage. A 'coming of age' film- just the one  you never see-all about the girls  without the male relationship entanglement. These writer/actors are taking the 'helm' with their own careers in the film business, by writing a story about young women,not focused on isn't about sexualizing them, or making them overly neurotic or complicated. Look forward to seeing more from this trio.",1467590400,,496,5.036585365853658
8758917,5,B01EIXEC2Q,"This is a great independent film about three young women trying to follow their dreams.  It is comical, sensitive and entertaining!",1467158400,3,131,5.238095238095238
