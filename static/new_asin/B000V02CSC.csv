8216017,4,B000V02CSC,"This is about her personal secretary/butler who had worked for the Queen then joined Charles and Diana. Upon divorce Diana includes Paul on her list of wants, so he goes with her. A bit heartbreaking at the end when he hears of the accident and explains that he began to gather up things she might need due to the accident because in the end there was nothing that he could provide for her.

Then he is accused of theft and there is a court case which the Queen eventually puts the kibosh upon. Insightful.",1504569600,,506,4.382978723404255

8216021,5,B000V02CSC,"Well done DVD of Paul Burrell's life as Princess Diana's butler.
He seemed to be a confident and one of the trusted friends she had.
So glad to have purchased it.
The von Liebig Art Center in Naples Florida is planning on an exhibit of Princess Diana's dresses in March 2010 and we want as much background on her life as possible.",1260576000,3,330,4.338709677419355
