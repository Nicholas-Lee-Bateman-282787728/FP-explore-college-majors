2469199,5,B000CQLZ74,"Granted, the quality of the prints in this release aren't stellar and in fact, the final frames of a few shows are missing. But they're not all that bad either, and given that we're provided with a whopping 1,260 minutes of entertainment on four disks for <$10, I think some perspective is in order. We're treated to some of the earliest shows--from the short-lived days of the single sponsor--which include Lucky Strike commercials that are actually incorporated into the episodes themselves (earlier than I remember, and I grew up watching this show from infancy). There are also some specials, plus an installment of the Burns & Allen show in which Jack was the guest star. It's a nice mix.
I've already loaned this to one of my professors who also happens to be a fan. In fact, it turns out that several of my buddies in academia are J.B. fans, so this will be passed around a lot. This is REALLY funny stuff and we're lucky that at least some original film stock has survived. I'd love to see an all-out restoration project but until such time, this will more than suffice. I tend to be fussy about quality, but given the age of the source material and the price, I'm very happy that I made this purchase. It might not be everyone's cup of tea (i.e., it's not for liver-lipped, pretentious, Finnish ugly-boy stalker trolls), but if genuine wit without profanity, bathroom humor, and graphic sexuality appeals to you, this is likely to keep you laughing for the better part of 21 hours.
A small caveat: Disk 2 wouldn't track in my PowerBook but was fine in my DVD player, so I didn't bother to try to exchange it.",1208736000,2,1617,4.5793103448275865
2469200,2,B000CQLZ74,"I had great hopes for this collection, but wound up sadly disappointed. Discounting the fact that the shows' video had not been cleaned up in the slightest, with a few episodes being of extremely poor quality, I would've still been content in watching the artistry of a master comedian. But the collection has other problems. I've had two sets now, in which the DVDs lock up at different places. Amazon has been great about replacing them.  But the problem remains. In frustration, I'm simply keeping what I now have, but would recommend any other potential buyers to consider this before making a purchase.",1203033600,15,607,4.893203883495145
2469201,5,B000CQLZ74,"I've been a fan of Jack Benny ever since my mom let me stay up late when I was a little girl to watch reruns on girls night (We always went for Chinese first). Enough about me.
With this collection you get dozens of episodes for a good price. If you are a Jack Benny fan, that's all you need to know. Enjoy!",1202601600,3,307,3.888888888888889
2469202,5,B000CQLZ74,"A look back at early TV. Filled with sight gags and guest stars.
Jack Benny is.......well Jack Benny, a master of timing and delivery.
I will buy more of these!!

2469203,5,B000CQLZ74,"This is the most complete Jack Benny Show set on Amazon, and by far the best value. Having enjoyed this set so much, I searched Amazon for other available episodes.  To my surprise, I could only find one episode that I did not already have on this set--and I had to search really hard for that one.

I haven't laughed so much in ever-so-long!  This has got to be good for your health!  Even during those times when the actual routines a little too silly, you know the actors are having a good time, you can't help but laugh.  Just a few dollars for hours of laughter.  I think this was my best investment of 2007.

Picture quality is typically very good, considering the technology which has preserved them for us today.  Only a couple of episodes have apparently come from films that left images looking a bit fuzzy or washed out.  The worst quality film image is in the ""Honeymooners Episode,"" but that doesn't stop it from being one of the most enjoyable episodes on the set (and my personal favorite).  I'm oh-so-glad they included it in spite of the inferior film quality. It's a hoot, with Dennis Day and Audrey Meadows giving spot-on performances.

I recommend a family game of watching to see who can be the first to detect Mr. Benny having trouble surpressing a smile.  (When teamed with Bob Hope, he pretty much gives up fighting this losing battle.)  There are two versions of Jack's touching New Year's Eve story which could spark an annual friends-and-family viewing tradition.

A couple additional details which might be useful:

The DVD's are all single-sided--no need to worry about double-sided DVD's.  This is my third DVD set from Mill Creek Entertainment.  In spite of bargain-basement prices, they are always of very respectable quality.

Only 34 of the 40 shows are actually Jack Benny shows or specials.  The other six are other shows or films featuring Jack Benny.  These are an additional treat, giving a taste of others shows of the era, including George Burns and Gracie Allen, the Bing Crosby GE Show, and General Electric Theater (hosted by Ronald Reagan).",1201996800,9,2085,4.738888888888889
2469204,5,B000CQLZ74,"An excellent collection. Although some of the episodes are available elsewhere, about half aren't, including some real rarities. I hadn't seen the HONEYMOONERS sketch before, with both Jack and Dennis Day doing credible impressions of Ralph and Ed. Besides Jack's own shows, there are other appearances like 2 TV plays he starred in, an TV special TELEPARADE OF STARS and a BING CROSBY SHOW he guested on. At it's very reasonable price, it is worth getting for the more unusual items, even if you have the more common ones. For the newcomer, this is the perfect introduction to Jack, with classics like HOW JACK MET MARY and the CHRISTMAS SHOPPING show, which has a wonderful performance from Mel Blanc.
Having said this of course, what we really need for all 50's U.S. comedy classics like Jack, BURNS AND ALLEN, BOB CUMMINGS and BILKO are complete season by season sets like has been done so well with I LOVE LUCY...and how about a complete collection of Jack's later hour specials, like the George Burns one brought out recently? In the meantime, this is probably the best collection to be going on with.",1195862400,74,1107,4.801047120418848
2469205,5,B000CQLZ74,"MILL CREEK box sets offer good-to-average-quality audio and video transfers of public domain material at a most reasonable price.

The Jack Benny Program aired on radio from 1932 to '55. Many of that show's scripts were recycled for television, beginning in 1950. Benny's CBS-TV series ran until 1965. The core cast (on radio and TV) changed little over the decades: Dennis Day replaced tenor Kenny Baker early on; Bob Crosby (Bing's younger brother) took over for bandleader Phil Harris in 1952.

At one time or another, almost every Hollywood, radio and TV star guested on Jack's show. This four DVD set offers only a fraction of Benny's 258 television episodes, yet the viewer is provided an excellent illustration of his popularity within the ""Showbiz"" community.

An unrelated highlight of this collection is a 1943 documentary about Hollywood's war efforts. Among the 58 cameo appearances here are: Benny, W.C. Fields, Louis Armstrong, Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, Bob Hope, Alfred Hitchcock, Frank Sinatra, Orson Welles, Irving Berlin, James Cagney, Bing Crosby, Clark Gable, Marlene Dietrich and Walt Disney.

2469206,5,B000CQLZ74,"When I ordered this, I was expecting excerpts from Jack Benny programs.  Instead, to my surprised delight, there are entire programs, most complete with Lucky Strike cigarette commercials.  LSMFT.  Young people don't know what those letters stand for (thank goodness), but if you are old enough to be a Benny fan, the letters are indelible in your brain.

There are some very funny bits and the great characters associated with Benny:  Rochester, Mary Livingston, Don Wilson, Mr. Kietzel, Mel Blanc, the race track tout, etc. etc.  And then there are the guests, Fred Allen, Eddie Cantor, Johnny Ray singing ""Cry,"" Marilyn Monroe, Vincent Price, Liberace, Humphrey Bogart--a veritable who's who of show business stars in the 1950s.

The programs hold up very well.  They are still funny.  They are still warm and wonderful.",1194739200,95,823,5.12781954887218
2469207,1,B000CQLZ74,"I haven't watched this DVD, but the company who produced this DVD of public domain episodes (as all Benny DVDs only contain the public domain episodes) needs to do their homework.

2469218,5,B000CQLZ74,"I've watched almost half of these episodes so far and really enjoy them. I was not alive when these episodes originally aired, but I heard his radio show on one of the vintage radio stations I stream which led me to learn about Jack Benny's TV work. I watched many episodes on Youtube before deciding to find a set. For the price, it's a great deal. Yes, it's true that the quality is inconsistent. The majority are good/watchable but a few episodes are poor. Considering the age of these episodes though, one can't expect HD grain free quality. Maybe it's like watching TV in the era they originally aired? I'm not bothered since I've watched black and white films since I was a kid. Some episodes I find funnier than others, but all are pleasant many featuring amazing guest stars. So far one of my favorite episodes is the jam session that includes Kirk Douglas and Fred MacMurray!

It feels like Benny stumbles over his lines, at times groping for the words.  He always could get a laugh out of me, though, just by his posturing and facial expressions.  But it's hard for me to actually sit down and watch an entire episode, let alone two.  I have no desire to open this set again or watch any more of the discs----I couldn't even finish the one.  Sorry Jack...... What's amusing to me, however, having grown up in the '50's where we little girls in white gloves would ""smoke"" the candy cigarettes found in our Easter baskets, are the ads for Lucky Strike cigarettes.  Careful mention and promotion is given to the show's sponsors by Jack himself at times.  This WAS the era, after all, and it's interesting to take a trip down memory lane. It would seem very odd, even strange, to today's generation.",1446595200,,958,4.497109826589595

I love seeing Mel Blanc here and there. A funny skit where Jack pretends to be Jackie Gleason on the Honeymooners.
I love Rochester. And in a semi-bonus flick it has Charles Bronson and Zsa-Zsa Gabor in it.
I also read (and reviewed) a biography about him 'Sunday Nights At Seven' - mostly written by his (adopted daughter Joan).
In some ways - he was a good guy. - Ironically he was a Hypochondriac - who developed pancreatic cancer - from the cigarettes

2469329,5,B000CQLZ74,"As a fan of Jack Benny, I have long sought to expand my episode collection, a deceptively complicated endeavor. Often, the same episodes will be released repeatedly on different disks. Sometimes a disk will turn up with all new material, sometimes with one or two episodes you can't get anywhere else. On other occasions, discs composed entirely of episodes you can get elsewhere for a better deal will appear. These disks frequently have no available episode guide, so telling these apart can often be hazardous. Even more confusing are customer reviews meant for one collection that have somehow ended up under another. I, the Jack Benny Trailblazer, through an extended period of careful research, mostly through purchasing the disk on a hunch and seeing what I got, am here to simplify matters.  Below are each Jack Benny collection which I find most advisable to purchase found here on Amazon (although you may want an episode guide, I recommend the one on Wikipedia.org):

Best of Jack Benny (39 Episodes)
The Jack Benny Program: The Lost Episodes (18 episodes)
Jack Benny - Comedy Pack (7 episodes)
The Best of Jack Benny (8 episodes)
The Best of the Jack Benny Show, Vol. 1 and 2 (17 episodes)
Jack At the Races Ed Sullivan/Genieve Show DVD (2 episodes) (Volume 3 of The Jack Benny Collection)

This 39 episode set produced by Mill Creek, purveyors of many great box sets of hard to find, albeit public domain, products, is an ideal starting place for any Jack Benny collection. The collection presents a number of exclusive episodes, including the single oldest available episode and a Road to... themed episode complete with Bob Hope. Also prevalent are otherwise rare television episodes and specials in which Jack figures prominently, including episodes of Burns & Allen and General Electric Theater. As the biggest set of Benny episodes out there, purchasing this one first crosses off many of the other lesser collections in your own hunt for new shows.

You will find reviews like this one for each of the collections listed above.  May it be a useful tool to navigating the murky waters of Jack Benny DVD's. Also, be sure to watch for Jack Benny on Antenna TV.

Good Hunting!

We enjoy the gentle humor and find it truly funny in a way much of the modern, in-your-face comedy completely lacks.

2469337,2,B000CQLZ74,"I picked up this set at a local discount store and, considering that the shows are public domain, wasn't expecting the best.

Yes, the shows are great and you get fascinating glimpses of a host of guest stars.  However, the quality of the transfers is dreadful and almost unwatchable.

These shows have been released many times over the years by companies specializing in public domain material and have circulated among collectors on video.  The transfers were created from 16mm collector prints back in the 1980s.

This dvd set appears to have been mastered from VHS tapes and other sources a few generations away from those 1980s transfers - I have some 1980s video cassettes with some of these shows, like the Bogart program, and they actually look better than the transfers in this dvd set.  A few, with excessive digital noise, appear to be sourced from low resolution movie files that users have uploaded to archive.org or other websites.

I'd only recommend this for a die-hard fan of Jack that's using an older-style, small NTSC tv set to watch them.  They're almost unbearable to watch on a modern flat screen tv of any decent size.

Really a shame - the source prints for these shows are scattered to the four winds among various private collections and no doubt some have succumbed to age and vinegar syndrome and may no longer exist.  Until someone starts rounding up the 16mm prints and doing new transfers, this is what we're stuck with.",1392940800,2,1452,4.795180722891566

2469355,5,B000CQLZ74,"The quality of the video for the most part is very good, especially considering the recording technology a half century ago. The audio is also very good. The Jack Benny gentle humor is enjoyable and even refreshing compared to the gross, dimwitted so-called comedy that dominates contemporary TV. The cigarette embedded in some of the episodes provide an interesting contrast with today's standards.",1385078400,2,399,5.349206349206349

2469359,3,B000CQLZ74,"Thought I write this quick review and must mention that I have been watching Jack Benny on television around 2AM Eastern Time.  Because I do enjoy watching Jack Benny and did not want to stay up so late to watch I decided to buy it.  Once I received the DVD's I only watched the 1st one.  So far the recording of the show looks like one of those earlier bad black and white shows where you seen lint and stuff of the recording tape.  Also, what I found annoying was the Lucky Strike Commercials.  They don't show that at night on TV so I'm not sure if I have the right DVD collection.  Jack Benny definitely delivers and you won't be disappointed but getting use to the quality of the recording and those old Lucky Strike commercials do get annoying.  Perhaps they get better as I keep going from DVD to DVD?

2469360,4,B000CQLZ74,"It is amazing to watch these episodes of Jack Benny, with their commercials intact.  The humor is timeless, and well worth the cost of the dvd.

The downside is that the quality of the episodes is not very good.  Can watch some of the same episodes on television now with restored picture quality, only minus the in-episode commercial.  Some episodes the trade off is well worth it, other episodes it is not.

Also worth noting that one episode that stated that it was in color (within the program) was in black and white.  Of course in a different, older episode, Jack informed the audience that if they were watching in color, then they had too much to drink the night before as they were only being broadcast in black and white.",1380931200,,731,4.541984732824427
2469361,5,B000CQLZ74,"If you're a baby boomer who grew up watching Jack Benny's television show, you'll love this collection. It includes guest stars who were the greats of the era--Humphrey Bogart, Marilyn Monroe, Liberace, Gizelle Mackenzie, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, Vincent Price, Jimmy Stewart, George Burns and Gracie Allen, Bing and Bob Crosby, and Bob Hope to name a few. Watch for a vaudevillian dance with Jack Benny, George Burns, and Bing Crosby--it's a classic, and not to be missed. And if you watch the episode in which Jack plays his violin with Liberace, you'll get a glimpse of what a great violinist he actually was. This is my favorite Jack Benny DVD, and I'm a die hard fan. If you're new to Jack's comedy, you'll see that he set the bar for comedians to come. Some bits could have come straight from David Letterman's show.

2469366,3,B000CQLZ74,"This collection contains many fine programs from Jack Benny's TV career, both his own shows and guest appearances on others. But it's hard to imagine how the presentation could be any worse. The DVD case offers no description of its contents beyond ""39 Episodes"", a roster of some of the guest-star names, and ""Includes Exclusive Documentary Featurette"". It doesn't even say how many discs there are (four). The episodes are presented in random order, with no indication of when they were originally broadcast. The quality is extremely variable. Some episodes (too few) are quite good, many are merely acceptable, and some (too many) are sub-bootleg-video atrocious. A 1965 special, ""The Jack Benny Hour"", was broadcast in color but is presented here in washed-out black-and-white with murky sound. As for that ""Exclusive Documentary Featurette"", it's a 21-minute lecture by some unidentified person sitting in a video control booth (they didn't even spring for a set!) yakking about Jack's life and career, interspersed with a handful of scenes from the shows. (Who IS this guy, and why do I care what he has to say?)

As I said at the top, Jack Benny (along with Don Wilson and Mary Livingstone and Dennis Day and Mel Blanc and Frank Nelson and various guest stars) saves the show, but just barely, and with no help whatsoever from this organization calling itself Mill Creek Entertainment. As I type this, the price on Amazon is $6.49, and it's worth it.

The highlights of the shows are Benny's interactions with the stars of the age, particularly with George Burns, Bing Crosby, and Bob Hope.

The comedy is first rate.  It seems so innocent, especially with the all the Lucky Strike cigarette ads--which are almost worth the price of admission alone.  It's so obvious why Johnny Carson loved Jack Benny so much.",1369612800,4,529,4.706521739130435
2469384,5,B000CQLZ74,"Many collections have been released of, mainly, the long running Jack Benny CBS Television Show.  That is because most, if not
all of his early television appearances have fallen into the Public Domain.  Many different collections, in fact, are available to the collector through Amazon.com.  But this collection of DVD's put out by the always quality conscious Mill Creek Company is an exceptional value for what it contains and is head and shoulders above the quality and contents of many other collections of the
late Jack Benny's delightful comedy work.  Jack Benny was one of America's indisputably best loved TV personalities.
He really was a stage and radio comedian who brought his radio audience to television, along with his long established radio cast when the technology of television left network radio in the dust by the early 1950's.  And while the content of his television shows was very similar to what he had been doing for twenty years before, the technology of television was in its infancy.  This is a real
problem for all collections of television, dating to television's beginnings, because the quality of kinescope film recordings of the early live shows comes nowhere close to modern standards.  In the early Benny shows, the sharpness of the early recordings is only fair, but Mill Creek reproduces the rare early episodes better than most releasing companies.  The later filmed episodes in the collection, from the later 1950's, look much better.  But the exceptional aspect of The Best of Jack Benny Collection is the
tremendous amount of rare material which has been collected from Jack's guest appearances on some of the ""anthology"" type
television programs of the time.  We even get a glimpse back to the World War Two Era through a remarkable March of Time
Newsreel, included portraying how Hollywood supported the war effort.  The collection is just a wonderful archive of not only
some of Jack Benny's funniest performances, but its a great collection of other notable celebrities of the time, and Jack could
attract the very best of Hollywood's stars personalities to his programs.  Just to mention a few of those guest appearances, the
viewer gets to see a skit with Humphrey Bogart, another with Marilyn Monroe, and even one with Benny's friendly rival, the
radio wit Fred Allen.  Four full DVD's comprise the Best of Jack Benny Collection with about a dozen shows on each DVD.

He was a generous comic who shared the laughs around. He didn't hog the one-liners. When Rochester's relation offers to clean Jack's violin, Rochester asks if he is sure he won't break it. He assures him he won't and Rochester says, ""I better clean it myself."" Jack's reactions and double takes are priceless. It would be great to have a box-set of all 250 of the Jack Benny Programs, but this set of more than 30 episodes will give you all the laughs you can handle.

2469429,4,B000CQLZ74,"Let's get the technical stuff out of the way first. The staff at Millcreek Entertainment has done the best it could to clean up the 40 shows included on THE BEST OF JACK BENNY.  But I'll warn you in advance! Some of the shows are from kinescopes or 16MM films that were duplicated poorly. So in certain situations...you'll have to adjust your eyes to shows out of focus...or tolerate audio with noticeable splice jumps. Consider the fact that practically ALL of these shows are more than 70 years old!

Now let's discuss ""America's Favorite Miser"", Jack Benny.  His real name was Benny Kubelsky. The name change to Jack Benny occurred during his vaudeville appearances...which occasionally included music from his violin. [Jack was an excellent musician, but you rarely got to hear him seriously perform. The violin was just another prop used for humor]. From vaudeville and various stage appearances, Jack entered radio in the early 30s continuing into the 1950s. Naturally, the next step was television.  In fact, Jack performed on the air and on the tube simultaneously.  But his television appearances varied from weekly and alternate Sundays to  an occasional 1-hour special. An example of the latter is the show called: ""The Jack Benny Hour"" featuring The Beach Boys and Walt Disney.

In many cases, Jack's radio cast (including Don Wilson, Dennis Day, Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson and Mel Blanc) followed him into television.  So some of the sketches were identical to those previously done on THE JACK BENNY (RADIO) SHOW.

What's fun about this 4-CD set is that there's a dash of history tossed in every so often.  References are made to Presidents Truman and Eisenhower, the Super Bowl, and Easter Seals. Naturally...most of these shows have guest stars who are no longer with us. Among them: Bob Hope, Fred Allen, Irene Dunn, Ernie Kovacs, and Jack's personal friend, George Burns.  There are guest appearances on The Bing Crosby Show and Burns & (Gracie) Allen. Also fascinating are the televised versions of Jack's radio dramas through the courtesy of the General Electric Theatre. But in my opinion, Jack's greatest strength is still with his radio cast.  While Mary Livingston (his wife in real life) was nervous about appearing in front of a television camera, ""How Jack Found Mary"" is one of the funniest shows in this 40 show set.

Here's something very important. Many of the shows in this collection contain the original commercials for Lucky Strike Cigarettes (LSMFT), General Motors and State Farm Insurance. Jack's writers knew how to cleverly work his sponsors into the middle commercial break.  And these are STILL FUNNY to watch! [Can you imagine Danny Kaye or Rochester singing with The Sportsmen Quartet]?

To sum it all up, if you grew up with Jack's radio show, many of these shows will amuse you.  If you're a total stranger to Jack's sense of humor and comedic timing...you're in for a treat!",1346976000,3,2921,4.979423868312757

As the time goes, this was a relatively liberal portrayal of African American. For example, black and white entertainers are shown singing together. These appear to be copied from reprints rather than master tapes, so the quality is so-so. However, these MAY be the best remaining. I was able to see and hear everything clearly.

The guest stars on Jacks show along with the old sponsors adds takes me back to when TV was really entertainment.  Not shocking, immoral, and desensitizing.

Lucky Strike commercials not only have small commercial breaks, but in many shows,commercials have been worked into the skits performed in the shows.  This aside, it is still worth buying.  Jack Benny, Rochester and the host of visiting stars are a wonderful trip back in time.  The film quality does vary, but is still viewable.

The biggest thing I noticed is that they cut out a General Electric Theater episode ""The Face is Familiar"" from the 4th disc.  The above reviewer (Annie Van Auken)may have reviewed the Best of Jack Benny 4 disc set because she is still showing the 2nd General Electric Theater show which was removed to make room for the ""Documentary"".  I have the other 4 disc set already, and was looking forward to upgrading with this documentary set.  Now I'll either have to keep both, or lose the 2nd General Electric Theater episode.

2469458,4,B000CQLZ74,"The packaging suggests that you get 39 episodes of ""The Jack Benny Program"".

Actually, you get just 32. You also get a poor-quality kinescope of a special Jack did for NBC in 1965, shortly after his weekly series ended, some other shows Jack made guest appearances on, and some shorts where Jack appears only fleetingly.

The slightly-deceptive labeling and the poor-quality kine of Jack's 1965 special are the only reasons I am not giving this collection a five-star rating.

But other than that, this is something fans of Jack Benny and classic television comedy should own. The 32 ""Jack Benny Program"" episodes in this set are for the most part kinescopes of live shows (or later, videotaped shows) that weren't part of the rerun package of filmed episodes that appeared on CBS-TV's daytime schedule in the 1964/65 season and subsequently syndicated to local stations.

One big ""plus"" is that most of these 32 shows have the original commercials (mainly for Lucky Strike cigarettes, but there's one 1963 show sponsored by Benny's longtime radio sponsor Jell-O, and some Eastern Airlines spots in his 1965 NBC special). Seeing the Lucky Strike spots show how huge cigarette manufacturers were as TV sponsors until such advertising was outlawed in early 1971 (but resist any temptation to go to your local convenience store and ask for a carton of Luckies!).

Benny, on radio, was among the first to ""blend"" the ""middle"" commercial into the show's entertainment content. There are a number of examples of that in quite a few of these episodes.

The ""Hawaii Trip"" episode on disc 1 is historically significant: I believe it's the only time Marilyn Monroe ever made a guest appearance on a TV comedy or dramatic program.

(I have also heard an ""urban legend"" that Jack came close in 1960 to signing Clark Gable for a guest shot, but Gable fell ill and passed away before he could film his episode)

This is an inexpensively-priced way to sample one of the funniest TV comedy shows of all time, a series whose humor has stood the test of time.",1273881600,4,2042,4.847701149425287
2469459,5,B000CQLZ74,"This should be called The Best of Jack Benny and More!  There is so much more, from the now long-banned cigarette commercials, to GE Theatre (you've got to see these, hosted by none other than Ronald Reagan), the Easter Seal Teleparade of Stars, and the Bing Crosby GE Show.  This set is four DVD discs full of early television history; television in its infancy.  Jack's show was basically an early variety show, featuring many stars of the silver screen, and musicians of the day, such as Fred Allen, Eddie Cantor, Bob Hope, Humphrey Bogart, George Burns & Gracie Allen, Johnnie Ray, Danny Thomas, Irene Dunne, Vincent Price, Liberace, Jimmy Stewart, Audrey Meadows, Ernie Kovacs, the Beach Boys, Dick Contino, and so, so, so many more!  We simply do not have programming like this on television today, and that is a shame.

The Jack Benny Program aired on the CBS Television Network in the 1950s and into the 1960s.  In the early days of television programming, many programs, while deemed ""regular"" programs, did not air weekly.  Jack Benny's show alternated with Ann Sothern in ""Private Secretary"" for some time in the early years.  I have also purchased what I could of that series through Amazon, and will write a review of that (preview of my review:  BUY IT!  IT'S SO FUNNY!)

Quality of some of the programs sometimes suffers from fifty-to-nearly-sixty year old technology; they did not have videotape back then.  That, however, is all very forgiveable; for what this set lacks in technical aplomb is undeniably more than superceded by the priceless content.

I am not even through with the first disc yet, but just had to put in a plug for this. There are wonderful moments in these shows, with sight gags on a par with anything Mr. Benny accomplished on the radio. I especially (so far) have enjoyed the episode with Bob Hope as guest star. This episode has an extra delightful surprise at the end that goes to show they don't make 'em like this anymore! It is hard for Jack to keep a straight face when joined with Hope, and the sheer joy of watching these two classic masters interact is enough for this fan to urge others: order it now, you will be glad you did.",1267142400,3,896,4.184971098265896
2469462,4,B000CQLZ74,"Here is a compilation of shows either starring or featuring Jack Benny, covering many years, 1940s to 1960s.
This package cannot boast of exceptional audio-video quality, but the price for content is excellent.
Benny's regular TV series was interesting - a combination of variety show and sitcom. Jack would casually walk to centerstage and sound very relaxed and extemporaneous. Usually, he'd get interrupted by Don Wilson, who had to discuss some facet of production or express his discontent with Benny's quirks.
Benny's counterpart in the ""sketch"" section was the inimitable Rochester Van Jones, who could switch from straight man to second banana in a heartbeat. Of course, we have some bits with tired ethnic references, so typical of the period. Rochester plays Jack's Butler, though his role seems nebulous, and this might be found very curious by the younger students of Television history.
Further stereotypes are explored with women's performances, though if one watches with understanding of this pre-femimist time, he/she can enjoy a good deal of intelligent dialogue, especially with the TV debuts of Marilyn Monroe and Sheree North!. (The funniest episode involves the robbery of Jack's Maxwell. The Beverly Hills Law Enforcement community is cleverly sent up in a long sketch. Another excellent entry has Mr. and Mrs. Jimmy Stewart trying to avoid Jack Benny at a concert. Another fun one involves a ""Jam Session"" with pals like Fred MacMurray and Kirk Douglas, playing saxophone and banjo).
There's some stale stuff, too - a 1965 Special with the Beach Boys doing a bad version of ""California Girls"", then lines with Bob Hope and JB, both dressed as ""surfer boys"", or whatever.
""Well!"". ""Now cut that out!"" ""Y'see..."". Hey, Jack was okay.

2469467,4,B000CQLZ74,"There is less minutes of advertising in each episode than most current ""CBS"" shows. Like several other variety shows, there is usually about 4 minutes of actual commercials and 1 minute of ""sponsor plugs"", which are plugs for the sponsor inserted into the comedy.

As for the comedy itself, it's wonderful. Jack Benny was warm and funny, and never afraid to mock himself. He was such a good actor that some people really believed he was as stingy as his character. In real life Jack was quite generous. While some of the jokes need some context, many of them still work today.

The guests are great too. This show is unusual in that it's sorta of a ""variety-sitcom"" hybrid, combining episode-long sketckes with other segments.

The only real problem with the DVD is the rather worn kinescope prints, which could use with some cleaning up.",1242172800,,838,4.76551724137931

2469482,3,B000CQLZ74,"The first set of discs arrived and all but one was damaged due to poor handling on the part of the manufacturer. (No fault placed on Amazon.)
Amazon, as usual, was quick to replace the faulty discs. If you purchase this collection you should check each disc for deep surface scratched as soon as they arrive.
The programs were fun to watch on my PC or after I transferred them to my Ipod but forget about viewing most of these shows on a regular TV. The compression used on most of these programs is so great that the images are blurred and pixilated. (Yes, I understand what the original source material is... filmed Tube... but what I'm talking about here is extreme digital compression.) I have no idea what the original source material looks like but on episodes like ""The Honeymooners"" the pixels, at times, were the size of postage stamps on a regular TV... the original source HAD to be better than this. I was left wondering if the producer of this collection found some of these programs on the internet as small streaming Quicktime movies and then converted them to Standard TV format, because THAT's how bad the quality is but why it looks decent on my ipod.
But, despite the poor ""bootleg-like"" quality, these programs were fun to watch, and even just listen to, on the PC or Ipod and worth the low price.
Just don't expect a collection of clean transfers.",1225497600,13,1368,4.587755102040816
2469483,5,B000CQLZ74,"Jack Benny is an original.  No one could milk a laugh like him.  Though he was big on radio, it was television that allowed viewers to see him cross his arms, look off to the side, and extend the laughter to a sight gag or a wisecrack made by his repertory company -- Rochester, Dennis Day, Don Wilson, and Mary Livingston.  It's fun to see these old TV shows, even though the quality isn't up to DVD standards.  No matter.  The content is just great, showcasing Benny's cheapskate persona beautifully.",1223164800,2,502,4.533333333333333

2469485,3,B000CQLZ74,"I was/am a fan of Jack Benny. But I didn't find these shows as compelling as I anticipated.  Humor back then was much more casual than today; it was interesting to see the various guest stars, but the skits lack the boffo laughs I was expecting. It's a pleasant trip down memory lane, but not much more than that...I smiled and chuckled occasionally, but don't expect humor on the scale of ""Cheers"", ""Will & Grace"", etc.",1214870400,,420,4.526315789473684
2469486,5,B000CQLZ74,"There were funnier shows in the 1950's, ""Abbott and Costello,"" ""I Love Lucy"" (from 1952-1955), ""Milton Berle,"" ""Honeymooners"" and ""I Married Joan,"" but these only lasted, or were funny, for two or three years, ""The Jack Benny Show"" lasted amazingly from 1950 till 1965. From this collection, a good selection from many of these years, it is clear that the Jack Benny show was consistently funny for all those years.

This is the best collection on the market. Even the ones that are no longer very funny (about 1/4 of the episodes) are fascinating to watch for what they tell us about the times.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the show today is the relationship between Eddie Anderson (Rochester) and Jack Benny. There is a genuine affection between the two performers that made for a silent but clear anti-racist message for the time.

One should be warned that there are a lot of Luck Strike commercials included (about 20). They are incredibly effective and even today can have you wanting to run out and buy a pack for the ""great taste.""

Hopefully, someone will put out a complete year by year collection some day. Until then, this collection is the best we have.",1210550400,5,1177,4.754901960784314
2469487,5,B000CQLZ74,"This is the most entertainment I have gotten for under ten dollars in a long time - four discs of complete episodes of The Jack Benny Program and various other shows in which Jack appeared, including that of George Burns and Gracie Allen. Just about every star of the 50's and 60's shows up on Jack's show, and the show is presented complete with commercials in most cases. This is most interesting since Lucky Strike cigarettes sponsored Benny's show for much of its tenure. How ironic to see Humphrey Bogart plugging cigarettes during an episode in which he appears just a few years before the same product takes his life.

Especially fun are the guest appearances by Mel Blanc and Bob Hope - Benny just can't resist breaking up during their routines. Then there is an episode entitled ""Jam Session"" in which a number of stars including Kirk Douglas, Fred MacMurray, Dan Dailey, and Dick Powell join Jack in his living room for an impromptu musical session. The group, in need of refreshment, find a number of vending machines placed throughout the room to dispense cold apples and soft drinks at a price, of course. They've obviously been to Jack's house before.

There is a running gag through the shows about the failure of Jacks's 1940's film ""The Horn Blows at Midnight"". I don't know if it failed in the 40's, but if you ever get a chance to catch it on TV, give it a try - it really is pretty good.

As for the controversy over Rochester, I'd say his role in TV was groundbreaking. Benny treats Rochester more as a member of the family than a servant, and several times Rochester's ingenuity and wisdom save Benny from himself. More importantly, Rochester's ingenuity saves himself from Benny's cheapskate ways more than once, and when that's not possible at least Rochester gets off a wisecrack at Benny's expense. It's not at all the painful portrayal of racial stereotypes you see in some of the 1940's Charlie Chan films.

Some people have criticized the video quality of this pack. The quality is definitely ""unrestored"", but I would put it on par with the best quality that you find in some of those public domain 50 movie packs. Sure there are some scratches in the video here and there, but the audio is quite clear. Highly recommended.",1209772800,30,2253,4.681818181818182
