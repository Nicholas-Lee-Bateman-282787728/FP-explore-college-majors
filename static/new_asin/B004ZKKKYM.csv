8449993,5,B004ZKKKYM,"Bombay Bellywood is a beautiful tapestry of Indian, Middle Eastern and Tribal dance styles.  The Classical dancing was a feast to the eyes and the fusion of Indian and Middle Eastern instruments was well coordinated.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in dance and music.",1361318400,,285,5.042553191489362
8449994,5,B004ZKKKYM,It was nice seeing the first show without Jillina.  They needed to shake thing up a bit.  And the first time a male dancer is in the group.  I would have preferred a guy that was better at bellydancing instead of a guy that could do freakish things with his arms and hands.  It was entertaining to watch though.  I love Meera.  And I love that the show had more variety of the types of bellydance.  There are some wonderful choreographies on here.  My favorite is when the group is lined up together and do the arm movements as if they are one being.  The timing is phenominal!,1320278400,4,577,4.268518518518518
