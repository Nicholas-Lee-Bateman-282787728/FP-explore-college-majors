7905005,5,B000006QQM,"Great film of an engineering feat, building a treadway bridge across the Reine River under direct fire from small arms, 88's, and even German jets (the 262's).  It's amazing to see a World War II military operation from start to finish.",1081987200,,236,4.7560975609756095
7905006,5,B000006QQM,"At first I thought this was going to be another rehash of the caputre of the Ludendorf bridge at Remagen.  However, the bridge is captured within the first ten minutes or so of the video.  The rest is what happened  *after* the capture.
It chronicles the Engineers' efforts to build  pontoon bridges before the Ludendorf bridge collapses.  This was no easy  accomplishment because the bridge needed to be built under enemy fire from  artillery, air raids, siege mortars, underwater demolition teams, and more!",921369600,4,509,5.0602409638554215
