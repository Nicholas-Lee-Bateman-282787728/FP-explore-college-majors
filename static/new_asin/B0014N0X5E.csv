3133761,5,B0014N0X5E,More than friends is a great movie. I received mines today and I love it. About to watch it again. Milon V. Parker is a great writer and producer. Keep up the awesome work. This is a must see. Buy the DVD and support her. Love her movies.,1482192000,5,238,3.9791666666666665
3133762,5,B0014N0X5E,"I loved this movie!* Things like this really happen in real life this movie made me laugh, cry, and reminisce altogether.... definitely a MUST SEE!*",1482019200,,148,4.96
3133763,5,B0014N0X5E,Great movie! Definitely gets 5 stars from me! Def support the MVP movement!,1481932800,,75,4.846153846153846
3133764,5,B0014N0X5E,It was fun to watch this video of beautiful hummingbirds with a close-up view!  Good information about hummingbirds.  Made in Minnesota!!,1354752000,,137,5.476190476190476
3133765,4,B0014N0X5E,"This is a really good film for those fascinated by hummingbirds.  This film has some really special footage ... the best footage is some really excellent nest-making footage, a rival female hummingbird that trespasses and pesters the mother, the dedicated mother sitting on eggs and looking around defensively, and later feeding a nestling. The producers do a good job of showing how the same hummingbird (most likely the same) nested three years in the same tree, and the sad fact that only one of six eggs hatched due to storms and predators.  The only irritating feature is that the frame and view-finder of a camera is superimposed on screen the entire time.  The music is quite good.  Please note I am not related to the producers in any way, unlike several five-star reviewers with the same surname or state residency as the producers!",1252886400,3,841,4.86013986013986
3133766,5,B0014N0X5E,"Well done! This movie is both entertaining and educational. My two year old enjoys watching this movie along with the rest of us! Beautiful music.

This movie includes footage of hummingbirds building their nest, babies in the nest, baby feedings, fight scenes between hummingbirds, a hummingbird perched in a tree, hummingbirds at feeders, size & weight reference, trivia, and so much more. Very enjoyable.

I highly recommend this DVD.",1204675200,4,437,5.318840579710145
3133767,5,B0014N0X5E,"I purchased this DVD because of my love of hummingbirds.  The video taken for this was absolutely breathtaking!  It was so very interesting to watch, I learned so much.  Also, the music written for this was so beautiful and relaxing to listen to.
It was a great purchase!
I recommend this for all ages who love birds and great music!

3133768,5,B0014N0X5E,I have purchased several copies as gifts. I have found that grade school children love it as much as bird lovers! Really rare footage of parents and babies in the nest. Tired of those 1 second sightings of your hummers flitting by... this is the video for you. Not just the usual at-the-feeder shots. Perfect for any nature lover!,1204502400,6,330,4.610169491525424
3133769,5,B0014N0X5E,"We purchased Wind Dancers because we love hummingbirds.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and have told others about it.  We purchased copies for our parents and for others as Christmas gifts.  They all told us how much they enjoyed it as well.  My mother especially loved it, since she has been a hummingbird watcher for many years.  Thanks for a great production.  It wins the Oscar for ""Best Picture"" in our movie reviews.

3133770,3,B0014N0X5E,I don't know about this movie! However it is good to love and receive it too.,1510963200,,77,3.875
3133771,2,B0014N0X5E,"Wouldve been better if the movie had better actors and actresses. The acting in here was horrible it was actually cringey. The concept of this movie was good, but wouldve been better with a more high end movie.",1509408000,,210,4.552631578947368
3133772,5,B0014N0X5E,A great low-budget film. Great premise!!! My only issue was the prenatalism that seems to pervade the conflict.,1507852800,,111,5.222222222222222
3133773,5,B0014N0X5E,"The movie started off on the slow side...really slow at times...so slow that I even turned it off and began watching a new different movie.  Well, the next day curiosity was getting the best of me, so I couldn't stand not knowing how things were going to end up with the two main characters!!  Lol.  So, my already being such a huge TV an movie buff as it is, I decided to finish the movie regardless.  I was SO happy that I finished this movie, because I began watching it to begin with because of having my gay best friend of over twenty some years now on my mind, and missing him in my life right now because he's going through some things...and once again choosing to shut me out !!  I hate it, I miss him, and I just feel as if my life isn't complete without him in it.  All of my best friends...my true friends...are all gay except for a select very few.  SO, if you are in the mood for a good feeling movie...then watch this!!  If you just want something to watch with your gay BFF's or friends or loved ones...then watch this!!  All in all, I am super happy that I watched this movie and followed through!  It has good music, and I downloaded it also by the way, and it gives the song listings in the credits at the end of the movie...for those music lovers...also like myself...that may watch an wonder hmm can I get these songs!!  Lol.  I hope whomever watches this...enjoys it as much as I did!!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/More-Than-Friends/dp/B01MRZ63MF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">More Than Friends</a>&nbsp;For those of you ""Milon V.

3133776,1,B0014N0X5E,This movie was predictable and poorly acted. Their friendship was flawed if it came to pass this way. I kept watching because I couldn't believe how bad it was. And then it got worse.,1500422400,2,183,4.411764705882353

3133781,5,B0014N0X5E,"I didn't think I would like the movie in the beginning because it appeared to be a little off beat. The acting could use some improvement but overall I gave this film 5 stars because it kept my attention. I even went to search for more films with Milon Parker's name attached to it. ""The lies we tell and the secrets we keep"" was the first film I watched which led me to this. It felt good to watch something that I could personally identify with. Kudos to Milon and I look forward to seeing more from her.",1498003200,4,506,4.173469387755102
3133782,4,B0014N0X5E,Cool movie. I would watch again..! I need the soundtrack especially the song in the scene when Tennille and Angela was at the amusement park.,1497744000,,141,4.68
3133783,3,B0014N0X5E,"It was an okay movie. It was absolutely predictable though surprisingly heartfelt. Much of the acting was choppy (mainly Angela played by Toni Ashley), which made it nearly unwatchable. However, I thought the film definitely had its moments and I enjoyed Tennille (played by Milon V. Parker) on the screen.",1496707200,,306,5.14
3133784,4,B0014N0X5E,It is about time there is a same sex black movie. It was positive with little or no cursing. The acting was not bad either.,1494633600,,123,3.96
3133785,2,B0014N0X5E,This movie was inappropriately long. There were a lot of pointless scenes and moments. I wish the actors actually acted.,1493942400,,120,5.05

3133788,4,B0014N0X5E,"I was a pretty good movie whole time I was like no don't fall for the best friend, it doesn't workout. I swear this situation or something similar happens in every studs life. It happened in mine minus the ending. Matter of fact we're no longer in each others lives. Acting could have been better. But I enjoyed the movie.",1490227200,,322,4.383333333333334

3133790,4,B0014N0X5E,"Toni Ashley may be dreamy and I found her acting decent enough in this movie, but Milon V. Parker was all-around amazing. J'Ca Miller is beyond gorgeous and her character, Ava, was far more relatable and real to me, due to some very good acting skills. The story makes her out to be high maintenance, but she wouldn't try so hard for ""proof"" of Tenille's love if Tenille were as attentive to her as she is to Angela. Her insecurity is completely understandable.

I don't blame Ava for wanting better and asking for it. She even paid for that meal after making a big deal, right? She's not making a point at Tenille's expense. She just wants to be treated well, like everyone else; most especially like Angela.

Side note: Tap water is used for toxic waste dumping in America with of one of the most caustic acids known to mankind: [Fluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6)] aka ""fluoride"" and is not safe for drinking. That's if your fluoridation scheme is sourced from fertilizer processing in Florida. If it comes from China, you could be drinking lead, arsenic and fluoride all at once: All of which are cumulatively damaging to the brain and thyroids. Setting safety aside, the taste of tap water is disgusting, most of the time.

I love a story that takes its time in the telling, so the 2+ hours didn't faze me at all. The added time to give screen time and tangibility to the studs was quite well spent. I loved every one of them! They were good people (Cam's love life notwithstanding) without the serious anger issues that too many stud stories seem to depict. I can see myself hanging out with and dating these characters (if my heart weren't stolen by J'Ca Miller's Ava and they were open to dating white women, that is). That's the kind of slice-of-life romance that speaks to me.

More Than Friends is a better movie than I initially thought after the first fifteen minutes. The kids had a hard time with the material. Ryan seemed to waffle on whether he cared about the competition from Tenille for Angela's affection. I wish that he had a more relatable character that wasn't so stereotypical. The chemistry wasn't really there between the couples most of the time. In the end, it was how the friendships and friends themselves were written and acted that makes Milon V. Parker one to watch out for in the future.

Don't get so into your popcorn that you don't notice fun details like Tenille checking her left hand for evidence and then thinking, ""Ooh- I might have been drunk enough to use my right hand, so I should check that too."" I laughed so hard that I had to replay the following scene. There's also a reference to Captain & Tenille in the movie if you listen carefully. Love it.",1489449600,5,2690,4.572614107883817
3133791,5,B0014N0X5E,"I ended up really enjoying this film. I admit I almost turned it off at first.  It had a lower budget and more inexperienced cast than I was expecting and the story seemed a little lost. But about halfway through it started picking up steam. Then their first date was so charming, the chemistry between the leads got better and better, the whole cast seemed to relax, and there were some really funny moments in the second half, especially because of two standout performances by the actor that plays Parker's fiancee and  the actor that plays her ""best man"" at the wedding.  But most of all, it got 5 stars from me because Milon Parker has something special going on.  Some kind of sexy something - something that completely caught me off guard. I'm femme. I like femme girls...only...or so I thought...until about 30 minutes ago. Whew!",1488844800,4,837,4.673469387755102

3133793,4,B0014N0X5E,The storyline for this movie was a good choice and at first I was going to give it 3 stars but the more I got into it the more I enjoyed though the acting could have been stronger.  The music was excellent . I loved the way it ended and definitely worth watching,1488153600,4,262,3.943396226415094
3133794,5,B0014N0X5E,"What I enjoyed most was the depiction of the ""stud"" or butch females in this movie. Very real representation of black females who are more aggressive, which you hardly ever see represented, and when you do it's a bad image. Cute movie. Kept me engaged. Glad they finally got together!",1488153600,2,284,4.7

Intelligent, articulate, employed, living life as any other person does, and experiencing all the challenges there in.

This film has some really special footage ... the best footage is some really excellent nest-making footage, a rival female hummingbird that trespasses and pesters the mother, the dedicated mother sitting on eggs and looking around defensively, and later feeding a nestling. The producers do a good job of showing how the same hummingbird (most likely the same) nested three years in the same tree, and the sad fact that only one of six eggs hatched due to storms and predators.  The only irritating feature is that the frame and view-finder of a camera is superimposed on screen the entire time.  The music is quite good.

So, my already being such a huge TV an movie buff as it is, I decided to finish the movie regardless.

I hate it, I miss him, and I just feel as if my life isn't complete without him in it.  All of my best friends...my true friends...are all gay except for a select very few.

3368287,4,B0014N0X5E,"Toni Ashley may be dreamy and I found her acting decent enough in this movie, but Milon V. Parker was all-around amazing. J'Ca Miller is beyond gorgeous and her character, Ava, was far more relatable and real to me, due to some very good acting skills. The story makes her out to be high maintenance, but she wouldn't try so hard for ""proof"" of Tenille's love if Tenille were as attentive to her as she is to Angela. Her insecurity is completely understandable.

I don't blame Ava for wanting better and asking for it. She even paid for that meal after making a big deal, right? She's not making a point at Tenille's expense. She just wants to be treated well, like everyone else; most especially like Angela.

Side note: Tap water is used for toxic waste dumping in America with of one of the most caustic acids known to mankind: [Fluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6)] aka ""fluoride"" and is not safe for drinking. That's if your fluoridation scheme is sourced from fertilizer processing in Florida. If it comes from China, you could be drinking lead, arsenic and fluoride all at once: All of which are cumulatively damaging to the brain and thyroids. Setting safety aside, the taste of tap water is disgusting, most of the time.

I love a story that takes its time in the telling, so the 2+ hours didn't faze me at all. The added time to give screen time and tangibility to the studs was quite well spent. I loved every one of them! They were good people (Cam's love life notwithstanding) without the serious anger issues that too many stud stories seem to depict. I can see myself hanging out with and dating these characters (if my heart weren't stolen by J'Ca Miller's Ava and they were open to dating white women, that is). That's the kind of slice-of-life romance that speaks to me.

More Than Friends is a better movie than I initially thought after the first fifteen minutes. The kids had a hard time with the material. Ryan seemed to waffle on whether he cared about the competition from Tenille for Angela's affection. I wish that he had a more relatable character that wasn't so stereotypical. The chemistry wasn't really there between the couples most of the time. In the end, it was how the friendships and friends themselves were written and acted that makes Milon V. Parker one to watch out for in the future.

Don't get so into your popcorn that you don't notice fun details like Tenille checking her left hand for evidence and then thinking, ""Ooh- I might have been drunk enough to use my right hand, so I should check that too."" I laughed so hard that I had to replay the following scene. There's also a reference to Captain & Tenille in the movie if you listen carefully. Love it.",1489449600,5,2690,4.572614107883817
3368288,5,B0014N0X5E,"I ended up really enjoying this film. I admit I almost turned it off at first.  It had a lower budget and more inexperienced cast than I was expecting and the story seemed a little lost. But about halfway through it started picking up steam. Then their first date was so charming, the chemistry between the leads got better and better, the whole cast seemed to relax, and there were some really funny moments in the second half, especially because of two standout performances by the actor that plays Parker's fiancee and  the actor that plays her ""best man"" at the wedding.  But most of all, it got 5 stars from me because Milon Parker has something special going on.  Some kind of sexy something - something that completely caught me off guard. I'm femme. I like femme girls...only...or so I thought...until about 30 minutes ago. Whew!",1488844800,4,837,4.673469387755102

The background area appears to be Chicago and the actors are all very natural in their approach.  This film is about love, friendship, life goals, fear, status quo and becoming/being yourself no matter who you are. The characters and script, in my opinion, works well for any adult audience type.",1519171200,,702,5.131578947368421
