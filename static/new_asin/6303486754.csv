661914,5,6303486754,"I first saw this movie back in 1995, and I didn't think too much about it.  But that is the way I am when I see a movie the first time.  I need to watch them a few times and that makes me decide whether or not I like the movie.  Before seeing Houseguest, the only other thing I had seen Sinbad on was the television show ""A DIFFERENT WORLD"".  He was funny, but not like he was in HOUSEGUEST.  In my opinion, SINBAD is one of the best comedians out there even though you really don't see much of him anymore.  At least I don't.  His comedy is really funny, and I have a hard time finding something funny when it is clean.  He is out of control, and he would probably be a blast to be around.
I guess I can't say that I have a favorite seen in the movie.  The open scene when he is sitting in what looks like his Porsche, and say's ""HEY GIRL"" and the drives a way in a rust bucket....  There really isn't a moment in the movie where he is sad.  He is always smiling and always keeping a positive attitude towards everything....  I could go on and on, but I will leave it here.  I hope that they release this movie on DVD, but I doubt they will...  Anyway, check it out.  I give it 5 stars.
This is a movie that I never bought, but I should do so.  A few years back I would keep renting it every weekend from the video store.  It wasn't a bad deal, because I would pay 99 cents and have it for 5 days, but I never got sick of it.....",1030665600,,1430,3.8758620689655174
661915,5,6303486754,"It's about time that Houseguest made it to DVD!  This is a very funny movie.
Sinbad pretends to be an old friend of Phil Hartman and movies in with Phil and his family to hide from some bad guys that are after him.  As usual, Hartman plays the straight guy, and Sinbad is the goofy funny man.  Anyway, some hilarious hijinks occur as Sinbad tries to fit in with Hartman and Hartman's upper crust friends.
Buy this DVD if you want to laugh!!!",1027468800,8,441,4.289156626506024
661916,5,6303486754,"Being Canadian, I wasn't familiar with the work of Sinbad until a few years ago. Then, at a curling post-game party a few months ago, a friend showed this movie on his basement VCR. What can I say? This movie is simply amazing. Sinbad is one of the funniest people on Earth, nay the World! I'm a simple man; hockey and my beautiful Canadian family are all I really care about. But for 90 minutes, Sinbad made me forget my drinking and gambling problems and laugh my long-john's off! Great flick! 5 Stars! P.S. the race scene at the end is fantastic!",1019952000,,549,4.392156862745098
661917,5,6303486754,"Critics weren't able to appreciate ""Houseguest"", but when I finally saw this film a couple of years ago, I certainly was. And you probably will too, provided that you are up for an hilarious movie that is able to take a one-joke premise and turn it into nearly two hours of pure enjoyment. Sinbad and Phil Hartman are both outstanding: two hilarious entertainers doing what they do best - a pleasant comedy. Both are funny in their own ways, and both carry the movie's premise to make it completely harmless entertainment.
There are tons of laughs along the way, once you accept the bizarre premise and don't question the plot details. It's a silly, feel-good comedy, and in that sense, it succeeds. Don't expect something that makes you think (although it will at points), don't expect something without physical comedy. For instance, there are some of the most poorly-written, dumbest slapstick gangsters in this film, and yet it doesn't make you dislike the movie.
This movie most definitely deserves to be released on DVD, in widescreen. It's a funny romp that the whole family can enjoy, and will have you laughing a LOT more than the typical comedy release. I can't wait for Disney to release Houseguest to DVD, so I don't have to rely on television broadcasts!",1011484800,2,1267,4.81651376146789
661918,5,6303486754,"I love this movie.  It is really funny.  Sinbad is AWESOME in this and so is Phil Hartman.  There is scene after scene of hilariousness in the most bizarre situations one could get into, but Sinbad pulls them off beautifully.  Highly recommend!",1002758400,,244,4.738095238095238
661919,5,6303486754,"I loved this! After I first saw this I was thinking that why I haven't heard about this before. I mean, this is so good that it's weird that this isn't as popular as Titanic or something... This was so funny and relaxing!  You've got to watch this! Sooner or later, I bet that this will get the  popularity it deserves.",949190400,,319,4.213114754098361
661920,5,6303486754,"This is without a doubt one of the funniest comedies ever made!  Sinbad and the late Phil Hartman are a hilarious duo. It's GREAT to see a comedy that the whole familiy can see. From the beginning scene with the  ""Porsche"" to the expressway antics in the Volvo to the Ridin' on  the rail with the Jeep this movie is TOPS. It's educational, too. (Your  children will have a better ""check"" pass when playing  ""21"" on the basketball court. Hurrah for Sinbad's ""House  Guest""",943660800,2,471,4.5476190476190474

It's one of the few movies with Sinbad in it that we both like to watch together. It's more geared towards family comedy with a little side of family drama.,1427155200,,336,3.8142857142857145

662885,5,6303486754,"This is one of the funniest, feel good films I've ever seen.  Sinbad, as usual, is amazing and can play it straight and serious, or use his skills as a great comedian and actor to elicit belly laughs.  I love the late Phil Hartman.  He was a terrific comedian (and usually played smarmy characters) and in his role as Gary he's a sweet, almost clueless fellow.  Kevin endears himself to Gary and family, and Gary's friends.  The real Derek shows up, and is a ""stuffed shirt"" type, a humorless man.  I won't tell more so as not to spoil this film for those who haven't seen it.  I've watched Houseguest at least 100 times over the years, and it's a great ""pick me up"".",1417996800,,667,4.330645161290323

Phil Hartman plays a funny, rich father who welcomes Sinbad into his house. He feels very comfortable around Sinbad, as does the members of his family. While getting to know the members of the family, he helps out the kids with their problems, especially one sister who is going through a typical boyfriend, parents not understanding her, problem. This scene is alone is one reason why anyone, especially a parent with a high school daughter going through this, should get this movie.

I also like a good mystery. This has both. The storyline takes so many twists and turns that you cannot be bored, the characters in the film all grow, I found myself laughing through the whole movie, and watched it twice back to back just to pick up clues and nuances that I missed on the first viewing. Thoroughly enjoyed it and almost wish I had purchased rather than rented. I very much like the new 3 day rental period over the 24 hr rental. That was nice.",1391126400,4,627,4.105691056910569

No bathroom humor, no vulgarity, no sex, no one is humiliated, so it may not work for everyone but it sure works for me.

First, it took about 4 weeks to receive the DVD.  And then, when I tried to play it, it wouldn't play due to ""regional restrictions"".  The disk was shipped from the United Kingdom and won't play in the US.  When I contacted pbshop about this problem, they said that the disk indicated it was a ""region 2 dvd"" and I was somehow supposed to know that it wouldn't play in the US.  How was I supposed to know where a ""region 2 dvd"" will play, and why would someone in the US buy a product to be shipped from the UK that can't be played in the US?  Total nonsense.

663264,5,6303486754,"Anyone who would rate this movie with low stars is a moron with no sense of humor and has no constructive criticism. This movie made me laugh in every scene and Sinbad is a riot as he pretends to be a veggie-eating dentist when in reality, he's a guy who has invested in every ""get-rich-quick"" scheme, including $5,000 of the Mob's money, of which they want $50,000 back. So he has to run and hide from the Mob and runs into Phil Hartman's character by accident at the Pittsburgh airport. Then he decides to pose as the houseguest that Phil Hartman is obviously waiting for.

During his stay, Sinbad dives deep into the family's routine of things and ends up making life better for all of them, including saving a troubled marriage and helping Hartman stand up to his boss. So when his identity is established, Hartman thinks nothing else but trying to help Sinbad from the trouble he's in.

What was real hilarious in this movie was Sinbad trying to realize what his ""career"" is after the fiasco at the local school's Career Day, and even ends up trying to interrogate the little girl about it. Buy this movie!",1296432000,,1111,4.55

Thankyou SO MUCH for this DVD. I've been looking for it for forever. It's not sold in any stores anywhere that I can see. Except for Amazon online, which rocks :D Your service was prompt and quick, and it came in brand new condition, just as stated.

The bad guys are hilarious. 'I almost saw 'em!'  'What do you mean you almost saw 'em?'

663314,5,6303486754,"HOUSEGUEST is definitely by far my all-time favorite comedy. Kevin Franklin, a down-on-his-luck orphan owing a gambling debt he can't pay, hides from money-hungry gangsters with a suburban family under the guise of the father's old camp buddy. Hilarity ensues, scene after scene, all the way through the credits. The main characters are warm, endearing and well-rounded. The sometimes too-perfect and coincidental plot elements require suspension of disbelief by the viewer, but the humor heaped throughout makes it a wild ride worth watching anyway. Whoever conceived the odd pairing of Sinbad and Hartman is brilliant. It's a clean, family comedy with a bit of slapstick, but mostly it's uproarious situations and truly well-written dialogue. If you don't laugh at something in this film, check your pulse, because comedic delight can be found at every turn and there's something for everyone. So many scenes from this film crack me up just thinking about them or if someone mentions them. Some are Brick House being sung at a party, the Camp Mapleridge song to which Kevin doesn't know the words and says he wishes he had some Dairy Queen, novacaine hands, speed golf, ""it was just blood and bubbles and butts...his eye...his eye was on me"", the entire railroad track scene. The McDonald's scene shown in slow-mo with the all-familiar jingle, which some deem as a commercial, is actually one of my favorites. Who can't identify with being denied something you crave so badly, and when you finally have it in your sights, you run with abandon to get to it? Yeah it's for cheeseburgers, but that's what makes it funny. :)

HOUSEGUEST is my favorite comedy because I can come back to it again and again and still crack up. Most comedies rely on shock value so the joy of viewing is lost after the first time, maybe the second. This one's a rare treasure, a masterpiece of comedic genius. If you're looking for lots of laughs, HOUSEGUEST is highly recommended!",1181779200,2,1959,4.9363636363636365
663355,4,6303486754,"This film has nothing to recommend it except that it is fun. It's not even great comedy, its just fun.

Sinbad plays an inner city character who is always striking out on his get rich quick schemes. Now, a mob boss is out to get him and he is on the run. In desperation at an airport, he assumes the identity of a man for whom a car is waiting at the airport. (Think in terms of the drivers at big airports holding up signs for the people they are supposed to pick up.)

It turns out that he has assumed the identity of a man visiting a friend from college(Phil Hartman). They have not seen each other for many, many years so he is not recognized. Hartman has always talked about this friend and what a great guy he is but his family has never seen him Now they do meet him and put him up as a houseguest. It is only with much difficulty that Sinbad learns that he is supposed to be a famous dentist.

He thinks quickly on his feet and even manages to pull of a complex dental procedure by accident. While he is saving himself, he manages to save the marriage of his ""friend"" , the love life of  their daughter, the sports life of the son and set the ""friend"" up for a new career.

It is implausible at each step but Sinbad and Hartman work well together and they have fun. As a result, the audience does as well.

Be sure to keep the show running through the credits. The duet sung by Hartman and Sinbad in praise of junk food truly warms the heart...and clogs the arteries.",1177372800,,1475,4.13986013986014

663359,5,6303486754,"As someone who keeps up with comedy films and comedians I would say that the script, cast(Phil Hartmen and Sinbad in particular) make this movie one of the best. Right up there with Eddie Murphys 48 hours and other earlier movies.

I'm not too big on buying movies however I abs. had to have this one.",1139184000,10,301,4.375
663360,3,6303486754,"Did anyone else get scared, considering that Phil was later killed by his wife? Especially with all the arguing in the film between Phil's character's wife & him. It's kinda weird considering I had no idea who he was, but I instantly know his voice from the Simpsons as Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz. (Who does those voices now?) He's a miss.

And how fun was Sinbad? He's a mixture of all the best comedic actors, but he puts his own spin on things. He was perfect in this film, up against Phil's uptight character.

I found this film a bit slow to get started, but it was really got going after a while. It wasn't as exciting as it possibly could have been, but the actors playing the kids were actually quite good, apart from the wee boy. Someone kick him.

The best scenes in the whole movie? Most definitely the scenes with the party & everyone getting drunk. Hilarious. There's plenty of laughs, and has a feel of Home Alone about it, except with an adult, rather than a kid.

I have to say this isn't the kind of film I'd normally watch, but I'd definitely watch more Sinbad films in the future. He's so funny! And the fact his character wrote a book at the end of the film, how original! The finale is quite sickly sweet & predictable however, and Jeffrey Jones annoys me in every film he appears in. He plays the exact same character, and is so very bland! But it's a funny movie, and sad to see Phil Hartman in the good ol' days.",1127520000,4,1438,4.295202952029521

663362,4,6303486754,"Sinbad and the late Phil Hartman team up for this comedy about mistaken identity. I like the theme of mistaken identity, because it almost always leads to something funny and can be stretched through the entire length of a book or a movie.
The acting was pretty good. There are several scenes in the movie in which Hartman's character is having a row with his wife--and that I could not watch without a heightened sense of realism and an almost grotesque and somewhat sickening dark feeling, in light of what would happen to Phil Hartman in real life not long after the movie was released.
Anyway, Sinbad and Hartman made the movie fun. And I certainly enjoyed the fast pace. The Italian gangsters the movie portrays may appear flat, stereotypical, and silly, but that's not necessarily a bad thing in the context of the whole movie. The gangsters are a prop, a background, they were not meant to be these grand characters. They are simply there so that Sinbad could run away from were he was and end up in Hartman's family. It is a comedy, after all, and it calls for comical characters, not grand characters; for exaggeration and misunderstanding, not for hard core realism and clarity.
I definitely recommend Houseguest.",1058054400,,1223,4.773584905660377
663363,5,6303486754,"Definitely one of the most underrated films, ""Houseguest"" is laugh out loud funny! Sinbad is utterly hilarious and works harmoniously with Phil Hartman.
It's about a man named Kevin Franklin (Sinbad), who owes money to a couple of loansharks. After threatening to kill Derek, he runs to an airport desperately trying to find a way to make it out of their alive, and happens to hear Gary Phil Hartman describing to his kids what his long-lost friend Derek Bond looks like, as they stand there waiting for him. Conveniently, Kevin happens to fit the description perfectly, and jumps up, taking on Derek Bond's identity.
One of my favorite things about Sinbad comedy is that he is able to be extremely funny without being provocative. He doesn't rely in sex to sell, which is quite different from most comedians these days.
If you read the back of the movie, you may think, ""Wow, this sounds like it has a lot of potential to be funny. But does it?"" And to sum it up in one word: YES! Not too slap-stick, not to talky, just perfect. Give it a shot!",1050710400,3,1045,4.5638297872340425
663364,5,6303486754,"Most family movies seem hastily thrown together but HOUSEGUEST is an exception. The dialogue sparkles, the direction isn't just 2-takes-and-go, the cinematography is whackily speeded up in some places and the editing is rapid fire. And unlike most family movies, it lasts for 110 minutes. That's about half an hour longer than is usual. I know this hardly seems like a valid point but I reckon it proves the movie's got more content than fart jokes etc.
My only gripe is the obvious McDonalds plugging about 40 minutes in. If you can just turn away for these 10 seconds then it's not so bad. It's a shame that it's there tho because it tarnishes the credibility of the movie.
Sinbad is always good and the late, great Phil Hartman can make any film watchable so they really add to this brilliantly entertaining comedy. Do yourself a favour and watch it. It's not just for kids. I watched my VHS a zillion times and I was so impatient for this DVD to be released.
So it's barebones, but who cares? I'm just glad to have it. The 1.78:1 anamorphic picture is super and the Dolby 2.0 surround track is decent enough. After all this is a dialogue driven comedy but some sound effects and music are presented pretty well. My subwoofer even go a big kick from a gunshot near the end.
