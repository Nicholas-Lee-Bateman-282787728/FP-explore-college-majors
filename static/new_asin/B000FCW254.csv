2561241,4,B000FCW254,"Secrets of Archaeology is an excellent video narrative of many ancient sites. A nice overview of the history is given while the sites are shown in good detail. However, I was hoping for something that would show and talk more about the actual excavations and findings at these sites. To me the little things, like beads, pots, tools, etc. that are unearthed are more telling and often more interesting than the general histories.",1229040000,3,429,4.890410958904109
2561242,2,B000FCW254,"I was shocked that this expensive DVD series seems to have been filmed about thirty years ago, the film colours and quality is of a poor quality. The content is not about secrets but is commonly held beliefs about everything. We still today are not able to build the pyramids and how they built them is still a mystery but this DVD will have you believe that the anicent eqyptians built them, when there wasn't even any trees in the area, just like now, so they couldn't even have rolled the stones.... I however watched this whole series and found it fasinating.",1227744000,3,563,4.529411764705882
2561243,5,B000FCW254,"Congratulations to all people who made possible the release of this masterpiece. It is a series of documentaries in most of the important archaeological sites around the world with a very good text, excellent narration and quality of image, lovely music and a superb photography. The box as a container is so creative. I recommend this pack not only for private or familiar presentations but also for schools in order to motivate the study of ancient history and travels around the world in search of these ancients marvels.",1220659200,,524,4.965909090909091
2561244,5,B000FCW254,"I agree with others that this is one of the best historical documentaries available, especially on Classical Mediterranean civilizations (Greece, Rome, and others).  There are six discs in the series, each disc containing five episodes of 20 minutes, except the last disc which has only two.  Although 20 minutes may not sound like much, so much is packed into each episode that they do not disapoint.

Each episode shows historical ruins related to its subject, beginning with maps to let you know when and where you are, and frequently using animation to reconstruct the ruins as they appeared in their prime.  The narration uses the pictures as a starting point to discuss the culture and history represented by the ruins.  The series frequently provides a fairly in depth discussion of the culture, ordinary life, religion, etc. of the peoples who lived in these locations, not just stories of battles and rulers.

The other outstanding aspect of this series is that it covers a wide variety of cultures, time periods, and geography.  It works best where history can be told as the history of individual cities, which is the case in the Mediterranean world (the great majority of the episodes) and also for the Mayans in America.

A good example of the unusual approach of this series is episode two.  From the title ""Glorious Rome"", I was expecting a tour of classical Rome using models and virtual recreations, since good examples of these are now available.  Instead, the episode showed only brief shots of the unreconstructed Roman forum, and centered instead on the ruins of outlying Roman cities to show the common culture which existed over the extent of the empire.

The series, which encompasses 27 journeys to sites and cities, not only presents current filming, but also, in many cases re-creates the sites using phenonemal computer graphics that let you sort of see what these places looked like when they were built.

This is so comprehensive, I can't wait to get it.",1147132800,33,539,4.912087912087912

8120848,5,B000FCW254,"I accidentally stumbled onto this series on one of PBS' subchannels (WBEC). I've always been into ancient artifacts and art. I love watching History Channel and shows in general about ancient civilizations.

Secrets of Archaeology (SoA) is a great for those also interested in ancient artifacts, and it's told in a different way. There are no interviews or other corresponding voices. Only FANTASTIC narration by Roger Steffens. His voice is calming and strong at the same time. He speaks in a perfect pitch to give focus to certain sites, giving you time to digest the information. The music used is also very elegant. It gives a certain mood depending on the location (Mexican/Aztec sites use a flute in the background, while Mediterranean episodes play more drums, sitars and soft whistles). It is very calming and not too overbearing to interfere with the narration.

Extensive 3D models are used to show how sites used to look before they were destroyed. Although the 3D graphics may look a tad dated (it's from 2002), it's still used nicely.

Besides the usual ancient sites known by everybody, there is added focus on other out-of-the-way spots, such as small Greek Islands like Delos. It also talks about daily lifestyles of the people in each country. What they wore, what they ate, etc.

There are 27 episodes in all on 6 discs (5 on each disc, except for 2 on the last). Personally, I felt there could've been AT LEAST 30 more episodes. Most showcase land around the Mediterranean (N. Africa, Italy, Greece, etc.), and a few focus on the Americas. But I would have liked to see more countries including:
-Ireland (Newgrange)
-England (Stonehenge)
-China (Great Wall)
-India (Maabalipuram -sp?)
-Israel (Dome of the Rock, ancient temple of Solomon, Via dolorossa)
-N. America (Chaco Canyon, Pueblos)

Aside from this tiny nitpick, what is shown here is MAGNIFICENT. The voice work is excellent, the pacing is perfect and each 30-minute episode is packed with enough to leave you satisfied.

I hope there will be a volume 2 in the future!",1303171200,,2047,4.936046511627907
8120849,1,B000FCW254,"The script and explanations of the sites are very Eurocentric... I bought this to preview and possibly show in my archaeology class; however, I would not show something like this ... The information is not new and worded from a very specific perspective... Archaeologist excavated, but they had nothing to do with the script of this box set... If I had it to do over again, I would pass on this documentary. However, as an alternative; Mysteries of the Ancient World by readers digest is something I would recommend and I have shown it in my class.",1280275200,9,548,4.65979381443299
8120850,5,B000FCW254,"Archaeology Secrets is wonderful.  Some of the episodes have been viewed on television.  There are six disks and 12+ hours of viewing.  I enjoy watching them over and over.  I will certainly purchase more sets of this caliber and interest.  Fascinating no matter how many times it is viewed.

8120851,4,B000FCW254,"I discovered this series in from my local library's DVD collection some time ago and am glad I did. It's pretty cool. Each episode shows footage of different ancient ruins from different locations and cultures around the world, juxtaposed with computer-generated reconstructions thereof, showing what they looked like in their prime while the narrator goes over the history and cultures surrounding them.

Each segment, taken individually, is very good, but I have one minor quibble about the series as a whole: It is far from being ""comprehensive"" as the cover claims. Overall coverage of the world's archaeological sites is lopsided and haphazard. Over half the segments are about Greek and Roman sites and there are none at all about Mesopotamian, Chinese or Indian sites, even though some of these cultures had as much impact on the course of human history as Greco-Roman civilization and all of them had much more impact than the American Indian civilizations covered. There also wasn't any coverage of the Hohokam or Anasazi ruins here in the American Southwest, which I would have liked to have seen. For these relatively minor flaws, I'm knocking off one star.

In a nutshell, this series doesn't cover everything it should, but what it does cover, it covers very well. If you're interested in the civilizations which are covered, you won't be disappointed.",1261180800,3,1365,5.116591928251121
