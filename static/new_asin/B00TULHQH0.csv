7022666,1,B00TULHQH0,"This is not a review of Season 4 of the show, this is a review of one of the physical discs that arrived. It simply does not play. I tried two different DVD players and the disc failed to play in either. There's something wrong. Just as a side note: I've bought other DVD-R products from Amazon (and elsewhere), and I'm pretty sure this is the only one that has failed to play. So I don't think this is an issue with DVD-R products in general, I think there is a specific problem with this specific product. I look forward to a fix so I can watch Season 4.",1429920000,11,556,4.110091743119266

7022672,5,B00TULHQH0,"Both discs played on my blu-ray player without any issue, although any time I've had an issue with something I've bought from Amazon there has never once been any problem getting them to supply either a replacement or a refund.  I can't speak to the issues anyone else might be having individually with this title but I can assure you that a fully functional copy was sent to me on the first attempt.  Either the problem discs have been weeded out or Amazon has heard the complaints and done something about it (or both).

As for the material itself, this may be the strongest in the series so far.  All the elements that made the first three seasons compelling to watch have somehow been turned up another notch for this fourth season.  The theme throughout most of the episodes involves Louie himself taking big chances in the love and romance department, which offers guest performers marvelous opportunities to shine.  A two-part episode focusing on drug use mixes a present day conflict for Louie as well as an extended flashback to his teen years and made for a thought provoking and ultimately touching interlude.  As a result, I think this batch of episodes helped me fall more in love with the story, the lead character, and the entire ensemble.  There are no extras but that shouldn't matter if the basics are done well; picture and sound quality are both fantastic and the episodes are apparently complete, so I'm happy with the presentation.  These things are subjective, of course, so take all of this for whatever you feel it may be worth.",1433548800,,1553,4.722222222222222

7022674,1,B00TULHQH0,waste of time. dvds cheaply made that your lucky to play in any dvd player. either amazon don't care about the quality of their product or they hope enough suckers don't get a refund before its too late.,1433289600,,203,4.368421052631579
7022675,2,B00TULHQH0,"I'm giving 2 stars because the first disc worked and Amazon provided return postage for the exchange.  Hopefully the replacement works on both discs, and they figure out the issue of production.  Ya can't mess around when making ""Louie"" content.",1433116800,3,245,5.1

8703173,4,B00TULHQH0,"To anyone who is hesitating (as I was) to purchase this based on reviews regarding defective discs, I contacted customer service on two different occasions to ask if the problem was resolved.  The first time (5/31/15) I did not get a definitive answer.  Tried again after a couple of months (8/6/15) and this time the representative confirmed that there was no longer an issue with the discs.  I went ahead and ordered it.  Tested the discs when they arrived and no problems, everything seems to be working fine at this time.

As for the show, it's brilliant.. hard to describe because it runs the gamut - hilarious throughout but unpredictable always, it's not only funny but dramatic, moving, even suspenseful/scary at times ..and everything in between, every combination thereof.

I don't understand why they went the DVD-R route after the first two seasons, the series is deserving of better than that and by all indications seems to have a fan base plenty big enough to support it.",1439337600,13,986,4.874251497005988
