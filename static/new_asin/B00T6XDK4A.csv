The video is a history lesson mostly about Bruce Lee and the martial arts.  I thought it was an exercise video led by Churck Norris and Bruce Lee that one could follow along with.  Wrong!  The video shows Bruce Lee and other martial artists doing THEIR workouts.  Many sparring scenes.  You only get a small clip about Churck Norris and they show him in his youth leading a class of young people.  Also, the DVD would not play on my DVD player.  I had to watch it on my computer.",1489449600,,598,4.363636363636363
