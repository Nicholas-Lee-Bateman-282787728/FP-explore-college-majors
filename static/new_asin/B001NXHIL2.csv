8328376,5,B001NXHIL2,"Intelligent, moving documentary about a dedicated young female Ethiopian-American doctor exploring the reasons for the frighteningly high rates of HIV infection among poor African-American women.  Eventually she returns to her family homeland and finds much the same situation there. Along the way she discovers things not only about the disease, but about how women of all races and classes -- including herself --deal with men, power, and sexuality.  We also get to know a couple of her patients, and their journey.  Not a perfect film, but very worthwhile for managing to be powerfully personal and political, sad and hopeful, all at the same time.  And its inspiring to see a a film about a real, unglamorous, young, not-famous, African-American heroine who is making a difference in the world - sadly not a common subject for films.  I hope this finds an audience. Right now it's being distributed by 'Neoflix', a service that helps filmmakers market directly.  Worth supporting.",1279324800,,984,5.19620253164557

8328378,5,B001NXHIL2,This was one of the most informative documentaries I have seen in a while.  The content had comedy as well as drama and the reality of women dealing with AIDS was very heart felt.  The soundtrack was monumental and right on the money for the subject matter in the movie.  I give mad props to the women who bared there souls and let them into their lives.  The courage it must of took to participate revealing their souls.  I want to thank each and everyone of these ladies as well as the Dr. who took on this project.  I wish the soundtrack had been released.,1230336000,2,559,4.276190476190476
