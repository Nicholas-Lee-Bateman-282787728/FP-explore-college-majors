8407033,5,B003VQO4U2,"I watched the seasons on hulu - it was fantastic! You have to make it past the first three chapters before you get the awesome stuff like ""robot love story"" which is the absolute best, in my opinion. If you like dancing, but want something new, then this is it! It combines a story that isn't ground breaking so much as the extremely unique approach to story-telling. This is dance mixed in with just about anything you can think of.

Watch, at the very least, Robot Love Story on hulu before you decide whether or not this is worth it!!
