Even though I own Sound of Music in every possible ""anniversary"" released version (DVD and Blu-ray), South Pacific (Blu-ray Original Release), and all the other titles in DVD, I was willing to buy the set for 79.99 because I wanted the roadshow version of South Pacific and the Todd-AO version of Oklahoma in Blu-ray (and I wouldn't mind the other titles in Blu-ray, either). However, I feel insulted by the abrupt price change and will wait until they dismember the set and sell each individual film for 5.99 (trust me, it will happen sooner than later). The rules of capitalism will apply to these suckers and patient customers will win in the end.",1396224000,18,719,4.76

3037834,5,B000Z63ZKG,"These are movie adaptations of classic Broadway shows that stand the test of time. Five of them are unquestionably the greatest of all the Rogers and Hammerstein musicals: ""Oklahoma!"" (staged 1943, filmed 1955), ""Carousel"" (staged 1945, filmed 1956), ""South Pacific"" (staged 1949, film 1958), ""The King and I"" (staged 1951, filmed 1956), and ""The Sound of Music"" (staged 1959, filmed 1965). ""State Fair,"" a minor work, originated as a film and was actually the first to be produced; released in 1945 and remade in 1962, it wasn't staged until 1996. All told, these six films earned 15 Academy Awards.

Extraordinary successes on Broadway and in cinemas, the shows were popular with audiences and critics alike for their magical melodies, strong characters, sweeping storylines, peerless pageantry, and fearless confrontation with social issues, including domestic violence and tragic death, racism and fascism. Not everything the composer and librettist touched was golden, however. The duo collaborated on five other, lesser theatrical productions: ""Allegro"" (1947), ""Me and Juliet"" (1953), ""Pipe Dream"" (1955), ""Cinderella"" (televised 1957, staged 1958), and ""Flower Drum Song"" (staged 1958, filmed 1961), but only the latter was shown in cinemas to less-than-rapturous reviews, and it is not included in this set as it was a production of Universal rather than 20th Century Fox.

This collection was originally issued on 12 DVDs in 2006, but the new 8-Blu-ray box contains sparkling high-definition prints of the films together with all of the voluminous supplementary materials, in standard definition, that were included on the earlier release: many hours of featurettes both vintage and new, audio commentaries (leading lady Shirley Jones charms on both ""Oklahoma"" and ""Carousel""), sing-along subtitles, song-only options, excerpts from a 1954 TV tribute, photo galleries, newsreels, and trailers. And there is much, much more!

For instance, the ""State Fair"" disc adds a rare television series pilot. ""Oklahoma"" is presented in two formats, CinemaScope and the vastly superior Todd-AO. ""Carousel"" is supplemented with deleted songs and the complete film of the play on which it was based, ""Liliom,"" starring Charles Boyer and directed by Fritz Lang. ""South Pacific"" has two editions, the two-and-a-half-hour theatrical release and the three-hour extended version (though the latter is not HD). You also get Mitzi Gaynor's screen test and a 1986 ""60 Minutes"" segment in which Diane Sawyer accompanies author James Michener back to the islands where ""Tales of the South Pacific"" had its genesis. ""The King and I"" features the television series pilot for ""Anna and the King"" and a clip of Yul Brynner accepting his Academy Award for Best Actor.

""The Sound of Music"" disc is the most packed with delights, as befits one of the world's most-lauded musicals and the winner of the Best Picture Oscar. These bonuses include special introductions by Julie Andrews for the 40th anniversary edition and full-length commentaries by Andrews, costar Christopher Plummer, and director Robert Wise. There are over two hours of documentaries and happy reminiscences by the entire cast, intercut with scenes from the movie and behind-the-scenes video, as well as an episode of A&E's ""Biography"" series about the real-life Family von Trapp, plus a brief screen test of a singing and dancing Mia Farrow, who was considered for the role of Liesl.

If these films are as dear to your heart as they are to mine, you really ought to consider splurging on this set. Admittedly, an MSRP of $200 is far too high, but since the box was initially offered at $80, you can be sure the price will come down in time.",1396051200,19,3691,5.281090289608177
3037835,2,B000Z63ZKG,"Can't really write a review on the product until it's released, but I see no mention of extras.

The films are mostly classics, though, and deserve the blu-ray treatment.  I give the four-star rating based on the films, not the product.  The rating may increase if the extras carry over; and we'll have to wait and see the improvements to the picture and sound quality.

Update to above:  The Digital Bits has information about the ""official press release"" relating to this product.  It states, ""Bonus materials include a Sing-A-Long version of The King and I for die-hard musical theatre lovers and more than an hour of behind-the-scenes features for Oklahoma!.""
Wow - the individual DVDs have a TON of extras.  With the amount of space available on a Blue-Ray disc, there's no reason not to include some/most of those extras.  So, missing are such extras as the feature film ""Liliom,"" various documentaries and featurettes, performances from the theater casts; not to mention no indication of any of the extras already included in the ""The Sound of Music"" Blue-Ray.  I think ""die-hard musical theatre lovers"" would prefer deleted material from the films rather than a ""Sing-A-Long"" version of ""The King and I."" Since the review is about the product and not just the films, I have to give this two stars now for a big missed opportunity in what the product could have been.",1396051200,5,1374,4.8626609442060085

3037838,5,B000Z63ZKG,"Wonderful news re the release of an (almost) complete R and H Collection on BluRay.

And especially gratifying, is the long overdue hoped for ultimate picture and sound  editions of OKLAHOMA!, CAROUSEL and THE KING AND I.

But what a missed opportunity that the 1962 version of STATE FAIR has been overlooked for BluRay.

The 1945 version of STATE FAIR is certainly not a minor film but is also a true classic like the others - and the original TECHNICOLOR for that one alone will be worth a good portion the price of the actual collection.

Ross Hunter's wonderful 1961 production of FLOWER DRUM SONG received a brilliant earlier release on Standard DVD by Universal, and should also be part of every collector's library.

And to be fair (no pun intended), the 1962 version of STATE FAIR was available, together with the 1945 version as a very fine quality standard DVD double set, during 2005.

The new Fox Collection will be the BIG hit of 2014.

3037839,5,B000Z63ZKG,"The new price posted of less than $80 for all eight discs (six movies) makes this a fantastic bargain.
I don't live in America, but I believe the legacy of the great Broadway and Hollywood musicals which America has given us are one of the outstanding redeeming features of the barbaric 20th Century. And along with Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, Lorenz Hart and all the others, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II were lustrous adornments to their craft.
The existing blu rays of South Pacific and The Sound of Music show what care Fox has lavished upon the restoration of these classics; they are both demonstration-quality discs of the highest order. Now they are joined by my two favourite Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, Carousel and Oklahoma, with The King and I and State Fair thrown in for good measure.
As a special treat, we are being given two versions of Oklahoma .. the version shot for the Todd-AO widescreen cinema chain, and the version shot for conventional Cinemascope theatres .. two separate movies had to be made as it was not possible to convert one negative into two very different formats -- and the two are quite different in performance and staging. I'll be watching both versions very often and hope you do to.
I hope this Fox release serves as an incentive to others .. especially Warners, whose release of a Blu ray box set of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers is way overdue!",1395532800,47,1419,4.748987854251012

THE KING AND I, CAROUSEL, and STATE FAIR look excellent as to their hi-definition picture, though a cut below the unbelievably brilliant-looking OKLAHOMA Todd AO version.

I had hoped that similar care would have been given to the other discs in the set, but I was very much disappointed. The King and I, for example, is literally unwatchable. The color grading on this release is truly, undeniably terrible. Other reviews mention it, and they are correct. The color can NOT be fixed by adjusting the controls on your TV, as some have suggested. This was a totally botched job, and should never have gone out to the public.
After attempting to watch the King and I disc for 15 minutes or so, I finally just took it out and tossed it in the trash, I was so angry. Was Oklahoma worth the hundred bucks I paid for this set? No, not really.

The previously released South Pacific and The Sound of Music are flawless. Oklahoma! has a mostly perfect picture except for an important day-for-night scene that is mis-timed; the Oklahoma! sound is disputed. Carousel is overly dark and too blue, but watchable with some adjustments to your equipment. Unhappily, The King and I is colored in teal and is unwatchable. Fox has missed an opportunity for repeats of their great success with South Pacific. If you love the films as much as I do, buy it anyway, otherwise wait for someone at Fox to order this fixed.

3037922,4,B000Z63ZKG,"I bought this set specifically to get the Todd-A-O version of Oklahoma. At the time it was only available in this set and for a reasonable price it gave me the opportunity to watch several other classic movies that I have never seen, or only seen on a picture tube TV decimated by late night car commercials.

However this review is for the purchased product, the entire set. In a nutshell, the films rate a 5 as genuine classics, produced in a way that will never be repeated. The enjoyment of being able to watch them full-length at home on a modern flat-screen TV is easily worth a 5.

On the other hand, the transfers range from bad to really bad. No it can't be expected that any of these movies would or could look as good as when they were projected on the silver screen from the original release prints, but with a few of the movies the image and sound quality are so bad it make it difficult to watch the film. Colors wander all over the place, the sound volume goes up and down, and dialogue is sometimes unintelligible. This is a set to own for content only, to be able to watch a classic movie at home. None of them will please a movie connoisseur. But is that a reasonable expectation? That's something that's up to the buyer to decide.

The hardest to watch is South Pacific because the original producer had this thing about dissolving to weird colors every time a character burst into song. The modern transfer to DVD process just didn't seem to be able to handle that and made what was originally an unusual effect into something that seems to be drug induced. I found myself closing my eyes so I could enjoy listening to the song without having to watch the shifting colors.

Straying from the review for a second ... movie reviews at Amazon are the least credible of any review for any product. Are people reviewing a movie that was made 30 years ago because they don't like the story line? Will that make the slightest difference in a movie that's already made? Or are they reviewing the technical quality of the film-to-disc transfer? Regardless of digital technical restoration ""miracles"" there's no way an old movie being played on their TV will ever look like a shot-to-digital current theatrical release. In one instance of the ridiculous, as this is being written on Sept 4, 2014, one of these films - the digitally remastered Todd-A-O version of Oklahoma which won't be sold until October 7, 2014 already has 325 reviews under it, many complaining how bad the color and sound are.

Final rating - a tough call. Certainly a 5 on content. While it would be tempting to rate it a 1 on technical quality, that's not exactly fair for the reason described above.

3037950,4,B000Z63ZKG,"A Fantastic Transfer better then never, with a bad example (STATE FAIR- fuzzy and dark)

When I realize that at last it should be possible to see OKLAHOMA TODD-AO 30 frames/second version I never thought that the final result was so good. What can mean a marketing trick is not less that the best example of BD until now published.  IT IS A MIRACLE! I've been some years ago in Bradford and I see a good copy TODD-AO 30fps but nothing compared with this. I've seen the BD in a screen of 12m x 5,5m and the result was better that the original in film projection in Bradford.

But the good news goes to all the other realeases with the exepcion of STATE FAIR. My copy in DVD is better, more clear and clean. Is really a poor transfer. The King and I very good also. To those that are protesting to the blue efects in the film, they do not have in mind the original color in Cinemascope 55. Do not forget that the author of the image is Leon Shamroy , the same of the South Pacific controversial filters. I ve never seen THE KING ANd I so brilliant and so focused, and of course as the original was, very blue. SOUND OF MUSIC  and SOUTH PACIFIC are not news in BD for me. Both, first rate.

CAROUSEL was the weakest transfer of the good ones but, I insist the original was grainy and many times dark. The definition is very good but cannot be surpass the original. And pay atention that in Cinemascope 55 they have produced only 2 films. It is because exists one reason to that.

Of course that the pack's original price was ridiculous and I profit the promotional price of $50 USD, some weeks ago. Now is 75 bucks but  is now a much better price.

The edition as the problem of no  inclusion the name of the extras in each BD (that are many) nor in back cover, nor  inside.  That point is the most remarkable mistake of this new pack. All in all 4 stars (6 to Oklahoma!) (5 to Sound of Music and South Pacific) (4 stars for  KING AND I  and CAROUSEL and the extras of South Pacific Road Show version (The Miracle of TODD-AO was not a good restoration does not reflect 100% of the original ratio and with a notable bad Syncronization of the sound track vs image).

Only as a Ugly Duck we have STATE FAIR (1946) transfer. It is a Ugly Duck that never will appear as a Swan!  The only possibility is to include the old DVD in the pack. Yes is better that the BD version and of course It is not a Swan, but at least is not a ugly one anymore.

Oklahoma- Cinemascope version, pales against the Todd AO version , doesn't look like any restoration was done, but still very

Carousel- Impressed with the Blu ray, especially the Maine locales, studio shots, slightly  dark at times, excellent blu ray  ****  stars

State Fair- Excellent blu ray, especially since the negative was destroyed years ago  **** stars

The King And I- a mixed bag, some of it looks great, for example the scene when you first meet the King in the throne room is beautiful, some of it is way too blue, somebody must of fallen asleep at the lab, The DVD did not have this problem. The only blu ray I have ever watched  where the dress of a leading lady changes hues, from grey to blue, then back to grey, then blue again  from scene  to scene,  but it's razor sharp.

So, I will try to explain why I gave this collection 5 stars Simply put, it is because my wife and I enjoyed watching these movies. These movies reminded us of our youth and listening to the songs we used to hear and sing was a distinct pleasure. As many have pointed out these films are far from perfection. Some of the colors are really off the wall and some, like the better of the two ""Oklahoma"" versions, are excellent. We saw no problem with the colors in ""The Sound of Music"". ""State Fair"" was not all that bad either.

The five stars are based purely on the enjoyment provided by Gordon MacRae, Shirley Jones Deborah Kerr, Rita Moreno, Mitzi Gaynor, Julie Andrew and many other talented individuals. It would be easy to go through the various films and nitpick the  shortcomings that are plainly visible. But, as already mentioned, this review is based on the many hours of enjoyment that were made possible by these amazing performers, many of whom are no longer with us. Some improvements of the video quality could be achieved by using the TV adjustments. However, watching and listening to Julie Andrews in ""The Sound of Music"" is in itself worth the price of this collection. If you are a ""mature"" or a ""senior"" individual just slip in one of the discs, sit back and relax, don't sweat the small stuff and remember the good old days when you first heard these songs while you enjoy hearing them again..",1406246400,,1530,4.5398550724637685

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Most modern pop music, including the music for most newest Broadway shows, shows a painful lack of something that America once created in enormous quantities, especially melodies. Although the generation that most loved the Rodgers & Hammerstein musicals, is well on its way to passing onto new generations who love these types of musicals and the popularity of those shows is still very strong. As a child of the 1950s, I can attest to the fact that the music of all the shows in 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment's new Blu-ray set The Rodgers & Hammerstein Collection all became a part of our DNA film experience. Across the years families collected 45 rpm record sets, Long Playing Albums and eventually various video formats, including Betamax, VHS, LaserDisc and DVD of these films. They were core family viewing, and I can remember my mother's pleased reaction to our 'shared experience' with them.

The 6 picture set are State Fair; Oklahoma!; Carousel; The King & I; South Pacific and The Sound of Music. Only two have had previous Blu-ray releases; these are presented with the same awesome brilliant transfers, but not all of the same extras.

STATE FAIR was released by 20th Century Fox in a 60th Anniversary Edition DVD in 2005. Although not one of the 'super-productions' that would follow a decade later, State Fair is a sweet, quaint musical of a novel previously produced as a non-musical film in 1933. Fox gave it the full Technicolor treatment, along with the top singing talent Dick Haymes and Vivian Blaine. Jeanne Crain and Dana Andrews are dubbed. Curiously, Dana Andrews began his show business career as a singer but repeatedly declined to sing, as he wanted to be regarded as a serious actor only. After all, Dick Powell had recently succeeded in switching from crooning to straight drama; going the other way was not considered a smart career move.

The 1080p transfer is in great shape and has that candy-colour look of 20th Century Fox musicals of the 1940s. It isn't as sharp as one might expect, but there's definitely more detail present than on the older DVD. The mono audio is strong, if obviously not as dynamic as that on the newer pictures. The songs ""It Might as Well Be Spring"" and Its a Grand Night for Singing"" made the biggest impact with this viewer. The attractive Jeanne Crain and Dana Andrews are plunked down in the middle of a storyline that relentlessly celebrates the joys of rural life. Sorry, but most Iowans people all went to the big city like everyone else.

STATE FAIR has the fewest extras. All of the titles offer the viewer four ways to watch the film. One can play the picture straight through or play it in ""Music Machine"" mode, which skips from song highlight to song highlight. There's also the ""Sing Along"" mode, which adds lyric subtitles to the songs. Finally, ""Play the whole Film with Sing Along"" is self-explanatory.

Between the commentaries and the extras on the discs, one can get a solid, and sometimes fairly critical, overview of their origins in books or the stage and the way the films came together. The commentary on State Fair is by authors Richard Barrios and Tom Briggs. The half-hour documentary From Page to Screen to Stage charts the musical's 'backwards' genesis and it was a movie musical first before being adapted to the stage. Each disc also contains a wealth of visual extras in Still Galleries: often broken down into categories of ad art, behind-the-scenes stills and production stills showing sets, costumes, etc. The one thing missing here that was included on the DVD presentation is the 1962 State Fair remake with Pat Boone and Ann-Margret. It's nobody's idea of a good film, from any angle... but it did have Bobby Darin, and that's kind of fun isn't it.

OKLAHOMA! tends to drags at times and some of the direction is dull, but many of the musical sequences are brilliantly done. The main central ballet motivated by Shirley Jones' song ""Out of My Dreams"" is a marvellous mix of great choreography, staging and direction and its stylised painted sky backdrops look like something from the Japanese film Kwaidan. Song for song, Oklahoma! has possibly the most memorable music of the features in this set. Seen in a good presentation, it's a powerful show.

Mike Todd pulled out of Cinerama and made Oklahoma! as what was to be the first film of a Road Show feature empire. The film invented its own Todd-AO (American Optical) film format. The process and the movie were practically developed together. 65mm wide and five perforations, Todd-AO also ran at 30 frames per second, to cut down on strobing, flicker and 'chatter' during on-screen motion. Todd-AO could not be adapted for normal 24fps theatre use, so Mike Todd was forced to simultaneously film a second standard CinemaScope version of the film. That second version is what had been seen almost exclusively since the late 1950s.

The biggest news of this new Blu-ray set is that the 30-frame Todd-AO version of Oklahoma! is back, this time looking and sounding sensational. The 2005 DVD was something of a disaster for Rogers & Hammerstein fans. It contained both versions, but the Todd-A0 transfer was of awful quality, blurry and diffuse, it looked a mess. Now, ten years later, scanners are so safe that the original negative for Oklahoma! could be scanned, and the result is totally magnificent.

The Todd-AO version was reportedly filmed first and its cameras occupied the best positions. It has been suggested that the quality of the daylight looks better and some of the performances seem fresher in the Todd-AO version, too. The cutting and framing differs between versions, and the Todd-AO cut is eight minutes longer. This disc may be the deal-maker that sells a lot of these boxed sets, although I must add that a stand-alone Oklahoma! is rumoured to be out sometime in the near future. The Todd-AO and CinemaScope versions occupy separate discs. The CinemaScope version looks good too, but is nowhere near as impressive as the Todd-AO version. Both versions have excellent multi-track audio, and the Todd-AO listed as a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound track.

Beyond the four playback options and galleries and trailers, Oklahoma! is graced with two commentaries, one by Shirley Jones and one by Nick Redman; Ted Chapin and Hugh Fordin. There is a Documentary comparing the two format versions, and the development of Todd-AO. Culled from a 1950s TV show are two song excerpts from the show, sung by Gordon MacRae and wait for it, Florence Henderson and is really very good!

Brilliant master producer Mike Todd pulled together resources that historically didn't mesh well with Hollywood, Broadway and the research/technical industry. For a year or so it seemed possible that the 'new' Hollywood might convert to Todd-AO for road shows, with a change to 30fps becoming normal even for standard films. As it happened, the industry would instead slowly lose interest in an expensive 65mm 'big pictures.'

CAROUSEL was also released in 1955. As every studio wanted its own proprietary format, Fox came up with a king-sized CinemaScope system called CinemaScope 55, using an enormous negative withan anamorphic squeeze identical to standard 35mm CinemaScope. When the executives saw the improved quality of print-downs to 35mm CinemaScope, they abandoned plans for large-format projection, just as Paramount had with their own proprietary VistaVision. Carousel and The King and I were the only films shot in CinemaScope 55.

Carousel is the most problematic of the Rogers & Hammerstein features. Although it has some of the series' most beautiful songs, it is the least original and the least exciting visually. The repeat casting of Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRae might seem a quickie follow-up to the previous show, but in actuality, Frank Sinatra walked off the film set when he discovered that he'd have to shoot all of his scenes twice for the CinemaScope 55 and the 35mm version (The 35mm version was abandoned during filming). Director Henry King seems defeated by a production that wastes beautiful New England locations by using them as static backdrops. Not helping are uninspired sets back in Hollywood sound stages that often simply look cheap. After an uninspiring prologue in a smoke and glass 'heaven,' the first earthbound scene is a marvellous, more or less dialogue-free story setup that brings together innocent factory girl Julie Jordan [Shirley Jones] and carousel barker Billy Bigelow [Gordon MacRae]. Billy Bigelow's boss Mrs. Mullin [Audrey Christie] insults Julie and fires Billy Bigelow over a flirting incident, while the marvellous main ""Carousel Waltz"" theme reinforces the notion that an unquenchable love has been ignited.

From that point forward Carousel is directed as if on remote control, with barely a thought given to anything beyond setting up of the great songs. The plotline slogs along like a can kicked down the road. It's best to concentrate on the quality of the musical arrangements and their delivery by the capable cast. Julie loses her job as well, marries Billy Bigelow and becomes pregnant. Egged on by his thuggish false friend Jigger Craigin [Cameron Mitchell], the chronically irresponsible Billy Bigelow goes through with a stupid robbery. Tragedy ensues. Sixteen years later in heaven, a miracle allows Billy Bigelow to return briefly to Earth to try to do one good thing for the daughter he never knew. The ending is a bittersweet tearjerker that verges on the slightly maudlin effect. Although Billy Bigelow barely showed his love for Julie Jordan, their problem seems to have been only a matter of bad communication. He's really a softie enchanted by the idea of having a child. One idea carried over from the source play, is that wife beating can be a matter of ""hits that don't hurt."" In this context, it's a painfully dated embarrassment not likely to be appreciated by activists against domestic violence. I can imagine the horror of a battered wife who sought some psychic relief and chose to attend a 1955 matinee of Carousel. Although Billy Bigelow and Julie Jordan's life is one big mess up, but the message is, that it's okay because ""You'll Never Walk Alone.""

Prominent among the extras for Carousel is a carryover from the NTSC DVD Special Edition, especially the film Liliom [1934] directed by Fritz Lang. It's the French film Fritz Lang made after his escape from Nazi Germany, en route to Hollywood. This non-musical version of Ferenc Moln&aacute;r's play is to Carousel what Pygmalion is to My Fair Lady a total revelation. The film Liliom in this extra; is in the 480i encoded on this Blu-ray, and is far better that the NTSC DVD extra.

Due both to the needs of Broadway musicals and American entertainment in general, Carousel all but emasculates the original Liliom fim, which added a lot more satirical messages about class injustice to its story of a brutal relationship. In the film, we find Liliom (a young Charles Boyer) is much less romanticised heel, and is indeed bad news for Julie [Madeleine Ozeray]. They never marry. He refuses to work and they live in poverty; the fact that she accepts his abuse makes him so ashamed that he hits her. He's soon pretending that he doesn't care, when he's actually crippled by self-loathing. There is no 'wholesome' alternative couple; instead the carousel operator Mrs. Muscat cruelly tries to lure Liliom back, right in Julie's presence. Carousel eliminates a suicide and softens heaven into a quaint stellar waiting room. In Liliom our ignoble hero finds that heaven has a double standard just like on Earth. The wealthy dead get special treatment while he's forced to cool his heels. Instead of returning to a purgatory of star-polishing duty, Liliom's failed mission on Earth will result in an eternity spent in flames. The finale in the Fritz Lang film sees Julie finally being able to express her forbidden love (yes, complete with the un-PC idea of 'hits' that feel like kisses) and sheds a tear that shifts the heavenly balance in favour of the misunderstood rogue Liliom.

The Fritz Lang's film is incredibly well directed, and has a depth of detail and atmosphere not found in the musical remake. As befits a French film untouched by the Hollywood Production Code, the show features some near-nudity. When Liliom is granted a kiss from Julie on a park bench, he proceeds to caress her breast. Moln&aacute;r's play surely influenced Fritz Lang's film Destiny [1921], with its story of a love that can alter the course of the stars. The black-clad emissaries that escorts Liliom to heaven, are also echoed in Jean Cocteau's mysterious art film Orpheus.

With the opening of the film Carousel where the carousel scene is staged on a much smaller scale than the old French film Liliom and the location shooting often lacks an even basic pictorial sense. Louise Bigelow's big ballet scene is staged on a tiny set, and without any of the dramatic lighting scheme that was so effective in Oklahoma! The 4.0 stereo audio track reproduces the directional stereo feel of the original film. In addition to the feature Liliom, the four playback choices and still galleries, the extras for Carousel include a trailer, a newsreel and a making-of documentary. Two deleted songs are heard as audio extras, illustrated with photos. And a TV excerpt has two more song presentations, sung by Mary Martin, John Raitt and Jan Clayton. An Isolated music score is present. The full commentary with Shirley Jones and a well-informed Nick Redman brings forth some interesting questions and answers, instead of the usual interview vacuous fluff.

THE KING & I [1956] is the second and last CinemaScope 55 film and was a massive success whose fame has burned bright for half a century. This time the solid source material was didn't need sanitizing either for the stage or screen; as seen in the popular Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison picture Anna and the King of Siam, the hints of a hot 'n' heavy romance between an English schoolteacher and an Indo-Chinese King remain in the censor-safe theoretical stage.

The story is sound in all departments and the proud Anna Leonowens [Deborah Kerr] and her son have a rough time adjusting to work teaching the many children of King Mongkut of Siam [Yul Brynner]. Although a lively personality, the King's deeply rooted convictions place everyone under his paternal tyranny. Women are chattel and Anna's educated foreigner is only partly an exception. The friendship between sovereign and teacher grows until, in a private meeting in a vast royal reception room, she teaches him to dance the Polka. The major subplot sees Mongkut cruelly separating and punishing two of his 'possessions'. Tuptim [Rita Moreno] is one of his wives, gifted to him by another monarch. Lun Tha [Carlos Rivas] is a worker who brought Tuptim to Siam. They fall in love but under Mongkut's system of bondage have no rights. Anna tries to diplomatically leverage Mongkut's affections to help Tuptim, and to this end stages a Siamese version of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" as the royal entertainment.

Except for some palace exteriors and a street scene The King & I is entirely stage-bound, which is no disadvantage at all thanks to the marvellous sumptuous designs of John DeCuir. The fact that the vision of Siam is a dated stage construction also means little, as what we see is so visually pleasing. The design really comes forward in the bravura ""The Small House of Uncle Thomas"" ballet, where costumes and masks convert Harriet Beecher Stowe's drama into a Siamese fable. As the representative of Western decorum, Anna glides through scenes in giant skirts that disguise the fact that she has legs. The contrast with the sensually costumed Eastern women couldn't be greater.

Yul Brynner dominates the film in the role that both made and capped his career; he'd be performing The King & I stage productions off and on until his death decades later. As for Anna, if Irene Dunne hadn't been too aged for the part she could have performed Anna and sung for her too, instead of being dubbed by Marni Nixon as was Deborah Kerr. Refined, opulent and romantic, but minus messy sex complications. Deborah Kerr's Anna is the one that's remembered, and the role that most types her career. She and Yul Brynner were considered such a hot pairing that M-G-M quickly reunited them in the Cold War thriller The Journey.

As with Carousel, the transfer of The King & I has some odd colour choices. Most scenes are dazzlingly good, especially the Uncle Thomas ballet, but a great many moments look too blue. We understand seeing a blue tinge in night scenes or the stage performance, but normal close-ups of Deborah Kerr will suddenly turn bluish, even in the middle of a scene. It can only be attributed to the condition of the elements. The 4.0 stereo audio has no deficiencies. Mixed much like Carousel, voices and sound effects come across as directional, appropriate for a classic 1950s stereo sound mix.

With the Audio Commentary, Michael Portantiere and Richard Barrios contribute the informed and lively commentary for The King & I, and another track contains a two-channel stereophonic Isolated music score. Five documentaries cover the history of the film and play, the story of the stage version, a quick look at Darryl Zanuck's promotions for CinemaScope, the genesis of the music and a ten-minute overview of the creative teaming of Rodgers and Hammerstein.

One of the other Special Features is a half-hour pilot, which is present for an Anna and the King TV show, with a commentary by its Anna, Samantha Eggar. An extra audio song is present, plus TV excerpts from the stage version with Patricia Morison and Yul Brynner. Roughly ten minutes of The King & I related newsreels are offered as well. Finally, a restoration extra gives us an idea of the huge volume of work required to re-master The King & I from original CinemaScope 55 materials.

This brings us to another Rogers & Hammerstein film musical in which the screen purposely changes colours, and that is South Pacific [1958]. Another huge success, the film had to wait out a particularly lengthy Broadway run so that the film version could be made. The two discs included in this new set are identical to the earlier release. We're still impressed that 20th Century Fox went to the trouble to reconstruct the film's much longer version by fifteen minutes with the Road Show version. Even though the sound quality isn't as rich and the added footage is pale and faded and it's presumably a surviving positive print, which we are grateful to see the extra story detail and additional scenes.

Some people are still not sure about the film's colour experiment, which still seems to attempt to visually suggest moods normally achieved through sensitive direction, but I really love it. But some of the tints work well, especially when the colour-wheel seams don't show. The ever-changing mystery matte paintings of the fantasy island Bali Hai look even better when cast in different hues. But Joshua Logan's overall direction is numbingly flat, letting his locations and the stage-like blocking do all the work.

South Pacific is billed as filmed in Todd-AO, but this time the 30 frames-per-second film speed was dropped, leaving Oklahoma! and Around the World in 80 Days as the only other films shot in the original Todd-AO format. According to author-authorities Carr and Hayes, the cameras actually used were Panavision lenses, which mean that the film is really a standard 65mm production. This was the biggest Rogers & Hammerstein hit of all time, and one of the most popular films of the 1960s and a triumph for director-producer Robert Wise, The Sound of Music was restored several years ago after a complex 8K scan job, and released as a 45th Anniversary Special Edition Blu-ray.

The transfer is worth a little discussion of its own. Four years ago at an industry film restoration convention in America, Fox treated the attendees and lucky hangers-on to a rare comparison test. In the Linwood Dunn Theater at the Academy's facility on Vine Street, they first projected a reel from The Sound of Music in restored 70mm. It's difficult to believe that any video could possibly approach the detail and clarity of the 70mm that the people viewed; the only other film that people compare to this film is the more impressive big format was David Lean's Ryan's Daughter. Then they put up an uncompressed 4K theatrical video projection master of the same The Sound of Music scene.

On this Blu-ray disc The Sound of Music looks absolutely marvellous, with the resolution just good enough to convey the eye-popping clarity remembered from theatrical screenings. The colour throughout is very accurate. The extras for The Sound of Music lead off with an interactive picture-in-picture feature that looks to have been very costly. It puts a choice of several trivia-track choices on the screen, or all of them at once if you so wish. One is a karaoke feature. It all sounds like a perfect arrangement for viewers incapable of doing one thing at a time.

With the Audio Commentary, Robert Wise contributes one commentary, and a second track gathers statements from Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, who was a good sport, despite his put-downs of the film over the years. Charmian Carr, who was the choreographer for Dee Dee Wood and Johannes von Trapp. Like the other titles, this disc also contains the four viewing modes like ""music machine"" and ""sing along."" Accessed through the web is a four-minute piece with Laura Benanti, an actress in a recent Broadway revival of the show.

Finally, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment's Blu-ray of The Rodgers & Hammerstein Collection is totally awesome and is also one of those monster sets that a number of years ago would come in a gift box not likely to fit on the average bookshelf. Instead you get all 8 Blu-ray discs packed into a very tidy package and not much fatter than one for the standard DVD case. The package layout gives a minimum of information about the discs inside. For confirmed Rodgers & Hammerstein musical fans, the big draw here is the marvellous 30fps Todd-AO version of Oklahoma! The transfers of South Pacific and The Sound of Music are just as good, if not perfect, but the higher frame rate makes Oklahoma! pop out so much brighter and clearer and we're just being hit with more information per second, and the fast motion in the dance sequences is much less blurred. I think of myself at the age of five, spinning 45rpm records of these songs on the floor, and find it hard to believe that I can now can see the presentations of the whole films, in totally quality that is totally equal to what I saw when I went to see these films in the cinema and I feel these films look far more superior, and look even more stunning and thank goodness to computer high definition in cleaning up the prints and making sure we have the right soundtrack and I originally had this box set on the Region 1 DVD set and looked good at the time, but this Blu-ray set surpasses all of my expectation and it has now gone pride of place in my Region A/1 Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!

3038002,5,B000Z63ZKG,"I have to wonder if I viewed the same set as some of the other reviewers here!  I am a videophile/film buff who is usually very hard on the studios when they get it wrong.  This set looks fine to me, except for the inexplicable loss of the supplemental disc 2 of TSOM (why??!!).

The remainder of the extras are great, the most important being the Fritz Lang version of LILIOM.  Fox released the 1930 Frank Borzage version on DVD in the MURNAU, BORZAGE, AND FOX box set a few years ago, so it would have been easy (and lazy) for them just to have included that.  The Lang version being included was a complete surprise, previously issued by Kino on DVD.  I think it's better than CAROUSEL!

I do agree with others that the gem in the set is the Todd-AO version of OKLAHOMA!  Even though it is 1080i, it just bursts from the screen.  I think the 1080i format is the appropriate way to handle nonstandard frame rates rather than comforming them to 24p with blended frames or stutter.

I really think Fox has done a great job here, despite dropping the ball on some of the supplements, especially with TSOM.  That one is a real puzzler since all they had to do was throw in the second disc.  I suspect rights issues or other financially related problems were the reasons.",1404518400,6,1268,4.394849785407725

I have no idea when Fox does such a terrific job on its older movies why they would do such appalling job on two of its greatest and most loved musicals. Both look better on standard DVD and why no Pat Boone ""State Fair"" which I much prefer over the twee and dated original (who can not like Ann Margret's dance numbers).My guess is given the level of criticism this release has created I believe ""Carousel"" and ""King and I"" may get a makeover before they are released as solo items (which doesnt seem to be happening any time soon) Fox could learn a lot from Warners and their extraordinary job on ""Hit the Deck"" on blu ray.",1404172800,3,874,4.573248407643312

This set cotains both editions of this play.  I don't like either one.  2 Carousel  3 Stars. This is an enjoyable movie(at times) of one of the duos better plays.  3 The Sound of Music 3 Stars.

3038005,5,B000Z63ZKG,"RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN COLLECTION BLU RAY review

This is a review of the Blu-ray collection.  I owned the DVD versions, so I will be comparing the dvd vs the blu ray discs in picture quality and sound quality.
You already know how iconic the Broadway plays and movies are.  They have become legends and I don't need to restate their importance.

Note: viewed on a Panasonic pt-ae 3000 1080p projector and a Sony Blu-ray player on a 120"" screen.

State fair - blu ray - Very good picture and outstanding sound (considering its an old mono optical sound track and Technicolor 35mm film).  Beats the DVD version.  You don't get the Pat Boone/Ann Margaret version.  Oh well!  I like this older version better.

Oklahoma Todd AO version blu ray. - great!  worth the wait.  One weird thing,  they say it is recorded in 1080i instead of 1080p.  This must be to keep the Todd AO 30fps from being screwed up by the 1080p 24fps (???) .  The projector usually reports on the signal its getting from the blu ray player and it says the movie is 1080p at 60 fps (I am already confused???)  Anyway, it looks great and sounds great too. Very sharp and very clear.  There is no comparison with the old dvd version (or any other version), this one rules!

Oklahoma Cinemascope version blu ray - Very nice, and good picture quality.  The sound is good.  An improvement on the older DVD Version.

Carousel - cinemascope 55 version Blu Ray- very nice. Picture quality varies from very good to outstanding. The sound is slightly better than the DVD version.  Both the DVD and blu ray have some mild distortion in the vocal tracks.  This does include the movie Lilliom, which Carousel is based on and most of the bonus features from the 2nd disk dvd. An improvement on the older DVD Version.

The king and I cimemascope 55 version blu ray- very nice Picture quality varies from very good to outstanding. The sound is slightly better than the DVD version.  Both the DVD and blu ray have some mild distortion in the vocal tracks.  An improvement on the older DVD Version.

South Pacific Todd AO general release version blu ray - outstanding picture and sound. The sound is much better than the DVD version.  The songs with the filter 'enhancement' are just as annoying to watch as the older DVD version. But, thats the way it is, I guess. An improvement on the older DVD Version.

South Pacific Todd AO ""roadshow version"" blu ray -very nice Picture quality varies from very good to outstanding. The sound is much better than the DVD version.  The songs with the filter 'enhancement' are just as annoying to watch as the older DVD version. The lost and restored roadshow footage is in the same condition as the DVD version (faded!). Oh well!  An improvement on the older DVD Version.

The sound of music -todd AO version blu ray - very nice.  The sound and picture quality are outstanding.  Has some blu ray extras that aren't on the DVD version. An improvement on the older DVD Version.

So, its worth it to get the blu ray set.  A few things are missing, a few things are new, but with the overall better picture quality and sound quality, its a nice collection.

And, lets beat this dead horse, again. Some reviewers are complaining about a 'bluer' and darker overall tint on the King and I and Carousel.  This can be easily corrected by adjusting the color temp to be a little bit more 'red' and tweaking the brightness control.",1402876800,21,3408,4.5627062706270625
3038006,3,B000Z63ZKG,"Despite my misgivings after reading the negative reviews on some of the titles in this set, I decided I just really wanted to see for myself so I broke down and bought it after the price went down a bit to $110. I'm wishing now I had waited until it dropped more, but I still don't regret buying it. My thoughts:
STATE FAIR --- I had almost no issues with the transfer on this one, despite the complaints from other sources about it being too dark. The grain seemed natural, if a little heavy in spots, and the colors seemed bright and saturated. I'd give the picture quality a B.
And yes, the remake should have been included in this set, ghastly as it is.
OKLAHOMA --- Yes, yes, yes! The glowing reviews of the Todd-AO version are spot on, from the 30fps smoothness (which enhances the clarity but doesn't look TOO smooth, like when you leave the Tru-motion option on on your TV), to the brilliant restored color and detail with just a fine layer of grain to remind us that it's a film. I was one of the first to write a negative review on the DVD travesty 10 years ago and I couldn't be more pleased with this restoration and transfer. . .it truly enhanced my enjoyment of watching this film again! If only the same loving care had been applied to --- well let's not jump ahead. Picture quality A+. The Cinemascope version by comparison is detailed in some shots but grainy and muddy in others, and some scratching and jumping is evident. It's good to have it to compare to the Todd-AO version in performances and other minor differences, but it's otherwise pretty useless. Picture quality gets a C.
CAROUSEL -- Here's where the real problems begin. I've kept reading how The King and I looked like it had been dipped in a blue wash, and this is true -- but it's just as true, if not more so, with this title. The real shame is, the picture otherwise looks beautiful! No speckles, scratches, or jumps are evident, and the detail, clarity and texture is quite stunning, with very little grain. But that blue wash dulled the color through the entire film. . .Julie's orange dress looks muddy, and even the usually bright ""June is Busting Out all Over"" number looks here like it was filmed during an eclipse. I watched the opening of this movie on VUDU in hi-def and the stars Billy are polishing look crystal white; here they all look blue. I'm very disappointed by the color, thus giving it a C.
THE KING AND I -- Or, Anna Sings the Blues. This looked so much better on VUDU. Like Carousel, this transfer looks like someone did a great restoration on it then dropped the reels into a toilet full of 2000 Flushes Blue cleanser. In addition, several sequences look slightly out of focus before and after the crossfades. . . in other classic films it cuts back to the first generation elements to clarify the scene but there are a lot of what appear to be second-gen shots here. This movie deserves so much better. Picture C-.
SOUTH PACIFIC and THE SOUND OF MUSIC both get an A, but these are not surprising since they evidently used the same great transfers as their previous releases. I had given away my copy of TSOM so the only title I actually double-dipped on was SOUTH PACIFIC, which made getting this set just marginally worth it to me.
The sound is great on all the releases. In the case of CAROUSEL and KING AND I, it is a testament to the power of these films that I enjoyed watching them and was moved once again in spite of the flawed transfers. But honestly, like OKLAHOMA, will we have to now wait another 10 years to get decent high-definition versions of these films that aren't streamed? Really, it's just too bad.",1402444800,18,3631,4.453453453453453
3038007,5,B000Z63ZKG,"I was initially put off buying this set. It was pricey and too many reviews criticized the video and/or audio quality. The nay sayers are dead wrong. This is a great set with clear, sharp images and crystal clear audio. To those who said Mrs. Anna's dress was different colors in different scenes - may I suggest a little less wine before viewing again. Now I KNOW there are friends out there who check their plasmas laying on top of the screen with a microscope in order to find something wrong, something just a little off. Lighten up and be fair to the material. Here is my evaluation across the board; all - I repeat ALL the films are clear, sharp and beautiful to behold. Audio is extremely good considering the age of some of the material. ""King"" and ""Carousel"" delighted me because they used the original four track audio. The early Scope films took great pains to move voices and sounds as the actors moved. Nowadays almost all voices are placed at the center channel. The early Fox Scope films took great pains to create a constantly changing audio staging. So....watch for a price break (I just got one a few days ago) and invest in this set. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM. To the negative reviewers.....dust off your microscopes and begin attacking this review. I choose to enjoy this set - it's nothing short of GLORIOUS!

3038009,2,B000Z63ZKG,"I'm not sure I get the point of Fox's R&H Collection. They've jettisoned the second disc of extras on The Sound of Music, and done next to nothing on Oklahoma! in Cinemascope. Oklahoma! in Todd A-O is 1080i, not 1080p - presumably because this is the only way video can up convert Todd A-O's 30 frames per second. Still, colors just aren't as vibrant as one might expect from a large gauge film format like Todd A-O. The Cinemascope version is a travesty; grainy, riddled in age-related artifacts and even a hint of edge enhancement.

We also lose the 62' version of State Fair. The original 45' version of State Fair looks awful and dark. True, Fox has NO original elements to crib from, but it doesn't look like they've done much to the original video master created for the DVD from 2002. No additional clean up or tinkering with the color and contrast to minimize the ravages of time. Finally, Carousel and The King and I; while the former sports a fairly robust color palette, the sound quality remains grating on the ear - much too strident and with reverb that is distracting. The King and I's image quality fails to dazzle. In fact, colors are fairly subdued. Where is the gorgeous pop and sparkle of Leon Shamroy's Oscar-nominated cinematography?!?

South Pacific and The Sound of Music were previously released in pristine and stellar hi-def transfers.

3038017,2,B000Z63ZKG,"First the good news...the Todd-AO version of ""Oklahoma!"" is stunning, absolutely the best this film has ever looked on video, a BIG improvement over the previous botched by Fox standard DVD. ""South Pacific"" and ""The Sound of Music"" are also excellent transfers, the exact same versions previously released as double discs, the only negative being you don't get the extra disc of special features  you previously got with ""The Sound of Music"". The CinemaScope version of ""Oklahoma!"" is also fine although I can't imagine why anyone would ever want to look at again when the Todd-AO version (and this lovely transfer!) is so much better. ""State Fair"" (the 1945 version rather than the 1962 version in the previous R&H box set) is acceptable but the apparent lack of original Technicolor elements make it not nearly as impressive as what really can be done when original three strip Technicolor negatives are available. ""State Fair"" is probably as good as it will ever look on film or video...but definitely not great!

The big disappointment here is ""The King and I"". As many other reviewers have pointed out it's simply way too dark and has a blue tint throughout! Compare it to the previous standard DVD version and it's like night and day. Even with the higher resolution of Blu-ray and this sourced from restored CinemaScope 55 elements the standard DVD wins by a mile! I can't imagine how this ever got by quality control at Fox. ""Carousel"" definitely benefits from the restored larger negative CinemaScope 55 elements and Blu-ray but it's just too dark. Again comparing it with the previous Standard DVD makes you prefer the former, even with the lesser resolution.

A disc recall and replacement by Fox is in order for especially ""The King and I"" but ""Carousel"" too but I have do idea if we'll see it. The Rodgers & Hammerstein organization which takes great pride in their musicals and authorized this release in fact should DEMAND this recall and replacement. Like many others I already have the standard DVD box set of the R&H musicals as well as the Blu-rays of ""South Pacific"" so there was some major and expensive double dipping just to get Blu-rays of ""Oklahoma!"", ""Carousel"" and ""The King and I' since none of those titles are yet available on single Blu-ray discs.

In summation a BIG disappointment and something the people at Fox should absolutely be ashamed of! Since this is currently an Amazon exclusive Amazon should do the right thing and withdraw this high priced set from sale until Fox remedies the situation with replacement discs for ""The King and I"" and ""Carousel"" and additionally Amazon should offer us suckers...I mean customers who forked out big bucks for this set a full cost refund if we want to return the discs (not just the 50 per cent you normally get for returning opened CD's or DVD's).",1400025600,10,2826,4.84472049689441
3038018,2,B000Z63ZKG,"Oklahoma TODD-AO has been beautifully Remastered. As nice as The Sound of Music Blu-ray. State Fair looks like a poor quality DVD as the Technicolor image is nowhere to be seen. The 60th Anniversary DVD is so much better quality (there's Technicolor) than this Blu-ray. Carousel is a dark and dowdy print. It is Deluxe color which has not been color corrected. The Sound of Music is good which was previously restored. As too with South Pacific, maybe the Colored sequences should have been restored with today's technology or even removed entirely?
I believe 20th Century Fox needs to properly Remaster State Fair, Carousel, The King and I again. These are true Film treasures which need to be fully restored. I have longed for these Films to be restored and released for such a long time. I purchased 2 copies, one for myself and the other for a gift. I cannot give second one as a present now, due to what hasn't been done to these Films. 20th Century Fox, please take a look at the Turner Entertainment (Warner Bros.-MGM) Films available, and see what they have been doing to their Libraries for 20 years plus.

3038019,4,B000Z63ZKG,"Thanks to 20th Century Fox for compiling such a wonderful number of classic film musicals on BluRay. We watched them on a JVC DLA front projector on a 3metre screen and overall the picture quality is very good to superb. Not sure why there is harsh criticism in other posts on this site about the King and I colour problem since we got a very good picture quality in the Cinemascope 55 transfer  there was no major colour problem we could detect. If any it was only slight, variable but  and not all that distracting consistent with the original negative. Sure, the clarity can vary in long to close focus but that is substantially due to the limitations of the Cinemascope 55 format (55mm film size) compared to the much better clarity of TODD-AO (70mm film size). Carousel is also a Cinemascope 55 transfer and of good quality but obviously does not match TODD-AO clarity. The RH collection includes a TODD-AO version and an original standard Cinemascope (35mm) version of Oklahoma. Thankfully due to Mike Todds foresight his TODD-AO 70mm film format and the BluRay disc transfer of it are leaps and bounds better than the standard Cinemascope BluRay disc of the same movie both in sound and picture quality. Both sound and picture quality in the TODD-AO version are excellent.

Sound of Music and South Pacific we already had the excellent Blu-Ray TODD-AO transfer versions released some time ago but the purchase of the entire compilation was worth the inclusion of the other titles in our opinion. Thanks to Amazon for making it available.",1399852800,3,1544,4.818867924528302
3038020,1,B000Z63ZKG,"This Rodgers And Hammerstein Collection is almost a waste of money, especially for those who already own SOUTH PACIFIC and SOUND OF MUSIC BD!

I bought this set specifically for OKLAHOMA! and THE KING AND I. OK, OKLAHOMA! is the newly restored but only the Todd-AO version, not the CinemaScope version. Color are vibrant and details are good! Pop in the CinemaScope version, and one would immediately see the different - color are pale! I could live with that, just treat the CinemaScope version as Bonus Features.

How about the rest? SOUTH PACIFIC and THE SOUND OF MUSIC are exactly the same as the previous BD released, but now you only get the movie disc for THE SOUND OF MUSIC! 2nd BD (and DVD if that matter to you!) with loads of Bonus Features is missing. So hold on to your previous 45th Anniversary BD released!

Now let talk about problems for the rest of the titles. STATE FAIR is, well, kind of acceptable since it is the oldest. What you didn't get is the 1962 version, which was included in the 60th Anniversary Edition DVD set. As for CAROUSEL and THE KING AND I, it's disastrous! Both are BLUE all over! Color timing are obviously wrong to the state of almost unwatchable! For example, in THE KING AND I, as Deborah Kerr arrived in Bangkok, it just blue everywhere, especially her dress and the sky. But the moment she enter the palace, it kind of turn silver, and suddenly turn back to blue after Yul Brynner introduced his children! How could they get it so wrong? What wrong with their quality control?

To me, it's a complete waste of money, even though I got it at a discount price of $73.99 from Amazon! This set will not be on my shelf, and I want my money back! For those who still considering,  forget it! This set is not worth the money!

Update:

I reviewed CAROUSEL and THE KING AND I with my THX calibrated TV again, and also compared it with both CAROUSEL and THE KING AND I 50th Anniversary DVD. Both improve a little but still appear artificially bluer then their DVD counterpart. Deborah Kerr dress still drifting between blue and silver instead of something in between, kind of greyish blue, which appear on the DVD. For me, OKLAHOME! alone is not enough to save the whole package, especially when I already have SOUTH PACIFIC and THE SOUND OF MUSIC BD. I am return it for a full refund.",1399593600,26,2322,4.501187648456057
3038021,2,B000Z63ZKG,"These are wonderful films and at this advanced state of the art in digital restoration, why is there such inconsistency of the transfers? While the HD iTunes download of ""The King and I""  approaches absolute perfection, I have to agree with all the problems in color and contrast noted in reviews for this Blu-ray disc version. Check out what was achieved on the iTunes HD ""King and I""...isn't anyone at Fox aware what others in their company are doing at the same time?

As for the ToddAO ""Oklahoma,"" the picture quality is great, but the dialogue has been compressed into what sounds like a hollow sounding tube. The CinemaScope disc of Oklahoma, with lesser picture quality, opens up the tracks a bit but does not compare with the much older sound on the Laser Disc!

""State Fair"" desperately needs treatment similar to Warner's ""ultra-process"" for restoring aging Technicolor negatives with shrinkage damage. And finally then, excluding the 1962 ""State Fair"" remake in favor of a low bit rate ToddAO version of ""South Pacific"" is a missed opportunity to make the collection more attractive to ""starved"" catalogue title buyers, eager for quality upgrades.

All would be forgiven if the restoration work had come even close to the iTunes version of King and I.",1399161600,11,1262,4.938679245283019

3038023,1,B000Z63ZKG,"Like another reviewer stated, ""Carousel"" looks awful on blu ray:  it's much too dark and the whole film looks as though it takes place at dusk.  What a great disappointment.",1398988800,16,173,4.733333333333333
3038024,3,B000Z63ZKG,"We waited a long time for the Rodgers & Hammerstein Collection to arrive on Blu Ray.  It's been several years since it was originally announced for release, then all of a sudden it was cancelled.  Now, it's finally out.  The films themselves are from some of the best Musicals ever written.  I personally believe that the ""Sound of Music"" is the best Film ever made, due to it's music, storyline, scenery, and location photography.  The film itself is far superior to it's stage production.  As far as the musicals themselves, I feel ""Carousel"" is the best of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Scores.  The film was good, but if you see a professional Stage Version, you will come to appreciate it even more. (I was fortunate enough to see Audra McDonald in the 1994 Revival at Lincoln Center.)  ""State Fair"", ""King and I"", ""South Pacific"" and ""Oklahoma"" are also wonderful.

Now, the Blu Rays themselves.  Major disappointment.  The worst treatment is ""The King and I"".  The color temperature of the film is way off.  The entire film has a heavy blue cast over it.  At times the actors skin is actually blue.  The continuity of color throughout camera angles also changes within scenes.  There was no effort to restore this movie to give it the Blu Ray presentation it deserves.  A good example is when Lady Thiang is singing ""Something Wonderful"".  She goes from Bluish to even Bluer within the song.  She could have easily been a character from ""Avatar"".  It's a shame.  These were important films during their time and were shot in CinemaScope 55.  They were produced as close to perfection as technology at that time allowed.  They are also important films to many people today and they should be preserved on Blu Ray the best possible way.  It's a crime that this film was released on Blu Ray and nobody along the way caught an extremely obvious problem.  The audio is also lifeless.

""Carousel"", another CinemaScope 55 film is flat in color, audio and contrast.  The 2006 collection on DVD looks much better.  I've even seen VHS tapes with better coloring.

""State Fair"" looks just like the DVD.  Nothing special.

""South Pacific""  and ""Sound of Music"" both are beautiful as they are the lovingly restored versions that were previously released on Blu Ray a couple years ago.

The only advantage to this set is ""Oklahoma"".  Two versions of the film were shot simultaneously.  One in Cinemascope and one in Todd AO.  Up until now, the Todd AO version was in horrible shape.  This set includes both versions.  The restored Todd AO version was recently shown at the film festival in LA.  It's stunning!  The film pops right off the screen.  The restoration is right in line with ""Sound of Music"" and ""South Pacific"".  It's sad that they didn't give ""King and I"" and Carousel"" the same treatment.

So, to sum things up.  If you already have ""Sound of Music""  and ""South Pacific"" on Blu Ray, the only good addition in this set is the Todd AO ""Oklahoma"" which is also set to be released individually in fall.  If you have the 2006 R&H DVD Collection, you already posses better looking copies of ""King and I"", ""Carousel"" and ""State Fair"".

After the long wait, you would think they had enough time to give us better quality.  They are certainly charging for it.  There is nothing on the labeling that says these films underwent restoration, but, you would think that they would have made an effort to render an improved film to Blu Ray.  Instead, you are getting 2 films (""King and I"" and ""Carousel"") that looked better when they were on videotape.",1398988800,178,3542,4.698205546492659
3038025,5,B000Z63ZKG,"I just got this set Tuesday, so I have watched STATE FAIR, OKLAHOMA, and KING AND I, so far. Unlike some reviewers I have had no problem with color, sound or brightness in those three. I have a Sony player and a large flat screen. Oklahoma is so beautiful, I could watch it just for the scenery behind the actors. King and I (my personal favorite) is absolutely gorgeous. State Fair doesn't hit the high standard of the others as a movie, but takes us back to the 40's musicals and is a sunnier take on life than the others. Though I agree with other reviewers that I would rather had Flower Drum Song in this package. South Pacific always loses me with the color filters which I find distracting. Sound of Music and Carousel, while I love the music, the former I have seen too many times and the latter is my least favorite, not because of the music, but because of the sadness of the story. I had most of these already which I sold on amazon and I got in on the beginning deal, so that I got this set for about $7.00 a disc. I would have paid the full price if I just gotten the King and I all by itself on blu. What a bargain!! Hours of beautiful music, beautiful sets and costumes, wonderful singing and dancing.

3038027,3,B000Z63ZKG,"Looks like my reaction to these new transfers is quite different from the general run of comments on Amazon since this set came out a few days ago. Apart from the incredible restoration of the ""Todd-A-O Oklahoma!"" which is of demonstration quality and should not be undervalued, the other new transfers, especially ""The King and I"" ""Carousel"" and ""State Fair"" are, in my opinion, just dead wrong in terms of color, brightness and contrast. Yes, resolution is better, especially in the case of  ""State Fair,"" but much of this movie is too dark. Instead of a cheery musical, we are given a sombre melodrama. Take a look at Margy's first entrance at her window and as she turns to go into her room. So much of the image disappears in shadow, and her lovely dress looks more like a dish towel.

""The King and I"" has some terrific flashes of proper color, but much of it is too dark (again) with an odd blue tinge that flattens the contrast. When it isn't blue, it is at times a burnished yellow-copper that means well but, because of the brightness level, the king especially sometimes looks like he just stepped out of a mudbath. And look what happens to Irene Sharaf's fabulous costumes when you make the darker aspects darker still. Note how the subtle uniqueness of each of the costumes of the king's wives is wasted into shadow when they gather about Anna to check out her dress. Elsewhere, we see that all the jewelry glistens but we can't quite make out how any of it set into the costume or headgear. The transfer isn't always wrong in this respect. ""The March of the Siamese Children"" is close to perfect - lots of light with good color balance - which makes me wonder why so many other scenes are dialed down the way they are.

Please don't get me wrong - there is plenty to admire even in the darkness. ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" surely the visual high point of the film, sustains some wonderful colors despite the subdued light - and the high-def imagery makes for exquisite movement: the rainstorm during Eliza's escape is stunning.

Also, here, as in all the new movies, the audio comes with considerably improved dynamics and clarity, at times revealing faults with the original mix, as with Yul Brynner's first ""Who, who, who?"" that just blows us out of the room, it's so disproportionally loud. Elsewhere, as in ""Shall We Dance,"" there is a power and majesty completely in accord with the subject.

This is a flawed set: On the one hand we have the miracle of ""Oklahoma! in Todd-A-O,"" for which, frankly, I had the lowest of expectations, and on the other, an entirely wrong-headed idea of what some of these musicals should look like on a proper home theater presentation. In my opinion, the most recent DVDs of ""The King and I"" and ""State Fair"" are considerably better - possibly, more accurate, certainly more pleasing and more consistent - in terms of color, brightness and contrast than the new Blu-rays, where Fox has turned glorious Technicolor into generic video. The Blu-rays all have much improved sound and superior resolution as compared to their DVD counterparts, but only ""Oklahoma! in Todd-A-O"" hits it out of the park.",1398902400,233,3141,4.682971014492754
3038028,5,B000Z63ZKG,"As usual, I already have the DVD versions of these films and in a few cases two or three DVD versions.  In any case, the work that was put in to get the TODD/AO version of OKLAHOMA is nothing less than a miracle.  There is NO COMPARISON between the TODD/AO version that came in the last DVD set and this Blu-ray.  I just can't put in words how good it looks.  When they talk about 30 fps projection, this is the granddaddy.

The other two films Carousel and The King and I, were both filmed in Cinemascope 55.  While they are excellent transfers (with the exception of a few  very minor flaws), they certainly can't be compared to the 30fps version of Oklahoma, but are Blu-ray versions that stand on their own and I think we're lucky that they could still be made looking so good.

As for South Pacific, I didn't watch that yet because I already have the single Blu-ray that came out.  I only wish that the TODD/AO version of South Pacific could be made to look as good as the OKLAHOMA TODD/AO version now does.  And last but not least is The Sound of Music, which I also didn't watch.

3038035,4,B000Z63ZKG,"If you love the Musicals of Rodgers and Hammerstein then you should know that the six films represented in this set look and sound better than I have ever seen them on home video. So why should you consider holding off on buying the set? Frankly, it's the price. I was lucky enough to get my order in when it was being sold for under $80. For that price, I feel as if I've gotten my money's worth. Had I paid $179 I would have been sorely disappointed.

It all comes down to the supplements. Studios these days are reticent to spend any money on supplemental features, especially on catalog films. All of the supplements on this set could already be found on previous DVD releases or, in the case of The Sound of Music and South Pacific, on the Blu-ray releases. Don't misunderstand me: these are quality supplements geared toward film lovers. They are also plentiful, with one exception I'll get to farther along in the review. The are sadly all in Standard Definition, however. That wouldn't bother me so much except that some of them, like the Todd-AO shorts or the feature film Liliom (the basis for Carousel), could really benefit from an HD transfer.

Which brings me to the two things that are deal-breakers, as far as I'm concerned. First, the South Pacific discs are exactly the same as the previously-released version. That means that the Roadshow version of the film is still in SD. Very disappointing. Secondly, The Sound of Music is only the first disc from the previously-released Blu-ray set. That means that the most popular film in the set is missing nearly all of the supplements from that set. It's bare-bones except for commentary tracks. For what they are charging, Fox should have included the second disc. There is absolutely no excuse for not doing so. (Edit: The second disc from the previous State Fair DVD release is also not in this package. That disc included the largely derided 1962 version of the film and a brief Mary Martin performance. Not a huge loss, but it may be an issue for some people.)

At the time of release of this set, it's the only way to get four of the films on Blu-ray in the US. I don't expect that to be the case for long. If you're patient, it's likely that you'll be able to purchase these films on their own for far-less than the cost of purchasing them together in this set.

However, I feel insulted by the abrupt price change and will wait until they dismember the set and sell each individual film for 5.99 (trust me, it will happen sooner than later).

3272331,5,B000Z63ZKG,"These are movie adaptations of classic Broadway shows that stand the test of time. Five of them are unquestionably the greatest of all the Rogers and Hammerstein musicals: ""Oklahoma!"" (staged 1943, filmed 1955), ""Carousel"" (staged 1945, filmed 1956), ""South Pacific"" (staged 1949, film 1958), ""The King and I"" (staged 1951, filmed 1956), and ""The Sound of Music"" (staged 1959, filmed 1965). ""State Fair,"" a minor work, originated as a film and was actually the first to be produced; released in 1945 and remade in 1962, it wasn't staged until 1996. All told, these six films earned 15 Academy Awards.

Extraordinary successes on Broadway and in cinemas, the shows were popular with audiences and critics alike for their magical melodies, strong characters, sweeping storylines, peerless pageantry, and fearless confrontation with social issues, including domestic violence and tragic death, racism and fascism. Not everything the composer and librettist touched was golden, however. The duo collaborated on five other, lesser theatrical productions: ""Allegro"" (1947), ""Me and Juliet"" (1953), ""Pipe Dream"" (1955), ""Cinderella"" (televised 1957, staged 1958), and ""Flower Drum Song"" (staged 1958, filmed 1961), but only the latter was shown in cinemas to less-than-rapturous reviews, and it is not included in this set as it was a production of Universal rather than 20th Century Fox.

This collection was originally issued on 12 DVDs in 2006, but the new 8-Blu-ray box contains sparkling high-definition prints of the films together with all of the voluminous supplementary materials, in standard definition, that were included on the earlier release: many hours of featurettes both vintage and new, audio commentaries (leading lady Shirley Jones charms on both ""Oklahoma"" and ""Carousel""), sing-along subtitles, song-only options, excerpts from a 1954 TV tribute, photo galleries, newsreels, and trailers. And there is much, much more!

For instance, the ""State Fair"" disc adds a rare television series pilot. ""Oklahoma"" is presented in two formats, CinemaScope and the vastly superior Todd-AO. ""Carousel"" is supplemented with deleted songs and the complete film of the play on which it was based, ""Liliom,"" starring Charles Boyer and directed by Fritz Lang. ""South Pacific"" has two editions, the two-and-a-half-hour theatrical release and the three-hour extended version (though the latter is not HD). You also get Mitzi Gaynor's screen test and a 1986 ""60 Minutes"" segment in which Diane Sawyer accompanies author James Michener back to the islands where ""Tales of the South Pacific"" had its genesis. ""The King and I"" features the television series pilot for ""Anna and the King"" and a clip of Yul Brynner accepting his Academy Award for Best Actor.

""The Sound of Music"" disc is the most packed with delights, as befits one of the world's most-lauded musicals and the winner of the Best Picture Oscar. These bonuses include special introductions by Julie Andrews for the 40th anniversary edition and full-length commentaries by Andrews, costar Christopher Plummer, and director Robert Wise. There are over two hours of documentaries and happy reminiscences by the entire cast, intercut with scenes from the movie and behind-the-scenes video, as well as an episode of A&E's ""Biography"" series about the real-life Family von Trapp, plus a brief screen test of a singing and dancing Mia Farrow, who was considered for the role of Liesl.

If these films are as dear to your heart as they are to mine, you really ought to consider splurging on this set. Admittedly, an MSRP of $200 is far too high, but since the box was initially offered at $80, you can be sure the price will come down in time.",1396051200,19,3691,5.281090289608177
3272332,2,B000Z63ZKG,"Can't really write a review on the product until it's released, but I see no mention of extras.

The films are mostly classics, though, and deserve the blu-ray treatment.  I give the four-star rating based on the films, not the product.  The rating may increase if the extras carry over; and we'll have to wait and see the improvements to the picture and sound quality.

Update to above:  The Digital Bits has information about the ""official press release"" relating to this product.  It states, ""Bonus materials include a Sing-A-Long version of The King and I for die-hard musical theatre lovers and more than an hour of behind-the-scenes features for Oklahoma!.""
Wow - the individual DVDs have a TON of extras.  With the amount of space available on a Blue-Ray disc, there's no reason not to include some/most of those extras.  So, missing are such extras as the feature film ""Liliom,"" various documentaries and featurettes, performances from the theater casts; not to mention no indication of any of the extras already included in the ""The Sound of Music"" Blue-Ray.  I think ""die-hard musical theatre lovers"" would prefer deleted material from the films rather than a ""Sing-A-Long"" version of ""The King and I.""

And especially gratifying, is the long overdue hoped for ultimate picture and sound  editions of OKLAHOMA!, CAROUSEL and THE KING AND I.

But what a missed opportunity that the 1962 version of STATE FAIR has been overlooked for BluRay.

The 1945 version of STATE FAIR is certainly not a minor film but is also a true classic like the others - and the original TECHNICOLOR for that one alone will be worth a good portion the price of the actual collection.

Ross Hunter's wonderful 1961 production of FLOWER DRUM SONG received a brilliant earlier release on Standard DVD by Universal, and should also be part of every collector's library.

And to be fair (no pun intended), the 1962 version of STATE FAIR was available, together with the 1945 version as a very fine quality standard DVD double set, during 2005.

The new Fox Collection will be the BIG hit of 2014.

3272336,5,B000Z63ZKG,"The new price posted of less than $80 for all eight discs (six movies) makes this a fantastic bargain.
I don't live in America, but I believe the legacy of the great Broadway and Hollywood musicals which America has given us are one of the outstanding redeeming features of the barbaric 20th Century. And along with Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, Lorenz Hart and all the others, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II were lustrous adornments to their craft.
The existing blu rays of South Pacific and The Sound of Music show what care Fox has lavished upon the restoration of these classics; they are both demonstration-quality discs of the highest order. Now they are joined by my two favourite Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, Carousel and Oklahoma, with The King and I and State Fair thrown in for good measure.
As a special treat, we are being given two versions of Oklahoma .. the version shot for the Todd-AO widescreen cinema chain, and the version shot for conventional Cinemascope theatres .. two separate movies had to be made as it was not possible to convert one negative into two very different formats -- and the two are quite different in performance and staging. I'll be watching both versions very often and hope you do to.
I hope this Fox release serves as an incentive to others .. especially Warners, whose release of a Blu ray box set of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers is way overdue!",1395532800,47,1419,4.748987854251012

The previously released South Pacific and The Sound of Music are flawless. Oklahoma! has a mostly perfect picture except for an important day-for-night scene that is mis-timed; the Oklahoma! sound is disputed. Carousel is overly dark and too blue, but watchable with some adjustments to your equipment. Unhappily, The King and I is colored in teal and is unwatchable. Fox has missed an opportunity for repeats of their great success with South Pacific. If you love the films as much as I do, buy it anyway, otherwise wait for someone at Fox to order this fixed.

3272419,4,B000Z63ZKG,"I bought this set specifically to get the Todd-A-O version of Oklahoma. At the time it was only available in this set and for a reasonable price it gave me the opportunity to watch several other classic movies that I have never seen, or only seen on a picture tube TV decimated by late night car commercials.

However this review is for the purchased product, the entire set. In a nutshell, the films rate a 5 as genuine classics, produced in a way that will never be repeated. The enjoyment of being able to watch them full-length at home on a modern flat-screen TV is easily worth a 5.

On the other hand, the transfers range from bad to really bad. No it can't be expected that any of these movies would or could look as good as when they were projected on the silver screen from the original release prints, but with a few of the movies the image and sound quality are so bad it make it difficult to watch the film. Colors wander all over the place, the sound volume goes up and down, and dialogue is sometimes unintelligible. This is a set to own for content only, to be able to watch a classic movie at home. None of them will please a movie connoisseur. But is that a reasonable expectation? That's something that's up to the buyer to decide.

The hardest to watch is South Pacific because the original producer had this thing about dissolving to weird colors every time a character burst into song. The modern transfer to DVD process just didn't seem to be able to handle that and made what was originally an unusual effect into something that seems to be drug induced. I found myself closing my eyes so I could enjoy listening to the song without having to watch the shifting colors.

Straying from the review for a second ... movie reviews at Amazon are the least credible of any review for any product. Are people reviewing a movie that was made 30 years ago because they don't like the story line? Will that make the slightest difference in a movie that's already made? Or are they reviewing the technical quality of the film-to-disc transfer? Regardless of digital technical restoration ""miracles"" there's no way an old movie being played on their TV will ever look like a shot-to-digital current theatrical release. In one instance of the ridiculous, as this is being written on Sept 4, 2014, one of these films - the digitally remastered Todd-A-O version of Oklahoma which won't be sold until October 7, 2014 already has 325 reviews under it, many complaining how bad the color and sound are. Duh! That's because they're reviewing an old version of that movie! So, hint, if you like classic old movies just buy them in whatever format is cheapest and enjoy them for what they are. Some things just can't be made better with a ""new coat of paint"".

Final rating - a tough call. Certainly a 5 on content. While it would be tempting to rate it a 1 on technical quality, that's not exactly fair for the reason described above. I would say overall for all of the discs the technical quality is about what should be expected from such old movies, hence an average 3, bringing the overall rating to 4-stars.",1409788800,,3115,4.525754884547069

3272447,4,B000Z63ZKG,"A Fantastic Transfer better then never, with a bad example (STATE FAIR- fuzzy and dark)

When I realize that at last it should be possible to see OKLAHOMA TODD-AO 30 frames/second version I never thought that the final result was so good. What can mean a marketing trick is not less that the best example of BD until now published.  IT IS A MIRACLE! I've been some years ago in Bradford and I see a good copy TODD-AO 30fps but nothing compared with this. I've seen the BD in a screen of 12m x 5,5m and the result was better that the original in film projection in Bradford.

But the good news goes to all the other realeases with the exepcion of STATE FAIR. My copy in DVD is better, more clear and clean. Is really a poor transfer. The King and I very good also. To those that are protesting to the blue efects in the film, they do not have in mind the original color in Cinemascope 55. Do not forget that the author of the image is Leon Shamroy , the same of the South Pacific controversial filters. I ve never seen THE KING ANd I so brilliant and so focused, and of course as the original was, very blue. SOUND OF MUSIC  and SOUTH PACIFIC are not news in BD for me. Both, first rate.

CAROUSEL was the weakest transfer of the good ones but, I insist the original was grainy and many times dark. The definition is very good but cannot be surpass the original. And pay atention that in Cinemascope 55 they have produced only 2 films. It is because exists one reason to that.

Of course that the pack's original price was ridiculous and I profit the promotional price of $50 USD, some weeks ago. Now is 75 bucks but  is now a much better price.

The edition as the problem of no  inclusion the name of the extras in each BD (that are many) nor in back cover, nor  inside.  That point is the most remarkable mistake of this new pack. All in all 4 stars (6 to Oklahoma!) (5 to Sound of Music and South Pacific) (4 stars for  KING AND I  and CAROUSEL and the extras of South Pacific Road Show version (The Miracle of TODD-AO was not a good restoration does not reflect 100% of the original ratio and with a notable bad Syncronization of the sound track vs image).

Only as a Ugly Duck we have STATE FAIR (1946) transfer. It is a Ugly Duck that never will appear as a Swan!  The only possibility is to include the old DVD in the pack. Yes is better that the BD version and of course It is not a Swan, but at least is not a ugly one anymore.

Carousel- Impressed with the Blu ray, especially the Maine locales, studio shots, slightly  dark at times, excellent blu ray  ****  stars

State Fair- Excellent blu ray, especially since the negative was destroyed years ago  **** stars

The only blu ray I have ever watched  where the dress of a leading lady changes hues, from grey to blue, then back to grey, then blue again  from scene  to scene,  but it's razor sharp.

So, I will try to explain why I gave this collection 5 stars Simply put, it is because my wife and I enjoyed watching these movies. These movies reminded us of our youth and listening to the songs we used to hear and sing was a distinct pleasure. As many have pointed out these films are far from perfection. Some of the colors are really off the wall and some, like the better of the two ""Oklahoma"" versions, are excellent. We saw no problem with the colors in ""The Sound of Music"". ""State Fair"" was not all that bad either.

The five stars are based purely on the enjoyment provided by Gordon MacRae, Shirley Jones Deborah Kerr, Rita Moreno, Mitzi Gaynor, Julie Andrew and many other talented individuals. It would be easy to go through the various films and nitpick the  shortcomings that are plainly visible. But, as already mentioned, this review is based on the many hours of enjoyment that were made possible by these amazing performers, many of whom are no longer with us. Some improvements of the video quality could be achieved by using the TV adjustments. However, watching and listening to Julie Andrews in ""The Sound of Music"" is in itself worth the price of this collection. If you are a ""mature"" or a ""senior"" individual just slip in one of the discs, sit back and relax, don't sweat the small stuff and remember the good old days when you first heard these songs while you enjoy hearing them again..",1406246400,,1530,4.5398550724637685

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Most modern pop music, including the music for most newest Broadway shows, shows a painful lack of something that America once created in enormous quantities, especially melodies. Although the generation that most loved the Rodgers & Hammerstein musicals, is well on its way to passing onto new generations who love these types of musicals and the popularity of those shows is still very strong. As a child of the 1950s, I can attest to the fact that the music of all the shows in 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment's new Blu-ray set The Rodgers & Hammerstein Collection all became a part of our DNA film experience. Across the years families collected 45 rpm record sets, Long Playing Albums and eventually various video formats, including Betamax, VHS, LaserDisc and DVD of these films. They were core family viewing, and I can remember my mother's pleased reaction to our 'shared experience' with them.

The 6 picture set are State Fair; Oklahoma!; Carousel; The King & I; South Pacific and The Sound of Music. Only two have had previous Blu-ray releases; these are presented with the same awesome brilliant transfers, but not all of the same extras.

STATE FAIR was released by 20th Century Fox in a 60th Anniversary Edition DVD in 2005. Although not one of the 'super-productions' that would follow a decade later, State Fair is a sweet, quaint musical of a novel previously produced as a non-musical film in 1933. Fox gave it the full Technicolor treatment, along with the top singing talent Dick Haymes and Vivian Blaine. Jeanne Crain and Dana Andrews are dubbed. Curiously, Dana Andrews began his show business career as a singer but repeatedly declined to sing, as he wanted to be regarded as a serious actor only. After all, Dick Powell had recently succeeded in switching from crooning to straight drama; going the other way was not considered a smart career move.

The 1080p transfer is in great shape and has that candy-colour look of 20th Century Fox musicals of the 1940s. It isn't as sharp as one might expect, but there's definitely more detail present than on the older DVD. The mono audio is strong, if obviously not as dynamic as that on the newer pictures. The songs ""It Might as Well Be Spring"" and Its a Grand Night for Singing"" made the biggest impact with this viewer. The attractive Jeanne Crain and Dana Andrews are plunked down in the middle of a storyline that relentlessly celebrates the joys of rural life. Sorry, but most Iowans people all went to the big city like everyone else.

STATE FAIR has the fewest extras. All of the titles offer the viewer four ways to watch the film. One can play the picture straight through or play it in ""Music Machine"" mode, which skips from song highlight to song highlight. There's also the ""Sing Along"" mode, which adds lyric subtitles to the songs. Finally, ""Play the whole Film with Sing Along"" is self-explanatory.

Between the commentaries and the extras on the discs, one can get a solid, and sometimes fairly critical, overview of their origins in books or the stage and the way the films came together. The commentary on State Fair is by authors Richard Barrios and Tom Briggs. The half-hour documentary From Page to Screen to Stage charts the musical's 'backwards' genesis and it was a movie musical first before being adapted to the stage. Each disc also contains a wealth of visual extras in Still Galleries: often broken down into categories of ad art, behind-the-scenes stills and production stills showing sets, costumes, etc. The one thing missing here that was included on the DVD presentation is the 1962 State Fair remake with Pat Boone and Ann-Margret. It's nobody's idea of a good film, from any angle... but it did have Bobby Darin, and that's kind of fun isn't it.

OKLAHOMA! tends to drags at times and some of the direction is dull, but many of the musical sequences are brilliantly done. The main central ballet motivated by Shirley Jones' song ""Out of My Dreams"" is a marvellous mix of great choreography, staging and direction and its stylised painted sky backdrops look like something from the Japanese film Kwaidan. Song for song, Oklahoma! has possibly the most memorable music of the features in this set. Seen in a good presentation, it's a powerful show.

Mike Todd pulled out of Cinerama and made Oklahoma! as what was to be the first film of a Road Show feature empire. The film invented its own Todd-AO (American Optical) film format. The process and the movie were practically developed together. 65mm wide and five perforations, Todd-AO also ran at 30 frames per second, to cut down on strobing, flicker and 'chatter' during on-screen motion. Todd-AO could not be adapted for normal 24fps theatre use, so Mike Todd was forced to simultaneously film a second standard CinemaScope version of the film. That second version is what had been seen almost exclusively since the late 1950s.

The biggest news of this new Blu-ray set is that the 30-frame Todd-AO version of Oklahoma! is back, this time looking and sounding sensational. The 2005 DVD was something of a disaster for Rogers & Hammerstein fans. It contained both versions, but the Todd-A0 transfer was of awful quality, blurry and diffuse, it looked a mess. Now, ten years later, scanners are so safe that the original negative for Oklahoma! could be scanned, and the result is totally magnificent.

The Todd-AO version was reportedly filmed first and its cameras occupied the best positions. It has been suggested that the quality of the daylight looks better and some of the performances seem fresher in the Todd-AO version, too. The cutting and framing differs between versions, and the Todd-AO cut is eight minutes longer. This disc may be the deal-maker that sells a lot of these boxed sets, although I must add that a stand-alone Oklahoma! is rumoured to be out sometime in the near future. The Todd-AO and CinemaScope versions occupy separate discs. The CinemaScope version looks good too, but is nowhere near as impressive as the Todd-AO version. Both versions have excellent multi-track audio, and the Todd-AO listed as a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound track.

Beyond the four playback options and galleries and trailers, Oklahoma! is graced with two commentaries, one by Shirley Jones and one by Nick Redman; Ted Chapin and Hugh Fordin. There is a Documentary comparing the two format versions, and the development of Todd-AO. Culled from a 1950s TV show are two song excerpts from the show, sung by Gordon MacRae and wait for it, Florence Henderson and is really very good!

Brilliant master producer Mike Todd pulled together resources that historically didn't mesh well with Hollywood, Broadway and the research/technical industry. For a year or so it seemed possible that the 'new' Hollywood might convert to Todd-AO for road shows, with a change to 30fps becoming normal even for standard films. As it happened, the industry would instead slowly lose interest in an expensive 65mm 'big pictures.'

CAROUSEL was also released in 1955. As every studio wanted its own proprietary format, Fox came up with a king-sized CinemaScope system called CinemaScope 55, using an enormous negative withan anamorphic squeeze identical to standard 35mm CinemaScope. When the executives saw the improved quality of print-downs to 35mm CinemaScope, they abandoned plans for large-format projection, just as Paramount had with their own proprietary VistaVision. Carousel and The King and I were the only films shot in CinemaScope 55.

Carousel is the most problematic of the Rogers & Hammerstein features. Although it has some of the series' most beautiful songs, it is the least original and the least exciting visually. The repeat casting of Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRae might seem a quickie follow-up to the previous show, but in actuality, Frank Sinatra walked off the film set when he discovered that he'd have to shoot all of his scenes twice for the CinemaScope 55 and the 35mm version (The 35mm version was abandoned during filming). Director Henry King seems defeated by a production that wastes beautiful New England locations by using them as static backdrops. Not helping are uninspired sets back in Hollywood sound stages that often simply look cheap. After an uninspiring prologue in a smoke and glass 'heaven,' the first earthbound scene is a marvellous, more or less dialogue-free story setup that brings together innocent factory girl Julie Jordan [Shirley Jones] and carousel barker Billy Bigelow [Gordon MacRae]. Billy Bigelow's boss Mrs. Mullin [Audrey Christie] insults Julie and fires Billy Bigelow over a flirting incident, while the marvellous main ""Carousel Waltz"" theme reinforces the notion that an unquenchable love has been ignited.

From that point forward Carousel is directed as if on remote control, with barely a thought given to anything beyond setting up of the great songs. The plotline slogs along like a can kicked down the road. It's best to concentrate on the quality of the musical arrangements and their delivery by the capable cast. Julie loses her job as well, marries Billy Bigelow and becomes pregnant. Egged on by his thuggish false friend Jigger Craigin [Cameron Mitchell], the chronically irresponsible Billy Bigelow goes through with a stupid robbery. Tragedy ensues. Sixteen years later in heaven, a miracle allows Billy Bigelow to return briefly to Earth to try to do one good thing for the daughter he never knew. The ending is a bittersweet tearjerker that verges on the slightly maudlin effect. Although Billy Bigelow barely showed his love for Julie Jordan, their problem seems to have been only a matter of bad communication. He's really a softie enchanted by the idea of having a child. One idea carried over from the source play, is that wife beating can be a matter of ""hits that don't hurt."" In this context, it's a painfully dated embarrassment not likely to be appreciated by activists against domestic violence. I can imagine the horror of a battered wife who sought some psychic relief and chose to attend a 1955 matinee of Carousel. Although Billy Bigelow and Julie Jordan's life is one big mess up, but the message is, that it's okay because ""You'll Never Walk Alone.""

Prominent among the extras for Carousel is a carryover from the NTSC DVD Special Edition, especially the film Liliom [1934] directed by Fritz Lang. It's the French film Fritz Lang made after his escape from Nazi Germany, en route to Hollywood. This non-musical version of Ferenc Moln&aacute;r's play is to Carousel what Pygmalion is to My Fair Lady a total revelation. The film Liliom in this extra; is in the 480i encoded on this Blu-ray, and is far better that the NTSC DVD extra.

Due both to the needs of Broadway musicals and American entertainment in general, Carousel all but emasculates the original Liliom fim, which added a lot more satirical messages about class injustice to its story of a brutal relationship. In the film, we find Liliom (a young Charles Boyer) is much less romanticised heel, and is indeed bad news for Julie [Madeleine Ozeray]. They never marry. He refuses to work and they live in poverty; the fact that she accepts his abuse makes him so ashamed that he hits her. He's soon pretending that he doesn't care, when he's actually crippled by self-loathing. There is no 'wholesome' alternative couple; instead the carousel operator Mrs. Muscat cruelly tries to lure Liliom back, right in Julie's presence. Carousel eliminates a suicide and softens heaven into a quaint stellar waiting room. In Liliom our ignoble hero finds that heaven has a double standard just like on Earth. The wealthy dead get special treatment while he's forced to cool his heels. Instead of returning to a purgatory of star-polishing duty, Liliom's failed mission on Earth will result in an eternity spent in flames. The finale in the Fritz Lang film sees Julie finally being able to express her forbidden love (yes, complete with the un-PC idea of 'hits' that feel like kisses) and sheds a tear that shifts the heavenly balance in favour of the misunderstood rogue Liliom.

The Fritz Lang's film is incredibly well directed, and has a depth of detail and atmosphere not found in the musical remake. As befits a French film untouched by the Hollywood Production Code, the show features some near-nudity. When Liliom is granted a kiss from Julie on a park bench, he proceeds to caress her breast. Moln&aacute;r's play surely influenced Fritz Lang's film Destiny [1921], with its story of a love that can alter the course of the stars. The black-clad emissaries that escorts Liliom to heaven, are also echoed in Jean Cocteau's mysterious art film Orpheus.

With the opening of the film Carousel where the carousel scene is staged on a much smaller scale than the old French film Liliom and the location shooting often lacks an even basic pictorial sense. Louise Bigelow's big ballet scene is staged on a tiny set, and without any of the dramatic lighting scheme that was so effective in Oklahoma! The 4.0 stereo audio track reproduces the directional stereo feel of the original film. In addition to the feature Liliom, the four playback choices and still galleries, the extras for Carousel include a trailer, a newsreel and a making-of documentary. Two deleted songs are heard as audio extras, illustrated with photos. And a TV excerpt has two more song presentations, sung by Mary Martin, John Raitt and Jan Clayton. An Isolated music score is present. The full commentary with Shirley Jones and a well-informed Nick Redman brings forth some interesting questions and answers, instead of the usual interview vacuous fluff.

THE KING & I [1956] is the second and last CinemaScope 55 film and was a massive success whose fame has burned bright for half a century. This time the solid source material was didn't need sanitizing either for the stage or screen; as seen in the popular Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison picture Anna and the King of Siam, the hints of a hot 'n' heavy romance between an English schoolteacher and an Indo-Chinese King remain in the censor-safe theoretical stage.

The story is sound in all departments and the proud Anna Leonowens [Deborah Kerr] and her son have a rough time adjusting to work teaching the many children of King Mongkut of Siam [Yul Brynner]. Although a lively personality, the King's deeply rooted convictions place everyone under his paternal tyranny. Women are chattel and Anna's educated foreigner is only partly an exception. The friendship between sovereign and teacher grows until, in a private meeting in a vast royal reception room, she teaches him to dance the Polka. The major subplot sees Mongkut cruelly separating and punishing two of his 'possessions'. Tuptim [Rita Moreno] is one of his wives, gifted to him by another monarch. Lun Tha [Carlos Rivas] is a worker who brought Tuptim to Siam. They fall in love but under Mongkut's system of bondage have no rights. Anna tries to diplomatically leverage Mongkut's affections to help Tuptim, and to this end stages a Siamese version of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" as the royal entertainment.

Except for some palace exteriors and a street scene The King & I is entirely stage-bound, which is no disadvantage at all thanks to the marvellous sumptuous designs of John DeCuir. The fact that the vision of Siam is a dated stage construction also means little, as what we see is so visually pleasing. The design really comes forward in the bravura ""The Small House of Uncle Thomas"" ballet, where costumes and masks convert Harriet Beecher Stowe's drama into a Siamese fable. As the representative of Western decorum, Anna glides through scenes in giant skirts that disguise the fact that she has legs. The contrast with the sensually costumed Eastern women couldn't be greater.

Yul Brynner dominates the film in the role that both made and capped his career; he'd be performing The King & I stage productions off and on until his death decades later. As for Anna, if Irene Dunne hadn't been too aged for the part she could have performed Anna and sung for her too, instead of being dubbed by Marni Nixon as was Deborah Kerr. Refined, opulent and romantic, but minus messy sex complications. Deborah Kerr's Anna is the one that's remembered, and the role that most types her career. She and Yul Brynner were considered such a hot pairing that M-G-M quickly reunited them in the Cold War thriller The Journey.

As with Carousel, the transfer of The King & I has some odd colour choices. Most scenes are dazzlingly good, especially the Uncle Thomas ballet, but a great many moments look too blue. We understand seeing a blue tinge in night scenes or the stage performance, but normal close-ups of Deborah Kerr will suddenly turn bluish, even in the middle of a scene. It can only be attributed to the condition of the elements. The 4.0 stereo audio has no deficiencies. Mixed much like Carousel, voices and sound effects come across as directional, appropriate for a classic 1950s stereo sound mix.

With the Audio Commentary, Michael Portantiere and Richard Barrios contribute the informed and lively commentary for The King & I, and another track contains a two-channel stereophonic Isolated music score. Five documentaries cover the history of the film and play, the story of the stage version, a quick look at Darryl Zanuck's promotions for CinemaScope, the genesis of the music and a ten-minute overview of the creative teaming of Rodgers and Hammerstein.

One of the other Special Features is a half-hour pilot, which is present for an Anna and the King TV show, with a commentary by its Anna, Samantha Eggar. An extra audio song is present, plus TV excerpts from the stage version with Patricia Morison and Yul Brynner. Roughly ten minutes of The King & I related newsreels are offered as well. Finally, a restoration extra gives us an idea of the huge volume of work required to re-master The King & I from original CinemaScope 55 materials.

This brings us to another Rogers & Hammerstein film musical in which the screen purposely changes colours, and that is South Pacific [1958]. Another huge success, the film had to wait out a particularly lengthy Broadway run so that the film version could be made. The two discs included in this new set are identical to the earlier release. We're still impressed that 20th Century Fox went to the trouble to reconstruct the film's much longer version by fifteen minutes with the Road Show version. Even though the sound quality isn't as rich and the added footage is pale and faded and it's presumably a surviving positive print, which we are grateful to see the extra story detail and additional scenes.

Some people are still not sure about the film's colour experiment, which still seems to attempt to visually suggest moods normally achieved through sensitive direction, but I really love it. But some of the tints work well, especially when the colour-wheel seams don't show. The ever-changing mystery matte paintings of the fantasy island Bali Hai look even better when cast in different hues. But Joshua Logan's overall direction is numbingly flat, letting his locations and the stage-like blocking do all the work.

South Pacific is billed as filmed in Todd-AO, but this time the 30 frames-per-second film speed was dropped, leaving Oklahoma! and Around the World in 80 Days as the only other films shot in the original Todd-AO format. According to author-authorities Carr and Hayes, the cameras actually used were Panavision lenses, which mean that the film is really a standard 65mm production. This was the biggest Rogers & Hammerstein hit of all time, and one of the most popular films of the 1960s and a triumph for director-producer Robert Wise, The Sound of Music was restored several years ago after a complex 8K scan job, and released as a 45th Anniversary Special Edition Blu-ray.

The transfer is worth a little discussion of its own. Four years ago at an industry film restoration convention in America, Fox treated the attendees and lucky hangers-on to a rare comparison test. In the Linwood Dunn Theater at the Academy's facility on Vine Street, they first projected a reel from The Sound of Music in restored 70mm. It's difficult to believe that any video could possibly approach the detail and clarity of the 70mm that the people viewed; the only other film that people compare to this film is the more impressive big format was David Lean's Ryan's Daughter. Then they put up an uncompressed 4K theatrical video projection master of the same The Sound of Music scene.

On this Blu-ray disc The Sound of Music looks absolutely marvellous, with the resolution just good enough to convey the eye-popping clarity remembered from theatrical screenings. The colour throughout is very accurate. The extras for The Sound of Music lead off with an interactive picture-in-picture feature that looks to have been very costly. It puts a choice of several trivia-track choices on the screen, or all of them at once if you so wish. One is a karaoke feature. It all sounds like a perfect arrangement for viewers incapable of doing one thing at a time.

With the Audio Commentary, Robert Wise contributes one commentary, and a second track gathers statements from Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, who was a good sport, despite his put-downs of the film over the years. Charmian Carr, who was the choreographer for Dee Dee Wood and Johannes von Trapp. Like the other titles, this disc also contains the four viewing modes like ""music machine"" and ""sing along."" Accessed through the web is a four-minute piece with Laura Benanti, an actress in a recent Broadway revival of the show.

Finally, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment's Blu-ray of The Rodgers & Hammerstein Collection is totally awesome and is also one of those monster sets that a number of years ago would come in a gift box not likely to fit on the average bookshelf. Instead you get all 8 Blu-ray discs packed into a very tidy package and not much fatter than one for the standard DVD case. The package layout gives a minimum of information about the discs inside. For confirmed Rodgers & Hammerstein musical fans, the big draw here is the marvellous 30fps Todd-AO version of Oklahoma! The transfers of South Pacific and The Sound of Music are just as good, if not perfect, but the higher frame rate makes Oklahoma! pop out so much brighter and clearer and we're just being hit with more information per second, and the fast motion in the dance sequences is much less blurred. I think of myself at the age of five, spinning 45rpm records of these songs on the floor, and find it hard to believe that I can now can see the presentations of the whole films, in totally quality that is totally equal to what I saw when I went to see these films in the cinema and I feel these films look far more superior, and look even more stunning and thank goodness to computer high definition in cleaning up the prints and making sure we have the right soundtrack and I originally had this box set on the Region 1 DVD set and looked good at the time, but this Blu-ray set surpasses all of my expectation and it has now gone pride of place in my Region A/1 Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!

3272499,5,B000Z63ZKG,"I have to wonder if I viewed the same set as some of the other reviewers here!  I am a videophile/film buff who is usually very hard on the studios when they get it wrong.  This set looks fine to me, except for the inexplicable loss of the supplemental disc 2 of TSOM (why??!!).

The remainder of the extras are great, the most important being the Fritz Lang version of LILIOM.  Fox released the 1930 Frank Borzage version on DVD in the MURNAU, BORZAGE, AND FOX box set a few years ago, so it would have been easy (and lazy) for them just to have included that.  The Lang version being included was a complete surprise, previously issued by Kino on DVD.  I think it's better than CAROUSEL!

I do agree with others that the gem in the set is the Todd-AO version of OKLAHOMA!  Even though it is 1080i, it just bursts from the screen.  I think the 1080i format is the appropriate way to handle nonstandard frame rates rather than comforming them to 24p with blended frames or stutter.

I really think Fox has done a great job here, despite dropping the ball on some of the supplements, especially with TSOM.  That one is a real puzzler since all they had to do was throw in the second disc.  I suspect rights issues or other financially related problems were the reasons.",1404518400,6,1268,4.394849785407725

I have no idea when Fox does such a terrific job on its older movies why they would do such appalling job on two of its greatest and most loved musicals. Both look better on standard DVD and why no Pat Boone ""State Fair"" which I much prefer over the twee and dated original (who can not like Ann Margret's dance numbers).My guess is given the level of criticism this release has created I believe ""Carousel"" and ""King and I"" may get a makeover before they are released as solo items (which doesnt seem to be happening any time soon) Fox could learn a lot from Warners and their extraordinary job on ""Hit the Deck"" on blu ray.",1404172800,3,874,4.573248407643312

3272502,5,B000Z63ZKG,"RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN COLLECTION BLU RAY review

This is a review of the Blu-ray collection.  I owned the DVD versions, so I will be comparing the dvd vs the blu ray discs in picture quality and sound quality.
You already know how iconic the Broadway plays and movies are.  They have become legends and I don't need to restate their importance.

Note: viewed on a Panasonic pt-ae 3000 1080p projector and a Sony Blu-ray player on a 120"" screen.

State fair - blu ray - Very good picture and outstanding sound (considering its an old mono optical sound track and Technicolor 35mm film).  Beats the DVD version.  You don't get the Pat Boone/Ann Margaret version.  Oh well!  I like this older version better.

Oklahoma Todd AO version blu ray. - great!  worth the wait.  One weird thing,  they say it is recorded in 1080i instead of 1080p.  This must be to keep the Todd AO 30fps from being screwed up by the 1080p 24fps (???) .  The projector usually reports on the signal its getting from the blu ray player and it says the movie is 1080p at 60 fps (I am already confused???)  Anyway, it looks great and sounds great too. Very sharp and very clear.  There is no comparison with the old dvd version (or any other version), this one rules!

Oklahoma Cinemascope version blu ray - Very nice, and good picture quality.  The sound is good.  An improvement on the older DVD Version.

Carousel - cinemascope 55 version Blu Ray- very nice. Picture quality varies from very good to outstanding. The sound is slightly better than the DVD version.  Both the DVD and blu ray have some mild distortion in the vocal tracks.  This does include the movie Lilliom, which Carousel is based on and most of the bonus features from the 2nd disk dvd. An improvement on the older DVD Version.

The king and I cimemascope 55 version blu ray- very nice Picture quality varies from very good to outstanding. The sound is slightly better than the DVD version.  Both the DVD and blu ray have some mild distortion in the vocal tracks.  An improvement on the older DVD Version.

South Pacific Todd AO general release version blu ray - outstanding picture and sound. The sound is much better than the DVD version.  The songs with the filter 'enhancement' are just as annoying to watch as the older DVD version. But, thats the way it is, I guess. An improvement on the older DVD Version.

South Pacific Todd AO ""roadshow version"" blu ray -very nice Picture quality varies from very good to outstanding. The sound is much better than the DVD version.  The songs with the filter 'enhancement' are just as annoying to watch as the older DVD version. The lost and restored roadshow footage is in the same condition as the DVD version (faded!). Oh well!  An improvement on the older DVD Version.

The sound of music -todd AO version blu ray - very nice.  The sound and picture quality are outstanding.  Has some blu ray extras that aren't on the DVD version. An improvement on the older DVD Version.

So, its worth it to get the blu ray set.  A few things are missing, a few things are new, but with the overall better picture quality and sound quality, its a nice collection.

And, lets beat this dead horse, again. Some reviewers are complaining about a 'bluer' and darker overall tint on the King and I and Carousel.  This can be easily corrected by adjusting the color temp to be a little bit more 'red' and tweaking the brightness control.",1402876800,21,3408,4.5627062706270625
3272503,3,B000Z63ZKG,"Despite my misgivings after reading the negative reviews on some of the titles in this set, I decided I just really wanted to see for myself so I broke down and bought it after the price went down a bit to $110. I'm wishing now I had waited until it dropped more, but I still don't regret buying it. My thoughts:
STATE FAIR --- I had almost no issues with the transfer on this one, despite the complaints from other sources about it being too dark. The grain seemed natural, if a little heavy in spots, and the colors seemed bright and saturated. I'd give the picture quality a B.
And yes, the remake should have been included in this set, ghastly as it is.
OKLAHOMA --- Yes, yes, yes! The glowing reviews of the Todd-AO version are spot on, from the 30fps smoothness (which enhances the clarity but doesn't look TOO smooth, like when you leave the Tru-motion option on on your TV), to the brilliant restored color and detail with just a fine layer of grain to remind us that it's a film. I was one of the first to write a negative review on the DVD travesty 10 years ago and I couldn't be more pleased with this restoration and transfer. . .it truly enhanced my enjoyment of watching this film again! If only the same loving care had been applied to --- well let's not jump ahead. Picture quality A+. The Cinemascope version by comparison is detailed in some shots but grainy and muddy in others, and some scratching and jumping is evident. It's good to have it to compare to the Todd-AO version in performances and other minor differences, but it's otherwise pretty useless. Picture quality gets a C.
CAROUSEL -- Here's where the real problems begin. I've kept reading how The King and I looked like it had been dipped in a blue wash, and this is true -- but it's just as true, if not more so, with this title. The real shame is, the picture otherwise looks beautiful! No speckles, scratches, or jumps are evident, and the detail, clarity and texture is quite stunning, with very little grain. But that blue wash dulled the color through the entire film. . .Julie's orange dress looks muddy, and even the usually bright ""June is Busting Out all Over"" number looks here like it was filmed during an eclipse. I watched the opening of this movie on VUDU in hi-def and the stars Billy are polishing look crystal white; here they all look blue. I'm very disappointed by the color, thus giving it a C.
THE KING AND I -- Or, Anna Sings the Blues. This looked so much better on VUDU. Like Carousel, this transfer looks like someone did a great restoration on it then dropped the reels into a toilet full of 2000 Flushes Blue cleanser. In addition, several sequences look slightly out of focus before and after the crossfades. . . in other classic films it cuts back to the first generation elements to clarify the scene but there are a lot of what appear to be second-gen shots here. This movie deserves so much better. Picture C-.
SOUTH PACIFIC and THE SOUND OF MUSIC both get an A, but these are not surprising since they evidently used the same great transfers as their previous releases. I had given away my copy of TSOM so the only title I actually double-dipped on was SOUTH PACIFIC, which made getting this set just marginally worth it to me.
The sound is great on all the releases. In the case of CAROUSEL and KING AND I, it is a testament to the power of these films that I enjoyed watching them and was moved once again in spite of the flawed transfers. But honestly, like OKLAHOMA, will we have to now wait another 10 years to get decent high-definition versions of these films that aren't streamed? Really, it's just too bad.",1402444800,18,3631,4.453453453453453
3272504,5,B000Z63ZKG,"I was initially put off buying this set. It was pricey and too many reviews criticized the video and/or audio quality. The nay sayers are dead wrong. This is a great set with clear, sharp images and crystal clear audio. To those who said Mrs. Anna's dress was different colors in different scenes - may I suggest a little less wine before viewing again. Now I KNOW there are friends out there who check their plasmas laying on top of the screen with a microscope in order to find something wrong, something just a little off. Lighten up and be fair to the material. Here is my evaluation across the board; all - I repeat ALL the films are clear, sharp and beautiful to behold. Audio is extremely good considering the age of some of the material. ""King"" and ""Carousel"" delighted me because they used the original four track audio. The early Scope films took great pains to move voices and sounds as the actors moved. Nowadays almost all voices are placed at the center channel. The early Fox Scope films took great pains to create a constantly changing audio staging. So....watch for a price break (I just got one a few days ago) and invest in this set. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM. To the negative reviewers.....dust off your microscopes and begin attacking this review. I choose to enjoy this set - it's nothing short of GLORIOUS!

3272506,2,B000Z63ZKG,"I'm not sure I get the point of Fox's R&H Collection. They've jettisoned the second disc of extras on The Sound of Music, and done next to nothing on Oklahoma! in Cinemascope. Oklahoma! in Todd A-O is 1080i, not 1080p - presumably because this is the only way video can up convert Todd A-O's 30 frames per second. Still, colors just aren't as vibrant as one might expect from a large gauge film format like Todd A-O. The Cinemascope version is a travesty; grainy, riddled in age-related artifacts and even a hint of edge enhancement.

We also lose the 62' version of State Fair. The original 45' version of State Fair looks awful and dark. True, Fox has NO original elements to crib from, but it doesn't look like they've done much to the original video master created for the DVD from 2002. No additional clean up or tinkering with the color and contrast to minimize the ravages of time. Finally, Carousel and The King and I; while the former sports a fairly robust color palette, the sound quality remains grating on the ear - much too strident and with reverb that is distracting. The King and I's image quality fails to dazzle. In fact, colors are fairly subdued. Where is the gorgeous pop and sparkle of Leon Shamroy's Oscar-nominated cinematography?!?

3272514,2,B000Z63ZKG,"First the good news...the Todd-AO version of ""Oklahoma!"" is stunning, absolutely the best this film has ever looked on video, a BIG improvement over the previous botched by Fox standard DVD. ""South Pacific"" and ""The Sound of Music"" are also excellent transfers, the exact same versions previously released as double discs, the only negative being you don't get the extra disc of special features  you previously got with ""The Sound of Music"". The CinemaScope version of ""Oklahoma!"" is also fine although I can't imagine why anyone would ever want to look at again when the Todd-AO version (and this lovely transfer!) is so much better. ""State Fair"" (the 1945 version rather than the 1962 version in the previous R&H box set) is acceptable but the apparent lack of original Technicolor elements make it not nearly as impressive as what really can be done when original three strip Technicolor negatives are available. ""State Fair"" is probably as good as it will ever look on film or video...but definitely not great!

The big disappointment here is ""The King and I"". As many other reviewers have pointed out it's simply way too dark and has a blue tint throughout! Compare it to the previous standard DVD version and it's like night and day. Even with the higher resolution of Blu-ray and this sourced from restored CinemaScope 55 elements the standard DVD wins by a mile! I can't imagine how this ever got by quality control at Fox. ""Carousel"" definitely benefits from the restored larger negative CinemaScope 55 elements and Blu-ray but it's just too dark. Again comparing it with the previous Standard DVD makes you prefer the former, even with the lesser resolution.

A disc recall and replacement by Fox is in order for especially ""The King and I"" but ""Carousel"" too but I have do idea if we'll see it. The Rodgers & Hammerstein organization which takes great pride in their musicals and authorized this release in fact should DEMAND this recall and replacement. Like many others I already have the standard DVD box set of the R&H musicals as well as the Blu-rays of ""South Pacific"" so there was some major and expensive double dipping just to get Blu-rays of ""Oklahoma!"", ""Carousel"" and ""The King and I' since none of those titles are yet available on single Blu-ray discs.

In summation a BIG disappointment and something the people at Fox should absolutely be ashamed of! Since this is currently an Amazon exclusive Amazon should do the right thing and withdraw this high priced set from sale until Fox remedies the situation with replacement discs for ""The King and I"" and ""Carousel"" and additionally Amazon should offer us suckers...I mean customers who forked out big bucks for this set a full cost refund if we want to return the discs (not just the 50 per cent you normally get for returning opened CD's or DVD's).",1400025600,10,2826,4.84472049689441
3272515,2,B000Z63ZKG,"Oklahoma TODD-AO has been beautifully Remastered. As nice as The Sound of Music Blu-ray. State Fair looks like a poor quality DVD as the Technicolor image is nowhere to be seen. The 60th Anniversary DVD is so much better quality (there's Technicolor) than this Blu-ray. Carousel is a dark and dowdy print. It is Deluxe color which has not been color corrected. The Sound of Music is good which was previously restored. As too with South Pacific, maybe the Colored sequences should have been restored with today's technology or even removed entirely?
I believe 20th Century Fox needs to properly Remaster State Fair, Carousel, The King and I again. These are true Film treasures which need to be fully restored. I have longed for these Films to be restored and released for such a long time. I purchased 2 copies, one for myself and the other for a gift. I cannot give second one as a present now, due to what hasn't been done to these Films. 20th Century Fox, please take a look at the Turner Entertainment (Warner Bros.-MGM) Films available, and see what they have been doing to their Libraries for 20 years plus.

3272516,4,B000Z63ZKG,"Thanks to 20th Century Fox for compiling such a wonderful number of classic film musicals on BluRay. We watched them on a JVC DLA front projector on a 3metre screen and overall the picture quality is very good to superb. Not sure why there is harsh criticism in other posts on this site about the King and I colour problem since we got a very good picture quality in the Cinemascope 55 transfer  there was no major colour problem we could detect. If any it was only slight, variable but  and not all that distracting consistent with the original negative. Sure, the clarity can vary in long to close focus but that is substantially due to the limitations of the Cinemascope 55 format (55mm film size) compared to the much better clarity of TODD-AO (70mm film size). Carousel is also a Cinemascope 55 transfer and of good quality but obviously does not match TODD-AO clarity. The RH collection includes a TODD-AO version and an original standard Cinemascope (35mm) version of Oklahoma. Thankfully due to Mike Todds foresight his TODD-AO 70mm film format and the BluRay disc transfer of it are leaps and bounds better than the standard Cinemascope BluRay disc of the same movie both in sound and picture quality. Both sound and picture quality in the TODD-AO version are excellent.

Sound of Music and South Pacific we already had the excellent Blu-Ray TODD-AO transfer versions released some time ago but the purchase of the entire compilation was worth the inclusion of the other titles in our opinion. Thanks to Amazon for making it available.",1399852800,3,1544,4.818867924528302
3272517,1,B000Z63ZKG,"This Rodgers And Hammerstein Collection is almost a waste of money, especially for those who already own SOUTH PACIFIC and SOUND OF MUSIC BD!

I bought this set specifically for OKLAHOMA! and THE KING AND I. OK, OKLAHOMA! is the newly restored but only the Todd-AO version, not the CinemaScope version. Color are vibrant and details are good! Pop in the CinemaScope version, and one would immediately see the different - color are pale! I could live with that, just treat the CinemaScope version as Bonus Features.

How about the rest? SOUTH PACIFIC and THE SOUND OF MUSIC are exactly the same as the previous BD released, but now you only get the movie disc for THE SOUND OF MUSIC! 2nd BD (and DVD if that matter to you!) with loads of Bonus Features is missing. So hold on to your previous 45th Anniversary BD released!

Now let talk about problems for the rest of the titles. STATE FAIR is, well, kind of acceptable since it is the oldest. What you didn't get is the 1962 version, which was included in the 60th Anniversary Edition DVD set. As for CAROUSEL and THE KING AND I, it's disastrous! Both are BLUE all over! Color timing are obviously wrong to the state of almost unwatchable! For example, in THE KING AND I, as Deborah Kerr arrived in Bangkok, it just blue everywhere, especially her dress and the sky. But the moment she enter the palace, it kind of turn silver, and suddenly turn back to blue after Yul Brynner introduced his children! How could they get it so wrong? What wrong with their quality control?

To me, it's a complete waste of money, even though I got it at a discount price of $73.99 from Amazon! This set will not be on my shelf, and I want my money back! For those who still considering,  forget it! This set is not worth the money!

Update:

I reviewed CAROUSEL and THE KING AND I with my THX calibrated TV again, and also compared it with both CAROUSEL and THE KING AND I 50th Anniversary DVD. Both improve a little but still appear artificially bluer then their DVD counterpart. Deborah Kerr dress still drifting between blue and silver instead of something in between, kind of greyish blue, which appear on the DVD. For me, OKLAHOME! alone is not enough to save the whole package, especially when I already have SOUTH PACIFIC and THE SOUND OF MUSIC BD. I am return it for a full refund.",1399593600,26,2322,4.501187648456057
3272518,2,B000Z63ZKG,"These are wonderful films and at this advanced state of the art in digital restoration, why is there such inconsistency of the transfers? While the HD iTunes download of ""The King and I""  approaches absolute perfection, I have to agree with all the problems in color and contrast noted in reviews for this Blu-ray disc version. Check out what was achieved on the iTunes HD ""King and I""...isn't anyone at Fox aware what others in their company are doing at the same time?

As for the ToddAO ""Oklahoma,"" the picture quality is great, but the dialogue has been compressed into what sounds like a hollow sounding tube. The CinemaScope disc of Oklahoma, with lesser picture quality, opens up the tracks a bit but does not compare with the much older sound on the Laser Disc!

""State Fair"" desperately needs treatment similar to Warner's ""ultra-process"" for restoring aging Technicolor negatives with shrinkage damage. And finally then, excluding the 1962 ""State Fair"" remake in favor of a low bit rate ToddAO version of ""South Pacific"" is a missed opportunity to make the collection more attractive to ""starved"" catalogue title buyers, eager for quality upgrades.

All would be forgiven if the restoration work had come even close to the iTunes version of King and I.",1399161600,11,1262,4.938679245283019

3272520,1,B000Z63ZKG,"Like another reviewer stated, ""Carousel"" looks awful on blu ray:  it's much too dark and the whole film looks as though it takes place at dusk.  What a great disappointment.",1398988800,16,173,4.733333333333333
3272521,3,B000Z63ZKG,"We waited a long time for the Rodgers & Hammerstein Collection to arrive on Blu Ray.  It's been several years since it was originally announced for release, then all of a sudden it was cancelled.  Now, it's finally out.  The films themselves are from some of the best Musicals ever written.  I personally believe that the ""Sound of Music"" is the best Film ever made, due to it's music, storyline, scenery, and location photography.  The film itself is far superior to it's stage production.  As far as the musicals themselves, I feel ""Carousel"" is the best of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Scores.  The film was good, but if you see a professional Stage Version, you will come to appreciate it even more. (I was fortunate enough to see Audra McDonald in the 1994 Revival at Lincoln Center.)  ""State Fair"", ""King and I"", ""South Pacific"" and ""Oklahoma"" are also wonderful.

Now, the Blu Rays themselves.  Major disappointment.  The worst treatment is ""The King and I"".  The color temperature of the film is way off.  The entire film has a heavy blue cast over it.  At times the actors skin is actually blue.  The continuity of color throughout camera angles also changes within scenes.  There was no effort to restore this movie to give it the Blu Ray presentation it deserves.  A good example is when Lady Thiang is singing ""Something Wonderful"".  She goes from Bluish to even Bluer within the song.  She could have easily been a character from ""Avatar"".  It's a shame.  These were important films during their time and were shot in CinemaScope 55.  They were produced as close to perfection as technology at that time allowed.  They are also important films to many people today and they should be preserved on Blu Ray the best possible way.  It's a crime that this film was released on Blu Ray and nobody along the way caught an extremely obvious problem.  The audio is also lifeless.

""Carousel"", another CinemaScope 55 film is flat in color, audio and contrast.  The 2006 collection on DVD looks much better.  I've even seen VHS tapes with better coloring.

""State Fair"" looks just like the DVD.  Nothing special.

""South Pacific""  and ""Sound of Music"" both are beautiful as they are the lovingly restored versions that were previously released on Blu Ray a couple years ago.

The only advantage to this set is ""Oklahoma"".  Two versions of the film were shot simultaneously.  One in Cinemascope and one in Todd AO.  Up until now, the Todd AO version was in horrible shape.  This set includes both versions.  The restored Todd AO version was recently shown at the film festival in LA.  It's stunning!  The film pops right off the screen.  The restoration is right in line with ""Sound of Music"" and ""South Pacific"".  It's sad that they didn't give ""King and I"" and Carousel"" the same treatment.

So, to sum things up.  If you already have ""Sound of Music""  and ""South Pacific"" on Blu Ray, the only good addition in this set is the Todd AO ""Oklahoma"" which is also set to be released individually in fall.  If you have the 2006 R&H DVD Collection, you already posses better looking copies of ""King and I"", ""Carousel"" and ""State Fair"".

After the long wait, you would think they had enough time to give us better quality.  They are certainly charging for it.  There is nothing on the labeling that says these films underwent restoration, but, you would think that they would have made an effort to render an improved film to Blu Ray.  Instead, you are getting 2 films (""King and I"" and ""Carousel"") that looked better when they were on videotape.",1398988800,178,3542,4.698205546492659
3272522,5,B000Z63ZKG,"I just got this set Tuesday, so I have watched STATE FAIR, OKLAHOMA, and KING AND I, so far. Unlike some reviewers I have had no problem with color, sound or brightness in those three. I have a Sony player and a large flat screen. Oklahoma is so beautiful, I could watch it just for the scenery behind the actors. King and I (my personal favorite) is absolutely gorgeous. State Fair doesn't hit the high standard of the others as a movie, but takes us back to the 40's musicals and is a sunnier take on life than the others. Though I agree with other reviewers that I would rather had Flower Drum Song in this package. South Pacific always loses me with the color filters which I find distracting. Sound of Music and Carousel, while I love the music, the former I have seen too many times and the latter is my least favorite, not because of the music, but because of the sadness of the story. I had most of these already which I sold on amazon and I got in on the beginning deal, so that I got this set for about $7.00 a disc. I would have paid the full price if I just gotten the King and I all by itself on blu. What a bargain!! Hours of beautiful music, beautiful sets and costumes, wonderful singing and dancing.

3272524,3,B000Z63ZKG,"Looks like my reaction to these new transfers is quite different from the general run of comments on Amazon since this set came out a few days ago. Apart from the incredible restoration of the ""Todd-A-O Oklahoma!"" which is of demonstration quality and should not be undervalued, the other new transfers, especially ""The King and I"" ""Carousel"" and ""State Fair"" are, in my opinion, just dead wrong in terms of color, brightness and contrast. Yes, resolution is better, especially in the case of  ""State Fair,"" but much of this movie is too dark. Instead of a cheery musical, we are given a sombre melodrama. Take a look at Margy's first entrance at her window and as she turns to go into her room. So much of the image disappears in shadow, and her lovely dress looks more like a dish towel.

""The King and I"" has some terrific flashes of proper color, but much of it is too dark (again) with an odd blue tinge that flattens the contrast. When it isn't blue, it is at times a burnished yellow-copper that means well but, because of the brightness level, the king especially sometimes looks like he just stepped out of a mudbath. And look what happens to Irene Sharaf's fabulous costumes when you make the darker aspects darker still. Note how the subtle uniqueness of each of the costumes of the king's wives is wasted into shadow when they gather about Anna to check out her dress. Elsewhere, we see that all the jewelry glistens but we can't quite make out how any of it set into the costume or headgear. The transfer isn't always wrong in this respect. ""The March of the Siamese Children"" is close to perfect - lots of light with good color balance - which makes me wonder why so many other scenes are dialed down the way they are.

Please don't get me wrong - there is plenty to admire even in the darkness. ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" surely the visual high point of the film, sustains some wonderful colors despite the subdued light - and the high-def imagery makes for exquisite movement: the rainstorm during Eliza's escape is stunning.

Also, here, as in all the new movies, the audio comes with considerably improved dynamics and clarity, at times revealing faults with the original mix, as with Yul Brynner's first ""Who, who, who?"" that just blows us out of the room, it's so disproportionally loud. Elsewhere, as in ""Shall We Dance,"" there is a power and majesty completely in accord with the subject.

This is a flawed set: On the one hand we have the miracle of ""Oklahoma! in Todd-A-O,"" for which, frankly, I had the lowest of expectations, and on the other, an entirely wrong-headed idea of what some of these musicals should look like on a proper home theater presentation. In my opinion, the most recent DVDs of ""The King and I"" and ""State Fair"" are considerably better - possibly, more accurate, certainly more pleasing and more consistent - in terms of color, brightness and contrast than the new Blu-rays, where Fox has turned glorious Technicolor into generic video. The Blu-rays all have much improved sound and superior resolution as compared to their DVD counterparts, but only ""Oklahoma! in Todd-A-O"" hits it out of the park.",1398902400,233,3141,4.682971014492754
3272525,5,B000Z63ZKG,"As usual, I already have the DVD versions of these films and in a few cases two or three DVD versions.  In any case, the work that was put in to get the TODD/AO version of OKLAHOMA is nothing less than a miracle.  There is NO COMPARISON between the TODD/AO version that came in the last DVD set and this Blu-ray.  I just can't put in words how good it looks.  When they talk about 30 fps projection, this is the granddaddy.

The other two films Carousel and The King and I, were both filmed in Cinemascope 55.  While they are excellent transfers (with the exception of a few  very minor flaws), they certainly can't be compared to the 30fps version of Oklahoma, but are Blu-ray versions that stand on their own and I think we're lucky that they could still be made looking so good.

As for South Pacific, I didn't watch that yet because I already have the single Blu-ray that came out.  I only wish that the TODD/AO version of South Pacific could be made to look as good as the OKLAHOMA TODD/AO version now does.  And last but not least is The Sound of Music, which I also didn't watch.

3272532,4,B000Z63ZKG,"If you love the Musicals of Rodgers and Hammerstein then you should know that the six films represented in this set look and sound better than I have ever seen them on home video. So why should you consider holding off on buying the set? Frankly, it's the price. I was lucky enough to get my order in when it was being sold for under $80. For that price, I feel as if I've gotten my money's worth. Had I paid $179 I would have been sorely disappointed.

It all comes down to the supplements. Studios these days are reticent to spend any money on supplemental features, especially on catalog films. All of the supplements on this set could already be found on previous DVD releases or, in the case of The Sound of Music and South Pacific, on the Blu-ray releases. Don't misunderstand me: these are quality supplements geared toward film lovers. They are also plentiful, with one exception I'll get to farther along in the review. The are sadly all in Standard Definition, however. That wouldn't bother me so much except that some of them, like the Todd-AO shorts or the feature film Liliom (the basis for Carousel), could really benefit from an HD transfer.

Which brings me to the two things that are deal-breakers, as far as I'm concerned. First, the South Pacific discs are exactly the same as the previously-released version. That means that the Roadshow version of the film is still in SD. Very disappointing. Secondly, The Sound of Music is only the first disc from the previously-released Blu-ray set. That means that the most popular film in the set is missing nearly all of the supplements from that set. It's bare-bones except for commentary tracks. For what they are charging, Fox should have included the second disc. There is absolutely no excuse for not doing so. (Edit: The second disc from the previous State Fair DVD release is also not in this package. That disc included the largely derided 1962 version of the film and a brief Mary Martin performance. Not a huge loss, but it may be an issue for some people.)

At the time of release of this set, it's the only way to get four of the films on Blu-ray in the US. I don't expect that to be the case for long. If you're patient, it's likely that you'll be able to purchase these films on their own for far-less than the cost of purchasing them together in this set.

8234807,3,B000Z63ZKG,"The concept is an interesting and appealing one: 6 great Rodgers & Hammerstein musicals in one slim package in high definition blu ray quality; the execution though sadly leaves a lot to be desired.  I guess I am less disappointed as others may be due to the fact I was really only interested in ""Oklahoma"" and ""The Sound of Music"" while the other musicals for me at least were nice to have but not critical.  In fact I would have gladly gotten the 2 musicals as separate releases but given the price point of this set I decided what the heck - more is better than less like they say in Econs 101 right?  Wrong!  The first disc containing ""State Fair"" has only so-so picture quality which barely rises above VHS quality and the DTS mono sound quality is a good as mono gets I suppose.  As a story though the film is enjoyable if you don't mind the underwhelming picture and sound qualities from a blu ray disc.  The second disc - thankfully for me - is ""Oklahoma"" in Todd-AO which happens to be the best in terms of picture and sound quality in DTS HD MA 7.1 surround.  The one annoying thing is that when the song segments come up the volume levels are a lot higher than the spoken dialogue sections which may require depending upon the neighbours and when you are watching a finger on the volume controls to quickly bring levels up or down depending upon the segment.  This happens to be my favourite musical of all time though and so I'm glad this disc is the best one in this collection.  Disc 3 is ""Oklahoma"" in CinemaScope and while not as good as the Todd-AO one still ranks among the better discs in this set.  The good thing is that the volume levels are about the same for both the song and spoken sections while the picture and sound quality in DTS 4.0 isn't quite as good as the Todd-AO.  Disc 4 is ""Carousel"" which I enjoyed the least; the story itself I didn't find interesting and in fact in the special features portion of the disc the original black & white French feature which inspired the musical ""Liliom"" I enjoyed a lot more.  The picture and sound quality of ""Carousel"" was just ok coming in DTS 4.0.  Disc 5 is ""The King & I"" which also has patchy picture and sound quality but it's still better than ""Carousel"" overall and not just because of the much more interesting storyline.  Disc 6 is ""South Pacific"" Theatrical version which is interesting for me as I didn't really appreciate this musical until I watched it again here.  This version ranks among the better discs with a decent picture quality and a sound quality of DTS HD MA 5.1 surround which was pretty good although the same bugbear of the song segments having a louder volume than the spoken segments although not as pronounced as in ""Oklahoma"" Todd-AO.  Disc 7 is ""South Pacific"" Road Show Version which is longer but unfortunately the added segments have not aged well and attempts at restoration have not fared well resulting in patchy picture and sound quality as well.  The sound quality is in Dolby 5.1 which makes it softer and less harsh than the DTS of the previous disc but too bad the picture quality isn't as good.  Disc 8 is ""The Sound of Music"" which is among the best of the lot in terms of content for me and picture and sound quality; unfortunately for me though I got a faulty disc which freezes somewhere in the middle.  So overall if I had to rank the discs in order of overall quality it would be: ""Oklahoma - Todd AO"", ""The Sound of Music"", ""South Pacific - Theatrical"", ""Oklahoma - CinemaScope"", ""The King & I"", ""Carousel"", ""State Farm"" and finally ""South Pacific - Roadshow"".

My advice would be to wait for better restorations of the last four just mentioned above but if you are only interested in the first four then you should be alright.",1511481600,,3754,4.452554744525547

8234810,5,B000Z63ZKG,"Purchased this set a few months ago, locally. Ran through a few scenes of each disc...on my system the colors are amazing, and so is the overall resolution. I believe the original films have the same color properties, as I think the producers were trying to recreate lighting effects from the stage version. So, the color saturation ""oddities"" seen are just that...What the producers wanted. They look odd today, but it was intended. Overall, I find this a wonderful set, for anyone liking/loving Rodgers and Hammerstein.",1496534400,,521,5.069767441860465
