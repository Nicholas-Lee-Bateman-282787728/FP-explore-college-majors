890786,5,6304466463,"I first saw this movie as a kid in the early 60's. Being a baby boomer I watched a lot of TV and movie westerns growing up. I was pleased to see that the end of this comedy had a lot of stars of the day as a surprise. People like Roy Rogers, Fess Parker, Gary Cooper and Jay ""Tonto"" Silverheels help Bob's character win what would have been a one-sided gunfight. This is not Mr. Hope's best solo effort, but it is a funny romp and a well-made parody of the western genre. It's one of my favorite comedies. Give it a try and you might like it as well.",1290729600,5,550,3.963963963963964
890787,4,6304466463,"With the 1950's coming to an end, two of its biggest box office celebrities  saw a falling off of film popularity which had put both, successively, at the top of the heap. Crosby responded by making a few more starring appearances,taking a very few featured roles, and, within the decade, a complete retirement from film-making. Hope responded by using his character, Bob Hope, increasingly as an adjunct to his ever-successful TV appearances. So it is, in the sixties and later, we get films which are either essentially repetitions of earlier work or routine comedy ventures, worth seeing, but worth seeing only by new or nostalgic viewers.
In Alias Jesse James, younger viewers will get a chance to see replications of the kind of verbal and visual comedy that made him so successful. Audiences which knew him in his prime, late-thirties through early fifties, will have s sense of deja-vu, for some pleasant, for others boring.",1284940800,3,931,5.006451612903226
890788,3,6304466463,"Not a classic motion picture, but a funny romp.  Bing Crosby appears in a short cameo shot, along with various western stars, e.g., Roy Rogers, Fess Parker, etc., almost everyone who carried a gun.  Bob Hope plays a hapless insurance salesman who has sold a life insurance policy to Jesse James.  Then the trouble begins.  Rhonda Fleming has the female lead, and the Hope character finds himself competing with Jesse James for the woman.  Like other Bob Hope motion pictures it has recently been on TV.  It is worth watching for some light entertainment.",1281312000,,554,4.840425531914893

890790,3,6304466463,"""Alias Jesse James"" (1959) is the last and least of Bob Hope's Western spoofs. Even with director Norman Z. McLeod at the helm, this Technicolor farce lacks the sharp pacing of the comedian's better efforts. Luckily, the film improves as it moseys along - climaxed by a hilarious star-studded shootout. In the words of a famous crooner, Old Ski Nose ""needs all the help he can get."" The cameos save the movie, yet Hope's cinematic decline began shortly thereafter.",1206835200,15,464,4.886075949367089
890791,5,6304466463,"Alias Jesse James is one of Bob Hope's ""funny,"" more straight-forward classics, as opposed to his sillier films. (which are great too, but some people don't enjoy ""silly."")

As a bumbling insurance salesman who has just lost his job, and then sells an expensive policy to the notorious Jesse James to convince his boss to hire him back.....well, you can imagine the uproarious situations that arise. Hope's masterful comic timing and a great and innovative script make this a ""must see"" for his fans, as well as fans of great comedy.

Co-star Rhonda Fleming is perfect in her role, as well as drop-dead beautiful, and Wendell Corey makes for a super Jesse James.",1175040000,4,662,4.849557522123894
890792,5,6304466463,"There's just something so inherently likable about Bob Hope. Maybe it's the quick wit and comedic timing. Maybe it's the self-effacing ""just one of the guys"" mannerisms. Maybe it's the basic decency of the man shining thru. I don't know, but he's my favorite film comedian, bar none. Alias Jesse James is just another fine example of Bob exercising his immense comedic talents to their fullest.

Having just been being fired from the Plymouth Rock Insurance Company, bumbling New York insurance agent Milford Farnsworth (Bob Hope) attempts to get back into his company's good graces by selling a life insurance policy worth $100,000 to a T. J. James (Wendell Corey), who is ""well known in banking and railroad."" His boss, however, is outraged to find out that T. J. James is actually the notorious killer and infamous outlaw Jesse James, and sends Farnsworth scampering out West after James to recover the policy. But until he gets that policy safe in his own hands, Farnsworth must do all he can to ensure that the gunslinging varmint comes to no harm. While he's at it, Farnsworth might as well go after James' lovely gal - and beneficiary of the life insurance - Cora Lee (Rhonda Fleming).

Bob Hope once again does his patented cowardly hero schtick, and does it to perfection. This time out, he utilizes his contemporary brand of humor and his arsenal of slapstick and sight gags to up-end the western genre riotously on its head. Western spoofs are nothing new for old Ski-nose; he's done it before in The Paleface, Son of Paleface, and Fancy Pants. But it never gets old, as  Bob once again pokes fun at Wild West conventions. An example of the Hope witticism: An admiring Indian princess tells Bob, ""Your eyes - they should be on a woman."" To which, Bob replies, ""They usually are.""

Even Wendell Corey has a chance to crack a joke: a suspicious Jesse James comes busting in on Farnsworth and Cora Lee with his gun drawn, looks at Farnsworth, and says, ""I'm sorry, Milford. I thought I saw a man."" Corey effectively plays a savvy Jesse James, cunning and conniving, and someone definitely not to be trifled with. Red-headed Rhonda Fleming is devastatingly gorgeous, sings a good song,  and manages to keep a straight face at Bob's shenanigans. The ""Buttons and Bows"" moment comes when Bob and Rhonda duet with ""There's Something Else Entirely on my Mind.""

The rousing finale is great for its many cameo appearances of television and film western stars: Hugh O'Brien as Wyatt Earp, Fess Parker as Davy Crockett, Jay Silverheels as Tonto, Roy Rogers as himself, James Arness as Marshal Matt Dillon (Gunsmoke), James Garner as Bret Maverick, and Gary Cooper. Oh yeah, and Bing Crosby (""That boy needs all the help he can get."")

Hopefully, whenever the dvd version comes out, the powers that be will make it worth the wait in terms of transfer quality and bonus features. But for now, we still have the VHS tape and the occasional showing on cable tv. They'll have to do.",1153526400,9,2977,4.768932038834952

By the way, if you're thinking of owning this movie, if you've got the extra duckets, you can get ALIAS JESSE JAMES, along with several other Bob Hope pictures, on this DVD set:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bob-Hope-MGM-Movie-Legends-Collection-Alias-Jesse-James-Boy-Did-I-Get-the-Wrong-Number-The-Facts-of-Life-I-ll-Take-Sweden-The-Princess-and-the-Pirate-The-Road-to-Hong-Kong-They-ve-Got-Me-Covered/dp/B000WC3A08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bob Hope MGM Movie Legends Collection (Alias Jesse James/Boy, Did I Get the Wrong Number/The Facts of Life/I'll Take Sweden/The Princess and the Pirate/The Road to Hong Kong/They've Got Me Covered)</a>.",1331251200,,3390,5.474187380497132
890890,3,6304466463,"In Alias Jesse James, Bob Hope (1903-2003) is a meek insurance salesman, assigned to safeguard the life of the famous outlaw.  It's a very familiar situation for Hope, playing a character who though seeming ill-prepared to survive in a dangerous, somehow manages to fumble and stumble his way through.

Milford Farnsworth (Hope), a failure as an insurance salesman, runs into the infamous outlaw Jesse James (Wendell Corey) in a bar, and failing to recognize him, sells him a life insurance policy worth 100,000 dollars.  Paying off the claim would bankrupt the company, so when his boss (Will Wright) finds out the truth, Farnsworth is told to return James' payment and get the policy back.  Failing that, he is to do whatever is necessary to keep the outlaw alive.

Carrying cash, Farnsworth boards a train bound for the town of Angel's Rest where Jesse James resides, but he is almost immediately robbed by James and his gang.  Arriving in town, Farnsworth heads for the saloon.  After getting taken in a poker game with Jesse's brother Frank (Jim Davis), he meets Cora Lee Collins (Rhonda Fleming), James' girlfriend and beneficiary.  When Jesse learns that the insurance company will be sending over additional cash, he decides to keep Farnsworth alive for a while, and takes him into his home.  Clueless that he may be living on borrowed time, Farnsworth lives even more dangerously by getting closer to Cora Lee.  Princess Irawanie (Gloria Talbott), from a local native American tribe, is also attracted to the plucky salesman.

Farnsworth engages in a shootout in the street, and also joins the James gang in a train robbery, but not much exciting happens until the very end, as this version of Jesse James is rather benign.  The film's finish however is spectacular, with Cora Lee driving a buckboard with Farnsworth in the back section, riding and more often running, with the gang in hot pursuit.  The mixture of live action and studio shots features some funny and impressive stunts, and goofy special effects.  The fun isn't over when the pair reaches the next town, as Farnsworth gets some unexpected assistance during a shootout with the outlaws.  Hope's old partner Bing Crosby makes an appearance, and there are some remarkable cameos by a number of giants in the cowboy genre, including James Arness, Will Rodgers, Gail Davis, Gary Cooper, Hugh O'Brian, Fess Parker, Jay Silverheels, and in his final film appearance, Roy Roger's horse Trigger!

With an interesting premise, Alias Jesse James starts off nicely, but the final film of director Norman MacLeod's career, slows down in the middle, as the love triangle involving Jesse, Cora Lee, and Farnsworth develops.  Fortunately the movie finishes with an uproarious and highly entertaining bang, topped off with a string of hilarious cameos.

The DVD is a dual sided disc with the full screen version on one side, and widescreen on the other.  The images are a little soft, and the colors a bit dull, but that is probably to be expected for a fifty year old film.  As yet, Alias Jesse James has not been released separately on DVD, but is included in the Bob Hope MGM Legends box set.  Presently, the set seems to be available only on the secondary market, at premium prices.  So unfortunately, you may have some difficulty finding a copy.",1326067200,,3309,4.935018050541516

7873030,4,6304466463,"The immortal and wonderful Bob Hope proves once again that he is the unchallenged master of the comedic arts.  He is funny, urbane, intelligent and overtly slapstick laugh-out-loud hilarious.

This western parody ranks right up there with Hope's classics THE PALEFACE & SON OF PALEFACE and is a great companion piece to them.

Hope proves once again why he is one of the all-time greats of physical and verbal comedy.

Rhonda Fleming is stunningly beautiful as the object of Hope's desires.  Gloria Talbot makes an appearance as a Native American princess who is sympathetic to Hope and provides an unrequited love interest for him.  She is a shining example of how beautiful Hollywood starlets used to be at the then-waning end of the movie's Golden Age.

This version (MGM Movie Legends) is the uncut, unedited version of this 1959 masterpiece.  For years after it's theatrical release, the ending scenes of TV & movie western stars cameos were edited out because of copyright legalities.  This complete version contains all the beautiful Technicolor appearances of the top western stars of the late 1950's:  Hugh O'Brien as Wyatt Earp with his Buntline Special (from 'The Life And Legend Of Wyatt Earp'), Ward Bond as Seth Adams (from 'Wagon Train'), James Arness as Marshal Matt Dillion (from 'Gunsmoke'), Roy Rogers, Fess Parker as Davy Crockett (from the Walt Disney TV classic series), Gail Davis as Annie Oakley, Gary Cooper (presumably as Marshal Wil Kane from 'High Noon'), Jay Silverheels as Tonto (from 'The Lone Ranger') and Bing Crosby in western garb.

A truly funny and thoroughly entertaining romp into a bygone era of movie comedy.

The one possible downside to this great film is Wendell Cory as Jesse James.  How someone as boring and pedestrian as him ever got to be an actor is one of the great, unsolved mysteries of all time rivaling even the true identity of Jack The Ripper.",1394668800,,1900,4.937106918238993
