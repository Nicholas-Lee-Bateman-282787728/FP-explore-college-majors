3449874,4,B001AII4RC,"The latest in the ""Collective"" sets, Star Trek: Alternative Realities Collective brings fans 20 episodes, from all five series, with a few new special features at a great price- less than $30. The episodes are divided into four categories, which is a bit confusing given the way they're broken up and arranged.

Among five discs you'll find Mirror Universe (six episodes), Parallel Dimensions (two dimensions), Twisted Realities (four episodes), and Alternative Lives (eight episodes; and no, unfortunately these are not the ""gay episodes""). Many of the included episodes fall into various top-ten lists among fan and critic favorites, although there are also a couple of episodes that fall flatly with a giant `clunk.'

Visually, this set falls in at about the same level as past Collective sets.  The outer packaging is the same- sturdy paper with slimline cases- and each case has its own artwork both inside and out. Missing from this set is disk artwork- these simply include a listings of the disk's contents.

The navigation system is also similar to previous sets- basic and easy to use, but lacking any animation or music. There are no chapter/scene selection options for individual episodes. Episodes of The Original Series are all the remastered versions, which should make fans happy, as this is a first among the Collectives.

SPECIAL FEATURES

What the Special Features lack in quantity, they more than make up for in quality. Each of the four categories has its own set of special features, all of which include fantastic discussions of the episodes by Star Trek legends. Although a few of the interviews come from past box sets, most of the content is new, including insight from writers from Enterprise, Voyager, and SD9, Enterprise directors, and other experts from the ST universe. The featurettes are great for providing context into the episodes, but also for the behind-the-scenes glimpses into the making of the shows as well. Fans of audio commentary might be slightly disappointed; only one episode per disk includes that feature.

Unfortunately, as with past Collective sets, there's no behind-the-scenes footage, and no outtakes. Perhaps they're holding back for something to give us down the road...",1221696000,27,2227,5.186629526462395
3449875,5,B001AII4RC,"Nobody has wrote an actual review of this product yet, so I guess I'll do it.

This is a pretty neat set, especially compared to the other ones,like the Borg, and Klingon sets that don't give you much more than what you already have if you have the complete season sets. I havn't seen the ""Captains"" set so I really can't compare it to that. I was skeptical at first when I picked it up because I have all the OST, TNG, and ENT episodes, but the extras were worth it.

The OST episodes are neat in the fact this was the first time I had seen the Remasters on a screen bigger than my ipod.(I downloaded a few for an international flight) And the shots you do see at the begining and end of ""Turnabout Intruder"" are really cool. There's commentary on quite a few of the episodes. The One for the ""Enemy Within"" is alot of fun; the Star Trek authors, Judith Reeves-Stevens and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, give alot of fun insight into the mistakes that nitpickers have been point out for years. ""Alterantive Factor"" is one of my favorites just because it so weird and doesn't really make any sense.

Brana Braga gives commentary on ""Parallels"", And David Carson gives commentary on ""Yesturday's Enterprise"". There's a few other commentary's aswell. Sussman on The Enterprise Episode ""Twilight"" and there's a couple others I think. Each disc has a little documentary on the episodes for that disc.

It's a fun set for fans, who want the Mirror episodes or the better episodes for a particular series but don't like it enough to by the complete sets, for me that would be DS9 and VGR.

And thank god they didn't reissue ""All Good Things"" again.",1221523200,8,1636,4.551020408163265
3449876,5,B001AII4RC,"""Star Trek""'s Alternate Realities are a collection of some of the best shows, below are the reasons why>>>

""TOS"" ""Mirror, Mirror"" is fun, seeing the evil incarnations of Kirk & Spock are a treat, where treachery & brutality are a way of life to ascend to higher power

""Enterprise""'s two part series ""Mirror Darkly's 1 & 2 pay homage to the one above, with this crew acting in the same manner as they find the ""Defiant"" from the TOS's ""Tholian Web"" episode, that diappeared into not only the past, but the alternate Universe as well, and they seize control of it, watching the ""Enterprise"" crew interact in the TOS's 60's settings on the Defiant really makes TOS not look so outdated, it is a cool piece of Nostalgia & everyone seems to be having fun here.

""Star Trek""'s Next Generation's ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" is a cool alternate reality as the crew discover the Enterprise C, Picard's predecessor who accidently travels 40 years into the future altering Picard's time in which the Federation is now at war with the Klingons because the Enterprise C failed to save a Klingon outpost due to the time mishap, & the Federation is losing badly, Tasha Yar never died in this reality, & Picard must decide whether or not to sent the ""C"" to its fatal demise to save the outpost which the Klingons would consider honorable, awesome episode, one NG's best

NG's ""Inner Light"" is good too, where Picard lives a whole lifetime in a matter of 25 minutes, imagine waking up to discover that your life was played out in what was 25 minutes to those around you, but you just spent a lifetime living a life you are no longer living, the memories, everything you did, this one will mess with you, & be with you awhile.

""Enterprise's ""E2"" is very similar to the one above as Archer & his crew discover a duplicate of their ship in the Expanse, they learn that they made a course error that sent them back 100 years into the past, this E2 starship is now commanded by the crew's offspring who are here to stop history from repeating itself, imagine this happening to you..

However, Enterprise's ""Twilight"" will confuse those who have never watched the 3rd Season of ""Enterprise"" as Earth is destroyed by the Xindi, this one is a lot like NG's ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" where T'Pol like Picard can put things back the way they should be..

Deep Space Nine & Voyager's alternate episodes are good two, but not as good as the ones above

A must for any fan who likes to be made to think about what might have been!!",1220486400,,2500,4.577181208053691
3449877,5,B001AII4RC,"Finally, Paramount wrote back and gave a list of episodes - including a 3rd season original series (remastered) episode that won't be out until the November set is released (and a first for these sets)!

Then it moves on to DS9's mirror universe episodes, then the two part ""In a Mirror Darkly"" espiodes from Enterprise (which were supprisingly good). Then the focus goes to episodes that address Parallell Dimensions, Twisted Realities, and Alternate Lives. Every sort of alternate episode is covered.

I found these episodes refreshing, they allowed our familiar characters and actors to explore ""what if"" stories. In many of these we get to see different portrayals, like an evil and ambitious Captain Archer, or Kirk who has had his mind and body swapped with that of a woman.

The only weak point on this set is possibly the special features. These are mostly done by the producers and some of the cast of Enterprise. I would have liked more of all of the series cast members involved. Regardless, this is still a solid and varied collection.",1439164800,2,1057,4.899441340782123

3449896,5,B001AII4RC,"STAR TREK: ALTERNATE REALITIES is this boxed set of five CD's spanning all the STAR TREK franchises.  These episodes were not specifically ""fan chosen"" and so did not make the combined ""Fan Collective"" set of five themed CD boxed sets that were issued at about the same time (Captain's Log, Borg, Q, Klingon and Time Travel).  That's a pity, because really these fit right in with the ""theme"" orientation, and if anything this boxed set contains at least as many, and possibly more, strong or standout episodes than the norm, at an average price per unit in the five-pack.  As the photo on the box suggests, The Original Series' ""Mirror, Mirror"" is the takeoff point for many other episodes in other franchises, most notably the two-part ""In A Mirror Darkly"" from Enterprise, which interweaves with the TOS original, a fan favorite whether or not the fans got to ""choose"" it for this set.

Among my favorites are the inexplicable time-and-place-shift episodes, such as TNG's ""Parallels,"" where a confused Worf finds himself bouncing among multiple time streams, and ""Frame of Mind,"" an almost Philip-Dick-like tale that shows Riker shuttling between a play and a mental hospital, a great acting job by Jonathan Frakes and a thoroughly engrossing show in its own right.  It's in ALTERNATE REALITIES that you get to see Kirk swapping peronalities with an overambitious female officer, a superannuated Kes and her descendants, and what life would be like for Jake Sisko if his father Benjamin had died prematurely.  Bells-and-whistles are about what they are in the other boxed sets, not overwhelming, with making-ofs or similar background material for the episodes and Commentary for just a few.  Nonetheless, highly recommended, and if you've sampled any of the five boxed sets among 'Fan Favorites' you'll have a good idea what to expect.",1428710400,,1838,5.066225165562914

 As a die hard science fiction action adventure fan I have always liked the special episodes where the plot involves interesting advanced fantasy theories such as alternate realities and other universes.  There might be some scientific validity in the theory of possibly other universes and other dimensions, but such ideas are so abstract that proving their existence may not occur in our life time.  Never the less this is a great topic for the ""Star Trek"" world and I very much enjoyed these alternate reality episodes, especially the OS episode ""Mirror, Mirror"" where Shatner's Captain Kirk walks into his room and finds the dark haired beauty Barbara Luna inside waiting for him.

SOunds quality was good though and for the price you get alot of shows to watch.  The menus though where a bit odd to get through....as it put the main episodes up and when you slected one it went to a screen where you had to choose to play with commentary or with out.....not all epsiodes have that feature.  To get to the actual documentary style video you have to look up the special features section for each disc for some reason.

3449914,5,B001AII4RC,"I wish I could say I liked all these episodes. But I don't.

My favorites were all the Original Star Trek (OST) episodes, two of the Star Trek: The Next Generation (STTNG) episodes, and all but one of the Voyager episodes.  But even among these, there are others I would have preferred to some of the offerings.

For instance, why weren't the episodes about the OST trio meeting up with intergalactic mobsters and Nazis included in this volume? I like STTNG ""Yesterdays Enterprise"", but already have it on the ""Time Travel"" DVD set. ""Rascals"", or ""A Fist Full of Datas"" would have fit nicely in this volume. I don't recall the name of the Voyager episode that had the crew placed in a WWII setting, but I would have liked that two-part episode instead of the one that involved Kes, and the one where the crew were merely replicates of the genuine Voyager crew.

I don't care for either Deep Space Nine or Enterprise, but did find the DS9 episodes interesting --especially the first DS9 episode that most directly linked itself to the OST episode ""Mirror, Mirror"". I understand why the Enterprise episode that had the OST ""Mirror, Mirror"" theme was included, but I didn't care for it all the same. And, if I were an Enterprise fan, I would been terribly disappointed that one of the remaining Enterprise episodes was a two-part that only included part two! There was a more interesting two part episode from Enterprise that had the Vulcan and the engineer (through genetic engineering --no pun intended) produce a female Vulcan-human hybrid; a better episode I would have liked to have seen instead of the other two Enterprise episodes offered. Yes, it would have meant two two-part episodes, but so be it. At least there would have been two complete two-part episodes --and I would have liked one of them...

My husband wonders why we bought this DVD set. At least we purchased it at a greatly discounted price.

3449923,3,B001AII4RC,"As with the rest of this ""Fan's Collective"" series, ""Star Trek: Alternate Realities"" is a mixed bag, with some of the best and worst episodes in the franchise. The episodes are chosen by the theme of mirror universes and alternate realities rather than the quality of the episode. Thus, the same box set that contains ""Mirror, Mirror,"" one of the best episodes in the Original Series, also contains ""Turnabout Intruder,"" the last and one of the worst in the series.

Fortunately, the good outweigh the bad and we are given the opportunity to see the Next Generation ""Inner Light"" and Deep Space Nine ""The Visitor"" - two of the best episodes in Star Trek history. In fact, the alternate reality plotlines allow Star Trek to explore new twists and emotional dilemmas. This makes for some excellent science fiction. Overall, this set has enough excellent episodes (""Mirror, Mirror,"" ""Inner Light,"" ""Yesterday's Enterprise,"" ""The Visitor"") to make this worth your time and (for the very reasonable price) money.

Having said this, the set is pretty complete in that it contains almost all the episodes dealing with alternate realities. The only episode I can recall that wasn't included is TNG's ""Future Imperfect"" (in which an alien boy toys with Riker and forces him to believe he is captured by Romulans).

I also wish that the episodes were divided by series rather than theme. The themes are rather artificial (what is the difference between a parallel and mirror universe?). I'm probably not the only Trek fan who enjoys certain series more than others (I'm a big DS9 and TOS fan). This would also make it easier for people renting rather than buying the set.

3449926,4,B001AII4RC,"The latest in the Trekkers equivalent of a mix-tape, presents episodes from all 5 series, this time each with an ""Altered"" theme. The actors get to the chance to really let rip and play off each characters' darker side; either as an evil twin, or in circumstances where their life has taken a wrong turn. The most famous of these undoubtedly is a 'goatee' bearded Mr. Spock, a real highlight of original series episode 'Mirror Mirror'. Typically Star Trek is a positive vision of the future, with a multitude of alien races living together - like a futuristic United Nations. The Mirror Universe is the pole opposite of this, more like a corrupt Roman Empire conquering its way across the galaxy. It's into this setting; a transporter accident strands Kirk, McCoy, Scotty and Uhura.

'Crossover', 'Through the Looking Glass' and 'Shattered Mirror' are great choices taken from Deep Space Nine. Set in the same location but a century later, we discover a conquered Terran Empire and come face to face with alternate versions of Sisko, Kira and the inhabitants of space station - Terok Nor. Slightly disappointing however that this isn't the complete saga. But rest assured the best ones are present and it works pretty well as a trilogy. For the record (a dull, Kira episode) Resurrection and (a Ferengi) Emperor's New Cloak didn't make the set.

Next up is 'In a Mirror Darkly', a two-parter from prequel series - Enterprise (much maligned, unfairly in my view). Full of knowing references, as well as a subversive take on the movie First Contact, this is a great swashbuckling romp. Here we learn a little about the Empire's history, before Kirk arrived on the scene. Scott Bakula, better known for Quantum Leap, is on top form here... as a downtrodden Archer who finally snaps and mutinies his way to the top. Into this mix, we discover a ship from the original series has fallen through time. Archer & his backstabbing crew have to fight Tholians and Gorn to order to plunder its familiar looking technology.

Moving on, we reach the 23rd Century proper with Kirk and Spock and an early example of a parallel universe story - 'The Alternate Factor'. Here we meet Lazurus, a man on the run from himself... a dangerous anti-matter duplicate. 'Parallels' from the popular Next Generation centres on Worf criss-crossing between different realities. A fun episode with dozens of subtle differences, including a brief scene revealing what might've happened had the Borg won in a classic story.

Two episodes from TOS 'The Enemy Within' & 'Turnabout Intruder' both showcase a different James T. Kirk. One famously involves the transporter splitting him into two beings - one evil and one good. The other is the final episode from 1969, where an ex-lover gains her revenge, by switching bodies with the Captain.

One of the weirdest, psychological episodes of TNG arrives in the shape of 'Frame of Mind'. Here Riker literally gets caught up in his performance, during a stage play set in an asylum. Following this, a decent late entry from Voyager called 'Shattered' finds Chakotay aboard a ship divided into different time zones, each set in a different season of the show.

'Yesterday's Enterprise' can justifiably be proud of its popularity. It's inspired numerous episodes (apparently including JJ Abrams' new film). History has gone badly wrong for the Next Generation crew. The Klingons are still at war with the Federation, thanks to a ship from the past thrown forward in time. Tasha Yar, a notable and long dead character, avoids her earlier unceremonious fate and she, Picard and his crew get to go out in a blaze of glory.

A change of pace presents us with another TNG outing - 'The Inner Light'. Here we see an alternate life for Picard, as he wakes to find himself living on a dying alien world. Named Kamin, he has a family, all the while trying to shrug off the life he's left behind. Made all the more emotionally charged, though a musical lament he plays on the flute throughout the story. Equally tearful is Deep Space Nine's 'The Visitor', a moving tale of Sisko's son who sees his father apparently die in an accident. In true Sci-Fi style, Jake unable to move on from the tragedy, remains linked to his Dad across time and space. Voyager presents us with a neat twist on time travel, in 'Before and After'. Short-lived alien crew member, Kes finds herself jumping back in time and we see portions of her (and the crews') life in reverse.

We're now in the home stretch of this collection, with two episodes apiece from Voyager and Enterprise. 'Timeless' shows us how Janeway and her crew lost far from home, might never reach their destination. Years in the future, Chakotay and a bitter Harry Kim are revealed to be the sole survivors - unhappy with the hand destiny has dealt them and their shipmates. 'Course: Oblivion' finds a crew falling ill and slowly disintegrating. As their D.N.A. begins to unravel, they discover they might not be who they thought they were.

In 'E2', a battle-scarred Enterprise NX-01 is stopped by another ship manned by their descendents. 'Twilight' shows the full horror of the Xindi's aim to exterminate humankind, from an older, injured Archer's point of view. Both episodes show alternate outcomes to this series' year long arc to save Earth from a devastating attack.

Additional to these episodes, there are 5 audio commentaries from behind the scenes staff members - writers Mike Sussman, G & J Reeves-Stevens, Brannon Braga, David Livingston and director David Carson. Six featurettes delve into the making of each episode.

All in all, equal in quality to the last release in this series - Captain's Log. There are a couple of clunkers, notably not-so classic Trek such as 'The Alternate Factor' and 'Turnabout Intruder'. Interestingly how all 4 original series episodes included are the remastered versions, with new CGI replacing the 60's model shots. If you're curious to see if updated FX result in a decent alternative, and assuming the other episodes appeal, then getting this set might be worth your while.",1238976000,8,6070,4.889212827988338

3449946,5,B001AII4RC,"This set is divided along four themes: Mirror Universe, Twisted Realities, Parallel Dimensions, and Alternative Lives, showcasing some really outstanding stories from the five Trek incarnations.

The ""mirror universe"" episodes of ""Star Trek"" allow the respective casts to pursue not just their darker sides but their uninhibited personas, especially in regards to affairs of a sexual nature.

The original series got things started with ""Mirror, Mirror,"" the classic episode with Kirk (William Shatner), Bones (DeForest Kelly), Scotty (James Doohan), and Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) trapped in a reality wherein they belong to a totalitarian society of treachery, deceit, and assassination to get ahead.  Guest star Barbara Luna gets to emit one of the best lines in Trek history and Uhura gets to bare some skin and show a don't-mess-with-me attitude when approached by an amorous Sulu (George Takei).

""Deep Space Nine"" decided to revisit the same universe in three great episodes (""Crossover,"" ""Through the Looking Glass,"" and ""Shattered Mirror"" featured in this compilation and the results are just as titillating. Captain Sisko (Avery Brooks), Dax (Terry Farrell, Chief O'Brien (Colm Meany) and Dr. Bashir (Alexander Siddig)have alternates that are a lot less-restrained than their counterparts, allowing some wonderful interplay between them.  Kira (Nana Vistor) gets to meet her alternate self, a woman that has ""interests"" in both the male and female of the species.  Both Odo (Rene Auberjonois) and Worf (Michael Dorn) have evil twins that allow the actors portraying them a change of pace from their regular ""goody-goody"" roles.  Garek's (frequent player Andrew Robinson) doppelganger is probably more akin to the side of the character that has remained a mystery during the show's seven-year run.  Counterparts to Quark (Armin Shimmerman) and Nog (Aron Eisenberg) are equally intriguing.

Even Jake Sisko (Cirroc Lofton) gets to visit the mirror universe as he is ""kidnapped"" by the mirror version of his long-dead mother (guest Felecia Bell).

""Enterprise"" chooses to have a two-parter whereby ALL of the regular's alternate personnas take center stage.  This makes for a lot of fun as the story features a power-hungry Archer (Scott Bakula), a sexually-charged Hoshi (Linda Park), a sadistic Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley), a merciless Reed (Dominic Keating), and Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery) as Archer's silent ""muscle.  T'Pol's (Jolene Blalock) alternate is almost the same as her counterpart but with a little more revealing attire.

""The Twisted Realities"" episodes are just as engrossing, with the standouts being the classic ""The Enemy Within"" from the original to ""Frame of Mind"" from ""The Next Generation, the latter with a bravura performance from Jonathan Frakes as Commander Ryker.

""Alternate Realities"" showcase three of the best ever from ""The Next Generation.""  Tony Todd is brilliant as the adult Jake Sisko in ""The Visitor"" while Patrick Stewart shines in ""The Inner Light,"" an episode with a crafty premise and a wonderful musical score.  ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" is, without a doubt, one of the top ten from the Next Generation. The return of Denise Crosby as Tasha Yar was inspired, but not as much as her surprising second ""reincarnation"" which would happen some years later.

The two installments under the ""Parallel Dimensions"" heading are a mixed bag.  While ""Parallels"" benefits from the captivating situation that Worf finds himself in as he bounces from one dimension to the next, the original series' ""The Alternative Factor"" only serves to remind one of the ill-fated theatrical ""Star Trek V.""  Once seen, the viewer will understand the comparison.

Of the remaining episodes, highlights include a spectacular crash of Voyager in ""Timeless,"" a jaw-dropping destruction of Earth in ""Twilight"" and the tear-jerker ""Course: Oblivion.""

In addition to the quality of the episodes, the new visuals on the original series are fantastic!

The special features are cast and crew reflections on the episodes featured in the compilation.  Particularly touching are the recollections from guest star Tony Todd about ""The Visitor.""",1224979200,25,4159,5.474178403755869

3449948,4,B001AII4RC,"The only reason I did not give this DVD set a better rating is because there were not many extras.  This is a recuring problem with all Star Trek DVDS.  There is hardly any commentary.  You don't see the actors talk about much anything.  If you get Doctor Who DVDS the extras are twice as long as the episodes themselves, and they always have full commentaries on every episode.  I did like the episode selection.  These are some of the best of all of the Star Trek shows shown.  These compilation sets are a good idea for those of us who do not want to buy the full set for each show.

Then you should enjoy Star Trek Alternate Realities.  One of the real jewels in this set however are the Star Trek: Enterprise episodes ""Through a Mirror, Darkly, Parts I & II,"" two episodes of Enterprise set entirely in the Mirror Universe. One of the best things about this ""Fan Collective"" however, is the lack of repeats in comparison with other collections, only one ""Yesterday's Enterprise,"" appears, and that episode is good enough that it is forgivable.

All in all, purchase it, the Next Gen. Episodes are ok, Voyager as usual is pithy, and the DS9 Episodes are forgettable.  The Enterprise and Original Series episodes are really the best parts.",1224028800,,785,4.969465648854962

In this set the ""Mirror Universe"" episodes are great and so are the other ones such as the Fan favorite TNG episode ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" (ST:Voyager
& Next Gen didn't have any ""mirror"" episodes during their 7 seasons).  I was never a huge fan of Star Trek:Enterprise, however watching the ""In a Mirror, Darkly Pts 1 & 2"" made me realize I didn't give that show a fair chance (Enterprise was quite good! Watch it if you haven't). I bought one copy of Alternate Realities for myself and bought one for a friend's birthday.  I HIGHLY recommend this particular set over the other ones as it takes our familiar Trek characters and shows a ""What IF..??"" side to them.

3449953,5,B001AII4RC,"This is one of the best of the Star Trek Collectives; there are four episodes from each of the five series.  Most of the past collectives have been pretty bare bones in terms of features, but there are nice featurettes for Mirror Universe (2 parts), Parallel Dimensions, Twisted Realities, and Alternate Lives (2 parts)--that makes one featurette per disc with 2 on disc 2 (though part 2 of Mirror Universe is short).  The featurettes are mostly talking heads, clips, and stills--no behind the scenes visuals--and a good bit of the info consists of overviews of the episodes, but I enjoyed them, and compared to earlier sets, they are generous.

There is one audio commentary per disc--the one for ""Crossover"" was a little dry, the one for Twilight is an old one, but new ones by Brannon Braga (Parallels), the Reeves-Stevens (Enemy Within), and David Carson (Yesterday's Enterprise) were great.

I wasn't a fan of the Enterprise Mirror Universe episodes when they aired because they denied us two hours with our regular characters--but I found myself actually liking them as part of this set.  They are good campy fun, and I chuckled a lot watching them.  I own the original series seasons as they aired, so I enjoyed the chance to see the remastered versions.  Some of my least favorite episodes appear--Turnabout Intruder, Course:  Oblivion--but info from the featurettes allowed me to see them with fresh eyes, even if it wasn't enough to make me a fan of them.  There are 20 episodes here--and unless I'm mistaken, ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" is the only repeat from an earlier collective.  I won't list them since others have.

All in all this is a very nice set of episodes centered around interesting themes.  I might have dropped an episode or two, added a couple, and switched one or two to another of the four sections--but all in all, this is an excellent sampling of Star Trek.  Four of the five commentaries are new, viewers get to own a few remastered episodes of the original series, and the featurettes are nice.  There's a whole lot of excellent Star Trek here for a fair price.  If you don't own any Star Trek at all on dvd, or if you own the other collectives, you will definitely want to buy this set.  If you own the episodes already in series sets, you have a tougher choice--but I enjoyed the set quite a bit.",1221782400,10,2330,4.716049382716049
