2346004,3,B000A0GOGE,"I saw a peanut stand, heard a rubber band, I saw a needle that winked its eye.  But I think I will have seen everything, when I see a...herd of giant killer rabbits?!  Directed by  William F. Claxton (""Bonanza"", ""Love, American Style""), Night of the Lepus (1972) stars Stuart Whitman (Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines, Shatter), Rory Calhoun (Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood, Revenge of Bigfoot), and Janet Leigh (Psycho, The Manchurian Candidate), in what probably isn't considered by most to be a highpoint in her cinematic career that spanned 50 years before she passed away in October of 2004...as far as Whitman is concerned, he was perfectly suited for this film.  It's not that I hate the guy or anything, but I have been subjected to a number of stinkaroo projects in which he was prominently featured.  Also appearing is DeForest ""Dammit Jim, I'm a doctor!"" Kelley (Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan), Paul Fix (""The Rifleman""), and Melanie Fullerton (""The Gun and the Pulpit"").

The film starts off with a special news report talking about population issues, specifically focusing on the dangers of introducing non-native wildlife to an unprepared ecosystem, to which we see footage of Australians battling a populous lepus aka rabbit scourge, initially brought in as a possible food source, but since have run amok due to their enthusiastic breeding and an insufficient predatory balance.  We also learn a similar occurrence is happening in the American southwest...Cole Hillman (Calhoun) runs a cattle ranch, threatened by an ever increasing hare population, devouring his cattle's grazing lands (apparently he had a coyote problem prior, and the solution worked too well, leaving the rabbits without a natural balance).  He turns to an acquaintance Elgin Clark (Kelley), who's president of a nearby university, for help, and Elgin hooks Cole up with the Bennett's, Roy (Whitman) and Gerry (Leigh), who are visiting researchers focused on safe (no poisons) and viable means to control pest populations.  The husband and wife team are in the area, along with their annoying daughter Amanda (Fullerton), studying bats and how they might be used to control mosquito populations.  The Bennett's agree to help, hoping to utilize an experimental hormone therapy serum, given to them by a colleague, to interrupt the rabbit's breeding cycle and halt their prodigiousness.  But what happens when Amanda accidentally lets one of the test subjects loose?  Well, it breeds with others, creating a ginormous, vociferous, ravenous army of nocturnal, floppy-eared varmints that eats everything (including people) in its path...oh the humanity...science...is there anything it can't (or won't) do?  Say, what the hell was in that serum anyway?

I have to say, this was about the goofiest damn horror movie I've seen in awhile...I mean giant, killer rabbits?  I will say the makers of this film stuck to their guns and really tried to make this a viable vehicle, but there is absolutely nothing horrifying about cute, cuddly, nose wrinkling bunny rabbits.  Period.  The construction of the film was solid, and had they inserted a different type of creature (roaches, spiders, dogs, marmosets, vernicious kanids, etc.), it probably would have worked, but they saddled themselves with rabbits, for better or worse...here's my favorite line from the film...near the end, a deputy heads to the drive-in to get the assistance of the patrons in some master plan to stop the impending invasion, and this is what he says on the bullhorn..."" Attention! Attention! Ladies and gentlemen, attention! There is a herd of killer rabbits headed this way and we desperately need your help!""  And everyone believed him!  Oh bruther...I've never been a big fan of Whitman, even though he was a relatively solid actor who's career peaked in the 60s (he was nominated for a Oscar for his role in the 1961 film The Mark), as he generally brought so little to his later roles, here being no exception...and that girl that played his daughter...ugh!  I wanted to throttle her for her crimes against the profession.  She certainly wasn't the worst child actor I've ever seen, but her annoyance factor was very high.  And I love how she was never held accountable or felt even the slightest pang of guilt for her actions within the story, especially since she was the one responsible for the tainted rabbit getting loose.  In a perfect world, cinematically speaking, she would have been one of the first victims beset by the plague she introduced into the environment, one that claimed the lives of many.  As far as Janet Leigh, I just felt sorry for her...here's a woman who has appeared in one of the most memorable and influential shockers of all time (Psycho), now reduced to playing a bit part in one of the most laughable horror films ever made.  And another thing, both Whitman and Leigh seemed a bit long in the tooth to have a daughter as young as she was...anyway, like I said, there was some misguided effort put forth by the makers of this film to really try and make it scary, in terms of visual trickery.  Miniature sets were constructed to make it appear the rabbits where huge, along with close ups, quick edits, and chroma key shots.  There were a couple of scenes where the rabbits did indeed appear as large as they were meant to be, but hardly made them frightening, instead making them even more cuddly and lovable.  My favorite shots involved the guys dressed in rabbit suits, attacking the various townspeople.  The shots were very short, but it was still obvious they were men dressed up in bad rabbit suits, especially the one sequence where one hare gets hit in the head with an object by the person it's attacking, and the man in the suit instinctively raises his costumed hands to protect his costumed head.

The widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic picture on this DVD looks very sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital mono audio comes through very well.  The only extra available is a theatrical trailer.  The extras certainly are slight, but fans of bad movies will definitely rejoice at this film finally finding an official DVD release.

By the way, if you ever wanted to see DeForest Kelley in really bad polyester, here's your chance...also, if I learned anything from this film, its that people are not likely to stop and pick you up if you're hitchhiking down the road carrying a rifle...go figure...",1128729600,23,6462,4.963821892393321

I had to buy a bootleg from the master copy on e-bay for $30.00, now I can get DVD quality and convenience for half that!  I collect bad monster movies and this is best (just before Food of the Gods and Empire of the Ants)- I love giant animal movies,, and what is more odd about the attacking animal being an otherwise lovable rabbit!? Though HUnter reviewer I am certain is wrong.  The effects are actual rabbits thrown on obvious small reproductions of buildings mixed with close ups of rabbits and stick giant paws swatting at people.  What's funny is that the sound they make sometimes sounds like a lion or other viscious roar (also there is a weird girggling too).",1128729600,3,734,4.537878787878788

Night of the Lepus (William F. Claxton, 1972)

Night of the Lepus was Bill Claxton's first big-screen movie in eight years, and it turned out to be his last. This is no surprise for anyone who's actually seen Night of the Lepus, which is one of the most monstrously bad, unintentionally funny movies ever made. To call it a box-office bomb would be understating the case by a mile. And yet, it has a certain charm to it that is inarguable.

Screenwriters Don Holliday, who'd never written a screenplay that made it to the big screen before (and never did again), and Gene Kearney, who wrote some of Night Gallery's best shaggy-dog jokes (but also its single most boring episode, the melodramatic ""Silent Snow, Secret Snow""), took Russell Braddon's fantastic satire, The Year of the Angry Rabbit, and stripped it of all its humor, as well as transplanting it (for, one assumes, budgetary purposes) to the American southwest-- Ajo, AZ, to be precise. (Ajo is in the southwestern part of the state, roughly halfway between Tucson and Yuma.) Kearney, perhaps, should have realized that he's a better comedy writer than drama writer.

Your basic plot is this: a town sheriff, a University director, an environmentalist, and various hangers-on have to defeat a plague of mutant giant killer rabbits. Yes, folks, mutant giant killer rabbits. Now, that alone should be enough to sell you on the ""so bad it's good"" aspect of this film. But in case it's not, let me point out that the Sheriff is played by Paul Fix (The Sons of Katie Elder, Zabriskie Point, The Rifleman, etc.), the University director is played by DeForest Kelley (an in-demand character actor before Star Trek, Kelley would get no work outside the Star Trek franchise again until 1998), and the environmentalist and his wife are played by Stuart Whitman (Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines, Eaten Alive, The Treasure Seekers, etc.) and Janet Leigh (Psycho, The Fog, etc.). Also along for the ride are Rory Calhoun (Motel Hell, Hell Comes to Frogtown, etc.), Chuck Hayward (Parts: The Clonus Horror, Airport '77, etc.), I. Stanford Jolley (who had almost 250 films to his credit, but made only one more after this), etc. All of whom, no matter what their level of talent in anything else, absolutely stink here. As do the special effects, the sets, and just about everything else about this movie.

One special note needs to be made of the gratuitous use of repeated scenes and the incredibly bad editing work involved with them. For example, early on in the film, you'll be looking at the giant killer mutant bunny wondering what that odd red thing is by its foot. It makes sense to think it's a bloody head, until you see the same scene later on, in a wider shot, and realize it's an apple. Towards the end of the film, a scene of the rabbits storming down the road is seen, and it's obviously another piece of the same stretch of road from earlier in the film (the same house is on the corner), yet the rabbits are supposedly well out of town by this point.

It's little stupidities like this that turn Night of the Lepus from the kind of overly-crappy idiocy-fest that is, say, The Day After Tomorrow and make it into a classic of bad cinema. Would be very much worth adding to your video collection, were it at all available on video or DVD. * ",1124236800,7,3378,4.695945945945946

It's really not a five star movie in the sense of being a great movie artistically (far from it--), but it's just the thing for its genre - the drive-in movie. If you were seeing it at $5 a carload, even better. You'll enjoy it for its sheer audacity. I can only imagine what the giant rabbits would be like in today's technology - but the unsophisticated effects are part of this movie's appeal - at least for me.

We laughed and joked most of the movie. It isn't made to be a serious movie. Great to even watch with kids as there was little if any swearing, no nudity and the violence via the bunnies was so cheesy it shouldn't be taken seriously. We loved it, and we took shots every time a guy in a bunny suit attacked a person. One of the best and most unique horror films I own now. I'll have to track down the Mystery Science Theater version, I hear that is quite hilarious. While it literally isn't worth $20, the night of fun I had with my family watching this was.

2346358,5,B000A0GOGE,"I fell in love with this film the first time I saw it on TV and thought, how cool is that, killer bunnies!!!  Or.  When good bunnies go bad and attack horses, people, cattle, buildings............  I quite felt sorry for them when Rory Calhoun, DeForest Kelley, Paul Fix, Stuart Whitman, and Janet Leigh tried to exterminate the poor things.  Particularly when it was their fault to begin with that the poor bunnies ended up HUGE and unremorsefully belligerent.  I especially blame that rotten little girl for exchanging the test rabbits so she can keep one as a pet, the one injected with a serum that can cause birth defects, the one that gets away and lives to build its own guerrilla army of vengeful killer bunnies!!!  Those poor, much maligned bunnies were transported to the lab of Mr. & Mrs. Mad Scientist in garbage cans for pity sake!!!  Did PETA know about this?

The plot was lifted from Russell Braddon's 1964 Sci-fi novel The Year of the Angry Rabbit.  The producer (A.C. Lyles) and director (William F. Claxton) were better known for making westerns, hence the proliferation of western actors in the lead roles.  It's painfully obvious that everyone was out of their element.  I suppose from Claxton's point of view, if he was going to be embarrassed he wasn't going down alone!  He took everyone with him, all aboard the crazy train; we're about to crash big time.

In some alternate universe this is a masterpiece of filmmaking.  It is beyond bad.  The fact that they were all so deadly earnest makes this even more endearing.  A stampede of bunnies is not to be missed.  I count myself blessed to own a copy of this fabulous crap-fest.  Just the thought of it makes me smile.",1411689600,14,1693,4.662162162162162

And what makes Lepus so much of a hoot is just how dead serious this flick is. From the direction by William F. Claxton to the performances by it's veteran cast, including Stuart Whitman, Janet Leigh and a mustache sporting DeForest Kelley, Lepus really tries to present itself as a serious horror flick and that makes it all the more fun. From the slow motion scenes of real rabbits running through miniature sets to the close-ups of obviously fake, blood-soaked prosthetic rabbit claws and teeth, Lepus goes the whole way in trying to convinces us to be scared of the giant bunnies. Epic fail! There's even a guy in a rabbit suit jumping on the helpless victims. Seriously, how can you not love that! Whether they're growling like mountain lions or chewing up the locals, Lepus is a deliriously fun 'so bad it's good' treat. And there are a few bits of decent gore to boot. And if that's not enough to convince you, hold on to your hats for the military v.s. monster rabbit army at the climax. A sheer camp delight. Watched in the right mind set and with the right beverage, this is a great bit of schlocky 70s entertainment. Rated purely as delightfully schlocky cheese.",1362268800,,1276,4.600877192982456

2346428,2,B000A0GOGE,"Three years before JAWS attacked audiences world-wide, another diabolical beast was unleashed from the bowels of hell... Man's selfish attempt to control the rabbit population in Arizona turns deadly when an experimental hormone causes the animals to grow into giant-sized killers in NIGHT OF THE LEPUS! A film so baffling and benign that the distributors were forced to remove any indication of the furry critters from the marketing materials in order to dupe audiences into seeing it. The first question, of course, is ""How can you possibly make giant rabbits frightening?"", the obvious answer being that you can't. NIGHT OF THE LEPUS is ridiculous in its attempts to scare, generating nothing but laughs from start to finish. The rabbits are filmed up close in slow-motion and dripping with blood as they maul the locals, but they are only as cute as they are harmless. What makes things even more absurd is just how serious the film takes itself. Horribly mutilated bodies are left in the wake of the rabbits destruction after they hippity-hop their way through town. Most unbelievable of all is how professional the special effects and miniatures are handled for a film about giant killer bunny rabbits. Janet Leigh, Stuart Whitman, and Rory Calhoun deserve Oscar nominations just for withholding their laughter during filming. When it comes to unintentional humor, B-Movie fans can do no better than NIGHT OF THE LEPUS.

The actors in this movie were all fading a listers like rory calhoun , janet leigh , and stuart whitman, and  deforest kelly (may they all rest in peace) and they give their usual excellent performances and that takes alot of talent when faced with being in a movie about giant killer rabbits munching on people.

2346449,3,B000A0GOGE,"Loosely based on a 1962 novel THE YEAR OF THE ANGRY RABBIT by Russell Braddon, this very silly movie finds Stuart Whitman and Janet Leigh starring as a couple of zoologists who run afoul of giant killer rabbits in the American southwest.  Although described as ""a young couple,"" Whitman and Leigh were in their mid-forties at the time and they don't try to hide it.  Whitman phones in his performance; Leigh, who looks like she got hit by a Tammy Wynette truck, doesn't even try.  The cast is rounded out by Roy Calhoun as an irate rancher, DeForest Kelley as a unlikely university professor, and two remarkably untalented child actors named Melanie Fullerton and Chris Morell.

The story gets underway when Whitman and Leigh are called upon to figure out how to get rid of an overpopulation of wild rabbits that look supiciously like domesticated rabbits--a problem the script tries to account for by noting a recent and local mass escape of domestic rabbits that have enter the population.  Whatever the case, Whitman and Leigh try a few experiments, including some genetic modifications.  Unfortunately, their obnoxious child switches rabbits on them and then accidentally releases one of the modified ones into the wild.  By nightfall the rabbits have become great big things and are nibbling folks to death all over the place.

It would be difficult to count the follies included in this film, but the most notorious one is the rabbits.  Most of the time they are just regular bunny rabbits filmed hopping around on miniture sets.  There are a lot of close ups of rabbit eyes.  Very often rabbit faces are smeared with the same red syrup we find poured all over the so-called corpses.  This is obviously intended to be scary, but the rabbits seem more disgruntled than dangerous--and whenever the movie has to show a giant rabbit actually attacking a human this guy in a really bad rabbit suit suddenly jumps out.  The whole thing is rabbit-ridiculous, and along the way the rabbits are herded, burned, blown up and generally so harrassed that I began to side with them and wanted to call the ASPCA.  ""It's alright,"" Janet Leigh tells a rescued ranch hand after an attack.  ""The rabbit is gone!""  So is all possiblity of the viewer's suspension of disbelief.

Most bad movies are simply bad, but now and then you encounter one that is accidentally funny.  NIGHT OF THE LEPUS falls into this category, but it lacks the endearing quality of such so-bad-they're-good movies as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.  Maybe it's because you don't want to see the rabbits get hurt.  Whatever the case, when watching NIGHT OF THE LEPUS, remember that illicit substances make many things seem a lot funnier than they actually are.

To save a test rabbit from its demise the researcher's young, already blond, daughter Amanda (Melanie Fullerton) exchanges the rabbit with a control group rabbit.  You guessed it , now we have giant mutant fuzballs.  What is worse is that they come from the wrong side of the railroad tracks and cannot be allowed to mingle with the people on the other side of the tracks. I will not say what becomes of them but it is a shocking ending.

This 1972 quasi-sci-fi  film based on a book by Russell Brandon ""The Year of the Angry Rabbit"", has all the skill and pathos of a 50's sci-fi. They even throw in a flamethrower; you know the kind they use to fry giant ants and overgrown mantises.  They took the time to put it on DVD but no effort to remaster or at least clean it up a bit for the large screens.

The film contains some pretty big names for the time; this includes DeForest Kelley; you may remember him as Bones in the original Star Trek series, Janet Leigh from the ""Psycho""- shower scene, and Stuart Whitman from ""When Worlds Collide"" - as man by bank during riot instigation. Did I forget to mention Rory Calhoun; he needs no introduction.

2346489,4,B000A0GOGE,"Figured I'd might as well put in my two cents on the terrifying Night of the Lepus.  The ""Nature Strikes Back"" subgenre of the 70s is one of the most entertaining in all of horror.  It's almost never scary(Jaws being the exception to this), but it's so much damn fun.  Night of the Lepus is one of those that almost every horror fan is aware of and is usually the punchline of a lot of jokes.  Though it's always joked about, I think for the most part the movie is well liked.  As you already know, it concerns giant flesh eating rabbits(a hormone experiment gone awry) terrorizing the Arizona countryside.  This is a movie that'll be right at home next to your copies of Food of the Gods and Empire of the Ants.
Yes, it's a good time.  The silly concept alone will have you giddy from the getgo, but seeing all of this in action will definitely cause you to laugh out loud.
The visuals on the rabbits are both funny and impressive.  Footage of live stampeding rabbits are used and mixed with minatures, blue screen and rear projection photography(the type Bert I. Gordon uses for his giant monster opuses).  This approach, while funny, really doesn't look all that bad, not nearly as bad as you would expect.  Some shots are rather impressive.  Especially when you consider the budget and year in which this was made.  And hey, I don't care what anyone says, using real live rabbits adds a realism that you'd never get with an army of CGI rabbits.  As much realism as you can get with a concept like this, that is.  To make these rabbits seem more ferocious, close up shots have some of the rabbit's faces smeared with blood and/or drool.  They're also given a sinister growling type of sound.  The idea may have been to make them seem threatening, but it works the totally opposite way and makes it rather hilarious.  When you get down to it, I guess there really isn't a way to make rabbits scary or threatening.
My good friend Dave K. brought up a good point in his review.  The point being, was this film made to scare audiences?  That's a good question.  Common sense would tell you that there's no way to make this scary.  How did they pitch this idea to the producers?  I realize that this type of film was hot at the time, but someone had to say something!  How many takes did the actors have to do because they were bursting out laughing?  Unless director Claxton has a bizarre sense of humor, the intent definitely seems to be that this film was supposed to be suspenseful and scary.  The tone is straight faced from beginning to end.  This makes the movie all the more fun.  If it were made today, it'd be tongue in cheek like Black Sheep or something.  And how did Janet Leigh get suckered into this??
All in all, Night of the Lepus is a fun example of a fun genre(The Sci-Fi channel's ""Maneater"" series, which tries to revitalize the genre just doesn't come anywhere close.  This is a 70s genre, plain and simple.).  It's the type of film we just do not see anymore, so enjoy it while we have it.
And thanks, Dave K. for reminding me of it.",1223510400,,3054,4.401785714285714
2346490,4,B000A0GOGE,"Just when I've thought that I have seen it all I come across Night of the Lepus, which features hordes of killer rabbits. Yes you read that correctly killer rabbits. Movies like Night of the Lepus just wouldn't work with today's audience this is something that could only work in the pre-90s.

I've seen movies with all types of killer animals, but I can't say I have ever seen anything to feature killer rabbits. The concept of the movie is just flat out silly, but it's actually played straight, which is what makes this movie such a fun time. The rabbits are mutated and well it sure as hell ain't the Easter Bunny coming for a visit. These rabbits are out for blood!

The screenplay was written by Don Holliday & Gene R. Kearney, which was based off the novel Year of the Angry Rabbit written by Russell Braddon; having not read the novel I have no idea if the movie strays or not. The script by Holliday & Kearney isn't as bad as one might think. I mean the characters never really have anything smart to say at all, but they don't have the silly dialogue that most movies like this are known for. The script will never go down in history as one of the greats, but it's very much entertaining.

Director William F. Claxton keeps the pace moving at a pretty good pace there are a few slow moments, but Claxton always manages to keep the movie from getting boring. His scenes are actually played straight and make the movie so much fun. Shots of the rabbits on the attack and hopping along to kill are damn hysterical. Again the fact the movie is played straight really adds to the camp factor.

I often wonder when people make movies like this if they actually think it will scare the audience. I can't see anyone thinking mutated killer rabbits would make for a scary movie, but it does make for an entertaining one. Cult fan thought will surely love the movie for the campy and silly tone.  The cast is surprisingly decent with DeForest Kelley and Janet Leigh who was far removed from Psycho.

Night of the Lepus is a movie that could only work in another era and fans of silly Drive-In flicks this movie is for you. Mutated killer rabbits should sell the movie to fans of cult cinema. This movie delivers on the fun.

For ravanous killers, they sure are adorable, though. This is one movie that will make you cheer for the bad guy. How the bunnies run and grunt is so cute!!!!! Buy this one and enjoy. I can honestly say that there is not and never will be another movie like it.",1198022400,,688,4.3671875
2346515,5,B000A0GOGE,"Everything in this movie that some would complain about actually makes it so much fun.  Giant killer bunnies, Janet Leigh trying to pose as a young wife and mother...all of the absurdities join together for one fun film.  What makes it even more fun is the idea that the film makers set out to tell a serious story.

While it is not gory or graphic in the sense that modern films are, use discretion when watching with kids.  Since I was told that it was ""not scary"" at all, I let the kids watch it with me after we received it.  My daughter cried and my son curled up in a ball and I finally had to shut it off.  My kids may be oversensitive - but just know that it's no Disney movie and younger, sensitive kids may very well be scared by it.  Even my eleven year old was a little spooked by it.",1193702400,3,796,4.064102564102564
2346516,5,B000A0GOGE,"This is actually one of my all time favorite movies for no other reason than that is is just fun, plain old fun.

It is well acted, though a bit dated by the clothes, vehicles, and hair.  The stock footage at the beginning of the rabbit plagues in Australia is real, though the voice over was scripted for the movie.

Destruction of habitat, introduction of non-native species, and reckless killing of natural predators and prey do disrupt normal ecological cycles and create real life horrors, so that part is true to life.  Scientists have indeed experimented on using natural hormones, including growth hormones from the pituitary gland to control breeding in wild animal populations.  Such therapies do often create unexpected side effects like abnormal growth, visible tumors, and behavioral changes.  You have this type of research to thank for most modern day roach and rat poisons.  I would like to think that lab accidents never happened and no research subject ever escaped, especially one from the active group rather than the control group, but wherever humans are, human error is a possibility.  So there is nothing at all impossible about the premise.

With one or two exceptions, (men in bunny suits and bunny's running down a herd of stampeding horses), the special effects are realistic in a way CGI never will be.  They used real rabbits in a fairly decent mockup of the city.  The sound effect when the rabbit are present is supposed to inspire nervousness, but I find it oddly soothing.  Having grown up with a large hutch of bunnies, I spend a lot of time cleaning the hutch or just inside it playing with them and the rustling, chewing, snuffling sounds are pleasant, then add to that what appears to be a recording of a slowed down heartbeat and it tends to calm me right down.

The plot itself is plausible, up until the rabbits get camper trailer sized at which point gravity would cause them to collapse because their skeletal system would be inadequate to support them.  In addition, one must ignore the fact that rabbits are not carnivorous, and even at that size would not be able to get enough nutrients from meat travelling through their herbivorous digestive track to keep from starving to death.... unless of course they drank the blood. (Hmm, vampiric giant killer bunny rabbits..... Nah, don't give them ideas)

The movie is good clean fun, not scary, not gorey, not funny, just familiar and comfortable and .... well.... cute.  Enjoy it with an open mind.  It's honestly harder to believe that ranchers, scientists, and police would work together in a crisis in this day and age than to believe that extra large rabbits went on a rampage in the midwest.",1180569600,3,2689,4.823529411764706
2346517,1,B000A0GOGE,"I am very disappointed in this release. They deleted the best WORST parts of the movie. For instance, there was a scene when the rancher was being attacked. He and a guy in a rabbit suit crash through the window. They wrestle around on the floor and bed, basically fist-fighting each other. Then, the large rabbit is back outside next to the toy models again. It was one of the many reasons I couldn't wait to see this movie again on DVD! I can't believe MGM said, ""Wait! Before we release this, let's clean up the really bad parts first!"" Very disappointed, indeed. Otherwise, it's a 5 star C movie from the 70s. Did I mention, I was very dissapointed???",1170979200,60,655,4.466666666666667

2346520,3,B000A0GOGE,"There is something very refreshing about camp films that are not played for camp.  Someone makes a movie called ""Snakes on a Plane"" and it is obviously a joke, played for laughs, absurd and silly, and I guess that is the appeal.  This film, by contrast, takes itself seriously -- or, at least, pretends to take itself seriously.  They even take the trouble to explain why the rabbits don't look like wild rabbits -- a farmer who had been raising domesticated rabbits had his barn burn down, releasing several into the wild.  The closest parallel in film would be to Frogs!, which, believe it or not, had better production values than this film.  But this film is every bit as earnest -- and aims like Frogs! to use its simple premise both as the basis for semi-creepy thrills and to encourage reflection upon and illustrate real contemporary environmental issues, that find their basis in our ill-conceived efforts to make our ecosystems adapt to our agriculltural strategies rather than adapting our strategies to the ecosystems.  If you poison all of the coyotes, you are going to have an even bigger rabbit problem, that you can't solve by poisoning rabbits unless you want to poison the cattle too.

The film is never really scary and never plausible, but is a lot of fun if you are in the right mood.  Regular rabbits herding next to miniature sets, their faces splashed with dyed corn syrup; ""corpses"" without wounds but with ripped clothing and plenty of fake blood.  Dr. McCoy from Star Trek!  Janet Leigh from Psycho!  What more could you want? .... Okay, I guess you could want a few things -- like realistic effects, or an interesting subtext (I can only imagine what David Cronenberg around the time of Shivers would have done with this material) ... Still, it's refreshing to know that there was a time when ""message horror"" movies like this (and other quirky kinds of films that nobody could possibly have imagined would do more than do well with a niche audience) got made by major studios like MGM without the hope that they could be made into ""blockbusters"" that would make tens of millions on their first weekend.",1166313600,6,2131,4.732432432432432

Rory Calhoun had already shot his horse when it broke its leg after stepping in a rabbit hole.  That wasn't so odd, but the rabbits were just standing there snoofling around  while this all happened.  Except in stock footage of old rabbit roundups, ALL the rabbits in this movie were tame.  Everyone just picks them up!

Oh well.  As the other reviewers noted, it's so awful you cannot take your eyes off it.  Bunnies in slow motion with thick red stuff all over their cute bunny noses are a definite must-see.",1158969600,2,705,4.576

  well we hope so because this is one of the best comedys in years. the rabbits (running around doll houses and turning over matchbox cars)never come close to scareing anyone and the plot of (and here we go again)doctors are tring to help a farmer who is being ruined by the peskey rabbits(offical name they are known by is lepus,hay it sounds better for a horror movie than calling it ""night of the rabbits""). the doctors use any serum they can find to try to keep the little buggers from making more rabbits. well of course one gets loose and breeds a bunch of giant rabbits that also have a taste for meat.

  well enough of that, stuart whitman and janet leigh are the doctors and this must have been a bad year money wise for both, because money is the only reason i can think of as a reason to be in this turkey.

He gets a hold of a ""serum"" but does not know what the effects will be.  Add a little daughter who loves one of the test rabbits and a few unlikely occurrences and a test rabbit winds up in the general population.

All too quickly rabbits the size of wolves (that's what they keep saying in the movie but they are quite a bit larger) begin to overrun the area.  The researcher comes up with a way to stem the tide of fur but not before many people die.

I originally saw this many, many years ago on late night TV.  This DVD was gorier than I remember and really quite well done even if the writing was weak.  One really gets the sense that they rabbits are huge and deadly.  Some of the plot weaknesses are worse than others but my personal favorite is that the researcher who created the beasts is not held responsible and is treated as a hero.  One of the best giant animal films in terms of the animals really looking like giants.  Check it out.",1130803200,32,1119,4.280952380952381

The picture lacks of solid dramatic and narrative structure, and the sequences are repeated ad infinitum, the lighting work is terribly bad and the final device looks so far to be credible that it becomes a cartoon. On the other hand the film looked dated even to the date.

The transfer is very nice on the feature itself and the trailer is crisp and clean as well. The rabbits are a hoot at times and somewhat creepy at others, an odd mixed bag for sure with a ""western"" feel among all the scientific jibber jabber.  Doomed to fail at the box office, but utterly funny and entertaining none-the-less.  The rabbits sneering in the General Store after they take it over is worth the price alone. Janet Leigh and Rory Calhoun kicks some serious Cannibal Cottontail in this USA-up-all-night cheese-fest!  This movie could have been called The Cottontail Cannibal Massacre; That may have shaken MGM into their better judgement and make them think twice about greenlighting this one! For its official home video debut, Warner Brothers has done a fabulous job with restoring NIGHT OF THE LEPUS, presenting 1.85:1 widescreen and anamorphic. It actually looks like they care about this little bastard child of a movie! While there are a number of grainy spots, usually during outdoor scenes, the skin tones are accurate, colors bold and vivid, and the black levels are deep. All those cute little killer bunnies look great on the digital format, with nice detail and a clean image throughout the presentation. The mono audio is a little quiet during dialogue scenes, but the screaming bunnies and bombastic musical score is delivered nicely.
