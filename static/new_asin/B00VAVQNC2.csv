8709753,4,B00VAVQNC2,"This 1974 thriller (originally TANGO 2001) has the surefire trappings of grindhouse exploitation (sex, violence, drugs) but never found an American distributor after furtive openings in Athens, London and Rome. Its director was Kostas Karagiannis (1932-93), a Grecian counterpart to Roger Corman with long experience in feature films, television and video shorts. The original script, a good and symmetrical one by Lazaros Montanaris, pays direct homage to Michael Powell's PEEPING TOM, Martin Donovan's APARTMENT ZERO and to Patricia Highsmith's male-bonding suspense novels as insinuatingly filmed by Hitchcock and Ren Clment. There are just five players here: three needy (and gratuitously abused) women, two yin-yang joyboys of contrasting temperament--and three murders, two spontaneous and one the contingent, premeditated result of its predecessors.

The Hellenes famously invented variations in male bonding, and these two young Athenians are perfectly contrasted: Joachim, a nailbiting playboy wannabe with impotence and voyeurism issues, is played by Vagelis Voulgaridis (with the most screen time) as a cross between Michael Caine, Stephen King and Austin Powers, and his frenemy is Stathis, gigolo-pimp-drug trafficker to Athens' lowest social stratum. This shameless slimeball is played devilishly well by Greek superstar Lakis Komninos (""Larry Daniels""), modeling polyester jumpsuits of unparalleled ugliness (Joachim is kitted out in pricier Elvis leathers). Like Highsmith men, each covets his counterpart's assets, Joachim enabling and secretly filming Stathis' sexual conquests, Stathis continually goosing Joachim for easy money and cheap thrills. They symbolically dance a mutually decadent, perverse tango of pranks, mind games and murder, and their ongoing love/hate rivalry can only end in a neat final twist, borrowed from French art-film stereotypes, that wraps up each plot thread decisively.

Karagiannis frames this seamily in Italianate giallo style (there is no bloodletting, nor product placement for Scotch whiskey or audiotape recorders), with flashes of intense color in the decor and costumes, and only two sets, the louche Club Tango and Joachim's groovy bachelor villa, with revolving walls, topflight 8mm covert-filming apparatus and no shower curtain. There are minor continuity lapses that spoil the film's symmetry, but they're more endearing because this director really knows his stuff. Mondo Macabro have revived this three-star film respectfully in a full DVD presentation (four stars), a good subtitled print with bonuses. Watch this tango once for its titillating aspects (the simulated necrophilia is less entertaining than the quaint fashion modes, Athenian ashtrays and stylized decor), then again to appreciate how expertly Karagiannis elaborated this lurid story into a more artsy, cerebral film artifact with shapely vestiges of Hellenic cinematic style and irony.",1504742400,,2917,5.9263657957244655

8709757,3,B00VAVQNC2,"Tango of Perversion is an interesting movie. I kind of like it and don't all at once. The main plot is that a sleazy guy likes to peep and film his equally sleazy roommate sleeping with women. The roommate is too dumb to understand that's what's going on. He's too busy making sure his leisure suit is perfectly pressed to care anyway. They're living the dream until one day the roommate kills a girl on accident. It leads to the sleazy guy suddenly discovering dead girls can't say no. In a moment of supremely bad taste, the movie shows a surprising amount of good taste making the film 10 times creepier.

The movie tricks you into thinking you see more than you do and it's easy to do given the subject matter. However, it's lazy at the same time. Certain portions of the movie had a lot of thought go into them. It shows in the lighting, editing, etc. Other parts seem like they were filmed later in the production when the actors and everyone is just plain bored. The quality is just all over the place. It shows in the plotting too. You get the nastiness described above, which is frankly lazy yet effective, but it comes with an inventive plot structure that creates a rather oppressive atmosphere. You get no heroes here. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if this was intentional as other parts of the movie seem just like they are running through the motions to get to the murder and sex. Also, I get the weird feeling you're supposed to be somewhat on the side of the roommate or find him sympathetic. He's anything but. Still, I can't deny that they got some good moments here. It's just not consistent enough. It's a shame too because it's an incredibly odd plot that seems like it could've been more.

It's not a bad movie at all. It's just not the most consistent. Depending on your mood, you could easily bump it up a star.",1476057600,4,1833,4.4523809523809526

8709760,5,B00VAVQNC2,"Greek Exploitation? Admittedly I know absolutely nothing about this exotic genre. This just made me even more excited and eager to check out Tango of Perversion, the first in Mondo Macabro's new Greek Collection. Based on the DVD cover and the synopsis, I could tell that this film had the potential to rival the sleaziest films from around the globe. Luckily, I was right!

Tango of Perversion takes place at the Tango club, where folks of all types go to dance, score drugs, meet interesting people...you know the type of place. It also happens to be the the hangout of local hustler and drug dealer Stathis, who is getting sick of his junkie girlfriend. To spite him after a fight, she takes off with another woman which Stathis doesn't like and after a fight ensues, he accidentally kills his girlfriend's lover. He covers his tracks but what he doesn't know is his creepy, impotent friend caught the whole thing on film. As expected, blackmail, more murders and sex follow.

Well I am happy to report that the Greek world of 70's exploitation doesn't disappoint! Tango of Perversion (aka Tango 2001) is a far out, psychedelic, drug fueled, sex filled classic! There are plenty of beautiful women in various states of undress, a good amount of violence, hippies and just all around weirdness. The thing that struck me particularly by surprise was just how well written the film was. The plot was original and not just an excuse to show boobies. Mondo Macabro's transfer looks incredible for such an odd, obscure film and there is also a nice documentary on the history of Greek film.",1449532800,21,1587,4.788321167883212
