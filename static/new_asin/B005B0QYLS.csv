8463779,5,B005B0QYLS,"This DVD contains three stories based on books by Mo Willems.  They are...
The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog - The zany pigeon (played by Mo Willems is thrilled to find a hot dog the bus driver dropped, but a duckling (played by Trixie Willems) wants it too.
Knuffle Bunny Too - Two children have the same stuffed bunny, which leads to a horrifying mix up.
Naked Mole Rat Gets Dressed - Naked mole rats do not wear clothing--except for Wilbur.
There are three bonus clips which are behind the scenes interviews with Mo WIllems and the video producer.  These are mostly for adults.
Unlike most other DVDs in the Scholastic/Weston Woods story book series these stories do not 100% follow the books they are based on word for word.  They are the same story, but not the exact words from the book.  The videos are fun.  Mo Willems plays a lot of the parts himself, and he is quite a ham.  I was tempted to deduct one star because there are only three stories on the DVD.  Most Scholastic DVDs have five or six, plus bonuses.  However, these are so well done, and popular with children that I gave all five.  We have all the pigeon books in the library where I am the children's librarian, and they are very popular with children from all ages.",1481846400,,1232,4.392070484581498

They are only like 10 minutes long but the little ones get a kick out of it. Good lessons to be learned, quite entertaining for our 2&4yo. Would like to see more of the books available on DVD.

We intend to buy the books as well. We like the one-on-one attention while reading to our children while also getting them interested in reading and not just semi-glued to some tv (which we do not allow).",1474588800,,418,4.2125
