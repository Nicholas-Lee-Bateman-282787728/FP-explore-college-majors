8176545,5,B000NA6WEA,"I've only been swimming for a year after sustaining an injury during marathon training and have been working with an instructor to get my freestyle in order. She's also been helping me with breast and backstrokes, but backstroke was an enigma to me. I can swim 1000 yards freestyle with proper turns and bilateral breathing, but would be huffing and puffing to swim 25 yards backstroke. Nothing was working.
Then I got this video. No joke, within 1 week, I'm gliding like a pro to the wall with almost no effort. I know I sound like one of those cheesy studio audience members from an informercial, but I swear upon my life the system works. I can't do the turns yet and my speed is atrocious, but if your goal is to simply do backstroke without feeling like you're going to die, this is an excellent instructional video, and it was far cheaper than the lessons I've been paying for where I felt like I was spinning my wheels. Now that I'm getting comfortable on my back, I can work on speed later.  Definitely recommended for fitness swimmers new to the sport, but I can see how this would be a terrible video if you already know what you're doing and are looking for tips on who to swim the stroke more quickly.",1400371200,3,1213,4.439461883408072

8176547,5,B000NA6WEA,"We just returned from visiting relatives, and thus I have not seen all the DVD's received from Amazon.  However, the one I did watch on the computer seemed fine.",1279670400,,161,4.551724137931035
8176548,4,B000NA6WEA,"Amazing video, very well shot from different angles. Really helped me improve my back stroke in terms of speed and rhythm. The basic fundamentals such as kicking sideways, the rotation of the arms etc. are explained superbly",1257897600,2,224,5.081081081081081
8176549,4,B000NA6WEA,"I enjoyed this backstroke dvd but didn't find it a big change. Many of the tips inside are what a good coach would give. I've been swimming since 4th grade and, since the stroke hasn't changed much over the years, I didn't find many new ideas. I wish there would have been information about pushoffs and turns because those have changed quite a bit since my competition days. Terry's suggestions for visualizing your stroke (""lines on the ceiling"", etc.) are always very good, however.",1223164800,5,485,4.785714285714286
8176550,5,B000NA6WEA,"I bought the book. with this DVD, I can have more insight on how to swim like those swimmers that I saw in Olympic races. I have been swimming for 20 years, but without a coach I struggle on how to swim better. This DVD really helps me to teach myself with my own peace and in a more logical way to improve my style. Highly recommended for those who take swimmimng as a lifetime sprots.",1200787200,4,386,4.092105263157895
