8163834,3,6302246954,"This movie has without a doubt a ton of flaws. The story is no doubt contrived and quite fictionalized so I will give you this review of the movie alone and not the historical not-facts that are included. THis movie was made in 1983 so we also have to let the world know that, it was the 80's. Now Jan-Michael Vincent, I have always been a fan and am very sorry that his life took a downward spiral but here he does his best and I still loved him. The story involves the Nicaraguan insurgency in the 80's and as I said, historically I don't know what the real story was. My bad but I am a lover of older history not the more modern history. If you want an somewhat entertaining diversion on a rainy of cold Saturday afternoon.....here you go.",1506729600,,742,4.232394366197183

8163837,4,6302246954,"Last Plane Out chronicles real life events of  journalist, Jack Cox the war ravaged areas of South America in the 1980's.  A compelling story as he & his team fight to get out of the country.  Jan Michael Vincent & Julie Carmen were great as lovers caught in the middle of a war.  I hope this gets out on DVD someday.",1353715200,,317,4.147540983606557
8163838,3,6302246954,"Other than Dotson, these 3 other critics suck; there completely pointless!  None talk of the movie itself which is what I wanted an opinion of since I haven't seen it!  I first commented on the loser who blames Pres. Reagan, even though Reagan wasn't elected or sworn into office for another 1 1/2 years!  Read my comment to see what a blatant liar that fool is, will ya?  And comment?  I just had to write something, I couldn't let disinformation go unchecked.  Someone please view this flick and give an honest, quick, review, huh?",1328572800,,533,4.617021276595745
8163839,4,6302246954,"I will not comment on the movie itself, because I bought it as a gift for a friend and I haven't watched it; besides, some others already took care of that; this review and its stars, therefore, are about the actual tape and the seller's service and not the movie. Consequently, I can say that the tape was in good condition, just as stated by the seller. It was the right item, packed in a manila envelope; it arrived within the estimated timeframe and it played fine on a VCR. The cover art was different to the picture showed in this item's page. Also the tape didn't come rewinded; it would've been a plus if it did, mainly because we're so used to the easy life with Video Files, DVDs and BluRays now, that waiting for a VHS tape to fully rewind feels like an eternity. I'm very satisfied and very good service, nonetheless.",1273881600,,829,4.3896103896103895
