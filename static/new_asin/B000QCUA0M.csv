8446350,4,B000QCUA0M,"The name should be Smoky Mountain Wrestling Gold. 3 out of 4 discs are all Smoky Mountain Wrestling. Disc 1 is ""Before The Were Famous"", Disc 2 is ""Blood, Brawls And Grudges"" and Disc 4 is ""Night Of The Legends"". The third disc is from Ohio Valley Wrestling ""Wrestling Future Stars"".

The 3 Smoky Mountain discs have all the regulars from the short lived promotion. I enjoyed these matches having watched the promotion originally more than 10 years ago. Long time wrestling fans will appreciate these discs with legends like Dory & Terry Funk, Bob Armstrong, Randy Savage and the Rock 'n Roll Express. Jim Cornette gave his all to make this promotion a success but changes in the wrestling business and finances would eventually prove too much. Night of the Legends was their biggest show and has something for all wrestling fans. This disc alone is worth the price of the set.

The Ohio Valley disc showcases many WWE wrestlers before they made the big time. Current fans will enjoy seeing the current stars like Randy Orton, Batista and Shelton Benjamin. UFC's Brock Lesnar is teamed with his former college teammate Shelton Benjamin. Several more former WWE wrestlers are also featured such as The Bashams and Rob Conway.

A must for Smoky Mountain fans.",1231632000,3,1257,4.837209302325581
