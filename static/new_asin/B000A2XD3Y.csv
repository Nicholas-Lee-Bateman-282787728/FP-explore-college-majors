(Which this movie was based on.) This I could deal with for the price. The bigger problem is the writing runs right off the screen at times so you have to guess at what is being said.

 The next movie is in black & white. It is a low budget vampire movie from the forties. The movie centers around a doctor and his evil twin brother. The story was fairly entertaining and looked fine to me. I found this to be the best of the three movies.

 The final movie Chain of Souls is newer and is in color. The basic concept is Kyla goes to Hollywood looking to become an Actress. At an audition she discovers something sinister. Although that sounds like it could be good, it's really not. I was bored by this movie.

 So is this a good budget buy? As is, probably not. If they fixed the title cards to Nosferatu it would be.",1161043200,3,986,4.360655737704918
