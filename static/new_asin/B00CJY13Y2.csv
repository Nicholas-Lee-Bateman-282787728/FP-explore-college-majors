5724610,3,B00CJY13Y2,It is a good view of Ron's current life.  I would have like more history his current life is pretty boring.,1402358400,,107,4.095238095238095
5724611,5,B00CJY13Y2,"Very enjoyable. Love the way it's presented- definitely $ well spent....it's different than what you've seen before, specially on him & the horse that's already in books, videos & youtube.",1398902400,,188,5.3
5724612,5,B00CJY13Y2,"Amazing jockey with an amazing horse ~ great pairing of a beautiful story and time period. If you liked Secretariat, this is a must see to better know Ron, the jockey.  Loved it!",1396569600,,178,4.393939393939394
5724613,5,B00CJY13Y2,"I thought I'd seen every interview with Turcotte, but this documentary had several surprises. It was interesting throughout. Very worth seeing for Ron and Big Red fans.",1391990400,,168,5.2592592592592595
5724614,5,B00CJY13Y2,"...you'll really enjoy this film.  Lot's of additional information and some wonderful original footage.  And I enjoyed the peek into Ron's life, great upbeat attitude.  ""Ronny, don't fall off!""",1388275200,,193,5.586206896551724
5724615,5,B00CJY13Y2,"Loved this movie when I attended the Red Carpet event in Louisville, Kentucky, Derby week 2013.  Ron is such an amazying ambassador for the industry!!  Highly recommend this movie to all racing fans!",1387497600,3,199,5.0
5724616,5,B00CJY13Y2,"REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE,WITH RON TURCOTTE AND BIG RED.
WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO A FRIEND.
RON TURCOTTE,GOT TO RIDE INTO HISTORY,WITH THE GREATEST RACE HORSE,THAT EVER LIVED.",1379894400,7,180,5.464285714285714
5724617,4,B00CJY13Y2,"I truly enjoyed this program...Ron Turcotte was the legendary rider of Secretariat but also Riva Ridge the year before and winner of 3,000 races before he realized his greatest fear and was paralyzed. This program traces his career as a dual story line to his visiting the 3 races of a current triple crown season. It shows him interacting with current jockeys as well as fans. This movie also has great footage of Secretariat and current video of the owner Penny Chereny. Its a documentary that spans many decades and is heart warming and heart breaking and ultimately triumphant. Recommended

Tech stuff... 16x9 Widescreen and the current footage looks HD very nice indeed, with a lovely score.",1377820800,8,696,4.948717948717949

5724619,5,B00CJY13Y2,Secretariat is my favorite horse!  It tells the story of Ron Turcotte well!,1440979200,,75,4.769230769230769
5724620,3,B00CJY13Y2,Documentary only,1439683200,,16,7.5
5724621,5,B00CJY13Y2,"So many documentaries bore us with talking heads. Not this one. We get the drama of horse racing, and we  also go behind the scenes in the jockey's room,  and we meet Turcotte's family - this is so well done and engaging. We are not hit over the head with the obvious about how Turcotte deals with his disabilities, but allowed to feel the flow of his life as he copes so masterfully. Should be taught in film schools.",1438214400,5,418,4.2784810126582276
5724622,5,B00CJY13Y2,"What a shame such a competitive guy worked had to accomplish his goals only to be involved in freak accident.
He done a lot for the sport every since.",1437868800,,150,4.206896551724138

5724625,3,B00CJY13Y2,Interesting to learn a bit about the life of a jockey. Moves a little slow.,1435276800,,75,4.066666666666666
5724626,4,B00CJY13Y2,This is a real treat for Secretariat fans. Even though it is mainly about the Jockey Ron Turcotte you get a feel for his feelings and those of others involved with the Triple Crown winner Secretariat & his famous seasoned jockey.,1428796800,,229,4.609756097560975
5724627,5,B00CJY13Y2,Interesting to see perspective from jockey.,1428105600,,43,6.333333333333333
5724628,5,B00CJY13Y2,"The heartwarming and inspiring story of Secretariat's jockey, Ron Turcotte.  I saw this film at the 35th International Sport Film Festival in Palermo, Italy, where it won the Grand Prize (Best Feature Film) of the festival. A film to see and see again!",1422748800,,252,4.8604651162790695
5724629,2,B00CJY13Y2,"I was expecting this to be a biography but it is not. Essentially the filmmakers follow Mr. Turcotte on a trip where he visits other retired jockeys and attends the 2012 Triple Crown races. On the rare occasion where there is some historical race footage, it is interrupted by uninteresting commentary by Bill Nack and a few others. As a lifelong racing fan there was very little here to pique my interest.",1418256000,2,406,4.652777777777778
5724630,4,B00CJY13Y2,"This was an interesting look at Ronny and what he's been doing.  I do agree, a little more history would have been nice, there were some interesting facts that I didn't know before.  Overall, it was good.",1415404800,,204,4.486486486486487
5724631,5,B00CJY13Y2,Very informative and interesting. An important part of my collection of DVDs and books about Secretariat and the people involved with the horse.,1412985600,,144,5.304347826086956
5724632,1,B00CJY13Y2,Who cares about Ron going to the tracks and meeting other jokes and signing autographs?  Total waste of time and money.,1412812800,,119,4.666666666666667
5724633,5,B00CJY13Y2,Great,1411603200,,5,5.0
5724634,5,B00CJY13Y2,"What a beautiful, inspirational film. I especially loved the old race footage and Riva Ridge and Secretariat stories. Ron Turcotte is a new hero to add to my list: only a man with a heart this big could have ridden an equally huge-hearted Triple-Crown horse as  Secretariat.",1406505600,3,274,4.829787234042553
5724635,1,B00CJY13Y2,I thought that it was going to be about Secretariat.  I did. NOT expect a dvd on his current life and going to recent horse races.  ABSOLUTELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY.  I don't care what he is doing now.,1404950400,,199,4.051282051282051
5724636,5,B00CJY13Y2,"Secretariat..just an amazing and seemingly unbelievable..it's fictional cannot be true, but it is! I am just taken away with this real life story.
I love this",1404000000,,158,5.115384615384615
5724637,5,B00CJY13Y2,"Good video.....
I mailed it out for another fan of Secretariat....
Well put together, good video footage.
It should be in every fan's DVD library.",1402790400,,146,4.88
8582741,5,B00CJY13Y2,"Interviewer: ""What do you like?""
Ron Turcotte: ""What is it I like? To win.""

This documentary is a great insight on the winning mentality and culture behind the jockeys of the racetrack. A great watch for any fan of the track and overall just a quality sports documentary. 9/10 would watch again.",1521158400,,296,4.6923076923076925
8582742,5,B00CJY13Y2,This SO had great heart!  Just adored it!  Ron Turcotte will always be a class act in my book!  Beautifully done!!,1513468800,,114,4.333333333333333

8582744,5,B00CJY13Y2,"This is a great movie: not only to learn about Ron, but also to educate us all on how dangerous is the sport. I learned a lot after reading Seabiscuit, but this movie brings up the issues paralyzed from accidents. They are fearless, mostly not paid that well (except for the few gold members).",1500854400,,293,4.444444444444445
8582745,5,B00CJY13Y2,"I met Ron at a restaurant in Van Buren, Maine.  Truly a humble gentleman with a fascinating and inspiring story.
His hard work and dedication to the sport made into a well told story.",1496102400,2,183,4.382352941176471

8582747,5,B00CJY13Y2,"Extremely good.  In this documentary, I got to see the different important tracks.  I got more of an understanding of jockeys' situations.  I got to see Mr. Turcotte, Secretariat, and so many people wise about racing.  I bred my yearling thoroughbred the way that I did in part because of the sound bloodlines that led to Secretariat.  I understand what makes a sound, fast horse but I've never been to a race track for a horse race because there were no race tracks in my home town.  I needed the information this documentary gave me.",1471305600,3,535,4.578947368421052

8582749,5,B00CJY13Y2,"We watch and read just about anything we can find about Secretariat, and this documentary is one of the most informative resources we've found.  It's an extremely well-done documentary from a production standpoint, which makes it enjoyable to sit and watch.  But the real value is in all the information it presents; the footage, interviews, and people who comment on Ron, Secretariat, and Riva Ridge.  It's full of first-person deep insights.  We gained lots of perspective into a wonderful racehorse and the very special people who made the Secretariat team so excellent.",1460246400,5,573,5.195652173913044
