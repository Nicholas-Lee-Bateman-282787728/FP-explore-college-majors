968649,5,6305072051,"I haven't seen these Little Bear episodes since my daughter was 4 (she now 12)I was so happy that I bought a Kiss for Little Bear. They are so cute and funny. Simply delightful. The first episode Mr. Skunk wants a kiss but no one will give him one until the end when mother bear kisses Mr. Skunk for delivering Little bear's drawing to her, the next episode Duck wants a kiss from a frog to turn him into a prince but the frog wants to stay a frog. Duck asks will anyone kiss her? Mr. Skunk kisses her. Then asks for the kiss back so he can give to little bear. This starts off a game of kissing tag. The story end with Mr. Skunk finding Miss Skunk and both of them asking if they want to get married. the episode Mr. Skunk and Miss Skunk VERY cute. The episode is a Valentine one and little looking for his secret admire who ends up being mother bear. TOO CUTE

Ok I must say this there is no more advertising any other kids video. I fast forward thought the advertising. It not that big of a deal. When you buy any video ther going to be a ton of advertising. That not a reason to put a video. And the video does have tracking problems but Was so able to fix this through my vcr.",1145059200,,1181,4.025531914893617

I have not noticed a problem with the picture quality on either of the tapes we have.  We will be purchasing more Little Bear movies, now that Nick Jr and Noggin are no longer showing Little Bear for somestrange reason.

968653,5,6305072051,"This is by far the favorite Little Bear video of both of my sons.  Our favorite segment is ""Gingerbread Cookies"" in which the gingerbread cookies come to life and take off on an adventure of their own!  My eldest son and I saw it when he was home sick one day and I have looked for it to appear on a video ever since- it was worth the wait!  It is a magical segment that keeps my boys laughing from the minute it starts!  The other segments are fun as well.  This is a treasure to have and to own!",1041552000,6,497,3.93
968654,5,6305072051,"One of the best, if not THE best Little Bear episodes video. (vs the Little Bear Movie, which is wonderful). The episodes are charming, endearing, humorous and absorbing! Really delightful. Even for me as an adult to watch. And my 2 and half yr old son can't stop watching it! Watches, rewinds, watches again over and over. And he has a boatload of videos, of every kind as well as other little bear videos. As for the amount of advertising, I agree with the other reviews that it is too much --BUT ALL the videos these days do that (unfortunately and unfairly I think) --Disney is one of the worst! SO I don't hold that against Little Bear. (I just make a note on the video box how far in the show begins and cue the tape to that spot everytime I rewind.)",1005782400,,756,4.293706293706293
968655,5,6305072051,"Like all of the Little Bear videos, this charming collection of four seasonal tales is so good that it almost justifies watching TV instead of playing outside in the falling leaves!  These stories are about kids just being kids (or rather, animal kids just being animal kids):  exploring, playing with friends, laughing, and using their imagination to make up playful games with eachother.  In this way, they are like A.A. Milne's original ""Winnie the Pooh"" stories, in which the characters' games and discoveries are the main attraction, and we come to love the characters not despite their flaws but because of them.  And, in the Little Bear stories, mom and dad are supportive presences, mirroring the real world in which mom and dad are usually the most significant people in young children's lives.
My 3-year-old daughter loves the stories, and all other Little Bear videos.  The stories are neither too simple, nor too complicated.  Similarly, the action unfolds at the perfect pace for young kids, neither too sluggish nor too fast.  Little Bear won't insult your kids' intelligence, and you may enjoy them yourself, too!
Unlike so much of TV/movies for kids, the Little Bear stores are not about conflicts with bad people [who, invariably, are bad for no reason other than to move the plot along (e.g., the wicked queen or stepmother, etc.)], or are about loud-mouthed kids who argue with eachother and avoid adults at all times (Rugrats and the like).  I recommend all of the Little Bear stories, and the Little Bear show on Nicklelodeon, for any parent who wants a positive alternative to the brain-rotting noise that one usually finds on TV.
Hurray for Little Bear!",996537600,5,1676,4.960714285714285
968656,5,6305072051,"This is one of the gentlest and most endearing videos that my 2-1/2 year-old son has in his burgeoning collection.  It doesn't feature loud characters or music, just sweet story-telling.  As Little Bear himself  would say, ""Interesting.""",956534400,12,237,5.351351351351352

From what I have  read, there should be one more in this set but I have not been able to find out anything about it. These are very good and are a delight to have. I hope that I can find the last batch someday. I will now include the menu for this one. That has been my only complaint and so I have added that to all of my reviews. They are as follows: Gone Fishing - Little Bear's Bath - Little Bear's Mermaid - Building A House For Emily - Emily Returns - Play Ball - Lucy's Okay - School For Otters - Little Bear's Sweet Tooth - Marbles - The Great Race - Sand Castles - Balloon Heads - Thunder Monster - Rainy Day Friends - A Kiss For Little Bear (three
episodes) The Painter - The Kiss - The Wedding -Magic Lemonade - Something Old, Something New - How To Love A Porcupine

969071,5,6305072051,"This is the second of this series of Little Bear DVD's that have 22 episodes on it. The first one was impressive and so I got this one next. I was a little disappointed that it did not have a list of the episodes but at the price I figured I could not go wrong. I listed all of the episodes from the first one I bought so I thought I would do the same here. I would have liked to have known what was going to be on the DVD. So here are a listing of episodes.
Father Bear Comes Home - Fishing With Father Bear - Grandfather Bear - Hiccups - Date With Father Bear - Pudding Hill - Father's Flying Flapjacks - Family Portrait - The Goblin Story - Little Bear's Trip to the Stars - Little Bear's Surprise - The Campout - Little Bear's Kite - Spring Cleaning - Whale of a Tale - Monster Pudding - Pillow Hill - Top of the World - Father's Day - Silly Billy - In A Little While
I hope this info is helpful to potential buyers. It did not deter me but I would like to have known what was on the DVD and it is not listed on the box either. The quality is good and the only thing I questioned was the fact that the opening music is different from what we see on Nick Jr. This is really a great buy for Little Bear lovers and I plan on buying more.",1405296000,26,1238,3.83984375
969152,5,6305072051,"Me and my family love Little Bear and when I saw these DVDs with 22 episodes on them I wanted to try them. I did wonder which episodes were on it but it was not listed. When I received the DVD it did not show the episodes anywhere on it either. I plugged it in and wrote down all of the episodes, so I will list them for any interested parties.
Emily's Visit - The Rain Dance Play - Little Bear Magician - Bigger Little Bear - Little Red Riding Hood - Little Scarecrow Bear - Blueberry Picnic - Granny's Old Flying Rug - Little Bear Sing A Song - Mitzi's Little Monster - The Red Thread - Princess Duck - Who Am I - Circus for Tutu - Goblin Night - Duck Soup - Little Goblin Bear - Picnic On the Moon - Hat Parade - The Sky Is Falling - The Greatest Show In The World - Little Bear Scares Everyone
We watched a few of the episodes that were not so familiar, that are not shown everyday on Nick Jr. and they were good to see and the quality is good. The only complaint I had was that the opening music that we are used to hearing is not the same. I don't know the explanation for that but it is not too distracting. My grandson did notice it right away though. I think this is a great deal and I have already ordered another DVD and plan to get all of them.
