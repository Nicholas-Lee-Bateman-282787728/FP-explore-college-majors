It was with great anticipation that I had been waiting for any sign of Cantinflas on DVD for about 5 years now. I had given up, until Dec 1 2003 when I found this DVD bundle on Amazon.
If you're reading this, I'm assuming that you've already seen the movies and you know how funny Cantinflas movie's are. So I won't go into detail about the movies themselves. They're all hilarious and they're all vintage Cantinflas. The golden age of Mexican theater.
About the technical aspects of the movies. Unlike what the info says, all movies are in Spanish, with English subtitles. The quality of the movies is very good, but don't expect Lord Of the rings DVD quality. Which is normal for movies made for that era that have been ported over to DVD. You'll see details that you never noticed before. Eye Colours, people in the background, vivid and colourful backgrounds.
The sound quality is good, although only in mono but in Dolby digital.
The movies are all in widescreen format, which is great, because for the first time you'll be able to see all of the scenes the way they were originally made.
Will you enjoy these movies if you're not a Spanish speaking person? Chances are yes, I read the subtitles while I was watching the movies, and most of the time, I found the humor translated fairly well. Sometimes, the translation was even funnier that Cantinflas original comments. Alot of time was put into the translation, it was very well done. You'll need to have an open mind though, don't expect Jim Carrey type of humor.
All in all, a great DVD package. I highly recommend it, well worth the money.",1071619200,64,1722,4.686468646864687

7997974,5,B0000B1A3W,"I rate this product in the best way possible because you simply do not come across these great movies of Cantinflas anymore these days in stores.  They are simply classics, that display true comedy in its purest form.  The fact that it was brand new, and came in a convenient pack made this product even better to give as a gift and to savor those old comedies again, and to see Cantinflas's crazy antics, and silly humor once again.  Truely hilarious and truly a great product!! The seller, overall, made this product even more worthwhile because it came in quickly.  Just the way any shopper would like it.  Truely an awesome product and outstanding job from the seller! Muchas gracias!",1353974400,,688,4.7

7997976,5,B0000B1A3W,"I bought these dvd's for my father who was ill and bedridden in a hospital, along with a portable dvd player from Amazon as a Christmas gift(arriving on time, at the right location).  What a way to spend Christmas right?  Well they say the best cure is laughter and he was able to laugh his way out of the hospital!  Thank you as you made an old man very happy during trying times!  Cantinflas...may you rest in peace knowing that you can still bring such joy and pure laughter after many years of being deceased.",1311379200,,513,4.368421052631579
7997977,5,B0000B1A3W,"I grew up watching Cantinflas with my dad.
Now i'm old enough and have bought my dad the entire collection of Cantinflas, including this set. It is amazing.

The quality is great, if you're into old fashioned movies.  Don't expect spotless filming or audio because it won't happen.

I am now going to purchase this set / collection for myself.

Will not allow my children to grow up without Cantinflas!! He's a must-see for any generation!",1242604800,10,439,4.7368421052631575
7997978,5,B0000B1A3W,"These Cantinflas movies were a gift for my father-in-law for Fathers Day.  Although these movies often appear on late-night Spanish language television, I knew that he had expressed an interest in owning the complete set that he'd seen advertised on an infomercial, so I was happy to purchase these for him.

To English speakers, these movies might be unfamiliar, although viewers of the classic original ""Around the World in 80 Days"" will recognize Cantinflas as ""Paspartu"".  Maria Moreno ""Cantinflas"" was a comic genius and these four movies show him at his best.",1225411200,7,565,5.119565217391305
7997979,5,B0000B1A3W,"DVD Just too good, the only think the price is too much very high price, is there other places to buy cheaper at $5.69 each dvd, same quality.",1121731200,10,142,4.107142857142857
7997980,5,B0000B1A3W,"If you love Cantinflas like me or just have some young kids who love great cartoons (I'm 22 and still love them) you'll be excited to know that ""The Cantinflas Show"" educational cartoon show in which Cantinflas travels the world, meets famous artists and inventors, etc. It's a fanatstic series and should be released by the end of the year. I believe Wallmart will be the first to sell them but lets hope Amazon picks them up quick!",1087171200,5,433,4.564102564102564
7997981,5,B0000B1A3W,"I was so excited to see these classic films in widescreen format, I had to get them. I wish Movie distributors would do this more often. I like to collect classic Mexican movies and I always like to watch them the way they was meant to be watched.
Now that VHS players are becoming obsolete, I hope they start putting more of these movies on DVD.
Great films!!!",1072224000,7,361,4.323529411764706
