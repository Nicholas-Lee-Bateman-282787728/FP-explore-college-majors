If you love Naruto or if you are just getting into Anime. The story line was very great and it was very funny in a lot of the parts, since the characters had a personality switch.

5729630,5,B00CMKMO1E,"I won't review the storyline.  I think many of us give away the story, and it diminshes the reader's experience since he didn't take the journey freely.  If you KNOW Naruto, You already know the quality of the writing, characterization, so my telling you it's great isn't really necessary.

For a story synopsis, look to the Amazon review itself.  I will say this, if you are hesitant to buy a non-dubbed International DVD because you are concerned about quality, I WAS.  I say was, because this DVD and Naruto Movie 8 from the same vendor convinced me that we don't need to be worried about THIS vendor and this DVD set.

This DVD has beautiful color, tone and production values.  Playing it on either my upscaling DVD player or my upscaling Blue Ray Player - it looks sensational either way on my Television. I also had concerns about keeping up with the story since I had to read the sub titles, but this also was not a problem.  The subtitles are easy to read and keep up with the story and picture.

The seller sent the package on the day of the order, and it arrived 2 days later.  Honesty, speed and integrity, what we all want in our vendors.",1377302400,,1150,4.433333333333334
5729631,5,B00CMKMO1E,Great movie! Obito/Tobi sends Naruto and Sakura to an alternant world where things are a little different. Sakura is popular thanks to her dad and Naruto finally gets to know what it is like to live in a family. Awesome movie to add to your Naruto collection!

5729632,4,B00CMKMO1E,"I like anything Naruto Shippuden, this added a new dimension to the current manga storyline so I enjoyed it.  It's not quite as good as some of the other ones like ""Will of Fire"" or ""Bonds"".",1375574400,,190,4.277777777777778

8583479,5,B00CMKMO1E,I've been wanting to see this movie for months but couldn't find anywhere online to watch it. Finally found it on Amazon and for only $10 I had to get it. Came in earlier than expected and safely packaged. By far my favorite Naruto movie so far. I plan on ordering the rest of the Naruto movies from Amazon soon :D,1400025600,,314,4.163934426229508
8583480,3,B00CMKMO1E,"I'll review only the object and I'll not make a comment to the film (that I liked so much!).
The DVD comes in a very nice glossy paper slipcase but you won't find anything else except the DVD inside.
The video quality is average but the audio it's only in 2.0! So no 5.1 as other english naruto's DVDs.
Subtitles are available in English, Japanese and Malay.

I would suggest you to search for the English, non international, version hoping at least for the better audio quality.",1399075200,,479,4.505747126436781
8583481,4,B00CMKMO1E,"The movie is good, probably the best one so far, only complaint is that the box was cracked when it arrived, fortunately the dvd was in perfect condition. The quality is not great, it's decent, but that is about what you can expect for a dvd. I will order the movie again once it is available on blu-ray.",1399075200,,304,4.258620689655173
