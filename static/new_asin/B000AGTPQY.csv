While this program has been repackaged to strongly advertise that ""John Wayne"" stars in this movie, along with Tim McCoy, he has only a minor part.  Tim McCoy stars in this movie and if you like him as well, great.",1361232000,,291,4.2727272727272725
8078513,4,B000AGTPQY,"I saw an advance showing of this film locally where it was filmed.

What stood out for me is the impact of the very real locations where the gritty action takes place.

  Actor Jason Sabala with his tattooed and scarred body is a very imposing character in the film.",1122768000,5,266,4.36734693877551
