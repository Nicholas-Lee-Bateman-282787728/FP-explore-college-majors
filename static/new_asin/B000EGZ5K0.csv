A number of these are better than one might expect, considering that some are from before the Michelle Kwan era when it might be assumed skating was simpler.  Standouts include the wonderful, at times delicate and delightful, and in no wise simple skate by Peggy Fleming, which illustrates why she justly remains in the top ten skaters of all time.

Judy Blumberg and Michael Seibert (who? -- they won five US titles!) are thrilling, as Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner, who also won five US titles, are terrific.  By contrast, Rudy Galindo, despite the over-the-top enthusiasm and effusive praise by the commentators, is undistinguished, and sloppy.  Certainly, politics aside, there were superior choices passed over.  But Tanith Belbin and Benjamin Agosto are more than adequate compensation for that yawner.

Then there is the beautifully skated short (alas!) program, to her touchstone ""East of Eden,"" of Michelle Kwan: sublime -- light, gentle, flowingly lyrical, feminine, as always, and joyful.  The Peggy Fleming and Michelle Kwan skates are at least two of those one is drawn to watch more than once.

The video is at least as good as can be expected, and as the technology evolves the sound is surround on surround systems.  But unlike the subsequent two volumes, if one chooses not to ""Play All"" but to play any one, the result will be that he one selected and all subsequent to it will also play; not a big deal: the disc responds to the remote's ""Top Menu"" button.",1292284800,6,2239,5.090163934426229
8109597,4,B000EGZ5K0,"I have all three volumes of this series so my reviews of them are all the same and pretty generalized. The series presents performances by the really well-known and, ""who?"" skaters from US Nationals over the years. They are a mixed bag. I found myself in rapt attention with a number of them and others I either thought, ""that's nice, we'll call....NEXT!"", and a few did not get viewed because I didn't like the skater when they were on the scene and really didn't care about them. Interesting things to note, Dick Button is rather quiet in the early year clips and you can track his increase in verbosity if you play the clips in order of their years. Another, the decline of artistry and edge work as the years go on. The DVDs have a very easy menu format in which the individual skater's tracks come up as a list when you start the DVD so you can pick and choose your own order, rather than having to use the ""menu"" button constantly. It's not a bad set to own and doesn't bore with repeated viewings so, in the end, I recommend buying it.",1260835200,9,1042,4.348717948717948
