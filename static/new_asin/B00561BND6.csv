8459041,3,B00561BND6,"HOw bizarre to see this forgotten British feature in BluRay!  Many more popular and better-known movies deserve the Bluray transfer than this one.
A box office bomb in the domestic (UK) market, the movie WAS successful everywhere else--Including, to some degree, the U.S.despite the fact that its star, Dirk Bogarde wasn't well known outside England at the time, and the 1957 movie was already three years old. Should have played up the ""Best Seller""angle as the story was taken from the very successful Hammond Innis adventure novel.

Set in the oil fields of Alberta, Canada, it was actually filmed in Italy and the UK simply because travel costs were too high and--I suspect--very few people in Canada had the experience to provide film crews. Unlike today, where all sorts of film crews (and CGI gangs) are busy in Ontario, Alberta and BC on a constant basis.  It's only taken 70 years!

An okay movie, but hardly memorable.",1523318400,,928,4.89171974522293

8459044,5,B00561BND6,"I remember reading this book while at school and just loved it and when it was made into a film I thought they kept pretty much to the story of the book. If you have not seen this film I know you will enjoy it. It is about Bruce Campbell a young Englishman who was told that he had an incurable illness and thought he would visit Canada to see his grandfather's inheritance. Here he wanted to spend the last few months of his life,His Grandfather believed there was oil on his property. And of cause oil came before the dam. Therefore he prevented Morgan to finish building a dam and flooding Campbell's Kingdom.  The dam was part new hydro-electric scheme. There are twists and turns and a great finish. Don't miss the excitement. Watch the film.",1370563200,,747,4.452554744525547
8459045,4,B00561BND6,"I recently purchased Campbell's Kingdom. I have never seen this movie before. It was strange seeing a British cast in this type of movie. It was like watching a Hollywood B movie from the 40's. The movie is about a man who thinks he's dying played by Dirk Bogarde, tries to strike it big in oil before he goes. His character who's ilness is played up way too much, I found annoying. The story is predictable man meets girl, likes her, other man played by Michael Craig, who by the way is the only bright spot in this movie, also likes girl. But because Dirk is the star, he gets her, the 2 men become friends and go for the oil dream. Stanley Baker plays the villian, who's ok in the role. There's a big ending where of course Dirk is the hero. It's a pretty good movie overall.
  As for the dvd itself, it's suppose to be digitally remastered, but there are a couple of spots in it that look like you are watching it on a computer. I's a whole lot better than most old Brit movies that go to dvd.",1329091200,3,997,4.160621761658031
8459046,5,B00561BND6,"Not that I like Dirk Bogarde and Stanley Baker - which I do -, but this is a very intriguing movie: half anti-corporate ecological disaster movie, half pro-oil-drilling tract. Those who agree with the ""drill, baby, drill!"" ethos might be upset with this movie's anti-corporate message. The Greens will surely be annoyed with the way this movie handles a subject that ""There Will Be Blood"" made something completely different of. This movie is about 19th century, Victorian individualism: liberalism with a social conscience. Or, Ron Paul with aunts (watch the movie and you'll see why). All in all, VCI did a very good job in bringing out this picture. It's a good British western of sorts, totally refreshing.",1328400000,2,710,5.02542372881356

8459048,4,B00561BND6,"VCI Entertainment and The Rank Collection presents ""CAMPBELL'S KINGDOM"" [Blue-ray] (1957) (102 min/Color) -- Starring: Dirk Bogarde, Stanley Baker, Michael Craig, Barbara Murray, James Robertson Justice, Athene Seyler, Robert Brown, John Laurie, Sid James, Mary Merrall, George Murcell, Stanley Maxted, Gordon Tanner

Directed by: Ralph Thomas

VCI has restored and brought from their vaults another great film from the British Invasion.

A strong British cast assembled for filming abroad. Bruce Campbell (Dirk Bogarde) inherits ""Campbell's Kingdom"" in the Canadian Rockies on the death of his grandfather. He has been diagnosed with an unspecified terminal illness and decides to see if he can find the oil that his grandfather believed was present on his land, and to clear his family name; his grandfather had wrongly been found guilty of fraud when his oil exploration company went broke. Owen Morgan (Stanley Baker) is the boss of a company that is constructing a dam that when complete will flood the ""Kingdom"". It's a race against time to prove that the oil is there before the dam is completed.

All the supporting cast give their best and Dirk Bogarde of course is excellent! --- it has some familiar faces in it. Sid James of course was in Hell Drivers playing a truck driver,with Stanley Baker,who was the hero but, in this one he is the baddie, as he was in Checkpoint which also starred James Robertson Justice who was in the Doctor films with Dirk Bogarde.

8459049,4,B00561BND6,"The Amazon synopsis for this movie is entirely wrong.  ""Campbells' Kingdom,"" which is one of my favourite films, stars Dirk Bogarde as a dying man, or so he believes, who goes to Canada to live out his remaining days with his Uncle.  When he arrives in Canada, however, he finds his Uncle dead, and Stanley Baker attempting to take over his Uncle's land.  The problem, you see, is that his Uncle believed that his land was rich with oil, while Stanley Baker is working for a company that is building a dam that will mean flooding ""Campbell's Kingdom.""  The plot then revolves around the race to find oil before Baker can start flooding.  Whilst this is not a ""great"" movie in the true sense of the word, it is nevertheless one that I have enjoyed watching countless times over the years, and any film that has that kind of appeal is worth at least four stars in my book.

The Amazon synopsis says that the film concerns the Cypriot struggle for independence, and whilst that storyline rings a bell, it is most definitely not ""Campbell's Kingdom.""  The only movie I can think of that resembles the Amazon synopsis is ""The Seventh Dawn"" starring William Holden, which concerns Britain's struggle against Malayan Communists in the early fifties, and, if I remember rightly, has William Holden falling in love with Capucine, or was it Susannah York?

Just for the record, a true English version of ""Campbell's Kingdom"" has just been released in England by Network, and is available from Amazon.co.uk (albeit in a full screen,as oposed to a widescreen, version).",1246233600,11,1557,4.7835820895522385
