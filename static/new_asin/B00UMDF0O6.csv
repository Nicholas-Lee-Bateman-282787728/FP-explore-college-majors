7052402,5,B00UMDF0O6,I am awestruck by the photography and situations they were able to capture.  It's an amazing series and I am going to savor each episode.,1467417600,,137,4.48
7052403,5,B00UMDF0O6,"awesome filming, narration and all around amazing movie.  My kids love it and watch it over and over again - they learn so much from it!",1465344000,5,136,4.230769230769231
7052404,5,B00UMDF0O6,"I'm not sure how they do it, but they continue to amaze.  I've been a nature lover all my life & thought I'd seen everything, but they find the most exotic & incredible.",1464307200,6,169,4.121212121212121
7052405,1,B00UMDF0O6,"Actually the series itself is wonderful. I saw part of it on YouTube and then bought it so that I could see the whole thing. No, what is awful is that it won't play on my DVD player. I've looked at other reviews for the BluRay edition and found that there are also complaints that it will not play. So, if it plays on yours great, but apparently there's something very wrong with some of these DVDs. I will sadly have to return it.",1463961600,2,431,4.142857142857143
7052406,5,B00UMDF0O6,"The BBC has done it again and I'm completely thrilled with the result. I've gotten hooked on these BBC Earth Blu-rays since picking up Planet Earth to show off my 1080P Flat Panel. And while some of them are definitely better than others this one is wonderful and easily one of the better ones. Life Story does it all make you laugh, want to cry, thrill you, awe you and catch you up in the excitement. I've already watched it twice and see myself watching it many more times so you will get more than your money out of this one.",1462665600,7,529,4.247524752475248

7052408,5,B00UMDF0O6,"First BBC documentary shot in 4K I believe.  We watched in Blue Ray HD which was still awesome -- but we've come to expect this from BBC and David Attenborough.  Having watched the major ones that star that combination, what we didn't expect was some of the scenes and stories from this one (including the absolutely spectacular first story about the barnacle goslings jumping off a cliff -- won't say more).  As an aside, whoever you are, if you're David Attenborough's physician, you have a duty to humanity and nature to keep this gentleman alive for at least 25 more years.",1459296000,40,577,4.693069306930693
7052439,5,B00UMDF0O6,"Like every other BBC nature documentary featuring Attenborough (Planet Earth, Life, the Hunt, etc.), this presentation is a stunning victory. Makes perfect viewing for anyone who enjoys wildlife.

Question: am I mistaken, or have we seen the opening scene featuring the geese before? Upon viewing, I had serious deja vu. Isn't this on another Attenborough recent release? Can anyone assist me on this?",1504310400,3,401,5.365079365079365

8707447,3,B00UMDF0O6,"The photography is wonderful (five stars).

But the dogmatic emphasis on life's ""winners"" being those who pass along their genes seems to me outdated, as a life-long lover of natural history and biology even having taught biology and yes, having passed on my genes to progeny. It seems to me a disturbingly limited stance on the extraordinary diversity, beauty and expressiveness of nature in all its forms and perhaps a trivializing of species other than our own, and of art, and feelings, and love of various kinds. The generosity and care by animals who contribute to their groups even on the lowly level of the slime mold individuals who in a crisis group together to shoot brethren off into the air to find better territory at the cost of their own lives, on the massive level like elephants all working together to save one individual's baby stuck in the mud, the worker ants supporting a colony themselves childless, are all written off by this stance. Perhaps the neo-Darwinian will respond that these groups share genes. But what are genes other than extraordinary, yes, but in effect simply complex cookbook recipes that enable our bodies to make proteins of types our bodies need? It's the body's use and application of those recipes and proteins that is truly amazing.

The DVD script repeats lines about life's winners being those pass on their genes.

Do we then write off Isaac Newton, Mother Teresa, Michelangelo, Plato, George Washington and all the millions of humans who don't share my good fortune of having progeny as failures? Are the creation of beautiful art, new movements in self-government, the care for the needy nothing? Are Pythias and Nicomachus (Aristotle's children) more to the glories of the world than Aristotle's works and influence on later generations? As we increasingly acknowledge that animals share our capacity for creativity and feelings, surely we should also celebrate animal individuals' contributions to the world that have nothing to do with passing along the ""selfish gene."" Even from the selfish human perspective, are all the wonderful therapy animals of so many species including even parrots working with veterans life's failures?",1517184000,4,2185,5.11484593837535
