8765439,5,B01HH4TI04,"Excellent Documentary on The Palestinian and Israeli question of  two states and the rightful claim by both parties to this one area. It helped me to understand Zionism in a clear way that finally made sense to me. Oren Ruduvsky did an incredible job of explaining this often tense situation with interviews with both Israeli and Palestinian people and great film from the past and present. This is such a complicated and sad story that needs to be told and understood, Oren Ruduvsky
Does just that.",1492560000,,499,4.8023255813953485
