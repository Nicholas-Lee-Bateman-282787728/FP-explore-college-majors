2177737,5,B00068S3U0,Purchased this as a gift for someone who wanted it and appreciated getting it.  I was told it was a great film,1319587200,,110,4.0
2177738,4,B00068S3U0,"This is a program I would love to look at over and over again.  But why has the distributor released it only on VHS -- Slow speed.  In my mind that is criminal.  It looks like it was shot on 35mm with an Arri.  I've used that camera and it produces great images.  Why haven't they released it on DVD?  I'm sure the quality of the original would support release on Blue Ray.  Of course, Rex Allen is the greatest.  He narrated two of my films and there is no one better for this kind of film.  If the distributors would do what is right this could become one of the great classics.  Maybe they will and I will be standing in line to buy it on DVD or blue Ray.",1228089600,,658,3.954198473282443
2177739,4,B00068S3U0,"For anyone who loves the outdoors, this is a bit of nostalgia.  This takes you back to a look at the state of the wilderness in the early 1970s, when folks first began to take notice of the harm that man has done to nature.  I am not a tree hugger, but someone who has kids of my own, and realizes that driving two hours to work and that there are few places left to hunt or fish pretty much sums up the sad state of our environment these days.  This documentary is in the fine tradition of classic outdoors features such as Virgil Ward and the American Outdoorsman.  Sit down with your kids and watch this!  Then ask your local authorities why that new subdivision HAS to be built...",1129680000,,684,4.230769230769231
2177740,4,B00068S3U0,"This was a good little family movie about Nature and the graphic's where good for it's time. I did not really like the music used for this movie that's why I give it 4 stars. Now about the Movie. In it you will look at the vast American wilderness, a land threatened with destruction, in this nature documentary from acclaimed German photographer Heinz Sielmann. Animals range from majestic buffalo and mustangs to arctic whales.",1118448000,,429,4.8108108108108105
