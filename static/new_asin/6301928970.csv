380546,4,6301928970,"Weeds (John D. Hancock, 1987)
[originally posted 22Feb2000]

Rent. Go rent now. You've all heard me expound on my theory that every bad actor gets one good movie? This is Nick Nolte's. For once, his scenery-chewing doesn't detract from the film. To help him out, Hancock put together a really good ensemble cast of rising stars, most of whose stars have now long risen (Ernie Hudson, William Forsythe, Joe Mantegna, Lane Smith, et al.). If you can buy the basic premise (and I think it's based on a true story, so that shouldn't be terribly hard), it's a hell of an enjoyable film. *** ",1378339200,,586,4.625
380547,4,6301928970,This movie came to me in good shape (for a VHS) and it plays well. I had not seen this movie in years. Thank you,1359244800,,112,3.52
380548,5,6301928970,"Underrated movie! Definitely an original story. It's somewhat of a musical, and I like a lot of them. Great performance by Nick Nolte!",1355443200,,134,4.869565217391305
380549,5,6301928970,This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Nolte is powerful and convincing. I'd love to see this on DVD. This movie is all heart against a brutal background.,1266192000,,162,4.258064516129032
380550,5,6301928970,"This movie is the best ... The cast are awsome,it should be put on  dvd for sale real soon.",1140048000,,91,3.789473684210526
380551,4,6301928970,"Nick Nolte is a prisoner sentenced to life without parole; he passes the time by reading and then writing a play. A drama critic (Rita Taggart) sees the play performed in prison, is impressed, and begins working for Nolte's release. She is successful and once out, Nolte decides to continue performing the play with ex-cons around the country. At a prison performance in New York, the play (which is about prison life) causes a riot. Funny at times, especially when the ex-cons hit the road, living life on the outside after long incarceration. But the picture is also marred by cliches, especially when the cast is seated on stage after each performance in order to relate prison life to the audience. Nolte is terrific in his role. (Note: I remember reading somewhere that the filming in an actual prison triggered a real life escape during the riot scene. The escapee was quickly captured, though.)",1111708800,2,901,4.857142857142857
380552,5,6301928970,"This movie is a very special movie.  I wish it were on DVD, but the powers that be haven't released it yet.  Hopefully one day it will be available.  The movie is about Lee Umstetter's creativity in prison from his nadir at failed attempts at suicide to an almost broadway hit with his play, Weeds.  To my surprise, some of the more moving songs of the play were composed by Melissa Etheridge, whos music I never got into. Nick Nolte's performance was terrific as well as the rest of the cast's performance.  I have never seen anything like it and probably never will.  If there is a complaint, I think the play's music could have been sung better, but perhaps the realism of the movie was against that idea.",1101168000,2,708,4.449612403100775
380553,5,6301928970,"A great movie!  One of my all time favorites.  Incredible acting by Nolte especially when he reads the letter giving him parole.  The music is also incredible, who would have known William Forsythe had such a fantastic voice.",1088553600,3,225,4.868421052631579
380554,4,6301928970,"When Weeds opened in late 1987, I saw it with a date, and we expected it to be nominated for a slew of Oscars, starting with star Nick Nolte. We wuz wrong; Weeds bombed. But the reason we expected such industry acclaim has not changed. Nick Nolte carries this story, which starts out as a black comedy about convict lifer Lee Umstetter's failed attempts at suicide. Lee starts to read, and writes jailhouse plays. When he gets paroled, thanks to a pretty reporter's campaign, the movie turns into a road story, as he and his old penitentiary buddies travel to college campuses (and penitentiaries) around the country, performing, backsliding, and getting to know their share of pretty, pampered, radical co-eds. The story is at turns poignantly dramatic, darkly comedic, and just goofy fun. Nolte is aided and abetted by a marvelous cast, most notably, Rita Taggart, William Forsythe, and Ernie Hudson. (Only years later would I discover that that face, so ubiquitous in pictures, was Hudson's.)
Why did Weeds bomb? For all of his personal problems, once the camera is running, Nick Nolte is a treasure. And though he was initially a national sensation in his role as Tom Jordache in 1976 in Rich Man, Poor Man (which prior to Roots, was the miniseries to end all miniseries), and had some early screen hits, the moviegoing public never fell in love with that rough, once-boyish face of his. That's a shame, because his performance as Ray Hicks in Karel Reisz' Who'll Stop the Rain (1978), gave us one of the great tragic heroes in all of moviedom in an intense, violent picture that has more depth than any ten slow, European art house flicks combined. He is brilliant as a racist cop in a terribly dishonest movie, Sidney Lumet's Q & A (1990). His depressed coach Tom Wingo, in The Prince of Tides (1991), was as good a portrayal of a wisecracking, but ultimately sensitive, disturbed character as you'll ever see. He's a riot as the homeless guy who makes out, in Down and Out in Beverly Hills (1986). He carries the dark masterpiece, Mother Night (1996), which also bombed at the box office. And he is powerful as a man going to hell, in Affliction (1997), an otherwise overrated, pretentious movie. But that's the way it is. If he'd only been an obnoxious radical, a la Susan Sarandon, he'd have a fistful of nominations and an Oscar by now. Fortunately, savvy directors continue to give him good roles, if he can stay out of jail, and movie lovers can still buy or rent Who'll Stop the Rain, The Prince of Tides, Mother Night, Down and Out in Beverly Hills and ... Weeds.",1078185600,15,2577,4.690949227373069

7817088,5,6301928970,"I have loved this movie since seeing it as a rental on VHS. Why oh why isn't it on DVD? The music is unavailable anywhere else and most of it is so excellent it has stayed in my head and heart for years. I have a pirated DVD now and have been playing it non-stop trying to leatn the lyrics to ""I Want To Go Home"" and ""Lock and Key"" plus ""Weeds"".
It is an unusual movie and not compare-able to anything else I have ever seen. it shows the penitentiary and the ""penitents"" in a way that will stick with you a long long time.",1450742400,,522,3.9339622641509435

Just who in this world do we have to petition to get the owners to release it on dvd?  What is the problem?  Maybe we could write a collective letter to Mr. Nolte to ask him to use any influence he may have?  Maybe we could start a petition on change.org?  From time to time, I watch the few clips on YouTube, and while I enjoy them, it only adds to my frustration.  I WANT THIS MOVIE.",1427587200,,558,3.8849557522123894
