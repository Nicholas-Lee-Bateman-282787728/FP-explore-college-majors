421414,3,6302089999,It was a very moving biopic and I learned a lot. Just learning about Mitch Snyder so I don't want to give the movie a rating it might not desrve. But I liked it.,1427760000,,161,3.764705882352941
421415,5,6302089999,Now this film is a winner. I went for it for two reasons. The homeless and Martin Sheen. I have a soft spot in my heart for the homeless and as for Martin Sheen he is a very talented actor. Former great actor James Cagney praised Martin Sheen saying he was a throwback to the Golden Age of Cinema and that he definitely has Star Power. The film is  a tug at your heart movie I just loved it. Just pay attention to Martin Sheen speaking before a congressional committee WOW that is Academy Award written all over it If after watching you don't have a feel for the homeless then put the popcorn back on the shelf and turn in your NETFLIX card because its all over for you..,1424476800,3,671,4.161538461538462
421416,5,6302089999,"Must see movie for the betterment of the world.  It is hopeful when homelessness seems so hopeless for solutions.  It also is well done and stirs the care in you for others especially for the homeless.  Touches on where we can make changes where we have gone the wrong way away from helping others like all the food that is tossed that people could be eating.  Shows how normal people become homeless and how they are treated once this has happened, how they are pushed aside like they don't matter and often don't have a place to sleep except in a makeshift home made out of a cardboard box if they even have that.",1409529600,2,615,4.368421052631579

421420,5,6302089999,"There are 2 differant movies with similar titles on this page. One is ""Samaritan: The Mitch Snyder Story"", and the other is titled simply ""Samaritan"". The first movie is about Mitch Snyder the homeless advocate in Washington D.C. that stars Martin Sheen and Cicely Tyson, the second is about some Norwegian kid, and I have never seen that movie. Please correct this, Amazon, because ""The Mitch Snyder Story"" is an EXCELLENT made-for-tv movie, and it is a crime that it's not on DVD.

Eva Sorhaug did not direct ""Mitch Snyder"", and Stein Gronli was not in it.",1171584000,3,558,4.752577319587629
