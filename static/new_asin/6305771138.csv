3714501,4,6305771138,The story line was good but the acting needed a little less acting.  The moral line has not lost its significance even for today.  I would imagine that this would be a must see for theater majors.,1454976000,,196,4.27027027027027
3714502,5,6305771138,Enjoyed watching it. will look for more like it. A very well acted look at the NY youngsters don't know about unless they had family from the Wards of old NY.,1448409600,,158,4.129032258064516
3714503,5,6305771138,"Love Sylvia and this story -- always women as powerless it seems at that time in films, but she did the good work here to lift her slum neighborhood out of the muck and didn't end up as a love story between her and the rich guy.  A film reflecting the oligarchy of the time, power between the rule of law and the toughs at the time known aka the bankers and old monied families.",1445644800,3,378,4.04
3714504,2,6305771138,I did not like it. I think is was made in a time where tenement housing  proliferated  the country and was supposed to be a social message. It was slow moving without a real comprehensive story line and way toooooo melodramatic.,1440979200,,228,4.536585365853658
3714505,4,6305771138,Fascinating diatribe for slum clearance loosely disguised as a Hollywood feature.,1405296000,,81,6.454545454545454
3714506,2,6305771138,The plot of this movie is poorly written.  The landlord of  an apartment building is harrassed by tenants who start fires in the building by smoking and vandalism.  The  arson activity is justified by the dwellers of the  building as retaliation for the condition of the buiding. None of the tenants has bothered to complain to the landlord or file a complaint with the city until after one of the  residents sets fire to the building.  The picture quality  was just passable and the sound had background problems on the vhs copy from Vci.  This may have been due to the fact that  this was a Paramount film from the 1930's.,979776000,6,624,4.54054054054054
8324188,5,6305771138,"I saw the PBS documentary on Sidney Lumet and didn't know he was a child actor.  When this movie was mentioned and a clip of it was shown, it tweaked my curiosity and I purchased it.  Although dated, it's an affecting movie and Lumet was very good.  I recommend watching
""One Third of a Nation"" with the notation that the viewer keep in mind it was made in the 1930s, so don't compare it to films of this generation in 2017.",1506643200,,424,4.209876543209877

8324190,1,6305771138,"I am not reviewing the film content here, just the DVD from Alpha Video. The transfer is very blurry and the sound is poor. Worst of all there is an on screen Alpha Video logo. I hate that! If that bothers you, steer clear of this.",1483920000,2,231,4.043478260869565

8324195,5,6305771138,"I'm impressed.  It too a strong woman also kind, to make a change a fight for fair decent housing.  No, it was not a love story, it is about people making the decision to do good after a tragedy happened.  This is still true to this day, it just takes one person to make a difference.",1458777600,,284,4.035714285714286
