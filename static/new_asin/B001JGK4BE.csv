3657873,4,B001JGK4BE,"After a warm welcome and tribute to her teacher Yousry Sharif, Ranya  clearly demonstrates:
Proper Posture alignment which are key elements in modern oriental dance
Extensive warm up with narration on technique
Drill sections for beginner and advanced student; sections emphasize footwork and orientation of space, traveling
Interesting personal theory on breathing, her personal belly dance math and footwork; the instructor shares some of her own terminology to explain some of the moves.
The choreography sections:
2 Choreography demonstrations: for the beginner a short 2 minute ""Layalina"" finale  ample repetitons, so simple, feminine, and much fun! Now you are hooked, so prepare for a  full  seven minute  ""Layalina"" choreography with its tempo changes and nuances. Finally,tips on veil entrance to make your dance more dramatic. These choreographies are flirty with lively steps and lots of layering on hip movement, typical for the dance.
The instructor is generous on personal theory and technique. I enjoyed the beginner section most, as the choreography seemed to fit the music perfectly and is so simple. On the negative side, the program contains sections  with unnecessary jargon, too much detail, lengthy..  The most favored sections were the warm-up , the drill sections and the beginner choreography finale of ""Layalina.""  Overall, so much fun, a good route into the journey into modern oriental dance, Egyptian Style.",1241308800,3,1436,5.495454545454545
3657874,5,B001JGK4BE,"Her DVD's are really good--probably because she is personable, funny, and educational all at the same time. This DVD is excellent, but her two DVD set ""The Beledi"" is even better.",1241136000,,179,4.806451612903226
3657875,5,B001JGK4BE,"Right from the start of my short belly dance life, I've focused on Am Cab and tribal conditioning and practically ignored Egyptian style. But if anyone thinks that means I would resist Ranya's fabulous new collection of instructional DVDs in Egyptian styling, they can think again. As a matter of fact, I can already perform the beginner choreography on Modern Oriental, Bellydance Egyptian Style.

Well  can perform it because it's not a difficult or complex choreo and it's very tied into the music, so when you hear the accents, you can't help remembering the moves you're supposed to do. But whether I can perform the 2 minute choreography Egyptianly or not, is another matter. That nuancing is going to take awhile.

Modern Orietnal has two choreographies on it: a 2 minute beginner finale and a longer 7-minute embelished advanced choreography. The choreographies are set to Layalina and the Finale on Wash ya Wash Vol 4 by Yousry Sharif - who happens to be Ranya's teacher.

In this preview, Ranya tells you about how Egyptian dancers have used and expressed themselves with Egyptian music. The clip may actually give the impression that the whole video is involved and complex and ""talky"". Not so. This is really a big chunk of the introduction. When one third of the clip is left, Ranya tells you what you'll find on the video.  I'll say this: she definitely delivers on what is promised.

To begin at the beginning, Ranya first takes you through a detailed instruction (about 10 minutes of it) on posture and alignment, obviously with special emphasis on Egyptian style. Then you have a warm up combined with technique review. It's a warm up, not a hardcore conditioning workout. I'd recommend that anyone who's using this DVD go through it because you will become accostomed to the way Ranya moves and the terminology she uses. Anyway, you need to warm up and this is a gentle stretchy session of about 15 minutes.

Next thre's a unique 2-minute section with lots of tips on working with the step combinations. Where should you focus, how do you use the beat and stay on it, how to get over getting confused with the left and right foot.

And this leads straight into an explanation of how we will work with the choreographies.

A demo (in training gear) begins our work with the Finale to Layalina. Ths is a charming and perky piece of music and I really like it. The instruction follows a familiar World Dance format - learn with explanations and then dance along twice with music.

Ranya is a good instructor. Just the right mix of everything,r eally. She is very thorough and tells you about all the details, particularly which muscles to use for this style and how to interpret the music. The detail would be a lot to take in if she weren't so well-paced, so natural and vivacious. Even funny at various points. You instantly feel completely at ease with her. She has what I call good video presence: unself-conscious, relaxed and just like she's talking to you and you only.

The Finale has 7 combinations. There are repeated patterns but the choreography doesn't look repetitive. Can absolute beginners pick it up? Well, sure, probably. But it won't look the same unless there's been a few months of isolations. Nevertheless, no harm attempting it at all. If you need drills, there's a segment of drills of movements from the choregraphy after the instruction. Recommended. If you're not used to Egytpian, like me, you can do with repetitions of how to make circles and hip drops etc look way jucier and how to get the baladi bounce into it.

Ranya tells you all about the rhythms in the music as we go along and really makes it meaningful. Wonderful little choreography, in my opinion.

And then... we get to the meat of it all. The more advanced choreography. Same format, same detail. It's just that this is a longer choreography and full of layers and detail and nuances. Ranya mentions that you can choose to develop your dance gradually with this choreography. It's totally connected to the first choreography and some steps are the same but are made more complex now with decorations. Here you can see the inward moes and embellishments that make this dance different. After 14 combinations, we end up with the Finale, or the first choregraphy. But here the Finale is a little more layered and accented.

After the whole Layalina instruction, Ranya gives you an option for a veil entrance and she tells you how to modify movements to come in with the veil. Nice!

There are some tougher drills after this for the advanced learner. Six of the.

And finally, the Layalina performance in costume.

Ranya enjoys herself. And I think so will anyone who learns with her.",1239840000,8,4689,4.754926108374384
3657876,5,B001JGK4BE,"This is a fabulous video on modern Egyptian belly dance!  It is for intermediate and advanced students, but it would be good material for a beginner to watch in order to understand the music and the dance concepts.  I'm really looking forward to the next video in this series.  The whole series will be required viewing for my students!  These DVDs are packed with information!  I like to watch DVDs through, take notes, then go back and work with them.  You may want to do the same with Ranya's videos, because they have so much information that you will want to remember.",1239494400,9,573,4.568627450980392
3657877,4,B001JGK4BE,"Ranya Renee's ""Modern Oriental"" DVD is a single DVD focusing on Modern Oriental style of bellydance.  The DVD is intended for intermediate dancers, or at minimum, beginner dancers with other classroom or DVD experience.

Ranya begins the DVD with a discussion of music for Oriental dance, and how it has changed over the years.  These changes have affected how dancers respond to the music.  The historical background provides the viewer with an understanding of what differentiates Modern Oriental from other styles of bellydance.

Ranya also includes a valuable section on how to best learn choreography.  I put this into use already this weekend at a Yousry Sharif workshop (Ranya's dance mentor).  This video, like her baladi DVD, includes a useful posture section.

Then Ranya teaches a choreography to Layalina by Yousry Sharif.  First, she teaches the finale choreography, for beginners.  Then she has an intermediate section with the entire song.  Each section contains both choreographic instruction and practice, as well as drills to build ones skills.  Ranya does not merely explain the movements, but she explains where your weight is, the ""feeling"" of the move, down to the angle of the head.  Not only that, but she tells you why she wrote the choreography this way.  She also discusses the music, and how the movements go with the music.  The DVD is packed with so much more information than your typical choreography DVD, and Ranya's delivery is entertaining, never stiff or boring.",1238976000,13,1498,5.132231404958677
3657878,5,B001JGK4BE,"This 165 minute ""Modern Oriental"" DVD is a marvelous way to learn the current Egyptian style of dance, with Ranya Renee, an internationally acclaimed performer and teacher, giving us a clear understanding of the technique, as only she can do. Ranya has a way of making her explanations visual, as in ""your foot hitting the floor like your hand hitting a drum."" Her depth of knowledge and expertise combined with this clarity makes this a valuable bellydance DVD to own.

It starts with a Welcome that explains Egyptian dance and its history in an overview of what will be taught on this DVD, and then you get the basic posture, alignment, and technique in detail, as well as a good warm-up.

The choreographed piece comes in 2 levels. #1 is for beginners and is much simpler and shorter, #2 for advanced/intermediate. Both include a demonstration, a step by step breakdown and ""drills"" for practice. Ranya has a nice habit of saying ""left-right-left"" etc., so our feet don't get mixed up in fast passages and weight changes. The DVD concludes with a gorgeous costumed perfomance.

Dramatic and dazzling with her mane of red hair, Ranya is a delight to learn from and watch. She dedicates this DVD to her longtime teacher Yousry Sharif, who must be so proud of her! Music is excellent and authentic, by Mohamed Ali.",1237593600,19,1314,4.779735682819383
8312878,5,B001JGK4BE,Meet her in NY and took her workshops!  Loved the teachings of the CD.  She is a wonderful instructor.  Was what I expected knowing her teaching style from NY.  Product arrived as expected.  Would purchase from this seller again!,1434672000,,229,4.769230769230769

8312880,4,B001JGK4BE,"I currently own the DVD Bellydance Egyptian Style: The Baladi,. I just got and am working with this Modern Oriental; and have just ordered the Taqsim Improvisational Skills and Drills. I read some reviews unfavourably comparing the Modern Oriental with the Bsladi DVD, and one in particular saying the former is lacking in authenticity. Not so! Modern Egyptian style Bellydance is dazzling, spectacular and athletic, modern Egyptians go crazy for it within Egypt itself, as do international audiences. To me, this DVD has authenticity in bucketloads. Many Yousry Sharif-trained dancers, teach this way.  One small point, people: you can use parts of the choreography to adapt to your own dance! Just because a DVD has a taught choreography instead of improvisational drills, does not mean it is inferior in quality. It is simply a different method of teaching. So don't let yourself be thrown. I suggest using the choreography intelligently to adapt to your own improvisation. Additionally, every one one of the top dancers in Cairo and Alexandria today use the footwork patterns in this video. If you are influenced by them, you will need to learn this footwork anyway. It is basic standard stuff for this style. I like the drills specially made to prevent mixing up of left and right feet as you go along. The warm-up I really liked, as it gets you ready to dance, although the warm-ups in DVDs such as Sadie's, are more vigorous.
The intermediate/advanced choreography is really juicy and there's lots to get your teeth into. If you already go to workshops in Bellydance, you will enjoy it. This DVd is like a friendly but firm workshop, as is the Baladi DVD.
At the time of writing this, we have lost one of our most well-loved Baladi accordion players in the UK, whose accompaniment I was lucky enough to have in my dancing. While live accompaniment to dance makes all the difference, this Modern Oriental tutorial,  while not dependent on live music, still ican be a great support  to your dancing and will train your musical ear. Musicians may well find it useful too, especially if they are crossing over from Western to Eastern modes.
There is also an instructional DVD by top Egyptian dancer Randa Kamel, straight from the oracle!  I have used this too and found it really interesting, although the overdubbing into English is distracting. Ranya Renee Modern Oriental remains a more accessible route for Western dancers. I think this dance is actually be oming more and more international, with Chinese and Korean bellydancers joining the throng and teachers travelling more widely. It would be great to see how dance DVDs evolve along with this growing market.

Overall this is quality, with much more emphasis on Bellydance as the great art form it is.",1401667200,,2764,4.935483870967742
8312881,5,B001JGK4BE,"This a really fun choreography video! This dance is fun to learn, and fun to perform, with wonderful moves and combinations. Ranya's descriptions of posture and technique are fascinating and entertaining! She gives great explanations of how the moves embody the music, and show its changes.

8312883,5,B001JGK4BE,"I always learn so much from watching Ranya Renee dance. With this video, not only am I picking up new moves, I'm also learning a beautiful choreography that is broken down into combinations for beginners and then later an extended version for advanced dancers. I love that steps are broken down and drilled so that I understand how to do moves that I have yet to learn in class. Buy this dvd! It's a great investment",1353715200,,416,4.4868421052631575
8312884,5,B001JGK4BE,"I have been belly dancing for about a year, all to DVD's since there are no classes anywhere close by. I absolutely love this video! The two part choreography is wonderful, one for beginner and one more advanced. I am quite the klutz, two left feet, no coordination what-so-ever, as graceful as a moose in the mud, so if you are brand new to belly dance and are like me, I am thinking you may want to purchase this video along with another total beginner video. I still highly recommend it, but for my non-talented self, I found DVD's such as Sadie's Complete Bellydance Guide to help me out the most in the very beginning. Ranya Renee is a fabulous teacher, I also have her Baladi DVD, and it is great as well!",1344556800,,711,4.353383458646617
8312885,4,B001JGK4BE,"I am coming to the conclusion that there aren't enough economically-priced advanced choreography DVDs out there. Every DVD seems to be beginner techniques, which I have wasted enough money on. Ranya Renee has a beautiful style, thanks to Yousry Sharif, and I am a fan of them both, so this DVD was right up my alley. You can cut to the chase and get to the advanced part quickly. Also, her explanations in other sections outside of the choreography are poignant, smartly-worded, and dead on. Even if you are advanced, you will be enriched here. This makes me really want the 2-DVD set, which got rave reviews as well!",1323648000,,617,4.669724770642202
8312886,5,B001JGK4BE,"I picked this up after hearing it recommended on a messaged board and viewing the trailer on the World Dance NY's site.  It is an excellent resource for learning both Egyptian technique, a very nice choreography, and how to dance to the music.  I also got her Baladi DVD set and am looking forward to reviewing and using that.

Ranya's instruction is clear and concise and she breaks down movements very well.  I would say this video is for anyone over the basic beginner stage and/or looking to learn more about how to dance with the music not at it.",1264291200,,551,4.48
8312887,5,B001JGK4BE,"Lovers of Egyptian Style Bellydance, this DVD is fantastic.

And as always with the WDNY excellent quality production.
