8706227,4,B00UGQ9DJW,"The five volumes in FOX HOME VIDEO's PERFECT DATE MOVIES all have a ""Love & ____"" theme. The four titles in each set are on individual discs and presented in widescreen format. Quality of the transfers is excellent. Provided extras are those typical of full-priced, single release DVDs: commentary tracks, theatrical trailers, ""making of"" featurettes, deleted and extended scenes, etc.

The highlight of this third edition features Michael Mann's epic version of ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" starring Daniel Day-Lewis.

SYNOPSES for PDM #3 (Love & Adventure)--

THE BEACH-- A young man visiting Thailand is given a map to a legendary island Eden by a fellow who later commits suicide. The recipient invites two others to join him in his quest for this mysterious location, which turns out to be the home of an alternate-lifestyle group. They're welcomed gladly until trouble arises in paradise.

THE CHASE-- A prison escapee takes a rich man's daughter hostage, and flees with her in the girl's car. They quickly become a media event as the car is spied on from helicopters and other vantage points and broadcast on all TV channels.

THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS-- During the British and French struggles over rural colonial America, an English colonel's two daughters are rescued from harm by a settler who was orphaned as a boy and raised by Indians. It may not be a faithful-to-the-book adaptation, but this 1992 masterpiece is definitely the most exciting film version of that famous James Fenimore Cooper story.

A LIFE LESS ORDINARY-- Hostage story has a fantasy twist. A disgruntled cleaning man kidnaps the boss's daughter after losing his job to a robot. Two Earth-bound angels intercede and soon captor and prisoner fall for each other. An outstanding acting ensemble adds much to this one.
