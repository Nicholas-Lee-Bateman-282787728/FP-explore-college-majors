7852293,5,6303625916,"Red Skelton is one of the best loved comedians in entertainment. His works have held up to present day. That's why to some he's the 'King of Laughter.' He will always have a star in the Comedy Hall of Fame alongside Bob Hope, Jonathan Winters and Phyllis Diller. Do you remember his recitation of the 'Pledge of Allegiance?' I'm sure that this is one of the best routines he performed during his career and the most memorable as being creative and sober talent.

This Black &White video contains his Christmas show showing onstage antics of the 'Married Couple' and other comedy gag shorts. He plays 'Freddy the Freeloader' frolicking in a wintery park with Raggedy Ann. In another skit, he plays 'Willie Lump Lump' where his wife plays a trick on him because of his drinking to switch the room around and make it appear he's seeing things wrong side up! The video live up to it's quality in entertainment with a great supporting cast. In consideration to the age of the film the quality of the sound is good. My friend liked Red so much that I brought her a copy of this for Christmas but you can enjoy it anytime of the year!",1049587200,12,1127,4.4975609756097565
