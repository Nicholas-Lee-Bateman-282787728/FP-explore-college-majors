5261234,1,B0094EVFLG,"Prometheus Crap is what I would call this movie...I didn't buy this from Amazon, I bought it at Wal-Mart on a whim just to see something Sci-Fi.  It is HORRIBLE, no plot, I don't know what these other people are talking about.  The storyline is just plain stupid, the equipment they are using in the bridge of the ship looks like some kind of military Motorola radio from the 80's, maybe even some type of electrical test equipment, then there is a standard looking rope space, and what looks like standard Kidde fire extinguishers, cheap plastic sheets to cover up the set they didn't build, then they do some form of hypersleep in big Zip Loc bag lookin things with vacuum cleaner hoses in thier mouth or connected to the bag like they are going to vacuum themselves or something.  It is just plain stupid.  The only redeeming quality is that the female Android is cute, but that didn't stop me from fast forwarding thru and then taking the DVD to the document shredder, a total waste of money and 45 minutes of my life I spent trying to give it a chance.  The makers of this movie should pay me for my time wasted.  I am not overstating this...this movie is crap, don't waste your money.  If could give this move negative stars I would.",1386460800,14,1239,4.45575221238938
5261235,2,B0094EVFLG,"First thing to note is that the cover art is serious misleading. The ship on the cover IS NOT the ship in the movie, and the two people pictured on the cover ARE NOT in the movie. The cover makes this movie look more impressive than it really is.

As another reviewer noted this is a very low budget sci-fi Groundhog Day. Using BMX equipment for their space suits, no effects from the guns when they shoot, nearly every location was small and cramped. The camera work was shoddy for the most part...heads being cut off, moving to position before the actors do, ridiculous angles. The editing was also bad. It would take frequent establishing shots of the ship many times while in the middle of dialogue. It was extremely annoying. The only problem with the audio that I noticed was with the computer voices. They were hard to hear at times.

I think I should clarify a few comments from another reviewer: ""At the final ending, it appeared the time weapon was the only survivor which halted the cycle. But it still wasn't fully clear whether the others were elsewhere or removed from existence or time or simply destroyed.""

It is explained in the movie that whatever the weapon is fired at is erased from time. Not sure where the confusion was, but that should help.

""It appears that the crew was killed by the female android & the weapon saved & ready for instructions for its next target.""

The female android never killed anybody expect for that one time she set the weapon off herself after the crew stopped the engineer from doing it again.

""But the film kept changing at the ending as to whom was targeting what while 2 androids, 2 ships and one smart weapon were all targeting each other. The final blast appeared to originate from the weapon but did the weapon initiate it or the android?""

There weren't two ships. Unless he is counting the small ship the crew arrived in and docked with the Prometheus, but it wasn't targeting anything. After the male android ejected the weapon into space the female android was on the bridge targeting the weapon with the Prometheus' weapons and the male android was in the cargo bay at the weapon's control panel. He fired the weapon erasing the Prometheus and the crew from time ending the cycle. It is a little confusing as to why the female android didn't just blow it out of the sky first. Unless the male android just beat her to it.

""But it was also hard to feel sorry for such a clueless crew who shot first without asking questions, never listened & always made the wrong choices.""

Each time the cycle started the only ones that retained any memories were the androids. So calling the crew clueless and all that is kind of unfair since it wasn't their fault.

The description on the Amazon page is a little misleading too. This one is more accurate:

""A space crew is diverted from their course and awakened to investigate a missing cargo vessel carrying a devastating time weapon. A fracture in time has trapped the missing ship, weapon, surviving crew members and rescuers in a repeating time loop. Only the 2 androids can retain memories of previous time loops while their respective crews exhibit unusual behaviors. The androids struggle to solve the illogic of their crews oblivious entrapment in an endless cycle of death and destruction.""

I would have given this one star if it wasn't for the plot. It wasn't bad. This movie would have been decent if any real effort was actually put into it.",1386115200,12,3458,4.61400651465798
5261236,5,B0094EVFLG,Have not seen this movie but have heard from others that this is an excellent movie. I thought it would be an excellent addition to my collection.,1384560000,,146,4.444444444444445
5261237,3,B0094EVFLG,"This is not the Alien prequel, Prometheus. That is a different movie by a similar name.  Don't read reviews if you don't want to know the movie details.

The cover art certainly made no sense for this film. No aliens or battle droids. This is a ""Groundhog day"" type of plot in space where a sleeping crew is diverted to investigate a missing space ship to retrieve a mass destruction time weapon intended to wipe out a planet from time... namely earth (based on what I gathered from the female engineers motive).

The main problem with this movie is the poor audio quality. It is difficult to determine what is being said by anyone or anything. Lacking subtitles or closed captioning, there is no way to supplement the inability to hear the muddy dialogue.

It is also difficult to realize some crew are not human until the second android is found. It is nearly impossible to discern the physical location of the characters with the fog machines & odd camera angles which often cut off their heads, bodies and entire crew members.

The identical wigs on the females & android also makes it extremely difficult to separate them.

Too many tight shots at weird angles such as a 45 degree from floor level to ceiling & often not squared nor level; make it nearly impossible to follow their trek through the ship. Hence, impossible to understand their progression, location & purpose or accomplishments in the story. By adding bright lights glaring into the camera lenses from behind heavy fog and actors, it obscures the scenes even worse.

This director & camera crew clearly did not understand the impact of bright lights targeted at the cameras & how it affects the lighting levels & quality of the imagery. Bright lights will cause any auto leveling camera features to close down the lens apertures or iris & darken the faces. It also causes glare artifacts & reflections in the anamorphic lenses. Even worse are the bright uniform & background panel lights which glare in tight shots.

The Camera work is quite awful & continuously cuts off the top of their heads in every scene while the blinding shoulder lights on the uniform Epilets distort the light & color levels in each shot. Only a grade school child would frame a face between the chin & eyebrows or cut off the top of the heads in every shot regardless of subject framing distance.

Too many film crews are using nose hair closeups these days with no clue as to lighting. They spend a fortune on set design but we never get to see any of it due to the nose closeups. Doesn't anyone have professional training on cameras & lighting anymore?

As for the story, it wasn't bad. It could have been better if we could have heard the dialogue. As with Groundhog day, the events would restart each time they died & the events were slightly modifiable each time. At the final ending, it appeared the time weapon was the only survivor which halted the cycle. But it still wasn't fully clear whether the others were elsewhere or removed from existence or time or simply destroyed. It appears that the crew was killed by the female android & the weapon saved & ready for instructions for its next target. But the film kept changing at the ending as to whom was targeting what while 2 androids, 2 ships and one smart weapon were all targeting each other. The final blast appeared to originate from the weapon but did the weapon initiate it or the android? But it was also hard to feel sorry for such a clueless crew who shot first without asking questions, never listened & always made the wrong choices. Also difficult to be certain of the events with so many film audio problems. The movie could have been quite good with more funding for a better quality crew, cast & direction.

Also quite viable as an excellent Outer Limits episode candidate. They should bring back that series for clever episode plots like this.

The only problem I have with region formats is they don't mark the cases large enough so we can see which DVD player to use.",1364860800,46,3995,4.619181946403385

5261244,3,B0094EVFLG,"This was a DVD my father gave to me as a gift. He thought it was Prometheus (the one by Ridley Scott). It has nothing to do with the Alien series. The film is by no means crap as posted by other reviewers. The must have patience with the recursive time paradox theme. I found it to be quite intelligent. The android Finn eventually figures out how to end the infinite cycle of the replaying of the scenarios -- by ejecting the Hercules time gun weapon from the ship Prometheus. I also picked up on Artemis's retelling of the fable of the Greek myth of Prometheus -- a poetic link to what is happening to them all. The engineer Trent is the saboteur, furious at the knowledge that her home planet of Earth is being targeted for erasure by the time gun. The android Finn is able to remember all the previous scenarios and alter the action each time. The android Artemis is a fatalist, but Finn believes there is a solution to the infinite recursion. I for one am not concerned about the special effects, props, and instruments used. I only focused on the plot. Yes, the camera angles are lousy, with continuously too tight shots. In spite of that I enjoyed the film and was able to appreciate what the scriptwriter was trying to demonstrate. The story reminded me of several other films dealing with time paradoxes, and a few episodes of Doctor Who, and there is even a Xena: Warrior Princess episode with time loops as the mean theme. I would say the film isn't all that bad, however Phase 4 Films, based on the trailers on the DVD tend to distribute poor what trash action films, and those looked very bad. One problem is that the Artemis and Trent characters looked virtually identical, so more than one viewing is required to sort their roles out.",1483747200,,1749,4.4858934169279
