5186865,5,B008WAM2TW,"Transformers Prime picks up where season one left off with Optimus Prime now among the ranks of the Decepticons?!?!?! Through out this season the Autobots and Decepticons are battling over hidden Cybertronian Iacon Relics (some are the Cybertronian equivalent of WMD's)that could turn the tide of the war, Mech shakes things up quite a bit,and ultimately takes them to an EPIC showdown on Cybertron. This season is just as great as the first season with new characters,and new twists and turns. And also a bit less Miko thank god. Voice talent is second to none with Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime,Frank Welker as Megatron,Tony Todd (Transformers Revenge of the Fallen) as Dreadwing, John Dimaggio (bender from futurama) as Vogul and many many more. This is a show that is fun for the whole family. A spectacular ride for the kids and a very welcome nostalgia for the adults. This is a must see chapter in the Transformers Prime Universe. If you haven't seen season one you absolutely must own it too. This is a great investment and you won't regret it.",1350864000,10,1052,4.81767955801105

The writers, animators, actors, sounds guys, heck everybody involved with this show is just flat out awesome.

5186868,5,B008WAM2TW,"Transformers Prime Season 2 continues the greatness! This season is full of twist and turns in the plots along with the same quality storylines that makes this a must have for all transformer fans. The human characters of Raf,Miko,and Jack are more involved to help in the fight against the decepticons. The season starts out with the Orion Pax series in which Jack shoulders more responsibility when a trip to Cybertron is the key to saving Optimus. Megatron finds himself at war with not only the Autobots,but treachary in the decepticon ranks involving Starscream and Airachnid. Arcee still is the best looking she has ever been with the continuing rivalry against her nemesis Airachnid. Then there is the race for the cybertronian relics that could shift the balance of power to the Autobot or Decepticon side. Season 2 is a thrill ride from start to finish that is a refreshing reminder of how great the Transformers series is. There is also new characters introduced as well with the Insecticons and Dreadwing. Both of these characters are very badass and compliment the series very well. Mech gets involved in the series as well with a cool appearence from a Nemesis Prime. Overall this is an action packed series with great detail in graphics and animation that remains as good as the G1 days. Season 2 will keep you on the edge of your seat in anticipation for the next episode that all ages of fans will love. Bottom line Transformers Prime Season 2 is a high quality,well done,10 out of 10 series that is as good as any transformers series ever done. I highly recommend Transformers Prime Season 2 to all transformer fans out there. Transformers Prime Rules!!!",1346198400,17,1671,4.825783972125436

The season cranks up the awesomeness even more and the tides of war sway back and forth. More background lore, more development with the characters, and new characters are introduced. If you liked season one, you will very likely enjoy this season even more

It begins right where the first season cliffhanger ends, with Optimus having lost his memory and unwittingly helps the Decepticons. There is more of the history of the war, and the backstory of Optimus and Megatron. M.E.C.H. returns and there is more mischief with Starscream too.

There's an almost Empire Strikes Back  feel to this season when it ends with things not looking too good for the heroes. But there's also a few bits of hope as well. Which of course it why you should continue and pick up season three.",1495497600,,798,4.810218978102189
5186925,5,B008WAM2TW,"Review by child of Mominator

As soon as season 2 was available, we got it and started watching it. Savoring every episode and sitting on the edge of our seat for the next. Of course, there were plot twists and things that happened in season 1 that affected the events of season 2. A very well done TV show, much more like an adult TV show rather than a childrens show. Love it so much! Great cast and story line, amazing! No one can say enough about this series, aside from it ended way too soon!

Oh, two other things, the Star Saber's sound effects are actually Fizzy the unicorn's in the original My Little Pony TV show...kind of sad. Number two, I wish that Alpha Trion had been voiced by someone that made him sound more like Generation 1 Alpha Trion. Nothing against Mr. George Takei but he is not Alpa Trion, Mr. John Stephenson (G1) will always be Alpha Trion. Also, if you read Transformers Exodus, Exiles, & Retribution you get the feeling that Alpha Trion plays himself down. With Mr. Takei voicing him....he sounds too capable. I think he should have sounded more like G1. Just my opinion though.

Be sure to tell Hasbro Studios how much you love this! Use the picture to know how to contact them. Dont forget to ask when they are going to make another TF show like it! Make sure to ask about Transformers Prime Powerful Alliances!",1493596800,,1344,4.455284552845528

In my opinion, this is the definitive series in the franchise, because it pays homage to the G1 series that so many of us grew up with.  The production values are top-notch, and the transformations are very well-done.  They tip their hats to some of the comic mythology, as well.  The theme of the series is more serious than those  that came before, but there are several bits of humor tucked in at appropriate points.  The casting deserves special mention, because they got Peter Cullen and Frank Welker for Optimus and Megatron (the only 2 people who are truly qualified for the roles), Ernie Hudson (from Ghostbusters), and a whole cast of great supporting characters.  I used to think that the Beast Wars series was the best, but this series blows that out of the water.

The animation is stunning, the voice talent is incredible, the plot is awesome, and I like the examples of sacrifice, courage, and bravery.  You fall in love with the robots and their human friends. The action/adventure will leave you on the edge of your seat!  Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) is especially cool in this series and I love how strong and brave he is and his willingness to lie down his life for both humans and his own people.  I got to confess that I do have a soft spot for Knock Out, too.  For a bad guy he is pretty awesome. :)

This is NOT a series I would let a child watch; in my opinion, this is an animated adult T.V. series that teens and adults will enjoy.  There is a heavy amount of violence; robots are ripped apart, killed, shot at, beaten, stabbed, tortured, and bleed to death.  There are lots of car chases and explosions that are cool for teens and adults, but may be a little much for children.

This is a super awesome series that you can watch over and over again and still never get tired of it.  Be warned of one thing:  YOU WILL LOVE TRANSFORMERS PRIME!!!",1387065600,,1208,4.25
5187073,5,B008WAM2TW,"Transformers: Prime continues its epicness in season 2. Because I have gone into most of the details as to the show's basic quality in my review to season 1, I'm only going to talk about the season 2 exclusive things.

Season 2 picks up where season 1 left off. I'm not going to go into any details as to what happens, but I can assure you that everything works in a way that doesn't come off as cheesy or cliche. After the first couple of episodes, the season goes on into a new story. As usual, the stories are top notch, filled with action, adventure, and occasionally humor. The final episodes of season 2 are especially cool, and the season leaves in a cliffhanger that leaves you wondering what happens next.

The second season introduces new characters. None of them really hurt my opinion with the show, but rather increase it. Smokescreen in particular was a very nice addition to the team, even though this is his first time ever playing any significance to the Autobots. I do wish though that they had added more characters, considering how perfect the cast is.

Season 2 of Transformers: Prime is very similar to season 1, and that's a good thing. As I stated in my review to season 1, Transformers: Prime has become my all-time favorite television series, and season 2 continues it.

The writing - still amazing, the 'cons still conniving and evil and the relationship between the characters continue to grow and the bots and cons race to collect all of the Iacon relics. Relics may seem dull considering how season one left up, but it is building up to something. I won't ruin what. Don't let the bad reviews fool you. I found the pay off to be worth it.

Wheeljack also returns and is awesome as ever. You either love or hate Miko, but I find my admiration for this character just keeps growing. I have to say, my interest in the other humans kind of waned this season but I can live with that as long as the autobots keep being badass.",1381881600,,899,4.137142857142857

And, just when the Autobots thought the Decepticons were at manageable numbers, Megatron's forces swell with the addition of Skyquake's twin brother, Dreadwing, as well as the barbarric Insecticons.  But the Autobots have reinforcements of their own, in the form of the Wrecker Wheeljack, and new recruit, Smokescreen.

Everything that was in Season 1 has returned and made better and you really feel like alot is riding on the Autobots' winning and that remains prevalent until the end.

My only negative complaint is out of 26 (I think) episodes total, two of them are completely dedicated to flashbacks and recapping the whole series. What little plot they contribute in those two episodes would have been maybe around 3-5 minutes total. I feel these two episodes were a waste when I was expecting a full episode of new content. However that is a minor complaint in the full over arching story for this season.

All I can say is this season was excellent and I cannot wait to get my hands on Season 3!",1370563200,,733,4.587786259541985

The downside to all the goodness of transformers prime is the lazy extras, there is almost no extras for this release, no audio commentary, no making off that you can say its a real making off. There are a few interviews with some of the animators and creators of the show, but is very boring, they almost show no new content, no exclusive images, no big behind the scenes, and the people on the interview seems very bored and just waiting for it to end.
The Peter Cullen, Optimus himself, interview almost makes you forget the lack of any interesting features of this set, it is a great intervie by Larry King.
The Season 1 set has a lot of better extra content, and the limited edition includes a comic book!.

Transformers Prime is awesome for two reasons.  First, the computer animation is finally at at level where it is seamless.  I loved Beast Wars, but it lacked the fluidity that Transformers Prime has.
Second, the writing is phenomenal!!  Kurtzman And Orci use all kinds of Transformers lore to create great story lines.  The use of actual events, and places from the original Transformers shows just how much they love the show as well.  Two thumbs way up!!!!",1360627200,,616,4.922330097087379

It was an effort of love and affection for the source material, mired in the feel of the new Hollywood movies.  But season 2 only picks up where season 1 left off, and then quickly falls apart.  Nothing holds this season together.  The main story line is that the Autobots are searching for treasures from Cybertron that were sent to Earth many thousands of years ago.  Who cares.  We just found out in Season 1 that Earth is freaking Unicron!  If you can't top that then why bother.  But apparently the producers thought otherwise.",1358985600,,699,4.484126984126984

5187318,5,B008WAM2TW,"The story begun in Season 1 of Transformers Prime continues.  Picking up with the cliff-hanger ending of Season 1, the war between the Autobots and Decepticons rages on.
The writing for the series is top-notch.  The story is engrossing without being overwhelming.  As an adult and a fan of all things Transformers, I found the story to be interesting enough to keep me viewing but my five-year-old son didn't have any problems understanding the plot either.  The dialogue flows naturally and doesn't feel forced.  The characters are all spotlighted at least once each and new recruits show up on a couple of occassions.
Where the series really shines is in the voice work.  Peter Cullen and Frank Welker reprise their roles as Optimus Prime and Megatron and both just own the characters.  No offence to Hugo Weaving, but Frank Welker simply IS the voice of Megatron.  Jeffery Combs, Steven Blum, Sumalee Montano, Gina Torres, Adam Baldwin, and Kevin Michael Richardson all provide their customary excellence as well, bringing life and depth of emotions to what would have otherwise been flat characters.

5187322,5,B008WAM2TW,"I have been a fan of Transformers for years, but I really started to love the series when Armada began back in the early 2000's. Since then, I have seen several of the other continuities that have been made, many of which I felt weren't too good. I got around to watching G1 a few years back, not long after Transformers Animated had ended. Through this, I understood some of the things that I have never picked up on in any of the shows, and understood several references made throughout the trilogy of films.

Transformers: Prime really hits home because it a mixture of the original series, the films, and the latest series of video games, while still living in its own reality. The characters are very well made, and portrayed. The animation is superb, and the action sequences are to die for. Although it is a completely CG (and very abstract) series, it is incredible, and is great for all fans of Transformers, young and old. New fans will appreciate the humor, connection to the films/games, and animation, while older fans will appreciate the callback to every single prior continuity, particularly G1.

5187360,5,B008WAM2TW,"The award-winning ""Transformers Prime"", regarded by many fans as one of the best looking and also best written ""Transformers"" animated series so far, the series is being planned for a third season release for 2012-2013.

With a Blu-ray and DVD release of the first season of ""Transformers Prime"" having been released earlier this year, the conclusion left ""Transformers: Prime"" fans in suspense as the first season concluded with Unicron the Chaos-Bringer attacking the autobots and in a surprising move, Optimus Prime and the Autobots form an uneasy alliance with Megatron.  But in the process, something bad has happened to Optimus Prime, to the point that Optimus Prime has reverted back to his pre-prime identity, the Cybertron librarian known as Orion Pax.

With this second season, the Autobots are tested as Orion Prime now as Orion Pax is being used by Megatron in order to pinpoint areas where Autobot relics may be located.  Meanwhile, Silas of M.E.CH. has targeted both Autobots and Decepticons and found their weakness and try to steal Cybertron T-Cog technology in order to create their own secret army.

Meanwhile, what happens when Starscream and Araichnid go rogue on the Decepticons?  And what happens when M.E.C.H. develops a clone of Optimus Prime known as Nemesis Prime?  Also, what happens when the Insecticons attack the Autobots and who is the newest member of the Autobots?  And what happens when Megatron tries to convert Earth into a new Cybertron?

Find out in ""Transformers: Prime - Season Two""!

What is ""Transformers: Prime"" about?

""Transformers: Prime - Darkness Rising"" would take place three years since the Decepticons have lasted attacked Earth and the Autobots have awaited their return.

One day, Arcee and Cliffjumper went to search for Energon near a rock cliff.  But not long after arriving, he is attacked by the Decepticons and in the process, all the Energon is destroyed but Cliffjumper is captured.

Upset about the Energon, Starscream confronts Cliffjumper and kills him.

But by the time Optimus Prime, Arcee, Bumblebee, Ratchet and Bulkhead arrive to help Cliffjumper, they realize they have arrived too late.  But now they know the Decepticons are back and they are the only five Autobots that must defend and protect humankind.

As Arcee goes to town to let off steam after her friend Cliffjumper has died, a human named Jack Darby who works at a burger shop sees a motorcycle (which is Arcee) and hopes to purchase one when he makes enough money.  And as Jack gets on the motorcycle, he is unaware that Decepticons have arrived and are going after Arcee.

So, now Jack is brought into the fray and Starscream wants both Arcee and Jack dead.  But while trying to escape from the Decepticons, two more humans: a young genius named Rafael ""Raf"" Esquivel and the mouthy foreign exchange student Miko Nakadai see all the action taking place and now their lives are in danger.

Optimus Prime now wants these three to be protected as the Decepticons are after them as they are thought to be assisting the Autobots.

But while Starscream is intent of leading the Decepticons, Megatron, who has been missing for three years, has returned.  And this time, he has Dark Energon and plans t use it to raise an undead army of Cybertronians in order to defeat his nemesis Optimus Prime and the Autobots.  Will five Autobots be enough to defeat Megatron or the Decepticons?

Fortunately the Autobots have some help from their human friends Jack, Miko and Raf, while Agent William Fowler occasionally calls in the Autobots whenever he is in need of help.

But meanwhile, Starscream and his Decepticons is doing all he can to make sure they get the Energons and to find the secret location of where the Autobots are hiding.

As the Autobots take on various new Decepticons who have shown up on Earth, they quickly learn that there are humans, just as dangerous as the Decepticons known as M.E.C.H., a terrorist organization led by Silas who has been in search of ""living technology"".

As for Megatron, despite his body being out of commission, he is trying to be revived by his fellow Decepticons, but will the power-hungry Starscream allow it? And an unforeseen nemesis by the name of Unicron returns.

With season two, what will happen when Megatron tries to set his plans into motion, meanwhile Starscream and Araichnid turn rogue?  As Optimus Prime and the Autobots try to stop the Decepticons from finding any Autobot technology, together, they must work as a team as they must deal with new recruits, Decipticons plus the now, powerful M.E.C.H. who have been successful in their attempts to neutralize Autobots or Decepticons and steal their technology.

VIDEO

""Transformers: Prime - Season Two"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 Anamorphic). The CG animation for this film is absolutely wonderful as we can see details on the metal of various robots. You can see scratches on the metal, the reflection of light and also glass windows and the reflection. But one thing I want to add is that watching this Blu-ray release, there are details that I never saw on the DVD. You can actually see particles, dust, smoke much clearly. You can see scuff marks and even dirt on the robots much more clearer.

The keyword for this Blu-ray release is detail. Having reviewed the original DVD version, having watched the series on television and now watching it in HD, the colors are vibrant, they pop! The CG for mountainous terrain, buildings, sunlight, overall surroundings are just incredible for a television animated series. For one, Polygon in Japan really did a fantastic job with the CG animation but most importantly, as the series progresses, not only does the series get better but there is also an improvement with the overall CG.

From Optimus Prime's glass windows on his chest showcasing reflections to Megatron's steel body, I was quite pleased with how this series looks! But also the amount of detail that was put into this series.

Many TV Series tend to keep things within their budget, especially with the amount of time they have for production. But I was quite thrilled to see how the quality but also hearing the enthusiasm of the staff (as heard on the audio commentary) in the production of ""Transformers: Prime"" and how they listen to their fans.

With that being said, I will say that the series does have its fair share of banding, so videophiles who are expecting pristine quality may be disappointed. Fortunately, not enough to deter people, as majority of fans and children will probably not care. Also, these scenes with banding are short and not long. Typically seen during orange/red backgrounds primarily.

But overall, picture quality is very good. Plenty of detail can be seen on Blu-ray and the clarity is outstanding but most importantly, black levels are nice and deep and colors are absolutely vibrant!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Transformers: Prime - Season Two"" is presented in DTS-HD MA 5.1 and 2.0 Stereo. For a series with this much action, I admit that I, personally was hoping to hear a more immersive soundtrack. But while there are some ambience that can be heard through the surround channels, and some booms that can be heard at times, it's not as powerful or as immersive as I was hoping for it to be. The lossless soundtrack does provide crystal clear dialogue and the musical score sounds incredible but the soundtrack does sound very good, moreso during the action sequences.

The voice acting is terrific and the fact that voice talent Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime) and Frank Welker (Megatron) of the original ""Transformers"" animated series are back for this series...Fantastic!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Transformers: Prime - Season Two"" comes with the following special features:

EXTRAS:

""Transformers: Prime - Season Two"" comes with a cardboard slipcover.

JUDGMENT CALL:

After season one, I proclaimed ""Transformers: Prime"" as possibly the best ""Transformers"" animated series yet.  But great series can be awesome for the first season and easily tank by the second season.  So, does ""Transformers: Prime"" pass the test?

The answer is a resounding yes!

There are major differences that are seen in the second season of ""Transformers: Prime"" and that is more focus on the Autobots/Decepticons but also showcasing the second antagonists, M.E.C.H. and less reliance on the three human characters, who played a big part in the first season.

No doubt that the first season was trying to establish the characters and also trying to test out the waters of what is working and what is not but also what are fans responding too.

Season two of ""Transformers: Prime"" kicked off things with a bang!  With Optimus Prime reverting to Orion Pax, it definitely made you anxious to see where the writers were taking this storyline.  Will something bad happened to Optimus Prime once again?  We have seen how the character has been treated in a various of series in order to capture the attention of audiences.

But the second season tries to bring some of the classic traits of the characters but also bring something new.  Wheeljack as a reckless Autobot was quite interesting to see, to see Megatron intent on killing one of his own was quite surprising and you had some of the Autobots face grave danger with substantial injuries.  You also have a few new characters show up and join the Autobots and the Decepticons and for the most part, building on its storyline and making things a slight bit more mature for the old school fans, but also including Jack, Miko and Raf a bit in order to reach out to a more younger demographic.

So, for the Autobots, there are quite a few things that made things intriguing such as Sylus and the M.E.C.H. now becoming more familiar of Autobot technology, to the point where Sylus now has the upperhand.  You have Starscream doing things on his own once again and almost a nod to the 2005-2007 ""Transformers: Cybertron"" series, the search for keys and relics.

So, suffice to say that season two of ""Transformers: Prime"" has been highly entertaining thus far!

But I know I'm among a small group of fans who have grown up with the series back in the '80s and still have admiration towards the various incarnations of the ""Transformers"" series, still buy the toys occasionally and are passionate about the storyline and how various studios treat the characters and to not stray too far of what fans have come to love about the war between the Autobots and the Decepticons

While the storylines of ""Transformers"" tends to change from series to series, the storyline of a battle between Autobots and the Decepticons still remains. Especially between Optimus Prime vs. Megatron. And as a father who has a child who is just as passionate as I was growing up with the series, I have to say that for me, ""Transformers: Prime"" is wonderful series.

By saying that, of course, G1 will always be true to my heart because I loved the amount of characters (especially the amount of toys produced) and several years ago, I gushed about how much I loved ""Transformers: Cybertron"" because of how many characters were integrated.

With ""Transformers: Prime"", I admit that I was weary at first because of the few characters featured. Similar to ""Transformers: The Animated Series"", we had a core group of Autobots and Decepticons but I'm so used to more characters, the merrier.

Fortunately, as the series progressed, the series not only provided newer characters (even if they appeared in a standalone episode), but what I loved is the modern progression of the series. There was a lot of thought that went into the series rather than just creating a series around the toyline. For example, for the episode ""Predatory"", this was unlike any ""Transformers"" episode I have seen. It was darker, but it fit the character of Airachnid.

For anyone who remembers her character, she has always been deadly and menacing, but this time around, we get to see how dark this Decepticon was in actually torturing the Autobots. And how she collected the heads of those she killed, in a very ""Predator"" (for those old enough to remember the movies) way, as a form of trophy. I admit that I was surprised that the writers were able to pull it off, considering that ""Transformers"" is watched by many youngsters.

But there are other stories that were crafted as if they were targeted towards the older crowd, but safe enough that children can watch it.

And as mentioned earlier, the CG animation for this series is great! Typically, there are a lot of shortcuts taken on TV series but the creators of the series definitely made sure there was a lot of detail on both the Autobots and Decepticons but also various objects and environments. So, animation for ""Transformers: Prime"" was much more than I expected for an animated series but I admit, it is the most ambitious ""Transformers"" animated series yet but the crew managed to pull it off with great efficacy.

And as for the voice acting, the voice acting is wonderful! I was surprised was how many big names they brought in to do voices for the characters. Legendary Optimus Prime voice actor Peter Cullen and legendary Megatron voice actor Frank Welker (""G.I. Joe"", ""Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends"") are back. They are joined by Steve Blum (Logan/Wolverine for ""X-Men"") as Starscream and Ernie Hudson (""Oz"", ""Ghostbusters"") as Agent Fowler. But for any longtime ""Transformers"" fan, the fact that Cullen and Welker are back to do the voices for Optimus and Megatron is fantastic!

As for the Blu-ray release, the animated series looks great on Blu-ray!  I didn't notice any major scenes that had too much banding nor did I see any major use of edge enhancement.  I do wish the audio was much more immersive in terms of LFE (subwoofer usage) and more use of audio (ie panning audio or surround sound usage) during the action sequences, but once again, that is me being picky. Otherwise, the lossless soundtrack is still very good for a TV animated series.

If there was one thing that was a bit of a bummer for ""Transformers: Prime - Season Two"" on Blu-ray, it was the lack of an audio commentary (which the first season had).  But fortunately you do get interviews with the Hasbro Studios production staff and the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con interview featuring Larry King and Peter Cullen, which was a lot of fun to watch!  But it would be great to have more audio commentary included.

Overall, as a longtime ""Transformers"" fan, and as a fan who has appreciated every series, ""Transformers Prime: Season Two"" is highly enjoyable, exciting and a series full of action!  The series is well-acted and the episodes are well-written and it helps that you have people who are fans of ""Transformers"" and respect the past, previous ""Transformers"" versions but worked to create something enjoyable for older fans and also the new generation of fans who are getting into ""Transformers"" for the first time.

If you are a fan of ""Transformers"" or a father who wants to experience the series with their children, I highly recommend ""Transformers: Prime - Season Two"" on Blu-ray!",1354233600,,15493,4.8993108728943335
5187361,4,B008WAM2TW,"The epic conflict between the Autobots and the Decepticons continues in ""Transformers Prime: Season Two,"" a 4 disc DVD or Blu-Ray set collecting the entire 26 episode season of this larger than life CGI television adventure series. The saga of the Transformers looks to its past and struggles for its future throughout this ambitious animated tale of giant robots at war.

""Transformers Prime's"" second season begins with the conclusion of a classic story arc that spanned over a total of 7 episodes; 4 that brought the show's first season to a stunning cliff-hanger ending:

""One Shall Fall,"" and ""One Shall Rise (Parts 1,2,3);""

then continued into the series premiere episode trilogy of Season Two:

""Orion Pax (Parts 1,2,3).""

This great story arc would herald a new direction in the way ""Transformers Prime"" would evolve its storytelling narative as the season progressed. Developing a serial episodic structure similar to Japanese anime television shows that the Transformers concept has some links to, ""Prime's"" creators strove to enhance and deepen the sense of drama in the ""perpetual conflict"" that has put the series' lead antagonists, Optimus Prime and Megatron, at odds with one another for millennia. The early episodes of the new season, like ""Loose Cannons (which introduced the Decepticon warrior Dreadwing),"" were similar in their story format to most of the show's first 26 episodes. But Season Two of ""Transformers Prime"" would come to center on a quest by the Autobot and Decepticon factions to find ancient ""Iacon relics"" from the planet Cybertron, homeworld of the Transformers race. Mysteriously sent to Earth, these relics could tip the balance of power between the centuries-old enemies, giving which-ever side claimed the most of them, the chance at ultimate victory in a cosmic war that devastated the planet of their birth. Even more significantly, a special collection of these relics, ""the Omega Keys,"" offered the hope to regenerate Cybertron, bringing life back to the world of the Transformers.

Thus, the stakes remain high in ""Transformers Prime: Season Two,"" and the makers of this ongoing series continue to make this 21st century version of this decades long entertainment franchise as big in scope and scale as its lead characters. One of the hallmarks of this series is the mortality of these sentient robot beings. This is the story of an ancient war...and in war, there are casualties. Characters on both sides of the conflict, Autobots and Decepticons alike, face injury and violent death during the show. To its merit, ""Transformers Prime"" showcases this reality even more strongly during its second season.

Conflict has consequences, physically and emotionally and this series addresses this fact, perhaps most powerfully in the episode titled ""Hurt."" After Bulkhead is critically injured during a solo mission to find one of the Iacon relics, the Autobot's human companion, Miko, and his fellow Wrecker friend, Wheeljack, team up to wreak vengeance on the Insecticon warrior they learned harmed their friend, the merciless Hardshell. But both Wheeljack, and especially Miko, learn a difficult lesson as their emotional mission almost claims their lives in the process. Young viewers of this show are given serious moral ideas throughout the season to discuss with one another, older fellow fans, and their parents. The Transformers have come a long way from the good 'ol days of Generation One.

Season Two of ""Transformers Prime"" has many exciting highlights. Among some favorites of this reviewer, besides the epic ""Orion Pax"" 3-parter, and the above mentioned episode ""Hurt,"" there includes:

""Nemesis Prime,"" in which the technology terrorist organizition M.E.C.H. unleashes a robotic imposter of Optimus Prime on the American military to create distrust of the Autobots.

""Armada,"" a dramatic showcase of the growing dissension building within the ranks of the Decepticons, as 2 former followers of Megatron mount attacks on the leader of the Decepticons: Starscream, with 5 clones of himself; and Airachnid, leading an army of Insecticons under her control.

""Flying Mind:"" When the Decepticon Warship Nemesis crashlands, Megatron attempts to revive the ship using Dark Energon with an unforeseen result: the craft develops a mind of its own and rebels against the master of the Decepticons, immobilizing everyone onboard. With the Autobots also overcome by the ship's paralyzing ray in battle, Jack, Raf, Miko, and Agent Fowler have to board the now sentient ship and stop it from executing its own dark plans.

""Out of the Past"" is a tale of characters bonding in the past and the present. To comfort Miko, who is emotionally shaken by her beloved Bulkhead's recent injuries in battle, Arcee tells her the tale of how the lady Autobot first became partners with her lost comrade, Cliffjumper, back on Cybertron. Their shared adventure placed them in conflict with Starscream and the Decepticon scientist, Shockwave.

""Darkest Hour:"" To quote Megatron himself: ""...the explosive season finale that will change the Transformers universe forever!"" The Lord of the Decepticons does not exaggerate. This episode is a 22 minute non-stop thrill ride with a truly devastating ending!

The ""Transformers Prime"" series also rewards its audience with its showcase of the development of its characters. From Jack Darby's growing maturity, Starscream's continuing self-serving exploits,to the heavy burden of leadership seen and heard in the heroic vocal performance of actor Peter Cullen (the voice of Optimus Prime), ""Prime"" Season Two elevates the Transfomers saga to new dramatic and emotional heights.

The computer graphic image(CGI)technology used to animate this incarnation of the Transformers mythos continues to impressively display the robotic adventures of Optimus and Team Prime. But CGI animation may also be the source of a disappointing flaw in the production of ""Transformers Prime."" Due to the expense entailed in creating such an ambitious television series, the creators of this CGI show are limited in how many computer animated characters they can portray. Thus, the days of a cast of seeming thousands of Autobot and Decepticon warriors are a thing of the G1 past. The latest collection of Hasbro Transformers toys seem to have less chance to be a part of a product placement campaign in ""Transformers Prime."" But within the ""Prime"" universe, this also means the Transformers seem to exist in exile as ""robots in disguise"" on an Earth with an apparently far smaller human population. When the Autobots meet their human companions in the 1st season, the kids live in the sparsely populated town of Jasper, Nevada. But this production reality also reveals a storytelling weakness. For example, in the episode ""Tunnel Vision,"" Arcee, Jack, Bumblebee, and Miko, travel to New York City in search of an Iacon relic. But when watching the episode, a viewer can't help but notice the lack of New Yorkers actually featured. It's in fact truly disappointing to realize the episode is conveniently written so only one resident of New York shares in Team Prime's Big Apple adventure. This production budget problem plagues ""Transformers Prime"" troughout the season.

Another disappontment with ""Prime's"" second season is the inclusion of two episodes that retell or recap the storyline of the series. These episodes, titled ""Grill"" and ""Patch,"" are also called 'clip shows' because they mostly consist of animation footage or clips from previous episodes edited into an episode that features a limited amount of new animation designed to frame the collected older clips into the desired narative. They are usually produced as a cost saving measure or as a result of the creators of a television series getting behind schedule in the making of a show. Unfortunately these 'clip shows' add very little to the continuity of the ""Prime"" series, and in the case of the ""Patch"" clip episode, its broadcast brought the growing drama of Season Two to an abrupt halt as the show neared its intense season finale. The fact that ""Transformers Prime"" had to include two such episodes in its second season is a frustrating and rather troubling sign for fans of the series. The challenge of producing such an otherwise high quality CGI television show may have proved too much for the makers of the series, Digitalscape Company Limited and Polygon Pictures. This may explain why reports detail that the third season of ""Transfomers Prime"" may have only 16 episodes in contrast to the 26 episodes featured in the first and second seasons of the show.

Despite these shortcomings, ""Transformers Prime: Season Two"" is an exciting addition to the ever expanding Transformers Universe. Paying homage to the mythos of the past while at the same time offering its fans a future that strives for an epic quality, this is a series worthy of its colossal characters and the Transformers legacy.

This DVD collection also includes ""Brand-New interviews with the creative team"" as part of its supplemental material but also features ""Optimus Prime: Up Close and Personal,"" an interview with Peter Cullen by talk show host Larry King, recorded at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con. For fans of the voice of Optimus Prime, this interview is almost worth the price of the set by itself!

To quote the leader of the Autobots:

""We must never lose sight of the fact that upon this Earth, we are titans...and such power must be used wisely.""

Long live Optimus Prime!",1353542400,3,9486,5.215364412344058
5187362,5,B008WAM2TW,"As a long time Transformer cartoon fan and live-action movie hater, I was so pleased when Prime on the HUB Network proved to be more than meets the eye.  The show is entertaining for kids and also edge of your seat for adults.  It takes some of the complexity out of the original idea and gives you 10 to 15 characters to really care about instead of countless toy ideas.  This show, since season 1, has succeeded in bringing a heart and action to what has been missing from the other recent incarnations of the Transformers universe.  If you have lost faith and think  Transformers has nothing left to offer I challenge you to buy season 1 and 2 and just enjoy.  Transformers G1, Beast Wars and Prime stand alone as the only true worthy cartoons.  Armada, Energon, Cybertron, Animated, Beast Machines, Robots in Disguise, and Rescue Bots are all missing what Prime offers.  The Japanese collections are a great view but not if you are just a casual viewer.",1353369600,,957,4.588235294117647
5187363,5,B008WAM2TW,"I would have waited an eternity for a Transformers series that could stand by the side of the original G1 and G2 shows.  This is it, and maybe even better.  The writing on this show is reverent to the original series, the 1986 animated movie, the Marvel and IDW comics, and the recent films.  It is sharp and the stories really bring the characters more dimension, humans and cybertonians alike.  Oh, yeah, the graphics.  We've come a long way and TP shows it.  On BluRay the character detail is amazing...if Optimus Prime has been in a fight, then there is clearly damage from the event.  Last thing...this series will probably be the last time that Megatron and Optimus are voiced by Frank Welker and Peter Cullen, respectively.  There was an old joke on Saturday Night Live that said that the voice box of their famous announcer Don Pardo was being transplanted into a tortoise so that he could continue his role as announcer for at least another 100 years.  I wonder if Welker and Cullen would be open to such a suggestion?",1353024000,2,1027,4.5989010989010985
5187364,5,B008WAM2TW,"My husband was beyond thrilled when we got this to review!  He has been trying basically since my son was born to get him into the shows we watched as kids.  Just recently they started watching the original Spiderman and were equally excited to check out Transformers.  They have been asking to watch it nonstop! It's so nostalgic and fun to share with them things that we grew up on.  It makes it a bonding family experience instead of just watching a show!

This set is the complete season two with twenty six episodes plus bonus features including interviews. Transformers Prime is the newest series in the Transformers phenomenon.  My husband says there is nothing as good as the original but personally, I think there's a lot to be said for modern technology!  It's the same characters we grew up on like Optimus Prime and the Autobots but in a much clearer picture which makes for more believable characters. The graphics are a huge improvement from the original series which makes the Transformers and what they can do even more impressive.

As far as age goes, I think this series would be more for late elementary school aged children and up.  There is some violence which can scare little ones and the use of what I call ""B"" cuss words like jerk.  It may not be considered a swear word but I still don't want little ears hearing and repeating it. I don't want any name calling coming out of my three and four year olds mouths.

Watching this show was nostalgic for my husband and I but I think I'll save it for our eyes and ears only, at least until our kids are a little older and able to discern what is right and wrong to repeat!",1351814400,,1642,4.45819397993311
