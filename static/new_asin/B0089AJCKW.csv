8526195,3,B0089AJCKW,After wading through about 60 pages of video offerings on Amazon about trains and not about trains I was surprised to find this video about the last decade of steam and clicked buy immediately.  Only after receiving it did I find out it is about steam in Australia.  It's OK but I was thinking it would include the last decade of American steam and include my favorite Big Boys and Challengers.  Instead it is about a bunch of steam engines I have never seen before so to me just a curiosity.  It was spelled out in the ad and I missed it.,1348358400,,539,4.254901960784314
