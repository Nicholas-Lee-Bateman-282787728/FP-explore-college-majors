I URGE YOU DO BUY THIS DVD BECAUSE IT CONTAINS INFORMATION THAT YOU WILL NOT GET ON ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, FOX NEWS OR CNN.  THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST DOCUMENTARY EVER MADE ABOUT A WORD THAT EVERYBODY HAS OR WILL USE IN THEIR LIFETIME.  IT BREAKS DOWN IT DETAIL THE ORIGIN OF THE WORD AND WHY WE STILL USE IT TODAY.  THE BEST COMMENT IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE IS WHEN SAMUEL L. JACKSON SAYS ""THE FIRST THING PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ME IS THAT I'M A NIGGA""!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE REST IS HISTORY.  PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD PLEASE EDUCATION YOURSELF ABOUT THIS WORD BEFORE YOU USE IT.",1172016000,3,654,4.371900826446281
2415560,5,B000BF0DBK,"this is the kind of film that will have a healthy discussion on the usuage of the word. it goes back through the history of time in the findings&usage of the word through the years&how it was used. Richard Pryor truly made it Powerful,but also he himself upon going on a trip to Africa den-nounced it.it never went away,but it got re-named&brought back.it has different meanings to different people depends on who you talk to.this film will have you talking&then you have to make up your mind where you stand on the use of the word. but this is the kind of film that is a must see for all people to me.",1145923200,5,602,4.336283185840708
2415561,5,B000BF0DBK,The film immediately bought me into a new and unique way to look at the profound and divisive effects of just one word. The film helped me to experience a set of painful feelings that I had previously not shared.  The broad number of people saying the N word in such various context was a very creative way to help outsiders become insiders to the feelings caused by that word. Congratulations to the writer and director!,1142208000,4,421,4.5394736842105265
2415562,5,B000BF0DBK,"This is one of the best documentaries I've ever watched, and one of the most powerful. It is an exploration of the `N' word, and all the power, hurt, and connotations it has. Most of Hollywood and some of the music community offers their views on the word- when to use it, when not to, who to use it with. But this movie is so much more than that.

It sounds way to much like an after school special to say that this movie will open up a dialogue between you and anyone you watch it with, or explain it to. Yes, this is the case with this film. Once the subject is breeched- and this is the perfect icebreaker to do it with- then you and others can start talking about what this word means to them and how it has impacted them or those they love. Everyone has something to say about it. So listen and learn. It's powerful in a very magical way.

Just don't watch the film and expect easy answers on race or community issues, but do watch the movie and expect to have a very thought provoking experience.

Recommended for everyone, but parents might want to screen this movie before watching it with young children as it has adult subjects and language.

But watch this movie, then watch it with those you love. You'll be glad you did. Talking about these issues is the only way to solve anything.",1139097600,8,1296,4.277551020408163
2415583,4,B000BF0DBK,"This was very, very good and really made me think. The only complaint is that it was repetitive and could have been half the length.",1369440000,,132,4.32
2415584,5,B000BF0DBK,"Okaaay folks, I will start the discussion with this.  The N-Word is an American Concept For Reality--no more and no less than GOD, as god, or MOTHER, for motherhood and so on with our concepts like: FREE, EQUAL and the PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.

I am one from the African American Lineage who have decided years ago to step out of ''ethnic boxes'' before I die and join in the greatest value system in my midst--and that be---Mainstream America-- where American values and concepts for truth and being are born.  But in order to participate in all that I must first be an American--fully-fledged and fully-engaged.  It works best if I'm not fixated and limited to a 'ethnicity'.

THE N-WORD WAS CREATED IN OUR COUNTRY--it goes into the epic and period known as THE ERA OF RACISM & RACIST VALUES.  Most of us know that now--so why is the n-word still a part of our reality aside from the fact it has made some people millions of dollars--but then--the word ""whutz-up"" has been used in billion-dollar campaigns, as well.  But still the smell and feel of that pungent word still sticks to our consciousness and being.  TO BE AN AMERICAN is to accept the fact that the n-word will be blight on your consciousness.  It cuts deep into our American souls but this period is the first time the AfricanAmerican-lineage males are using it freely to make money, to curse at America, and feel its power and its blight.  THIS, I SAY, IS A NORMAL DEVELOPMENT.

Basically it goes like this folks--You Can't Rape People's Souls For Centuries and when you get tired of doing it you want to get up and go on without them ever saying a word about it.  The N-Word is still in the heart and souls of every officer who stops a Black Man Walking.

But my last comment on this word is this: THERE IS NOW A FULL-BLOWN CULTURE IN U.S. CITIES that finds the depth of the meaning of the N-word somehow ""sexy"" and ""powerful"" and ""loving"" and ""connective""--somewhat like an ""ethnicity"" that connects one to the other and there is no shame in these people's proclaimation for this identity--and all of them are NOT dark-hued.  They come in all hues and incomes and backgrounds.  They just like the feel of being the N-word.

2415585,3,B000BF0DBK,"This is a very informative video and useful as a springboard to talk about racial issues in the classroom, however teachers beware that it has a rap video scene with naked women that your students will be shocked by, so you should definitely preview it first and make sure that you skip past that part when showing it to your students. Otherwise, it is definitely a very worthwhile video to show, and will help students open up about this controversial topic.",1343347200,2,459,4.679012345679013
2415586,5,B000BF0DBK,"This is a great documentary!  I highly recommend it to teens and adults alike.  Every so often we all need to be checked about our own perceptions of ourselves and the society we participate in.  It may be a wake-up call for some or simply a refresher course for others.  Never be afraid of knowledge, whether or not you agree with the presentation.",1284076800,,349,4.492063492063492
2415587,4,B000BF0DBK,"This documentary addresses the inflammatory nature of the n-word, but it also includes interviews with many people who find it an acceptable and loving way to greet a friend.  I appreciate the film because it does not attempt to speak for the black community and come down on just one side of the issue.  Rather, it educates the viewer on the history of the word and its present usage.

The N-Word is a great film for young people to see, although with clips from Richard Pryor's routines, there is a lot of swearing and some pretty raunchy sexual humor.  Frankly, though, the average teen who uses the n-word in daily conversation has heard much worse.  Many noteworthy members of the black community weigh in on the issue, including Samuel L Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, Russell Simmons, and Chris Rock, as well as several hip-hop personalities, scholars, and social activists.  Whites, Asians, and Hispanics are also given a voice.

Whatever your race and view of the n-word, you will have to consider an alternative point of view--and isn't that what a good documentary asks us to do?",1244851200,8,1085,4.832432432432433
2415588,4,B000BF0DBK,"The Almighty N word.  Never before has a simple connection of letters carried such an immense variation in meaning, context, or effect.  This is an interesting investigation of the most controversial taboo word ever conjoured up.  Over the course of the past two decades, it has lost much of its raw biting power.

You can credit much of that to the immortal gangsta rap group N.W.A.  In the early 90's, their liberal use of the word partially redefined its context, turning it from a negative term to a positive one.

Actually the N word might have began to lose its edge a few years prior to that, courtesy of Comedic God Richard Pryor.  His frequent use of the word caused a vast wave of reactions.

Today the N word is prevalent in music and movies, and its offensive nature has been diluted.  It's been transformed more into a word of affection.  BUT, it still carries a long history of racism and deragotory usage that is not easy to disregard.

All of this is discussed thoroughly in this documentary.  Hear Chris Rock, Samuel Jackson, George Carlin, Ice Cube, Michael Rappaport, Whoppi Goldberg and other celebrities give their take.  You might be surprised by some of their opinions.

I think the bottom line is this--the N word still carries power.  No overusage of the word will totally seperate it from its earlier attachment to racism, slavery, and inferiority.  Even though social gaps will continue to disintegrate as ignorance and hatred get flushed away, its harsh deragotory roots are not easily disregarded.

This DVD is an excellent conversation starter.",1238889600,,1574,4.857142857142857
2415589,3,B000BF0DBK,"I saw this in my Social Problems class, when we were discussing race and ethnicity. The use of ""nigger"" was used an excessive amount of time, surely to get the point across, however I just found it annoying. A bit long, but informational and midley entertaining. I would recommend renting this on NetFlixs rather than purchasing the movie. Good for a college classroom because it leads to good conversation among students.",1207094400,2,422,4.957746478873239
2415590,4,B000BF0DBK,"Good idea to hear people trying to justify this vile term. It's a shame that so many just don't get it. There can never be anything positive about this word. And one of the subjects, after doing all he can to make the term seem harmless, has to admit that if a white person called him that he would feel some kind of way. In the words of Spike Lee 'WAKE UP!'",1202342400,,358,3.986111111111111
2415591,5,B000BF0DBK,"This DVD really puts things into perspective.  It is not for or against the use of the word, but a commentary among many african americans from all backgrounds that use it.",1185408000,,172,4.548387096774194

8085974,5,B000BF0DBK,"This DVD exemplifies what is problematic among us as black people African-Americans, celebrities such as Whoopie Goldberg, Chris Rock, Quincy Jones, and Samuel Jackson are not an active part  of your everyday black communities, I would of preferred to see more community educators such as Dr. Booker T. Coleman, Maulana Karenga, Umar Johnson, Dr. Phil Valentine, Dr. Francis Cress Welsing, James Smalls, Michelle Alexander, and Jawanza Kunjufu speaking on this issue. The black people who use the N word are disregarding the past history that is associated with this NEGATIVE word, I personally dislike rap or hip-hop noise, so I was not surprised to see the major role this garbage played in the national and international spreading usage of the N word, before you watch this DVD I strongly recommend that you first watch HIDDEN COLORS PARTS 1, 2, AND 3. I was glad to see the transformation of Richard Pryor from being an unconscious entertainer to being a conscious African-American black man after his trip to Africa, I only wish he had taken this trip sooner rather than later. This DVD is a good place to start discussing what is negative and wrong about using the N word.",1425772800,,1178,4.919597989949748

8085979,5,B000BF0DBK,"I sent a copy to a family member that often drops this word out...(We are African-American) so don't get this confused!  In humor this has been a funny expression to me and my ""down-south"" family & friends.  The ""N"" word is like a term of endearment for us but I personally would like to see an end to the use. In light of ongoing racial use and abuse this ""N"" word is more than the light-hearted reference  that I am use to...it is a deep wound for many. Really liked this DVD.",1378080000,,478,4.173913043478261
