8522711,1,B007WVJ1D2,"Totally .......I mean totally a waste of money
Not worth the disc it's put on
Boring very boring
I must say it will be my first DVD to trash",1464307200,,140,3.8620689655172415
8522712,4,B007WVJ1D2,"Starts slow withots of film clips andhistorical/museum art. Improves to become an encyclopedia of the abrahamic and pre_abrahamic creatures ofmyth.  Abit too reliant on modern(horror?) film clips for my taste.....lacking inexpert interviews too, but still pretty unique in cataloging the mythical middle eastern~ european bestiary with a few insights from china and india.",1424995200,,372,6.018867924528302
8522713,1,B007WVJ1D2,"This is not a movie. Even if it were free it is not worth watching. It is a slideshow with a computerized voice that is awful. It does offer some information if you can stand to sit there and watch.  I couldn't.  Stuck it out for about 15-20 minutes and that was more than enough. Do not rent, you will regret it.  Amazon should be ashamed to offer this amateur production and charge for it.",1397692800,2,391,4.1866666666666665
8522714,1,B007WVJ1D2,"Don't waste your money on this film (if you can it a film). I could only stand to watch the first 20 minutes or so of this production. It is more like a slideshow of pictures, and the limited ""voice over"" was actually a computer programmed voice program that didn't do anything to elevate this production.",1336608000,8,305,4.464285714285714
8522715,5,B007WVJ1D2,"one of the best documentaries i have seen in a long time. some very interesting pics and info, well worth a watch.",1335916800,,114,4.2272727272727275
