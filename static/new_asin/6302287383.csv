450226,4,6302287383,"I have always considered 1963's movie ""Papa's Delicate Condition"" to be a sweet,sentimental and very endearing piece of film. The movie is based on silent screen actress Corinne Griffiths' 1952 novel of the same name about her childhood in Texas. It is directed by George Marshall,famous for his working with Laurel and Hardy in the 1930s at Hal Roach studios. It certainly rates high on my list of all time favourite movies.
The film stars Jackie Gleason as railroad supervisor Jack Griffith and his  wife Ambolyn played by Glynnis Johns(soon to become a household name from ""Mary Poppins"").He has two daughters teenage Augusta and the apple of his eye Corrie. Seems ""Papa"" has a more than little penchant for imbibing on occasion,much to his flustered wifes' chagrin. In these times it's teenage Augusta and Amobolyn who ""team"" up against Jack and his only ally little Corrie who adores her doting father. And who can blame little Corrie for her love of a Dad who when trying to buy a small pony and cart for his daughter,ends up buying the entire circus in which they belong? But Jack is really a misunderstood man who will go to any lengths to please his family and others. For example there was a house in the familie's neighbourhood that had an awful shade of purple painted on its' front. Ambolyn comments that she would be eternally grateful to anyone that would remove that blight from her sight. Jack immediately concocts a scheme to trick the owner into believing he has won a contest to have his house repainted(white is the only colour ""available""!).Jack and Corrie are the painters,much to Ambolyns' startling discovery,but it's the thought that earns Jack a respectful peck on the cheek from his wife. In another example to help out a young,poorly paid and mistreated employee of a local drugstore Jack buys the store lock,stock and barrel. He then makes the youngster the manager who is now boss over his former skin-flint employer! Revenge is sweet indeed. When Ambolyn finds out about this financial transaction she hits the roof. Even though Jack has obtained financial backing and part ownership from other friends which will make the store a steady income earner(no dummy is Jack!),his wife is still not assuaged. She mistakenly thinks it's another sign of his ""condition"" and takes the family back to her fathers' house in Texas,one Mayor Ghio,played well by veteran stage and screen actor Charles Ruggles. Many will recall Ruggles voice overs in the cartoons of Rocky and Bullwinkle's ""Aesop Fables"" segments.
Well if the mountain won't come to Mohammed,Jack takes his circus down to Texarkana,Texas just in time to help out his father in laws' re-election campaign. During the parade Ambolyn falls after chasing Jack and Corrie in the pony and cart,hurting her hand. She is a piano player and the doctor says she may never play again. Ambolyn and family return home and Jack returns to the railroad and buries himself in his work,refusing to touch alcohol. A tearful Corrie beseeches her Grandfather to find her Dad which he promises he will and does. Jack returns home only to have second thoughts at the front gate. Ambolyn finally lets go her stubborness and the strains of Jacks' favourite song ""Bill Bailey"" are soon emanating from the household piano,which draws Jack inside and a happily ever after reunion.
Rarely does this film falter and only then to try and further the plot. The relationship of father and daughter here is the keystone of this film and it works beautifully. Even though we never forget who is playing the dad,as there are alot of in-references to the real Gleason in the film,they couldn't have made a better choice for the part. The chemistry between him and little Linda Bruhl(Corrie) was magical. Johns plays the hurt and frustrated wife to a tee and Laurel Goodwin(Augusta) plays her part with just the right amount of teenage angst.
To top everything this movie garnered an Oscar for best song that year;""Call Me Irrresponsible"".Sung by Gleason,in that ""condition"", to a tailors' headless dummy! It has to be seen to be appreciated. One of the Great Ones' finest on screen moments!
All in all ""Papa's Delicate Condition"" is a film I recommend highly. It is presented here in a very good print and transfer in its' original widescreen aspect ratio of 1:78. It's a good and wholesome film for the entire family and,unless you're made of wood,it will tug mightily at your heart strings throughout.",1224374400,5,4452,4.912350597609562
450227,5,6302287383,"This is a classic movie that I don't think got enough attention in it's time. It focuses on Jackie Gleason who is a railroad supervisor and he has one little problem...he drinks like a fish and ends up spending loads of money on crap that he nor his family need. It does have a good ending and his issues are worked out. I am not sure how the message is received by most folks but I have always enjoyed this movie and when it came out on DVD, I just had to have it.

I still regularly watch this movie even as a 30 year old! If you're a fan of Jackie Gleason, you'll love this heart warming movie.",1221782400,4,597,4.016806722689076
450228,4,6302287383,"Based on Corrine Griffith's memoirs, PAPA'S DELICATE CONDITION is a turn-of-the-century story of a man who'd do anything to please his wife and family, except give up drinking. Griffith's alcoholism causes some outrageous behavior, like his awarding the next door neighbor a prize of a newly-painted house, or buying an ice cream parlor so his daughter's dessert will be just as she wants it. He also gives young Corrie an entire circus when all she'd asked for was a pony.

It's a bittersweet family movie that's by turns whimsical and melancholy. Marital problems of an otherwise ""proper"" couple are not at all glossed over. The complicated Jack Griffith is arguably Jackie Gleason's best film portrayal; certainly this character's battle with Demon Booze hits close to home, as well.

""Papa's"" TRIVIA--
Originally planned as a 1955 starring vehicle for Fred Astaire, who lost interest in the project. The script languished for almost a decade until it was reworked for Gleason.

Watch for Barry Livingston (Ernie on TV's ""My Three Sons"") as a boy in church.

The movie's theme song, ""Call Me Irresponsible,"" was a hit record for Frank Sinatra.

For his work as Minnesota Fats in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-HUSTLER/dp/B000O77SPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE HUSTLER</a>&nbsp;(1961), ""The Great One"" received an Oscar nomination.

(6.4) Papa's Delicate Condition (1963) - Jackie Gleason/Glynis Johns/Charles Ruggles/Laurel Goodwin/Linda Bruhl/Ned Glass/Murray Hamilton/Elisha Cook Jr./Charles Lane/Don Beddoe (uncredited: Eddie Quillen/Don Haggerty/Barry Livingston)",1219708800,,1725,5.959514170040486
450229,4,6302287383,"When Jackie Gleason passed some years ago I remember a couple of tidbits from his obituary.  One relates a doctor telling him that he had lung cancer and suggesting that he cut back on his smoking.  Heeding his doctor's advice Gleason cut back from six packs a day to four packs.  Gleason had his own little Algonquin Round Circle that consisted of Salvador Dali and Mickey Mantle among others.  What did these seeming unlike public figures have in common?  A love of the bottle.  Gleason made something of a mark in films after his ""Honeymooners"" heyday.  He was absolutely mesmerizing as Minnesota Fats in ""The Hustler"".  I'm still waiting for a DVD release of ""Soldier in the Rain"" with Steve McQueen.  ""Papa's Delicate Condition"" is an interesting film in that it was probably promoted as a comedy but dig a little deeper it's a sober look at the scourge of alcoholism.  Gleason's Jack Griffiths is one of those larger-than-life gregarious personalities whose impulsive behaviour, usually when soused, that wins over some people particularly his impressionable six year old daughter.  Not so his wife and older daughter.  Why I don't rate this film five stars is it's not written explicitly that Griffiths is a self-destructive personality.  Gleason, probably through personal experience, reads between the lines like he implicitly knows Jack Griffiths.  This is not a slurring, stumbling, stereotypical drunk.  Griffiths on the surface appears rather sober but underneath is destroying himself with liquor.  This is an average film raised to the next level by a great performance.  If your a fan of Gleason's this film is essential.",1215993600,15,1637,5.093984962406015

450231,4,6302287383,"For years I had been vaguely aware of the existence of this film, but wrote it off as being a product of it's time such as  ""Cheaper by the Dozen"", which by todays standard is SO DATED.  Boy, was I wrong.  Papa's Delicate Condition was funny, witty, and refreshing.  Jackie Gleason's sly sarcasm is as hilarious as it is timeless.  For those of you who only know Jackie Gleason from ""The Honeymooners"", you will be delighted to see Gleason's artistry go way beyond his character as Ralph Cramden.  Though the movie is filled with great character actors, Gleason definitely carries the picture.

I found the relationship between the father and his youngest daughter to be particularly endearing.  In one scene, he tells the older sister and the mother to stop ganging up on the little girl.  It is at moments like that which cause the picture to break away from the mold and stereotypes of it's era.

This is a great family picture.  The storyline is simple enough for children to follow along, while the adults will enjoy the great writing, snappy comebacks, and saltiness of the dialogue.

I agree with  the previous reviewer that said that the story was a little weak.  It is for this reason that I am not giving the movie 5 stars.  Do not confuse a weak storyline, however, with great dialogue and acting.  Not only is it entertaining, the color and cinematography make this a visual stunner.

I am surprised that this movie has not made the crossover from VHS to DVD when so many less satisfying movies have.  Perhaps, like myself, they judged the movie by it's cover..and are only now just discovering what a gem it really is.",1102723200,15,1631,4.643356643356643

450425,4,6302287383,"I'm not a dedicated Jackie Gleason fan, but this is a delightful flick for the young and old, based on actress Corinne Griffith's reminisces of her childhood (first expressed in a book by the same name).  It seems little Corrie's railroad-exec father has a slight habit of getting himself into trouble, especially when he falls into his ""delicate condition"" - drinking. Papa does have some problems, but he is truly a man who 1) loves his family and 2) views life from the vantage point of taking advantage of the opportunities it presents.  His antics usually work out for the best for those involved -- just ask soda-jerk Norman and the circus performers -- but the real gem in this movie is to pay attention to what's going on within the scenes.  There's a lot more there than you might think!

The camaraderie between Corrie and her Papa is a delight to watch (he offers to take the blame for her coal-chute-slidden dress because he's ""bigger""); and little Corrie is by no means a Pollyanna -- she's aware that Papa's ""medicine"" is considered a problem, and even her mother says that Corrie may understand things better than all of them. When her older sister snipes ""When are you going to grow up?!"", Corrie's response is, ""Never!  I've seen what it's done to you!""  And some of Papa must have worn off on her, because after failing to make the transition to talkies, Corinne Griffith apparently made a fine life for herself as a writer and real estate investor -- taking advantage of the opportunities that came her way.

Meanwhile, what is Mama's problem?  During the famous ""Call Me Irresponsible"" scene Jack wonders what happened, because Amberlyn used to enjoy his antics when they were younger ... but we see that now, they have their position in society to consider -- especially when they have an older daughter approaching marriageable age whose potential suitors are being cautioned against the Griffiths.  And yet the bond between husband and wife is obviously still strong:  how many men could immediately come up with a way to remove what she considers an unsightly spectacle from his wife's route to church ... and how many women would reverse her decision in a flash, and pick the one tune that would call ""Bill Bailey home""??

Jackie Gleason's delivery is hilarious here, the supporting cast superb, and the sets a bright and wholesome change from much of what is seen today.  If you like good, clean comedy amidst an interesting character study, this movie is worth it!",1408752000,,2491,4.7808857808857805

I recommend it highly. Jackie Gleason was a comedian with his own variety show after "" The Honeymooners "".  I loved him in both TV series and I am very hard to please when it comes to comedies. Along with ""I Love Lucy "" and his 2 comedy series were the only comedy shows I adored watching as a young teen.

450518,5,6302287383,"Jackie Gleason far and away outstrips the actors of today with every possible facet of character acting.
Special effects""? unknown to this genius. My favorite movie of his was Gigot, where he doesn't speak a single syllable. It would tear your eyes right out of their sockets. There isn't a single actor in the business today with the skill Jackie Gleason had in his little finger. A memorial to his skill would never be able to do this man justice. A master of acting, a true musical wizard and a comic the likes of which mankind will never know again. I am not a fan of Hollywood. But I miss THIS man to this day.",1275523200,,615,4.356521739130435

450522,4,6302287383,"Based on Corrine Griffith's memoirs, PAPA'S DELICATE CONDITION is a turn-of-the-century story of a man who'd do anything to please his wife and family, except give up drinking. Griffith's alcoholism causes some outrageous behavior, like his awarding the next door neighbor a prize of a newly-painted house, or buying an ice cream parlor so his daughter's dessert will be just as she wants it. He also gives young Corrie an entire circus when all she'd asked for was a pony.

It's a bittersweet family movie that's by turns whimsical and melancholy. Marital problems of an otherwise ""proper"" couple are not at all glossed over. The complicated Jack Griffith is arguably Jackie Gleason's best film portrayal; certainly this character's battle with Demon Booze hits close to home, as well.

""Papa's"" TRIVIA--
Originally planned as a 1955 starring vehicle for Fred Astaire, who lost interest in the project. The script languished for almost a decade until it was reworked for Gleason.

Watch for Barry Livingston (Ernie on TV's ""My Three Sons"") as a boy in church.

The movie's theme song, ""Call Me Irresponsible,"" was a hit record for Frank Sinatra.

This had to be ""The Great One"" at his cinematic best next to ""The Hustler"" and the ""Smokey and the Bandit"" movies. Jackie has a little problem but he was big in the heart to his daughter. Glynis Johns and Charlie Ruggles are perfect in this movie. Of course there is the music with Jackie singing ""Bill Bailey"" and the classic,""Call Me Irresponsible"".
