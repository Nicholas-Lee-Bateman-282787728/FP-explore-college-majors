1007540,3,630527696X,"This actually isn't a bad PPV to own. The WWF title  match between Randy Savage and Ric Flair is great, though kind of unbalanced. Unfortunately, Hulk Hogan's ego cheapened that match with that ""double main-event"" crap. He apparently made sure the officials would also be very careful about how much emphasis they put on WWF title. Also, Hogan's match with Sid Justice was poor, and the run-in at the end was stupid. I expect that on ""Raw"" or ""Nitro"", but not on a PPV.
Still, it's worth a see for the other matches. The first three serve a good looks at Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, and The Undertaker before they became main-eventers, and again, the WWF title match was a classic. I wish Flair(who's one of my all-time favorite wrestlers)had won, considering this is the only WWF PPV  in print. Still, I guess there was no way they could have known. I wish the WWF hadn't stopped manufacturing the ""Summerslams"", ""Royal Rumbles"", etc.

1007541,2,630527696X,"Surprisingly enough, this WrestleMania is rather weak.  In fact, it turns out to be more like an extended version of Raw Is War.  For one, most of  the matches are disappointing.  The WWF championship match is not the last  match as it usually should be.  It was a fair match, but it should have  been saved for last.  Another disappointment is the last match between Hulk  Hogan and Sid Justice.  Hogan had always been known for weak matches, but  this one ends on a disqualification.  However, the Intercontinental title  match between champion Rowdy Roddy Piper against Bret Hart is worth  watching.  One of the biggest disappointments is Gorilla Monsoon and Bobby  ""The Brain"" Heenan's poor commentating after the WWF title match  as they forget about the match taking place.",965088000,,779,4.9147286821705425

1007723,3,630527696X,"Originating from the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis on April 5, 1992, Wrestlemania VIII was the first indication that the WWF was approaching a crossroads as to what direction it would go next in the post-Hulkamania era.

Billed as the possible end of Hulkamania (with Hulk Hogan supposedly contemplating retirement), the event showcased legendary (albeit aging) veterans like Randy Savage, Ric Flair, Roddy Piper, & the Hulkster, while simultaneously giving notice to its fans that Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, Sid Vicious, and the Undertaker were being phased in as the WWF's next generation of main event stars.

The matches & interview segments: (1 - 10 scale)

1. Shawn Michaels w/ Scary Sherri vs. Tito Santana:

Despite being saddled with an absurd gimmick as ""El Matador,"" Santana, always the reliable veteran, gives the arrogant, young Michaels a solid run before losing out. It is also later hyped that the ""Heartbreak Kid"" is already being groomed to go after the Intercontinental Title, which he would win from Davey Boy Smith before the year's end.
Grade: 8.5/10

2.  Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts vs. the Undertaker w/ Paul Bearer:

A washed-up Roberts, whose evil character was already coming off a losing streak to Savage, is demolished rather predictably in the Undertaker's first pay-per-view as a new fan favorite.
Grade: 7.5/10 (including Roberts' pre-match interview)

3. Bret Hart vs. Roddy Piper (Champion) for the I-C Title:

Great match!  This is a rare ""face"" vs. ""face"" encounter as Hart and Piper pull out all the stops, including instances where both hint at possible ""heel"" turns. A bloody Hart regains the title, much to Piper's chagrin.
Grade: 9/10 (including the related interview segments)

** ""Mean"" Gene Okerlund interviews The Legion of Doom (aka the Road Warriors) who have brought Paul Ellering back into the fold.
Grade: 7/10 (seeing the L.O.D. actually wrestle instead of doing an interview would have been much preferable).

4. Sgt. Slaughter, Virgil, Hacksaw Duggan, and Big Bossman vs. the Nasty Boys, the Mountie, and Repo Man:

This one is only worth a few laughs, with the highlights being a chorus line clothesline served on the Mountie & friends and the guest announcer's (the late Ray Combs) not-so-subtle insults earlier at the villains during their ring introduction.
Grade: 3.5/10

** Bobby Heenan interviews a smug Lex Luger on his pending entry into the WBF (World Bodybuilding Federation).  This is vintage Luger at his self-admiring best. ""Gorilla"" Monsoon gets the best line when he tells the ""Brain"" that Luger is actually even more conceited than he is. Of course, Heenan takes it as a compliment.
Grade: 8/10

5. Randy Savage w/ Ms. Elizabeth vs. Ric Flair (Champion) w/ ""Mr. Perfect"" Curt Hennig for the WWF World Title:

Far and above, this is the best match of the event!  Savage and Flair are able to keep viewers on the edge of their seats wondering who was going to win (as it should be).  With Mr. Perfect's help, Flair dominates most of the match. Savage, however, still manages to fight back long enough to finally regain the WWF World Title and cement his status as a wrestling legend (outside of the Hulkster's shadow).

The segment's finale is also notable as this would be Savage and Elizabeth's last WWF PPV as a team. Hence, the fireworks celebration proved to be a worthy, heartfelt send-off for the famous duo.
Grade: 10/10 (including the related interview segments)

6. Owen Hart vs. Skinner:

Thankfully, it lasted about a minute. Hart deserved a far better win than this.
Grade: 1/10

7. Natural Disasters vs. Money, Inc. (Champions) for the WWF Tag Team Titles:

A waste of time to watch. The Legion of Doom was available, so why weren't they invited to participate?
Grade: 2.5/10

8. Tatanka vs. Rick Martel:

Two great athletes are present, but this isn't a memorable match.
Grade: 7.5/10

9. Sid Vicious vs. Hulk Hogan:

As with Wrestlemania 2, Hogan had a great potential opponent, but again, this plodding match (with lots of rest holds) turns into a major disappointment. A former WWF Champion (the Ultimate Warrior) makes a surprise appearance to save Hogan, but it is to little avail.  This shouldn't have been the match to end the show.
Grade: 4.5/10

Event Summary:

The overall match quality is pretty uneven: two superb championship matches, three relatively solid matches, and four awful ones (three of them in the show's second half).

Unfortunately, the wealth of talented wrestlers displayed at the 1992 Royal Rumble less than three months earlier is not present here. Among the missing-in-action inexplicably are mainstays such as Davey Boy Smith, Kerry von Erich, Jim Neidhart, the Warlord & Barbarian, Jimmy Snuka, Greg Valentine, and Hercules. Their presence is sorely missed.

As a result, without the presence of a few more quality matches, Wrestlemania VIII has a terrific first half, but the second half is a major letdown.  However, if you can find this vhs at a reasonable price, Savage vs. Flair and Piper vs. Hart alone will make it well worth your investment.",1098921600,2,5061,5.014354066985646

This event also featured the classic Intercontinental Title match between ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper and Bret Hart and the grudge match between The Undertaker and Jake Roberts. You also get to see Shawn Michaels take on ""El Matador"" Tito Santana in the opening match.
The tag team title match between Natural Disasters and Money, Inc. is kind of poor and there are a few other average matches but all in all, WM8 was a good show.",1062201600,,711,4.606299212598425

 Shawn Michaels v.s El Matador
Shawn outperformed his opponent in this one just like he always does, overall it was an Ok match and a good way to start the show, but the main thing I'll remember is how stupid Shawn's music sounded being sung by Sherri. Match Length- 10 min.
 Jake Roberts v.s Undertaker
The classic Undertaker, he rose up from every thing Jake did and eventually got the win. Match Length- 6 min.
 IC title match
 Bret Hart v.s Roddy Piper
Both displayed technical skill and still proceeded the match as a streetfight, during the match the two showed respect for each other despite their want to win, the match really told a story and had emotional value, Bret won but the two competitors left embracing. Probally the 2nd best match of WM-8 Match Length- 14 min.

Nasty Boys/Mountie/Repo Man v.s Sgt. Slaughter/Bossman/Virgil/jim Duggan

 WWE Championship
Ric Flair v.s Randy Savage
 Possibly the best title match in WM history, Ric and Randy's performance is the showcase of WM-8, In only 18 minutes the two do every signature move in their arsenals and each keeps coming back for more. Of course Randy had to deal with Ric's cheating in the maylay, Ric is busted open badly and Randy takes a beating, and through the midsts of the action Randy gets Ric by the trunks and gets a stunning pin, a great way to end a great match.
 Rick Martel v.s Tatanka
An Ok match, but just a passing match. Match Length- 5 min.
 Tag titles match
Money Inc. vs Natural Disasters
 Ok match, Natural Dis. are so big their skills are limited in  the ring. Money Inc. wins by count-out a lame thing for a WM. Match Length- 8 min.
 Owen Hart v.s Skinner
 Quick but decisive. Match Length- 1 min.
2nd Main Event
Hogan vs Sid Justice
 A terrible match, Sid gets the powerbomb and Hogan does his usual hulking up. Papa Shango runs in and helps Sid hurt Hulk, then the Ultimate Warrior comes to Hulk's aid and chases the bad guys out and the show comes to an end.

7887354,4,630527696X,"Hoosier Dome, Indianapolis, Indiana. All I have to say is what a WrestleMania this was. Definetely one of the better ones. Let's get started.

Shawn Michaels w/ Sensational Sherri vs. El Matador Tito Santana

Great opening matchup with back and forth action. Michaels is able to pull it off after countering a slam attempt by Santana. After the match, Bobby Heenan said ""this man is the star of the 90's, Monsoon."" How true those words would be, as we all know, Michaels would go on and dominate the rest of the decade.

Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts vs. The Undertaker w/Paul Bearer

Not much to say about this one. Pretty slow and boring match. Roberts nailed a couple of DDT's, but Taker gets up from them all. Taker hits the tombstone on the outside of the ring, tosses Roberts back in the ring and covers him for the 3.

Intercontinental Championship: ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper vs. Bret ""Hitman"" Hart

Along with the World Championship match, this was the match of the night. Classic battle for the IC title. Started off with nice techincal wrestling, and after a while we started seeing the street fighting style. Piper locks on the sleeper but Hart counters into a pin and wins the match.

8-Man Tag Team Match

The Big Bossman, Virgil, Sgt. Slaughter, and ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan vs. The Nasty Boys, The Mountie, and The Repo Man

Boring match. Very unorganized and sloppy match, skip at all costs.

World Championship: Ric Flair w/Mr. Perfect vs. ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage

The highlight of the night as far as I'm concerned. 5 star classic. Savage used the tights and got the pin and is the new champion.

Tatanka vs. Rick ""The Model"" Martel

Sub-par match at best. Tatanka gets it on a cross body.

Tag Team Championship:

Money Inc. w/Jimmy Hart vs. The Natural Disasters

Definetely could have been a better match. Dibiase and I.R.S. could not match the power of the Disasters, so they walk away in the middle of the match. Disasters win by count out but do not win the titles.

""The Rocket"" Owen Hart vs. Skinner

Kind of a pointless match really. Short match, Hart (RIP) rolls him up for the quick victory.

Hulk Hogan vs. Sid w/Harvey WhippleMan

This is the co-main event. In my opinion the matches should have been reversed (with the Savage-Flair match being the last match of the night) but of course, Hogan is in this match so this is the last match of the night. Not a good match, and an even suckier DQ ending. Papa Shango comes out at the end and then Warrior comes to help out Hogan.

Matches to look out for: Michaels/Santana, Hart/Piper, and Savage/Flair.",1126915200,3,2566,4.632743362831858
7887355,4,630527696X,"As others have noted, Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage almost always finds himself in the unenviable position of having to drag a match out of a opponent who's talent is somewhat lacking.  WrestleMania VIII shows what happens when Savage is paired up with someone who can actually give a good match.  As with III (Steamboat), VII (Warrior), X (Crush) he is able to put out a classic performance.  So onto the card

1.  Tito Santana vs. Shawn Michaels - pretty good opener 3 1/4 *

2.  Jake the Snake vs. The Undertaker - Undertaker also has the same problem as Savage in that he is given a bad opponent.  Jake however was a good fit for him.  3 1/2 * s

3.  Bret hart vs. Rowdy Roddy Piper - Great match.  Back and forth good action.  Everyone knew Bret had to win so the way they made it go down worked really well and kept fans interested 4 stars

4.  Mountie, Repo, Nasty Boys vs. Sgt. Slaughter, Duggan, Big Bossman and Virgil - average match  3 stars

5.  Ric Flair vs. Randy Savage - Unbelievable, great match.  This should have been the main event.  The fact that they put the Hogan match as the main event instead was an insult.  Any Savage gets the victory after a some brawling with a roll up.  5 star match !

6.  Rick Martel vs. Tatanka - ok 2 1/2 *s

7.  Money Inc. vs. Natural Disasters - not great 2 star

8.  Skinner vs.  Owen Hart - Skinner??? nuf said

7887357,3,630527696X,"Just many of the wrestlemania back in the late 80's and early 90's there are many time filler matches to get ready for the big matches but there were some good action to make this one of the better wm's.  Here's the card and my opinion of the matches and the show overall.

Rating:  ***** = Classic;  **** = Excellent;  *** = Good;  ** = Fair;  *=Poor;  DUD = Horrible, fast forward

1.  Tito Santana vs Shawn Michaels

- Michaels make his debut as a singles wrestler.  Santana was a good choice into helping him become a threat.  The match had a few boring parts to it but overall a good technical wrestling match.  I wished they would've had a better ending than having Santana try to slam Michales back in the ring only to have him fall down and get pinned.  Despite the few restholds and the bad ending, this was a decent match.

Rating **

2.  Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts vs Undertaker

- This was Roberts last match until Royal RUmble 1996.  He and Taker were good friends until Taker refused to attack Savage during his match.  Roberts locked Taker's hand in a casket and whacked him a few times with a chair.  The match was pretty much an Undertaker squash.  The only reason I'm giving it the following rating is the part where Jake delivered 3 DDT's but Taker got up and the part where he tombstones roberts on the concrete floor.

Rating *

3.  Rowdy Roddy Piper vs Bret Hart

- Bret was enjoying a successful run as the IC champion until he got sick and lost the title a few days before the royal rumble.  Piper won the belt and now Bret wants his belt back despite they're long friendship.  You can tell this would be a match to see as both were fan favorites.  Despite Piper's dirty brawling skills which busted open Bret's forehead, Bret technicial skills helped him prevail.  The match ended when Piper thought about hitting him with a ring bell instead used his patent sleeperhold only to be countered into a cool pinning combination

Rating *** 3/4

4.  Nasty Boys, Mountie, and Repo Man vs the late Big Boss Man, Virgil, Hacksaw Jim Duggan, and Sgt. Slaughter

- the match had a few comical moments when Ray Coombs made fun of the heels and the part where Repo Man went to jump on the Boss Man only to have the boss man sticks his fist up and hit Repo in the groin.  The match was just a typical brawl with hardly any excitement.

Rating 3/4

5.  Ric Flair vs Randy Savage

- Savage again has a great match at a wrestlemania.  The feud was about Flair claiming he had an affair with Elizabeth in the past and the world championship.  The match was just awesome as the match went back and forth.  Good wrestling and brawling makes this a great match-up.  The activities after the match was fun to watch.

Rating *****

6.  Tatanka vs Rick Martel

-Tatanka's first match in the WWE much less a ppv against the veteran Rick Martel.  The match wasn't too exciting to watch, but it's better than some of the matches on the card.  Tatanka wins with a high cross body.

Rating *

7.  Natural Diasters vs Money Inc.

- Boring tag title match.  Natural Diasters pretty much dominated the match and Money Inc took the cowards way out by getting counted out.

Rating 1/4

8.  Owen Hart vs Skinner

Like I mentioned earlier, this is a filler match.  Skinner dominates the match until Owen rolles him up for the pin.

Rating DUD

9.  Hulk Hogan vs Sid Justice

- I guess this was supposed to be a match to help Sid be a threat for a championship.  WWE didn't learn their lesson as Sid was in the main event for the heavyweight title against the Undertaker five years later at wm 13.  Sid pretty much stalled around the ring and only executed a few moves.  The only real highlight of the match was when the Ulimate Warrior came out and took out Papa Shango and Sid.

Rating *

Overall, the show contains a bunch of worthless filler material but there were some shining moments that make up for the crappy matches.  The bad was kept short.  Savage and Flair was a classic.  Michaels put on a decent performance in his first single match at WM as well as Bret Hart.  The heavyweight title match, IC title match and Santana vs Michaels were all good matches and worth checking out.  Highly Recommended.",1109203200,,4200,4.380704041720991

1. Tito Santana vs. Shawn Michaels 8/10

Good opening match. Good efforts on the part of both men.

2. Jake The Snake Roberts vs. The Undertaker 9/10

I liked this match because Jake Roberts is no competition for The Undertaker. So because of that Jake got beat up real bad. That was funny.

3. Bret Hart vs. Rowdy Roddy Piper 8/10

I liked this match, and perhaps one of the best of the night. It had a lot of action in it, but it was a little obvious that Bret was going to win.

4. The Mountie, Repo Man, and The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobbs and Jerry Saggs) vs. Sgt. Slaughter, Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Big Boss Man, and Virgil 7/10

Okay match, but I thought it was going to be way better. The beginning was funny with the introducments of the teams. What made this match bad was that it was really short. To make it longer or better, they should had made it one of those Survivor Series matches.

5. Ric Flair vs. Macho Man 9/10

Excellent match, with a lot of action! It went a little long, but it is worth it because Macho Man becomes the new WWE Champion!

6. Rick Martel vs. Tatanka 7/10

Good match, especially since it was after the WWE title match. I hated the ending though because Tatanka defeates Rick Martel.

7. Ted Dibiase and I.R.S. vs. Earthquake and Typhoon 6/10

I did not like this match at all. Not only did the Natural Disasters did not win titles (who had the match won practicly), but they won by Count-Out. Dissapointing

8. Skinner vs. Owen Hart 6/10

I do not know what this was, was it a spare match or a pointless one, I do not know. To be honest it was okay even though it was like a minute long. Good match to kill time.

9. Sid Justice vs. Hulk Hogan 7/10

Bad main event. It was sort of slow, and the match ended with Hogan winning by DQ. This happened because Papa Shango came to help Sid Justice, and then Ultimate Warrrior came to help Hogan.
