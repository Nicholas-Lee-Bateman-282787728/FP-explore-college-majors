8713271,5,B00AA9QKBO,"Eternal TAO is the first Opera of a multi faceted artist, Kyong Mee Choi who is a composer, painter, choreographer, director, and producer.  This Opera is not typical what is expected of the western traditional opera with beautiful arias intertwined with silly plots and character development. It provides magical audio visual experiences of continually changing and morphing visages accompanied by beautiful music which blends the Eastern Philosophy through the western musical medium.
This DVD leads the audience into the realm of mysterious and transient dreamy world by haunting visual effects and movements of dancers incorporated with stunning music.  The composer conveys the messages of Tao Te Ching by weaving eastern mysticism of philosophy of Tao through Western  musical & visual medium.",1363392000,,799,5.586776859504132
8713272,5,B00AA9QKBO,"The multimedia opera "" The Eternal TAO"" is absolutely awesome and certainly a masterpiece.  It depicts some essential TAO's philosophy viscerally, I felt it
cosmic, mystical and symbolic, wrapped around the ambiance of IMPERMANENCE.  Those fluid and floating movements of dancers like flowing water in circular motion are
particularly impressive, the idea and image of flowing water being one of the essential metaphors of TAO.",1359763200,3,427,5.553846153846154
