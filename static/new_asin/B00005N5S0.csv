7946255,1,B00005N5S0,"Judd and Little Moon was an incredibly bad movies with the poorest acting I have seen.

The Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis movie was marginally better",1154563200,2,147,4.653846153846154
7946256,1,B00005N5S0,"the movies on this disc might be good,but from the very poor transfers here(droped audio,picture drop-out and freese pictures ,and all the movies were very very dark almost not watchable)you would never know. skip this mess and look for these movies elsewere!!!",1151020800,3,261,5.238095238095238
7946257,3,B00005N5S0,"I picked this up when I was first building my DVD collection.  I wanted a copy of SUDDENLY but this was the only DVD issue of it I could find at the time.  Being somewhat of a Rat Pack fan, I thought I was getting a great three-for-one bargain.  While SUDDENLY is a classic film noir (and one of Frank Sinatra's best films), the Sammy Davis western comedy and the Dean & Jerry films are dogs.  I'm gonna replace it with one of the bargain priced reissues of SUDDENLY that are now available.",1104537600,18,490,4.236559139784946
