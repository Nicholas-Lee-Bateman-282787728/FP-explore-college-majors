7909327,4,B00000I23A,"""Pudd'nhead Wilson"" is, in my opinion, one of Twain's underrated works, providing a scathing indictment of Missouri slaveholding while keeping intact the Twain sense of humor. The story is very ably told in this telepic, with a lot of good acting, particularly by Lise Hilboldt as Roxy the fair-skinned slave girl. Her performance in nothing short of stunning, particularly in the authenticity of her pure slavelike dialect. Ken Howard, as Wilson, has moments of clunkiness, but is never more powerful as when defending a point of honor. The rest is very serviceable, the cast competent to the task, the writing well-measured in maintaining the purity of Twain's prose. An excellent and thoughtful study in slavery from someone who saw it firsthand.",997660800,6,749,5.198347107438017
