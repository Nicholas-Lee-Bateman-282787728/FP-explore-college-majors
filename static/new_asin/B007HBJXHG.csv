8516560,3,B007HBJXHG,"Morgus is a always treat considering anyone's recollections of this Higher Order experiments. But, it's rarity of 30 years or so back doesn't mean the cost has to be as high at almost $80 plus tax! When the morgus.com website is up, it's considerably lower. To make matters more undesirable, there's only FOUR episodes in Vol. 1 (the only volume of 4 in 52 episodes created by WDSU for local Channel 26 in 1987-88 - count them,..4!).

And I introduced the New Orleans Ice House Gang to my daughter at an early age, now she is hooked! I just ordered this DVD and got her a Morgus T-Shirt for her 29th birthday! She was ecstatic! That makes me happy! 
She received the DVD sooner than expected (from New Orleans) in two days! That also makes me happy! ",1431475200,3,397,4.424657534246576

8516565,5,B007HBJXHG,"Dr. Morgus, though always in reruns on local New Orleans station Fox 8, is the last remaining horror hosts to grace the airwaves. It stars Sid Noel as the mad eccentric Dr. Momus Alexander Morgus, decorated member of the very prestigious and secretive ""Higher Order"" science group and founder of Momus Alexander Morgus Institute (M.A.M.I). The good doctor lives deep in the heart of the French Quarter amongst the Ice houses and is constantly experimenting away, seeking to cure the world's ills. (Such as shrinking people down to a fraction of their original height due to concerns of food shortages)

Always by his side is his hooded lab assistant Chopsley, a old school mate that Morgus did facial transplant surgery on. Unfortunately it left him without a face, hence why he wears the mask and is relatively silent.

The show is bit of a cultural touchstone for many residents of Louisiana as well as some parts of the Eastern U.S.

If you find yourself enjoying this DVD, please consider picking up the recently re-released ""Wacky World Of Dr. Morgus""",1367971200,8,1056,4.888268156424581
