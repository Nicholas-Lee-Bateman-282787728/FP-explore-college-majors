8575665,5,B00BYMZ116,"This was one of my favorite 1950's movies. Love the title song by Nat King Cole.....I will admit this film is a lot campier than I remembered. What I thought was a very romantic and visually beautiful movie ......is really just plain funny.  The acting is not very good but I still love this film...I laughed a lot...It is one of those ""bad movies we love"". Have watched it more than 7 times since I got this dvd.....can't get enough.....Thank all who made it possible.",1378252800,2,469,4.517647058823529
