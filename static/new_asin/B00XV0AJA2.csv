7199712,5,B00XV0AJA2,"This DVD was exactly what I needed. Like many people, I'm a very visual person and the upgrade from text and images to sound and video really helped increase my absorption of information. On top of Luis's great wealth of knowledge, he also knows how to structure and present it in a detailed manner while also keeping you engaged. There were ideas covered in this DVD that have always been grey areas in fencing for myself. Now that I have answers, I can train and experiment with these ideas. I also really like the direction Luis is taking with the visual aids he has created for abstract ideas. Overall this is a great product, and you will benefit watching this.",1432252800,,666,4.558333333333334
7199713,5,B00XV0AJA2,"I'm a HEMAist - longsword mostly - so that does colour my review. An experienced practitioner will find much of the technical content will be familiar, but between the remaining new technical content and the systematization and tactical tools there is much to take away. Mike Edelsons review quote on the DVD cover goes Have you ever heard the expression, You don't know what you don't know?, but for the reviewer it was equally true that he hadnt fully known or appreciated what he already knew. Several times Luis expounds a principle that the reviewer was aware of but failed to explicitly call out in drilling or freeplay.

In terms of immediate take-aways for the HEMA practitioner, the DVD features some example drills almost offhandedly, the main focus being on the principles they illustrate, which can be immediately lifted for ones own use. The explicit highlighting of principles also lends itself to immediate inspiration for further training drills. Luis does highlight several places where the principles may be altered by different weapons: whether lighter, with hand protection, or two handed, but for application to sword-fighting more distinctions and adjustments might have been made.

The DVDs layout is interesting in there are options to run it both forwards (technique chapters before systematization) and backwards. There is also the option to play it without the add-ons chapters. These include both summaries of the main chapters and details on certain techniques and tactical options elsewhere discussed. Theyre also probably the most informative part of the DVD, so should be regarded less as add-ons and more as prime content. Production values are, it should be noted, quite high. Visuals are clear, sound quality is great (birdsong in some sections is captured at a volume that charms rather than interferes) and the participants repeat things with enough repetition and variation that you won't need to be poised over the rewind button to understand whats being done.

Overall, the DVD forms a useful supplement to historical sources for the historic European martial artist, not just for its immediately applicable technical and tactical content, but also as a model of how to systematize and analyse combat.",1432252800,4,2241,5.236768802228412
7199714,5,B00XV0AJA2,"Within the several martial arts I have experienced, the focus has always been the same: technique, technique and technique!
Then, upon trying to make the transference to combat, everything goes sour. Even worse, those with a good sense of tactical opportunity are seen as natural talents and rarely have I seen instructors questioning whether they could have done more in order to improve the learning of tactical skill. Well, this DVD has been an amazing positive surprise. Personally, I find the info on footwork, parrying and defensive manoeuvre selection as practical and straight forward as unparalleled. Lastly, the overall systematization of combat is extremely useful.
Weapon wise, the DVD focuses mostly on the baton / walking cane, while also covering the staff when these weapons happen to vary. However, by including defensive manoeuvres common in Eskrima and Rapier fighting, and explaining their use as an adaptation to distance, starting position, reaction time and weapon specificity (such as the existence of crossguards), this DVD is made to fit and successfully help out martial trainees from all weapon arts.",1432252800,3,1128,5.378531073446328
7199715,5,B00XV0AJA2,We look forward to further coverage of the many areas mastered by the authors,1432166400,,77,4.571428571428571
7199716,5,B00XV0AJA2,"I consider myself a researcher in terms of fighting methodology and I have to say that this new work of Luis Preto is a big short-cut in the learn how-to fight process. It`s logic, easy to follow and gives you no chance to disagree. Why? Cause logic and hours of fighting experience prevails in this phenomenal work.
I`ve seen a lot of DVD`s and it`s the first time I`ve seen a DVD with everything one needs, from beginner to advance, in the craft of using weapons: strategy, tactics and techniques are everywhere, but the way to put it together takes time and pain. Luis Preto makes those bridges for you  gives you a decision pyramid and accelerates your thought. It`s up to you to put it into play.
If you think it`s expensive you are wrong! Every second of it is gold, so it`s really cheap if you look at it well.
The new DVD on Decision making in weapons combat from Professor Luis Preto is one of those DVD`s that one needs to have in his/her collection. It will make you a better fighter, a better coach and it will place you in the cutting edge of weapons fighting training.

7199717,5,B00XV0AJA2,"I found the contents to be innovative and insightful, and their presentation very well put together.
The structure presented of combat is extremely helpful, as are the guidelines for choosing between different counter attacking options.
I am already playing around with the concepts in training and seeing some very pleasing improvements, while also starting to feel more confident in my ability to read combat's different scenarios and react accordingly.
Additionally, the production value is also high, making the DVD quite pleasant to watch.",1431993600,,544,5.566265060240964
8716631,4,B00XV0AJA2,"An excellent, well-constructed instructional on basic weapons striking and counter-hitting - while not specifically targeted to any particular martial art, it will resonate most strongly with those using longer weapons such as Western broadsword, Thai krabi krabong, and various styles of spear and staff.  Luis' stylized stances and footwork from Portugeuse jogo do pau may make it difficult for some styles of weapons fighting to recognize themselves in the movement and tactics - however the value of the concepts should be generally translatable by anyone coming from another art.

Luis has done a good job to make the material presentable at a training pace - those simply watching for new ideas may find it a bit slow but should remind themselves that, as a reference while training, this is very well timed and packaged.",1446336000,,827,5.164179104477612
8716632,5,B00XV0AJA2,"Just finished watching the DVD and I have to say that I recommend its purchase to every serious martial artist.

The sound and video quality is excellent, making the content easily understood.

One of the things that I most liked in this DVD was Luis focus on several aspects of fighting that are often forgotten when the technique is taught. Managing distance, parrying and counter- attack options are presented as solutions depending on the combat situation and type of attack. The tactics involved in these decisions are explained with great detail and are always supported by combat situation examples, executed by Luis and his training partner. A summary of the analysis is given at the end of each chapter, helping the viewer to simplify the options he has whilst in a combat situation. Some of these summaries are not condensed enough, and I would suggest taking this into account for future DVDs to avoid confusing the viewer.

I believe that this DVD is not only useful to weapon fighting martial artists. Luis analysis of combat situations can be easily extended to those in which both opponents are unarmed, due to its practicality and down to earth approach. Fighting concepts, once understood, can be adapted to different scenarios.",1445212800,,1245,5.004830917874396
8716633,5,B00XV0AJA2,"The DVD attempts to answer the question of what do I do? when faced with an opponent: of all the techniques and moves, attacks, parries and ripostes which Ive learnt, which should I actually use when faced with someone attempting to harm me (either sportingly in sparring or in reality)? Some things can only be answered generally (pay attention and try to distract the opponent), others can be systematized based on a number of principles. This DVD does both and is obviously of most value in the latter. It provides a systemization of combat  how to avoid being hit, which riposte should be made, how to combine strikes, how to finish the opponent off.

Luis Preto is a very accomplished jogo do pau practitioner and that clearly informs this DVD. It is mainly about cutting rather than thrusting, and in fact most of the examples use the wooden baton (walking stick). The jogo do pau staff is also used when there are differences (and also similarities) with two-handed weapons.

It takes the martial heritage seriously, so there is an emphasis on establishing a sound defence and not getting hit. Also, when one hits an opponent, one finishes them off with numerous strikes.

Speed is also emphasized, e.g. which is the best (quickest) riposte after a parry

It is also worth noting that the DVD has high production values - gorgeous locations, good music, and clear pictures. From a pedagogical point of view, the DVD is also well done: Ideas are explained, demonstrated a number of times and then summarized, and then theres a summary of the end of each section. You can also view the content in two different orders: from technique to combat or from combat to technique and there are also more advanced, extended discussions of some points.

All in all it is a very good DVD which provides a lot of food for thought.",1441929600,,1823,4.735015772870662
8716634,5,B00XV0AJA2,"I was mentored in Jogo do Pau by Luis Preto each evening over a month. The contents of this DVD reflected the points he repeated patiently as I learned. I enjoyed the audio/visual atmosphere and appreciated the honest and straightforward attitude offered by Luis in this DVD. I anticipate mixed martial arts mentors will be pleased to purchase this DVD particularly when instructing techniques pertaining to baton, staff or longsword. I thank you for considering my short review, Raphael Chavardes",1436918400,,497,5.225
8716635,5,B00XV0AJA2,I like the way Luis breaks down technique and his attention to detail. He is very analytical and thorough in his explanations. He clearly has a lot of knowledge in this area and knows his stuff! What I also like is the understanding of body mechanics. Irrespective of what art you do the information gained from this would be useful for any martial artist.,1436572800,,356,4.578125
8716636,5,B00XV0AJA2,"This is likely the best ever instructional DVD on combat tactics.
Super clear demo, great DVD concept, fabulous editing and just great advice on combat training.
It is a must-have for anyone who wishes to take combat training to the next level.
I have watched several times and it still keeps teaching me new tricks. Great value for money....it is and hour and a half of pure combat insight!!!
Super work...and a super DVD!",1433548800,,423,4.72972972972973
8716637,5,B00XV0AJA2,"As with all of Luis' books and DVDs, it's a well thought out product that gets right to the heart of the essentials of martial arts training, and gets us thinking about basics that are often overlooked. Production value is improved over the last DVD, and the section re-caps are particularly useful.",1433289600,,299,4.769230769230769
8716638,5,B00XV0AJA2,"Luis Preto does a great job in portraying the tactics of Jogo do pau on this DVD, I myself have been practising jogo do pau for some years, and find this DVD as a very clear and deep analysis of the core concepts of the art. However, this work isn't clearly about jogo do pau in particular, Luis Preto takes his analysis of the art and explains it in a way that is universal and could be used by anyone using similar weapons. Everything is logic and clear but nothing is given without explanation or as a set rule, all concepts are explained and contextualized, not only what you should be doing, but why and in what situation, so you are not just repeating what you are told to do, but really understanding why every single action you take is done.
To add to that, he gives you drills with game mechanics, that are so much more interesting and better learning tools than simple sequences, so that you not only understand, but are able to internalize the concepts at a deeper level than just theoretical understanding or as a muscular/instinctive reaction, and thus are able to use them tactically.",1432944000,,1098,4.522613065326633
8716639,5,B00XV0AJA2,"It is no secret that I am a fan of Luis Preto's work, and quite fond him as a personality. But then again, he constantly delivers good products and manages to find the approach and/or aspect of training in martial arts that had not been tackled before, or at least not in such a competent and comprehensive manner. This DVD is no exception.
Luis does not start with the generic talk about how to make your strategy, tours and opponent's strengths and weaknesses etc. No, his approach is based on the analysis of what actually happens in most armed encounters. Therefore, the material in the video addresses the options, problems and solution in the sector of offense, defense, counter attacking etc.
Still, that is not the best part! For me the absolute treat of this presentation are the chapters on Combat management, Decision pyramid for selecting countering options, and Guiding rationale for the counters with double-handed weapons.
In other words, this is a pretty unique product in the field at the moment, so you really should treat yourself and obtain it. If you are an instructor in combat with impact weapons of any sort, as well as with any bladed weapon that does rely entirely on stabbing, then this should be mandatory watching.
Oh, and kudos to Patrick Scheling for the selection of filming locations, it really made the viewing experience even more pleasurable.",1432684800,4,1378,4.8931623931623935
8716640,5,B00XV0AJA2,"The information on setting up a defensive system is superbly presented, both in content and simplicity. The tactical systematization of combat is super useful and the decision making pyramid superbly clears up when to perform each counter attacking option in combat.
As good as it gets regarding content, presentation and production.",1432425600,,333,5.549019607843137
