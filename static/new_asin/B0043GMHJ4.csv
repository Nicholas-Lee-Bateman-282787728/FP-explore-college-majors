8414950,4,B0043GMHJ4,Definitely not new tapes; reason for not 5 stars.  Some worn quite a bit but still well worth the money as I loved Dean Martin.  The picture is not too clear and some loss of color experienced.  They arrived in 2 days and in good condition otherwise.,1408233600,,250,4.276595744680851
