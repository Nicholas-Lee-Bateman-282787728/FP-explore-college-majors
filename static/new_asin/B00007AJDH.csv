7974765,4,B00007AJDH,"I love a good swashbuckler classic, & you get a pretty good collection here for a very low price. Captain Kidd stars Charles Laughton in another great villanous role, & Randolph Scott, who was 46 at the time(!), as the man determined to bring him to justice. Considering it was made in 1945, the picture quality is pretty good. This is a fun classic for swashbuckler fans. The Son of Monte Cristo is definitely one of the corniest movies I've ever seen! Most of the dialogue is unintentionally hilarious, but it was very entertaining & makes the perfect movie for a rainy night! It stars Louis Hayward, George Sanders, Joan Bennett (who was in several great film noirs), & Clayton Moore (the Lone Ranger!). Long John Silver's Return to Treasure Island is the fun sequal to Treasure Island, & Robert Newton once again plays a pirate to perfection! The picture quality is below adverage, but the film itself is great. This is probably the most entertaining of the three films thanks to Newton's over-the-top performance that kept me laughing the whole way through! These aren't masterpieces, but they're great fun for the whole family & well-priced.",1083628800,78,1147,4.857142857142857
