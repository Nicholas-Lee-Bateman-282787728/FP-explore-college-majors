1637991,5,B00005O0AJ,"This movie very authentically translates the novel, of the same name, by Marguerite Duras.  The novel was considered to be partially autobiographical, and Duras reveled that this was so.  The movie does not stray from the book and does a wonderful job of bringing the mood and feeling of the book to life.",1404345600,7,305,4.735849056603773
1637992,4,B00005O0AJ,"The mood of the movie captures the languorous, steamy conditions inhabited by the expats and very rich living in Saigon at the time against the backdrop of the illicit (shocking for the time!!) affair between the young French woman (girl) and the Chinaman wealthy beyond her family's dreams and yet utterly out-of-bounds by the social/racial mores of the time.  An amazing debut by a young Jane March.",1402099200,,401,4.985074626865671
1638023,5,B00005O0AJ,"This is such a great movie. It's very erotic without being overkill on the nasty stuff. The story line is good and keeps you interested and the acting is superb.  I wouldn't necessarily call it a  ""love story"" but in a way, it is. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under the age of 17, as it surprisingly showed penetration at one point in the movie. The movie didn't show creativeness in it's sexuality, which is good, as the girl was supposed to only be 15 years old. But it was a different time and place, where it's common for most girls that age to be sexually active. I have loved this movie for years and if you're a woman, I think you will too. Now for the question, would I call it porn? No, more like an HBO soft porn, however, it's actually more like a blockbuster than a soft porn. Even though it shows a lot more sex than your actual blockbuster, the story line and the overall look of the movie shows that it is definitely not a soft porn movie and should get much more credit than to be called such.",1499126400,,1015,4.2

1638030,5,B00005O0AJ,"This is a beautiful movie. I don't mean plot or spiritual insight. I mean that the experience of watching the film for the beauty of the landscape and the cities and the people is lovely. There isn't a lot of dialogue but it's not really necessary. However, Jeanne Moreau does the voiceover and I would would listen to her read the phone book. There is a lot of naked which should be obvious from the title and the rating. Also, be aware that is not a fast-moving movie and no one blows anything up.",1475971200,,499,4.319148936170213
1638031,1,B00005O0AJ,"This adaptation is a male interpretation of a female-written interpretation of memory. Duras wrote her story focused on the girl's relationships with female language, and confounded the timeline to expose the unreliability of memory, but Annaud drew on a standard male interpretation of a love story, focused on the sexual relationship. I hated that the movie lost the experiences of a young girl and instead glorified the male eros.",1472860800,3,433,5.2898550724637685

1638067,4,B00005O0AJ,It is no so much a story as a memory of a story.  She remembers thing as she wanted her adolescents to be.  The closer to her family the reader the memories are.  Compelling visuals.  Good stories.  A journey from innocence to experience.,1466380800,,238,4.441860465116279

1638115,4,B00005O0AJ,"A Marguerite Duras book,  directed by Jean Jacques Annaud. My disappointment was that it wasn't in French. That would have nailed it.
Otherwise it's an intriguing character driven story that runs the gambit, truthfully told, of a girl having an affair with a much older man. Jane March and Annaud did a great job of emphasising the girl playing woman. Sometimes she seems so young, then not so much.
A good telling of the book.
It has great atmosphere and feeling, I kept wondering how they'd backed up time.
It's  thought it was definitely worth the view.",1462233600,,556,4.721649484536083
1638116,2,B00005O0AJ,Not what someone recommended.  Not much of a story.  Many garbled lines.  Lots of disturbingly young flesh.  Save your time and money.,1459209600,,134,4.954545454545454

1638118,5,B00005O0AJ,"This was an all around rich experience. The cinematography was at turns lush & fecund in the jungle & teeming city - and then stark & shabby with poverty. As a love story between two people who both know it can never be - it is both sensual and desperate. The writing/story is, for me, very reminiscent of the stories of Anais Nin: full to bursting with the explicit passion of being young & human as well as the quiet tragedy of existence.",1457568000,6,440,4.313253012048193

1638154,3,B00005O0AJ,"Here's something of a test of your taste, if not also of your ethics. The story is based on (and narrated as) a real-life French author's retrospective on her teenage affair, in Vietnam (remember, it was then known as French Indochina) with a Chinese man almost twenty years her senior. It can be viewed as a coming-of-age story, with something of an emphasis on ""coming"", and it rather works in this regard as well as as a sort of nostalgic romance. The test for the viewer lies (literally) in the several scenes of totally nude, athletic love-making; not everyone in your viewing household, including your mate and especially peers of the young woman, will feel comfortable watching this with you. But these scenes, as well as those of the geographic and cultural environment, are quite beautifully filmed. In total, they evoke the author's nostalgia and the ultimate sadness of the Chinese lover, as emotional involvement overcomes lust and the power in the relationship shifts from the older male to the increasingly self-confident (and independent) younger female. Similarly juxtaposed are the financial superiority of the Chinese protagonist and the racial prejudice of his Caucasian girlfriend's hardscrabble family. Tony Leung brings a sensitive depiction to the smitten Chinaman, Jane March is irresistibly convincing, physically, as the object of his obsession, dramatically perhaps somewhat less so. Frederique Meininger makes a strong, if somewhat abbreviated impression as the girl's benighted mother.",1453161600,2,1514,5.3924050632911396
1638155,5,B00005O0AJ,"I first saw this movie when I was 21 and in the middle of my first truly adult relationship. It was a rainy Sunday, the theater was old and musty, and we were the only people in it.

I rented it from Amazon on another rainy Sunday, decades later, because I wanted to use it to set a mood for some writing I was working on.

It's a very honest, if slightly romanticized story, and quite engaging, with excellent performances and brilliant cinematography.",1448236800,2,453,4.445783132530121

1638194,5,B00005O0AJ,"I've watched this movie a dozen times. I would call it a beautifully sad coming of age story. Since it was made before Madison Avenue neutered the movie industry, it could be considered by some as exploitative soft pornography. I think it is poignant, well acted and cinematically superb. Jean Marsh plays the vulnerable teen Heroine. John Lowe the weak willed leach. Both portrayed their characters flawlessly.",1432944000,,411,5.149253731343284

1638196,5,B00005O0AJ,A beautiful film of a young white girl who carries on a affair with a older chinese gentlemen. Might be viewed as a coming of age story. The story is a beautifully filmed languid setting in pre war Vietnam probably Saigon. Very sexy and sensual with a heavy emphasis on the erotic. Good story and characters and is one my favorite films that I have seen. Can't imagine anyone not liking it except for a lack of moralism.,1427932800,3,420,4.397435897435898
1638197,5,B00005O0AJ,"This movie probably isn't for everyone because it borders on what I consider to be soft porn.  I am not into any type of porn, but I like it because it is a good love story, it's educational in terms of the location and time frame and it's semi-autobiographical.  Jane March is enchanting and the male lead is very handsome.  I recommend it, but be advised that the sex scenes are explicit.",1426809600,2,390,4.388888888888889

1638218,5,B00005O0AJ,"One of the all time great movies with many themes worth considering.
