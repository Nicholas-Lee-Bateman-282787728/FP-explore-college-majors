1095711,1,6305950539,"It's my fault for not researching this better, but, highly disappointed.
 Purchased for my two year old grand daughter, thinking I can' t go wrong if Mickey is on the cover,  right?  WRONG.
While watching the dvd, my grand daughter kept asking the same question that I was thinking, "" Where is Mickey?! "". He was only in two small segments.
Donald for the most part was a loud, brash, red faced hot head...(hmm, momentarily side tracked thinking of another ""Donald"" ), his three nephews were mean and disrespectful.
Pete, was gross and very creepy.
The animation has the look and feel of the Depression Era, with Kelsey Grammer narrating.
To be honest, we didn't even bother watching the whole thing, scanned till we could find Mickey and Minnie, but still, there were bits that weren't toddler friendly.
These are not the newer modern day Mickey Mouse Clubhouse characters that your little one may be more familiar with.

If that is what you are hoping for, then this is not for you.",1512000000,,984,4.703488372093023

The one that made me red hot was the second story that literally questions the existence of Santa Claus.  Really Disney?  I had to spend the entire night telling my three year old that ""Santa was there in the end and it all turns out ok..."" she kept asking questions about ""why didn't Goofy believe in Santa?""  Terrible.  Thanks a lot Disney.  Questioning Santa?  Who does that?

1097007,5,6305950539,"I discovered this movie a year ago when my grandson was 14 months and had started to like Mickey Mouse.  This movie captivated him then and still does.  He watches it over and over again, enough that my daughter wanted it on DVD so she could play it for him in the car.  There are three stories -- one with Mickey, Minnie and Pluto, one with Donald Duck, Daisy, and all the other duck characters, and one with Goofy and son.  My grandson isn't old enough yet to really understand the stories, but he thinks they are hilarious anyway, and I don't mind having it on when I'm babysitting.  When he is tired he will sit and watch for long stretches,  Otherwise he likes having it on while he plays and he seems to be aware of when a favorite part is about to come on because he will suddenly appear in front of the TV to watch.",1420848000,,823,4.177215189873418

She enjoyed Donald Duck but I thought it was horrible. She did get upset by the nephews antics (i.e. breaking the piano) and I hated having to explain that their behaviour was hurtful. The goofy one was awful and the Mickey magi story, I think was a little to old for her but she enjoyed the jingle bells.

I used to watch this every Christmas with my family (on VHS of course).  I was excited to find it on DVD and I am happy to say it has held up nicely since viewing it during my younger years.

You get three different animated stories....
One staring Donald and his three nephews where a wish causes it to be Christmas everyday, one with Goofy and his son Max end up with a visit from the real Santa Claus, and one where Mickey and Minnie give their own twist on the gift of the magi.

Each story is entertaining and I found myself laughing a bit, but the best part was reliving some of the Christmas magic from my younger years.  It is the type of movie to share with your family and it will put you in a good mood.

The Goofy Christmas is full of humor, and it tells the story that if you really care for each other and prove that Christmas is full of magic, great things happen.

I really don't know what to say for Mickey and Minnie's Gift of the Magi, but even so, this movie is always great to have out during Christmas time every year no matter how old you are.

1097749,5,6305950539,"Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas and the second film are my favorite Disney Christmas films. This film had 3 stories both of the stories taught the entire characters and the entire world about the true meaning of Christmas. The first story is about Donald's nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie want Christmas for a entire year. Imagine it everyone: Christmas for a entire year, you get the same thing for a year and annoying family members coming to visit. The boys had many hilarious situations and they almost ruined Christmas, but they will learn the true meaning of Christmas. The second story is about Goofy and his son, Max who wants a snowboard for Christmas. Goofy tried to prove Santa does exist because of his grumpy, Christmas-hating next door neighbor who thinks Santa does not exist. Goofy had many schemes to prove it for his son and Santa indeed does exist. Finally, the last story is about irony and love. Mickey and Minnie are broke and poor and they cannot afford a single gift because of unpaid payments, Christmas-hating, selfish, and greedy bosses. They tried to get a honest buck to get a single gift, but they failed miserably. The couple learnt true meaning of irony, and their love will always survive. As a fan of Disney, I recommended you buy this film and the second film during Christmas holidays and watch it with your family",1386547200,,1349,4.74468085106383

This feature includes O. Henry's The Gift, plus two other shorts that are entertaining and beautifully crafted.

He's pretty smart and when he hear's on the goofy bit them saying that it is impossible for santa to travel around the world in one night and that he's a myth he understands that.

I was hoping to save watching it for at least Nov of this year so it was a little more timely, but the kids saw Mickey on the cover and it quickly became their fave. Each story is great- makes them laugh, has a moral, and helps them believe in the spirit of the holidays. For all those who griped about the Goofy part making your kids think there's no Santa...Santa shows up in the end- so you really can't gripe. My only complaint with that part is finding a good reason to give my kids as to why they can't wait up on the roof waiting to see if Santa shows. My only real gripe isn't even with this- it's that Mickey Mouse Clubhouse shows Pete to be a little sneaky, but essentially nice. After seeing this and Steamboat Willie, the kids are a bit confused about Pete- so I had to tell them that Pete started out nasty, but by the time he was on MMCH he learned some lessons and got nicer??!?!?!

1098589,4,6305950539,"This movie is really a series of three shorter stories with Mickey Mouse and his friends.  Combined, they remind us that family and love are the most important parts of Christmas.

The first is the weakest story.  It focuses on Huey, Dewey, and Louie as they get their special wish, every day is Christmas.  At first they enjoy it, but soon they are bored, especially when they realize they are the only ones who know this.  Can they figure out a way out?

The next story focuses on Goofy and his son Max.  After mailing their annual letter to Santa, Max starts to doubt Santa's existence.  Is Santa real?  Frankly, I was surprised at how touching I found this particular story.  And the opening with the race through the mall was the funniest part of the video, too.

Finally, Mickey and Minnie do a good impression of ""The Gift of the Magi"" as Mickey wants to buy a chain for Minnie's watch, while Minnie is trying to get the money to buy Mickey a case for his harmonica.  Yes, I knew where it was going from the title, but I still enjoyed it.

Clocking in at just over an hour, none of these stories are too long.  But they certainly get the message across about what the holiday is really all about.

I'm not sure this is a video that adult fans will turn to year after year, but kids will certainly be entertained by it.",1261353600,,1325,4.329268292682927

The graphics quality is strangely uneven--as if it were done by two different teams of animators--and the storyline lacks the creativity Disney characters usually have. It ""Christmasy"" enough, and that's a good thing, but it's not remotely close to the cartoons of the past...though I guess nothing is.",1261094400,,389,5.190476190476191

Its the 1st year that she recognized the magic of Christmas, Santa, etc. so we bought this video for her to watch this season. I'm just sick that she has seen this video though - its generated questions that we should NEVER have to address with her this early! I agree with some others who said that the 1st story is a little over her head, and that was ok. The story about Mickey and Minnie overall was nice - the message about giving was great, but other parts were a bit confusing & scary for her, because Pete is a ""friend"" on the TV show, but is just horrible to Mickey and others in this story. The most disturbing story though, was the one with Goofy and his son where Pete tells Max that there's no Santa and the story shows ways Santa could be other people (ie: Goofy dresses us as Santa for the neighbors and Max realizes Santa's his dad)! Now, I understand that kids will eventually hear this and parents have to address it when the time comes. But, I would NEVER have imagined to introduce the thought that this could even remotely be true at 3! And to have it introduced by us showing her a Disney movie makes it that much worse! Although at the end Goofy proves that Santa exists, the questions are still there. All in all, this movie is not, in its entirety, appropriate for anyone under the age of 8. The first story is too complex, the second could be devastating and the last is ok, but a child needs to be able to understand the complexity of Pete's character.",1260748800,,1599,4.2805280528052805

As they relive Christmas day over and over again, the fun soon turns monotonous and boring, and along the way, the boys learn the true meaning of Christmas.

In the second story, Goofy and his son Max confront the 'myth' of Santa Claus - Goofy is a true believer and Max turns out to be skeptic after next door neighbor Pete tells him Santa isn't real. It takes a lot of effort and some magic before Max comes around:)

In the last story, Mickey and Minnie play down-on-their luck sweethearts whose purse strings won't stretch to give each other a special present, and so they decide to sacrifice something precious belonging to each of them to please the other - this truly encapsulates the lesson of Christmas - that it is better to give than to receive, and of noble sacrifice.

1098741,2,6305950539,"I watched this with my 4 year old and was amazed at the speed and jumble of action, as well as the downright meanness of some of the characters.

OK, now that I have little ones perhaps I am more sensitive to such points than I used to be. But do we really need Pete swindling a poor family, stealing Mickey's money and an entire Christmas tree lot going up in flames in a Christmas story?

And do we also need Pete to plant the seed of Santa disbelief in the Goofy and Son section?

My son has had no reason to even contemplate that Santa wasn't real - is it too much to expect that a Disney movie would not have that plot device, at least so prominently? Sure, there's a ""Santa really does exist"" ending, but come on - it's difficult enough balancing my son's innocence with the real world.

His main questions during and after watching was ""Why is Pete so mean?"" and ""Why doesn't he believe in Santa Clause?""

The Mickey Minnie Magi story is OK, the Huey, Dewey & Louie groundhog-day-Christmas is too fast paced. During that section my son went into the glazed over zombie look that one sees when watching the modern fare on many kid's tv channels.

Production value of the animation is perfectly fine.

The stories are a little longer than the 2nd one also (it has 3 compared to 5 stories), which does tend to get a little boring for a toddler. But they all have great messages, and are still fun to watch!",1136332800,,657,4.222222222222222

1098826,5,6305950539,I got this video (and I'm going to buy the DVD this year) about 2 years ago and my daughter and I have sat and watched it for the last two holiday seasons.  There are three stories all about the true meaning of Christmas (another reviewer explains them so I won't repeat it here).  In my opinion this is one of the best Christmas videos (animated) that I've seen in a while.  Disney really came through on this one.  Enjoy!,1060905600,,423,4.25

On deals with friends being more important than what one gives.  Another with today's ""gimme a present"" culture and how caring is found to be more important, the other with a similar ""caring about family is more important than presents"" and how wishing Christmas happened every day of the year isn't necessarily a good thing.  The rock band item at the end of the movie was disjoint and shouldn't have been there (a dismal rendition of ""Deck the Halls"" done to the tone of a funeral march.)  Put a erase protect defeat label on this part, erase it is my advise so you don't have to hear it if you don't shut off the movie in time.

1098911,4,6305950539,"I really enjoyed this Disney video and my 3 year old also loves it.  It contains 3 stories, first Donald Duck and Family, then Goofy and last Mickey and Minnie.  The stories discuss how Christmas is more than just receiving presents and how important it is that it is a time of togetherness and helping each other.  I was very puzzled with the disjoint ""music video"" at the end of the movie featuring ""She Daisy"".  It was a rather ghoulish rendition of an otherwise happy-sounding Christmas carol.  It didn't make sense to me and the target audience for the music video would be one different than the targeted viewer (more for younger adults than children.)

1098912,3,6305950539,"I got this title reluctantly, becuase it was part of the Gold Classic Collection, so I figured there had to be some good about it. I was expecting something along the lines of ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"", but this simply is nothing like that.
This DVD is strickly for children, with some mixed bag of jokes thrown in that MAY make adults grin. The DTV movie, is split into three stories: the first is a Donald Duck story, where his three nephews wish that it was Christmas everyday but they soon regret it; the second, which is the weakest, is about Goofy and his son Max, where Max is told that Santa doesn't exist but his father want's to prove to him otherwise; and the third is with Mickey and Minnie both wanting to buy each other gifts but none of them have the money, which leads to them making some sacrifices.  The movie is than rounded out by the entire cast of 'toons singing Christmas carols.
It will definitely entertain kids & it isn't the worse thing in the world for adults to sit through. Plus, DVD enthusiasts will appreciate the attempt of bringing to this release a suitable surround mix (Dolby Digital 5.1).",1005091200,,1127,4.5245098039215685

1098914,5,6305950539,"After reading some of the reviews to this, I had to write my own, and you can judge my credibility by reading all my other reviews and lists. I'm a long time Disney fan of the old and new stuff, especially but not exclusively the animation. I know the characters and histories pretty darn well. This video is great! It's great as a Christmas video, and it's great as a Disney film! The art work is excellent! It's not lame Saturday morning art! It's a bit better than that! Although, keep in mind that the animation on Saturday mornings has improved drastically compared to the 80's. What we used to see on the big screen is basically what we're seeing on Saturday mornings now, but people nowadays who have been spoiled by seeing computer effects and such stuff in the latest Disney animated films probably can't appreciate the more classic style of art we see in films like this. You want to see a poorly done Disney staight to video feature, see Return of Jafar. This film is quite well done! ANd I for one am always glad to have a break from integrated computer animation! So let's clear all those complaints about the artwork up right now! Anyone who says it's badly done technically hasn't watched as much animation as he or she believes or claims! Anyway, as for the film itself, it showcases three stories about Christmas. It's a great format in my opinion because I love getting more than one story, even if they are shorter that way! The first is about Huey, Louie, and Dewey who make a wish that it could be Christmas every day. Now this story is NOT based on the Bill Murray film Groundhog Day, but rather a popular children's book entitled, Christmas Every Day. That says a little something right there about THAT reviewer in my opinion. All you have to do is pay attention to see that in the credits. This is a real treat because among the relatives who come to visit Donald on CHristmas day is none other than Uncle Scrooge McDuck! Remember him from the comics, or more recently from Duck Tales?!!! It's always so nice to see him animated! He's definitely one of my all time favorite characters, though he's not a major player in this, he gets some nice screen time! (for more of him try to catch Scrooge McDuck and Money, Sport Goofy: Soccermania, and of course, Mickey's Christmas Carol and Duck Tales...did I miss anything?) Now, the second story is about Goofy and his new son Max. I say NEW because I seem to recall him having another son years and years ago. Remember that redheaded kid, Jr.? Anyways, In this story Max is starting to lose his belief in Santa Claus, and Goofy does everything he can to prove to Max that Santa is real. Story wise it sorta plays like an episode of Goof Troop, but hey, Goof Troop was a great show! Now, last is Mickey and Minnie's story. This is the classic story the Gift of the Magi, where a poor Mickey and Minnie are struggling to get each other a suitable gift for Christmas. This is a very sweet story and well done with a cameo from Mortimer Mouse! All in all this is one Christmas DVD that is well worth the money. My only complaint about my gold collection DVD is when the credits begin to roll it becomes out of sync and skips. I also noticed that problem with my The Tigger Movie DVD, and it's not the player, because I've checked it out on others. Well, luckily both DVD's have the accompanying music videos so when I want to hear the songs I can always go there.
