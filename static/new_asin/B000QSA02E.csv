8197197,5,B000QSA02E,"I was such a Smurf fan when I was a child.  I wished I lived in a mushroom house too.  When I saw this on DVD, I had to get it.  It was worth it.  Now my kids can enjoy it and they do.  They ask for it a lot.  The style of cartoon is exactly the way we saw it, pure and simple.  I wish they made more cartoons this way these days.",1194220800,2,330,3.3783783783783785

8197199,4,B000QSA02E,"Excellent programming for your children...simple plot, simple good, simple evil, but everything is very good in the stories as nothing is pointless (unlike today's cartoons).

Only trouble is the volume in the episode is turned WAY down, so man the volume control after the episode is over or you'll get a BLAST of sound when  the show goes back to the main menu.",1185926400,5,363,4.746031746031746

8197201,3,B000QSA02E,Everything I remember from being a kid.  We had to buy these for our daughter to watch in the evenings before bed because the cartoons on TV these days are horrible.  She loves them.  The problem with this set is the volume.  IT can be heard but the volume has to be all the way up.,1182211200,11,282,3.982142857142857
