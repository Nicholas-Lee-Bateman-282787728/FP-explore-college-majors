5256742,5,B009416ACI,Can't wait for Part 2 to finish filling the holes that the first movie left open!  Do buy this movie!,1356393600,5,101,4.05
5256743,4,B009416ACI,"Of the many gorgeous and historic photographs shown in ""Out of Nowhere,"" there's one that represents this documentary perfectly in my opinion. It's placed at the end as the credits flash by and shows the first lead singer of REO Speedwagon, Terry Latrell, who lives in the Champaign area, visiting with longtime REO members Bruce Hall, Neal Doughty and singer Kevin Cronin. The guys are all smiling and look genuinely happy to be reunited; hints of past musical animosities and personal hang-ups are nonexistent. Perhaps it's this sustained camaraderie, loyalty and authentic love of music, all elements conveyed in this photo, which have coalesced within many Champaign-Urbana bands for decades to give the music scene in C-U a vibrant, high-quality and special vibe.

REO's story is featured heavily in ""Out of Nowhere,"" and deservedly so. These guys helped put Champaign on the map in many ways, and frankly, I had no idea that the founding and longtime members of this huge band had such sentimental and loyal feelings toward their hometown of Champaign. The cheerfulness and sincerity displayed by Cronin, Doughty and Hall is infectious as they're carted around C-U in a tour bus in 2010, taking in the sites outside the window, sharing memories of and thoughts on the town, keeping things lighthearted but earnest. Cronin, who hails from Chicago, is particularly engaging and fun to watch. Late in the movie, his spirited solo acoustic performance of ""Music Man"" at the fabled Virginia Theater is a treat to behold.

As the stories unfold, head-bobbing rock tunes appropriately accompany the plethora of photos of practically every past and present C-U rock 'n' roll artist or band who's made a difference -- it makes you want to discover all of this music. Many rockers in the photos are long vanished from the scene, but some are still around, flaunting their chops in different Champaign bands. Of course, the seasoned musicians who've made it happen over the years have rich stories to tell, and that's where the narrative fun comes in. Grizzled rock veterans who share their thoughts include George Faber of the Finchley Boys, Cody Sokolski of the of the Delta Kings, Slink Rand of the Slink Rand Group (a band I wouldn't mind hearing more music from) and Don Gerard from Moon Seven Times. The very interesting and well-spoken John Schlitt, former lead singer of Head East and Petra, as well as modern rocker Ryan Groff from Elsinore, offer their cool stories as well. All weigh in with fascinating perspectives from different eras and express tons of prideful memories.

Prior to watching ""Out of Nowhere,"" I thought I had a firm grasp of C-U's storied rock 'n' roll scene; this documentary proved I had much to be educated on. There are simply so many topnotch C-U artists who have rocked the city throughout the years that it's mind boggling. Film creator Bob Zimmerman deserves lots of credit for consolidating loads of material into a few hours that fly by. Undoubtedly, he could have added more stories, more bands, more photos and more music; happily a continuation to this documentary, which will hopefully include more female artists, is already in the works. After watching ""Out of Nowhere,"" you'll come away thinking that Champaign-Urbana is the opposite of nowhere ... it's definitely ""somewhere,"" like any spirited college town deserves to be.",1356134400,7,3367,5.019677996422183
8535478,5,B009416ACI,Boomers rejoice!  I lived at the Red Lion and later Mabel's (so it seems). Best time of my life. I could have watched another 10 hours. Thanks so much for the work in making this.,1479772800,,179,4.114285714285714
8535479,4,B009416ACI,"I live in the region and was a teenager when REO Speedwagon was at the top of their game.  Good movie; thanks for making it!  I do have one question, however:  Was this movie ever aired on PBS, and was it made with that intention in the first place?  I'm asking because the movie has no profanity or discussions of other things that might not be appropriate for all viewers.  It's just about the music.",1454025600,,402,4.306666666666667

8535483,5,B009416ACI,"Brought back a lot of great memories that I thought were lost. Kind of like that old  saying "" if you remember  Woodstock, you weren't there"". A  great film for any  UI student or ""townie"" who was there, or for others to see what they missed! As Siskel and Ebert would have said ""Two Thumbs Up!""",1365724800,,295,4.214285714285714
8535484,5,B009416ACI,"I wish they had had more on the early days of Champaign -Urbana music (early to mid 60s) but it more than met my expectations.  There were a few missed people though, like Duke Tumatoe and the All-Star Frogs.",1364515200,,208,4.333333333333333
8535485,5,B009416ACI,"Thanks to Bob Zimmerman for putting together this wonderful documentary.  I was fortunate enough to be a part of the C-U scene (All-Star Frogs, Lonnie and the Lugnutz) when live music seemed to be the only entertainment option that mattered. Those were heady days, and it is a blast to see all of my old friends on camera. This documentary covers most of the salient events and major figures of the past and present. Thanks again telling a terrific story and for bringing back some really sweet memories.

8535486,5,B009416ACI,"This documentary is clearly the work of someone devoted to his subject. I utterly loved the opening, and the story held me throughout. I knew little about Champaign, and almost nothing about the bands---but this video brought a world to life. In the end I felt like I'd missed out on something huge, by not living in Champaign in those vibrant years! This is what a great documentary can do: take you inside a world and make it lively, make it entrancing. It's not entirely a professional job, but beautifully done, the work of an amateur with a great eye and a great passion.",1360281600,,576,4.548076923076923
8535487,5,B009416ACI,This is a must see documentary for any music fan! Many interesting perspectives and pathways to the past. Independent flavor also makes it a good buy.,1356825600,3,150,4.8076923076923075
