8340514,4,B001T4Y1NS,"Some say that ravens foster lost children, others say violence be chided. I say Death Wish had the right idea. This film reminds me of an 80's sleeper involving savage butchery and poignant moments of wistfulness, with only a societally-inflicted sense of anticipation making it difficult to be impartial in its judgment. I like the indifference of its shots, which afford a sense of realism despite its apparent attempts at grandeur. Someone should put this on YouTube, so we may all pay tribute to its director, writer and actors. B+",1263859200,,535,4.955555555555556
