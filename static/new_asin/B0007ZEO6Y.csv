8054668,5,B0007ZEO6Y,"I am a fan of film star Stana Katic and a follower of her career from its early days before she reached the safe harbor and ""social
acceptance"" of becoming Lieutenant Kate Beckett, NYPD, in the TV series ""Castle.""  There were some kinky roles in some kinky films that came her way.  ""Pit Fighter"" in its cast list announces the ""debut"" of Stana Katic, and it's the debut of a young woman not much on the screen, a youngster gaining experience in the craft of movie acting.  The star of the film is Dominique, a professional ""pit fighter,"" a no-holds, anything-goes popular betting ""sport"" in some unnamed Central American lower class world.  He barely speaks, but we learn he treasures the memory of a beaury (Stana) with whom he shared a life and a love before some break-up.  She reappears as part of a fight-fixing gang, and persuades the fighter to throw a fight, make money for himself and her associates, and perhaps reignite the flame of their love.  But he reneges
and wins the fight, bringing the wrath of local mobsters.  In a long, lively, noisy, blood-bath of a battle involving machine guns and swords, he destroys most of the mobsters, assuring the escape of Stana with all the money (she's going to give it to charity, of course!).",1408579200,,1246,4.636363636363637

8054670,1,B0007ZEO6Y,"Being a big mixed martial arts fan, I was interested in 'Pit Fighter' when I saw it in the store.  The write-up on the back sounded interesting and the blurb on the back stated that ""the fight scenes are the stuff of legend"".  I should've known better.  I knew it would be crap but I gave it a chance anyway.  And do you know what it did?  It sodomized me.

The story goes a little something like this:  some random dude(played by Dominique Vandenberg, fresh off his fabulous role as a corpse in 'Gangs Of New York')who gets shot in the head.  He wakes up, gets medical treatment from some outlaw doctor, and then becomes an underground pit fighter.  Oh yeah, he's got amnesia and a lame tattoo(""Marianne"")on his chest.  That's pretty much it.

'Pit Fighter' is pure excrement.  The script is lame crap, the acting is pathetic crap, the fight scenes are crappity crap, the special effects are laughable crap...you get the idea.  There's nothing well done here at all.  And as for the fight scenes being ""stuff of legend""...ha, my ass they are.  They are the stuff of ""completely forgettable, low budget straight-to-DVD cinema"".  And if you're going to make a film about fighting, you should get actors that look comfortable fighting.  All of the scenes are just awkward, filled with quick cuts so that you never see a punch/kick land, and do that speed up/slow down thing a million times.  Annoying and lame.

Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, but half of the dialogue in the film is made up of ""um""s and ""uh""s while the actors try to remember their monosyllabic lines.  Now, I realize that this is a low budget action flick and I don't expect Oscar-worthy performances but 'Pit Fighter' is just horrible.  Not to mention, the plot is slow and meandering(absolutely nothing happens to move the plot along in the first half-hour or so of the film).  And one of the funniest things in the flick is that it is set in Mexico, but about half the cast have Australian accents.  Ha.  Excrement.

Avoid this like naked pictures of your mother.",1130544000,4,2030,4.603351955307263

8054672,5,B0007ZEO6Y,"I really enjoyed this film on Spike TV, so I searched it out! Frankly the DVD is even better than the TV version, there is certainly a lot more violence in it, the eye popping out in the fight scene.  A very brutal film, not for your grand mother, but I loved it.  I am a true fan of Sam Peckinpah, too, so maybe it's just me.

There was definitly something about this story that worked very well.  Give it a go.  But be warned, it has a rough, edgy feel to it.  Not your polished studio fare!!",1125878400,4,494,3.989795918367347
8054673,2,B0007ZEO6Y,"PIT FIGHTER was done on a very low budget, but director Jesse Johnson manages to work with what he has to make it seem like more.  If you are familiar with his previous movie, THE HONORABLE, well this is light years ahead of it in video/audio quality.  I mean its still not Grade A Studio, but the picture is decent, and the audio is even better.

Jesse recruited the same main character he used in THE HONORABLE, Dominique Vandenberg to play a pit fighter with amnesia down in Mexico.  Vandenberg has no life at all in his acting and when he speaks...well, lets just say his next role should require him to be a mute.

What Jesse and Vandenberg do well is the pit fighting scenes.  I don't think it is humanly possible to take some of the beatings that is delivered, but being a movie...it is rather exciting to watch.  Don't expect wire work...this is just mono to mono.  Due to the popular movie Ong Bak...I think more movies are going in this direction with their fight scenes and finally getting out of the Superhero/Matrix realm.

The fight scenes are really capturing to watch, and there is quite a bit of them, but what really makes this fall below 3 stars is the plot and the last 10 minutes.  The plot kind of drags and I can't imagine anyone in the world wanting to care about the characters.  But that is nothing compared to how Jesse really destroyed this movie with the ending.

SPOILER:::  It is in all out gun blazing battle at the O.K. Coralle and it is more fake than all three Rambo movies.  Vandenberg is literally surrounded by men with automatics from about 20 feet away and they can't hit him; yet Vandenberg is picking them off one by one over 10 minutes...to make matters worse, he loses the gun, picks up a sword, and charges into the crowd and is able take down quite a bit.  UGGHH!

I really wanted to give this 3 stars, because the fight scenes are engaging, but the lack of any kind of plot and the ending ruins the experience.  Def. rent before making the purchase.",1118620800,7,1996,4.409836065573771
