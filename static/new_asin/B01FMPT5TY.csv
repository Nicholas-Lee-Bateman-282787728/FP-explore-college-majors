7750947,4,B01FMPT5TY,It's a bonafide portrait of the basics of the Martin Luther story. Easy to understand and follow.,1470873600,2,97,4.764705882352941
7750948,5,B01FMPT5TY,"Fantastic Series we own every one.  Every single episode is five stars except for the Augustine story!!!  I recommend them all except for that one.

I was so happy that they chose Martin Luther as it makes for an excellent story and helps teach the kids about one of the most important parts of history.  Anyone interested should know this story and will enjoy this telling of it.  If not you need to hear this story now.  Either way this is a definte buy for parents to help kids appreciate their faith more.

Now I can't wait for Adoniram Judson Story the next to be released after this one.",1497052800,3,593,4.385321100917431

8761120,4,B01FMPT5TY,We should this to our Kindergarten through 6th grades in celebration of the 500th anniversary of Martin nailing the 95 thesis to the chapel door.  It is a great way to bring to light some otherwise boring but important historical truths and more importantly the presentation of the gospel.  I'm not giving it 5 stars because I wish they did not use the german accent.  I feel that made it more difficult for some of our younger students to follow along with what was happening.,1509580800,,477,4.588235294117647
8761121,5,B01FMPT5TY,"Well done, inspiring work.  We watched it to learn more about the anniversary of Martin Luther posting his 95 theses.  Though free with prime, I would purchase this.",1509408000,,165,4.857142857142857
8761122,5,B01FMPT5TY,"We showed this to our Sunday School children on Reformation Sunday. We also invited their parents and any other adults to join us. Every single person was completely engaged in the story, from age 7 to seniors. The storytelling is excellent, the history is accurate, and Luther's motivations and theology are correctly presented. Several major players in the Luther story are depicted as the story develops. By no means is this story ""dumbed down"" for children, yet the writers do a marvelous job of explaining what is going on in a very natural way through dialogue and action. At no point did the story lag. In our room, adults spontaneously applauded at several points in the film. Highly recommended! I'd like to add that the price is almost unbelievable since it includes a high-quality reproducible leader guide and student guide, as well as a bonus 90-minute documentary for adults in addition to the 30-minute animated main feature.",1509235200,2,940,4.993630573248407
8761123,5,B01FMPT5TY,"I love this DVD!  It includes a 30 minute animated story of Luther's life which is quite good, a 90 minute documentary which shows clips from the Luther movie, and, on top of all that, a pdf file of discussion questions and activities.  I showed this to my sixth grade class. Great deal for 10 bucks!  Oh, and I got it VERY quickly!",1508803200,,332,4.238095238095238
