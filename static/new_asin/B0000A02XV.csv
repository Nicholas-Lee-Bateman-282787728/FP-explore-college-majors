I have to tell you we were totally surprised, what a refreshing take on Latino movies, this is like a Latino Mel Brooks film, it was great to see a hispanic director making a light hearted movie about the Hood. I laughed out loud several times.  I love the Super charcater, classic, I really recommend this film.",1064102400,4,442,4.525

If you were alive and kickin' in the 90's You'll enjoy it - if you know the original Charlie's were. They're still on the Retro TV and MeTV channels here in Mass though, so You can still find out. Enjoy!!",1370044800,,325,3.8656716417910446

I mean anyone with a brain can tell it's low budget. so what!, bottom line is I burst out laughing a bunch of times. and that's more than I can say for cody banks 2, lol. for real, the audio is bad and some of it is ridiculous, and of course there's no plot, it's a spoof of a movie, with no plot, lol  but It is really funny, specially the midget.",1081036800,,372,3.831168831168831
8292283,5,B0000A02XV,"I loved this movie! After getting it on a whim in the fall, I've watched it so many times with my friends at school because it's hilarious. The best thing about Carlito's Angels is that it doesn't take itself too seriously and makes fun of itself all the time. It's awesome--I definitely recommend it.",1077926400,2,301,4.592592592592593
8292284,5,B0000A02XV,"This is like a totally great movie, It was so funny, and it was great to watch these latina girls in this movie, because if you watch the behind the scenes, you can see that these are all real people from the BARRIO, making this movie with no money, I think it's great!!! Plus the midget in the movie is Glen from the Show ""The littlest groom"" on FOX, the little bachelor, He was so funny in this movie, and adorable.
