8115052,5,B000EWBOAE,"This features some of the earliest Chaplin short films and is a must for any Chaplin fan. You will be surprised at some of the films, Charlie is  dressed differently and even his mustache is bigger. My 3 year old loves Charlie too and refers to any black and white movie on TV as a 'Chaaleechaa'!",1216684800,,296,4.285714285714286
8115053,4,B000EWBOAE,"This collection contains all of Chaplin's shorts, only it's missing five Essanays, and The Pilgrim. If you'd like to see Charlie's early work, this is a must-have. You won't find much better picture quality anywhere else. There's only one problem that I can identify, there is a watermark playing through all of the shorts. For those who are unaware of what a watermark is, it's like a telivison station logo. Most of the time, you can hardly see it, but when the screen is dark, it's quite visible.  I wouldn't mind the watermark if they only had spelled his name right. It reads ""THE CHARLIE CHAPLEN COLLECTION"". . . aside from this flaw, great set. And, even if I knew about the watermark, I'd purchase this anyway with no hesitation.",1196553600,14,737,4.6692307692307695
8115054,3,B000EWBOAE,"I received this DVD set yesterday, and here is my review:

All the movies have watermark on them ""The CHARLIE CHAPLEN (not mystype!!!) Collection"", placed on right-down side of screen. Watermark is sized like big TV station logo, and when scene is bright you could just barely see it, but when the scene is dark, it shows quite good. In my opinion this is unsatisfied, because I want ""clear screen"" view, without any watermarks.

I bought this Collection because I' like to find his Keystone movies in better conditions then I have them already. Keystone's here presented are in my opinion overaly in better condition from the other available compilations, but unfortenately, watermarked.

Essanay studio collection is not completed, there are missing a 5 titles, Mutual studio is complete, and the First National movies are here, but without ""the Kid"" and ""the Pilgrim"". Quality of this film is so-so, not  good like Image Entertaiment or MK2 editions.

The final line: Will I buy this if I knew about watermark? Probably not, because quality of most movies I'm interested in (Keystone's) are maybe little better or the same like I have already, and all other films are available in better, restored editions",1176681600,28,1209,4.9950248756218905

1.  Charles Chaplin (aka: Charles Spencer Chaplin)

Birth Date:  4/16/1889 - Walworth, London, England, UK

Special footnote, Chaplin's character of the little tramp with toothbrush mustache, undersized bowler hat and bamboo cane

who struggled to survive while keeping his dignity in a world with great social injustice...invented his tramp costume with the

 help of 'Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle' 's pants. Arbuckle's father-in-law's derby, Chester Conklin's cutaway, Ford Sterling's

size-14 shoes, and some crepe paper belonging to Mack Swain (which became the tramp's mustache). The only item that

actually belonged to Chaplin was the whangee cane.

Chaplin and Buster Keaton had an interesting relationship...considered rivals, Chaplin hired Keaton for a part in ""Limelight"" (1952)...Keaton, who was flat broke at the time, went into a career decline after having been signed by MGM in 1928...Chaplin, at this point, felt sorry for Keaton due to his hard luck...in his autobiography Keaton called Chaplin ""the greatest silent comedian of all time.""

Great job by Passport Video for releasing ""The Little Tramp: The Charlie Chaplin Collection"" (1914-1922), the digital transfere with a somewhat clean and clear print...looking forward to more high quality releases from the vintage era of the '20s, '30s & '40s...order your copy now from Amazon or Passport Video where there are plenty of copies available on DVD, stay tuned once again for top notch performances mixed with laughter...they're funny, they're sad, but most of all they're passionate...Chaplin has often been criticized for putting too much sentimentality into his films...no one did it as successfully as Chaplin...this set is invaluable for Chaplin fans...Charlie was a genius in filmmaking and his film shorts finally have the release that they deserve.
