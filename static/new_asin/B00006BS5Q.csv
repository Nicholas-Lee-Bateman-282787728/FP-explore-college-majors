7966910,5,B00006BS5Q,"Everyone i know thinks sailor moon is Boring and not very good. Other good animes are Super Gals, Love Hina, Cardcaptors,  and a few others im in to. But Sailor Moon is defentiley the best anime around! Usagi Tsukino is the coolest! I have all 200episodes of Sailor Moon and all 3movies on DVD.",1066435200,,294,4.444444444444445
7966911,5,B00006BS5Q,"Yet another to add to my rather large anime collection. I thought this DVD of Sailor Moon had a little more value than the others that I have seen. Japanese version all the way!!!!!!! For any anime fan the Japanese version is the way to go. Anyway back to the review.
The number of stars in my reveiw (5), is attributed to the Japanese version. Uhhh, I am just going to point out some of the bad points, and just about all of them are related to the English version
1: In the English version, Usgai sounds like she is an old woman with a head cold. Ami sounds like she is crying all the time. Makoto sounds like she has a permanet frog stuck in her throat. Helious sounds like an old man, if he sounds so old why would Chibiusa fall in- (opps almost gave it away).
2: The ONLY complaint in the sub; why are they taking out the words 'damn', and instead on the sub at the bottom of the screen they are putting sheesh, or geeze??? After a while it kind of gets annoying. Anyone who know some Japanese, knows that the charcters arn't saying sheesh or geeze, but damn
3: English version again: The Amazon Quartet is supposed to be a group of little girls, but they sound like teenagers!!!! That kind of annoyed me a little in the English version
4: Some may not agree with me on this but, Fish-eye is a man!! Fish-eys is NOT a woman, he is homosexual. That kind of annoys me that the dubbers made the he, a she.
5: The final thing I have against the English version: WHY THE HECK DOSE ZIRCONIA SOUND LIKE AN OLD MAN!?!?!?!?!? In the subb there is nothing that Zirconia dose the suggest that she is a homosexual, so why the heck did they make the she, into a he????
Well that is my reveiw. Remeber I gave it 5 shiny stars for the Japanese version NOT the English verison. My advice, avoid the dubb",1035244800,3,1792,4.197101449275363
7966912,5,B00006BS5Q,"My first question is...why does Pioneer refuse to put curse words as subtitles..most of the time. As you may already know they put ""Sheesh, or Geez"" and most of the time you can tell they're saying Damn NOT sheesh or geez. ~_~ Uhhg. I suppose adults aren't mature enough to handle these words. *_* Yet little kids can handle Zirconia calling the Quartet ""bimbos"" umm..ok? I almost peed my pants from laughing so hard when I heard Elios' or Helios' voice *ENGLISH voice* it's HILARIOUS! He sounds like an old man!! AHAHAHHAHAHAHHAAHAHAH ok..I'm..OKAY. Of course, the Japanese version is AS always much better. The title screen is nice, not many extras though. One thing I do not like...the Quartet's phrase is so DUMB ""don't dream that you're all grown up, big dreams are best just for kids"" I don't know what it is about it it's way too annoying. THE JAPANESE VERSION ALL THE WAY!! ^_^ :-D",1034380800,,889,4.6687898089171975
7966913,5,B00006BS5Q,"This disc does more to advance the story of the SuperS series than the last two combined.  The Amazon Trio arc ends, the Amazoness Quartet arc begins, and Nehelenia finally puts in a major appearance.  This disc also includes the infamous ""nude Ami"" episode (Barbie doll nudity only, but clothesless nonetheless) and some serious Fish Eye air time, so consider yourself warned.  Both of these add significantly to the overall story, though, so as long as you're not offended by the concepts you'll be treated to one of the best discs in the series.",1031788800,3,548,4.808510638297872
7966914,5,B00006BS5Q,"This dvd is one of the best. ... Basicly, Fish Eye fell in love with Darien, and is flirting with him all the time; even when Serena is right in front of him! Finally Darien makes it clear to Fish Eye that he does, and can not love her, because she doesn't have wonderful dreams like Serena. Earlier, the Amazoness Quartet had made their appearence, and threatened to break the ball the keep Hawks Eye, Fish Eye and Tigers Eye in their human form, They are really animals. ... Fish eye stays behind because she knows she can't have beautiful dreams so she figures why go back? ... There is alot more but I can't give it all away. ...",1031529600,3,633,4.283333333333333
