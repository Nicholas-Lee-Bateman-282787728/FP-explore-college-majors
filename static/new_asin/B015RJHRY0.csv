The physical disc is off balance and makes my DVD drive sound like a coffee grinder.  Looking at the disc it's hard to say where the issue is as the image on the non-playing side covers the entire disc.  However looking at the disc edge, it is obvious the edges of the two clear platters sandwiching the media do not match and were not properly smoothed to ensure disc balance.

As far as the digital media on the disc, it is low quality for this day and age.  While the video itself seems fine, the print font of the menu and English subtitles are atrocious and of a quality I'd expect from an average bootleg copy.

[EDIT]

After some research it seems the publisher for the disc I received (Hong Feng Entertainment) is a questionably legitimate publisher of  bootleg quality discs.",1481068800,6,840,4.553333333333334
