As a matter of fact, the dvd is marketed as a concert BUT actually it is a promo video for a lame Vermont folk festival.  There might be 100 people in the audience and the maker of the video spent more time walking around and filming dancing children, interviewing forgetful hippies, and generally ignoring the performers.  You might get the occasional live footage, but thats pretty much it.

So if you are looking for a live concert of folksy type music...this isn't it.",1271548800,,626,4.3247863247863245
8299283,5,B000VZC50C,"Well, I was at this show and let me tell you it truly was great.  It was small, family oriented, safe for kids, with all the emphasis on the music and less on drugs and partying, although there were plenty of both to be had if you wished.  I have not yet seen this DVD but I am ordering it today as I just found out it existed.  I am always trying to talk my friends into riding up with me for this show as I now live in Jersey.  Now I will have a video to go along with all my beautiful memories.  Oh yeah, the Gogol Bordello performance was off the hook.",1235347200,,556,3.8421052631578947
8299284,5,B000VZC50C,"I wish I lived in Vermont.  It's so hard to find good music where I live.  The Devil Makes Three totally rock in this movie.  I've never seen them live in concert, but this is the best compromise you could find.  They are awesome...  and everyone else is too for that matter.  Gogol Bordello of course, no question.  There is so much great footage this documentary offers.  Day and night, all the performances are rad.  I highly recommend this to anyone who likes good, interesting music and smaller less mainstream music festivals.  NEKMF totally rocks!",1204070400,,554,4.7368421052631575
8299285,5,B000VZC50C,"I am a huge fan of concert movies.  I had never attended this Vermont festival before, but I picked up a copy after the film came highly recommended by a friend.  This movie is packed with awesome bands, and each one is quite different.  Gogol Bordello gives a searing performance from their Gypsy punk repertoire while crowd surfers glide across the audience in the background.  The female singer Abby Jenne totally blew me away with her performance of ""Woman Be Wise""; she literally gave me chills.  The movie is shot in the style of independent documentary, showing a real up-close account of what an experience at the music festival is all about.  Almost as fascinating as the first-rate concert footage in this movie, are the behind the scenes activities and interviews that are featured throughout the film, especially the fire twirling segment.  More than just a generic gathering, there is evident a spirit of friendliness, acceptance, and joy at the Vermont festival, that holds a rare beauty.  The camerawork really is topnotch, the sound is impressively clear, and the editing made watching footage from all three years flawless.  I would highly recommend this for any music lovers to check out.",1191196800,,1206,4.99
