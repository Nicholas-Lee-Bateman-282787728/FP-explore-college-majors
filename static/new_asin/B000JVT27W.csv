8153406,5,B000JVT27W,"I really did love this series but to bad they never finished the anime in japan you will just have to read the manga that's coming out. The english is ok but if you got this far you was impress by the battles and mystery in this series. I watched this in and Japanese with english subtitles. I like the japanese better. If you are a Yu Yu hakusho fan you will love this and hate it cause this has no ending just the touranment ends. Then if you want to find out what happens you have to read the manga. This series was created by the sme writer of yu yu hakusho. I love the anime really but I wished they did complete the series. But it's still nice to watch great battles just as you did on yu yu hakusho. I have the dvds and the manga (while all the manga that is out so far)I think if they ever did finish this series it would be great just as Yu Yu Hakusho is or even better really. But YYH is still number 1 then Bleach then kenshin, then alot more action anime. I'm a chick dude and I love it all. I'm not a girl who just wants a happy ending or a love story, I want the action too. So check this out but you just might want to get the manga for the truth and back up.",1208476800,2,1174,3.855371900826446
