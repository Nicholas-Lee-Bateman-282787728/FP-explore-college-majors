8668308,5,6819903030,"I honestly bought the movie before ever seeing it because I love the manga series it is based on. I am so glad I did. This is a fun, solid adaptation of the hit manga, and I'm surprised it hasn't received more attention. Of course, many of the plot points in the manga are either touched upon only briefly or omitted altogether in order to condense the story into the time frame of the movie, but overall, it is a very faithful adaptation. Although I do miss the more in-depth character development of the manga, the acting in the film is great; can't complain. It's also uncanny how much Oizumi Yo looks like the main character (Suzuki Hideo) in the manga.

For those who have never read the manga, or who've never even heard of it, that's okay, too. The movie stands alone very well, which is a relief. Moreover, it's *fun*, which is something I never thought I'd say about a zombie movie. There's a dark humor here that blends in very well with the overall tragedy, so despite the apocalyptic gloom of it all, I still found myself laughing during certain parts. That's not to say this movie isn't creepy - believe me, it is. Especially during the ""turning"" scenes and the initial outbreak. There's not too much gore, either, but there *are* quite a few awesome action scenes involving the ZQN (what zombies are called in this movie).

I've already watched this film several times since I bought it, and I have yet to get tired of it. For fans of the manga, this movie is a bit more action-driven than the comic, and the characters less developed, but it is a fun ride. Watch this. You won't regret it.",1493078400,5,1604,4.4709897610921505
