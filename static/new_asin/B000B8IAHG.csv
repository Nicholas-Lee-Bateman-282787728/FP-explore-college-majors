There are way better videos out there. Dont waste it on this one!",1486684800,,220,4.261904761904762
8083416,5,B000B8IAHG,I recommend this DVD even if your son is not on the spectrum.  I used it for language delay and is wonderful.  My son loves it and it helped him immensely in communicating better. I would even consider these products for pre-K as they are wonderful.,1323648000,,249,4.391304347826087
8083417,4,B000B8IAHG,"I ordered this from Amazon for a great price.  I had read so many good reviews about it so I was excited to order it for my son.  The music is really catchy and I really like the girl in the video.  She has a really nice singing voice, and a nice calming voice when she speaks.  The little character is also really cute.  I was a little disappointed that the video is so short, but so far my son seems to like it.",1318809600,,413,3.869047619047619

8083420,5,B000B8IAHG,"We love this dvd, & Miss Elizabeth!!  The music is catchy, the kids catch on, and it is a really fun dvd for all kids.  What I really love is how they handle transitions (in beginning of show, Elizabeth shows a stuffed animal & says that when they see it again, the show is over.  She teaches things like sitting (when asked/told), stopping when prompted, in a very fun manner.  It really gets kids moving too.  Can't say enough good things--also it's 30 minutes long, perfect timing.  Lots of ways parents/therapists/teachers could get involved w/ the show, and make it a very interactive moment.  We also own the emotions dvd, and it is helping our child identify facial expressions, again, in a very fun way.",1187740800,4,711,4.64
8083421,5,B000B8IAHG,"I love this DVD!  So much fun for kids on the spectrum or any child.  Also, has different learning skills.  Highly recommend!",1168992000,3,125,4.590909090909091
8083422,5,B000B8IAHG,"Spectrum Connections, Connecting Body Movement is absolutely my boys' favorite DVD to date!  Elizabeth Balzano, a Music Therapist, sings fun, light hearted songs that children on the spectrum of Autism will enjoy, and inspire.  My boys sing the songs, even when the tape is not playing!  The other in the series, entitles connection emotions, is also very good, very similar.  The bonus material is helpful and encouraging for Mom and Dad, too!!  I would say, if you have a little Autie at home, these are definately the DVD's for you!!",1152316800,6,536,4.911111111111111
8083423,5,B000B8IAHG,"Popped in DVD tonight and our daughter LOVED this DVD.  She is a big fan of Baby Bumblebee and Laurie Berkner from Noggin (Jack's Music Show) and this is like those two combined especially for autism spectrum kids.  She followed along with the Ready, set, sit and did all the motions.  She even answered Balloo when he said, ""What's your name?""  She really responded to this more than any other DVD she's seen ever.  The singing is nice and doesn't drive you crazy like some other ones.

She also loved the ""Emotions"" DVD as well.  She made more facial expressions in that 20 minutes than she has in her life (angry, sad, happy, silly).  Great, great DVD's- can't say enough about them.  Hope there are MANY more coming.",1140566400,10,720,4.5625
