Tony Danza does an excellent job in my opinion, and Patty Duke always gives a top notch performance.  I like Craig T. Nelson, but the story didn't do as much for me as the others.  I would never complain about 3 of 4 films in a collection being excellent (and the 4th still worth the watch).  All true stories gives it a plus.",1479168000,,416,4.15

8511921,4,B0077PHJ82,"Anytime I can get 4 movies for the price of 1 is a good day. If you read the product description, you will see what I mean about the interesting variety of challenges in these movies. Not happy-go-lucky type stories but good movies when you want a story to think about and be impressed by the determination of the human soul",1377734400,2,324,4.327868852459017
8511922,3,B0077PHJ82,I like Lifetime movies as a rule. However I thought the Challenger  was a bit too detailed.  I was expecting it to be more family oriented.  Got bored with so much about the freezing temps and the arguing over it's effect on the lunch. We all know how it played out. A great loss.,1372723200,2,280,4.148148148148148
