6266718,5,B00IJXWMC4,"I've heard it's the Hindi version of Pay it Forward, which I've never seen so I can't say exactly how similar or dissimilar they are to one another. I can only tell you that I enjoyed it very much. It was a good story with a good message. It really touched on a number of sad instances in life when people who don't care to help others when they can or by their selfish actions can cause great injury or even death to others, but then it showed how you can make a small but important difference to some who will then go and do like wise - with encouragement to do so in the movie. I miss messages and themes like that in movies and TV shows. It was nice to see it in this one once again. My favorite parts involved Salman's biting fighting action style and rom-com with Kabir, Rinky, and Salman - too cute! =D If you are a fan of Salman Khan, I recommend it but then you've probably have already seen it if you are his fan. If you like movies with heart, happy endings, humor, love, music, and action then I would also recommend this movie to you too! I can only say more that I'm glad I bought it for my Hindi movie collection and repeat viewing pleasure!",1401926400,2,1156,4.119469026548672
6266719,3,B00IJXWMC4,"Jai Ho has a very good social message, reminiscent of Pay it Forward but in a different context pertaining to the social ills of a corrupt political system  in India. Perhaps this movie was made to deliberately coincide with the Indian Election 2014, making  jibes at corrupt officials rampant in India! Salman Khan is the hero here as Jai, an ex-army soldier who was galvanised into spreading the message of helping  others after an incident with a physically handicapped college student. As the story unfolds, Jai would be seen taking out the goons single-handedly  ( seriously?)and along with some side distraction of a love interest in the shape of newcomer Daisy Shah as Pinky, there wasn't much to rave on about. I wish they could have made her role more meaningful  than just an after-thought accessory in the story!  Im a great Salman Khan fan, but I cant help noticing  that he needs to stay away from making movies with brother Sohail Khan who makes more flops than hits( except  WANTED). While Jai Ho isn't an outright flop in my view, it could have been better with less mindless wham/bam/silly-ass  fights making it to look like having to fill in all the holes and gaps in the story.  And since when human roars are deemed a deadly weapon in fighting? Anyway, youll need to be a bonafide signed- up member of Salman Khan fanclub to appreciate this movie, totally disregarding all the flaws and holes!",1398988800,,1413,4.7306122448979595
6266720,4,B00IJXWMC4,"Good movie full of action scenes and dance scenes. Somewhat slow in places but otherwise I liked it,If you like Salman Khan get this.",1398902400,,133,4.583333333333333
8642707,3,B00IJXWMC4,"When the telugu movie was not a hit, I do not know why the movie was remade",1521676800,,75,3.4705882352941178
8642708,3,B00IJXWMC4,"First let me say I'm a  big Salman Khan fan and he is very good in this movie.

This is the kind of movie that drives me crazy about Bollywood. It starts with a couple of good ideas - a man fighting injustice in his community. The injustice seems overwhelming and impossible to overcome. In this case he is fighting a corrupt government. There is also a pretty good plot idea to pass good works forward.

In an American movie there may be some violence, but the bad guys would be overcome when a large enough group of good guys overcomes them.

In this movie the good guy acts alone and kills a bunch of bad guys (in impossible fights) and somehow is the hero at the end. The part I disliked the most (spoiler alert) is when the corrupt politician gets beat up by the mob at the end. What kind of message is that?

I liked the dancing, and the songs were good, Daisy Shah is very attractive and a good actress, but I think they should have taken the two basic elements - fighting government corruption and the pay it forward idea and they should have made a script with a much more consistent and uplifting message.",1515542400,,1115,4.29047619047619
8642709,4,B00IJXWMC4,"Jai (Salman Khan) is an ordinary man with a desire to help others.  He formulates a plan in which, instead of saying ""thank you"" for a kind act, the recipient will vow to help three others, telling them to do the same.  In helping others, Jai crosses the local political family, starting a feud.

This is a serious and violent drama with a most positive message, encouraging the doing of good, and celebrating the power of the common man.  It is an engrossing film, with an exceptionally good supporting cast.  Khan wears the same serious face throughout most of the movie, and does little acting other than action, but that doesn't lesson the film.  The music is good, the choreography nice, and the costumes often beautiful.  Overall, this is an intense, yet feel-good film, in the best Bollywood style.",1505174400,,805,4.748201438848921

8642714,5,B00IJXWMC4,"Great Action all the way through. Salman is almost superman in this one. Much like a  Steven Segal movie, great fun to watch him take down great numbers of bad guys all by his handsome self (without getting dirty or disheveled)! I am a big Salman fan he is handsome and his voice is so sultry. Great in love movies, dancing and action films. He is a great dancer - very macho style! Ok - so I just love this guy...... fun movie if you like action flicks. GI Joe would be jealous!",1413244800,,479,4.150537634408602
8642715,1,B00IJXWMC4,"I am an ardent Salman Khan fan and would happily watch him selling diapers.  But this film is a total waste of time.  This film is boring, tedious and, at times, completely incomprehensible.  I blame his brother for this; his direction is aimless at best and completely incompetent at worst.  Even Mr. Khan's incredible charisma and screen presence could not wrest Jai Ho from the morass of bad writing and childish direction.  I hate to say this, because I know for Salman it's all about family.  But it doesn't work at all here.

Save yourself some time -- watch any of his other blockbusters or even some of his under-appreciated gems like Jaan-E-Mann, Garv, or Dil Ne Jise Aphna Kahaa (forgive any misspellings).  Don't bother with this one.",1408665600,,745,4.765625
