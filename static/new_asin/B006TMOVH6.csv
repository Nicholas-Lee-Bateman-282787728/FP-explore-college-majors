8504042,2,B006TMOVH6,This DVD will teach you very little about bow hunting blacktail. In fact you could replace blacktail with just about any other big game animal and it would be the same. Cameron shares very little of the content that is in his book and the video seems more like a product placement for his book than anything else. He even has a copy of his book in the tree stand in one scene. I hoped this video would be a recap of tactics that Cameron describes in his book but instead it is just videos of him arrowing deer. He gives very little detail about the hunt itself and just shows the kill. There is a brief scene about rattling which is minimal. It demonstrates part of the technique but does not describe when he does it or how often. There is also some instruction about quartering a deer in the field but the shot is so far away you can't see what he is doing. In the end it is just a video of Cameron showing off. Read Blacktail Trophy Tactics by Boyd Iverson if you care to actually learn something. It's a much better use of your time.,1448150400,,1037,4.19
