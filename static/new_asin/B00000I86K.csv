1219098,5,B00000I86K,Hands down one of the best performed english dubs ive ever heard in my life right up there with Outlaw Star & Cowboy bebop or Vampire Hunter D bloodlust in terms of voice acting and sound. Every character feels and sounds as they should from the brothers bogard to the ever badass and hyper active Joe higashi. This anime for me is an all time classic god tier fighting sick layouts and tight key frames keep it godlike to this day and in my opinion defines what the fighting game genre needs in anime adaptations the overall animation quality is through the roof on this one only dropping on a few small scenes to save the budget for those Huge!! serious moments like Terry vs Mars etc... cant get enough FF ever.,1390867200,,714,4.416666666666667
1219099,5,B00000I86K,"I have a soft spot for this little movie.  I remember watching it on the sci-fi channel years ago and how they had to fuzz out every outfit Mai wore.  When I found it on Amazon, I had to have it in my collection.  When I watched it again I couldn't stop smiling.  There's something about this anime that never gets old.

There's nothing too special about the plot.  The good guys have to stop the bad guy, gather some ancient artifacts, that sort of thing.  But the characters are lovable.  It's fun seeing them interact with one another.  The action is top notch, even after all of these years.  There's something about Terry shouting BURN KNUCKLE that makes me so happy.  The animation holds up pretty well, which surprised me since this anime aired back in the 90s.  But it's still a good time, and perfect for Fatal Fury fans, or fans of that 90s nostalgia in the anime world.",1388448000,,880,4.39751552795031
1219100,5,B00000I86K,"Okay everyone, I hope that by the time you buy & watch Fatal Fury the Motion Picture, you have already seen Fatal Fury OVAs 1 & 2. Fatal Fury the Motion Picture takes place some time after OVA 2 Fatal Fury the New Battle, but it isn't specific on the actual time that has taken place. If you note that injuries sustained by Joe Higashi in his battle with Krauser are very severe (24 boken bones & an injured eye) then at least several months have passed for his injuries to heal and his training to get him back up to his usual power & more which he shows in this movie. Also Terry has mastered a new technique that he discovered in Fatal Fury the New Battle, Mai has grown up in more ways than one*, Andy has awesome new powers & techniques as well, a new pretty little heroine named Sulia Gaudeamus has been looking everywhere for the ""man who defeated Wolfgang Krauser"" Terry Bogard, and even Kim Kaphwan has been training hard to have a rematch with our star fighter of the show. We also can't forget the antagonists of the series either like a certain someone from the past who has trained even harder than before (Training hard in the moutains inside of a cave that was sealed that isn't opened until big bro breaks it open) in the woods blowing up trees & bamboo with incredible new powers!

Fatal Fury the Motion Picture is the BEST!!!

This is anime at its peak. Again this is one of those old school anime that shows up in waves at the top like some others of the old school era like Cowboy Beebop, Outlaw Star, Ghost in the Shell, Ninja Scroll, Akira, and so on. It continues the subjects of revenge, soul searching, love, and legendary martial arts action!

New protagonists make a beautiful & powerful entrance by the begining of the movie so get ready to wipe the drool off your face and try to lower your heart rate back down because things take off quick & our heroes are lagging behind.
I don't want to ruin anymore of the movie so get ready to see the new villians pursue the collection of the legendary Armor of Mars & hope that Terry and the others can stop them in time!
Wonderful music, amazing character designs by Masami Obari that make you wish you were Fatal Fury characters instead of real life, & fabulous martial arts action make Fatal Fury the Motion Picture the anime event of a life time.

Video & Audio quality are great, you get some extras in the dvd, and old VIZ information from back in the day.
The only complaints here are the same as in my Fatal Fury Double Impact dvd review. Lower quality dvd cover. Other than that the dvd is super. Get Fatal Fury the Motion Picture now and complete the series.",1376870400,,2638,4.355691056910569

1219108,5,B00000I86K,"""Are you okay?!""

This review is going to be a little biased because I first saw this movie during my junior high days in the mid 1990s.  At the time, fighting games were the rage from Street Fighter to Mortal Kombat.  Enter the world of Fatal Fury.  Fatal Fury one was actually released before Street Fighter II, and often gets overshadowed by the Ken and Ryu franchise.  In terms if animated movie production though; Terry and his crew of Andy, Mai, and Joe would defeat Street Fighter Incorporated in a KOF style match-up 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days during the year.

This movie was first released in 1994 and followed in the footsteps of the two Fatal Fury OVA's ""Mark of the Wolf"" and ""New Battle.""  The story chronicles the journey of power hungry entreprenour (who is acting as a pawn) and his quest to obtain the missing armor pieces of an ancient god of war.  Opposing this monarch is his twin sister, who seeks the help of the legendary Terry Bogard.  What unfolds is a fun, romantic, action, feel good story about the power of love, sacrifice, and believing in one's own ability no matter how tough the odds are.

One of the strong points of the movie is the characterization of Terry, Joe, Mai, and Andy.  All four of the main heroes play very well off each other and the character dynamics and dialogue is fantastic.  As in all of the Fatal Fury animes, there is always a side story about Andy in relation to his older brother Terry.  This one revolves around Andy's relationship with Mai, creating one of the most memorable romance relationships in any video game genre.  But once again the greatest hero in any fighting game series, Terry Bogard, takes the center stage and proves why he is simply the man.  If you were to introduce anyone to the character of Terry Bogard, you would have a hard time finding someone who dislikes the Lone Wolf.  His heart, determination, altruism, and heroics once again serve as the backbone to this franchise.

Despite harsh reviews about the animation in the past, I have to say that the still pictures and the quality of the story driving scenes require a specified taste.  The action scene animations are a bit stiff and awkward though.  The story is motivating and the soundtrack is tear shedding.  Fatal Fury the motion picture, buy it, watch it, and love it.  1990s video game anime does not get any better.",1225411200,3,2380,4.566037735849057
1219109,5,B00000I86K,"This was one of the first anime I ever saw, following the first two installments and Bio Booster Armor Guyver. It was, and still is, one of the most awesome, outrageous, far out action movies ever. The music is killer and epic, the attitude is daring and optomistic, the action is special move for special move eye boggling, and the story is classically ludicrous. It's the kind of anime that was so off the wall that it begged recognition over seas. Masami Obari is sadly one of the forgotten masters of early anime. He's got a real distinctive style and attitude to his work that stands out of the big-eye-small-mouth crowd.

Movies like Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children have more in common with this, than say, Tenjo Tenge or Naruto. Though, it's probably more comprehensible than the aforementioned Advent Children. Every bit as crazy with the action though. In all honest, the narrative here has a great sense of showmanship and dramatic storytelling. When Terry gets pissed, it's righteous anger that you don't see heroes get pumped with anymore. He fights like a balls-to-the-wall, selfless, heart-of-steel hero. We don't have genuine heroes like Terry in our action movies anymore.

This is pure pulp martial arts mayhem, and along with the first two installments, a wicked finale for the Fatal Fury series, even though it has jack to do with any of the games. Oh, and did I mention the dubbing is some of the best ever? I can't stand dubbs these days, but Fatal Fury has an all star cast with personality and energy.",1159056000,5,1527,4.78030303030303
1219110,4,B00000I86K,"I enjoy two things in anime, people fighting in giant robots and people fighting with super powers. This movie satisfies the latter in a major way.",1154304000,,147,4.6923076923076925
1219111,5,B00000I86K,I love the video games Fatal Fury and when I heard theirs a movie I just couldn't wait. After seeing the Street Fighter 2 movie it was great. I'm thinking the animation on this movies is just as good. I can tell this one will have lots of action,1125187200,2,245,4.020408163265306
1219112,5,B00000I86K,"When i was a child i first saw fatal fury the movie. At first i didn't really understand it when i was little, but as i aged i learned more about it. I watched this movie when i was about 10 years old and i am now currently 17. The time gap inbetween made me forget about it until one of my friends mentioned it. I then remembered everything about it. Since my friend brought it up i completely forgot about the movie and what it was called so i had to ask him. I even got a copy from him and that just made my day. After i viewed this movie i said to myself ""Oh my god"" this movie was one of my favorites and i will always value this movie no matter what anyone says. It was good when i was a child and it still is a great movie to me even to this day. So if your interested in a great anime that has action, love and comedy then this is the perfect movie for you!!",1115337600,3,866,3.7900552486187844
1219113,5,B00000I86K,"I'm not going to rehash the plot synopsis so I'll get straight to the point.  This is my favorite out of the Fatal Fury movies and ranks as one of my favorite animes of all time.  This series did what almost no other video game OVAs have done (barring the Street Fighter 2 animated movie).  They actually made you care about the characters and possibly love them even more than their game counterparts.  Terry Bogard is my fighting game hero and he was made even greater when I watched this series years ago on VHS and the Sci-Fi Channel.  Joe Higashi proves to be much more than a goofball as he dispenses advice to Terry about love over a glass of whiskey.  Mai and her lovable ""twins"" are also very entertaining.  If you consider yourself any sort of anime fan you will watch this movie, and that goes double if you've played and loved the games.",1095724800,2,849,4.403846153846154

1219115,5,B00000I86K,"It is pretty much a solid fact that most Video Game movies tend to suck.  Even in the Anime world there are some that are at best Mediocre, however despite some criticism this is truely one of the better action Anime videos available, as well as Video Game inspired.
The story is that Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi, and Mai get recruited by this frightend girl Sulia to stop her Brother Lalcorn from gathering the armor of Goddamous, and ancient God back in the Days of Alexander the Great.  Throughout the movie they search for clues as other Warriors get taken out in the meantime.  Eventually the four of the Square off against Lalcorn and his Henchmen in an action packed finally.
This movie did what hollywood could not, capture the essence of the video game inside the movie and create an incredible story around it.  To date from my personal viewing the only other Anime series to date that has done this task was Street Fighter 2V.  If you are just getting into Anime, or an Action Anime fan than this is a title to check into.",1077494400,,1044,4.502645502645502
1219116,5,B00000I86K,When I first got this movie I had thought I was some kind of sequel to Street Fighter but I was wrong.  Fatal Fury was 1 of the best I've seen.  This is my second best anime next to the Street FighterII series.  Kids who can't really watch a PG-13 movie or R I suggest you shouldn't watch this because there are some blood and gore scenes and a hott shower scene.  I hope this was helpful.  ...,1055376000,3,394,4.0
1219117,4,B00000I86K,"This movie was great! I really liked FATAL FURY the MOTION PICTURE and for me personally, it was the end complete to the series (FATAL FURY, Legend of the Hungry Wolf and FATAL FURY 2). This one starts out a bit on the slow side, but once the movie kicks in a little, it's full throttle from there.
It starts out that the whole gang is getting back together to celebrate Joe Higashi's full recovery and return to the Muay Thai ring. Andy and Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui are all back together again and this time they find out that the legend of a mystical armor (the Armor of Mars) is true and that if all 6 pieces of the armor were to come together, they wearer would be invincible. By accident, they find a young girl named Sulia amd she's being hunted down by some very strange enemies. The gang then finds out that the people chasing her are working for her brother, Laucorn. He needs his sister to help him find the final 3 pieces of the armor and become a God. It's up to Joe, Terry, Andy and Mai to stop him and protect Sulia at all costs.
The animation in this is great, the action is a vast step up from FATAL FURY 2 and the story is also great. And for all you scurvy pervies out there, there is a shower scene with Mai Shiranui. I'd check this one out. Out of the 3 FATAL FURY series videos, this one is my favorite. Check it out, you'll definitely enjoy this one!",1042761600,8,1377,4.1610486891385765
1219118,5,B00000I86K,"When i first saw this movie I had borrowed it from a freind that lived 3000 miles away. Actually he kind of gave it to me. It was  day before my first year of high school and i stayed up all night and watched it to pass time until my bus came. That was when i experianced one of the best anime (my intro to it actually) I've ever seen. This movie has great action sequences, a superb plot, and excellent character development. It stays true to the series in that Mei absolutely adores Andy (who doesn't really acknowledge their relationship it seems, or downplays it anyway). Also includes Kim Kaphown's kids (one of whom is in an snk fighter when he grows up...). The main villians are very well developed (thru flashbacks) and you really feel the pain of the main villain, so you can understand his actions (to a point). A must get for any fatal fury fan or anime fan. Also includes one of the best pieces of vocal anime music ever: Oh Angel by Trish LeDoux (I believe).",1011398400,5,972,4.34065934065934
1219119,4,B00000I86K,"After beating Geese and Krauser, Terry Bogard is now up against Laocorn Gaudemus, a power-hungry individual who will attain the power of a god if he collects all six pieces of the Armor of Mars scattered all over the world. Laocorn's twin sister, Sulia, asks Terry, Joe, Mai, and Andy for help in her quest to regain the sanity of her brother, and to find the three pieces that Laocorn has not yet found. Terry and friends have to not only find the pieces and defeat Laocorn, but fight Laocorn's three henchmen, who are also after the pieces. A romance between Terry and Sulia unfolds, similar to that with Lily in the first tape, and Andy once again proves that he's not a straight male by shunning the relentless Mai away countless times. Speaking of Mai, there're plenty of chest-bouncing and pop-outs in the feature. The soundtrack is fine, and although orchestrated this time, is not as good as those of the past two tapes. The ending theme, on the other hand, is awesome, no matter if it is the English or Japanese version.
A flaw that scars the story is that the translation, both in the dubbed and subtitled versions, is not entirely accurate, though the basis of the story is intact. Another flaw is that some of the fight scenes toward the end are pretty disappointing, seeing as how strong some of the enemies are and how easily they ended up being defeated. The scene access option in the DVD version is strangely lacking, but there's a nice conceptual drawings section and character info. Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture surpasses Samurai Shodown, Street Fighter, Toshinden, and Tekken in the arena for best fighting game anime.",992908800,,1640,4.7177700348432055

Well, most reviewrs have the plot posted, so I won't do that. The plot is cool, better than any of the OAVs, I thought. Sulia is one hot babe, and I throuoghly enjoyed it. Following is specs that any anime fan/collector appreciate:
Yes, it's subbed. English and Japanese audio track. Picture quality is good, if not great. Nothing cut in here. Hehe. Audio is cool, and the Japanese audio track sounds better (Digital Dolby 4.0 vs 2.0(stereo) for Eng track). A bit of extras (eg. both Eng and Japanese original Trailers, conceptual pics, background etc) but I bought this for the movie. All is exactly what an avid anime fan/otaku (like me) looks for in an anime DVD, and other than the slightly ugly subtitling (which you will get used to), I'm VERY very satisfied.

In the story Terry and Andy Bogard along with Joe Higashi and Mai Shiranui must stop the ancestor of an evil king who is tring to collect pieces of a suit of armor that will make him a god.
