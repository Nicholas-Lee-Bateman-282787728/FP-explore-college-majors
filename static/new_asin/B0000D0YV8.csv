7999759,5,B0000D0YV8,"Tangy was extradionary, it shows you what spring break is really about.  It's cool when somebody lives the experience and then transforms it into a film.  Girls in bikinis getting wild is what defines spring break, and there is some skin showed in the film.  Another real fact from the movie is when guys put drugs into girls alcohol drinks(real fact) I thought that was cool for the public to know, specially young girls who haven't experience spring break.  Explendid movie, I highly recommended, you'll laugh your ass off.  Word Up!!!!!!!!",1085702400,3,542,4.912087912087912
7999760,5,B0000D0YV8,"Mike Deeney has proven to be quite a gifted filmmaker with his first movie, ""Tangy Guacamole"".
I don't want to spoil a second of the film for you, so I won't bother with a plot summary...just be ready for some terrific writing, directing, and acting.  The scenes are well thought out, hilarious, and, (for all of us spring-breakers out there...), totally appropriate for the themes of the movie.
Everything about this film conveys Deeney's true love of cinema as art and a source of entertainment.  He blends the two in a mixture more hot than tangy, and into something more rich than guacamole.
For the High School/College scene, this film is truly a breath of fresh air, letting us know that the fun, rauncy, sexy, crazy comedies of the past are still alive.  For those of you past your Spring Breakin' days, this film should serve as a nostalgic piece, one that allows you to reminisce back to your youth, when you were all insane, and worry-free...hell, you just loved having fun...",1078185600,4,986,4.72093023255814
7999761,5,B0000D0YV8,"The characters speak to me (and for me) in this epic story about Spring Break in ""The Mexico."" The absolute ability to capture every college Spring Break into one picture is Mike Deeney's true success.  This is a must see if you are in college, or have ever been on a Spring Break trip, to anywhere!!",1070323200,2,300,4.357142857142857
7999762,5,B0000D0YV8,This film was very clever and different from many of the films released today. Deeney has a wild style in his directing efforts and has put together a great spring break flick. Funny cast! Pass the word of mouth on this one.,1068422400,2,224,4.357142857142857
7999763,5,B0000D0YV8,Watch for this movie to steal the show at this year's Sundance Film Festival. Early buzz has it set to capture multiple Teen Awards for 2003 (might be a bit premature to call this an Oscar contender but who knows?),1068076800,3,214,4.375
