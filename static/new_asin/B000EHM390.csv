2518676,5,B000EHM390,"I saw ""Cluny Brown"" years ago, on broadcast TV in NYC.  Recently, I rhought of this wonderful, charming, funny, well-written movie, (a comedy with a subtle, but very important message), again.  I searched for a DVD of it I might buy on Amazon....but could find only ""Region 2"" DVDs, which are NOR playable on most North American DVD players.  I was, however, happily able to see it on one of the ""broadast yourself"" sites on the net.  It was a very sharp, clear copy -- but the fact that it was in ten parts did make it more than a bit inconvenient to view.

However, it was more than worth the inconvenience to again see this truly classic film!  It stars JENNIFER JONES as a young orphan, living with her uncle, a plumber.  Bright, eager for happiness in her life, and also having inherited a (very unfeminine?) interest in, and talent for, plumbing, beautiful Cluny Brown goes out on a plumbing job when her uncle can't make it.  Lady (or is that 'woman'?) plumbers are still relatively rare in 2011 -- so imagine how surprised the person expecting plumbing help is, (in this 1938 movie), when a pretty young girl comes to help with his plumbing problems!  A guest of this man, (male lead CHARLES BOYER), is in this home as well.  He is ""Professor Bolinsky"", a famous but poor refugee writer from the Nazi invasion of his European homeland.
Cluny is successful at the job -- but when she comes home, her uncle -- exasperate4d by her high spirits, and her refusal to ""know her place"", decides to send her ""into service"" ....as a maid of a wealthy, titled couple.  (Their son,
played by PETER LAWFORD -- himself of REAL English nobility in real life -- is also present.)

Cluny is welcomed warmly into this aristocratic household.  The Lord and Lady of the home are very kind, and offer her tea and crumpets.  However, their mood changes when they realize that Cluny is to be the new maid ....and that their thinking she was the aristocratic young lady they were expecring was merely a case
of mistaken identity.  She is sent forthwith to the servants' quarters, under the stern gaze of the butler and the housekeeper.

A guest at the home of the Lord and Lady is Professor Bolinsky.  He is perceived as a very romantic and brave figure, by Lord, Lady and son.  Professor Bolinsky and Cluny are surprised, but happy to see each other again.  At dinner, Cluny, serving the meal, whispers to his Lordship to take one piece of meat, rather than another, because the first is a bit fatty.  After dinner, it is decided that Cluny should soon be dismissed.....because she spoke to the master of the house as an Equal!

There is a possibility that Cluny could leave her servant's status by marriage.  But the man picked out for her is a rather super-proud middle-class chemist.  This apothecary makes his customers wait for him to come to them, plays the piano as if it was an organ at a funeral, and has a mother who has interest in very little, constantly clears her throat, and snores a great deal.  At a b5th birthday birthday partt for the apothecary's mother, some pipes go bad in the bathroom.  Cluny -- with the aid of a young boy, (the only person, other than Cluny, who actually seems to have some spark of liveliness in him), fixes the pipes.  But the apothecary is horrendously embarrassed that Cluny has shown a side of her other than being an obedient and compliant fiancee and wife-to-be.  Cluny promises to be more careful not to do such things in the future, and leaves.

She meets with Professor Bolinsky in the park.  They throw nuts to the squirrels,
but Bolinsky prefers the (very telling) phrase, ""Squirrels To The Nuts""!

.............................................................................

It is very telling in this movie that those with power in it -- be they landed aristocrats or middle-class apothecaries -- treat those they do not consider their equals, (servants, customers), with disdain.  A disdain almost, (but not completely), approaching the Nazi attitude towardes ""inferiour"" (races.)  It is also very telling of the lessons of World War II, that things have changed, (however slightly), in many areas of life, since then.  Prejudices -- though they haven't completely disappeared -- have greatly diminished, and servants are far better treated than they were before the war.  Today, the master of the house would, in all probablity, thank the maid who served him dinner and steered him to the better piece of meat.

These lessons are humourusly, and delightfully taught in ""Cluny Brown"".  No facts and figures of how the rich are getting outlandlishly richer, and how they gouge their employees and customers.  No hitting people over the head with scenes of want and starvation.  Just an entrancing story, so well-told, with humour, just a little pathos, and great acting, directing, writing, music, and other production values.

In 2011, it was announced that Prince William and Catherine Middleton have decided NOT to have ANY servants during the first years of their marriage.  (He cooks!)
Although ""lesse majesty"" will, I think, be avoided, Prince William and his very soon bride-to-be herald, I think, no less than a new chapter in human history -- where the worth and contributions of EVERY individual will be seen as worthwhile,
as we continue to look to leaders, (leaders who, whether born to, or elected to their positions, have totally EARNED their followers respect), to guide us with their wisdom and knowledge, ""Moses""-style.  (It is told that Moses was put into the palace so that he COULD become a leader -- and not grow up with the bitterness, anger, and frustration that ""ordinary"" people too often have.  There truly IS something to be said for having rich people -- with compassion and empathy -- to look up to as leaders....

CLUNY BROWN is a tale of humankind's basic equality....wrapped in a romantic comedy of manners.  It is a movie to watch, over and over again.  As the song says, ""A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down....in the most delightful way!""

P L E A S E....have this wonderful film in Region One DVD format -- and soon!",1301443200,6,6107,4.783396946564886
2518677,3,B000EHM390,"A charming film in some ways, with some characteristic cameos & subordinate roles. But oh dear, what is the explanation of the heroine's American accent, when her uncle is a cockney plumber? Jennifer Jones makes almost no effort to conceal her country of origin (or the fancy makeup she claims she's not wearing). Helen Walker is excellent (good accent) as the blas aristocrat, Richard Haydn ditto as the prune-faced chemist, but I spent the film wondering about the problem alluded to above and whether, if Cluny Brown had had a London twang, the donne of the script would have been possible at all, since the misunderstandings at the beginning about her class status could not have occurred. In the novel, I believe, her social class is evident, and the implicit problem more her sexual attractiveness, very underplayed in the film except at the beginning when she is drunk. The film's play on ""displacement"" is thus somewhat awkwardly exemplified by this gap in credibility - when we see her at the end strolling on 5th Ave. she seems like a fish finally back in the water...I love Charles Boyer's performance - if only he had ended up with the more convincing character of Betty Cream.",1257897600,,1189,4.833333333333333
2518678,4,B000EHM390,"That's a funny comedy that takes England as the target of its humor, the England of 1938 and what's more the aristocracy and their twisted class relations with their servants. It is humorous by the way it shows how an Eastern European can easily trap the aristocrats in 1938 with the sound of Prague, some good manners and a little bit of anti-nazism. That Adam Belinski is able to charm these English aristocrats, especially the son who wants to go and fight against Hitler, and his parents who do not even ask a question, or hardly. That Czech refugee is able to live on that noble family for a while before leaving for America along with the maid who arrived the same day as him and he had met in London before. The comedy is funny because that girl, who is not an aristocrat, far from it, does all the mistakes you can imagine English etiquette is going to frown upon severely. She pretends to be a plumber and she repairs some toilet or washstand in a jiffy in front of a middleclass family, their guests and the pharmacist who was getting enamored. The result is the departure of all the guests, after the departure of the pharmacist's mother, and then she is practically rejected. She does not know what class differences are. She will of course be captured by the Czech refugee and taken to America where he is going to become a popular writer and she will finally be away from silly class distinctions. It is funnily absurd and the Lord and his Lady are just pass and old-fashioned, quaint is probably the word if we want to remain nice. Lubitsch takes great pleasure at showing how silly such class-distinctions are. The whole comedy is more humorous than really funny and that humor always remains polite, even at times mundane, though in the light American way.

2518679,5,B000EHM390,"The only review on this page is incorrect when describing the storyline of this film. I've actually watched the film and it is about a plumber's niece (Jennifer Jones) who takes matters into her own hands when her uncle cannot take a call. She meets the very poor but fascinating author (Charles Boyer) who has escaped capture by the Nazis who have marched upon his native country. Cluny's uncle thinks she is influenced by too many social desires and, in an effort to keep her in her place, sends her to serve a wealthy family outside of London. Once there, she meets the author again as he is a houseguest. Cluny also meets a fairly well-to-do chemist in the nearest town who woos her but is subject to his aging mother's opinion. Needless to say, because this is a comedy, Cluny and the professor/author fall in love and form a new life in America. The story is incredibly sweet and endearing. I have introduced this movie to as many people as I possibly could. I hope this helps coming from someone who knows the movie by heart.",1226361600,19,1032,4.524064171122995

2518692,5,B000EHM390,"Lubitsch gives us a delightful take on British manners and class structure...this film is witty and beautiful.  It's Jennifer Jones' best, methinks, and Peter Lawford has never been better, never!  not even in Easter Parade.  He we see what a sensitive actor he could be, rather like Michael Wilding.  The story and sets are delicious and I won't give it away but I ADORE the last scene. I replay it every time I watch this movie.",1463875200,,430,4.618421052631579

2518698,5,B000EHM390,"Loving almost all things Boyer as I do - another wonderful film I've been keen to own for some time.
Miss Jones is fine as Cluny but it is her scenes with Boyer that sing. Sly satire on British manners and absolutely the best part I've ever seen Peter Lawford in, bar none. He is delightful as the well to do scion of a British family who invites Czech migr Charles Boyer to stay in his parents 'house.'
Charming and amusing - I'm guessing you will smile all  the way through.",1441584000,5,476,4.230769230769231
2518699,5,B000EHM390,"This is technically the last of Lubitsch's films (he started and was credited with That Lady in Ermine but died before it's completion and the malevolent Otto Preminger was asked by Zanuck to finish the film....and he basically destroyed all of Lubitsch's ideas with his gargantuan ego).  This has long been unavailable on DVD because like so many other great films, the copyright was not renewed at 28 years (the old law) and it fell into the public domain.  The print is acceptable and to be frank I was so grateful to get a copy of it, I could put up with ""acceptable"" over pristine.  So many great films (Life With Father, Meet John Doe, Penny Serenade, My Man Godfrey to name just a few) have ended up in this state with very inferior prints by various companies.  So sad. In truth on one half the films made before 1950 have decent prints still in existence...which of course is a very good reason to give money to the Eastman House, UCLA film archives or any other organization that restores them.  Criterion recently restored the most famous of the aforementioned films (My Man Godfrey) and I have to confess I have not had the financial means to buy a print but I plan to. They do excellent work....I just wish they would rescue this and the other three I mentioned. They are classics. When Cluny Brown was released it did not fare financially as well as Lubitsch's other films, I think it still made a little money. I think it is wonderfully witty and both  Boyer's and Jones' performance are amazing!  The only bomb Lubitsch ever made was the very flat ""That Uncertain Feeling"" with Merle Oberon, Melvyn Douglas, and Burgess Meredith and I still found it to have some of the ""Lubitsch touch"".  Do yourself a favor and buy a copy of this before it vanishes. It is delightfully eccentric and is a perfect swan song for the genius that was Ernst Lubitsch.",1437350400,11,1863,4.573573573573573

8109681,5,B000EHM390,"I waited a long time, for some reason to view this movie and was most pleasantly surprised!  It isn't one belly laugh after another, for sure, but it's charming, funny, thoughtful, and well worth watching.  Of course it has the undercurrent of the approaching menacing war and the unwillingness of the Brits to acknowledge it, and the discrepancy between the classes upheld by the very people who will soon be fighting Nazis for oppressing groups, a point to which the British strongly objected when the film came out--a point already brought up by at least one reviewer.  Apparently Sir Aubrey Smith apologized to his countrymen for appearing in it.  Interestingly, being more open at the time to moving across social class lines, American audiences loved it.  However, for me, the main attraction is the sweet and golden Lubitsch touch which graces this film, the director's last.  The many subtly charming and just plain funny situations are wonderful.  I also liked the lilting music and the period costumes.

As far as the players, I always love the suave Charles Boyer, and he didn't disappoint, anywhere.  I could just close my eyes and listen to his rich voice and make parts of his movies come to life for me.  His character in this one was such a smooth moocher, it made me laugh every time he put it past everybody else--except the astute Reginald Gardiner in the beginning who is often underrated or overlooked, I think, in film.  He was a rich comedian.  (See him in the priceless ""Molly and Me"" with Gracie Fields and Roddy McDowell for some of his best work).  Peter Lawford was very good as well, and I agree with another reviewer who said this performance equaled or bettered his in Easter Parade's.  Jennifer Jones was simply charming, and very funny, especially in the plumbing sequences.  Una O'Connor is always a very funny, crabby old biddy, and her throat-clearing and snoring added a lot to the drab atmosphere in the stuffy pharmacist's house.  As for Boyer ending up with Betty Cream, as another reviewer suggested (the name of that actress escapes me), I can't think of a worse fate for him.  She should have been left to poor Lawford, as she ultimately was!

The final scene was a great relief for poor Cluny and had wonderful details--from the rickety bicycle ride to the (symbolic and real) throwing out of the cap and apron from the train window, to the last shot of the books in the window, complete with sequel (the hated nightingale, no less, as the murderer).  Perfect!

A final point:  While I agree with other reviewers that Jennifer Jones's character would have been more convincing with an accent, and would, in fact, have resulted in a nearly PERFECT performance, I think she WAS convincing in her part, as were many classic film actors who were put into similar situations in the days of the studio system:  contracted to play British or American roles without the accompanying appropriate accent.  (Think Freddie Bartholomew, playing the son of American tycoon Melvyn Douglas in ""Captains Courageous,"" who has a strong British accent, clearly out of place, or, conversely, Walter Pidgeon, playing the husband of British (technically, Irish) Greer Garson in ""Mrs. Miniver,"" who had an American accent, as well as the daughter-in-law, Teresa Wright, who played, with an American accent, the granddaughter of the haughty, aristocratic British May Whitty. )  Most viewers just get used to the lack of the accent, if they notice it at all, after the first few minutes, providing the performance is good.  After all, it would have been a lot worse if Jennifer Jones had attempted a Cockney accent (and maybe she did!--and couldn't do it) and made a hash of it, as do some actors, whose bad accents are immortalized on film--ugh!  Maybe she just wasn't the Meryl Streep of her day.  Although I'm not usually a #1 fan of Jennifer Jones, I thought Cluny Brown was a winning performance for her.

All in all, I thought Cluny Brown was a pretty darn good movie, with good-to-excellent performances from all players, as well as great production values; the legendary director's last film was also his production, and it was a worthwhile one to go out on.",1493510400,2,4184,4.838483146067416
