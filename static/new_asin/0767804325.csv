28978,3,0767804325,"The issue of leaking information to the press has been around for years, and this film does its best to illustrate how badly it can backfire when the sources aren't properly checked and re-checked.
Having said that, and  being a journalist myself, I just want to shoot Sally Field for her gross  violations of journalist ethics.  Getting involved with the subject?  No  how, no way.  It just isn't done.  If you can accept this HUGE leap of  journalistic and editorial faith, then the rest of the movie is a  breeze.
Aside from Newman, I think the best performance in the movie is  one of the briefest...Wilford Brimley as the U.S. Attorney who gets to the  bottom of the mess.  It's just a pleasure to watch him go through the paces  of tearing Bob Balaban's little vendetta all to pieces, and to experience  his grudging approval to let Newman walk.",956016000,28,851,4.624161073825503

28992,5,0767804325,"Elliott Rosen is an obsessive prosecutor who is desperate to get some inside info on the ""mob."" He steps in to a moral grey area in his pursuit. Knowing that Michael Colin Gallagher (Paul Newman) is innocent of any crime he plans to push him into finding out who did it. The plan is simple he will leak the false fact out, through reporter Megan Carter (Sally Field), that Gallagher is being investigated. This information has a negative impact on Gallagher's business. Further pursuit leads to a death of the innocent. Naturally the paper that prints this has no intention of retracting. Gallagher finds a unique solution. See if you can spot it.

This movie does not make an immediate impact on you with the exception of Brimley's final confrontation speech. However repeated viewing brings out the subtleties that will make this one of your favorite movies for years to come.",1503446400,2,878,4.814569536423841

28996,2,0767804325,"Review of Absence of Malice
Hot Toasty Rag, July 10, 2017

The premise is superbly intriguing: A man reads an article about himself in the newspaper one morning, which pretty much accuses him of murder. The movie, even with the likable and compelling lead Paul Newman, doesnt really deliver on its great intro.

Paul Newman isn't happy with the article, and he tracks down the journalist responsible, Sally Field. Im not really a Sally Field fan anyway, and this movie did nothing to change my opinion of her. I found her annoying, and it took all my strength to pretend to take her seriously. Since all my strength was used up, I had none left to focus on the plot, and with all the twists and turns, I got pretty confused. If you have no problem paying attention to who-said-what, whos-the-source, whos-after-who stories, and you don't mind Sally Field, youll have a better chance at liking Absence of Malice than I did.",1499644800,,922,4.685185185185185

The introduction is a wonderful illustration of how newspapers were actually physically put together at the time the film was made.

29012,5,0767804325,"Perhaps this movie was ahead of its time given the contemporary environment with the US media. Journalistic ambition, a corrupt federal prosecutor and a cunning victim come together for one of the most satisfying conclusions highlighted by the introduction of WIlford Brimley make this a very satisfying movie. Paul Newman is the accused, but he knows how to turn the tables on his accusers. Sally Field plays a very ambitious reporter somewhat short on moral integrity who ends up in a relationship with Newman. Someone close to Newman pays the ultimate price that brings home to Field how far she has strayed with her ambitions. It is fun to watch Newman in action as the unflappable (most of the time) protagonist who isn't afraid to tap some of the resources in his checked family past (such as the Mob) to grease the way for his revenge. Top cast, excellent story, and a cautionary tale about how the media behaves.",1483228800,5,920,4.7924528301886795

29051,5,0767804325,"What a perfect entry in the long and storied list of great films about Journalism in America. Depending on the story/narrative and the director, you either have the ""Journalists are heroes"" take (All the President's Men) or the Journos are evil take (Shattered Glass). This thoughtful Sydney Pollack-helmed film interrogates the question of whether the press, regardless of its Constitutional rights, really should destroy a citizen's life just because, in legal terms there is no 'absence of malice'. Paul Newman plays said citizen, and does so in the excellent fashion he did pretty much his entire career. Sally Field is absolutely top notch as an over-eager reporter who just may have stepped over a line that is not very well defined to begin with. The script, by a former journalist who apparently based Newman's character on a real life victim of over-zealous reporting is really, really good. Example, at the end of the film Newman's character says to Fields': ""I suspect you are a damn good reporter,"" to which she replies ""not yet."" Great stuff, fleshed out by a great supporting cast. As many reviewers point out, Wilford Brimley threatens to take over the film in the final scene. Much the same way Jose Ferrer did so brilliantly at the end of The Caine Mutiny. But that doesn't detract, it only adds to the pitch perfect accomplishment of the film.",1453852800,5,1361,4.921739130434783

It makes it more real how damaging the news media can be and how it creates drama and chaos in order to profit from such actions and not caring who they destroy in the process.  Sally Field's character as a news woman finally gets a conscience but after it's too late.  Too bad more news people don't develope one.  Especially their editors and journalism instructors.  Unethical and junk food journalism is still alive and well and worse than when this movie was made.  You may see that once you see this film.

This was one and he was marvelous in it getting a Academy Award Nomination for his role as Mike Gallagher, a Miami liquor wholesaler, who finds his whole world turned upside down when a story simply meant to apply pressure on him by a rogue government investigator to find out what happened to a union official that disappeared six months earlier.  He has no idea.  His father had been a bootlegger years earlier, but he was totally straight and legal.  The articles written turns the union against him and destroys his business.  While totally innocent of anything he is the one that gets dumped on.  Like the newspaper lawyer says, ""Since there is a absence of malice, were are free to say whatever we want about Mr. Gallagher and there is nothing he can do about it!"" -- Want to bet?

29114,5,0767804325,"In the middle of watching  this  5 star movie a fourth time
While this in origin and appearance  is about the abuse of the ""power of the press"" it is also a story of the abuse of power by the justice department. And this is the plot point that sets US AAG  JJ Wells / the actor Wilford Brimley in the catbird seat and in some  respects gives the viewer hope that we have a self correcting system. Brimley performs flawlessly and gives us hope in a system in failure. However this is acting and, in truth, there is as much real doubt about the quality of the actions or acting in the real world of the justice department, federal judges as there is about the operation of ""the press""  in short the whole ""system"". The movie is great as the script, cinematography &  direction raise the real questions.......... who are the criminals ....... as it turns out a  civil servant loses his job...... and an elected official is ...  well own his own..... a paper ""not retracting a word"" while a death, a business and ruined careers lay around as results of the ""law"" ... "" breaking the laws"". suspicion has it there are still criminals on the federal payroll unfortunately the question is shifting from are there any? through how many? to who is not?",1424822400,,1242,4.436123348017621

Pros:
At least the acting was average to above-average, except for:
Paul Newman, who didn't act any better than a popsicle-stick would have
Wilford Brimley was exceptional
Miami setting (which we see very little of)

Cons:
Slow, boring story
Convoluted plot
Stoic facial expressions
Didn't really care if anyone came out on the good end
I don't like to yawn incessantly when I watch a movie
Exceedingly, begrudgingly, and unnecessarily long

Overall, I was let down by the whole thing. I remember TV shows of the day that came off better than Absence of Malice week after week. Case in point, The Rockford Files, Cannon, Columbo, Beretta, etc. I'll be selling my Blu-ray. I will revel in its ""absence"" from my collection.",1413590400,,925,4.95483870967742

I have rented this movie so many times over the years that my family complains.  Now they will not complain because it is in my Amazon library.  I think in the long run it was the actors.  Every one that was cast seem to have molded themselves into their roles.
The movie is worth the price for last 15 min. When Willford Brimley has the best chew-out session in the history of motion pictures.

29140,4,0767804325,"That is not the best of all films about crime in Miami: we are still a long way from Dexter. There is no real suspense since the person who disappeared six months earlier is not found and the person responsible for his disappearance is not identified either. In fact we have a completely different film than a real criminal investigation.

Some police force, or rather one person, a prosecutor, using that police force decides to target a man who apparently has nothing to do with any real crime, just because his father was a mafia bootlegger, so out of spite and with the intend to . . . and that's just the point: reveal a criminal? But Mr. policeman is acting on a hunch, not real evidence and then later on even without the necessary warrant to tap the phones of the concerned person. So he leaks a file in the first part of this investigation, and then his direct subordinate leaks the file in the second part of the investigation that has actually become totally illegal after the DA had declared it closed

In that net a 34 year old journalist finds herself trapped between hurting people and promoting her career, under the guidance of an editor who will get her off the case when the department of justice gets his big nose in the imbroglio. She hurts a lot of people actually. She even causes the suicide of one person. And that person had told her clearly enough that she couldn't take the publicity of her abortion. But she quoted her name nevertheless.

The man who is targeted just plays back and settles his own accounts with the DA and the police force that is concerned here. He manages to ruin the reputation of the DA and to ruin the career of the cop. And then he sells his house, and business I guess, and sails to the North East, leaving the girl behind and with no promise that he would answer if she wrote and no request on her part for him to write.

The acting is OK but the plot is slightly easy and the absence of malice is definitely not true of the cop who wants to hurt the man, Michael Gallagher by the way, out of pure vanity; nor of Gallagher once he decides to settle these accounts. The only one who has no intent to hurt anyone is the poor journalist but she is absolutely nave and unconscious since she causes one suicide. Irresponsible, it is called in my book of ethics.

29142,5,0767804325,"Paul Newman; Sally Field's DVD Movie, ""Absence of Malice"" is a excellent movie and Paul Newman had stated he had contributed
his acting skills to this film before he died due to the Malice of the general Media whom takes no responsibility in the crap that they
print in the newspapers. Weather the information printed in the news or on television is acquate is highly irrelevant. What does matter is how high the ratings goes on the nightly; morning news; or in the papers !!!! This is pretty much what this movie was about, Sally Field was a nieve; ambitious; kind of simple minded news reporter whom was always out to get the story. The only problem was, was weather she got her facts straight or not!!!  --- and if it cost someone's job; life; or their integrity. The storyline
was excellent and the casting was excellent. It is not to often that directors and/or executive producers get the casting correct so that the storyline is believable. Sidney Pollack did a hell of a jog with this film in real life and a fictious story, as well as the writer. I have seen this film many times and it is very much a part of my movie library. WELL WORTH SEEING FOR YOURSELF!!! Especially the role that Paul Newman plays as a syndicated mob boss's nephew, Michael Gallagher; the District DA; an special task force; an investigator investigating something that really did not happen. Then the feds come in and start investigating the investigators about fictious stories which are being printed in the papers by Sally Field and the Newpaper company she's working for. Her character is a real idiot in this movie. She kind of reminds you of someone whom is totally inept at her job.

29156,5,0767804325,"This movie is an important but fairly low key movie. It is also a thinking person's movie. It tackles the important issue of First Amendment rights. The American press is highly protected by the First Amendment right to free speech, and needs to be. However the American press is just as interested in making money as anyone else, and is likely to do almost anything to make that happen. The big question becomes how one balances these two incompatible goals? This movie pits these two goals against one another in a tight, drama filled picture that is devoid of car chases, gun battles, and funny sidekicks. Paul Newman is perfect in his role as an experienced small business owner pitted against an aggressive Justice Department inquiry and the public outcry from the community in which he lives, once he is exposed by the local paper. As it happens, this public disclosure does more damage than expected. It follows Paul Newman's character as he tries to right a wrong with this system that seems perfectly willing to crush people in its path.

Paul Newman and Sally Field are positively excellent in this picture. They are joined by a number of excellent performances by others, most especially Wilford Brimley, who displays incredible talent in his role as the assistant attorney general. I've seen Wilford Brimley in a number of movies and he has always delivered a first-rate performance. Here, however, he delivers a true masterpiece. This clearly should have been an Academy award-winning performance. This movie is worth seeing just to see that performance.

In my mind, this is a must see movie. It should be shown in every civics class in every high school of every city of every state of the union. No person should be allowed to graduate without having given this movie serious thought, by writing a term paper that obtained a B or above.",1393372800,5,1852,4.839116719242902

Bonus features include a tasty ""Story Behind the Movie"", which features Paul Newman and Sally Field, several years after the 1981 release. A trailer is also here for you to enjoy (a well-crafted one, I might add). The entire cast is special  and there are many memorable moments and character nuances. Wilford Brimley is incredible. He only has fairly brief screen time, but his personna here is famously recreated in the Seinfeld episode where he grills Kramer in the Postal office. ""Newman!""(I couldn't resist, Paul!)  I really enjoy this movie, despite a few changes I'd have encouraged. Paul Newman reportedly (based on Sally Field's words in the ""Story Of..."" bonus feature) was very uncomfortable with staging the scene where he becomes angry/ violent with her. I share this sentiment, and would have had him tell her to get out and left it at that. Also, in view of all of the goings-on, I have a hard time believing the romance aspect between Field and Newman. Real? Paul setting her up? In either regard, a tough sell for me. Still, for Paul Newman fans, it's another great and understated performance. One of the better films of the '80's, and Image Entertainment , as usual, gives it a first rate spin on bluray.

29170,4,0767804325,"Absence of Malice, 1981 film

It begins with movies of a meeting of men for a funeral. They are the targets of an investigation by Federal officials. The locale is around Miami Florida. Will a worker get in trouble for mentioning a name? Megan goes to interview a government agent. Will he plant a story on this reporter? Will she suspect something? Can this story be printed? Can they interview Michael Gallagher? He shows up to complain to the reporter. What will they print when the truth is found? The Head of the Strike Force explains his strategy: turn Gallagher into an informant. [But what if he is innocent?] Megan joins Gallagher for lunch; they converse about the media. If charged, people assume guilt. If not guilty, nobody cares. [Sad but true.] There is a conflict over labor. Later Gallagher meets Megan; they talk.

Megan's father was a banker. Gallagher's father was convicted of loan-sharking. Gallagher meets his uncle. Who is setting him up? Megan meets Theresa in public. She was with Michael at the time, but she can't go public because of her job with a school. It was a personal problem. What is relevant in this story? [Don't talk to a reporter about anything?] Theresa has an accident and died at home. [Note the mix of typewriters and video terminals.] Megan tells Michael who leaked the story. The investigation continues to target Michael, even if innocent! Can Michael investigate Rosen? Gallagher offers a deal to a Federal investigator. Then he goes to see Megan and talk. The Feds announce the end of the investigation. Rosen wants new telephone taps (w/o a warrant!). Megan writes a front-page article.

Michael gets a telephone call from a friend. [Does a handkerchief over a telephone really disguise a voice?] Gallagher meets Quinn in a parking lot. A man takes pictures. Megan is told to bail out of the friendship. Was somebody bought off? Or was that a set-up? Does a newspaper print truthful facts? ""What's wrong?"" ""Things aren't always what they seem."" ""They usually are."" A new headline asks about a Quinn-Gallagher link. How true is this news? There is a meeting before the Assistant Attorney-General Wells. Either they talk or get a subpoena before the Grand Jury. They talk about anonymous contributions. Was this a frame-up? Megan tells about reading the file. ""I can't tell you."" Jimmy is responsible. Elliot will leave Government service. Does everybody lose? What happens next?

This seems to be a message movie about the abuse of power in government and the press. How many politicians use the press? This movie tries to educate you about the manipulation in the news. Do you believe everything you read in your newspaper? Ever learn of a crime in your neighborhood? How accurate was the newspaper report (if there even was a report)? One reason to omit a crime is to prevent a copy-cat repeat. Does the Justice Dept. act like in this movie? Who watches the watchers? This movie could be faster paced.

It's not as easy as turning on your TV, flipping open a newspaper, or clicking on a headline, even if most low information voters think that it is.

But let's begin at the top, with the performance of Wilford Brimley, who in a brief 10 minute appearance as a Department of Justice official, steals the show. Brimley has been in nearly 100 films, starting out in ""True Grit"" (1969) and giving us memorable performances in ""The Firm"" (1993), ""Cocoon"" (1985), ""The Natural"" (1984) and ""The China Syndrome."" He's best known as the TV spokesman for Liberty Mutual and Quaker Oats, where he says ""It's the right thing to do"" which is a line right from this film.

The film stars Paul Newman and Sally Field, and features Melinda Dillon, Josef Sommer,  Bob Balaban, and Luther Adler.

For Paul Newman this 1981 film came at the height of his career. He had 5 Oscar nominations in his belt and 4 more to go, including his sole win (""The Color of Money"", 1986). Sally Field was also at the top of her game having just won the Oscar for ""Norma Rae"" (1979). Both stars put in great performances.

Melinda Dillon was nominated as Best Supporting Actress for her role in this film, and was also nominated for ""Close Encounters"" (1977) in which co-star Bob Baladan also appears. She worked in the Group Theatre (as did co-star Luther Adler). She's made a few dozen films including ""Slap Shot"" (with Paul Newman) and ""Harry and the Hendersons"" (1987)

Josef Sommer plays a wise editor at the paper when Field works. Sommer has appeared in more than 100 films and TV shows, including ""Dirty Harry"" (1971), ""The Front"" (1976), ""Close Encounters"" (1977), and ""Witness"" (1985). He's played the President (""X-Men: The Last Stand""), Woodrow Wilson (""Young Indiana Jones""), Joseph Kennedy Sr. (""A Woman Named Jackie""), Gerald Ford (""The Betty Ford Story),and Franklin Roosevelt (""The Kennedys of Massachusetts""). He usually plays the good guy, but he showed us he is equally capable of playing the bad guy as Harrison Ford's crooked superior officer in ""Witness"".

Bob Baladan has given us memorable performances in more than 50 films. He was nominated for an Oscar in 2002 as an actor (""Gosford Park"") , twice nominated as a director by the DGA (""Bernard and Doris"" and ""Georgia O'Keefe"") and nominated for a Tony as Best Actor for ""The Inspector General."" He had a recurring role on ""Seinfeld"" as Russell Dalrymple. Along with this film I think his best work was in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977).

Luther Adler is a multi-talented actor that moved gracefully between stage, TV and film. He was the brother of Stella Adler and worked with Lee Strasberg in the Group Theatre. He appeared in the remake of ""M"" (1951), played Hitler in ""The Desert Fox"" (1951), and played Paul Muni's colleague in ""The Last Angry Man"" (1959). ""Absence of Malice"" was his last film.

The film is directed by Sydney Pollack. Pollack was 5 times nominated for an Oscar, and won once (""Out of Africa""). He often works with Robert Redford (8 films). Pollack directed such memorable films as ""Jeremiah Johnson"" (1972), ""Tootsie"" (1982), and ""Out of Africa"" (1982), He said of Paul Newman - ""You can feel his intelligence, you can see him thinking.""

The film is not only compelling as a film, it also provides a good look behind the scenes at a newspaper. Other films to lift the veil include ""The Front Page"" (1934), ""Citizen Kane""  (1941) ""All the President's Men"" (1976), ""Deadline USA"" (1952) , ""Sweet Smell of Success"" (1957), and ""Ace in the Hole"" (1951). Like ""Sweet Smell"" this film looks at the abuses of the media, and perhaps more than any other film, it shows that the subject is complex.

As good as the film is, it's far from perfect. The romantic subplot between Field and Newman is out of place and adds little to the plot. The film exposes problems with government and the media, and then suggests that a white knight will come charging in (Wilford Brimley) and save the day, which most times is not the case. And the ending is a little weak.

29219,5,0767804325,"This is a tremendously good movie.  It focuses on the harm that an overreaching Federal Government and an irresponsible press can inflict on an innocent private citizen.  Paul Newman plays Michael Gallagher, an honest but tough private citizen whose deceased father was a bootlegger and loan shark.  A viciously ambitious FBI agent leaks it to the press that Michael Gallagher is under investigation for the death of a labor leader.  The press runs with it (Sallie Field, in a competent but not great performance) and suddenly Gallagher's life is being besmirched on the front page of the newspapers.  As this process continues lives are ruined, Gallagher's business is decimated, and more would be telling.  The storyline here never drags, and every scene is critical to the story.  This film is quite literally riveting.

Wilford Brimley makes a fabulous entrance into this film at the end, and without giving anything away, it is a wonderful performance by Brimley, who appears to be the only character here who is truly interested in either common sense or justice.  The way he makes sense out of a terrible miscarriage of justice is heart-warming.  If only real life worked that way.  The rest of the supporting cast is excellent.  I was not impressed with Field, in this role.  She seemed one-dimensional and not really the right character type for this role.  Nor was the chemistry between Newman and Field of much use to the story.

The highlight of this film are the performances by Newman and Brimley.  Newman is perfect as the rough-hewn but honest Michael Gallagher, and Brimley, as discussed, is brilliant.  The real message of this film is the importance of a responsible press and responsible Federal agents.  There are too few of either.  This film is as relevant as today's headlines and always will be.

A five-star film in all respects.  RJB.",1256428800,3,1861,4.938709677419355
29220,4,0767804325,"A very talented lineup for a great movie and storyline.  Paul Newman, Sally Field, Melinda Dillon, Wilford Brimley and a delightfully slimy Bob Balaban top the roster in this head on assault of newsreporting and responsibility.  Newman plays the son trying to get past his criminal father's reputation.  Balaban is the field operative trying to break an old case involving the disappearance of a labor organizer and uses eager beaver reporter Fields to try to flush out information.  Dillon is the lifelong friend of Newman who gets innocently caught in the crossfire and when this happens Newman sets a plan in motion to make everyone pay.

The performance by Wilford Brimley alone is worth the price of admission as the U.S. Attorney sent to Miami ""to find out what in the Good Christ - excuse me Angie - is going on..."".  Priceless.

29224,4,0767804325,"With a tightly woven internal plot that will keep your interest and certainly satisfy your curiosity, `Absence of Malice' makes up for its Soap Operish approach to its main characters.  That is really my only complaint with the film actually.  The acting is all either very good or at least effective, and the overall plot is very nicely constructed; and even the predictable and somewhat unnecessary (and entirely unbelievable) love affair is entertaining at least.

Fact is, this is a very good movie.

Attacking the media and its `no holds bar' approach to `serving the community', `Absence of Malice' pins reporter against civilian as Megan Carter writes a story (under some corrupted influence) that paints Michael Colin Gallagher in an unbecoming light.  The thing is, the story is accurate but it's just not entirely truthful.  It's misleading and destructive yet it isn't something that Carter is willing to retract.  As Michael fights to clear his name he gets the cogs turning in his pursuit of revenge.

I actually think that the script is the films biggest ally as well as its biggest enemy.  The central plot is practically genius but the way it handles the relationship between Carter and Gallagher was just far too sappy.  I didn't like the whole `falling in love' aspect, for I felt it diminished the intensity and realism of the overall film.  It distracted the audience from the heart of the film by giving it an ulterior plot.

Thankfully it evens out enough to remain engaging and rewarding.

The acting is very good from everyone involved.  I love me some Sally Field, and here she captures her characters struggle for the truth very well.  You can see that she wants to believe everyone yet knows that she cannot.  Paul Newman is always good, so there really isn't more to say about that.  The thing with Newman is that he is so good all of the time that when he isn't `blowing our minds' we can tend to overlook his performance.  We expect him to be good, so if he doesn't push it then he can go unnoticed.  I kind of see that here.  He does a very good job, as always, but there is nothing extraordinary about this performance.  He builds fine layers of subtle emotional turmoil, and he is impressive (so don't for one second think I'm berating his performance) but to be honest this is far from his best work.  The supporting players are all effective.  Bob Balaban is remarkably seedy, Melinda Dillon is believably unstable and Wilford Brimley all but steals the show in his very small yet important scene at the films close.

So, I totally recommend this film.  It could have (and really should have) been better, but you can't expect perfection every time.  You can look at most movies and see where the director or writer could have made changes to make it just that much better, but when a film is this interesting, this engaging and this satisfying you just have to put those complaints beside you and indulge yourself on pure entertainment.",1239321600,4,2972,4.7223300970873785

""Absence of Malice is one of my all-time favorites, and the first ""older"" movie that I grabbed when it was finally released on DVD. In my opinion this is one film that should be required viewing for every journalism major in the USA. ""

Some reviewers' comments seem unwarranted:
.
(1) The movie is ""slow""?  (Not if you're paying attention to Paul Newman's brick-by-brick implementation of an  utterly brilliant revenge.)
(2) Sally Fields doesn't look too good?  (I think she looks better in this film than she's ever looked.)
(3) The ""attraction"" between Newman/Field is silly/implausible/the film's weak spot?  (I couldn't disagree more. The scenes with these two are some of the best written/best acted you'll ever see: the uneasy tentativeness, attraction sparring with distrust.  Is Newman using Fields?  Fields using Newman?  Both? Neither?  I'm still not sure.)

One reviewer called it the ultimate ""get even"" story, and - along w/The Shawshank Redemption - it is just that.  The scenes of the final hearing, Wilfred Brimley presiding, belong on the short list of Great Movie Denouements.

Seeing an opportunity and untramelled by such niceites as ethics he leaks the news of Gallagher's possible ""complicity""to an ambitious journalist ,Megan (Sally Field).She swallows the bait and writes a story full of iron clad innuendo implicating Gallagher ,a tale splashed all across the front pages .The story comes close to destroying his life and tragedy follows in its wake. With a contrite Megan as ally -she and Gallagher having become romantically involved-he decides to strike back at the people who have so cavalierly treated him and his family .

The work raises key questions of media responsibility ,and sadly ,fudges them at key points but the movie is still poilished ,literate entertainment which would work well on a double bill with All The President's Men as it is  a counterpart to that movie in some ways While the Bernstein/Woodward movie amounted to a hagiographic portrait of journalists this  tends towards a more jaundiced viewpoint and is for my money the more interesting piece as a result

Performances are uniformly excellent with Balaban especially outstanding .This repays  watching if only for the way it asks us to look at issues of media ethics and mores .It sharply portrays the downside to irresponsible investigative reporting  and corrects the glib Hollywood l notion that journalists are heroes-sometimes ,sure ,but they can do a lot of harm and this movie entertainingly ecposes this aspect to the fourth estate.",1194134400,4,1903,5.116129032258065

The dialog between Gallagher, (Newman), and Carter, (Field), is pointed, dynamic and, frankly, brilliant, but it shouldn't be happening in the bedroom. It doesn't make any sense. The quirky Elliot Rosen, (played brilliantly by Bob Balaban) is the engine driving this bus off a cliff. To Wit:

FBI Agent Eddie Frost (Arnie Ross):  What the hell's going on?

Elliott Rosen (Balaban):  Good question. You oughta join the FBI. I don't know either.

Frost:  It doesn't make any sense.

Rosen:  Got any ideas?

Frost:  Sure, early retirement.

Rosen:  I got a couple. I want 24 hour surveillance on Gallagher, not close. And I want taps on three phones; Gallagher's warehouse, Gallagher @ home..., Quinn's house.

Frost:  Wait a minute. Where are we going to find a judge who'll let us tap Quinn?

Rosen:  I'm not gonna ask a judge.

Frost:  It's no good in court.

Rosen:  I'm not in court. Not yet.

Frost:  You really think Gallagher bought him.

Rosen:  I don't know. You think he's for sale?

There is really no need to rehash some of the other things said in the previous reviews. I certainly agree with all the kudos for Wilford Brimley. His performance became the initial reason why I fell in love with this movie. The repeat viewings have shown me that it is hard to find bad acting in this movie.

You always know that a director has done a great job when he can take characters with limited screen time and still cause us to know what they are feeling and thinking. Pollack does this masterfully with DA Quinn (Hood), Uncle Santos (Adler), and Editor McAdam (Sommer).

I did have 2 problems with the film after the first couple viewings but have since made peace concerning them. First, I really didn't like the Teresa Perrone character played flawlessly by Melinda Dillon. I didn't buy the relationship between her and Gallagher (Newman) but I guess if she had been his sister or his ex-wife then the revenge plot he charted with his uncle would have taken a different course.

I also initially didn't like the casting of Sally Field in the lead. I felt the same way a fews years ago when Meg Ryan tried to pull off Proof Of Life. If you needed cute then Sally Field was your huckleberry but this role needed a little more street cred. The problem I had was who else could you have cast? Streep was even younger then Fields at the time. I'm not a huge Faye Dunaway fan but she probably would have been a better fit. But, I will have to admit that Ms Field never looked better then when she was standing on the dock in the closing scene with Paul Newman.

One last note. I wonder if Bob Balaban, who since has been great in the Christopher Guest trilogy of films and the TV show Seinfeld, kept the rubber band that he kept spinning around in this movie. It was a very effective prop in moving forward his career.",1148688000,19,2035,4.387267904509284

Newman is a wonderful actor. I see him and whether it's 'Cool Hand' or Frank Galvin (""Verdict"") or here Michael Gallagher, I think of the greatest praise for books that don't waste your time, ""economy."" And Newman always has economy of motion and  economy of speech. Nothing is wasted.

Here Sydney Pollack (have you seen this guy's resume? Just the movies CURRENTLY filming or in post production) wrestles with the conscience of the press. And what a great time to see this movie again.

Mike Gallagher is a liquor distributor whose father was a gangster. But Mike isn't. Sally Field is a stoolie so to speak for a mafia criminal syndicate indicting Miami prosecutor (Bob Balaban). She crucifies Newman with a story on gang connections, of which the facts are accurate but the story untrue.

An interesting observation on the power of the press. That she does so is based upon the judicial immunity of the press if one writes with 'an absence of malice.' Always good. We missed the power of Ms. Field, probably overlooked in the memories of the flying nun (See 'Norma Rae').

But the film really lacks any type of energy.  I felt like falling asleep during most of it; the romance between Field and Newman is ridiculous and should've been removed from the movie; also, there really is no final climatic scene.  The best scene is of Newman's gal pal shamefully removing the newspapers from the neighborhood.  Very heartbreaking.

But, I give Pollack credit for taking on this subject, especially after all of us were taught in the mid to late 70s that journalists were the ultimate ""guardians of the truth,"" who were only out for the public good (thanks to Woodward & Bernstein).

His dispensing of penalties, options and opinions in the wake of the ""tag; you're it"" game that everyone else was playing is masterful.  It's almost too bad the film didn't end there because the rest is unimpressive in comparison.

29247,4,0767804325,"A newspaper reporter (Sally Field) does a story on what appears to be a federal strike force investigation of a man (Paul Newman) who once had ties with the Mafia. Only it's not true, and after the published story has dire affects on Newman's life, he seeks revenge. The theme is about the responsibility the press has to not just print anything it wants and use words like ""alleged"" and ""sources said"" to protect itself. Newman does an excellent job, as usual, though Field is not strong enough as an actress to do her part very well. The very end (after Newman has made monkeys out of Field and others on the paper) is a bummer, too, with Newman picking up stakes and moving on, as if this little episode was all he had to do in Miami, the movie's setting: hero riding off into the sunset syndrome here. The movie presents a good, complex story, though - well paced and, except for Field, well acted by all involved. Definitely worth a watch.",1113177600,,944,4.46242774566474
29248,3,0767804325,"The movie is an OK exercise in First Amendment privileges and the power of the press to ruin innocent people's lives, but basically it turns a yawn-making subject into a Florida travelogue that rivals MIAMI VICE and De Palma's SCARFACE for imaginative use of Florida locations.

Sally Field and Paul Newman make an uneasy match together.  The truth is that, at 55, he is a wee bit too old for her and might well have played her father.  She isn't looking good either, but I give her credit for taking a part which isn't entirely sympathetic, for she could have traded on her lovability factor (""You like me!"") for years without wandering into the heavy waters of something like ABSENCE OF MALICE.  Paul Newman has a role made for him, down to the twist ""Sting"" ending which will remind you of a dozen other movies he made over the years (and continues to make, God bless him).  --Such as THE VERDICT or BUTCH CASSIDY.

With his frosty blue eyes I can see him playing an Irishman, though it's a stretch.  This is right around the period where his screen persona began to go over the top, from leading man to full-on legend, and he hasn't really aged since.  Eighty this year, Newman remains one of our favorite leading men, but ABSENCE OF MALICE doesn't really do anything for him one way or the other.  Melinda Dillon, whose career really should have been a big one, shows a lot of restrained power here, but nothing that suggests that she and Sally Field should have switched roles as was whispered back during the original release of this movie.",1109289600,2,1547,4.576086956521739
29249,4,0767804325,"Absence of Malice is one of my all-time favorites, and the first ""older"" movie that I grabbed when it was finally released on DVD.  In my opinion this is one film that should be required viewing for every journalism major in the USA.

Hollywood movies very rarely criticize the press (except those deemed too far to the right politically), so this film was in an exclusive category from the beginning. The powerful story and the restrained, polished performances from its excellent cast carry as big of a punch now as they did a quarter-century ago when the film was first released.  Paul Newman seems tailor-made for his role as the adult son of a famous mob figure, and Sally Fields is her typical annoying self as the headline-seeking thirtyish reporter who is fed an untrue story about Newman's character by a conniving federal investigator (Bob Balaban, who's very effective in the bad-guy role) and runs with it, setting off a chain of events that eventually wrecks several people's lives, including her own.

The supporting cast is uniformly excellent: Melinda Dillon in a rare dramatic role as Newman's sweet, mentally slow sister who unwittingly reveals her darkest secret to the world by talking to Fields; Balaban's obsessive intensity makes you think he's actually in more scenes than he is; and Wilford Brimley as Balaban's boss almost steals the show when he rides into town to clean up the mess.  It is Brimley's scenes as the Asst. U.S. Attorney (with that nice country drawl) that brings the movie's tension to its ultimate climax, and justice is finally done, although it's too little, too late for most of the characters.

I think this film was misunderstood by many who saw it back in 1981 because the majority of the public at that time still held the mainstream media and its minions in high regard.  The scene where Brimley responds to the newspaper's lawyer, who invokes the First Amendment when Fields is pressed about her sources, shocked many viewers at that time and probably still does even today:  ""The First Amdendment doesn't say that, counselor...the privilege [protecting a source] doesn't exist."" This concept was at the very heart of movies like All the President's Men (Who was ""Deep Throat""?), and Brimley shoots it down in 5 seconds.

The ultimate point of the movie, that publicity can destroy innocent people's lives, was not as well understood in the early 80's as it is today.  Field's proud reporter and her equally-arrogant editor weren't evil, just selfish and sloppy.  Nor is Field's character stupid; she just never stopped to think that Balaban's unscrupulous investigator was using her for his own ends because she was focused on making her deadline. (There's subtle hints of ageism when her boss tells her ""You'd make a fine editor"" and Fields snaps back ""I'm not over the hill yet!"" while glancing at the twentyish blond reporter nearby, knowing that this woman is her replacement.)

This film is rich in subtleties and textures that can only be enjoyed after repeated viewings.  The fact that Newman's quiet ""everyman"" hero finally sets up everyone else for their inevitable fall, then gets to watch the implosion first-hand, is merely icing on a very rich and tasty cake.  I urge anyone who's never seen this film to buy it today!  You won't be sorry.",1107388800,4,3305,4.908438061041292
29250,4,0767804325,"If you enjoy watching films in which arrogant people get their comeuppance, you might enjoy this one.

Paul Newman deftly shows how an astute, calculating ""avenger"" can turn the tables on those who have hurt his business and a dear friend.  Sally Fields gives a credible performance as a self-absorbed, ""champion of truth"" journalist who's oblivious to the impact of her stories on people's lives and livelihood.  Wilford Brimley is at his best when he ""reads the riot act"" to each one of the ""culprits"" in the climactic confrontation scene, and, in doing so, ties together the loose ends of the film's storyline.

While the movie lacks the action (and pace) of many popular films today, it rewards the thoughtful, patient viewer who appreciates watching a carefully executed revenge.  It's one of my all-time favorites.  I've seen this film about a half dozen times over a period of years and still enjoy it as much today as I did when I first saw it on the big screen.",1101168000,,970,4.744047619047619
29251,4,0767804325,"If Woodward & Bernstein brought down the Imperial Presidency of Richard Nixon by exposing Watergate, which is arguably a good thing, then it introduced the era of ""Gotcha"" journalism.  The press in this country is considered the fourth estate and it certainly has started acting like another branch of the government with the key difference that nobody checks or balances it.  In ""Absence of Malice,"" Sydney Pollack's indictment of the power of the press in the modern era, one man is given good reason to fight the system.

Michael Colin Gallagher (Paul Newman) is the son of a Mafia boss, long dead, who know owns and runs a liquor warehouse.  He knows nothing about anything, but Elliott Rosen (Bob Balaban), the leader of a Justice Department Strike Force who is getting nowhere in southern Florida, leaks a fake story that Gallagher is the subject of an investigation.  Smelling blood in the water, reporter Megan Carter (Sally Field) goes after the story that is not really there.  Gallagher's life is exposed to the world and as the story that is not there grows it destroys the life of an innocent, Teresa Perrone (Melinda Dillon).  At that point Gallagher concocts a plan to bring down everybody, simply by letting them do exactly what they want to do in a nice example of how to give a lot of people enough rope to hang themselves.

Unfortunately there the script requires Newman and Field to go through the motions for one of the more unbelievable romances in movie history, which only gets in the way of the focus of the story.  You can never believe that she sees him as anything more than a story any more than you can accept that he is able to look past what she is trying to do to see a woman worth loving.  Certainly that set up is not necessary for the powerful scene where Gallagher lays hands on Carter to show her exactly how many damage a human being writing a story on a computer can do to another person.  But even then, the script asks us to believe that the spark between these two has not been wholly extinguished, and that is not something I can do.

But ""Absence of Malice"" is more than saved by the film's final scene where Gallagher's trap succeeds brilliantly and Wilford Brimley shows up as Asst. U.S. Atty. Gen. James A. Wells to put the pieces together and dispense a little judicial justice.  Carter does too little too late in terms of trying to do something noble, but we are given to believe that she has learned her lesson, although I would certainly like more evidence than this.  But even if she goes straight there are plenty of other reporters willing to play the game knowing that they will rarely be held accountable or have to play for any mistakes that they make.  This is a depressing film, not just because it tells a depressing story, but because the grim reality it portrays of how the press functions in this country is distressingly true.

""Absence of Malice"" received Oscar nominations for Paul Newman as Best Actor in a Leading Role, although his solid performance is nothing special, and for Melinda Dillon as Best Actress in a Supporting Role as the most memorable character in the film.  The scene in which she tries to hide from her family the fact that her name and life are being tossed around on the front page of the newspaper is both chilling and heartbreaking.  Kurt Luedtke was nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and except for the unnecessary and problematic romantic subplot there is plenty of gravity to the story and scenes.  Watching this movie again makes me think that the time has come for somebody to go after the state of journalism today and use something more pointed that the stiletto Pollack employs in this 1981 film.",1094083200,43,3735,4.640364188163884
29252,4,0767804325,"Not quite a star-studded flick, but chock full of subtly forceful personalities.  Paul Newman plays Gallagher, a crusty but otherwise legit Florida-based liquor wholesaler whose life is turned upside-down when the Miami Standard fingers him as a possible material witness.  Under current laws regarding libel, Newman can always sue the paper for libel.  However, the law sets a higher standard of wrongdoing to be proven when the victim is a public-figure.  (The distinction was meant to prevent public officials from using libel laws to block any criticism of their actions - most notably in the case of southern police officials during the early civil-rights years; unfortunately for Gallagher, the laws have been expanded to cover any figure in the public eye, whether he's there by choice or despite it.)  Because the Standard acts without malice, and only reports what's been leaked to it by a shifty DoJ official (Bob Balaban), the fact that the story itself is actually incorrect is irrelevant.  While DoJ hopes to pressure Gallagher to turn state's evidence, or somehow lead them to somebody who can, the newspaper hopes Gallagher will come forward and give his own spin.  (Exaggeration is an often-used media tactic - one hoped to pressure a story's subject to reflexively come forward and give a story that, while less spectacular, is nonetheless worse off now that it's been confirmed.)  While Gallagher comes forward, and hooks up with Sally Field as the Standard's ace reporter, he soon finds another way to wreak havoc - by turning his enemies against each other.
There's something satisfying about the deceptive ease with which Gallagher turns the media against itself, but the resolution is unsatisfying.  Wilford Brimley plays the Assistant Attorney General who gets everybody honest by threatening to make people talk under oath.  (We get the point, people have no problem saying anything as long as they don't have to stand by it.)  The last scene is essentially Brimley's one-man show, one that upstages Sally Fields's character's turn-about: rather than disclose Gallagher as the source of her latest story, she's willing to take the fall for him.  Her logic is impeccable - somebody is going to take the blame and the fall no matter what.  Why not her?  If anything, the film disappoints in underplaying the attraction between the two, which only makes you wonder whether her denouement is one of journalistic integrity or love.  Instead, we cheer that Brimley will get to tell the media what he thinks (and nobody in this room is going to like what I have to say, he warns) and the way he exacts retribution (you're no White House appointee, he tells Balaban's character.  ""The one who hired you, is me."" Start packing).",1061337600,5,2743,5.035398230088496
29253,4,0767804325,"When you watch the theatrical trailer of ABSENCE OF MALICE, you are lead to think that this movie describes Paul Newman's revenge and will contain a lot of violent scenes. This is not true. In fact, has a trailer ever described accurately a movie ?
ABSENCE OF MALICE is, in the first place, an ""actor"" movie, with two stars of 1981 : Paul Newman and Sally Field. The secondary roles are also well written and interesting. The movie belongs to the category of moral movies and tries to defend these two ideas :
- Things and people are not always what or who they seem to be.
- The newspapers should have the duty to verify their sources before printing anything.
The treatment of the subject is well done, the screenplay being sometimes too weak. But Sydney Pollack, with this material, was able to present a conventional but still watchable movie.

29254,4,0767804325,"One of the worries of  journalists everywhere is to keep an protect the source. The source is where all the information comes from. Once you've got a source another point comes up: how reliable this person is. It is very easy to anyone go to a reporter tell something -- that's not necesseraly true -- and his/her statement is published. So a good professional would surely investigate and print the news once it is proved to be true. But this can happen only in a ideal world. Let's face the truth: journalist do not have too much time to comfirm or deny informations. Nowadays with the internet, the readers want new news all the time and the fight for the click has shorted the deadlines.
It is in this time of digital press that film made in the 80s' turns out to be very interesting and provocative, due to its timeless subject. Sally Field plays  a reporter of a major Miami's Newspaper who has fallen in a trap. She has no qualms when having the chance to peep a file about a man accused of kidnapping and killing a working class leader. Moreover, she gets involved with this man who in the end happens to be her reliable source. Telling more than this would mean give some interesting twists of the movie.
As aforementioned, the movie tackles ethic in journalism, and, let's face it, Sally's character is not that ethical with her sources. She does most of the things that someone expected to be fair and accurate wouldn't do, like not confirming information or publishing off record statements  -- plus she sleeps with her source. Some in-love hearts would justify it saying that love is above everything, but I don't agree. What  kind of professional is she?
Tlaking about the movie itself, it is very entertaining. Sally Field gives a good performance, but who is great as usual is Paul Newman. His perfornance is very subtle and full of nuances. Bob Balaban is terrific and a bit hateful as agent who comes down to be the prime source to Sally's reporter, detonating a sequence of inacuratte reports.
It is impossible to watch this movie and not to rise questions like how accure all the stuff we read in newspapers, magazines, internet is; and also when is an information so important that it has to be published, even when the source asks it to ve off the record. One interesting example would be when a reporter is working on a piece about two guys missing in the sea and a Lt. tells her that there are sharks in the area. But Sally tells her not to mention it in her article, because it may scare turists,  so the solution is to say that is an area with many fishes. Then how true is her piece?
All in all, nowadays, as the press has to be faster, there's less time to check information. So the readers are much more liable to read untrue stories.",1011225600,5,2763,4.49601593625498

Sally Field is as radiant as a Jamaican sunrise as she splashes her acting abilities throughout the movie like a farmer sowing seed in his freshly plowed field!

29258,5,0767804325,"When Sally Field is asked if she was ""involved"" with  suspect Newman she answered that no it was not true but yes it was accurate.  They had been lovers but her  trust was in something ""professional.""  Or was it  ambition? Her trust was not in her new friend.

Sally, as a reporter who wanted to get ahead, was bent on getting ""a story.""  Newman, in an effort to get some help against what was media harrassment, invites Sally to lunch.  This turns into a budding romance or at least friendship.  But when ""new evidence"" comes in against Newman she chooses to go after the story once again.

Newman managed to set up the local Federal and State prosecutors AND the local newspapers, for a publicity embarrassment. It worked.  Sally believed her ""sources"" rather than Newman. She couldn't rise above her ""professionalism"" to believe a friend.  She, too, became caught in an embarrassing trap.

The Trap is snapped shut by Wilford Brimley, playing an Assistant Attorney General of the US.  Brimley's handling of the climatic face to face meeting of the various parties involved is a cinema delight not to be missed.

The movie tells something meaningful about our media dominated world view today.  Our vulnerability to official and media harassment was well defined, for me, by this story.
