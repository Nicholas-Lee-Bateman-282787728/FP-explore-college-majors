1667375,5,B00005UQEK,"I love this Disney movie, and so do my young daughters.  We laughed and laughed as Kyle's luck turned from good to bad... and he begins turning into a leprechaun - all because his ""lucky charm"" is stolen.
The movie brings up an important subject of family heritage... something that we all have.  Kyle is not interested in anything of his own until he believes his parents are hiding it from him... with that and his sudden bad luck and the physical changes his mother and him take on... Kyle is the answer to preserving that history, and saving his good fortune of being an American.
At the end of the movie, you will want to stand up and sing along with the final song.  This is a warm, feel-good, family movie... good for kids of all ages, and a great way to get your children interested in their own family heritage.",1014940800,10,820,4.381578947368421
1667376,2,B00005UQEK,"This movie does have its redeeming qualities.  It's a cute concept, and kids will eat it up.  It does tend to take Irish culture and ""cute"" it up - using all of the corny usuals - but that's Disney! ;)  And even though some of the accents could use work, it's not that bad.  I taped it off of Disney, so it's not worth buying to me, so I couldn't speak on it's worth.  The worst part of it was the dancing - ack!  I couldn't stand it.  Outside of the troupe dancers at the faire, the rest of the cast couldn't dance to save their souls.  It looks more like bad tap dancing mixed with Lord of the Dance than Irish dancing.
So to end, it IS a cute movie - and even fun for those Irish culture nitpicks out there like me (we'll have a field day with it)!  But Ryan Merriman and Seamus (that actor is now in Judging Amy and will forever look like a leprechaun to me) is in DIRE need of dance lessons.",1012089600,,896,3.9608938547486034
1667377,5,B00005UQEK,"The Luck of the Irish is probably one of the best movies I have seen. :) I started watching it with the expectation of a good movie, but I soon discovered that it was a ""wee bit"" more than that. I was greatly impressed by the story and the acting, I also really enjoyed the Irish step dancing. I recommend this to anyone, believe me, it's grand altogether. :)",1011398400,,359,4.217391304347826
1667378,5,B00005UQEK,"I watched this movie without any expectation on Disney channel.
After watching it, I was like
""Wooooow! Awesome!""(with opened mouth)
This movie gave me lots of things like precept..and of course
a great pleasure! This is not just for children, parents or other adult can watch together and ENJOY it!
The first song or can be last song that hero and heroine sang together would be unforgettable because their harmony are so beautiful. In addition, the hero's tap dancing was perfect! I recommend this movie as one of people who watched
this great movie or you'll miss treasure.",1010188800,,576,4.887755102040816

The Luck of the Irish was one of them. I adored this as a kid, and I was absolutely astonished that this and many of my other favorites were available for purchase as well (The Thirteenth Year, Can of Worms, Smart House, etc.) Definitely worth what it costs, and great if you love Henry Gibson, who plays an adorably charming leprechaun grandfather.",1463702400,10,501,4.516483516483516

This movie is inaccurate in a lot of ways with the culture and accents, but it's not supposed to be a documentary or historical film.

1667620,5,B00005UQEK,"I first saw this movie in 2001, when it was produced for the Disney Channel.  ST. Patty's Day was on the weekend that year, and it was raining.  My little brother and I (17 at the time) were home alone, fell in love with this movie, and watched it twice more that weekend.  Ever since, we watch to try and catch it every year.  Now, we don't have to.
True, this follows typical Disney Channel Original Movie Style, sometimes seeming overacted or cheesy.  But for the most part, it makes for an extremely culturally informative and fun adventure the whole family can enjoy, or at least appreciate.",1082332800,,596,4.5327102803738315
1667621,1,B00005UQEK,"But not because it was good, but because it's terrible. it's terribly innaccurate, barely paying lip service to Irish culture, instead having a bizare mix of Irish & Scottish culture, and unusually accents too! It's the very epitome of the hi-diddly-i Oirishness that you see, and is pretty insulting to anyone who's Irish.
If you don't care about accurracy, cheese, good dialogue or acting then watch this film. So it's probably fine if you're 4",1073347200,4,446,4.96

Well, I guess you may or may not know where your family came to the United Centers from, but then if you learn about where you family came from, where you and your luck start to change. In this movie it does happen. Kyle Johnson (Ryan Merriman) is a junior high school student, that does not know where his family came from. His mom (Marita Geraghty) and Dad (Paul Kiernan) doesn't give him any information on the famliy's history, and the only thing they share with him is that he is They are from Cleveland. Kyle has special taletns, like guessing on a test, turning in in and getting it right and touch the net on the basketball hoop. One morning, Kyle wakes up and finds his mom not only talking Irish, but also making Irish food. Now if don't think it can get bad enough, check out the movie to watch what happens, to Kyle and his Mom. I reccomend this movie to you if you are Irish, or Irish at heart.",1047945600,3,1043,4.2462311557788945
1667623,5,B00005UQEK,"This is a great movie for those who are proud of their Irish Heritage!
I've always enjoy a good 'Wee Folk' movie...and I rank this with my other fav of Irish Disney, ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"". Sean Connery doesn't sing in this one..or even appear in it but this, ""Luck of the Irish"", is a great flick; 'bout a teen-age learning about his Irish heritage...
