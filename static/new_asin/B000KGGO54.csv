8494822,5,B000KGGO54,"I'm a huge fan of What Not To Wear. With the show having gone off the air, I'm now monthly buying on Amazon episodes from the first four seasons that I've never seen (which technically means the show hasn't ended for me ... woot, woot!)
Anyone reading any WNTW review I do should know:
1) I'm only doing these reviews to give the ep 5 stars; I will give EVERY ep 5 stars as a nod to the general greatness of WNTW. I admit it, I'm biased. (But really, if the knowledge, fun, and drama aren't enough, the brilliance and wit of Stacy and Clinton push every ep to a 5 anyway!)
2) While I don't have time for big writeups on each DVD, a few observations: I go into every WNTW ep knowing THAT Stacy and Clinton will win, I just don't know exactly HOW. A third of the way in, Susan the teacher is telling us she is so completely and passionately devoted to her young students, she isn't sure fashion is important at all. This is so sincere (and admirable) that I think, ""Hmmm, maybe this one can't be reached."" But, as a lot of great lines are thrown out on both sides, Stacy and Clinton work their magic, with Susan two thirds of the way in admitting she can still do her job AND present herself better. A quick and decisive triumph for the dynamic duo. Which was good, because I can never unsee Susan's ""before"" cutoff shorts/tube socks outfit, and didn't want that to be my lasting impression of her. Instead, it was of her looking gorgeous in cute and totally appropriate clothes during the reveals. An excellent ep, and if I recall from one of the specials later in the show's run, she kept up her look!
3) However, I would be remiss if I didn't again mention the cost ... $19.95 per ep? WTF! I am a big enough fan of the show, and have the resources, to buy them. But do I see anybody else purchasing them? Probably not. Yet if you do spring for this ep you certainly will enjoy it.
