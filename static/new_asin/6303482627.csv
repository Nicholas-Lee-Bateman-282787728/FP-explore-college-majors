661149,4,6303482627,"The sixth Doctor era is one that is often criticised by Doctor Who fans, and this criticism is justified in my opinion. The majority of the stories starring Colin Baker ranged from mediocre to poor, with the exception of Revelation Of The Daleks and this story.
Vengeance On Varos is a story that is more relevant now than it was when it was first broadcast due to the current glut of reality tv shows that clog the airwaves. These two episodes show a populace that gets to vote on government policy through interactive television broadcasts. Rather than a simple yes or no vote, the voting involves torture of the Governor which the population gets to watch. They also get to see public torturing and executions of ""terrorists"" as part of their daily intake of television ""entertainment"". This satire of television and government rings all the more true as time goes by.
The sixth Doctor is still rather an unlikeable character here at times, only a few stories into his era which was cut abruptly short when Colin Baker was sacked after his final story, The Trial Of A Time Lord. At the beginning of the story, he is still exhibiting the mood swings seen in his first story which makes it difficult for the audience to be won over by this particular incarnation of the Time Lord. Tom Bakers Doctor was also prone to black moods, but the sixth Doctor comes across at times as a petulant and whiny child. This is not a fault that can be levelled solely at the actor as the character was shaped by the producer, script editor (who was later quite vocal about his dislike of this era of the program) and writers.
The DVD itself is another excellent piece of work from the Restoration Team. The picture and sound are excellent. The various special features are entertaining and informative, especially the commentary track by Colin Baker, Nicola Bryant and Nabil Shaban who plays the stories villain Sil. It's a very funny and cheeky chat that's well worth a listen.
Apparently this is the lowest selling Doctor Who DVD in the UK, but it's certainly a story that stands the test of time and definitely worth your time and money. If nothing else, the story may make you think more about the society we live in and that's no bad thing.",1067299200,8,2230,4.619647355163728
661150,5,6303482627,"Like numerous other episodes of Doctor Who, this is an act of time meddling itself: the prison industrial complex, the society of people whose minds are distorted by mandatory TV watching, the encouraging of people to spy no their friends and neighbors, the blanket labeling of enemies of the state as ""terrorists"", the true and disturbing nature of reality-TV, the exploitation by mining companies, and a ""Governor"" who is tortured in referendum after referendum.  See the amazing likeness of the ""Governor"" to Governor Gray Davis.  It doesn't stop there.  See if you can spot all of the messages which were sent back just this morning on September 26, 2003.",1064534400,2,659,5.027522935779817
661151,4,6303482627,"""Carnival of Monsters"" of the 80s? Well, maybe not, but there are similarities. Both serials make fun of TV and its' viewers. But Vengeance's action is more violent and graphic(canabilism and acid baths)compared to the Bob Holmes classic. though, far from being a classic, Vengeance on Varos is a strong argument for exposing the media's hold over its' audience, and some of the scenes presented and executed paralel it's own fan base. There is a lot voyeurism and violent themes throughtout, but it is written and performed rather well. Sil is a wonderful addition to Who's greatest villians.
The painstaking work the Doctor Who Restoration Team did on this release and any other is top notch. The extras included are a wonderful bonus.",1059350400,,737,5.0
661152,4,6303482627,"Controversial at that time of it's broadcast, Vengence on Varos is nonetheless a superior episode from Colin Baker's era. Although the violence in this episode is more than what one would expect from a typical episode in the series, it's used to demonstrate how violence has indeed become entertainment for many of us. Doctor Who rarely ventures into editorial satire, but it works well here.
High points for this episode include Colin Baker's reserved performance, a welcome change from the manic proceedings that opened his tenure as the Doctor. The dialogue is, on the whole, strong with a few embarassing moments. Nabil Shabon's portrayal of Sil is delightfully over-the-top, providing some much needed humor in an otherwise dour environment. Finally, the Doctor Who Restoration Team have provided a treasure chest of extras and, as always, done a great job making this episode look as good as it will ever get.
By no means an essential episode, this is nevertheless a better example of Colin Baker's era and a good buy.",1052611200,2,1024,5.029411764705882

The story is an ok one, more relevant now, perhaps, than it was when it was first aired.  The character of Sil is always fun to see, and the other roles were well done as well.  There was just a little something missing, and I don't quite know what.

As for the extras on the DVD, well... they could have been better.  I was a little disapointed in compairison to the other Doctor Who DVDs I own.  The behind the scenes section was a joke, as were the outtakes (hint to the BBC:  Pick ones that are funny).  The text commentary, normally very informative and verbose, was surprisingly sparse on this episode.

On the plus side, the audio commentary is nicely done, and the trailers are fun to see.  And the expanded/deleted scenes were really interesting.

661154,3,6303482627,"""Vengeance on Varos"" is one of ""Doctor Who""'s more controversial stories.  Taken from Season 22, right before the show got cancelled (albeit briefly), it's unusually dark and violent.  This was at the beginning of the short-lived Colin Baker 6th Doctor era, whose darker take on the title role caused some audience acceptance problems.  ""Varos"" is then a worthwhile choice for the first 6th Doctor story to be released on DVD, while not the best story available.
Given the ""Restoration Team"" treatment, ""Varos"" is notably lacking in the care and attention given to the extra features that made, for example, ""Aztecs"" and ""Caves of Androzani"" such outstanding DVD acquisitions.  There are no production featurettes here, no behind-the-scenes interviews with cast members or the production crew.  3 features simply dump raw video footage without any explanation.  The ""outtakes"" and the ""behind-the-scenes featurette"" basically show the same thing... aborted takes with a PA calling cast members ""darling"" and ""love"" a lot.  The extended/deleted scenes montage, while satisfyingly long (10 minutes), doesn't offer any context to those scenes would have fit into the story, as was done on the far more professional ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" presentation.  Baffingly, one audio tracks allows you to watch the complete episode... without incidental music or sound effects.  I'm not sure who would sit through 90 minutes of this.
Fortunately, the audio commentary track is well above-average.  Many DW stories are narrated by aging cast members who barely remember their time on the show; not here.  Colin Baker is well-versed in his character's mythology, and is able to walk the audience through the particularly controversial scene in which the Doctor seemingly shoves a security guard into a vat of boiling acid.  From a production standpoint, he attempts to explain why this scene isn't as bad as it appears.  Nicola Bryant (Peri) doesn't say much (and she didn't on the ""Caves of Androzani"" DVD either), but Nabil Shaban (Sil, an anatomically-correct slug sitting on a fishtank) shows himself to be a real ""Doctor Who"" fan, and tells some funny on-the-set stories as well (such as the time when, in costume, he was mistaken for an inanimate prop!).  Both Baker and Shaban together may come across a bit smug, as they deride ""reality TV"" and ""post-Thatcherite economics"", but they both provide excellent, funny context for the story.  ""Varos"" becomes one of the few DW DVDs so far with an audio commentary worth playing more than once.
James Bond fans who purchase the disc will be interested to note that ""Varos"" marks the TV debut of Jason Connery, son of Sean.  He doesn't have a whole lot to do here -- he plays a no-nonsense rebel who goes shirtless most of the way -- but it's interesting to note that his chest is nearly as hairy as his dad's.",1049068800,4,2851,5.05982905982906
661155,4,6303482627,"The second adventure of Colin Baker's first spectacular season as Doctor Who is, as a whole, breathtaking.
The plot is centered around Varos:  A planet originally set up as a penal colony, but grew to be a planet of its  own accord.  Problem is, its citizens are treated like prisoners by the  government.  They are forced to mine for slave wages and rations and those  who rule live in power.  And to keep the citizens quiet, forms of  punishment are broadcast live or taped.  There is a third party, Sil,  manipulating events to gain more wealth for himself...
A great story and  frighteningly ahead of its time, considering how TV is like these days, yet  criticized unfairly and wrongfully for being violent.
The story itself is  well-written, excellently paced, daring, and best of all are the  shakespearean concepts such as a character talking *to* the camera to help  convey the plot along and the characters of Etta and Arak who are showing  we, the viewers, how they live - they are the citizens and we get to see  how the citizens live along with the other events which in turn makes this  story extremely well-rounded and multi-dimensional.
But the only  problem is with the acting - solely by Jason Connery (yes, Sean's son and  proves he's as much of an actor as daddy).  Jason comes across as a  mannequin at many times, as does his 'girlfriend' (played by Geraldine  Alexander), and it's a shame since everybody else, particularly Martin  Jarvis and Forbes Collins steal the show.
Still, I'm being harsh.  There  are far worse actors out there and their acting could have been worse.  The  story is indeed a classic and proves that Colin Baker's era is not devoid  of compassion and morals as one might think.  (they're merely presented in  an unconventional point of view)",963532800,12,1789,4.748366013071895

Unfortunately, the same elements that made  this episode (and season) great were the same things that outraged certain  moral majority groups that kept complaining in our childrens ""best  interests"".

661283,5,6303482627,"This story is one of the best dystopian Doctor Who stories (in the same league as the Sun Makers) as it features the Doctor and Peri landing on a former prison colony that's still run by the descendants of its former guards and the government stays in power through corruption and by selling torture as entertainment.

It's a great cautionary tale that ages well because it was so far ahead of its time, before the start of the age of reality shows and right at the beginning of the rise of trashy American shows that made people's misery fodder. It's bleak and unlike in other stories, the cheap sets actually serve the story and to establish the poverty of the planet, and the hopeless of the situation.

The story had some great performances Martin Jarvis is such a great performer as the Governor, giving a performance that makes his sympathetic but not entirely moral. His scene where he speaks to the guard before Episode 2 is one of the more powerful guest performances in Doctor Who.

The Doctor's role in this is controversial. The moments in the TARDIS establish that despite his bluster, this Doctor is flawed particularly when it comes to basic TARDIS stuff, but in this story, the Sixth Doctor establishes he isn't someone you mess around with. The Doctor shoots weapons, sets up deadly booby traps, and delivers James Bondesque quips when two guards stumble into a vat of acid. He's resourceful, courageous, and resolute. While he does use violence, it's never gratuitous or unjustified, but it is decisive.

While I love the performance, I can understand why so many people got upset, as this really isn't family viewing in the mold of prior season, and the Doctor is so changed from say the the Fourth Doctor who forbid Leela from killing even in self-defense. Though, compared to some actions in the new series, I think this isn't all that shocking considering events like the 11th Doctor leaving a space pirate to die when he could have saved him because the pirate was an evil man.

I said this is in the same league as the Sun Makers in terms of dystopia and it's a pretty even match. The Sun Makers had a better companion and better locations. This has a better guest villain in Sil, as well as a more realistic scenario, plus a couple of other great guest performances.

In the end, this is a fantastic episode that showcases the strengths of the Sixth Doctor.",1426377600,,2382,4.65952380952381

661375,5,6303482627,"The TARDIS is having big problems, and the Doctor's attempts to fix it are making it worse. He's managed to set a couple electrical fires, and even burned Perpugilliam ""Peri"" Brown's supper. Then the TARDIS stalls, just like a car, in the middle of deep space (does deep space have a middle?).

In the meanwhile, we're seeing the disturbing happenings on the planet of Varos. First we see it through the eyes of  Arak and Etta. In their cell-like living room, they complain about the food shortages and watch a big screen live broadcast of the torture of a rebel. These broadcasts are what passes for entertainment for them now. Just like in late ancient Rome, where the gladiatorial games helped keep the populace happy in spite of food shortages.

From a different viewpoint, we see the machinations behind the scene, and they are ugly. The Varos Governor (played with stoic integrity by Martin Jarvis) is in negotiations with Sil, the Mentor representative of Galatron Mining Corporation. The Corporation mines the metal Zeiton-7 on Varos. An almost worthless ore, Sil reminds the Governor, and they are doing Varos a favor to even bother at all. But the Governor holds out for a higher price.

Unfortunately for the Governor, his boss, the Chief Officer, is in cahoots with Sil. The Chief Officer sets a mandatory vote for that night. Is the Governor correct in holding out for a higher price?  Every Varosian must vote by pressing one of two colored buttons on the wall next to their TV. When the Governor loses the vote, the whole planet watches him tortured in the Human Cell Disintegration Bombardment machine (HCDB).

Back to the Doctor (Colin Baker) where he tells Peri he's figured out what's wrong with the TARDIS. It needs Zeiton-7, an exceptionally rare metal that is found on only one planet: Varos. Exceptionally rare and valuable? The TARDIS manages to limp over to Varos, lands near the stage for torture entertainment, and the fun begins.

This episode is so well done. Sil, played with sibilant arrogance by Nabil Shaban, is a perfect bad guy. Eeeew, you just want to pour salt on him!

What I find interesting is that Varos is far ahead of Earth in scientific ways (it's supposed to take place in the 23rd century). They have HCDB which kills from the inside. They have a Punishment Dome where you can be made to believe you are thirsting to death in a desert, when you're really in an empty hallway. They have alien contact and do not think they are alone in the universe. And yet, they are prey to not just the same emotions, but the same situations that have bedeviled humans forever.

""Vengeance on Varos"" first aired in January 1985, as two 45-minute episodes. The first U.S. DVD release was in 2002, a 1-disc release. This review is for the ""Special Edition"", available September 2012. It will have 2 discs and digitally remastered picture and mono sound quality.

This is what I've found for the list of extras for the 2012 Special Edition:

1.  Commentary. This the same commentary as on the 2002 DVD release. Commenters include Colin Baker (The Doctor), Nicola Bryant (Peri), and Nabil Shaban (Sil). The three commenters get along well and there's lots of humor - definitely not dull. When the show gets to the acid bath scene (see extra #5), Baker, in his commentary, is adamant that the Doctor was only on the defensive.
2.  ""Nice or Nasty? - The Making of Vengeance on Varos"", a 30 minute short. Commenters include Nabil Shaban (Sil), Sheila Reid (Etta), Philip Martin (writer), Eric Saward (script editor), and Jonathan Gibbs (composer), moderated by Matthew Sweet. The violence of this episode is brought up, and Saward admits that it's his fault. I find this interesting, because I get so caught up in the themes of ""Vengeance on Varos"" that I hardly notice the violence. But again, in England, Dr. Who is a kids' show, so there was more concern.
3.  ""The Idiot's Lantern"", a 7.5 minute short, on ""How Doctor Who has used television"". It's presented by Samira Ahmed, who used to present the news on Channel 4. Both classic and new Doctor Who are covered.
4.  Extended and Deleted Scenes, almost 18 minutes total.
5.  The Acid Bath Scene with alternate music. This is less than two minutes. The acid bath scene in part 2 was controversial with British critics as overly violent, mostly because they thought the Doctor pushed someone in. However, most people, on a closer look, see that the Doctor did not push either worker in.
6.  ""Tomorrow's Times - The Sixth Doctor"", 13 minute featurette. Sarah Sutton talks about media coverage of the Sixth Doctor.
7.  ""Breakfast Time"", a 6 minute BBC TV clip. Frank Bough interviews Colin Baker
8.  ""Saturday Superstore"", a 15 minute BBC TV clip. This is a children's show.
9.  ""French and Saunders"", a 7.5 minute TV clip. This is an unused sketch filmed on The Trial Of a Time Lord set used for Doctor Who's trial. The clip was originally released with the VHS of ""The Curse of Fatal Death"" episode.

661376,4,6303482627,"In the Colin Baker era episode entitled ""Vengeance on Varos"" the Tardis has stopped working and the reason is a vital element called Zeiton-7 that has been depleated. With none within the TARDIS the Doctor makes a risky gamble and travels to Varos but must time it just right to its time when minning was just starting or come to a point too early or to far ahead when the element he needs is gone.  What the Doctor doesn't know is the history of Varos itself.  For those who would mine the planet would be convicts, rebels and prisnoers.  The goverment is lead by the guards who rule the planet and force all of its inhabitants to watch to keep them in line. Burtal shows in which death is the greatest entertainment.
  The governer in charge is currently in negotiaons with an ambassador for the Zeiton-7 ore they mine and since it is in such abundance they will pay next to nothing. What the govenor doesn't know is he is dealing with a being called Sil a Mentor who live for deals and with them always on top.  The govenpr fears for a vote on to give in to the demands of Sil and that means if he fails he may die for all to see. If the people find him right in his way of thinking then he may live.  However everytime a govenor goes through a vote he must subject himself to a weapon that kills slowly and each time he losses a vote it kills that person a little more each time. The current govenor has lived through three votes and many have not lived through a fourth.
  The Doctor stumbles upon a rebel named Jondar who is being kept alive for public torture and free's him.  With his aid he, The Doctor and Peri work there way through the dangerous stuidos to get to the control room. Meanwhile Sil catches wind of the Doctor and fears he is a rival agent sent to make a deal for Zeiton-7 and wants him dead. The captain of the guard is also working with Sil as he wants the current govenor gone so a new one can be nominated and forced to deal with Sil on his terms.
  Can the Doctor and his freinds stop this insanse form of entertainment and get Varos back on track? Can the govenor live to see the people of Varos be taken seriously and live through another vote? Will Sil come out on top and get the deal he wants? You'll have to see to find out in ""Vengeance on Varos"".",1325808000,,2284,4.189497716894977

661429,4,6303482627,"I have seen some of the Sixth Doctors earlier stories. I immediately loved Colin Baker's portrayal as the Doctor. I thought his violent mood swings (sometimes homicidal) as his regeneration trauma was a nice twist against the Doctor's more comedic breakdowns.

But now we come to Vengeance on Varos. The Doctor is a lot more stable, and the story is nicely done. Russell Davies would do something similar to this in the revival series, but his episode doesn't match the sadistic nature of the type of people running throughout this story. Here is episode introduction in a nutshell: The TARDIS needs a certain metal to run properly, so the Doctor and Peri arrive on Varos to obtain such a fuel. But it turns out the world is run on television broadcasts of torture and death. There is more to it, but I won't spoil it for the other Who-nerds. It's not a completely dark story, there is comedy thrown in to lighten the mood. The comedy either comes intentionally from the dialogue, or unintentionally by the props and acting.

This brings me to the acting. Colin Baker does a fantastic job as the Doctor. He makes you believe he is a mad incarnation of the Doctor. His Doctor is very unpredictable in his words and actions. Watching him is the real treat. After watching the Twin Dilemma and Attack of the Cybermen, I expected Peri to constantly whine like child, and therefore annoy the hell out of me. To my surprise I found her quite tolerable here, though the actress who played her still could have taken some acting lessons. Instead of Peri, the character I was most annoyed by was Sil. This little green monster spends his time shouting stupidly and doing this annoying cackle with his tongue. If they had changed Sil's mannerisms, I wouldn't have minded him being there. Nevertheless, this guy is the reason I gave the episode four stars.

To summarize, a good addition for any Doctor Who fan. Dark, funny, violent, and somewhat trippy. The more I watch Colin Baker's Doctor, the more I like him. Possibly my favourite Doctor. I don't care what anyone says, I like his costume! Fits his personality nicely.",1257984000,3,2113,4.705405405405405
661430,5,6303482627,"One of the criticisms leveled against Baker's stint as the Doctor is the level of violence in his serials.  Though this factor is oft repeated as responsible for the series downfall, I find very few people bothered by it,  and many actually in favor of it.  It seems yet another case of the loud few speaking for the many, while the unthinking mindlessly parrot what they heard or read, ""knowing"" that it must be true.  How ironic, then, that this particular story has come to be regarded as the poster child for that complaint.

  Varos is depicted as a depressing world with corroding, claustrophobic hallways that mirror its corrupt society.  Ruled by a disillusioned governor who vainly tries to balance the contradictory goals of doing what must be done for the good of society with what he has to do to appease the uneducated, brain-washed masses in order to retain his governership (sound familiar?), the planet's government uses violent, reality TV shows to distract the working class from pondering too deeply their increasing lack of liberty, deteriorating life-styles, impotence of government to handle important matters, and the fact that leading figures of government come from a few ruling families in spite of its supposed democratic ideals (this last is mentioned only once and never followed up on, sadly, but again, does it sound familiar?).  Enter the Doctor to tangle with the powers-that-be while, against this backdrop, a subplot involving an alien corporation attempting to pirate Varos' economy plays out, a coporation willing to use military force to obtain its commercial ends (does THAT sound familiar?).

  Like ""the Sun-Makers"" and ""the Caves of Androzani"", this one delivers socio-political commentary that may be too frank for those who like their commentary laden with agendas, emotions, and/or ""proper"" thinking. And that is exactly what this serial is about, how the ruling class manipulate an increasingly jaded public with a carrot-and-stick combination of gratuitous entertainment that does double duty as implied threat against those who would be ""subversive"" by thinking improperly (as determined by the rulers). All this is done in the name of ""the People"".

  The cast is excellent, particularly the actor who plays the besieged governor, and the script gives him room enough to be evil as well as good, yet another example of dramatically realistic characterizations prevalent in Doctor Who despite it being a low-budget sci-fi show.  With the subject matter, one probably shouldn't be surprised that media supporters of the status quo were hostile to it.  Yet, despite the bad press, it was apparently one of Colin Baker's most popular serials.

  Though I tend to think the British public just got tired of ever changing doctors and same old ideas continuously repackaged, perhaps it was episodes like these that got the series cancelled.  After all, media moguls and politicians alike suddenly become sensitive to the needs of those voices, however few, that call for what the moguls and politicos wanted to do anyway.  That's listening to ""the People"".  If you don't believe me, just turn on the TV.  They wouldn't lie to you, would they?",1247961600,,3184,5.137864077669903

661432,4,6303482627,"""Vengeance on Varos"" opens up with a couple watching the torture of a young man (Jason Connery).  I guess you could say that they are watching the ultimate reality television show.  They're on the planet Varos, which just happens to be the only place where the good Doctor (Colin Baker) can find Zeiton-7, a rare mineral that's key to much needed repairs on the Doctor's TARDIS.  When the Doctor and Peri (the always lovely Nicola Bryant) arrive, they immediately fall into a big bit of trouble.  They free the young man who's being tortured for Varos' viewing pleasure and get tangled up in a bargaining war between the governor of Varos and Sil, a nasty little thing representing a company (or so it seems) that's interested in buying Zeiton-7 at a bargain rate.  Of course, the pricing argument is only a cover-up for Sil's true intentions:  taking over Varos.  In a world where death equals ratings and negative votes prove painful, can the Doctor and Peri free Varos from Sil's dirty plans?

This tale is considered by many to be one of the best Colin Baker storylines.  It has a lot of action, a decent amount of gore, and some brilliant one-liners from Baker and Bryant.  We get to see Jason Connery, Sean Connery's son, who plays Jandar, a rebel leader trying to overthrow the ancient ruling families of Varos.  We also get our first look at Sil (Nabil Shaban), who is quite possibly one of the vilest, funniest enemies the Doctor ever faced.  ""Water me!"" and Shaban's tongue-flicking laughter entrench Sil into your mind long after the story is completed.  The rest of the enemies in this tale are some of the best during Doctor #6's run.  This tale visits the idea of ""reality"" TV and just how far it can go.  Today, many people argue over having the opportunity to pay-per-view executions.  Could this tale have been a harbinger of things to come?

The special features are pretty light.  This DVD comes with the standard ""Who's Who,"" outtakes, production notes, trailers, a photo gallery and a decent featurette.  The best special feature on this disc has to be the running commentary provided by Baker, Bryant and Shaban.  Of special interest is Shaban's tale of how he came up with Sil's twisted little laugh.

I have to agree with the majority that this is one of Colin Baker's best outings as the Doctor.  I always felt that he, along with Peter Davison and Sylvester McCoy, were cheated out of excellent storylines for the bulk of their respective runs as the Doctor.  If you are unfamiliar with Colin Baker's work as the Doctor, pick this DVD up as well as the ""Trial of a Time Lord"" DVD.  It's some of his best work.",1187740800,9,2635,4.6414686825053995
661433,5,6303482627,"Maybe the medium is the message, maybe it's just a case of mixed messages, but there's something very odd about this ""Doctor Who"" storyline. On the one hand, ""Vengeance on Varos"" presents us with a deeply thoughtful and bitingly harsh satire of televised violence and viewer desensitization. On the other hand, it's exhibit A of that very tendency! As a sophisticated science fiction adventure then it's at once enormously entertaining and yet naggingly unsettling.

What is it about ""Vengeance on Varos"" that's so disturbing? Surely it can't only be the dystopian setting, although Varos paints a grim and forbidding picture of the future indeed: an economically backwards colony planet where, with not a lot of bread to go around, the powers that be rely overly on circuses to keep the populace mollified--the televised torture and execution of criminals, rebels, and dissidents for purposes of entertainment and edification, to be exact. Meanwhile the government itself is hemmed in by a strictly draconian constitution and a sadistic system of referendum, making meaningful change all but impossible--and this includes changing the way an intergalactic corporation represented by the delightfully slimy and evil Sil exploits them for Varos' one mineral export of value. Still, we've seen this kind of thing before on ""Doctor Who"", most recently in ""Caves of Androzani"" but way back in ""Underworld"" as well. This is just the stuff of good science fiction.

Is there more violence in this storyline? Maybe, but compared say to the Daleks blasting everyone in sight elsewhere in the show's history, much of the violence here is only suggested or else is bloodlessly abstract (inducing hallucinations that trick the mind that one is dying of dehydration). Of course there is an incredibly gruesome scene where two prison guards trying to kill the Doctor slip and fall into the acid bath they meant for him; this elicited a collective gasp from even such jaded viewers as my wife and me, granted, but is it really so much worse than the flesh-disintegrating nerve gas in ""Resurrection of the Daleks""? Maybe it's the Doctor's blas nonchalance in the face of their deaths, but we've seen the Doctor at his most popular and beloved exhibit this trait before, in ""Pyramids of Mars"" to be exact, and it didn't really faze us (and it was ""good guys"" rather than ""bad guys"" who bit the dust there). So what is it then? Maybe it's just the total overall effect, but I suspect maybe it's the way the mechanics of the story make the viewer complicit with the citizens of Varos--when the Doctor in almost James Bond style quips to the dying guards ""you'll pardon me if I don't join you"" I laughed out loud in spite of myself, this just moments after my horrified gasp.

Only Colin Baker could really pull this off, though. This is but the third storyline featuring the sixth Doctor and (as of this writing) the earliest of his storylines to make it to DVD. So what are we to make of this incarnation? Well, if the fifth Doctor was bland and beige and goody-two-shoes likable, the sixth Doctor was clearly designed to be a startling contrast to his predecessor on all fronts. Intense, vivid, and a bit of a jerk--maybe even an arrogant cold-(doubly)-hearted  son of a [you know what] in a way we haven't seen since the very most earliest stories with William Hartnell. And yet for all that and for all his disturbing nonchalance when people trying to kill him are hoisted on their own petards, his moral gyroscope is much intact as ever, alloyed with a refreshing spontaneity and a bitingly sharp wit. He's inapproachably alien in ways you might expect from a centuries-old space-time traveler from a distant planet, but eccentric and likeably imperfect and ultimately a fine version of the Doctor indeed.

Incidentally, just who was getting their revenge, and on whom, on Varos? Never quite figured that out...",1185840000,6,3898,4.926940639269406
661434,5,6303482627,"This is an episode that people who like the darker and more complex stories of Doctor Who might enjoy. In this story we see a world where people are glued to their televisions delighting in the real life suffering of others. Where televisions serve up an unending diet of torture and humiliation and an ability to vote on who gets it next. Including the Governor who when his policies are unpopular and recieves a no vote is forced to under go the cellular disintegrater. No Governor has ever survived more than three no votes and the current Governor as this story begins we watch him survive his second no vote.

And why does he get a no vote he is currently in negotiations over the price of zyton-7 Varos's main export this being a mining planet. The Governor believes he can get more money for his people but for this to happen the people must be willing to accept a lower food ration while the new price is being negotiated. But the two no votes in a row seem to indicate they won't accept. But the Governor persists in trying to do right by his people and demands a better price.

The slug like Sil the representive of the Galatron Minning Corperation (Who is one of best Doctor Who villians ever by the way)as well as the Varos government officials with the real power whom are illegally bribed by Galatron minning know that soon the Governor will have to face yet another no vote and soon he'll be dead. Then things will return to bussiness as usual as they make massive profits while those on Varos who work for those profits live in poverty.

Into this situation comes the Doctor the Tardis needs zyton-7 for repairs so he travels to Varos. Soon the Doctor is traveling through ""Punishment Zones"" with Varos rebels these zones are designed to kill people in entertaining ways while the people of Varos watch on live television. Can the Doctor unravel the madness that is Varos before it's too late?

This is a wonderfully dark yet complex story, Doctor Who has always been at it's best when it offers a combination of action, moral questions to ponder as well devious intrigues. I've always been a fan of stories filled with intrigue and I found the underhanded plots in this story to be exceptional. This story is very much in the same tradition as Genesis of the Daleks and The Caves of Androzani in the sense they contain the same combination of action, moral questions and intrigue. No I don't claim Vengence on Varos to be in the same ballpark as ""Genesis"" or ""Androzani"" but I do suggest it is in walking distance of that ballpark.

This might not be a good story for those who are just looking for a fast good time without becoming too involved. This story is very involved and needs real attention. Wich of course is why it withstands the test of repeated viewings there is alot going on.

It has well above average costumes sets and special effects. It really looks like they spent some money on this one. Also most not all but most of the acting is truely excellent. One of the more mediocre performances is by Jason Connery (yes he's Sean Connery's son)not awful acting but compared to the other acting in the story it stands out.

Now on to the DVD special features if I were to rate the special features on this disk i'd have to give them a three out of five. They just didn't go to to much effort on this one. The information text for example has very little information you can go well over five minutes without new info appearing on your screen. The behind the scenes are just some raw footage of the actors playing the scenes making mistakes flubing lines and the like. Okay to watch once or twice but not very interesting. But on the upside there is a good commentary by Colin Baker, Nicola Bryant and Nabil Shaban who plays Sil. You get lots of interesting info about the story as well them explaining alot about the political situation surrounding Doctor Who when this came out. Also on the upside I really enjoyed the deleated scenes there's quite a few of them and they are good I found they added depth to my understanding of the story.

I had held off on getting this on DVD for some time since I already owned the video. But seeing it on DVD really re-sparked my love of this story the picture and sound are far superior.

If your a huge fan of the Colin Baker era like me this is a must have even if you already own the vhs. And if your not a huge fan of the Colin Baker era but enjoy the more complex and dark side of Doctor Who this might be for you.",1126915200,5,4489,4.411835748792271
661435,2,6303482627,"I start up with the nice stuff first. Colin Baker's Sixth Doctor is my favorite after Tom Baker's. Colin Baker brought an imposing larger than life presence back to the role that I felt was absent during Peter Davidson's reign. Colin Baker also brought out the Doctor's darker side reminding the audience that although the Doctor defends humanity, he is himself quite alien. That combined with this incarnation's mental instability subplot should have made exciting storytelling for years to come. Sadly that was never to be. At this point, John Nathan Turner was trying to reinvent the wheel in terms of producing the program while fighting ever decreasing funds and support from the BBC. Having gone from the classic 4-6 episode story arc to a 2 episode story arch leaves the storyline severly wanting. So what your are left with is a very vague backstory about Varos and its economy/people. However, the actors make the best out of a bad situation they have no control over and produce an acceptable story. The good news is that at this point, is the writing is still pretty good. Overall this is a ""business as usual"" Dr. Who story. Nothing note-worthy to the overall Dr. Who subplot. The big hoot of this episode is the casting of Jason Connery as the rebel leader. Jason is of course the son of Sean Connery.",1125878400,2,1314,4.74235807860262
661436,4,6303482627,"Having run out of a vital component for the TARDIS, the Doctor and Peri are forced to land on Varos and replenish it with Zeiton 7.  Unfortunately for the Doctor, he has landed during the period where Varos is a ""prison planet, a colony for the criminally insane, [where] the descendants of the original officers still rule by fear.""  The rest of the people live in poverty, toiling without hope.
They interrupt the execution of the rebel leader Jondar, rescuing him, and joining his wife Areta through a labryinth of passages beset by mental booby traps in order to find a safe exit.  The Doctor is able to maneuvre through some of the traps, and evades capture longer than the other three.
Varos has a dysfunctional totalitarian system, where the referendum system has the governor submitting any proposals to the voters.  If they approve, fine, but if not, he is subjected to a human cell disintegrator.  Four losing votes generally kills the governor, and then there's a new candidate.  The reason for this is that the planet isn't prosperous, its Zeiton 7 being the only asset, and that is ruthlessly exploited by the Galatron Mining Corporation through its representative, a tiny cackling seaweed-coloured reptilian slug named Sil.  The governor wants to further rationing of food in order to hold out for a better price per unit on Zeiton ore, but men vote with their stomachs despite the fact that Sil is trying to buy Zeiton ore for less money, cheating them.
We meet a typical Varosian couple, Arak and his wife Etta, the former who hates the governor, the latter an ardent supporter.  They, like others, have a TV screen with a set of voting buttons (yes, no) per person.  They are bored and dissatisfied with their life, but kept entertained by scenes of execution and torture on TV, which also serve to deter subversive activities.  The interesting thing here is that voting is mandatory, and Etta isn't above reporting her husband.  But more than that, they are a society dominated by TV and must keep themselves apprised of special announcements.
The concept of forced voting is interesting.  Less than 50% of eligible voters turned out for the 2000 election in contrast to over 90% in Saddam's Iraq.  Voting is supposed to be a privilege, but do governments have a right to force people to participate in order to eliminate apathy?  Even more is the referendum system of Varos.  What if we had a setup like this, where the president was forced to directly appeal to the people and get his proposals accepted or defeated, with four strikes meaning the end for the president?  Makes one think, eh?
It's not a good system for the Varosian governor, who tells Peri that ""the theory [is] that a man scared for his life will find solutions to this planet's problem... except that the poor unfortunate will discover that there are no popular solutions to the difficulties he will find.""
When the series was temporarily put on hold, one of the excuses was of the violence in the series.  Possible targets include the acid-bath deaths of two characters, the Doctor showing little remorse for the acid-bath casualties, and resorting to killing rather than trying to talk sense to the villains.  And a guard slaps Peri's face for tricking him early in the story.  Nasty characters include the scientist Qwillam, who says of the rebels ""I want them to scream till I'm deaf with pleasure, to see their limbs twist in excruciating agony, ultimately their blood will flow down the gutters of Varos.""
Jondar is played by Jason Connery, son of you-know-who and clearly not as good an actor as his famous father.  Nabil Shaban would return as Sil in part two of Trial of a Timelord, Mindwarp.  The marsh minnows he eats are sliced peaches dyed green, BTW.  The actors portaying the villains do a better job here, but Martin Jarvis plays the governor and does a good job conveying a well-meaning politician wanting the best for his people but trapped by the political system.

One last burst of energy gets them to the planet Varos, only source of the ore which the TARDIS needs. The only problem is Varos was a penal colony, so the local laws are quite harsh. People are punished severely for infractions and these punishments (including executions) are broadcast for the entertainment of the Varosians. The governor of Varos is in negotiations with Sil, alien representative of the Galatron Mining Corporation, which seems to have some exclusive deal on exporting Zeiton 7. Sil wants the cheapest price possible, the governor wants his people not to starve. The Varosians don't realize the high value of their ore (it's used in all time and space travel) so they vote against the governor when he asks them to hold out via TV broadcast. Whenever one of his proposals is voted down, he gets tortured on TV just like any criminal, which may partially be motivating negative votes. Also, the governor and his advisors are considering exporting videos of the punishments as a secondary source of income, another negotiation point with Sil.

The plot is quite serious for a Doctor Who story and a fairly early condemnation of reality TV (thought it does come two years after David Cronenberg's Videodrome and copies parts of that movie). The ideas are interesting but the lack of humor and lightness is noticeable (except for the campy corporate conniver Sil). Colin Baker's Doctor is rather dark and dour in spite of wearing the most flamboyant outfit in the series. He's perfectly willing to let baddies die (two of the guards wind up in an acid bath!) and bickers with his rather pleasant companion (though her American accent is dodgy at times). The darkness seems to be more in the writing than the actor. I'd be interested to see other Colin Baker episodes to find out if that's true or not.
