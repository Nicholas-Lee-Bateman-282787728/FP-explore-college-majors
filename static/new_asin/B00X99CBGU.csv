8715493,3,B00X99CBGU,Who the hell wants to see invisible centerfolds shouldn't they be visible. All in all found the plot a bit hard to follow and to many sex scenes where is the action here!,1468454400,,170,4.181818181818182
8715494,3,B00X99CBGU,"A friend has gotten me into these foreign produced DVD's lately and they are kind of hit and miss.  Some are ridiculously funny, and others not as much.  This DVD was cheap enough to give it a try, and the plot is rather shallow as you might expect, but sometimes that's okay with these.  Attractive lady though so if you are a fan of hers, that's the reason to get this.",1462579200,,371,4.197183098591549

8715496,5,B00X99CBGU,"Guilty pleasure not for everyone.  Christine Nguyen fans such as myself will love it.  She doesn't disappoint!
Only criticism is that a beautiful woman like Christine should never be invisible.  LOL",1454716800,2,198,5.32258064516129

8715501,5,B00X99CBGU,"I love Christine Nguyen's voice as well as her body, so I enjoyed her invisible scenes almost as much as her other scenes. Yes, the movie has plenty of nude scenes and if you have followed Christine's career, you may pick up on subtle self referencing in her acting. Yes!
I did say, "" In her acting. ""  It's not her fault the writing isn't quote worthy, but she always has great timing with her lines and the subtleties which makes the lines more believable and realistic. The movie flows along well and it's not a porn flick with hard and softcore versions. It's a fun movie to watch if you're a Christine nguyen fan!",1439942400,21,618,4.373913043478261
