7904517,4,B000006GB2,"Not as good as the original and a tad lacking in FX even by the standards of the period the film was very watchable, my second time in recent times, and has that feel good feel from the 80s and 90s. The original was better by far, as is the case with most sequels, but still recommended here even by itself.",1324512000,,307,4.049180327868853
7904518,4,B000006GB2,"A scanner is hired to use his psychic powers to influance the government officials of a city on order for unscrupulous authorities to take control, and hopefully to assist in the creation of a new order of scanners.

""Scanners II"" has a solid, simple plot, though a few elements are recycled from the first (namely the good scanner vs bad scanner sub-plot), but it's main problem is the pacing. Several scenes are slow and a few even screech to a halt. But overall there's a fair amount of entertaining action set pieces to go along with the plot, not to mention a pleasing amount of graphic violence for gorehounds.

Despite some slow spots and a slightly muddled plot, this is otherwise worth every minute for a look, for fans of the first ""Scanners"" and sci-fi fans in general.",1283299200,2,780,4.644927536231884
