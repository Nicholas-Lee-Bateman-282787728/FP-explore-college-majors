7969389,4,B00006IUHC,"German autuer Rainer Werner Fassbinder is one of the greatest cinematic minds of all time. He has a great eye for works in his movies. The Niklashausen Journey is about Hans Bohm a shepherd from the 15th century who claimed to have been visited by the Virgin Mary. As he begins to preach his message he is followed by several people who believe him to be the new messiah. As a result of this he is arrested and burned at the stake. Although this film takes place in the 15th century, Fassbinder puts an entirely modern spin on it to convey a message about the sexual and political upheaval in Germany. Through this tale of Hans Bohm, Fassbinder shows how a revolution can fail. It is done so in a harsh, revealing portrait that makes one really think. Recommened for any Fassbinder fans.",1322265600,2,787,4.510489510489511
7969390,3,B00006IUHC,"In The Nicklashausen Journey, Fassbinder co-writes and co-directs with Michael Fengler an avant-garde film about Hans Boehm, an historical shepherd who in 1476 claimed that the Virgin Mary called him to foment a holy war against the ""decadent"" church and upper classes. To compare the political and sexual turmoil of feudal Germany with that of the modern world, Fassbinder stridently mixes medieval elements (including some costumes, settings, and music) with those from other time periods, including the Russian Revolution (Boehm sings a hymn about Lenin to his followers) and postwar Germany. Although some people find this film a witty and acerbic critique of the Sixties' revolt against the status quo, I found it only sporadically effective, despite a handful of intriguing scenes. The DVD, made from the best surviving archival materials, is of fair quality; the considerable grain is inherent in the 16mm format in which it was shot.
Fassbinder wanted to use anachronism, like his early idol Brecht, to create an aesthetic/political distance in which the audience could analyze current society. But instead of regularly achieving that lofty aim, too often a scene will make its political - and ironic - point, then continue on, and on, in the same vein. This also occurs visually. Fassbinder and his frequent cinematographer Dietrich Lohmann create some striking images, including a running motif of having characters blend into ominous shadows, even as they spout slogans from Socialism 101 - expressing ideology while simultaneously undercutting it. But again, he uses the same strategy repeatedly. The first few times it is compelling; subsequently I felt more ""alienation"" than ""effect.""
Fortunately, there are some scenes in which Fassbinder successfully embodies his theme, namely that there are deep flaws in human nature, both past and present, which engender revolution but which ultimately lead to disenchantment and defeat. Especially effective are those moments which explore a character in isolation. Look at how Fassbinder presents the Black Monk, his own character (although he is not listed in the film's credits). Sometimes the monk - decked out in jeans and a hip leather jacket - eggs on Boehm and his followers with incendiary screeds about The Revolution. But when we see him alone, or talking with just one or two other characters, he is deflated, like a puppet whose strings can only be jerked into life by rhetoric and an audience. And who can forget the Countess Magarethe (Margit Carstensen, soon to play the lead in Fassbinder's extraordinary Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant), writhing and falling all over her bedroom, screaming with desire for Boehm.
Despite my reservations, this ambitious but uneven film is worth seeing for people interested in Fassbinder and political cinema. And it should spark many lively debates about the too many topics it tries to encompass, from religion to revolution, socialism to cinema, and gender roles to the limits of art and society.",1041811200,11,3006,5.277661795407098
