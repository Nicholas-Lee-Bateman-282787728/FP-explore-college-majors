8440150,1,B004SQFSBI,"Ugh, I should have ready the other reviews before watching this. Horrible. But I wasted 1 H and 1 Min before I just had to stop.
I really wanted to watch it but it was too bad",1437868800,,175,3.7567567567567566
8440151,2,B004SQFSBI,"As someone who enjoys early computing history, no matter how dry, this documentary was a rough one to sit through. There's nothing presented here that hasn't been told elsewhere before, and the music cues are out of place and distracting. Watching an interview excerpt with Kathleen Mauchly (offered under the Extras menu) was both a painful and awkward experience as the interviewer rambles almost incoherently. The viewer gets the opinion that a great opportunity was missed in tracking down these computer pioneers, and then having them tell the same old tales that have been captured elsewhere.",1377129600,,598,5.239583333333333
8440152,5,B004SQFSBI,This is a niche' specific documentary.  The quality is 2nd rate but but associated with the age and film to video transfer not the DVD process.  It is  worth some graininess to hear the story.  If you are interested in the history of computers or ENIAC then get this DVD.,1376092800,,271,4.36
8440153,5,B004SQFSBI,"The significance of this film on the working life of John Mauchly, in terms of sheer historical import, is well-summarized in the introductory sentences of Mauchly's Wikipedia entry:
""John William Mauchly (August 30, 1907  January 8, 1980) was an American physicist who, along with J. Presper Eckert, designed ENIAC, the first general purpose electronic digital computer, as well as EDVAC, BINAC and UNIVAC I, the first commercial computer made in the United States.""
This is the kind of documentary in which the director allows the characters to tell their own stories. The deliberateness of Paul David's directorial approach becomes a meditation upon the natural drama of epochal events as lived by their protagonists.
John Mauchly was a pivotal figure in the history of 20th century technology, and he has not received the acknowledgment he deserves. In fact, as the story evolves, we come to empathize with this irascible American genius. And when the patent process grinds down inexorably against him, we feel a sense of outrage.
""Mauchly: The Computer and the Skateboard"" is a must-see for students of the history of computing, as it is ultimately a compelling look at the often problematic relationships between technology, business, and the lives of creative individuals.",1374883200,,1279,5.300492610837439
8440154,3,B004SQFSBI,"Though interesting, I found it a bit tough to sit through.  Partially because the sound level varied depending on who was speaking -- which was distracting, but also it was a little dull.  Most of the interviewees were not exactly riveting to watch (despite having important stories to tell).  Very ""just the facts ma'am"" in most cases.  It's good to have the Mauchly story presented/preserved and I guess I'm glad I watched it.  But I don't know who I would recommend it to.  Much preferred: Top Secret Rosies: The Female 'Computers' of WWII",1316736000,,542,4.774193548387097
8440155,5,B004SQFSBI,"Loved this film---It's a must see for anyone interested in computing history, or your favorite tech-geek. Director Paul David does a fantastic job of portraying the intriguing true tale of the first computer, featuring rare first-hand footage of John Mauchly speaking about his invention, as well as interviews with his close friends and peers.

I highly recommend this film.",1302307200,,375,5.3559322033898304
