7935078,1,B00005AAA3,"Not to be confused with the much superior adaptation of Elmore Leonard's Killshot, this Kill Shot is terrible, even by made-for-TV movie standards. The film plays like a failed TV pilot (which is turns out to be): there are lots of characters who are introduced, but there's no development of them at all - obviously that was being saved for future episodes that never came (thank goodness). All the cliches are there - spoiled rich kid whose father can buy him a college degree, gay student (who happens to be black) whose father rejects him, former cover girl running away from her past, nerdy (Asian) geek, and the list goes on. Elliot Gould has a single scene - the obligatory ""rich father doesn't understand why son doesn't want to come into the family business."" Sub-par acting, sub-par script. Just a total waste of time. I would not have even bothered with a review, but if such a negative review if this convinces anyone not to bother renting it, then the time spent writing the review was worth it!",1340755200,5,1008,4.668539325842697
7935079,4,B00005AAA3,"""Kill Shot"" was originally the 1995 pilot to a potential tv series called ""PCH,"" as in Pacific Coast Highway. It stars Kimberly Goltry, Jacqueline Collen, Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards (in a small role) & many others and is similar in tone to Baywatch, but with less beach antics. The project was unfortunately shelved and didn't surface until its release on dvd in 2001.

Denise was 23-24 years old when this was shot and looks great. Some complain about her small role (limited to the first 15 minutes or so), but she does appear and, besides, there are plenty of other noteworthy women to be found, some more beautiful than Denise. More importantly, the characters are likable and the story keeps your interest.

As far as the ""more beautiful"" women go, ""Kill Shot"" is worth picking up just for the stunningly gorgeous Kimberly Goltry. Kimberly plays Becky, a single-mother Southern belle trying to relocate in S. Cal. and eke out a living as a night club singer.

Kimberly wasn't only physically gorgeous, she had a star quality and genuineness not unlike, say, Marilyn Monroe, albeit more intelligent, not to mention better looking. Unfortunately Kimberly turned in the acting towel not long after ""PCF"" was shelved, but at least we have this gift (the ""Kill Shot"" dvd) to eternally behold her awesome beauty and talents.

Not only is the cast likable, much of the acting is notable, which is surprising since this is an unrealized series pilot. For instance, Ria Pavia and Mushond Lee have a night scene on the beach that comes off so natural it's like witnessing real life.

Jack Scalia, as the trouble-maker from Stacey's past, also displays some great acting in a harrowing scene at the climax that ends in a surprising and shocking way.

FINAL SAY: Don't listen to the grumps. ""Kill Shot"" is a worthwhile tv movie detailing the fun times, drama and suspense of life on the Southern Cal coast.

The dvd runs 92 minutes and is inexplicably rated 'R' for brief/tame nudity that's tastefully done. And there's no potty language. It's more like PG or PG-13.",1320364800,,2065,4.8328611898017
7935080,1,B00005AAA3,I bought this for one reason. And it really wasen't worth it.,1181433600,,61,4.166666666666667
7935081,3,B00005AAA3,"The premise of this film centers around a restaurant owner who wants to put on together a volleyball team to challenge a championship v-ball team from up the beach.  The reason he wants to do this is as a promotional stunt for his business.  The catch is, he needs a former-Supermodel friend of his to be on the team so that the game will be televised on cable TV.  Without her, no TV, no exposure and no $$$.
The fact that this is the plot is ironic due to the fact that Denise Richards is on the cover of the DVD.  She is an extra in the film and takes up maybe 60 seconds worth of footage.  She also has maybe 2 lines.  The film was made in 1996, before she became relatively well-known.  Putting her on the cover is nothing short of false-advertising.  But, as in the plot of the film, the makers figured (after Richards became a star) that without her on the cover, the movie would not get any exposure or sales.  They're probably right, but that does not excuse the false-advertising.
The movie, for what it is, is kind of a full-length feature of BAYWATCH.  That's not altogether bad, considering that it is filled with beautiful women.  Can't quite understand why it was rated ""R"", tho.  There are 2 quick nude flashes (NOT of Richards), but I've seen much more than that on PG-13.  So those who are looking for ""R"" rated versions of BAYWATCH will be disappointed.
The plot seems to incorporate more characters than Leo Tolstoy's WAR AND PEACE.  This causes the movie to wander & meander a bit, but it's still decent in its character development.  The acting is just barely adequate.
In the final analysis, this is a somewhat decent movie that uses mis-leading advertising to sell itself.  I wish that I had read the other reviews before buying it.  It never crossed my mind that Richards would not play a major role in the flick.  Now that you've read this review, you'll know what you're getting should you choose to purchase this DVD.",1035676800,22,1945,4.4772727272727275
7935082,5,B00005AAA3,"This was saposed to be a pilot for a new TV series and was origanaly named PCH. Jacqueline Collen is the Star stalked by a mad man! This was bought and shelved for fear it would interfear with Melrose Place, and other TV Night time Soaps. I was lucky enough to see this privetly with a ""friend"". IT ROCKS. Suspenceful, and even a bit scary. It is a cool ""Chick Flick""!",1021248000,,368,4.197183098591549
7935083,1,B00005AAA3,"This movie boasts Denise Richards on it and also Volleyball, right?  WRONG!!!  Both of them are not in the movie all that much, especially Denise Richards.  She also looks about 21 years old also.  It turns out this movie was filmed actually in 1996, must have been shelved for a LONG while. All I can say is don't be suckered by the cover of the DVD unless you want to get be bored for 90 minutes..",998092800,10,399,4.2105263157894735
