5360574,4,B009PN18R2,"These three Roger Moore as James Bond movies have good picture quality. The aspect ratio changes in the last movie to an even wider screen format which places large blackout bars at the top and bottom on a full screen display.
The first two movies have thinner blackout bars.
The movies themselves are all decent, and I rather liked the ""Man With The Golden Gun"", which is often labeled the worst Bond film Roger Moore made.
The high points of this movie more than make up for the shortfalls.
In contrast I didn't think ""The Spy Who Loved Me, was as good as many say.
It does have a brief spot for Caroline Munro in it, which makes it a great movie for Bond girl eye candy.
I found the ""Jaws"" character to be somewhat tedious and cheesy.
""Live And Let Die"" is pretty good, and a must have for Bond fans, being Roger Moore's first Bond film.
All three are entertaining and this is a good value.",1372118400,3,893,4.321428571428571

5360582,3,B009PN18R2,"After seeing the first, I was horrified & determined to resell it. It was hard to look at the culture of that time and see what incredibly racist swill we considered acceptable entertainment.

The next one was a little better, but the racist target was on Asians this time. Asians AND a loud, crass, unaware Southern Boss-Hogg-like sherrif...Really???

I decided to watch the last one for the tie-breaker. This one was the best of the 3. Still a cartoon of social situations & stereotypes, where any White person is the smartest in a mixed room...UNTIL they bring back the sherrif in civi's....

It's still on the shelf for now, but will probably soon go to the highest unsuspecting bidder.",1364515200,,690,4.781512605042017

5360584,5,B009PN18R2,"LIVE AND LET DIE is the one film in the James Bond series that stands out from the rest. This is Roger Moore's first film as James Bond the British agent with the ""007: LICENCE TO KILL"" and he keeps the body count going up. In many ways it does not even seem like it is part of the series. The character of James Bond was totally revamped in LIVE AND LET DIE. Bond seems to have traded in his cigarettes for cheroots. Gone are the Martinis shaken not stirred, the Dom Perigone, Bond's worldliness and sardonic wit. It's all gone. Even his wardrobe is over-the-top. But it is all a facade. Bond's appearance as a fop and dandy are only a ruse, a deception. If you examine this film you will see that Bond is no perfunctory agent. He dispenses lethal doses of vengeful comeuppance with his urbane charm. The film's lighter approach under Guy Hamilton's direction actually makes many of the scenes of violent and contorted death more palatable. On closer examination this film is a highly stylized piece of action filled nonsense that delivers outrageous thrills, characters, dialogue and humor in a well-choreographed non-stop bit of filmmaking.

THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN has become a cult classic over the years. It contains many of the most basic elements that are an integral part of the early James Bond films. Surrealistic exotic locales, gambling tables via the Casino de Macao, gorgeous cinematography, distinctive and impressive set designs, some very good special effect miniatures, a signature John Barry score, and a very strong presence by the regular British Secret Service cast including M (Bernard Lee), Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) and Major Boothroyd (Desmond Llewelyn) are all present in THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN. However, time often gives things new perspectives and THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN is no exception. For me, I see it as the definitive James Bond cult film. ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE  was often called the cult favorite, but I believe ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE  has had many people giving it a second look ever since Daniel Craig took the role with CASINO ROYALE and it is somewhat viewed ahead of its time and truly mainstream. If THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN is indeed a cult classic, I believe most of the credit can be given to Christopher Lee as Scaramanga along with Herv Villechaize as Nick Nack and the backdrop of Scaramanga's outlandish domicile. There is a strong visual connection with the world of Scaramanga and the viewer.

THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is a big-budgeted opulent Bond film, with a lively and strong screenplay by Christopher Wood and Richard Maibaum and very effective editing by John Glen, delivering one of the most succinctly structured films of the series under the direction of Lewis Gilbert. After THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN Roger Moore clearly redefined his approach to the role as the good-natured British agent. His Bond is suave, debonair, never condescending and resorts to seriousness only when confronted with malevolence. That was the way he played it for the rest of the series. The globetrotting THE SPY WHO LOVED ME featured a gadget laden Lotus Esprit as its centerpiece along with Richard Kiel as the indestructible Jaws the villain's henchman with steel teeth. The main villain of the piece is the maniacal Karl Stromberg, played with detached amusement by Curt Jurgens, whose immense wealth featured an aquatic empire aimed at global domination. Bond must pair up with Soviet agent Major Anya Amasova played by Barbara Bach to track down missing nuclear submarines. The pre-title sequence features a very thrilling and well-filmed ski chase re-establishing James Bond as a major force to be reckoned with. Marvin Hamlisch composed a very effective score to the surprise of many. His music is right on mark and in some sequences very innovative. Hamlisch proves that he really knows how to score a film. Ken Adam returned as production designer bringing a familiar look back to the series not seen since DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Ken Adam also introduced some new concepts giving the film a well-known but unique look. New characters are introduced in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME who would return in subsequent films of the series. They include Walter Gotell as Russian General Gogol, Geoffrey Keen as the British Minister of Defense and Eva Reuber-Staier as Rubelvitch, Gogol's secretary. Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny and in expanded roles Bernard Lee as ""M"" and Desmond Llewelyn as ""Q"" Major Boothroyd are all back. There are well-choreographed great action scenes, beautiful underwater sequences, battles and chases. Some of the best-unsung workmanship in this film is the extraordinary miniatures by Derek Meddings. They are incredible and make this film very impressive and memorable. THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is one of those rare films where all the talents come together at their peek of perfection delivering an impeccable film.

All 3 films have been digitally re-mastered and they look good. The colors are vibrant and the images look clean and sharp. This is a good collection and the viewer is able to see how Roger Moore evolved the James Bond character into his own indelible interpretation.",1363305600,5,5179,4.934633027522936
