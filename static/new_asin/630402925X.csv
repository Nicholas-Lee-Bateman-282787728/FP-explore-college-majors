758563,5,630402925X,This film is a classic! I first saw it when I was younger and I've loved it ever since. Now my children watch it. The cast is excellent and King Brian's Kingdom is both magical and beautiful. The Banshee and the Death  Coach near the end are awesome. This is a must see for children and it is  one of our favorite movies to watch on St. Patrick's Day. A true Disney  treasure.,930873600,3,376,4.123287671232877
758564,4,630402925X,"This has to be Disney's greatest kept secret  - a film which satisfies on many levels.  There's a wonderful story with many plot twists and turns, great whimsical performances by veteran actors and a young Sean Connery,  lovely Irish melodies and the main song, ""My Pretty Irish Girl""  (Mr. Connery sings it!), inspired humor and comedy, incredible special  effects made in 1958 which surpass many made today ( you'll believe they  hired real leprechauns),  and some pretty scary parts ( intense for some ).  Did I mention a great surprize plot twist at the end?  It's one of my  favorites that I watch again and again.  Even old grumps will find some fun  in this.  Try it!",919728000,5,674,4.6581196581196584
758565,4,630402925X,Darby O'Gill And The Little People if a wonderful family movie. Always has been a great way to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. Also might surprise people in the fact that it's Sean Connery's first film.---Tommy Chambers,916272000,6,216,5.027777777777778
758864,4,630402925X,"This film was part of my childhood and a classic to show near St Patricks Day .  As a child the wail,of the banshee and the arrival of the black coach were frightening but after all the special effects of the last 40 years this was mild.

Full of wit and whimsy, this great film is well written and well acted with beautiful scenery. A wonderful Gem from the golden age of Disney. There is also some romance but it is not the main focus of the story. Perfect film for St. Patrick's day, and great for all ages.

I watch it every St Patrick's Day.

King Brian:
Oh, I knew you could sing
when you opened your mug
So you carry the tune
and I'll carry the jug

Oh, I wish all barmaids
Were like Mary McCluskey

Darby: ""McCluskey""?

King Brian:
When she served you a drink
Why, she served you
good ""whuskey""

758871,2,630402925X,"We bought this movie (Prime Video, not the DVD) to watch on St. Patrick's Day.  I hadn't seen it since my grandmother to me to the theatre to see it when I was a little girl.  It is a delightful movie, but the sound quality is VERY poor.  There were several times during the movie that the volume on our television was as high as it could possibly go, and we were straining our ears to hear what the characters were saying.  Obviously, I cannot recommend anyone to purchase the movie in this form.  Perhaps the DVD is much better.",1521590400,,530,4.26

758967,5,630402925X,"I recently gave an enthusiastic review to ""Dragonslayer"", a classic but underappreciated fantasy film. It and ""Darby O'Gill..."" share a lot in common. ""Dragonslayer"" was a Paramount/Disney"" co-production, and ""Darby..."" is pure Disney. It's one of the very best live-action Disney films, bar none. Neither has been given a proper Blu-ray release, and both badly need it.

""Darby..."" is spectacular in many ways. It makes heavy use of Peter Ellenshaw's incredible matte paintings. (His work pretty much remains the standard against which such art is judged.) The special effects are jaw-dropping; there's a mini-feature explaining how they were done. The animation effects are of similar high quality, by Joshua Meador, whom Disney loaned out to MGM for ""Forbidden Planet"".

An overlooked point is that ""Darby..."" has one of Disney's few great male villains -- Kieron Moore (Pony Segrue). Segrue is thoroughly rotten. (His mother, played wonderfully by Estelle Winwood, is almost as bad.) He's arrogant, brutish, cheap, cowardly, fully aware that he's better than anyone else, uses force to get his way, unkind to just about everyone, etc, etc, etc. When Michael delivers Segrue's come-uppance, the latter breaks a bottle and tries to cut Michael with it.

This is hardly a G film. The Banshee frightened many children, and though the worst of the frights, it's not the only one. As with ""Dragonslayer"", this is basically a serious story. Children will have trouble following the (wonderful) dialog, in part due to the accents (which were supposedly diluted in deference to American viewers). It might not be suitable for kids under 12. Outside of being scared, they're likely to be bored.

Image quality is outstanding. I re-viewed it on a 4K monitor with excellent upscaling, and it made me forget this was an SD DVD. (Set your display at ""vivid"". This is Ireland, remember.) Robert Stevenson's direction is spot-on. (He was a Disney ""house"" director, and the grandson of Robert Louis Stevenson.) Definitely a disk to add to your collection.",1521331200,,2042,5.197568389057751

I grew up with this film and it was not until much later that I realized that Sean Connery ...Michael McBride was the 007 guy. Everything is so fascinating when you are young.

759190,5,630402925X,"This is another one of those Disney films for which I had seen lots of clips during montages when Disney was showcasing its past glories.  I'd seen bits and pieces of it here and there, and quite frankly, it got annoying.  Seeing Darby walk past the collection of leprechauns in the cave, seeing the black rider, and seeing the king of the leprechauns really got on my nerves because I hadn't seen the movie.

Fast forward forty plus years later, and I'm a middle aged man, and finally after ordering ""four classic Disney films"" on a four-DVD set, I finally see this very film sweet little film.

All I can say is they just don't make them like this anymore.  And I'm unhappy for it.  We have here some very basic people with some very basic wants and needs, and the specter of ""the quick fix"" or a thing (or being) who can promise all if you can match wits against him as the answer to all of the characters materials wants and needs; a.k.a. King of the Leprechauns.

And add to the mix is a kind of love triangle, with the young handsome Scots' man and the pretty young Irish maid who tends to her father, all the while the specter of lust from another male and the machinations of his ill-thought and ill-motivated mother lurk in the background.

In this sense it's actually quite a complicated movie in terms of story, though the plot is actually quite simple.  But in spite of all of the side stories and whatever else, we can follow it and still feel entertained by the adventures (and some misadventures) of people trying to get along in life, and a father who wants nothing but the best for his daughter and himself, and willing to grapple with the supernatural in order to get it.

It's a tale of greed, a tale of lust, a tale of redemption, and a love story as well.

After seeing a host of just poor contemporary films that delve into all kinds of tawdry topics, it really was a pleasure to see something that was both old fashioned and dazzling to the eye in a very Disney like way.  Colorful, full of live and good performances, and a touch of the blarney, please do give this film watch with either yourself at home or with someone you love.

Enjoy.",1498780800,,2163,4.3775

Wish I'd watched Darby O'Gill before I went.
Great introduction to a lot of the folklore that we heard about while we were there.

Disney's team worked in lots of double entendres though, to the point were Darby O'Gill might be a kink classic.
eg Goolge ""string of pearls"" & ""semen"" and see what you get.
Likewise for ""pulling on the rope"" & ""masturbation""
and ""butter churning"" & ""masturbation"".

It could be a treasure hunt looking for other double entendres, but those jumped out at me.

I'm surprised that this film was directed at little kids in 1959, quite apart from the above there's plenty of drinking, drunkeness, smoking, violence, witchcraft, etc.",1440979200,,715,4.892561983471074

You can't go wrong with Disney for good clean fun.  Its also good for Sean Connery fans to see a much younger version and he sings in it too!

760774,5,630402925X,"I first remember seeing this film when I was a little girl and although I've seen it countless times since, its magic and appeal has remained. The story revolves around the lives of Darby O'Gill, the aging groundsman of Lord Fitzpatricks summer house, his daughter Katy and Michael McBride, the young replacement for Darby's job. Darby's also develops an interesting friendship with the wily King Brian of Knocknasheega, king of the Leprechauns who live in the mountain near the village. This is a lovely little story full of lilting music,Irish folk tales, humor, a love story and some of the best special effects from its time. Given that this movie was made 40 years ago, the special effects used for the little people- giant sets and trick photography, are GREAT! There is very little, in fact that this movie does not contain. It is a delight for all the family and will continue to delight for years to come.",1438214400,6,914,4.754716981132075

760919,4,630402925X,"Darby O'Gill is, of course, not classic Disney such as Sleeping Beauty or the masterpiece Snow White (which my father claimed was the greatest movie ever made), but it's clean, balanced G-rated entertainment, and some people nowadays are still interested in ""vintage"" Disney such as this, the only tale he shot (so far as I know) exclusively about Ireland.
  There are no ""troubles"", of course, in Darby.  It's just set in a rural town that could be anywhere in Ireland, or southern Scotland, the midlands or (perish the thought) south California.  The villagers are just average Irish people who wear flat hats to advise you of their honesty, and waistcoats to inform you both of their affluence and...oncoming middle age.  They're farmers and shopkeepers with (naturally) one pub owner.  The young Sean Connery is Katie O""Gill's suitably dashing suitor, while Katie herself is played by a sweetly freckled Janet Munro.  (""Too headstrong"", the eight-year old director would later muse to himself.)  Old Darby and the rest all reside in Rathcullen, while the little people themselves may sometimes be found in the distant hill of K_____.  The king of the leprechauns is played by red-bearded Jimmy O""dea, and near the end there's a pretty awesome (for 1959) special effects attempt at a banshee.  All in all, there's perhaps a bit too much magic for the average tourist, and, to this day, I'm careful about calling myself, or someone else, ""lad"" without due familiarity.  But if you're into prime 50's or 60's Disney, or if your kids, or their kids, are, Darby is worth a viewing or two.  Some movies made then remain interesting in spite of the times modesty.",1434758400,,1660,4.931654676258993

761594,5,630402925X,"March 18, 2015 - the long running debate among fans of this beloved film about what is or is not the correct aspect ratio for the film has been settled.  And it is not the classical Hollywood frame (1:33) or the similar 1:37:1, as IMDb (and Disney) contend.  Currently streaming on Turner Classic Movies on demand the film is presented in 1:85, and it's clear that the director Robert Stevenson's compositions were designed for 1:85 widescreen and NOT for 1:33.  When TCM broadcast this film on Sunday night, March 15, 2015, they showed the same version as is on the DVD: 1:33, and as with that master, the frame looked crowded and unbalanced.  But in 1:85 widescreen every compositions is perfect and the opening credits (which are cut off on the side in the cropped 1:33 version) are fully visible with breathing room on both sides.  It's a shame that a studio as insanely profitable as Disney cannot release both versions on Blu-ray and allow audience to choose which version they would like to see.  If that day ever arrives, I will always opt for the widescreen version, which I have no doubt was the filmmaker's original intention.  Shame on Disney for its shoddy treatment of this beloved film, and of so many others of its rich live action catalogue (""The Story of Robin Hood"" and its miserable transfer one other example).  But for those of you who are still unconvinced, I urge you to hurry over to XFinity on demand or any other service that carries TCM and see the widescreen version for yourself.",1426636800,,1509,4.667924528301887

I saw it on HBO or some premium channel back 30yrs ago , or more for all i remember.  It is a great family , all round movie.  I do now know anything about the 'extras' on this dvd-I am usually not impressed with so called extras as they add nothing much I care about. I understand this one has some interesting stuff. I got some older rehabbed movies like the first Charlie Chan , or Michale Shayne volumes and they had real interesting additions. So, it can happen I suppose. Just my 2

The only thing which holds me back from buying this, and others, is the price structure. SD and HD tiers is bad enough for for about $20 to get sent the ""HD"" version is too much , even for this high quality selection",1426464000,,950,4.124324324324324

When I was an adult and saw it on video, I was astonished to find that the scenes are STILL impressive and creepy! Considering how sophisticated special effects have become since 'Darby O'Gill' was made in 1959, that's quite a tribute to the moviemaking skills of the day. The scenery is lovely, the actors skilful and wholeheartedly into their work, the music catchy and delightful, and really there's nothing not to like in this movie. The duels between Darby and his nemesis, King Brian, are wonderfully funny, as each tries to outsmart the other. The village characters are all well-drawn and likeable personalities. Pony Sugrue seems more 'American' than the others, but then, he's not supposed really to fit in in the village, and his punishment at the end is an enjoyable comeuppance. Favourite scenes - the banshee and death coach at the end, as mentioned, and all the leprechauns dancing under the fairy mountain then riding their little white horses out into the night as Darby plays them a wild tune on his fiddle.

Superb performances by all of the cast make it even better. Albert Sharpe was perfectly cast as Darby. He made the role his own. Sean Connery was great in his role and obviously enjoyed it. (His later interviews on the experience bears  this out). This is the role that made him James Bond. Janet Munro has wit and spunk that is very appealing as Darby's daughter.

761758,5,630402925X,"This film's success is entirely due to the performance of Albert Sharpe as Darby O'Gill.  The remainder of the cast had to work twice as hard just to keep up with him.  It's a sly portrayal filled with humor.  The story involves a great deal of conniving from many of the characters.  Darby is a local celebrity of sorts for his wild tales told often in the local pub.  He has a plum job he rarely does and is about to be replaced by a much younger man (Sean Connery).  He purposely neglects to inform his daughter (Janet Munro) that they have to vacate the premises.  Somehow, he thinks he will be able to scheme his way to a better outcome, if only he could get his hands on the king of the leprechauns.  Things do not go as planned for anyone.  Also, a banshee shows up at the most inopportune moment.....

This is a sentimental favorite from childhood (the banshee gave me nightmares for weeks!).  It's always fun to watch.  I'm happy to have it in my collection.",1421452800,,967,4.340782122905028

I haven't seen this in over 30 years. The one thing I get this around (not being 8 years old) is that, yes, maybe Darby much of this is going on in Darby's mind. The movie is cute as hekk. And Sean Connery is a stud way back then. Get this, drink with Darby and laugh yer arse off at it.

It's rated G, but this is not a kids movie. It's about 2 degrees of silliness from being a drama.

Darby finds a way out of his predicament in a way that even his daughter endorses.

762360,5,630402925X,"Both me and my then 10 years old daughter we liked this 1959 Disney classic A LOT! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Darby O'Gill (Albert Sharpe) is an aged  widower, living with his adorable daughter Katie (Janet Munro) on a farm near the town of Rathcullen For a very long time he was the caretaker of Lord Fitzpatrick's (Walter Fitzgerald) estate - but he is now retiring and his replacement is a young guy from Dublin, a certain Michael McBride (Sean Connery).

Darby is also a kind of local celebrity, as since like always during all his pub visits he regals his friends with tales of his battle of wits with the leprechauns and in particular of his long standing rivalry with their king, Brian Connors (Jimmy O'Dea). Everybody (OK, almost everybody) loves Darby O'Gill, even if nobody believes his tall tales - but in fact they are all very much real and this film tells the story of the ultimate and the most dramatic episode in this ""Darby O'Gill vs. Leprechauns"" match of century...

This is a lovely, charming, adorable family film exploring in detail and with great care Irish folk legends. The two main actors, Albert Sharpe and Jimmy O'Dea, are absolutely splendid as two old ""frenemies"" who enjoy a lot their rivalry, which they interrupt only occasionally to get drunk together...))) Janet Munro is cute like a button in this film and she gives a great show - it is really heartbreaking that she was taken away by a deadly disease so early (she died in 1972, aged only 38). Young Sean Connery is of course a pleasure to watch in one of his first real roles (his earlier appearances were frequently not even credited) - this film certainly helped him a lot, even if his great break didn't come before 1962...

MEDICAL WARNING: if you are alergic to Irish folk legends, Irish accents, Irishness in general, Disney family films, singing, handsome young men courting bonnie lassies, happy endings, merry cheerfulness, good ale, sense of honour, friendship, joy of life, pranks, riddles, battles of wits and especially leprechauns - well, in such case watching this film can be life-threatening. This is a SERIOUS WARNING and it should be taken seriously...)))

This film may be a little bit difficult to understand for the younger children and also, PARENTAL WARNING here, there is one scene, involving a banshee (a REALLY bad one!), which will probably scare the pants out of them - therefore this film is probably not for any kid younger than 8.

Other that this one little reservation, this is an EXCELLENT, charming family film. A recommended viewing. ENJOY!",1403654400,,2599,4.813901345291479

We do have the ""she's my dear, my darling one"" song stuck in our heads, but we love the song. My kids also liked watching Darby playing his violin for the dancing leprechauns. That induced a lot of laughing on their part.

762816,5,630402925X,"That's not too common, you know:  many real people (as opposed to animated) Disney DVDs of movies from the 50s-70s don't have any special features.  This one has a retrospective by Sean Connery, a really well done explanation of two amazing special effects techniques, which are matte paintings and forced perspective, and a 50-minute Disney TV broadcast where Walt Disney pretends to meet the characters in Ireland.

The movie itself takes a special mindset to watch.  By that, I mean that you have to lose yourself in the 1950s American stereotype of Ireland, which may have been established by The Quiet Man, the first Hollywood movie done in Ireland.  This movie has the same essential Irish components:  music, bar fighting, a feisty and charming girl, and an upstanding young man who wants to marry her.  It's interesting that Disney hired the same cinematographer who had done The Quiet Man, Winton Hoch.  Along with Peter Ellenshaw's matte work, Hoch's Technicolor cinematography makes the movie a visual treat.  The special effects are really fun to watch, too, most of all when the leprechauns leave their underground realm and Darby tries to follow them.

Even though the artificiality of the Irish stereotypes took a little time for me to warm up to, it wasn't too long before I started enjoying the half-fantasy, half-realistic Irish world the movie creates.  (I hadn't seen this movie in years and didn't remember it well.)  The Irish actor who plays Darby O'Gill, an old fella who loves telling stories about meeting and trying to trick the leprechaun king, is really good.  This movie was also the necessary step in Sean Connery's career before he became James Bond, and he plays a really nice character who's ultra-patient with Darby as Darby keeps delaying the transition process.  Sean Connery is supposed to replace Darby as groundkeeper for the lord, and the lord wants Darby to be out of there and Connery in by 2 weeks.  Darby keeps delaying in even telling his daughter about it, and is in the process of trying to determine a wish to make to the leprechaun king, whom he's captured.  The plot developments proceeding from there are quite skillful, in my opinion.

It was really helpful having the subtitles on for this movie, because they use a lot of English words, and Gaelic at times, which are unfamiliar to America.  And many of the ones which are familiar get spoken with an accent and speed hard to understand without the subtitles.  (Thank you, Disney, for including them for deaf people, thus also making it easier for non-deaf people to understand the movie!)

The various elements in the movie are a lot of fun, at least for me.  I think if you give it a chance, you'll pretty soon warm up to its charm and enjoy the special homely world it creates.

762821,5,630402925X,"Some of the reasons why this is a must-see film:  1) Sean Connery giving a great comedy-romantic-action performance before he was James Bond.  2) The beautiful love interest Janet Munro, carrying many key scenes.  3)  A perfect performance by Albert Sharpe, brought back from retirement by Walt Disney himself.  4)  Amazing ""how did they do that?"" special effects before computer graphics ever existed.  5) A storyline with laughs, action, romance, some scary stuff, and a satisfying ending that ties up all the loose ends.

Don't worry about the ""full screen"" 1.33-to-1 aspect ratio.  This is an advantage: it lets you view this movie two different ways:

--In ""full frame,"" you can see everything the camera saw, because this transfer is frame-line-to-frame-line with no cropping.

--Depending on your TV, you might also enlarge the picture to fill your 16-by-9 widescreen TV, and view the movie as it appeared in movie theaters (with a ""soft matte"" from the projector's aperture plate) to approximately 1.75-to-1.  The ""matted"" version as actually more dramatic and reveals ""Darby O'Gill"" as a different movie with a much more cinematic composition.

Finally, make sure your DVD includes the ""I Captured The King of the Leprechauns"" episode of the Disney TV show starring Walt Disney himself.  Walt acts and jokes his way through the 45-minute fictional account of finding leprechauns for the movie, showing that he could do drama and comedy with the best of them.  (His best deadpan line is asking whether he could bring back a leprechaun on the plane from Ireland in a cardboard box.)  Walt is fun to watch; his personality shines through, and it is great TV history!

They could spend a fortune on a remake and it wouldn't be as good as this one.  Enjoy it.",1394323200,,1763,4.959044368600683

My sister gave it to me on DVD Christmas 2013. so now I can enjoy again the ups and downs of life in Ireland. Such beautiful scenery and gaiety, with a very young Sean Connery taking the role of Michael McBride. I don't know any of the others except the actress playing his girlfriend, Katie O'Gill as I saw her in an old black and white horror movie The Crawling Eye, and as a horsemaster in The Horsemasters. Not many songs, but plenty of music. I especially loved the fiddle playing of The Fox Chase with the leprechauns all dancing away until all galloped out of the cave on horseback.

I didn't realize the theme was so dark.  We could barely understand the dialog for starters.  The accents are so thick that we missed at least 50% of what was said.  What I thought would be a cute little movie about a man's adventures with leprechauns was anything but!  There is a scene with a ""bewitched"" horse that pushes Darby down a well that was very scary, as was the scene at end with a banshee floating in the air.  Another pivotal scene near the end was also very scary, but to describe it would give away the ending.  We had to fast forward through it, but the damage was done.  My kids were really frightened.  If you have a child who scares easily, PLEASE watch this first.  I have never had to screen a classic Disney film before, but wished I had done so.

Ellenshaw was a matte painter par excellance who worked on major british fantasy films like Things To Come before getting work with Disney. In the later youtube sections, they discuss and show the work in creating the visual effects and matte art for this remarkable film. The genius of this film is that they created absolutely seamless effects that equal the similar work done in Lord of The Rings, combining the ""little"" people and normal sized ones in various situations. And, they did it with moving cameras all without post optical effects. So, I had to check this film out. What I didn't expect is the richness of the characters and the faithfulness to the original story's colorful language. Other amazon reviewers have mentioned the acting of Albert Sharpe, and the fact that he was not nominated for an academy award. Man are they right on the button. What rich and wonderful notes this man has. His instrument is of the caliber of Charles Laughton, and the best of the best character actors. Even without the marvelous tone of the production values and energetic Sean Connery and Janet Munro performances, Sharpes acting is a thing to behold. The thing about the best Disney is simply the incredibly high quality of the entire productions. And this film doesn't mind scaring the kiddies either.  Watch this just to see how a film should be made...with the best talent on the planet all coming together.

763158,4,630402925X,"Sexual chemistry is not the first feature you think of in a Disney film, yet Sean Connery and Janet Munro fall slap-happily in love in undulating fields of acid-green clover in this surprisingly uncloyed kid's flick.  It is said that Connerys swarthy-browed Dubliner in ""Darby"" catapulted him into the cross-hairs of the casting director for ""Dr. No."" Of course the main duet / duel in the film is between Darby (Albert Sharpe) and King Brian (wily vaudevillian Jimmy ODea).  Sharpe manages to be both the hoodwinked and the hoodwinker, perp and victim in his rondelay with the leprechaun king.  He drinks, squints, natters, brags, connives, shuffles, sniffles, weeps, dances, gasps, shirks, chafes... in short, hes a three dimensional character bursting out of a two dimensional backdrop (James Baskett achieves the same distinction in the unfairly maligned ""Song of the South,"" and as does David Tomlinsons Mr. Banks, surely one of the most conflicted characters in the Mouses oeuvre.)  Some sourpuss will doubtlessly grouse that no Irish stereotype goes untapped in Darby -- but if you are hankering for social realism and a treatise on The Troubles, you shouldnt be browsing Disney films.  The movie boasts a compendium of Irish folklore: a pooka, a blood-curdling banshee, a death coach driven headless rider (as usual in Disney, the frights are deep and serious).  Darbys final bargain with King Brian is a deadly one.
 This is one of 19 Disney movies directed by Robert Stevenson who had a terrific knack for funny fantasy (the suffocating atmospherics of his terrific Jane Eyre were credited to Orson Welles). I am not sure why he hasn't been given his due as one of Hollywoods supreme fantasists.",1372464000,,1705,5.067857142857143

I've owned this movie on laser disc and now DVD. It comes up very well on DVD, considering its age. I really wish Disney would consider a BluRay release. At least the DVD is still available, and I've also seen Darby showing up as a Netflix selection.

The story is very effective, as are the actors, whose heavy accents often make for tough going. I used to turn on the English subtitles when the kids first started viewing this one - they couldn't make out a word.

The extras on this disc - which include the complete B&W full-length TV promo for this movie, ""I Captured the King of the Leprechauns"" (hosted by Walt) - are very interesting, and prove that Walt held great affection for this project. The size differential between the Little People and the humans is achieved through a brilliant use of the technique of forced perspective, which is nicely explained in the extras. There are also interesting segments on matte painting and how it was used to bring the color and feel of Ireland to the silver screen.

This is - for once - truly a movie that appeals to children of all ages. We watch this as a family every St Patrick's Day, and today will be no different, even though the kids are now in college and high school.

Together they sing 'Irish Girl,'  the only time I've heard Connery sing.  While trying to catch the leprechaun king, Darby gets caught instead.  But he finds a way out of the leprechaun mountain.  Meanwhile, a village tough decides he wants Darby's daughter, and Sean stands up to him.  At the end, the daughter is injured in a fall.

763871,4,630402925X,"I recall seeing this movie as a kid in the theater, and I've always wanted it. I am of Irish extraction and it is a fun, innocent Disney movie from the late 50's, but what adds to the enjoyment for me now is that the largely unknown Sean Connery had one of his first Hollywood roles in this movie, and it is a sizeable one. If you enjoy Mr Connery's work, this is a pleasant blast from the past when he was still in his late 20's. Knowing the amazing career that was just around the corner for him, it is fun to see him play this role in a very sweet, winning manner. He sings and gets the girl and this is the reason I bought this film.
I loved this movie as a kid, but as a Sean Connery fan, I find it really nice to see this early, pre-Bond, pre-famous outing of a new actor trying to get his career on track by accepting a role in a Disney movie in the 1950's.
If you enjoy fantasy, or want a sweet film to watch with your children, or especially if you are a fan of Sean Connery and would like to see him as a very young man just starting out and giving a lovely performance, I highly recommend this film to you.

763964,2,630402925X,"The cover of the DVD case says ""more than a wee bit of magical shenanigans!"" In fact, it is quite a bit more blarney, but nevermind. This is Disney at his most Disneyesque. In fact, included in the DVD is an episode of the Disney TV show, ""I Captured the King of the Leprechauns."" Disney does the entire show as if the leprechauns were real, and at he beginning of the movie, the credits include Thanks to King Brian and his Little People for their participation.

There is one major bonus to this movie, however: a very young Sean Connery. Delicious! The rest of the cast is Irish people (well, so is Connery, for all that) who have not gotten famous. I seem to remember some of the faces from other movies or TV shows, or perhaps commercials. I'm pretty sure the young lady who is Connery's love interest was also in Irish Spring commercials.

Anyway, Darby O'Gill is caretaker for the local lord, who is rarely in residence. But when he shows up this time, he brings Michael (Connery) as the new caretaker, and proposes to retire Darby on half pay. Problem is, he and his daughter Katie will have to move out of the gate house to a smaller cottage. Katie has lived there all her life (20 years), and so Darby is reluctant to tell her they must move.

It becomes obvious that the solution is for Katie to marry Michael so they can all live in the gate house together. But it will take some doing to get them to see it. For one thing, she's been picked out as the future wife of her neighbor's son. The neighbor is an old crone (who looks familiar) whose son is a large, stupid braggart and bully. Katie doesn't like him.

Darby goes up the mountain where the ancient ruined castle dominates the hilltop, lured by his horse Cleopatra who has been bewitched. Cleopatra turns into a pooka (see ""Harvey"" review, a couple of months back) and tricks Darby to fall down the well that leads to King Brian's domain. King Brian considers this a rescue, as he knows about him being retired and having to move from the gate house. But Darby plays the ""The Hunt"" on a fiddle (a Stradivarius, no less!) and gets them so worked up they go get their white ponies and ride out of the mountain to go hunting. They open a crack in the mountain to get out, and Darby gets out that way.

Most of what this movie is about is the special effects involved in making leprechauns, a banshee, the pooka horse (basically solarized photos), and the Death Coach. There's not much of a story, except the battle of wits between Darby and King Brian, and that's pretty silly, really.

It's fluff. If you want a movie to share with little children, this is it. For adults, I give it one star: Sean Connery.

764040,4,630402925X,"Darby O'Gill & the Little People is a lovely ""family"" movie.... BUT  only for a family with NO ""wee ones"".  The ""banshee"" who appears in the last half of the movie is  a green ghost-like flowing female apparition with no face, that flies at people and screams, literally ""like a banshee"" .  She shows up several times. Her appearance is something akin to a death angel.  The person she ""gets"" is going to die next.  It was VERY terrifying to my 5, & 7 yr old boys, and they ran from the room crying.  My 8yr olds bolted from the room right along with them , but didn't seem to be upset about it afterwords.  (No insistance on a night light or bad dreams, like the younger two)  My 10 yr old didn't seem to have any problems and never left the room.  Afterwords he did want to discuss how on earth they filmed the flying green ghost lady.  I think the technical details reassured him that it wasn't ""real"" and he had nothing to fear.

The other scary point in the movie is the ""death coach"" which  is a well appointed black stage coach pulled by all black horses with a driver who is conveniently lacking a head.  The coach gallops down from the clouds to collect the person who is dying.  Nothing a small child wants to see or think about.  Even so, without the banshee, I think the kids could have handled the death coach.  Once the deceased is inside the coach, you can see the person is comfortable and not afraid.  Of course the coach doesn't scream like a banshee either.

As an adult, I loved the movie.  It was like many older movies,  perhaps a bit predictable, but sweet and enjoyable.  The ""good people"" win and the ending is happy.  I would say for the age 10 and up crowd it makes a good family movie - but spare your younger folks.  It will just cause them tears and bad dreams - which probably means you aren't going to get a good night's sleep either.",1332201600,3,1866,4.265714285714286
764041,5,630402925X,I actually found this movie boring as a teen but now love it for its charm and tale.

764045,4,630402925X,The age old Disney classic about adventures of Darby O'gill and the Fairys of Ireland. Starring Shaun Connery in his first Hollywood roll. Good fun for any season and the whole family...,1320192000,,186,4.84375
764046,4,630402925X,"I have to admit I have had this film for a long time and never had any real interest in seeing. The fact that a very young Sean Connery was a star in the film had always been a curiosity point. A friend recently recommended it, but I still hesitated. A silly film about leprechauns? I imagined bad special effects with the ""little people"" and a tedious story. I finally watched the film and was in for a very pleasant surprise.
Darby O'Gill has an encounter with Brian, King of the Leprechauns. Darby demands his three wishes but King Brian knows how to trick Darby out his wishes. This becomes a fun running theme as the two try to outwit each other.

Soon, Darby is replaced as caretaker of Lord Fitzpatrick's estate by a young lad named Michael from Dublin. Michael's a decent man and falls for Darby's daughter Katie. It seems like a dream match but nothing in life is ever easy. King Brian seems to be genuinely fond of Darby and wants to help him with his troubles. Darby is actually mean to King Brian and  connives to get his three wishes granted.

Yes, this is a bit of lighthearted silliness but it's also a bit of fun fantasy. The story takes a dark turn when mythical Banshee comes to pay a visit. Now Brian and Darby have to join forces and work together.

Actor Sean Connery has to ease his Scottish accent into an Irish one. Albert Sharpe was a retired actor who was convinced to return to work as Darby O'Gill. His classic Irish accent can be hard to understand at times. Sean Connery actually sings in this film and yes, he can sing. Apparently, the song was a hit in its day.

The true marvel of this film is the special effects. The movie was made in 1959 yet most of the effects have stood the test of time. How did they make the ""little people"" so little compared to the ""normal"" size people. Darby dances with the little people. The little people ride little horses across the countryside. Only when the Banshee shows up do the effects look dated. Do yourself a favor and make sure your version of the film has the extras. It is amazing what the ingenious talent at Walt Disney Studios were able to do long before the computer special effects. It was simple creativity and amazing talent. Also, don't miss the insightful talk given by Sean Connery and he explains how he was cast in the roll.

Treat yourself to ""the little people"" of Ireland in this overlooked Disney classic.",1318982400,,2399,4.428571428571429

And no wonder -- the film is a breath of Irish mountain air.  Yes, there's something crisp and clean about it, as well as charming and delightful.  And, yes, magical.  I love the story, the sets, the special effects, the directing, and the acting.  Sean Connery is great and never looked better; Albert Sharpe and Jimmy O'Dea are outstanding, especially in the way they play off one another; and Janet Munro...well, I've always had a massive crush on her.  A good actress and a stunningly beautiful woman.  And speaking of Miss Munro, I wonder why she's depicted on the DVD box as dark haired, when she has flaming red hair in the movie.  Hmmm.

To this day I remember how petrified we were by that image!  Of course nowadays, such a reaction seems absurd, but back then, in the feverish dream world of childhood, such relatively low-tech cinematography was the height of REALISTIC TERROR!

The short Sean Connery documentary is very interesting, as is the documentary on the making of the movie--I find it fascinating how ingenious Walt Disney was, especially since the effects were ground-breaking, and are still being used today (e.g. Lord of the Rings).  Although the dubbed version is good, I prefer the original voices and am glad they chose to use the original for the dvd.

764415,3,630402925X,"Cute classic from Disney. It is very entertaining for those of us raised on these  movies. I doubt it would be interesting to teens of today though. It is good and clean. I can recommend it for the whole family.

Darby is full of his stories of the little people. After he catches one, all stuff breaks loose. He just has to prove that he hasn't lost his mind and get the right husband for his daughter.",1219363200,2,403,4.220779220779221
764416,3,630402925X,"""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" is given some highly rated reviews here at Amazon.com (which is why I bought it) but it misses the mark, I think, when it comes to being the type of movie we want to watch again and again.

Darby O'Gill is the name of an old Irish man who is a poor caretaker for a rich man's estate in a small Irish village around the year 1900.  Darby and his daughter Katie have lived in the gate house (on the estate) for more than 20 years, but old Darby would rather spend his time at the local pub ... drinking stout (a strong dark beer) and telling his leprechaun stories ... instead of doing his caretaker work ... which is why the estate owner decides to bring in a new man (Michael) to replace him ... forcing Darby and his daughter to move out.

But Darby lives a charmed life in that he is the only person in the village who has seen real live leprechauns.  Some of the people in the village believe Darby's stories ... some don't ... but Darby himself never wavers in his respect and honor for ""the little people"".  Darby also tries to out-fox the leprechauns ... matching wits with the king leprechaun himself ... to get the three wishes that are given to anyone who captures a leprechaun.  It is during these encounters that the movie is at its most fun.  Darby's daughter Katie and the new caretaker Michael hit it off, and this gives the movie some moments of romance too.  But there are also some ... unsavory story lines in ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" and it is at these moments that we want to use the ""fast forward"" button to get to the fun parts.

Albert Sharpe was hand-picked by Walt Disney to play Darby, and he delivers his lines convincingly ... with flair and humor ... but he is, well, hard to look at, and it is hard to want to be on his side.  Janet Munro was chosen to play Katie, and she is pretty and all that, but she doesn't have the depth of goodness ... the honesty and humbleness of spirit ... that makes a girl pretty on the inside ... something I think it is fair to expect from a poor Irish girl like Katie.  Sean Connery plays Michael, and he mugs it up for the camers pretty much, but he doesn't really look or act like a caretaker.  Jimmy O'Dea plays the leprechaun king, and he is wonderful ... the heart of the movie's appeal and fun.

The DVD comes with an ""extra"" that explains how the special effects were done ... mostly how the actors portraying the leprechauns were made to look small ... and it is truly amazing to see the effort and ingenuity that went into them.  Peter Ellenshaw, the man who supervised the special effects, is the real star of this movie.

But ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" misses the mark for high quality entertainment, which is too bad because it had the makings of a classic.  It is the writing of the story ... the first, and by far the least expensive, stage of the movie making process, but it's the area where movie makers invariably do their worst work ... and in ""Darby"" too many unpleasant story lines were allowed to creep in to what should have been a thoroughly charming movie.",1219017600,7,3102,4.313253012048193
764487,5,630402925X,Disney has released some good movies the last few years but nothing can beat the movies they released 20 to 30 years ago.

764489,5,630402925X,"Fun movie.  It's an older Disney movie but still had fun special effects and a really young Sean Connery (007) who I had never seen in this type of role.  My kids have watched it at least 50 times since we bought it so it was money well spent.  There's little people, singing, scary banshees, and pots of gold.  Especially fun durning St. Patty Day.",1212969600,,349,4.323076923076923
764490,5,630402925X,"First of all, it must be said that unlike the videotape version, which is blurry and almost unwatchable, the DVD version is crystal clear and is as sharp any contemporary television program.

The story is excellent for kids. There is the contrast between good and evil, namely, a sneaky brute who likes to pick fights, versus Sean Connery, who is honest and charming.

Fantasy scenes abound, for example we see a leprechaun being changed into a rabbit.  We see mountainsides spontaneously opening up where inside can be found dancing leprechauns and treasure chests spilling over with gold coins.

DARBY O'GILL AND THE LITTLE PEOPLE is set in a small Irish town. Darby O'Gill is an old widower who likes to pass the time telling stories at the pub, to the delight and disbelief of others. As long as town priest Father Murphy isn't around, Darby spins yarns about the little people who he has encountered at a hilltop known as Knocknasheega. Meanwhile, Katie, his daughter, is content to take care of things at home, and insists she doesn't have time or great desire for a love.

One day Lord Fitzpatrick arrives in town and delivers the news that Darby is to be replaced as caretaker of the Lord's estate. Rather than upset his daughter with the word of his retirement, Darby tells her that the caretaker-to-be is merely helping with some house work. That man is Sean Connery, a polite, young fellow who feels that Darby should let his daughter in on things.

Darby has another task in mind. He's to ride into the next town and bring back the new church bell for Father Murphy. At night, while he's trying to get his horse, he falls down the well atop Knocknasheega and plummets down the well and into the world of leprechauns.

Here, a wonderland sequence depicts Darby amongst countless leprechauns. Darby encounters the legendary King Brian Connors the 5,000-year-old leprechaun monarch (just under two feet tall). King Brian explains that Darby has been brought to their world as a favor, allowing him to escape the disappointing early retirement he faces in the other world. This scene is accompanied by Irish fiddle music, fiddling with lightning speed.

The leprechauns can only work their magic when it is dark out, and while a leprechaun will grant you three wishes, making a fourth wish negates the three before. General merriment ensues as Darby plays the fiddle and the leprechauns do hundreds of heel clicks and assorted clogging steps. The music, supplied by fiddles and pipes, is a wonder to behold.

In another scene, Darby tricks the King into staying with him all night, in an episode where Darby and the King exchange dozens of silly rhymes. The exchange of rhymes occurs in a barn, and a nearby horse engages in many amusing expressions, a feature of the film sure to amuse every kid. Another highlight, is that Darby teases the King by allowing a cat to chase the King about the barn, and the King hides behind the spokes of a wagon wheel to protect himself, the spokes resembling a jail cell. The King and Darby resume their laughing exchange of silly poems, but once the rooster crows at dawn, and the sun comes out, the King has lost his powers (e.g., to jump through doorways) and Darby succeeds in capturing the King and puts him into a bag. Then Darby demands his three wishes. (I don't reveal the ending.)

I saw this movie when it first came out, in a theater in Philadelphia.  It was a hot day.  I was only eight.  Although the movie has scary parts, I was not particularly scared.  I found the banshee part about as scary as the plague scene in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, a movie released a year or so before DARBY O'GILL.",1210032000,,3649,4.690140845070423
764491,4,630402925X,"I remembered being terrified of the ""Banshee"" when I saw this as a child.

764492,4,630402925X,"This movie is adorable- to ME.  My kids couldn't keep from watching it- for it is engaging to them to watch imaginary creatures- leprechauns of course! They sang the songs and were mystified by the scenes. However, it is very difficult to understand and follow the language the first time you watch it. The Irish and botchy covered Scottish is not smoothed over, so especially if you've not spent much time with folks from there, you might find yourself rewinding. Also, as captivating as it is, it also has some scary parts. I was not as sensitive to them as I should have been. My eight-year old pointed out to me that the spooky horse scene and the banshee (ghost of the dead) are really scary. And they wanted to watch the movie a second time in a row, while covering their ears and eyes for these parts, despite their fears!  When I told my younger brother about it, he exlaimed how scared he was of the banshee when he watched it as a younster as well. So there you have it. But it's quite fun to watch Sean Connery in his big film debut- Walt Disney apparently helped him make it in Hollywood in the late 50's!  There are some REALLY neat post-film commentaries and ""how'd they do that?"" demonstrations, which are entertaining for the older set. Disney film production was just coming out with special effects in this film, and it's interesting to learn how they did it. So- enjoy with a bit of salt!",1205452800,,1407,4.466926070038911

A children's classic movie that is fun for the adult's to watch also.

764675,5,630402925X,"The first time I was aware of ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" was when I saw a pre-release special about it on the Disney TV show way back in 1959.  From what I saw on the TV, I immediately wanted to see it when it opened in theaters later that year.  And so I did.  What I remembered most about the movie in later years was that I was soooooo scared by the Banshee that I hid my face in my mother's lap until she (that is to say, the Banshee) went away.  I was also spooked, but not as much, by the Pooka and the Death Coach.  I remembered little about the actual plot.  Many years later, as an adult, I caught up with the movie again on television.  Oh, I recall that scene, I kept saying to myself as the movie progressed, and actually ended up enjoying it more than I did as an eight-year-old.  And the Banshee still sent shivers up and down my spine when she appeared. That is absolutely the best Banshee I have ever seen on film to this day. For that matter, all the special effects in ""Darby O'Gill"" are remarkable, considering when the film was made.

Sure, some fantastic aspects of the plot are flawed, if you know anything about Irish fairy-lore.  But that doesn't keep ""Darby O'Gill"" from being a highly entertaining film.  My Irish-born boyfriend loved this movie, and he had more than a few words to say if ""Americanized"" Irish lore on film got his Irish up!  I'm very excited to have this film in my collection, to be able watch it whenever I want -- not just on Saint Patrick's Day -- and to get frightened by that Banshee all over again!",1178668800,4,1559,4.247457627118644

It really was incredible how they could make a person believe that an average sized actor really was the size of a leprecaun. The extra features were nice as well. It was interesting to see Sean Connery discuss his memories of the production and the special on Disney actually travelling to Ireland to get the king for his movie was cool as well.

764681,5,630402925X,"Set in a quaint, Irish village, ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" is the story of an old groundskeeper who lives alone with his beautiful, 20-year-old daughter, Katie, and spends most of his time in the local pub telling stories rather than keeping up with his work. Darby's stories are usually about leprechauns, with whom he has a personal acquaintance. In fact, his best friend and greatest adversary is Brian Connors, king of the little people. Our story gets started when Darby finds out he is to be replaced in his position by a much younger man, the newly arrived Michael McBride, a well-mannered, handsome Dubliner. Darby is to be comfortably retired to a smaller cottage on half-pay, but breaking the news of the change to Katie will be no easy thing. He convinces young Michael to let him break the news to Katie in his own time, and invites the lad to move in right away rather than wait for he and his daughter to move out. A mutual attraction is instantly noticeable between Katie and Michael, and it seems like the three could be one happy family if it weren't for the secret of the O'Gills' eviction being kept. The odds soon change in Darby's favor, however, when an attempt by King Brian to rescue Darby from his worldly troubles goes wrong and suddenly finds him having to grant Darby his three wishes. Darby makes his first wish so that King Brian will have to stay by his side until he decides on the second and third, hoping this will give him time to wish-up a solution to his problem of securing his unmarried daughter's future. This is a dangerous game, however, as keeping King Brian prisoner can have dire consequences from the supernatural realm under his control!

If you are a Disney fanatic, a Saint Patrick's Day reveler, or just a collector of the greatest fantasy films of all-time, Disney's 1959 classic ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" is a must own! With an outstanding cast and baffling special effects that still hold up well today (one or two minor moments aside), ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" spins an Irish tale of leprechauns, banshees, and ghostly coaches the likes of which you've never seen! Sean Connery stars in one of his earliest film roles as the charming Michael McBride, Janet Munro is his gorgeous, fiery-tempered love-interest, Katie O'Gill, and Albert Sharpe and Jimmy O'Dea take center stage as Darby and King Brian respectively. Kieron Moore is also worth mentioning as the villainous rival for Katie's affections, Pony Sugrue, as is Estelle Winwood as his scheming mother. The film features wonderful music and a couple of delightful songs, plus the brilliant direction of Disney legend Robert Stevenson. The DVD release is a winner as well! The film is appropriately in widescreen with the original audio track and a gorgeous picture, there are fun, animated menus, and even three excellent bonus features! ""Mr. Connery Goes to Hollywood"" is a new featurette that successfully turns its insightful interview with Sean Connery into a sort of ""making of"" experience. ""Little People, Big Effects"" gives us a fascinating look at the amazing techniques used to make Darby's leprechauns look so small, among other neat illusions. And, finally, we get a full episode of the Disneyland anthology series, ""I Captured the King of the Leprechauns,"" in which Walt Disney, at the suggestion of celebrity-friend Pat O'Brien, takes a trip to Ireland to learn about leprechauns and capture some to star in his film. This last bonus is a must see for fans of the film, and includes wonderful scenes like Walt learning the origin of the little people, and his first meeting with Darby O'Gill and King Brian! It was Walt's wish to convince movie-goers that the leprechauns in his film were the real deal, and this excellent episode of the Disney TV series was a great example of his attempts (and a great chance to see Walt starring throughout).

I highly recommend ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" to anyone with an interest in the subject matter. It's truly one of Disney's greatest masterpieces, one of my own favorite films of all-time, and a must for any serious DVD collection.

Everytime we think of Disney live action retro, we go to things like the Parent Trap, The Ugly Dachsund, That Darn Cat, The Love Bug, so on and so forth. Not too many people immediately refer to Darby O' Gill And The Little People, because I'm afraid some don't want to admit to liking ""the wee folk.""
As a matter of fact, I would put this movie on par with his The Story Of Robin Hood, a legend of a movie. And it's all based on myth, folklore, and tales from Ireland, while being executed brilliantly.
I did manage to see some behind the special effects on an old Disney show, and they showed the extensive use of paintings and illustration to preshow the outlook of the final scenes to be filmed. Boy, does that preparation show.
I've honestly put myself aside from knowing too much about the special effect process deliberately in order not to blow the awe I still have for some special scenes. The sequence where Darby is seen walking though the middle of magical underworld is mindboggling to say the least. The detail couldn't be more perfect. And to me, that's what this movie is really all about! The charisma between Darby and the mythical folk, and his dealings with the townspeople in order to establish them-as real.

This DVD provides two trailers that answer all the questions, but don't watch them until screening the film. All this was done long before digitalization was even a theory and that's what makes this film so special in its excellence. But, it's the acting that makes this film work and Darby O'Gill (Albert Sharp) and King Brian (Jimmy O'Dea)couldn't be better matched as the friendly adversaries.  Sean Connery and Janet Munro provide a squeaky clean romantic diversion, but they are just wallpaper for the two principal actors.  The supporting cast is perfectly balanced.

The accents are AWFUL, barely Irish, and the real Irish countryside -which would blow you away - is sacrificed for phony looking sets. Many of the details just plain ridiculous to Irish Americans and Irish people alike and even the dialogue is spiked with phrases used by Brits, not the Irish. This is an Americanized view of Ireland strictly for people who think the Irish drink green beer on St. Paddy's Day and think everybody in Ireland walks around with a shamrock stuck in their lapel.  The music? Good Lord! Considering the wealth of real Irish music to draw from, the soundtrack is just an embarrasment.

I will say that the irish accent is so thick at times it is hard for this southern boy to understand (I bet they would say the same thing about me if over there).  The big star in this (although unknown at the time) is Sean Connery.  I believe I read somewhere that this is the first credited role he ever had in a movie.

764926,4,630402925X,"Disney created a series of excellent movies in the 1950s and the early 1960s, many of them in filmed in Great Britain.  One of the best of these movies was this one, starring a very young Sean Connery as Michael McBride, Albert Sharpe in the title role, and Janet Munro as Darby's daughter Katie O'Gill.  The movie is somewhat family friendly, though there are a few moments that might be unsuitable for the youngest members of the family.

Darby O'Gill has reached retirement, and Lord Fitzpatrick (Walter Fitzgerald) has decided it is time that Darby be replaced by a younger man, and Michael McBride is his choice.  As tends to be Darby's habit of recent years, when Lord Fitzpatrick arrives to give Darby the news Darby is down at the pub telling stories about the king of the Leprechauns.

Darby receives the bad news soon after returning to Lord Fitzpatrick's land.  Darby delays telling Katie the bad news; this turns out to be a mistake.  The pace of the story picks up rapidly.  We learn that Sheelah Segrue (Estelle Winwood), who looks much like a witch, wants to have her bully son Pony Sugrue (Kieran Moore) replace Darby and marry Katie.  Sheelah does her best to manipulate events both directly and by pushing her son to discredit Michael.

The highlight of this movie is Darby O'Gill and his encounters with King Brian (Jimmy O'Dea), King of the Leprechauns, and the little people.  Darby falls into the underground world of the Leprechauns, and the special effects there are marvelous.  In one of the best special effects scenes in the movie we see Darby O'Gill with the little people dancing and later riding horses around him, and yet the scene appears natural without any of the telltale signs that you often see with various project effects.

The story ups the ante when Darby deliberately captures King Brian in order to make his life and that of Katie more secure.  In this part of the movie I had to wonder whether the story we heard Darby tell at the beginning of the movie about his encounter with King Brian was true, because Darby is careful and thoughtful with his wishes.

Eventually the movie arrives at a point where the truth must be told, and Katie literally faces death.  Darby must make difficult choices if he is to have a chance to save Katie and to have everything come out in the end.

This movie is a rarity, a Disney movie with substantial special effects that has aged well.  The use of native Irish actors was a big plus because the accents were real.  Albert Sharpe is the centerpiece of this movie, playing Darby O'Gill as though he was Darby.  This movie was the next to last movie in which Albert appeared, which is ironic and fitting given that Sean Connery and Janet Munro were both just beginning careers.

What of Mr. Connery, the future James Bond and now one of the best actors in the world?  He shows a lot of promise in this movie with his understated performance.  I consider both Connery and Munro's performances to be among the best in this movie.  Connery also sings a song, and he does fine.

Disney produced a number of good films during Walt Disney's last years.  This particular movie was supposedly a personal project of Walt's.  I think that this movie is a credit to Walt Disney's creativity and his insistence on quality.  I think this DVD release would make Walt Disney proud, particularly the making of feature.  Disney liked to charm and delight his audiences, but he also enjoyed revealing secrets, and showing how this charming movie was made would have made him happy.

765021,5,630402925X,"Those days of Walt Disney movies are timeless, fun, humorous, adventurous, heart-warming and perfect for the family. ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" is no exception. This magical film, created in 1959, gives you a ""wee bit"" of that Irish charm that you will want to see over and over.

Let me start by saying that I'm only 24 years old and grew up with this movie. I remember going to a movie theater to watch this with my parents as a little kid, though I could never understand all of it at the time. On a personal note, my family and I are very proud of our Irish heritage and take great pride in watching this movie. It is great for St. Patrick's day or any time of the year.

This movie is about a loveable, funny and feisty Irishman named Darby O'Gill played wonderfully by the late Albert Sharpe, and his adventures with the Little People. Darby lives for making his beautiful daughter Katie (played by the late Janet Monroe) happy, as well as tending to the ""Gatehouse"" for the Lord Fitzpatrick, and most of all, catching the eye of the leprechauns and telling stories in the pub about their leader, King Brian (a fantastic performance by the late Jimmy O'Dea). Who wouldn't want to run into the spunky little King and ask for ""three grand wishes?"" From a crock of gold, to a crock of potatoes, you can have what you desire (but don't wish a fourth mind you, or you will lose everything!)

For you Sean Connery fans, you're in for a real treat. A young and handsome Connery plays Michael McBride, a man from Dublin who has come to take Darby's place in working under Fitzpatrick. When McBride moves into the ""Gatehouse"" with Darby and Katie, a gradual attraction starts to form between Katie and Michael. You kind of get a sense of family there with Katie, Micheal and Darby. But a couple mischievous people; a wisecracking, barhopping jerk named Pony and his elderly mother, have plans of their own. Pony wants to be the one to take Darby's place and he will go to various lengths from harassing Katie, to beating Michael over the head and making him look like a drunk. His nosy mother meanwhile is busy sticking her nose where it doesn't belong at the ""Gatehouse."" Though Katie thinks she's a ""poor old woman,"" her father Darby thinks otherwise.

The adventure with the ""Little People"" begins when Darby attempts to capture his runaway horse, Cleopatra. After the horse becomes possessed by mysterious powers (probably caused by the ""Little People""), the horse makes Darby fall into what looks like a well. The leprechauns find him and take him to a large room where leprechauns can be seen from end to end dancing their hearts out rapidly to an Irish jig played by King Brian on a bagpipe. There, Darby is greeted by the little King and is invited to stay with them, without going back. Energetic Darby entertains the ""Little People"" with a catchy Irish jig he brings forth from a violin. This is one of the best parts of the movie, where the dancing and the music get faster and faster, and the little people end up taking off on their little white horses for the ""fox chase.""

But cunning Darby has plans. After escaping from the home of the leprechauns, Darby returns to his home to await a disgruntled King Brian, who is angry with Darby for leaving. But the contagious pair eventually break into one of the funniest parts of the movie where they drink Irish liquor and play ""the Wishing Song."" The Little King ends up getting drunk as a skunk, loses track of time and before he knows it, it's daylight; a time where he cannot use his powers to escape. Now he is at Darby's mercy and Darby uses one of his wishes in wishing King Brian to stay with him until he makes his final two. So Darby in the meantime, takes to toting King Brian around in a sack over his shoulder and boasting about how he ""captured the King of the Little People.""

But King Brian will not be going home so soon. For Darby wants to make sure Katie is ""pleased"" and has what she desires before he makes any more wishes. The key here is to somehow get Katie and Michael together. So King Brian takes to ""visiting Katie and Michael's dreams"" where he tries to persuade the two that they should be together and are meant for each other. But it seems that Katie and Michael are not ready for commitment yet.

 But things start to take a turn for the worst after Katie receives a note telling her that she and her father must move from the Gatehouse immediately to make way for Michael to take Darby's place. Unfortunately the Gatehouse had become a home to Darby and Katie especially. Darby knew that they were on borrowed time in the Gatehouse, but he failed to tell Katie about it right away, for fear of upsetting her. So Katie eventually found out the hard way. When Michael walks in on Katie as she's packing, Katie lashes out at Michael for not telling her of the arrangements. Despite Michael expressing his love to Katie and his wish to marry her, Katie storms out of the Gatehouse and eventually winds up at the pub where Darby is there with King Brian in the bag. In a desperate attempt to get her father's attention, Katie throws the bag to the ground and King Brian, appearing as a rabbit, escapes.

Later that night, Katie has another confrontation with Michael in the barn near the Gatehouse. Despite Michael's attempts to stop Katie from going to the mountainside to catch her father's horse Cleopatera, Katie slaps him in the face and walks out and up the mountainside. Later on, Darby finds Michael after Pony had beaten him over the head and poured liquor over him in an attempt to make him look like a drunk when the Lord Fitzpatrick would come by. Darby and Michael are beginning to talk when the ghostly wail of the Banshee glides eerily through the dark. Darby knows what this means. The Banshee is almost like an Irish reaper; a ghost that resembles death or someone about to die. Darby knows now that they have to find Katie.

Darby and Michael take off to the mountainside littered with rocks and old castle ruins. They call for Katie and look high and low. Then Darby spots his horse looking over the edge of a cliff and runs to where the horse was and looks over the side to find Katie lying on the ground unconscious. As he approaches Katie, lightning crashing around him, he looks up to see the Banshee. With some terrific special effects for a 1959 movie, the Banshee appears; ghostly white and transparent coming toward them through the air. Darby tries to shoo the Banshee away from Katie and after he throws his lantern at the ghost, she finally disappears.

After Michael and Darby take Katie home, they find that she is feverish and on the edge of death. Not only that but the dreaded Banshee is still lurking around and Darby, in desperation, takes off after the Banshee, swinging a shovel at her. So to make matters worse, the Banshee beckons the ""The Death Coach"" to come for Katie. And with more great 1959 special effects, a ghostly image of a coach with the eerie sound of galloping horse hooves comes out of the darkness. Darby is terrified and calls out for King Brian who eventually appears. Despite Darby's wishes for Brian to send the Death Coach away, Brian is unable to do so, as it is ""not within his powers."" So a desperate Darby makes his third wish; to let the Death Coach take him instead of Katie. Very reluctantly and sadly, Brian grants his wish and not long after, the Coach comes up to Darby and in an echoing voice, the headless horseman orders Darby to get into the Coach. Slowly and reluctantly, Darby gets into the Coach.

But Darby has a surprise visitor awaiting him in the Coach. It's none other than King Brian, who gives Darby the good news that Katie's fever broke as soon as he had stepped into the Coach. After a humble and mournful Darby expresses his thanks and talks of how ""it's better for the old to die than the young,"" King Brian cleverly tricks Darby into making a fourth wish which means he loses all his wishes. So Brian, with that little contagious laugh, basically pushes Darby out of the Coach with the power exerted from his finger and Darby is left back in front of his home in a puddle of rain.

From then on, everything is on the up and up. Katie gets well again and she and Michael rekindle their romance. Darby gets to brag to the guys at the pub of how he must be the only man to have survived riding in the Death Coach, while Michael gets to beat the heck out of Pony for beating him over the head and making him look like a drunk. But I guess when it's all said and done, you can thank King Brian for his lessons well taught.

You know, sometimes when I think of a movie from the 50's or before, I have to laugh at the cheesy special effects that they must have. But when it comes to ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People,"" I do not laugh. Only Disney could pull off such fantastic special effects for the era. In addition to the great work with the Banshee and the Death Coach, there is also the way they made the ""Little People"" (played of course by regular sized people) actually look like little people, especially when next to the regular-sized Darby O'Gill. That was very well done.

As I mentioned before, you get plenty of Irish charm in this film from Irish jigs, Irish liquor, and such catch phrases as ""I'll kill ya dead and murder ya entirely,"" ""Ah, the devil take ya!"" ""he'll put the come-heather on you and make you his slave for ever more,"" and ""hold your whist!"" You also get a good taste of what life and culture is like in Ireland and how the people are with one another. I personally hope I get to visit this land of my roots someday.

This timeless film holds the perfect blend of drama, humor, adventure and spookiness all rolled into one. It is a ""grand"" movie that the family will love and the acting is very well done. You'll love listening to the distinctive Irish accents and those Irish songs such as ""My Pretty Irish Girl"" and ""She Is My Dear My Darling One,"" will get stuck in your head.

This is a charming movie and worth a crock of gold! You'll also get a few crowned jewels with the special features that are provided on this DVD.",1122940800,2,10141,4.44940796555436

Sean Connery is, and forever will be, my god.

The story is excellent for kids.  For example, it shows a leprechaun being changed into a rabbit, mountainsides spontaneously opening up where inside can be found dancing leprechauns and treasure chests spilling over with gold coins, and domestic family scenes.

Darby O'Gill and the Little People is set in a small Irish town.  Darby O'Gill is an old widower who likes to pass the time telling stories at the pub, to the delight and disbelief of others. As long as town priest Father Murphy isn't around, Darby spins yarns about the little people who he has encountered at a hilltop known as Knocknasheega. Meanwhile, Katie, his daughter, is content to take care of things at home, and insists she doesn't have time or great desire for a love.

One day Lord Fitzpatrick arrives in town and delivers the news that Darby is to be replaced as caretaker of the Lord's estate. Rather than upset his daughter with the word of his retirement, Darby tells her that the caretaker-to-be is merely helping with some house work. That man is Michael MacBride, a polite, young fellow who feels that Darby should let his daughter in on things.  (This man is Sean Connery, years before he was transformed into James Bond.)

Darby has another task in mind. He's to ride into the next town and bring back the new church bell for Father Murphy. At night, while he's trying to get his horse, he falls down the well atop Knocknasheega and plummets down the well and into the world of leprechauns.

Here, a wonderland sequence depicts Darby amongst countless leprechauns. Darby encounters the legendary King Brian Connors  the 5,000-year-old leprechaun monarch (just under two feet tall). King Brian explains that Darby has been brought to their world as a favor, allowing him to escape the disappointing early retirement he faces in the other world.  This scene is accompanied by Irish fiddle music, fiddling with a velocity worthy of Art Arfons, Mickey Thompson, or Craig Breedlove.

The leprechauns can only work their magic when it's dark out, and while a leprechaun will grant you three wishes, making a fourth wish negates the three before. General merriment ensues as Darby plays the fiddle and the leprechauns do hundreds of heel clicks and assorted clogging steps.  The music, supplied by fiddles and pipes, is a wonder to behold.

In another scene, Darby tricks the King into staying with him all night, in an episode where Darby and the King exchange dozens of silly rhymes.  The exchange of rhymes occurs in a barn, and a nearby horse engages in more amusing expressions than a trained chimpanzee, a feature of the film sure to amuse every kid.  Another highlight, is that Darby teases the King by allowing a cat to chase the King about the barn, and the King hides behind the spokes of a wagon wheel to protect himself, the spokes resembling a jail cell.  The King and Darby resume their laughing exchange of silly poems, but once the rooster crows at dawn, and the sun comes out, the King has lost his powers (e.g., to jump through doorways) and Darby succeeds in capturing the King and puts him into a bag.  Then Darby demands his three wishes.

Darby and King Brian battle wits, respectively trying to make the most and least of the three wishes. Darby decides that his best plan is to make one wish and keeps King Brian captive until he can decide on the last two.

765103,5,630402925X,"If you ever want to find out how Disney tried to bridge the gap between their classic animated fantasies and the live action spectaculars of today, DARBY O'GILL AND THE LITTLE PEOPLE is a typical example of the way things shaped up in 1959.  Very few of Disney's movies were specifically about the Irish people, and it is noteworthy that, even in the day of MULAN and POCAHONTAS, no animated feature has been released by Disney that concentrates on an Irish story!  So this is where you would go if you wanted to look at Irish legend told through Disney's famous factory of observation and fun.

Of course for those who like looking at ""stars before they were stars"" the movie reveals a Sean Connery whom some will not recognize because he's just so darn young!  Connery had filmed a few movies earlier in the UK, and I suppose Disney executives thought that if his name was ""Sean,"" he might be Irish as John Ford (who sometimes said his name was ""Sean"") and cast him as an Irish woodsman with a huge crush on Janet Munro.  Well, both Munro and Connery and Scottish but it didn't seem to make a difference to the youth of America at which this picture was aimed.

The wonderful Albert Sharpe came out of retirement to make this, and he is sharp as a tack; a thoroughly complete performance. He should've had Oscar recognition. For that matter, this film was not nominated for any Oscars at all. The sweet ballad ""Irish Lass"", though a hit at the time, was ignored, as well as the wonderful Special Effects...and, sadly, Sharpe's performance.

Janet Munro made her Disney debut, here, and he used her in many others (I liked her in ""Swiss Family Robinson""). I don't know what happened to her.

 Kudos to the cast, who really bring this film to life. Albert Sharpe is great as the lay about but loveable Darby O'Gill and the beautiful Janet Munro lights up every scene she's in playing Darby's daughter and Sean Connery's love interest.

 As to the issue of widescreen here is the official word from Disney (as included on a flyer in the DVD):

 ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People is presented as it was originally shot, in a 1.33;1 aspect ratio. When released to theaters in 1959, the studio recommended projecting the image at 1.75:1, to satisy the public's growing appetite for widescreen movies. To give the illusion of this wider image, theaters often needed to crop films at that time, and some of the picture was not seen. The following presentation has not been cropped, and none of the original image has been lost""

According to the liner notes, this DVD is presented as it was shot, with no loss of visual information. I therefore formally *withdraw* my objections --in *this* case!

This dates from the time when Disney wasn't afraid to be dark and eerie.  The story balances whimsy with supernatural terrors and is appropriate for both Halloween and St. Patrick's Day.
This film lovingly depicts an Ireland of times gone by, and perhaps an Ireland that never truly was.  Nevertheless, the culture is saturated in fairy-tales and ghost stories, and everyone seems to believe.
A love letter to simple village life, and to the power of storytelling, and the Emerald Isle's vibrant and exuberant folklore.

765289,5,630402925X,"I first saw ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" when it was released in 1959 and I was 11.  I had seen the promotional episode of ""Walt Disney Presents"" and fell instantly in love.  My friends at the time tried to drag me off to see a ""sophisticated"" comedy playing elsewhere, but for once I refused to give in to peer pressure and insisted.  We went and when the film was over they were all chatting happily about the handsome, painfully young, delightfully callow, pre-Bond Sean Connory, in one of his first films playing Michael McBride--and singing!
I smiled inwardly.  They could and they can have him.  I was in love!  Not with the admittedly georgeous Connory but with the tiny, powerful, wonderful and surprisingly compassionate King Brian of the Leprechauns, charmingly portrayed (but not credited) by Jimmy O'Dea.  Now, 45 years later, I see no reason to change my opinion.
The reasons this film holds up over the decades are its respect for the subject matter (although occasionally it slips a bit by modern pc standards), non-computerized special effects that hold up amazingly well, good pacing and most of all an engaging, delightful story utterly lacking in car chases, explosions, bad language or graphic sex.
Darby O'Gill, the title character, could easily have been played to the stereotypes of the fighting, drunken Irishman.  But Darby's frequent visits to the pub are, as his daughter Katie (played by the adorable Janet Munro) explains, both for company and because he loves to tell stories.  Albert Sharpe plays Darby many layers deeper than one would expect in a Disney movie or a comedy.  Even as we laugh at his misadventures, we feel the abiding terror he has at the prospect of forced retirement, the loss of the house he and Katie have always lived in, a drastically reduced income and a diminished standing in the community.  Much of the story advances from Darby's misguided attempt to protect Katie from knowledge of the impending changes in their lives.
Outside the pub, Darby's other source of entertainment is his relentless pusuit of leprechaun gold.  Once he has been told that he must retire from his job and be pensioned at half pay, Darby's quest kicks into high gear.  The film only hints at how extremely dangerous this avocation actually is.  At first it seems like a harmless way for an old man to get a bit of exercise.  However, if one reads Irish folklore, one learns that the leprechauns have little reason to like humans.  The stories run riot with tales of how far a mortal will go to acquire fairy gold.  Even if you do not know these stories, it's well to reflect that to coerce a leprechaun into giving it up is still stealing and the leprechaun has as much right as anyone to protect himself and his property.
With this in mind, our first introduction to King Brian is through Darby's pub tale, in which--naturally--he plays himself as the hero, trapping the little monarch and forcing three wishes out of him.  However, as we learn, King Brian is five thousand years old, and quite experienced in tricking avaricious mortals.  Moreover, his tiny stature harbors enormous, almost unlimited magical power.
I fell in love with King Brian's patience with Darby, the amazing restraint he shows in the use of that power and the indignities he puts up with out of an undeclared affection for the old man he sees as possibly his only friend.  And there is no mistaking that those feelings are returned.
Indeed, there are subtle hints (you have to pay close attention to notice them) that King Brian has befriended others of Darby's line before and that he has an eye to the future when he offers to take a hand as matchmaker between Katie and Michael. Here, too, the sensitivity of the performance is low-key and multi-layered.
Clearly, Brian's restraint is based on his awarness that Darby's desire for the gold doesn't come from personal greed, but from deep, abiding love for Katie.  At the climax of the film, the ultimate sacrifice Darby unhesitatingly makes to protect her inspires Brian to make a sacrifice of his own.
Do I recommend this film?  I think it should be required viewing as a lesson that a film doesn't have to be violent or vulgar to entertain and stay with you for a lifetime.",1080345600,5,4246,4.7639836289222375

There was a huge guest list. The theatre was packed even though it held over 3500. Prior to Walt Disney making a short speech and the cast parading across the stage.

I've enjoyed a wide range of cinema all my life and yet every few years Darby O'Gill gets an airing and I feel better for it and considering I was only fifteen in 1959 that makes me feel even better!",1066521600,18,1138,4.177272727272728

As adults, my sister and I wondered if it would still hold up to us-- and it does, splendidly!  Soon my young niece will be introduced to this lilting Irish tale.  Only one lament:  When, oh when, will Disney put this one on dvd?  If anyone reads this review, please type in Darby O'Gill under the dvd search; it will tell you this item isn't currently available on dvd, but that you can enter your email address,",1051833600,4,532,4.3232323232323235
765375,5,630402925X,"I have just celebrated my 26th birthday and I have enjoyed this film for 20 years or more!  It never grows tiresome.  It is the tale of an old Irishman named Darby who is fortunate enough to be in aquaintance with the king of all the leprechauns, King Brian.  He and King Brian endure a battle of wits throughout the movie as Darby's stubborn daughter slowly falls in love with a VERY young Sean Connery!  It is a RIOT to see Sean so young and SINGING SONGS no less!  A word of caution:  I freaked out and had nightmares for years thanks to this movie.  There is a banshee that would be considered laughable by the current generation of Scream fans.  It is also a movie that has a great deal of dialogue, so it is better for children around 7 years and up.",1046822400,4,756,4.201388888888889
765376,4,630402925X,"This remains one of the all time best feature films from the Disney studio.  An unreliable but likeable old Irishman gets in trouble with the leprechauns, causing plenty of amusing (and even scary) complications.  Albert Sharpe is excellent in the title role, as is Sean Connery, in one of his earliest roles, as the handsome hero.  Special effects are excellent.  The hilite of the film is the banshee, which plenty of kids in 1959 (including this one) found plenty scary.",1039910400,3,473,4.875
765377,4,630402925X,"I love this movie.  We have it taped from TV, but the tape is wearing out.  We watch it so often here.  It is Sean Connery's first movie, and definately a jewel that few people know about.  Very cute story line with some drama, and supernatural fears.  The only reason I give it four stars is that at times, the accents make it somewhat hard to understand, but it does not take away from the greatness of this movie.",1033603200,4,416,4.215189873417722
765378,5,630402925X,This is a great movie to watch on St. Patrick's Day when everyone wants to be Irish.  A simple peasant meets the king of the leprochauns...will he get his gold?  His daughter falls in love with a very young and dashing Sean Connery!  A cute family film that appeals to all ages.  5 stars!,1024012800,3,288,4.277777777777778
765379,5,630402925X,"Oh why cant they make movies like this anymore? This is a wonderful movie and really does deserve to be called a movie that ""the whole family can enjoy"". This one has it all, comedy, drama, chills, suspence, singing, the whole shebang and not one wisecracking kid to be found. Not only does it feature a young suave Sean Connery but also the beautiful Janet Munro in one of the few films that she made. This movie is filled with myths and legends of Ireland and the special effects  stand up to anything being made today and this one was filmed over 40 years ago! You will love this one!",1018742400,14,587,4.336363636363636

765480,5,630402925X,"""Perfection"" is the word that comes to mind when I view this wonderful film about an old Irishman and his adventures with the Little People. Perfect directing, acting, editing, writing and special effects come together to create a magical tour-de-force that leaves the viewer with a sense of awe and appreciation for the man behind the movie, Walt Disney. Sean Connery, Albert Sharpe, Janet Munro, Estelle Winwwod, Jimmy O'Dea and Walter Fitzgerald deliver absolutely believable performances.
