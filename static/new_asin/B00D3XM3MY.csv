5773259,5,B00D3XM3MY,"Shatner's toupee goes where no wig has gone before -- into the private dwellings and thoughts of the actors who took over his famed Captain's chair!

These are the voyages of the Shat's Toupee: it's 21/2 hour mission, to boldy go where no star-rug has gone before!
Definitely for hard-core Trekkies, but, where those folks are concerned, a five-star effort, indeed.",1375228800,3,365,4.983606557377049
5773260,5,B00D3XM3MY,I think William Shatner is very William Shatner. He makes me laugh. I enjoyed his interactions with the other actors who played captains too.,1436832000,,141,4.916666666666667
5773261,5,B00D3XM3MY,Captains Close Up and Mind Meld are an enjoyable set of interviews. Recommended.,1436745600,,80,5.230769230769231
5773262,4,B00D3XM3MY,"Redundant in places, but good follow-up to the Captains.  Buy ""The Captains"" first; an excellent video.",1434499200,,103,5.4375
5773263,5,B00D3XM3MY,Entertaining look at the people we know as Star Trek's captains.,1432944000,,64,4.909090909090909
5773264,5,B00D3XM3MY,"Of the myriad works in the ""Trek Documentary"" category, this is one of the very best the genre has to offer.
The only other of its caliber (in my eyes) is the touching and personal ""Trek Nation""

Note that this ""Close Up"" edition is vastly superior to its TV-special predecessor, ""The Captains""

It devotes the time to connect with the actors as humans and affords the conversational space and safety for each to share some of their individuality and vulnerability.",1432339200,,465,4.8
5773265,4,B00D3XM3MY,"No review,I j ust enjoyed listenng to where the Captains are now",1429833600,,64,4.416666666666667

5773268,5,B00D3XM3MY,"Honestly, this DVD should've been part of ""The Captains"" to begin with; understand you needed to edit down the 1st film to fit broadcast limitations, but this material REALLY needed to be part of the whole, because it explained a great deal more behind these actors and how being in Star Trek affected them.

While some will pan William Shatner for being...William Shatner, this movie seems to be a breakthrough moment for him in really understanding what Star Trek (and Capt. Kirk) meant to the fans. (Unless he's that good of an actor and faking in...and in that case, give him some awards.)

The facts that fans don't seem to grok is how human all these people are, and that Trek was a moment in time for them, and a job, and that life carries on for them, and that all the glitz and glamor of fame aren't exactly what we civilians think they may be.

And, for you Avery Brooks haters...this extended interview with him is not to be missed. It's why, IMNSHO, The Sisko is the best of all the Trek captains.

If you're a Trek fan..get this DVD!",1422921600,3,1046,4.460732984293194

5773272,5,B00D3XM3MY,William Shatner presents a truly revealing program that shows that the actors who play the Captains of Star Trek are just as complex as their respective characters. This is a must see for all Trekkies and anyone who wants to learn about the philosophy and the people behind the inspiring franchise.,1413763200,,298,4.862745098039215

5773276,1,B00D3XM3MY,"Chris Pine is not Star Trek, he shouldn't appear on the cover.

Too bad, it could be a good book, but i would never ever support Abrams Star Trek destruction.",1400889600,,158,4.266666666666667
5773277,5,B00D3XM3MY,"I gave this five stars because it is a well don documentary about all the actors who played the part of Captain on the various Star Trek series.  William Shatner (Capt. Kirk) produced and directed this film.  His interviews are candid and insightful.  If you are a Trekker as I am, then this is a must have for your collection.",1400457600,,327,4.416666666666667
5773278,5,B00D3XM3MY,"I own both of these Star Trek Captains dvds by William Shatner and enjoyed them both, although much of the footage is similar.  Only William Shatner could have pulled off these very special interviews and I am glad he did!  It gave me a renewed respect for this wildly energetic, inventive man who I also fondly still remember as Captain Kirk.",1398211200,,343,4.60655737704918
5773279,5,B00D3XM3MY,"I found this a fitting sequel to ""The Captains"" which was previously released. The title describes it correctly. This is additional interview footage of William Shatner in interviews with the various actors that played captains in the various incarnations of the STAR TREK films and television series. If you liked the first film, you will like this one also. Very little is repeated compared to the new material that is not in the first film. I enjoyed the conversations and learned new things about the actors involved. My wife and I enjoyed it.",1395792000,3,547,4.89247311827957
5773280,3,B00D3XM3MY,"Captains Close Up admittedly is a little annoying for its double-dipping, as there was a shorter version of this--- but a prerequisite for someone to like a dvd like this of course is for someone who be really fascinated about actors and Star Trek in general. Since it is a double-dip, and since it looked like there was more (presumably) to the interviews, it would have been nice to have had more on this disc. Would have also been nice for Shatner to have had interviews with some of his co-stars about what they thought of him during his tenure on Trek- but since this is a Shatner production and since 3/4ths of the dvd cover has a giant closeup of him, it's foolish to NOT think that he would have treated his own 'mini-biography' with kid gloves. Would have been nice if there were a more objective director shooting this whole thing, but for what it is, we still get a lot of great tidbits (including one pretty horrible bit about how Kate Mulgrew was treated by Paramount and the execs on the last day of shooting Voyager) on very likeable actors that I didn't know about otherwise. Good..... but could have been even greater.",1390176000,5,1135,4.514563106796117
5773281,3,B00D3XM3MY,"This Dvd is basically a compliation of additional footage Shatner had used in previous ""The Captains"" Dvd.
Its a little better organized, but not as quite as entertaining. There's much less of Chris Pine featured in this
Dvd, however, and more of Shatner talking about being ""Captain Kirk"" instead. I would recommend you buy
this Dvd only if you are a hardcore Star Trek fan. This really should have been a ""The Captains"" 2-disk set.",1390089600,2,433,4.786666666666667
5773282,5,B00D3XM3MY,This is a must for all Trekkies and anyone else who likes William Shatner or any of the actors who have played Star Trek Captains from the Original series to the present alternate time line movies.  Highly Recommended!!,1389571200,,219,4.7631578947368425
5773283,4,B00D3XM3MY,"And yes William Shatner interrupts the other captains once or twice or even more, but still he extracts lots of new information",1388620800,,127,4.818181818181818
5773284,5,B00D3XM3MY,Shatner's interview with Patrick Stewart will get even the most Klingon among us all teary-eyed. I enjoyed the insight into the lives of the actors who portrayed my on-screen heroes. Well done!,1387756800,,193,5.0625
5773285,5,B00D3XM3MY,"When William Shatner does a documentary, he puts a lot into it. I was very amazed. He visited with each of the Star Trek Captain actors including Chris Pine, Kate Mulgrew, Avery Brooks, and Scott Bakula. Each interview is very interesting and Shatner is a fun and engaging interviewer. This is not one measly hour documentary; it contains several hours of interviewing and it is fun to get to know each of the actors a little more.",1387670400,,431,4.6103896103896105
5773286,5,B00D3XM3MY,William Shatner and the captains - how could any trekkie not enjoy this. Love seeing and hearing from them all.,1384300800,,111,4.6
5773287,5,B00D3XM3MY,Very well put together and gives the deatails and edited footage that was cut out from the original. I like Shatners approach to this very much.,1383782400,,144,4.576923076923077
5773288,4,B00D3XM3MY,A good interview process of the various Star Trek Captains.  Provides an understanding of the choices each actor made with their parts and careers.,1383523200,,147,5.125
5773289,5,B00D3XM3MY,"Shatner, aka JT Kirk TOS, gathers the Star Trek Captains for another session
of bantering, discussion, and fun about Star Trek.  Great tie-in to the most recent Star Trek movie in 2013.",1381104000,,185,4.78125
5773290,5,B00D3XM3MY,"Listen up, Trekkies. This DVD is a great trip through captains' logs with William Shatner as he interviews most of the captains of the well-known series. A great and affordable gift for true fans.",1380672000,,196,4.794117647058823
5773291,5,B00D3XM3MY,"Video by William Shatner interviewing all of the Star Trek Captains from the TV series after ST-TOS.

Very well done and it holds your attention throughout. This is a recommended purchase for all Star Trek fans and it's not just about Shatner.",1379808000,3,243,4.785714285714286
5773292,5,B00D3XM3MY,"I love Bill's style and frankness. He is a warm, generous person who tries to be objective. I love all his work and respect him for the willingness to try anything.",1379721600,,164,4.32258064516129
5773293,5,B00D3XM3MY,"I already own the original Captains documentary, but I was intrigued by this new edit. I actually liked it better, as it broke each captain down by segment, which I found easier to watch. I found the interviews interesting and engaging. My only complaint would be that I think Chris Pine should have had his own segment, instead of being lumped in with Shatner. He is the captain that I know the least about and I would have liked an in-depth interview with him as well. All in all, great DVD.",1379548800,,493,4.428571428571429
5773294,5,B00D3XM3MY,"Wow! Loved it (and didn't expect to before watching it). It is a very powerful film. Shows what the captains are really made of and what makes them strong and successful. Keep it up Mr. Shatner, you keep getting better at this stuff!",1379376000,,233,4.441860465116279
5773295,3,B00D3XM3MY,"While some of the anecdotes in the interviews were nice, the style was too flashy and choppy.  There wasn't a real flow inside the individual segments.",1379116800,,151,4.8076923076923075
5773296,5,B00D3XM3MY,"This was a delightful documentary, as is anything Star Trek in my opinion, but then I've been a Trek fan since the 1st series aired in the late 1960's. This film brought to light some of the more personal details concerning the lives of the actors, what their influences were while growing up, how their interests in acting were sparked, what their childhoods were like, the sacrifices and decisions made during the years of filming the various shows, and how those impacted their lives personally and professionally.

And best of all it revealed who they have morphed into today, which is something most Star Trek fans would like to keep up with. All in all this was not only entertaining but provided a somewhat more sensitive and intimate glimpse into the lives of all of our favorite Star Trek captains. I look forward to seeing more of these documentary updates.

You do have more on the way, right, Mr. Shatner? And how about one featuring all the first officers?",1379116800,,969,4.727810650887574
5773297,5,B00D3XM3MY,"I suppose you need to be a true trekkie to appreciate the content of this mini-series fully.  It is almost entirely new content not previously used in the earlier movie release,""The Captains"".",1378080000,6,192,5.0
5773298,5,B00D3XM3MY,This is actually an update and more in-depth version of an earlier documentary done by William Shatner and it does a good job of adding on to the previous stories of the actors that have sat in the center chair.  A must for any Star Trek fan.  Highly recommended.,1377993600,8,263,4.346938775510204
5773299,5,B00D3XM3MY,"This is 99% new content and not a rehash of Shatner's wonderful 2012 documentary entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Captains/dp/B005WM5YR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Captains</a>&nbsp;The format is 30 minute segments on the 5 Captains; Shatner; Stewart, Mulgrew, Brooks and Bakula (New Captain Kirk, Chris Pine is seen in the Shatner half hour) so we get 2.5 hours of every Captain!

In addition it's not just Shatner in the half hour segments.  They are beautifully woven together to tell a story  from a 360 degree viewpoint augmented by other actors from the series as well as production team members from the series.  This is a very comprehensive and thoroughly enjoyable production for any fan of the Star Trek series.

William Shatner has pulled off a coup yet again!",1376265600,29,830,5.8264462809917354
