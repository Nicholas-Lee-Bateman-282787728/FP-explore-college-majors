It is overall a good movie, Geist is a very interesting character.  The basic plot is very quick and is merely a prequel of things to come.",977788800,,288,4.480769230769231
7862946,1,6304123434,"If they call this an anime, I say: WHAT A SHAME!  Not only is this movie too short, it's got bad voices for every single charicter, lousy animation (But that's just cause it's an 80's show), and does every voice need to  ecco?  If that's not bad enough, all the acting was more lousy than the  animation.  Plus the plot is not well develiped.  Don't even rent this  movie.",955670400,,372,4.304347826086956
7862947,3,6304123434,"Not bad...it's ok for what it is, a story about a generic loner guy who comes to the aid of the underdogs. Some cool mecha stuff at the end, but my main gripw with this movie is it's too short. i don't even think it's an  hour long. Which means there's no development of Geist (who could be a very  interesting character) or anything else. All this stuff just happens. The  end was sort of confusing, a bunch of stuff just happens and you're like  'what?' but a lot of anime is like that. If you like Mad Max, this is a LOT  like it. But a lot of other animes dealt with the perfect-fighter idea and  its ramifications a lot more smoothly, like Armitage III and Ghost in the  Shell. This isn't bad though, theres enough cool stuff to make it  worthwhile. This is a great movie to just sit and not care about the story  (there's not much of one) and just go ""cool! he cut that guy's arms  off!"" Geist kicks major a$$ in the hour he's on your TV, so that's  cool. He's just not very deep, at least from what i got out of it.",951782400,,1022,4.06
