2764745,4,B000ND91Z4,"If you are a Danny Kaye fan you will like this one.  Not his usual crazy antics but fast paced.  I hope his movies will continue to be released.  I'm looking forward to ""Merry Andrew.""",1213142400,,184,4.2
2764746,3,B000ND91Z4,"danny kaye, like so many comics from another era, is an acquired taste. his quirky faces, his voice that could accelerate from a soft high tenor to a keening wail in a matter of seconds and word driven patter songs were probably perfect on a 1940s broadway or nightclub stage. because, well, you can't clone someone live and in person--at least not outside the cirque du soleil.

but this film gives you two kayes in the third official remake of the fox musical 'folies bergere', which had to have been inspired by the lunt-fontanne classic 'the guardsman'. kaye, in the dual roles of a philandering head of state and the philandering nightclub entertainer that impersonates him, is overcompensating for his non present female leads.  there is gene tierney as the trophy wife of the figurehead who has nothing more to do than look smashing in her array of lemaire gowns. the lush 1950s technicolor cinematography serves her raven haired beauty well. this role does not.  then there is corinne calvet who was fairly new to films as the fiancee of the entertainer.  she's pretty and overwhelmed by the fact that carmen miranda played her role in the 1941 version.

'on the riviera' is saved by jack cole's undersung choreography of the musical numbers, which feature his magically rapturous versions of east indian dance, nice tight groupings of toned, well-trained cole-style dancers and gwen verdon, minutes before she would take broadway on in michael kidd's choreography for 'can-can'. even though verdon's unique voice is dubbed, her body is not. she is a curvy, voluptuous delight as she leads the ensemble in the opening of the first number. her dancing is clean and precise and oh so feminine.  she is a knock-out!  if only she had gotten the calvet role...",1211328000,,1763,4.895973154362416

Danny Kaye is a very verstile entertainer who can sing, dance and act.  He really pulls off the double role he plays as an entertainer and a wealthy man who has a reputation as a ladies man.  A couple of the songs in this movie harken back to my childhood and enhances the enjoyment of this movie.  A must see!",1182902400,6,525,5.67948717948718
2764752,5,B000ND91Z4,"This is probably one of the most underrated movies of all time.

Alright, some of the musical sequences are dated - especially the ""Rhythm of a new romance""-number - but the dialogue and the story are still extremely witty and funny. And it's Danny Kaye at his best. Not as brilliant as in ""The Court Jester"" three years later, but more mature and refined than in ""The secret Life of Walther Mitty"" (which is a great movie, too!), Kaye gives a wonderful performance as  nightclub entertainer Jack Martin (""Ballin' the Jack"" and ""Happy Ending"" are just wonderful). And he plays  rich aviator Henri Duran who neglects his wife and only comes to his senses when he thinks that she's betraying him with Martin. Kaye is believeable in both parts.

""On the Riviera"" is a very entertaining musical comedy and it makes fun of every glamour clich ever used in Hollywood.

Highly recommended!",1181606400,28,882,4.776315789473684

2764786,3,B000ND91Z4,"It's a shame that a huge number of once great Hollywood stars will be forgotten or completely unknown to a new generation. Those of us who grew up with them will remember them but for a while we had no outlet to see them once again. Thanks to TCM we get that opportunity. But what about fans of certain stars and their desire to own copies of movies they remembered? That's recently changed as well as studios are bringing out titles in great number. Not only that, they're doing so in blu-ray so you get the best quality as well. Case in point ON THE RIVIERA starring Danny Kaye.

Kaye is best remembered by some for WHITE CHRISTMAS but those of us old enough to recall remember him from movies like THE COURT JESTER and his TV series, back when variety shows actually aired. He was an all around talent, able to sing, dance and do comedy like few others. All of that is on display in this film.

Kaye plays two roles in this one: Jack Martin, a nightclub performer in France trying to make it big and Henri Duran, a French aviator/industrialist who just made a trip in his newest plane design. Duran is also quite the womanizer, much to the chagrin of his wife Lili (Gene Tierney). The thing about both men is that they look amazingly alike, something even Henri's wife notices at a performance Jack puts on.

When the backer of Henri's new design tries to wedge himself in to take over the company, Henri must fly to London to discuss the possibilities of a new backer. But if he does so it means the backer in France will know that he has him on the ropes. Henri's partners come up with a plan to save the day: get Jack to pose as Henri during a party. Plans like these always sound simple but rarely become so.

Jack's partner and girlfriend Colette isn't fond of the idea, especially since she noticed Jack had an eye for Lili. While Lili is aware that Jack is posing as Henri, Jack thinks she has no idea claiming if she knew he'd be too nervous to pull it off. Some harmless flirting ensues but not much more. Other troubles arise when Jack is pulled into a closed door meeting with the backer, Henri returns early, Jack must leave the party to perform on TV and Collette shows up at the Duran house during a party. It all ends well with everyone straightened out by the final reel.

What the movie does for Kaye fans is give them a chance to see him doing what he does best. The musical numbers are well performed from choreography to the songs chosen. His dancing has never seemed more seamless. His singing is up to par with others from this time period. And the laughs are there, though perhaps not as much as in some of his other films.

The best thing about this release is that fans have the chance to own another classic Kaye and locate it on their shelves. While this falls into the category of sexual comedies there is nothing remotely tasteless or over the top as is seen today. Instead we get some laughs and the chance to enjoy an adult comedy that stays within bounds. Gone are the days.",1393372800,5,3009,4.345195729537367
2764787,5,B000ND91Z4,"On of Danny Kaye's best films and this transfer leaves nothing to be wished for. Clear, crisp and vibrant video and audio. It also has a documentary and comes in a nice slipcase with a little booklet that gives some fun facts about the film.",1391990400,,241,4.377777777777778
2764788,4,B000ND91Z4,"CONFESSION TIME: Ive had a thing for Danny Kaye ever since I saw him in White Christmas, dancing with the sublime Vera-Ellen. What a surprise to find out hed never studied dancing. Daddy never had a dancing lesson, daughter Dena Kaye tells us in A Portrait of Danny Kaye, one of three bonus features included on this high-def restoration from 20th Century Fox.

A high school dropout, Kaye was a naturally gifted comedian, dancer, actor, symphony conductor, and TV personality. He learned to pilot jets and studied to become an excellent Chinese chef. As a humanitarian, Kaye was one of the first to use his celebrity status as an energetic advocate for UNICEF, accepting the Nobel Peace Prize on its behalf, and earning a place in the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records for visiting 65 cities in five days on a UNICEF good-will tour.

On the Riviera offers as much substance as a vanilla Frappuccino. The ultra-light plot is based on a play, The Red Cat, that became the source for two earlier films, Folies Bergre (1935) and That Night in Rio (1941)  and later, On the Double (1961)  about two men who look so much alike, they can switch identities without anyone knowing the difference.

Kaye, playing the two parts in Riviera, is cast as nightclub performer Jack Martin, who looks like French industrialist-aviator Henri Duran, well known for his womanizing ways. We first see Duran on that new contraption, the television, being met on landing by two ravishing girlfriends  and his equally ravishing wife, played by Gene Tierney (Laura, 1944).

Jack is hired by Duran to impersonate him at a party he wants to skip. Wives and girlfriends are thrown into the mix along with an unscrupulous business associate; mishaps and misunderstandings happen. Dialogue is light and witty, although many of the musical numbers seem dated, with the exception of the sly Ballin the Jack. Popo the Puppet, however, is better suited to a childrens film; its an amazing leap to imagine this being performed in a nightclub.

Many of the songs, including Popo, On the Riviera, Rhythm of a New Romance, and Happy Ending, were written by Sylvia Fine, Kayes wife.

Most of this Technicolor oldie looks great  especially the blue of the opening beach scene and Kayes bright eyes. Then we get some noticeable fluctuation, particularly in skin tones. Aside from that, everything looks beautiful, particularly the stunning costumes. Sound also comes across well with clear dialogue and impressive musical numbers choreographed by Jack Cole. (Look for a young Gwen Verdon in The Rhythm of a New Romance.)

In addition to bonus features The Riviera Story, A Remarkable Impersonation and A Portrait of Danny Kaye, look for The Jack of Clubs: Choreographer Jack Cole. Hes known as the father of American jazz dance. A demanding and exacting dance master, Cole understood Broadway musicals, but also loved ethnic melodies and dancing. He is probably best known for the musical Kismet, and for teaching Marilyn Monroe the famous Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend number.

Still, hes also the guy who came up with the idea for the Popo number. You cant win em all.",1389830400,,3134,4.9147727272727275
2764789,5,B000ND91Z4,"I am a big fan of Danny Kaye - Court Jester has been in the top ten of my favorite movies since I was a child trying to make sense of the chalice from the palace. But ON THE RIVIERA is a new discovery for me and a wonderful delight. It is  witty and heart-warming - everything you expect from a Danny Kaye movie. The features are very good as well: a good discussion of this version in comparison with the two versions before it, a good biography of Danny Kaye including his daughter's comments and an interesting piece on the choreographer and his contribution to this film and other famous musicals. The icing on the cake is that it is in blu-ray and very good considering it is over 60 years old. You can see a major difference in the featurettes where scenes of the movie are in the regular dvd format. The colors of the blu-ray are real eye candy especially in the production numbers and the outdoor scenes. I am thrilled to find that there are still gems like this one around and being given the attention Danny Kaye deserves. Highly recommended to musical comedy fans.",1388620800,,1075,4.402010050251256

2764791,5,B000ND91Z4,"There are already 22 reviews posted here for this title, and I won't waste your time repeating most of the info but hope to clarify a few things for those looking for this fun film.

First, it is important to note that in MOST cases, Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL releases of a classic film together, whether Blu-ray or DVD- ignoring the fact that some titles have been remastered or updated. That's the case here. If you look at the ""most helpful"" review you will see that it is from the 2007 DVD release, not the BD. So I always recommend that potential buyers sort the reviews by ""Newest First"" (there is an option.) And look for the format that the reviewer is reviewing.

That said, this is a review of the newly released Blu-ray version of the film. It's one of the many being released this year for the Danny Kaye Centennial.  The image and color are great and so - of course - is Kaye. But if you have the 2007 DVD version you should know that the bonus features are the same as the DVD release. They are excellent however. There are three: 1) the featurette comparing the film to other ""impersonator films"" like ""That Night in Rio"" (with Don Ameche) (10  minutes), 2) a wonderful 26 minute ""Portrait of Danny Kaye"" and 3) A featurette on choreographer Jack Cole (10 minutes).

My favorite Kaye films are ""Hans Christian Andersen"", ""The Five Pennies"" and ""A Song is Born"" (the latter two are ""jazz films"" and feature Louis Armstrong duets  with  Louis Armstrong. But all are great.

For this centennial year The following Danny Kaye classics will be available on DVD and Blu-Ray
this fall:

DANNY KAYE: THE GOLDWYN YEARS:
UP IN ARMS
WONDER MAN
THE KID FROM BROOKLYN
A SONG IS BORN

2 DISC COLLECTIONS:
THE COURT JESTER and THE FIVE PENNIES

DVD:
THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY
WHITE CHRISTMAS

BLU-RAY:
ON THE RIVIERA
KNOCK ON WOOD
I'll try to review as many as I can upon their release.

I Hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

2764792,5,B000ND91Z4,"What more can be said about Danny Kaye?  So many reviewers have stated that he is one the most underrated actors of all time.  I had no idea that he was so underrated until I started looking for his films on DVD.  WHAT'S THE DAEL? REALLY? They're either out of print or not available, I don't get it.  I grew up watching his old films on TV and have a lot of them still on VHS, and decided it was time to start getting the DVDs.  He's one of (if not thee) greatest talents in film history.  I read an article this year that stated his daughter was excited about all of his films being released... where are they?  ""On The Riviera"" is top-notch, some have said that it is uneven, I disagree, it's great all the way through.  Gene Tierney is excellent and beautiful as she always is (look for her portrait from ""Laura"" hanging in the house) and the whole cast is strong and funny.  Danny is absolutely suave in this double-role and his timing is as always perfect.  This DVD has a clear picture and the sound is clean (I'm not a print quality maniac, but it looks very good to me.)  The extras are really awesome and worth watching, pick this DVD up before they discontinue it as well!",1382918400,4,1183,4.260089686098655
2764793,5,B000ND91Z4,"I've long-enjoyed Danny Kaye's films, but was unfamiliar with ""On the Riviera"".  It's really good!  It takes about 20-minutes for the story to get going, due to a series of musical numbers, but then it's a funny and clever plot.  Danny Kaye is excellent playing a nightclub entertainer and his look-alike, a womanizing pilot (the same story had been filmed twice-before, first with Maurice Chevalier and second with Don Ameche).  If you like ""The Court Jester"", ""Knock on Wood"", and ""The Inspector General"", I'm sure you'll enjoy ""On the Riviera"".
This DVD has a fine-quality restored print and lots of special features, including a biography of Kaye's life with interviews of friends and family.",1371600000,2,696,5.078947368421052

2764807,4,B000ND91Z4,"1951's ""On The Riviera"" is a classy affair for the talented Danny Kaye, albeit, a slightly more somber one. Filmed twice before (with Maurice Chevalier and Don Ameche in the lead), Kaye does a fine job as a nightclub entertainer who bares a strong resemblance to a dashing French aviator (also Kaye, of course), and is eventually tapped to impersonate him for an important function. This gives the entertainer the chance to get to know the cavalier aviator's rather neglected wife (Gene Tierney).
As usual, there are some pleasing musical moments from Kaye (his wife Sylvia Fine composed once again). However, being more sophisticated & subtle, Kaye has to play it semi-serious, so this one might not appeal to all viewers, although it's still an extremely pleasant film.
The DVD transfer preserves the movie's splashy scenery, filled with plenty of lush ""eye candy"" Riviera shots. But seeing how this film's been out of circulation for a long time, it's worth adding to your Kaye collection!",1321056000,2,992,5.0181818181818185

2764811,5,B000ND91Z4,"On the Riviera thoroughly displays the amazing talent of Danny Kaye as he doubles most convincingly as an entertainer and the flirtatious fellow the actor is paid to emulate, since they look so very alike.  Danny Kaye is one of the very few that acted from the heart and can carry you unabashedly to tears at the moment of painful truth with him or clown around and behave so absolutely slapstick silly you cannot stop roaring!  Few actors have ever been so gifted with talent in all areas as this man and to see him in action is a great privilege, even from the movie screen.

8176762,3,B000ND91Z4,"On the Riviera is the third film made from a stage play called The Red Cat, the other two being L'homme des Folies Bergre (1935) with Maurice Chevalier and That Night in Rio (1941) with Don Ameche. The plot is an example of a genre that goes right back to Plautus and Shakespeare: the comedy and confusion that result when two people who happen to look identical keep getting mistaken for each other. In this case, the two people (both played by Danny Kaye) are a famous French transatlantic aviator and an American entertainer playing a club on the French Riviera. This seems like a very obscure film: it's not found in any of the half-dozen standard film guides I happen to have, though it's in IMDb.

The film, directed by Hollywood workmanlike director Walter Lang (who made a number of other 50s musicals, like this one now mostly forgotten,) is a semi-musical; that is, there are plenty of song and dance numbers, but they are all stage performances. The most interesting aspect of the film is its display of Kaye's multiple talents as a singer, dancer, comic and impressionist -- he's the sort of performer popular in the thirties through early sixties, but now seems an almost extinct species.

The film is an interesting period piece for its sumptuous female fashions and as an early example of what would become mainstream American Hollywood musical entertainment, and if you are interested in those topics, or in Kaye, this will be worth watching. Others may find it only moderately entertaining. There is some impressive landscape photography of the Riviera, though Hitchcock did this better in To Catch a Thief.

If this had been the first Danny Kaye movie I had seen, I'd probably be giving it 5 stars but it isn't as entertaining or appealing as some of his stellar hits, like The Court Jester,  Merry Andrew, The Inspector General or Hans Christian Andersen. It's a much tamer story, more like the role he played in The Five Pennies but more predictable and formulaic. It's still very appealing but it doesn't reach the stellar heights that many of his other movies reach. I am proud to have it in my collection, though.",1459987200,,594,4.5514018691588785
