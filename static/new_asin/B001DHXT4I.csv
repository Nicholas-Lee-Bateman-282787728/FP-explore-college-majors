3529818,5,B001DHXT4I,"Gomer Pyle was one of the better tv comedies. Far better than anything you can find in the modern tv wasteland.
Jim Nabors and Frank Sutton had a wonderful comedic chemistry that never failed to get a good laugh. Comedy teams of this sort
go way back, but only a few are as good or better than these two. Lucille Ball and Gale Gordon as Lucy and Mr. Mooney in The Lucy
Show come to mind as being their equals.
You won`t be disappointed with this dvd set. Five years worth of laughs as Gomer drives sgt. Carter off his rocker. You couldn`t
ask for much more.",1261180800,19,557,4.214953271028038
3529819,5,B001DHXT4I,It's amazing how well this old series stands the test of time. The duo of Jim Nabors as Pyle and Frank Sutton as the long suffering Sgt Carter are a great team. This type of acting is more theatrical than the glib style of more recent sitcoms and a welcome change. And the picture and sound quality are phenomenal!,1258588800,13,314,4.338983050847458
3529820,5,B001DHXT4I,I can't get enough. I just started watching the DVD's and the quality is great. The shows are funny and entertaining and I am not a fan of black & white TV but I enjoy the Gomer Pyle USMC first season in B & W also. The shipping was prompt. Highly recommend this TV series complete set.,1248393600,3,286,4.035087719298246
3529821,5,B001DHXT4I,"Before I purchase any Gomer DVD's, I need some help.
I noticed the individual seasons 2-5 for purchase do not say complete, however in the whole collection season 1-5 it states complete seasons 1-5.  Does anyone know if these are in fact complete? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",1244160000,2,296,4.803921568627451

He said that Sgt. Carter is 'good'. I think he might be considered 'soft' in today's Marine bootcamp!  Enjoy!",1232323200,4,286,4.181818181818182

In our humble opinion there isn't anything being produced these days that is anywhere close to the quality of comedy. Good clean family laughs to make your side ache!,1435881600,,514,4.255102040816326

3529864,4,B001DHXT4I,"This is one of the rare instances in television where a series actually improved as it went along from season to season.

The first year of this show, in my opinion, is practically unwatchable. For starters, it's in black and white. Don't get me wrong, I love black and white; but for some reason or another, black and white didn't work as well as color for this series. Secondly, the series for the first year pretty much entirely took place on the military base. It gave the show a claustrophobic feeling. Thirdly, most of the episodes in the first year consisted of Carter and Pyle going at it. Don't misunderstand. They're hilarious when they're going at it, but in this case you have too much of a good thing.

Starting with the second season, the show switched to color, which was a big relief. And the episodes from time to time began to take place off of the military base, which was even a bigger relief. Another improvement that took place was that the series began to give more time and attention to the supporting cast, including Corporal Boyle, Colonel Gray (Carter's superior), and Duke Slater (played by the excellent Ronnie Schell). In other words, it wasn't just one episode after another of Carter and Pyle going at it. Not that Carter and Pyle should have stopped going at it, because that's something you never really got tired of. Finally, beginning in the second and third years of the series, they introduced the girlfriends. This is when things really began to start hopping. Bunny (played by Barbara Stuart) was Sgt. Carter's steady girl, and Lou-Ann Poovie (Elizabeth MacRae) eventually became Gomer's girl, after some hesitation. Very little surprise here that the girlfriend episodes worked so well. The series was very lucky to have the team of Everett Greenbaum and Jim Fritzell writing for it. That team had also written girlfriend episodes for The Andy Griffith Show (Helen and Thelma Lou) and later went on to write some excellent episodes for M*A*S*H.

The series also improved over the years in the way that the writers gradually made Gomer more intelligent and worldly and competent AND CALM (my emphasis). In fact, eventually the tables began to turn and Gomer would actually help Carter solve his problems. What a turnaround!

I don't want to forget to mention that, later on in the series, they started bringing aboard big-name guest stars such as Jerry Van Dyke and also invented characters played by relatively unknown actors that existed outside Gomer's small circle (e.g., do you remember the terrific episode where Gomer's new friend, a kindly elderly Jewish lady, ended up cooking dinner at her apartment for the entire platoon?). I thought that those additions worked quite well and helped keep the show fresh.",1420502400,3,2756,4.882478632478633

Every episode will have you laughing and looking forward to the next.",1400198400,,397,4.410958904109589
3529953,5,B001DHXT4I,"I was pleasantly surprised of how well the episodes were written that were both funny and helped me to learn a little about the Marine Corp and the military in general. This show almost made you want to join the Marine Corp as long as you would be in the Second Platoon B Company squad with Gomer Pyle and Sergeant Carter. I can relate more as an adult to this show rather than when I was a kid watching it as reruns.

These DVDs are definitely well worth buying all of the episodes at once. The DVDs are all one sided discs and have individually packed seasons instead of stacked discs like some of the other complete TV series programs are doing today. The DVDs have some good extras of the Jim Nabors show and the Doris Day show. Other than that, the discs are basic episodes of Gomer Pyle without the commercials with good divisions to help jump into the episode if you want to skip the introduction. I only wish that they had vintage commercials when it was originally broadcast as an extra to the DVD.

Jim Nabors and Frank Sutton are very talented actors that had a great chemistry together. I had seen a lot of familiar actors before they became famous in these episodes also. I liked the vibrant colors of the film in those shows back then. It looked as if they used a very high quality transformation from well preserved original film like it would have been made today instead of back in the 1960s on the color episodes. This the best digital remastering I have seen among my classic comedy 1960s show collection.

Well worth the investment considering that cable keeps on going up in price and never has anything good on. Buying all five seasons is the price of one month's cable if not less than one month's cable bill without the commercials and the convenience of watching it when you want to.",1397606400,5,1808,4.45619335347432

I grew up watching the Andy Griffith Show and the Gomer Pyle Show. Nice packaging with all 5 seasons in one set! Amazon really came through for me on this set. I absolutely love this show and it brings wonderful memories back to me when television shows didn't have all stupid immoral things like what's in today shows.,1388620800,2,451,4.580246913580247

3529977,4,B001DHXT4I,"I can confirm in at least one episode they did not transfer the episode in its entirety.  Apparently they transferred a syndicated version of the show which were edited to add more commercials.

In the episode from Season 4, Jerry Van Dyke guest stars as a banjo player at a night club.  The episode starts off with Gomer clapping after Van Dyke's banjo solo.  There were 1-2 minutes cut out from Van Dyke's banjo solo.  The same thing happens again during Van Dyke's second appearance.  I was very disappointed his banjo playing was edited, and the context of the episode was lost by having the episode start with Gomer clapping after his performance because the viewer doesn't really get to see the extent of Jerry Van Dyke's proficiency on the banjo.

I have to assume since they edited this episode most if not all the other episodes in Season 4 are edited.  I hope this isn't the case with the other four seasons, but I'm not holding my breath on this.

Gomer Pyle, U.S.MC. is classic TV at its best.  I wish CBS transferred the full unedited versions of this series to disc instead of giving us the syndicated versions.",1388102400,4,1125,4.58

I don't think they are all the way through this complete set yet but we have seen several of the episodes more than once, because one of the kids would miss one or so for whatever reason so we will go back and watch it again for the person that missed that particular episode.

As to the discs, the remastering is great. The colors look sharp (for their time), and the audio is clear with no hiss. All episodes are complete and uncut, unedited. Sha-zay-am!!",1366675200,13,447,4.5875
3530001,5,B001DHXT4I,"Anyone not very familiar with this series should know that Gomer Pyle is a spinoff from the Andy Griffith show. Jim Nabors made a few guest appearances on Andy Griffith and not long afterwards producer Sheldon Leonard as well as Griffith himself knew Nabors is a winning comic. Indeed they were right. Gomer Pyle had a five year run with the first season in black and white. Frank Sutton played the loud but lovable Sergeant Carter. I would recommend this series if you want to find a sitcom that actually is clean, family oriented and funny. There are a few episodes in the series where the folks in Mayberry do make an appearance. In one episode, Andy Taylor's son Opie actually makes an appearance on base where Andy also appears at the end of the episode. Jim Nabors gives audio introductions to the first season episodes and it also includes the pilot from the Andy Griffith show when Andy goes with him as he enters the marine corp. Do yourself a favor and pick up this series. It will easily put a smile on your face and will more likely give you some wonderful laughs.",1366329600,3,1076,4.523076923076923

A funny plot, good writing, and a funny lighthearted comedy situation that always made you laugh.  Jim Nabors gave everything he had to be this dumb and convince people he was a complete misfit. Then he got smarter as time went on.  Sound and picture was great and it was well worth the money.  I paid close to 50 for this set and thought it was a good deal.

His simple, humorous, naive, chivalrous, charming and delightful personality is what carries this show episode after episode. The home spun hilarity keeps our family laughing! Sgt. Carter tries his best to hate Gomer, but he can't because of the goodness and kindness of heart Gomer showers him with. Hollywood just can't make shows like this anymore! In our opinion, there is nothing on TV today that is better than the clean good-natured fun that is brought forth in this series.

3530018,5,B001DHXT4I,"GOMER PYLE-USMC: After two scene stealing seasons as the eternally cheerful filling station attendant on THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, JIM NABORS graduated to his own smash series GOMER PYLE-USMC; his naive do-gooding military bumpkin was a direct descendent of GRIFFITH's own breakthrough portrayal of NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS' green private WILL STOCKDALE. In stark contrast to PYLE's gentle, wide eyed Marine given to oubursts such as ""Gol-leee!"" and ""Shazam!"" was his bellowing bulldog of a drill instructer SGT. CARTER, beautifully overplayed by FRANK SUTTON. Most military sitcoms from MCHALE'S NAVY to M*A*S*H relied on large ensemble casts, but GOMER was basically a two man affair, a weekly showdown between teacher and pupil (it was often hard to tell which was which) with the hard headed sergeant regularly sucked into PYLE's unassuming vortex of incorruptability and human kindness. Viewers of all ages were sucked in as well, as GOMER PYLE marched to top ratings for five funny seasons, a snappy salute to one of the sixties' best written, well acted, most enjoyable sitcoms...surprise, surprise, surprise.

3530037,5,B001DHXT4I,"When I see a classic TV series so good that I can watch the episodes over and over, it merits a review.  I've watched the entire series twice and am ready to go another round anytime.  Jim Nabors' Gomer Pyle series fills many hours with great joy and laughs.  Not only do I enjoy Jim Nabors and Frank Sutton, but a lot of favorite, classic stars have guest appearances throughout the series:  Carol Burnett (2), ""Andy Taylor, Aunt Bea, Opie Taylor,"" Ruta Lee, Don Rickles, Allan Melvin (who was not household name but in so many classic TV shows you will immediately recognize him), and more.  The Carol Burnett episodes are hilarious.  Any surprise?  I have only two negative issues with the series:  Lou Anne's southern accent was so over-exaggerated, it makes my Deep South eyes roll (but her clothes were awesome); and some of the plots in the later seasons remind me of plots from the Andy Griffith Show.  Were they running out of material?  Even so, these are minor, minor issues.  I adore the series!  If only we were all as honest and innocent as Gomer Pyle.  For all of the trouble his un-relenting honesty, trust and innocence caused, it always worked out for the good.  The quality of the picture is great.  The first season is black and white.  Seasons 2 - 5 are in color.  In the first season, Jim Nabors recorded a short synopsis of each episode.  The set includes one episode from the Jim Nabors Hour with Frank Sutton and Ronnie Schnell.
