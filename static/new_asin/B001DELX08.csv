3529024,3,B001DELX08,"This otherwise excellent production was annoyingly flawed by out of balance sound. The orchestra would often drown out the singing. I like to listen with the sound a bit loud. If I set the sound volume to get the singing where I wanted it at a loud part, the orchestra would at times be deafeningly loud and force the turning down of the volume. So I was forced to watch the performance with the sound turned down so far that the singing seemed like it was recorded with the microphone too far away from the singer. Sad. If they ever fix this, they also ought to reduce the loudness of the applause.",1230595200,12,599,4.357142857142857
3529025,4,B001DELX08,"Four and 1/2 stars actually, if Amazon provided that option. The sets, costumes, conducting, and singing of Vargas and Frontali are as fine as the other commentators here have claimed them to be. I draw the line, though, at the raving over Gheorghiu. It's unusual ever to hear the role of Violetta sung anywhere near close to perfection, and one doesn't experience it, sorry to say, in Gheorghiu's performance. The role calls for a prima donna assoluta, and what may have been intended by this designation was that great rarity, a singer who combined the coloratura skills demanded in Act I with the large, warm body of tone called for in Acts II and III. The role calls, that is, for a Galli-Curci coupled with a Tebaldi. It is in the demands of Act I that Gheorghiu falls way short of ideal. Nobody, I believe, would seriously argue that her ""Sempre Libera"" in this performance is one of extraordinary brilliance. Though the emotional scene preceding it is convincing, the aria itself is marred by coloratura passages more gulped or yelped than beautifully or memorably sung. One can argue that the aria's concluding top note is only an option, but it doesn't follow that its absence is therefore not a disappointment, since it provides a perfect climax to the escalating, feverish energy coming just before it. It's been mentioned that Gheorghiu looks immodestly self-satisfied in the curtain calls after Act I. Unfortunately, I think there was at this point much for her to be modest about.
Happily, Gheorghiu does come into her own in Acts II and III, but her total performance, I'd argue, is not one for the history books. If hers is the best Violetta currently on DVD, so much the worse for the other recorded contemporary portrayers of the role.",1227916800,9,1753,4.80794701986755
3529026,5,B001DELX08,"I was very impressed by this version. From the first minutes you understand that new era of high quality video has already become. The image is so three-D-mentional that it's even hard to see something similar in our every-day reality. Modern HD-cameras create the effect of physical presence in the scene. I saw this blu-ray at 52"" plazma TV, and I felt that I'm in the scene, even can touch any object. It reminds me of my experience in IMAX-theaters.

Take into mind that creators of this production use plenty of luxury fabrics, authentic props and similiar things, and in the whole pay much attention to detailes of scenery. The ball scenes are truly of royal range.

The image of these materials has high contrast, deep colours, well-shaped textures of everything, shine of jewellery strikes your eyes, but little pity for singers and actors: you can see all their skin defects.

Quality of audio is also the same as they noted in features of blu-ray disc. Often in my blu-ray experience I face the problem that producers of so-called blu-ray discs just sell old recordings with standard audio-video quality on blu-rays without any improvements! Here all is real blu-ray quality.

I have already saw some operas on blu-rays, and think this is THE BEST!",1227398400,21,1258,4.864485981308412
3529027,5,B001DELX08,"In Gheorghiu's 1994 performance of La Traviata from Covent Garden (also on DVD), her singing of Violetta is fresh and captivating but you're aware that she's concentrating on the music (which is not a criticism). In this 2007 La Scala production, thirteen years more mature as a performer, she just lets loose while at the same time achieving extraordinary precision in her phrasing and in her interpretation of the role. Her performance can only be described as a ""tour de force."" She performs the role as if she owns it. I've never seen ""E strano"" and ""Sempre libera"" sung with such unbridled confidence. The expression on her face during the curtain call to Act I tells us she knows she nailed it. Immodest, she is not (as another reviewer pointed out).

But don't let that put you off because onstage, where it matters, Gheorghiu gives one of the most dominating opera performances I've seen. Every note is sung with clear intention. Her one minute ""aria,"" the cry ""Amami, Alfredo,"" accompanied by fiery orchestration, dominated by the timpani (which reappears with heartrending effect in the final bars of the opera), is worth the price of the DVD alone. It's a powerful and heartbreaking moment.

As if Gheorghiu's performance were not enough to recommend this production, I think it offers the best threesome available in Traviata on DVD. As Alfredo, Ramon Vargas may not be as expressive an actor as, for example, Rolando Villazon, but Vargas creates a touching and vulnerable Alfredo and possesses a wonderfully rich and full voice. The word ""burnished"" is  more often used to describe a baritone, but it applies to Vargas' tenor voice. Just listen to his Act III duet with Gheorghiu, ""Parigi, o cara,"" and you'll hear that exceptional quality to which I refer.  He is far superior to Frank Lopardo who is on Gheorghiu's 1994 Traviata. Lopardo is so wooden onstage that he's not believable as her lover.

Roberto Frontali is the best Germont I've seen on DVD. Germont is often played by baritones who are too young to be Alfredo's father. These otherwise fine performers appear stiff and uncomfortable in a role that requires them to play a much older man (Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Thomas Hampson come to mind, the former in the La Fenice Traviata featuring Patrizia Ciofi and the latter in the Salzburg production featuring Anna Netrebko). But Frontali is perfect for the role. His rich bass-baritone voice just rings out in ""Di Provenza."" It contrasts beautifully with Gheorghiu's soprano; their duet in Act II is one of the highlights of the production.

As always, the La Scala chorus is precise in its execution and beautiful in sound. It excels on all the La Scala DVD's I own. The concertato finale to Act II, with Gheorghiu's voice soaring above the chorus, is riveting.

I guess the thrust of this review is clear: if you're an Angela Gheorghiu fan, this production is not to be missed. Add to that the stellar performances by Vargas, Frontali, the chorus, the orchestra under the baton of Lorin Maazel, and this is the best La Traviata currently available on DVD.",1224892800,27,3081,4.879541108986616

3529029,5,B001DELX08,"I used to have the DVD of Decca version of La Traviata featuring Angela Gheorghiu. I liked it but this blu-ray provides a whole new experience with its great high definition vision and audio. Ms. Gheorghiu, as Violetta, performs amazingly in both singing and acting. It's great to observe all the details of the singer's facial expressions and gestures in hi-def. Mr. Vargas, as Alfredo, performs very well even though his acting is rather clumsy. The baritone, as the father, sings flawlessly. I thought the production was also excellent. I expected more from the Gypsy's dance/song but all in all this title deserves five stars.

This is my very first opera title in blu-ray and I'm more falling in love with blu-ray after watching this Verdi's masterpiece. I know I'll be watching it over and over again especially the first act.

Technically, it was shot in 1080i and features PCM 2.0 & DTS HDMA 7.1 audio track. No extras.",1224028800,27,927,4.823899371069182

The opening night of this production at La Scala last year was greeted by controversy that got the star soprano and conductor lustily booed by the angry audience. The Italian papers came up with some speculations as to why that nasty audience response happened. When I first looked at the cover of this DVD, the first thing I noticed was the pretty picture of Angela Gheorghiu ; the next, the names of Ramon Vargas and Roberto Frontali were printed significantly smaller than the names of the soprano and conductor Lorin Maazel. I thought it was in bad taste and slighted the other two principals who are top Verdi singers of this generation with distinguished operatic careers. After listening to the performance on this DVD, I thought I had a better take on the controversy than those Italian papers. My theory is that the soprano and conductor hatched a
scheme to do something on that first night performance that would surely enrage the passionate La Scala audience and make themselves the wronged victims. In a subsequent performance used for this DVD, they performed tremendously, and the guilt-ridden and contrite boo birds apologized with huge ovations for them, which was the object of their plot to sell this DVD. But to further reward the conspirators by printing their names much larger than everyone else is going too far. Having said that, the performance here is superb.

Despite some negative comments in the papers about the 20-yr old production sets used here, I prefer it to the Met's Zeffirelli production with its extremes and some garishness particularly in Act2. It's a relief to see Violetta in her last moments in a modest but decent surroundings, not in some dilapidated warehouse. All principals are in top form. As noted earlier, Vargas and Frontali are preeminent Verdi singers and great choice as the Germonts. Gheorghiu is not a typical or traditional Verdi soprano (the likes of Tebaldi, Freni or even Moffo) but she has a beautiful, expressive voice with dark shades for a wide range of expressions and is a very convincing actress. With sensitive and generous partners in Vargas, Frontali and Maazel, she can be a marvelous Violetta as demonstrated on this disc. My little complaint is the stage direction and coaching that let Vargas do a lot of distracting things while singing his one aria in Act2 - looking for cup and saucer, pouring his coffee, and singing his one-verse O Mio Rimorso while lugging a suitcase and rummaging through some unmentionables looking for a document. Miraculously, he did not miss a beat and sang with his customary elegance and vibrancy in rich and burnished tones. For the most part, the singing and acting of the three principals, the contributions of everyone, comprimarios, dancers, chorus, orchestra and , of course, the crafty Maazel throughout the opera - all make this brilliant DVD a must have and worthy addition to everyone's collection of this wonderful opera.",1223683200,37,3169,5.2752475247524755
3529031,5,B001DELX08,"This new DVD from Arthaus faces formidible competition from Gheorghiu's first Violetta on Decca; this was her ""double"" debut, both on DVD and CD. It was her first undertaking of the role and clearly she meant to make it her own. The conductor, Solti, allows for the second verses to arias that are either frequently cut (O mio rimorso and Addio del passato) and includes the cabaletta to Di provenza--not one of Verdi's most inspired moments.

This new DVD uses sets that were new in 1990 although I don't think anyone could lodge a complaint in this area: they are opulent, plush and quite gorgeous. The conservative opera goer will have no complaint here. If memory serves me correctly this is the same production that featured Tiziana Fabriccini, an interpretation that was very controversial, Roberto Alagna and Paolo Coni and conducted by Muti. It should be re-released by whoever has the licensing rights.

Gheorghiu matches all the excellences of her earlier performance. She always looks stunning, sings beautifully and is an accomplished actress. I can't think of any other singer who has this role in her repertoire could match this diva. Yes, it's true that she doesn't take the optional high D at the end of the first act aria, but that's what it is: an option. Her performance is nuanced and touching. I have heard some of Fleming's performance but I find her superficial and dramatically utterly uninvolved. (A downside to the LOs Angeles DVD is Bruson who in his prime was a baritone to be reckoned with; here, at 70 (!) his tone is partched and is afflicted with a wobble which is very distressing.)

Vargas is a great improvement over Lopardo who is somewhat wooden and appears uncomfortable. The former would never be accused of being a great actor but his instincts are always right and while not being ""handsome"" he has a cherubic sweetness that is very engaging. He has clearly thought out the requirements of the music and brings a great deal of imagination. A pity that the second verse of O mio rimorso was cut as it spoils the musical balance that Verdi was aiming for. (Gheorghiu was also denied her second verse in the Addio del passato.)

Frontali is a vast improvement over Nucci who by rights should be able to shine in this role; the latter became a ""Verdi baritone"" by default. His milieu is clearly in the Donizetti/Bellini/Rossini operas. the voice is slender, but well focused, but I prefer Fontali's bigger more rugged sound. Of course he has no competition--at least none that I know of on the horizon.

Initially I had my doubts about Maazel. In the 70's (I am hazarding a guess)he recorded Traviata with Lorengar, Aragall and DFD. It was a near complete text if I recall, but Decca management doubtless came down with the mandate to get it on two LP discs. As a result the tempi were brutal in many cases and even though the set did garner some good reviews I have no doubt that it was due to Lorengar. Here Maazel seems much more relaxed and at one with the score. In short one of the best performances of Traviata that I have heard.

For those who want or require a regie Traviata stay away. There is no Konzept here. I would dearly love to see the Venice performance (again Maazel I believe) and even though what I have seen of Villazon/Netrebko is more than offputting (more due to Rizzi who seems to be this generation's Molinari-Pradelli). The cover on the Bel Aire DVD is a Maryln Monroe 'manque""--not the association I make with Traviata. OTOH if a conventionally staged, directed production of this opera is what you want I can only recommend  this new set.",1223078400,58,3605,4.694620253164557

3529055,5,B001DELX08,"In the wake of avante garde stagings of Verdi's ever popular masterpiece, this 2007 La Scala performance of the 1980's production of La Traviata is nothing less than being the `definitive' modern version.
Being Asian, I confess I have great difficulty in following most of the avante garde operatic productions.  When seen in its proper period setting, the story and the performance really makes a whole lot of difference in terms of understanding as well as enjoyment of the work itself.  The sets and staging in this 2007 La Scala performance is simply sublime.  The choregraphy and dancing are also highly accomplished.  More than any thing else, the title role, portrayed by Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu, is nothing short of being perfect both visually, dramatically and musically.
In this Gheorghiu's reprisal of Violetta Valery, her signature role, demonstrates not only a seasoned and in depth reading of the role, but also a performance of utter emotional commitment.  Throughout the different Acts and stages of the character's development, Gheorghiu performs with complete abandonment, her vocal acting and dramatic portrayal are nothing less than total identification with the heroine. Her short parting words with Alfredo after the emotionally turbulent scene with Pere Germont are sung with unbelievable dramatic effect. Her final Act aria after reading Germont's letter is a tear wrenching and heart breaking out burst, and her brief resuscitation to high spirits whips up the audiences' sense of despair with Violetta.  It is a rare complete emersion into a role that calls for great emotional stretches, and Gheorghiu's performance is difficult to be surpassed.
As her lover Alfredo, Mexican tenore di grazie Ramon Vargas brings into this Verdian role the rarely heard bel canto elegance, at least not heard since the other great Mexican tenor Francisco Araiza's Alfredo (which was never formally documented). Vargas' performance matches Gheorghiu's point by point, if not visually as convincing as Gheorghiu.
Roberto Frontali's Pere Germont is another powerful performance. This all too down to earth figure undergoes several emotional twists as the plot develops as well, and Frontali's handles the twists with expert finesse vocally and dramatically.",1362268800,4,2274,5.4460227272727275

I really enjoyed it very much and of course I was moved like always when I see a good version of this beautiful opera.",1362268800,,593,4.165217391304348
3529057,5,B001DELX08,"Operas are either recorded with stage microphones only or stage microphones combined with wireless body microphones. If only stage microphones are used, the sound of the voices will vary depending on the direction the singer is facing. If he is close to the microphone and faces it, the voice will sound best. If he sings sideways to a partner or sings from the rear of the stage, the voice will be recorded less loud. This actually replicates the experience the audience has at the live performance, but is often magnified  as microphones have uneven directional sensibility.
For best audio for the live audience, the performers often stand up front and sing towards the audience, making it a somewhat static production. Or they act and move around, making it a less pleasant audio experience with the voices going up and down in loudness.
Voila, in comes the body microphone, which picks up the sound regardless which way the singer faces. Thus you can get recorded sound from an opera that actually sounds better on a disk than in a live performance, if body microphones are used.

A good demonstration can be had with the L.A. La Traviata with Fleming/Villazon/Conlon, which is a stage microphones only recording vs. the Milano version with Gheorghiu/Vargas/Maazel, which uses body microphones.

While the picture quality is pretty much even in both performances and very good, the voices in the surround sound track fluctuate constantly as the principals move around in the L.A version, while they are rock solid in the Milano version.
This alone makes the Milano version preferable for me.
In addition, the orchestra and the chorus are recorded with a wider sound stage and give me more the feeling of sitting in one of the front rows. Furthermore, I think Gheorghiu plays the part of Violetta better than Fleming. While I enjoy Villazon in Romeo and Juliet (body mics.), I prefer a steady Vargas over an ""up and down"" Villazon. The only one quite steady in the L.A performance is Bruson, who moves little and sings to the front.  But Frontali is an acceptable Giorgio for me.

So 5 stars for Milano, only 3 for L.A., mostly based on the recording technique used.

Another Traviata recording I have using body microphones is the Bonfadelli/Piper/Domingo DVD, which has a 5.1 surround track. While the picture is not as good, it is well recorded with the sound stage a little less wide, but the voices are very clear and the balance with chorus and orchestra is the best of the 3. The acting (directed by Zeffirelli) especially of Bonfadelli, is also the most convincing. If it were available in HD, it would be a toss-up with the Milano version for me and would get 5 stars, too.",1347753600,4,2685,4.813449023861171
3529058,5,B001DELX08,"This production, performance and recording of La Traviata made under Maazel at La Scala intriguingly and especially comes into direct competition with Gheorghiu's own earlier dbut recording made with Solti conducting at Covent Garden. That is still much beloved by considerable numbers of collectors, many of whom take the view that it has established an unmatchable benchmark. Not everyone agrees of course.  There have, of course, been many other recordings made since then as well as before then but this review is going to concentrate on the merits of this new disc and comment on how it compares with the earlier recording.

This is a traditional performance and shares that feature with the earlier recording. However, the stage space available at La Scala is much more generous and all three acts benefit from the extra room. The first act allows for a real sense of a large room devoted to providing pleasure and ease of movement for many guests. The second act gives an aura of luxurious spaciousness which seems appropriate to the story and the third act provides the opposite effect of a large desolate space also appropriate to the situation.

Ramon Vargas is a good singer who is able to act and communicate a sense of real communication. There are others who may take a more dominant role but in this case he is rightly subordinate to Gheorghiu. Roberto Frontali is one of the most acceptable Giorgio Germonts that I have seen. This is a difficult role to portray as it is so unsympathetic to Violetta and probably especially contrary to modern mores. Nevertheless he brings authority without bombast and is both young enough to be a strong character yet old enough to expect and demand social respect.

The remaining supporting roles are all well done with committed and believable acting combined by secure singing.  Equally, the chorus are in good voice with plenty of social interaction in the crowd scenes in acts 1 and 2. The ballet dancers make a good job of their gypsy and matador moment.

The night really belongs to Gheorghiu though and in this performance she demonstrates a great advance of sheer dramatic delivery. The first act is fairly low key as appropriate to her role in the story but with act 2 she handles the relationships with the two Germonts superbly ending with a spine tingling and passionate plea not to forget her love for Alfredo as she prepares her departure from the act. The last act once more is a demonstration of `being' the role rather than acting the role. Throughout she is able to deliver all the big vocal moments and the audience are fully appreciative. This is an older woman's understanding of the part and, as such, is markedly more subtle than her earlier performance. That is one from a much younger and less sophisticated or experienced woman and is appropriate to the age she was then. In a nutshell, with these two recordings we are given the choice of either a young woman giving a fine young interpretation or an older woman giving a fine but more mature interpretation.

The orchestral contribution under the experienced leadership of Maazel is quite the equal of that delivered by Solti and the Covent Garden team.

What cannot be denied though, are the obvious advances in recorded technology where the imaging is richer with a greater range of colour. The earlier imaging suffers from over-contrasty imaging and a lack of detail on the highlights such as Violetta's ballroom dress (technically called `highlight burn-out). The sound is equally much fuller and is supplied in DTS 7.1 and stereo.

The other extraordinary advantage the new disc has is one of price as currently it is available as a budget price disc - a sort of sampler for the Arthaus catalogue. This does, of course, makes it amazingly tempting to buy whether as the only version to have or as a second. Gheorghiu fans could therefore buy both performances and solve the choice issue that way! Beware though - the older full-priced disc is still available and is by no means as attractive as this bargain disc. Order your copy with care therefore.

In summary therefore, this is a disc that Gheorghiu fans should snap up without delay as it is bound to give them great pleasure as indeed the performance clearly gave the audience at La Scala. Others who are more tentative as regards recordings by Gheorghiu should still find this a very attractive proposition especially at its present tempting price. For all of these reasons it seems that this disc fully deserves a 5 star rating for those who are attracted to the cast and venue.",1343520000,9,4571,4.826309067688378

3529062,5,B001DELX08,"This is a recording from a live performance by Teatro alla Scala di Milano.

First of all the music: Violetta was sung by Angela Gheorghiu.  She was flawless in singing, one of the best performances for Violetta I have seen.  I would not go as far as calling her singing inspiring, but it is sure to please and impress any Opera lover.  I have never had the good fortune of hearing one of her performances before, and I am very impressed.  I think I can become a fan of hers easily.  Alfredo was sung by well known Ramn Vargas.  This was a technically excellent performance for him (as usual), though I have heard others singing this role with more passion.  All other singers are secondary, but they too impressed in their roles.

Next the peripherals: the acting, the set design, the costumes,...  This was one of the best acted La Traviata performances I have ever seen.  Gheorghiu was emotional (almost too emotional.) She is indeed an outstanding actress (which is surprising for most Opera stars.)  Besides her singing and acting, she also made her role very believable because she is thin and attractive.  I have seen other performances before flawlessly sung by well known heavy set Sopranos (and there are lots of them), who were playing the role of Violetta, a young woman near death suffering from consumption.  I enjoyed those too (for the music) but no amount acting will make the experience really believable when the actress does not fit the part.  I am happy to say that this is not the case here.  The set design was fabulous.  The attention to the details of the Period was outstanding.  Costumes (especially for women) were dazzling.  Finally, I was very impressed by a little bonus visual summary just before the last act.  During the ""Preludio Atta Terzo"", the opera goers at the performance were treated to the music only.  But this Blu-ray disk superimposed a very tastefully selected images from the previous acts, summarizing the story visually while the orchestra played the prelude.  It was amazing how well the visual show fit the music.  I wonder if Verdi pictured it that way?

Next the Blu-Ray disk: it outstanding! This was filmed in high definition with excellent cinematography.  I recommend that you view this Blu-Ray disk on an HDTV capable of 1080p resolution.  Visual experience is an excellent compliment to the musical one.

Finally the price:  it is a steal!  Buy one immediately while it is still selling for less than $10.  It is a better deal than any DVD you can buy.",1327536000,,2512,4.747685185185185
3529063,5,B001DELX08,"This DVD was my introduction to Angela Gheorghiu.  What a voice! As a singer, she is the epitome of a great classical soprano, with a strong and exciting high register. She also brings affecting pathos to the scenes in which Violetta suffers. These wonders already make this DVD a must-own for any opera lover. I found Gheorghiu's performance during the initial banquet less satisfying - she didn't seem like the courtesan who made the party a pleasure to all, able to create a dream of joy beyond normal experience - such as Teresa Stratas gave us in the incomparable film by Zefirelli. Similarly, Ramon Vargas, whose voice I love, didn't contribute enough chemistry to make the banquet scene more joyous.

This is a stage production, with generally excellent sets (apart from a misplaced pool table in the country villa). Although I only saw it once when empty, I'd say that La Scala doesn't have the scale and technology to compare with the Metropolitan Opera or the Kennedy Center.  Within those limitations, the set for the banquet scene was rather beautiful and worked well.

Vargas sang beautifully, and communicated sincerity and depth of feeling, but I find his acting somewhat limited.  He has room to develop.

A more serious dramatic deficiency was the performance of Roberto Frontali as Alfredo's father. He has a lovely sound, but his performance was rather wooden.  At one point in a scene with Violetta he dropped his hands in a casual and rather limp manner that a good director should have corrected.  This might be less serious on stage, but seen from a good camera angle, it loosened some of the dramatic tension that should remain tight in those scenes. Because the libretto doesn't do enough to fully support the drama of these critical scenes, the actor and the director need to do more.  From the elder Germont, I'd like to see more moral ambivalence, and a clearer expression of passion for the family's reputation - and enough of an edge to provide a contrast with his later change of heart. Frontali's Germont was too bloodless - a blank canvas with musical accompaniment.

The strong points of this production make it a valuable addition to the collection of anyone who appreciates opera.",1324166400,4,2216,4.86968085106383
3529064,5,B001DELX08,"To be honest with you, I bought this Opera because of the great price break under which it was being offered. I am a ballet lover, and that is the art form most of my dollars go into, but I am beginning to collect some of the great operas too. Verdi is known to have some very good ballet in most of his operas, and this one has some very good dancing included. This opera has several exceptionally beautiful arias by three of the principles, and all expressed themselves very well with their voices as well as their facial and body mannerisms. From the very beginning Gheorghiu was able to show us that Violetta was quite ill, and knowing the story of the lady of the Camelias, was not all that important. The only thing that was slightly confusing was the argument presented by Giorgio Germont as to why Violetta should leave his son Alfredo. I had to read the novel to understand what he was concerned about.

All in all this is one of the best operas I have. It is full of heart rending emotion, so it is well to have a few tissues handy. If you can't cry for Violetta, you probably cannot cry for anyone. This opera was taken from the story (and play) written by the Son of the famous author of ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", Alexandre Dumas (Pere). His name is Alexandre Dumas (Fils) or junior. The son did not become as famous as the father, but his book (and later the play by the same title) ""The Lady of the Camelias"" was very good, and was the setting for this opera, and maybe others, plus many movies and a ballet by the same title, ""The Lady of the Camelias""....<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Dame-aux-Cam1-2lias-Oxford-World-s-Classics/dp/0199540349/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Dame aux Cam1/2lias (Oxford World's Classics)</a>....If you love ballet, you owe it to yourself to get the ballet, you won't be sorry....<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chopin-La-Dame-aux-Camelias-Blu-ray/dp/B0025XW95Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chopin: La Dame aux Camelias [Blu-ray</a>]It is also available in standard DVD format.

This story, and the ballet, may make you sympathize with the profession of prostitution. If you read the book, you will probably be willing to think kindly of Violetta, since her own father loaned her out to his friends at the age of twelve, but when she discovered how valuable she was, her standard of living increased dramatically.  She was able to collect spend 200,000 Francs per year, a fortune, and no one man could afford her, and therefore, the love relationship with Alfredo/Armond/Dumas, was doomed from the beginning, as he could not come close to keep her with that much need for money. In her day Violetta, the courtesan, was looked upon in a different light than a woman in the same profession today. Violetta was only 23 years of age when she died. So, get this opera, and hear how Verdi immortalized a common, but beautiful prostitute. This story is true, and the person of Alfredo is actually Alexandre Dumas (Fils) himself.

3529078,4,B001DELX08,"There's no question that this version of La Traviata for the Teatro alla Scala is a quality production on many levels and, available at a budget price, the Blu-ray is nevertheless of a very high standard, but I have a few minor reservations, mainly around the lack of any sense of adventure in the staging.  It's a safe production with a perfectly traditional staging, unimaginatively presented and choreographed, with little to distinguish it from countless other productions of the opera available.

It's harder to be critical of the actual performance on any other level than that of personal taste and Angela Gheorghiu doesn't sit well with me.  There's no doubting her technical ability, the sheer control or the strength of her voice, but personally, I find it a little mannered, and I would say the same about her acting.  As a result, her Violetta never feels as fragile or as vulnerable as she ought to be - at least from what I would expect of the role.  There's no chemistry whatsoever either with the otherwise fine Ramon Vargas as Alfredo, making this production technically strong, but emotionally weak.

By way of comparison, I find the Willy Decker staging of the opera for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2005-Salzburg-Festspiele-La-Traviata/dp/B001MRMRS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2005 Salzburg Festspiele La Traviata</a>&nbsp;much more interesting and innovative.  A rather minimalist staging, there is however great originality in how it makes the story meaningful, vital and contemporary (whereas this version feels a little bit stuffy and practically like a museum piece by comparison), drawing out all the latent passion and violence out of what should indeed be a highly charged opera.  While the question of who is the better singer is certainly debatable, it's one of Anna Netrebko's best performances and her acting seems better fitted to this particular role, blending perfectly and credibly with Rolando Villazn and a superb Thomas Hampson.

This version however is certainly a strong, all-round production, with fine performances and, particularly at the current price, it is an excellent introduction to opera on Blu-ray, as well as appealing to traditionalists and fans of Gheorghiu.  There are however more exciting and daring versions around for anyone a little more adventurous.",1285113600,6,2361,5.533333333333333

These two male singers perform very well although I would not claim they are the best available but I give full marks to Angela Gheorghiu to be at least as good as Fleming, Gruberova, Netrebo and others. I also have her performing this opera on laserdisc with Domingo where Solti was the conductor but this latest effort eclipses her earlier one.

3529090,5,B001DELX08,"Update 11/19/2011:  I originally posted the review below in which I complained about the DTS surround track. Since then, I've bought a newer AVR which supports high-resolution audio such as the DTS-HD MA on this disc. My previous AVR didn't have an HDMI input, so I connected the video using HDMI directly to my HDTV, and used a digital optical cable for the audio from my Blu-Ray player to the AVR. This worked well for my other Blu-Ray discs, because the high-resolution audio was down-mixed to a a five-channel surround mix that sounded fine. For some reason, this Blu-Ray did not sound fine using that system, but it sounds great with my new AVR. The vocals are clear and no longer sound overwhelmed by the orchestra, and the orchestra sounds clear and well balanced.

So I am revising my rating from 3 to 5 stars, with the caveat that you *may* experience the audio issues I described below if you do not have an AVR that has an HDMI input for your audio signal. I believe that some Blu-Ray players also output high-res audio over multi-channel analog cables as well, so that should work too  If your AVR does support high resolution audio, you'll hear an outstanding performance in excellent surround sound.  I'm pleased to recommend this disc, which continues to be a real bargain.

Original review:  I agree with the positive reviews about the performance, and the image quality of the Blu-Ray is excellent.  Unfortunately, I found the DTS surround track to be very poorly mixed, with the orchestra sounding sloppy and often overwhelming the singers.  The 2-channel stereo mix is better, which would indicate that the problem with the DTS was in the processing and not inherent in the recording itself.  I at first suspected the problem I was having with the DTS might have been a result of my equipment, though I haven't had any similar problems with other opera Blu-Ray discs, but after reading a review on a Blu-Ray review website complaining about the same issue, it's clear that others have experienced it, too.  Still, for $9.99, you get a great performance, outstanding picture quality, and if you're willing to settle for stereo instead of surround, an acceptable sound mix.

The bonus materials consist of trailers for other productions, and the menu to access these is sluggish and clunky, hardly the best way to convince buyers to shell out for more from this company.  All in all, the whole disc strikes me as a missed opportunity.",1272067200,32,2451,4.809523809523809
3529091,5,B001DELX08,"I saw this recording listed and thought there must be some catch; La Traviata performed at La Scala on Blu-ray for less than $10 didn't seem possible. I'm delighted to report it's for real! This is a production of the entire opera on stage at La Scala recorded live with audience in 2007.

As one would expect, the production is first class; the chorus and orchestra do a fabulous job and the settings are worthy of La Scala. The icing on the cake is the singers; all major rolls are well sung and generally look the part. The tenor, Ramon Vargas has less of a stage presence than the tenor on my other recording of La Traviata, Placido Domingo, but one should not hold that against lesser mortals.

Since the performance is a live production, the audience response is recorded as well; using the DTS-HD Master Audio places the listener in the Teatro alla Scala di Milano at this 2007 production. It's pretty exciting!

The HD video is so detailed I believe I could have counted the dots in the material on Violetta's sleeve in the first act. I have an OPPO BDP-83 connected to my Samsung T220HD TV/Monitor and when playing it on this set up one might say there is too much detail to be seen. I'm sitting much farther back with my primary surround system and will freely confess that less is more in this regard.

If you enjoy Verdi, and La Traviata in particular, I highly recommend you get this recording. The sound track offers both LPCM stereo and the DTS-HD Master Audio and does a great job on both.

I have viewed some of the bonus features and had mixed feelings about them; I am something of a traditionalist and have problems with productions of Siegfried that have a chest freezer sitting in the background; but that's just me I suppose. The section from Giselle looked very interesting and seemed to promise a good performance of that ballet.

This is another one I'm delighted to have in my collection!",1270771200,101,1915,4.5523255813953485

3529096,4,B001DELX08,"Not much to add to the previous reviews. Excellent production, good singing from the three principals. But the acting or Mr. Vargas is pretty bad, his facial expression at the dramatic ""Amami Alfredo"" is embarassing to those that are following the pangs of Violetta. On the other hand, Ms. Georghiu's constant ""close mouth saliva production"" before she begins singing is a distraction to the viewers that are absorbed in the ongoing drama. Opera singers, used to the large theater stages and the safe distance from the live audience, should begin to be concerned with the close-ups the new media allows. Better yet, video producers should have moved the camera to another target everytime she begins pressing her lips, munching the void in search for a humid environment for her voice to reach our ears. Really ugly...",1252540800,4,818,5.022058823529412
3529097,4,B001DELX08,"Don't be fooled by other reviews that give this higher regard
than the 1994 Covent Garden performance; only the 3rd act can
match Angela Gheorghiu's 1994 performance.  In 2007 she's old
and acts like this is her 150th repeat; in 1994 she has a freshness
and believability that makes 1994 the best available version
among all dvds. Lopardo may be wooden but that can be a viable
interpretation; Vargas just does not cut it as ""the"" man who
sweeps Violetta off her feet. Nucci (who I generally do not like)
is very good especially after repeated watching, and, Frontali
is just too course and gruff all the time. Maazel is no match for
Solti, who manages the soft moments magnificently.
  One reviewer said this 2007 was close to Madga Olivero; no
such thing.  1994 gets closer to one of the alltime greats plus
we get to see ravishing beauty. Gheorghiu's costumes in 1994 are
also better than 2007 (with 2007's plunging necklines). It's hard
for me to believe that a better Traviata will ever be on DVD than
the 94 Covent Garden: I cry many times watching it; not one tear
occured watching the 2007 (but, but for the 94 CG, the 2007 would
be the best available version-but still no drawn tears).",1251936000,10,1194,4.591549295774648

3529100,5,B001DELX08,"I must admit firstly that I was not and am still not an overawed by Angela Gheorghiu. She is not bad at all but I don't put her on a par with the divas of the 1950's and 1960's. Nor do I number La Traviata among my favorites. I'm a fan of the Don Giovanni/Trovatore/Turandot mold. Big operas with big set pieces as opposed to the tragic love story.

Onto the opera which is first and foremost impeccably conducted by Lorin Maazel. This is the one consistency throughout.

As to the principals, Roberto Frontali is as good as any Giorgio Germont I've heard so far and he is the most believable of the three. Ramon Vargas also acts and sings extremely well but he seems to have a voice that is ever so slightly too soft. His eyes at the end were amazing.

Angela Gheorghiu starts off horridly. She has an uncanny resemblance to the late comedienne Gilda Radner and in Act I not only does she act like a clown but sings foolishly also with an absurd amount of breathing injected into the lyrics. It makes her sound like a chain smoker.

She rebounds wonderfully though, fully transforming herself in acts II and III into the true star she has become. As the opera goes on her singing, acting, and her stage presence just to continue to improve and get better. Verdi bears alot of responsibility for that too, but I can honestly say I've never seen a bad performance turned to a stellar one in front of my eyes and ears. Listen to the applause at the end of each aria. La Scala goes from near silent in Act I to explosively loud by the end. This is a testament to the whole cast and crew but especially to Gheorghiu who turned it around so dramatically. My respect for her has increased tenfold!",1242086400,,1691,4.358730158730158

8293065,4,B001DELX08,"I now have two versions of La Traviata on Blu-ray.  I purchased this one first.  Loved the lavish period-style sets and costumes, but found the appearance of the singers at bit distracting.  Perhaps that is a bit crass, but it is what it is.  Although not all that old, Gheorghiu looks too old on the Blu-ray to be the beautiful young courtesan who can get any man she wants and Vargas looks too homely to be the man she would give up a life of riches for.
I subsequently purchased the Glyndebourne production.  Venera Gimadieva, as Violetta, both looks the role and sings it beautifully.  Michael Fabianos looks were not as distracting as Vargas.  I liked Vargass singing a bit better, but wouldnt consider the difference major.  The problem with the Glyndebourne production is that it is updated to what appears to be the 21st Century, something that makes no sense to me for a plot that is very grounded in 19th Century moral prejudices.
I have compared the two further, in considerably more detail, in my review of the Glyndebourne production.
Both are excellent productions, but neither is perfect, or at least not exactly what I would like to see.  If there were an option for 4  stars, I would go with that for both.  Given that non-option, it will be four.",1482278400,,1264,4.623318385650224
