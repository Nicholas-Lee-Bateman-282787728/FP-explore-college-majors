Love it, re-watch it, leave it to loop during parties!!!! It's the BEST conversation starter! Follow me, fb, insta and twitter, @JerCurr23",1376611200,,271,4.551020408163265
7948622,1,B00005OCMK,"i decided to buy this video thinking it was real world: back to new York. as advertised,but what i received was Real World you never saw:Back to New York. Very Disappointed....",1305331200,,176,4.709677419354839
7948623,2,B00005OCMK,"Hey to all that watched The Real World You Never Saw - Back To New York...just more of a question, so disregard  my star rating of this DVD. I haven't had the chance to watch it yet, but my question is, is this DVD the actual SEASON 10 as well as extra footage, or is it just the 45 minutes of footage?  If it's NOT the season 10 dvd, can anyone be so kind as to informing me if they have it for sale yet?  I loved the show for this particular season, but I won't waste my $$ if it's not on this one.

Thanks so very much to anyone that can help me!  :-)",1096502400,,554,3.7413793103448274
7948624,1,B00005OCMK,I am a hardcore Real World fan.  There is only about 45 minutes of additional footage and not much is really interesting.  It is something you'll watch once and probably not watch again.,1032998400,5,186,4.606060606060606
7948625,5,B00005OCMK,I thought that this was the best season in the many wonderful years of the Real World. Never has there been three African-American cast members in a real world castat the same time! I was very happy with this season because myself and lots of people I know could see a piece of themselves in the the cast and relate to them more so than other casts.,1019260800,4,349,4.223880597014926
7948626,3,B00005OCMK,"Good Footage. Bad Price.
Let's face it, paying [this much money] for an episode and a half of footage you didn't see leaves a bad taste in your mouth. It should.
The DVD itself lacks in any -- real special features. ""CAST BIOS"" is simply a paragraph that was posted at Mtv.com plus a 30-sec clip from their 10 minute casting tape. The house tour is good -- yet weird to see Coral and Mike walk around talking to the camera.
Lots of bumping into the camera mishaps, bad haircuts, and parodies make this DVD actually worth buying. If you liked Lori, you get to see a side of Lori the TV show choose not to focus on.
LESS DRAMA! They actually show the cast having fun together. No fights. But...why watch Real World to see people get along?
Another problem with this DVD is too much Mike, or ""The Miz"", or P.Diddy, whatever his name is. A good 60% of this video is Mike running around acting stupid. Ok, funny the first time...old the second time. Cuts of Malik and Nichole seem to be small. One clip of Malik, and a un needed one of that.
The thing that gets me is they say 'You Never Saw'. The never tell you what they are going to show you that you didn't see. Mostly interviews then small 2-5 minute clips.
Footage of the Hamptons that wasn't released, Lori & Coral's musical, Mike's fake porno, and squeals of Racheal make this worth having. I wouldn't say this is a 'must' for hardcore fans, but a...'it'd be coo to have..."". And for fans of the show that watched on & off, I'd advise you not to buy 50 minutes of repeated footage.",1008460800,18,1534,4.293103448275862
