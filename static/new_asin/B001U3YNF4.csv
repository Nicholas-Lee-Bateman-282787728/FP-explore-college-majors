8342749,3,B001U3YNF4,"The only reason I'm writing a review for this, is that no one else has. (I don't like reviewing things that already have 20 or so posts)...anyway...

I give this 3 stars as it's nice to watch & listen too for the relaxing benefits, if only for the visual & audio. If I described this item in my review any further, I'd spoil it for any potential purchasers.

I didn't give it 5 stars as it has not given ""me"" the complete control of any dreams -- yet -- and I've had it for over a month. BUT, everyone is different and it may work very well with certain people so I'm not discrediting it either.

SO, if anyone buys this for a half-hour's worth of ""relaxation"", it's very good.",1313452800,,677,4.1923076923076925
