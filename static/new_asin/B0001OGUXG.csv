8015410,5,B0001OGUXG,This is one of my all-time favorite movies with Cary grant. I don't know how many times I have watched it.,1361923200,,106,4.095238095238095
8015411,3,B0001OGUXG,"I bought this exact copy from amazon because it was cheap. the movies in themselves are very good and not bad quality, but my one complaint is that (i had viewed the full movie of Penny Serenade previously.) left out one of the most dramatic scenes, it cuts off early when Cary Grant takes his adopted daughter before the judge to see if he will allow them to keep her seeing he has lost his job, it cuts off right before Cary Grant starts pleading with the man saying ""You cant take somebody's child away, Ill see she never does without,..... Ill beg Ill borrow, Ill starve, myself before Ill let her go!"" (not an EXACT quote because he says more than that but i am at a loss for words but it was to this pleading effect.) anyway my whole family agreed that one of the best scenes had been cut from this copy.",1307318400,2,810,4.232258064516129
8015412,4,B0001OGUXG,"Grant & Dunne are perfect for this script.  They both give an outstanding performance, which places the viewer right into the parts of the players.  It's a movie you'll find yourself yourself watching more than once.",1294704000,,216,4.972222222222222
