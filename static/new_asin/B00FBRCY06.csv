5974728,5,B00FBRCY06,"My son loves this show, and honestly so do I.  I know some people have complained to me about thinking that Chicas kazoo voice can be irritating, but I think it goes with the imagination theme of the show and helps young children  learn language from context clues.  I haven't watched this dvd yet because it's going to be an easter gift, but I'm sure it won't disappoint.",1395705600,3,372,4.4411764705882355

5974785,3,B00FBRCY06,I am quite dissapointed with this DVD because it only has 7 episodes of the show. I thought it might include at least the whole first season of the Show. I even haven't opened the dvd yet...I know it is not intended for me but for my babygirl but I am not sure of keeping this one.  For 10 bucks I think it should have included more episodes considering that The Chica Show is not producing any more new seasons.,1403222400,3,412,4.15

I wish there were more dvds for the chica show.,1476489600,,326,4.030769230769231
