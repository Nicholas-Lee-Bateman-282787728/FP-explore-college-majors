8744859,2,B019DTO536,"This is presented as a movie but, in fact, is a compilation of 6 existing Thomas TV videos.  My 2 grandsons (ages 2 and 4) were SO excited about a new Thomas movie (like the Great Race which they love) and were disappointed to find they had already seen (multiple times) the episodes on this DVD.  There is NO mention on the packaging or product description that this is not a new movie.",1486339200,,387,4.287671232876712

8744867,5,B019DTO536,"There were some really entertaining stories in this DVD. The new character Phillip proved to be somewhat like Thomas in ""The Adventure Begins"", especially when he was being cheeky to Gordon. Emily wishing to be streamlined in ""Best Engine Ever"" made for an interesting moment, but I'm glad she learned she was fine the way she was. ""Reds Vs. Blues"" made for some interesting rivalries between Thomas and James, plus the Fat Controller made a fantastic referee.

Definitely worth purchasing!",1459123200,2,490,5.125
