7554344,4,B018S7ARRW,"Great show.
Case is so-so.
All in one case with writing on the inside (under the discs, so you have to move them)... really THE benchmark for series DVD is the slim-packs of SG1 (no more than 2 discs per case, with writing on back of slim-packs) that fit 3 into a cardboard sleeve.

Didn't buy the 4.0/4.5 half releases and I waited for all in one.",1474070400,3,348,4.1940298507462686

7554346,5,B018S7ARRW,I love this series.  It is a funny sci-fi show about a small town full of geniuses who create all kinds of problems for the local non-genius sheriff.,1462147200,,149,4.321428571428571

7554350,5,B018S7ARRW,The season has a lot of plots to follow but I liked it.,1456876800,,55,3.3076923076923075

7554354,5,B018S7ARRW,best show since warehouse 13,1496620800,,28,4.8
7554355,5,B018S7ARRW,"After a first season of uneven quality, this show improved markedly in the second season and again in the third.  The fourth season continues at the same high level of entertainment and quality.
The characters are hilarious, and try hard to do right most of the time.  The plots are silly, but fun and suspenseful.  Okay, so they are often based on fake science.  At least they aren't boring...
For those thinking about watching this series with kids and teens, please note the following: there is action and suspense but relatively little violence.  Results of failed science experiments are often gross but rarely gory.  For violence and language this show definitely fits a PG rating.  However, for sexual content it occasionally moves up to a PG-13 rating, especially in the first season.
If you like this show, try Warehouse 13 as well--it is more steampunk/magic than scientific, but has the same wacky character-driven vibe.",1493942400,,931,5.0064935064935066
7554356,4,B018S7ARRW,"Eureka grabbed me right away with the fun, quirky music by Mutato Muzika, and then Bear Mcreary, the same guy whos done the music on Battlestar Galactica, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Black Sails, Outlander, Black Mirror, and the list goes on.

Season one of Eureka was great. If it had lasted just one season it would be on my list of one season wonder sci-fi shows like Firefly, The Prisoner, UFO, Brisco County, Jr., Eerie, Indiana, Jericho, etc. But it went on, dropping some of the funniest characters, and turned into the Allison Blake show. Nathan Stark, out of there. Beverly Barlowe, out of there. Spencer Martin, out of there. Jim Taggart, out of there.

And then they got rid of Zoe Carter! But they had to bring her back for the last season, season five, so they could end the series with a bookend, a mirror image of Zoe and her father driving out of town, passing themselves driving into town, which is how the series began.

Even the addition of the Wil Wheaton and Felicia Day characters couldn't rescue this series after they turned it into the Allison Blake show.

When Im not watching sci-fi and fantasy shows Im reading sci-fi and fantasy. Authors I like include Douglas Adams, Taylor Anderson, Isaac Asimov, Paolo Bacigalupi, Jack Campbell, Orson Scott Card, Arthur C. Clarke, Earnest Cline, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Terry Goodkind, Joe Haldeman, Robert A. Heinlein, Frank Herbert, Hugh Howey, Robert Jordan, George Martin, Larry Niven, Andre Norton, Patrick Rothfuss, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, John Steakley, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Andy Weir.",1491091200,,1586,4.996212121212121

7554358,2,B018S7ARRW,"Do you like shows that involve time travel? Then you may like all of Season 4. They travel back in time and change things. Then they go back to modern day Eureka, and things are different. The romances have changed, the jobs have changed, etc. It's a ""do over"", but with the same characters and the same science fiction theme. I think the show's writers ran out of ideas, so they tried to re-invent Eureka. No thanks.

I looked into Season 5, and will be skipping that one as well.  The best Seasons are 1, 2, 3...in that order.",1484265600,2,528,4.3232323232323235

8742827,5,B018S7ARRW,Season four of Eureka continue to build on the first three.  The charterers and stories continue to develop and draw you in to a town you wish was real.  I have to say it makes me wish again the series was still being made today.  I think everyone who sees it will enjoy it.,1531872000,,274,4.037037037037037
