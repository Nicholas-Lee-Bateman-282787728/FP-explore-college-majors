7452316,5,B015UOAV9A,"HOW TO UNDERSTAND THIS DARKER, GRITTIER PIRATE TALE, OR ASSESS IF ITS NOT FOR YOU

***WARNING TO THOSE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE SERIES*** This show has cinematic level production values, but also a great deal of adult content. This is the rum addled, opium hazed, violent and sexualized depiction one might expect of a more realistic (though still fantasy) pirate drama. It is understandable that it just won't fit everyones tastes. Please accept this attempt to explain the show so others can decide for themselves. There is a connection to the novel ""Treasure Island"" that is confusing people, but this IS NOT a children's tale. This program is also not all action for those hoping for sea battles in every episode. Those hoping for all action will find a substantial amount of focus on political struggle, drama, relationships and sub-plots. This is precisely the strength for those who seek it, and a weakness for those who don't wish to spend the time.

INTRO: It is truly amazing that for such a dark topic as pirating, there has hardly been a show that avoids the normal clichs and depicts a gritty life more like it would have been. We have always had these semi-sanitized versions meant for adventure telling and children's stories. Until now. This intricate tale borrows characters and places from Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island to form its structure and mythology, while starting 20 years earlier to set up the tale. Woven together with that is a few real characters based loosely on their actual history. From the opening credits featuring undulating strains of hurdy-gurdy music, camera panning over the intricate bone carved art piece shaped somewhat like the back of a sailing vessel - It is clear this is going to be a quality show with intricate plots and very dark undertones.

SEASON 1 & 2 (no spoilers): The first season lays a meticulous foundation of conflicts, personalities and mysteries. Dark deeds will be committed for which many characters must atone and mitigate the fallout. We are introduced to Captain Flynt and John Silver as we see how their lives come to be inextricably linked.  The emphasis on drama and island politics in season one also put off some viewers expecting all action.  However, there is some real meat here.  Season 2 picks up where it left off as Captain Flynt and John Silver seek ways out of the predicament that befell them and their crew. All that groundwork laid in season one can flourish as we are given huge chunks of backstory illustrating how Flynt (once known as LT James McGraw) left the British Navy and ultimately became a pirate. His close relationship with Lord Thomas Hamilton and his wife Miranda is given life.  Meanwhile, a ruthless new pirate captain named Ned Low (a historical figure) arrives in Nassau and threatens the natural order. He becomes a direct threat to Eleanor Guthrie (fence for goods and local power broker). Pretty much everyones allegiances will be put to the test. Almost every faction has come into possession of a powerful weapon or bargaining chip. The question is, who is willing to sacrifice the most and still maintain power. Who will sacrifice everything for a dream.

OUTSTANDING CHARACTER & STORY DEVELOPMENT: The character development and complex storylines are part of what really enrich this story. Toby Stephens leads the cast as Captain Flint and displays the capability and charisma needed to inspire the support of a crew. He also projects the vulnerability of someone who knows that support can evaporate at any time. Eleanor Guthrie (Hannah New) is the foul mouthed but oddly cultivated woman who acts as fence (sells the stolen goods to more reputable markets on behalf of the pirates). Behind it all, she is the one that makes it all work and is one of the real powers. Clara Paget plays Anne Bonny (who was a real pirate), a kick butt female pirate with a somewhat assassin quality about her that's fascinating. The political winds that must be channeled to control each ship, or the island power structure itself, are legion. The complex interrelationships of characters are constantly shifting. This is what really makes the story substantial and full of sub plots. In the end, they create an amazing cast of humanized and deeply fleshed characters that are also some of the nastiest people to have ever sailed... ""Under the Black"".

FINAL THOUGHTS: Like some other sensationalized shows on STARZ, this is not a family show. It is not literal history as it is a historical fantasy after all. However, the historical elements they bring in, the monumental detail on ships and sets, character development and plot structure all add great flesh to a skeleton of real pirate history and literary reference. The emphasis on the oddly democratic counter-culture of pirate life, which contrasts the practice of conscription (forced servitude on sailing ships), is a key to understanding the psychology of pirates of that day. They were partly rebelling against this sea culture and ill treatment in real navies (plus the outlawing of privateers that served during wartime). If you are not offended by its darker side, and you appreciate complex story and character development at a literary level, you may discover something special in this show.

****Though a little expensive for its release day price, this will certainly come down and perhaps become an economical way to pick up the first two seasons at some point.",1448755200,41,5435,4.95609220636663

I LOVE this series. It is so beautifully made and very realistic of the time period. You find yourself actually having feelings for these characters. Based loosely on real life pirates, the show never has a dull moment. The scenes are so realistic. It must have cost them a fortune for all the ships and backdrops in this series.
The actors they used are wonderful and believable. This year 2016 will be the forth and final season and if they do it as good as the first 3 seasons, it couldn't be better. I have never felt like a story was left untold, or hanging. They complete every storyline. I am always looking at the clothing and little touches they use, and it is AMAZING. Everything is dirty and raw, just as it probably was in the pirate years. The fight scenes are awesome and the killing is gory and realistic. I have never been interested in real life pirate stories, but the way this is told you can't stop watching. I have bought the first 3 seasons, which I never do with TV series, but I wanted to see it over again!
I honestly can not tell you how ""big"" this series is. Even the opening theme is made with beauty and the music is so telling of the show. They did such a wonderful job on this. I don't know how Starz will ever top this. They went to great expense.
It will be closing at the end of the 4th season, and I am sure they will do it properly, and not like some of the other series made for pay television. If you like rough, gritty, stories you should love this series. Marked R for language, violence and nudity. Very adult, and I love it.",1480723200,,1691,4.2875

The guy with the plastic Walgreen eye glasses was to much, would have been better with no glasses.

Season 1 was very good, but it isn't until season 2 that It explodes.  This show delivers, it's awesome.  Btw it's produced by Michael Bay if anyone cares, not too shabby.

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars are because the discs themselves are so hard to pull out of the case. It's a shame because it's an awesome looking DVD set, but the discs are secured inside a slit which is most difficult to even slide one finger in. I fear I may scratch the discs or damage the overly-tight case by pulling them out too often. A regular plastic ""click-in"" disc holder would have been a better choice but probably more costly on their end- but thats the reason I give it 4 stars.

They're not scratched or dirty, but they stick and skip and some episodes are unplayable. (Fortunately, Starz still has the series on demand.) I've purchased all four seasons -- I'm a collector of pirate stuff -- but haven't watched, or tried to watch, any of them until now. I'm hoping the disc issue doesn't carry over to Seasons Three and Four. So, my advice is, be safe and stream these pirates; you'll save money and aggravation.",1525564800,,693,4.552

8734712,4,B015UOAV9A,"I liked this series, wonderful scenery and actors, but it didn't make it to my great list. The series started out entertaining, showing naked women, good fights, etc., and the characters had a good goal, then the series changed into a prudish (no naked women) homosexual themed show. I don't like to watch naked men, or men kissing, or women kissing for that matter. I closed my eyes during those scenes in Game of Thrones and The Wire. Sons of Anarchy also had too much homosexual stuff for my taste. I stopped watching The Borgias after seeing one episode and Six Feet Under after the first season because both series showed naked men having sex. Too pornographic for me.

I devour fiction, especially fantasy and science fiction. Westworld and Outlander are a couple of my current favorites.

If the above shows don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520812800,,2098,5.3102409638554215

When Black Sails embarks upon it`s first season, the acting and filming are top notch.....The action is superb.....
The plotting is extremely solid for the most part, with some great twists that carry over into the second season.
My wife and I LOVED the first two seasons....
.....BUT......
In season three, the series begins to bog down from the weight of it`s own pretenses, with characters behaving more soap-opera than sea-faring.
History gets trashed as Woodes Rogers, Jack Rackham, Anne Bonney and even Black Beard are twisted to suit the belabored narrative. It`s one thing to take ...'liberties' ...with the fictional characters that Stevenson created...It`s another thing entirely to take the lives and fates of actual people and just do as you please with them. Sadly, many who watch this series will come away believing that they have seen 'history', instead of being mislead with pure fiction instead of fact.  Bizarrely, the truth of these people is both exciting and powerful...why the series chose to create a twisted pseudo- reality of their own is a mystery greater than 'Flint`s Treasure' is ever developed into.

 In the final episodes action scenes become few and fleeting, couched between long, repetitive, muddled existential musings between characters who make less and less sense as the end drags near. That ending is convoluted instead of creative, and the pay-off to all this is simply pathetic.

In the final season, Black Sails sadly sinks into a sea of disappointment for the viewer.

To me, the worst thing about the series is that the characters of Flint and Silver NEVER approach becoming even close to the characters that Robert Louis Stevenson wrote. In the book, Flint--even dead--was a fearsome figure of legend, instilling dread even as a memory. 'Long John Silver' was even more dreaded, with it said that ""Everyone was a-feared o` Flint...But even Flint was a-feared o` Long John Silver!"" I kept waiting to see this 'prequel' bring these characters to the level of legend they deserve...It never happened. Flint comes across as more sad than terrible, and Silver is just a confused fool with little-to-no motivation.
There is nothing here to 'shiver your timbers' about, but you can readily shudder at the time you wasted watching season four hoping for a grand conclusion.
My advice:
Take seasons 1 & 2 down to the coast on your  beach vacation and drink while you watch...
But FORGET seasons 3 & 4..... unless you have plenty of Rum to wash `em down with, Matey !",1505520000,,2524,4.997619047619048
