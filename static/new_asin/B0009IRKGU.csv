The Violent Professionals came to my attention because an Beautiful car I Love is in,for an couple of minutes but it's thrashed around. The Chevy Powered(Corvette Engined)ISO GRIFO.It's the Silver Car,besides that which for me is the Highlight of the Movie,The Beautiful Italian-American Hybird(not the hybrids of today yuck.)The movie has plenty of car chases and action,There is two parts that made me want to give the movie one star:The Scene with the little girl and then later the scene with the Pregnant Woman. It's disgusting. The movie is slow-paced at times but it's an good movie with an interesting plot and twists. I saw this instantly online I believe on youtube the whole thing. I am going to buy it,cause' it's on dvd I've seen and it's not $40-$100 which is ridiculous. Movie is worth watching,one of the better of the genre.",1352592000,2,925,4.860759493670886
8061318,4,B0009IRKGU,"Disclaimer: The version of this film that I saw was included on Video Asia's 'The Grindhouse Experience vol. 1'.  As such, I cannot comment on this OOP release by Wild East -- my review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

'The Violent Professionals', released in 1973, stars Luc Merenda as Giorgio Caneparo, a reckless cop out to find the murderers of his mentor, Vice-Commissioner Del Buono, who had been closing in on a ring of bank-robbers.  Without a sanction from the police department, Merenda dives deep undercover to investigate the Milanese criminal world, and with the help of the mysterious yet beautiful Maria X (Martine Brochard), and with some fancy driving of his own, he eventually works his way into the graces of local boss Padulo (Richard Conte in a nice turn).  But the further Merenda follows the chain of evidence leading to his friend's murder, the more unexpected places it takes him.  In the end, he must pit his personal idea of justice against those of his peers, as well as against outsiders who are disillusioned with a court system that seems to favor the criminal.

The particular sub-genre of crime film that 'The Violent Professionals' falls under - labeled poliziotteschi by Wikipedia - is a new one for me.  Hallmarks of the style are vigilante police, graphic and brutal violence, car chases and corruption - all of which this film indulges in to one degree or another.  In comparison to contemporary films, the violence of 'The Violent Professionals' may not seem terribly graphic, but there is no doubt it is brutal.  This is a hard-edged film, and it is the innocent who are caught in the cross-fire that experience a good deal of it.

The appeal for this film is probably limited to those who appreciate Eurocrime films from this era.  Those viewers groomed on today's action movies may feel that the pace of these earlier efforts is too slow, though I felt like 'The Violent Professionals' - more so than some other films of this time - actually keeps the action moving well.  Prolific director Sergio Martino delivers a solid picture that only occasionally bogs down, but which suffers from a convoluted plot that is sometimes hard to follow - but overall redeems itself in some excellent action sequences involving the bank robbers and Merenda as their get-away driver.  Luc Merenda as the avenging Caneparo is adequate for the role, though I like him better in his grim demeanor with the police rather than the jocular, flip role he plays while ingratiating himself into the gang of thieves.  The supporting cast are unusually good, including a bit part by veteran character actor Luciano Rossi in the opening chapter designed to illustrate Caneparo's ruthlessness.  And although I rarely notice such things, the soundtrack by Guido and Maurizio De Angelis is also quite catchy, with its signature Italian overtones and jazzy interludes.  All in all, a definite recommend for enthusiasts for films of this time period - and for those who are not, it is unlikely to change your mind.

One other note: I am highly suspicious of vigilante cop films, with their tendency to portray a particular line of reasoning in an advantageous light.  Using highly contrived circumstances which nearly force the audience into the hero's - or anti-hero's - corner, sometimes the only opportunity for catharsis is when the criminal is violently terminated.  Even when the difference between sinner and saint is signaled by the thinnest of margins, I'm still tempted to stand and cheer at the climax.  It is important to me to always keep foremost in my mind that these films are a specific kind of entertainment, and not get swept away by their inherent avocation of a policy that seems dangerously short-sighted.  The questions these films raise seem better suited to a forum capable of presenting them fairly, rather than one designed to deliver popular entertainment.  On an entertainment level, 'The Violent Professionals' succeeds.  As an influence on social issues, I think it's best to derive my opinions from other sources.

In almost all ways, I think it could be said that the Video Asia 'Grindhouse Experience' version of this film is an epic fail - presented in non-anamorphic widescreen (black bars on top, bottom, left and right), and obviously taken from a poor VHS copy, it is washed-out, edited, and the soundtrack is poorly reproduced.  I suspect most other DVD versions of this film will be similar, except for the Wild East edition presented on this page, which sounds as though a lot of care was taken with its transfer.  The only problem, of course, is that it is now out of print, and anyone interested is going to be held hostage to the secondary market.  While 'The Grindhouse Experience' is also pricy for only one film, there are enough interesting pictures among the 20 included that it might be a better option - at least to judge your interest in such films, especially if you are as unfamiliar with their style as I was.  Hopefully Wild East will do us all a favor and periodically bring these OOP films back into print, especially when they see the price they bring second-hand.",1299110400,4,5161,4.880870561282933
8061319,3,B0009IRKGU,"Sergio Martino's 1973 poliziotteschi The Violent Professionals aka Milano Trema - La Polizia Vuole Giustizia doesn't exactly reinvent the wheel, but it's one of the better examples of an overpopulated genre, with Luc Merenda playing the typical shoot-first-so-you-don't-have-to-ask-questions-later maverick cop after the gang that killed his boss and several innocent bystanders. Like I said, it doesn't exactly reinvent the wheel, but it does make sure it keeps turning fairly efficiently for 104 minutes. It's not as good as its enthusiastic cult reputation implies, not least because the big twist about the motive behind a series of gratuitously violent bank robberies isn't exactly surprising (like the Red Brigades of the day, the robbers are more interested in spreading chaos than getting rich), but it does get extra points for being one of the few films where, when a car crashes over a hill, it doesn't explode in a ball of fire on the way down. There's also a great spin on the omnipresent car-driving-through-stacks-of-empty-crates shot in one chase scene by having Merenda's car drive through stacks of burning crates that was so popular the footage was reused in at least two other movies (Milano Odia: La Polizia Non Pu&ograve; Sparare and Roma a Mano Armata). Richard Conte is the contractually obligatory American co-star, acquitting himself well despite some hilariously obvious doubling in a fight scene, Tinto Brass regular Martine Brochard makes an attractive junkie and there's a catchy De Angelis brothers score.

The widescreen transfer isn't great - the film could certainly do with remastering - and only offers the dubbed English soundtrack.",1182211200,2,1669,5.370229007633588
