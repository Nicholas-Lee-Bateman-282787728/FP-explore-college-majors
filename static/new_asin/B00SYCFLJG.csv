6994520,4,B00SYCFLJG,"Definitely engaging to watch, and told a side of the slave trade that I was not aware of. The main actress was brilliant, but I thought that the storyline lacked some depth in places, and some of the sudden events were somewhat unbelievable.

I missed the last episode and had to purchase it from Amazon but it was worth every penny.  We need more series like this and less reality series of rich people fighting each other over meaningless crap (i.e. Real housewives of this and that, Hip hop this and that, etc.)",1424563200,19,409,4.230769230769231
6994644,1,B00SYCFLJG,"Was very anxious to watch this series, and ordered episodes 1-2. I began to watch the first episode, only to find out there's no audio what so ever!! I paid 2.99 per episode, and was very disappointed. Doesn't deserve to have stars, when you can't hear it.",1424563200,2,256,4.468085106382978
6994645,5,B00SYCFLJG,I thoroughly enjoyed the 6 epoisodes.  I could not leave the video until I had heard all six.  It is terrific.  I enjoyed the trailers and interviews  on television.  I am going to share it with my three sisters and church family.  It is excellently written and portrayed..,1424476800,5,273,4.583333333333333
6994646,5,B00SYCFLJG,Great story and beautiful cinematography and acting. Definitely recommended. Love that the main character is such a smart and resourceful heroine. It's also very interesting to see so many different kinds of people & sides of the slave trade and revolutionary war as she travels to different cities. I saw other reviews saying the sound was off--seems like that issue is fixed because it worked for me as of 2/21/15.,1424476800,10,416,4.957142857142857

6994650,1,B00SYCFLJG,Great series in quality but Amazon's version has a narrator telling you  what happens before it happens. I am looking to get a refund tomorrow.,1424217600,10,143,4.72

8699821,3,B00SYCFLJG,"[My DVD did not have all the 'extras' that were listed on the cover. It also lacked sub-titles.] That said, I found the Black Loyalists' story really interesting, but the 'heroics' of the characters were implausible in parts. The first and last episodes purported to show the Sierra Leone coast, but these were clearly not 'tropical' locations. Freetown's beautiful, forested hills are not cold, sheer cliffs. In episode one, a naval officer shows Aminata a map of the voyage across the Atlantic. He tells her that she is ""going from here to here"" - but he suggests that their voyage began somewhere near modern-day Gabon, rather than Sierra Leone (Bance Island)! Lots of historical research - insufficient geographic research.",1517011200,,727,5.117647058823529

8699823,5,B00SYCFLJG,This is a masterpiece on the herstory of an African woman who was simply extraordinary. Some parts of her portrayal from the actress made me cringe but overall the cast performances were excellent. Definitely recommended for exposing another aspect of the wide-reaching contributions from African-American history that you won't learn in traditional American History.,1501977600,,367,5.814814814814815
