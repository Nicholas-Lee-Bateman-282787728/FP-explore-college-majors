8590331,4,B00D7AM4DG,"This is based on the true life story of Tony Musulin played in a startlingly vivid performance by Franois Cluzet - `Untouchable'. We are taken back to 2008 and meet Tony doing his job of driving an armoured security van. He delivers millions of Euros to banks and other destinations. He works with two other guards who are both found wanting in the life skills department. One Arnaud carries a pet mouse and has to pay for sex - regularly, and he thinks this makes him a `ladies man'. Tony has a thing for that good life and one day wanders into a car auction where he sees a Ferrari Spyder.

He later goes back and bids for it. He lives above his girlfriend's bar and seems to take her very much for granted. Then one day he snaps and decides he is going to rob his own van. The 11.6 in the title refers to the 11.6 million he manages to steal. This is the true story of how and more importantly why he did it.

This is very well made, with great period attention to detail and a very strong supporting cast. There is a lot of getting into the psyche of Tony which is essential if we are to understand where his real motivation comes from, The sound track is quite god too I even spotted `The National' doing `Fake Empire' which was pretty apt for the on screen action. Not though an action fest and not as thrilling as a `thriller' should be and that is how it is billed, but still a very worthwhile watch and kept me hooked for the 102 minute run time - recommended.",1389744000,,1469,4.205673758865248
