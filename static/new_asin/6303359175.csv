7844999,5,6303359175,"This documentary manages to capture the essence of Frederick Douglass's life and work in an interesting and engaging style.  The narrative is moving and passionate.  Voiceover re-creations of Frederick Douglass's speeches and parts of his books are dramatically authentic and powerful.  Covers a lot of history, includes a lot of information that will be new to many readers of Narrative of the Live of Frederick Douglass, Written by Himself, his first autobiography.  I love this documentary and highly recommend it.",1240617600,,517,5.425
7845000,5,6303359175,"A compelling 90-minute PBS biography tracing Douglass' struggles, ideas, and influences. This sophisicated chronicle examines debates within the abolitionist movement, Douglass' complicated relationship to Lincoln and the Republican party, and Douglass' personal life. A fascinating look at the radical politics of 19th century when blacks were slaves, women couldn't own property or vote, and angry mobs attacked abolitionist speakers for arguing that ""all men are created equal.""",1016064000,2,481,6.1940298507462686
7845001,5,6303359175,"Frederick Douglass surely led one of the most amazing lives in American history, and I think this video does him justice. I just showed it to my freshman American history class, and I was pleased by how many relevant  issues it brought up,while still being entertaining, with good music,  cinematography, etc. Charles Dutton did a good job reading Douglass's  words, also. I thought he was a suprising choice (physically they're so  unalike), but one that paid off. I personally very much enjoyed the  commentary by leading historians like William McFeeley and Vincent Harding.  Some viewers may be put off by their analysis, thinking that it breaks the  flow of the narrative of his life (some of my students, for example), but I  think the historians provided very valuable, thought-provoking comments.  Everyone should know about Frederick Douglass, and this video would be a  fine introduction if you don't.",961891200,8,911,5.136054421768708
7845002,5,6303359175,"This documentary about Frederick Douglass moved me to tears in several places. The hardship and sadness and tragedy he witnessed and endured would have crushed the life out of most, be he rose above it time after time.
Not only did he rise above it, he turned all his life's experiences into  a blessing and dedicated his life to helping his fellow man.
His life  story is one of history's best stories of triumph against impossible  odds.
And this video tells it particularly well.
Very, very inspiring.",961718400,5,504,4.7701149425287355
