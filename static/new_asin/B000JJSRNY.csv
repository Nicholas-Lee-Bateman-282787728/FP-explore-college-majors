2673206,5,B000JJSRNY,"My DVD collection is now quite extensive and I give away some that I won't return to, but this concert is so good that I watched it twice in two days. It has earned a place on my ""to keep"" shelf. First of all, the filming and the sound are excellent and you almost feel that you are there, in the best seats, of course. Placido Domingo, gray hair and all, still has his powerful voice and real star presence. He sings with two of the greatest current vocal greats, Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon, in a beautifully chosen and most enjoyable repertoire. The orchestra is a good match for the three stars in quality. You won't regret acquiring this DVD. It is an outstanding concert and perhaps there won't be that many more with Placido Domingo singing, rather than conducting,as he does more and more often these days. Highly recommended!",1178928000,60,841,4.576158940397351
2673207,5,B000JJSRNY,"What can I say .....as a Kiwi this is the only way I can see a concert like this and it is well worth owning this DVD.Placido still has the magic of one of the worlds greatest tenors and Rolando is a fitting partner in the realm of tenors. But as always it is the petit framed Anna Netrebko that lifts the hearts of the listeners .from her breath taking first notes to the last she imparts a zest for music that has long been missed in opera houses for many years .What truely was magic was her voice without mic in the final part of La Boheme that showed why she is the best there is ,her pure voice carried clear to the final rows of eager concert goers and they showed their appreciation to someone who is often chided for her less than staid approach to opera ,I know of one of the greatest Divas of all time who will be cheering this young woman on and that is Dame Joan Sutherland who always uplifts other singers as she knows how hard it is to be one. All I can say is long may she reign as the new diva of the 22nd century and may her voice continue to grow in stature for many years to come.",1178668800,6,1100,4.004545454545455
2673208,5,B000JJSRNY,"The dream couple of opera along with Placido Domingo provide many highlights in this well filmed concert from Berlin to celebrate the closing of the Soccer World Cup. I do agree with many of the reviewers that Domingo's diction is exemplary, compared with the new kids on the block. However, I must confess slight disappointment that none of the reviewers make mention that Domingo transposes most of his solo arias than what is originally written, which I am sure is to be expected, given the fact that he was 65 at the time of the recording.

However, Anna and Rolando's performances are incredible. Each aria or duet is sung with such passion and fervour. Highlights are definitely Rolando's 'La Danza' which gets the audience clapping and up on their feet and Anna's 'Quando m'en vo', where she also surprises the audience. Watch the DVD and see what I mean. Reservations aside, this is a classy concert, excellently filmed and the enormous audience of over 12 000 people enjoy every minute. Conductor Marco Armiliato and the Orchestra of the Deutsche Oper provide warm and sympathetic accompaniment to the star singers.",1178323200,25,1124,4.947089947089947
2673209,5,B000JJSRNY,"These concerts with excerpts from the great opera compositions make for a fun , light evening of great music. My whole generation, somehow, grew up thinking that opera was ""square"". The sad thing is my generation is now, practically, culturally underpriveledged, like so many peasants from vast, barren desert lands.  Some of the most gorgeous music ever written was produced by the likes of Rossini, Puccini, et. al. during a time when classical painting was also achieving the highest levels of expertise ever in the entire history of man. Why should this music be systematically passed over then? It should not. Thanks to the tireless efforts of the greatest tenor in the past generation, our beloved ""Iron Man of Opera"", Placido Domingo - who also happens to be the most genuinely likeable person on any stage, this great music IS being brought center stage; and is gaining popularity by leaps and bounds.

  The new kids on the block, Anna Netrebko, and Rolando Villazon do shine nicely in this extravaganza. They bring a wonderful , and spontaneous joy to the works. Exactly what the doctor ordered. Yet it is interesting to ""shop and compare"" these artists, and their unique personal styles they bring to the stage..especially when compared to the inimitable maestro, Sr. Domingo. One would think, ""Oh..65...old, shot, worn out, poor thing""....well,that's what you get for thinking! Au Contrare, mon frer. Just for fun, select Italian subtitles, and listen carefully who sings Italian correctly! Although Rolando ought to be able to do a good job with Italian, he falls well short of the mark.( Albeit he does do a very Italian job of Rossini's "" La Danza"" - close coaching from Placido perhaps?) Rolando's arrows sort of land all over the straw bull's eye...then listen to Placido doing a duet with him and see for yourself how he nails it- Placido's are perfect bull's eyes- every syllable, every note...and much, much more than that....the expression, the 'spinto' it is called; the many subtle nuances of timbre and emotive expression that causes the composition to soar, and majestically so. Once again, we all get a free lesson in how to sing by the greatest tenor of our age. Anna also pronounces the Italian ""e"" as a short ""i"", rather than ""eh"" as it should. But that is a small thing compared to the brightness and sweetness she brings to all of her beautifully done pieces. This DVD is worth the price if you selected only the Domingo tracks alone! I adjure you all not to miss this one. There are five encores, each one more tumultous and joyous than the last.  Also,it is wonderful to see an audience so animated. So often the audience makes you want to ask, ""Are you an audience or an oil painting?"" Thank you, Placido for helping us all to understand and to appreciate this great music...for getting an audience on its feet. Also I would be remiss if I did not praise the orchestra and its young conductor...absolute shining brightness.",1176508800,21,2957,4.847524752475247
2673210,5,B000JJSRNY,"If you love good operaric singing but you're not in the mood for an entire opera, play this festive and informal DVD from the 2006 outdoors Berlin concert. Everybody-the singers,the conductor, the orchestra, the audience-is happy and having a good time. The informality of the concert does not diminish or affect the quality of singing or the orchestra playing. Domingo's almost exclusive involvement with the dramatic/heroic tenor roles has not affected the legato and timbre of his voice, and its expressiveness and lyricism are so beautiful in ""Federico's"" aria from L'Arlesiana. Villazon's clarion and top ring are glorious. Netrebko's voice is bigger, darker and sweeter. In the last encore from Lehar's ""Merry Widow,"" Netrebko overpowers both Doomingo and Villazon in the last high note the three are singing together! The video is sharp and first rate. The audio is well-balanced, and thanks to Armiliato's conducting and fine acoustics engineering, it produces a studio quality sound. This DVD deserves, unquestionably, 5 stars for entertainment and artistic value.

I had not heard him recently (10 or 20 years) and was pleased with the strength and quality of his voice.  His occasional lecherous demeanour toward Anna put me off a bit, but that was probably jealousy.  Rolando Villaz&oacute;n was a new performer to me -- a fine tenor from Mexico.  .

2673249,5,B000JJSRNY,"The Waldbhne amphitheatre is built alongside the Olympiastadion, the venue for the infamous 1936 Summer Olympics.  The Waldbhne achieved notoriety itself in 1965, when the damage caused by a riot at a Rolling Stones concert necessitated a complete renovation.

But on July 7, 2006, the Waldbhne hosted a much more joyous event - a Friday night concert performance by Anna Netrebko, Rolando Villazn and Placido Domingo.  It was a prelude to the final game of the 2006 World Cup, which was played at the Olympiastadion the following Sunday.

In this crowd-pleasing, popular collection, Domingo justifies his legendary status and all three performers justify their superstar status.

It takes Netrebko a little while to warm up, emotionally, but when she does, she sizzles.  In fact, the emotional intensity of the performances is what most distinguishes this concert.  The previous year, Villazn had performed Alfredo in Verdi's La traviata at the Salzburg Festival, opposite Netrebko as Violetta, and there is an obvious chemistry between them.  Here, in the 'Brindisi' from La traviata, Villazn must share his character with Domingo, in their wooing of Netrebko's Violetta.

Throughout the concert, Domingo, at 65, is simply astonishing.  But it is Villazn that shines brightest, and his performance of Rossini's La Danza is the highlight for me.  It is a miracle of breath control, apart from anything else.

The Orchestra der Deutschen Oper of Berlin, under Marco Armiliato, is excellent, and the orchestral overtures and entr'acte are perfectly chosen.

The concert was certainly a lot more fun than the World Cup final itself, which is chiefly remembered for France's Zinedine Zidane headbutting an Italian player.

As a Berlin critic wrote, ""This evening is the stuff of legend.""  Of course, we are justified in our expectations of a superlative level of singing.  It's here in spades --- but there's infinitely more.  A  marvelous development takes place as we WATCH the singers move from formality TO INTIMACY with the adoring audience.  This is unprecedented in my experience of classical music concerts --- I know this is a big claim and I confidently stand by it.  You'll see abundant evidence on your screen.

The entire concert is bouyant and thrilling.  Orchestral episodes are perfectly chosen to confer pacing.  The conductor is obviously at ease & enjoying himself, and the rousing rendition of Rossini's Semirande overture is by far the most zesty and effervescent you're ever likely to hear.

The content of the concert is ideal with a perfect blend of variety, in mood and in pace and where the orchestral items form ideal bridging moments and are also excellent in themselves.

In a concert of superlatives one can only really pick out the most memorable moments. The first memorable moment for me is Netrebko's dark and creamy `O mio babbino caro' but not for long! The very next number is Villazon's `Ah! Parais! Parais, aster de mon ciel' from Massenet's Le Mage and arguably the finest single track I have ever heard him sing.

Domingo is not to be outdone as he raises the crowd to their collective feet in `No puede ser' from La tabernera del Puerto. Netrebko entrances everyone with Lehar's `My lips' and amazingly fills the stadium when she leaves the microphones at the end of Musetta's `Quando men vo' and the crowd clap enthusiastically through Rossini's `La Danza', once the preserve of Pavarotti.

The orchestra is not to be outdone with a fine performance of Rossini's Semiramide Overture conducted by Marco Armiliato.

Finally all three singers combine to enormous applause as they share Verdi's `Libiamo ne lieti calici' and Lehar's `Dein ist meinganzes Herz' and the camera, scanning across the packed audience at the end, even manages to pick out Gustavo Dudamel on his feet and cheering fit to burst like so many others.

This is a great concert filmed and edited intelligently and respectfully. And when Netrebko does her encore as Musetta (in Quando men vo), it has never been done like this before!! I don't want to be a plot-spoiler, so I won't say more than that she almost stops the orchestra and conductor (the very able Marco Armiliato) dead. They are so shocked they almost stop playing. What a moment. What a voice. What a star she is. Rolando Villazon is left just a little in the dust, behind the other two, panting to keep up, but he holds his own in most of his duets, and I'll cut him some slack since he is still young, and look who he's competing with!

Both are in great voice and Villazon really gets the 20,000 crowd going (in this former 1936 German Olympic venue?) with his sparkling rendition of Rossini's La danza. Netrebko always a star and a delight in any performance is the ""iceing on the cake"" with her charming personality, beautiful voice and great audience communications skills.

All three are clearly genuinely enjoying themselves, and it shows in their performances.  Some of the close-up shots of the spellbound audience also tug at the heart-strings.

I was also curious about Rolando Villazon. Who is going to be the next greatest living tenor? Placido holds that title in my mind, but Rolando is a contender.

My soul is still smiling after watching this disc. If only to have been there, in person, in Berlin on the evening this concert was filmed. The air must have been electric.

The three singers: Domingo, Netrebko and Villazon. Each performed as if inspired by the gods of opera. The energy, the eros, the passion. Netrebko is both beautiful to hear and look upon. Her rendition o f ""O mio babbiono caro"" is breathtaking as is ""Quendo men vo"". Villazon shines with Domingo in the Bizet duet from The Pearl Fishers. The duet in Otello with Domingo and Netrebko is breathtaking.

Actually, I have nothing but more and more praise for this DVD. I loved hearing the Intermezzo from Cavelleria rusticana. I loved all of it. Just beautiful.",1239408000,,930,4.658536585365853

The setting is gorgeous:  a hillside amphitheatre on a summer's eve before sunset, ending with then possibilty of a summer night's storm inundating the scene (but that didn't happen).

We all knoow about Placido, after all he's one of the two surviving ""Three Tenors,"" and he's been on Letterman!  (Just like Madonna!)  But you'll be pleased by the performance of the up-and-comers Rolando Villazon and Anna Netrebko (by the way, gorgeous eye-candy in Blu-ray).

There's a healthy selection of French and Italian composers, but the only German selection (without double-checking the liner notes) was a rousing and boisterous drinking song that was a fitting prelude to the tri-partite finale selctions.

If you have any affection for Placido, you won't be disappointed by this concert disc and the happy selection of his musical companions.",1235001600,3,949,5.203947368421052

While the program itself lacks originality,  the performances of both the orchestra and  soloists are truly outstanding. I would have given this disc a 5-star rating except that I have a couple of minor criticisms. First the camera work is not top-notch in my opinion - it is too abrupt at times and too much use is made of zooms. There are also some very odd camera angles and sometimes the singers are not on screen when they are singing. Video directors of other concerts from the ""Waldbuhne"" have done a much better job in this respect. Secondly, the subtitles are sometimes a little difficult to read - for maximum readability, the white letters should really be overlaid over a grey background. This appears to be a problem with other Blu-ray classical concert and opera releases.",1229904000,6,930,4.734567901234568
2673298,5,B000JJSRNY,"This Berlin concert in Waldbuhne, the largest outdoor arena in Europe, is so great that you can watch over and over again. All three opera stars are brilliant and amazing! Domingo looked older than I thought but he's still a great singer with all the power and techniques. I just hoped he could be around for a long time. Both Netrebko and Villazon sing with such power and confidence as if they want to brag themselves telling how good youth is. Without a doubt, they are new ""BIG"" stars in a new generation. Yes, the vision and audio are at top notch. One drawback is, however, one (at least) of many cameras was probably not in HD so the vision suddenly changes to unclean and grainy look from time to time, which is actually rather annoying.

The set is enchanting.
I first saw this concert on the TV and I instantly fell in love with it. I was so happy when I found it on DVD.
Rolano Villazon had a smashing success with Rossini's La Danza. Netrebnco followed with Quando men vo in a superb interpretation. I am not her fan, but I really liked her performance at this time.
This is a must-have for anyone who loves opera, but not only.

How can you possibly top that? Quite simply you can't - it just does not get any better than this. As it says in the DVD booklet, it is musically intoxicating - the evening is the stuff of myth.

You feel as if you were there on the front row. The other importat issue is to see how much enjoyed the three superstars their own show. Maybe they spent much better times than the audience.

2673320,5,B000JJSRNY,"A stunning operatic DVD!

This DVD was recorded live at the open air Waldbuhne  amphitheater in Berlin on July 7, 2006. It features Placido Domingo, Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon with Marco Armiliato conducting the Orchester der Deutschen Oper Berlin. The program featured a medley of cherished operatic staples.

20,000 people got to witness one superb performance after another on this pleasant summer's evening; what thrill it must have been to have actually been there. Domingo, looking grayer and somewhat older, has lost none of his voice over the years nor any of his passion; he seemed a comfortable fit for the rising stars of Netrebko and Villazon.

Highlight of the disc:
So many to choose from, so obviously a subjective choice; but I'd have to pick  Netrobko and Villazon (as Mimi and Rodolfo) singing the love duet ' O soave fanciulla ' from Puccini's ""La Boheme"". Being a sentimentalist, this piece has always had a emotional effect on me, but none much stronger than rendition performed here. Stirring to watch.

And finally, and I guess it goes without saying, but you really need a decent stereo system to appreciate this disc; I initially played this DVD through a friend's TV speakers and the quality (sound) was disappointing to say the least. However on a home theater system the full, rich quality of the music was evident.  5 Stars, more if I could.

R. Nicholson",1187913600,4,1392,4.8936170212765955
2673321,5,B000JJSRNY,"Yes, Netrebko, Villazon, and Domingo all sing as perfectly as we could imagine.  But the surprise for me was the acting and passion that each brought to this outdoor performance before a gigantic and appreciative audience.

First, it's Netrebko, swaying to the music and almost dancing as she sings the line, ""My mother was a dancer"" from Franz Lehar's Giuditta.

Later, Villazon captivates the audience with a rousing, delightful, ""Italian Wedding-style"" La Danza by Rossini.  Alongwith the audience, Netrebko is so inspired that she's still dancing, as he leads her out for her La Boheme aria.

As twilight approaches at this outdoor ""forest concert"" in Berlin, the night is capped off by all three, performing a Lehar song, ""Dein ist mein ganzes Herz"" (""You are my only love""), in which Domingo and Villazon alternate their wooing, each pulling Netrebko towards them.  Alternating her own flirtations, she puts the cherry on the sundae with  a high note that brings down the house.  It just doesn't get any better than this.

I was so enthusiastic about this concert that I invited friends over to see whether I was just bewitched, or if they too, found it enchanting.  Indeed, they too found it irresistible.

2673322,5,B000JJSRNY,"Filmed outside in widescreen before 20,000 fans who gathered along the steep hollow of western Berlin's famous Waldbhne amphitheatre on July 7, 2006, this live concert, featuring Plcido Domingo, Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazn is a photogenic spectacle to behold and a musically thrilling experience for those who not only enjoy opera, but enjoy the best of opera rolled into nearly two hours of familiar melodies, one after the other. As a technical achievement, this DVD is a high quality offering for those who like the ""you are there"" feel of a live performance - large crowds, a colorful stage, beautiful scenic vistas and panoramic sweeps of an appreciative audience gathered to witness a true operatic event. This DVD has it all: clear and resonant digital sound, crisp, colorful video, and smart cinematography. The sun sets and the mood changes at just about mid-point, when the orchestra under the direction of Marco Armiliato begins the Intermezzo of Mascagni's ""Cavalleria rusticana"" The intimacy of this show that existed from the opening overture of Verdi's ""Nabucco"" got even more intimate when the stage lights came on and the richness and color of the stage grew even more pronounced when lit against a stygian sky. As for the performances, a gray bearded, mature 65-year old Domingo still has the voice and the star appeal, such that even when the younger Netrebko and Villazon shared the stage, it was Domingo who was the center of attention, and who was most attuned to the tempo of the orchestra and the lead given by Armiliato. Both Villazon and Netrebko were each on at least one occasion following their own lead out in front of the orchestra and its conductor. I've heard that Ms. Netrebko has done this in the past. Well, she did it here, too; bad form, really bad form for a DIVA. Still, this is a spectacular DVD and a good one to show friends who wonder what the lure is all about.

2673323,5,B000JJSRNY,"This is a MUST for opera lovers!  The three - Domingo, Netrebko,and Villazon were not only excellent in voice and charisma, but also in their selections.

2673324,5,B000JJSRNY,"I got this DVD from the mail last month and view it once with enjoyment, to see the current golden couple of the opera world in action, and ,of course, the enduring placido Domingo in his midsixties and still doing magic; this I can't help thinking about Jerry Hadly who at 55 lost his voice and in debt and in a depression killed himself and is brain dead in a hospital at this moment.  I can't help also thinking about people who know how to manage their lives and those who don't, in this case you do know who does and who doesn't.  This is no place to discuss other people's personal lives.  So, I'll leave it right here.  Certainly, I watched the DVD in its entirety before I write this review, I enjoyed it more the second time because I was wide awake.  However, at my age, I can't open my eyes all the time; actually, I have to close them most of the time so I missed the commotion created by Netrebko while she sang Musetta's Waltz, If you add ten years to Domingo's that would be about my age.  I have a feeling that you can't put up with my rambling anymore, I'm sorry, I'll stop right here.

Domingo starts his program with a difficult to sing famous aria from L'Alessiana that only he can deliver at 65.  It's amazing that at his age he still can sing like this, of course, Roberto Alagna does a much better job in his debut album.  Netrebko, then sings beautifully 'O mio babbino caro' from 'Gianni Schicchi' although the aria doesn't exactly fit her vocal cord. Villazon then displays his singing skill the aria 'Ah! Parais' from his famous GOUNOD/MASSENET album.  Next on, the caressing duet from Verdi's Otello.  Here, I would like very much to introduce a DVD of the Met's production of Otello with Renee Flaming, Domingo, and James Morris. Flaming is simply divine in the role of Desdemona.  She sings and act beautifully and naturally.  I don't have to say anything about Domingo, Otello is his most prominent signature role.  And James Morris gives me goose bumps in his evil invoking soliloquy, I don't know the name of the piece, you'll know when you watch the DVD anyway.  I simply can't help letting other people know about good stuff.  Then the Carmen moutain Entr'acte.  The famous tenor/baritone duet from the Pearl Fisher.  Here, again, I would like to introduce a beautiful complete opera set CD from EMI with Barbara Hendricks, John Aler, and Gino Quilico.  Though, Domingo and Villazon sing well, but they are both tenors the voices don't blend as well as tenor/baritone.  You can get carried away by John Aler's 'Je crois entendre encore' even if he doesn't end the aria in the high region.  And Hendricks happens to be very good too. And Michell Plasson, a Frenchman conducts a French opera there should't be any problem.  There you go, another good thing for you.

Good and exciting numbers continue till the end.  Things get more exciting as the concert proceeds.  The three of them sure know how to generate reciprocation with the audience.  And the audience, according to the disc box cover there were 20,000 of them and I believe it, view from the TV screen it's huge.  I would like to mention one more number on the program, it's from Lehar's operetta 'Giuditta'.  Netrebko does a very good job of course, but I would still love to introduce Elisabeth Schwarzkopf's OPERETTA ARIAS album.  13 songs altogether, everyone of them is a gem, and she is of course the genuine article.  This album has been with me for over three decades and yet my fondness for it never fades.

Here you go, a five-star DVD for you and at discount price too.  I have to pay expensive shipping cost but you don't.",1184457600,4,3629,4.552469135802469

Someone mentioned to me that it was probably the last open-air concert of Placido Domingo, who would be dedicating now his music life as maestro. The new voices of both Villazon and Ana Netrebko proves that opera will last forever.",1184198400,,366,4.6461538461538465

2673327,5,B000JJSRNY,"Without getting too wordy at the expense of leaving something out, let me just say that this concert is an absolute delight. Domingo, Netrebko and Villazon complement one another perfectly - a great matchup of stars who also receive very strong backing by the Orchester der Deutschen Oper Berlin under the baton of Marco Armiliato. If you watch this on a home theater system as opposed to not being able to watch it live, the DTS surround really adds to the impact of these performances, not to mention the excitement that stirs up the audience throughout. Very highly recommended!",1182729600,4,581,4.878787878787879

2673329,5,B000JJSRNY,"Once in a while, everything works. This is a magnificent success, for all three artists. My thought when it began was that this event would be the passing of the torch from Domingo to Villazon, the best of the the recent tenors to today's best, with today's best soprano thrown in for good measure. In part,it is that. But in the whole, it is much more. Domingo started slowly, but by the end of things, he had shed 3 decades and a little coarseness- everybody on the stage was in their 30's and madly in love with life. These are three colleagues, consumed with music and the need to share it, and brought to new heights by each other's art and spirit. It was thrilling to see the audience brought deeper into the magic of the moment with each new aria, duet, and,finally, with the two encore trios- they were swaying, dreaming, and realizing that they were now part of this magic, and part of a night that they would always remember.
At the end, the two tenors were playfully vying for the beautiful soprano, but it never seemed cliched or sexist, even when Placido went so far as to pinch her chin. The feminist wars of the proceeding generations are over. Anna Netrebko had nothing to prove. There was no question, in her mind or in ours, that she was sharing the stage with her equals, effortlessly and joyfully, displaying a power and confidence the match of any I have seen before, male or female.
However, to me, the revelation of the night was Rolando Villazon. I saw him for the first time live in the Los Angeles production of La Traviata last September, where he stole the show from Rene Fleming, and convinced me that he is the best tenor around. But he is more than that. He has the potential to be, if he isn't already, the best tenor since Edison's invention of the phonograph.  Just as Callas melded music and drama last century, the public will be not be able to accept a singer who is careless or incomplete in his art, or lacking in passion, after they have experienced this young tenor.
I could go on, but I will close by commenting on only one number that he sang so successfully that it was brought it to a new level: Rosini's ""La Danza"".  He sang it with the exuberance and abandon of the young Mario Lanza, the intelligence and finesse of the great Jussi Bjoerling, and a musicality and personality so complete- so much his own in style and intensity, that he left all of the dozens of past performances I have heard of this old warhorse trailing in his dust. I feel as if I have never really heard ""La Danza"" before this incredible performance, done with a naturalness that both enchants and draws you in. From the sound of the audience, I am not the only one who was enchanted.",1181606400,11,2704,4.438631790744467
2673330,5,B000JJSRNY,"""The Berlin Concert"" with Domingo, Netrebko and Villazon features singing in five languages - Italian, French, German, Spanish and English - and a nice mix of orchestral and vocal music.  The low point of this DVD is Domingo's appearance:  he looks like Sadam Hussein's twin brother.  The terrific high point is the set of individual and ensemble encores.  Here opera fans get to see a soprano steal the show from TWO tenors!  What's not to like about that?",1180051200,4,457,4.8076923076923075
