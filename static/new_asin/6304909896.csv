Robert Patrick as Koga Shuko, (common spelling?? I dunno), so much win. Way better than his T-1000 performance...and so much amazing, traditional martial arts action. I especially loved that they had to rub the medallion in a very ""I Dream of Jeanie"" fashion to call upon its mystical powers. I mean wearing it shouldn't be enough, am I right guys?

946873,5,6304909896,"Double Dragon is a fun little action movie based on the video game of the same name.

In the movie, brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee must protect a piece of a magic medallion from an evil crime lord called Shuko. Shuko is able to use his half of the medallion to possess people. Throughout the film, Billy and Jimmy are helped by their guardian Satori, and by their friend Marian. Some of the other characters include Linda Lash, and Abobo.

The film is very lighthearted, and it plays out like a Saturday Morning cartoon. It's an enjoyable movie, and I recommend it to people that love cartoonish movies.",1453507200,,601,4.555555555555555

947027,3,6304909896,"If Double Dragon was even remotely worth watching, one would think it was because of really great martial arts action alone, but that's not the case. The fight scenes are actually terrible, very poorly choreographed, and unimpressive. Anyone with a brown belt and some wires can do the moves seen here. However, Alyssa Milano and Robert Patrick do have a way of taking even the worst movie they're in and kicking it up a couple notches.  What really spares this movie from a bad review here are two of the funniest lines I've ever heard in a movie - and I mean ever!  I've been able to make people laugh every time I quote this flick.",1355616000,,634,4.456896551724138
947028,4,6304909896,"Now one of the major gripes with this movie is that it doesn't follow the story of the video game. I am having a hard time comprehending why people would want a cookie-cutter storyline that follows the game. Everyone would have blasted it for being too similar, and I applaud the writers for trying something different. Nowadays everyone blasts movies for what it should have been, instead of enjoying it for what it is. Needless to say, Double Dragon is great light-hearted fun, and it doesn't take itself seriously. I still have fun watching it and maybe you will too.",1301875200,,570,4.71
947029,3,6304909896,"I bought this movie the other day just for a lil blast from the past take me back to my younger years watching.  I love the old 90s cheesy movies (The Pest, Super Mario, Surf Ninjas, etc). I remember my mom renting Double Dragon for me when I was a young un' and I was scared to death of Abobo.  Anyways, that is kind of the mindset you must get into before watching this movie, its just bad fun.

Movies based on martial arts video games always have a lot of trouble adapting.  Thats because there really isn't a story line.  If you are a fanboy then yes you probably know all the back story of every Street Fighter/Mortal Kombat character, but for the most part to the average person, it is just punch, kick, fight with no plot.  I believe that is why the stories seemed forced on screen.  This movie is no different.  This is purely for the Dragon fans, not something you want to watch for serious entertainment.

The script is immature and the acting and characters are equally as horrible.  Robert Patrick and Mark Dacascos are great actors in my opinion and they gave some boost, but Scott Wolf is just terrible.  He totally ruins Billy Lee's character.  I did enjoy looking at Julia Nickson.  Lets just face it, there is no reason mentioning anyone else.  The cast does nothing to help save the movie.  The characters are all idiots, there is very little serious martial arts.  Watch this with your old friends that were Double Dragon fans and appreciate how far special effects have come and have a laugh.

Do yourself a favor, if you want a dose of dragon, pick up Double Dragon: Shield of Shadow Kahn.  Yes it is a cartoon, but it still goes hard, a lot more entertaining than the movie.  Other than that, this is a guilty pleasure, something worth having just to show your kids what we used to think was awesome back in the day.",1296259200,,1839,4.403560830860534

I does not follow the story to the video game though, it has some of the characters from the game which is of course Billy (Scott Wolf) and Jimmy Lee (Mark Dacascos), Marion (Alyssa Milano), Linda, and Abobo. This was more of a action/comedy with pretty good fighting scenes. It was far better than the street fighter movie (Van Damme's version). If you are a fan of the game which i am you may not like it by the plot but i did. It could use a reboot though with characters that fit and a better story, but this wasn't that bad.",1267315200,,716,4.158273381294964

947116,2,6304909896,"After the disaster that was the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-Bros/dp/B00008979N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario Bros.</a>&nbsp;movie, ""Double Dragon"" had the chance to set future game adaptations on the right track. It certainly seemed simple enough: with a slew of martial arts stars available to them and a premise that was all about kicking butt, where could it go wrong? Well, let me count the ways...

The story: In a dystopian Los Angeles, evil billionaire Koga Shuko (Robert Patrick,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-2/dp/B001VLBDD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 2</a>) seeks to dominate the city through the use of a magical artifact called the Double Dragon. One half is easily obtained, but the other is in the hands of karate-practicing brothers Jimmy (Mark Dacasos,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brotherhood-of-the-Wolf/dp/B00006ADEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brotherhood of the Wolf</a>) and Billy Lee (Scott Wolf,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Party-of-Five/dp/B0001IN0T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Party of Five</a>).

I won't even get into how much the film's plot and tone deviate from the video games, but know that the film's age appeal stops at 10. Jimmy and Billy spend less time fighting than they do running and cracking bad jokes, and when they do fight, it's against slobbering gang members and a guy in the worst monster costume I've ever seen (Henry Kingi,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Predator-2/dp/B00007AJG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Predator 2</a>). While the adventure aspects of the film are decently done, don't hold your breath for decent acting or writing.

To the film's credit, fight choreographer Jeff Imada (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rapid-Fire/dp/B000065B08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rapid Fire</a>) apparently took a page out of Jackie Chan's playbook and had the fights incorporate the environment more than most other U.S. action films were doing: using a street cone as a weapon, stopping an attacker with a swinging car door, etc. In addition, Mark Dacasos' legitimate martial arts talent shows. Though there's no decent one-on-one showdown that lets him shine, his skill and athleticism are apparent. Scott Wolf, however, is less of a worker. The guy wasn't a martial artist to begin with and he didn't become one for the film. Most of his moves consist of sloppy-looking kicks that any kid in front of a TV can do, shoving his opponents, and...well, running.

As an adaptation, ""Double Dragon"" is unfaithful, and as an action movie, it's lame. Throw in Shuko's ridiculous hairstyle and the knowledge that it was directed by a man who had only directed pop concerts and video packages (James Yukich) and you've got yourself a film that's easy to hate. Put it out of your minds.",1222387200,2,3033,6.613065326633166

947118,3,6304909896,"The Double Dragon dvd has been out of print for nearly three years now. Double Dragon has always been one of those movies in the sense that people either love it or hate it. People have often bashed this movie complaining about how it doesn't relate very well to the arcade and nintendo games. While that may be true, the film definately relates to the Neo-Geo version of Double Dragon. As for the movie itself, it is definately a B-flick though I personally found it to be entertaining. Double Dragon is without question an action/comedy. Though some argue that there is more comedy than action, I say that both the action and the comedy blend well. The humor is a bit dumbed down at times mainly due to Scott Wolf's cheesy yet catchy one-liners as well as the character of Abobo getting transformed into a mutated imbecile. For those of you who are familiar with Mark Dacascos, his martial arts performance is good in this movie along with Robert Patrick's character, Alyssa Milano's and Linda Lash's good looks, and the overall setting of futuristic Los Angeles. Now onto the uncut dvd... It is important to note that despite the feature listings on this website, there are no cast & crew filmographies or any production notes to speak of. The uncut version is in full frame versus widescreen. So is the uncut version worth it? Normally I would not care about a movie including four extra mintues of added scenes though in this case the four extra mintues of added scenes are worth viewing. If you wish to view Double Dragon, decide which version you would prefer; the original widescreen version or the full frame uncut status?",1149984000,15,1631,4.706293706293707
947119,3,6304909896,Most video game based movies are bombs and this one stands out above some of the ones that cames before it. Mark Darascos is a great martial-artist and this film gives just a taste of what he can do.,1138665600,,199,4.128205128205129

we want double dragon!!!

what a joke, why do u ppl made a movie that based on the cartoon that based on the video game, the DD original spirit somehow lost in this new cartoon, and now you were making a movie based on it?

why didn't u ppl just make a movie straight out of the video game, throw in some good martial arts, make the DD the 2 greatest fighter in the world, make them travelling around the world beating the hell out of everyboby, maybe everyone will buy it and you ppl will have to make DD da movie 2, 3, 4... who knows? after this disaster, the DD series went down like hell...

The other half is in their mentor's hands. That's the plot, now let me tell you about the funny stuff. Fat boy was pretty clever with the ugly and homely joke. Poking at ya clown boy! Look at my arse, it's so big (Alyssa Milano's asset). Julia Nickson was cheated and was the best thing that happened to this movie.

Set in the futurewe see two brothers (Mark Dacascos and Scott Wolf) become involved in a billionaires (Robert Patrick) plan to achieve ultimate power through a mystical medallion, the Brothers must prevent that from happening as the Double Dragon medallion holds the key to their true power and destiny.
There is plenty of Martial Arts action (Mark is particularily good at this!)and the usual special FX, sounds like it could have been good?  (if only that were true! ) However... Scott Wolfs character is... obnoxious, it seemed to me he was trying too hard, he had the 'Look at me syndrome' which thankfully Mark didn't suffer from.
In my humble opinion only Mark Dacascos shone in this movie! if not for him I wouldnt hesitate in giving this a ZERO or a minus rating!  However I have generously given 2 stars instead, if you do watch this movie be warned, there are better Game to movie titles available like Mortal Kombat and Wing commander (which wasn't even good! ) So think before you try!",958262400,6,1101,4.699481865284974

The video game series was much better and much more hardcore and more realistic fighting.  Fist of all, if  you are going to cast a member from Party of 5 in a so called `action'  movie, then you as a producer or casting person better fire yourself  forever.  Not retire, fire yourself.  There is little martial arts for me  and my fellow martial arts fans to even try to enjoy.  Mark Dacascos is  such a talented martial artist and this film does not let him reach his  full potential (luckily for us there is the movie `Drive' - there is a  god).  The cover is a total sell out.  The villains on the back are not all  used, oh sure they are used but some are only just in the background.
Double Dragon, lots of potential, yet the Power Rangers movie is better  than this.
That's sad.
