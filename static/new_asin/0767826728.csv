11653,3,0767826728,"This sequel sticks to the tried and true formula of slasher flicks: trap a group of people in one location and slowly pick them off one at a time.  The body count is marginally higher.  Creatively speaking, it doesnt offer anything new to the genre.  But at least Jennifer Love Hewitt can add screaming to her list of talents.  The plot follows the two survivors of the first film.  At this point, Julie James (Hewitt) is prone to nightmares, providing false reality to add some much needed horror elements.  She is separated from boyfriend Ray (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) in distance and priorities.  Julie and her roommate Karla (Brandy) prove they have no knowledge of capitals and can't recognize a FAMILIAR voice that they are well acquainted with on a daily basis.  They think theyve won a FREE trip to a crappy resort in the Bahamas.  A resort almost barren of guests and staff.  Nothing suspicious there!  And its not the least bit worrisome when bloody bodies go missing, someone having cleaned up the crime scenes in an instant: spotless!  Blood is not that easy to clean up!  The rest of the movie requires a lot of running, screaming, hiding, dying..............

Logic aside, this is standard fare, entertaining enough in its own right, but nothing special.  The extra, tacked on ending, is a bit of a cheat and doesnt really work.",1478131200,,1338,4.756521739130434
11654,3,0767826728,"One of the staples of the slasher genre has been the quick turnaround for a sequel.  While the 90s resurgence in the genre tried to change many things about the genre, the quick sequel was not one of them.  Thats why, a year after the first came out, we got I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.  It needed more time to iron out some serious plot issues (and considering this is a slasher, thats saying something).

As the movie opens, its been a year since fisherman Ben Willis (Muse Watson) stalked Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and Ray (Freddie Prinz, Jr.)  and their friends and two years since the four friends hit Ben with their car and left him for dead.  Julie is still struggling through all that has happened, which is why she finds herself struggling with grades while in summer school again and having recurring nightmares.

Things are looking up when her friend and roommate Karla (Brandy) wins a trip for four to the Bahamas over the 4th of July.  When an invited Ray doesnt show, Julies friend Will (Matthew settle) joins Carla, Carlas boyfriend Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer), and Julie for this trip.  They arrive on the island just before the first storm of the season hits, leaving them stranded as the only guests on the island.  But a message for Julie leaves her convinced that they and the skeleton staff are in danger.  Is she right?  And what happened to Ray?

The film actually gets high marks right away for addressing the tag from the previous film and trying to give us some character development for Julie and Ray.  Unfortunately, in an effort to increase the tension, we get several painfully obvious false scares before we get to the island and the movie really begins.

Now heres the part where Im going to be painfully stupid.  One of my problems with this film is all the people who are killed when Julie and Ray are the real targets.  I get that this is a slasher film.  I truly do.  That means lots of people have to die.  But I don't get why we are going after the people who do die.  In the first film, the collateral damage victims make a little bit of sense, but not quite as much here.  And this doesnt bother me in the Scream films like it does here, either.  Go figure.

So leaving my personal issues aside, we do get some decent stalk and kill sequences and a mix of sympathetic and annoying characters to be eliminated.  This part is all well done, and when the storm hits and the killing starts, its easy to feel the tension building.

Which brings me to the part that feels rushed.  In an effort to provide a twist to the story (required of all slashers, especially during the 90s), we learn a bit more about Ben, but none of that makes sense.  Even watching the movie knowing what will unfold, it feels like it is forced into the film.

And, despite efforts to set things up earlier, the climax still feels a bit du ex machina for my tastes.  Then theres one characters fate, which makes no sense.  Plus don't get me started on the final scene.  What worked in the first film definitely doesnt work here.

The acting is still decent, and I don't find anything to pull me out of the film.  Thats impressive considering the script the cast had to work with.

And Id be remiss if I didn't point out that the accident that started the whole rampage was actually two summers ago now, so the title really doesnt work either.

The thing with 90s slasher movies is they tried to be more intelligent than the ones that had come during the slasher mania of the 80s.  Sadly, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer fails in those efforts.  There are still some decent death and chase sequences, so die hards of the genre will want to check it out.  But be sure to turn off your brain before you start watching it.",1476748800,,3746,4.405247813411079

11659,5,0767826728,"I grew up with these slashers of the 90's. I recently re-watched them in honor of Independence Day, and I still love them. They might've even grown on me. I appreciate the suspense more, the kills, the great music as the Fisherman stalks his prey. I liked that you could see his face more in this one, now that we know who he is and why he continues to stalk Julie James.

Another year has passed, and Julie is still traumatized after the events of the first film. She constantly has nightmares about Ben Willis. Her new best friend, Carla tries to get her to be more outgoing. One day, Carla wins a trip to the Bahamas, and takes Julie, her boyfriend, Tyrell, and new guy, Will. Ray tries to come but he's hospitalized after a run-in with the Fisherman. Once they get to the island, they realize it's an off season and storms the whole time. Soon enough, Ben Willis shows up to stalk Julie and her friends and kills anyone who gets in his way. Ray is on a mission to make it to the Bahamas and stop Willis once and for all. I thought this was a great continuation and a nice conclusion, but it was ruined when I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer was made. It has absolutely nothing to do with this film or the original, so do yourself a favor and don't watch #3. I do however highly recommend I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER!!!",1467676800,,1340,4.254901960784314

11668,4,0767826728,"Released in 1998, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer chronicles events of the summer after the previous movie. Julie James best friend wins tickets to the Bahamas and so they go down there with their boyfriends (Jennifer Love Hewitt, Brandy Norwood, Mekhi Phifer & Matthew Settle). Shortly after arrival they discover its off-season and storms ensue. Bodies increasingly pile up as Ray from the first film tries to get to the island (Freddie Prinze Jr.). Also on hand are John Black, Jennifer Esposito, Bill Cobbs and Muse Watson.

I didn't have fond memories of this film, but I surprisingly found myself liking it quite a bit on my second viewing. By switching the locations to the Bahamas it completely changes the dynamics even though theres a slicker-killer like the first movie. Suspense slowly builds as the cast is whittled down and the storm rages. It suddenly becomes clear that they're stuck on this vacant resort with a mad killer! Although the filmmakers couldve taken more advantage of the resort location they did a good enough job. Bottom line: This is a worthy sequel with its own appeal.

The film runs 100 minutes and was shot at El Tecuan Marina Resort, Costa Careyes, Jalisco, Mexico (standing in for the Bahamas), and USC, Los Angeles, California.

11672,3,0767826728,"I am an eighties baby so being how I was born in the golden age of horror films it should be no surprise that I'm a huge fan of the genre, in fact it's my favorite genre by far. I think it is human nature to be nostalgic about certain things. It's why the WWII generation hated rock & roll, and why baby boomers hate hip hop, because it's not from THEIR
time so somehow it's inferior. Because of this when the 90's came along and all of the great horror series of the bygone decade were running out of steam (Halloween, Friday the 13th, A nightmare on elm street) horror movies were still around just not being pumped out week after week at the cinemas. That's until scream arrived in '96 giving the horror genre much needed jolt in the arm.

Seemingly overnight they were back again, one new film after the other and we as horror fans couldn't have been happier!

Okay, okay, okay, I know what your thinking, this is suppose to be a customer review of I still know...and this guy is giving us a history lesson on the genre as a whole, but there's a method to my madness, you see I remember being excited when I saw the first I know what you did...I remember enjoying it, and of coarse when I heard of a sequel I was more than sold on going to see it, which I did, and enjoyed it! Enjoyed it when it came out on video, hec, I even bought the DVD which I still have to this day, but all of those years I watched the actually thinking it was a quality film, it ISN'T! What changed my mind you ask well a little thing called growing up, and when you grow up hindsight is 20\20.

You see I know now why I really thought this film was good when I was a kid, HORROR was back back in a big way so I would, and did go to see any and everything back then and usually enjoyed the movies, but know as an adult I realize this movie is goofy at best.

I think I first realized it one night a few years ago when I caught it on tv. Nothing else was one so I decided to watch
it. It was like I was seeing it for the first time with new adult eyes and I realized how ridiculous it was.

I could go into the plot in more detail but if you guys are reading this you probably already know the deal. Let's just say JLH survived ""slicker guy"" in the first film and now his back to finish the job, but this time there on an island with a scary old guy, someone who I think may be Jack Black in a bad wig, and POP STAR BRANDY! It's ridiculous from start to finish, from how they are lured to the island, why they are lured to the island and the goofy kills that happen throughout.

There are things that happen that are so ridiculous(Freddie Prinze Jr's character hijacking a boat at gunpoint and sailing through a storm, at NIGHT no less to save his ladylove but I mean it's JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT after all, you wouldn't do the same?

Despite realizing now as an adult that this movie was simply just a way to cash-in further on the who's the killer genre before the public lost interest it still is entertaining and fun to watch!

If you've been living under a rock and somehow have never seen the I know what you did...films watch the first one first (a much better, well made film) than watch this one next, but when watching the sequel forget about LOGIC, and good storytelling, just seat back and enjoy a bunch of pretty actors running around an island being chased by a guy in a raincoat!

Is this movie good? - Not in the slightest bit!
Is this movie entertaining? - HELL YES!!!!!!

P. S. Don't forget to checkout a certain character's death by hook that is quite possibly the WORST CGI ever in the history of CGI, it's hilarious!!!!!!",1436745600,,3618,4.141025641025641

11675,3,0767826728,"I have seen this movie when I rented it years ago.  It was ok, but It just wasn't that great to me.  What would of made this a better movie, is to have kept all four of the main characters alive from the first film and probably have kept the scenario in Southport, then maybe kill off two of them in this second installment.  One thing I didn't like was out of nowhere, added the two new characters to the movie.  Notice on the third installment of this franchise, 'I Always Know What You Did Last Summer', they added a whole new group of people.  This to me just killed off the movie all together and the interest to.  I might buy this DVD later on.  Still deciding.

11682,3,0767826728,"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer takes place one year after the events of I Know What You Did Last Summer. Julie is now in college, taking Summer classes in Boston; trying to avoid Southport to put the past behind her. The past still haunts her on a regular basis however as she constantly has visions and dreams of the murderous, vengeful fisherman, Ben Willis coming after her.

That afternoon, Julie and her best friend, Karla win tickets for 4 for a getaway to the Bahamas for 4th of July weekend via radio station call-in after answering the question of the capital of Brazil correctly.....or incorrectly. While Karla brings her boyfriend, Tyrell along on the trip; Julie plans on asking Ray, her boyfriend from the previous film to come along, but he initially declines out of frustration of her refusing to visit him in Southport. With Ray's ticket now on the table, Karla brings along her best friend, Will, who has a crush on Julie---and off they go!

Once the 4 arrive in the Bahamas, they discover that others have left due to a tropical storm on the way. With it just being the 4 of them plus hotel staff, things seem to go great so far...until Julie begins receiving mysterious notes, reminding her of ""what she did"" and until the staff and crew begin getting gruesomely killed off one by one by a familiar hooded figure with a hook for a hand. What Julie hoped to be a peaceful and relaxing Summer has now turned into another hellacious nightmare. Some things you just can't bury.

Overall: This was an okay sequel. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer moves away from the suspenseful thriller kind of movie that viewers witnessed in its predecessor and transitions to more of a slasher horror. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprise their roles from the first film as the couple of Julie and Ray. Logic doesn't seem to play much of a factor in this movie which definitely deducts stars from this rating. For example the entire radio call-in scene is questionable in terms of answering the question correctly. Also, Julie is constantly receiving reminders saying ""I know what you did last Summer""; but in this case, shouldn't have been 2 Summers ago, considering that's when it all started? Or is the killer now mad about supposedly getting killed off last Summer? I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is one of those movies that have you asking too many questions throughout the duration of the film. The acting is subpar on certain levels as well. This would mark the last of the I Know What You Did films to feature any of the original cast and crew as a third sequel released in 2006 titled ""I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer (avoid at all costs) featured a fresh new cast. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer gets a B+ in terms of gore and kills but the movie overall deserves a C - or maybe even a D",1410220800,,2849,4.517441860465116

11692,3,0767826728,"This is one of those movies that got a second shot probably because Scream did.  The only difference was that Scream was actually creative and made fun of silly movies like this one.  Throw in every horror/slasher movie cliche this one had it.  I am all for having to suspend disbelief when watching one of these movies, but things like the killer being able to movie bodies around in a short period of time, and leave no trace of blood is just stupid.  Unlike the plot twist revealing the killer in the first movie, this one was easy to spot a mile away.  Plus we are subjected to Jack Black as a dreadlocked stoner.

The two things that this one had going for it is that the dialog was not as schlocky and stupid as it was in the first one.  And, despite the tease at the end of the movie, they thought better of making any more of these.  Like the predecessor I do not think this is a must see or must own.

11697,1,0767826728,"Just watched this the other night for poops and giggles, holy jesus it's awful. You can see the twist the second you meet the character and everyone plays their crappy cardboard cut-out roles like a factory produced them. Really it's so unremarkable, so what's the appeal? Well the first one was a big success, so obviously it's riding on the coat tails, but what is it about dumb kids being underwhelmingly picked off by some guy in a raincoat.

Really it was entertaining to me though just because how stupid and typical it was, from the opening 'jump scare' where the white virgin wakes up in the middle of highschool class, I knew I was in for a craptacular 90's slasher. So white virgin wants to work on school like a good girl until her evil fun-loving black friends have her reluctantly come out and meet up with THE MOST OBVIOUS F***ING MURDERE-I mean sweet awkward innocent JC Penny Model # 12. The implications behind this movie are laughably obvious. ""Ohhh she's so sweet and innocent, she deserves to live, but the fat stoner deserves to DIE! Take that people I passively look down on!"".

Also in a packed and crowded club the director knows that another cheap jump scare needs to be tossed in or else the mouth breathing teenagers won't be interested, so white virgin sees a shadow reminding her of the killer until she realizes it's just the dark, but wait, it's the corner of a club with couches and everything, and no one's sitting there? Have any of them actually been to a club or did they have to ignore basic club settings in order for the cheap phoned in jump scare to work.

So eventually they wind up on the tropical island for some stupid trivia thing with the worst hosts ever, for CREEP FACTOR we have to have the hotel staff be antisocial and intrusive, the maid for example ignores white virgin, ""oooooh, how creepy, she doesn't respond"" F*** you that's stupid. Then they meet the hotel owner who glares at them and basically makes them feel as unwelcome as possible, even though his business seems to be going into the crapper. Then they meet Jack Black playing himself, and the guy seems friendly enough, basically offering the guests some marijuana if they need some, then Tiesha is all like 'get away from me you smelly hippie', there goes what little amount of empathy I had for these characters.

So much more stupid crap happens without a shred of thought or time put into the production, even the kills are PG-13 caliber (well by today's standards) and we often cut back to Freddie Prince Jr. doing, something? I don't really know what he just has a bad feeling and runs around, apparently as fan service to the girls watching. Then we get more standard cookie-cutter unorignal scenes such as NO ONE BELIEVING WHITE VIRGIN GURRL, or Token black guy is the first of them to get offed and no one seems to care.

Then later we meed biker chick who runs the bar, and while virgin white gurrrl lives, random biker chick is killed off, because the white suburb kids watching need to know that that lifestyle is looked down upon and you'll likely get murdered if you live like that. Token black girl living was only a treat for virgin white girl because no one else really cared about her character.

So OH NO CREEPY AWKWARD WHITE DUDE TURNS OUT TO BE THE MURDERER, no f***ing s***, who didn't see that coming a mile away? Then he disappears throughout the second half of the movie and only pops in once in awhile to remind the audience ""hey I'm still here"", then finally shows that he's the bad guy to the last retard in the audience who couldn't tell and puts his EVIL FACE!!! on. This wimp is the least threating villain ever, and his dad comes up and f***s him in the ass or whatever, I stopped paying attention at this point, this movie SUCKS!

So many holes in this story it makes no sense. First of all if Karla is Julie's best friend and sees how much Julie likes Ray why is she trying to hook her up with someone else. She's not trying to help her alleged best friend and comfort her just go and sleep with someone else. Knowing that Julie is somewhat paranoid and Karla knew most of the story that Julie went through why is she sneaking around the apartment in the dark with no lights on in the house and if they go to the same school why would Karla think Julie was out of town, looks to me classes are still going on

To make this movie even more ridiculous, Karla the genius says Rio as the capital of Brazil and for those who know geography very well know right off the bat that this was a set up. Bill Cobbs' character knew that it was the wrong answer but yet didn't say anything to warn the four people that Rio was the wrong answer and help them try to go back home, waits until the last minute for the body count to pile up.

Ben Willis have so many opportunities to kill Julie when she's at the club, in the bathroom, in the tanning bed and don't do anything plus he could have killed Ray after he fell but didn't do anything there either. So this killer is a complete moron but the victims are even dumber when some of them were armed with weapons ( a knife, axe, baseball bat mind you) they completely forget they had these weapons and don't make it a possible 3 on 1 attack and just run. Don't even try to work together to kill this man. I guess if you have common sense horror movies won't exist.

Instead of making this movie almost exactly the same as the origional, as most horror-movie-makers seem to do, this movie has a totally different setting to the first - a holliday resort in the bahamas!

Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and her best friend and roommate Karla (Brandy) win a radio compition and win a holliday for four to the bahamas. Karla takes her boyfriend Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer) and Julie takes her new love interest Will (Matthew Settle). The arrive and check into their hotel (which I admitt, was a bit of an unrealistic point of the film as there are only five or six staff members and seemingly no other guests, however it is the ""off-season"").

Julie begins to relax, enjoying the luxury and relaxation of the hotel, but, unknown to Julie and her friends, the body count is rising and its not long before those awaited words ""I Still Know..."" appear and once again Julie must face the wrath of Ben Willis.

Just as good as the orgional, this movie is not one to miss. It is as scary as the orgional and a bit gorier too. This movie also features an appearance from Jack Black and Ray (Freddy Price Jr) is also back.

11714,1,0767826728,"Director:  Danny Cannon

Cast:  Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Brandy Norwood, Mekhi Phifer, Muse Watson, Bill Cobbs, Mathew Settle, Jeffrey Combs, Jennifer Esposito.

Running Time:  100 minutes

Rated R for intense terror violence and gore, strong language and some drug use.

It might not have been the greatest movie ever made but, thanks to the canny direction and score, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was a very effective thriller. Shame the same can't be said of this sequel, which crams in every slasher clich known to man with such little awareness of how hackneyed it all is that it actually seems to believe this is scary stuff.  In a fit of apparent desperation, writer Trey Callaway packs Julie (Hewitt), survivor of the first film, off to an island in the Bahamas when she wins a holiday thanks to a radio show calling her number. Joining her is fish-faced Karla (Brandy), her boyfriend Tyrell (Mekhi Pfeiffer, who I seem to remember used to have a promising career) and spare wheel Will (Matthew Settle). Joining them soon after that is the killer fisherman, who engineered the prize (the fact that Julie's number's unlisted doesn't set off any warning bells) and proceeds to slice his way from one end of the movie to the other. There are no boats scheduled for days, the phones don't work, and there's a storm on the way...you get the picture.

You can practically hear director Danny Cannon, whose last movie was the underrated ""Judge Dredd"" and who deserves a lot better than this, sighing behind the camera at just how witless all this is. Cannon does manage to captivate the beautiful island scenery and the excellently-captured eeriness of the hotel at which the quartet of teen protagonists are vacationing (it's also a sort of sad waste of overall possibilities when you reflect on how they utilized these potent settings); a couple good scares throughout, though nothing scary, as if any movie could be deemed such; Freddie Prinze, Jr. is certainly not a notable talent, yet he exudes sufficient charm and is a likable hero; Mekhi Phifer, in a stereotype black tough-guy role, gives his role some enjoyable attitude, but his disbelief of Julie's claims that a killer's on the loose become tiring and cruel. ""I Still Know..."" fails due to a maddening lack of logic, intelligence, and most plausible qualities of humanity in all the characters; entirely arbitrary and thus boring murders of all the islanders we don't even really know is an obvious compensatory ploy for the fact that only two of main five characters are killed; technically mediocre acting (except Hewitt), plus bothersome, forgettable work from newcomer Brandy; low-IQ script; splotches of incompetent directing throughout; an incredibly demeaning and character-betraying ""shocker"" finale that essentially tosses this film into the pile of identical slasher formula flicks from the past 20 years. Our only consolation is that it may just be a dream, a la the ""surprise"" ending of the first ""I Know What You Did Last Summer""...I guess we'll find out if and when ""I Still Know What You Did Lots of Summers Ago"" is made.",1135987200,3,3123,4.95602294455067

Unfortunately not - the formula has been squeezed just a little too much for any real shocks, but it does maintain a steady pace and is a pretty watchable and thankfully short movie.

Starring the cleavage-based talents of Jennifer Love Hewitt, this movie is essentially a vehicle allowing said actress as well as Brandy to wear the skimpiest clothes possible. From this angle, the movie does not disappoint. The producer Neal H. Moritz claims he wanted this movie to be scarier than the original; in my mind he failed by a long shot.

11718,2,0767826728,"2.5 Stars If Possible

A year after the success of I Know What You Did Last Summer, JLH and FPJ are back in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.  The first installment has the advantages of a better cast, more character development, a mysterious feeling, and originality, thus making it an all-around better movie.  I Still Know isn't all bad, but it doesn't live up to the previous effort, which itself wasn't anything amazing.

The cast isn't quite as good this time around.  It still has Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prince Jr. (as Julie James and Ray Bronson, respectively) but since Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe were killed off in the first film, the secondary couple is replaced by Brandy Norwood and Mekhi Phifer, as Julie's best friend Karla Wilson and her boyfriend Tyrell.  There is little character development here.  I guess the writers just assumed everyone saw the first one and could figure out what was going on.

I Still Know takes place one year after I Know and two years after the night where the four teens accidentally killed a man.  Julie and Karla win a trip for four to an island in the Bahamas.  Julie sees strange things hinting that the killer is there, but nobody else does so she can't convince then.

The killer stalks the teens and other random, innocent people along the way, including tough bartender Nancy (Jennifer Esposito) and bound-to-die stoner Titus Telesco (Jack Black).  Once dead bodies start popping up, people start to believe that there's a killer on the loose.

After everything is seemingly settled, there is a little surprise at the end.  It nicely sets up for yet another sequel.  Nothing has been announced, but rumors for a trilogy have been speculated.

I didn't like how the sense of mystery as to who the killer is was gone, since it was revealed in the previous film.  However, there were some twists and turns thrown in (one in particular comes to mind) that make the movie more exciting.

I Still Know What You Did Last Summer was not as successful as it's predecessor.  This is understandable because, not only is it a sequel, but it simply isn't as good.  I would only recommend seeing this if you saw the first one and enjoyed it enough to sit through a something similar.",1100908800,,2252,4.66751269035533

And she parades it and everything contained in that top about all over the film. All the guys are drooling in the audience. And all the girls, who are mere mortals, and do not have hair & makeup artists, great clothes off a rail which you don't have to pay for, and who are not blessed with such generous ... good looks :) are going green with envy!

OK, so that's my rant over. Considering this is a horror movie, and it's a sequel to a horror movie, you'd think there would be a third too right? Wrong! For some reason, the makers didn't follow the Scream route, and make a trilogy (or the following Scary Movie), but decided to go down the Urban Legend route, and only release two films. When we all know these horror movies are supposed to be trilogies! All great films are trilogies, come on! OK, maybe I'm going OTT. Actually, I should be reviewing the first one, but the disc of that, has sprouted legs, and gone walkabout. No doubt following Broken Arrow, and my necklace - hopefully not! Up to the DVD stealing/gone missing place in the sky! I still have the case, just not the disc. And I can't rewatch/review the film without the disc!

The great thing about this movie? To have all the characters filming in the pouring rain most of the time! (OK, except for Jennifer Love Hewitt, for the guys, you'll be concentrating mainly on the contents of her top to notice the rain) For some weird reason, I find water a cool effect in movies, whether it's pure rain, or the water itself. I'm weird. Love me!

Some people say there's too little of Freddie Prinz Jnr in this, and instead he gets replaced the hot'n'horny Mekhi Pfifer. Frankly, I couldn't care about either of them, nor do I care much for Brandy. She can't sing, and whoever thought she could act, should have been locked up in a looney (tunes) bin.

I like the movie, I just don't like the actors in it all that much. They're watchable that's about it. They're nothing special. For any guys reading this, this movie needs to be in your DVD collection. You'll get your kicks out of the contents of Jennifer Love Hewitt's top.

11727,1,0767826728,"I can understand why a sequel was made to ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" because of the ending of the original.  But I DON'T get why it had to be so stereotypical and poor.
The sequel follows Jennifer Love Hewitt's character Julie to college, where she still has flashbacks of that fateful summer where she was being chased by a hook-wielding killer.  Her roommate Karla, played with limited acting skills by singer Brandy, tries to take her mind off things and suggests that Julie dates someone new (Julie and Freddie Prinze Jr.'s character Ray are estranged at the film's start).  To their surprise, the girls win a trip for four to the Bahamas for answering a trivia question in a radio contest.  Julie invites new crush Will (Matthew Settle) and Karla takes along boyfriend Ty (Mekhi Pfeiffer).
Here's where the problems start.  First of all, the writers must think that the average viewer of this film has a third-grade education.  Intelligent audience members smell a rat early on in the film when the girls incorrectly answer that the capital of Brazil is Rio de Janeiro (it's actually Brasilia).  When the real answer is revealed at the climax of the movie, did the writers expect everyone to go ""Ohhhhh!!""?  I hope they don't think we are THAT stupid!
Another problem:  the geniuses behind this film were obviously trying to clinch the attention of the males in the theatre by having Jennifer Love Hewitt run around in white t-shirts drenched with rain.  As a heterosexual female, I got tired of seeing Ms. Hewitt bounce around and felt this move was cheap on behalf of the filmmakers.  Well, with a sub-par plot and mediocre acting, I guess they felt the need to do something.
One more pet peeve:  why must Hewitt sing at some point in every TV show or film she appears in?  I cringed at the contrived karaoke scene in this movie.  Don't you think it would been more obvious (and probably more enjoyable) to have already-established pop star Brandy sing a song?
Viewers sit through one cliche after another until the unsatisfying and predictable twist is revealed at the end.  And then the ending itself is another cliche, hinting once again at another installment.  Thank goodness it hasn't been made (yet).
Chalk this up as another unnecessary slasher flick specifically made to capitalize on the success of ""Scream.""  While ""Scream"" had a certain wit to it, this is plain silliness rolled up with blatant T & A.  Don't waste your time.",1065657600,7,2451,4.754137115839243

Another ""I Know What You Did"" film. The fisher man with the hook for a hand is back after Hewitt and her obnoxious friends which include returning Freddy Prinze, Brandy, and Mekhi Pfefier as the token black guy.
A year after the first incident, Julie (Hewitt) and company have won a trip to a tropical resort.

A predictably gory onslaught ensues to the backdrop of an incoming storm that is making life even more difficult for these poor kids.
Hewitt is the highlight of this film- but not for her acting chops. Her beautiful cleavage and knack for wearing soaking-wet white T-shirts is really the only redeeming value in this very dumb sequel. Jack Black as a goofy white wannabe Jamiacan is too annoying for words. Freddy Prinze is as terrible as always in his portrayal of goofy guy-next-door Ray. Love gets to do her thing here as she not only sings karaoke but gets to explain to co-star Pfeifer why ""her people can't dance"". Even tremendous character actor, Bill Cobbs, is wasted in this awful sequel. It's over-acting galore as Hewitt and Brandy trade screams and arguments back and forth in the rain.

Not long after Carla wins a trip to the Bahamas from a local radio station, bringing along Julie and Tyrell, Ray comes face to face with Ben Willis, who he thought was killed the year before. Carla and the gang head off, as planned, when disaster hits: A big rainstorm. Bummer. Not able to get off the island, due to the mysterious dissappearence of the boats and dockman, dead bodies start piling up all over the place, from a slit throated maid to an open chested druggie.

They soon realize (or at least Julie) that Ben is back in black, and armed with his famous giant fishing hook. after nearly everyone on the island has been sliced and diced, the film finally starts getting good with pleanty of suspenseful chase scenes to keep you watching.

2. Leading Gal/ Natural Beauty: JENNIFER LOVE!
3. Good plot
4. Sarah Michelle Gellar DIES in the first one!*
  O.K.- Here's the scoop on I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. Remember Ben Willis? He's the fisherman Ray, Julie, Barry, and Helen murdered on the road that July 4th two years ago... supposedly. After last summer... the summer Julie came back to South Port...the summer Barry and Helen were murdered...the summer Julie and Ray defeated Ben Willis...
it's all just a memory now, right? A very, very horrible memory... WRONG!
Now, one year later, Julie is still haunted by the infamous fisherman... in her dreams and in her thoughts. Although she has friends to comfort her- her roommie and BF, Carla, her boyfriend, Ray, and guy friend Will- she still feels unsecure. But when Carla wins a radio contest for four to go to the Bahamas for the 4th of July weekend, Julie brightens up and asks Ray to come. But Ray resists the invatation, and Julie is crushed. So Carla invites Will to come instead, along with her boy friend, Ty. But when the breif fun turns to confusion as the four winners find that there are limited employees on the island as the result of ""storm season"", the troubles begin... as well as the deaths...
-So, all in all, if you liked the first one you'll LOVE this! There are enough of the unexpected twists you'd expect. I like the way everything turns out in the end, in my opinion, Julie and Ray's relationship should be the way it is today- except the part about the killer in a slicker trying to kill them!

11743,4,0767826728,"""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" (1998)
 ... This movie is cheesy, unrealistic and downright silly, but I loved the first movie, and Jennifer Love Hewitt is irresistible. I know I usually have a different word to everyone else on these types of movies, but if I enjoy myself, that is how I base my rating. This movie is my one of my best guilty pleasures, and I don't care what everyone else thinks, I enjoy watching it and that's me.
 Now ... why do I like this movie? There are many reasons. For starters, it's got everything a fun teen slasher requires. Lots of big breasts, reasonably good acting, truckloads of gore, unpredictable twists and turns, some big laughs, a scary killer and a brilliant setting. To add to that, the movie never stops with the scares, is never boring and had something that I really appreciated. In some teen slashers (Urban Legends: Final Cut especially) the main characters really don't really seem to care after their friends/people have been killed. In I Still Know What You Did Last Summer; Julie James is a very respectable character. She stills mourns for those she has lost and those she may lose. I was actually shocked with the amount of emotion the movie put on when showing Julie's new life and what she goes through.
The acting in the film is satisfactory for a horror film. Jennifer Love Hewitt returns as Julie James and once again she proves she's not just about looks, this girl can act. I want to see her give a performance that can give that idea more justice, not just horror movies please! Still she is good as Julie. Freddie Prinze, Jr. also returns and he has improved his acting skills. He puts on a solid performance. Brandy is very eager in the material and her performance worked for me. Mekhi Phifer had me rolling in the aisles with his fun performance as Brandy's horny boyfriend. I also enjoyed the underused Jennifer Esposito as the bartender on the island, and Jeffrey Combs' breakaway as the ruthless hotel owner. Muse Watson is scary and evil again, his facials are fantastic, but every time the guy talks I cringe. I just can't take his lines that seriously. Bill Cobbs is merely okay as the weird guy on the island who is suspected as the killer.
Danny Cannon's direction of the movie deserves recognition. The guy makes sure the movie looks great and brings tonnes of atmosphere to the movie. The killing scenes are done to perfection. I was glad he didn't just take the point-and-shoot routine that many horror movies use these days. Cannon put effort into his surroundings. Unfortunately the film editing is pretty atrocious. The characters' mouths move a lot when they're not saying anything, and injuries are cleared up very easily, like in one shot the person is hit hard with something, and then in the next shot they're running like hell and not even a bruise. Think about the editing techniques next time, Dan.
Trey Callaway's script is not perfect. While he does mix in freaky-as-hell horror with funny-as-hell comedy quite well with some great in-jokes and an excellent setting for a horror film, there is not much depth or range in the film. He does make sure all the possibilities are used for the killing scenes and horror action, but if Kevin Williamson had written this sequel, I feel it would've been a little more plausible. If you've seen the end of I Know What You Did Last Summer you'll know what I'm talking about, Ben Willis just couldn't of survived.
Bad editing, some silly dialogue, unanswered questions and cheesy lines do stop the movie from being great. There is also not enough depth to the film and damn, what was the final scene all about? But, excuse that and you've got what is my favourite guilty pleasure at the moment, and a fun slice of harmless horror.

11744,1,0767826728,"I Still Know...is as absurd as they come. Four teens, who are sharing a brain, win a trip to the Bahamas. They arrive to learn that they have arrived at the end of season, which is the 4th of July. Forget the fact that they don't celebrate the 4th of July there. This is a neat way of reducing the cast size. Later, there is a supposed hurricane, but the production company wouldn't put out for more than one rain machine, so it's pretty dinky. It does make a fine mess of Hewitt's hairdo, which was bad before it got wet.
The fisherman they thought they killed in the first movie is back, and boy! is he upset! The kids waste a lot of time chasing the wrong killer. One of the hotel employees practices voodoo, so he's got to be it, right? No, this is the Caribbean, not Omaha.
I lost track of the body count because the person I watched this one with couldn't keep a straight face. When I said I was doing my job, they really fell apart.
This is that new breed of movie in which no one knows how to write the music. Here, there is scary music every time someone turns their back to the camera. HD20 had the same problem.

It's a follow-up to the pretty good 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' but the first movie already killed off the only two members of the cast that could act.  The title is also all wrong - shouldn't it be the summer before last?
The story involves Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and her new best friend (Brandy) win a trip to the Caribbean.  So off they hop to a conveniently remote island with Brandy's boyfriend and a random guy that they don't know.  The fact that's it's storm season leads to a lot of obvious plots involving people not being heard over the wind and a lot of thunder that is probably supposed to rack up tension.  There is absolutely nothing tense about this movie.  The usual round of killings ensue with a man stalking through the hotel, which is inexplicably almost empty save for a few signposted red herrings.
Whilst the first movie had a tongue-in-cheek yet still fairly creepy script by Kevin Williamson of 'Scream' fame, this has no hallmarks whatsoever.  Apart from Brandy, who manages to ground the rest of the cast, the acting is dismal.  It says it all when the audience looks forward to the arrival of Freddy Prinze Junior.

11747,3,0767826728,"(NOTE: Partial spoilers of earlier movie)
I'll rank this a three on a 1-5 scale I've devised particularly for use in rating sequels for which I liked the original. The scale would work as follows: 1: So bad I'd now just as soon have not liked the original. 2: My liking for original is intact, but sequel adds virtually nothing to my enjoyment. 3: Sequel enjoyable mainly on the strength of how original made me care for the characters and their continuing story, not a great movie in its own right. 4: Sequel satisfying, coming close to or rivaling the original in quality. 5: Exceptional sequel, surpassing the original in quality. So, in the case of this movie, the sequel leaves considerable room for disappointment but maintained my interest because the first made the characters interesting. Even at that, Jennifer Love Hewitt came much closer to having to carry the movie this time, because Freddy Prinze, Jr. was reduced to cameo-level appearance this time, and most of the rest of major players in the original played characters that didn't survive that movie. Particularly missed in the sequel for the latter reason were Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and especially the undercast Brigette Wilson. Other things that detracted from this sequel are that the screenplay, editing, and/or direction seemed amateurish at times. The main Character Julie (played by Hewitt) sings ""I Will Survive"" as a karaoke song, a scene better omitted. I can't speak for viewers unfamiliar with karaoke, though I suspect they might have limited appreciation for its inclusion in movies. But those of us who are karaoke singers and/or listeners know that ""I Will Survive"" is one of the most run-into-the-ground of karaoke songs and we're sick of it. Also her scene where she gets into the sunlamp box is also awkward and probable not too pleasing to anyone. Those not liking scantily-clad scenes will find it ""exploitative"", but those who do will find it tame and unrevealing. Other awkward moments would become ponderous to enumerate. Julie's new boyfriend in the movie, who accompanies her to the Bahamas (the reason for Prinze's sparse appearence in this) is played in an awkward way, and his character's transitions along plot twists are lame and not highly believable. As for the scenes set in the Bahamas, they were actually filmed in Mexico and it shows. They show good-sized mountains, non-existent in the Bahamas. But in that department, this sequel in no way outdoes the original in impertinance, for the original had some mountain scenes too, even though ostensibly set in and around Southport, NC, an area where all land within view is at least as flat as the Bahamas. The most memorable new character in this sequel, though even he has been called ineffective and/or miscast, is a resident pothead in the Bahamas, played by Jack Black. His character has some mildly funny moments, though they missed a chance to give him what could have been the movie's funniest line. In the movie, most every character at one time or another falls under suspicion of being the killer on the lose; when it came the pothead's turn to be suspected, he should have said, ""Don't look at me - I don't even know what I did last summer!"" The end of the movie seems a possible set up for still another sequel. If one is made, I hope it can come closer to recapturing the quality of the original rather than languishing at the level of this first sequel.",1013644800,,3438,4.858603066439523

11749,5,0767826728,"This, i guess, is the exception that proves the rule. Almost all sequels are worse (not always bad, just a bit less enjoyable) than the originals films which spawned them.
This film has everything the original had (including... Jennifer Love Hewitt!!!) and even more. There are more killings, more plot facets (they add in the trip to the Bahamas, Nancy, who is a rather good character, the deal with the voodoo, the storm, and lots of other stuff.) Most sequels are just re-hashings of the first film, just with more blood. But instead, this film had plot as well, and wasn't just pointless killing.
Estas (im not really sure of his name, but it sounded a bit like that i think) is a great character, and although his part is small he really does give lots to the film. As too does the hotel manager, who was at times hilarious, and at others creepy.
There was a nice twist in the end, which made up nicely for the fact taht we already knew the identity of the killer.
The acting was okay, especially Jennifer Love Hewitt. Even Brandy, who i had low expectations of, managed to surprise.
I can't think of many real criticisms of this film, apart from perhaps the slightly corny dialogue at times, and Ben Willis's voice, which really managed to get on my nerves. Otherwise, all aspects of this film were great. there was some nice scenery, good acting, a really superb plot, and lots of nice shots of JLH's clevage (which was shown so much it could probably come under scenery!) some great eccentric characters and a cracking ending. (I am not talking about the very very end, that was a bit disappointing)
those who are aware of their geography may well get a clue near the beginning. I myself did, but i (foolishly) just put it down to a rather stupid radio station.
And now, the infamous ""ending"". Can it really be called an ending, or is it just the beginning of the next chapter? (or even the end of one) Personally, i didn't really like it, but only if there isn't another film. If there is another film, the it fits.
I would greatly like to see a third volume, especially if the directors are able to come up with such a good sequel as this again.

11750,4,0767826728,"I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER

(USA/Germany - 1998)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtrack: SDDS / Dolby Stereo SR

Given the enormous commercial success of sleeper hit I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (1997), a sequel was inevitable. Five more beautiful teenagers, including two survivors of the previous movie (Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr.) are hunted through a deserted, storm-lashed holiday island in the Bahamas by a hook-handed serial killer in Danny Cannon's lavishly mounted and hugely entertaining potboiler. It doesn't have the strong narrative drive of its predecessor and it tends to ramble aimlessly from set-piece to set-piece, while Trey Callaway's superficial script relies too heavily on implausible coincidences (like the tropical storm which gives the killer a helping hand by rolling into the island almost as soon as our heroes arrive, isolating them from the mainland!), but once the main scenario has been established and the killer has claimed his/her first victim, the thrills come thick and fast, with one genuinely scarifying climax after the other.

Gloriously staged and photographed (in widescreen Panavision, by Vernon Layton), the movie benefits from glorious location work - exteriors were filmed at the El Tecuan Marina Resort in Mexico - and the shameless deployment of a VERY LOUD soundtrack, while the actors do their best within the limits of their shallow characterizations. Look out for the superb Jeffrey Combs and Bill Cobbs in crucial supporting roles.

Director Cannon - who made a spectacular feature debut with the underrated British crime thriller THE YOUNG AMERICANS (1993) before crashing to an abrupt halt with the poorly-scripted JUDGE DREDD (1995) - begins to turn the screws very early in the film, adding a slightly unpleasant streak of cruelty to some of the murder scenes, and John Frizzell's shrieking music score sets the nerves jangling throughout. Some of the climactic revelations stretch credibility to the limit, but the film employs an eccentric, comic-strip logic which works on its own terms, and subsequent viewing reveals a multitude of clues surrounding certain characters and incidents which are cleverly designed to elude first-time audiences. So, if it's a genuine nerve-shredder you're after, this great big lunk of a movie is just the ticket.

By the way, there's absolutely no truth in the scurrilous rumor that the third film in this series will be entitled ""I've Got A Fair Idea What You Were Doing Last Tuesday And If You Don''t Stop It You'll Go Blind""...

NB. In fact, the third film was released direct to DVD under the title I'LL ALWAYS KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (2006).",1002672000,,2696,5.1981566820276495

Jennifer Love Hewitt is okay in this, but the appeal she had in the first isn't quite here in this one. She seems to be there just to have really hot shots of her body which, um, well, okay, that wasn't a bad thing. Brandy, on the other hand, was wasted. Why was she in this?. Why did she agree to do this?. Freddie Prinze Jr. was another one who was wasted. He got second billing but his part is much smaller than any of the other co-stars. What happened?. The fishermen killer himself was creepy in the first one. Not here. His creepiness was ruined because you see way too much of him in this film. That always hurts a film and character.

Score: 67/100
As much as I really wanted to dislike I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, I, unfortunately, couldn't. This film has very bad reviews and didn't do excellently at the box office, but it isn't, surprisingly, as bad as it is supposed to be. It's not the teen-kill movie for everyone, but it held my interest, and is a pretty solid modern horror movie.
Two years after the horrible incident, Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is back in college and is worse than ever having dreams about Ben Willis, the man who killed all her friends a couple of years ago. She gets comfort from a new friend named Will (Matthew Settle). Julie's other friend Karla (Brandy) tries to hook the two of them up and when she wins a trip to the Bahamas, she knows that it is perfect. But Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.) is still in the picture and Julie only goes as friends. Karla, her boyfriend Tyrell, Julie, and Will take flight right before Ray encounters the fisherman again. He tries to tell Julie not to leave but it is too late. Now in the Bahamas Julie is starting to lighten up and have fun. Then suddenly things start going terribly wrong when a storm hits the Island and people start to disappear. Ray takes a boat to the Island to warn Julie but will he make it on time to save Julie again from the fisherman?
It's all predictable and quite dumb, but if you don't look for a dazzlingly original story and a pitch-perfect script then I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is great fun. Jennifer Love Hewitt is a nice heroine, she is continuously good to look at, and the set decoration is nice, although I found it odd that it was set on a Bahamian island and was shot in Mexico. Still, there is heaps of eye candy in many scenes and there are no breaks from the gore, which is great for teenagers, although the film was a tad too graphic for my liking. The only absolutely major quibble was the editing. Half the time it looked like the actors mimed the words and then put them onto a speaker phone after the shooting, and it looked terribly messy and was a largely irritating flaw. But, don't worry about that too much, just sit back and let this film do what it was made to do - entertain.
I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is far, far away from perfect, but both as a silly slasher flick and a stupidly entertaining brew, it works quite admirably.",985392000,,2391,4.327394209354121
11760,1,0767826728,"""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,"" if nothing else, should at least get an Academy Award for Longest Movie Title of 1998. In fact, the title could be a testament to the movie itself: unnecessarily long, cheesy, and a big letdown as a sequel to a movie that is only slightly better. The plot is pure contrivance for the conveniance of putting its characters in unspeakably tedious situations, the acting and characters are equally uninvolving, and the overall message gleaned from this film is one that portrays it as a pointless excuse for bloodletting and gore.
The movie picks up where the predecessor left off, with a silly dream sequence that seems to belong in a comedy spoof of these films instead of here. Julie apparently has been haunted by these dreams for many months since her last encounter with the killer from the first film, Ben Willis, who fell off the boat in the end of the movie and was never seen again. Until now, but more happens before then. Julie's best friend, Carla, wins a trip to the Bahamas by answering incorrectly to the question requiring the capital of Brazil. Of course, given the mentality of this film, I wouldn't expect too many people to know the right answer, and I guess the filmmakers were counting on that, too.
Anyway, Julie calls up long-lost Ray, asking him to go to the Bahamas with her, Carla, and Carla's boyfriend Ty. Ray refuses her, but then decides to surprise her. Of course, on his way to meet Julie at the airport, he is set upon by Ben Willis, and ends up in the hospital, from which he escapes and spends the rest of the movie trying to reach the resort. That resort is Tower Bay, where the group, along with newcomer Will Benson, who has it bad for Julie, finds out that the resort is left entirely to them due to the incoming of heavily inclimate weather. ""This is our version of winter,"" says the hotel clerk. So pretty soon, the rain is falling, and so are the bodies, moreso than the first movie, and much more gratuitously.
The movie really has nowhere to go but down from here, relying heavily on gore, blood, and useless plot twists to create what they hope will be a sense of tension and suspense. No such luck. Yes, we do spend some time wondering who is going to meet the fishhooked Ben Willis next, but since we never get the chance to know the characters, we never can care for them once they are killed, sauteed, gutted, and what-have-you. There is never a moment in this movie where you'll find yourself saying, ""This is such a good film,"" because there's never any reason to. What makes it even worse is that the movie makes itself out so that it is not necessary to see the first in order to get the second. It spends so much time dwelling on the past that its concern for its own events are missed by a longshot.
Nothing but contrivance for this film as well, bringing us the same, tired situations that its characters dwell in, going over the same old routine until we feel like we've seen every horror movie known to man. Ben Willis was supposedly killed in the ending of the first, and even if he's alive, he missing a hand. Not a problem. Slap a new hook on him in place of the severed hand, one that's permantently attached, so he can kill quicker and easier. Now the characters need to be placed in the most vulnerable of positions at key points in the movie. All taken care of; just send them to a secluded island paradise that is about to experience a major weather crisis. Need a couple of simple characters for extra bloodletting. Hotel management: 'nuff said. Are you seeing a pattern here?
And what is with the secondary characters of the movie, anyway? One of them is the waitress in the hotel bar, who always seems to be giving us hints that she may have something to do with the killings going on, but trust me, thinking that way leads nowhere. And what about that pot dealing freak with the dread locks? This is as hokey a character as you can get, and never have I seen such a waste of plot on such a stupid character (though I kept wishing he'd hand me a joint to get me through the rest of the movie). The character of Will is a wuss, enough said, and even when it comes time for his major involvement in the plot, it turns out to be one of the cheesiest and most contrived aspects of the story.
I had a hard time trying to decide as to whether or not this is one of those bad movies that happens to good actors, or if they should be held responsible for getting into it. Hewitt and Prinze, Jr, who reprise the roles of the earlier film, should have known better when they read the script that this material would not be sufficient enough to live up to the standards, however low, set by the first film. Brandy Norwood and Mekhi Phifer are the newcomers in the places of Phillipe and Gellar, and Phifer is the most amusing as the oversexed boyfriend who turns sexual frustration into comedic relief; Brandy is okay on TV, but I think in this case, a bad movie happened to her as an actress.
In watching this movie, I kept thinking to myself, ""People are actually going to like this."" Then I found myself thinking of the demographic group who would gobble this stuff up and actually enjoy it. This is going to appeal mostly to young teens who want to be more like the older set of teenagers who have seen movies like this, one of those ""in-crowd"" movies that makes you look popular. To those who fit into this group, you're in for a sorely rude awakening.",985219200,,5455,4.401980198019802

It's such  a cop out.  It's like they're telling you, the third in the series is  coming out.  Unfortunately, this particular series should probably stop.  I  liked the first movie a lot; it was suspenseful, imaginative, and pretty  scary.  The acting was generally better too.  This time around, the acting  and script are pretty irritating.  First of all, anyone who knows their  geography will get a big clue early in the film.  Secondly, Freddie  Prinze's character is such a jerk in the beginning, you can't believe his  sudden transformation.  Third, I figured out the villain very early in the  film, so there was little suspense.  The acting overall is lame; Jennifer  Love Hewitt has decided to join Neve Campbell in the ""I'm only doing  this for the money, and I'm really wasting my time in this silly horror  movie.""  She does look a lot like Kate Jackson in this one, though.  Freddie Prinze is absolutely awful, completely unconvincing, and a pretty  shoddy hero, to boot.  The guy who plays Titus is an offensive,  stereotypical insult to intelligent viewers, providing none of the comic  relief the director obviously wanted.  Jeffrey Combs, who was so good in  the ""Reanimator"" movies looks as bored as Miss Hewitt, and does  nothing to pad his resume.  Three actors do manage to rise above their  material:  Jennifer Esposito as Nancy, the barmaid is very good; Brandy is  surprisingly effective as Julie's best friend, although her character does  become annoying and stupid; and Matthew Settle as the good-natured Bill is  very effective.  I still think Gorton's should sue for using their  fisherman image, but it is a horror movie.  That's what so sad.

It's overflowing with cliches (the obligatory scene in a sequel where the  survivor of the first film talks about the strange dreams she's having --  and whoa! She's in a dream!  What a surprise!).
So, I ask again, why am I  reviewing this dreadful film, which is not redeemed by numerous shots of  Jennifer Love Hewitt's ample bosom (I don't have to buy or rent this video  to see that; I can turn on the TV)?
Because it has a pretty cool twist  at the end.  No, it does not measure up to the twist of a great film like  ""The Sixth Sense"", but it does allow me to give this film two  stars rather than one.
But enough with the slasher films, Jennifer.  Your  former co-star, Neve Campbell, had better luck with ""Scream"" and  its sequel simply because the screenwriting was better.

7788896,3,0767826728,"***SPOILERS BELOW***

I want to start by saying I really like this movie. When I look back at horror movies from the 90's the only two series that immediately come to mind are Scream, and this one. A 3 star rating really doesn't do it justice, because it did a lot of things right. A lot of times in horror movie sequels the main characters tend to forget about friends they've lost, and you don't have to look far for examples of this. In this one though Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) actually takes a moment early in the film to look at a picture of her fallen best friend Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who died in the first movie. That scored a lot of points with me, and it only took a few seconds to accomplish, but they didn't stop there. Later in the movie Julie references both Helen and Barry by name when she tells her new friends that Ben Willis killed them one year ago. I wish other horror franchises were so conscientious when it came to the little things like that. My main gripe with the movie though, and the one almost solely responsible for my 3 star rating is Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.). Yes, the movie gets major points for bringing back the two surviving characters from the first, but it seems to me that Ray failed to learn anything from the events of the first movie. He wants Jule to come back to Southport with him for the 4th, and then gets very upset when she tries to explain to him why she doesn't want to go. Southport is where 2 of their friends were brutally murdered by a psychotic fisherman 1 year ago. Julie and Ray were lucky to escape with their lives, and now he wants her to go back, and do the whole 4th of July Croaker Pageant thing again? Is he mentally challenged or something? What would ever lead him to believe that Julie would even want to go back there? And, on the anniversary of the murders no less? What makes this even worse is that they don't even know for sure that Ben Willis died. They never found his body. He lost his hand at the end of the first movie, but that's a completely survivable injury. So for all they know he's still out there, waiting to make his next move. Also we learned from the first movie that Ben Willis has a thing for anniversary's. He killed David Egen one year after the car wreck that claimed his daughters life, and came after them one year after they ran him over and left him for dead. It's not that I can't partially understand where Ray is coming from though. He lives in Southport, and during this whole last year nothing has happened, but that doesn't excuse his behavior towards Julie. She clearly relates the events of the first movie with Southport, and the 4th of July holiday, and understandably so. Yet instead of trying to understand her point of view (which it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out), he storms off. Then when Julie's nice enough to call, and invite him to go to the Bahamas with her he freaks out, accusing her of wanting to spend time with her friends instead of him. I just wanted to scream at how idiotic he was being. The Bahamas isn't Southport Ray! It's not the sight of unspeakable horrors for her (not yet anyway)! If it wasn't the anniversary, I might could understand Ray's frustration, but it is, and that makes him seem like the most insensitive, uncaring jerk on the planet. I know that things needed to play out this way to separate them, and set the stage for the events to follow, but I feel like it could have been done in a way that didn't make Ray seem like a complete jerk. I also have a slight problem with the ending. The last we see of Karla before the final showdown is when she watches Ben Willis kill the bartender Nancy. She then falls down, and we see Ben Willis seemingly go in for the kill. The movie then cuts to Julie and Will in the woods right before they meet up with Willis (I gotta hand it to him, the guy is fast). So we're left wondering how Karla managed to escape from him. Some may see this as nitpicking, but I don't like things that don't make sense. Sure this isn't the first time that Willis has seemingly had a would be victim right where he wanted them, and then left without finishing the job. Barry in the first movie, and Ray in the second are clear examples of this. The only point I can make to support my argument is that neither of those took place in the midst of the climax. This one does. I guess you're meant to believe that Willis finished her off, so that her return at the end is all the more touching, but it just doesn't make sense. Willis has been picking them off one by one by that point, and Karla is on her back defenseless. There's no logical reasoning for why Willis wouldn't just go ahead and kill her too. None. At the end of the day, it's a good follow up to it's predecessor. It's not perfect, but sequels rarely are, and it's not like the first was a flawless movie. It had problems too.",1478217600,,4894,4.296536796536796
