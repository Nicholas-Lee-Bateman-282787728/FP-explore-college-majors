8240265,1,B00113PUT6,"I think I may have enjoyed all of the living landscapes DVD's.  They were in HD DVD mode and I could not find a player that would play them.  I was told they no longer make them (players or this format), blue-ray beat them out I guess.  They did not play on blue-ray, my regular DVD player or my computer.  If they ever become available in these formats (not HD DVD) I would want to see them.",1219536000,6,392,4.0519480519480515
