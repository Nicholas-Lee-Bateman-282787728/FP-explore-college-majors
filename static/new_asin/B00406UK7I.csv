8412175,4,B00406UK7I,"This is a great Blu-ray football movie filled with extreme slo-motion and an abundance of NFL knowledge. This movie is not what you'd expect. Believe it or not, there is a lot of math in this movie and it replays a lot of the same NFL footage over and over. Not for the occasional football fan.",1418342400,,294,4.267857142857143
8412176,5,B00406UK7I,If you love football like I do you gotta watch this DvD a must have for all NFL fans for young an old!!!,1396224000,,104,3.5652173913043477
8412177,5,B00406UK7I,"The NFL looks very sharp on Blu-ray Disc.  And this is  one of them.  Full of a strong, clean, 1080p picture, this Blu-ray Disc helps to bring the action on home!!!!!  Now, if only NFL Films would release more of their content on Blu-ray Disc besides the Super Bowl Championship productions, then there would be a whole lot more to like!!!!  Sadly, their very well-done A Football Life has been only released on DVD.  And anything else non-Super Bowl since this Blu-ray Disc release has only been on DVD.  Oh, well.  At lease we have Ultimate NFL here to celebrate and enjoy.  And until the Seattle Seahawks SB XXXXVIII Champions Blu-ray Disc is released this coming Spring, with the Road to XXXXVIII to follow later this year, this will complete my NFL Films Blu-ray Disc collection for now.",1392681600,,792,4.681159420289855

8412179,3,B00406UK7I,"Good picutre quality,  But the only purpose of this film is to show off the high definition motion, not a complete story line.",1354492800,2,126,4.478260869565218
8412180,4,B00406UK7I,"This is a really nice and detailed introduction to Americal Football by NFL.
This blu-ray contains amazing high resolution footage and I was stunned watching the Phantom slow-motion camera at work.
This is a ""must see"" for anyone the least interested in the sport or just wanting some good quality blu-ray action for your new television set! :)",1331856000,,344,4.948275862068965
8412181,5,B00406UK7I,"I  Really enjoyed Ulitmate NFL, it was good to see something about the NFL and not the lock out and possiblily not having a season to watch",1304380800,,139,4.148148148148148
8412182,1,B00406UK7I,"I first saw the trailer for this and it was amazing. I couldn't wait to get it.
But when i did, it was not what i expected. Not all of the moments they showed were actually featured.
Like the Titans finish, Favre's pass, or the motivational speeches. It mostly shows Reggie Bush, Matthew Stafford, and the Packers- Cardinals game. That's not what i expected. It also wasn't that theatrical. The trailer is very deceiving.
In my opinion don't bother.",1296864000,7,449,4.69620253164557
8412183,4,B00406UK7I,"Anxiously waited for this to come out.. If you're a football fan, and enjoy shows like ""Time Warp"" on Discovery, then you'll love this great little documentary. Does a nice job of documenting the 2009 season with awesome cinematography utilizing new 1000fps cameras.

Also contains an awesome bonus documentary on NFL Films' production house. Great for film nerds like myself.

Excellent value, if you're into this sort of thing. Also great if you're looking for some nice reference material to show off your HDTV.",1292371200,2,514,5.107142857142857
