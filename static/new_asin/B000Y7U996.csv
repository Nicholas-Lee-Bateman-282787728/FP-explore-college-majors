3012079,2,B000Y7U996,"I bought this movie for two reasons: 1) I've always wanted to see Dragonlance visually and 2) I wanted to see how crappy it was. I've read the War of the Lance trilogy several times and when I saw that a film was being released, I admit, I was looking forward to it. Dragonlace the movie is like watching a train wreck in slow motion. It's one of those films where it's really bad, but you can't stop watching it because you're curious to see how worse it can get. The dragons and the draconians are computer animated but done sloppily (think of CG back in the early to mid nineties. Remember how choppy and cartooney it looked?), the voice acting is sub par. Raistlin, Tas, and Flint are pretty good but the voice acting of the others sound bored (don't get me started on the Forestmaster). To those who've read the book, there is no Tower of the Sun and Qualinesti looks like a backwater treetown with the most ugliest elves I've ever seen. The three notable dragons, Khisanth, Pryos, and Matafleur, all get renamed by obscure refernces to other books (Khisanth is called Onyx and poor Matafleur isn't even named as the Companions shamelessly use her madness against her). To further lay emphasis on the crappiness of this film, those who've read the book, at the end you see Laurana and Elistan making out and Tanis (Laurana's long time lover) takes it pretty lightly. Even if you hadn't read the book, seeing a sixty year old man making out with a hot young elf is disturbing nonetheless. All in all, it's one of those cartoon movies that kids and young teens would enjoy but as an adult, you'd laugh and marvel at its absurdity.",1200182400,,1633,4.52027027027027
3012080,3,B000Y7U996,"Well lets start with this.  I am a huge dragonlance fan and like many others have dreamed for a dragonlance movie most of my life.  While I can't exactly say I enjoyed this movie just because of how much I loved the books I would buy the sequals and such.  I have two major beefs with the movie.  First of all and it may just be me but there is way too much music that is way to loud.  I had a hard time hearing most of the characters especially the soft spoken raist when the music was blaring in the background during the WHOLE movie.  You don't have to have music during the whole movie.  Another is how they but the draconians and dragons.  It was just terrible to see the two types of imaging I don't know what they were thinking with this they really should of just stuck with one type.  Watching it made it seem cheezy like the draconians were just overlayed into the movie and were very out of place. The money used to animate them in that way could of been used for something else and would of also made the movie way better if they would of just kept it all 2-D that way it could all flow as one.  I was pretty happy with the story line they did cut out a couple of things I wished they wouldn't of but I understand they couldn't show the whole book in the movie.  In conclusion the story line was great because it came from a great book but the animation mixture could of used a lot of work and the music could be toned down a notch.  I will buy the sequals, if any do come out, but I hope the directors get a hint and fix some things.",1199145600,,1546,4.016339869281046
3012081,4,B000Y7U996,"Dragonlance is a journey ... and was from the beginning.

Dragons of Autumn Twilight was and remains a first in so many ways: it was the first novel together for Margaret and me, it was the first attempt at doing a classic fantasy story for a game setting, and the first book publication for TSR. Looking back on it now, after twenty years of polishing our writing, that first book looks rough and imperfect ... but it was the first step down a road that lead us to great wonders. Flawed as it appears now ... it is deservedly beloved.

Since before the publication of Dragons of Autumn Twilight, we have seen Dragonlance in cinematic terms. We wrote the books visualizing them as movies and dreamed that one day, our visions would be realized on film.
Now, thanks to Paramount Pictures and Epic Entertainment, that dream has been realized and with it, we take our first step down the new road of Dragonlance films.

Recently, Paramount sent to Margaret and me a copy of the film on DVD so that we could preview the final cut. It is quite a thrill watching our characters come to life and hearing the familiar story begin anew. Michael Rosenbaum and Fred Tataciore bring life to the opening scene on their way to meet their friends in Solace. The voice casting in this film is phenomenal. Lucy Lawless gives Goldmoon wonderful depth and even newcomer Caroline Gelbert brings a freshness to Laurana that is breathtaking. The heart of Dragonlance has always been its characters, and the movie shines especially in two of the stories most intriguing personalities, Tasslehoff and Raistlin ... each brought vividly alive by the incredible talents of Jason Marsden and Keiffer Sutherland.

Before our family started our little preview, I presented our audience with a little challenge: to find all the scenes where I can be found in the movie - kind of a personal `Where's Waldo'.

As for finding me in the film ... well, you'll just have to see for yourself.

Does this film have flaws -- absolutely. While the soundtrack is Oscar-worthy and the voice talent is unquestionably perfect, and Will Mineou's direction and art are beautiful, the animation itself is less than I would have hoped it to be. The style is unfortunately inconsistent from shot to shot. Interestingly, the mix of CGI with traditional cell animation worked quite well ... but it was the graphic inconsistencies between cell animation segments that I found problematic. Several sequences used post animation effects over still-motion in lieu of honest animation. My son, Curtis, is a professional After Effects artist as well as a professional magician. As he pointed out, there are only so many times in a piece you can use the same expedient short-cut before the audience begins to see the trick being played.  The movie has a major picture sound to which the visuals struggle to keep up.

Dragonlance fans will probably also be shocked to hear my second criticism: I believe including the entire first book in the movie was a mistake. Both the screenwriter and I argued against putting all of Dragons of Autumn Twilight in the first film ... believing that the film should portray essentially the first half of the book and finish with `Solace is burning.' But the `powers that be' adamantly required that the entire book be portrayed. George Strayton did a masterful job of accomplishing that goal and his script is undeniably brilliant - but I still believe the film's structure suffers from the enforced requirement of including the entire novel.

That being said, I am delighted with Dragons of Autumn Twilight and find myself liking it even more with each subsequent viewing. It is the first dragonlance movie and, as such, shares the heritage of tentative first steps ... but in those steps opens up a new road of films before us. `Lord of the Rings' was, after all, first a Ralph Bakshi cartoon.

Dragons of Autumn Twilight is not a destination ... it is the opening of a door and the beginning of a journey. Pop the popcorn, grab your hoopak and come with us down a new road with old friends.",1196640000,234,4069,4.767045454545454
3012082,4,B000Y7U996,"Dragonlance: Dragons of Autumn Twilight was the first ""real"" book that I ever read cover to cover (multiple times and continue to do so!) that I actually enjoyed.  Raist has always been my favorite character and kinda reminds me of myself at times but then again so does Caramon!  Anyway, I think that this movie was very good for its first go around.  Just remember the Hobbit and you can catch my drift.  The animation wasn't the best and mixing it with CGI rarely works well.  I'm going to take a guess and say that it was funds that made the poor decisions on a lot of the less than stellar mixing of the two.

I loved the voice-over by all of the actors.  They made it ""feel"" right and they fit right into the story.  This has been my dream for over 20 years and it finally came true.  Was it a bit disappointing?  Yes.  Could it have been better?  Yes.  Would I buy it?  Yes.  Sometimes even movies that aren't the best are still worth watching and still worth the story.  I know they cut out ALOT of the story and putting the whole book into an hour and a half was a bit much but if you have read the story as many times as I have it still flowed and gave me the pictures and images that I need to walk down the path to Solace with my dear friends and live the adventure as if I were truly there.

I would like to say that making these books into a LOTR - type of movie would be totally AWESOME and would rake in hundreds of millions of dollars.  Maybe this will lead to that type of film that will make Margaret and Tracy proud.  Because they are the best and although I never met them I will always be gracious for all that they have done for me in my life.  Thank you!",1195776000,,1678,4.057926829268292

3012084,4,B000Y7U996,"I like the art, although I would have preferred no CGI. Still, they did a good job... the characters and monsters look menacing when called for and a bit gritty to my eyes. The style is more in line with the 80s cartoons, which is also when I grew up watching cartoons, so I like them more perhaps because of it. The voice acting is actually pretty good. A few big names, like Kiefer Sutherland doing Raistlin, was a nice surprise.

It's tragic that they didn't do a better job and continue with the other books.

But, the story line is presented ok, for maybe a re-make with better works?  Fitting the details into visual is many times task.  Anyone who reads the first 6 books probably loves them, like the about 270 posts here!  Some young director and actors will score big, taking his or her time with these, i think?  It sold for pennies so i was more than happy with what i got - maybe even at full retail?  I actually wondered who hand animated a feature film today, as it is massively labor intensive and rare?  So i would commend some one who might have taken it on with theme intended?  And i will keep it, as i do buy things like old surfs, duck tales and super hero such.  Just not at all what i expected when i bought it.  It will get a place with Aladin on the shelf, and i have already watched it a couple of times to consider its merit?

I've read Chronicles, Legends, and many other Dragonlance novels. I love them and they are what brought me into the world of tabletop RPGs. These books hold a special place in my heart. This movie was not only a waste of my money and time, but it was just horrible. Simply and utterly horrible!

The only thing that made up for it's horrible-ness is that the voice acting was relatively well done. You can't shake the feeling though that the actors they got to voice this movie were doing it for the paycheck.

3012109,4,B000Y7U996,"I really enjoyed the film, classic D&D from a world with characters readers will be familiar with. I noticed some blurriness around the characters eyes at first but got used to it. Don't know if that was from the dvd to HD tv conversion or the animators intention. Tried it on a dvd player and a ps3, same result. After I got into the story I didn't notice it as much.
- Thoroughly enjoyed the story and characters. Never really recognized the All star voice cast, though I tried to listen and decide who they were, which I think was kind of a good thing. It means they did a good job of being someone else.
- Not the best animation overall, but acceptable. I would love to see a first class animated production of something DnD besides just LOTR. I mean, I love LOTR, but i hoped it would open doors for other epic DnD related productions or at least get some fringe projects like Hawk the Hunter finally produced. How anout a Drizzt movie!? I'd kickstart that! But, alas, not much as yet. Maybe only Peter Jackson can get financing for this genre?

3012114,3,B000Y7U996,"I was really excited when I found out about this movie existed.  I hadn't read the books in years; too long, really, so it was like a story I knew was great was going to be new to me again.  Then I read the reviews and was a bit more cautious.  I decided to check this one out anyway.  It's average.

EVERYTHING they say about the animation is true.  DoAT looks like a cheap flash cartoon, Roger-Rabbited together with CGI renderings done by a middle schooler using free software.  They use both in the same shot, too, and the effect is jarring.  The CGI characters, for example, don't cast shadows and look like they're resting atop the rest of the animation, rather than a part of it.  Any scene with the draconions is just awful.  The traditional animation is done better, but not much.  All of the characters have super-choppy movements, as if they cut several frames of animation out to save costs.

It's odd this looks so cheaply done, since they got some respectable Hollywood talent, such as Kiefer Sutherland and Lucy Lawless, for the voice acting, which is always at least passable and often quite good.  The story moves quickly, but I didn't mind too much.  It definitely crams more than one movie's worth of plot into 90 minutes, but I can only think this movie was made to secure Paramount's film rights to the Dragonlance property, so you weren't going to get a two-parter, anyway.  I caught only a few notable deviations from the book and didn't mind any of them.

Still, it's not as bad as it looks, even though it looks absolutely awful.  -5 stars for the visuals, 5 stars for being Dragonlance, 3 for the voice acting, and I'll give 'em a pass on the unimaginative MIDI-synth score.",1408492800,,1700,4.5394736842105265

Putting aside the fact, major points of the book are removed, edited, and such, as with most book to movie translations.  That in reality this should be two movies and not one, just to do the story justice.  This is a review on the actual product that was released.

1.  The animation is inconsistent, you will see nicely rendered 3D effects and scenes, and you will see lazy standard animation.  When I say lazy, I am talking poor quality.  And there is clumsy bouncing from scene to scene.

2.  For a large number of the 2D animations, to me it seemed like a pane was out of focus.  In my opinion the product never should have been ok'd to release, and the editor should be fired for his or her poor job in quality assurance of the animation process.

3.  The story is on fast forward, like I said before, this should have been broken into two movies, 90 minutes does not do the story justice.

4.  The voice acting is well done and is a positive aspect of the movie, at first I was not too wild over Kiefer Sutherland's voice of Raistlin, however he did grow on me, and he did a great job.  As well as the other cast members.

If you are a fan of the series, rent it before you buy it, and see if this is something you want in your collection.  I am more disappointed in the quality that  Paramount Pictures released.",1369526400,27,1566,4.173913043478261

3012129,2,B000Y7U996,"Let me first state this. I am a die-hard DragonLance fan. I have so many books we had to devote an entire bookcase. Some of my most prized possessions are two books dedicated to me by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. So needless to say. once I first heard that the long-fabled DragonLance movie was finally being released, I was elated. Yet, this elation was tempered with trepidation.

It has long been known that ""the book is better"". While some would disagree, I felt this held true with The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Even, minimally, with Lord of the Rings, as amazing a trilogy as those movies were. So with fear in my heart, I placed my preorder for the movie through Amazon.com, and waited patiently for the package to arrive in my mailbox. Then, the movie sat for nearly a year, before I watched it 4 days ago.

Why the delay? I was scared. And, after watching the movie, justifiably so. I was yelling at my television when scenes were altered. The mix of CGI and traditional animation was pulled off horribly. Even with the 'starpower' (and I use the term loosely) of the actors used, the voiceacting was lackluster. So without further ado, the review:

The Animation and Sound

The animation for this movie is, in short, average. While not as bad as that atrociously drawn Powerpuff Girls, the detail was not even as good as say, Thundercats (yes, I am showing my age). Most of the artwork stayed true to the books, with most of the characters posing at least a passing resemblance to the novels. Most notably, Raistlin and Tanis were the most accurate. Sturm's armor was a hodgepodge of silver metal; Caramon lacked his trademark Dragon Helm. Goldmoon's leather armor was generic, Flint looked somewhat like the taciturn dwarf, and Tasslehoff was a gaily-colored kender. The colors were bright and vibrant. Backgrounds were boring and lackluster, offering none of the details you would imagine from reading the books.

What set the DragonLance novels apart from other book worlds was the amazing detail the authors created. Here, the generic environments that the Companions find themselves in help further drive what could have been a glorious, fitting rendition into the dirt.

Even the CGI is lacking. The quality of the cinematics would be more appropriate in 1995, not 2007 (when it was released). No smoothing, jerky animation and the very obvious fact it was CGI detracts from the title. It is really bad when a draconian shows up rendered in full 3-D, attacking a very 2-D Sturm. Gee, having that extra dimension would probably help me win that fight, too.

The voiceacting and music could have helped the movie shine. Sadly, even with the voices of actors such as Lucy Lawless and Kiefer Sutherland, the talent is bland and without enthusiasm. The few times the characters are required to speak with any amount of emotion, it seems trite and sarcastic. While it cannot be expected, I suppose, that the actors involved in any movie project like the source material, it is obvious that they probably never read the books. Impromptu, misplaced bravado, random coughing fits for Raistlin, and characters that come across as egotistical idiots further ruins a 25-year-old franchise.

The music is nothing to write home about. To be perfectly honest, I can remember little of it. I suppose it could be said it suited the scene, but any movie that has a soundtrack that is immediately wiped from your memory pretty much failed in that department, too.

Story

Even with all of the aforementioned, if the movie had stayed true to the stories in the books, I would have been willing to overlook these (major) flaws. I could have ran my books through a shredder, danced on the paper bits and fed them to my dog afterward and done less damage to the story than this movie.

Aside from conversations happening that never took place in the books, the concept of ""foreshadowing"" is lost here. Cutscenes interspersed with the storyline pretty much give away the entire plot of the whole trilogy, even though this movie was designed to encompass the first book. While I understand that to execute a verbatim translation from the books onto film would have undoubtedly resulted in a 4-hour movie, critical scenes from the books were missing.

With the assumption that you have at least read the novels to have an interest in this movie, here goes some major missing scenes:

-The bulk of the Qualinesti interaction after the slave caravan is rescued
-The Sla-Mori sequence is horribly abbreviated, including the Dark Elf gone
-Rescuing the slaves at Pax Tharkas is shorted, with Eben never really being explained as a traitor
-The wicker dragon in the swamp, from the first part of the book, was missing entirely; the party literally went from Que Shu to Xak Tsaroth in one swift scene- I guess it was next door

This does not encompass every missing scene. Other major faux pas include revealing the true identity of Fizban right after the release of the slaves from Pax Tharkas, as well as having his death occur from falling into a chasm, rather than down the chain mechanism within the fortress. At the beginning, when the old man hobbles into the Inn of the Last Home, Tika asks him to tell her a story to help pass the time, which also never happened in the books. I suppose you could consider this a minor complaint, however, as a purist, this helps to foster the handholding this movie has. Come to think of it, there were no parts of the movie that weren't awkwardly and painfully explained later.

The Verdict

For the sake of completing your DragonLance collection, that is really the only reason I can think of to shell out your hard-earned cash on this cannonfodder. If you have only a passing interest in the series, are thinking about reading the books and find this to be a quick way out, or are a glutton for punishment and want to see a series with a rabid following destroyed for an hour (or so), pick this up. It is with a heavy heart that I say do not waste your money on this pile of... garbage. Pure and simple.",1364947200,5,6045,4.726495726495727

I have a hate/love relationship with the DVD.  It is poorly put together.  Several significant mistakes stack up to result in a less then decent quality to the movie.  The animation will speak for itself.  In my opinion, the choice to use top Hollywood talent for some of the characters only made the production value of the DVD seem even worse.  I also wished they would have made the whole trilogy at once as this DVD is only the first book and leaves you hanging!

The biggest standouts for me were the animations, CGI Draconians and Dragons.  They didn't work, movements and art was weak.  The contrast between CGI and the cartoon characters was painful to watch.  It would have been better if the CGI were cartoons like everything else.  Overall, this is best described as a terrible 1980's animation.  The Dragonlance Chronicles were awesome books; this childish cartoon did them no justice.",1330905600,3,826,4.794326241134752

This 'movie' was a travesty. Barely made it through to the end w/o turning it off.

For one things, traditional-ish animation & CGI should NEVER be mixed. EVER. This should be obvious from all the failed animes that have tried to combine the two and blatantly failed. It's just jarring to have two completely different styles of animation that don't work together on the screen at the same time. Either decide on full CGI or full animation. HYBRID ANIMATION DOESN'T WORK.

Also, the quality and presentation (characters, fight scenes, etc.) seemed to vary drastically throughout.

They need to get someone who actually LOVES the series to get in there and GET IT RIGHT... This was a pretty pathetic attempt to capture the Dragonlance phenomenon. Really, it seems like more of a cash grab with no attention to quality.

Rent it, if that. If for some bizarre reason you REALLY love it (really??), then maybe buy it. Otherwise, pass until they remake it properly (sadly, probably won't happen)...",1306195200,3,1093,4.918478260869565

They did leave out one big event, but I do understand why, because it's animated, and that part of the story was pretty rough.",1296432000,,298,3.966666666666667
3012146,3,B000Y7U996,"The original book is such a great story that this lame effort actually helps one to relive it in 90 minutes.  The problem is that, as a film in its own right, it demands that you not only suspend your disbelief but also that you suspend normal standards of viewing to get anything out of it.  If you haven't read the books, you'll get nothing and probably hate it.  If you have, you might be able to look past the many faults for the nostalgia value.

A messy combo of CGI and choppy cell drawings, the animation is downright silly and embarrassing in many scenes (from clumsily rendered sensuality of boobs bouncing to the hyper-detailed CGI draconians with rams horns) considering how good the books were.  Why do they integrate ""real"" flames of fire with the flat cartoon images every chance they get?  It would help the audience get into the story and forget about the limits of animation if they just stuck to 1 style.

The film does stick close to the book's plot, even using its dialogue, but cramming that into 90 min. means telescoping so many events together that the heroes can only exchange soulful sentiments without pausing between blasts from dragons and battles with hobgoblins. They arrive at a whole new continent by foot in every scene and engage in an epic battle every 5 minutes. Putting the ruined pacing and awful animation aside, it's a convenient review of the book's outline. Like watching the 10-minute narrated review of the entire LOST series.

Overall, I enjoyed it as a cheap diversion (like binge reading 100 Prince Valiant comic strips in a gosh-darn hurry).  It actually made me hope for a sequel that would do a better job with the next book in the Chronicles.",1296259200,,1695,4.6610738255033555

I know now Wizards of the Coast must be cheap  and turned this wonderful story into a crappy movie that should have been made just like the Lord of the Rings but instead was made very cheaply. Shame on them! They should have not done it at all just stick to the books.,1284336000,,600,4.172413793103448
3012150,3,B000Y7U996,"These books taught me to enjoy reading when I was 12 or 13.  Until that point, reading was something that was required by school.  I love the Chronicles series and highly recommend them to anybody, but especially those young teen types who may be emboldened by World of Warcraft or other fantasy series.  The books are pretty typical and owe a great deal of their story to (in my opinion) the Star Wars Series and The Lord of the Rings.  The ups and downs and as George Lucas would describe it, the classic story telling technique of a possible stand alone story (the first in all 3 mentioned seriesP), a deeper/darker second part, and a conclusion in part 3.  This stand alone was a good thing to make into an animated film in my opinion, but they could have done a lot more with it.

It is pretty true to the story in the book, and even provides some background information not mentioned in the original text.  I don't think this takes away from the movie, nor does its absence hurt the book, but it may have drawn away some of the portions of the book which I had grown quite fond of.  Most of Xak Tsaroth and the black dragon was skipped over or substantially abbreviated, and I really enjoyed reading those portions.  Also removed was the Tas in the False Black Dragon, another favorite of mine that I felt helped keep the characters and story in line.  It goes fine in the movie, but it was disappointing.

The music is actually pretty impressive.  Very Fellowship of the Rings and I am sure it is deliberately so.  It won't hold up to the Fellowship soundtrack to save its life, but its not bad.

The animation is a weird ""We wish we could draw like JAPANAME"" type seen in a lot of recent cartoons, and that is also disappointing.  Very Saturday morning cartoon/ old GI Joe, and that isn't the right answer.  Its not even The Hobbit good, which it might have learned more than a few things from and kept some of the old school flavor to make it seem a bit more nostalgic.  Some scenes are very well done however and the effort is apparent, but some look like they were not finished in time and just look absolutely terrible!  See the exit from Xak Tsaroth to see what I'm talking about.  The artists also took some liberties in their creation, which I am not a fan of.  Qualinesti got turned into some weird David the Gnome/Lothlrien hybrid, which is not how I perceived it in the least.  The characters are pretty well done, though Goldmoon is a blonde/blue, which doesn't make much sense for a Native American based culture.  Some complain about the Draconians and the CG animation technique used for them, but it really isn't all that bad.  The dragons are also CG.  Overall, once you can get past the choppy Saturday morning nature, you can power through.  For a book like this that means so much to so many people though, they really should have tried for crisper animation and continuity.  Do we expect Cowboy Bebop like art or Ghost in the Shell/SAC like precision?  Probably not, but we would at least like to see them try instead of settling for mediocrity.  The boobage is also a bit ridiculous.  Granted, the target audience is young teen males probably, but the reviewer who said it just felt weird to be watching Caramon check out Tika's obviously bouncing and gravity defying gigantic breasts hit the nail on the head.  They should have toned that back a bit and kept it sane.  There is a love story there between many characters, even sex in the novels, and Tika's rack is mentioned several times, but there are better ways to visualize it for your audience to show the connection and still hold a little bit of class besides the obvious focus on breasts in several scenes.  It can be quite obvious.  There is one scene where the camera actually starts out looking at cleavage before panning to the speakers face. If they make a second, I hope they leave the Kit promiscuity up to our imagination and we aren't faced with some awkward Team America sex scene.

Voice Acting-  Terrible.  There's really no other way to say it.  Sutherland may have been persuaded by cash or something just so they would have a name to put on the DVD case, but it sounds like he is saying his lines as lifeless and as quickly as possible to make it out of the studio and back to being Jack Bauer as fast as possible.  I always thought Gary Sinise would have been a shoe in for the role, live or animated, but again, just my opinion.  The hissing draconinan monks we probably all loved sounded like the weatherman from Peoria Illinois, crisp and clear, which really doesn't paint the character at all.

So overall, it isn't bad, but it isn't good.  It could have been so much more but just feels rushed and willing to accept good enough.  I would say it is worth seeing for any fan of the series, but it is in no way shape or form an adequate substitute for the book.  I wouldn't watch it prior to reading the books either, because the imagery provided in the books is much much stronger (what a pathetic thing to say about a movie really...) and your own imagination will be more than adequate when guided by the authors.",1278374400,,5123,4.457572502685284

I bought Dragons of The Autumn Twilight DVD with a cringe because of all the really bad reviews out there, but like others I just had to see if it was really that bad or if everyone just had too high of expectations.

I enjoyed this movie based on multiple reasons, the number one being I wanted to see the characters brought to life. Now take into point that there is NO way to make an animated movie that will accurately portray what your mind see's when reading. You would have to make a LOTR type (we can only hope) mega blockbuster to even come close. They did an excellent job with this movie... I loved the music and was left wondering why all these people are dissin' the graphics on this movie. If anything, the only thing I found wrong was how fast paced it was, I mean you can only cram so much into  1 1/2 hours I guess. This movie is what it is, a great story come to life. I didn't have a problem with the sound of this movie like some of the reviews I read, I guess either my system is great or there are some seriously bad ones out there.

3012155,1,B000Y7U996,"If you grew up reading fantasy novels, chances are you're familiar with Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis' Dragonlance series. The books are a staple in fantasy fiction, and contain some of the genres most beloved and renowned characters. The story revolves around the land of Krynn, which was abandoned by the light gods more than 300 years ago. Unfortunately for its friendly inhabitants, the dark gods have made a comeback. Cue the group of random heroes who traverse the land and fight all sorts of monsters in order to save the world.

When I heard that we were being treated to an animated Dragonlance feature, I was very, very excited; finally, I thought, Dragonlance would get a chance to shine in the mainstream. With a cast including Keifer Sutherland, Phil LaMarr, Lucy Lawless, Michelle Trachtenberg and others, it was sure to be a hit! How nave I was.

Despite having an excellent source material, Dragonlance: Dragons of the Autumn Twilight falls short in just about every department you can imagine. Even the very beginning of the feature will leave you shaking your head, as you bear witness to what looks like Beast Wars animation in the Dragonlance logo. (Which, by the way, goes on way too long for what it is.)

The animation woes aren't specific to the title screen, either. In what was a very stupid move, the film contains both 3D and 2D animation. The problem? Like I said, the 3D animation looks like early 90s CG, and the 2D animation belongs in an 80's Saturday morning cartoon, not a feature film in 2008.

If you're a Dragonlance fan, I bet right now you're reading this with a single tear running down your cheek, asking ""Surely the content can make up for those shortcomings!"" I'm sorry to say they don't.

What begins as issues with the presentation and techincal aspects of the movie ends with issues in every other area. For starters, this is a PG-13 movie for violence, yet there's very little violence, and what we do see is extremely poorly done. Since it's all hand-drawn (which, I admit, was a nice attempt at being unique), moments with a lot of action actually stutter and lag visually for a bit. Imagine loading into an area in World of Warcraft with a lot of people just hanging out, and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

Now, when I talk about the lack of violence, I'm not complaining because the movie isn't violent enough. Rather, the movie TRIES to be violent but just decides halfway through, ""You know what? Screw it. We're a cartoon!"" I'm talking full blown dwarven axe to the chest as an instant kill - yet not a single drop of blood. Or a person dramatically cutting away at a fallen opponent who's offscreen, yet when we pan out they're completely intact, and look like they're napping due to the jarred storyline instead of being slaughtered by an angry half-elf. That all changes when 3D baddies are involved, though. Stick them with something sharp, and they'll bleed a little until the wound vanishes in the next screen and their armor isn't even damaged.

When it comes right down to it, Dragonlance: Dragons of the Autumn Twilight relied too much on the original material. If you aren't familiar with the book, you aren't going to know what the hell is going on. Even Hickman has said in the past that the first book should be split into two movies; guess the makers of this one didn't listen.

If only the producers spent less budget on Hollywood voice talent which was largely miscast, and put more money towards the actual animation and editing, then maybe we'd have a serviceable film for Dragonlance fans, much like DC and Marvel's animated DVD features do their thing for comic fans. As it is, this is an affront to anyone who has ever loved the books, and I sure hope someone else gets a shot at the next Dragonlance film.

How you'll feel after this is all over

CONTENT - 1/5

Oh God, where to start. There's far too much material to cram into this short of a time slot, and what is crammed in doesn't flow well at all. People unfamiliar with the books will have no idea what the hell is going on, and people who loved the books will be pissed that the only character with any sort of build-up is Tanis.

VIDEO - 2/5

From a technical standpoint, I suppose there's nothing wrong with the output. From a stylistic one, though, it's a mess. Crappy 3D with dated 2D? Yeah, it would work assuming the 3D monsters weren't fighting the 2D heroes in half the scenes.

AUDIO - 3.5/5

There's 5.1 and 2 channel sound available, so if you have a system you can get something out of it. At times the music seems a little too loud, and turning it up to hear the talking will annoy your neighbors. Despite the list of big names, no one really stands out. (Except Phil LaMarr, but that's just because he uses the EXACT same voice as he did for Green Lantern. Close your eyes, and you'll hear John, not Riverwind.)

EXTRAS - 0.5/5

The two extras on the disc are basically Powerpoint presentations of preliminary artwork. Sadly, the line-art preview looks better than the final product.

REPLAY - 1/5

Unless you're the type who loves to get drunk with friends and laugh at old 80's cartoons, once you finish this you'll likely put it away for good.

OVERALL SCORE - 1/5

If you're a huge fan of the Dragonlance series and pick this up, be forewarned that you will eventually regret it. Sure, at first it seems okay, then at the end it seems like it picks up, but when it's all said and done, this straight-to-DVD animated feature falls short in every area.

3012159,2,B000Y7U996,"So much potential wasted, starting with a wonderful story (yes yes, LOTR ripoff, blah blah). The tale, to which this movie stayed fairly faithful to in many ways, is your standard epic fantasy including many of your favorite fantasy standards. Grumpy dwarf, dumb warrior goons, sneaky rogue, and so forth. Check.

They must have blown their budget on the voice acting. It was pretty good, and considering the cast, one would expect it to be.

Unfortunately, that's where the list of goodness ends. The wonderful story is brought to life by the animated equivalent of multiple personality disorder, and both personalities are the type you don't want to talk to at awkward family gatherings. On one side, you've got standard animation that looks like it was done by the He-Man and She-Ra folks on a bad day, and on the other side, you've got CGI dragons that wouldn't make the cut for your average MMO or console video game. The draconians weren't a total loss, but having the rather stiff CGI baddies going to battle with their drawn counterparts just didn't get the job done.

This DVD is best served as a rental, served up cold and shared with friends, paired with beer or diet cola as appropriate for your group. Share memories of novels read and/or D&D games played long into the night, have a few MST3K-style laughs, and move on.",1242604800,2,1333,4.737068965517241
3012160,1,B000Y7U996,"Let me start by saying that I did read the books.  I had high hopes when I heard the news there was to be a Dragonlance movie.  My hopes were killed fast when I saw the trailer.  Well maybe it'll still be good.  Nope.

First off the animation is poorly done.  The blending of 3D and cartoon animation does not mix well at all.  Maybe they should have spent more money on animation than they did with the voice acting.  Yeah there was an excellent cast for the voices, but that doesn't matter since the dialog sucks.

There's no depth to the characters either.  Everything felt so rushed.  They tried way too hard to cram everything into a 90 minute block.  Did I mention that the animation really blows?  I would have been happier with a low budget flick with B-movie actors.

Don't bother.  Well, if you have kids and you want them to experience Dragonlance, then by all means.  I'm sure they won't really care about how it looks anyways.  But for all of the die hard fans out there, including myself, what a disappointment.  Weis and Hickman should be ashamed for letting this project finish the way it did.

Cheap animation, lousy voice acting, no character development, I could go on and on.  Save your money and buy the books instead.  And to those who saw the movie and never read the books, please give Dragonlance another try and read the books.",1240876800,6,1353,4.463114754098361
3012161,2,B000Y7U996,"OK, like many other reviewers here I have been a fan of the books for very many years. I couldn't believe it when I heard they'd finally make a movie out of this...and couldn't believe what I saw upon its release. It is flawed on many levels. The animation is pretty bad. The combined 2D heroes against the CGI draconians just doesn't work. The voices are OK, but the requisite cheesy dialogue is in full force. Why is it so hard to write a fantasy script with some dignity? In addition, the idea of trying to cram the entire book into this short time is doomed from the outset. The story could never be done justice that way. I know the Chronicles would make an awesome anime series if you could do just one or two chapters in a half-hour episode. That way you could develop the characters and settings properly, which is really where the strength of Dragonlance lies. Oh well, I'm sure that is a pipe dream as there will never be the budget for that. For anyone who gave this a positive review, here is an objective test you should consider: Would you be proud to show this to a non-Dragonlance fan? I'd be more embarassed.
All that said, this clunker will still not dull my love of the books, which I will defend to the death. If you've never read the books and saw this, I can only beg you to overlook this subpar product and consider giving the books a fair chance.

Kiefer Sutherland, unexpectedly, plays Raistlin (and not one of the warriors as one might expect), but even he (surprisingly) does not do that good of a job.

It was killing the whole experience I remember from when I read the books. I just couldn't believe how a movie about my favorite book series could be so horrid.

If you are a fan of the series you have to at least rent it to see it for yourself. If your not a fan or are interested in the series don't bother with the movie.

Now for the let downs.  Graphics and actions sequences were not on the level of most recent movies, but the budget for the film was only around 1.5 mil from what I've heard.

Um, I figured wrong.

I don't even know where to start.  Oh, wait.  Yes I do.

The animation is horrible.  One of the reviewers said the animation reminded him of the old Saturday morning cartoons.  I think he's onto something - they must have pulled one of those old artists out of retirement.  And never mind that he has cataracts now.  And it's not even consistent!  The monsters are all done up in some kind of computer-generated animation, which only makes it look like they blundered into the wrong movie by mistake.

They packed way, way, WAY too much of the book into the movie.  Maybe the animation would've been forgivable if the movie wasn't covering a chapter or two every 10 minutes.  In any fantasy book you read, the richness of the characters plays a big part in the story's success.  The movie doesn't give you time to get to know any of the characters...if I hadn't already been familiar with them, I can guarantee I wouldn't have sat through to the end.

I almost didn't anyway.  The scripting and casting were horrible, too.  Kiefer Sutherland was a rotten choice for Raistlin - not weak enough, not sick enough, and CERTAINLY not sinister enough.  And you know all those ridiculous Power of Good declarations that fantasy authors always make?  The whole, ""I vow that I shall not rest until evil has been vanquished, and you know I really really mean it because I have a determined look in my eye and I'm raising my right fist.""  Yeah.  In a book good enough to draw me in, I can overlook how overdone that kind of nonsense is.  But that's all this movie had.  Those actors had to have been rolling their eyes the entire time.

So there you have it.  It's beyond bad.  It's even beyond so-bad-it's-funny.  What it is, though, is a waste of $15.

I was really disappointed at the end, though, because the movie really leaves you wanting the rest of the story and there IS no next movie.

I got to watch this with my kids who are just starting to read the books for themselves.  It was fun to see them get interested in the storyline.

The CG looks like a rough draft of the final product...if the final product was produced 20 years ago.  It would be analogous to an artist's storyboard with stick figures instead of live actors.  I mean, at least have a character's legs move like they are walking instead of gliding across the screen because you don't want to make the effort because you can't miss CSI:Miami.  The traditional animation is poor, stilted and awkward.  They should re-do this one with a budget larger than $32.

3012178,1,B000Y7U996,"Dragons of Autumn Twilight (Will Meuginot, 2008)

Will Meuginot has done a great deal of work on Saturday morning television, and it shows. I knew this was coming. And I was pretty sure it was going to be terrible. But I just couldn't stop myself from watching it. I wish I had.

If you haven't read the books, the plot concerns a party of adventurers who reunite after five years travelling the world of Krynn looking for a sign that the gods have not forsaken them. Of course, as soon as they get back together (except one, who's mysteriously missing), the sign shows up, and along with it a horde of goblins, as well as the folks who have been controlling the goblins. Adventurers to the rescue! Yeah, it sounds cheesy, and let's face it, most fantasy is, but in the hands of a talented writer-- and Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, who wrote the original Dragonlance trilogy, are very talented writers-- it can tread that line between cheesiness and majesty and come up smelling like roses. In the hands of screenwriter George Strayton, who has worked on such fare as Cleopatra 2525 and Xena: Warrior Princess, it becomes about what we expect, a cheesefest. This is not helped any by the fact that the animation is crude (thus my Saturday morning TV reference above) and looks as if it were drawn mostly by horny thirteen-year-olds who've never had girlfriends. So, then, Saturday morning TV with a distressingly adult bent, though one cast through the lens of a juvenile fantasy life. It made me want to bang my head against the desk until I could no longer see. If you're a fan of the original novels, do yourself a favor and stay far, far away from this mess.

We watched Paladine fight off Takhisis and then Laurana make out with Elistan.  In the book Laurana and Elistan always had more of a father daughter type relationship - he was her guide spiritually and she was his politically - and Tanis thought there was something more but there wasn't, Laurana only had eyes for Tanis until the 3rd book for only a moment when Tanis faces the Queen and Laurana believes that she has been betrayed.

3012182,2,B000Y7U996,"I've read all three Dragonlance books of the main trilogy and the first of the Lost Chronicles trilogy.  I'll give the movie credit that it stuck to the book's plot VERY well and any changes made were warranted due to the lack of screen time.  Still, the speed of the plot felt VERY rushed even with some scenes removed and some scenes felt almost comedic with the speed they were blazed through.  I did appreciate some of the extra scenes that were included for those who have read the entire DL Chronicles series (SPOILER ALERT: like the one scene where you find out Fizban is really Paladine).

I could have overlooked the mediocre 2D animation (I have an undying love for the old school) had the artists not have used any 3D.  The 3D work was very tacky since they had 3D monsters with textures and no outlines fighting 2D people with flat colors and outlines and it made for some very awkward battles.  It should have either been all 2D or the 3D should have been cell shaded to blend with the 2D characters better.  I also felt like the team overdid it on the lens flare filter.  Having some light training in the area, I could tell some scenes utilized filters from either Combustion or After Effects to save time and money on 2D animation and while I would have done it myself had I been working on this, it does cheapen the movie's feel and production value.

The orchestral score on the other hand was fabulous.  No real memorable riffs (like what appears in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or ""The Rock""), but you could tell money went into the music.  Voice acting is typical of your Saturday morning cartoon variety despite some heavy hitters in the cast.

Overall, this movie is worth a rental for the DL fan who read the Chronicles (like myself) and you'll probably never watch it again, but only really worth a purchase if you're the DL completist.  For those of you who did like it, Tracy Hickman has announced the movie has outsold its budget and the team is already in preproduction on the sequel.

If you're a DL fan you're gonna be disappointed. You'll wonder, ""Why did they bother?"" I mean, heaven help us if they do Legends!

I admire them for trying, but it really doesn't work. I can't imagine anyone watching this more than a couple times, then just putting it aside. Or selling it. Or trading it for a decent animation by Miyazaki

The storys ok. I guess. Its a simple straight forward plot - heroes go to Xak Tsaroth, face dragon, grab disks, back to Solace, then to Pak Tharkas to inspire rebellion among the slaves.

I think Tracy Hickman is right about them trying to cover too much ground in one short film. Maybe if the film covered up to the return to Solace as he wrote in his review

Maybe thats whats wrong

The less said about the animation, the better. Doesn't look so hot. Pretty embarassing that this is the best they could come with. I guess they were on a budget, but it looks cheap.

So I don't know.. if you've read the series (Chronicles, Legends) I guess you'll have to pick  it up just out of curiosity

Just don't expect too much

The extras are rubbish as well",1219795200,2,1136,4.341232227488152
3012191,5,B000Y7U996,"Like some of the other reviewers, I read the books when they came out (wow, about 20+ years ago!) when I was in high school.  As I was a big fan of AD&D, it was an easy sell.  I liked them well emough to recommend to my younger cousins as great introductions to ""D&D type fantasy"" and the Dragonlance books became their introductions to the world of gaming by sparking further interest.  Suffice it to say, the books themselves are great, so the DVD had a lot to live up to.

That said, unlike the Lord of the Rings and similar fantasy (Elric saga, Amber Chronicles) inspirations for D&D products, material, and plots, the Dragonlance Chronicles are not books I have gotten around to re-reading as an experienced adult (eight year military career behind me, five kids, years as an engineer, researcher,  etc.) to see how my take on it has changed.  Despite that, I do remember how interesting I found the books as a kid, and how interesting two of my older boys found the chronicles too.  I bought this DVD with my younger son (3.5 years) in mind, hoping it wouldn't be too dumbed down or ""Disneyfied"" to take away the various violent acts inherent in real fantasy genre material, but also that as a cartoon, it wasn't made to be super violent and adult themed like the 1980 movie ""Heavy Metal"" (unlikely given the book, but you never know).

I wasn't disappointed.  There is plenty of violence to demonstrate the consequences of failure and the nature of the stuggle, but it isn't glorified or graphic.  Unlike the D&D cartoon of the 80s (which my friends and I all watched Saturday AM, typically before a day of playing AD&D), the Dragonlance DVD showed that swords, arrows, fireballs, daggers, dragons, etc. did more than knock people down and scare people out of the way.  Characters died, and there is cost to glory.  Even kids (well, my friends, me as a kid, my own kids at least) can be pretty cynical about a fantasy cartoon where no one really ever gets killed or even really hurt in an all out battle (and we watched the D&D and Thundar cartoons DESPITE this, not because of it, making more and more jokes about the non-lethality of the evil spells, sun swords, werewolves, Beholders, etc. as we got older).

To me, this makes it a cut above and beyond most fantasy cartoons (D&D, Thundarr, etc.), and something I am still OK with my younger kids seeing.  Also, because it is the way it is, it appeals to my older kids who are happy to sit through it with their youngest sibling.  Though there is some blood and death, the way it is integrated in the story line and not gratuitously focused on prevents it from being something disturbing to a younger child.  Maybe I am not in synch with the mainstream, but I think the ""GI Joe culture"" inherent in most kids cartoons where there is lots of shooting, violence, spells, stabbing, summoning, explosions, etc., but no injuries or death is more likely to give them warped views on the consequences than a cartoon that shows death and injuries are likely consequences of such acts (except in cases of Roadrunner, Daffy Duck, Pink  Panther etc., where it is obviously a contrived a comical situation).

From what I could remember, the DVD is a very accurate rendition of the Dragonlance storyline in the original book (remember my memories are 20+ years old though), and that is part of the appeal.  While circumstance prevents me from playing role playing games anymore, it is my hope that this stimulates interest in the fantasy genre for my youngest children so that they too can find enjoyment in the books and some of the games that have come to be based on it.

As such, the five stars are because I am reviewing it for being what it was bought for...a fantasy cartoon that accurately sums up an excellent book, capturing the spirit and appealing to the non ""techno afficianado"" fan.  It may have little problems, perhaps the technical execution of every animated frame wasn't perfect like the super high budget Pixar movies, but it isn't that kind of movie, and it doesn't have to be.  It is a good movie with broad D&D fan appeal and good for kids of all ages.  Bearing in mind thatI paid 13 (pounds), which equates to over $25, |I got screwed on the price paying as much as possible for it it really.  That said, I am not disappointed and think (based on replay value for my various kids) that it STILL is good value for money.

It is my hope that the other Dragonlance books in the series are adapted to a similar DVD.  I will buy every one for my kids (and can be convinced to watch it through one sitting with them without arm twisting).

Hope my review helps most of you who are considering the movie.  I can see why some of the die hards don't rate it five stars, but really, I think the expectations are unrealistically high.  For the most part, the DVD rated by an adult is unfairly compared to the impression the book made as a kid (when one was less jaded and cynical).  As an adult, one sees a lot of the flaws, that are never observed as a kid, and as such, it becomes an impossible standard to live up to.",1219017600,4,5080,4.4902173913043475

You just have to be able to appreciate it for what it is.  If you haven't read up on Dragon Lance books and do not know these characters most likely you will not like this movie.  I just thought it was cool to see these characters in which I've been reading about for years brought to life.  There actions were played out perfectly in the movie.  The only flaw I found was in Tasselhoff.  I felt that his voice was off and that kender tend to babble on much more then was shown in this movie.

Long story short, the animation is way sub-par for todays standards (truth be told, sub-par for 20 years ago). Great call in some of the actors for voices, but it may have been better to spend the money on quality animation and got some lesser known actors.

3012196,4,B000Y7U996,"Based on the much acclaimed novel, Dragons of Autumn Twilight by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, the new Dragonlance movie of the same name is both a disappointment and a treasure. The novel Dragons of Autumn Twilight was an instant best seller starting off the Dragonlance series based in the fantastical realm of Krynn with all its dragons, wizards, and light handed kender. As the years have passed, the series has grown and expanded creating a uniquely complex and somewhat logical realm with a solid character base and a penchant for creativity. Along the way, Dragonlance has gained a vast audience of fans varying in ages from young to old. So, of course, it has long been expected that a movie encompassing the delightfully destructive realm of Krynn would be forthcoming. Twenty years later we get a straight to DVD low budget production that, despite the obvious lack of effort, still held a certain magical something that encapsulated the viewers' desperate dreams of dragons.
----------------------------------------------

The story sticks surprisingly close to the novel it was based upon, including all the major events and not deviating from the original storyline even slightly. It begins with rumors of a wicked army, ruled by the evil goddess Takhisis, amassing in the north, ready to end the 300 years of peace that has reigned over Krynn since the Cataclysm. This army has successfully awakened an ancient evil: dragons. Long thought to be creatures of legend, they have returned to Krynn and in the wake of their fiery breath, millions of innocent citizens are dying. But, the gods of good have not forsaken Krynn and in the wake of evil, they send a crystal staff that holds the key to salvation. As the battle between good and evil rages onward, a cast of unwary heroes joins to fight the darkness of dragons. Among these heroes are Tanis, a dispirited half elf who finds himself not only confused by the battle raging around him, but by the battle inside his heart, a heart wrenching emotional battle between two women that he loves and the inevitable choice he must make that will change everything. Also, not to be missed are the two brothers Majere, Raistlin, a sardonic wizard in training whose limited powers belie his heart of darkness and Caramon, his good natured brother. Along for the journey are two mysterious Plainsmen, Riverwind and his paramour Goldmoon, who possesses the staff gifted to her from the Gods. And, not to be forgotten, the grumpy but lovable old dwarf Flint and his kender sidekick whose good natured curiosity often slides into thievery. And, of course, not to be overlooked is Fizban, the doddery old wizard who just never can recall the correct incantation for that fireball spell. None of the beloved cast of characters, both good and evil, from the novel is left out and the viewer is delighted to finally meet their favorites in ""person.""

Unfortunately, the movie follows the novel so closely that it ends with a cliff hanger, as does the novel leaving the viewer somewhat unsatisfied since it is unlikely that a sequel will ever be made. The novel was originally followed by two sequels, Dragons of Winter Night and Dragons of Spring Dawning which concluded the drama and satisfied the reader. Since the movie did not contain the events that transpired in the novels mentioned above, there is no true conclusion but rather an ominous foreshadowing for the future well being of Krynn.

The characters, while represented by shoddy animation, were nevertheless presented appropriately, perfectly mirroring the characters in the novel. The voices chosen for each character were perfect, enabling the viewer to immerse themselves into the characters' personas even deeper. The main actors that lent their voice acting to the film are the ever talented Kiefer Sutherland, Lucy Lawless, and Michael Rosenbaum. In this presentation lies the beauty and the satisfaction of the movie. The major events that shocked and delighted the reader were presented magnificently, reminding the viewer vividly of the happy hours spent immersed in the novel. Likewise, the characters we have come to love are brought to a vivid life, drawing the viewer into the world of Krynn once again. Because of this seemingly incidental evocation of a realm we have come to love, the movie succeeds with the viewer despite its flaws.

But, what of the cons? Firstly, I must complain loud and long about the presentation of this film. We, the avid fans, have waited years for this moment when Dragonlance finally hit the big screen. So, image the instant irritation when I accidentally discovered this film, floating around aimlessly on Amazon. There was no press, no trailers, no effort. The movie was released without any pomp, going straight to DVD and into the realms of instant anonymity. Once I watched the film, I instantly realized why. Obviously, this film had a budget of approximately fifteen dollars; while the voice over actors who were hired were extremely talented, the animation was pure rubbish. I was not terribly pleased that the creators of the film choose animation. Why not take Dragonlance to the big screen, fill it with real actors and incredible effects such as the much acclaimed Eragon? Why must the film be relegated to the realms of animation? Animation is intended to amuse children, not to present a serious drama. That prejudice aside, the animation itself was the poorest quality that I have ever seen. It was stiff, jerky, and contained minimal details. It appeared more like a slow moving comic strip, with entire frames missing causing the film to be a jerky mess that hesitantly and unexpectedly jumped from frame to frame and scene to scene. Very, very poor Dragonlance. Must do better.

And what of the uninitiated viewer who has no pervious knowledge of the Dragonlance saga? If you discover yourself to be one of these individuals, then skip this film. The movie was obviously intended to please the adamant fan's need to collect more overpriced Dragonlance memorabilia. For those who are just looking for a fun fantasy adventure, the Dragonlance movie will prove more of a slapdash effort that follows a set pattern established by a novel that relied heavily on sequels. The ending will prove abrupt to those who are not familiar with the novels ending. If you are searching for a fun, but serious fantasy film then look elsewhere.

The special features included on the DVD are, like the entire production, sparse. They include the original test animation and the initial character design and nothing else. Once again, the creators opted for the inexpensive instead of the impressive.

To Watch or not to Watch?

With all its myriad flaws, the Dragonlance movie still proves an enjoyable sojourn into the wonderful realm of Krynn that will remind adamant Dragonlance fans of the long hours spent bent over the latest novel, dreaming of the characters and trying to out guess the authors' serpentine plot. For this reason, it is definitely worth watching for the already established Dragonlance fan. However, a viewer with no prior knowledge of this realm will be disappointed and instantly disinterested. Recommended to Dragonlance fans only.

When I saw the previews for this my stomach sank because of the animation. Nevertheless, I was going to buy it anyway because I hoped the storytelling would make up for that.  Was I wrong.  The story was altered and its horrible.  Key points were changed and driving the faith premise was untrue to the characters.  The voice talent may have been high caliber but the dialogue was lacking.

I got the impression that the script writer was given an outline of major plot points and given free reign as to how to get there. The dialog is stitled, the voice acting (from a cast I had high hopes for) were clearly phoned in. On the other hand, the music was well done.

1) The animation is awful. It is reminiscent of bad 80's animation fused with horrible CG work and is also jerky looking. However, I could have forgiven the animation if the story line had been decent.

2) They took a movie that probably could have been adequately done in 3 hours and shoved it into 90 minutes. The movie starts off following the original story line, then in an attempt to make it fit into 90 minutes veers completely off course. There was very little character development, virtually no background info regarding the characters was shown and important points in the plot (that would have been relevant to a sequel) were totally omitted. It's like they put in the first few chapters of the book then just jump to the last chapter in an effort to end it in time.

3) Pet peeve: What's up with the Forest Master being covered in vines??? Seriously! Was she attacked by Swampthing or something?!?!?

I could probably continue to rant about the other offenses this movie has to offer such as: the terrible voice acting, inconsistencies and mediocre script. However, I believe I have covered the important points.

Although animated films of some of our favorite stories fall way short, they still can remind us how great the stories are/were.

3012205,1,B000Y7U996,"The book Dragons of Autumn Twilight, is an excellent fantasy novel rich in storytelling and character development.  This adaptation is the exact opposite.

One of the key element that makes the books so intriguing is the character development.  The books weave an intricate backstory for each character.  You can argue that the characters are caricatures of common fanatsy types, but the books do an excellent job developing these individuals.

Not so for this movie... not even close.  Tanis, the reluctant leader of the band is just another member of the group.  Raistlin, the most complex of the group, is reduced to a mere mage.  What could easily fill a 3-hour long movie is instead butchered and crammed into 90 minutes of terribly-paced story-telling.  Key character plot points are also lost:  For those who have read the book, there are just a few key plot points missing:  Bupu makes only a slight appearance, Kitiara is barely mentioned as relevant, the entire backstory of the blue crystal staff bringing hope to Krynn is lost, the Forestmaster isn't mentioned, the complex relationship between Tanis and Raistlin, Tanis and Laurana, Caramon and Raistlin... heck every single complex relationship in the book is trivialized into a 5 second sound bite, if it is even mentioned at all.

Additionally, this cartoon looks no better than the average 80s Saturday morning cartoon.  In fact, in many places, the animation was awkward.  With the technology available today, I am amazed that they released a product of such low quality.  They literally should be ashamed.

I am a huge fan of Dragonlance, and perhaps my fan-dom makes me more critical of this movie.  After all, I consider Dragonlance part of my youth.  But in all honesty, this movie was simply terrible.  It's a waste of money and time.  Skim the book in 90 minutes instead.  You'll come up with a much better movie in your head.",1213920000,5,1900,4.930599369085174

As such, like most people who have read the book before the movie comes out, I had some disappointment in this film. As a ninety-one minute film, it would have been impossible to include everything from the book faithfully represented here. However, certain things from the book were changed for the film to the point that they were entirely different: the rescue of the children in Pax Tharkas, the final battle with Verminaard and others were changed completely from how they transpired in the book. This was a bit of a problem for me. Other events from the book were left out entirely, likely due to time constraints.

The animation was good, in most places and the filmmakers seem to have combined CGI with traditional animation techniques, even including Japanese-style illustrations for the scene showing the pegusus and unicorns.

The dialogue did well in its attempt to capture the moods of the main characters. The initial distrust and tension between some of the characters did come through in the film. However, some of the dialogue did reach beyond the limits of drama to become so corny as to be downright intolerable for me to listen and I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the dialogue, especially from Tanis during the battle with Verminaard. More like Saturday morning cartoons than it should have been.

If the filmmakers had wanted, they could have made this into a full-length film, rather than the ninety-one minute treatment they gave it. With all the bad three-hour long films that have come out recently, DRAGONLANCE had all the elements needed to create a thoroughly-enjoyable film for all ages, yet was given what seemed to be halfhearted devotion from the filmmakers this time around.

What does give me some hope is that a new generation of DRAGONLANCE fans may be created after having seen this movie and becoming interested enough to buy the books for themselves. If/ when that occurs, they will be exposed to the beautiful world of Krynn and all the tragedy, beauty and thrill that it provided to me and to many others.

After watching the first few minute I had to check the date on the box to see if I was watching a show made in the 80's.  Nope...copyright 2008...after that I said to myself do not judge this by the looks of the animation focus on the story...I then felt like I was watching a chopped up version of the story where part of the story were forced into the movie to be somewhat close to the book.  I watched the movie till the end and felt a little ripped off.  But more than anything I was sad by the poor quality (think original animated Hobit that was better) of the animation and the poor story telling that this movie provided.  I hope that another animation or even a live action movie would be made of the Dragon Lance series that would truely tell the story as it is written.,1211068800,4,970,4.221621621621622

I cannot believe that Wizards of the Coast even let this beast pass muster.  This is an embarrassment to their name.  I couldn't get past how Tika was made to look more like a lady of the night than a young, attractive, innocent maiden that she is when the adventure starts.  The choices of which gods are CGI (e.g. Takhisis) and which are 2D animation (e.g. Paladine) are completely non-sensical.

The voices aren't that bad, and the storyline doesn't seem to be too polluted (thankfully not toned down to make it G rated or anything like that).  However, the visuals are just too god-awful to describe.  Had it been done in a particular style throughout (such as looking like an 80's animation), I might have been able to stomach it.

So I was a bit apprehensive about a film being made from it since most books are lost in the translation to film.  This, however, was not the case for Dragons of Autumn Twilight.  The personalities of the characters are what I had imagined for the most part, but more importantly the most important scenes from the book are transported almost verbatim to the film.

I read these books when I was in high school in the 80's.  So I was pretty excited to hear that they were making an animated version.  Luckily, I just rented this from Blockbuster instead of just buying it sight unseen as I had originally planned.

As a HUGE fan of the Dragonlance series, to say that this movie was a disappointment is a massive understatement.  It is bad on so many levels.  The voice actors are terrible.  Keifer Sutherland as Raistlin is the ONLY voice that is decent.  I like Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor on Smallville, but he is TERRIBLE as Tanis.  And whoever the guy is that does the voice for Flint, he needs to just hang it up and get another job.

The animation is barely passable as Saturday morning cartoon fare.  It is literally some of the worst animation I have ever seen.

I realize that they're trying to cram a lot of material into 90 minutes, but the screenplay is so disjointed that it seems like you're just watching a bunch of vignettes and not a single cohesive story.

Also, maybe it was just the DVD that I got, but everything was blurry.  It gave me a headache to watch.  I almost turned it off a few times because of this.

To sum up, this movie was terrible.  I can't think of a single positive comment to make.  If they make any more, I doubt I'll even bother to watch them.  At least the books are still good.",1208217600,4,1378,4.291828793774319

All the depth and sequences that made the novels such an epic is truly lost in this movie.

3012232,3,B000Y7U996,"I had a really hard time watching this movie.  Perhaps I went into it biased after reading the reviews.  Perhaps I've read the books too many times to enjoy the movie.  I don't know, but I'm glad that I rented instead of purchased.
I don't feel that the characters look much like what is seen in Art of Dragonlance.  Those are the images I see when I read the books.  The mix of animation and CGI is just plain terrible.  To that point, if the dragons were going to be CGI anyway, do a live action film!  I guess that's what I've always hoped for in the first place.  It was done with LOTR, why not Dragonlance?
Back to the movie itself, they messed with the story line and changed things a bit.  That always irks me in movies based on books.  Somehow, some of the best parts and many times important aspects of the story are always cut.  Condensing the part about Pax Tharkas didn't bother me too much, the general idea was intact.  But, when Gilthanas and the Companions are rescued by Porthios, the storyline becomes too mangled.  Laurana's immaturity/naivety is portrayed poorly.  Also, there is no spy aspect and the entire Sla Mohri is a joke.  They find the secret passage and it leads them directly to the slaves and their open prison door.  Too easy and way less exciting (No Green Gemstone Man either).
The voice acting is very good.  Keifer Sutherland as Raistlin is superb, although he wasn't well written.  He seemed too nice and his relationship with Tanis was too friendly.  Much of the dialog sounded cheesy.  Fizban was also not portrayed as the befuddled mage we all know and love.  He was too ""there"".  You also find out his true identity at the end of the movie.
If you really want to see the movie (to get it out of your system), rent it cheap, see if you can get it from the library, whatever.  I would not recommend purchasing the movie unless it can be found somewhere for $1.",1206576000,,1900,4.412103746397695

3012236,2,B000Y7U996,"This review won't be as positive as the others.  While I see even the great Tracy Hickman came to make a review I have to do this to warn those of you who loved the books as much as myself.

First of all, like other reviews, the animation was awful.  The non-draconic animation reminded me of Hanna Barbara animation.  I didn't like that the dragons were CGI and not the rest of the characters.  It made me feel like the Companions were looking at a blue screen while they were drawn.  One style or the other should have been chosen.

Secondly, many of the supporting cast characters were removed entirely.  While the traitor who was making Gilthanas look bad might not have been important I thought removing Berem, the green gemstone man, was a huge mistake since he is a big part of the series.

Most of all, I thought what they did with Fizban was horrible.  This is a major spoiler so if you have not read the Chronicles please stop reading this paragraph.  Fizban was not supposed to directly help the companions!  That was the irony of his little absentminded nuisances.  But in the movie he deliberately takes action against the forces of evil and saves the day at least once.  This was not how Weis and Hickman wrote the Chronicles.  Those like Fizban were not suppose to take direct part in the War.  They might give a little nudge but only in the most indirect way.  I was very diappointed that the old storyteller was removed and Fizban was put in to do both parts.  Yes, they were supposed be the same being but we didn't find that out until the third book.  Plus I loved the foreshadowing that the storyteller did in the books by moving the tables around.  Alot of little things like that really made the books jump out as I read them.  The movie had none of that.  I also didn't like the how the viewer found out who Fizban was at the end of the movie.  This is telling me that the producers of the movie feel like they will not be able to get the backing to make the next two.  Even so, that should have been left out because Fizban is to return several times and the character will not be the same to those who hadn't read the books.

While I will admit that some scenes in the book could not be placed in the movie because of time restraits, I missed things like the ""death on black wings"" story Riverwind told and the Wicker Dragon head with little legs hanging out the mouth.  I also didn't like how Tanis's faith was the main reason the dragonlord was vanquished.  Tanis's faith is tested throughout the trilogy and it was not his faith alone in the old gods that allowed the companions to overcome the villian.

If you haven't read the books, then by all means watch the movie, but I believe you will be only getting half the story.  If you are a diehard dragonlance fan like me though...beware.",1206230400,5,2816,4.361538461538461
3012237,2,B000Y7U996,"I desperately wanted to like this. It has a special place in my heart as the first series of books I ever read without being forced to do so.

The Pros: The overall story remains pretty true to the novel. The voice acting is decent. It prompted me to go back and start re-reading the series for the first time in over a decade. The CGI is done well in some parts (mostly the title scene)

The Cons: The animation is truly horrible. It makes the movie painful to watch. The 'integration' of CGI and traditional animation clashes horribly and is very distracting. The traditional animation is choppy, inconsistent, and distracting.

The Bottom Line: If, like me, DragonLance was a milestone of your youth and you will not be able to rest well until you've watched it, rent it. It's not going to ruin those pleasant memories. Just be warned that it will be a painful experience. If this will be your first experience with this great trilogy, do yourself a massive favor and skip it. Read the book instead. If you don't have time to read the book, try to find it as an audiobook. Do not let this be your introduction to the series.",1206144000,4,1127,4.461165048543689

The title itself really expresses how I feel about this Movie.  I read the other reviews commenting on it, but I thought: ""Maybe they just didn't enjoy the book as much as I did.""  Unfortunately now I have seen that in general, the other reviews I read were actually being somewhat kind in their opinions.

I ask the animation director, ""What happened?""  That is all I really want to know.  Tell me you sent them the wrong copy to be pressed.  Tell me that you actually had another one that was much better, and instead you sent them one from about 6 months earlier that was just slightly better than static story boards.

For its part, the movie was pretty true to the story in the original book.  Although some parts were left out that I thought could fleshed it out so much more.

I think it would be wishful thinking to think they would come out with the 2nd book as a movie adaptation.  But I will hold out hope that they will, so they could hopefully redeem the tarnished name that is the Dragonlance Chronicals.",1205884800,3,1203,4.345291479820628
3012240,1,B000Y7U996,"When I saw this DVD in the store I had to buy it because I have been waiting for this series to get made into a movie for so very long. I knew from just looking at the packaging it was likely going to dissapoint, but I just HAD to see it for myself.

It was excruciating.

The narrative was horrible and rushed, with a terribly inept attempt to explain the world we were about to witness and how it worked. In fantasy, this is death. I must be made to understand the world and how it applies to what I am watching. How are the rules different? What drives people. What is the history behind the story I am watching? All terribly done here.

The characterizations were terrible. Am I truly to believe everyone in Kryn speaks with a standard American accent from the 21st century? No difference between how the plainsmen talk and how the residents of Solace talk? No difference for the elves? For Sturm as a Solamnic knight? Fizban was hardly what one could call befuddled in any sense of true acting. Raistlin, the driving force of interest behind the entire series, was played poorly with too strong of a voice, and far too little emotional interplay and development with the others. He and Tas barely interact with Fizban at all, even though their interplay is supposed to set up the running storyline with that character for the rest of the series. The magic was so terribly executed visually and so untrue to the world of Dragonlance as to be laughable.

And the complete ruining of the Fizban storyline suspense at the end was inexcusable. The suspense regarding who Fizban is and how he fits in to everything is suposed to be sustained for a majority of the series, and they blow it at the end of the very first movie. Now the character is worthless emotionally for the remainder of the story because the mystery is completely gone, and there was never any emotional attachment established between that character and any of the remainder of the party.

I only hope this terrible effort is like the Lord of the Rings animated effort was before the Lord of the Rings series was made properly by Peter Jackson as opposed to the final say on the visualization of the world of Kryn. The story deserves better.",1205712000,5,2209,4.526315789473684
3012241,1,B000Y7U996,"It's unfortunate that a strong story like the Chronicles series gets a very heavy handed treatment in this animated film.  I'm surprised it was even released, but they should really take this film and bury it.

I tried to like this film and watch it through, but I couldn't.  The animation might be the worst I've seen...ever.  Everything looks vaguely like old episodes of He-man, but worse.  Characters don't move smoothly, and action sequences are downright embarrassing.  The sad thing is that the poor animation becomes so distracting that you can't concentrate on the story or even tell if the voice acting is any good.

I never would have thought that a movie version of these books could be this terrible, but it is and people should stay away. Buy the books, they're amazing.",1205193600,7,784,4.8059701492537314

Unfortunately for us fans, the director and animators didn't seem to like the story one bit. The animation was lackluster even compared to day to day cartoons. The pace of the action was very slow, the art didn't do it any justice. I am sorry for the voice actors as they lend their talent for such lacking products. It is possible that they spent too much money in the voice talent and dropped the ball using a less than qualified animation studio. Very very unfortunate. Not even the CGI looked appealing.

I don't criticize this product for being a purist. I criticize it by comparing it with similar products and other animations. If you want to see a good D&D animated video, skip this one and pick up Record of Lodoss War, the original 13 chapters.

The voices used sounded more like boys who are going through their voice change than adventurers! The animations just are cheesy especially the draconians. The draconians didn't move half the time and just glided across the screen. They were done in a completely different style than the rest of the movie. It looked as if they started designing the draconians in detail then decided it wasn't worth the work, gave up, and didn't do it in any other part of the movie.

I was wrong, no one is jaded, this movie just destroys memories of some great books. It took me several tries to force myself to watch all of this, as I shut it off the first few times after a few minutes. The animation is actually painful to watch as it is jumpy and jerky, plus very poorly drawn. It looks like very badly done Flash animation most of the time. Also the addition of the full CGI fire, draconians, and dragons makes it all the jarring and out of sorts. The story is rushed and the voice acting is terrible. Most of the dialogue sounds as if the actors are reading it are bored out of their minds and just want to get paid and get out of the studio as fast as possible.
 If someone had never read the Dragonlance books and watched this, they would most likely never want to read the books considering what a negative impression this would leave. If you can't do something justice, why even bother producing it in the first place?",1203984000,10,1078,4.36318407960199

The movie decided to keep to the book's dialogue as much as possible, which is usually a poor choice when converting from written word to spoken.  While the voice acting was admirable and well performed, the exchanges were painful to hear. Further, the decision to meld very poorly done 'hand drawn' animation with equally poorly rendered computer graphics made for an eyesore.

And yet, the power of nostalgia is strong.  Seeing Tanis banter with Flint, Taz helpfully borrow everyone's items, and Tika's curvaceous body saunter around did kindle a small spark of enjoyment.

I checked out the reviews on amazon and was instantly reluctant to watch it, as if I did, it would just ruin a time of my childhood for ive wanted this film to be made for 20 years or so and the reviews were not as i hoped.  The movie sat at my house for 3 days before i had the courage to watch it for fear it would just be a jacked up and just plain trash.  CGI works great...Charecters just as i remembered them in my mind.  Raistlin's robes, eyes, personality, well they are beyond great.  i don't know why the film was made or the budget or any of that but what i do know is that this film is, honestly speaking one of my drams coming to be.

3012258,3,B000Y7U996,"Let me start by saying I am a fan of the Dragonlance Series and was probably going to purchase the DVD anyway. However, I did read the review offered by Tracy Hickman and was glad I did read it before I made my purchase and viewed the DVD. His explanation of the (low) quality of the animation was right on and alleviated me the despair I would have endured if I was not prepared. Similarly, his explanation that the movie should have been done in two parts also allowed me to more accepting of the hurried and choppy flow of the movie. Character development is not what it probably should be and that may be due to the length of the film and them trying to get a lot of information into a 90 minute movie. Again, I see Mr. Hickman's point.

Even with all of that, I am still a fan of the series and will purchase the next installation. Knowing how long it took for LOTR to come to big screen, I am willing to wait for that to happen with Dragonlance and will support the animated version(s) until that time occurs.

I would caution newcomers to the Dragonlance world to either read the book first or watch the movie with someone who is intimately knowledgeable about the Dragonlance series. They will be able to fill in some of the details and character development that the animated movie was not able to accomplish due to the short length of the movie.

As I said before, I would have purchased the move anyway and hope that fans of the series also purchase it as well. Hopefully, that will send a message to the filmakers that there is an audience for this genre and cause them to put more money into the next production as well as take the writers suggestions into consideration. And, who knows, maybe there might be a live action film somewhere in the future. Some of the casting ideas found on YouTube have been quite intriguing.

3012259,2,B000Y7U996,"Dragonlance has been around since the 80's. It was the third campaign setting ever published by TSR, which has long since become a subsidiary of Hasbro, the company known as Wizards of the Coast.

Back when it first came out, I thought it was a pretty cool world, although back then I was only into the World of Greyhawk.

Despite that, I do remember buying the modules and reading them, as well as the very first Dragonlance Trilogy.

When you take into account how many novels I've read over the decades that have ensued since, it's no wonder that I barely remember any details about the novels, except that I thought that they were pretty good despite having similarities to other fantasy novels.

But, I've said that before in many of my reviews, there is nothing new under the sun, only different ways old stories and characters are presented.

So, about a year ago, I heard that Wizards of the Coast had a movie based on Dragons of Autumn in the works. At first, I thought that it was a live action movie, and that some fairly famous actors were involved in it.

Keither Sutherland, Lucy Lawless and Michael Rosenbaum all had roles in the movie. It wasn't until only a few months back that I learned that this movie was not live action. Instead it was a combination of computer animation and more traditional cell animation.

I figured, hey, cool! Since the first Dungeon and Dragons movie was an atrocity, and the direct to DVD sequel wasn't all that much better, I had high hopes that this movie would do well, because it was done in a less demanding medium.

So, when it was released on DVD a few short weeks ago, I went out of my way to try and find it. I should have realized that something was amiss when I only managed to track down one copy of it just last week.

I finally had a chance to sit down and watch it with my wife and we were both disappointed in it.

For starters, I found that the animation was sub-standard. I've seen better animation on the cartoons that my son typically watches on Teletoon or on Saturday mornings.  What really struck me and made me laugh out loud was that during the very poorly drawn battle scenes, there was next to no blood. Goblins and people were stabbed with swords, but when the weapons were withdrawn, there wasn't any blood on them.

And yet some of the female characters `ahem' assets were very well portrayed and even shown to bounce up and down enticingly at least once.

Then there was the computer animation. Again, I've seen better animation on weekly shows, such as back in the day, Reboot and Babylon 5. Even Tripping the Rift had better animation.

To make matters worse, the traditional animation and the computer animation wasn't meshed cleanly. It was too obvious and very poorly done.

This leads me to believe that most of the budget for the movie was probably used to pay to get the better named actors to provide the voices for the characters.

Things seemed far too rushed in my view. Characters were introduced, and in at least one case, one was introduced right near the beginning of the movie and promptly never heard of again.

I didn't get any feel for these characters at all. Maybe if the movie had been drawn out into a mini series of 6 or more half hour episodes, it would have been better. Even when a prime character seemed on the verge of death, I was like `eh, no big deal, he dies, he dies.'

That's not right!

I should actually give a damn about the characters, especially since I was already at least somewhat familiar with them (although, two decades since I read the first trilogy, my memory of these characters is at best, vague.)

That being said, I would have to guess that this was supposed to be the first in a trilogy of movies, or maybe the lead into a potential TV series. When you consider how cheap the animation is, I'd have to guess that the latter is more likely the case.

Now, the question begs to be asked. Would I recommend this movie to anyone?

I'm sorry to say, but no. The only way I'd recommend it to anyone is if I knew that they were huge fans of Dragonlance. Even then I'd be hesitant to do so, as they would probably be even more disappointed in the DVD than I was.

Finally, the additional features on the DVD were minimal at best. Character concepts and test animation, and of course trailers for upcoming movies.

So, when it comes to the bottom line, don't waste your time.

I am A Huge Dragonlance Fan. When the original Dragons of Autumn Twilight came out back In 1984 (I think), I only started playing AD&D
I Read the book in 1986 and all Six Dragonlance Chronicles & Legends by 1989.
To Say I am a fan would be an understatement. Today I am 37.5 , I read more than 100,000 books in my life, most of them Science Fiction & Fantasy, but many others as well. Still, of all the books I've read in my entire life, Dragonlance Chronicles & Legends were the ones that touched me the most. I am not sure I will ever be touched reading a book the same way ever again in my life. I also read many other Weis & Hickman Books, but their greatest masterpiece is definitely Dragonlace Chronicles & Legends. In my Personal Opinion they outrank Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings by far and wide, as well as any other from the thousands of fantasy books I've read. Obviously I was immensely excited when I heard a movie of my favourite books ever was coming out. However this movie is so bad - such a joke made out of a masterpiece - It is Simply Terrible.

3012262,3,B000Y7U996,"Ok, I've read most of the Dragonlance books that have been released.  I have a huge paperback collection.  So I approached this video with a little  hesitation, I didn't want to be disappointed.  Plus I have viewed a lot of animation in my life and I think I know what looks good.  I'll just give my opinion of what worked and what didn't in this video.

Pros-  Almost intact story and portrayal of characters.  This was the first  book of the series, so it was basic and there wasn't a lot of character development.  There are 7 companions, which is a lot of characters to develop, not to mention the antagonists as well.  Good introduction to the characters and world, but need to have sequels to further develop characters.  The art is colorful and nicely drawn.  The musical score is very nice as well and gives an appropriate mood to the story.  It is also nice that it tries to appeal to an older audience by having some slightly adult humor in it (gotta love Tika's curves) and bloodshed, although the blood was a little late (the first fight is bloodless even though many goblins are slain).

Cons-  With this being the first video adaption of this huge storyline, I think it should have offered more than what it is.  The producers should have targeted an audience unfamiliar with the story as well as avid readers.  Although nicely drawn, the animation was very choppy and it almost makes my eyes hurt to watch.  I think the computer animation should have been limited to backgrounds and special effects and not integrated 3d characters with 2d, it just looks tacky.  There were a few pieces missing that to me were important to the story.  All I have to say is that the Xak Zaroth part is missing a very important event and is way too cut.  To make up for the unfamiliar story for non-initiates to Krynn, way more special features should have been added.  All they give is a little bit about how the animation was done.  I don't care about that, a little background about the characters would have been nice, or something pertaining to the story.  If there is a sequel, and Wizards of the Coast would be ignorant if they didn't try to fix this, it needs to have more to offer and not be so messy.",1203120000,,2207,4.471177944862156

While I found the old 80's style animation to be of good quality the over laying of obvious CGI with it created a harsh and distracting contrast.  The story is missing a few scenes that i would have liked to have seen but i can understand them being left out for the sake of not having a 3-4 hour movie.  The one scene that actually got me mad was in the caged wagon where Fizban used knock instead of fireball to escape the cell, this change had no real purpose, took away from a running joke within the book, and needlessly changed one of my favorite scenes in literature.  The story was great though a bit rushed, but what do you expect from such an excellent book.  while i have listed several gripes about the movie there were none that were so bad that they made me unable to enjoy the movie.",1203120000,,962,4.2349726775956285

When the trailer came out, I knew I was in for a world of hurt, so I prepared myself well for when I finally recieved the finished copy.
As a fan, I was still happy to see the companions together again, but was very disheartened by the poor animation quality and a few departures from characters I witnessed throughout the movie.  For example, Tas was no longer a child-like innocent ""handler"" we all love, but became some kind of cocky teenager with annoying remarks about his ego.  I brought this dvd home with me to share with my brothers who are also fans of the book, but I could not allow them to watch it with their spouses because I am sure that those who are not familiar with the original story would not understand, nor care for, the story after they see this movie.
I bought this dvd because I am a fan of the books, however, I refuse to share this movie with anyone unless they've already read the books- I fear them equating our classic fantasy novel with this cheesy animated movie.

3012270,2,B000Y7U996,"I had high expectations on this book to screen adaptation. Perhaps those high expectations were clouded by the brilliant Jackson's Tolkien adaptation or even the latest Asterix DVD release.

The Good:
The characters' ""characters and characteristics"" are in-tact, they ""look"", ""feel"" and ""sound"" as what, as best as one could expect, as the book describes.

It feels so right having Kiefer Sutherland supplying Raistlin's voice. And Lucy could do no wrong with Goldmoon. Wonder who gets Kitiara and Dalamar the Dark?

The Bad and the Ugly:
The animation is sub-standard; there was little creative progress from the Dungeons and Dragons cartoon of the 80s. The colours and tone turned up to be well below par. In times of ""darkness"", the smart use of shades and colours would have helped potray not only the moods of the characters but the surroundings as well.

Mixing the dragons/draconians CGI to animation? Nope, did not quite work. Turned out to be a sad case of using the right technology at the wrong place.

Maybe it is ""just"" for such adaptation to be in full CGI version...after all, Dragonlance is, dare I say (and in process may incur the wrath of the Tolkien loyalists), the greatest fantasy epics of all time!

I read the books 20 years ago alongside everyone else and devoured them.  As a story, Dragonlance the DVD compresses the event fairly economically and the jist of the situation gets across.  Looked upon with a straight eye, a great deal of what happens in Chronicles Volume 1 is irrelevant: the finding of Kith Kanan, the excessive encounter with the gully dwarves, etc, and this DVD rightly disposes of all that, leaving the pure meat and bones of the original story.  Perhaps too well, as I didn't realize until now how little of a story Autumn Twilight has.  Compared to the Tower of the High Clerist and the Battle of Palanthas, almost nothing of note here is significant except the death of Verminaard.  The DVD cant be blamed for that, but it can be blamed for cutting out what Autumn Twilight did have, characterization.  This DVD clocks in at 90 minutes on the nose, meaning its length was arbitrarily chosen.  A WORLD of good would have resulted by just giving another 5 minutes, spread out here and there, in character pieces to explain Sturms past, Raistlins illness and the tension with his brother, etc etc.  The story barrels along from this to that to that with no time for introspection or breathcatching, and you can watch the whole thing still wondering what the big deal was.  The breakneck pace sabotages the ending, where the Red Dragons Ember and Pyrite have their fight to the death, a poignant point in the books just dropped like a bag of potatoes here.

In fact every dragon in the world is ill-served, as despite living in a world without dragons, they are given here as ""well golly, its a dragon,"" with absolutely ZERO build up or suspense or shock and awe that the situation demands, a disaster that can only be blamed on an unimaginative director.  Onyz has zero surprise, Ember has zero characterization.  And the characters have no surprise about either one.  Unenjoyable.

All that, and we haven't even gotten to the animation yet.
What on Earth were they thinking?  This is TWENTY YEARS out of date.  The drawing is rough, the movements are sloppy, and the animation painfully old.  If BARBIE can generate a half dozen PURE CGI movies over the last 3-4 years (just ask my daughter), then it boggles the mind that Dragonlance couldn't crank out at least one.

As far as the animation i thought it was good and plenty violent enough which was also good because it ads a bit more realism to the story.

That being said, I knew logically that any production based on this work and being animated was more than likely going to suck. Well, seeing as they added Kfiefer Sutherland as Raistlin I didn't think it could be too bad, I mean the guy is doing good with 24 series, so I didn't think he was hard up to play the role - or maybe he was a big fan himself.

Well folks, wait no longer my verdict: it's bad. The story moves at a clunky, hyperactive pace. It's a major setback in getting people sold on the idea of making any of the fantasy based franchises into movies themselves. As well, the graphics went from normal animation to all dragons being CGI - CGI that looked worse than Transformers Beast Wars - a combination which lent itself to horrid on screen action.

My biggest beef with the movie was it could not decide what audience to aim at - the kiddies who want to see wizards and dragons - with shallow characters and simple plot lines and little graphic violence - or the adult fan base who wanted to see violence and epic battles.

So, on the scale of Franchise to Film adoption between Spiderman and CatWoman, I score this a ""Daredevil"". It looks like the screen writers took their basic outline of the book and popped it on screen, and made shoddy connections between major storylines in the book.

3012276,2,B000Y7U996,"While I am glad that the Dragonlance Chronicles are finally being adapted to the screen.  I am ashamed that this is what is being presented to the public.  Dragon Magazine once said of the Chronicles that at last fantasy fans have something to read after the Tolkien books.  This story has spawned dozens of ancillary novels and a roleplaying game.  I would argue that they is more well-known and more well-loved than ""The Golden Compass"" or ""Stardust"" and those got a decent theatrical treatment.  I can only hope that New Line or Walden Media take a look at the Chronicles and realize how wonderfully they could be adapted to a screen trilogy.  Barring that, maybe Joss Whedon or J.J. Abrams will turn them into a TV series (six seasons, guarranteed).

Since first reading Dragons of Autumn Twilight back in 1986, I have held a deep-felt love for the companions of the lance and their adventures in Krynn.  The Chronicles Trilogy would and should make an exciting and endearing trilogy of film adaptations.  Sadly, this animated attempt was a truely pathetic attempt to adapt the Weiss and Hickman novel.  The combination of cell and computer animation did not mix well at any level.  The draconians...oh, those horribly rendered draconians that moved like figures from a 1998 video game cinematic.  The entire thing would have been better as a cell animation piece.  However, even the quality of that was on the same level as any animated series from the early '80s.

The film makers added some very contrived elements to the story, like the gods of good and evil actually battling each other as dragon vs. warrior and the villainous Lord Verminaard having constant conversations with his evil goddess from the outset of the film so that we know that , ""Yep, he's the bad guy alright.""  By contrived I mean unnecessairly diverting from the novel.  Don't misjudge me, I fully expect a filmmaker to edit the written work to bring the story to the screen.  But, what was added was pointless.  The story line took big leaps and jumps and none of the characters were flushed out well at all.  There were ""adult"" moments where men are distracted by women's ""attributes"" and goblins, etc. are stabbed (but no blood).  Go ahead and make it PG-13, the novel was!  The entire thing felt like it was rushed together in about two weeks.

The voiceovers from such well-heeled actors as Kiefer Sutherland and Lucy Lawless are at times well-done, but at others are pathetically phoned in.  This is especially true whenever someone is speaking magic words or elven/dwarven phrases.  They suddenly slip out of the characters voice and it becomes someone ordering from a take-out menu. The end also smacks of a missionary effort to help the faithless find religion.  Again, unnecessary and badly done in the attempt.",1202601600,3,2801,4.846315789473684

I did like most of the Characterdesign of the Heroes with the exception of Raistlin. Voices its the same, all quite well only Raistlin I didn't like that well. Maybe its because Raistlin is my favorite character...
What I really didn't like was the computeranimation of Dragons and Draconians. They are to computery and kind of don't fit in the picture. I really didn't like the style of the animation of the pictures itself. This ""static movement"" animation (don't know how to discribe it better) really ruined the experience for me.
All in all the book was well transferred to the Script I'd say. One eception: Pax Tharkas and Xak Tsaroth. They just didn't do a good job transferring that one. Due to too many cut bookscenes it just gets illogical because they get into the fortress much to easy. 5 min more could have solved that problem. Same thing its with the ruined City of Xak Tsaroth.
Another baddie: Raistlin's got to much credit for solving problems and has to much ""sceentime"". This time of the books he is just at the beginning, not that allpowerful mage he gets later on and it throws off the balance between the characters wich is really one of the main things in the books for me, because they portray a real Team that is only strong because ALL its members add equally.",1202428800,,1421,4.511627906976744

One has to remember two things:
1. The film could not last much longer than 90 minutes.
2. It had to be an adaption also accesible for younger viewers.
Keeping these two things in mind will help you to enjoy the film. If you have read the novel, do not expect too much, this isn't a ""Lord of the Rings"" film adaption! It's a cartoon with a nice drawing-style. Unfortunately the draconians, which appear in the film, have been made using computer animation and these two techniques do not combine well.

I was very glad to hear that these books where going to be made into a movie.

The fight scenes is where you really know that you are watching a third rate job. The Qunesti city was just wrong. When Tanis and the companions meet with the speaker of the sun where is the tower that the speaker works in. Or that city, and the turtle farry. I have every dragonlance book ever releace and I baught this so that they keep on making more, I understand that the story going to be change a bit to fit in into a movie but they butcher it. please, please do better on the next one",1202256000,3,933,4.048648648648649
3012287,1,B000Y7U996,"As somewhat of a fan of bad movies, I bought this with the assumption it would be bad, but the hope that it would at least be entertainingly so.  I was not disappointed.

The animation is frankly horrid.  I'll get to the mix of CGI and regular animation in a bit but the standard animation looks like something poorly animated in the late 70s or early 80s.  The characters move around jerkily and make odd twitches and other unnatural looking movements.  I watched this on PS3 with HDMI connection and the picture itself was pretty bad as well.  Sometimes scenes got oddly blurry or grainy.  I often felt like I was watching a 2nd generation VHS tape.  In addition there are many other odd animation glitches and errors such as one point where Verminaard's mace appears to impale him through the stomach.

The decision to mix the CGI of the dragons and draconians and the animated regular characters, was not the best move in the world.  I didn't mind how the CGI characters moved.  The dragons don't get much airtime, but the draconians were done passably well.  They were certainly done much better than the regular animated portions but they did not mesh well with the other humanoid characters at all.

The story was fine but didn't exactly stick to the Dragonlance I know.  Ultimately it is pretty unfullfilling, however, and leaves far too many dangling plot points for my liking.  I assume this was made with a sequel in mind but it felt like there was very little resolution of the plot.

The voice acting was the best part of the movie.  It was done pretty well and includes some big names.  The dialogue varied but was adequate for the task.

The characters were a mixed bag.  While it's a fairly large cast as adventuring parties go you get very little information on several of the characters.

On the whole I have to rate this 1 star.  The animation is bad enough that it has to be seen to be believed and the meshing of CGI and animated characters is too too much to get past.  The story and dialogue are merely adequate and can't save the horrorshow of the animation.

While I can't recommend this movie in the least if you are looking for quality, if you are a fan of bad movies like me you will find endless amusement in Dragonlance:  Dragons of Autumn Twilight.  I laughed through most of it.  Final rating:  1 of 5 stars rating, 4 of 5 if you like bad movies.",1202256000,8,2378,4.480186480186481

The animation was abysmal.  Animated movies from the 70's played smoother then this movie.  I can't recall the last time I saw such jerky animation direct from a dvd.  I would compare it to watching a streaming video online over a poor connection.  The charactors were all poorly drawn.  The cgi draconians and dragons didn't blend well with the other animation.  It looked rushed and lazy in all aspects.

I found the voice acting generic and uninspired through most of the movie.  As much as I like some of the bigger names in this movie, it seems as though they put as much effort into their acting as they did to cashing their cheques.

There is nothing redeeming about this movie.  Anything brought into the movie by the soundtrack is destroyed by the other aspects.

I would be embarassed to be associated with this attempt at a movie in any way.  I honestly can't believe the authors would look at the final cut and say ""way to go! let's sell this to the fans that love our books"".  With the popularity of fantasy in mainstream movies right now, I can't believe they would put such a poor effort out the door.

The animation style of this movie is depressing to say the least (try to remember the original hobbit movie, good for the 70's, but terrible by today's standards).  Add to that a very strange and seemingly random assortment of CG effects (again, something you would expect to see out of a low budget 90's movie or a home made film).

Visuals aside, the voice acting seemed to leave a lot to be desired.  While some of the beloved lines of the original books were included, the manner in which the voices were done simply failed to carry the feel of the original story.  Between the simplistic narration to Tas' lack of curiosity I could barely stand to listen to the movie.

Finally, while I understand that some changes to the story were guaranteed, I was so disappointed to see so many pointless changes (not for the sake of time or quality, for whatever reason the screen writers just wanted to throw in their own flair).

I feel that while any Dragonlance fan should watch this movie, don't spend any money doing so or you will be greatly disappointed.  Find a friend who bought it without reading the reviews or get it on netflix where you won't mind getting one movie that you could barely sit through.",1202083200,6,1383,4.392156862745098
3012292,3,B000Y7U996,"I was so excited about this coming out after being a fan of the books for over 15 years. There was a lot of grumbling about it being an animated movie on the Dragonlance boards, but I decided to hold judgement until I saw the film for myself.

The movie starts off fine enough. I actually like 80s-style animation (this is reminiscent of the old Dungeons & Dragons cartoons or the old G.I. Joe cartoon). What I didn't like was the CGI animation that was used for the dragons and draconians. It could have been a cool effect, but the CGI looked like the CGI that was being put out 10 years ago. It looked cheap and it was very distracting.

The pace of the film was distracting, too. What started out as following the book rather closely rapidly picked up pace and skipped over major parts. I know that a book cannot be translated word for word to a movie, but a lot if character exposition and plot exposition were ""glossed over"". Having read the books, I could kind of keep up, my wife was lost, however.

It's worth getting if you're a fan and want to have it all. I'd rent t if you're not a collector. If you haven't read the books... I might just skip it. Unfortunately, this is another case of the studios ""cheap-ing"" out on D&D themed movies.",1201996800,,1248,4.3247863247863245
3012293,3,B000Y7U996,"Like most people that wrote reviews here, I grew up on Dragonlance and over the past twenty years or so, have read the first six books about a dozen times.  I have always wondered why Dragonlance was never adapted for the screen, because it seemed like the perfect kind of heroic/fantasy story that would make a great movie.

And it does.

The 400 page book has been nicely trimmed into a 90 minute movie.  Most plot points are retained, although I did miss the subplot of ""Tas and the wicker dragon"" which I think would have been hilarious on screen.  But that's a minor gripe.  The characters' personalities are all true to form.  Voice acting sounds great in general and fitting for the characters.

The problem with the movie is not the story, nor the voice acting, nor the musical score - which is also pretty moving and nicely orchestrated.  The issue is the animation.

The animation is really bad.  The 2d look is acceptable to a certain extent.  It looks very early 80s in the Filmation/He-Man style.  Not fabulous, just look at what animation is doing right now especially in terms of Japanese animation (the beauty and slickness of projects such as Witchblade, Haruhi, etc).  But if they had stuck with that (and only that) I believe the movie would have been better recieved.  Instead, they decided to mix CGI into the 2d realms and it looks TERRIBLE.  Disjointed and just generally poorly animated with jerky/choppy movements and blurry textures.  This is stuff you would expect to see on a very early 90s PC game.  One of the worst parts was the shots of the draconian armies.  It was the same monster cut and pasted a few hundred times looping the same animation.  They didn't even bother to pallete switch a few of them.  For shame!

And the video quality is horrible.  This is one of the worst looking DVDs I own, like someone smeared the screen with grease, a blurry mess to put it bluntly.

So overall, the movie adapation of the first Dragonlance book DOES capture the mood, setting, story and overall feel of the Dragonlance world in its infancy.  However, the animation is a serious drawback that will keep the movie out of the hands of many people, simply because its laughable.  And that's a shame when everything else seems to go together just right.

Except the character designs for the elves.  For a race that's supposed to be mindblowingly beautiful, these guys were just gaunt, pointy, and downright ugly.
Terrible character designs people!

I hope for a Dragons of Winter Night but with a serious rethinking of the animation strategy.  I know its low budget, but c'mon.  People doing flash animation could have done better.",1201996800,2,2654,4.7043478260869565

3012295,3,B000Y7U996,"Dragons of Autumn Twilight is an animated film based on the bestselling roleplaying fiction epic by Weis and Hickman. The film follows the heroes of the lance from their earliest incarnation as low level characters battling against the oppressive dragon armies of the queen of darkness.

Although I hadn't read a Dragonlance novel in years, I picked this film up for old times sake. Let me preface this by saying I didn't expect much from a direct to video release. I found the opening credits pretty cheesy. I did like the character design- the heroes look pretty much the same as they looked on the covers drawn by Elmore with the exception of Laurana (who looks nothing like her original incarnation) and her brother Gilthanas whose features are a bit too lined. I appreciated the level of detail which went into making Sturm look like the stuffy knight he was and to bring out the handsomeness of Caramon and Goldmoon's turquoise earrings. Unfortunately, the low frame rate of the animation, the jerky movement of the characters and yes, the awful CGI rendered the intricacy of the character design a moot point.

The plot was fairly involved, and yes there were some adult elements. (Caramon ogles Tika), people die, there is blood, monsters kill humans and each others etc. This is not a film for the small kiddies, although I suspect they would probably enjoy it.

There were some animation blunders as well. For instance Laurana is shown in different scenes with and without her armor, the Highlord's mace is shown moving through his own body etc. Overall if they had animated the Draconians and the dragons normally and spent a bit more time upping the frame rate of the animation, I'd probably give it a higher rating. It was still watchable, but the CGI and poor quality animation made it look cheap instead of the cult classic it should've been.

Because if you're willing to stop being Comic Book Guy for a minute and just relax, you'll realize that the movie had solid voice acting, accurately captured the feel of the Dragonlance universe, and followed the book pretty closely.

I invited some friends of mine, who like me are long time Dragonlance fans and D&D players, to watch the movie after I told them it wasn't so bad.  Guess what: they liked it, too.  We laughed at Tas, thought Raistlin was a jerk (but an interesting jerk), and responded to the movie pretty much like we did to the books.  In fact, all of us remarked that the movie made us want to read the series all over again.

The first half of the movie is admittedly weaker than the second half, but that's true of the book as well.  This is because the plot for the first section of the book was provided literally from the D&D role-playing sessions of the authors.  Thankfully they abandoned that method after a certain point, and from then on the book (and movie) dramatically improves in quality.

The movie ends with hints of a future installment, which would be the second part of the trilogy ""Dragons of Winter Night""; but at this point I haven't seen anything on the Internet or otherwise as to whether a sequel will actually be made.  I hope it is, because this movie--the reviews here aside--was an enjoyable start for me and my friends.  It is also the realization of a dream that Dragonlance lovers have had since they first read these books in the 1980s (or in my case, the 1990s): to see these beloved characters finally make it to the screen.

3012305,1,B000Y7U996,"This movie is awful. Quite simply, awful.

In the mid 1980's I read the original trilogy (Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Winter Night, and Spring Dawning) as a young teenager. I have re-read the entire trilogy, on average, about once every 2 years since then. So... Imagine my enthusiasm when, about a year ago, I found out a movie was going to be made from the novels! Last summer - when the release date was set for ""Winter 2007/2008"" I was psyched! However, the movie was released straight to DVD - and that should've been my first warning right then.

The characters aren't developed well from the start and everything seems far too rushed. Though there are shadows of dialog from the books transfered to the script - which, at times, seemed cute - bug it wasn't enough to balance the horrible spoken word/acting. Did the actors even understand their characters before jumping into a dialog session? Or were they only interested in cashing a quick paycheck. I think the latter.

I rushed out to pick up a copy at 10am when the stores opened, came home, and from the onset - that amazingly bad opening - sat there mouth agape in disgust. How could this be done to a beloved series of books that tons of fans have enjoyed over the past 20+ years? Heres my suggestion (and, apparently, more than a few other peoples, as well): PURCHASE THE BOOKS INSTEAD!

It's apparent, in our current society, that people quite simply don't make time to read. Otherwise, no one would have responded with a favorable review of this movie. I'd wager a bet those people with ""high praise"" for this movie/DVD never read a single page of the novels. Yes, book-to-script adaptations are often difficult - but when done well (i.e., ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, by Walsh, Boyens, and Jackson) it can be enthralling, exciting, and (take note Hollywood producers and studios!) actually make money! This DVD never will.

Let's hope this version of the Dragonlance story falls off the cliff and is never heard from again. What a waste to be waiting for this release for nearly two years and to have it arrive with such poor results. I pray that Dragons of Winter Night and Spring Dawning are never considered for the same fate as this version of ""Autumn Twilight.""",1201478400,7,2239,4.6725888324873095
3012306,1,B000Y7U996,"I honestly don't know where to start. The most important thing to get from this review is please do not buy this DVD. It's a horrible attempt to milk dragonlance fans out of yet more money.

To start off the production value of the movie is something I would equate with highschool art students taking on an animated movie. The animation style is dated, and really poorly drawn and executed. To give an example of how bad this is, they pan and scan certain shots to save on animation costs. Watching a zoom and pan of an animated frame is horrendous.

The voice acting is also awful. There's some good names and rarely they show that they do have talent, however for most of the movie as you listen to the voices, you have to wonder if they were only given one shot to do each scene. Most of the voice acting falls very flat and is totally painful to listen to.

The other major problem is the CGI work. It's awful. There's no other way to put it. First off it's not at the same frame rate as the regular animation, so the CGI elements look totally out of place. Secondly, they're just not that well done. Most of the CGI monsters look like toys and are very stiffly animated. It's just poor work.

If you are a real Dragonlance fan, please don't buy this movie. Don't give Paramount and WotC reason to further butcher what is a spectacular  series of books.",1201392000,9,1358,4.351778656126482

3012308,5,B000Y7U996,"As most all who have purchased this video, I am a longtime fan of the Dragonlance books.  I started reading them in the late 80's and never stopped. I am also an avid fantasy/sci fi and animation fanatic so this project appealed to me on many levels.  There are a lot of people who really missed the whole point of this project and sadly gave it negative reviews.  This project was never meant to be a motion picture quality project.  It was made for us fans.  It was done on a budget that would allow it a chance to convince the studios that another one should be made.  The purpose was to bring action to a beloved story in a way that was faithful to the book.  Did it do this?  YES!  The animation was on par with a typical Saturday morning cartoon and probably a notch better.  The story adaptation was admittedly choppy but who is going to buy this video that has not already read the book?  I thought they did an excellent job of picking the key points in the book to focus on.  Remember it took Peter Jackson over 3 hours to try and recreate each book of the LOTR and he needed to deviate from the book to do it.  This is only a 90 minute undertaking of a book that is actually longer than Tolkien's and it does not deviate at all from the book.  As for the characters I have to strongly disagree with those who found the voice actors lacking.  Perhaps you need to re-read the books again but this crew did a great job recreating the mood of the original books.  Perhaps that is why I enjoyed the movie so much.  It allowed me to visit Krynn as I had imagined it and I was not disappointed.  I thank all those involved in the project and I hope there will be many more.  At the end of the day I ask myself was I entertained.  The answer is a resounding YES.",1201305600,8,1764,4.132352941176471
3012309,3,B000Y7U996,"Like so many other reviewers, I basically grew up with Dragonlance.  When I think of Fantasy, Dungeons and Dragons, etc., I think of Dragonlance first and foremost.

I received the DVD as a gift from my brother, who's also a huge Dragonlance fan, for Christmas.  Knowing it was only an hour and a half, I tempered my expectations.

The Good:

It's fun seeing the characters and places that fans like myself grew up with come to life.  Sure it's not live action, but it put a smile to my face the first time I 'saw' Solace in this manner.

The Bad:

The animation looks a bit off as somethings are CGI while others appear hand drawn.  It didn't bother me that much, but it did seem off.  The main problem, as expected, is that the story is VERY rushed.  However, that was expected given the length.  In a 3 hour movie it would be hard to keep the same story and character depth that the books have.  I think my biggest disappointment was the lack of depth in the characters.  They certainly try, but given the rushed nature of the film, it really isn't possible.

I'm glad that Tracey Hickman wrote a review, and I really liked what he said about this being a first step.  Let's hope so!

In summary, if you are a huge fan of Dragonlance and aren't the type that will nitpick about every little change, get it, enjoy it for what it is, then go back and read the novels again!",1201305600,2,1374,4.3046875
3012310,2,B000Y7U996,"The traditional 2D animated style is very acceptable. The 3D animated portions of the film are distracting, and don't bode well for this film at all.

The adaptation seemed rushed, and too many major confrontations were completely altered from the original storyline. Too much time spent on Tanis' annoying lack of faith. Also too much time was spent beating us to death with the fact that Goldmoon can heal.

If you're a mature fan of the chronicles, then stay away from this film.",1201305600,5,482,4.795180722891566
3012311,2,B000Y7U996,"As a fan of the Dragonlance novels for over two decades, I was delighted to see that the books were being made into a film series. This DVD simply fails to live up to an excellent story. Too much plot is jammed into too short a time frame. The tale simply can not be told in an hour and a half. While the movie is faithful to some of the characters (Tanis and Flint), others (namely Sturm and Caramon) are simply ignored. A number of the main themes (such as the tensions between the twins) and plot points (like what happens to Riverwind when Onyx comes out of the well) are also downplayed. Inconsistent animation does not make up for an excellent cast of voices and a solid score. The DVD also lacks any types of features. The movie's PG13 rating seems fair especially with a suprising bit of gore and a small scene with Caramon staring at a nubile Tika which had no point and even less humor. The direction also does not seem to help the film with way too many close ups of faces and it's amazing how many capes and cloaks seem to flow in the breeze at dramatic moments. And why do all the characters speak so fast? A hurried dialogue only make a rushed plot go by even quicker. The movie also annoys by fading to black between scenes. This leaves the impression of a bad made for tv movie which is about the best one can say for this unsatisfying DVD. This would have been better on the USA cartoon express around 1989; not in your DVD collection in 2008.",1201219200,3,1460,4.274368231046932

In fact a lot of the movie was like a refresher course for me because I did not remember the different beats to the plot.  As others have said, the animation is not fantastic, but I will say it is light years better then anything we had in the States here in the 80's.  Just the fact that they were able to get such great actors to play the characters from the books and get a movie made out of it was a huge step for me.  It's not as bad as some make it out, but it's not that great either.  Definitely worth checking out.  I rented it, and liked it.",1201219200,,659,3.9545454545454546
3012313,1,B000Y7U996,"Wow. This was so bad, I don't even know where to begin. Looks like everyone responsible for the project just broke up into groups, did their thing and nobody was 'directing' it or making sure everyone was on the same page. A page. Any page. Good grief. The CGI is BRUTAL and looks way worse than you could possibly imagine when mixed with traditional 2D animation. If you thought that Malebolgia looked terrible in the 1997 'Spawn' movie, then you're really going to want to break something when you see what the student project people came up with here. And the 2D animation is some of the worst seen since The Mighty Hercules and it's ancient ilk. The two of them together is nothing short of an unholy union.

I've waited for this for over 20 years and now I just want to throw up. This does to my memories of Dragonlance what George Lucas did to my memories of Star Wars with his prequel trilogy.

I hope that whoever is responsible for this gets blackballed from EVER working in animation, TV or movies for the rest of their natural life. It's an abomination. And Dragonlance deserves SO much better than this. As do the fans expected to shell out their hard-earned steel coins.",1201219200,6,1183,4.5233644859813085

The good points
The score is satisfactory
Raistlins voice is believeable
The opening shots of Tika are amusing (were they meant to be?)

The bad points
Most vocals were fairly poor
The whole film is rushed
I didn't feel at the end I really cared for the characters (there wasn't time)
The animation is dreadful....I could go on but I can't bring myself to....

This cartoon should not have been made. The principal of either do it well or don't do it at all was clearly not used here.

Hickman and Weis had a story that was at least as good as LOR (I prefered DL) - unfortunately what we are left with here is, well rubbish.

Remember Britney when she danced about in the school and said 'baby hit me one more time'? She had the talent, the looks, the ability, the sex appeal and the promise of a rising star - now she's in the 7th level of hell. The parallel I hope is obvious.

3012317,2,B000Y7U996,"I grew up in the late 80's and early 90's on Dragonlance.  These were the first novels I was really ""into"", and to this day I reread ""Chronicles"" and ""Legends"" about once a year.  So I've been following this movie and awaiting its release with great anticipation.

Unfortunately, when I watched it, I was highly disappointed.  My kids liked it, because that's what this basically is - a Saturday morning cartoon, like you would see on Boomerang!  The 2D animation was straight out of the 80's; I own the original D&D series on DVD, and this looked exactly the same.  The CGI animation wasn't well done, and blended horribly with the 2D.

The voice-casting was a mixed-bag as well.  Some - Raistlin, Riverwind, and Goldmoon - were well-done.  Others, such as Tanis and Sturm, were not.  It's not that I think the individuals are bad actors, I just couldn't help but picture Flash every time Tanis spoke.

The storyline was basically true to the book, for which I was grateful.  However, with only 90 minutes to work with, major pieces of the story were trivialized, or ignored altogether.  The movie definitely felt rushed, again like a Saturday morning cartoon.  They also added some extra stuff into the story, I guess to be more dramatic or something.

In short, if you are a fan of the books I would still consider seeing this movie.  I'm certainly hoping that, like the original version of The Hobbit, that this is more a way to introduce a great story to kids.  Maybe in twenty years we can get a movie that does this story justice.",1201219200,3,1537,4.612546125461255
3012318,3,B000Y7U996,"To be honest this movie was not as good as I was hoping it would be.  On the other hand, it IS a Dragonlance movie.  I have been a huge fan of the book series since the late 80's.  In fact it is one of the few series that I have to reread every couple of years because they are so enjoyable.  That said, this movie adaptation certainly has its flaws.  The animation is a bit sub-par and why they blended in CGI dragons and draconians I will never understand.  Every scene that combined the two looked odd and took me out of the story.  They should have done it all one way or the other.  I also have to agree with one of the authors, Tracy Hickman, that this was too much story for a 90 minute movie.  Too many good story elements had to be modified or jettisoned all together to fit the running time.  I was SOOO hoping for Tas in the wicker dragon!

So what's good about this movie?  Well for one thing, despite the material that was left out, it does get certain beats from the novel right.  I thought Tasslehoff as a character was pretty close to his novel incarnation and provided some well-placed humor.  Raistlin also made the transition from book to film mostly intact.  The final note about this movie that I have to make is to agree with Tracy Hickman in an earlier review that while certainly not perfect, this is a decent first step.  We live in an age where all fantasy films are placed against the model of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Personally I would love to see the Chronicles get the same multi-picture treatment that Rings got, and to do that some smaller steps like this need to take place.  So in light of that I was glad buy this movie just to show support for the story and hope that in the near future it will be done justice.  I hope all the other Dragonlance fans are with me.",1201132800,,1819,4.220289855072464
3012319,3,B000Y7U996,"I've been a huge DragonLance fan from the beginning, and I was hoping for so much more than this movie gave me.
The combination of 3D and 2D characters fighting hand to hand looks bad.
The dialogue is very very brief and basic, hardly any character depth.  I've read the books so many times I know the characters thoroughly, but if someone who has never read the books watched this movie, I doubt they would be impressed by the flat character portrayal.
Don't get me wrong, I love the DragonLance series, I own most of the books written, over 150, this movie is just another addition to the collection, and I sincerely hope they complete the trilogy in movie form even if it is animated.  I just hope and pray they do a much better job.
This movie is like a poorly animated ""Cliffs Notes"" version of a fantastic book.",1201132800,,817,4.44
3012320,3,B000Y7U996,"Hiya, as a long time fan of the works of Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weiss I was excited when I saw ""Dragons of Autumn Twilight"" on the racks at my local Walmart.  Upon arriving home and situating myself in front of the screen to watch the DVD the first thing I noted was the already mentioned 1980's grade animation quality.  Willing to make allowances for having a film ""made on the cheap"" I sat back and let the film play out in front of me.

First I will list what I liked - the plot stayed fairly close to the book I read and re-read until the cover was ragged.  The voice actor selections for Raistlin and Goldmoon were well matched and appropriate.  The dialog was competently delivered by the rest of voice acting crew, though none of the rest stood out as exceptional.

Next I will note what I found lacking or in need of improvement from my personal taste, but first I will note one of my personal biases, I'm a Anime fan.  Effectively that means I prefer modern feature film style animation releases to keep up with modern animation technology.
 - I agree that the use of traditional cell shaded animation gives it a nostalgic 1980's feel, but the setting isn't the 1980's America, it's the fantasy world of Krynn.
- All of the animated fight scenes would have been well served to have been scripted by a professional fight choreographer instead of just produced by a standard animation director.  In the Dragons of Autumn Twilight film the fights were depicted in a dull and lackluster manner, which caused a loss of dramatic tension.  I will reference the anime ""Naruto"" as a good example of relatively bloodless, yet interesting and dramatic fight choreography.
- Most of the scene transitions were stilted and awkward, someone with some serious cinematography skills was needed to make the scene transitions both graceful and fitting. Additionally a quality cinematographer would have made all of the scenes themselves better with a more consistent and appropriate selection of camera angles.
- Most of the background elements were flat and static.  Even the modern remakes of ""Scooby Doo"" add some interactive background elements from time to time.  A cell shaded but 3D environment would have looked a whole lot better, at not that great an increase in production costs.
- The addition of relatively low quality CGI mixed with the animation was frankly jarring and miss-matched.  In fact a cell shaded CGI approach as is used in the ""Naruto"" series (check out the anime on Cartoon Network) may have well been a much better approach for the whole animation.  It certainly would have added a continuity to the visual aspects of the work.
- Careful pacing of the plot by appropriately balancing the visual tempo for dialog, character development, and action.  This is mainly done at the editing stage in traditional film, but has to be seriously considered up front when doing animation.
- The visual character design was a bit old school and once again could stand to be punched up.  At least Ralph Bakshi's ""The Lord of the Rings"" seemed to get the character designs pretty close to how people viewed Tolkien's works.  I'm not recommending Japanese anime style character design, but more accurately designed characters would have been refreshing.  Ultimately, the closer the animators could have replicated the look and feel of Dragonlance that was originally established by the great Larry Elmore, Keith Parkinson, Clyde Caldwell, and others the better it would of been. Frankly, a world animated in an exact replication their style would have been so right it would have hurt from the spasms of visual ecstacy.
- I realize the books ""skipped"" some of the action moments that were presented in the Dragonlance game modules to allow for some surprises for the game players.  Being that the modules are mostly out of circulation, and that film media is primarily visual this could have been an excellent opportunity to reincorporate some of the ""skipped"" action scenes.
- The score was nice, and fairly pretty, but it mainly served to fill the background, and I think it failed to be appropriately evocative of the desired moods as the story progressed.  Mark Isham and Danny Elfman may not be in everyone's budget, but people who do movie scoring would do well to study their use of music to enhance the mood, as opposed to music used for background.
- As far as my overall views on animation quality, Hana Barbara and others at that level may be fine for kids, but Studio Ghibli is the benchmark for modern feature length cell animation.  Check out Hayao Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" and ""Howl's Moving Castle"" to understand what I'm talking about.  When doing a feature length release, its much better to shoot for Studio Ghibli than to settle for Hana Barbara.
- If a Studio Ghibli level production is outside of your budget, check out what even small scale animators like Blind Ferret Entertainment are accomplishing.

So to summarize the following areas needed improvement - modern animation techniques, quality cinematography, professional fight choreography, better story pacing, character design closer to the works of the original Dragonlance artists, re-incorporate some ""lost"" action material, consistent animation style, an evocative score, and aim for a Ghibli level production.

Those outside the fan base may have a hard time relating to this DVD, however, fans should still come away with a visual of the story, which until now was only an audio book or the book itself. Although the 3D animation does not work with the mix and should have been left out, the 2D is fine. I find it similar to the Dungeons & Dragons cartoons of the 1980s, which I'm also a big fan of.

They totally left out the growing relationship between Tanis and Riverwind, Raistlin and Bupu.  The whole movie felt rushed.

Voice Acting - You have some great voice actors in this, but they lack any range and emotion.  Raistlin is just a monotone Sutherland.  Tanis played by Rosenbaum has nothing to it, he has more emotion and depth in his voice acting of the protagonist in the upcoming Dark Sector game.

Artwork - Like others have said, this is pulled straight from the late 70s to early 80s saturday morning cartoons.  The framerate is horrific, worse than current-day flash cartoons found on the Web.  Colors are either bright and colorful, or dark and grey or brown.  Emotions and body languages portrayed are juvenile, to say the least.

CGI - Just doesn't work in this regard.  The dragons and draconians done in this manner are very poor quality renderings compared to the quality common today, let alone five years ago.  Symetry in body composition was way off.  It would have looked a lot better if it had all stayed hand-drawn rather than using any CGI.

Story - The one thing this should have been perfected since it was already written and would have saved us from the voice acting and the artwork/cgi was the weakest part of the whole movie.  Not only did it stray far from the storyline in many respects, it was rushed headlong through everything and focused way too much on the weakest elements of the original story without capturing the dark and forboding future of the people.  At no time did I feel any emotion for any character or their situations.

Do not buy this unless you are an avid DragonLance fan.  Even then, I'd honestly suggest renting it and never owning it so that it would remind you of what is rather than what could have been.",1201046400,15,1690,4.583333333333333

If you are not going to do it right, just don't do it at all.  I am not sure if the lead animator was somebody's cousin or something but the animation does not even pass today's cartoon network lack luster standards.

The voice acting was good, but the dialog was horrible.  Where I am not a huge D&D geek I do enjoy the rich world that this franchise has to potently offer to other mediums. It is a shame to see it keep falling victim to the B movie assault it has had to endure time and time again.

 I love DragonLance, this picture is not all of the books that I have read but all of the books that I still have. I must say that I kind of like the movie. I will end up owning it because it is one of those types of movies that will grow on you over time. I would recommend renting it first just because there are some problems with the animation and for some of you out there that is a deal breaker in owning a movie. I did find the movie fun to watch they really hit some of the main points that I was looking for in this and that is how are the dragons, Draconians and how did they do with Rastlin all of which they nailed. As far as how it compared to the books... well read the books, also by the way if you are a fan of the book then before you watch this film I should warn you they stick to the main plot and that is it.

It was fun and campy: they did a great job at capturing the table top roleplaying feel epically with the jiggling boobies and focus on Kittera's trunk junk which for you table top players know that has come up during a gamming session.
The Voice Talent was very well done
Cool Dragons: they looked good and represented well, in other words the red dragons breathed fire and the black dragon spit acid!
cool Draconians: they looked nice and when slain they turned to stone trapping some weapons in them when they changed
Rastlin was well done: his golden hourglass eyes looked cool and they did a nice job portraying him as a haunted person with a dark cloud over him. They did not portray him as an evil character which he is not and I was very pleased to see.
Concerns / Dislikes

Animation that was 20 years too late: The animation style was western but lacked all of the lesions and techniques learned over the last 20 years. It was jarring and looked terrible.
The show felt hollow: They rushed, and missed a lot of notes that exist within the story that would not have taken any time to put into the movie so that I feel that if I had not had all of my previous exposure to the Dragonlance setting I may have had a harder time following the story or found it very one dimensional.
The fight scenes looked weak: they were terribly animated and in many instances I found myself thinking 'hey he is off balance wouldn't he just fall over'
Lacked good tension and conflict: I got bored at several points throughout the film which is very sad considering how much I love the setting, story, and characters.
Many of the characters came across as flat and lacking depth: take for instance Tanis all the film tells you about him is that he is 1/2 Elven and lacks faith, that is it. Many of the characters had that problem that they were just there, once again I was able to just fill in all of the missing information because of my familiarity but a film should not require that background knowledge.
This is the animated tale based on the first book in the DragonLance Series, Dragons of Autumn Twilight, by Margaret Weis. The courageous heroes, Tanis, Flint, Tasslehoff, Rastlin, Caramon, and Sturm are meeting in solace as they have pledged years earlier. They are discussing the goblin encounters that they met on their way into Solace when trouble is stirred up. It turns out that the Dark queen Takhisis has risen and with her cleric Verminaard are hunting for the missing staff of light. During the confrontation a man is accidentally knocked into the fire and set alight. That is when we get to meet two new characters the cleric of light Goldmoon and her companion Riverwind. She heals the man with her staff and they all have to flee from the goblins that are attracted to the scene.  For more reviews go to projectshadow.com",1201046400,,3806,4.363507779349363

I was a little uncomfortable having to explain to my wife that there is not that much cleavage in the book, and a little disturbed when Tika bounces her chest around.

3012329,2,B000Y7U996,"There are many things that may contribute to the entertainment value of a movie, but I'm afraid that in this case it is all the wrong things. I found myself chuckling more often than not at the unmoving people in the background, the jiggling Tika, and the forced dialogue than at the parts where I was supposed to laugh.

I completely understand the need to accelerate the action of a story to accomodate a 90 minute timeframe, but it is much more difficult to accept when the animation is that choppy, the CGI is that bad (and it's bad), and the voice acting just doesn't connect with the characters.

Dragonlance is a great series because it is well conceptualized, and well written. Hopefully if a sequel is attempted it will hit closer to the mark.",1200960000,,752,4.562962962962963

I was happy when I finally seen that they made an animation of the movie. But to my surprise the way they made such a lousy movie for such a great set of books. They used CG (Computer graphics with 80's style animation. You would think this day an age of computers that they could have done better. If anything, it is worth watching just to see the story as the book was written and you could follow the movie. I only rented it so no loss.

The biggest problem I had with this movie was the CGI for the dragons and draconians. The CGI was poor and the film would have been better served if they had been drawn as well.

3012334,1,B000Y7U996,"I pre-ordered this the day they threw it up on amazon. Just a few words remind me of what I have watched. ""HOT IRON POKER TO THE EYES"" I was thoroughly disappointed in this movie. Having waited in intense anticipation for this and to be kicked in the face after watching it is just sad. I did not mind it being a cartoon but the cgi blended with the cartoon was terrible and I am hoping and praying to the gods of Krynn that this was just a ""pre-test release"" and not the real deal. There were so many things in this DVD that differ from the story that I could write a 300 page novel on it. One in particular that is stuck in my head and was my favorite part in the book (Big mage lover) is the part where Fizban launches a fireball while they are in the wagon cage to blast open the lock. Well guess what! In the movie he uses ""knock"". That is just one of the many changes done to the story to just totally mess it up from the book. Me personally I would have rather had a 3 1/2 Peter Jackson directed movie version of it. I have enough popcorn and soda to last through the whole movie. If you are going to buy this be prepared to be disappointed. I pray that the great actors who did the voice-overs have the sense to not put this movie on their resumes. Sorry I guess I could not keep it short.",1200960000,4,1297,4.011583011583012
3012335,3,B000Y7U996,"Well just got done watching it and loved it. As any movie there was things I loved and things I would have done different. But being a true fan that I am, I was like a little kid while watching it and keep a open mind vs. all the reviews.

First the cons,
There was some parts of the books that I would have liked to see added. But I understood the budget and the time window of the film. This leaves something for the viewer of the movie, can you guess what it is? Read the books, 8 out of 10 times the book to a movie is better. Except when you got +100 mill budget and the eye candy is just unreal. Now some parts where a little choppy and when they meet the Foremaster it seemed a little blurry. Again not big issues, I seen first films to a trilogy not up to par and come around in the next film. Big thing that caught my eye was the draconians. They seem to fit in with the 2D only in a few scenes, I think they should have been done in 2D to make those parts not so awkward. Last con is the DVD should have had some more features, scene selection, behind the scenes and maybe a interview with WM&TH.

Thats it!

Now the Pros,
I liked the voices of all the cast, hope they all return if we get DoWN. Tanis was well done, you looked upon him as a leader, mission accomplished. Tas was done well too, I almost started singing with him when he went to go scout ahead into the fog. I am not a Kender fan. Some of the backgrounds where great, many scenes I could call out to myself and know where they where at. Very well done. Now the plus in 3D, I loved the dragons, matched Larry's dragons to a T. They flowed great for the most part, but added to the movie for me. <Dragon fan> Now if this was a action film like LotR, then I would want to see more of a life like dragons. But this was fine. Plus seeing WM&TH in the Last Inn was a kick for a DL fan. The music set the mood and was not over powering.

All and all, this is a great movie for the resources it had. It told the story in a manner that my kids could watch. If it was a full length LotR style, I would want to see the darker side of the Dragonamies, gore and other things that my kids would have to wait to watch. But it is a animation and is set so a wide age range can view. Much like the animated Hobbit and so forth. I remember as a kid watching them and thought the world of them. Now that I am older they do not have the same magic they once did. But, you think Peter Jackson watch those as a kid? I would bet he did....

Glad I got it and now my kids want to see more of Krynn's dragons.",1200873600,2,2560,3.859315589353612
3012336,4,B000Y7U996,Ok... so they changed a little but overall close to the story... great job with voices!  It isn't the live action movie that I always hoped for but now my kids will enjoy DragonLance too!,1200873600,2,187,4.3428571428571425
3012337,3,B000Y7U996,"My family watched it with me this weekend. I was the only one who read the books; my son (14) and wife have not, but all are fans of Dungeons and Dragons. So we have 2 viewpoints and I will try to cover them both.

Mine. As one of my top 5 favorite series of books it falls short. The animation was far from smooth. Too many small details (which would not have taken much to put in) were missing. Fizban? Do not get me started I was not happy with his portrayal.  I'm sure a lot of this has to do with the 90min run time trying to cover a fairly long novel. The cut corners are forgivable (other reviews cover this), but disappointing. I definitely want to see Dragons of Winter Night, and a significant improvement. Music score was very good, voice acting was also pretty good.  Overall a 3 of 5 rating. Now I know why they didn't try to take this to the theaters even for a limited release though.  The relatively low cost of the DVD helps. However, I would've gladly embraced having to buy (2) 90min movies (or pay more for a 3hr movie) to cover the first book and all its story and details, then the common mistake of cramming a full novel into 90min.

Wife and Son. They forgave the relatively below par animation in lieu of the story. It was still fun and easy to follow, they enjoyed it a lot. The brief emphasis on Tika's assets in the tavern gave us all more of a chuckle than anything.  They did get the feeling there should have been more, it jumped a bit and left the feeling like there are missing scenes. The fight scenes, which couldn't decide whether they were tame or violent, was bothersome but again actually easy to ignore. Overall they enjoyed it and gave it a 4 of 5.  Honestly, if I detach myself from the book, then Im more in agreement with the rest of the family.

I understand this is a ""start"" and I appreciate Tracy Hickmans personal review greatly.  That being said... to me this is not just about this movie, or even just this series. I am a fan of many D&D authors and properties, I fear a failure here could once again set back legitimate attempts to make more movies of this and other D&D properties (remember a certain D&D live action movie several years ago?).  I know other fans feel the same way and should also speak out, if so.  Please make the next one but make it better.",1200873600,2,2313,4.257990867579909
3012338,3,B000Y7U996,"It is a first step, and I'm glad someone attempted it. However, the result, is less than pleasing. To comment on this, I'll visit graphical appearance, music / sound, voice acting, story, and an over all cap. *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS FOR THOSE THAT HAVE NOT READ THE STORY*

The animation is way below par with other similar products. It's like watching a cartoon from the 1980's. Where as it could have been a very interesting approach to it, they further boggle this by adding in another animation style over top of the one that most of it is done in (CGI?). Then there's also the fact that they didn't put enough variation into certain things. The fireball animation, for example, is pretty much the same. And poor each time. Personally, I would have preferred real actors over animation, but I thought the animation approach would work out just as well. In the end, it really doesn't.

The music is fairly well done, I believe. The music fits the scenes, it sounds pleasing, and did not distract from what was going on at the time. There are times I would not have put it in where they did, or done what they did with it, but I never found myself thinking ""This music is horrible. Who did this?""

There's not much to doubt, the voice talent was definitely there. With people such as Lucy Lawless, Keifer Sutherland, and Micheal Rosenbaum, you can hardly go wrong. Sutherland does Raistlin quite well, as does Lawless for Goldmoon. Tika and Caramon are done well too. Over all, I had no complaints here.

As for the story (the reason most would be watching this), it hits the basics of the book, for the most part. However, there is never much explanation of things that really need the explanation. It starts off well, with a very basic history for those that may not have read the books. It starts off alright, though the scene where Tasslehoff shows up leaves some to wonder about, the movie does need to move along and not piddle around in things too trivial. Some is skipped in parts of the story, such as Xak Tsaroth. Once again, one can't spend TOO long in any one part of the story. But the story also makes it seem like the adventure happens in a day. Over all... It would have been good had more time been spent developing the characters (I didn't feel I could relate to them as I could in the books), more time explaining certain situations (some were done well enough, some were not. The Tanis-Kitiara-Laurana relationship may have needed more for those who haven't read it before. Maybe. But the Flint-boat thing was handled decently well).

I would say the strong points are: 1) The fact it was attempted. 2) The voice acting. 3) The music. 4) I think this would be a good kids movie.

The weak points: 1) The animation. Disappointing, at best. 2) Story (kinda) - Good try, but I'd want more from it. 3) Characters could have been better.

My recommendation: If you're a parent looking for a movie for your kid, it's ok, but keep in mind there are two more books unaccounted for yet. You may want to wait for when, and if, they come out with the end of the story. If you're a die hard fan, get it if you want, but don't expect too much. For those just looking for something to entertain yourself with, I highly recommend the books over this.

If the next two come out like this, I'll get them when I can find used copies or on sale.",1200787200,,3346,4.455882352941177

I'm sure everyone remembers back to the lord of the rings movies when they first came out as cartoons, I thought they were horrible until I read the books, afterwards I appreciated them for the dream they brought to life.  Maybe this movie could've felt less rushed, maybe they could have found a little more experienced animators, maybe they couldn't afford it, I don't know.  What I do know is that I appreciate everyone who worked on this title, for bringing my favorite childhood books to life.  The story is an amazing one and so in depth there are limitless possibilities to what direction this could go.  I'm glad the writers played a major part in the creation of the movie, that means alot to me as a devoted fan.  What's happened to our society when we downright just refuse to watch a movie just because it has some poorly cg animated dragons here and there or a couple of slips and slides in the voice acting, what about a truly deep and engaging story, does that count for nothing?  Or can it just be replaced with more graphics, gore, and nudity.  I'm just overjoyed that my I can finally view my favorite series as it was invisioned by the authors, and also that they stuck to the book for the most part.  Alot of the dialogue that I remembered was pretty much quoted word for word.  I have to say it may not have been the best in the world but every fantasy series has to struggle to get their story accross to the masses, it took Lord of the Rings how long to get onto the big screen???  Sorry for that rant, I just get so frustrated when people jump to conclusions about things without taking into account that this was most likely a pretty low budget film, and was almost specifically targeted for a dragonlance fan.  I'm done now, I have to stop myself before I start repeating myself haha.

For us fans that have read the books, the movie stayed with the story for the first half and then from there I was disappointed. It was like "" Uh oh, we are running out of time let's just butcher it and rush through to the end"". To do it right, it needed to be either a longer movie or made into two. I still recommend it, but just want to warn ya a head of time. They did good with what budget and time they had to work with. Hopefully this will guide the books to live action.

It was saturated with religious overtones, and missing out on the character depth that made Dragonlance unique from Lord of the Rings and many other fantasy stories.  They changed the plot in unecessary ways that detracted from the story (and I don't mean just cutting out scenes... they added plot points in a manner that makes you wonder if the producers ever read the novels).

The women were overly sexified, the battle scenes weak and the overall story just clunked along.

Too bad, I was expecting something at least equivalent to Batman the Animated series.

3012351,2,B000Y7U996,"Pros:  Some of the characters are decently executed and the movie stays fairly true to the book in terms of script.

Cons:  Awful mixture of traditional and CG animation, some awkward dialogue and a general feeling of being rushed and unpolished.

This movie does a pretty good job at fitting in most of the stuff that was in the books and it does a pretty good job of portraying certain key characters.  Raistlin, in particular, was well written, well acted, and well drawn which is fortunate as he is such a popular character with fans.  This, however, is all the good that I can say of this movie.

To begin with, the sheer look of this movie is enough to cause laughter.  With a few exceptions, the main characters are decently drawn, but for some reason, there is CG animation mixed in this and the two forms do not even remotely go together.  Individually, either form would have been mediocre, but together they just look ridiculous.  I'm no expert on animation and I usually don't nitpick these things, but a child could easily notice that the animation in this film does not mesh.  There are also various decisions which visually do not make sense.  For example, Sturm seems to get a cut on the forehead and the next moment is lying in a huge pool of his own blood, but in the same scene, Tanis is hit many times but shows no sign of injury.  This film really feels like it needed someone to simply go through and point out all the things in it that don't quite logically work or that could be construed as ridiculous.

As far as sound goes, the voice acting was usually alright, though not exceptional and the music was completely unremarkable.

The script is probably the best thing about this movie as it stays fairly true to the books (other than a Larauna scene at the end which me and my friends laughed at for twenty minutes) and the dialogue between characters is sometimes pretty good, but even it suffers from feeling too rushed.  Instead of cutting out some content and developing characters and relationships more, the each location is given the barest treatment possible.  Also, some characters, especially Tanis, have the habit of stating their innermost conflicts in the most blatant way when these things should be shown more subtlety through dialogue and character emotion.

Overall, this movie feels like it could have been good if more time and effort had been put into it.  As it is, I wouldn't recommend it except to the extreme Dragonlance fans and even then I would warn that it contains some big flaws.",1200528000,6,2535,4.630872483221476

This movie was the biggest let down for me, with all the technology out there this was the best you can do? The action scenes just did not flow. I want to like this movie so bad that I have watched it more times and I should have... I had my 11 year old son read the first book and he loves it but even he didn't like that most of the key parts in the book were left out. They should have went with a different annimation studio and made it into a five part series and put in as much as they can to keep it true to Weis and Hickman's story. The comics are great and this, this was just bad. I hope that they will learn and find a better company to do the rest and maybe remake this let down.",1200528000,3,1088,3.776315789473684
3012353,4,B000Y7U996,"The movie in someways was a classic. It's animation reminded me of the style used in the Dragonlance Comic book series and to me was a clever tie in between the two franchises. The 2D art and 3D art mixes were an interesting idea but not always a very effective idea throughout the movie. At times they appeared to be glitches between the two animations. Overall the animation is what people should expect for a film that was low budget. It carries forward the proud traditions of other novels that were turned into animated movies, such as the Lord of the Rings animated movies.

The storyline was based on the Dragonlance novell; Dragons of Autumn Twilight, and while the main story idea was still presented to the audience many fans of the novel will notice differences between the two. The movie is around 90 minutes and compresses 300+ pages into the story. To do this some parts of the novel had to be changed to help the story flow forward. While fans would have loved to see every scene of the book translated into the movie, it is not feasible.

The story that is presented is a straight forward storyline with few twists or turns. A group of adventures return to their old haunt to meet again and discuss their findings after five years apart. In their initial meeting they discover their hometown overrun by goblins and meet a pair of strangers holding a blue crystal staff. They then are chased out of the town and set off in search for the Gods of old. Along the way they have several small adventures that eclipse into one larger adventure.

The ending of the movie is a quite a shock to fans of the novels as this part of the movie has been changed to meet time requirements and to nicely wrap up the tale if the second movie doesn't happen. Even though it wraps it up, it does leave enough or a string dangling for its viewers to wonder what happens to these characters following the harrowing escape.

The voice acting in the movie was pleasantly surprisingly good. There was little here that was wrong and characters seemed to be presented in ways that were considered proper for their character. The whispering voice of Raistlin (Sutherland) is a dream come true for several Dragonlance fans, and one can feel the command of respect that comes for the voice of Goldmoon (Lawless).

Overall the movie was a great first attempt into the film industry. This installment is sure to entertain most fans of the novels, if they can judge the movie as its own piece of work rather then against other animated movies. The acting is superb, the animation typical to the budget, and storyline follows the book in many cases but due to time constraints is forced to tie things together.

I give this movie 3.5 stars out of 5.

Hopefully, the Dragonlance story will follow the same path that the Lord of the Rings storey did; begin with fantastic books, move to cheesy animated movie, become a very good non-animated motion picture. I've been a fan of the books for 20+ years and coincidently, not knowing about the movie, just re-read the Chronicles and Legends trilogies. My opinion may be a bit harsh due to the fact that I feel close to the characters and original storyline.",1200528000,4,572,4.846938775510204
3012357,1,B000Y7U996,"For those who are unfamiliar with Dragonlance, the books aren't just good, they're excellent (once you get past the first couple of chapters that awkwardly try to establish the connection with the world of D&D). The plot is rich, the characters are textured, and the imagery is vivid. This cartoon adaptation has nothing of that.

Firstly, as others have noted, this is drawn and animated in the style -- and (ahem!) quality -- of a rushed Saturday morning cartoon. You could throw a member of the Scooby Doo or Superfriends casts into the crowds and chances are no one would notice.

The character portrayal was equally resplendant. I doubt you could tell High Lord Verminaard from Skeletor or Lex Luthor with your eyes closed. Laurana was reduced to a cartoonish valley girl. Tanis was just Fred from Scooby Doo, but with a beard. And the list of flat stereotypes goes on and on. I need to repeat this: these are NOT the characters you meet in the books! Given the cast of proven actors, I can only blame the director for this amateurish mess.

As if a badly drawn and badly acted cartoon weren't enough, the storytelling was just as disastrous. Scenes that inspired fear and awe in the book were bland yawn-jerkers. Scenes that brought a tear to your eye in the book now had all the emotion of a grocery checklist. Long voyages to distant lands were made to feel like a brief stroll around the corner.

I had imagined the authors watching this with mouths agape and shaking their heads in disbelief, but to my great shock, I found Tracy Hickman giving this insipid belittling of their magnum opus a glowing review! Maybe it's unrealistic to expect a LoTR-like movie adaptation, but come on! At least hold out for something on the scale of Bakshi instead of something that feels as if it should be interrupted by ads for Sugar Corn Puffs.

Conclusion: don't waste good money on this bad CD, but DO read the books. I'll go do just that to wash out the bad taste from my brain.",1200528000,15,1977,4.589235127478753

next i cant beleive how they skimped on the story this should have been a 2-parter in my opinion..they skinped on so much pax tharkas was barely even a scene.no fight at the beginning with the dragon when it melted riverwind..not to mention they get to pax and walk down a tunnel str8 into the dragon lair...no fights,no elevator,no slide,no highbulp,i mean they took out a part of the book that in my opinion is very important.
also it seems liek they added 80s cheese dialogue over more important dialogue--or even funny dialoge--
they also rushed the darken wood scene...evrything was rushed.shoddy animation.
i have a son and more then likely ill stick to reading him the books to get the real deal---by pass this--i hope if they make the other books they smarten up and use a better animation studio and then redo this one over.",1200528000,11,1275,4.621145374449339
3012359,3,B000Y7U996,"Anyone looking for a great piece of animation will be sorely disappointed by this movie, but those who are looking for a solid story, interesting (and entertaining) characters, and a quite impressive soundtrack will still find this movie enjoyable.

Some background:  I've been a dragonlance fan for twenty years, ever since I was in elementary school.  It was my introduction to D&D and the Chronicles (the series of novels on which the movie is based) were some of the first novels I ever read.  So, I had high hopes for this movie, perhaps too high.  My heart sank with the opening sequence, but gradually lifted as the movie continued.

The movie:  The bulk of the animation was done by a Korean animation studio called Toonz.  Note to producers:  Do not hire Toonz.  The animation work was incredibly choppy, occasionally the lines for characters flickered back and forth between frames even though the character wasn't moving, at one point major objects that are in the scene suddenly ""disappear"" because the animator forget to include them (i.e., a large table and chairs that all the characters have congregated around), and the detail in the characters frequently left me wanting for more.  This was made all the more jarring by the inclusion of the 3D animation for the dragons and draconians (a type of lizard-man, for those unfamiliar with Dragonlance).  And yet,the 3D animation was frequently lacking as the movement of the characters seemed wholly unnatural, clunky and lacking a degree of fluid motion that real creatures have.

Overall, the story itself is quite faithful to the novel it's based on (see the Chronicles trilogy by Weis and Hickman).  Yes, a lot of it was cut and abbreviated -- the writers had to turn a 400 page novel into a 90 minute movie.  Peter Jackson tried the same thing with the Lord of the Rings movies at 3 hours each and STILL had to cut things.  As a consequence, the pace of the movie moves very quickly and is sometimes quite abrupt.  Some of the fantastic elements and immersion that you get from the novels is missing because of this.  However, the fundamental plot points remain, the characters come through, and all the major scenes from the novel are included in the movie.  If one accepts the fact that this is a 90 minute movie (actually, less than that if you exclude the credits and opening sequence), it's remarkable how faithful the writers were able to stay to the original book.  Kudos.

The voice work had its ups and downs but was, on the whole, well done.  Lawless and Sutherland did great jobs, as did several of the other actors, but others had voices that did not fit their characters and seemed forced or canned.

The soundtrack is quite good.  I don't know if I'd call it an instant ""Classic"" or masterpiece, but it is very well done.  I might be one of the few people who did not care for the opening theme, but the rest of the music I thought was beautiful and very appropriate to the movie.

As for the DVD itself, the ""extras"" are hardly worth mentioning -- merely artwork stills for character concepts and proofs.  It's interesting for about fifteen seconds, which is also about the extent of the content.  I don't understand why they couldn't have at least included some interviews with the original authors or something, but I guess with such a small budget (only $1.5 million, compared to $150 million for the latest stuff from Pixar) they wanted to make sure as much of it went to the movie as possible.

My hope is that Mr. Hickman, one of the novel's co-authors, is correct -- that this movie is the first part of a journey.  This will only come true, however, if there are enough sales of the DVD to turn a profit.  It seems this movie got little love or attention from Wizards of the Coast (the owner of the license and published of the Dungeons and Dragons RPG), but hopefully the sales and rentals will be enough to not only justify a second installment, but a substantial increase in the budget for its production.

If ""the Dark Queen"" or Tracy are reading this, a heart felt thank you to the both of you. You have brought me countless hours of joy and happiness with the world you have created and this movie only added to it regardless of my quibbles with its production. You are both amazing people. Good luck on all your future endeavors.",1200528000,2,4327,4.637795275590551
3012360,3,B000Y7U996,"I have beena longime Dragonlance fan... not since the very beginning, but for about 19 years now. I own every single novel ever released and love them all except for maybe 10 of them. For years I wished that Dragonlance would be turned into a movie, and now that I've gotten my wish, I don't know what to think.

When it was announced the movie was being made, I was elated. When I heard it was going to be animated, I wasn't as elated. But then I fugured if they did it right, an animated Dragonlance movie could be as good as a live action movie. I saw some early concept art and was pleasantly surprised at how great it looked, but a few months later I saw the first trailer and was left wondering if it was a joke or not, or at the very least I was hoping the animation I saw was just unfinished. This wasn't the case, unfortunately.

The 2d character animation simply sucks. It isn't very detailed at all, it resembles animation from the 80's and it's so jerky that I swear it only runs at 10 or 15 frames per second. The background art and animation tends to be beautiful though. The 3d computer animation ranges anywhere from great to horrid, and all three of these come together to make the movie seem like it's confused. It's really odd, what you see on screen will go from beautiful, to awful, to just okay in the span of a few seconds. Some of the character models are way off too. Flint looks like an albino midget, and Takhisis can only uses one type of breath attack, despite being able to use 5 different ones at once in the novels. At least they put the PG-13 rating to some use and do show a bit of gore and green slime oozing from slain enemies.

The voice acting for the most part is excellent. Keifer Sutherland does an excellent job capturing Raistlin's attitude, except the coughing fits he has sound a bit fake. All other characters sound good, except for Tasslehoff. Kenders are supposed to be really care-free, but he is simply childish in the movie. He is animated childish and his voice is childish. I mean, REAL childish.

The music in the movie is a mix of orchestral and folk arrangements and is simply awesome. It's one of the better aspects of the movie actually.

The story seems to move along at way too fast a pace, but such is the way with novels turned to hour and a half movies. For the time they were given to tell the story, they did a decent job.

In the end, I'm glad the movie came out, but I was hoping for so much more. I think most negativity of this movie would have been downgraded had they used a different animation style. Maybe all computer generated, or all hand animated, but in a darker style similar to Don Bluth or something. I know they were only given a million and a half dollar budget when other animated movies get fifty to over a hundred million, but still...

I just hope newcomers to Dragonalnce don't think the novels are all childish like this, because they aren't.",1200441600,2,2931,4.337591240875913
3012361,4,B000Y7U996,"Like many others, I was excited about this film when I heard it was being released.  I thought animation would be a perfect medium to capture the magic.  Since very, very few movies are equal to the source books, I didn't expect it to be perfect.  I did enjoy it, and hope they make a ""Dragons of Winter Night"". However, I have to say I was a little disappointed overall.

My major problem was the combination of CGI 3-D animation and traditional 2-D animation.  They did NOT meld well.  The dragons and Draconians looked like they were in the wrong movie!  This was especially jarring since the 2-D animation looked like it came out of the 80's, very old school.  This isn't necessarily bad.  I own a lot of 80's cartoons on DVD.  But the CGI made it look cheesy instead of classic.  I was hoping for clean looking animation like ""Batman: The Animated Series"", or ""Justice League Unlimited"".  I hope the filmakers take this into account and stick with 2-D for a sequel, which I would not hesitate to buy.

As to the story, the adaptation was very good.  A full length novel does not compress to an hour and a half movie without feeling rushed, but there was enough backstory for those who never read the series.  The characters were excellent; the production team captured the spirit of each one. And I agree the voice actors were perfectly chosen, especially Keifer Sutherland as Raistlin.  There was a lot of action, and the key scenes and places from the novel appeared.

I do recommend this DVD to fans of action/fantasy films, particularly if you can get it for less than $15.  I would watch it again and I would love a sequel.  The producers just need to overcome some issues.",1200441600,7,1683,4.53156146179402
3012362,4,B000Y7U996,"All in all i found this movie to be rather enjoyable.  i have been a big fan of the books for a long time so i kind of went into it expecting one thing but trying to keep an open mind.  Like with any other movie based on a book it comes up short in areas, after all how you imagine the story will always be different than what someone else imagines.  Secondly, i thought that the voices when the next best thing to being perfect as there could be, they just seem to fit well with the characters.  The one big flaw that i did see in the movie is that some of the main storyline twists and plot adders were removed to make it fit the time frame.  i would love to have seen this movie extended out to 2 or even 3 hours to be able to fit it all in but since that was not the case, i still enjoyed it emmensly.",1200441600,2,805,3.825301204819277
3012363,4,B000Y7U996,"First off, for all those wary people and critics, yes, the animation is less than what we've come to expect in recent times given the advances of CGI and computer animation.  I did think given this story first came in the 80s, the animation fit. However, instead of approaching this film as a flim critic, I allowed the story and characters to move through me.  I was NOT disappointed.

Watching the story unfold, one of the first fantasy novels I fell in love with (not to mention Raistlin, voiced perfectly by Keifer Sutherland!!) my heart was giddy in my chest.  I felt like a young girl on a first date.  Yes, I definetly noticed the jumps in storyline, wished the scenes with Onyx and Riverwind being resurrected was included, but I felt the overall story was present.

My advice to this, for those who love the books don't approach this film as the book in play-by-play animation.  Instead view it with the same love and excitement as when you read it the first (few!) times and allow the characters to invoke within you all the passion and human emotion delivered.  4 stars and a hopeful prayer for the continuation with a bit more effort on the flow, so that it doesn't leave us hanging.  Go dragonlance!",1200441600,3,1212,4.574074074074074
3012364,2,B000Y7U996,"Let me first state that I was pretty optimistic when it came to this movie.  I know initially a lot of people were hoping for a live-action theatrical release but I felt a direct to DVD animation film would better capture the niche persona of Dragonlance.  Plus animation gives the creators so much freedom to explore when creating the world of Krynn and its inhabitants.  I really am an animation junkie.  And throw in Kiefer Sutherland as Raistlin?!  Count me in!

My expectations began to wane slightly upon the release of the CGi frames.  My first thought was ""These look like screenshots for a Playstation game..."" and I mean Playstation, not Playstation 2 or 3.  I decided I could get passed some less than stellar animation (the 2D stills, while low on detail, were clean looking and attractive enough) and my only fear was that some bad CG stuff would turn away non-fans and thus lessen the possibility of a sequel.

Fast forward to yesterday and when I got home from work and popped this sucker in.  Now the menu was really bare, and the extras no where to be found, but I still tried to remain upbeat.  I only care about the film, the rest be damned!  The opening scene caught my eye as we're treated to the aftermath of a most violent confrontation.  The animation was jerky and clumsy, but the still shots at least looked good.  I love the 90's Batman cartoon, and so far it seemed the animation was at least on par with that.

Unfortunately it was mostly downhill from there...

The soundtrack is a positive.  The only negative I can find with it is that some of the chanting vocals seem out of place at time and there isn't one ""Dragonlance"" main theme with a great hook.  Also it is too loud in some scenes and the characters get drowned out.

The voice acting for the main cast is solid.  Flint kind of turned me off at first.  He doesn't really sound like a dwarf, but a guy trying to sound like a dwarf, so that took away from the realism.  And Tas was merely ok.  I commend the effort of Jason Marsden, I just think Tas would sound better with a higher, more youthful voice.  Sutherland did an excellent job with Raistlin.  Some complain he is too dry but that's how I always imagined Raistlin, the man was practically devoid of emotion except for when he goes off on a tangent about his ever growing power.  Goldmoon and Riverwind I felt were excellent.  The rest were good enough.  Some of the support characters sounded out of place.  Onyx and the draconian monk just sound like humans, which makes no sense to me and is really jarring.

Unfortunately, that is pretty much where the good ends.  The 2D animation is mediocre at best  It looks fine when standing still, but once the characters start moving it's just clumsy.  I know a lot of money wasn't put towards this thing but maybe if the money wasn't wasted on the pitiful CG more could have been done with the 2D.  The CG dragons remind me of the World of Warcraft commercials that run on tv, only worse. It's really mind-boggling to think that someone, somewhere, thought this stuff looked good.  The film's absolute low point probably occurs with the draconian fight on the right.  There's basically no background, just fog, and watching the 2D characters interact with the 3D draconians is just painful and embarrassing.  I'm really thankful I watched this alone and not with my roommate who has never seen or read anything Dragonlance related as it would immediately put her off.

And of course, going in I expected some sacrifices to be made to trim this novel down to 90 minutes, but I didn't realize just how much would be lost.  Losing full scenes is one thing, but losing what makes each character unique is another all together.  I feel like if someone who knows nothing about Dragonlance watches this film they will know just as little afterwards.  We get a hint of Raistlin's hatred for his brother and the affection returned, Riverwind's racism, Sturm's distrust of Raistlin, and so forth but so much is lost.  I felt the biggest victim was Tas, and even more specific, his relationship with Flint.  Tas does not come across as a happy-go-lucky kender with an affinity for thievery.  His thievery is alluded to, but at no point would someone realize that kender have an insatiable desire to collect everything to the point that they can't control themselves.  Nor is it really conveyed how Tas always views himself as innocent.  The scene at the end where he mourns the loss of Fizban has no impact because we never got a sense for what kind of character Tasselhoff really is.  The basic plot of the story is really straight forward fantasy questing type of stuff.  What makes Dragons of Autumn Twilight a great story though are the characters and unfortunately they are completely lost and wasted here.  The other major interaction not given enough attention was the relationship between Raistlin and Bupu.  We can tell Raistlin is different, and perhaps a little cold, but the depth of his selfishness isn't really explored and therefore his attitude towards Bupu doesn't seem at all out place in the film.  The part where she gives him the spellbook, like the scene where Tas cries, has no impact at all where as it is one of my favorite scenes from the trilogy.

I could go on and on about other scenes and instances where the essence of a character is lost (Flint's reaction when he thinks Tas is dead in the burning wicker dragon) but I'm sure anyone reading this gets my point.  The plot moves along at a rapid pace as a story really deserving of 2 and a half to 3 hours is shoved into 90 minutes and at no point does the movie fall into a rhythm of any kind.  I've said it before and I'll say it again because it is such an appropriate way to describe the film, but the film really is clumsy in its attempt to tell the story.  I hope that by purchasing the DVD Wizards of the Coast makes enough money to green-light a sequel.  And I hope in turn that the harsh criticism of the fans raises the quality of any sequel so that it is something we can all enjoy and be proud of.  These films do not need to be as good or better than the books, they do not even need to mirror them word for word or scene for scene.  They merely, like the comic books, should provide an alternate way for us to experience Dragonlance that is neither really better or worse, but just unique in the experience offered.  It is my hope that Dragonlance gets another shot on film because as it stands I'd like to forget about this one.

I can't, in good conscience, recommend this to anyone but the diehard Dragonlance fan who needs to satisfy his or her curiosity.  For those individuals (myself included) will likely rationalize a purchase as saying ""It can't be that bad, plus I love Dragonlance!"" but trust me, it is.  Most of us will just be left wondering what could have been?",1200441600,7,6854,4.509326845093269
3012365,3,B000Y7U996,"While I don't play the D&D games I have been an avid reader of the Dragonlance series since middle school in the early 90's and I own every dragonlance book released.
I've been looking forward to this movie for over a year since I feel the story plot Margaret and Tracy came up with is on par with LOTR. Reading both I actually prefer Dragonlance.
I pre-ordered this movie off of Dragonlance.com which came with the extra feature of a bookplate hand signed by both the authors Margaret and Tracy!

When I first saw some of the animations early release I knew Paramount must have been putting a small budget into the production meaning they would have to use older animation styles of the 90's and use a smaller animation company. I tried to keep my hopes at a reasonable level...
I was just hoping it wouldn't be the failure the dungeons and dragons movie was.

Now onto my review..

The good points:
The voice overs and music were not that bad. Also the reproduction of the character design was very pleasing. I also loved it when the film was accurate to the books and you would have flashbacks to your reading.
With Tika and other characters sex appeal I feel they were in a weird middle ground. If they wanted to go for a younger market they should have skipped it but since I think Dragonlance fans tend to be a bit older and I feel they might as well gone for more fanservice instead of here and there.

The bad stuff:
First has to be the old style animation. If Paramount was willing to put up the money for Final Fantasy style CGI then the film would have been an instant classic. Second has to have been the film length! 60 min was no where near enough time to get into the book at all.
Due to the time constraints the edited the hell out of the book. They cut scenes, skipped important plots and characters and messed with the time line they also rewrote some of the book and thats a big no-no. This really killed them since the animation was to poor to bring in people unfamiliar with the books and the plot was to all over to please the die hard fans..
Either stick faithfully to the books or make it entertaining if you plan to alter the plots, to do neither is to waste our time and money.

Overall I think it was a good stepping stone but I think Paramount killed any chance of a sequel, not to mention taking out most of the foreshadowing that was in the first book.
It might be to little to late as the market starts to loose interest in LOTR style movies.

I truly hope some day Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman get to see their baby treated with the respect it deserves. They have been suppling us with a great fantasy world for over 20 years!

I'd say rent the movie then read the book so you're not as dissapointed or skip the movie all together and just buy the books, either way if you haven't read the books.. BUY THEM NOW!
Buying the movie would increase our chances of something better coming out in the future but it's hard to say I can endorse that..",1200441600,,2977,4.295900178253119

3012371,3,B000Y7U996,"I watched the movie last night and have to say a couple things about it.  I'll try not to give too many spoilers.

1.) The story
The story is a trimmed down version of the novel.  They take a couple liberties but the story is overall the same.
2.) The Music
Fantastic music.  The score does well to set the mood.
3.) The voice acting
Mostly good but the stand out was Kiefer Sutherland playing Raistalin.  At first I was skeptical, but he did grow on me.
4.) The characters
They took a few liberties with the characters.  Caramon kind of became a caracture of himself and they did lessen the bond between the twins.  Also, Tanis has become very emo.
5.) The animation
This is where the movie took a nose dive IMO.  The animation quality was equivalent to early 90's US animation (think shows like exo-squad and battle tech).  The mix of CG and traditional animation was awkward at best.  A big complaint for me was that the characters had no facial expression which with some of the voice acting made for sadistic seeming characters.
They did some cool things though, as being a d&d player - I enjoyed the way they treated magic in the film.  Spells did require the magical components that they do in D&D.

Overall -
Its worth watching to support the genre, and is definately better than the D&D movie.  I think they could have done better but its a good first attempt.  I suggest watching it with D&D playing friends and just having a laugh with it.",1200441600,,1450,4.422641509433962
3012372,3,B000Y7U996,"Ah, what could have been. As a longtime D-Lance fan I was really looking forward to this one, and while it could have been worse, it certainly could have been better.

The good news is that it follows the book pretty closely from what I recall, even having the little intro with Tika in there. As interesting as it would have been to have it split in 2 movies as Tracey Hickman wanted, I thought it worked well as a single movie. The characters were all there with good characterization and voice work for the most part (still not sure about Keifer as Raistlin but through no fault of his own), and it was exciting to see this world come to (visual) life.

Alas, almost everything above is undone by the distracting animation.  I can't even begin to describe the problems, but by far the worse part was the CGI mixed in.  It didn't look very believable and didn't quite interact with the traditional animation very well, I thought.  I'm not even sure why you would have 2 different styles (I don't see why everything couldn't be done traditionally).

Still, if you like the Dragonlance books, it's worth a rental. The only reason I can recommend buying is if you want this one to generate enough to ensure the second one (if they make it) is much better.",1200441600,3,1254,4.478070175438597

I did not.  There is no way an animator is going to capture what Krynn looks like in my head, unless they use the old Larry Elmore art.  I can forgive the 2nd rate animation for this movie.  What I absolutely cannot forgive is the rush in telling the story.  Tracy (Hickman) was dead on in his hope that this movie should have gone up to the Solace is burning scene.  For 90 minutes that's all the story you can tell.

DragonLance's driving force is the character development.  You actually care about these characters.  With this film, I didn't care for a one of them.

****SPOILER ALERT*****

The deviation from the story in certain places really bugged me.  Having Onyx, or Khinsanth if you prefer, fly off in the beginning to go guard the disks was just wrong.  Which we don't find out what the disks are until they get to Xak Tsaroth and even then it's like what the heck are these?  We risked our lives for a bunch of disks.  Wasn't a big part of the story being that nobody believed in Dragons?  They were stories told to children to scare them.  In fact when The Companions meet the wicker dragon it kind of reinforces that notion of there not really being dragons.  Just stories to keep people (or Draconians for that matter) in line.  Which makes it all the more dramatic when Khinsath bursts from the well and gives Riverwind an acid bath while Goldmoon is communing with Mishakal.

Kitiara as a Dragon High Lord in this movie?  Isn't that kind of a big deal in Dragons Of Winter Night when we find out that Kit is actually a Dragon High Lord?

Fizban as the storyteller from the beginning and he also turns out to be Paladine?!?!  Are you kidding me?  Fizban turning out to be Paladine is a HUGE plot twist in Dragons of Spring Dawning.

****END SPOILER ALERT*****

I seems to me that this screenplay (I'm being kind calling it a screenplay) was written with the intent, or maybe with the safety net, of another movie never being made.  Let's get all the cool plot twists out of the way, that way the full story was kind of told.

***SPOILER ALERT***

They should have killed off Sturm and Flint right away too, because if another movie gets made, I'm not going to care whether they live or die.  That's how poor the character development was.

***END SPOILER ALERT***

As the title of my review mentions, I was disappointed in this adaptation.  Too much was left out or changed.  That being said, it is still DragonLance, and it is the same characters.  The characters I grew to care about.  I'm certainly glad I got to know them before this movie otherwise I would have never given a second movie a chance, and I certainly would not have wanted to read the book.

If anyone sees this movie and has not read the book.  Do yourself a HUGE favor and read the book.  It is 1000 times better.  It'll go a long way in washing out the taste of this movie.  If you've neither seen the movie nor read the book, read the book.  In fact read all the books (at least both trilogies), and then maybe see this movie.

Like I said, I look forward to a competent adaptation of these wonderful books.  I don't even care if it's 2nd rate animation, live-action, or CGI, or whatever, as long as it is a competent adaptation.  This is a slap in the face to both Margaret and Tracy.  I think Tracy was fair in his review, but it's like a loving parent.  You recognize the flaws in your children, but accept and love them all the same.  Well guuess what Tracy and Margaret?  Your children are like my best friends, and I too accept them flaws and all...even though I am disappointed in the movie sibling, it'll keep it's place on my shelf (probably never to be watched again, but a place of honor none the less).",1200355200,11,3917,4.3647711511789185
3012374,1,B000Y7U996,"This could be the worst adaptation ever.  If i could have given it 0 stars I would have.  I lasted about 1/2 hour with this monstrosity.  They writers have written a story that is loosely based on the epic novel, but unfortunately they used the cliffs notes version.  I have been reading Dragonlance novels since 1985 and this production must have been about money, because it is not about the aesthetic value of the book.  Apparently Goldmoon and Riverwind were already at the Inn of the Last Home, because Sturm didn't escort them in.  Monks?  They are Clerics guys, the draconion voices sound more human than Raistlin, no reptilian hisses, no weapons at their sides, just beating the heroes with their fists.  No hiding along the roadside, no scream from Goldmoon, all the companions were standing there waiting for the draconians.  No white stag.  The companions were all awake when the pegasi set them down on the ground.  Apparently the retard writer decided to have the Black Dragon destroy the barbarian village.  No well, no melting of Riverwind.  Bupu leads them (all of them) to the Black dragon lair, where she is sleeping while the companions loot for the disks.  Goldmoon confronts the dragon on her own.  Raistlin asks Bupu to find the spellbook of Fistandantilus, which by the way now has a brown binding, not night blue.  At this point my stomach was turning over with disgust.  Instead of wasting money on the cast, they (Wizards of the Coast) should have bought a copy of the novel and required everyone to read it.",1200355200,13,1534,4.75
3012375,2,B000Y7U996,"First off, let me say that I still love the books of Dragonlance.
The only positives of this movie are the voice acting and the plot. I felt the plot was pretty faithful to the novel, and the voice acting does fit the characters pretty well. If listened to with the TV off, it's actually an enjoyable audio experience.

The animation is a horrendous mix of CGI dragons and hand-drawn animation, with NO attempt at combining the two. When I first saw the fights between the CGI draconians and the hand-drawn heroes, I double-checked to make sure I wasn't watching some pre-visualization production sequence in the ""extras"" menu. It's bad, really bad. There's one sequence where the CGI character suddenly has 2 arrows appear in his back, stops animating, and just falls over. It's painfully laughable. It looks as if the cel animators and the CGI animators did their parts without ever communicating with each other, and then both works were handed off to a 3rd group to try and mash them together.

To add insult to injury, several final scenes were rendered incorrectly, resulting in a problem known by editors as ""field reversal."" You'll see it in certain scenes where characters are moving left-to-right or right-to-left, and they appear to flicker forward and back in a very artificial and unappealing way. This type of technical problem reinforces that what we are seeing here was an unfinished workprint, which was all that was finished when the money ran out.

My highest hope is that Paramount will take the money from this DVD sale, and re-invest it to finish this movie, which deserves better. Lose the CGI elements in favor of hand-drawn ones that match, and clean up the field-reversed scenes, and this will be a movie to be proud of.",1200355200,10,1746,4.8133333333333335

The voice acting is almost tolerable, but the animation is so poor I had to check my DVD player with another movie because I thought something was broken.

I love the books.  I hoped this would be good, but I just turned it off after they escaped from the Inn to go and write a word of warning to anyone else considering this.",1200355200,20,548,4.093457943925234
3012377,2,B000Y7U996,"I have been waiting for a movie version of a series of this calibur for a long long time.  Growing up, I quickly became a huge fan of Weis / Hickman, Terry Brooks, Ursela LeGuin.  They capitvated my imagination and I loved each and every minute that I got to spend with the characters the created.

With that being said, I loved the movie.  I got so relive some of my favorite scenes : Fizban, Flint and the Lake, Tasslehof and Flint's dagger, etc.  It was very enjoyable for that very reason.

On the other hand, I am so very thankful that I actually knew the story.  If I had watched this move w/o anyone to explain more details about the scene, I would probably not have finished it.  The animation was very very low quality.  Scenes did not match on another and there was not ""animated cohesion"" from the beginning to the end of the movie.  Finally, please please please DONT mix CG w/ animation.

BAD PRODUCERS!!  BAD!

It does not work.  It detracts from the final product.  At times, you can mix is very small portions but this movie would have been far better if it had been one or the other.  Plus, I have never seen a movie in which it dedicated all CG to the bad guys and all animation to the good guys...  very odd indeed.

Should you watch the movie?  Yes indeed, but read the books as well.  Is the quality of the movie reflective of the quality of the books?  The movie does not even hold an candle to the books... Read them!  Do I aniticipate the next movie?  YES  Do I want to see another one despite the flaws in this one?  YES, please.  Do I hope that we see drastic improvment in production quality?  YES.

One last note, Mr. Hickman was correct in the fact that the movie should have ended when they started their return trip to solace.  Too many scenes were skipped and the dialoge was too rushed.

As with many of the complaints of other viewers the animation was off and to inconsistent, little character development. Not to mention little things that really bug me like the whole escape from the prisoner cages. So many things that were changed for NO good reason.

Spoiler

In the book the carts are pulled by elk in the movie by horses of some sort, in the book fizban fireballs the cage door, in the movie he uses knock. Stupid meaningless changes, they may be minor things buts they hurt the film for for me.

Also the DVD itself is not very professional. No scene selection? Like someone else mentioned in another review it seems the money for this film was spent on getting some big named voice actors. Frankly I've seen better films done by college kids. I could take a half hour and learn how to produce a better menu then they did.

I remember when I first read the first book by Weis and Hickman and how excellently they conveyed all the emotions and moments, from subtle and hilarious comedy between Tas and Flint to some of the scariest moments of sheer terror in Xak Tsaroth, as well as all of the really deeply developed characters such as Raistlin, Caramon, and Sturm, to the love triangle between Tanis, Laurana and Kitiara. Every character has their own back story and varied personality and the whole story is ripe with many different moral lessons any one of which could be expanded on.
I've always told people that I considered this story to be the greatest fantasy epic since the Lord of the Rings. If somone had the guts to give it the same treatment, I have no doubt it could do as well as Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, if not better!

They stayed fairly close to the events of the books. Overall it was just a nice experience to see in visual form the stories I'd loved.

I do have a few nitpicky things I didn't like. The animation style..not what I would have choosen. I didn't like that they never really overtly refer to Paladine as the platinum dragon. Though at least the constellation was still dragon shaped. Oh and while they were mostly dead on with the presentation of DnD style magic (suprisingly so for a movie thats usually the first thing the producers get wrong.) they didn't get the fireball right.

Still, none of that really prevented me from enjoying the movie and being very glad it was made. Would have much rather seen a Peter Jackson style live action but I'm happy to have gotten this.",1200355200,8,1136,4.586206896551724
3012382,3,B000Y7U996,"First, I want to thank Tracy for putting in a review from a creator point of view. I have been a longtime Dragonlance fan and have enjoyed reading the first two trilogies many times over and I want to thank You and Margaret for such a great story.

Now for my review of this movie (on it's own merits)

WARNING: SOME SPOILERS

Dragonlance is one of the few trilogies I ever read clear through. That was decades ago. In the past few years, I have been anticipating the release of this movie. I knew about it for at least three years.

I'll admit, I had LOTR type production in mind and would have personally been fully immersed in the Dragonlance movie if production was at least half that of LOTR. Since then, I learned that it was to be animated. I then thought of they style of Final Fantasy: Spirits Within. In fact, that would have been a pleasant format also.

I learned of the actual release date several days ago. I then learned it was a cartoon animation more like the old Saturday morning cartoons. Oh well, I'll give it a try, I said.

At first glance, it reminded me of the old Dungeons & Dragons TV show of the 80's. Then I saw the 3D graphics mixed with 2D animation. The 3D looked good, but had somewhat choppy animation. It also didn't mix well with the 2D half the time (think Van Gogh as if he painted the Mona Lisa).

Graphics aside, the story is there, albeit quite a bit rushed at times. They dropped a lot of the Xak Tsaroth story by distilling it into a ""We Came, We got the disks, We left"" story. Bupu was great comic relief in the books. There be no wicker dragons here. I agree with Tracy, half the first book would have made a feature length story in itself. Also, if I recall the books correctly, Fizban used a fireball to open the slave wagon doors, much to Raistlin's dismay, and not a simple Knock spell.

Still, the 2D/3D mix took some getting used to. After seeing the credits, I think I understand the mix. The 2D stuff was done in Asia and the 3D stuff was done in India. Was the mix intentional, or did each group do what they thought they were supposed to, and due to a production goof, the finished movie was assembled using elements from both.

Still, it puts a moving image to the story. For the longest time, I had my own imaginative impression on what the scenes looked like, based on the book descriptions. I will keep my copy of the DVD. I would never have forgiven myself if I either gave it away or never bought it in the first place.

I hope they do the next book in the series. It appears Tracy hinted to it, but that might just be my perception. Live action would be great, but 2D or 3D will be fine as long as they stick to one format. For those who don't know of the series of books, maybe this will inspire you to read the books. The story is well written and detailed in print form. Maybe if more people are introduced to Dragonlance, with this movie as a catalyst, there will be a better version of the movie in the future.",1200355200,3,2976,4.232804232804233
3012383,1,B000Y7U996,It is painfully obvious that most of the budget for this project was spent attempting to wrangle marginaly popular actors to voice the characters. Dragonlance is best when experienced with ones eyes covered. Enjoy the reasonably executed voice acting and spare yourself the abysmal animation and character design.,1200355200,17,313,5.541666666666667
3012384,4,B000Y7U996,"Like many Dragonlance fans, I was head over heels with delight that there was going to be a movie - something I'd always hoped for since I got caught up in the series. However, from seeing time and again a book that I dearly love being butchered in a movie, I set my expectations low and was bracing myself for a blow.

Boy was I delightedly wrong!

Almost all the voice actors fit perfectly! I admitted that I expected Raistlin to sound a bit more gravelly, or raspy, but his quiet, snarky attitude was brought out wonderfully which made him just as enjoyable as the others.

The CGI with the draconians was a bit disorienting to the mood of the movie. The dragons I could understand, but seeing the animated characters fighting computer ones was a strange experience. As my friends put it as we watched the movie, ""My goodness, they're so much more three dimensional than we are!""

That aside, the rest of the movie was a pure delight. All the important elements were there as well as a few extra lines or moments that bring about smiles and laughter. The moments of comedy were well placed and well played. I cannot WAIT for the next one!

Long live Tasslehoff!",1200355200,3,1164,4.497630331753554
3012385,2,B000Y7U996,"Whooo..where to start? I've been a fan of these books for about 20 years or so. Needless to say that I was psyched to hear of an animated project based on the books. Unfortunately, this falls prey to the typical ""book/video game to movie"" standard.

The animation is about on par with late 80s/early 90s Marvel Saturday morning stuff and at times, the original D&D cartoon. It does not work well for the story being told, IMO.

The movie is PG-13, likely due to some of the violence/blood which is not always at the same level for every fight scene. One fight they show people that were impaled on stakes, people being cooked by fire breathing dragons and blood when creatures are killed. Another fight there's no blood and the creatures are kind of just conked around.

Another thing is the too many seconds spent on Tika's bouncy lady lumps. I get that Caremon is checking her out but it just doesn't work, it feels wrong. Maybe I'm too stuck relating the animation to the cartoons of my youth, where this would be way out of place.

And then there are the dragons and draconians which are all done in CGI. I don't know if you've ever seen CGI characters and traditionally animated characters intergrated in the same scene successfully, but here they aren't. It looks like a bad special effect from a live action movie. The CGI is of the kind you'd find in a Hot Wheels commercial.

The voice acting is not too bad. At first I didn't like Keifer Sutherland as Raistlin, but it grew on me as it went on. He really gets the right attitude down.

For 'extras' you get some character designs and a preliminary animation test. Oh, and some trailers!
If you're familiar with the story and you like it, I'd say rent it...and even then get it from Redbox for $1. If you don't know the story, who knows, maybe you'll like it because you won't be hoping for a lot, but the story may lose you because it's not a generic D&D world and you'll be missing out on a lot of the background...just buy the book!

This series was the first, and one of the only, where I have actually shed tears while reading. I love these stories and that is the reason I may seem to be coming down hard on the movie. It's because I want the movie to be just as good as the books so that anyone not familiar with the books will get the same joy I did from reading them.

3246576,2,B000Y7U996,"I bought this movie for two reasons: 1) I've always wanted to see Dragonlance visually and 2) I wanted to see how crappy it was. I've read the War of the Lance trilogy several times and when I saw that a film was being released, I admit, I was looking forward to it. Dragonlace the movie is like watching a train wreck in slow motion. It's one of those films where it's really bad, but you can't stop watching it because you're curious to see how worse it can get. The dragons and the draconians are computer animated but done sloppily (think of CG back in the early to mid nineties. Remember how choppy and cartooney it looked?), the voice acting is sub par. Raistlin, Tas, and Flint are pretty good but the voice acting of the others sound bored (don't get me started on the Forestmaster). To those who've read the book, there is no Tower of the Sun and Qualinesti looks like a backwater treetown with the most ugliest elves I've ever seen. The three notable dragons, Khisanth, Pryos, and Matafleur, all get renamed by obscure refernces to other books (Khisanth is called Onyx and poor Matafleur isn't even named as the Companions shamelessly use her madness against her). To further lay emphasis on the crappiness of this film, those who've read the book, at the end you see Laurana and Elistan making out and Tanis (Laurana's long time lover) takes it pretty lightly. Even if you hadn't read the book, seeing a sixty year old man making out with a hot young elf is disturbing nonetheless. All in all, it's one of those cartoon movies that kids and young teens would enjoy but as an adult, you'd laugh and marvel at its absurdity.",1200182400,,1633,4.52027027027027

While I can't exactly say I enjoyed this movie just because of how much I loved the books I would buy the sequals and such.  I have two major beefs with the movie.  First of all and it may just be me but there is way too much music that is way to loud.  I had a hard time hearing most of the characters especially the soft spoken raist when the music was blaring in the background during the WHOLE movie.  You don't have to have music during the whole movie.  Another is how they but the draconians and dragons.  It was just terrible to see the two types of imaging I don't know what they were thinking with this they really should of just stuck with one type.  Watching it made it seem cheezy like the draconians were just overlayed into the movie and were very out of place. The money used to animate them in that way could of been used for something else and would of also made the movie way better if they would of just kept it all 2-D that way it could all flow as one.  I was pretty happy with the story line they did cut out a couple of things I wished they wouldn't of but I understand they couldn't show the whole book in the movie.  In conclusion the story line was great because it came from a great book but the animation mixture could of used a lot of work and the music could be toned down a notch.

3246578,4,B000Y7U996,"Dragonlance is a journey ... and was from the beginning.

Dragons of Autumn Twilight was and remains a first in so many ways: it was the first novel together for Margaret and me, it was the first attempt at doing a classic fantasy story for a game setting, and the first book publication for TSR. Looking back on it now, after twenty years of polishing our writing, that first book looks rough and imperfect ... but it was the first step down a road that lead us to great wonders. Flawed as it appears now ... it is deservedly beloved.

Since before the publication of Dragons of Autumn Twilight, we have seen Dragonlance in cinematic terms. We wrote the books visualizing them as movies and dreamed that one day, our visions would be realized on film.
Now, thanks to Paramount Pictures and Epic Entertainment, that dream has been realized and with it, we take our first step down the new road of Dragonlance films.

Recently, Paramount sent to Margaret and me a copy of the film on DVD so that we could preview the final cut. It is quite a thrill watching our characters come to life and hearing the familiar story begin anew. Michael Rosenbaum and Fred Tataciore bring life to the opening scene on their way to meet their friends in Solace. The voice casting in this film is phenomenal. Lucy Lawless gives Goldmoon wonderful depth and even newcomer Caroline Gelbert brings a freshness to Laurana that is breathtaking. The heart of Dragonlance has always been its characters, and the movie shines especially in two of the stories most intriguing personalities, Tasslehoff and Raistlin ... each brought vividly alive by the incredible talents of Jason Marsden and Keiffer Sutherland.

Before our family started our little preview, I presented our audience with a little challenge: to find all the scenes where I can be found in the movie - kind of a personal `Where's Waldo'.

As for finding me in the film ... well, you'll just have to see for yourself.

Does this film have flaws -- absolutely. While the soundtrack is Oscar-worthy and the voice talent is unquestionably perfect, and Will Mineou's direction and art are beautiful, the animation itself is less than I would have hoped it to be. The style is unfortunately inconsistent from shot to shot. Interestingly, the mix of CGI with traditional cell animation worked quite well ... but it was the graphic inconsistencies between cell animation segments that I found problematic. Several sequences used post animation effects over still-motion in lieu of honest animation. My son, Curtis, is a professional After Effects artist as well as a professional magician. As he pointed out, there are only so many times in a piece you can use the same expedient short-cut before the audience begins to see the trick being played.  The movie has a major picture sound to which the visuals struggle to keep up.

Dragonlance fans will probably also be shocked to hear my second criticism: I believe including the entire first book in the movie was a mistake. Both the screenwriter and I argued against putting all of Dragons of Autumn Twilight in the first film ... believing that the film should portray essentially the first half of the book and finish with `Solace is burning.' But the `powers that be' adamantly required that the entire book be portrayed. George Strayton did a masterful job of accomplishing that goal and his script is undeniably brilliant - but I still believe the film's structure suffers from the enforced requirement of including the entire novel.

That being said, I am delighted with Dragons of Autumn Twilight and find myself liking it even more with each subsequent viewing. It is the first dragonlance movie and, as such, shares the heritage of tentative first steps ... but in those steps opens up a new road of films before us. `Lord of the Rings' was, after all, first a Ralph Bakshi cartoon.

Dragons of Autumn Twilight is not a destination ... it is the opening of a door and the beginning of a journey. Pop the popcorn, grab your hoopak and come with us down a new road with old friends.",1196640000,234,4069,4.767045454545454
3246579,4,B000Y7U996,"Dragonlance: Dragons of Autumn Twilight was the first ""real"" book that I ever read cover to cover (multiple times and continue to do so!) that I actually enjoyed.  Raist has always been my favorite character and kinda reminds me of myself at times but then again so does Caramon!  Anyway, I think that this movie was very good for its first go around.  Just remember the Hobbit and you can catch my drift.  The animation wasn't the best and mixing it with CGI rarely works well.  I'm going to take a guess and say that it was funds that made the poor decisions on a lot of the less than stellar mixing of the two.

I loved the voice-over by all of the actors.  They made it ""feel"" right and they fit right into the story.  This has been my dream for over 20 years and it finally came true.  Was it a bit disappointing?  Yes.  Could it have been better?  Yes.  Would I buy it?  Yes.  Sometimes even movies that aren't the best are still worth watching and still worth the story.  I know they cut out ALOT of the story and putting the whole book into an hour and a half was a bit much but if you have read the story as many times as I have it still flowed and gave me the pictures and images that I need to walk down the path to Solace with my dear friends and live the adventure as if I were truly there.

I would like to say that making these books into a LOTR - type of movie would be totally AWESOME and would rake in hundreds of millions of dollars.

I noticed some blurriness around the characters eyes at first but got used to it. Don't know if that was from the dvd to HD tv conversion or the animators intention. Tried it on a dvd player and a ps3, same result. After I got into the story I didn't notice it as much.
- Thoroughly enjoyed the story and characters. Never really recognized the All star voice cast, though I tried to listen and decide who they were, which I think was kind of a good thing. It means they did a good job of being someone else.
- Not the best animation overall, but acceptable. I would love to see a first class animated production of something DnD besides just LOTR. I mean, I love LOTR, but i hoped it would open doors for other epic DnD related productions or at least get some fringe projects like Hawk the Hunter finally produced. How anout a Drizzt movie!?

I hadn't read the books in years; too long, really, so it was like a story I knew was great was going to be new to me again.  Then I read the reviews and was a bit more cautious.  I decided to check this one out anyway.  It's average.

EVERYTHING they say about the animation is true.  DoAT looks like a cheap flash cartoon, Roger-Rabbited together with CGI renderings done by a middle schooler using free software.  They use both in the same shot, too, and the effect is jarring.  The CGI characters, for example, don't cast shadows and look like they're resting atop the rest of the animation, rather than a part of it.  Any scene with the draconions is just awful.  The traditional animation is done better, but not much.  All of the characters have super-choppy movements, as if they cut several frames of animation out to save costs.

It's odd this looks so cheaply done, since they got some respectable Hollywood talent, such as Kiefer Sutherland and Lucy Lawless, for the voice acting, which is always at least passable and often quite good.  The story moves quickly, but I didn't mind too much.  It definitely crams more than one movie's worth of plot into 90 minutes, but I can only think this movie was made to secure Paramount's film rights to the Dragonlance property, so you weren't going to get a two-parter, anyway.  I caught only a few notable deviations from the book and didn't mind any of them.

Still, it's not as bad as it looks, even though it looks absolutely awful.  -5 stars for the visuals, 5 stars for being Dragonlance, 3 for the voice acting, and I'll give 'em a pass on the unimaginative MIDI-synth score.",1408492800,,1700,4.5394736842105265

Putting aside the fact, major points of the book are removed, edited, and such, as with most book to movie translations.  That in reality this should be two movies and not one, just to do the story justice.  This is a review on the actual product that was released.

1.  The animation is inconsistent, you will see nicely rendered 3D effects and scenes, and you will see lazy standard animation.  When I say lazy, I am talking poor quality.  And there is clumsy bouncing from scene to scene.

2.  For a large number of the 2D animations, to me it seemed like a pane was out of focus.  In my opinion the product never should have been ok'd to release, and the editor should be fired for his or her poor job in quality assurance of the animation process.

3.  The story is on fast forward, like I said before, this should have been broken into two movies, 90 minutes does not do the story justice.

4.  The voice acting is well done and is a positive aspect of the movie, at first I was not too wild over Kiefer Sutherland's voice of Raistlin, however he did grow on me, and he did a great job.  As well as the other cast members.

If you are a fan of the series, rent it before you buy it, and see if this is something you want in your collection.  I am more disappointed in the quality that  Paramount Pictures released.",1369526400,27,1566,4.173913043478261

3246626,2,B000Y7U996,"Let me first state this. I am a die-hard DragonLance fan. I have so many books we had to devote an entire bookcase. Some of my most prized possessions are two books dedicated to me by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. So needless to say. once I first heard that the long-fabled DragonLance movie was finally being released, I was elated. Yet, this elation was tempered with trepidation.

It has long been known that ""the book is better"". While some would disagree, I felt this held true with The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Even, minimally, with Lord of the Rings, as amazing a trilogy as those movies were. So with fear in my heart, I placed my preorder for the movie through Amazon.com, and waited patiently for the package to arrive in my mailbox. Then, the movie sat for nearly a year, before I watched it 4 days ago.

Why the delay? I was scared. And, after watching the movie, justifiably so. I was yelling at my television when scenes were altered. The mix of CGI and traditional animation was pulled off horribly. Even with the 'starpower' (and I use the term loosely) of the actors used, the voiceacting was lackluster. So without further ado, the review:

The Animation and Sound

The animation for this movie is, in short, average. While not as bad as that atrociously drawn Powerpuff Girls, the detail was not even as good as say, Thundercats (yes, I am showing my age). Most of the artwork stayed true to the books, with most of the characters posing at least a passing resemblance to the novels. Most notably, Raistlin and Tanis were the most accurate. Sturm's armor was a hodgepodge of silver metal; Caramon lacked his trademark Dragon Helm. Goldmoon's leather armor was generic, Flint looked somewhat like the taciturn dwarf, and Tasslehoff was a gaily-colored kender. The colors were bright and vibrant. Backgrounds were boring and lackluster, offering none of the details you would imagine from reading the books.

What set the DragonLance novels apart from other book worlds was the amazing detail the authors created. Here, the generic environments that the Companions find themselves in help further drive what could have been a glorious, fitting rendition into the dirt.

Even the CGI is lacking. The quality of the cinematics would be more appropriate in 1995, not 2007 (when it was released). No smoothing, jerky animation and the very obvious fact it was CGI detracts from the title. It is really bad when a draconian shows up rendered in full 3-D, attacking a very 2-D Sturm. Gee, having that extra dimension would probably help me win that fight, too.

The voiceacting and music could have helped the movie shine. Sadly, even with the voices of actors such as Lucy Lawless and Kiefer Sutherland, the talent is bland and without enthusiasm. The few times the characters are required to speak with any amount of emotion, it seems trite and sarcastic. While it cannot be expected, I suppose, that the actors involved in any movie project like the source material, it is obvious that they probably never read the books. Impromptu, misplaced bravado, random coughing fits for Raistlin, and characters that come across as egotistical idiots further ruins a 25-year-old franchise.

The music is nothing to write home about. To be perfectly honest, I can remember little of it. I suppose it could be said it suited the scene, but any movie that has a soundtrack that is immediately wiped from your memory pretty much failed in that department, too.

Story

Even with all of the aforementioned, if the movie had stayed true to the stories in the books, I would have been willing to overlook these (major) flaws. I could have ran my books through a shredder, danced on the paper bits and fed them to my dog afterward and done less damage to the story than this movie.

Aside from conversations happening that never took place in the books, the concept of ""foreshadowing"" is lost here. Cutscenes interspersed with the storyline pretty much give away the entire plot of the whole trilogy, even though this movie was designed to encompass the first book. While I understand that to execute a verbatim translation from the books onto film would have undoubtedly resulted in a 4-hour movie, critical scenes from the books were missing.

With the assumption that you have at least read the novels to have an interest in this movie, here goes some major missing scenes:

-The bulk of the Qualinesti interaction after the slave caravan is rescued
-The Sla-Mori sequence is horribly abbreviated, including the Dark Elf gone
-Rescuing the slaves at Pax Tharkas is shorted, with Eben never really being explained as a traitor
-The wicker dragon in the swamp, from the first part of the book, was missing entirely; the party literally went from Que Shu to Xak Tsaroth in one swift scene- I guess it was next door

This does not encompass every missing scene. Other major faux pas include revealing the true identity of Fizban right after the release of the slaves from Pax Tharkas, as well as having his death occur from falling into a chasm, rather than down the chain mechanism within the fortress. At the beginning, when the old man hobbles into the Inn of the Last Home, Tika asks him to tell her a story to help pass the time, which also never happened in the books. I suppose you could consider this a minor complaint, however, as a purist, this helps to foster the handholding this movie has. Come to think of it, there were no parts of the movie that weren't awkwardly and painfully explained later.

The Verdict

For the sake of completing your DragonLance collection, that is really the only reason I can think of to shell out your hard-earned cash on this cannonfodder. If you have only a passing interest in the series, are thinking about reading the books and find this to be a quick way out, or are a glutton for punishment and want to see a series with a rabid following destroyed for an hour (or so), pick this up.

Overall, this is best described as a terrible 1980's animation.  The Dragonlance Chronicles were awesome books; this childish cartoon did them no justice.",1330905600,3,826,4.794326241134752

My sisters and I laugh along together at the cheap animation and design, the CGI that makes the dragons look like Burger King toys, the 1980's fantasy apparel, the cheesy comic relief characters, and Keifer Sutherland's violent coughing fits. What I love most about this movie is hearing his hoarse voice snapping, ""All I require is to be left alone! I AM PREPARING MY SPELLS!""

3246640,2,B000Y7U996,"The Dragonlance series was what I grew up on. (Well, okay, that and Choose Your Own Adventures...)

This 'movie' was a travesty. Barely made it through to the end w/o turning it off.

For one things, traditional-ish animation & CGI should NEVER be mixed. EVER. This should be obvious from all the failed animes that have tried to combine the two and blatantly failed. It's just jarring to have two completely different styles of animation that don't work together on the screen at the same time. Either decide on full CGI or full animation. HYBRID ANIMATION DOESN'T WORK.

Also, the quality and presentation (characters, fight scenes, etc.) seemed to vary drastically throughout.

They need to get someone who actually LOVES the series to get in there and GET IT RIGHT... This was a pretty pathetic attempt to capture the Dragonlance phenomenon. Really, it seems like more of a cash grab with no attention to quality.

Rent it, if that. If for some bizarre reason you REALLY love it (really??), then maybe buy it. Otherwise, pass until they remake it properly (sadly, probably won't happen)...",1306195200,3,1093,4.918478260869565

It may appeal to Dragonlance followers and to be fair, it is creative.  But the animation is only average and the dialoge is stilted, even for a cartoon.
However, my teenager and his friends have watched it several times with the sound turned off and laughed their heads off as they make up their own dialoge. So we finally bought a copy.  Personally, I'd rather watch the animated cartoon of
the Hobbit.  But my teenager and his friends think this cartoon is a lot of fun.",1304985600,,529,4.377551020408164

They did leave out one big event, but I do understand why, because it's animated, and that part of the story was pretty rough.",1296432000,,298,3.966666666666667
3246643,3,B000Y7U996,"The original book is such a great story that this lame effort actually helps one to relive it in 90 minutes.  The problem is that, as a film in its own right, it demands that you not only suspend your disbelief but also that you suspend normal standards of viewing to get anything out of it.  If you haven't read the books, you'll get nothing and probably hate it.  If you have, you might be able to look past the many faults for the nostalgia value.

A messy combo of CGI and choppy cell drawings, the animation is downright silly and embarrassing in many scenes (from clumsily rendered sensuality of boobs bouncing to the hyper-detailed CGI draconians with rams horns) considering how good the books were.  Why do they integrate ""real"" flames of fire with the flat cartoon images every chance they get?  It would help the audience get into the story and forget about the limits of animation if they just stuck to 1 style.

The film does stick close to the book's plot, even using its dialogue, but cramming that into 90 min. means telescoping so many events together that the heroes can only exchange soulful sentiments without pausing between blasts from dragons and battles with hobgoblins. They arrive at a whole new continent by foot in every scene and engage in an epic battle every 5 minutes. Putting the ruined pacing and awful animation aside, it's a convenient review of the book's outline. Like watching the 10-minute narrated review of the entire LOST series.

Overall, I enjoyed it as a cheap diversion (like binge reading 100 Prince Valiant comic strips in a gosh-darn hurry).  It actually made me hope for a sequel that would do a better job with the next book in the Chronicles.",1296259200,,1695,4.6610738255033555

I really am disappointed in the whole thing because of the way they did the Lord of the Rings Trilogy that was great. I think they should have done the same for these series. I know now Wizards of the Coast must be cheap  and turned this wonderful story into a crappy movie that should have been made just like the Lord of the Rings but instead was made very cheaply. Shame on them! They should have not done it at all just stick to the books.,1284336000,,600,4.172413793103448
3246647,3,B000Y7U996,"These books taught me to enjoy reading when I was 12 or 13.  Until that point, reading was something that was required by school.  I love the Chronicles series and highly recommend them to anybody, but especially those young teen types who may be emboldened by World of Warcraft or other fantasy series.  The books are pretty typical and owe a great deal of their story to (in my opinion) the Star Wars Series and The Lord of the Rings.  The ups and downs and as George Lucas would describe it, the classic story telling technique of a possible stand alone story (the first in all 3 mentioned seriesP), a deeper/darker second part, and a conclusion in part 3.  This stand alone was a good thing to make into an animated film in my opinion, but they could have done a lot more with it.

It is pretty true to the story in the book, and even provides some background information not mentioned in the original text.  I don't think this takes away from the movie, nor does its absence hurt the book, but it may have drawn away some of the portions of the book which I had grown quite fond of.  Most of Xak Tsaroth and the black dragon was skipped over or substantially abbreviated, and I really enjoyed reading those portions.  Also removed was the Tas in the False Black Dragon, another favorite of mine that I felt helped keep the characters and story in line.  It goes fine in the movie, but it was disappointing.

The music is actually pretty impressive.  Very Fellowship of the Rings and I am sure it is deliberately so.  It won't hold up to the Fellowship soundtrack to save its life, but its not bad.

The animation is a weird ""We wish we could draw like JAPANAME"" type seen in a lot of recent cartoons, and that is also disappointing.  Very Saturday morning cartoon/ old GI Joe, and that isn't the right answer.  Its not even The Hobbit good, which it might have learned more than a few things from and kept some of the old school flavor to make it seem a bit more nostalgic.  Some scenes are very well done however and the effort is apparent, but some look like they were not finished in time and just look absolutely terrible!  See the exit from Xak Tsaroth to see what I'm talking about.  The artists also took some liberties in their creation, which I am not a fan of.  Qualinesti got turned into some weird David the Gnome/Lothlrien hybrid, which is not how I perceived it in the least.  The characters are pretty well done, though Goldmoon is a blonde/blue, which doesn't make much sense for a Native American based culture.  Some complain about the Draconians and the CG animation technique used for them, but it really isn't all that bad.  The dragons are also CG.  Overall, once you can get past the choppy Saturday morning nature, you can power through.  For a book like this that means so much to so many people though, they really should have tried for crisper animation and continuity.  Do we expect Cowboy Bebop like art or Ghost in the Shell/SAC like precision?  Probably not, but we would at least like to see them try instead of settling for mediocrity.  The boobage is also a bit ridiculous.  Granted, the target audience is young teen males probably, but the reviewer who said it just felt weird to be watching Caramon check out Tika's obviously bouncing and gravity defying gigantic breasts hit the nail on the head.  They should have toned that back a bit and kept it sane.  There is a love story there between many characters, even sex in the novels, and Tika's rack is mentioned several times, but there are better ways to visualize it for your audience to show the connection and still hold a little bit of class besides the obvious focus on breasts in several scenes.  It can be quite obvious.  There is one scene where the camera actually starts out looking at cleavage before panning to the speakers face. If they make a second, I hope they leave the Kit promiscuity up to our imagination and we aren't faced with some awkward Team America sex scene.

Voice Acting-  Terrible.  There's really no other way to say it.  Sutherland may have been persuaded by cash or something just so they would have a name to put on the DVD case, but it sounds like he is saying his lines as lifeless and as quickly as possible to make it out of the studio and back to being Jack Bauer as fast as possible.  I always thought Gary Sinise would have been a shoe in for the role, live or animated, but again, just my opinion.  The hissing draconinan monks we probably all loved sounded like the weatherman from Peoria Illinois, crisp and clear, which really doesn't paint the character at all.

So overall, it isn't bad, but it isn't good.  It could have been so much more but just feels rushed and willing to accept good enough.  I would say it is worth seeing for any fan of the series, but it is in no way shape or form an adequate substitute for the book.  I wouldn't watch it prior to reading the books either, because the imagery provided in the books is much much stronger (what a pathetic thing to say about a movie really...) and your own imagination will be more than adequate when guided by the authors.",1278374400,,5123,4.457572502685284
3246648,5,B000Y7U996,"There are way too many negative reviews out there. I have been an avid fan of the Dragonlance saga going way back... In fact, I still will occasionally re-read Chronicles & Legends because I like to re-visit what has to be one of the best fantasy stories out there. I bought Dragons of The Autumn Twilight DVD with a cringe because of all the really bad reviews out there, but like others I just had to see if it was really that bad or if everyone just had too high of expectations.

I enjoyed this movie based on multiple reasons, the number one being I wanted to see the characters brought to life. Now take into point that there is NO way to make an animated movie that will accurately portray what your mind see's when reading. You would have to make a LOTR type (we can only hope) mega blockbuster to even come close. They did an excellent job with this movie... I loved the music and was left wondering why all these people are dissin' the graphics on this movie. If anything, the only thing I found wrong was how fast paced it was, I mean you can only cram so much into  1 1/2 hours I guess. This movie is what it is, a great story come to life. I didn't have a problem with the sound of this movie like some of the reviews I read, I guess either my system is great or there are some seriously bad ones out there.

People who have read and love the Dragonlance series will like this movie.. C'mon, you know you have to see... I really do hope they come out with the others... And in the same format! If it gets real popular maybe we'll see a trilogy on the big screen... Someone call Peter Jackson!!!! Margaret... Tracy.. Is this thing on?!?!!?? Lol...

For some bizarre reason they chose to use normal animation, except when it came to dragons and draconians. Then they used a poor-man's computer animation, and plopped them into the regular animated scenes, resulting in wooden-cut-out like appearances, and golem-like movements. The animated movements of the regular characters weren't any better, and everything was poorly drawn. Disney it isn't.

It's not very faithful to the source material, for that matter. For those who are familiar with the book, I would just say, don't get your hopes up. No banshee; Riverwind doesn't die; the High Theocrat doesn't stick his hand back into the fire; Tanis doesn't get his sword from the skeleton; they don't follow the white hart; the list goes on, and on, and on.

3246652,1,B000Y7U996,"If you grew up reading fantasy novels, chances are you're familiar with Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis' Dragonlance series. The books are a staple in fantasy fiction, and contain some of the genres most beloved and renowned characters. The story revolves around the land of Krynn, which was abandoned by the light gods more than 300 years ago. Unfortunately for its friendly inhabitants, the dark gods have made a comeback. Cue the group of random heroes who traverse the land and fight all sorts of monsters in order to save the world.

When I heard that we were being treated to an animated Dragonlance feature, I was very, very excited; finally, I thought, Dragonlance would get a chance to shine in the mainstream. With a cast including Keifer Sutherland, Phil LaMarr, Lucy Lawless, Michelle Trachtenberg and others, it was sure to be a hit! How nave I was.

Despite having an excellent source material, Dragonlance: Dragons of the Autumn Twilight falls short in just about every department you can imagine. Even the very beginning of the feature will leave you shaking your head, as you bear witness to what looks like Beast Wars animation in the Dragonlance logo. (Which, by the way, goes on way too long for what it is.)

The animation woes aren't specific to the title screen, either. In what was a very stupid move, the film contains both 3D and 2D animation. The problem? Like I said, the 3D animation looks like early 90s CG, and the 2D animation belongs in an 80's Saturday morning cartoon, not a feature film in 2008.

If you're a Dragonlance fan, I bet right now you're reading this with a single tear running down your cheek, asking ""Surely the content can make up for those shortcomings!"" I'm sorry to say they don't.

What begins as issues with the presentation and techincal aspects of the movie ends with issues in every other area. For starters, this is a PG-13 movie for violence, yet there's very little violence, and what we do see is extremely poorly done. Since it's all hand-drawn (which, I admit, was a nice attempt at being unique), moments with a lot of action actually stutter and lag visually for a bit. Imagine loading into an area in World of Warcraft with a lot of people just hanging out, and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

Now, when I talk about the lack of violence, I'm not complaining because the movie isn't violent enough. Rather, the movie TRIES to be violent but just decides halfway through, ""You know what? Screw it. We're a cartoon!"" I'm talking full blown dwarven axe to the chest as an instant kill - yet not a single drop of blood. Or a person dramatically cutting away at a fallen opponent who's offscreen, yet when we pan out they're completely intact, and look like they're napping due to the jarred storyline instead of being slaughtered by an angry half-elf. That all changes when 3D baddies are involved, though. Stick them with something sharp, and they'll bleed a little until the wound vanishes in the next screen and their armor isn't even damaged.

When it comes right down to it, Dragonlance: Dragons of the Autumn Twilight relied too much on the original material. If you aren't familiar with the book, you aren't going to know what the hell is going on. Even Hickman has said in the past that the first book should be split into two movies; guess the makers of this one didn't listen.

If only the producers spent less budget on Hollywood voice talent which was largely miscast, and put more money towards the actual animation and editing, then maybe we'd have a serviceable film for Dragonlance fans, much like DC and Marvel's animated DVD features do their thing for comic fans. As it is, this is an affront to anyone who has ever loved the books, and I sure hope someone else gets a shot at the next Dragonlance film.

How you'll feel after this is all over

CONTENT - 1/5

Oh God, where to start. There's far too much material to cram into this short of a time slot, and what is crammed in doesn't flow well at all. People unfamiliar with the books will have no idea what the hell is going on, and people who loved the books will be pissed that the only character with any sort of build-up is Tanis.

VIDEO - 2/5

From a technical standpoint, I suppose there's nothing wrong with the output. From a stylistic one, though, it's a mess. Crappy 3D with dated 2D? Yeah, it would work assuming the 3D monsters weren't fighting the 2D heroes in half the scenes.

AUDIO - 3.5/5

There's 5.1 and 2 channel sound available, so if you have a system you can get something out of it. At times the music seems a little too loud, and turning it up to hear the talking will annoy your neighbors. Despite the list of big names, no one really stands out. (Except Phil LaMarr, but that's just because he uses the EXACT same voice as he did for Green Lantern. Close your eyes, and you'll hear John, not Riverwind.)

EXTRAS - 0.5/5

The two extras on the disc are basically Powerpoint presentations of preliminary artwork. Sadly, the line-art preview looks better than the final product.

REPLAY - 1/5

Unless you're the type who loves to get drunk with friends and laugh at old 80's cartoons, once you finish this you'll likely put it away for good.

OVERALL SCORE - 1/5

If you're a huge fan of the Dragonlance series and pick this up, be forewarned that you will eventually regret it. Sure, at first it seems okay, then at the end it seems like it picks up, but when it's all said and done, this straight-to-DVD animated feature falls short in every area.

The tale, to which this movie stayed fairly faithful to in many ways, is your standard epic fantasy including many of your favorite fantasy standards. Grumpy dwarf, dumb warrior goons, sneaky rogue, and so forth. Check.

They must have blown their budget on the voice acting. It was pretty good, and considering the cast, one would expect it to be.

Unfortunately, that's where the list of goodness ends. The wonderful story is brought to life by the animated equivalent of multiple personality disorder, and both personalities are the type you don't want to talk to at awkward family gatherings. On one side, you've got standard animation that looks like it was done by the He-Man and She-Ra folks on a bad day, and on the other side, you've got CGI dragons that wouldn't make the cut for your average MMO or console video game. The draconians weren't a total loss, but having the rather stiff CGI baddies going to battle with their drawn counterparts just didn't get the job done.

First off the animation is poorly done.  The blending of 3D and cartoon animation does not mix well at all.  Maybe they should have spent more money on animation than they did with the voice acting.  Yeah there was an excellent cast for the voices, but that doesn't matter since the dialog sucks.

There's no depth to the characters either.  Everything felt so rushed.  They tried way too hard to cram everything into a 90 minute block.  Did I mention that the animation really blows?  I would have been happier with a low budget flick with B-movie actors.

Don't bother.  Well, if you have kids and you want them to experience Dragonlance, then by all means.  I'm sure they won't really care about how it looks anyways.  But for all of the die hard fans out there, including myself, what a disappointment.  Weis and Hickman should be ashamed for letting this project finish the way it did.

Cheap animation, lousy voice acting, no character development, I could go on and on.  Save your money and buy the books instead.  And to those who saw the movie and never read the books, please give Dragonlance another try and read the books.",1240876800,6,1353,4.463114754098361
3246658,2,B000Y7U996,"OK, like many other reviewers here I have been a fan of the books for very many years. I couldn't believe it when I heard they'd finally make a movie out of this...and couldn't believe what I saw upon its release. It is flawed on many levels. The animation is pretty bad. The combined 2D heroes against the CGI draconians just doesn't work. The voices are OK, but the requisite cheesy dialogue is in full force. Why is it so hard to write a fantasy script with some dignity? In addition, the idea of trying to cram the entire book into this short time is doomed from the outset. The story could never be done justice that way. I know the Chronicles would make an awesome anime series if you could do just one or two chapters in a half-hour episode. That way you could develop the characters and settings properly, which is really where the strength of Dragonlance lies. Oh well, I'm sure that is a pipe dream as there will never be the budget for that. For anyone who gave this a positive review, here is an objective test you should consider: Would you be proud to show this to a non-Dragonlance fan? I'd be more embarassed.
All that said, this clunker will still not dull my love of the books, which I will defend to the death.

While the voice talent is good, the animation is half-baked.  The mix of CGI and traditional animation makes this look like an early 80s music video.  It was painful to watch.

Another reviewer here said ""rent before you buy"".  I wish I saw that before I bought and subsequently watched this.  I would hope that in the future the DragonLance series gets revisited with proper animation or live action.",1237852800,4,549,4.776595744680851

Looking at the animation I figured it must have come out a while ago and I just never heard of it. I watch maybe the first 20 minutes and had to stop. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was killing the whole experience I remember from when I read the books. I just couldn't believe how a movie about my favorite book series could be so horrid.

If you are a fan of the series you have to at least rent it to see it for yourself. If your not a fan or are interested in the series don't bother with the movie.

I must say just the fact that they made the movie makes it hard to give it a bad rating.  They stayed close to the story though a 90 minute movie makes that very difficult.  I was impressed that they got Keifer, Lucy, Jason, and Michael for voices with such a small budget as well.
Now for the let downs.  Graphics and actions sequences were not on the level of most recent movies, but the budget for the film was only around 1.5 mil from what I've heard.  So the saturday morning cartoon look is justified by that.  I also would have liked a little better dialog fo draw you into the story.

Um, I figured wrong.

I don't even know where to start.  Oh, wait.  Yes I do.

The animation is horrible.  One of the reviewers said the animation reminded him of the old Saturday morning cartoons.  I think he's onto something - they must have pulled one of those old artists out of retirement.  And never mind that he has cataracts now.  And it's not even consistent!  The monsters are all done up in some kind of computer-generated animation, which only makes it look like they blundered into the wrong movie by mistake.

They packed way, way, WAY too much of the book into the movie.  Maybe the animation would've been forgivable if the movie wasn't covering a chapter or two every 10 minutes.  In any fantasy book you read, the richness of the characters plays a big part in the story's success.  The movie doesn't give you time to get to know any of the characters...if I hadn't already been familiar with them, I can guarantee I wouldn't have sat through to the end.

I almost didn't anyway.  The scripting and casting were horrible, too.  Kiefer Sutherland was a rotten choice for Raistlin - not weak enough, not sick enough, and CERTAINLY not sinister enough.  And you know all those ridiculous Power of Good declarations that fantasy authors always make?  The whole, ""I vow that I shall not rest until evil has been vanquished, and you know I really really mean it because I have a determined look in my eye and I'm raising my right fist.""  Yeah.  In a book good enough to draw me in, I can overlook how overdone that kind of nonsense is.  But that's all this movie had.  Those actors had to have been rolling their eyes the entire time.

So there you have it.  It's beyond bad.  It's even beyond so-bad-it's-funny.  What it is, though, is a waste of $15.

I was really disappointed at the end, though, because the movie really leaves you wanting the rest of the story and there IS no next movie.

I got to watch this with my kids who are just starting to read the books for themselves.  It was fun to see them get interested in the storyline.

The CG looks like a rough draft of the final product...if the final product was produced 20 years ago.  It would be analogous to an artist's storyboard with stick figures instead of live actors.  I mean, at least have a character's legs move like they are walking instead of gliding across the screen because you don't want to make the effort because you can't miss CSI:Miami.  The traditional animation is poor, stilted and awkward.  They should re-do this one with a budget larger than $32.  I'm sure when the voice talent saw the final product they wanted to destroy all evidence of their participation.

3246675,1,B000Y7U996,"Dragons of Autumn Twilight (Will Meuginot, 2008)

Will Meuginot has done a great deal of work on Saturday morning television, and it shows. I knew this was coming. And I was pretty sure it was going to be terrible. But I just couldn't stop myself from watching it. I wish I had.

If you haven't read the books, the plot concerns a party of adventurers who reunite after five years travelling the world of Krynn looking for a sign that the gods have not forsaken them. Of course, as soon as they get back together (except one, who's mysteriously missing), the sign shows up, and along with it a horde of goblins, as well as the folks who have been controlling the goblins. Adventurers to the rescue! Yeah, it sounds cheesy, and let's face it, most fantasy is, but in the hands of a talented writer-- and Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, who wrote the original Dragonlance trilogy, are very talented writers-- it can tread that line between cheesiness and majesty and come up smelling like roses. In the hands of screenwriter George Strayton, who has worked on such fare as Cleopatra 2525 and Xena: Warrior Princess, it becomes about what we expect, a cheesefest. This is not helped any by the fact that the animation is crude (thus my Saturday morning TV reference above) and looks as if it were drawn mostly by horny thirteen-year-olds who've never had girlfriends. So, then, Saturday morning TV with a distressingly adult bent, though one cast through the lens of a juvenile fantasy life. It made me want to bang my head against the desk until I could no longer see. If you're a fan of the original novels, do yourself a favor and stay far, far away from this mess. If you're not, do yourself a similar favor and just read the novels. *",1227052800,6,1737,4.564102564102564

The voice actors all sucked.  The animation was terrible.  They stuck to bits of the story line but in the end did some weird crap.  We watched Paladine fight off Takhisis and then Laurana make out with Elistan.  In the book Laurana and Elistan always had more of a father daughter type relationship - he was her guide spiritually and she was his politically - and Tanis thought there was something more but there wasn't, Laurana only had eyes for Tanis until the 3rd book for only a moment when Tanis faces the Queen and Laurana believes that she has been betrayed.  What they did with Laurana and Elistan was disgusting and pointless.

3246679,2,B000Y7U996,"I've read all three Dragonlance books of the main trilogy and the first of the Lost Chronicles trilogy.  I'll give the movie credit that it stuck to the book's plot VERY well and any changes made were warranted due to the lack of screen time.  Still, the speed of the plot felt VERY rushed even with some scenes removed and some scenes felt almost comedic with the speed they were blazed through.  I did appreciate some of the extra scenes that were included for those who have read the entire DL Chronicles series (SPOILER ALERT: like the one scene where you find out Fizban is really Paladine).

I could have overlooked the mediocre 2D animation (I have an undying love for the old school) had the artists not have used any 3D.  The 3D work was very tacky since they had 3D monsters with textures and no outlines fighting 2D people with flat colors and outlines and it made for some very awkward battles.  It should have either been all 2D or the 3D should have been cell shaded to blend with the 2D characters better.  I also felt like the team overdid it on the lens flare filter.  Having some light training in the area, I could tell some scenes utilized filters from either Combustion or After Effects to save time and money on 2D animation and while I would have done it myself had I been working on this, it does cheapen the movie's feel and production value.

The orchestral score on the other hand was fabulous.  No real memorable riffs (like what appears in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or ""The Rock""), but you could tell money went into the music.  Voice acting is typical of your Saturday morning cartoon variety despite some heavy hitters in the cast.

Overall, this movie is worth a rental for the DL fan who read the Chronicles (like myself) and you'll probably never watch it again, but only really worth a purchase if you're the DL completist.  For those of you who did like it, Tracy Hickman has announced the movie has outsold its budget and the team is already in preproduction on the sequel.

The normal animation is poor, the CGI even worse, events are out of order with many missing and some from other books mixed in, and many people (especially Tass) are out of character.

If you're a DL fan you're gonna be disappointed. You'll wonder, ""Why did they bother?"" I mean, heaven help us if they do Legends!

I admire them for trying, but it really doesn't work. I can't imagine anyone watching this more than a couple times, then just putting it aside. Or selling it. Or trading it for a decent animation by Miyazaki

The storys ok. I guess. Its a simple straight forward plot - heroes go to Xak Tsaroth, face dragon, grab disks, back to Solace, then to Pak Tharkas to inspire rebellion among the slaves.

I think Tracy Hickman is right about them trying to cover too much ground in one short film. Maybe if the film covered up to the return to Solace as he wrote in his review

Maybe thats whats wrong

The less said about the animation, the better. Doesn't look so hot. Pretty embarassing that this is the best they could come with. I guess they were on a budget, but it looks cheap.

3246688,5,B000Y7U996,"Like some of the other reviewers, I read the books when they came out (wow, about 20+ years ago!) when I was in high school.  As I was a big fan of AD&D, it was an easy sell.  I liked them well emough to recommend to my younger cousins as great introductions to ""D&D type fantasy"" and the Dragonlance books became their introductions to the world of gaming by sparking further interest.  Suffice it to say, the books themselves are great, so the DVD had a lot to live up to.

That said, unlike the Lord of the Rings and similar fantasy (Elric saga, Amber Chronicles) inspirations for D&D products, material, and plots, the Dragonlance Chronicles are not books I have gotten around to re-reading as an experienced adult (eight year military career behind me, five kids, years as an engineer, researcher,  etc.) to see how my take on it has changed.  Despite that, I do remember how interesting I found the books as a kid, and how interesting two of my older boys found the chronicles too.  I bought this DVD with my younger son (3.5 years) in mind, hoping it wouldn't be too dumbed down or ""Disneyfied"" to take away the various violent acts inherent in real fantasy genre material, but also that as a cartoon, it wasn't made to be super violent and adult themed like the 1980 movie ""Heavy Metal"" (unlikely given the book, but you never know).

I wasn't disappointed.  There is plenty of violence to demonstrate the consequences of failure and the nature of the stuggle, but it isn't glorified or graphic.  Unlike the D&D cartoon of the 80s (which my friends and I all watched Saturday AM, typically before a day of playing AD&D), the Dragonlance DVD showed that swords, arrows, fireballs, daggers, dragons, etc. did more than knock people down and scare people out of the way.  Characters died, and there is cost to glory.  Even kids (well, my friends, me as a kid, my own kids at least) can be pretty cynical about a fantasy cartoon where no one really ever gets killed or even really hurt in an all out battle (and we watched the D&D and Thundar cartoons DESPITE this, not because of it, making more and more jokes about the non-lethality of the evil spells, sun swords, werewolves, Beholders, etc. as we got older).

To me, this makes it a cut above and beyond most fantasy cartoons (D&D, Thundarr, etc.), and something I am still OK with my younger kids seeing.  Also, because it is the way it is, it appeals to my older kids who are happy to sit through it with their youngest sibling.  Though there is some blood and death, the way it is integrated in the story line and not gratuitously focused on prevents it from being something disturbing to a younger child.  Maybe I am not in synch with the mainstream, but I think the ""GI Joe culture"" inherent in most kids cartoons where there is lots of shooting, violence, spells, stabbing, summoning, explosions, etc., but no injuries or death is more likely to give them warped views on the consequences than a cartoon that shows death and injuries are likely consequences of such acts (except in cases of Roadrunner, Daffy Duck, Pink  Panther etc., where it is obviously a contrived a comical situation).

From what I could remember, the DVD is a very accurate rendition of the Dragonlance storyline in the original book (remember my memories are 20+ years old though), and that is part of the appeal.  While circumstance prevents me from playing role playing games anymore, it is my hope that this stimulates interest in the fantasy genre for my youngest children so that they too can find enjoyment in the books and some of the games that have come to be based on it.

As such, the five stars are because I am reviewing it for being what it was bought for...a fantasy cartoon that accurately sums up an excellent book, capturing the spirit and appealing to the non ""techno afficianado"" fan.  It may have little problems, perhaps the technical execution of every animated frame wasn't perfect like the super high budget Pixar movies, but it isn't that kind of movie, and it doesn't have to be.  It is a good movie with broad D&D fan appeal and good for kids of all ages.  Bearing in mind thatI paid 13 (pounds), which equates to over $25, |I got screwed on the price paying as much as possible for it it really.  That said, I am not disappointed and think (based on replay value for my various kids) that it STILL is good value for money.

It is my hope that the other Dragonlance books in the series are adapted to a similar DVD.  I will buy every one for my kids (and can be convinced to watch it through one sitting with them without arm twisting).

Hope my review helps most of you who are considering the movie.  I can see why some of the die hards don't rate it five stars, but really, I think the expectations are unrealistically high.  For the most part, the DVD rated by an adult is unfairly compared to the impression the book made as a kid (when one was less jaded and cynical).  As an adult, one sees a lot of the flaws, that are never observed as a kid, and as such, it becomes an impossible standard to live up to.",1219017600,4,5080,4.4902173913043475

If there was a zero star rating -id give this movie that. A complete bastardization of the novel with iconic moments happening in the wrong location, major characters being left out of the story and even a romance that makes no sense between two formerly unrelated characters.

This movie takes the heart and soul of Dragonlance - the characters of the Heroes of the Lance - and spits in their face.  What a tagic disapointment at all levels.

3246693,4,B000Y7U996,"Based on the much acclaimed novel, Dragons of Autumn Twilight by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, the new Dragonlance movie of the same name is both a disappointment and a treasure. The novel Dragons of Autumn Twilight was an instant best seller starting off the Dragonlance series based in the fantastical realm of Krynn with all its dragons, wizards, and light handed kender. As the years have passed, the series has grown and expanded creating a uniquely complex and somewhat logical realm with a solid character base and a penchant for creativity. Along the way, Dragonlance has gained a vast audience of fans varying in ages from young to old. So, of course, it has long been expected that a movie encompassing the delightfully destructive realm of Krynn would be forthcoming. Twenty years later we get a straight to DVD low budget production that, despite the obvious lack of effort, still held a certain magical something that encapsulated the viewers' desperate dreams of dragons.
----------------------------------------------

The story sticks surprisingly close to the novel it was based upon, including all the major events and not deviating from the original storyline even slightly. It begins with rumors of a wicked army, ruled by the evil goddess Takhisis, amassing in the north, ready to end the 300 years of peace that has reigned over Krynn since the Cataclysm. This army has successfully awakened an ancient evil: dragons. Long thought to be creatures of legend, they have returned to Krynn and in the wake of their fiery breath, millions of innocent citizens are dying. But, the gods of good have not forsaken Krynn and in the wake of evil, they send a crystal staff that holds the key to salvation. As the battle between good and evil rages onward, a cast of unwary heroes joins to fight the darkness of dragons. Among these heroes are Tanis, a dispirited half elf who finds himself not only confused by the battle raging around him, but by the battle inside his heart, a heart wrenching emotional battle between two women that he loves and the inevitable choice he must make that will change everything. Also, not to be missed are the two brothers Majere, Raistlin, a sardonic wizard in training whose limited powers belie his heart of darkness and Caramon, his good natured brother. Along for the journey are two mysterious Plainsmen, Riverwind and his paramour Goldmoon, who possesses the staff gifted to her from the Gods. And, not to be forgotten, the grumpy but lovable old dwarf Flint and his kender sidekick whose good natured curiosity often slides into thievery. And, of course, not to be overlooked is Fizban, the doddery old wizard who just never can recall the correct incantation for that fireball spell. None of the beloved cast of characters, both good and evil, from the novel is left out and the viewer is delighted to finally meet their favorites in ""person.""

Unfortunately, the movie follows the novel so closely that it ends with a cliff hanger, as does the novel leaving the viewer somewhat unsatisfied since it is unlikely that a sequel will ever be made. The novel was originally followed by two sequels, Dragons of Winter Night and Dragons of Spring Dawning which concluded the drama and satisfied the reader. Since the movie did not contain the events that transpired in the novels mentioned above, there is no true conclusion but rather an ominous foreshadowing for the future well being of Krynn.

The characters, while represented by shoddy animation, were nevertheless presented appropriately, perfectly mirroring the characters in the novel. The voices chosen for each character were perfect, enabling the viewer to immerse themselves into the characters' personas even deeper. The main actors that lent their voice acting to the film are the ever talented Kiefer Sutherland, Lucy Lawless, and Michael Rosenbaum. In this presentation lies the beauty and the satisfaction of the movie. The major events that shocked and delighted the reader were presented magnificently, reminding the viewer vividly of the happy hours spent immersed in the novel. Likewise, the characters we have come to love are brought to a vivid life, drawing the viewer into the world of Krynn once again. Because of this seemingly incidental evocation of a realm we have come to love, the movie succeeds with the viewer despite its flaws.

But, what of the cons? Firstly, I must complain loud and long about the presentation of this film. We, the avid fans, have waited years for this moment when Dragonlance finally hit the big screen. So, image the instant irritation when I accidentally discovered this film, floating around aimlessly on Amazon. There was no press, no trailers, no effort. The movie was released without any pomp, going straight to DVD and into the realms of instant anonymity. Once I watched the film, I instantly realized why. Obviously, this film had a budget of approximately fifteen dollars; while the voice over actors who were hired were extremely talented, the animation was pure rubbish. I was not terribly pleased that the creators of the film choose animation. Why not take Dragonlance to the big screen, fill it with real actors and incredible effects such as the much acclaimed Eragon? Why must the film be relegated to the realms of animation? Animation is intended to amuse children, not to present a serious drama. That prejudice aside, the animation itself was the poorest quality that I have ever seen. It was stiff, jerky, and contained minimal details. It appeared more like a slow moving comic strip, with entire frames missing causing the film to be a jerky mess that hesitantly and unexpectedly jumped from frame to frame and scene to scene. Very, very poor Dragonlance. Must do better.

And what of the uninitiated viewer who has no pervious knowledge of the Dragonlance saga? If you discover yourself to be one of these individuals, then skip this film. The movie was obviously intended to please the adamant fan's need to collect more overpriced Dragonlance memorabilia. For those who are just looking for a fun fantasy adventure, the Dragonlance movie will prove more of a slapdash effort that follows a set pattern established by a novel that relied heavily on sequels. The ending will prove abrupt to those who are not familiar with the novels ending. If you are searching for a fun, but serious fantasy film then look elsewhere.

The special features included on the DVD are, like the entire production, sparse. They include the original test animation and the initial character design and nothing else. Once again, the creators opted for the inexpensive instead of the impressive.

To Watch or not to Watch?

With all its myriad flaws, the Dragonlance movie still proves an enjoyable sojourn into the wonderful realm of Krynn that will remind adamant Dragonlance fans of the long hours spent bent over the latest novel, dreaming of the characters and trying to out guess the authors' serpentine plot. For this reason, it is definitely worth watching for the already established Dragonlance fan. However, a viewer with no prior knowledge of this realm will be disappointed and instantly disinterested. Recommended to Dragonlance fans only.

When I saw the previews for this my stomach sank because of the animation. Nevertheless, I was going to buy it anyway because I hoped the storytelling would make up for that.  Was I wrong.  The story was altered and its horrible.  Key points were changed and driving the faith premise was untrue to the characters.  The voice talent may have been high caliber but the dialogue was lacking. The ending was weak and I know how the story was supposed to go.  This was a huge let down. I think I'll use the disc as a $10 coaster.",1216512000,3,698,4.2105263157894735

Which is a real shame because I have met the both of them at Gen Con and they seemed nice. Tracy's protestation to the contrary seem disingenuous given how obviously bad this thing is.

I got the impression that the script writer was given an outline of major plot points and given free reign as to how to get there. The dialog is stitled, the voice acting (from a cast I had high hopes for) were clearly phoned in. On the other hand, the music was well done.

3246700,1,B000Y7U996,"Where to start??? If you have ever read the original Dragonlance novels please save yourself the distress that comes with viewing this movie, unless your masochistic....then rent it.

1) The animation is awful. It is reminiscent of bad 80's animation fused with horrible CG work and is also jerky looking. However, I could have forgiven the animation if the story line had been decent.

2) They took a movie that probably could have been adequately done in 3 hours and shoved it into 90 minutes. The movie starts off following the original story line, then in an attempt to make it fit into 90 minutes veers completely off course. There was very little character development, virtually no background info regarding the characters was shown and important points in the plot (that would have been relevant to a sequel) were totally omitted. It's like they put in the first few chapters of the book then just jump to the last chapter in an effort to end it in time.

3) Pet peeve: What's up with the Forest Master being covered in vines??? Seriously! Was she attacked by Swampthing or something?!?!?

I could probably continue to rant about the other offenses this movie has to offer such as: the terrible voice acting, inconsistencies and mediocre script. However, I believe I have covered the important points.

Now that we finally have a movie, I'm reminded of how bad the LOTR animated movie was before LOTR was redone by Peter Jackson.  It also reminds me of ""The Hobbit"".  That movie was very poorly done.

Although animated films of some of our favorite stories fall way short, they still can remind us how great the stories are/were.  I'd recommend this to all my friends who enjoyed DL because in my mind it makes the stories from the books shine.  Someday maybe we'll have movies that do the same.",1214179200,,670,4.533333333333333
3246702,1,B000Y7U996,"The book Dragons of Autumn Twilight, is an excellent fantasy novel rich in storytelling and character development.  This adaptation is the exact opposite.

One of the key element that makes the books so intriguing is the character development.  The books weave an intricate backstory for each character.  You can argue that the characters are caricatures of common fanatsy types, but the books do an excellent job developing these individuals.

Not so for this movie... not even close.  Tanis, the reluctant leader of the band is just another member of the group.  Raistlin, the most complex of the group, is reduced to a mere mage.  What could easily fill a 3-hour long movie is instead butchered and crammed into 90 minutes of terribly-paced story-telling.  Key character plot points are also lost:  For those who have read the book, there are just a few key plot points missing:  Bupu makes only a slight appearance, Kitiara is barely mentioned as relevant, the entire backstory of the blue crystal staff bringing hope to Krynn is lost, the Forestmaster isn't mentioned, the complex relationship between Tanis and Raistlin, Tanis and Laurana, Caramon and Raistlin... heck every single complex relationship in the book is trivialized into a 5 second sound bite, if it is even mentioned at all.

Additionally, this cartoon looks no better than the average 80s Saturday morning cartoon.  In fact, in many places, the animation was awkward.  With the technology available today, I am amazed that they released a product of such low quality.  They literally should be ashamed.

I am a huge fan of Dragonlance, and perhaps my fan-dom makes me more critical of this movie.  After all, I consider Dragonlance part of my youth.  But in all honesty, this movie was simply terrible.  It's a waste of money and time.  Skim the book in 90 minutes instead.  You'll come up with a much better movie in your head.",1213920000,5,1900,4.930599369085174
3246703,3,B000Y7U996,"I have read all the major books in the original DRAGONLANCE series and a few of the sinoffs, though I did lose interest in the series after the second trilogy. I did thoroughly enjoy the first trilogy, the first book of this is upon which this movie is based.

As such, like most people who have read the book before the movie comes out, I had some disappointment in this film. As a ninety-one minute film, it would have been impossible to include everything from the book faithfully represented here. However, certain things from the book were changed for the film to the point that they were entirely different: the rescue of the children in Pax Tharkas, the final battle with Verminaard and others were changed completely from how they transpired in the book. This was a bit of a problem for me. Other events from the book were left out entirely, likely due to time constraints.

The animation was good, in most places and the filmmakers seem to have combined CGI with traditional animation techniques, even including Japanese-style illustrations for the scene showing the pegusus and unicorns.

The dialogue did well in its attempt to capture the moods of the main characters. The initial distrust and tension between some of the characters did come through in the film. However, some of the dialogue did reach beyond the limits of drama to become so corny as to be downright intolerable for me to listen and I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the dialogue, especially from Tanis during the battle with Verminaard. More like Saturday morning cartoons than it should have been.

If the filmmakers had wanted, they could have made this into a full-length film, rather than the ninety-one minute treatment they gave it. With all the bad three-hour long films that have come out recently, DRAGONLANCE had all the elements needed to create a thoroughly-enjoyable film for all ages, yet was given what seemed to be halfhearted devotion from the filmmakers this time around.

What does give me some hope is that a new generation of DRAGONLANCE fans may be created after having seen this movie and becoming interested enough to buy the books for themselves. If/ when that occurs, they will be exposed to the beautiful world of Krynn and all the tragedy, beauty and thrill that it provided to me and to many others.

I would not recommend any fans of the book series' to rent or buy this film. However, I would recommend it to anyone who has not read the books, so that they could see for themselves a little of what DRAGONLANCE offered its readers over the years.",1213488000,,2566,4.72930648769575

I have watched several English dubs of Anime (Japanese animation) and given that context this film is even worse than most people think!

For those not familiar with Anime try watching The Twelve Kingdoms or Moribito. Hasbro should hand the license over to Kenji Kamiyama and let him run with it.

I felt that these characters that I grew to love just got butchered by bad animation and cheesy fight scenes.  Tasslehoff was more on par with Jar Jar Binks than the hero I read about in the books.  I just wished they would've spent more time on this.  It would be so much more worth it if they took 15 years on making a quality product than this insult.  I am not even angry about how horrible this movie is, I actually feel like I was in mourning after watching this.

So I was a bit apprehensive about a film being made from it since most books are lost in the translation to film.  This, however, was not the case for Dragons of Autumn Twilight.  The personalities of the characters are what I had imagined for the most part, but more importantly the most important scenes from the book are transported almost verbatim to the film.  Bravo!",1208390400,3,468,4.344827586206897
3246722,1,B000Y7U996,"Wow... just wow.

I read these books when I was in high school in the 80's.  So I was pretty excited to hear that they were making an animated version.  Luckily, I just rented this from Blockbuster instead of just buying it sight unseen as I had originally planned.

As a HUGE fan of the Dragonlance series, to say that this movie was a disappointment is a massive understatement.  It is bad on so many levels.  The voice actors are terrible.  Keifer Sutherland as Raistlin is the ONLY voice that is decent.  I like Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor on Smallville, but he is TERRIBLE as Tanis.  And whoever the guy is that does the voice for Flint, he needs to just hang it up and get another job.

The animation is barely passable as Saturday morning cartoon fare.  It is literally some of the worst animation I have ever seen.

I realize that they're trying to cram a lot of material into 90 minutes, but the screenplay is so disjointed that it seems like you're just watching a bunch of vignettes and not a single cohesive story.

Also, maybe it was just the DVD that I got, but everything was blurry.  It gave me a headache to watch.  I almost turned it off a few times because of this.

To sum up, this movie was terrible.  I can't think of a single positive comment to make.  If they make any more, I doubt I'll even bother to watch them.  At least the books are still good.",1208217600,4,1378,4.291828793774319

Too bad they couldn't have made it in cgi a little more like a ""beowulf"" instead of the bland cartoon fill of a ""thundar the barbarian"" saturday morning cartoon. All the depth and sequences that made the novels such an epic is truly lost in this movie.  It felt extremely rushed and I kept wishing for peter jackson to suddenly pop up on the screen and tell us all that he's redoing dragonlance into a major motion picture like he did in LOTR.  well... that's my fantasy I guess.  :)",1208044800,2,574,4.336448598130841

3246729,3,B000Y7U996,"I had a really hard time watching this movie.  Perhaps I went into it biased after reading the reviews.  Perhaps I've read the books too many times to enjoy the movie.  I don't know, but I'm glad that I rented instead of purchased.
I don't feel that the characters look much like what is seen in Art of Dragonlance.  Those are the images I see when I read the books.  The mix of animation and CGI is just plain terrible.  To that point, if the dragons were going to be CGI anyway, do a live action film!  I guess that's what I've always hoped for in the first place.  It was done with LOTR, why not Dragonlance?
Back to the movie itself, they messed with the story line and changed things a bit.  That always irks me in movies based on books.  Somehow, some of the best parts and many times important aspects of the story are always cut.  Condensing the part about Pax Tharkas didn't bother me too much, the general idea was intact.  But, when Gilthanas and the Companions are rescued by Porthios, the storyline becomes too mangled.  Laurana's immaturity/naivety is portrayed poorly.  Also, there is no spy aspect and the entire Sla Mohri is a joke.  They find the secret passage and it leads them directly to the slaves and their open prison door.  Too easy and way less exciting (No Green Gemstone Man either).
The voice acting is very good.  Keifer Sutherland as Raistlin is superb, although he wasn't well written.  He seemed too nice and his relationship with Tanis was too friendly.  Much of the dialog sounded cheesy.  Fizban was also not portrayed as the befuddled mage we all know and love.  He was too ""there"".  You also find out his true identity at the end of the movie.
If you really want to see the movie (to get it out of your system), rent it cheap, see if you can get it from the library, whatever.  I would not recommend purchasing the movie unless it can be found somewhere for $1.",1206576000,,1900,4.412103746397695

Yes, it was not the film I hoped for after 15 years of waiting but I'm not sure any single film short of a Rings style epic could have done this much better.

3246733,2,B000Y7U996,"This review won't be as positive as the others.  While I see even the great Tracy Hickman came to make a review I have to do this to warn those of you who loved the books as much as myself.

First of all, like other reviews, the animation was awful.  The non-draconic animation reminded me of Hanna Barbara animation.  I didn't like that the dragons were CGI and not the rest of the characters.  It made me feel like the Companions were looking at a blue screen while they were drawn.  One style or the other should have been chosen.

Secondly, many of the supporting cast characters were removed entirely.  While the traitor who was making Gilthanas look bad might not have been important I thought removing Berem, the green gemstone man, was a huge mistake since he is a big part of the series.

Most of all, I thought what they did with Fizban was horrible.  This is a major spoiler so if you have not read the Chronicles please stop reading this paragraph.  Fizban was not supposed to directly help the companions!  That was the irony of his little absentminded nuisances.  But in the movie he deliberately takes action against the forces of evil and saves the day at least once.  This was not how Weis and Hickman wrote the Chronicles.  Those like Fizban were not suppose to take direct part in the War.  They might give a little nudge but only in the most indirect way.  I was very diappointed that the old storyteller was removed and Fizban was put in to do both parts.  Yes, they were supposed be the same being but we didn't find that out until the third book.  Plus I loved the foreshadowing that the storyteller did in the books by moving the tables around.  Alot of little things like that really made the books jump out as I read them.  The movie had none of that.  I also didn't like the how the viewer found out who Fizban was at the end of the movie.  This is telling me that the producers of the movie feel like they will not be able to get the backing to make the next two.  Even so, that should have been left out because Fizban is to return several times and the character will not be the same to those who hadn't read the books.

While I will admit that some scenes in the book could not be placed in the movie because of time restraits, I missed things like the ""death on black wings"" story Riverwind told and the Wicker Dragon head with little legs hanging out the mouth.  I also didn't like how Tanis's faith was the main reason the dragonlord was vanquished.  Tanis's faith is tested throughout the trilogy and it was not his faith alone in the old gods that allowed the companions to overcome the villian.

If you haven't read the books, then by all means watch the movie, but I believe you will be only getting half the story.  If you are a diehard dragonlance fan like me though...beware.",1206230400,5,2816,4.361538461538461
3246734,2,B000Y7U996,"I desperately wanted to like this. It has a special place in my heart as the first series of books I ever read without being forced to do so.

The Pros: The overall story remains pretty true to the novel. The voice acting is decent. It prompted me to go back and start re-reading the series for the first time in over a decade. The CGI is done well in some parts (mostly the title scene)

The Cons: The animation is truly horrible. It makes the movie painful to watch. The 'integration' of CGI and traditional animation clashes horribly and is very distracting. The traditional animation is choppy, inconsistent, and distracting.

The Bottom Line: If, like me, DragonLance was a milestone of your youth and you will not be able to rest well until you've watched it, rent it. It's not going to ruin those pleasant memories. Just be warned that it will be a painful experience. If this will be your first experience with this great trilogy, do yourself a massive favor and skip it. Read the book instead. If you don't have time to read the book, try to find it as an audiobook. Do not let this be your introduction to the series.",1206144000,4,1127,4.461165048543689

The title itself really expresses how I feel about this Movie.  I read the other reviews commenting on it, but I thought: ""Maybe they just didn't enjoy the book as much as I did.""  Unfortunately now I have seen that in general, the other reviews I read were actually being somewhat kind in their opinions.

I ask the animation director, ""What happened?""  That is all I really want to know.  Tell me you sent them the wrong copy to be pressed.  Tell me that you actually had another one that was much better, and instead you sent them one from about 6 months earlier that was just slightly better than static story boards.

For its part, the movie was pretty true to the story in the original book.  Although some parts were left out that I thought could fleshed it out so much more.

I think it would be wishful thinking to think they would come out with the 2nd book as a movie adaptation.  But I will hold out hope that they will, so they could hopefully redeem the tarnished name that is the Dragonlance Chronicals.",1205884800,3,1203,4.345291479820628
3246737,1,B000Y7U996,"When I saw this DVD in the store I had to buy it because I have been waiting for this series to get made into a movie for so very long. I knew from just looking at the packaging it was likely going to dissapoint, but I just HAD to see it for myself.

It was excruciating.

The narrative was horrible and rushed, with a terribly inept attempt to explain the world we were about to witness and how it worked. In fantasy, this is death. I must be made to understand the world and how it applies to what I am watching. How are the rules different? What drives people. What is the history behind the story I am watching? All terribly done here.

The characterizations were terrible. Am I truly to believe everyone in Kryn speaks with a standard American accent from the 21st century? No difference between how the plainsmen talk and how the residents of Solace talk? No difference for the elves? For Sturm as a Solamnic knight? Fizban was hardly what one could call befuddled in any sense of true acting. Raistlin, the driving force of interest behind the entire series, was played poorly with too strong of a voice, and far too little emotional interplay and development with the others. He and Tas barely interact with Fizban at all, even though their interplay is supposed to set up the running storyline with that character for the rest of the series. The magic was so terribly executed visually and so untrue to the world of Dragonlance as to be laughable.

And the complete ruining of the Fizban storyline suspense at the end was inexcusable. The suspense regarding who Fizban is and how he fits in to everything is suposed to be sustained for a majority of the series, and they blow it at the end of the very first movie. Now the character is worthless emotionally for the remainder of the story because the mystery is completely gone, and there was never any emotional attachment established between that character and any of the remainder of the party.

I only hope this terrible effort is like the Lord of the Rings animated effort was before the Lord of the Rings series was made properly by Peter Jackson as opposed to the final say on the visualization of the world of Kryn. The story deserves better.",1205712000,5,2209,4.526315789473684
3246738,1,B000Y7U996,"It's unfortunate that a strong story like the Chronicles series gets a very heavy handed treatment in this animated film.  I'm surprised it was even released, but they should really take this film and bury it.

I tried to like this film and watch it through, but I couldn't.  The animation might be the worst I've seen...ever.  Everything looks vaguely like old episodes of He-man, but worse.  Characters don't move smoothly, and action sequences are downright embarrassing.  The sad thing is that the poor animation becomes so distracting that you can't concentrate on the story or even tell if the voice acting is any good.

I never would have thought that a movie version of these books could be this terrible, but it is and people should stay away. Buy the books, they're amazing.",1205193600,7,784,4.8059701492537314

Unfortunately for us fans, the director and animators didn't seem to like the story one bit. The animation was lackluster even compared to day to day cartoons. The pace of the action was very slow, the art didn't do it any justice. I am sorry for the voice actors as they lend their talent for such lacking products. It is possible that they spent too much money in the voice talent and dropped the ball using a less than qualified animation studio. Very very unfortunate. Not even the CGI looked appealing.

I don't criticize this product for being a purist. I criticize it by comparing it with similar products and other animations. If you want to see a good D&D animated video, skip this one and pick up Record of Lodoss War, the original 13 chapters. Its not from the Dungeons and Dragos family, but its what any D&D animator should look up to! You will have a better time.",1204588800,8,963,4.440677966101695

The voices used sounded more like boys who are going through their voice change than adventurers! The animations just are cheesy especially the draconians. The draconians didn't move half the time and just glided across the screen. They were done in a completely different style than the rest of the movie. It looked as if they started designing the draconians in detail then decided it wasn't worth the work, gave up, and didn't do it in any other part of the movie. The way the rest of the movie was done was more reminiscent of the cartoons when I was little when they all looked hand drawn. Poorly done movie.

It took me several tries to force myself to watch all of this, as I shut it off the first few times after a few minutes. The animation is actually painful to watch as it is jumpy and jerky, plus very poorly drawn. It looks like very badly done Flash animation most of the time. Also the addition of the full CGI fire, draconians, and dragons makes it all the jarring and out of sorts. The story is rushed and the voice acting is terrible.

The movie decided to keep to the book's dialogue as much as possible, which is usually a poor choice when converting from written word to spoken.  While the voice acting was admirable and well performed, the exchanges were painful to hear. Further, the decision to meld very poorly done 'hand drawn' animation with equally poorly rendered computer graphics made for an eyesore.

And yet, the power of nostalgia is strong.  Seeing Tanis banter with Flint, Taz helpfully borrow everyone's items, and Tika's curvaceous body saunter around did kindle a small spark of enjoyment.

I checked out the reviews on amazon and was instantly reluctant to watch it, as if I did, it would just ruin a time of my childhood for ive wanted this film to be made for 20 years or so and the reviews were not as i hoped.  The movie sat at my house for 3 days before i had the courage to watch it for fear it would just be a jacked up and just plain trash.

Raistlin's robes, eyes, personality, well they are beyond great.  i don't know why the film was made or the budget or any of that but what i do know is that this film is, honestly speaking one of my drams coming to be.

3246755,3,B000Y7U996,"Let me start by saying I am a fan of the Dragonlance Series and was probably going to purchase the DVD anyway. However, I did read the review offered by Tracy Hickman and was glad I did read it before I made my purchase and viewed the DVD. His explanation of the (low) quality of the animation was right on and alleviated me the despair I would have endured if I was not prepared. Similarly, his explanation that the movie should have been done in two parts also allowed me to more accepting of the hurried and choppy flow of the movie. Character development is not what it probably should be and that may be due to the length of the film and them trying to get a lot of information into a 90 minute movie. Again, I see Mr. Hickman's point.

Even with all of that, I am still a fan of the series and will purchase the next installation. Knowing how long it took for LOTR to come to big screen, I am willing to wait for that to happen with Dragonlance and will support the animated version(s) until that time occurs.

I would caution newcomers to the Dragonlance world to either read the book first or watch the movie with someone who is intimately knowledgeable about the Dragonlance series. They will be able to fill in some of the details and character development that the animated movie was not able to accomplish due to the short length of the movie.

As I said before, I would have purchased the move anyway and hope that fans of the series also purchase it as well. Hopefully, that will send a message to the filmakers that there is an audience for this genre and cause them to put more money into the next production as well as take the writers suggestions into consideration. And, who knows, maybe there might be a live action film somewhere in the future. Some of the casting ideas found on YouTube have been quite intriguing.

Good luck!",1203292800,2,1848,4.394736842105263
3246756,2,B000Y7U996,"Dragonlance has been around since the 80's. It was the third campaign setting ever published by TSR, which has long since become a subsidiary of Hasbro, the company known as Wizards of the Coast.

Back when it first came out, I thought it was a pretty cool world, although back then I was only into the World of Greyhawk.

Despite that, I do remember buying the modules and reading them, as well as the very first Dragonlance Trilogy.

When you take into account how many novels I've read over the decades that have ensued since, it's no wonder that I barely remember any details about the novels, except that I thought that they were pretty good despite having similarities to other fantasy novels.

But, I've said that before in many of my reviews, there is nothing new under the sun, only different ways old stories and characters are presented.

So, about a year ago, I heard that Wizards of the Coast had a movie based on Dragons of Autumn in the works. At first, I thought that it was a live action movie, and that some fairly famous actors were involved in it.

Keither Sutherland, Lucy Lawless and Michael Rosenbaum all had roles in the movie. It wasn't until only a few months back that I learned that this movie was not live action. Instead it was a combination of computer animation and more traditional cell animation.

I figured, hey, cool! Since the first Dungeon and Dragons movie was an atrocity, and the direct to DVD sequel wasn't all that much better, I had high hopes that this movie would do well, because it was done in a less demanding medium.

So, when it was released on DVD a few short weeks ago, I went out of my way to try and find it. I should have realized that something was amiss when I only managed to track down one copy of it just last week.

I finally had a chance to sit down and watch it with my wife and we were both disappointed in it.

For starters, I found that the animation was sub-standard. I've seen better animation on the cartoons that my son typically watches on Teletoon or on Saturday mornings.  What really struck me and made me laugh out loud was that during the very poorly drawn battle scenes, there was next to no blood. Goblins and people were stabbed with swords, but when the weapons were withdrawn, there wasn't any blood on them.

And yet some of the female characters `ahem' assets were very well portrayed and even shown to bounce up and down enticingly at least once.

Then there was the computer animation. Again, I've seen better animation on weekly shows, such as back in the day, Reboot and Babylon 5. Even Tripping the Rift had better animation.

To make matters worse, the traditional animation and the computer animation wasn't meshed cleanly. It was too obvious and very poorly done.

This leads me to believe that most of the budget for the movie was probably used to pay to get the better named actors to provide the voices for the characters.

Things seemed far too rushed in my view. Characters were introduced, and in at least one case, one was introduced right near the beginning of the movie and promptly never heard of again.

I didn't get any feel for these characters at all. Maybe if the movie had been drawn out into a mini series of 6 or more half hour episodes, it would have been better. Even when a prime character seemed on the verge of death, I was like `eh, no big deal, he dies, he dies.'

That's not right!

I should actually give a damn about the characters, especially since I was already at least somewhat familiar with them (although, two decades since I read the first trilogy, my memory of these characters is at best, vague.)

That being said, I would have to guess that this was supposed to be the first in a trilogy of movies, or maybe the lead into a potential TV series. When you consider how cheap the animation is, I'd have to guess that the latter is more likely the case.

Now, the question begs to be asked. Would I recommend this movie to anyone?

I'm sorry to say, but no. The only way I'd recommend it to anyone is if I knew that they were huge fans of Dragonlance. Even then I'd be hesitant to do so, as they would probably be even more disappointed in the DVD than I was.

Finally, the additional features on the DVD were minimal at best. Character concepts and test animation, and of course trailers for upcoming movies.

So, when it comes to the bottom line, don't waste your time.

I am A Huge Dragonlance Fan. When the original Dragons of Autumn Twilight came out back In 1984 (I think), I only started playing AD&D
I Read the book in 1986 and all Six Dragonlance Chronicles & Legends by 1989.
To Say I am a fan would be an understatement. Today I am 37.5 , I read more than 100,000 books in my life, most of them Science Fiction & Fantasy, but many others as well. Still, of all the books I've read in my entire life, Dragonlance Chronicles & Legends were the ones that touched me the most. I am not sure I will ever be touched reading a book the same way ever again in my life. I also read many other Weis & Hickman Books, but their greatest masterpiece is definitely Dragonlace Chronicles & Legends. In my Personal Opinion they outrank Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings by far and wide, as well as any other from the thousands of fantasy books I've read. Obviously I was immensely excited when I heard a movie of my favourite books ever was coming out. However this movie is so bad - such a joke made out of a masterpiece - It is Simply Terrible.
**** I recommend Staying Away **** - Read The Original Books - They are a true gem of literature in general & Fantasy In Particular",1203206400,9,1205,4.216450216450217
3246758,1,B000Y7U996,I so wanted this to be good.  In many ways this was as bad as the live action DND movie.  Very sorry to have to say I was disappointed.,1203120000,7,135,3.6206896551724137
3246759,3,B000Y7U996,"Ok, I've read most of the Dragonlance books that have been released.  I have a huge paperback collection.  So I approached this video with a little  hesitation, I didn't want to be disappointed.  Plus I have viewed a lot of animation in my life and I think I know what looks good.  I'll just give my opinion of what worked and what didn't in this video.

Pros-  Almost intact story and portrayal of characters.  This was the first  book of the series, so it was basic and there wasn't a lot of character development.  There are 7 companions, which is a lot of characters to develop, not to mention the antagonists as well.  Good introduction to the characters and world, but need to have sequels to further develop characters.  The art is colorful and nicely drawn.  The musical score is very nice as well and gives an appropriate mood to the story.  It is also nice that it tries to appeal to an older audience by having some slightly adult humor in it (gotta love Tika's curves) and bloodshed, although the blood was a little late (the first fight is bloodless even though many goblins are slain).

Cons-  With this being the first video adaption of this huge storyline, I think it should have offered more than what it is.  The producers should have targeted an audience unfamiliar with the story as well as avid readers.  Although nicely drawn, the animation was very choppy and it almost makes my eyes hurt to watch.  I think the computer animation should have been limited to backgrounds and special effects and not integrated 3d characters with 2d, it just looks tacky.  There were a few pieces missing that to me were important to the story.  All I have to say is that the Xak Zaroth part is missing a very important event and is way too cut.  To make up for the unfamiliar story for non-initiates to Krynn, way more special features should have been added.  All they give is a little bit about how the animation was done.  I don't care about that, a little background about the characters would have been nice, or something pertaining to the story.  If there is a sequel, and Wizards of the Coast would be ignorant if they didn't try to fix this, it needs to have more to offer and not be so messy.",1203120000,,2207,4.471177944862156
3246760,4,B000Y7U996,"while this movies isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, it is a a horrible movie either.  I am a huge DragonLance fan and had high hopes for this movie. While I found the old 80's style animation to be of good quality the over laying of obvious CGI with it created a harsh and distracting contrast.  The story is missing a few scenes that i would have liked to have seen but i can understand them being left out for the sake of not having a 3-4 hour movie.  The one scene that actually got me mad was in the caged wagon where Fizban used knock instead of fireball to escape the cell, this change had no real purpose, took away from a running joke within the book, and needlessly changed one of my favorite scenes in literature.  The story was great though a bit rushed, but what do you expect from such an excellent book.  while i have listed several gripes about the movie there were none that were so bad that they made me unable to enjoy the movie.",1203120000,,962,4.2349726775956285

My imagination ran wild with excitement- I smiled as I thought of Bupu's encounter with Raistlin, chuckled as I thought of Caramon bashing two goblin heads together, and drooled over Goldmoon's healing hands.  When the trailer came out, I knew I was in for a world of hurt, so I prepared myself well for when I finally recieved the finished copy.
As a fan, I was still happy to see the companions together again, but was very disheartened by the poor animation quality and a few departures from characters I witnessed throughout the movie.  For example, Tas was no longer a child-like innocent ""handler"" we all love, but became some kind of cocky teenager with annoying remarks about his ego.  I brought this dvd home with me to share with my brothers who are also fans of the book, but I could not allow them to watch it with their spouses because I am sure that those who are not familiar with the original story would not understand, nor care for, the story after they see this movie.
I bought this dvd because I am a fan of the books, however, I refuse to share this movie with anyone unless they've already read the books- I fear them equating our classic fantasy novel with this cheesy animated movie.

I almost expected He-man to pop out somewhere and give a hand while the Transformers blew something up in the background. The story is disjointed and as a big fan of the novels I couldn't help but scream"" But what about such and such or wheres this part"".
The voice talent seems to have been wasted on lack luster art work and very poor scripting.

The characters were lacking and they kind of turned it into a somewhat lame game type of a movie but other than that it was alright. i would only recommend this too fans of the book to compare to the book but other than that its just suited for children rather than adults who have never read the books.

If the people that maid this film put a little more effort in to it they could come up with something really spectacular. I hated the way they maid it seem like every thing only took a day or two.

3246767,2,B000Y7U996,"I had high expectations on this book to screen adaptation. Perhaps those high expectations were clouded by the brilliant Jackson's Tolkien adaptation or even the latest Asterix DVD release.

The Good:
The characters' ""characters and characteristics"" are in-tact, they ""look"", ""feel"" and ""sound"" as what, as best as one could expect, as the book describes.

It feels so right having Kiefer Sutherland supplying Raistlin's voice. And Lucy could do no wrong with Goldmoon. Wonder who gets Kitiara and Dalamar the Dark?

The Bad and the Ugly:
The animation is sub-standard; there was little creative progress from the Dungeons and Dragons cartoon of the 80s. The colours and tone turned up to be well below par. In times of ""darkness"", the smart use of shades and colours would have helped potray not only the moods of the characters but the surroundings as well.

Mixing the dragons/draconians CGI to animation? Nope, did not quite work. Turned out to be a sad case of using the right technology at the wrong place.

Maybe it is ""just"" for such adaptation to be in full CGI version...after all, Dragonlance is, dare I say (and in process may incur the wrath of the Tolkien loyalists), the greatest fantasy epics of all time!

3246768,2,B000Y7U996,"Dragonlance has the best animation that 1993 has to offer.  The only problem, of course, is that this is 2008. Therefore this product is ridiculous.

I read the books 20 years ago alongside everyone else and devoured them.  As a story, Dragonlance the DVD compresses the event fairly economically and the jist of the situation gets across.  Looked upon with a straight eye, a great deal of what happens in Chronicles Volume 1 is irrelevant: the finding of Kith Kanan, the excessive encounter with the gully dwarves, etc, and this DVD rightly disposes of all that, leaving the pure meat and bones of the original story.  Perhaps too well, as I didn't realize until now how little of a story Autumn Twilight has.  Compared to the Tower of the High Clerist and the Battle of Palanthas, almost nothing of note here is significant except the death of Verminaard.  The DVD cant be blamed for that, but it can be blamed for cutting out what Autumn Twilight did have, characterization.  This DVD clocks in at 90 minutes on the nose, meaning its length was arbitrarily chosen.  A WORLD of good would have resulted by just giving another 5 minutes, spread out here and there, in character pieces to explain Sturms past, Raistlins illness and the tension with his brother, etc etc.  The story barrels along from this to that to that with no time for introspection or breathcatching, and you can watch the whole thing still wondering what the big deal was.  The breakneck pace sabotages the ending, where the Red Dragons Ember and Pyrite have their fight to the death, a poignant point in the books just dropped like a bag of potatoes here.

In fact every dragon in the world is ill-served, as despite living in a world without dragons, they are given here as ""well golly, its a dragon,"" with absolutely ZERO build up or suspense or shock and awe that the situation demands, a disaster that can only be blamed on an unimaginative director.  Onyz has zero surprise, Ember has zero characterization.  And the characters have no surprise about either one.  Unenjoyable.

All that, and we haven't even gotten to the animation yet.
What on Earth were they thinking?  This is TWENTY YEARS out of date.  The drawing is rough, the movements are sloppy, and the animation painfully old.  If BARBIE can generate a half dozen PURE CGI movies over the last 3-4 years (just ask my daughter), then it boggles the mind that Dragonlance couldn't crank out at least one.

Granted it wasn't one of my favorites but it was pretty darn good i thought especially for a cartoon. As with most books the movies can never even compare and from all the bad reviews i suspect this is especially true here.

As far as the animation i thought it was good and plenty violent enough which was also good because it ads a bit more realism to the story. I actually found myself disappointed when it ended because i enjoyed watching it and didn't want it to end. I hope they will make another in the future.

3246771,1,B000Y7U996,"Let me start by saying like many wizard and dragon loving youth of the 90's I first was introduced to Fantasy literature via the Dragonlance Chronicles. That being said, I knew logically that any production based on this work and being animated was more than likely going to suck. Well, seeing as they added Kfiefer Sutherland as Raistlin I didn't think it could be too bad, I mean the guy is doing good with 24 series, so I didn't think he was hard up to play the role - or maybe he was a big fan himself.

Well folks, wait no longer my verdict: it's bad. The story moves at a clunky, hyperactive pace. It's a major setback in getting people sold on the idea of making any of the fantasy based franchises into movies themselves. As well, the graphics went from normal animation to all dragons being CGI - CGI that looked worse than Transformers Beast Wars - a combination which lent itself to horrid on screen action.

My biggest beef with the movie was it could not decide what audience to aim at - the kiddies who want to see wizards and dragons - with shallow characters and simple plot lines and little graphic violence - or the adult fan base who wanted to see violence and epic battles.

So, on the scale of Franchise to Film adoption between Spiderman and CatWoman, I score this a ""Daredevil"". It looks like the screen writers took their basic outline of the book and popped it on screen, and made shoddy connections between major storylines in the book. I would suggest only renting this if you have Netflix and can order more than one movie at a time.",1202601600,7,1561,4.43205574912892

3246773,2,B000Y7U996,"While I am glad that the Dragonlance Chronicles are finally being adapted to the screen.  I am ashamed that this is what is being presented to the public.  Dragon Magazine once said of the Chronicles that at last fantasy fans have something to read after the Tolkien books.  This story has spawned dozens of ancillary novels and a roleplaying game.  I would argue that they is more well-known and more well-loved than ""The Golden Compass"" or ""Stardust"" and those got a decent theatrical treatment.  I can only hope that New Line or Walden Media take a look at the Chronicles and realize how wonderfully they could be adapted to a screen trilogy.  Barring that, maybe Joss Whedon or J.J. Abrams will turn them into a TV series (six seasons, guarranteed).

Since first reading Dragons of Autumn Twilight back in 1986, I have held a deep-felt love for the companions of the lance and their adventures in Krynn.  The Chronicles Trilogy would and should make an exciting and endearing trilogy of film adaptations.  Sadly, this animated attempt was a truely pathetic attempt to adapt the Weiss and Hickman novel.  The combination of cell and computer animation did not mix well at any level.  The draconians...oh, those horribly rendered draconians that moved like figures from a 1998 video game cinematic.  The entire thing would have been better as a cell animation piece.  However, even the quality of that was on the same level as any animated series from the early '80s.

The film makers added some very contrived elements to the story, like the gods of good and evil actually battling each other as dragon vs. warrior and the villainous Lord Verminaard having constant conversations with his evil goddess from the outset of the film so that we know that , ""Yep, he's the bad guy alright.""  By contrived I mean unnecessairly diverting from the novel.  Don't misjudge me, I fully expect a filmmaker to edit the written work to bring the story to the screen.  But, what was added was pointless.  The story line took big leaps and jumps and none of the characters were flushed out well at all.  There were ""adult"" moments where men are distracted by women's ""attributes"" and goblins, etc. are stabbed (but no blood).  Go ahead and make it PG-13, the novel was!  The entire thing felt like it was rushed together in about two weeks.

The voiceovers from such well-heeled actors as Kiefer Sutherland and Lucy Lawless are at times well-done, but at others are pathetically phoned in.  This is especially true whenever someone is speaking magic words or elven/dwarven phrases.  They suddenly slip out of the characters voice and it becomes someone ordering from a take-out menu. The end also smacks of a missionary effort to help the faithless find religion.  Again, unnecessary and badly done in the attempt.",1202601600,3,2801,4.846315789473684

I did like most of the Characterdesign of the Heroes with the exception of Raistlin. Voices its the same, all quite well only Raistlin I didn't like that well. Maybe its because Raistlin is my favorite character...
What I really didn't like was the computeranimation of Dragons and Draconians. They are to computery and kind of don't fit in the picture. I really didn't like the style of the animation of the pictures itself. This ""static movement"" animation (don't know how to discribe it better) really ruined the experience for me.
All in all the book was well transferred to the Script I'd say. One eception: Pax Tharkas and Xak Tsaroth. They just didn't do a good job transferring that one. Due to too many cut bookscenes it just gets illogical because they get into the fortress much to easy. 5 min more could have solved that problem. Same thing its with the ruined City of Xak Tsaroth.
Another baddie: Raistlin's got to much credit for solving problems and has to much ""sceentime"".

The fight scenes is where you really know that you are watching a third rate job. The Qunesti city was just wrong. When Tanis and the companions meet with the speaker of the sun where is the tower that the speaker works in. Or that city, and the turtle farry. I have every dragonlance book ever releace and I baught this so that they keep on making more, I understand that the story going to be change a bit to fit in into a movie but they butcher it. please, please do better on the next one",1202256000,3,933,4.048648648648649
3246784,1,B000Y7U996,"As somewhat of a fan of bad movies, I bought this with the assumption it would be bad, but the hope that it would at least be entertainingly so.  I was not disappointed.

The animation is frankly horrid.  I'll get to the mix of CGI and regular animation in a bit but the standard animation looks like something poorly animated in the late 70s or early 80s.  The characters move around jerkily and make odd twitches and other unnatural looking movements.  I watched this on PS3 with HDMI connection and the picture itself was pretty bad as well.  Sometimes scenes got oddly blurry or grainy.  I often felt like I was watching a 2nd generation VHS tape.  In addition there are many other odd animation glitches and errors such as one point where Verminaard's mace appears to impale him through the stomach.

The decision to mix the CGI of the dragons and draconians and the animated regular characters, was not the best move in the world.  I didn't mind how the CGI characters moved.  The dragons don't get much airtime, but the draconians were done passably well.  They were certainly done much better than the regular animated portions but they did not mesh well with the other humanoid characters at all.

The story was fine but didn't exactly stick to the Dragonlance I know.  Ultimately it is pretty unfullfilling, however, and leaves far too many dangling plot points for my liking.  I assume this was made with a sequel in mind but it felt like there was very little resolution of the plot.

The voice acting was the best part of the movie.  It was done pretty well and includes some big names.  The dialogue varied but was adequate for the task.

The characters were a mixed bag.  While it's a fairly large cast as adventuring parties go you get very little information on several of the characters.

On the whole I have to rate this 1 star.  The animation is bad enough that it has to be seen to be believed and the meshing of CGI and animated characters is too too much to get past.  The story and dialogue are merely adequate and can't save the horrorshow of the animation.

While I can't recommend this movie in the least if you are looking for quality, if you are a fan of bad movies like me you will find endless amusement in Dragonlance:  Dragons of Autumn Twilight.  I laughed through most of it.  Final rating:  1 of 5 stars rating, 4 of 5 if you like bad movies.",1202256000,8,2378,4.480186480186481

The animation was abysmal.  Animated movies from the 70's played smoother then this movie.  I can't recall the last time I saw such jerky animation direct from a dvd.  I would compare it to watching a streaming video online over a poor connection.  The charactors were all poorly drawn.  The cgi draconians and dragons didn't blend well with the other animation.  It looked rushed and lazy in all aspects.

I found the voice acting generic and uninspired through most of the movie.  As much as I like some of the bigger names in this movie, it seems as though they put as much effort into their acting as they did to cashing their cheques.

There is nothing redeeming about this movie.  Anything brought into the movie by the soundtrack is destroyed by the other aspects.

I would be embarassed to be associated with this attempt at a movie in any way.  I honestly can't believe the authors would look at the final cut and say ""way to go! let's sell this to the fans that love our books"".  With the popularity of fantasy in mainstream movies right now, I can't believe they would put such a poor effort out the door.

The animation style of this movie is depressing to say the least (try to remember the original hobbit movie, good for the 70's, but terrible by today's standards).  Add to that a very strange and seemingly random assortment of CG effects (again, something you would expect to see out of a low budget 90's movie or a home made film).

Visuals aside, the voice acting seemed to leave a lot to be desired.  While some of the beloved lines of the original books were included, the manner in which the voices were done simply failed to carry the feel of the original story.  Between the simplistic narration to Tas' lack of curiosity I could barely stand to listen to the movie.

Finally, while I understand that some changes to the story were guaranteed, I was so disappointed to see so many pointless changes (not for the sake of time or quality, for whatever reason the screen writers just wanted to throw in their own flair).

I feel that while any Dragonlance fan should watch this movie, don't spend any money doing so or you will be greatly disappointed.  Find a friend who bought it without reading the reviews or get it on netflix where you won't mind getting one movie that you could barely sit through.",1202083200,6,1383,4.392156862745098
3246789,3,B000Y7U996,"I was so excited about this coming out after being a fan of the books for over 15 years. There was a lot of grumbling about it being an animated movie on the Dragonlance boards, but I decided to hold judgement until I saw the film for myself.

The movie starts off fine enough. I actually like 80s-style animation (this is reminiscent of the old Dungeons & Dragons cartoons or the old G.I. Joe cartoon). What I didn't like was the CGI animation that was used for the dragons and draconians. It could have been a cool effect, but the CGI looked like the CGI that was being put out 10 years ago. It looked cheap and it was very distracting.

The pace of the film was distracting, too. What started out as following the book rather closely rapidly picked up pace and skipped over major parts. I know that a book cannot be translated word for word to a movie, but a lot if character exposition and plot exposition were ""glossed over"". Having read the books, I could kind of keep up, my wife was lost, however.

It's worth getting if you're a fan and want to have it all. I'd rent t if you're not a collector. If you haven't read the books... I might just skip it. Unfortunately, this is another case of the studios ""cheap-ing"" out on D&D themed movies.",1201996800,,1248,4.3247863247863245
3246790,3,B000Y7U996,"Like most people that wrote reviews here, I grew up on Dragonlance and over the past twenty years or so, have read the first six books about a dozen times.  I have always wondered why Dragonlance was never adapted for the screen, because it seemed like the perfect kind of heroic/fantasy story that would make a great movie.

And it does.

The 400 page book has been nicely trimmed into a 90 minute movie.  Most plot points are retained, although I did miss the subplot of ""Tas and the wicker dragon"" which I think would have been hilarious on screen.  But that's a minor gripe.  The characters' personalities are all true to form.  Voice acting sounds great in general and fitting for the characters.

The problem with the movie is not the story, nor the voice acting, nor the musical score - which is also pretty moving and nicely orchestrated.  The issue is the animation.

The animation is really bad.  The 2d look is acceptable to a certain extent.  It looks very early 80s in the Filmation/He-Man style.  Not fabulous, just look at what animation is doing right now especially in terms of Japanese animation (the beauty and slickness of projects such as Witchblade, Haruhi, etc).  But if they had stuck with that (and only that) I believe the movie would have been better recieved.  Instead, they decided to mix CGI into the 2d realms and it looks TERRIBLE.  Disjointed and just generally poorly animated with jerky/choppy movements and blurry textures.  This is stuff you would expect to see on a very early 90s PC game.  One of the worst parts was the shots of the draconian armies.  It was the same monster cut and pasted a few hundred times looping the same animation.  They didn't even bother to pallete switch a few of them.  For shame!

And the video quality is horrible.  This is one of the worst looking DVDs I own, like someone smeared the screen with grease, a blurry mess to put it bluntly.

So overall, the movie adapation of the first Dragonlance book DOES capture the mood, setting, story and overall feel of the Dragonlance world in its infancy.  However, the animation is a serious drawback that will keep the movie out of the hands of many people, simply because its laughable.  And that's a shame when everything else seems to go together just right.

Except the character designs for the elves.  For a race that's supposed to be mindblowingly beautiful, these guys were just gaunt, pointy, and downright ugly.
Terrible character designs people!

I hope for a Dragons of Winter Night but with a serious rethinking of the animation strategy.  I know its low budget, but c'mon.  People doing flash animation could have done better.",1201996800,2,2654,4.7043478260869565

3246792,3,B000Y7U996,"Dragons of Autumn Twilight is an animated film based on the bestselling roleplaying fiction epic by Weis and Hickman. The film follows the heroes of the lance from their earliest incarnation as low level characters battling against the oppressive dragon armies of the queen of darkness.

Although I hadn't read a Dragonlance novel in years, I picked this film up for old times sake. Let me preface this by saying I didn't expect much from a direct to video release. I found the opening credits pretty cheesy. I did like the character design- the heroes look pretty much the same as they looked on the covers drawn by Elmore with the exception of Laurana (who looks nothing like her original incarnation) and her brother Gilthanas whose features are a bit too lined. I appreciated the level of detail which went into making Sturm look like the stuffy knight he was and to bring out the handsomeness of Caramon and Goldmoon's turquoise earrings. Unfortunately, the low frame rate of the animation, the jerky movement of the characters and yes, the awful CGI rendered the intricacy of the character design a moot point.

The plot was fairly involved, and yes there were some adult elements. (Caramon ogles Tika), people die, there is blood, monsters kill humans and each others etc. This is not a film for the small kiddies, although I suspect they would probably enjoy it.

There were some animation blunders as well. For instance Laurana is shown in different scenes with and without her armor, the Highlord's mace is shown moving through his own body etc. Overall if they had animated the Draconians and the dragons normally and spent a bit more time upping the frame rate of the animation, I'd probably give it a higher rating. It was still watchable, but the CGI and poor quality animation made it look cheap instead of the cult classic it should've been.

Because if you're willing to stop being Comic Book Guy for a minute and just relax, you'll realize that the movie had solid voice acting, accurately captured the feel of the Dragonlance universe, and followed the book pretty closely.

I invited some friends of mine, who like me are long time Dragonlance fans and D&D players, to watch the movie after I told them it wasn't so bad.  Guess what: they liked it, too.  We laughed at Tas, thought Raistlin was a jerk (but an interesting jerk), and responded to the movie pretty much like we did to the books.  In fact, all of us remarked that the movie made us want to read the series all over again.

The first half of the movie is admittedly weaker than the second half, but that's true of the book as well.  This is because the plot for the first section of the book was provided literally from the D&D role-playing sessions of the authors.  Thankfully they abandoned that method after a certain point, and from then on the book (and movie) dramatically improves in quality.

The movie ends with hints of a future installment, which would be the second part of the trilogy ""Dragons of Winter Night""; but at this point I haven't seen anything on the Internet or otherwise as to whether a sequel will actually be made.  I hope it is, because this movie--the reviews here aside--was an enjoyable start for me and my friends.  It is also the realization of a dream that Dragonlance lovers have had since they first read these books in the 1980s (or in my case, the 1990s): to see these beloved characters finally make it to the screen.

3246802,1,B000Y7U996,"This movie is awful. Quite simply, awful.

In the mid 1980's I read the original trilogy (Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Winter Night, and Spring Dawning) as a young teenager. I have re-read the entire trilogy, on average, about once every 2 years since then. So... Imagine my enthusiasm when, about a year ago, I found out a movie was going to be made from the novels! Last summer - when the release date was set for ""Winter 2007/2008"" I was psyched! However, the movie was released straight to DVD - and that should've been my first warning right then.

The characters aren't developed well from the start and everything seems far too rushed. Though there are shadows of dialog from the books transfered to the script - which, at times, seemed cute - bug it wasn't enough to balance the horrible spoken word/acting. Did the actors even understand their characters before jumping into a dialog session? Or were they only interested in cashing a quick paycheck. I think the latter.

I rushed out to pick up a copy at 10am when the stores opened, came home, and from the onset - that amazingly bad opening - sat there mouth agape in disgust. How could this be done to a beloved series of books that tons of fans have enjoyed over the past 20+ years? Heres my suggestion (and, apparently, more than a few other peoples, as well): PURCHASE THE BOOKS INSTEAD!

It's apparent, in our current society, that people quite simply don't make time to read. Otherwise, no one would have responded with a favorable review of this movie. I'd wager a bet those people with ""high praise"" for this movie/DVD never read a single page of the novels. Yes, book-to-script adaptations are often difficult - but when done well (i.e., ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, by Walsh, Boyens, and Jackson) it can be enthralling, exciting, and (take note Hollywood producers and studios!) actually make money! This DVD never will.

Let's hope this version of the Dragonlance story falls off the cliff and is never heard from again. What a waste to be waiting for this release for nearly two years and to have it arrive with such poor results. I pray that Dragons of Winter Night and Spring Dawning are never considered for the same fate as this version of ""Autumn Twilight.""",1201478400,7,2239,4.6725888324873095

To start off the production value of the movie is something I would equate with highschool art students taking on an animated movie. The animation style is dated, and really poorly drawn and executed. To give an example of how bad this is, they pan and scan certain shots to save on animation costs. Watching a zoom and pan of an animated frame is horrendous.

The voice acting is also awful. There's some good names and rarely they show that they do have talent, however for most of the movie as you listen to the voices, you have to wonder if they were only given one shot to do each scene. Most of the voice acting falls very flat and is totally painful to listen to.

The other major problem is the CGI work. It's awful. There's no other way to put it. First off it's not at the same frame rate as the regular animation, so the CGI elements look totally out of place. Secondly, they're just not that well done. Most of the CGI monsters look like toys and are very stiffly animated. It's just poor work.

If you are a real Dragonlance fan, please don't buy this movie. Don't give Paramount and WotC reason to further butcher what is a spectacular  series of books.",1201392000,9,1358,4.351778656126482

There are a lot of people who really missed the whole point of this project and sadly gave it negative reviews.  This project was never meant to be a motion picture quality project.  It was made for us fans.  It was done on a budget that would allow it a chance to convince the studios that another one should be made.  The purpose was to bring action to a beloved story in a way that was faithful to the book.  Did it do this?  YES!  The animation was on par with a typical Saturday morning cartoon and probably a notch better.  The story adaptation was admittedly choppy but who is going to buy this video that has not already read the book?  I thought they did an excellent job of picking the key points in the book to focus on.  Remember it took Peter Jackson over 3 hours to try and recreate each book of the LOTR and he needed to deviate from the book to do it.  This is only a 90 minute undertaking of a book that is actually longer than Tolkien's and it does not deviate at all from the book.  As for the characters I have to strongly disagree with those who found the voice actors lacking.  Perhaps you need to re-read the books again but this crew did a great job recreating the mood of the original books.  Perhaps that is why I enjoyed the movie so much.

I received the DVD as a gift from my brother, who's also a huge Dragonlance fan, for Christmas.  Knowing it was only an hour and a half, I tempered my expectations.

The Good:

It's fun seeing the characters and places that fans like myself grew up with come to life.  Sure it's not live action, but it put a smile to my face the first time I 'saw' Solace in this manner.

The Bad:

The animation looks a bit off as somethings are CGI while others appear hand drawn.  It didn't bother me that much, but it did seem off.  The main problem, as expected, is that the story is VERY rushed.  However, that was expected given the length.  In a 3 hour movie it would be hard to keep the same story and character depth that the books have.  I think my biggest disappointment was the lack of depth in the characters.  They certainly try, but given the rushed nature of the film, it really isn't possible.

I'm glad that Tracey Hickman wrote a review, and I really liked what he said about this being a first step.  Let's hope so!

This DVD simply fails to live up to an excellent story. Too much plot is jammed into too short a time frame. The tale simply can not be told in an hour and a half. While the movie is faithful to some of the characters (Tanis and Flint), others (namely Sturm and Caramon) are simply ignored. A number of the main themes (such as the tensions between the twins) and plot points (like what happens to Riverwind when Onyx comes out of the well) are also downplayed. Inconsistent animation does not make up for an excellent cast of voices and a solid score. The DVD also lacks any types of features. The movie's PG13 rating seems fair especially with a suprising bit of gore and a small scene with Caramon staring at a nubile Tika which had no point and even less humor. The direction also does not seem to help the film with way too many close ups of faces and it's amazing how many capes and cloaks seem to flow in the breeze at dramatic moments. And why do all the characters speak so fast? A hurried dialogue only make a rushed plot go by even quicker. The movie also annoys by fading to black between scenes.

Just the fact that they were able to get such great actors to play the characters from the books and get a movie made out of it was a huge step for me.

And the 2D animation is some of the worst seen since The Mighty Hercules and it's ancient ilk. The two of them together is nothing short of an unholy union.

I've waited for this for over 20 years and now I just want to throw up. This does to my memories of Dragonlance what George Lucas did to my memories of Star Wars with his prequel trilogy.

I hope that whoever is responsible for this gets blackballed from EVER working in animation, TV or movies for the rest of their natural life. It's an abomination. And Dragonlance deserves SO much better than this. As do the fans expected to shell out their hard-earned steel coins.",1201219200,6,1183,4.5233644859813085
3246813,1,B000Y7U996,"I read the reviews before watching the movie. I was even more disappointed than I prepared myself to be:)

The good points
The score is satisfactory
Raistlins voice is believeable
The opening shots of Tika are amusing (were they meant to be?)

The bad points
Most vocals were fairly poor
The whole film is rushed
I didn't feel at the end I really cared for the characters (there wasn't time)
The animation is dreadful....I could go on but I can't bring myself to....

This cartoon should not have been made. The principal of either do it well or don't do it at all was clearly not used here.

Hickman and Weis had a story that was at least as good as LOR (I prefered DL) - unfortunately what we are left with here is, well rubbish.

Remember Britney when she danced about in the school and said 'baby hit me one more time'? She had the talent, the looks, the ability, the sex appeal and the promise of a rising star - now she's in the 7th level of hell. The parallel I hope is obvious.

3246814,2,B000Y7U996,"I grew up in the late 80's and early 90's on Dragonlance.  These were the first novels I was really ""into"", and to this day I reread ""Chronicles"" and ""Legends"" about once a year.  So I've been following this movie and awaiting its release with great anticipation.

Unfortunately, when I watched it, I was highly disappointed.  My kids liked it, because that's what this basically is - a Saturday morning cartoon, like you would see on Boomerang!  The 2D animation was straight out of the 80's; I own the original D&D series on DVD, and this looked exactly the same.  The CGI animation wasn't well done, and blended horribly with the 2D.

The voice-casting was a mixed-bag as well.  Some - Raistlin, Riverwind, and Goldmoon - were well-done.  Others, such as Tanis and Sturm, were not.  It's not that I think the individuals are bad actors, I just couldn't help but picture Flash every time Tanis spoke.

The storyline was basically true to the book, for which I was grateful.  However, with only 90 minutes to work with, major pieces of the story were trivialized, or ignored altogether.  The movie definitely felt rushed, again like a Saturday morning cartoon.  They also added some extra stuff into the story, I guess to be more dramatic or something.

In short, if you are a fan of the books I would still consider seeing this movie.  I'm certainly hoping that, like the original version of The Hobbit, that this is more a way to introduce a great story to kids.  Maybe in twenty years we can get a movie that does this story justice.",1201219200,3,1537,4.612546125461255
3246815,3,B000Y7U996,"To be honest this movie was not as good as I was hoping it would be.  On the other hand, it IS a Dragonlance movie.  I have been a huge fan of the book series since the late 80's.  In fact it is one of the few series that I have to reread every couple of years because they are so enjoyable.  That said, this movie adaptation certainly has its flaws.  The animation is a bit sub-par and why they blended in CGI dragons and draconians I will never understand.  Every scene that combined the two looked odd and took me out of the story.  They should have done it all one way or the other.  I also have to agree with one of the authors, Tracy Hickman, that this was too much story for a 90 minute movie.  Too many good story elements had to be modified or jettisoned all together to fit the running time.  I was SOOO hoping for Tas in the wicker dragon!

So what's good about this movie?  Well for one thing, despite the material that was left out, it does get certain beats from the novel right.  I thought Tasslehoff as a character was pretty close to his novel incarnation and provided some well-placed humor.  Raistlin also made the transition from book to film mostly intact.  The final note about this movie that I have to make is to agree with Tracy Hickman in an earlier review that while certainly not perfect, this is a decent first step.  We live in an age where all fantasy films are placed against the model of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Personally I would love to see the Chronicles get the same multi-picture treatment that Rings got, and to do that some smaller steps like this need to take place.  So in light of that I was glad buy this movie just to show support for the story and hope that in the near future it will be done justice.  I hope all the other Dragonlance fans are with me.",1201132800,,1819,4.220289855072464
3246816,3,B000Y7U996,"I've been a huge DragonLance fan from the beginning, and I was hoping for so much more than this movie gave me.
The combination of 3D and 2D characters fighting hand to hand looks bad.
The dialogue is very very brief and basic, hardly any character depth.  I've read the books so many times I know the characters thoroughly, but if someone who has never read the books watched this movie, I doubt they would be impressed by the flat character portrayal.
Don't get me wrong, I love the DragonLance series, I own most of the books written, over 150, this movie is just another addition to the collection, and I sincerely hope they complete the trilogy in movie form even if it is animated.  I just hope and pray they do a much better job.
This movie is like a poorly animated ""Cliffs Notes"" version of a fantastic book.",1201132800,,817,4.44
3246817,3,B000Y7U996,"Hiya, as a long time fan of the works of Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weiss I was excited when I saw ""Dragons of Autumn Twilight"" on the racks at my local Walmart.  Upon arriving home and situating myself in front of the screen to watch the DVD the first thing I noted was the already mentioned 1980's grade animation quality.  Willing to make allowances for having a film ""made on the cheap"" I sat back and let the film play out in front of me.

First I will list what I liked - the plot stayed fairly close to the book I read and re-read until the cover was ragged.  The voice actor selections for Raistlin and Goldmoon were well matched and appropriate.  The dialog was competently delivered by the rest of voice acting crew, though none of the rest stood out as exceptional.

Next I will note what I found lacking or in need of improvement from my personal taste, but first I will note one of my personal biases, I'm a Anime fan.  Effectively that means I prefer modern feature film style animation releases to keep up with modern animation technology.
 - I agree that the use of traditional cell shaded animation gives it a nostalgic 1980's feel, but the setting isn't the 1980's America, it's the fantasy world of Krynn.
- All of the animated fight scenes would have been well served to have been scripted by a professional fight choreographer instead of just produced by a standard animation director.  In the Dragons of Autumn Twilight film the fights were depicted in a dull and lackluster manner, which caused a loss of dramatic tension.  I will reference the anime ""Naruto"" as a good example of relatively bloodless, yet interesting and dramatic fight choreography.
- Most of the scene transitions were stilted and awkward, someone with some serious cinematography skills was needed to make the scene transitions both graceful and fitting. Additionally a quality cinematographer would have made all of the scenes themselves better with a more consistent and appropriate selection of camera angles.
- Most of the background elements were flat and static.  Even the modern remakes of ""Scooby Doo"" add some interactive background elements from time to time.  A cell shaded but 3D environment would have looked a whole lot better, at not that great an increase in production costs.
- The addition of relatively low quality CGI mixed with the animation was frankly jarring and miss-matched.  In fact a cell shaded CGI approach as is used in the ""Naruto"" series (check out the anime on Cartoon Network) may have well been a much better approach for the whole animation.  It certainly would have added a continuity to the visual aspects of the work.
- Careful pacing of the plot by appropriately balancing the visual tempo for dialog, character development, and action.  This is mainly done at the editing stage in traditional film, but has to be seriously considered up front when doing animation.
- The visual character design was a bit old school and once again could stand to be punched up.  At least Ralph Bakshi's ""The Lord of the Rings"" seemed to get the character designs pretty close to how people viewed Tolkien's works.  I'm not recommending Japanese anime style character design, but more accurately designed characters would have been refreshing.  Ultimately, the closer the animators could have replicated the look and feel of Dragonlance that was originally established by the great Larry Elmore, Keith Parkinson, Clyde Caldwell, and others the better it would of been. Frankly, a world animated in an exact replication their style would have been so right it would have hurt from the spasms of visual ecstacy.
- I realize the books ""skipped"" some of the action moments that were presented in the Dragonlance game modules to allow for some surprises for the game players.  Being that the modules are mostly out of circulation, and that film media is primarily visual this could have been an excellent opportunity to reincorporate some of the ""skipped"" action scenes.
- The score was nice, and fairly pretty, but it mainly served to fill the background, and I think it failed to be appropriately evocative of the desired moods as the story progressed.  Mark Isham and Danny Elfman may not be in everyone's budget, but people who do movie scoring would do well to study their use of music to enhance the mood, as opposed to music used for background.
- As far as my overall views on animation quality, Hana Barbara and others at that level may be fine for kids, but Studio Ghibli is the benchmark for modern feature length cell animation.  Check out Hayao Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" and ""Howl's Moving Castle"" to understand what I'm talking about.  When doing a feature length release, its much better to shoot for Studio Ghibli than to settle for Hana Barbara.
- If a Studio Ghibli level production is outside of your budget, check out what even small scale animators like Blind Ferret Entertainment are accomplishing.

So to summarize the following areas needed improvement - modern animation techniques, quality cinematography, professional fight choreography, better story pacing, character design closer to the works of the original Dragonlance artists, re-incorporate some ""lost"" action material, consistent animation style, an evocative score, and aim for a Ghibli level production.

Clear and simple, at least this got made. Those outside the fan base may have a hard time relating to this DVD, however, fans should still come away with a visual of the story, which until now was only an audio book or the book itself. Although the 3D animation does not work with the mix and should have been left out, the 2D is fine. I find it similar to the Dungeons & Dragons cartoons of the 1980s, which I'm also a big fan of.

They totally left out the growing relationship between Tanis and Riverwind, Raistlin and Bupu.  The whole movie felt rushed.

3246820,1,B000Y7U996,"I'll keep this as short and sweet as possible.

Voice Acting - You have some great voice actors in this, but they lack any range and emotion.  Raistlin is just a monotone Sutherland.  Tanis played by Rosenbaum has nothing to it, he has more emotion and depth in his voice acting of the protagonist in the upcoming Dark Sector game.

Artwork - Like others have said, this is pulled straight from the late 70s to early 80s saturday morning cartoons.  The framerate is horrific, worse than current-day flash cartoons found on the Web.  Colors are either bright and colorful, or dark and grey or brown.  Emotions and body languages portrayed are juvenile, to say the least.

CGI - Just doesn't work in this regard.  The dragons and draconians done in this manner are very poor quality renderings compared to the quality common today, let alone five years ago.  Symetry in body composition was way off.  It would have looked a lot better if it had all stayed hand-drawn rather than using any CGI.

Story - The one thing this should have been perfected since it was already written and would have saved us from the voice acting and the artwork/cgi was the weakest part of the whole movie.  Not only did it stray far from the storyline in many respects, it was rushed headlong through everything and focused way too much on the weakest elements of the original story without capturing the dark and forboding future of the people.  At no time did I feel any emotion for any character or their situations.

Do not buy this unless you are an avid DragonLance fan.  Even then, I'd honestly suggest renting it and never owning it so that it would remind you of what is rather than what could have been.",1201046400,15,1690,4.583333333333333

If you are not going to do it right, just don't do it at all.  I am not sure if the lead animator was somebody's cousin or something but the animation does not even pass today's cartoon network lack luster standards.

The voice acting was good, but the dialog was horrible.  Where I am not a huge D&D geek I do enjoy the rich world that this franchise has to potently offer to other mediums. It is a shame to see it keep falling victim to the B movie assault it has had to endure time and time again.  One would think that in an industry like Hollywood who is plainly running out of fresh ideas when you see Bionic Woman and Knight Rider remakes.

 I love DragonLance, this picture is not all of the books that I have read but all of the books that I still have. I must say that I kind of like the movie. I will end up owning it because it is one of those types of movies that will grow on you over time. I would recommend renting it first just because there are some problems with the animation and for some of you out there that is a deal breaker in owning a movie. I did find the movie fun to watch they really hit some of the main points that I was looking for in this and that is how are the dragons, Draconians and how did they do with Rastlin all of which they nailed. As far as how it compared to the books... well read the books, also by the way if you are a fan of the book then before you watch this film I should warn you they stick to the main plot and that is it.

It was fun and campy: they did a great job at capturing the table top roleplaying feel epically with the jiggling boobies and focus on Kittera's trunk junk which for you table top players know that has come up during a gamming session.
The Voice Talent was very well done
Cool Dragons: they looked good and represented well, in other words the red dragons breathed fire and the black dragon spit acid!
cool Draconians: they looked nice and when slain they turned to stone trapping some weapons in them when they changed
Rastlin was well done: his golden hourglass eyes looked cool and they did a nice job portraying him as a haunted person with a dark cloud over him. They did not portray him as an evil character which he is not and I was very pleased to see.
Concerns / Dislikes

Animation that was 20 years too late: The animation style was western but lacked all of the lesions and techniques learned over the last 20 years. It was jarring and looked terrible.
The show felt hollow: They rushed, and missed a lot of notes that exist within the story that would not have taken any time to put into the movie so that I feel that if I had not had all of my previous exposure to the Dragonlance setting I may have had a harder time following the story or found it very one dimensional.
The fight scenes looked weak: they were terribly animated and in many instances I found myself thinking 'hey he is off balance wouldn't he just fall over'
Lacked good tension and conflict: I got bored at several points throughout the film which is very sad considering how much I love the setting, story, and characters.
Many of the characters came across as flat and lacking depth: take for instance Tanis all the film tells you about him is that he is 1/2 Elven and lacks faith, that is it. Many of the characters had that problem that they were just there, once again I was able to just fill in all of the missing information because of my familiarity but a film should not require that background knowledge.
This is the animated tale based on the first book in the DragonLance Series, Dragons of Autumn Twilight, by Margaret Weis. The courageous heroes, Tanis, Flint, Tasslehoff, Rastlin, Caramon, and Sturm are meeting in solace as they have pledged years earlier. They are discussing the goblin encounters that they met on their way into Solace when trouble is stirred up. It turns out that the Dark queen Takhisis has risen and with her cleric Verminaard are hunting for the missing staff of light. During the confrontation a man is accidentally knocked into the fire and set alight. That is when we get to meet two new characters the cleric of light Goldmoon and her companion Riverwind. She heals the man with her staff and they all have to flee from the goblins that are attracted to the scene.  For more reviews go to projectshadow.com",1201046400,,3806,4.363507779349363

I was a little uncomfortable having to explain to my wife that there is not that much cleavage in the book, and a little disturbed when Tika bounces her chest around.

The animation looks like a throw back from the early 80's. They must have blown there budget paying the actors for there voices and had nothing left for the animation.

I completely understand the need to accelerate the action of a story to accomodate a 90 minute timeframe, but it is much more difficult to accept when the animation is that choppy, the CGI is that bad (and it's bad), and the voice acting just doesn't connect with the characters.

I did not mind it being a cartoon but the cgi blended with the cartoon was terrible and I am hoping and praying to the gods of Krynn that this was just a ""pre-test release"" and not the real deal. There were so many things in this DVD that differ from the story that I could write a 300 page novel on it.

First the cons,
There was some parts of the books that I would have liked to see added. But I understood the budget and the time window of the film. This leaves something for the viewer of the movie, can you guess what it is? Read the books, 8 out of 10 times the book to a movie is better. Except when you got +100 mill budget and the eye candy is just unreal. Now some parts where a little choppy and when they meet the Foremaster it seemed a little blurry. Again not big issues, I seen first films to a trilogy not up to par and come around in the next film. Big thing that caught my eye was the draconians. They seem to fit in with the 2D only in a few scenes, I think they should have been done in 2D to make those parts not so awkward. Last con is the DVD should have had some more features, scene selection, behind the scenes and maybe a interview with WM&TH.

Thats it!

Now the Pros,
I liked the voices of all the cast, hope they all return if we get DoWN. Tanis was well done, you looked upon him as a leader, mission accomplished. Tas was done well too, I almost started singing with him when he went to go scout ahead into the fog. I am not a Kender fan. Some of the backgrounds where great, many scenes I could call out to myself and know where they where at. Very well done. Now the plus in 3D, I loved the dragons, matched Larry's dragons to a T. They flowed great for the most part, but added to the movie for me. <Dragon fan> Now if this was a action film like LotR, then I would want to see more of a life like dragons. But this was fine. Plus seeing WM&TH in the Last Inn was a kick for a DL fan. The music set the mood and was not over powering.

All and all, this is a great movie for the resources it had. It told the story in a manner that my kids could watch. If it was a full length LotR style, I would want to see the darker side of the Dragonamies, gore and other things that my kids would have to wait to watch. But it is a animation and is set so a wide age range can view. Much like the animated Hobbit and so forth. I remember as a kid watching them and thought the world of them. Now that I am older they do not have the same magic they once did. But, you think Peter Jackson watch those as a kid? I would bet he did....

3246834,3,B000Y7U996,"My family watched it with me this weekend. I was the only one who read the books; my son (14) and wife have not, but all are fans of Dungeons and Dragons. So we have 2 viewpoints and I will try to cover them both.

Mine. As one of my top 5 favorite series of books it falls short. The animation was far from smooth. Too many small details (which would not have taken much to put in) were missing. Fizban? Do not get me started I was not happy with his portrayal.  I'm sure a lot of this has to do with the 90min run time trying to cover a fairly long novel. The cut corners are forgivable (other reviews cover this), but disappointing. I definitely want to see Dragons of Winter Night, and a significant improvement. Music score was very good, voice acting was also pretty good.  Overall a 3 of 5 rating. Now I know why they didn't try to take this to the theaters even for a limited release though.  The relatively low cost of the DVD helps. However, I would've gladly embraced having to buy (2) 90min movies (or pay more for a 3hr movie) to cover the first book and all its story and details, then the common mistake of cramming a full novel into 90min.

Wife and Son. They forgave the relatively below par animation in lieu of the story. It was still fun and easy to follow, they enjoyed it a lot. The brief emphasis on Tika's assets in the tavern gave us all more of a chuckle than anything.  They did get the feeling there should have been more, it jumped a bit and left the feeling like there are missing scenes. The fight scenes, which couldn't decide whether they were tame or violent, was bothersome but again actually easy to ignore. Overall they enjoyed it and gave it a 4 of 5.  Honestly, if I detach myself from the book, then Im more in agreement with the rest of the family.

I understand this is a ""start"" and I appreciate Tracy Hickmans personal review greatly.  That being said... to me this is not just about this movie, or even just this series. I am a fan of many D&D authors and properties, I fear a failure here could once again set back legitimate attempts to make more movies of this and other D&D properties (remember a certain D&D live action movie several years ago?).  I know other fans feel the same way and should also speak out, if so.  Please make the next one but make it better.",1200873600,2,2313,4.257990867579909
3246835,3,B000Y7U996,"It is a first step, and I'm glad someone attempted it. However, the result, is less than pleasing. To comment on this, I'll visit graphical appearance, music / sound, voice acting, story, and an over all cap. *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS FOR THOSE THAT HAVE NOT READ THE STORY*

The animation is way below par with other similar products. It's like watching a cartoon from the 1980's. Where as it could have been a very interesting approach to it, they further boggle this by adding in another animation style over top of the one that most of it is done in (CGI?). Then there's also the fact that they didn't put enough variation into certain things. The fireball animation, for example, is pretty much the same. And poor each time. Personally, I would have preferred real actors over animation, but I thought the animation approach would work out just as well. In the end, it really doesn't.

The music is fairly well done, I believe. The music fits the scenes, it sounds pleasing, and did not distract from what was going on at the time. There are times I would not have put it in where they did, or done what they did with it, but I never found myself thinking ""This music is horrible. Who did this?""

There's not much to doubt, the voice talent was definitely there. With people such as Lucy Lawless, Keifer Sutherland, and Micheal Rosenbaum, you can hardly go wrong. Sutherland does Raistlin quite well, as does Lawless for Goldmoon. Tika and Caramon are done well too. Over all, I had no complaints here.

As for the story (the reason most would be watching this), it hits the basics of the book, for the most part. However, there is never much explanation of things that really need the explanation. It starts off well, with a very basic history for those that may not have read the books. It starts off alright, though the scene where Tasslehoff shows up leaves some to wonder about, the movie does need to move along and not piddle around in things too trivial. Some is skipped in parts of the story, such as Xak Tsaroth. Once again, one can't spend TOO long in any one part of the story. But the story also makes it seem like the adventure happens in a day. Over all... It would have been good had more time been spent developing the characters (I didn't feel I could relate to them as I could in the books), more time explaining certain situations (some were done well enough, some were not. The Tanis-Kitiara-Laurana relationship may have needed more for those who haven't read it before. Maybe. But the Flint-boat thing was handled decently well).

I would say the strong points are: 1) The fact it was attempted. 2) The voice acting. 3) The music. 4) I think this would be a good kids movie.

The weak points: 1) The animation. Disappointing, at best. 2) Story (kinda) - Good try, but I'd want more from it. 3) Characters could have been better.

My recommendation: If you're a parent looking for a movie for your kid, it's ok, but keep in mind there are two more books unaccounted for yet. You may want to wait for when, and if, they come out with the end of the story. If you're a die hard fan, get it if you want, but don't expect too much. For those just looking for something to entertain yourself with, I highly recommend the books over this.

If the next two come out like this, I'll get them when I can find used copies or on sale.",1200787200,,3346,4.455882352941177

I'm sure everyone remembers back to the lord of the rings movies when they first came out as cartoons, I thought they were horrible until I read the books, afterwards I appreciated them for the dream they brought to life.  Maybe this movie could've felt less rushed, maybe they could have found a little more experienced animators, maybe they couldn't afford it, I don't know.  What I do know is that I appreciate everyone who worked on this title, for bringing my favorite childhood books to life.  The story is an amazing one and so in depth there are limitless possibilities to what direction this could go.  I'm glad the writers played a major part in the creation of the movie, that means alot to me as a devoted fan.  What's happened to our society when we downright just refuse to watch a movie just because it has some poorly cg animated dragons here and there or a couple of slips and slides in the voice acting, what about a truly deep and engaging story, does that count for nothing?  Or can it just be replaced with more graphics, gore, and nudity.  I'm just overjoyed that my I can finally view my favorite series as it was invisioned by the authors, and also that they stuck to the book for the most part.  Alot of the dialogue that I remembered was pretty much quoted word for word.  I have to say it may not have been the best in the world but every fantasy series has to struggle to get their story accross to the masses, it took Lord of the Rings how long to get onto the big screen???  Sorry for that rant, I just get so frustrated when people jump to conclusions about things without taking into account that this was most likely a pretty low budget film, and was almost specifically targeted for a dragonlance fan.  I'm done now, I have to stop myself before I start repeating myself haha.

For us fans that have read the books, the movie stayed with the story for the first half and then from there I was disappointed. It was like "" Uh oh, we are running out of time let's just butcher it and rush through to the end"". To do it right, it needed to be either a longer movie or made into two. I still recommend it, but just want to warn ya a head of time. They did good with what budget and time they had to work with. Hopefully this will guide the books to live action.

It was saturated with religious overtones, and missing out on the character depth that made Dragonlance unique from Lord of the Rings and many other fantasy stories.  They changed the plot in unecessary ways that detracted from the story (and I don't mean just cutting out scenes... they added plot points in a manner that makes you wonder if the producers ever read the novels).

The women were overly sexified, the battle scenes weak and the overall story just clunked along.

Too bad, I was expecting something at least equivalent to Batman the Animated series.

3246848,2,B000Y7U996,"Pros:  Some of the characters are decently executed and the movie stays fairly true to the book in terms of script.

Cons:  Awful mixture of traditional and CG animation, some awkward dialogue and a general feeling of being rushed and unpolished.

This movie does a pretty good job at fitting in most of the stuff that was in the books and it does a pretty good job of portraying certain key characters.  Raistlin, in particular, was well written, well acted, and well drawn which is fortunate as he is such a popular character with fans.  This, however, is all the good that I can say of this movie.

To begin with, the sheer look of this movie is enough to cause laughter.  With a few exceptions, the main characters are decently drawn, but for some reason, there is CG animation mixed in this and the two forms do not even remotely go together.  Individually, either form would have been mediocre, but together they just look ridiculous.  I'm no expert on animation and I usually don't nitpick these things, but a child could easily notice that the animation in this film does not mesh.  There are also various decisions which visually do not make sense.  For example, Sturm seems to get a cut on the forehead and the next moment is lying in a huge pool of his own blood, but in the same scene, Tanis is hit many times but shows no sign of injury.  This film really feels like it needed someone to simply go through and point out all the things in it that don't quite logically work or that could be construed as ridiculous.

As far as sound goes, the voice acting was usually alright, though not exceptional and the music was completely unremarkable.

The script is probably the best thing about this movie as it stays fairly true to the books (other than a Larauna scene at the end which me and my friends laughed at for twenty minutes) and the dialogue between characters is sometimes pretty good, but even it suffers from feeling too rushed.  Instead of cutting out some content and developing characters and relationships more, the each location is given the barest treatment possible.  Also, some characters, especially Tanis, have the habit of stating their innermost conflicts in the most blatant way when these things should be shown more subtlety through dialogue and character emotion.

Overall, this movie feels like it could have been good if more time and effort had been put into it.  As it is, I wouldn't recommend it except to the extreme Dragonlance fans and even then I would warn that it contains some big flaws.",1200528000,6,2535,4.630872483221476

This movie was the biggest let down for me, with all the technology out there this was the best you can do? The action scenes just did not flow. I want to like this movie so bad that I have watched it more times and I should have... I had my 11 year old son read the first book and he loves it but even he didn't like that most of the key parts in the book were left out. They should have went with a different annimation studio and made it into a five part series and put in as much as they can to keep it true to Weis and Hickman's story. The comics are great and this, this was just bad. I hope that they will learn and find a better company to do the rest and maybe remake this let down.",1200528000,3,1088,3.776315789473684
3246850,4,B000Y7U996,"The movie in someways was a classic. It's animation reminded me of the style used in the Dragonlance Comic book series and to me was a clever tie in between the two franchises. The 2D art and 3D art mixes were an interesting idea but not always a very effective idea throughout the movie. At times they appeared to be glitches between the two animations. Overall the animation is what people should expect for a film that was low budget. It carries forward the proud traditions of other novels that were turned into animated movies, such as the Lord of the Rings animated movies.

The storyline was based on the Dragonlance novell; Dragons of Autumn Twilight, and while the main story idea was still presented to the audience many fans of the novel will notice differences between the two. The movie is around 90 minutes and compresses 300+ pages into the story. To do this some parts of the novel had to be changed to help the story flow forward. While fans would have loved to see every scene of the book translated into the movie, it is not feasible.

The story that is presented is a straight forward storyline with few twists or turns. A group of adventures return to their old haunt to meet again and discuss their findings after five years apart. In their initial meeting they discover their hometown overrun by goblins and meet a pair of strangers holding a blue crystal staff. They then are chased out of the town and set off in search for the Gods of old. Along the way they have several small adventures that eclipse into one larger adventure.

The ending of the movie is a quite a shock to fans of the novels as this part of the movie has been changed to meet time requirements and to nicely wrap up the tale if the second movie doesn't happen. Even though it wraps it up, it does leave enough or a string dangling for its viewers to wonder what happens to these characters following the harrowing escape.

The voice acting in the movie was pleasantly surprisingly good. There was little here that was wrong and characters seemed to be presented in ways that were considered proper for their character. The whispering voice of Raistlin (Sutherland) is a dream come true for several Dragonlance fans, and one can feel the command of respect that comes for the voice of Goldmoon (Lawless).

Overall the movie was a great first attempt into the film industry. This installment is sure to entertain most fans of the novels, if they can judge the movie as its own piece of work rather then against other animated movies. The acting is superb, the animation typical to the budget, and storyline follows the book in many cases but due to time constraints is forced to tie things together.

I give this movie 3.5 stars out of 5.

The plot is rich, the characters are textured, and the imagery is vivid. This cartoon adaptation has nothing of that.

Firstly, as others have noted, this is drawn and animated in the style -- and (ahem!) quality -- of a rushed Saturday morning cartoon. You could throw a member of the Scooby Doo or Superfriends casts into the crowds and chances are no one would notice.

The character portrayal was equally resplendant. I doubt you could tell High Lord Verminaard from Skeletor or Lex Luthor with your eyes closed. Laurana was reduced to a cartoonish valley girl. Tanis was just Fred from Scooby Doo, but with a beard. And the list of flat stereotypes goes on and on. I need to repeat this: these are NOT the characters you meet in the books! Given the cast of proven actors, I can only blame the director for this amateurish mess.

As if a badly drawn and badly acted cartoon weren't enough, the storytelling was just as disastrous. Scenes that inspired fear and awe in the book were bland yawn-jerkers. Scenes that brought a tear to your eye in the book now had all the emotion of a grocery checklist. Long voyages to distant lands were made to feel like a brief stroll around the corner.

I had imagined the authors watching this with mouths agape and shaking their heads in disbelief, but to my great shock, I found Tracy Hickman giving this insipid belittling of their magnum opus a glowing review! Maybe it's unrealistic to expect a LoTR-like movie adaptation, but come on! At least hold out for something on the scale of Bakshi instead of something that feels as if it should be interrupted by ads for Sugar Corn Puffs.

also it seems liek they added 80s cheese dialogue over more important dialogue--or even funny dialoge--
they also rushed the darken wood scene...evrything was rushed.shoddy animation.

3246856,3,B000Y7U996,"Anyone looking for a great piece of animation will be sorely disappointed by this movie, but those who are looking for a solid story, interesting (and entertaining) characters, and a quite impressive soundtrack will still find this movie enjoyable.

Some background:  I've been a dragonlance fan for twenty years, ever since I was in elementary school.  It was my introduction to D&D and the Chronicles (the series of novels on which the movie is based) were some of the first novels I ever read.  So, I had high hopes for this movie, perhaps too high.  My heart sank with the opening sequence, but gradually lifted as the movie continued.

The movie:  The bulk of the animation was done by a Korean animation studio called Toonz.  Note to producers:  Do not hire Toonz.  The animation work was incredibly choppy, occasionally the lines for characters flickered back and forth between frames even though the character wasn't moving, at one point major objects that are in the scene suddenly ""disappear"" because the animator forget to include them (i.e., a large table and chairs that all the characters have congregated around), and the detail in the characters frequently left me wanting for more.  This was made all the more jarring by the inclusion of the 3D animation for the dragons and draconians (a type of lizard-man, for those unfamiliar with Dragonlance).  And yet,the 3D animation was frequently lacking as the movement of the characters seemed wholly unnatural, clunky and lacking a degree of fluid motion that real creatures have.

Overall, the story itself is quite faithful to the novel it's based on (see the Chronicles trilogy by Weis and Hickman).  Yes, a lot of it was cut and abbreviated -- the writers had to turn a 400 page novel into a 90 minute movie.  Peter Jackson tried the same thing with the Lord of the Rings movies at 3 hours each and STILL had to cut things.  As a consequence, the pace of the movie moves very quickly and is sometimes quite abrupt.  Some of the fantastic elements and immersion that you get from the novels is missing because of this.  However, the fundamental plot points remain, the characters come through, and all the major scenes from the novel are included in the movie.  If one accepts the fact that this is a 90 minute movie (actually, less than that if you exclude the credits and opening sequence), it's remarkable how faithful the writers were able to stay to the original book.  Kudos.

The voice work had its ups and downs but was, on the whole, well done.  Lawless and Sutherland did great jobs, as did several of the other actors, but others had voices that did not fit their characters and seemed forced or canned.

The soundtrack is quite good.  I don't know if I'd call it an instant ""Classic"" or masterpiece, but it is very well done.  I might be one of the few people who did not care for the opening theme, but the rest of the music I thought was beautiful and very appropriate to the movie.

As for the DVD itself, the ""extras"" are hardly worth mentioning -- merely artwork stills for character concepts and proofs.  It's interesting for about fifteen seconds, which is also about the extent of the content.  I don't understand why they couldn't have at least included some interviews with the original authors or something, but I guess with such a small budget (only $1.5 million, compared to $150 million for the latest stuff from Pixar) they wanted to make sure as much of it went to the movie as possible.

My hope is that Mr. Hickman, one of the novel's co-authors, is correct -- that this movie is the first part of a journey.  This will only come true, however, if there are enough sales of the DVD to turn a profit.  It seems this movie got little love or attention from Wizards of the Coast (the owner of the license and published of the Dungeons and Dragons RPG), but hopefully the sales and rentals will be enough to not only justify a second installment, but a substantial increase in the budget for its production.

If ""the Dark Queen"" or Tracy are reading this, a heart felt thank you to the both of you. You have brought me countless hours of joy and happiness with the world you have created and this movie only added to it regardless of my quibbles with its production. You are both amazing people. Good luck on all your future endeavors.",1200528000,2,4327,4.637795275590551
3246857,3,B000Y7U996,"I have beena longime Dragonlance fan... not since the very beginning, but for about 19 years now. I own every single novel ever released and love them all except for maybe 10 of them. For years I wished that Dragonlance would be turned into a movie, and now that I've gotten my wish, I don't know what to think.

When it was announced the movie was being made, I was elated. When I heard it was going to be animated, I wasn't as elated. But then I fugured if they did it right, an animated Dragonlance movie could be as good as a live action movie. I saw some early concept art and was pleasantly surprised at how great it looked, but a few months later I saw the first trailer and was left wondering if it was a joke or not, or at the very least I was hoping the animation I saw was just unfinished. This wasn't the case, unfortunately.

The 2d character animation simply sucks. It isn't very detailed at all, it resembles animation from the 80's and it's so jerky that I swear it only runs at 10 or 15 frames per second. The background art and animation tends to be beautiful though. The 3d computer animation ranges anywhere from great to horrid, and all three of these come together to make the movie seem like it's confused. It's really odd, what you see on screen will go from beautiful, to awful, to just okay in the span of a few seconds. Some of the character models are way off too. Flint looks like an albino midget, and Takhisis can only uses one type of breath attack, despite being able to use 5 different ones at once in the novels. At least they put the PG-13 rating to some use and do show a bit of gore and green slime oozing from slain enemies.

The voice acting for the most part is excellent. Keifer Sutherland does an excellent job capturing Raistlin's attitude, except the coughing fits he has sound a bit fake. All other characters sound good, except for Tasslehoff. Kenders are supposed to be really care-free, but he is simply childish in the movie. He is animated childish and his voice is childish. I mean, REAL childish.

The music in the movie is a mix of orchestral and folk arrangements and is simply awesome. It's one of the better aspects of the movie actually.

The story seems to move along at way too fast a pace, but such is the way with novels turned to hour and a half movies. For the time they were given to tell the story, they did a decent job.

In the end, I'm glad the movie came out, but I was hoping for so much more. I think most negativity of this movie would have been downgraded had they used a different animation style. Maybe all computer generated, or all hand animated, but in a darker style similar to Don Bluth or something. I know they were only given a million and a half dollar budget when other animated movies get fifty to over a hundred million, but still...

I just hope newcomers to Dragonalnce don't think the novels are all childish like this, because they aren't.",1200441600,2,2931,4.337591240875913
3246858,4,B000Y7U996,"Like many others, I was excited about this film when I heard it was being released.  I thought animation would be a perfect medium to capture the magic.  Since very, very few movies are equal to the source books, I didn't expect it to be perfect.  I did enjoy it, and hope they make a ""Dragons of Winter Night"". However, I have to say I was a little disappointed overall.

My major problem was the combination of CGI 3-D animation and traditional 2-D animation.  They did NOT meld well.  The dragons and Draconians looked like they were in the wrong movie!  This was especially jarring since the 2-D animation looked like it came out of the 80's, very old school.  This isn't necessarily bad.  I own a lot of 80's cartoons on DVD.  But the CGI made it look cheesy instead of classic.  I was hoping for clean looking animation like ""Batman: The Animated Series"", or ""Justice League Unlimited"".  I hope the filmakers take this into account and stick with 2-D for a sequel, which I would not hesitate to buy.

As to the story, the adaptation was very good.  A full length novel does not compress to an hour and a half movie without feeling rushed, but there was enough backstory for those who never read the series.  The characters were excellent; the production team captured the spirit of each one. And I agree the voice actors were perfectly chosen, especially Keifer Sutherland as Raistlin.  There was a lot of action, and the key scenes and places from the novel appeared.

I do recommend this DVD to fans of action/fantasy films, particularly if you can get it for less than $15.  I would watch it again and I would love a sequel.  The producers just need to overcome some issues.",1200441600,7,1683,4.53156146179402
3246859,4,B000Y7U996,"All in all i found this movie to be rather enjoyable.  i have been a big fan of the books for a long time so i kind of went into it expecting one thing but trying to keep an open mind.  Like with any other movie based on a book it comes up short in areas, after all how you imagine the story will always be different than what someone else imagines.  Secondly, i thought that the voices when the next best thing to being perfect as there could be, they just seem to fit well with the characters.  The one big flaw that i did see in the movie is that some of the main storyline twists and plot adders were removed to make it fit the time frame.  i would love to have seen this movie extended out to 2 or even 3 hours to be able to fit it all in but since that was not the case, i still enjoyed it emmensly.",1200441600,2,805,3.825301204819277
3246860,4,B000Y7U996,"First off, for all those wary people and critics, yes, the animation is less than what we've come to expect in recent times given the advances of CGI and computer animation.  I did think given this story first came in the 80s, the animation fit. However, instead of approaching this film as a flim critic, I allowed the story and characters to move through me.  I was NOT disappointed.

Watching the story unfold, one of the first fantasy novels I fell in love with (not to mention Raistlin, voiced perfectly by Keifer Sutherland!!) my heart was giddy in my chest.  I felt like a young girl on a first date.  Yes, I definetly noticed the jumps in storyline, wished the scenes with Onyx and Riverwind being resurrected was included, but I felt the overall story was present.

My advice to this, for those who love the books don't approach this film as the book in play-by-play animation.  Instead view it with the same love and excitement as when you read it the first (few!) times and allow the characters to invoke within you all the passion and human emotion delivered.  4 stars and a hopeful prayer for the continuation with a bit more effort on the flow, so that it doesn't leave us hanging.  Go dragonlance!",1200441600,3,1212,4.574074074074074
3246861,2,B000Y7U996,"Let me first state that I was pretty optimistic when it came to this movie.  I know initially a lot of people were hoping for a live-action theatrical release but I felt a direct to DVD animation film would better capture the niche persona of Dragonlance.  Plus animation gives the creators so much freedom to explore when creating the world of Krynn and its inhabitants.  I really am an animation junkie.  And throw in Kiefer Sutherland as Raistlin?!  Count me in!

My expectations began to wane slightly upon the release of the CGi frames.  My first thought was ""These look like screenshots for a Playstation game..."" and I mean Playstation, not Playstation 2 or 3.  I decided I could get passed some less than stellar animation (the 2D stills, while low on detail, were clean looking and attractive enough) and my only fear was that some bad CG stuff would turn away non-fans and thus lessen the possibility of a sequel.

Fast forward to yesterday and when I got home from work and popped this sucker in.  Now the menu was really bare, and the extras no where to be found, but I still tried to remain upbeat.  I only care about the film, the rest be damned!  The opening scene caught my eye as we're treated to the aftermath of a most violent confrontation.  The animation was jerky and clumsy, but the still shots at least looked good.  I love the 90's Batman cartoon, and so far it seemed the animation was at least on par with that.

Unfortunately it was mostly downhill from there...

The soundtrack is a positive.  The only negative I can find with it is that some of the chanting vocals seem out of place at time and there isn't one ""Dragonlance"" main theme with a great hook.  Also it is too loud in some scenes and the characters get drowned out.

The voice acting for the main cast is solid.  Flint kind of turned me off at first.  He doesn't really sound like a dwarf, but a guy trying to sound like a dwarf, so that took away from the realism.  And Tas was merely ok.  I commend the effort of Jason Marsden, I just think Tas would sound better with a higher, more youthful voice.  Sutherland did an excellent job with Raistlin.  Some complain he is too dry but that's how I always imagined Raistlin, the man was practically devoid of emotion except for when he goes off on a tangent about his ever growing power.  Goldmoon and Riverwind I felt were excellent.  The rest were good enough.  Some of the support characters sounded out of place.  Onyx and the draconian monk just sound like humans, which makes no sense to me and is really jarring.

Unfortunately, that is pretty much where the good ends.  The 2D animation is mediocre at best  It looks fine when standing still, but once the characters start moving it's just clumsy.  I know a lot of money wasn't put towards this thing but maybe if the money wasn't wasted on the pitiful CG more could have been done with the 2D.  The CG dragons remind me of the World of Warcraft commercials that run on tv, only worse. It's really mind-boggling to think that someone, somewhere, thought this stuff looked good.  The film's absolute low point probably occurs with the draconian fight on the right.  There's basically no background, just fog, and watching the 2D characters interact with the 3D draconians is just painful and embarrassing.  I'm really thankful I watched this alone and not with my roommate who has never seen or read anything Dragonlance related as it would immediately put her off.

And of course, going in I expected some sacrifices to be made to trim this novel down to 90 minutes, but I didn't realize just how much would be lost.  Losing full scenes is one thing, but losing what makes each character unique is another all together.  I feel like if someone who knows nothing about Dragonlance watches this film they will know just as little afterwards.  We get a hint of Raistlin's hatred for his brother and the affection returned, Riverwind's racism, Sturm's distrust of Raistlin, and so forth but so much is lost.  I felt the biggest victim was Tas, and even more specific, his relationship with Flint.  Tas does not come across as a happy-go-lucky kender with an affinity for thievery.  His thievery is alluded to, but at no point would someone realize that kender have an insatiable desire to collect everything to the point that they can't control themselves.  Nor is it really conveyed how Tas always views himself as innocent.  The scene at the end where he mourns the loss of Fizban has no impact because we never got a sense for what kind of character Tasselhoff really is.  The basic plot of the story is really straight forward fantasy questing type of stuff.  What makes Dragons of Autumn Twilight a great story though are the characters and unfortunately they are completely lost and wasted here.  The other major interaction not given enough attention was the relationship between Raistlin and Bupu.  We can tell Raistlin is different, and perhaps a little cold, but the depth of his selfishness isn't really explored and therefore his attitude towards Bupu doesn't seem at all out place in the film.  The part where she gives him the spellbook, like the scene where Tas cries, has no impact at all where as it is one of my favorite scenes from the trilogy.

I could go on and on about other scenes and instances where the essence of a character is lost (Flint's reaction when he thinks Tas is dead in the burning wicker dragon) but I'm sure anyone reading this gets my point.  The plot moves along at a rapid pace as a story really deserving of 2 and a half to 3 hours is shoved into 90 minutes and at no point does the movie fall into a rhythm of any kind.  I've said it before and I'll say it again because it is such an appropriate way to describe the film, but the film really is clumsy in its attempt to tell the story.  I hope that by purchasing the DVD Wizards of the Coast makes enough money to green-light a sequel.  And I hope in turn that the harsh criticism of the fans raises the quality of any sequel so that it is something we can all enjoy and be proud of.  These films do not need to be as good or better than the books, they do not even need to mirror them word for word or scene for scene.  They merely, like the comic books, should provide an alternate way for us to experience Dragonlance that is neither really better or worse, but just unique in the experience offered.  It is my hope that Dragonlance gets another shot on film because as it stands I'd like to forget about this one.

I can't, in good conscience, recommend this to anyone but the diehard Dragonlance fan who needs to satisfy his or her curiosity.  For those individuals (myself included) will likely rationalize a purchase as saying ""It can't be that bad, plus I love Dragonlance!"" but trust me, it is.  Most of us will just be left wondering what could have been?",1200441600,7,6854,4.509326845093269
3246862,3,B000Y7U996,"While I don't play the D&D games I have been an avid reader of the Dragonlance series since middle school in the early 90's and I own every dragonlance book released.
I've been looking forward to this movie for over a year since I feel the story plot Margaret and Tracy came up with is on par with LOTR. Reading both I actually prefer Dragonlance.
I pre-ordered this movie off of Dragonlance.com which came with the extra feature of a bookplate hand signed by both the authors Margaret and Tracy!

When I first saw some of the animations early release I knew Paramount must have been putting a small budget into the production meaning they would have to use older animation styles of the 90's and use a smaller animation company. I tried to keep my hopes at a reasonable level...
I was just hoping it wouldn't be the failure the dungeons and dragons movie was.

Now onto my review..

The good points:
The voice overs and music were not that bad. Also the reproduction of the character design was very pleasing. I also loved it when the film was accurate to the books and you would have flashbacks to your reading.
With Tika and other characters sex appeal I feel they were in a weird middle ground. If they wanted to go for a younger market they should have skipped it but since I think Dragonlance fans tend to be a bit older and I feel they might as well gone for more fanservice instead of here and there.

The bad stuff:
First has to be the old style animation. If Paramount was willing to put up the money for Final Fantasy style CGI then the film would have been an instant classic. Second has to have been the film length! 60 min was no where near enough time to get into the book at all.
Due to the time constraints the edited the hell out of the book. They cut scenes, skipped important plots and characters and messed with the time line they also rewrote some of the book and thats a big no-no. This really killed them since the animation was to poor to bring in people unfamiliar with the books and the plot was to all over to please the die hard fans..
Either stick faithfully to the books or make it entertaining if you plan to alter the plots, to do neither is to waste our time and money.

Overall I think it was a good stepping stone but I think Paramount killed any chance of a sequel, not to mention taking out most of the foreshadowing that was in the first book.
It might be to little to late as the market starts to loose interest in LOTR style movies.

I truly hope some day Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman get to see their baby treated with the respect it deserves. They have been suppling us with a great fantasy world for over 20 years!

I'd say rent the movie then read the book so you're not as dissapointed or skip the movie all together and just buy the books, either way if you haven't read the books.. BUY THEM NOW!
Buying the movie would increase our chances of something better coming out in the future but it's hard to say I can endorse that..",1200441600,,2977,4.295900178253119

Overall, I think if they didn't have the money to do a top notch production, they should have waited.

3246868,3,B000Y7U996,"I watched the movie last night and have to say a couple things about it.  I'll try not to give too many spoilers.

1.) The story
The story is a trimmed down version of the novel.  They take a couple liberties but the story is overall the same.
2.) The Music
Fantastic music.  The score does well to set the mood.
3.) The voice acting
Mostly good but the stand out was Kiefer Sutherland playing Raistalin.  At first I was skeptical, but he did grow on me.
4.) The characters
They took a few liberties with the characters.  Caramon kind of became a caracture of himself and they did lessen the bond between the twins.  Also, Tanis has become very emo.
5.) The animation
This is where the movie took a nose dive IMO.  The animation quality was equivalent to early 90's US animation (think shows like exo-squad and battle tech).  The mix of CG and traditional animation was awkward at best.  A big complaint for me was that the characters had no facial expression which with some of the voice acting made for sadistic seeming characters.
They did some cool things though, as being a d&d player - I enjoyed the way they treated magic in the film.  Spells did require the magical components that they do in D&D.

Overall -
Its worth watching to support the genre, and is definately better than the D&D movie.  I think they could have done better but its a good first attempt.  I suggest watching it with D&D playing friends and just having a laugh with it.",1200441600,,1450,4.422641509433962
3246869,3,B000Y7U996,"Ah, what could have been. As a longtime D-Lance fan I was really looking forward to this one, and while it could have been worse, it certainly could have been better.

The good news is that it follows the book pretty closely from what I recall, even having the little intro with Tika in there. As interesting as it would have been to have it split in 2 movies as Tracey Hickman wanted, I thought it worked well as a single movie. The characters were all there with good characterization and voice work for the most part (still not sure about Keifer as Raistlin but through no fault of his own), and it was exciting to see this world come to (visual) life.

Alas, almost everything above is undone by the distracting animation.  I can't even begin to describe the problems, but by far the worse part was the CGI mixed in.  It didn't look very believable and didn't quite interact with the traditional animation very well, I thought.  I'm not even sure why you would have 2 different styles (I don't see why everything couldn't be done traditionally).

Still, if you like the Dragonlance books, it's worth a rental. The only reason I can recommend buying is if you want this one to generate enough to ensure the second one (if they make it) is much better.",1200441600,3,1254,4.478070175438597
3246870,2,B000Y7U996,"While I do hold faith that the DragonLance saga can follow LOTR from a Ralph Bakshi cartoon to the big screen, I don't want to wait 25 years for that to happen. :-)  Most people had a problem with the animation.  I did not.  There is no way an animator is going to capture what Krynn looks like in my head, unless they use the old Larry Elmore art.  I can forgive the 2nd rate animation for this movie.  What I absolutely cannot forgive is the rush in telling the story.  Tracy (Hickman) was dead on in his hope that this movie should have gone up to the Solace is burning scene.  For 90 minutes that's all the story you can tell.

DragonLance's driving force is the character development.  You actually care about these characters.  With this film, I didn't care for a one of them.

****SPOILER ALERT*****

The deviation from the story in certain places really bugged me.  Having Onyx, or Khinsanth if you prefer, fly off in the beginning to go guard the disks was just wrong.  Which we don't find out what the disks are until they get to Xak Tsaroth and even then it's like what the heck are these?  We risked our lives for a bunch of disks.  Wasn't a big part of the story being that nobody believed in Dragons?  They were stories told to children to scare them.  In fact when The Companions meet the wicker dragon it kind of reinforces that notion of there not really being dragons.  Just stories to keep people (or Draconians for that matter) in line.  Which makes it all the more dramatic when Khinsath bursts from the well and gives Riverwind an acid bath while Goldmoon is communing with Mishakal.

Kitiara as a Dragon High Lord in this movie?  Isn't that kind of a big deal in Dragons Of Winter Night when we find out that Kit is actually a Dragon High Lord?

Fizban as the storyteller from the beginning and he also turns out to be Paladine?!?!  Are you kidding me?  Fizban turning out to be Paladine is a HUGE plot twist in Dragons of Spring Dawning.

****END SPOILER ALERT*****

I seems to me that this screenplay (I'm being kind calling it a screenplay) was written with the intent, or maybe with the safety net, of another movie never being made.  Let's get all the cool plot twists out of the way, that way the full story was kind of told.

***SPOILER ALERT***

They should have killed off Sturm and Flint right away too, because if another movie gets made, I'm not going to care whether they live or die.  That's how poor the character development was.

***END SPOILER ALERT***

As the title of my review mentions, I was disappointed in this adaptation.  Too much was left out or changed.  That being said, it is still DragonLance, and it is the same characters.  The characters I grew to care about.  I'm certainly glad I got to know them before this movie otherwise I would have never given a second movie a chance, and I certainly would not have wanted to read the book.

If anyone sees this movie and has not read the book.  Do yourself a HUGE favor and read the book.  It is 1000 times better.  It'll go a long way in washing out the taste of this movie.  If you've neither seen the movie nor read the book, read the book.  In fact read all the books (at least both trilogies), and then maybe see this movie.

Like I said, I look forward to a competent adaptation of these wonderful books.  I don't even care if it's 2nd rate animation, live-action, or CGI, or whatever, as long as it is a competent adaptation.  This is a slap in the face to both Margaret and Tracy.  I think Tracy was fair in his review, but it's like a loving parent.  You recognize the flaws in your children, but accept and love them all the same.  Well guuess what Tracy and Margaret?  Your children are like my best friends, and I too accept them flaws and all...even though I am disappointed in the movie sibling, it'll keep it's place on my shelf (probably never to be watched again, but a place of honor none the less).",1200355200,11,3917,4.3647711511789185

They writers have written a story that is loosely based on the epic novel, but unfortunately they used the cliffs notes version.  I have been reading Dragonlance novels since 1985 and this production must have been about money, because it is not about the aesthetic value of the book.  Apparently Goldmoon and Riverwind were already at the Inn of the Last Home, because Sturm didn't escort them in.  Monks?  They are Clerics guys, the draconion voices sound more human than Raistlin, no reptilian hisses, no weapons at their sides, just beating the heroes with their fists.  No hiding along the roadside, no scream from Goldmoon, all the companions were standing there waiting for the draconians.  No white stag.  The companions were all awake when the pegasi set them down on the ground.  Apparently the retard writer decided to have the Black Dragon destroy the barbarian village.  No well, no melting of Riverwind.  Bupu leads them (all of them) to the Black dragon lair, where she is sleeping while the companions loot for the disks.  Goldmoon confronts the dragon on her own.  Raistlin asks Bupu to find the spellbook of Fistandantilus, which by the way now has a brown binding, not night blue.  At this point my stomach was turning over with disgust.

3246872,2,B000Y7U996,"First off, let me say that I still love the books of Dragonlance.
The only positives of this movie are the voice acting and the plot. I felt the plot was pretty faithful to the novel, and the voice acting does fit the characters pretty well. If listened to with the TV off, it's actually an enjoyable audio experience.

The animation is a horrendous mix of CGI dragons and hand-drawn animation, with NO attempt at combining the two. When I first saw the fights between the CGI draconians and the hand-drawn heroes, I double-checked to make sure I wasn't watching some pre-visualization production sequence in the ""extras"" menu. It's bad, really bad. There's one sequence where the CGI character suddenly has 2 arrows appear in his back, stops animating, and just falls over. It's painfully laughable. It looks as if the cel animators and the CGI animators did their parts without ever communicating with each other, and then both works were handed off to a 3rd group to try and mash them together.

To add insult to injury, several final scenes were rendered incorrectly, resulting in a problem known by editors as ""field reversal."" You'll see it in certain scenes where characters are moving left-to-right or right-to-left, and they appear to flicker forward and back in a very artificial and unappealing way. This type of technical problem reinforces that what we are seeing here was an unfinished workprint, which was all that was finished when the money ran out.

My highest hope is that Paramount will take the money from this DVD sale, and re-invest it to finish this movie, which deserves better. Lose the CGI elements in favor of hand-drawn ones that match, and clean up the field-reversed scenes, and this will be a movie to be proud of.",1200355200,10,1746,4.8133333333333335

With that being said, I loved the movie.  I got so relive some of my favorite scenes : Fizban, Flint and the Lake, Tasslehof and Flint's dagger, etc.  It was very enjoyable for that very reason.

On the other hand, I am so very thankful that I actually knew the story.  If I had watched this move w/o anyone to explain more details about the scene, I would probably not have finished it.  The animation was very very low quality.  Scenes did not match on another and there was not ""animated cohesion"" from the beginning to the end of the movie.

BAD PRODUCERS!!  BAD!

It does not work.  It detracts from the final product.  At times, you can mix is very small portions but this movie would have been far better if it had been one or the other.  Plus, I have never seen a movie in which it dedicated all CG to the bad guys and all animation to the good guys...  very odd indeed.

One last note, Mr. Hickman was correct in the fact that the movie should have ended when they started their return trip to solace.  Too many scenes were skipped and the dialoge was too rushed.

In the book the carts are pulled by elk in the movie by horses of some sort, in the book fizban fireballs the cage door, in the movie he uses knock. Stupid meaningless changes, they may be minor things buts they hurt the film for for me.

Also the DVD itself is not very professional. No scene selection? Like someone else mentioned in another review it seems the money for this film was spent on getting some big named voice actors. Frankly I've seen better films done by college kids. I could take a half hour and learn how to produce a better menu then they did.

Overall just disappointing.",1200355200,5,1142,4.419047619047619
3246876,5,B000Y7U996,I read the DragonLance Chronicles and Legends as a child. The books are well written. This film doesn't do the books justice but is still enjoyable. The film should have been 3+hrs. 90 minutes is far too short to tell this story. I'm giving 5 stars because it was a job well done with the 90 minutes we do see. The animation is great. Raistlin in particular looks great. I like how the artist captured the movement in his robes. The CGI and shortness of the film are my only complaints. Nice music and voice acting.,1200355200,5,515,4.375
3246877,3,B000Y7U996,"I had mixed feelings about this as an animated feature, and pretty much still have mixed feelings after seeing it. I am grateful it was not worse, but I also find it frustrating that no one out there in Hollywood seems to understand the full potential of this story.
I remember when I first read the first book by Weis and Hickman and how excellently they conveyed all the emotions and moments, from subtle and hilarious comedy between Tas and Flint to some of the scariest moments of sheer terror in Xak Tsaroth, as well as all of the really deeply developed characters such as Raistlin, Caramon, and Sturm, to the love triangle between Tanis, Laurana and Kitiara. Every character has their own back story and varied personality and the whole story is ripe with many different moral lessons any one of which could be expanded on.
I've always told people that I considered this story to be the greatest fantasy epic since the Lord of the Rings. If somone had the guts to give it the same treatment, I have no doubt it could do as well as Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, if not better! But I would rather see it never reach the big screen than to have it be made into some low budget knock off...",1200355200,5,1206,4.436936936936937
3246878,5,B000Y7U996,"Whenever something like this comes out. A movie of something that was loved as a teen with a great deal of expectation and anticipation its always a bit scary that its going to be murdered.

I was very pleasantly suprised. Especially after having seen the trailer which had worried me even further. I really enjoyed it. I thought all the voice acting was good. They stayed fairly close to the events of the books. Overall it was just a nice experience to see in visual form the stories I'd loved.

I do have a few nitpicky things I didn't like. The animation style..not what I would have choosen. I didn't like that they never really overtly refer to Paladine as the platinum dragon. Though at least the constellation was still dragon shaped. Oh and while they were mostly dead on with the presentation of DnD style magic (suprisingly so for a movie thats usually the first thing the producers get wrong.) they didn't get the fireball right.

Still, none of that really prevented me from enjoying the movie and being very glad it was made. Would have much rather seen a Peter Jackson style live action but I'm happy to have gotten this.",1200355200,8,1136,4.586206896551724
3246879,3,B000Y7U996,"First, I want to thank Tracy for putting in a review from a creator point of view. I have been a longtime Dragonlance fan and have enjoyed reading the first two trilogies many times over and I want to thank You and Margaret for such a great story.

Now for my review of this movie (on it's own merits)

WARNING: SOME SPOILERS

Dragonlance is one of the few trilogies I ever read clear through. That was decades ago. In the past few years, I have been anticipating the release of this movie. I knew about it for at least three years.

I'll admit, I had LOTR type production in mind and would have personally been fully immersed in the Dragonlance movie if production was at least half that of LOTR. Since then, I learned that it was to be animated. I then thought of they style of Final Fantasy: Spirits Within. In fact, that would have been a pleasant format also.

I learned of the actual release date several days ago. I then learned it was a cartoon animation more like the old Saturday morning cartoons. Oh well, I'll give it a try, I said.

At first glance, it reminded me of the old Dungeons & Dragons TV show of the 80's. Then I saw the 3D graphics mixed with 2D animation. The 3D looked good, but had somewhat choppy animation. It also didn't mix well with the 2D half the time (think Van Gogh as if he painted the Mona Lisa).

Graphics aside, the story is there, albeit quite a bit rushed at times. They dropped a lot of the Xak Tsaroth story by distilling it into a ""We Came, We got the disks, We left"" story. Bupu was great comic relief in the books. There be no wicker dragons here. I agree with Tracy, half the first book would have made a feature length story in itself. Also, if I recall the books correctly, Fizban used a fireball to open the slave wagon doors, much to Raistlin's dismay, and not a simple Knock spell.

Still, the 2D/3D mix took some getting used to. After seeing the credits, I think I understand the mix. The 2D stuff was done in Asia and the 3D stuff was done in India. Was the mix intentional, or did each group do what they thought they were supposed to, and due to a production goof, the finished movie was assembled using elements from both.

Still, it puts a moving image to the story. For the longest time, I had my own imaginative impression on what the scenes looked like, based on the book descriptions. I will keep my copy of the DVD. I would never have forgiven myself if I either gave it away or never bought it in the first place.

I hope they do the next book in the series. It appears Tracy hinted to it, but that might just be my perception. Live action would be great, but 2D or 3D will be fine as long as they stick to one format. For those who don't know of the series of books, maybe this will inspire you to read the books. The story is well written and detailed in print form. Maybe if more people are introduced to Dragonlance, with this movie as a catalyst, there will be a better version of the movie in the future.",1200355200,3,2976,4.232804232804233
3246880,1,B000Y7U996,It is painfully obvious that most of the budget for this project was spent attempting to wrangle marginaly popular actors to voice the characters. Dragonlance is best when experienced with ones eyes covered. Enjoy the reasonably executed voice acting and spare yourself the abysmal animation and character design.,1200355200,17,313,5.541666666666667
3246881,4,B000Y7U996,"Like many Dragonlance fans, I was head over heels with delight that there was going to be a movie - something I'd always hoped for since I got caught up in the series. However, from seeing time and again a book that I dearly love being butchered in a movie, I set my expectations low and was bracing myself for a blow.

Boy was I delightedly wrong!

Almost all the voice actors fit perfectly! I admitted that I expected Raistlin to sound a bit more gravelly, or raspy, but his quiet, snarky attitude was brought out wonderfully which made him just as enjoyable as the others.

The CGI with the draconians was a bit disorienting to the mood of the movie. The dragons I could understand, but seeing the animated characters fighting computer ones was a strange experience. As my friends put it as we watched the movie, ""My goodness, they're so much more three dimensional than we are!""

That aside, the rest of the movie was a pure delight. All the important elements were there as well as a few extra lines or moments that bring about smiles and laughter. The moments of comedy were well placed and well played. I cannot WAIT for the next one!

Long live Tasslehoff!",1200355200,3,1164,4.497630331753554
3246882,2,B000Y7U996,"Whooo..where to start? I've been a fan of these books for about 20 years or so. Needless to say that I was psyched to hear of an animated project based on the books. Unfortunately, this falls prey to the typical ""book/video game to movie"" standard.

The animation is about on par with late 80s/early 90s Marvel Saturday morning stuff and at times, the original D&D cartoon. It does not work well for the story being told, IMO.

The movie is PG-13, likely due to some of the violence/blood which is not always at the same level for every fight scene. One fight they show people that were impaled on stakes, people being cooked by fire breathing dragons and blood when creatures are killed. Another fight there's no blood and the creatures are kind of just conked around.

Another thing is the too many seconds spent on Tika's bouncy lady lumps. I get that Caremon is checking her out but it just doesn't work, it feels wrong. Maybe I'm too stuck relating the animation to the cartoons of my youth, where this would be way out of place.

And then there are the dragons and draconians which are all done in CGI. I don't know if you've ever seen CGI characters and traditionally animated characters intergrated in the same scene successfully, but here they aren't. It looks like a bad special effect from a live action movie. The CGI is of the kind you'd find in a Hot Wheels commercial.

The voice acting is not too bad. At first I didn't like Keifer Sutherland as Raistlin, but it grew on me as it went on. He really gets the right attitude down.

For 'extras' you get some character designs and a preliminary animation test. Oh, and some trailers!
If you're familiar with the story and you like it, I'd say rent it...and even then get it from Redbox for $1. If you don't know the story, who knows, maybe you'll like it because you won't be hoping for a lot, but the story may lose you because it's not a generic D&D world and you'll be missing out on a lot of the background...just buy the book!

This series was the first, and one of the only, where I have actually shed tears while reading. I love these stories and that is the reason I may seem to be coming down hard on the movie. It's because I want the movie to be just as good as the books so that anyone not familiar with the books will get the same joy I did from reading them.

I'm hoping that the next 2 (or more) installments will improve as they go.",1200268800,183,2411,4.342222222222222

8231045,5,B000Y7U996,"I am a huge fan of Dragonlance. 30 Years plus. I own multiple copies of the print books. I own both versions of the Graphic Novels. My daughter is named after Takhisis. It is fair to say that I am well versed and opinionated in the subject.

As a casual observer, this film is atrocious. As a Weis and Hickman devout, this is a very hurried version of the first novel. One that only the truly faithful can understand.

It is rushed, it is clipped, and it is not great. However, if you grasp all the nuances, this film will make sense to you.

Overall, it was exceptional to watch with my daughter and explain how the books made a change in my life and how dice chucking and card flopping aren't exactly anathema. While the two of us are extremely close, this film, while poorly made, was able to enable me to explain that in a literal sense what literature can mean.. I just wish that Kitiara and Soth (or the second two Chronicles) could have been continued.

It is worth noting that I named my daughter after Takhisis. This story marked my literary career. This may or may not make me biased.",1511136000,2,1094,4.348039215686274
