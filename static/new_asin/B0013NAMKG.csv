I teach them to my husband to relieve his back issues.  Yes, this dvd uses props but you could roll blankets and use the pillows from your couch.

Also the Yin workout moved a little too fast. Not for beginners in my opinion.

The Yin yoga sequence is excellent. The music is nice, the instructor has a nice a voice, and the poses are held for just the right length of time.",1286236800,2,350,4.303030303030303

I love to do this yin yoga sequence on those days when I am just too tired to even think about doing vinyasa or power yoga.  His voice is very soothing, and his sequencing of poses manages to release every ache or kink in your body.  My husband has noted a marked decrease in his lower back pain! This DVD is worth buying a bolster for (if you don't already have one) even if you are already fairly flexible! This one and Paul Grilley's are my favorites!

3118618,5,B0013NAMKG,Simon Low's Yin & Yang Yoga DVD is a pleasure to practice to. Easily understood with precise and clear  instructions. Lots of alternative or easier versions postures for the less experienced Yogini. Simon's beautiful voice and lovely Sufi poetry combined with relaxing restorative postures make this DVD a joyful and uplifting experience.,1222732800,5,338,5.5
3118619,5,B0013NAMKG,"The practice in this DVD is incredibly grounding and soothing. Especially the Yin. It was almost like I was on the beach doing the practice with Simon and his two companions. He has an incredible ability with language, I find. He conveys the essence of each pose almost effortlessly. I felt transported to another place during the practice. I find him a very inspirational teacher and very much like this yang style of yoga with the qigong influence. It's quite unusual and I have not encountered many teachers who incorporate these other traditions into a yoga practice. There is a great emphasis on fluidity of movement and finding space in the joints and body, whether it's in the yin or the yang practice. I like the fact that you can make it a shorter or longer practice too. Thoroughly recommended for anyone who wants to take a trip off the beaten ashtanga track.

3118620,3,B0013NAMKG,"I bought this dvd because of the yin-yang aspects.  I had never heard of Simon Low and while he has a wonderful manner and voice, I was a little disappointed in the dvd.  I would have liked two 30 minute yangs to do either together or to pick between.  The yin yoga had many props, bolsters, blankets, blocks, etc. which he would explain how to get into the pose, but then he would offer an alternative afterwards that didn't require any prop. I would have preferred to hear about the prop-free pose first and then the other.  It was definitely restorative yoga.  All in all, I will use this dvd on occasion but find I prefer doing Sara Ivanhoe and/or Rodney Yee yoga dvds more.",1214092800,13,678,4.392
3118621,5,B0013NAMKG,"Yin is a series of deeply restorative asanas inspired by Taoist Yoga and are held for several minutes each. Simon Low leads a wonderful beach-side 1 hour session. The Yang practice is 30 min and can be looped for a longer session. It includes a lovely warm up and then flowing sequence which is a beautiful alternative to repetitive sun salutations.

3118623,5,B0013NAMKG,"This is a wonderful video and i highly recommend it in general and particularly if you are a somewhat new student to YIN for the excellent YIN Yoga component Simon offers.  His experience shines through and even if you are more experienced you'll enjoy his approach, and new names for poses based on Taoist/martial arts imagery.  I also appreciate Simon's gentle but precise metaphorical cue-ing, gorgeous backdrop, and the YANG offering being more of a Qi Gong flow than a classic vinyasa flow, having studied some Qi Gong as well.

8252377,5,B0013NAMKG,"This is an excellent dvd for anyone who likes to do yin yoga.  I haven't tried the yang yet because I specifically bought this for the yin practice which is very hard to find on a dvd.  As someone who has been doing yoga in studios for over 10 years, I always feel like you never know what you're going to get when you buy a yoga dvd.  But I am VERY happy with this one.  Some other people commented on the props that the instructor uses, but you really don't need any props at all.  I used  a blanket and rolled it up when needed.  It is totally possible to do all of the poses without a bolster.  And there weren't even any blocks used, except for one of the poses and they were only used to hold elbows off the floor IF you choose to.  Don't be afraid to get this just because you don't have props- they aren't needed.

I will say that yin yoga is typically not for people new to yoga as the poses can be intense since they are held for a long time.  Also, you do have to have some experience with proper form in the poses in order to do this yin dvd because there isn't a whole lot of instructions.  Yin is used as a deep practice to get into the fascia and connective tissues and is a great practice for those who are inflexible.  Just be aware that yin mainly focuses on the hips, low back and core (back) areas more than any other areas.",1475971200,10,1344,4.026415094339622
