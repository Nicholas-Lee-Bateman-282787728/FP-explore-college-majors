3688304,5,B001LNOL5A,"In ""PROXIMA"", no one knows if what's happening is real or not: Is Tony's world a product derived from severe madness? Which reality is the correct one?
""PRXIMA"", a film very much inspired by Philip K. Dick's work, gives no answers: both the ""established"" and the ""fantasy"" worlds are just as valid.
Tony can either choose between rationality or following his dreams... What will he finally do?",1228348800,4,393,4.880597014925373
8319063,5,B001LNOL5A,"In the age of loud and bombastic, it is a tremendous breath of fresh air to find an SF movie that dares to be quirky, intelligent and defiantly its own beast.

Perhaps the best Phillip K. Dick movie that has nothing to do with PKD, you might get a hint of what it's like if you think Primer by way of Alejandro Jodorowski, with bursts of Repo Man absurdity, a hint of Tarkovsky's Stalker, and a truckload of cheap sci fi tropes.

If a foreign language art film with secret powers, black clad commandos, weird cults, deprogrammers, tons of nerdy SF geek references and, yes, even spaceships, sounds like your thing, then give Proxima a try.",1374019200,,639,4.5
8319064,2,B001LNOL5A,"It's bad when someone in the USA gets a camcorder and decides to make a backyard movie with garage style props.  It's downright painful when someone in another country does the same and then inflicts on you the need to ""Read"" the movie to get to the end.  This movie would have been far more enjoyable had the producers dubbed the film in english and then allowed the film to be ""Riffed"" for some humor.  If you are looking for a Sci Fi flick this is not it!  Move on the next film in your list.",1354492800,,495,4.125
8319065,1,B001LNOL5A,"Clearly Ed Wood is alive and well in Mexico, please don't waste your time. Rambling wreck of sci-fi at it's worst. Even Syfy channel wouldn't air this drain clog, flush before watching.",1350864000,,185,4.8125
8319066,3,B001LNOL5A,"Its tough making low-budget sci-fi!  Proxima never quite settles into itself to me.  Like watching a movie on an old VHS player from the 80's, the tracking needs some adjustment to make the thought-world its offering come into line.  Its warps in and out of being a B-movie homage and a eye-narrowing conspiracy-esque trader in ideas of other dimensions. The wind of intelligent cynicism for pop-conspiracy falls away and leaves the flag of ideas limp on the flag pole.  When you don't have the money for sets and special affects then ideas, strong acting and sharp dialogue (not to mention believable restraints imprisoning someone on a bed) are your tools to turn that lack into a strength.  Proxima never finds its way on this front.  As a valiant attempt at low-budget sci-fi it does well in a few places but surely it will remain a show reel for what might have been achieved with sharper minds at the helm in the script writing and filming & editing.  It seems obvious in certain places that the need to get through shooting was more pressing than the desire to get a great scene.",1317686400,,1086,4.654450261780105
8319067,4,B001LNOL5A,"Very interesting low budget Spanish psychological Sci-Fi film, with a quirky sense of humor.

It has holes and weak spots, but I admire its aiming high, and using its tiny budget to the fullest.

In terms of genre, this has more in common with `Man Who Fell To Earth' and `Solaris' than `Star Wars'.  It's about
a shlub sci-fi geek, who may have found a metaphysical portal to another world, or may just be losing his mind.

Full of interesting images and music, at times it gets too cute or clever for it's own good,  at other times it drags,
and the acting is occasionally uneven, but it's certainly more thought provoking than a lot of what's out there.",1308700800,,656,4.4789915966386555
8319068,4,B001LNOL5A,"A refreshing change from the humdrum of what we call ""movies"" in the US.  Very much worth the rental and patience needed to get through the film.  Style and presentation are unique, and I loved the low-budget feel.  I have more to say but don't want to ruin things, so the short version: ""If you feel like watching true2life grass-roots sci-fi, this is an homage.  If you expect blockbuster luster, you're in the wrong bar"".",1260835200,4,424,4.613333333333333
8319069,1,B001LNOL5A,"Description: Science fiction video store owner and fan Tony (Oriol Aubets) fails at both his business and his relationship with his girlfriend Natalia (Karen Owens), but, after a trip to a science fiction convention to see author Flix Cadecq (Manuel Sols), Tony comes to believe he is part of small cell of people who know the world will end in a year and are expecting an alien fleet from Proxima Centauri to arrive. Is it true, has he been brainwashed or is he insane? Can he really travel to Proxima Centauri using the power of a hypnotic CD? Is there a planet less interesting than Earth? Will Tony's detachment from reality ever have a practical use?

Review: Make no mistake. This is not a good film. I stumbled across this film on Amazon VOD because of its high rating and was sorely disappointed. This is a zero budget science fiction fan-centric labor of love from Spain. I'm always on the lookout for undiscovered gems and this isn't one of them. Although my description reads like the storyline from a comedy, this film is played straight. The movie doesn't really move into science fiction territory until the second half and that's when the glacial pace of the first half gets even slower. The storyline has the quality of filmed fanfic and even though the dialogue is heavy handed, it's not quite good enough to be a good ""bad"" film. The subtext, what there is of it, is flimsy, there is the obligatory rote attack on religion and the film contains a random hodgepodge of shallow half-baked tin foil hat ideas.

Another reviewer elsewhere on Amazon mentioned the influence of Philip K. Dick on Proxima and I think that's being overly generous. Although the film makes obvious and not so obvious references to both Philip K. Dick and his work, the film attempts (and fails) to borrow credibility by referencing credible science fiction rather than providing a true homage. The trappings are there, but not the substance. The deep thought that Philip K. Dick brought to his work on the topics of the nature of reality and paranoia is nowhere in evidence.

The overall quality of the photography is somewhat muted, like a poor quality VHS transfer. Locations include a carwash, a sci-fi convention that looks more like an insurance conference, a rundown video store, a rundown apartment, a dusty road and field, a crumbling church, a rundown warehouse and a dusty strip mine. In other words, if you were a college student you could have taken your parents home video camera out for a weekend and filmed this yourself, probably with higher production values. The one star is divided between maintaining a somewhat coherent narrative throughout the film (half a star for not being incomprehensible) and another half star for having the stones to actually release this as a film.

I'm a total science fiction geek who watches a ton of both American and foreign genre and non-genre films. Between the outdated detached from reality sci-fi fan stereotype, the lack of serious development of any of the science fiction ideas, special effects that have the quality of an early 1970's Canadian made for TV movie and the deus ex machina ending, I can't figure out who the intended audience for this film is. My recommendation is to save two hours of your life that I wish I could get back myself and miss this completely forgettable film.

For a better recent film featuring science fiction fans as protagonists, see Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel (2009).",1260144000,22,3471,4.826890756302521
8319070,5,B001LNOL5A,"This is a trippy mind-blast from phenomenal Spanish auteur Carlos Atanes.

The film starts simply with Tony (Oriol Aubets), a total nerd who is obsessed with sci-fi movies and books. When his favorite author, Felix Cadecq (Manel Sol&aacute;s), claims that aliens actually exist, Tony is the only person who believes him.

As Tony begins his journey to find out the truth, he becomes involved with a secret cult and his reality begins to degrade. Is Tony actually going to have his wildest dreams fulfilled or has he completely lost his mind?

Atanes gives no easy answers with his film that's clearly been influenced by the work of Philip K. Dick. Aubets plays Tony with the perfect pitch of hopeful optimism so that the audience is really rooting for him to succeed in his quest despite how far-fetched the plot grows around him. Atanes is also very suggestive with his special effects, giving us just a hint of what may or not be real.",1242432000,5,937,4.736196319018405
