4217436,4,B003XMKU2A,"This is a series of informative presentations with each one going into the things you would see (excellent Blu-ray), the history, and culture of the area.  Well worth the purchase and time to watch.  Why 4 stars, not 5?  Seems 5 stars are reserved for BBC productions.",1328745600,11,268,4.659574468085107
4217437,3,B003XMKU2A,"Unless you are into desert-like and rugged landscapes, this may not be the film for you. I prefer greenery; I was hoping to see beautiful scenery. But most of this blu ray contained dry, rocky landscapes and sparse vegetation. Lots of dirt and rocks, that's for sure. Some caves.

It did have a segment on Muir Woods which I thought was astoundingly wonderful. After that one, it went right back to rocky, dry, desolate landscapes. Some people enjoy this sort of thing, I don't. Looking at all those dry, hot landscapes, one after another, it just wasn't what I had hoped for. For all the beauty that America offers, why did they choose these?",1311033600,16,643,4.640350877192983
4217438,5,B003XMKU2A,"We bought this from Borders (sorry Amazon!) for a mere $5. I figured $5 is worth the risk that this set would turn out dull and boring. Au contraire! This DVD set is spectacular! Our family has been riveted to each episode, which highlights social history, ecology, and geographic past of the region. I can't believe this cost me only a few Washingtons, because this set is a pure treasure for American history/geography enthusiasts. I only wish they had more volumes, because I'd buy them all. Can't recommend enough...",1310860800,48,520,4.853932584269663

This 2-disk set gives you a great whirlwind tour of some fantastic places.  I really enjoyed the Devil's Tower, brought back memories of Close Encounters of the Third Kind (another good video, though fictional).  What makes this video particularly interesting for me is the focus on history, one of my all-tie favorite subjects.  You'll get a great tour of many fantastic places, bringing early American history to life.  It also touches on geology, Native American heritage, Biodiversity, and so much more.

4217651,1,B003XMKU2A,"These doco's are produced on the cheap.  Most of the content is interviews with a Parks Officer at each site.  There is a lot of programming packed into the two Blue Rays so the quality of picture is extremely poor in full hd, and the color is somehow washed out.  Some of the shots are quite amateurish with the non stabilised camera held while the guy walked.  I worked my way through most of it and learned a little here and there.  I gave it away to a charity shop.
Each segment starts with a virtual tour which is not a virtual tour.  Then there is a set format for the next two bits.  I found it boring as all hell, the narrator has a sonorous voice that is really artificial.  Want to shoot yourself?  Watch this first.
There was a well researched programme on the history of American national parks on our local television some time ago, that was great, this isn't it.  Don't believe the positive reviews.",1394582400,35,913,4.349112426035503
4217652,5,B003XMKU2A,"I  thought I  did a review on this one.  Evidently, I failed  to say  America's National Treasure  is  a  Great  video set.
Information combined with great scenery.  I  placed a second order, after watching it.  The second order was for  gifts
for Christmas.  Seven hours  of  great entertainment  for  under ten dollars.  A magazine off a rack cost almost that much.
In my opinion, this is better  then many  National Geographic  sets, and  they cost more.  Watch it  and  donate it to your
local library, if  you think you can not watch it again.  It is like visiting  the parks  and  history is added.  Looks great on big screen.

4217680,5,B003XMKU2A,"These were an inexpensive way for me to try out my new Blu-ray player which I know would be playing my existing DVDs most of the time.

They don't have quite the ""polish"" of a National Geographic special, but I think that works to their advantage.  I didn't feel quite so emotionally led by the nose through all the great scenery.  The info about the geological origins and subsequent history of these landmarks is presented in a no-nonsense fashion by people who are not Hollywood actors trying to show off.  I think I bought several discs in this series and was surprised by how many hours it takes to go through them all.  You definitely can't watch them all in one sitting (I tried).",1342915200,21,687,4.508064516129032
4217681,5,B003XMKU2A,What a beautiful and educational video.  I bought it for my 10 year old grand daughter who loves earth science in any form!  She loved the film and I did too!,1342742400,,158,4.064516129032258

4217683,1,B003XMKU2A,"I really enjoy documentaries, especially about nature. When I bought this, I expected beautiful, sweeping vistas and interesting information. I got neither. This production house creates the most amateur videos I've ever seen. It may be in blu-ray, but the images are far from stunning, the script seems oddly partisan and politcal, the hosts are more like drones, and some of the information they present isn't accurate. Skip this and save yourself the five bucks and hours of your life you'll never be able to get back.",1335657600,14,521,5.0
4217684,1,B003XMKU2A,"This is without question, the worst video I have ever bought, and after I wasted my time watching it I was so angry over the amateurs who created this video, much of the history quoted in the video is totally incorrect, their account for how certain beautiful landscapes were created is the evolution idea of how it occurred, which are each one totally false and without any historical evidence what so ever to support these statements, I threw the disk in the trash Thank goodness I did not pay very much money for the disk. A word of good advice to those considering buying the video, if a video is too cheap to believe, always remember this, there is a reason why the video is inexpensive and that is usually it isn`t worth even watching. One last thing this video is nothing like what you might be thinking it is like this picture perfect landscape across America, it is nothing what so ever like this don`t wast your money!!!",1335052800,12,930,4.508875739644971
4217685,5,B003XMKU2A,"I am thoroughly enjoying watching this series. It is like taking a tour - the commentators are park guides, all very enthusiastic about their jobs at the National Monuments. Scientists and historians are also interviewed - giving solid information about the sites. As an Australian, who has enjoyed travel and especially the USA, I found myself learning more about American history, geography and culture from this informative and well photographed series. Do not expect action thrills and chills, but it is a great Blu Ray to teach the kids, and yourselves more about the USA, and the American heritage the citizens and tourists can enjoy.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Harper-Trading-System/dp/1441404953/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Harper Trading System</a>",1334707200,6,806,6.27027027027027

4217687,3,B003XMKU2A,There are so many really wonderful documentaries out that and this one is not going to be getting a lot of great reviews I am sure. It is not bad but could have been much better. I enjoyed it and did learn a bit from it but I think it suffered by not having enough production value even though having some great subject matter. It was worth the money as it was not expensive so I am not disappointed.,1329436800,28,400,4.075949367088608
4217688,5,B003XMKU2A,"For only $5 at Target, I must say this Blu-ray packed in a lot of beautiful landscapes for the money. The older shots (not as sharp in definition as the newer ones) were narrated by actor Bo Svenson with the later ones by Jordan Murphy. Each location was sited on the map at the intoduction, which is helpful for travelers. I especially like to watch the desolation of the vast Great Plains where the wild buffalos used to roam and feel the solitude the deserts provide as respite for the harried life of urban dwellers. More coverage of the western Black Hills and the Badlands would have been welcomed. But of course this would only make the whole video overly long to watch considering its already lenghty 7 hours of runtime as is. Like the Grand Canyon, these other magnificent desert National Parks would just make another great Blu-ray videos by themselves.",1328832000,56,863,4.684210526315789
