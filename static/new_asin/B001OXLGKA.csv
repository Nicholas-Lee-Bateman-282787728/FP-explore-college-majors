3736623,4,B001OXLGKA,"At long last, Vol. 5 is being released, bridging the gap between two great comics. These final handful of Curly shorts are sometimes painful to watch, as Curly's health continued to deteriorate. Some were just not up to the same level of the earlier ones, and it's obvious when Columbia tries to ""cover up"" Curly's illness with clips from past shorts or ""Curly"" body doubles. It was a sad fate for such a gifted comedic talent. As Moe once said of his younger brother: ""He was a talented comic; a genius in his field"". Well put, Moe!
The good news: Shemp returns! While he's no Curly--he never tried to be!--Shemp is terribly underrated. Even when the material is slight, he's a very good comic who can hold his own.
This stage was an important transition for the team. And this particular volume should be interesting to watch.",1233532800,11,828,4.639455782312925
3736624,5,B001OXLGKA,"I enjoy the later short films of the stooges, too, made & released into the 50's and shown on TV.  The actor who replaced Shemp wasn't quite as slapstick as the others, but he was okay in his own right and the films are still fun to watch.  Also, it's enjoyable to see actors alive today (or recently deceased) playing bit parts in some of the later Three Stooges films.",1233100800,2,370,4.271428571428571
3736625,5,B001OXLGKA,"I'm certain there are others who agree Shemp was the best Stooge.

Far more subtle than Curly, Shemp was a master at underplaying in these genreally broad comedy gems.  While Curly was very physical and in-your-face, the more intellectual Shemp was a master of facial expression and tonal nonsense.  Thus more appealing.

""Fuelin' Around"" is a fave.  In it, Shemp names the secret fuel sideways; and it always elicits a huge laugh from me.

Perhaps it was his great disdain for and disbelief in Stoogic violence that caused him to hang back.  However, in other roles his acting was nuanced as well.  He reminds me of WC Fields.

Thank you Sony for (seemingly) releasing all the shorts.  Not much of a risk for you though.  They're selling like hotcakes.

Now, about Larry . . .",1233014400,12,777,4.674074074074074
3736626,5,B001OXLGKA,"Just because Curly is gone by 1946/47 doesn't mean that one should not buy this Volume 5.  Shemp is in some of my favorite shorts!  I was a little worried that once the DVDs were released with all the Curly shorts, that Columbia would quit.  Thanks Columbia for continuing with the series and I hope you release EVERY last one of the Stooges shorts - all the way thru after Shemp left too!",1232668800,12,389,4.301369863013699

Larry, Moe and Curly Make Their Return to DVD

THE THREE STOOGES COLLECTION Volume Five: 1946 - 1948

25 ""Fan Requested"" Digitally-Remastered Shorts,
are Arranged Chronologically and Packaged in a Two-Disc DVD

AVAILABLE ON MARCH 17

CULVER CITY, CALIF. (January 13, 2009) - The Three Stooges goof their way back onto DVD March 17th when Sony Pictures Home Entertainment launches The Three Stooges Collection Volume Five: 1946-1948.

The Three Stooges are one of the most influential screen comedy teams of the 20th century and have been an inspiration to generations of comics that followed. Following their start in vaudeville, the trio's film career began in the early 1930s, reached its slapstick peak during their tenure at Columbia Pictures (1934-1957) and lasted well into the 1950s. After their initial retirement, they were rediscovered by an enthusiastic new generation through the medium of television and have surpassed all their contemporaries in terms of lasting popularity.

The Three Stooges Collection Volume Five: 1946 - 1948 episodes include:

Beer Barrel Polecats
A Bird in the Head
Uncivil Warbirds
Three Troubledoers
Monkey Businessmen
Three Loan Wolves
G.I Wanna Home
Rhythm and Weep
Three Little Pirates
Half-Wits' Holiday

Crime on Their Hands

3736628,5,B001OXLGKA,"So other reviews are trying to sell this set of Stooges shorts short.  So Volume 5 ""fails to measure up to the ones that preceded them?""  WRONGO, baloney breath! Some of their best work is contained in Volume 5. I own the first 4 volumes of this ""new"" series from Sony Pictures - as well as all of the sets previously issued by Columbia Studios and some Stooges shorts on VHS - and IMHO, Volume 5 contains some of the Stooges BEST work.  In particular, several of the Shemp shorts in this set (i.e., ""Brideless Groom,"" ""Sing a Song of 6 Pants,"" ""Squareheads of the Round Table,"" ""Fiddler's Three,"" ""Hot Scots,"" and ""Heavenly Daze"") are outstanding examples of the finest work ever done by any combination of Stooges.  I had been hoping that Sony Pictures wouldn't quit with the Curly shorts, but would continue all the way through to the end of those including Shemp.  It looks like that will be the case, and all fans of the Stooges are the beneficiaries.  I can't wait for Volume 6 - with (hopefully) a digitally remastered version of ""Malice in the Palace"" - one of my all-time favorite Stooges shorts.
Gee-gee-gee-gee-gee!"" Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!"" ""Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk,"" and ""Soitenly!""",1232064000,11,1193,4.795121951219512
3736629,5,B001OXLGKA,"I've been a fan of Three Stooges for over ten years and I've got countless vhs and dvds of the boys. I was very happy when the sets came out in rapid succession but stopped after Volume four. Now Volume 5 is going be released and here comes Shemp! i've always liked Shemp as a third stooge and I think is detective shorts like Who Done It?, Blunder Boys, Hot Scots, and Crash Goes The Hash was some of the Stooges best work. I hope they release all Shemp shorts, even there are many duplicates and some after Shemp's death with stand in Joe De Palma. I ordered right away!",1231804800,11,572,4.209090909090909
3736630,5,B001OXLGKA,"i just want to say that i have been a stooge fan for over 45 years and wanted to state that the stooges never produced a bad episode . I love all the episode with all the people used in the 190 shorts and movies .Am so glad for vol. 5 and wanted to thank Sony for keeping there 190 episodes coming . I like to thank amazon for being the first to keep us fans informed when they do come out ,,,,,,,,, ""great job Sony and Amazon""! I love all the stuff the THREE STOOGES did and so apprecaited to hopefully have the full 190 episode in my home and in my heart ! Thanks again. A real STOOGE fan !",1231804800,25,592,3.860655737704918
3736631,5,B001OXLGKA,"Most people don't realize that Shemp Howard (Moe's older brother)was the ""first"" third stooge with Moe & Larry. He quit to strike out on his own right before the Stooges started making their famous short films.

Moe then got his younger brother Jerome to join them. He shaved his head and called himself Curly. He spoke in a high falsetto voice because his normal voice sounded too much like Moe.

Curly frequently forgot his lines and that's where his famous ""woo woo woo"" came from. He would blurt that out when he forgot his lines and then ad lib it!

While not as funny as Shemp's ""ee bee bee bee"", it still made him famous.

After Curly's demise, Moe called up Shemp and he returned. His style of humor was legendary. He had done some work with Abbott and Costello. He was so much funnier than them that Costello saw to it that most of Shemp's work ended up on the cutting room floor.

Curly did a nice job filling in for Shemp but it was great when the original finally returned and left us with so many gems!",1231372800,44,1015,4.349206349206349
3736632,5,B001OXLGKA,"While this collection of shorts fails to measure up to the ones that preceded them, this is an important point in the career of The Three Stooges.

The shorts on this volume represent the height of Curly's sad demise - by 1946, he was very ill and ultimately never returned to the act on a full-time basis after suffering a stroke during the filming of Half Wits Holiday. These final Curly shorts are among the worst of his Stooge years but for very understandable reasons. He had a brief cameo in 1947's Hold That Lion, which is featured on this set.

When Curly couldn't continue as a member of the team, Shemp returned and would stay with them until his own death in 1955. Shemp is criminally underrated by the average fan. He wasn't Curly, but Shemp was a very gifted comic in his own right. Curly and Shemp were two very different comics but both excelled at their type of comedy. Give Shemp a shot.",1231200000,71,904,4.4397590361445785

3736707,5,B001OXLGKA,"A turning point in the legendary career of The Three Stooges. As I'm sure everyone already knows, Curly suffered a series of small strokes which affected his performance starting with ""If a Body Meets a Body"" and continuing on into the shorts covering the 1946-47 period.

It can be tough watching Curly struggle through some of these shorts--but I find that Moe & Larry for the most part, make up for it with some fine comedic performances of their own. No doubt, there are some stinkers on this set (Beer Barrel Polecats; A Bird in the Head) but there are some gems as well. ""G.I. Wanna Home"" may be the best one yet--once again owing to the teamwork of Moe and Larry, and those outdoor home scenes were a childhood favorite of mine and still crack me up as an adult.

Unfortunately, Curly suffered a major stroke before completing his last film ""Half-Wits Holiday"" and was forced to retire from the act. But the end of one happy association led into the beginning of another, as the more than capable & downright funny Shemp Howard stepped back into the role of third stooge and showed that he was the right man for the job.

Shemp reasserts himself back into the stooges with ease on his first try--the excellent ""Fright Night"" and within a few shorts of that turned in arguably his greatest performance as a stooge in the all-time classic ""Brideless Groom""--which looks better than ever on this dvd set.

I don't know if people who are not Shemp fans will be won over by this set--and how anyone can watch a film like ""Brideless"" and not admit how funny Shemp was is beyond me--but for me the Shemp era comes as a refreshing change of pace from the ""sick"" Curly era. Of course, I've always loved Shemp from childhood, so my opinion might be a little biased.

Either way, this is a marvelous collection and a worthy addition to any stooge fan's personal library (Gargle with old razorblades).

3736710,4,B001OXLGKA,"This collection overlaps Curly's decline with Shemp's return to the Three Stooges.  Shemp's return is not to be dismissed, as it kept the act going strong for many more years.  Most of the Curly shorts in this collection fall short of his earlier brilliance.  His failing health is evident in many of the shorts.  However, it was well masked in ""Three Little Pirates,"" the best Curly short in this set.  I always feel sad watching ""Half-Wits' Holiday,"" because it was Curly's last feature (not counting a cameo in ""Hold That Lion"") and Curly disappears in the last one-third, having suffered a major stroke during the filming.
I won't delve into the eternal Curly-Shemp debate except to say each one brought his own talents to the table.  Shemp was great in ""Brideless Groom,"" which features the most violent (and funny) bit by beloved supporting actress, Christine McIntyre.  The remaining Shemp shorts are probably the strongest for Shemp.  Later on, weaker scripts and smaller budgets started to erode the quality and freshness.  But the Shemp shorts in this collection are quite decent.  The guy had a rubber face and was a gifted physical comedian.  Moe and Larry were the constants in this period, and they always hold up their end of the show.
For Stooge fans, this collection is a worthwhile addition.
On a personal note, I always feel a bit sad when I watch Stooges shorts, knowing the boys are long gone.  However, anytime one can leave behind films that make people laugh decades and generations later, that's quite a wonderful legacy!",1333411200,4,1546,4.881226053639847

3736713,5,B001OXLGKA,"This is a review for ""The Three Stooges Collection Vol 5: 1946-1948,
two discs of digitally remastered Three Stooges shorts orignally made
for Columbia Pictures and now released as DVDs by Sony.

This collection of 25 remastered comedy short subjects finds the Stooges
in a period of transition.  Curly Howard, arguably the most popular Stooge,
suffered a series of strokes while appearing in the first ten shorts--
his health was noticably declining--and ultimately was forced to retire.

After Curly left he was replaced by older brother Shemp,  an original
Stooge,who had a totally different style of comedy but made a nice fit
after many years of appearing in films on his own.  Shemp, who physically
resembled Moe, was an unaggresive as a Stooge could be but still fit
into the Stooge scheme of things as if he had been with them during
their entire film career.

A couple of outstanding titles in this set are ""3 Little Pirates,"" which
is probably Curly's best short in this collection.  And Shemp shines in
titles like ""The Brideless Groom"" (""Hold hands, you lovebirds!""),
""Sing A Song Of Sixpants"" and ""Hot Scots.""

All in all, despite the personal tragedy this set reminds us of, it is
still a wonderful collection of comedy shorts, guaranteed to raise
smiles and chase gloom.  And despite controversy that I'm sure lives on to
this day, The Three Stooges Collection Vol 5 shows that although Shemp's
brand of comedy is certainly different than Curly's, it fits into the Stooges' scenarios just as well.

Five Stars without hesitation.",1278547200,3,1544,4.949612403100775
3736714,4,B001OXLGKA,"The Three Stooges Collection#5 gives us their shorts ranging in dates from Jan. 10/46 to Dec. 9/48. As we all know this is the set that we bid a fond farewell to arguably the most beloved of all Stooges,Jerry ""Curly"" Howard,younger brother to Moe and Shemp. He obviously wasn't in the greatest of shape during this the nadir of his career,as his movements and especially his delivery is much slower. When Shemp took Curly's place it was made clear that he was only subbing temporarily for his brother whom he expected to eventually return;but it was unfortunately never to be.
Curly's swan song as a full time Stooge was in Half Wits Holiday,a remake of their earlier short Hoi Polloi and footage from this film would be used several times in future shorts. We see Curly one last time in Shemp's third outing Hold That Lion. Curly is sleeping in a seat and when they lift up his hat he goes into a typical Curly sleeping routine c/w the funny snoring and barking like a dog.
Introduced into the Stooges world as supporting players during this period is prolific character actor Phil Van Zandt,Emil Sitka,Kenneth McDonald and Dee Green. Dee would be seen in many funny shorts,usually as the tall ugly girl foisted on one of the Stooges. It didn't take long for Shemp to hit his stride and in his fourth outing in Brideless Groom he is seen as a voice teacher with Dee Green as his towering,overly eager and smitten pupil. Shemp's takems as Dee tries to hit those high notes are priceless. From a strictly acting point of view it is also interesting to note Moe's reaction in Shemp's first short with the gang in Fright Night. Moe almost over reacts to Shemp's shenanigans at times but he is obviously trying to build Shemp up as the newest member and maybe get comfortable with his own brother back into the fold after many years apart. Shemp by now had been in umpteen movies as a supporting player working for various studios. He was never out of work for long and his great acting chops and comic sensibilities are right on the money throughout. Once a Stooge,always a Stooge?
One will see amongst these shorts Moe trying out Curly's clam in the soup routine(that in turn being from an old Billy Bevan short),sad to say that Moe's version doesn't measure up to Curly's. And as I said in my review of Vol#4  Moe once thought that Abbott and Costello stole some of their material. Well Moe gets them back by using Bud and Lou's money counting routine. In it Lou,expecting a fair split,ended up either with just a dollar or owing Bud money! I will let you decide how Moe makes out.
However the gag men in Shemps first three outings seemed not to have had many original ideas as they used the same routine in all three. The routine is the use of crates as a focal point with the boys being chased around and through them. In the first two the editors decided it would be funny in both to speed up the action and the sound. They looked Keystone-ish and sounded like chipmunks in the process. In the third the crates were there again  but at least the action was left at normal speed.
As far as the borrowing of gags go I saw a couple of Keaton inspired shorts in the Stooges Uncivil Warbirds(Keaton's own Columbia short of Aug/39 Mooching Through Georgia) and in Brideless Groom(Keaton's feature of 1925 Seven Chances).I also saw a little of the Laurel and Hardy Aug/29 short the Perfect Day seeping into the Stooges Pardon My Clutch. Also Fright Night would be used almost intact and remade in Jan/55 as Fling in the Ring,Monkey Businessmen was inspired by the Smith and Dale early 30s Paramount Short Mutiny on the Body,footage from Hold That Lion would be reused in the March/53 short Booty and the Beast,Squareheads of the Roundtable footage would be reused in Sept/54 as Knutzy Knights,Heavenly Daze footage would be reused in Apr/55 as Bedlam in Paradise,Hot Scots footage would be reused and remade in Nov/54 as Scotched in Scotland and I'm a Monkey's Uncle footage would be reused and remade in June/55 as Stone Age Romeos. As I have said before this is the biggest fault I have with these comedies;Columbia's decisions to constantly reuse gags,plots and sets over and over again ad nauseum. The farther in this series we go the more it is noticeable. The Stooges could have done so much with better gag men. Even though people like Bruckman,Chase,Adler et al were some of the most imaginative gag men,their best days unfortunately were well behind them. And with Columbia's penchant for turning out quick and cheaper product,this sacrificed the one thing many of them needed the most;quality.t is really a miracle and one must say a testimony to the Three Stooges talent,that they had such a long lived life in the field of comedy shorts as they did. The new up and coming medium of television would give them such a boost that it virtually reignited their careers which was just a few short years away from this sets time period.
This set is another fitting and decidedly must have set of the Three Stooges shorts from /46-/48. Like the previous editions this set has been remastered onto high def prints and the shorts have never looked nor sounded better than they have today.

3736717,3,B001OXLGKA,"Apart from Curly Howard's ill health, the Three Stooges' Columbia two-reelers already showed signs of decline in 1945. Budgetary cutbacks, erratic scripts and director Del Lord's departure were contributing factors. Unfortunately, some of the 1946 shorts in this DVD set represent the Stooges at their worst. In fairness, not even Curly in his prime could redeem such clunkers as ""Uncivil War Birds,"" ""Three Loan Wolves"" and ""G.I. Wanna Home""  all helmed by the increasingly heavy-handed Jules White. The team fared better under Edward Bernds' direction, with ""A Bird in the Head,"" ""The Three Troubledoers"" and ""Monkey Businessmen"" emerging as good comedies despite Curly's worsening condition.  Shortly before suffering a debilitating stroke in May 1946, the immortal Stooge rallied back for his last classic performance in ""Three Little Pirates""  highlighted by the famous ""Maha-Aha"" routine. Curly's retirement signaled the return of his older brother Shemp, whose adept comic skill helped revitalize the trio amid Columbia's lower production values (the recycled stock footage would arrive later). Along with the change in team chemistry came a gradual shift from lavish Mack Sennett-style slapstick to stage-bound situation comedy. Sony's remastered 1946-48 collection includes several of Moe, Larry and Shemp's best shorts: ""Out West,""  ""Sing a Song of Six Pants,"" ""All Gummed Up,"" ""Heavenly Daze"" and the fan favorite ""Brideless Groom"" (a reworking of Buster Keaton's 1925 feature ""Seven Chances"").

The ending where the three stooges are yelling in breakdown frustration is both chilling and hilarious. the concept of the story is chaotic.

3736730,5,B001OXLGKA,"No, I am NOT claiming that the 190 Stooge comedies are cinematic masterpieces, but their 24-year consecutive run of filmaking is, in some ways, a CHRONICLE of American pop-culture as seen through the eyes of Hollywood---and the fact that these short films are virtually the ONLY such documentation still being watched by a sizeable portion of the viewing public makes their historical content that much more valuable.

How many of the Curly films of the late 1930's depict the Stooges as out-of-work panhandlers in desparate need of a job?  THERE'S the Great Depression preserved on film (often photographed on the actual streets of
Hollywood and L.A.) which young people today are still watching--and in black and white to boot! The insights into the Hollywood Studio system are also fascinating...especially when one realizes that ALMOST EVERY one of the major studios was producing short subjects: comedies, ""how-to"" films, documentaries, cartoons, etc..that served as part of the typical movie-going experience in the days before TV.  And the Stooge shorts were only ONE comedy series that was being produced by Columbia Studios--and the only one that has survived into the 21st Century! A little historical background REALLY enhances one's appreciation of these comic gems.

And as we guffaw along with the Stooges into the 1940's, we also gain a greater appreciation for Hollywood's contribution to the American war
propaganda machine, as the Stooges lampoon Hitler and his minions, confront Nazi sailors, escaped Japanese prisoners, enemy spies, the post-war housing shortage, etc, all as part of Hollywood's effort to bolster morale during war-time.

Volume #5 is notable for a number of reasons:

1.) it includes the final ten shorts featuring Curly, in which we see his sad physical condition sapping the energy out of the trio---it's really painful to watch him endure any type of physical abuse in these films, since it's obvious that he was a shadow of his former self. Much of the action (that is, abuse) was shifted to Larry, which makes these films almost feel like a 2-man comedy team with a third guy added as an afterthought.  Still, Curly did his professional best to the very end.

2.) The changing TONE of the American movie-going public can be seen in Volume #5; as the post-war euphoria faded and the delayed reaction to the trauma of the war era set in, many Hollywood films became much DARKER in tone, with the ascent of the Crime Drama genre.  Notice how many of the early Shemp films deal with ""noir-ish"" crime elements.  Again, the Stooge shorts capture and preserve this sociological trend in American entertainment for new generations of viewers to experience.

3.) The ascent of the Edward Bernds/Hugh McCollum production team at Columbia. Watch for their names on the opening credits; Ed Bernd's direction and writing were very distinctive:  he did the best he could with the ailing Curly Howard, producing a couple of first-rate efforts (""Microphonies"" and ""3 Little Pirates"").  But with the wise-cracking
Shemp Howard, Bernds really hit his stride, as the team turned out one hilarious but classy comedy after another.  And even though long-time stalwart director Jules White held his own for a while, his work would soon being to deteriorate.

4.) SHEMP HOWARD HIMSELF!! --- BOY, did he breathe new life and energy into these films OR WHAT??!  No one would claim that the Shemp comedies really match the early Curly films in sheer quality---but Shemp and Curly were ENTIRELY DIFFERENT comedic beings, and the resulting chemistry between each of them and Moe and Larry produced a VERY different sort of dynamic---BOTH of which I find equally enjoyable. But be aware that the ECONOMICS of film-making had changed drastically during and after the war; due to budget cuts in production, that wonderfully sunny, open-air feeling of so many Curly films of the late 30's was now replaced by the darker, grittier, much more mundane setting and feeling of the Shemp comedies, which only serves to emphasize the major shift in their tone.

But Shemp was a HELL of a funny comedian...and his arrival on the scene THANKFULLY revived the Stooges and propelled them into their ""Second Golden Age"", especially when director Ed Bernds was at the helm.  The Stooge shorts not only provide us with hilarious and outlandish entertainment but also, within limits, a glimpse of American pop-cultural history through the middle of the 20th-century as captured and preserved on film.",1240272000,11,4496,5.093877551020408
3736731,5,B001OXLGKA,"With this set we get the changing of an era. Curly-Q was no longer able to perform so Shemp is asked to replace him. This was, originally, to be on a temporary basis but, alas, this was not to be. Shemp would replace Curly permanently as the Stooges carried on in their slapstick merriment.

As with all the Stooge sets so far in the Collection there are two discs & we're treated to 25 shorts. The first 10 shorts feature Curly & there's a noticeable difference in his performance of the last few. It's unfortunate for Shemp that he had to replace a comic genius. I think most will agree that the Stooges lost a little bit when the change had to be made. Don't get me wrong, Shemp has his own personality but replacing Curly wasn't an easy thing to do.

""Beer Barrel Polecats"" is one of their more famous shorts. The Stooges decide to brew their own beer with disastrous results (was there ever any OTHER kind of result?). They end up in prison doing their unforgettable routine of painting on guard uniforms over their prison garb.

""A Bird in the Head"" has our boys getting tangled up with a mad scientist who wants to swap out Curly's brain with a gorilla's.

""Uncivil Warbirds"" takes place during the American Civil War. Moe & Larry join the Union but Curly joins the South.

""Three Troubledoers"" finds the Stooges in a Western setting. The Stooges help Nell i order to rescue her father from Badlands Blackie who wants to marry her.

""Monkey Businessmen"" has the Stooges as Electricians who are badly in need of some R & R.

""Three Loan Wolves"" has the boys caring for a baby who's been left on their doorstep.

""G.I. Wanna Home"" finds the Stooges homeless after their discharge from the Army. Their outdoor home without walls is classic.

""Rhythm & Weep"" we find the Stooges are about to commit suicide after being rejected by a talent agency. They go to the rooftop of a building only to find three women about to do the same thing. After discovering they can be an act together all is well; or as about as well as it can be in a Stooge short.

""Three Little Pirates"" has the Stooges near execution after arriving at Dead Man's Island.

""Half-Wits Holiday"" is a remake of ""Hoi Polloi"". Two men bet on whether or not the Stooges can be introduced to high society. Sadly this would be Curly's last starring vehicle with the Stooges. This was the episode that featured Emil Sitka for the first time.

""Fright Night"" is the first short to feature Shemp. It takes place at a gym where Larry & Moe are boxing trainers. When their lives are threatened they decide to soften up their champ because they know they can't convince him to take a dive.

""oui West"" has the boys going out West to heal Shemp's bad leg. Confusion happens though when the bad guys over hear them talking about veins.

""Hold That Lion"" finds the Stooges trying to track down the man who swindled them out of their inheritance. Curly makes an uncredited cameo with no speaking part. Curly has begun to grow his hair out by this time. Everyone was hoping that Curly would recover from his illness. Everyone thought that since Curly was visiting the set they could put him in the short & that it might aid him in his recovery. It was about this time that everyone realized that Curly wouldn't be able to come back & that Shemp was going to be a permanent member of the Stooges.

""Brideless Groom"" has Shemp as a voice teacher with a female student with no talent. When it's discovered Shemp will inherit $500, 000 if he gets married by 6pm Moe & Larry do everything they can to help Shemp (and themselves).

""Sing a Song of Six Pants"" showcases the stooges as tailors. All they need to do is capture a bank robber then they can pay off the bills of which they're in arrears. Great scene with the pants press.

""All Gummed Up"" finds the boys inventing a youth potion. After giving it to the wife of their landlord she becomes young & beautiful. The landlord, who wants to take the lease away for their drugstore in order to make more money, promises them he'll let them keep it in exchange for a dose of the potion.

""Shivering Sherlocks"" has the boys as suspects in an armored car robbery.

""Pardon My Clutch"" has a quack doctor trying to cure Shemp's nerves.

""Squareheads of the Round Table"" finds our boys as troubadours in medieval times.

""Fiddlers Three"" must outwit an evil magician so that they can marry their sweethearts.

""The Hot Scots"" finds our boys wanting to become detectives. They impersonate being Scotsmen as  they investigate a haunted castle.

""Heavenly Daze"" finds Shemp going to heaven but he isn't admitted until he returns to Earth & change the ways of his two old pals, Moe & Larry.

""I'm a Monkey's Uncle"" has the Stooges in caveman times competing for two beautiful cave women & one not so beautiful.

""Mummy's Dummies"" treats us to the Stooges in ancient Egypt running a used chariot lot. Their only mistake is selling a lemon chariot to the wrong guy.

Finally we have ""Crime on Their hands"" which finds Shemp swallowing a precious diamond. Then emergency surgery is prescribed by the impatient jewel thief who's going to perform the surgery himself.

The video & audio are in excellent shape. Sony has done an excellent job of putting this in almost pristine condition. There aren't any bonus features & there aren't any subtitles either.

His comedy style has many ways to get you to laugh, whether it's his amazing facial contortions, his crazy sounds, his physical comedy, or just his ability to take a slap and see his hair fly in all different directions.  I never ever fail to laugh when watching the great Shemp at work.  I also really like Joe Besser, I can't wait for Columbia to release all the Joe Besser Stooge shorts too.  Just seeing Joe Besser can make me smile, he was a truly underappreciated comedy artist and a very fine actor too.

Not recommended to introduce anyone to the Curly years. Try volume 2 or 3 instead.

The good news, however, is that some of Shemp's best shorts are here: Brideless Groom, Squareheads of the Round Table, The Hot Scots, Heavenly Daze, Sing a Song of Six Pants-- and they have never looked better.

Curly's health is in definite decline in Vol. 5(Vol 1-4 are better Curly episodes)but to have all the episodes with Curly in them (yes he's in ""Hold that Lion"", one of Shemps first episodes in 1947) IS WHAT EVERY STOOGES FAN WOULD WANT.

3736741,5,B001OXLGKA,"So far the only thing not included in these newly remastered ""Three Stooges"" DVD sets is bonus material of any kind. As a ""Three Stooges"" fan I really hope that bonus material or some form of extras will be included in the final installments. Fortunately fans won't have to wait long for the next installment because Volume 6 from 1949-1951 From Sony Pictures is scheduled for release on June 16/2009.

""Three Stooges"" fans can breathe easier because Sony Pictures has released the fifth ""Three Stooges Collection"" volume five from 1946-1948 with the same amazing video and sound quality as found in the first four volumes. Once again fans will be happy to find that the 25 shorts in this outstanding two-disc set are in chronological order as they mark the end of Curly and the return of Shemp. In my opinion there isn't a bad short in this collection and whether you like him or not ""Shemp"" was hilarious in his own way.

With the untimely departure of Curly because of his failing health the ""Three Stooges"" had to reinvent themselves to keep their brand of slapstick comedy going and this set is proof that they were definitely up to the challenge and Moe's brother Shemp was the only choice to take over for Curly. The quality of these shorts is a testament that bigger and better things were still to come from the ""Three Stooges"" and further proof that the boys wouldn't let their fans down.

Once again Sony Pictures has done an incredible job with the video and sound remastering and they should be commended for their ongoing efforts. The digitally remastered video transfers are simply amazing; no longer do these shorts look like they were made over 60 years ago and the completely restored soundtrack is the best I've ever heard these shorts sound. Missing from these newly remastered shorts is the debris, grain, dirt and sound hissing that used to plague these wonderful shorts when they aired on television. This incredible set contains 25 shorts on two single sided discs packaged in slim cases. Once again the disc artwork and disc packaging is fantastic to say the least; making this set even more attractive and highly collectible for fans to own.

In the past Sony Studios has been famous for releasing products with inferior quality and sometimes canceling future installments for no reason leaving fans with incomplete collections. So far this has not been the case and Stooge fans will be pleased that these newly remastered shorts are being presented complete and uncut, politically incorrect and in all they're Black & White glory for fans new & old to enjoy over and over again. Hip Hip Hooray!

3736748,5,B001OXLGKA,"Classic slapstick comedy at its best.  The Three Stooges will always be remembered and never forgotten!

I grew up watching ""THE THREE STOOGES"", during a time when classic B&W shorts were shown on television and I could remember coming home every lunch time to visit my grandparents during high school and catching the series on television and just enjoying the zany adventures of Moe, Curly and Larry plus Shemp who would highlight ""THE THREE STOOGES"" during the Columbia Pictures years (1934-1959).

There were a total of 190 shorts created for Columbia Pictures and in this fifth volume of ""THE THREE STOOGES COLLECTION"", the following episodes are featured:

1946:

  1. Beer Barrel Polecats
  2. A Bird in the Head
  3. Uncivil Warbirds
  4. Three Troubledoers
  5. Monkey Businessmen
  6. Three Loan Wolves
  7. G.I. Wanna Home
  8. Rhythm and Weep
  9. Three Little Pirates

1947:

  2. Fright Night
  3. Out West
  4. Hold that Lion
  5. Bridless Groom
  6. Sing a Song of Six PAnts
  7. All Gummed Up

1948:

  2. Pardon My Clutch
  3. Squareheads of the Round Table
  4. Fiddlers Three
  5. The Hot Scots
  6. Heavenly Daze
  7. I'm a Monkey's Uncle
  8. Mummy's Dummies
  9. Crime on Their Hands

Within these three years, there are some definite classics that I was pleased to see in this collection.

A few of my favorites from this fifth volume include ""Beer Barrel Polecats"".  Moe, Curly and Larry decide to make beer during prohibition and in the process get in trouble and end up in jail.  What ensues is a hilarious episode with each men trying to find ways out of jail and each time they try to escape, they get caught and more and more years are tacked to their sentence.

In ""A Bird in the Head"", a mad scientist wants to transplant his gorilla's brain into Curly's head.  And thus a cat and mouse chase as the mad scientist and a gorilla go after the Stooges.

""Monkey Businessman"" features Moe, Curly and Larry who meet a doctor who is scamming their patients by making up illnesses or injuries thus making the patient pay more and more money.  But with Moe, Curly and Larry visiting the doctor, the three prove to be more than the doctor can handle.

In 1947's ""Half-Wits Holiday"", the episode was one of the most hilarious episodes as two doctors bet if one of them can take three morons and prepare him for upper society.  To see the three try to behave classy in front of everyone but yet making major mistakes.  As hilarious as this short film was, unfortunately this episode became the final episode to star Curly who suffered a stroke while filming.

With Curly needing to get better after his stroke, Moe asked his brother Shemp to come back to the series for the next episode titled ""Fright Night"".  The episode would mark the return of Shemp (who was an original member of the trio when the Stooges were a Vaudeville act back in the 1920's). Shemp already had a successful film career and was reluctant to join the group but knowing that his brother's depended on ""THE THREE STOOGES"" for their career, he took the job with the assumption that he would leave when Curly got better.

The return of Shemp would feature episodes that were just as hilarious as before.  Although, Curly was a hard act to replace, Shemp was just as hilarious and in ""Fright Night"", the guys help train a fighter for a boxing match while Shemp was more or less a body bag for the fighter.  But in the episode, with the mafia expecting the Stooges to make their fighter lose, this sets up a hilarious fight between the stooges and gangsters.

In the episode ""Hold that Lion"", this episode would mark the first episode to feature Moe, Larry, Shemp and Curly.  Although, Curly made a cameo in that short, Curly would never return to the ""THREE STOOGES"" as his health continued to deteriorate and would pass away less than five years later.

In ""Heavenly Daze"", Shemp who has departed returns back to Earth as an invisible angel and his job is to reform Lary and Moe.  This episode was interesting as it utilized fire effects.

And another favorite is ""I'm a Monkey's Uncle"" which features Moe getting a date with a beautiful cavewoman and sets up his brothers to date her sisters.  A wild and hilarious episode as the ex-boyfriends want their women back and thus a battle ensues between the ex-boyfriends and the new boyfriends for who will become the boyfriends of the women.

VIDEO & AUDIO QUALITY:

The re-releases of ""THE THREE STOOGES COLLECTION"" features all episodes digitally remastered and in their original release order.  In essence, the video quality is black and white and but because of it's age, it still holds up very well.  Some episodes feature mild lighting fluctuations and grain since it was on film but overall, the video quality holds up.  Video is presented in 1:33:1 full screen.

As for audio, the audio is featured in Dolby Digital Mono in English with closed captions for subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Unfortunately there are no special features included in this volume.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""THE THREE STOOGES COLLECTION"" vol. 5 continues the classic slapstick comedy that the men were known for.  The accidental hits to the faces, accidental eye poking, knocks on the head and slaps with their own audio effects plus each character's mannerisms definitely made ""THE THREE STOOGES"" quite a hilarious and fun classic.

Each episodes are short at nearly around 18 minutes long and you get 25 digitally remastered, hilarious shorts from 1946-1948 but most of all, this volume features the final ten episodes of Curly, the re-appearance of Shemp who would go on to do over 70 more shorts (15 in this volume) and of course the one and only episode featuring all four men together in the 1947 episode of ""Hold that Lion"".

For those of us who grew up within the decades that these episodes were shown on television, we were very fortunate to have the opportunity to enjoy these classics but unfortunately, unless you are looking hard for them, a lot of these classic shorts are not as easy to find (ie. ""Our Gang/Little Rascals"", ""The Three Stooges"", etc.).

I remember watching these episodes as a child through my teenager years and while watching this volume, I was watching it with my six-year-old son who was also laughing and fascinated by these ""crazy"" guys.  So, it goes to show that even though these episodes are over 60-years-old, they are still timeless and hilarious now as it was then.

Also, during these years, production for the ""THREE STOOGES"" featured the guys in various locations, various set designs and obviously had a really good budget.  This changes however in 1952, in which Columbia downsized their shorts division and thus started to reuse past footage to make episodes.  So, fortunately for this volume, you still get the quality of each episode with better stage settings and locations.

If you are a big fan of ""THE THREE STOOGES"", the fifth collection is worth owning for the final Curly episodes, the return of Shemp and that rare episode to see all four together.  Definitely a DVD volume that should definitely be in the collections of Stooges fans!",1236902400,19,7159,4.734362307067425
3736749,5,B001OXLGKA,"This is a bit more of an uneven collection than the previous four.  And, it's not because of the appearance of the vastly underrated Shemp Howard - it's Curly.  As much of a genius as Curly Howard unquestionably was, it is difficult to watch him in his final shorts.  His illness negatively colors the films and fouls up the greatest Stooge dynamic.  Curly is robbed of his manic energy, cannot stand up to Moe, and comes off as pathetic.  Seeing Moe clobber a stroke victim is not funny, it's sad.  Luckily, due to the circumstances, the comedic emphasis was placed on Moe & Larry, the latter especially proving himself as a great laugh getter now that he was given more to do.  Things pick up enormously when Shemp rejoins the Stooges.  The changes he brings are all for the good but the basic three-way dynamic does change.  First off, all three are more or less on par with each other (as opposed to some classic Curly shorts where Larry is pushed far into the background).  Second, Shemp's character is more diffident than Curly's, so there is less opposition to Moe.  However, Shemp's character is far more of a sardonic wiseacre than Curly's, so the whole act slides more into a Brooklyn wise-guy area than before.  With the surrealism Curly bought to the table gone, the tone of the act comes more down to Earth.  Some will forever miss the bizarre lunacy of the Curly years, but these Shemp efforts are consistently hilarious.  Due to shrinking budgets, the films are smaller in scope but no less funny.  However, after 1950 and the loss of some their best producers and directors (Ed Bernds & Hugh McCollum), the series does begin to suffer with remakes becoming more and more frequent.  However, the Shemp episodes featured in this collection are the best of the best!  All in all, despite it's ups and downs, a fine volume.  Did I mention that Shemp is piss-your-pants funny?",1236643200,13,1887,4.666666666666667

I have all the shorts included here on VHS and I can only applaud Sony Pictures for releasing these shorts uncut, unedited, and remastered for the first time on DVD (Bravo Sony, Bravo). As other reviewers have mentioned, even though Curly's health was declining toward the end of his career, I still enjoy watching any Stooge short with Curly or Shemp. Personally, I would've liked to have seen the pic with Moe, Larry, and Shemp looking at the train passenger (played by a retired Curly with hair!) in 'Hold that Lion' as the main cover pic, but at least they included it in one of the smaller pics off to the right hand side.

And then we move on to Shemp.  Shemp is not bad, but he is no Curly.  Theaters and even television stations have shown marathons of their material, and a common gimmick is to show ""All Curly"" episodes...because Curly is the best.
So in summary this volume is not five stars but maybe 3 1/2.  Still a worthwhile purchase as there are some gems mixed in....but not the consistent excellence of the previous volumes.",1235692800,9,645,4.47008547008547

Shemp was no Curly, but Curly was no Shemp. They were both equally amusing in their own right, and both had their plusses and minuses. The one thing that can be said for Shemp, is that the Stooges never made a short with him that wasn't funny. The same cannot be said for Curly's era....I point to the ever pointless and grossly unamusing, ""Calling All Curs""....what a waste of film...no slapping, no real stooge level violence or banter...and if you really think about it, Woman Haters wasn't all that. Every time Shemp was on a short, you knew you were gonna laugh...so enough with all the Shemp doesn't compare to Curly crap...cause it's just that.",1235606400,15,713,4.666666666666667

3736765,5,B001OXLGKA,"There was only one Curly, of course - but the vastly underrated Shemp Howard was surely the next best thing, and a class act all the way. Not many fans know that Shemp took a 50% salary cut from his successful solo career to help out his kid brother, Moe. He'd been earning twice as much for years as a busy freelance character actor, in memorable cameo bits supporting W.C. Fields, Abbott & Costello, Olsen & Johnson - and just about everyone else in Hollywood. (And frankly, having a much easier go of it. The 52 year-old Shemp was already past his prime as a knockabout comic by the time he gamely returned to the team in 1947. But game he was, luckily for us.)

 Shemp was blessed with an unforgettable, once-in-a-lifetime face that was a gift from the comedy gods. Displaying the seasoned comic instincts of a veteran clown, Shemp came equipped with a wonderful natural delivery, perfect ensemble timing, and a hilarious arsenal of quirky sounds, twitches and classic pratfalls. Out of altruism and family loyalty, he made the devil's choice - and three generations of comedy fans can be grateful for this selfless gesture.

More Shemp facts: Shemp had virtually created the Stooges' trademark style of comedy with Moe and Ted Healy in vaudeville before Curly or Larry Fine ever joined the act. Simply put (for the benefit of some uninformed reviewers), without the vitally important Shemp there never would have been any Three Stooges in the first place - which makes undermining his legacy all the more pointless. He was also an uncredited gag writer on some early Curly shorts, such as ""Pardon My Scotch,"" and in 1944 he took over for an ailing Curly during the Stooges' many live performance appearances.

Ah, but was he FUNNY?  Well, the proof is in the pudding, (or custard pie, as the case may be.) Even his HAIR was funny - and who else could get his head ""ironed"" in an industrial pants press in quite the same way? Sixty years later, and the world is still laughing. ""Heeb-eep-eep-eep-eep!""  As cartoonist/Shemp-fancier Drew Friedman said: Shemp fever....CATCH IT!",1234483200,94,2079,4.793296089385475
3736766,5,B001OXLGKA,"During this era,signs of deterioration began to show in Jerome Lester ""Curly Howard"" Horwitz. His habitual boozing led to waning health and eventually a series of strokes. Viewers could see a differently behaving Curly in the first 10 shorts in this set(his last). His high-pitched squeals had been converted to hoarse croaks and his nyuk-nyuk's became knock-knocks. BEER BARREL POLECATS features Curly,his brother Moe Howard and Larry Fine concocting their own beer and end up in jail after an unsuccessful attempt to sell it to an undercover cop! This short contains stock footage from 1941's SO LONG MR. CHUMPS and IN THE SWEET PIE AND PIE. A scientist recruits Curly's brain,since it would fit perfectly,to be transplanted into a gorilla's skull in A BIRD IN THE HEAD. The boys are living Civil War life in UNCIVIL WARBIRDS. DIXIE is the opening theme instead of the traditional THREE BLIND MICE but TBM plays over the end title card. In THREE TROUBLEDOERS,Curly is appointed sheriff and Moe and Larry are his deputies. In MONKEY BUSINESSMEN,after they lose their jobs as electricians,the boys check in at Mallard's Home & Clinic to forget their cares and learn that the joint is operated by gangsters. In THREE LOAN WOLVES,Larry babysits a woman's infant nephew(the nephew,now a grade-school boy,hears a story told by Moe). In G.I. WANNA HOME,the boys are discharged from the army and marry their girlfriends. But first,the boys create a home of their own via a fenced backyard! In RHYTHM & WEEP,after multiple evictions from various theatres,actors Moe,Larry and Curly meet three beautiful actresses in the same sad predicament. They all plan to jump off the Empire State Building. In THREE LITTLE PIRATES,the boys with a beautiful girl do all they can to take themselves off an island. In HALF-WITS HOLIDAY,Curly's last film as a Stooge,the boys are transformed into sophisticated gentlemen and are promised $1,000 if they behave themselves,which they don't,of course. The typical gooey pie fight at a party. Curly had suffered a stroke before filming ended and was forced to retire.  Exit Curly,enter his and Moe's brother Shemp as one of the Three Stooges. Columbia Pictures initially vetoed Shemp's inauguration into the team since he and Moe looked so much alike. Moe demanded to the studio's president,""Either Shemp joins or the Three Stooges are no more!"" So in came Shemp and the Stooges continued making shorts for 11 1/2 more years. In FRIGHT NIGHT,despite no connections whatsoever with Halloween,the Stooges are fight managers and are ordered by gangsters that their boxer friend's opponent gets defeated(a bet was on). In OUT WEST,the boys travel west for the sake of Shemp's unhealthy leg. In HOLD THAT LION,the boys are on a train where one of their fellow passengers is a crook who stole their uncle's will and another passenger is a sleeping(""Woob,woob,woob"") Curly(in a cameo with a full head of hair)! In BRIDELESS GROOM,Shemp tries to meet or beat a deadline for his uncle's inheritance by marrying. He succeeds after marrying one of his female voice students,a homely spinster named Dinklemeyer(first name unknown). The Pip Boys,Larry,Moe and Shemp capture a wanted criminal and use the reward money to pay back dues to save their drycleaning business in SING A SONG OF SIX PANTS. In ALL GUMMED UP,the boys as drugstore operators concoct a formula to reverse the aging process which works beautifully on their landlord's wife(she loses 50 years from her life) but works on the landlord as well except he retains his gray-white hair and beard(he promised ownership of the building to the boys if the formula met his expectations).  1948 saw two English-themed shorts,FIDDLERS THREE and SQUAREHEADS OF THE ROUND TABLE. In FT,the boys all hold possession of violins but only Larry plays since he is a violinist himself by hobby(inspired by a childhood accident). The boys are about to lose their girlfriends. They have permission from the King to marry them but not before his daughter marries. In SOTRT,the boys do everything they can to keep Cedric the Blacksmith from being killed by the Black Prince,who wants Cedric's fiancee Elaine and to kill Elaine's King father as well. The boys are restaurateurs at the Elite Cafe and their boss Gladys Harmon is kidnapped by wanted gangsters in SHIVERING SHERLOCKS. In PARDON MY CLUTCH,Shemp is ill and by recommendation goes on a camping trip. The boys travel to Glenheather Castle in Scotland to guard objects of value in HOT SCOTS. In HEAVENLY DAZE,Shemp is dead and his ghost visits Earth to haunt Moe and Larry. In the end,Shemp is alive and well,but sleeping with his mattress and derriere on fire! The boys are cavemen in I'M A MONKEY'S UNCLE. Moe's girlfriend is Aggie and Larry and Shemp hook up with Aggie's two sisters Maggie and Baggie. In MUMMY'S DUMMIES,the boys swindle the Chief of the Palace Guards by selling him a raggedy chariot which breaks down upon the Chief's exit. The boys' lives are saved when they recover stolen tax money. The King's spinster daughter finds her husband-to-be,Shemp. In CRIME ON THEIR HANDS,the janitorial Stooges try their luck as newspaper reporters after tidying a manager/editor's office. After learning of the theft of the Punjab Diamond,the fourth largest diamond in the world,Shemp,with help from a kidnapped gorilla,knocks out the crooks and recovers the stone.",1234310400,8,5383,5.095130237825595
