902551,4,630453423X,"Contrary to the English title, this movie isn't really about ghosts.  It's about monsters, including a centipede who ""studied"" for thousand of years to achive human form.  (Chinese mythology contains plenty of  stories about animals who ""study"" for almost eternety to achieve  human or some other form.
While Chinese Ghost Story II is enjoyable, I  still prefer the first movie of the Ghost Story trilogy.  This is because  the second movie has a slightly bad ending involving the fate of one of the  main characters.",961113600,,517,5.0
902552,4,630453423X,"Only a few of the sequel is better than the fist one. This movies is no lesser romance, more funnier, more actions, better special effect and Joey Wang is more beautiful (and less nudity). There are 2 more main characters  which added more color to the stories, ""the General"" who is  extremely good with the sword arts and another ghost-buster guy who is  really funny.
I saw special edition dvd which speaks madarin and  cantonese and has 8-10 languages subtitles. The dvd quality is great, I was  hoping that they will add the behide the scene features, star interview (I  am a forever fan of Leslies Chueng, since I was a teenager) to be more  fun.
If you wanna spend $37 one of the movies for one of the chinese  ghost stories, buy this one.",960940800,,745,4.466666666666667
7874883,5,630453423X,"This is for me a classic, it's somewhere between a horror B-movie and a high quality movie. I am still swept away with the imagery and the caricaturized, flamboyant and stereotypical characters. The movie breathes atmosphere, and you really get a feel of what a chinese ghost story is like, as opposed to the western ones I'm used to.",1390780800,,334,4.677966101694915
7874884,5,630453423X,"In my opinion, the best of the Chinese Ghost Story movies.  If you don't mind reading subtitles then it's not to be missed.",1375920000,,123,4.3478260869565215
7874885,4,630453423X,"this is the first film i saw of the trilogy and it remains my my favorite of the three - but not by much

the script is a laugh a minute - the action plentiful - with great atmosphere - effective dramatic moments - enjoyable mugging actors - and the alluring joey wong

no wonder ive seen all three films more than once

the flaws of the film include the primitiveness of the monsters - and - worst of all - the use of 'abrcadabra' etc for the mystical spells - but - for most viewers - the films virtues should overwhelm those flaws",1145318400,,533,4.105769230769231
7874886,4,630453423X,"This movie is fun!  I did see it originally without any subtitles, so i did hear the differences in the spells that are shouted.  I do not read nor write nor speak Chinese, however, I found that this triology is understandable and quite enjoyable without subtitles whatsoever.

Yes, it is a low budget film especially when you compare it to the horrendous budgets of Star Wars, etc.  but for all that, that is why it is SOOOO MUCH FUN!!!  it is hilarious!  The innocence of the male lead the beauty of the two female leads!  The clever intricate twists of the movie plots and characters.  The symbolic wishes to do ""good"", the wonderful play on how degenerate power religion and mindless following can be.  The wonderful type of ""godzilla"" like (from the 1960's) rubber monster!  running around!  come on folks!  it's a COMEDY!!!  It's a load of fun, a bit more disjointed than the other two movies, but, still fun.

The English subtitles!  are wonderfully funny!  I recommend trying to watch it without any subtitles at all!  then you can see how it was originally meant to be seen, and you would be surprised at how FUN you will find the movie!  Then watch it with the subtitles!  and see how ""off"" you might be on guessing the story, I bet you that won't be far off!  make up the spells in your mind!  The translator didn't know other English type of spells so stuck with Hocus-pocus etc.  but, you can make up your own.  (or read Harry Potter-if you lack the imagination!)

Rent the movie first, and then if you are like me, you'll want to own it in your collection and to share with your friends and family.  [...].  I won't tell you the plot, it is better NOT to KNOW anything, I really wish people would not put so many plot details in their reviews, this movie is refreshing!  and it's better to come upon the twists and turns without knowing what's around the bend!  SOOO....when you are discussing the movie(s) with your friends, do NOT tell them all the stuff, no details!  much more fun!",1131148800,2,1999,4.49025069637883
7874887,5,630453423X,"I don't remember why I decided to rent Chinese Ghost Story 2. It's probably because it's one of the best examples of a martial arts historical fantasy, and I use the word ""historical"" loosely.
It's hard to sum up the plot because it's a blending mishmash of several other plots. There's the reincarnated former long lost love, the bumbling tax collector, the clueless demon fighter, the grouchy monk, and a whole slew of bandits who dress up as ghosts.
But it wouldn't be called Chinese Ghost Story 2 if it was only about fake ghosts. There are real ghosts too - one is a hilarious big floppy monster with big fangs, big eyes, and big claws. The other is the main bad guy, who doesn't actually appear until the second half of the movie. And what a bad guy he is - a demon in the form of a false Buddha in the form of a giant centipede.
Get the picture yet? How about a freeze spell gone wrong, a guardian warrior who wields five katanas at once, and people flying around on swords like they were surfboards. The most hysterical part of the film is the tax collector's misuse of aforementioned freeze spell, managing to paralyze himself, the demon slayer who taught him the spell, and the ghost they're both trying to kill - so all three stand frozen for hours in a very awkward pose waiting for the spell to wear off. It's funnier than it sounds, trust me.
For all its wackiness, Chinese Ghost Story is serious stuff. Characters sacrifice themselves to save others, two sisters battle for the love of the tax collector, and the false Buddha chortles as he extols the virtues of fooling the peasantry with false deities.
In this movie, no one is who they seem and virtue ultimately rules above all. The tax collector is mistaken for a great sage. The bandit leader is mistaken for a reincarnated ghost. The demon is mistaken for Buddha. Ultimately, it is the measure of a man or woman that ultimately defines who they are, as demonstrated by the warrior who fights to the death to defend the honor of those he wronged.
Unfortunately, the subtitles of Chinese Ghost Story suffers from a lazy and inept translation. The spell chants are never translated beyond ""Abracadabra, hocus pocus!"" and some of the spellings are simply incorrect. Still, it wasn't so awful that it impaired my enjoyment of the film.
If Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon piqued your interest, this movie is the next step into Wuxia cinema.",1079913600,10,2405,4.608391608391608
7874888,4,630453423X,this is the weakest out of the a chinese ghost story trilogy but it is still a good show. the story has little connection the previous 2 movies. This time the costumes get more colorful and the people and monsters get more powerful. go get it.,1027728000,,243,4.304347826086956
7874889,2,630453423X,"With much lower production values and a storyline that is recycled at best, and boring at its worst, I would definately stay clear of this one.
Part one is gorgeous, with bright colors and fun action with a plot that entertains and intrigues. This one is like watching a saturday morning cartoon from the 80s, filled with floppy jokes and bad acting.
90 minutes of my life I'll never get to have back...",1011312000,2,403,4.534246575342466
7874890,2,630453423X,"A big fan of both Leslie Cheung and Joey Wong, I was disappointed with the Sequel when compared to the original - The original remains a classic, while the Sequel feels like it was hastily put together to ride the success of the original.  What I really didn't like about the movie was the very fake looking ghost/monster...whatever you prefer to call it - okay, even though this was back in the 80s, but I am sure they could have come up with better stuff than that.  Leslie revives the role of the helpless scholar/tax collector who is neither a martial arts expert nor a monk who can rid evil to the tee, Joey plays a new character who resembles the original 'ghost', Jacky Cheung is definitely a great addition to the movie but the plot definitely lacks the momentum of the original movie. Some great comical moments.",987811200,4,821,4.54054054054054
7874891,5,630453423X,"I am a huge fan of the Qian N Yiou Hun (Chinese Ghost Story) series, and I have all three of the movies on DVD.  This one is without a doubt my favourite of the 3.  The atmosphere set by this film is superb and unmatched.  Some of the biting yet subtle criticisms on the corruption of buearacracy might be missed on Western viewers, but nevertheless this is the quintisential Chinese Swordman-Taoist monk (Wu Xia/Dao shi) movie.",971481600,3,428,4.532467532467533
7874892,5,630453423X,"Tsui Hark is both a magician in creating atmosphere and mood and also a superbeing in creating something not seen in everyday life. He has captured the gist of the world of surreal, and also he has created a world that is  beyond humans. Worked with Hollywood special effects master, Nick Allder,  Tsui creates a mythical sequence of men fighting beast in a surreal world.  Juxtaposed with the world of real and surreal, Tsui has created a love  story that co-exists in both worlds, and  its beauty is beyond words. Tsui  Hark is at best when he comes to science fiction: fighting in a castle with  poisoned butterflies, love between man and ghost, and also all the  imagination that you can have about the Oriental myths. He has studied  films in Texas University, USA, and he is the only MAN who bridges the  western technologies and recreates the mythologies of the EAST for the  world audiences to enjoy.",962150400,,908,4.6835443037974684
