6656793,5,B00NHG1D96,"I saw this on PBS and had to Buy a copy. A great history of Bing's career and personal life. Oddly, there are a few F bombs in the film, one from Bing himself, during a recording session and another from his daughter Mary, when describing how angry she was with half brother Gary when he admitted to her that he had exaggerated stories of abuse in this book. I wanted to mention this because I felt the language was unnecessary and a little shocking, but if you are prepared for these 2 instances perhaps you will not mind. It really is an excellent production full of interviews of co workers, family and Bing himself.",1419811200,2,619,4.391304347826087
6656794,4,B00NHG1D96,"This PBS AMERICAN MASTERS documentary originally aired on December 2, 2014, and was simultaneously released on DVD. It is an excellent documentary on the life of Harry Lillis ""Bing"" Crosby, who was one of the greatest entertainers of his time. Only Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Michael Jackson have come close to Crosby in popularity and influence.

The DVD has plenty of performance clips from Crosby's movies, radio appearances, and television specials, but is also quite candid about his troubled private life. His first wife, singer-actress Dixie Lee, a long-time alcoholic, died of cancer in 1952. His four sons from that marriage are all deceased; Lindsay and Dennis committed suicide in 1989 and 1991, respectively, while Gary (author of a very controversial memoir,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Going-My-Own-Way/dp/0385170556/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Going My Own Way</a>) and Phillip (Dennis' twin) died of natural causes, in 1995 and 2004, respectively. Crosby's widow, Kathryn Grant, who he married in 1957, and their three children, Harry, Nathaniel, and Mary (Frances), who got her 15 minutes of fame in 1980 when her character, Kristin Shepard, shot J.R. Ewing (the late Larry Hagman) on DALLAS, appear throughout the documentary, along with Crosby friends Tony Bennett, Michael Feinstein, biographer Gary Giddins, record producer Ken Barnes, and the writers of Bing's last TV special,  Buz Kohan and Larry Grossman, who reveal that David Bowie, who only agreed to do the special because his mother was a huge Crosby fan, refused to sing ""The Little Drummer Boy"" with Bing (Bowie hated the song) and almost left the show, but Kohan and Grossman persuaded Bowie to stay by writing the ""Peace On Earth"" countermelody for him.

Not much in the way of bonus features, except for a performance of The Crosby Boys (Bing took son Gary's place after he was fired from the group) singing ""Joshua Fit The Battle Of Jericho""; an interview with director Robert Trachtenberg, and a few interview outtakes.

A four-star documentary that Crosby fans and newbies will enjoy, but it does contain some strong language, including a couple of F-bombs (bleeped out during the repeat PBS broadcast, which I watched on WETA on December 26, 2014).",1419552000,8,2288,5.454802259887006

Bing Crosby - Rediscovered

On Tuesday evening PBS's American Masters series aired this well-researched, two-hour documentary about the life and career of the most influential (and successful) singer of the twentieth century. Bing Crosby changed everything. And yet today, thirty-seven years after his passing, my generation, now in our mid-fifties, remembers him merely as the nice old man who came into our living rooms every December to serenade our families with White Christmas. Der Bingle was so much more than that. Artie Shaw once described him as ""the first hip white guy in history"". Agreed; but that doesn't even come close to explaining the magic that was Bing.

He is a historical figure and deserves to be recognized as such. He was also one of the best comic actors who ever lived. Did I mention that? Bing Crosby is in danger of being forgotten. That shouldn't be the case.

6656799,5,B00NHG1D96,"On Tuesday, December 2, 2014 PBS aired this 90 minute documentary on Singer/Actor Bing Crosby as part of the ""American Masters"" series. PBS Home Video is releasing it the same day on DVD with a few bonus features.

Based on seeing and advance screener of the documentary - provided to me by PBS - I can highly recommend both the show and the DVD (especially to those who collect Croby records from the 1930s and 1940s. But I also want you to be aware that the version which will air on PBS will probably be edited for strong language. How they will edit it should be interesting since they can bleep certain words but others appear on the screen. More on that in a minute.

Crosby's Centenary was actually in 2003 so the folks behind this project as well as Universal Music, which is releasing a ""companion CD"" to the documentary (see my review posted last week for details) and 12 other albums for the occasion, are a bit behind. But at least it's happening. Here is a man who was an Oscar Winning actor, a singer on both records and his regular radio show, a television star and the guy who had more ""number 1"" hit records than anyone since Edison invented the phonograph, and yet most folks under 50 years old only know him from singing ""The Little Drummer Boy"" in counter harmony with David Bowie singing ""Peace on Earth"". This documentary - if a younger audience can enticed to watch it - will show them that, in addition to the other talents I mentioned, Crosby was the first person to pre-record a radio show (which led to advances in tape recorders).  (By the way, I won't spoil the surprise but the story revealed here about that Crosby/Bowie duet is fascinating.

Director Robert Tractenberg - whose previous American Masters credits include bios of Mel Brooks, Cary Grant and Gene Kelly, had the full cooperation of the Kelly estate (managed by Crosby's second wife Kathryn and so we get to see lots of rare, previously unseen footage. The narrator is Stanley Tucci but Tractenberg went to the best sources for his interviews. Gary Giddens, one of my favorite music journalists  (and author of the Crosby bio on his early years) has a lot of screen time, as does entertainer Michael Feinstein.  Writers Buz Kohan and Larry Grossman are here two. Crosby had two wives and two sets of children.  Kathryn, as well as daughter Mary and sons Harry and Nathaniel tell honest stories about the man America loved but who rarely, if ever, sang about that word.  A 1996 interview with son Gary - from Crosby's first marriage to Dixie Lee - focuses on his dad as being strict (an understatement).

One thing that I found annoying was that - for the contemporary reviews with Giddens and Feinstein - they are places behind a table and interview in dim light which makes the view strain their eyes. But that's the ""blip"" in the quality of the show.

Now to the issue of strong language. About 20 minutes into the film come the discussion about a 1935 recording session for Decca Records of Bing with the Dorsey Bros.. Bing had been drinking and was arguing with Jack Kapp about the arrangement for the last song in the session. The argument was on-going within the recording studio, and Jack Kapp had a recording engineer record the argument. During this argument the F-word is used. I'm pretty sure that on the PBS airing they will ""bleep"" the word but, because the Director wants the audience to clearly know what is being said, the full text of the comments is shown on the screen as the recording of it plays. At the approximately 56-minute mark, Crosby's daughter Mary utters that same word. And a bit later Giddens uses the S-word. I'm guessing they will be either bleeped - or edited - for the TV version. I only make you aware of this because you may be showing this to young children.

The DVD contains two bonus features. First is an interview with the Director which runs 3:24. Next is a group of nine interview segment (with Giddens, Feinstein and Mary Crosby) which add some additional insight to the film (especially Crosby's view on smoking and how he was fired from MGM in 1932 for writing an offensive lyric) plus the video performance of Crosby with three of his sons performing ""Joshua Fit The Battle"" on TV. (The audio of this performance is on the companion CD. This second group adds another 14 minutes of material to the package.

So, as I said earlier, I do recommend this film to all Crosby fans as well as anyone interest in an entertainment icon whose career spanned over five decades.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

When he died in october 1977,BING was the guy who used to sing in those CHRISTMAS specials. People from my generation didn't know about BING's career and as i look back at those years,i think it was a shame. BING you will find out watching this is easily the 30's and 40's most popular AMERICAN singer. No one before or after him covered so much ground in AMERICAN culture. So BING was a drinker early in his career and he failed his first marriage and had a hard time with his kids. When you think of it,this theory some people have that entertainers should be perfect is ridiculous. Entertainers like everybody have ups and downs in their life.

I had almost forgotten how good Bing Crosby was.
It's also available as part of a specially-priced 24 Movie Box Set of Bing Crosby musicals on 13 DVDs.
All were filmed by Paramount between 1933 and 1949:

One catch: The version of ""American Masters: Bing Crosby Rediscovered"" included in the 13 DVD boxed set, though complete and unabridged, does not have English subtitles - even though the box says it does.
[but all 24 complete movies in that 13 DVD box do have subtitles.]

This single disc version of ""American Masters: Bing Crosby Rediscovered"" does have subtitles.

The 13 DVD box currently sells for about $80 on Amazon.
Minus $15 for the single DVD of ""Bing Crosby Rediscovered"" works out to $65 for 24 Bing Crosby musicals on 12 DVDS.
