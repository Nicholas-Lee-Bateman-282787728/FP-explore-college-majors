4209149,3,B003VE9WWO,This was purchased on recommendation from a friend.  Sorry to report the acting is stiff and the dialogue is stilted.  The movie comes across like a recruiting film for the Southern Baptist church.,1406505600,,197,4.9393939393939394
4209150,5,B003VE9WWO,Great movie on how a 'village' can transform a life both negatively and positively. This movie will 'touch' your heart.,1379894400,,119,5.0
4209151,5,B003VE9WWO,"Excellent movie about healing, deliverance, and redemption.  The movie is well done and would touch the hearts of many how are dealing with abuse issues.",1363046400,,153,5.12
4209152,5,B003VE9WWO,"As a Church leader, I believe this movie 'The Touch' is very powerful and gives great insight and understanding into the issues of sexual abuse and the lifetime trauma it can cause. It also demonstrated the power of what can happen when Christians come together with a common goal to reach out and minister to the hurting. I understand this movie is a true story and I applaud First Baptist Church of Leesburg, VA. for the amazing work which they are doing to help change the lives of so many, and to help them find hope and faith in Jesus Christ.

If you want a movie that is relevant to the world we live in and the social issues of our day, then I truly recommend this difficult yet heart warming presentation that challenges us to get out of our comfort zone and make a difference.",1357171200,,785,4.376712328767123
4209153,5,B003VE9WWO,"Watched this with a group of people  everyone loved this film in the group. Its great film for small groups , the basic premise is that we are all one step away from losing it all , and just bone prayer from getting it all back  . wonderful film,  great for the whole family  . Would  suggest to any one who has real life situations going on .",1347148800,,343,3.985294117647059
4209154,3,B003VE9WWO,Nice story but didn't share it with youth group as I was affraid it would be a little dull for them.,1328140800,,100,3.8095238095238093
4209155,1,B003VE9WWO,"Terrible terrible acting...to the point that you can't even follow the storyline it's so distracting. Bad writing, bad dialogue. Typical ""Christian"" movie.  Wish Christians could just focus on making good art instead of trying to christianize everything to the point that it sucks.",1322179200,,281,5.534883720930233
4209156,5,B003VE9WWO,I love faith based films I have collected maybe 3 dozen over the years  .This particular film has just made my top 3 Fireproof and the Last Adam  ( Are my top two). And this film touches my heart in a unique and interesting way. One because it's a true story. And the second reason because of the unrelenting sprit of Gods people who try to do his work here on earth. The story is about a young and beautiful woman named Hanna who loses it all and finds herself homeless. And instead of doing the obvious thing to make money. She makes positive choice and one after another things turn around for her but not in her time but IN GODS time but her journey has also residue effects on other people which make it such a great story great story very moving well done Faithwerks,1300147200,2,772,4.244897959183674
4209157,5,B003VE9WWO,Awesome message! The story  will touch your heart.,1517961600,,50,5.25
4209158,5,B003VE9WWO,"The Message/Christ is integral to whole movie. Her story is so relatatable to/similar to the experiences many of woman go through, in/outside the church. And the usual downward spiral that damage creates I have found as a survivor myself and a woman of God, stigmatizes you in many churches, at least I know that's been true for me. And I've met many survivors who have turned away from church altogether, some even completely away from their Faith, and state it's because they have had so many bad experiences at church. It'd be a shame if Satan used Christians to keep more people out of church than bars, drugs, night clubs wouldn't it? I wonder sometimes how often that happens. I know if I speak I am a woman of God, then I know I gotta rep the Holy Brand, so to say.
And I'm so glad this movie included that issue. The Church changed for the better. Heard a preacher say miracles usually don't come in 1's.
Gives thanks and Praise to the most High God, Our Father God. Praise you Jesus. Holy Spirit thank you...guide my hands my feet my eyes my actions thoughts walk with me talk with me heal me...intercede when there are no words.
In Jesus' Holy Name Amen.
God Bless :)

4209159,5,B003VE9WWO,Great Movie and food for thought. Very much appreciated the efforts of the cast.,1517875200,,80,4.785714285714286
4209160,5,B003VE9WWO,"I cried thru most of this, and  as a believer, I liked it,  it is  not cheesy.  - it is a older film,... it has soo much truth to it.  . todays movies are just evil and despicable,  all the flashing going on and the speed of what is shown  practically gives one a seizure !  ..  I like the old style , laid back and not being stressed out, able to comprehend  what is being watched - unlike this new style Hollywood does it today .  GREAT MESSAGE !",1515196800,3,448,3.8666666666666667
4209161,1,B003VE9WWO,Beautiful story about true Lesbian love!,1507161600,,40,5.833333333333333
4209162,5,B003VE9WWO,"Really quick and in a nutshell if you don't like movies that talk about Christ don't watch this. You won't get it if you refuse to hear the parts about Christ. If you take God out of this movie it is trash.
If however you can understand love, God's love (not this watered down self serving stuff we get hung up on so much), then this movie might work for you.
It is a tough pill to swallow though and not for just the light hearted viewing. It deals with hard issues like drugs and sex, and poverty. It your a bit TOUCHY around those subjects you might want to view with kid gloves. If you let it though this movie can lead to a change in your life.
Movie summery, girl is sexually abused from childhood. She bottles everything up or drinks it down. This just makes her circle the drain till she ends up in jail. Now she has to slog though all this muck of her past to have any hope of giving herself a tomorrow. Think I gave away spoilers? Nope you get all that in the first few sance of the movie. Hang on it gets real good from there!",1499731200,,1037,4.0634146341463415
4209163,5,B003VE9WWO,Great movie. This was played on church movie night.,1431993600,,51,4.777777777777778
4209164,5,B003VE9WWO,This movie inspired me to start Standing Stone Community Center.  I would recommend it to everyone!,1428710400,,99,5.1875

8406760,5,B003VE9WWO,"A helpful hand in times of trouble can turn lives around. So happened to Hannah, who was sexually abused since childhood, and was helped when she needed it the most. This movie is inspired by a true story and sets an example of humanity and love in action.",1528588800,,256,4.354166666666667
8406761,5,B003VE9WWO,"I am not Baptist and don't believe in once saved always saved. They didn't have this message. In fact it felt more political with voting on who to save and who not to save. And worrying about losing congregation over saving folks from tough backgrounds bothered me. It felt more like a charity then a Christian based story (as it's based on a true story). Many great churches help folks and don't go advertising it in a movie. They did a great thing but I felt God was replaced by voting decans not what the word of God says. I still give it 5 stars as I believe as Christians we should help the helpless without the praise and advertising that we do so. The reward come from your soul and will be given on judgement day. I'm happy to hear they have this girl 3 chances but did they do that only with one person. To many do judge tattooed, pierced, crazy lifestyles folks had lead and drive them away. Jesus would have forgiven them if they asked and embraced them with open arms. Not asked a disciple should we vote on forgiveness.",1526860800,,1032,4.324742268041237
8406762,5,B003VE9WWO,Very good movie. The road to Redemption. Every believer should watch.,1524096000,,69,5.363636363636363
8406763,5,B003VE9WWO,So very glad to know that churches are reaching out to help the community instead of building on to there church.,1524009600,,113,4.428571428571429
8406764,3,B003VE9WWO,"The story was great but the acting needs help. The dialogue felt entirely scripted and it was way too cheesy in several spots. Overall great story, powerful. I really want to give it 4 stars but the acting hurt.",1522022400,,211,4.435897435897436
8406765,4,B003VE9WWO,"wonderful story, but be prepared for a lot of crying",1520726400,,52,4.3
8406766,5,B003VE9WWO,"she was arrested because HER BOYFRIEND had cocaine. An all too typical scenario. This movie shows several instances of how women are unfairly treated and abused as kids or adults, one way or another, til they  end up on the street homeless; and without resources to even get to work or keep a job. It's really heartening to see this true story of a real church living out the obligations of being authentic christians, to give shelter and support to these severely disadvantaged women and others in need.
And yes i also had tears in my eyes and could really feel for the main character because she so reminds me of someone i know whose life is almost a parallel, a beauty suffering so much abuse and homelessness.",1520121600,,713,4.5703125
