7948146,1,B00005NVWZ,I bought this film for 2 bucks and instantly felt ripped off after 5 minutes. Terrible terrible production that is low budget even by porno standards. Just avoid at all costs.,1319414400,,175,4.67741935483871
7948147,1,B00005NVWZ,"I certainly appreciate Tom Savini's skill as a makeup and effects guru, and he's even proven that he can do an ok job with acting as long as it's in a limited role as in ""From Dusk Til Dawn"".  But at the same time, Savini seems to be a guy who never saw a script...or perhaps a paycheck...that he didn't like.  I'm not sure which movie is worse...this one or ""Zombiegeddon"" but both are putrid beyond all belief.  Maybe he was doing a favor for someone, I don't know.  The plot concerns some stupidity about a couple of two-bit crooks who owe the mob some money (with Savini as a hit man) and Scream Queen Brinke Stevens as a demoness who transforms into one of the stupidest looking creatures scene on film since the 1950's.  Look I know Stevens is a famous ""B"" movie actress and that's fine.  But she can't carry a picture and while she still looks good the fact is that she's now over 50 years old and playing parts designed for much younger women.  Move over Brinke...terrible movie!",1145404800,5,987,4.3901098901098905
7948148,1,B00005NVWZ,"If you're looking for a horror film, quick!! run away from this movie. The description may talk about demons but all we see that's horrific in this film, and I use the term loosely, is a demon that looks more like a gorilla covered in feathers. It's always surrounded by fog which is probably a technique used to hide the cheap f/x. The acting in this movie is ridiculously awful. Even Tom Savini, who I found was not half-bad in From Dusk 'Til Dawn, does not come across very well in this movie. Brinke Stevens: suffice to say that she's no actress, she's just there to flash her body.

Now if you're looking for a movie that shows badly made cheap sex ( you really don't see that much), well you might(???) like this movie. As far as the added Demon Familiars is concerned, it is just another excuse for cheap sex. The girls act very poorly, and don't look all that sexy. If you want films of that kind, I'm sure there's thousands of better films than this one.

When I got this film, I didn't expect an award-winner but I did expect a horror film that would probably include some nude scenes. All I ended up getting was a cheap, trashy, poorly acted film that tried but failed to include horror.

I would give this film a 0 rating but the lowest available rating is 1.",1090800000,7,1271,4.331932773109243
