4081322,4,B0037FFB9A,"Incredible that someone reviewing this DVD would trash-talk it because it involves George W. Bush.  He was the president who wanted to take us back to the Moon and then beyond.  How different from the current administration which cancelled the Constellation program--thereby flushing 9 billion dollars down the toilet--and putting many skilled engineers out of work.  Oh yeah--and then he cut back NASA's budget to destroy plans for additional unmanned Mars missions.  Makes Bush look pretty good, I'd say.
Oh yeah--and the current occupant of the White House also wants to send people to an asteroid in 2025--if only he can figure out a way to get them there and what the heck they will do when they get there.
Great DVD that shows what might have been, without people with the brains of a Twinkie running the space program.",1329609600,4,825,4.871428571428571
4081323,5,B0037FFB9A,Very good. I am very interested in space travels and I really liked  very much. And is good to rear capitain Kirk voice again.,1304812800,,126,4.25
4081324,4,B0037FFB9A,"This doc gives a very good overview of the steps we would need to make a manned trip to Mars. I am not sure why George Bush's name is given such prominence on the website, because he is barely in the movie, and it's about science, not politics. So do not let that turn you off. William Shatner makes a suprisingly good, low key commentator. Has good special effects. I saw the DVD, not the Blue-Ray.",1286409600,5,399,4.2631578947368425
4081325,5,B0037FFB9A,"A spectacular summary of future plans for Mars exploration and colonization. I hope all will see this. You should buy the DVD and watch it when it dosen't interfere with other TV shows on commercial TV.
It is worth it!",1284422400,7,218,4.475
8390541,5,B0037FFB9A,Product as advertised.  Fast delivery.  Thanks!,1506297600,,47,6.666666666666667
8390542,4,B0037FFB9A,"I think it was very well presented, and addressed the problems in ways for the non-science person to grasp it more easily.",1472342400,,122,4.590909090909091
8390543,5,B0037FFB9A,"Six episodes stretched over two discs this examines all the possible problems that could occur in man's effort to get to the 4th planet from the Sun. major issues include human health which goes down hill without gravity so artificial gravity would have to be created!  Additionally are concerns about ailments from Sun flares impact upon astronauts.

Additional issues include tech to get there. quite a difficult venture to take. Insightful",1471737600,,442,5.211267605633803
8390544,5,B0037FFB9A,"While somewhat dated at this point, I found this the best production I've seen about the challenges of a Mars mission.  This series uses CGI combined with interviews, film excerpts and historical footage to illustrate all the problems we would encounter launching, traveling to, landing and returning from such a mission.  These are presented without over dramatization in a sober, professional way, backed by a low key, serious narration by William Shatner. Each of  these six episodes  focuses mainly on one problem and the various solutions being considered by both the American & Russian scientists.  Everything from cosmic rays, weightlessness and psychological issues are given thorough treatment.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone seriously interested in what is required of a manned Mars mission.",1440460800,4,815,5.428571428571429

8390547,3,B0037FFB9A,"when I first saw this series, it was very interesting and still is today,especially with William Shatner doing the voice over.its just a shame that they couldn't use some of that money to stop poverty and hunger here on EARTH.",1382486400,,226,4.675
8390548,2,B0037FFB9A,"I'm a major fan of space exploration videos - From the Earth to the Moon, When We Left Earth, Moon Machines, Surviving Mars, For All Mankind, Space Station, I think I have them all.  This is the shallowest one I've seen, with lowest-common-denominator killer stats like ""the spacecraft built in orbit would be the size and weight of four city buses"" and a fair amount of duplication of material across episodes.  Maybe it's targeted at a much less sophisticated audience, but I lost interest partway through episode 2.  So far no mention at all of Robert Zubrin's controversial (but widely known) plans for lighterweight Mars missions.  Disappointed; wanted to like it.",1375228800,2,669,5.0
8390549,5,B0037FFB9A,"I have many space-related documentary type dvds and ordered this one expecting a somewhat shallow, perhaps grade school overview of considerations for a mission to Mars.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find a very intelligently written and presented overview of both the technical and human aspects, with exceptional graphics.  I was impressed... and motivated.  A high quality production overall.  Perhaps most interesting to me (& my wife) were the many practical human considerations of lengthy space flight (personalities, sex, boredom, fatigue, friction, health, etc.).  Those two segments alone (an hour and a half out of over 5 hours) were worth the purchase price.  As a child, I had once thought I'd take a one-way trip to Mars if offered because of the very exciting concept of exploring such an interesting planet.  Now I'm not sure that I'd even consider a round trip - extreme dangers (of every imaginable sort), prolonged physical discomfort and a possible loss of one's sanity, to name a few considerations.  The reality of today's space exploration is a long, long way from William Shatner's Star Trek.  It's conastoga wagon compared to a 757 to cross the continent.  Shatner does a fine job of narration, by the way.  Bottom line - very informative and entertaining.  And, exploring Mars is far more motivating than a similar effort to an asteroid, in my opinion.",1365638400,6,1384,5.075221238938053
8390550,5,B0037FFB9A,"This documentary makes you fell like a mission to Mars would begin at any time from now! Very accurate, explains the pros and cons of every available technology. In a nutshell, is a must have for all air & space fans.",1334620800,3,217,4.317073170731708
