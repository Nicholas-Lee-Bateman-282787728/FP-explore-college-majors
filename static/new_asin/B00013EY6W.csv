1968677,5,B00013EY6W,"THIS IS A WONDERFUL, IN DEPTH DISCUSSION OF THE RECONSTRUCTION ERA IN THE UNITED STATES.  IT IS A MUST SEE FILM FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO UNDERSTAND THE RECONSTRUCTION ERA AFTER THE CIVIL WAR.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT AS A HISTORIAN.",1257552000,4,229,4.560975609756097
1968678,4,B00013EY6W,"Back in the days of my personal `pre-history' the Reconstruction period directly after the American Civil War ended in 1865 was cast as the time of the scalawags, carpetbaggers, Black Codes and ultimately after a determined fight by the `right' people in the South `redemption'. In short a time of shame in the American experience and, at least implicitly, a racist slap at blacks and their supporters. Well so much for that nonsense.

There certainly was plenty that went wrong during radical reconstruction in the South but the conventional high school history textbooks never got into the whole story. Nor did they want to. The whole story is that until fairly recently this radical reconstruction period was the most democratic period in the South in American history, for white and black alike. Previously, I have written some book reviews on this subject that led me to this documentary. This documentary goes a long way toward a better visual understanding of what went on in that period.

The first part of the Radical Reconstruction era was dominated by three basic plans that are described here in some detail; the aborted Lincoln `soft' union indivisible efforts; the Johnson `soft' redemption plans; and, the radical Republican `scorched earth' policy toward the South. In the end none of these plans was pursued strongly enough to insure that enhanced black rights gained through legislation would lead to enlightened citizenship. The documentary presents detailed critiques of all these plans and some insights about the social and cultural mores of the country at the time that do not make for a pretty picture.

The producers spend some time trying to demystify what the radical reconstruction governments did and did not do. This is done in the usual `even-handed' approach of PBS documentaries by the use of various individual life stories-a former slave, ex-Yankee officer and a woman plantation owner. That there were scandalous activities and more than enough corrupt politicians to go around goes without saying. However like most myths there is a snowball effect about how bad things really were that obliterates the very real advances for black (and some poor whites) like public education, improved roads and increased state facilities that were anathema to the planting class that formerly ruled the South.

The second part of the documentary deals with the conservative counter-revolution in order to overthrow the radical governments culminating in the well-known Compromise of 1877. The actions of that Southern rabble, rich and poor whites alike, formed in militias and other para-military operations like the Klan is certainly not pretty. Moreover it took about a century and a `cold' civil war during the 1960's to even minimally right that situation (a battle that continues to this day). For those that need an in depth, definitive study of this subject you must turn to the master Eric Foner (who is also one of the `talking heads', another PBS standard practice, on screen) and his monumental Reconstruction, 1863-1877. However, if you want a shorter but nevertheless informative visual overview of Reconstruction this is your first stop.",1207180800,19,3174,5.205479452054795
1968679,5,B00013EY6W,"I watched and then had my adult son watch this DVD. We consider ourselves relatively well read in American history and yet this presentation taught us a great deal of incontrovertible fact about a part of American history that is woefully under-treated in American schools and colleges. I was amazed and saddened to learn about this disgraceful period, and to consider how few Americans understand what happened. To the right wing bigots who are criticizing this documentary I can only say: if only ten percent of this history is true, it would still be teaching us an important lesson: we are even more racist historically than we have been taught, and ought to be even more ashamed of what our ancestors did to people of color. It will be a long, long time before I stop considering what this fine documentary says about us.",1195689600,9,826,4.743055555555555
1968680,4,B00013EY6W,This was a pretty good DVD. I don't like the title. The war and reconstruction were anything but civil. It was a war and reconstruction designed to rape the South and put the northern views into the South. It still happens today. This DVD tells some of the atrocities that took place during that time.,1168473600,5,301,4.490909090909091
1968681,1,B00013EY6W,"And an apology for the single most corrupt period of our entire history. The Constitution was emasculated between 1861 and 1877 and remains a shadow of itself even today. Lincoln's assasination was the beginning of the end for the South? Any ""scholar"" still enraptured by that myth has been skipping their medication. Lincoln was the despot who let the genie out of the bottle in the first place. There was not a single one of of the 10 Amendments that he did not break. This is just more cultural marxist, revisionist spin. Enough, please.",1148774400,29,540,4.75531914893617
1968682,2,B00013EY6W,"I will attempt to take a scholar's dispassionate view to critique this documentary.  However, with the time invested, and the fact that it is available to watch for FREE over the Internet, it demands a close scrutiny.

First, one would hope that by 2004 such clear propaganda would be blatantaly suspect. The method used by Burns, at first captivating in the 1989 ""The Civil War"" weeklong docudrama, has become shopworn.  This method takes as ""representative"" the experiences and views of VERY few individuals--such as Vermonter Union Captian Twitchell, who attains a Freedman's Bureau commission to govern Bienville Pariesh in Northwest Louisiana, and that of Kay Stone, who returns from refuge in Texas to find her family plantation in ruins.  The ""stories"" of newly freed slaves who become politicians, and the tumultuous period of time running from Sherman's infamous Field Order 15 to the narrow vote on impeachment of Andrew Johnson, setting the stage for the election of U.S. Grant, Federal quelling of the riots accompanying the Constitutional Convention of Louisiana in New Orleans....are just that--stories--and dare anyone say ""representative"" of anything?

Today the Congress faces possible spending of up to $500,000 per capita to ""rebuild"" New Orleans after hurricane Katrina.  The economic depression of the 1870s is blamed for the ""abandonment"" of Radical Reconstruction--which amounted to a continued War of Northern Oppression on Southern Society--dare one say to the ignorance of social stratification resulting from immigration to the large cities of the Northeast?

This PBS documentary, funded by major corporations, is nothing short of an abomination.  It uses Burns' ""entertaining"" documentary method to do nothing short of incite further racism of which this country is surely weary.  You cannot have a meritocracy at the same time as modern politicians, deeply rooted in slaveocracy as a raison d'etre, propose ""reparations"" for deeds done long ago.

Innuendo is not documentary scholarship.  A case in point--the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, where veterans of the Blue and Gray, just as at the 75th anniversary, at which FDR spoke, presumably were all white.  What is the basis for the innuendo?  I don't know.  However, Stephen D. Lee's 1896 admonition to the United Confederate Veterans, which became the Sons of Confederate Veteran's, to remember the values and sacrifices of one's ancestors, is not racist and many free blacks fought in the Confederate Army by choice, as did the Cherokee Nation.  It is well established that memory is selective and this documentary does no more than establish that selective memory in the form of ""scholarship"" or ""documentary"" work at least foments misperception and at worst possibly violence, if only in the distorted imagination.

I would recommend that the reader spend time with Dinesh D'Sousa's ""What's So Great About America""  for INSPRIATION rather than spend 3 hours mired in a distorted account of ""Reconstruction"" and perpetuation of racist myths.  Another excellent read is ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History"" by Thomans E. Woods, Jr., Ph. D.  It is probably NOT accidental that a portrait of a Confederate General graces the cover of the dustjacket of this book.  Many Southerners are of the opinion that the War of Northern Aggression was also a second war of Independence from rule by a foreign power--which Mr. Lincoln put under Marshal Law and suspended the Writ of Habeas Corpus.  The ""Civil War"" lasted at least twenty years--not four, and truly representative government still hangs in the balance.  Would anyone reasonably assert that the ""American Experiment"" is concluded?

Postscript:  I find it altogether predictable that this ""documentary"" would produce some controversy.  The manner in which the Civil War and Reconstruction are presented to the public is a matter of considerable significance, even in 2006.  I think that all reviewers would agree on this.  Scanning my other reviews to attempt to create some ""political profile"" by which an ad hominem attack can be launched is somewhat disingenuous, however.  The bias evident in this film can be gleaned easily from the sources mentioned in my review, which are not political works per se.  They are historical.  The line between propaganda and history, thankfully, can be more clearly delineated now than during the reign of the master propagandist, Dr. Goebbels.",1128729600,37,4448,5.330945558739255
1968683,4,B00013EY6W,"If there is a villain behind the curtain of the tragic story of Reconstruction, then that would have to be John Wilkes Booth. ""Reconstruction: The Second Civil War"" basically begins with Lincoln's assassination, but the harm that Booth unleashed on the South by removing the compassionate Lincoln from the political stage and empowering the Radical Republicans in Congress to appease their demands for Southern subjugation is a profound irony. Still, if there is a clear lesson from this ""American Experience"" documentary, it is that the South might have lost the Civil War but they managed to win Reconstruction.

This two-part PBS documentary covers the momentous years 1863 to 1877. Part I, ""Revolution"" produced and directed by Llewellyn M. Smith, begins with Lincoln's warning that Reconstruction would be ""fraught with great difficulty,"" and ends in 1867 when Congress passed the Radical Republican's Reconstruction plan that divided the former Confederacy into five military districts, each commanded by a General with power to enforce law and administer justice. New southern governments would be created but were required to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment and allow black men the right to vote, which saw former slaves running and be elected to public office. Part II, ""Retreat,"" produced and directed by Elizabeth Deane shows how the Democrats slowly but surely took power back in the Southern states and achieved ""redemption"" for white Southerners. A compelling case is made for the acquiescence of Northerners with the concern of Southern whites for keeping the blacks subordinate, and one of the more interesting episodes concerns the White League, which went after carpetbaggers the way the Ku Klux Klan was going after freedmen (I am surprised I had never heard of the Coushatta massacre before this). When President Grant sends federal troops to take the Louisiana legislature back from a takeover by the White League, it is an intervention that apparently offends Northerners as much as it did Southerners (but an armed mob taking over a state legislature is apparently okay). By the time you get to the end of this documentary you are convinced that the Civil War was a tragedy, but Reconstruction was a farce.

While this documentary covers the history and politics of the period it also focuses on a series of key individuals to tell the story of Reconstruction, much as Ken Burns did in ""The Civil War."" Marshall Twitchell, a former Yankee officer from Vermont, became a successful ""Carpetbagger"" in Louisiana who had a violent neighbor in planter B. W. Marston (whose descendant tells his family's side of the story. Fan Butler tried to keep her family's Georgia plantations, which grew rice, afloat through sharecropping. John Roy Lynch was a freed slave who succeeded in politics because of Reconstruction, while Tunis Campbell tried to stop whites from controlling blacks in his county and measured his idealism with provocative efforts that made him a target for trying to give the Negro supremacy over the white man. You can make your own judgment as to how representative these choices are as focal characters, given that they represent both Southern and Northern as well as white and black Americans, but they do allow the history to be personalized as well as setting up the historians being interviewed to speak to the greater significance of their individual stories.

With regards to the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, I would contend that it does not necessarily need to be turned into a question of Reconstruction. Johnson's crime was not that he wanted to fire a member of his cabinet, but rather than he tried to fire a Radical Republican when, you have to remember, he was neither. Abraham Lincoln was not re-elected to the presidency as a Republican, but rather as a member of the ""Union"" party, with Johnson, a Democrat who was the only U.S. Senator from the South not to resign following secession, as his running mate. The first part of this documentary does a good job of trashing Johnson as racist who even betrayed his allegiance to poor whites over the planters because of his disregard for the freed slaves. By the time Grant takes over the White House from Johnson there is simply too much momentum behind Reconstruction for any chief executive to do anything about it. Even when the Congress passes civil rights legislation it is not enforced as the Democrats regain control of the South and eventually the laws are declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. It would take a century for those rights to be passed again and actually become the law of the land.",1123459200,91,4614,5.0604467805519056
1968684,2,B00013EY6W,"You would think that PBS, in producing a three hour look at Reconstruction, would have the time to be comprehensive in its approach to the subject.  Unfortunately, this documentary is anything but comprehensive.  In its effort to present a simplistic narrative that is conveniently PC as well, this documentary ends up being woefully misleading and inadequate as a useful overview of the period.

The simplistic narrative is to look at the entire experience through the lens of attempts by the North to achieve racial equality for freed slaves in the South.  All well and good.  But the problem is this documentary presents a false picture of the actions of the Radical Republicans in Congress as being motivated solely by committments to racial equality, when in fact many Republicans favored extending the right to vote for blacks for reasons of crass political power that would make the Republican party a permanent majority.  Telling the true story of Reconstruction means we have to be given the Radicals warts and all, and unfortunately the determination of this documentary is to leave out the warts.

Nowhere does this become more apparent in the outrageous treatment of Andrew Johnson's impeachment.  There is much time spent in part one detailing Johnson's lack of enthusiasm for Reconstruction and his desire to be lenient with the south.  All well and good.  But it soon becomes clear that this focus is to set up the straw man idea that Johnson was an obstacle who *should* have been removed from office.  How else to explain then, the reason why the impeachment and attempted removal of Johnson is suddenly, without any details, dismissed in a matter of twenty seconds?

Students who have heard of something called the Tenure Of Office Act won't hear about it here.  Nor will they hear about the outrageous disregard for the impeachment process that Congress exercised in their rush to get Johnson removed.  The blunt reality is that no matter how much of a racist Johnson was, he was nearly removed from office over a dangerous misuse of power committed by the Congress, who in effect demanded a veto power over a President's right to fire members of his own Cabinet.  And this outrageous attempt at a power grab, when all they had to do was wait for Johnson's term of office to expire, ultimately did more harm to the cause of Reconstruction than anything else, because it depicted the Radicals as power-hungry madmen with no regard for the separation of powers and principles of the Constitution that had to be respected even in the midst of fulfilling the new duties to the rights of freed blacks.

For this documentary to pass over this incident in a multi-hour production on Reconstruction in favor of too many details on anecdotal stories on individual people in the south is a travesty, and represents a clear indicator of why students aren't learning about history properly if documentaries like this are to be their guide.

POSTSCRIPT:
Mr. Bernabo's review above, made subsequent to mine, I'm afraid misses the point of why this documentary's refusal to get into specifics regarding the Johnson Impeachment represents something very serious.  There has too often been a chorus among scholars responsible for the ""Revisionist"" approach to Reconstruction like the notorious Eric Foner, to push the notion that Johnson deserved what he got because of his racism and to completely gloss over the horrific Constitutional issue raised by the Tenure Of Office Act.  My contention is that if we don't look at the specifics behind the Consitutional abuses that the Radicals engaged in to advance their cause, we are not doing any justice to the study of Reconstruction.  If we are to elevate the saintliness of the Radicals, as the Revisionist school likes to do, then we can not do so by sweeping under the rug those actions that simply can not be defended.  Congressional passage of the Tenure Of Office Act did not have the potential to be a mere one-shot exercise in power based on extraordinary circumstances as Abraham Lincoln's suspension of habaes corpus had been during the Civil War.  It carried with it, a very real long-term threat to the principles of separation of powers that are as much a vital part of our Constitution as the provision of equality to all.  When we start ignoring this part of Reconstruction in favor of the pure social history approach favored by this documentary and the revisionist scholars, then meaningful historical inquiry is the ultimate loser.

POSTSCRIPT #2
-I am now compelled to update my review once again because of the low-road attack by Mr. Felux in his review.  If I wanted to play his game, I could say some choice words about Eric Foner's stances on present-day issues (the kind that made him not popular among the families of 9/11 victims) , but I have too much respect for the premise that an assessment of Mr. Foner's views of Reconstruction should be taken apart on their own substantive merit, and that whatever stances he has on current-events issues is not relevant.  Mr. Felux, in taking the opposite approach, in which he would prefer to spend more time yapping about the Bill Clinton impeachment than the Johnson impeachment as a way of criticizing my ability to be a ""legitimate historian"" only reveals how his own skills of analysis are seriously lacking in the credibility department.

POSTSCRIPT #3 (1/27/06)
-We now have another review by a left-wing teacher that again tries to evade the central problem of this documentary in terms of its competency to comprehensively tell the story of Reconstruction and instead engage in some partisan cheap shots.  First off ""Art"", I never introduced my own politics into this review, that was Mr. Felux's doing when he felt a need to traipse about and look at my other reviews as his criteria for criticizing my assessment of this movie.  I am a college history teacher too by profession, and if I choose to show a documentary in class as a supplement to what I teach my students, I prefer to find one that does a decent job of staying on-target.  This documentary didn't do that by giving an inordinate amount of time to Eric Foner's perspective, and dismissing one of the most, if not the most critical story in the entire Reconstruction saga, regarding the facts of the Johnson Impeachment.  And no amount of cheapshots from the left-wing is going to change the fact that this documentary failed miserably in its stated purpose of being a supposedly comprehensive view of Reconstruction.",1118793600,49,6512,4.914233576642336

1968689,4,B00013EY6W,"The American Experience documentary ""Reconstruction: The Second Civil War"" is I find both interesting and disappointing. There are some good situations that are talked about in the video that bring to life what was taking place in the country after the end of the Civil War as plans were coming into place to bring the country back together. Yet at the same time there was a lot more going on during that period that gets just a slight mention or no mention at all. Unfortunately most Americans today seem to have no interest in history, especially of our own history as a country. They look at events like the Civil War which took place in the 19th century as something that happened a long time ago without understanding that while that war may have been fought in the 19th century and we are now in the 21st century this country is still feeling the effects and results of what occurred then.

But at least many Americans know some of the more important people who were involved in that war and are slightly familiar with a few of the more famous battles. But the period that would occur after the end of the war called reconstruction would begin a new period in the country as it tried to heal itself and become one nation again. And it wouldn't be easy. What would take place in a little over a decade after the Civil War ended would become a period that was just as deadly and bloody as the Civil War itself and probably more brutal. There were many in the South who were still very bitter at losing the war and not about to be ""reconstructed"" so to speak. Still angry at how the North treated them during the war and even though the Confederacy was no longer in existence there were many who were ready to take up arms. Forming secret armies like the Ku Klux Klan the South was ready to defend against Northern troops who were in the south to maintain order as reconstruction was being put into place.

 The video ""Reconstruction: The Second Civil War"" doesn't look so much at that aspect of that time as it does at the politics that was going on in Washington and the South. It tells about how with the war over and starting the healing process Blacks who had been slaves were now starting to for the first time to taste freedom. Land formerly owned by the slave owners were now going to be owned by the former slaves. ""Forty acres and a mule"" is how they labeled it as the land was being divided up. Suddenly too now Blacks not only had the right to vote and take part in the election process but they could run for office as well and take part in establishing laws and legislations. Former slaves now had control over their own lives. But from the start there was going to be problems with reconstruction. Abraham Lincoln before the war had ended had already formulated in his mind how to start the healing process in bringing the country back together. But before he could get anything into place he would of course be assassinated by John Wilkes Booth and the process of reconstruction would fall into the hands of the new President Andrew Johnson. His plans on how to implement reconstruction would be a bit different from Lincoln.

The sad part to watching the politics that was going on during this period was seeing how southern politics in time slowly started taking back everything that had been giving to the freed slaves. By 1877 when the reconstruction period came to an end Blacks in the country had pretty much nothing left but their freedom and even that had limits placed on it thanks to various laws that had been put in place throughout the south. You get the impression in watching this that it was the politics of the day that did more to unravel reconstruction then the guns and terror that was being waged by the Klan and other secret armies at that time though the violence of that era played a part. Sadly in the end it would be almost a hundred years after the end of reconstruction before real civil rights laws would be put into place to grant equal protection under the law for everyone who called themselves Americans.

This documentary by the PBS series ""American Experience"" does a fairly good job of telling about reconstruction and what took place though as I already pointed out this documentary really only looks at the political side of what was taking place and not I feel the whole picture of what was going on. I also find the pace of this documentary a bit slow paced and at times dragging a little. If the pace was a little better in the filming of this I would have probably given this 5 stars then. Still you can't go wrong in getting this DVD if you are interested in learning more about an important period in American history that unfortunately is little known by many Americans today.",1424217600,2,4740,4.487833140208575

1968701,5,B00013EY6W,"This was an outstanding film.  I was amazed to find that many of the reviewers knew very little about African-American history.  At the age of nine I rebuffed a statement by my fourth grade teacher who told me to shut up and sit down.  From that time on (1949) I realized I wasn't going to get much of an education in the New York public schools. I have been studying African-American and Third World History eversince -- which is about 64 years. I can only say that in most public schools, ignorance abounds. Anyone who can  with a straight face say that Lincoln really cared about the fate of the Negro, doesn't know his/her history.  Lincoln said that if he could preserve the Union without freeing the slaves, he would.  That is quite a statement for a man whose mother was a Melungeon (a free woman of color--black. Check out the DVD ""Hidden Colors"")  I am always tempted to burst out, either into tears or laughter when I see people standing beneath Lincoln's statue as if he cared what happened to slaves. The North/South fought each other to preserve their financial interests. To make matters worse, slavery continued after 1865 for another 80 years, using the penal system (it still does in some states)  Let's get real here.

Any thinking person would buy this film, review it and also purchase the DVD, ""Slavery by Another name,"" and shake awake their neurons because they are obviously fast asleep. After 64 years of research, living abroad 30 of them, conducting observations and interviews with colonized people in the Third World (Africa, Australia and many other countries where there are indigenous people of color, I returned to America in 1993 and wondered when everyone had fallen asleep or whether there was something in the water.  In 1963 when I left, people were well aware of their history.  Today they all seem to be in 'fairy floss' land.  Get the films, get the books, get cracking!!!

1968702,5,B00013EY6W,"This program is outstanding. Telling the story of Reconstruction through several case studies, the viewer see this agonizing chapter in American history through a clear window. The scholars offering commentary are the best in the field. I highly recommend this program.",1360368000,2,269,5.585365853658536
1968703,5,B00013EY6W,Another great documentary from PBS - American Experience. It covers the important years after the Civil War. A major chapter in the United States history. A must purchase!,1355270400,,171,5.142857142857143
1968704,3,B00013EY6W,"The video is somewhat informative, but it didn't cover the issues of reconstruction that I was expecting.  It did cover some of the political issues, but it was more about the African American issues.  I was hoping for some of the long term repercussions in the south as a result of this horrible era.",1307750400,10,301,4.555555555555555
1968705,4,B00013EY6W,I use portions of this DVD in my history class.  It is historically accurate and the reenacted scenes are well done.,1279065600,6,116,4.523809523809524
8005855,2,B00013EY6W,"This film was quite disappointing as it seemed to reflect only the effects  on African Americans.  It did not cover very much of the Reconstruction period, including the people who were brought in to govern the regions.  It did not cover the lives of notable Southerners, like General Lee, during Reconstruction nor did it cover much if anything about the impeachment of Andrew Johnson and the fractious state of politics in Washington.  So,
it was very narrow in its scope.",1525392000,,474,4.8875
8005856,5,B00013EY6W,"I used this for a class, to supplement readings from Eric Foner and W.E.B. DuBois.  This is very well done, though it probably needs some additional context for viewers to get the most out of it.  Take notes!  Then, look up more details about the post-Civil War Reconstruction.  It is likely that you will learn things you didn't know before.

Highly recommended, in any case.",1516406400,,376,4.723076923076923

8005860,5,B00013EY6W,"A very interesting presentation on a very dark chapter in our nation's history. It covers the period of US history from the end of the Civil War up until approximately the 1880's, when the Northern-supported Republican state governments in the former Confederate states were gradually replaced with white Democratic governments. It is surprisingly even-handed in its treatment of the hypocrisy that existed on both sides. For instance, while the Northern states were insisting on full voting rights for African-Americans in the South, only a few of them allowed blacks in their states the same privileges. It was effective also in presenting the impacts of Reconstruction on the lives of ordinary people, by profiling several of them (both black and white). Unfortunately, some of the emotions that were stirred up during this period still persist. In New Orleans, near where I live, there was a recent interest in removing or at least downgrading the monuments and street names based on Confederate leaders such as Robert E. Lee. The city found that they would have to keep the identities of companies that were bidding to do the work secret, because some of them were receiving death threats! I can definitely recommend this to anyone with an interest in American history.",1488499200,4,1274,5.1298076923076925
