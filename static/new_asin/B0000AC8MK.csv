1904606,4,B0000AC8MK,"Dorothy Mills is an engaging, deliberately paced psychological thriller with supernatural leanings.  The acting, especially of the two leads is excellent and the direction effective.  It's much more character and plot driven than standarad horror fare and builds atmosphere and tells a story more than going for the cheap jump scare.  After building nicely throughout, the climax seems rushed and lacks the thought and deliberation that the rest of the film demonstrated.  While not quite 4 star quality due to the rushed ending, I rounded up.",1247097600,,543,5.27906976744186
1904607,4,B0000AC8MK,"This was a very well made movie with quality acting by all. The description of the movie does not tell the whole story. There is much more to the story line that is very interesting. There's a lot of tension and a few bloody scenes, mainly dead sheep. Dorothy is a ""gifted"" young girl who many believe is under demonic control. A doctor comes to comes to her home after a disturbing incident Dorothy has while babysitting. The doctor believes Dorothy has multiple personalities. This is when the story really takes shape and draws you in. What is really Dorothy's gift??? You will have to watch the movie to find out. Very entertaning story and well worth a watch.",1242604800,4,664,4.588235294117647
1904608,3,B0000AC8MK,"Dorothy Mills has a lot going for it. Its well acted, has a nice plot with a bit of originality to it (pretty rare nowadays), well written, well shot, the recipe for a stellar movie. Unfortunately I also found it to be quite dull. The movie is very somber, and meant to be as such, but it was just so grey, it kind of made me tune out at times. Nothing more I can say about it really, it has a multitude of good points, but just came off a little slow. Still recommended though.",1242000000,3,478,4.042105263157895
1904609,2,B0000AC8MK,"There are two reasons to rent this DVD: Carice van Houten who is becoming one of the finest actresses on the screen today and the scenery of Ireland.  Otherwise this tedious and silly 'thriller' is a tired unimaginative rehash of all of the previous movies about multiple personality disorders such as The Three Faces of Eve, Sybil, etc that are so superior to this story written by Juliette Sales and writer/director Agn&egrave;s Merlet.

Apparently hoping to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, director Merlet places her story on an Island off Ireland populated with a  sick group of folks who protect the strange secrets of the title character Dorothy Mills (Jenn Murray). Needing to explore her own demons, a Dublin psychiatrist Dr Jane Van Dopp (van Houten) gains the assignment to explore the strange case of Mills and her history. In a series of flashbacks and inane reenactments of incidents, the truths behind the island's strange inhabitants, Dorothy Mills, and Dr Jane Van Doop come forward.  The ending has a twist but not one that justifies the dull story that requires a large amount of patience on the part of the viewer.  Pass on this one.

1904610,5,B0000AC8MK,"I loved this movie! I was captivated from beginning to end. At first I didn't know what to make of Dorothy, but I was blown away by how I came to be pulled into her character. This movie was chilling, suspenseful, and moving. You will love her and everyone she is!",1239148800,3,264,4.196078431372549
1904611,5,B0000AC8MK,"WOW...

I can only say ""wow""... this film boosts the performance of a lifetime. Young Jenn Murray is simply amazing as this young girl suffering from multiple personalities that may or may not be the work of the dead.

She is simply amazing!

The story is quite simple: a doctor from the mainland goes to a remote Irish island where 15 year old Dorothy Mills seems to have murdered a baby. As she starts to know Dorothy and spend some time with her, she uncovers the many personalities inhabiting the girl's body. There is an innocent 3 year old girl... a boy who protects Dorothy from killing herself... a slut who teases the town's men... and Duncan who is a little more violent than the others.

It all seems to be a simple case of multiple personalities until young Dorothy talks to the doctor as her lost son. And suddenly we start to understand that there's more to the town's dead than we can see... because they all end up in Dorothy's body.

This film is much more a FABULOUS supernatural/psychological drama than plain horror. And in its own right, it is truly amazing. The story is magnificently well told with unbelievable performances. The direction is sharp, precise and masterful. Everything here is right.

Don't expect any gore.
Expect an inexpensive Irish film that will give you an amazing experience seldom found in films with 10 times the budget.

Simply amazing!",1238457600,4,1384,4.717842323651452
1904612,5,B0000AC8MK,"I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie, but as I followed the story I found myself more and more drawn into it and just when I thought I had it all figured out, and that I was watching a modern version of ""The Many Faces of Eve"" BAM!  The plot took a turn that made me wonder if the story could really be going that way.

The ending definitely offers you an AH HA! finish.

If you enjoyed movies like The Exorcist and The Sixth Sense, this movie will satisfy your entertainment needs in a very subtle and psychological way.  I'm definitely going to watch it again and again!",1236988800,2,600,4.146551724137931
1904633,5,B0000AC8MK,"You will never see a story like this ever again on the screen so if you appreciate something new and original then this is the film to see and even keep in your collection for sure. Not much can be said in order not to spoil the plot but for all of you video gamers out there, this is the film about the private lives of the villagers from Resident Evil 4 video game. I'm dead serious!!! You'll see...",1407024000,,401,4.0886075949367084

A psychiatrist is assigned to work on the case of a disturbed young girl.

Review - 2/5
On the cover it says 'A contemporary take on The Exorcist', yeah not really. This is absolutely nothing like The Exorcist nor is it as entertaining or scary. I almost fell asleep at the agonizing slow pace I had to deal with the first hour. It picks up towards the end, but it's not anything new. Tried to throw some awful twist into it, and frankly I wasn't shocked or amazed. Can we please stop making possession/split personality films. Geez!",1399766400,2,545,4.45
1904637,3,B0000AC8MK,"What a boring movie. The premise is okay, but it just moves so slowly. I'm a fan of suspense, but this builds at an utter snail's pace only to reveal a predictable ""twist.""

Aside from that, the product was shipped quickly, arrived fast and was packed well to prevent any damage to the disc..",1382054400,,292,4.407407407407407
1904638,3,B0000AC8MK,The scenery in this movie was beautiful.  The story was a little slow; but I was surprised at the end.,1378684800,,102,4.1
1904639,4,B0000AC8MK,This movie is more of a suspence film. You feel you can diagnose her with a medical disorder then later you find out the truth. Finding out that what you thought was it really wasn't.,1377043200,,183,4.257142857142857
1904640,2,B0000AC8MK,I bought this movie thinking that it was a scary movie. But much to my wife's and my disappointment it turned out to be a psycological thriller. Don't buy it if you are expecting a scary movie. The title and legend of the movie are completely misleading.,1375142400,,254,4.425531914893617
1904641,4,B0000AC8MK,"Sorry to disagree with some remarks of this movie being slow(?). I liked the pace of it and it gave you time to really understand the different characters and their secrets and lies. it added much needed depth to the story, something that is lacking in many Hollywood films.",1375056000,,274,4.612244897959184
1904642,4,B0000AC8MK,"This is once again a really good movie, scary and disturbing all in one, the characters are well placed and I love movies from different countries, gives a new dimension to films.",1372118400,,179,4.625
1904653,3,B0000AC8MK,"I would have to say that I knew where this was going. It was pretty easy to determine. I understood why the townspeople thought her remarkable, especially for the setting. The outcome was pretty good, knowing it's what was expected. I would say it's a light horror. No gory details so it's safe for those that don't like the ""blood stuff"".

Spoiler alert: Don't read further if you don't want to know about the storyline:

It's patterned after The Three Faces of Eve. That's my best guess. So, that pretty much tells you where it's all coming from. Right down to the ""history"" of the ""why"". I look at this as a remake of Eve, but from a different view. It's a child, not an adult telling their story. I liked the Eve movie, so this one was right on target.",1364947200,,756,4.3546099290780145
1904654,4,B0000AC8MK,"The story was very good and the actors were really good. I have to say that I'm mystified as to why this would be compared to ""The Exorcist,"" since there is absolutely nothing whatsoever in this movie that resembles it in anyway. This story is another of the latest trend in paranormal stories wherein someone is possessed by the dead victim of a crime committed by someone still living. The difference here is that it's actually quite well-done. The lead actresses, Jenn Murray as Dorothy Mills and Carice van Houton as Jane, are exceptional, as is the rest of the cast. I would highly recommend this movie.",1363564800,,608,4.691588785046729
1904655,1,B0000AC8MK,"Beware, these are NOT recited by the authors!  You might think from the product description that this contains actual readings by Ogden Nash and Dorothy Parker.  In fact, what you get are staged readings by Jack Lemmon and a coupla chicks.  I paid only $1 + shipping, so I'm not torqued off, but I see a coupla high priced offerings, so I thought you should know what they're actually selling.",1360713600,,393,4.585714285714285
1904656,5,B0000AC8MK,"I came across DOROTHY MILLS quite by accident, and I'm certainly glad I did! With its perfectly unsettling mix of various (yet original) elements from THE EXORCIST, THE WICKER MAN, WAKE WOOD, and SYBIL, DM should be a supernatural classic. The interplay between Jane (Carice van Houten) and Dorothy (Jenn Murray) make the building horror absolutely believable, and make up the core of this dark gem. If you are a lover of the paranormal, psycho-thriller w/ heavy doses of dread and paranoia, then DOROTHY MILLS will fill your soul w/ ice...",1354752000,8,540,4.945054945054945
1904657,4,B0000AC8MK,"Dorothy Mills was a pretty good suspense thriller and borderline scary.

We enjoyed it.  I don't wish to be specific because any details will give the movie away for a first time viewer. The idea was not entirely original.  But the concept with respect to her personality was rearranged in an unexpected manner.  Enjoy.",1351814400,,319,4.851851851851852
1904658,4,B0000AC8MK,"While ""Dorothy Mills"" didn't blow my socks off, it definitely held my attention. The acting was well done, and the unfolding of the plot, though somewhat predictably, was fun to watch. This film is a welcome addition to my movie library,",1287532800,,237,4.804878048780488
1904659,5,B0000AC8MK,"Forget everything that you think you know about DOROTHY MILLS.

You know nothing.

Dorothy has been accused of nearly strangling a baby in her care. Enter Jane, the court appointed psychologist sent to evaluate her mental state. I don't want to say any more and ruin the twists, curves and flat out blind sides this film delivers.

DOROTHY MILLS is fascinating, haunting, creepy. On certain levels, it reminded me of THE WICKER MAN. No, not that horrible remake with Nicholas Cage. The stunning original 1973 WICKER MAN. The isolation of the island and the pagan images during the dance evolved that whispful quality of THE WICKER MAN.

Everything about this story works. The characters, the setting, the twist within a twist within a twist. DOROTHY MILLS is like a Russian puzzle box. You think you know where you're going and there you are, inside another box.

I can't recommend DOROTHY MILLS enough! Just be prepared to lose the next couple hours and be mesmerized. It's nothing short of breathtaking.",1287014400,14,1005,4.923076923076923
1904660,5,B0000AC8MK,"Strong performances and good solid writing will keep you glued to this thriller. Now this is movie making! Now days, while Hollywood churns out special effects weighted drivel, we get a movie that is very well written and acted.

It's really hard to review this pot boiler of a thriller with out giving away it's secrets. It's easy to follow and understand, and clues are dropped right from the start what is going on. A mystery will start, but the movie will supply partial answers as it progresses so when it finally reaches it's peak, it all makes sense and doesn't overwhelm. You won't be scratching your head wondering what you watched, but instead your jaw will drop when it all falls into place.

Please take time to watch this film...it's worth it!",1283644800,,756,4.676691729323308
1904661,5,B0000AC8MK,"First of all, please remember this is not a Hollywood-kind of scary film where it makes you jump, sweat in fear or makes you scream every 5 seconds. This is a very well-crafted slow burner of a chiller. The type of supernatural horror that requires patience ( but that does not mean that this flick is yawn-inducing ) and also demands your understanding of each characters' frustrations in solving the mystery of this white pale girl named Dorothy...and those folks that live in her isolated village with their own perceptions of this girl.

 Get this only if you are the kind of person who loves slow burning thrill of a great old-fashioned supernatural horror movie. This story of Dorothy Mills lingers on my mind long after the credits ends. Oh, and watch out for the tremendous acting by this actress who played her. Flawless!",1280016000,,830,4.756944444444445

Most of the 1-2 star reviews were spot on. This movie was very disappointing. It was not scary, thrilling, suspensful, or evil (as proclaimed). Sure the storyline was (or I should say, could have been), but the delivery was where this movie fell short...very short.

One man in New Jersey has since been documented to have more than one hundred personalities, as have others since the phenomenon grows more common each year. This is not, however, ""A Modern Take On The Exorcist"" as the box advertises. It is not terribly ""frightening"" or bloody or erotic. It is a fairly-well written and well-acted and well-directed story of a young woman with a classic case of multiple personality disorder, and a clever plot twist, to boot. Watch carefully to catch all the subtle connections.
