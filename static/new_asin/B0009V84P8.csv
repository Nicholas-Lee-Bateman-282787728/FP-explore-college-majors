It's a real guy teaching you what he knows in the best way he can, which is refreshing and authentic. I own almost the whole set now, and I am not disappointed. One of the advantages of this series is that you can go through it in small steps and review the previous material.  The last 10-15 minutes of this DVD provide some of the most insightful teachings  on magic and the craft that I've seen anywhere.",1238889600,5,524,4.494736842105263
8067210,5,B0009V84P8,"I highly recommend this DVD for anyone serious about learning Herb Magic.  I have not found the information shared in this DVD in any book I have read.  The spells Peter demonstrates can be used in many ways, and he provides excellent ideas to help you develop your own style. I am very excited to make them part of my own spell library.

I can not say enough about the class environment you experience while watching the DVD, the world fades away, and you feel like you are actually there.  Thank you Peter!",1119830400,16,508,4.43010752688172
