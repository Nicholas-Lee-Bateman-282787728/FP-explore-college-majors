8325212,5,B000IAZO76,"This was excellent, but it's hard to pinpoint exactly why. Maybe the fact that it was made predominantly by teenagers and focuses on them as individuals, not just as lab rats. It is a real problem and seems more acute than when we were children. If you fear your child is being bullied, or is the bully, have them watch this. It is short, but it keeps your attention.",1182297600,2,367,4.333333333333333
8325213,5,B000IAZO76,Excellent documentary on bullying and school violence.  Presentation can be enlightening to both kids and adults.  Past events and news stories on school violence well integrated with opinions from students and teachers.,1178496000,,220,5.84375
8325214,5,B000IAZO76,"This film is amazing.... It made me cry.  I loved it and the message that is being enforced.  Everyone should see this, not just teens, but parents and teachers and just everyday people. It really opens your eyes.",1170028800,,213,4.578947368421052
8325215,5,B000IAZO76,"This is an extremely effective tool to show to teens and pre-teens because it has a great message without sounding preachy. It connects to teens I have shown it to who then feel compelled to change their behavior. It's light on specific suggestions for change but definitely is one of the best ways I've seen to start a forward thinking dialogue with actual teens, instead of 'administrators' who aren't doing the bullying in the first place. Well worth the money.",1169251200,,464,4.8125
8325216,5,B000IAZO76,"After working with troubled teens in a high school in south Stockton, CA, I saw first hand, the life that these kids had to deal with.  I was surprised they even made it to school in the morning!  I wish that I had this film to show to all of the kids that I worked with, because it truly is a real-life portrayal of what teens have to go through, day in and day out.  Teachers, parents, administrators, counselors and social workers NEED to see this film.  It might help in understanding and listening to our teens, and not always putting them to blame.  Everyone across the nation should see this film!  It is definitely a must-see!!",1169078400,,635,4.384615384615385
8325217,5,B000IAZO76,"Since I am no longer in high school, I was doubtful that the issues covered in the film would affect me. While watching, I saw that these issues affect everyone. Teens across the U.S. are becoming more and more violent, and though people are noticing, it seems that little is being done.

I wish Teen Truth had been around while I was in high school. Though I attended a Catholic private school, there was true hatred among peers there. I had never been treated so low, by so many people, just because my parents weren't rich.

One part in the film that truly gripped me was the raw footage from Columbine. It is especially heartbreaking now, because the video game industry is teaching teens to beat up their Bullies. Hasn't anyone learned anything from Columbine?

I know this review is a little long-winded, but I feel that producing educational footage against violence is something this country needs. So if you aren't a teen or don't have children, this film is still an important tool in awareness.",1168905600,2,1005,4.698863636363637
8325218,5,B000IAZO76,"This is a candid and personal look at teen violence in America. The topic is timely and hearing what actual teens have to say about the subject brings a new perpective to the issue. Teachers and school administrators can benefit from the information and discussion points. Kids need to talk about this and keep talking about it, in order for the violence to stop. I strongly recommend this DVD to schools and parents of teens.",1168905600,2,426,4.693333333333333
8325219,3,B000IAZO76,"Although this dvd is very insightful as to the circumstances surrounding teen violence and suicide, it offers very little (if any) suggestions for students in those situations.  It focuses more on the cause than on the solution.  The teens who watch this will gain a sense that they are not alone in being victims, but it offers very little hope that things will ever change.  It just wasn't what I expected.  Insightful, powerful, yes.  A tool for change, no.",1168473600,3,460,4.772151898734177
8325220,5,B000IAZO76,"Teen Truth is an intense documentary that attacks head on the epedemic of violence in school.  This is a different kind of educational film, it's not a bunch of adults preaching to kids about what they think causes school violence, it's the kids themselves trying to understand and explain what drives certain teens to act out.  Interviews with High School students explore the dynamics 'fitting in' and the anger and sadness that can build when someone isn't let in to the accepted social structure.  It's an eye opener for kids who may not think their words and actions make a difference.  The film is also a great reminder for adults of how truely important it was as a teenager to feel like you had friends who understood and supported you.

This film should be required viewing in all high schools",1168387200,4,802,4.7
8325221,5,B000IAZO76,"After watching ""Teen Truth,"" I thought back to all of the educational videos shown to me through my entire career as a student. They were always dull and laughable with poor production qualities. They lectured and never entertained. Many students would sleep through the films, while others found better things to do like passing notes. But this film is different as it manages to be educational and entertaining. Statistics such as ""30 percent of teens are involved in school bullying"" or ""52 percent of teens feel pressure to look certain ways"" pop up on the screen, while soundbytes from various individuals share view points. The film also runs down assorted forms of bullying like teasing, intimidation, exclusion, spreading rumors and physical attacks, while noting bullying causes isolation, anxiety, anger and can lead to students wanting to kill. Christopher uses quick cuts, graphics and subtitles to emphasize certain quotes and the haunting music of Darren Fung. Somehow the whole thing manages to come off slick, yet raw at the same time. It feels less like something a high school student would be forced to watch at school and more like something they would chose to watch at home.

More importantly though, ""Teen Truth"" is the most understanding portrayal of school violence ever captured on film. That's because Christopher isn't looking to place blame with his film. He's not interested in scapegoats. No mention of any types of music, movies, entertainers or video games that possibly influenced any shootings are ever brought up. Christopher's film is more of a sympathetic hand reaching out, hoping to help in whatever way possible. Mostly what we get are teenagers candidly sharing their thoughts and voicing their opinions - which is all any of the gunmen ever seemed to want to do in the first place.

When Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold walked into their high school in Littleton, Colo. on April 20, 1999 and proceeded to kill 12 of their peers, a teacher, and wound 24 others, a lot of people didn't understand why. Seven years after the event, the contents of Eric and Dylan's journals were finally made available to the public. Both were filled with sadness, loneliness and hate from being rejected by peers. Eric penned, ""Whatever I do people make fun of me,"" while Dylan wrote, ""I don't know what I do wrong with people, it's like they set out to hate and ignore me."" These writings clearly show individuals that are hurting. They felt alone. They felt rage. They wanted acceptance. They wanted to be noticed. They wanted to be heard.

One of the girls interviewed in ""Teen Truth,"" making a general statement about all teenage gunmen, probably said it best. ""They wanted to make their statement and say, `This is the way you treated us.' And they feel that this is the repercussion of not treating people like they're actually human.""

Perhaps now more people will begin to understand that. In Michael Moore's Oscar winning documentary ""Bowling for Columbine"" Marilyn Manson was asked what he would have said to Eric and Dylan to prevent the Columbine tragedy from happening. Manson replied, ""I wouldn't say a single word to them, I would listen to what they have to say and that's what no one did."" Though too late for Eric, Dylan and the other students enraged to the point of violence, ""Teen Truth"" is giving high school students a voice on the subject. Now hopefully someone is listening.
