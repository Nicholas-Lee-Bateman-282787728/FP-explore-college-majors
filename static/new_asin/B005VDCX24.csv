8487413,5,B005VDCX24,I have watched this series on netflix three times and I love it.  I purchased it and can't wait to get it.  My daughter and co- workers are all into this movie.,1456531200,,160,3.96875
8487414,2,B005VDCX24,"I have rented and purchased many Korean TV dvds and I have never come across a worse job of subtitling on any of them.  What a shame!  I would go so far as to recommend not purchasing this dvd if you need English subtitles.  At times they are incoherent!  I was particularly upset by this because I am a huge fan of Song Il Gook's work.  The plot is unique and the performances for the most part are quite good but I was all but ready to throw in the towel midway.
I would definitely rent it before I purchased it.  It has made me leery of purchasing any Korean dvd with subtitles.  What a shame!",1363132800,,596,4.086206896551724
