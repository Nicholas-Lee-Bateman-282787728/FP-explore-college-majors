6994363,3,B00SXNK2O0,"MST 3000 and Ed Wood revivals prove there is a market for astoundingly bad movies, and that is where this one should be categorized.  Totally out of the league of Shatner's ""pro"" work, or real westerns for that matter.  It apparently was a throw-away, purely for the foreign market (note the excessive violence).  What does it offer the howler devotee?  Let's try to list it: 1) Awesome script.  (The sheriff had better not interfere while I fight with myself.)  2) Leering, clownish supporting cast.  3) Horseback riding to mood music from a Vegas floor-show band.  4) A couple of pompous Omega-Glory style speeches delivered by Shatner standing on a mountain, with Sun records tape echo.  5) Outdoors dialog all dubbed in from sessions taped in a small, hard-paneled room.  Some Spanish actors apparently redubbed from American stand-ins.  6) Shatner's Texas accent vacillates between Sacramento and Belfast Ireland.  7) Bar-fight destroys all the furniture, then the lawman orders the surviver, ""sit down!""  8) Horses continually skittish, veering to one side while trying to walk forward, you would swear they are embarrassed to be filmed.  9) Horse rides into the middle of the frame and disappears, turns out he walked behind a large mirror sitting in front of the old hotel, attempt at Hitchcock cinematography? 10) Shatner, all posing and dramatic pauses, on screen for the whole blasted thing - Friends, our family hasn't laughed so hard since we saw Airplane for the first time.

6994364,3,B00SXNK2O0,"The only reason to buy this film is to see William Shatner's pompous acting and laugh at his erroneous self-confidence. It is decently entertaining but I wasn't feeling any real ""part Comanche"" in his acting.",1223942400,2,208,4.9714285714285715
6994365,5,B00SXNK2O0,"Wait, isn't that Kirk?! OMG, look! That's Kirk too! Aimlessly clicking around the dial one evening, we were quickly sucked in when this movie aired on Turner Classic Movies. This is a delightfully bad 60's-era  double-cheesey Kirk McWhopper featuring James T in a dual role as both cowboy and Indian! Yes! Identical twin brothers except (oh, the delicious plot twist...) one is good and the other is bad!!!!11!

Filmed in Spain between the 1st and 2nd season of Star Trek, this movie boldy uses the same bad music, bad dialog, bad editing, bad camera work, and obviously the same bad acting as the original Trek. Blonde-Indian-Kirk eats peyote, does some war-whoops, and even busts into a god-like reverb as he tries to get the Comanches riled up. As a special bonus, some actors are dubbed, and some of the audio is out of sync.  I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. If you fancy yourself a student of Bad Cinema, whether or not you enjoy The Kirk, you owe it to yourself to get this movie.  Good clean fun.

Sample dialog: ""Everywhere I go he follows, with his thieving and his killing, until I cannot live in peace!""",1164931200,2,1130,4.601990049751244
6994366,2,B00SXNK2O0,"This is a Story Written by Robert I Holt and the Famous Frank Gruber who gave us Stories such as ""BROKEN LANCE"" AND ""BIG LAND""  and many others. This story is about a family of twin brothers born to White Father and an Indian Mother. One grew up in town yet respected the Indian Values and the other with the indian's but gone wild,Both played by William Shatner. Only diffrence to tell them apart was by the colour of their eyes,one with black eyes was called Notha killing and plundering and living wild with his renegade tribe, while other was of blue eyes called Johnny Moon, always getting mistaken,punished , beaten up for the crimes of the other .Till one day he could stand no more so he asked Notha for a showdown to finish this once for all in the town of Rio Hondo where the sheriff Logan played by Joseph Cotten. It is a Battle bitween Good and and the one gone astray. William Shatner acted very well in this one as always but this movie lost the grip and became a routine half way down.",1131580800,2,1000,4.319148936170213
8699770,3,B00SXNK2O0,Shatner is always entertaining but the sound and picture quality of this is pretty bad. It takes real focus to get through it.,1501804800,,126,4.521739130434782
8699771,4,B00SXNK2O0,"Released in 1968, White Comanche is a Spanish Western (no Spaghetti) starring William Shatner in a dual role as twin half-breed brothers, one who assimilates with the European settlers while the other stirs up Comanche hostilities. The former, Johnny Moon, holds up in a town waiting for a showdown with the latter, Notah. While there, he befriends (sort of) the sheriff played by Joseph Cotton and romances a saloon girl (Rosanna Yanni). Besides the menace of Notah, the three are caught between the factions of a range war.

Like Clint Eastwood with the so-called Man with No Name trilogy (1964-66) and Burt Reynolds with Navajo Joe (1966), Shatner decided to roll the dice with a Euro Western during his break from Star Trek. Unfortunately, whereas those movies enlisted the talents of the brilliant Ennio Morricone for their exceptional scores, White Comanche got stuck with a palpably bad score by Jean Ledrut (although there are a couple decent parts). Seriously, the crappy semi-jazz score sounds lifted from a vinyl album of failed nightclub music; it doesn't match the action, especially in the suspense-violence scenes, e.g., when Notah pursues the white woman and roughs her up in the opening act.

Another negative, like most Euro Westerns, is that the movie has a decidedly comic book tone that could never be mistaken for real life. Its only a rung above the tone of the 3rd Season Star Trek episode The Paradise Syndrome where Capt. Kirk acquires amnesia and becomes the Indian-like Kirok. Speaking of Star Trek, White Comanche is reminiscent of the 1st Season episode Enemy Within where Kirk is split into to two selves  a spiritual Kirk and a dark Kirk. Thats what you have with White Comanche where the story focuses on the good counterpart, Johnny Moon.

If you can look beyond the horrible score, comic book tone and Star Trek-isms, White Comanche has good characters, an engaging story and loads of Western action. I particularly enjoyed the interesting relationship that develops between Moon and Sheriff Logan. The relationship between Moon and Kelly (Yanni) is good too. If White Comanche had a decent score I would raise my rating.

The movie runs 93 minutes and was shot in Colmenar Viejo, Manzanares el Real & Estudios Roma, Madrid, Spain.

8699773,5,B00SXNK2O0,"Very good so-bad-it's-good Spanish-made English-dubbed mid-60's paella western.  William Shatner, on hiatus from Star Trek I guess, plays twin Comanche/white half-breeds.  One lives as an off-the-rails on the warpath Indian chief.  He's the bad one.  The other lives as a drifting white man, trying to escape being blamed for his twin's misdeeds.  Their family drama meets head-on in a tiny town.  One thing though, a leprechaun looks more like a half-breed than Shatner does.  Still he is good-looking.  Also stars Joseph Cotton as the town sheriff.  The rest of the cast is played by Spanish actors.  I always liked this little stinker.  The Warner Archives DVD-R release is the one to get.  The quality is great, probably the best it will ever be.  Recommended for Shatner fans.",1425254400,,781,5.05511811023622
8699774,5,B00SXNK2O0,"The only thing that saves the dismal western is Shatner's over-acting. I can see why he did so well in the Good Kirk/Bad Kirk episode, ""The Enemy Within""!  It's about a town sheriff who has a Comanche native American for an enemy and twin brother.  I can't beleive Joe Cotten would be part of this movie!  What was he thinking?  In a duel role Shatner can say lines to a stand in.  The music soundtrack was so bad, it makes the film worse.  It had to be one of those westerns made on a $1.98 budget.  If I could ask the Shatty one a question, I'd say, ""dude, what made you sign the dotted line for this movie?"".................",1356220800,,627,4.262711864406779

8699776,5,B00SXNK2O0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie even though others did not.  I found it to be a throwback type of Gunsmoke, and a good comedy.  (Note Notah Moon's oversize teeth).Compared to some of today's movies I found it to be refreshing and gave me a good laugh!",1268870400,,251,4.434782608695652
8699777,5,B00SXNK2O0,"I have read some other reviews of this film. It's a shame that people are so critical of William Shatner, yet will go out of their way to watch his movies. I feel that we all know who Bill Shatner is, and the acting we can expect. Especially from his earlier works. This was an earlier work. Honestly, I found the film to be a true classic. Shatner at his best. The movie is about two brothers, who share different parents, making each a half breed. Belonging to neither the white nor the Comanche society. It's a story of two men who cannot coexist in the same open west together. In many ways, it's a story of any family with two brothers. So, I liked the movie, and I give it five stars.
