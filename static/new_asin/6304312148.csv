7867639,5,6304312148,i think the movie was really good the actors was good in the movie the scenic shots on the movie were good also there were a couple scenes in the movie they could have done without of course in this day and time there is only a few wide and in between that don't have it.  but all in all it was still a good movie it shows you how cruel that some people can be in this in the movie but the good can win out in the end and love can win out to the good guys in the movie. this one i rate  a  ten for a very good movie.  virginia,1316822400,3,526,3.587719298245614

 British actors doing American accents, and doing them poorly. Hilarious at times but mostly just plain awful. That anyone could butcher a Follett novel so thoroughly is an achievement of sorts in itself.  If you want to see a Follett book come to life, see Eye of the Needle.  Now that's a movie!
