8121713,2,B000FFJYX4,"This is the final movie that pared Frankie Darro and Mantan Moreland. It's also the weakest film they did. Still fun, but Moreland should have had a stronger role.",1459814400,,163,4.655172413793103

8121715,1,B000FFJYX4,"This has a great B movie cast, everyone from Frankie Darro and Jackie Moran to Gale Storm and Mantan Moreland. The plot is workable but the movie just doesn't have that many laughs. This print is absolutely terrible -- you can find better prints on the Internet. Mantan Moreland is the best thing in the movie but even he can't save it.",1375833600,,336,4.435483870967742
