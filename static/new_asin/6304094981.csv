7861300,5,6304094981,This is absolutely one of the best moonshine runner movies since Thunder Alley with Robert Mitchum. A newer one is Lawless which was also very good but there was somthing about this one that stands out. It was an HBO movie and I guess thats why nobody has put it out on dvd but if you get a chance to see then do because it is terrific. Great acting and great actors. Nuff said.,1425513600,,378,4.121621621621622
