8494764,5,B001V5K3DC,I had bought two other dvds from the same production company before and I was very happy with those dvds! They contained space/Hubble image related footage with good sound tracks. I was hoping for some images of the Earth taken from space but the images are all shot from airplanes and are of mountain ranges and of the beautiful sky. The sound track is definitely one for relaxing and/or meditating after a busy day. Combined with the terrific footage of mountain ranges this is an excellent production. I would recommend this to the person looking for a relaxing dvd or for the person interested in footage of planet earth/mountain ranges. Remember this is all shot from airplanes and not from the space shuttle.,1371859200,,714,4.813008130081301
8494765,4,B001V5K3DC,The video should not be confused with the BBC Planet Earth series. This is a relaxation and meditation type video. There is to speaker telling you what you are looking at and no subtitles to tell you what you are looking at. This is just great footage placed to music. The only part I am not keen on is the 20 minute fire place after 40 minutes of wonderful aerial footage.,1299974400,3,373,4.267605633802817
8494766,1,B001V5K3DC,I wish I could see the closed captions or subtitle for profound deaf/hard of hearing audience. Amazon has failed to meet the ADA requirements.,1295654400,,142,4.958333333333333
