8045509,5,B00077LR8U,Love this movie; loved the book. Excellent experience.,1475020800,,54,5.875
8045510,5,B00077LR8U,"I bought this for my mom and she LOVED it. I watched parts of it and it was really good--I live in NYC and have seen Pale Male and his family numerous times--the film brings his life to life in a way that just seeing him flying around can't do because it includes his history and the joys and perils of living in the city. The film definitely draws you in and it's nice to learn about the birders who are so devoted to him and the other redtails. It's a very sweet video (it was made before all the drama when the nest was removed and put back, so none of that is in this film). Please note, though, this is EXACTLY the same film that's in the  ""Nature - Pale Male"" dvd that Amazon also sells, so if you were thinking of purchasing both, just get one of them or you'll waste your money. Only the covers are different (and the Nature one has the Nature theme music before it begins, this one doesn't, that's the only difference).",1389744000,4,928,4.155555555555556
8045511,2,B00077LR8U,I was hoping for the original (the one where Mary Tyler Moore goes after the Tenant association that removes the hawk nest) Anyone know where that one can be found?,1357257600,,164,4.5
8045512,3,B00077LR8U,"This is a decent documentary, but it is NOT the recent feature length film.
It is by the same director, which is misleading.
I would wait until march to get the actual theatrical release, as it tells the same story, but with more recent and dramatic events folded in.",1324857600,4,267,4.469387755102041
8045513,4,B00077LR8U,I think this film is a great way to wind down after a stressful day at work or when you're feeling down. It has a great meditative tone and fills you with fascination about life.,1234483200,4,178,4.114285714285714
8045514,5,B00077LR8U,"We have seen several red tailed hawks recently. We normally have the Coopers Hawk in our area but recently sighted a Red Tail and had to look up the bird.  We received Pale Male as a gift.  We have a friend who lives in New York near central park so we purchased it for her.  We love the story line, the scenery, and Pale Male.  The music score for the dvd is great!",1173312000,6,366,3.9726027397260273
