7971165,5,B00006L93P,A documentary approach to same sex love.  This man is so wanting to change the world and educate people that its ok for same sex love to happen and very normal.  He invents the word transsexual with his friend.  A true hero never discussed in the 'normal' world.  Another must see!,1425168000,,281,4.450980392156863
7971166,2,B00006L93P,"Earlier reviewers loved this movie, and if you like what their reviews said about it you'll hate mine.

This movie reminded me of the short educational films they used to show us in primary school in the 1950s, in which the topic was dramatized barely well enough that children could understand it, but not well enough that any adult would want to watch it.

The one I remember most clearly said, in effect, that you'll get tuberculosis if you kiss your grandmother on the lips. I remember that one probably because my grandmother (the only person who loved me) dropped dead (of a stroke, not TB) two weeks after my eighth birthday, and the pain and loss were so great that I'd gladly have joined her.

This movie has the same simplistic, pedantic, preachy tone as those films, and even lower production values. The acting was better in the granny-may-have-TB film. Rosa von Praunheim seems to care about the message only, not about any other aspect of movie-making (like entertainment).

Halfway through the movie, the actor playing Hirschfeld abruptly changes, from hunky Kai Schumann (listed far down in the credits, and not even mentioned here on Amazon, even though he dominates the first half of the movie and it's him on the cover) to doughy Friedel von Wangenheim, with this voice-over during the scene change: ""My craving for sweets had certain effects on my appearance."" That may be either an attempt at humor or a plea to ignore the startling actor switch.

I suspect that Schumann (who has gone on to a fairly successful acting career) cut and ran mid-filming when something better came along. Why else doesn't he share top billing with von Wangenheim? Each played Hirschfeld for half of the movie, and Schumann makes a far stronger impression.

Anyway, if for some reason you want to know about Magnus Hirschfeld and can't be bothered to read, then you may appreciate this move. I had known about it for years before I finally got so desperate for something new to watch that I broke down and rented it. The stupid title and the extraordinarily unappealing black-and-orange cover put me off, and I can't say I'm sorry. I'd be just fine if I'd never seen it.",1395532800,,2170,4.757978723404255
7971167,5,B00006L93P,"Rosa von Praunheim (Director), as usual, composed a provocative film about one of the icons of gender studies, Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld. Hirschfeld created the Institute for Sexual Science in Berlin in 1919 where he researched all aspects of human sexuality. Hirschfeld worked tirelessly for the decriminalization of homosexuality and would have succeeded if Black Friday had not prevented the passage of the bill. He also performed the first SRS for trans men and women. Praunheim adds a controversial fictional scene of surgery on an intersex patient for which we have no historical proof but which has, understandably, created quite a protest among an intersex audience. Nevertheless it is a worthwhile movie, especially since Hirschfeld, the gay Jewish scientist to whom the LGBT movement of today owes quite a debt, often without knowing it, may, in this manner, become better known.",1359936000,,885,5.328571428571428
7971168,5,B00006L93P,"Saw this film several years ago at a film festival. The film sent me by the supplier was in 1st rate condition and considering that i live in Australia & the product was coming from ""The States"", i was very impresssed that i did not have to wait long after it was despatched.",1267315200,,275,4.2075471698113205
7971169,4,B00006L93P,"The story of Magnus Hirschfeld, the German-Jewish doctor who was a pioneering sexologist in the early 20th century, is a fascinating one. Hirschfield's Institut fr Sexualwissenschaft in Berlin was world-famous for its research into, and treatment of, many aspects of human sexuality -- birth control, venereal disease, impotence, homosexuality, transvestitism, etc. Hirschfeld was also a remarkable fighter for repeal of Paragraph 175 in the German penal code, which declared homosexuality a punishable criminal offense.

The fine acting, beautiful photography, and script here are all a tribute to the gifted renegade director Rosa von Praunheim. The only flaw (or at least disappointment) in the film is that, rightly or wrongly, the character of the title role is not particularly likeable -- far from it. Hirschfeld is portrayed here as a visionary, dedicated doctor who is also egotistical and frequently indifferent to the feelings of those around him. His relationship with his young lover Karl Giese is generally hidden from the public, perhaps understandable given that it might have compromised Hirschfeld's image as an impartial researcher.

Fortunately the dramatic focus of the film is saved in the end by two remarkable actors: Olaf Drauschke (as Karl Giese) and Tima die Gttliche (as Dorchen, Hirschfeld's transvestite maid), who are not only likeable, but deliver poignant and at times eloquent performances.

As a quasi-documentary of a fascinating life, this film is highly recommended. As drama it is, while a bit shaky at times, still one not to be missed.",1244332800,3,1576,5.424489795918367
7971170,4,B00006L93P,"The iconoclastic German gay director Rosa von Praunheim's film THE EINSTEIN OF SEX - LIFE AND WORK OF DR. M. HIRSCHFELD is all too topical. The director records the events of the life of Magnus Hirschfeld, a German Jew famous for his outspoken quest for sexual tolerance, his fight to get Paragraph 175 that made homosexual acts a crime in Germany repealed, and his establishing of the Institute of Sexual Science in Berlin in 1920. The movie is important for shedding light on a real pioneer that not enough people know about and for reminding us that progress is never certain nor guaranteed and can be destroyed in an instant. The Nazis, while Hirschfeld was out of the country, closed his institute and destroyed many of his records.

The film is well photographed and the director manages to make a quasi-documentary interesting, not always an easy task. There is more male nudity than any contemporary U. S. film would even attempt with the possible exception of the recent KINSEY. Included in the DVD is a documentary, parts of which cannot be heard, although the director comes through as quite a character. He has taken the name ""Rosa"" because of the pink triangles that homosexuals were forced to wear in the Nazi camps.

This film is well worth watching, both for its historical significance and its artistic achievement.",1151107200,10,1332,4.863436123348017
7971171,4,B00006L93P,"""The Einstein of Sex"" shows the life of Magnus Hirschfeld, a German Jew who helped pioneer the scientific study of sex.  Hirschfeld became so famous for his work that he could joke that Einstein might be better known as the Hirschfeld of Physics.  After achieving his greatest successes in the 1920s, Hirschfeld's Institute in Berlin was shut down by the Nazis in 1933, with Hirschfeld dying in exile in France a couple of years later.
Three actors portray Hirschfeld - one for the ten-year old sex sketcher, one for the student and young doctor, and one for the middle-aged doctor and institution head.  The latter two are immersed in a world of male sexuality.
The audience gets to see a parade of attractive, freqently unclothed men, who appear as patients, nudists, hyper-masculine patriots, transvestites, or as other examples of early twentieth century marginal groups. Some scenes look like recreations of photographs from the period. Seemingly modern activities like ""outing"" or fighting sodomy laws were being done a long time ago.
Hirschfeld himself is shown trying for years to stay celebate and focus on his work, despite various temptations.  He develops a relationship with a cute assistant, Karl Giese (played by Olaf Drauschke), that lasts for many years (though the film telescopes this).  Toward the end Hirschfeld takes a long trip and cheats on Giese, although this is not explored in depth.  So there is some personal journey mixed in with the wide social survey.
The camera work and sets give the movie an inexpensive feel, although the acting is servicable.  I especially liked Drauschke (Giese), Gerd Lukas Storzer as Baron von Tauschenberg (a young, early assistant to Hirschfeld), and Gerry Wolf (as Hirschfeld's conservative uncle).
A big plus is that there is a 30+ minute documentary on Magnus Hirschfeld and director Rosa von Prauheim.  This gives more background on the history and on the director's views.  There is also some documentary footage in the main film.
The photo gallery has some hot photos not in the film.  Some of these appear on the back of the DVD case (with suitable alteration).
I upgraded the film a bit for the idea that Hirschfeld managed to do sex research on a scale unequalled before or since.  (Kinsey was an honorable second.)  Nowadays, the US Federal government resists funding any sort of sexuality study; having a finding that gay or bi sexuality is normal would outrage too many.  Since the Nazis destroyed the Institute's records (forcing future researchers to start from scratch), this unique movie and accompanying documentary is a reminder of what is useful and possible.  ""The Einstein of Sex"" is a worthwhile DVD to watch or own.",1083196800,12,2698,5.020179372197309
7971172,3,B00006L93P,"This movie depicted the life of Magnus Hirschfield, a gay Jewish sexologist who helped advance the cause a gay rights decades before Stonewall.  His research and institute were tragically destroyed by the Nazis.  This film is a little low-budget.  If it weren't for all the nudity, I'd almost think it was a TV movie.  Maybe it was a play that finally got set to film.  It does an excellent job of illustrating the gay, feminist, and nudist movements happening during the Weimar Republic.  It also briefly touched on the debates, raging at the time, that gay men were either androgynous or hypermasculine.  As a gay Jewish man during the Nazi terror, this figure and movie showed how Hirschfield was mistreated as a Jew and that more than just Jews were brutalized during that tragic time.  Historians and interested people of all backgrounds should be interested in hearing of Dr. Hirschfield.  This movie had a transsexual character and a hermaphrodite, so other sexual minorities may really like seeing it.  It is so important for people to know that even before 1969, there were ppl challenging homophobia in their societies and standing up for themselves.  I am glad that a German company decided to highlight a gay hero.",1057190400,17,1226,4.902912621359223
