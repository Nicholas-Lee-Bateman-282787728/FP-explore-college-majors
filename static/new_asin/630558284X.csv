7892252,4,630558284X,very good had an old vhs version in which the end of the final fight was cut out and completely black screen though sound was there. so very happy to see entire movie,1393891200,,166,4.0606060606060606
7892253,3,630558284X,"This movie is a low-budget piece featuring, most noticeably, Cassanova  Wong.  His kicking prowess is truly impressive and memorable.  But the plot  is easily forgettable.  The fight scenes throughout the film are a cut  above mediocre.  The final battle is engaging, but still not enough for a  must-see.",969148800,,305,5.208333333333333
7892254,5,630558284X,"This movie is eye popping from the first minutes to the final battle.  Great choreography, and the fight scenes showcase many shapes and styles.  The Story line is like many martial arts genre films, all about revenge.  But this one doesn't have any chance of boring or losing the viewer.  The  highlight of the movie is definately the bad boy assassin played by the  extremely high impact Cassanova Wong, who takes your breath away with his  amaziing kicks and his fast but fluent styles. If you like Kung fu flix,  you have to have this one.",965088000,2,543,4.583333333333333
7892255,3,630558284X,"This is a good movie. It's worth watching more than a few times. It has good traing scences, wich is always motivating. You'll enjoy this one if you can put up with the annoyance of cassanova wong.",960249600,,197,4.351351351351352
