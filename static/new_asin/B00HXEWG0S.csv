6242653,5,B00HXEWG0S,"Well since the only review on here is a huffy rage one-starring a really decent movie they didn't even finish I'll try to provide another perspective. I fived it just to balance the score a bit, but it's not really a perfect movie, 4 out of 5 is probably closer if you put any stock in review ratings to begin with.

Just to quickly address a point that was brought up there is indeed reused animation from the original series, but you're bound not to notice most of it anyway, as it never breaks the flow of the new narrative, and is often even reworked a bit or put into clever or amusing new contexts. Overall the art and animation is exactly what you'd expect of this studio: gorgeous, top-notch stuff, and I'm really pumped that they are actually releasing this on Blu-ray.

SPOILERS AHEAD SPOILERS AHEAD

One of the most common complaints about this movie and the one that sent the other reviewer packing is that they've completely changed some of the characters. The thing is that this is done very purposefully as part of the central theme of the new story. This movie actually takes place in a parallel universe to the original series. Because of a brief glimpse into that world which occurred before the events of the movie, many of the main characters in the movie universe, who are in a bit of a dire predicament, end up following a legend based on that interaction in hopes that recreating the events that took place in the world of the original series will help solve their own problems. What they come to find out is that they have to stay true to their own unique lives and experiences and create their own legend, solve their own problems. Part of the reason the movie is so in your face about the changes to key characters is to drive this point home. It's really one of the most clever twists I've ever seen in terms of remaking a series into a movie. Unfortunately such an elaborate plot device relies a lot of talking head scenes which sort of hamper the pacing of the show, which is really probably my one and only complaint about the movie.

As a kind of aside I'm going to just say I thought the pedophilia jab at Dewey that was mentioned was actually a pretty dark and hilarious slight on his persona from the original series, where he had an army of utterly loyal children. Also Nirvash and the END in ""pokemon"" form are hilarious and adorable, so I really fail to see how that's a downside.

Overall it's a really enjoyable movie. It's a very well animated, fun and interesting new adventure with familiar faces and interesting new personalities. Easily the best series->movie adaptation/remake I've seen. Just go into it with an open mind and you'll probably enjoy it.",1259366400,44,2729,4.559183673469388
6242654,1,B00HXEWG0S,"I got a chance to see this movie at a special screening back in September. I really enjoyed the anime series and was looking forward to this adaptation. I knew going in that was a reimagining of the story, not a continuation. Still, I had high hopes. So believe me, my disappointment in the end result was all the more staggering. First off, and most egregiously, the movie reuses animation from the series, which is unacceptable. Even when they don't reuse footage, they cut corners by having far away and still shots with dialogue overlayed, so as to not have to spend money on animating the characters. Secondly, the new story is a total mess. I understand they wanted to take a new direction, but some of the choices for the characters are questionable at best, disgusting at worse. For instance, Dewey, the villain of the series, is now a pedophile who kidnapped the crew of the Gecko while they were still children for his own amusement. Huh? Really? And, oh yeah, Eureka? No longer an alien, but a robot. Yes. A robot. And Nirvash? Well, he was a little Pokemon-type creature that grew into a mecha. Seriously. And that's all just in the first half hour. All this and more, combined with the terrible english dubbing, made me walk out of a movie theater for the first time in my life. I highly doubt the ending, or any special blu-ray features, redeem it by any means. Even if you're a fan of the series - or ESPECIALLY if you're a fan of the series - I recommend avoiding this travesty at all costs.",1259107200,8,1507,4.5036496350364965
6242655,4,B00HXEWG0S,"I'll admit, when I first started watching this movie I was a little put aback. I knew it was a ""re-imagining"" of the entire series, but it still threw me for a loop. Even with that said, I still enjoyed the movie. I didn't compare it to the series in artwork or storyline, I didn't expect them to re-imagine the wheel or anything. Some of the characters became unrecognizable, but I think that was also some of the fun. They took time to mention ALMOST everyone from the series(I missed you Lady Sakuya). All in all, yes I'd much rather watch the series, but the movie tried to manage to re engineer the whole series in the span of hours where the anime had fifty episodes to do as it pleased.",1258848000,14,693,4.297709923664122

6242672,5,B00HXEWG0S,"This movie seems to get a lot of hate, and it seems to mostly be from people who don't pay attention to the plot. A lot of people assume this is supposed to be a recut of the show, similar to how Ghost in the ShellL Stand Alone Complex had the movies The Laughing Man, and The Individual Eleven, which are just 2 hr recuts of the first and second seasons, respectfully. This is NOT that. It isn't a reimaging of the series either as some seem to think. Now that you know what it isn't, I am going to tell you what it is.

During the original series, Dr. Bear and Norb have a discussion about the Scub Coral, The Great Wall, etc. During it they explain that beyond the Great Wall, is a small black hole (they don't call it that, but with a scientific understanding of what they are talking about, its obvious that is what they are describing) and within that black hole is a portal leading to another universe. The movie takes place in that universe. To make things simpler, they use the designs and character names from the original universe, but in some cases names are switched around, and for all the characters, their backstories are completely different, as are their personalities. This makes it confusing for some, especially if they don't pay attention and realize what is actual going on. During the movie, they show that during an experiment, the main characters got a glimpse of the original series universe, including the heart shaped stamp on the moon. The fact that they show the original universe during the movie should make it clear to anyone paying attention that this takes place in the alternate universe talked about during the original series. The story is completely unrelated to the original one, and the message in the story is completely different.

The original gave you the sense that love conquers all, and that you should stand up for what you believe in, no matter the odds. This story gives the message that you should be yourself, accept the things about you that you cannot change, and change the things that you can. The sequel series, Eureka Seven AO (which takes place in ANOTHER alternate universe, mentioned in the last episode of the original series) gives you the message that ideals aren't everything, and that nothings ever going to go exactly how you want, no situation is ever going to be perfect, but that's okay. You do what you can with the situation you are given.

Knowing what the movie is when you go to watch it makes it very enjoyable in my opinion. Bones Inc.'s ability to make an intricate multiverse, allowing them to weave multiple amazing stories, with powerful messages is outstanding. I think most will agree when you look at all of Eureka Seven as a whole (The original series, the movie, and the sequel series). While I am sure there will be some who don't like this movie, even if they do understand it, I still think it is worth watching for anyone who claims to be fan of Eureka Seven.",1419724800,3,2951,4.574669187145558

  O.K., good news, its a pretty good movie. You just have to forget everything that you came to know and love about the series.

But theres just one sad fact you cant ignore here: this just isn't a good movie.  I saw the show and I loved it, and this movie doesnt even hold a candle to it as far as the story goes.  I thought I was watching an alternate telling of Eureka Seven as written by a 9 year old.

But seriously, even though I strongly advise you not to spend your money on this, its still worth a watch if your a fan of the series.

6242687,1,B00HXEWG0S,"Whether or not you were a fan of the original series, you should avoid this movie if at all possible. While not total garbage, there will be the inevitable comparison to Psalms of Planets which is absolutely superior in every way imaginable. This film takes the ""alternate universe - alternate telling"" idea and uses it to justify throwing all of the elements of the original series in a blender and reducing them to pulp, then selling it to consumers thus profiting off of it's wonderful predecessor.

Let me start by saying what was good about the movie. The animation and visuals, while containing a large amount of stock footage from the series, was, for the most part above average. The use of stock footage is, in my opinion, forgivable considering the length of the original and the fact that it would be almost unnoticeable for anyone who hasn't seen the original. The music was also good, especially the song at the end credits that fit perfectly with the ending. Baby Nirivash was also kind of cute.

Other than that, the movie was pretty much a train wreck. The plot was puzzling to say the least. I expect to be confused and have to follow an ""alternate universe"" plot line especially carefully, but I'm not quite sure that the writers knew exactly what they wanted to do with this thing from the start. Without 50 episodes to get to know characters motivations and distinct personalities, it takes some storytelling skill to make them convincing to viewers, especially ones who have watched the original series. To make things even more challenging, in true ""bizzarro world"" fashion the writers decided to take two of the wisest and most lovable characters from the first series and turn them into the weakest and most cowardly, then reward them by killing them in the most ridiculous of ways.

While baby Niravash is cute as stated earlier, archetypes apparently don't go through puberty, because the adult version is annoying. The ending was pretty good as a sort of ""bizzaro"" version of the ending of the show, but it was far too little to late for this film to rescue it from the abyss. If you want to check out E7 watched the series and don't bother with this film. It can't hold a candle to the original and because of it's dependence on the original can't even stand up well on its own.",1393372800,14,2306,4.674876847290641
6242688,1,B00HXEWG0S,"Many anime films are just condensed retellings of an existing series. Studio Bones decided to do something different. I really wish they didn't.
I saw Eureka Seven The Movie in theaters a few years back, and I was looking forward to another great adventure with the cast of the series and was horribly disappointed. Set up as a ""Alternate Universe"", the film uses a lot of footage from the tv series, re-purposed. That alone is not a strike against it, and it can be very refreshing to see familiar characters interact in new situations free of established continuity, such as Young Justice.

Of what actual original animation that's in here is gorgeous and lush, however that's all I can say positively on this product.

That alone can't save it. The characters are wooden, one dimensional and in many cases made into wholly unlikable antagonists with a forgettable, rushed story that tries to poorly ape the themes and concepts laid out in the show. Not recommended for either fans of the series or beginners. Go watch the original series for a fun alternative giant robot show available on Blu Ray.",1390867200,23,1101,4.8201058201058204

I finished watching the 50th episode (which left a couple of things unanswered) and so I told myself ""Well perhaps the movie might answer a couple things?"" I was totally wrong.

The movie in itself revised the storyline completely, making Renton battle against Gekkostate as well as pretty much switching Renton's and Eureka's personalities (between them) for about half of the movie. This along with what many other reviewers have mentioned, which is the fact that they re-used many, MANY scenes from the series and overdubbed it with new script. They also rush greatly into the setting, giving the viewer about 5 to 10 minutes to assimilate every detail of what's going on, where in the series, you'd have a paced and developing environment building up until you reached the apex. In this movie, there were either no peaks, or they tried to make every scene a culminating and defining moment (depends on which review you look at). This is also reflected in the characters, where in the series it may take one or two episode for them to make a concrete decision (or you can at least see that there was some planning in the background). In this case, Hap and Stoner decide immediately that Holland (who they've been working with for 17 years) is not trustworthy and that they should act on their own.

I have to be honest; the only part in this movie that gave me the slightest satisfaction was seeing Hap getting crushed by the Nirvash after he and Stoner pretty much assault Eureka.

If you have absolutely nothing else to do, I might consider recommending this, but even then, it'd probably just ruin the end of the series for you. Please stay away.",1382745600,4,1745,4.711475409836066

Unlike the original series Eureka Seven: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers provides a slightly darker tone to the series with more mature content and a few more deaths. The movie alters characters some that were once likable to trash and those who were once antagonist are now wise-all-knowing characters. People familiar to the series will find this a bit off putting, but might spark interest in those were turned off by the original's slow story development and emotionally confused characters will find Eureka Seven: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers more likable.

Characters now have clear goals and more emotionally stable as this story doesn't emphasize as much on growth as the original series, but more on romance and the length our protagonist are willing to go for one another. Because of this view will get to see a greater sense of Renton and Eureka's love for one another as now quickly put words into action putting aside the drama that became before it in the original series.

Now i'm not going to sit here and claim that this film is perfection because there is a certain scene in the movie that didn't need

It's mentioned a number of times in this movie that the world is an alternate universe to 'another one' (guess which one).

END SPOILER

I think based on that context, the movie makes a bit more sense. Not everything is explained thoroughly, because it seems to be enough to state that it IS simply quite different from the TV series' plot. To what extent did this matter? I think it was just to give the characters we already know some different circumstances (pretty wild ones!) and see how they work in that environment. Perhaps even two hours wasn't enough for so much character exploration, but I think the point of the movie was to illustrate to what extent human beings can be understood. What matters in the end?

I watched this movie understanding and accepting that the characters would be compleatly new and unfamiliar to me, and that the story would most likely be drastically diffrent. Even with this prior knowledge I must say that I am dissapointed  with what the movie turned out to be. While I did in fact somewhat enjoy  the movie (for it would be a reasonable movie if standing on its own without the series behind it) I was upset by the overall character development and story. The characters seemed odd and unnatural, as if they were unccapable of emotion or higher level thinking. They did not have the spark that made them relatable or understandable to the viewers. Even Eureka and Renton were very flat characters, not growing in any manner. The story came off as very disconnected, it was very hard to comprehend what was going on and some of the explanations of what was happening were so vauge and abstract that you couldn't wrap your head around them. The animation was beautiful, but many scences and clips were recycled from the original series. All in all, it was somewhat enjoyable to watch, if not just to hear our faviorte characters have a voice again, but it does not compare to the series in any way, shape, or form. If you have watched the original series, you might enjoy this but don't be prepared to see anything spectacular that will add to the depth of the original, if you haven't seen the original series do yourself a favor and skip this movie.",1340323200,3,1638,4.625429553264605

so 4 stars if you never saw the (SERIES <which i recomend>)or 2 stars if you saw the series already.",1336780800,,1086,4.098591549295775

6242725,1,B00HXEWG0S,"This movie is NOT for any Eureka seveN fan, or for anyone who likes a good movie at all. Most of the scenes in here have been recycled from the anime. Literally taken from the TV show, the scenes were re-dubbed with new lines. For anyone who loved to see the relationship between the characters grow,  such as Eureka and Renton's love, will be heartbroken and dumbfounded! Eureka is now a ""Spy robot"" and the crew of the gekko are a bunch of kids who do what they want "" just because"". That's right their motivation in this movie is ""because we saw an image of a different dimension, we want to go there because we feel the government screwed us over and we don't care about killing anyone who gets in our way - even if it is the person who is required to get us there"". Yup, if they kill Eureka they won't be able to get to where they are going, yet they try to in a scene of the movie. Make sense? I think not! This movie takes your characters that you know and love and turn them into the opposite of what you would expect, but this time not in a good way. I was in shock to see characters such as Stoner and Happ act like fools jumping to conclusions even though they were supposed to be the same characters just in a different, parallel dimension.

This movie is a recycled piece of garbage and should not be owned by anyone. The scenes are recycled from the anime, the characters make you want to cry "" oh what have they done to you"" ( even some of the voice actors in here had a tone in their voice of "" is my character REALLY saying this crap?"" ). This really feels like a studio who had not nearly enough time to create this movie and cobbled together a storyline written by middle schoolers. I do not recommend to anyone. In fact, this is an abomination to the Eureka seveN community and should not be sold anywhere. This is not even worth the disk the digital material is printed on!",1306886400,8,1894,4.186301369863013
6242726,5,B00HXEWG0S,"I just watch it yesterday and it was a Great movie! If you seen the series don't expect this to be the continuation of the 5oth ep or the side story. This is a remake or re re-imagination the story with a lot of twist in the story short of similar to Escaflowne the movie!
3 years after Eureka Seven TV series end, Bones released Eureka Seven - Pocket Full Of Rainbows (a.k.a Eureka Seven the movie) with a new concept and storyline. I just finished watching it not long ago and it is a great movie! As a great fan of Eureka Seven, I have decided to write a short review and share some of my thoughts. Since it is based on a new concept and storyline, it is very different from the TV series. The whole story mostly focus on the interaction between Eureka and Renton, where they know each other since childhood, how they were separated, meet each other again and fall in love. There isn't much footage and appearance for the sub characters, so fans of them might be disappointedUnlike the TV series, the movie don't have much friendly interaction between Gekko State and Renton & Eureka but instead you get to see a lot of negative emotions, especially anger, doubt and desperation. If you watched the TV series, you will be shocked by how they changed some of the characters' personality. The storyline and concept is okay, but I can't really understand the 4th quarter of the movie. If you watched the movie, hopefully we can exchange some thoughts about it. Things I like about this movie
Fans of Eureka will be really happy for this (me too!). TV series portray Eureka as a girl that doesn't know how to show emotions, but in the movie, Eureka becomes a lovely and sentimental girl. There are a lot of lovely scenes between Eureka and Renton, which makes her cute, naturally. She even has a new long hair look in the movie!!! In otaku term, The movie is great, but I would advise Eureka Seven's fans to watch it as an alternative story instead of relating it with the TV series. There are a few parts that disappoints me , like ""borrowing"" the battle footage from the TV series, and movie's picture quality wasn't as good compared with others. But overall, I enjoyed the movie. The dubbed is here and the motion of the ending was great.

So beware if your a Die hard Eureka 7 fan and think this is going to be a continuation or side story, better think again. But It a very nice movie to watch and enjoy.",1305590400,,2408,4.4112359550561795

This movie is the worst thing i have ever sat through in my life. The story is so rushed and has sense whatsoever. The characters are just completly flipped upside down and ruined. 80% of the movie is just lazily reused scenes form the original series. I cant believe Bandai ever made something like this. It would make sense if this was made from some random third party production company so they can make money off of the fans, but i am surprised Bandai passed this as a good idea. I would've loved if this was a continuation or even a spin off story, but no, its nothing but taking everyone people loved of the series and kicking it in the face. If you love the series, please, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!! I felt SO SO betrayed by this movie.

6242728,1,B00HXEWG0S,"I Really, Really enjoyed the series when I was 11-12 I saw it on TV and I always loved it. I never finished the series in that part of my life but I did when i finally was 16 I kept feeling my brain stop and my heart enjoying the story I was watching. I watched it all in a depression which probably made even more enjoyable to watch the series. I watched all 50 episodes in a matter of days and after that I thought I would finish off with this movie. No, that was wrong of me i should have kept that movie in its box. I will try to forget this movie as it ruined my love for the romance in the series it just created a whole new complex oddity I didn't wish to see. I wanted to see something that would make me depressed in a happy way not an angry way. It was a waste of my time and I hate myself for watching it. Now I will probably watch the series again just to break this movie away from my mind it was so different and my mind feels like a boundless white room that's how open minded I feel but not during this movie it made me sad and angry.

For those who watched the series this might do the same to you make you angry. For some it might possibly make you happy, it is all in the persons we are.
For those who haven't watched the series I have no words for you except please do and then ask yourself if everything in this series was flipped upside down and turned in random order but Eureka and Renton still loved each other in a whole different story would it effect me.

I don't write reviews usually because I never wish to make my hate or love known because it could compose a strain of hate on myself but this was truly not a joy to me and I hope all who watch it enjoy it more than I did.",1282694400,9,1705,3.8825214899713467

6242742,2,B00HXEWG0S,"First, as most reviews have stated, this movie is a complete deviation from the original series. However, even with that pre-text in mind, this 117min showing cannot be seen as anything more than a corprate attempt to withdraw more money from consumer pockets.  The movie combines an extensive amount of clips from the series to fill all sorts difficult battle sequences.  That alone is a complete insult to anyone whose bothered to watch the actual series.  Now as to anyone who would ignore this blatent laziness, or to those who have never bothered to watch the anime,  I will explain why this is not a movie for you.  As you may have read other posts, I must strongly agree to the fact that this movie does a horrible job of giving the viewer time to grasp the situation.  While it is a new story, it seems as though they expect you to know several key elements that weren't explained. For instance, what IS an LFO?  What exactly is the crazy-green air/water that is being ""surfed"" on? And what is this Pokemon doing in Eureka 7? Even the relationship between Eureka and Renton was extremely rushed and unbelievable.  So two children well under teen years experienced something similar to love and automatically fall into said obvious relationship once reunited?  The entire movie doesn't go down easy, and leaves you dreaming of a simple extension of the series. ( i.e. Conqueror of Shambala).  All reviews of 5 stars are definitely gracious people.  For I am a 110%  fan of the series, and even shed some tears with the characters.

As far as the plot is concerned, it probably would've been more interesting as it's own story, rather than a re-imagining of an existing series, but it still manages to be different enough to keep the viewer watching. The parts where footage is recycled are pretty apparent if you ever watched the series, but the way they're reused is creative enough where it's forgivable.

One last thing to note is the extra features contains about an hour long interview with the production team, which certainly helps explain the labor of love that went into making this project a reality. Recommended if you're a fan of Studio BONES works.",1270857600,,900,4.726114649681529

Unfortunately, a scene or line or plot device relies on its integration into the larger work to be effective, and the movie as a whole simply isn't solid story-telling.

6242749,5,B00HXEWG0S,"""Eureka SeveN"", the popular mecha anime TV series from anime studio, Bones, has spawned several video games, novels and now a movie.  What began as an animated series was then quickly adapted into a manga series which ran in Kadokawa Shoten's ""Monthly Shonen Ace"" from 2005-2006 with a total of 23 chapters.

The anime series was a big hit in the US airing on the Cartoon Network's ""Adult Swim"" and in 2009, ""Eureka SeveN: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers"" was released in theaters during Golden Week and fans of the series would get a chance to see a new re-imagining of the characters for the film version.  Director Tomoki Kyoda (""Eureka Seven"" TV Series, ""RahXephon"", ""Skull Man"", ""Ouran High School Host Club"") wanted to make a film for those who never read the manga and never watched the anime series.  So, literally a film that would be brand new for anyone watching it.

VIDEO:

""Eureka SeveN: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers"" is a Bones production that looks awesome on Blu-ray.  Featured in 1080p High Definition, the detail on the painted backgrounds are well-done and contain a lot of detail.

Fans of the manga and anime series should be happy with the character designs by Kenichi Yoshida (""Overman King Gainer"", ""Cowboy Bebop: The Movie"", ""Eureka Seven"" TV series) and the mechanical designs by Hiroyuki Yanagise (""Sakura Diaries"", ""Death Note"").

The battle sequences look fluid in animation and Bones did not skimp on details as they had a lot of key animators and in-between animators working on this film.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Eureka SeveN: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers"" is featured in Japanese and English Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  I have to say that I was pleased by the lossless soundtrack.  Because of the amount of action in the film, there was great use of surround usage for explosions, weapons being shot out and hearing it pan from left to right.  Good use of LFE for booms and for the most part, crystal clear audio coming from the front and center channels. Dialogue and the music by Naoki Sato (composer for ""Heroic Age"", ""Mouse"", ""Sword of the Stranger"") sounds very beautiful in HD.

As for the dub, this is about preference and the good news is that you get both Japanese and English lossless soundtracks.  I watched the English dub at the theater and once again on Blu-ray but also watched the film in Japanese to see if there were any audio differences and for the most part, action special effects and music were both fantastic on both soundtracks.  I did enjoy the more emotional voice acting from the Japanese lossless track but again, its all about preference and fortunately you get both lossless soundtracks.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

My first exposure to ""Eureka SeveN"" was actually from this film.  I have seen bits and pieces on television but I missed way too many episodes to comprehend what was going on and thus I passed.

But since the first screening of the film, I started to get acquainted with the manga and anime series and for the most part, my enjoyment of the film is what made me want to learn more about it.

I know with most people watching the film, they have some major knowledge of the TV and manga series but when I watched this film with a few friends who were also not familiar with the world of ""Eureka SeveN"", we enjoyed it.  Now knowing the differences between the characters of the film and the manga/anime series, personally I feel that this movie is easily accessible for those not familiar with the series and that's good thing.

As for those who are fans, like any anime that is re-imagined and different from the original, I can understand if there are fans who are not appreciative of the changes and I'm sure there are those who are open to seeing what director Tomoki Kyoda and Bones had in store for the audience.  But I can tell you that watching the film on Blu-ray definitely made things more exciting as I had the opportunity to test out the lossless audio and just be in awe of how immersive the soundscape was.

Bandai Entertainment did a magnificent job in the lossless audio treatment of this film.  Also, the picture quality was definitely great to see in 1080p HD and I was happy to see the 50-minute making-of Japanese special feature (with English subtitles) included.  But to my surprise, after the theatrical screening of ""Eureka SeveN: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers"", there was a 25-minute featuring the English dub voice talent that is not included on this Blu-ray.  In a way, it's a shame because that featurette was hilarious and fun!  I'm surprised it was not included at all.  It would have been an excellent addition to the Blu-ray release and definitely would have made it a pretty complete release.

Overall, for those who are familiar with the series may have quite a bit to talk about in terms of differences and their own opinions of the film.  But coming from a guy who watched the film along with his friends (who don't watch much anime) and didn't know too much about the manga and anime series at the time, the three of us enjoyed the film.  And as for the Blu-ray, Bandai Entertainment did a wonderful job in giving us a Blu-ray release with both lossless soundtracks and a beautiful animated film in HD.  The film has romance, action and all-out mecha battles.  Sci-fi/mecha anime fans will definitely find something to enjoy about this film.

With a strong March week of anime on Blu-ray releases, ""Eureka SeveN: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers"" definitely stands out amongst the many anime titles available now on Blu-ray released in the US.

Definitely recommended!",1268179200,,6723,4.810104529616725
6242750,2,B00HXEWG0S,"As has been said in other reviews, I believe that the BONES team attempted to crowbar too much story into too little time, and because of that I think the story lacked the heart of the original series.  There are a lot of things about the film that are awkward for viewers who know the original story, such as the recasting of characters, recycling of old footage, the simultaneous connection/disconnection between the film and original series.  Consequently, I spent the majority of the film trying to get past these issues instead of being able to enjoy the film for what it was.  If there were more time to adjust to these changes by perhaps creating a two-part film or a short mini-series instead of a single feature-length film, these issues may not have been a problem for me.  On the positive side, Naoki Sato has composed a completely new score for this film that lives up to his previous work.",1267747200,2,902,4.61875
6242751,5,B00HXEWG0S,"This is going to be a fairly short review because I've only seen the movie twice in Japanese and that was a year ago. THIS REVIEW MIGHT ALSO CONTAIN SPOILERS SO BE AWARE.

Anyways, this was an amazing movie. People complain about how it was confusing and didn't relate to the series at all, but that is what usually happens in a story with a new mythos. The movie takes place in an alternate reality of the Eureka Seven world and a lot is the same yet different. There are no Coralians, but the Image, robots that are planning on destroying humanity.

The whole driving force of the movie is connected to the main series though, so don't believe the main series has nothing to do with what is going on. This movie also touches more on the relationship between Renton and Eureka than in the show which is pretty amazing considering the show was all about their love. The movie will also leave you more content with the ending than the series, but then again is also very tear-jerking.

If you were looking for answers for the show in this movie, you won't find much. Rather it leaves you wanting more of an explanation.",1266710400,2,1118,4.443902439024391

SPOILER ALERT

this movie is incredibly complicated to understand and stick with, however i'll do my best to walk you through it. basically its in an alternate universe and many of the characters are dramatically changed. holland actually becomes the antagonist later on in fact. if you were true to the original series, you will have mixed results about the movie. The story is very hard to follow as you cant tell whether the world they live in is an alternate universe, or a dream world. the characters are changed as stated, and they resorted to using many scenes from the original series to fill in gaps rather than make new animations. nirvash flying around like a pokemon also lost my respect for the movie as it turned a serious drama/action anime into a pokemon show. i will not spoil the ending, however it should be noted that although the twist is good, the ending left me unsatisfied and clueless. renton is better in this movie however because he's more of a determined hero then a child.

i liked the original series and if you liked it go ahead and try to get this movie, or rent it perhaps, but be warned that this not Eureka 7 but a totally different entity with the same characters but a completely different story.",1266364800,,1317,4.595744680851064

6242755,5,B00HXEWG0S,"I went to the one night showing a few months ago and I can describe the 2.5 hours I spent in that theater as heaven. I will admit that I am biased as I am a huge fan of the anime and have watched it through several times. But I don't hate it that they changed so many things, in fact I think it helped a greater underlining message under the story.
From this point I will talk about the movie so SPOILER WARNING!!
The point I'm talking about is that even if the entire world changed around them Eureka and Renton would still fall in love all over again. I think that's more important than the changes themselves (Love conquers all!). Anyway I would like to counter a few of the things some people pointed out in other reviews I have read. First the issue of Dewey being a pedo... If you've watched the show you would have noticed that they have implied this and that this movie only confirms it! Besides because he doesn't even 'physically' show up in the movie, this just keeps him under his old villain role. Second, Nirvash and The End becoming 'Pokmon' creatures. All anime have a cute character, in the series this was Anemone's pet Gulliver, but he's gone now so now we have a two foot tall Nirvash. I liked how the series had you thinking Nirvash as just a really powerful mech till the end, when it was revealed that 'she' was actually a living being and even sentient. So I think this version actually keeps very true to Nirvash as a character. Speaking of character, yes most if not all the character's had fundamental differences between themselves in the series and the movie. But think... would you be slightly different too if you had a life different like the one you have now? I believe that the characters showed that they were the same people deep down to the soul, but because of their lives they had slightly different views on the world and how to act. Finally people complain that the plot was hard to follow and went at a strange pace. I believe that if you pick up a book at your local library and read instead of twittering all the time you would easily be able to understand the story. As for the pace, the movie has a more lifelike pace I believe; it's full of slow deep personal scenes with quick and dire scenes of violence. I think this is more real in how the characters are experiencing the events they are facing. Now I'll talk about the things that irked me a little. Them reusing scenes from the show was a little disappointing but they weren't exactly the same and looked better than their original versions so I was able to overlook that. Eureka calling herself a ""spy robot"" (rolls off the tongue quite well :p) was a little weird and didn't fit right with the Eureka Seven mythos.
END OF SPOILERS. So I believe this movie has much more then what meets the eye. I believe I will be watching this for many years into the future and I hope I can share it with my children like how my mother shared her favorite childhood book with me.",1260144000,6,2970,4.353153153153153

6242757,1,B00HXEWG0S,"I'm a HUGE fan of ""RahXephon"". I don't think it's the best anime out there, but it's by far the one I love the most. I'm saying this because watching ""Good Night Sleep Tight Young Lovers"" on the big screen in September reminded me of the revolting experience of watching Xephon's own ""re-imagining"" movie ""Pluralitas Concentio"". But the Eureka movie is even more abominable, since it doesn't just change details, but almost everything, and I could honestly see no reason to even keep the names of the characters.

I have to admit I couldn't finish the original ""Eureka Seven"". Something just prevented me from caring enough for the story, so I dropped it around Episode 20. But for all its flaws, the show has potential (and maybe even realizes it further on in the series) and a logical plot. It wasn't engaging for me, but I don't think it's bad. The movie however has no logic whatsoever. It re-uses a lot of the original footage in a VERY illogical way, changes almost everything there is to change, AND ADDS POKEMON-LIKE CREATURES WITH ""KYUKCHU"" LINES!!! Seriously, I loved the ""Kaway Aliens"" from Excel Saga, but Excel is a *beeping* parody! And if anything, GNSTYL is dramatically devoid of ANY humor whatsoever.

To be perfectly honest, the only thing of worth about this movie is the making featurete, where the actor dubbing Renton cracks some pretty cool jokes.

So, in a nutshell, this is one of those completely pointless and obviously sad movies which you feel kinda embarrassed to have seen. DO AVOID PLEASE.",1259366400,5,1523,4.805343511450381
6242758,5,B00HXEWG0S,"Figured I'd write up a review since it got such initial negative feedback and an undercooked one-star rating. Just to quickly address a point that was brought up there is indeed reused animation from the original series, but you're bound not to notice most of it anyway, as it never breaks the flow of the new narrative, and is often even reworked a bit or put into clever or amusing new contexts. Overall the art and animation is exactly what you'd expect of this studio: gorgeous, top-notch stuff, and I'm really pumped that they are actually releasing this on Blu-ray.

One of the most common complaints about this movie and the one that sent the first reviewer packing is that they've completely changed some of the characters. The thing is that this is done very purposefully as part of the central theme of the new story. This movie actually takes place in a parallel universe to the original series. Because of a brief glimpse into that world which occurred before the events of the movie, many of the main characters in the movie universe, who are in a bit of a dire predicament, end up following a legend based on that interaction in hopes that recreating the events that took place in the world of the original series will help solve their own problems. What they come to find out is that they have to stay true to their own unique lives and experiences and create their own legend, solve their own problems. Part of the reason the movie is so in your face about the changes to key characters is to drive this point home. It's really one of the most clever twists I've ever seen in terms of remaking a series into a movie. Unfortunately such an elaborate plot device relies a lot of talking head scenes which sort of hamper the pacing of the show, which is really probably my one and only complaint about the movie.

As a kind of aside I'm going to just say I thought the pedophilia jab at Dewey that was mentioned was actually a pretty dark and hilarious slight on his persona from the original series, where he had an army of utterly loyal children. Also Nirvash and the END in ""pokemon"" form are hilarious and adorable, so I really fail to see how that's a downside.

Overall it's a really enjoyable movie. It's a very well animated, fun and interesting new adventure with familiar faces and interesting new personalities. Easily the best series->movie adaptation/remake I've seen. Just go into it with an open mind and you'll probably enjoy it.",1259366400,,2522,4.633109619686801

8637144,4,B00HXEWG0S,"The movie itself is decent, but do keep in mind that it is not related to the show, but also keep in mind that the movie does not make sense if you haven't seen the show.
Yeah a bit of a paradox, but I would say that if you are fan you should check it out. It's a real flip on the original script. When I watched it for the first time it really through me for a loop, for I thought it was related to the show, but found out real quick that it wasn't.
Check it out if you want, but if you don't you aren't missing anything.",1517270400,,522,3.7545454545454544
8637145,2,B00HXEWG0S,"This movie made hardly any sense. Understand that it's supposed to be a completely alternate universe but with the same characters and a different plot, which also doesn't make much sense. If you've watched the two series, Eureka Seven and Eureka Seven: AO, I recommend not watching this unless you really want one heck of a mind twist!",1506211200,,336,4.810344827586207
8637146,4,B00HXEWG0S,The movies a little odd.. okay a lot of odd compared to the show. If you watch this you'll seemly be completely confused. I had to read a bunch of explainations about it just to understand what went on but overall it was decent experience,1489622400,3,238,4.311111111111111

8637148,4,B00HXEWG0S,"Kind of rewrites the series, but if you take it as an alternate timeline it's OK. You have to watch this before AO (pronounced Ow like you hurt yourself). There are references to the ending of this movie in AO.",1483488000,2,210,4.275
8637149,3,B00HXEWG0S,"The story wasn't really what I would expect from an Eureka 7 movie, and I wish they(the writers) would have stuck with the universe they had originally, instead of going alternate universe on us,  but the art quality is nice at least. Characters feel shoehorned in out of a lazy attempt for fanservice, and the alternate universe situation only ends up asking more questions while answering none of the questions you may have had from the series.",1472688000,,446,4.792207792207792

Eureka Seven was one of the very first anime I ever watched and I instantly was addicted to the characters in the story. So I just had to see the movie as well. Audio quality was good and it had both English and Japanese versions as well. All in all it is a wonderful purchase if you love anime and especially if you loved Eureka Seven.",1459382400,,441,3.966292134831461
