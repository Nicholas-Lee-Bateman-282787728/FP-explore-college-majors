8305901,1,B001GLLNMQ,This is a classic piece of political propeganda. It would take another movie to debunk all the lies in this movie.,1434758400,,114,4.476190476190476
8305902,5,B001GLLNMQ,I purchased the item for a friend of mine and my friend loved it and said that is very satisfied,1362441600,,96,3.85
8305903,5,B001GLLNMQ,Got this for my husband.  Arrived fast and packaged well.  Don't know what else to say about a DVD.  I didn't watch it.,1359417600,,119,4.086956521739131
8305904,5,B001GLLNMQ,"It's a wonder he got elected. Strong examination of the life of Obama and how he hyped his way into The White House. Were the voters that much asleep? Or did we have a choice? Seeing that this is the President of the United States, and the documentary exposes his record and could influence the next 4 years, you've got to ask yourself one question. Why would I take a chance and vote for him again? Take a look this first. You won't be disappointed.",1332633600,4,450,4.305882352941176
8305905,1,B001GLLNMQ,"We were watching the DVD and about 40 minutes into it, it came to an untimely demise...... ending where it shouldnt have ended.  so I wasted my money on it......",1227571200,4,161,4.366666666666666
8305906,1,B001GLLNMQ,"I was leaning towards a vote for Obama, but wanted to see what this video had to say. I did not purchase it, it was given to me by a McCain follower. I was very interested in what it had to say, and it made me nervous about Obama. Before I believed any of it, I did some research online checking into his voting record. After spending hours looking through Obama's voting record, I came across many votes that totally discredit what the video says. For instance, when they say he voted against English as the official language of the US, that is a complete lie. Look it up. He voted for English to be the official language...109th Congress, vote#132 on 5/18/06. Don't believe this video, it's nothing but lies.",1225670400,10,710,4.469230769230769
8305907,5,B001GLLNMQ,"All I have to say is ""Wow.""  Very compelling.  There are too many unanswered questions surrounding Obama, too many questionable associations.  This video does a thorough search into Obama's past  (although it's very difficult because this man has left no paper trail -- despite years at Columbia and Harvard no one can find a single paper he has written?!?!) and really exposes Obama's poor judgment in who he surrounds himself with.

A must-watch for anyone who thinks Obama is going to solve this country's problems.",1225238400,22,518,5.047058823529412
