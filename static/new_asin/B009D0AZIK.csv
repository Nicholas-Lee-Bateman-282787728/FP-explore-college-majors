This movie is not for young children due to violence and some gross out moments.",1349222400,4,293,4.76

5317059,2,B009D0AZIK,"It starts off good.  The acting is surprisingly good.  The main character is fine, ex-commando turn hippy guy.  Pasty white super-skinny Native American/ Indian guy, awesome funny.  The ""wife of dead beat druggie"" character, good no problem,  even the bad guys do a decent acting job.  All was fine...right up until the drug dealer bad guy is murdering the crooked sheriff  while jerking off and ""finishes"" on the sheriff's face.  Honest ! Im not even making that up.  What the hell.?!?!

From there the movie takes a bizarre turn and becomes bad guys from road warriors -cannibals -whatever  chasing good guys who continually lose their guns.  Hopeless druggie who the good guys are trying to save gets mauled to death by a dog who somehow manages to bite both his skull and rib cage in half , the bad guys cook and eat the sheriff, the good guys run through the desert CARRYING the victim wife chick and somehow still outrun the gang of cannibal, road warrior-esque , meth heads.  The movie continues to go down hill from there.

I don't know what happened. Where they decided to take a turn from tongue in cheek action movie into grind house bizarro  WTF land,  but it became unwatchable.  Which is a shame because the actors are good and the first 30 minutes were good.",1425945600,,1273,4.63677130044843

5317071,2,B009D0AZIK,"It had some likeable elements...but, I really got the sense I was watching a film by a somewhat competent film student as opposed to a movie. The three main characters were pretty good and likeable. I found Jack the most likeable as the stoic bad guy who is trying to redeem himself in his new life. The guy who dressed up as an Indian was likeable and pretty funny, though, at a certain point I found the way the director portrayed him a little over the top and distracting from the film. I know the film is meant to be tongue and cheek but I don't think the director struck a very good balance between campy and serious. He just didn't quite hit it. It's like he was trying to be 'John Dies at the End' or a 'Bottle Rocket' but then was trying to be Quentin Tarrentino. It just didn't work. I can appreciate the writer/director trying to attempt a style but I just felt more like it was an imbalanced, poor rip-off.

Amber Benson played her typical character that is likeable. I felt the director could have stretched her into something else. Her character is living in the middle of nowhere in the desert, but the interior of her home is a very nicely put together artist home...but they're poor and her husband is a crack addict? Where did they get the money to have a cute interior? How does an artist type end up in the middle of the desert with a crack addict? It doesn't make sense, which pulls you out of the movie plus left me wondering, who is her character. They never bothered to explain it. The only back story or explanation they gave was for Jack and I think they could have handled the flashbacks better, which were kind of cheap looking and looked more like they were filmed in Joshua Tree than Iraq.

The camera work was mediocre. Could have used more closeups when the emotions of the characters called for it. The music worked pretty well. I don't really have any comment further than that since I shut it off halfway through since I figured my time would be better spent rewatching 'John Dies at the End' or 'Reservoir Dogs,' which are better examples of what the writer/director seems to be trying to achieve. I think he probably could get better with time but seems like it would have been better and more cost effective to do a short film instead.",1415836800,,2272,4.4071428571428575

5317077,5,B009D0AZIK,"Dust Up! delivers raucous humor and balls-to-the-walls story-telling that studio films don't have the kahunas to try.

The story is relatively simple:

A one-eyed former vigilante turned pacifist/desert handyman must summon his inner commando to rescue a young mother and her meth-addict husband from a cannibalistic drug lord.

Its the execution and blend of story/character/music/violence/humor that makes this exploitation film so damn funny. Everything from the opening credit sequence to the exploding bar and the desert dance-off smacks of Tarantino on a tight budget.

This film takes characters youve seen before  the eye-patched warrior (a combination of Billy Jack and Kill Bill femme-assassin Elle Driver), the even-keeled, arrow slinging sidekick (Tonto of course, but played much more coolly by Devin Barry as Mo), and the out-of-control ultra-violent drug lord (name any memorable film where the bad guy was so awesome you loved to hate him, add some outrageous antics and youve got Jeremiah Birketts Buzz). Toss in an attractive damsel in distress (Buffy the Vampire Slayers Amber Benson) victimized by her husbands ineptitude and an adorable wide-eyed baby (Director Ward Roberts daughter Bo)  and theres a lot to like and laugh about.

Even more impressive is that Writer/Director/Producer Ward Roberts pulled this all off on a micro-budget.

A great job all around, and a fun time to be had by all who dare to venture into the off-kilter mind of Mr. Roberts. Special kudos to Aaron Gaffney (who plays the protagonist one-eyed soldier Jack) and Jeremiah Birkett (the afore-mentioned despicable villain with a maniacal laugh).",1411689600,,1642,5.411764705882353

Yes, some of the characters do a borderline decent job at acting, but this fell very short of my expectations. The saving grace of the film came in the form of the lead character; other than than, save yourself an hour and a half, a slew of terrible jokes, and the same repetitive nonsense for the duration of the film.

5317085,2,B009D0AZIK,"Silly action comedy about a one-eyed war vet who lives in the desert and comes to the aid of a pretty mom and her drug-addled husband who runs afoul of some violent baddies.  This is a B movie somewhat in the spirit of the Machete films but with a much lower budget, less camp and more actual gags.  The first half is silly and enjoyable, but the movie gets away from writer/director Ward Roberts in the second half.

The point when the movie goes from amusing to ick occurs when one of the characters ejaculates violently all over another character while he strangles him.  The rest of the movie is more sour than funny with the exception of one goofy scene where several of the characters engage in an Indian war dance.

Amber Benson gets top billing but is fourth lead at best and isn't used particularly well after the opening scenes.  She's every bit as charming as she was in her days on Buffy the Vampire Slayer but the movie uses her mostly as a passive victim in the second half, which isn't really much fun.  The rest of the no-name cast is good enough for the material.

It's a shame Dust Up turns so crude and ugly in the second half but people who get a kick out of tasteless low-budget comedies will probably enjoy this more than I did.",1396137600,5,1250,4.357758620689655

With the aid of his Native American ally Mo, Jack sets out to clean up the trash that has taken over his small town. DUST UP takes us on a wild ride through the desert with a likable cast of crazy characters that will have you hooked from the very beginning! It takes its roots from the same brand of exploitative action films as many of Quentin Tarantino's pictures, but without the pretentious, self-indulgent overtones. Ward Roberts brings an excitement and enthusiasm behind the camera that is reflected in each of his actors. Aaron Gaffey falls right into place as our stern, no nonsense hero Jack, kicking ass and taking names with Devin Barry by his side as the wisecracking Mo. The desert goons led by Jeremiah Birkett's whacked out drug lord, Buzz, are no less entertaining with their eccentric, off-the-wall performances. Roberts keeps the action coming at a fast pace, but after a slight lull in the second act, things pick up again in the explosive finale. Fans of exploitation classics like BONNIE'S KIDS and THRILLER: A CRUEL PICTURE, it's time to kick up some dust!

But when he encounters a beautiful young mother in deep trouble with a cannibalistic drug lord and his evil goons, he realizes that justice must be served.  Teamed up with his smooth-talking Native American hipster sidekick, our hero rides into the badass brawl of the century.""
  Actually, Walking Stick was the best character, although he managed to get beaten up pretty well in the final mayhem.

Oh, did I mention gratuitous violence?  Then, there are some really disgusting naked butts.  This is, of course, followed by a ritual revenge slaughter of the bad folks.
  Features multitudinous drug crazed characters that it would be a public service to crush under your shoe.

- The Music and how it flowed with the plot was outstanding. Gotta get me some spindrift

Lacking:
- The lead lady and her man lacked feeling, and it was hard to really get into feeling emotional for their ""hardships."" It was a hard sell on seeing why anyone would help them out.

- The plot flow could have been better. I had trouble buying into the plot at times. Yes, it was supposed to be cheesy and campy. I just believe it could have kept my interest better.

Here's a future hint....maybe watch the trailer ahead of time. It's kind of amazing how often you get a feeling if that is the kind of Movie that might interest you. Its a crazy technological feature that's been around for like 60yrs+.

If you took the time to watch the Trailer, maybe took a look at the Cover Art and notice the 'fake dated film lines' in the 1st 2 minutes of the Movie, you'd quickly realize this a Grindhouse Movie. And easily one of the better ones made since the Revival.

A quick education, since its obvious most watching this on Amazon are unaware what,a Grindhouse Movie is. Originally you find these movies usually dating to the 1970's They usually worked with lower budgets, contained sub-par scripts,mediocre acting and sometimes just flat out ridiculous Story premises.. These were often played as late night Drive-In Theaters Double Features and then later on as Midnight Showings.

Though not the only ones to start the Revival, in 2007 Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez released 2 Films ,Death Proof & Planet Terror. Both of these movies PURPOSELY paid homage to the genre by utilizing poor editing skills,corny dialogue, illogical plot lines and over the Top Cartoonish Gore to create ""Bad"" Films....but incredibly AWESOME Bad Films.""DUST UP"" is an incredibly awesome Bad Film.

Its everything you want in a Grindhouse flick: The Troubled War Veteran w/ an Eye Patch and a Heart of Gold,his Jewish Native American Sidekick (ESPECIALLY well played w/ Deadpan Humor), a Lizard Man Heavy and a Desert Island Drug Lord that talks Ravers into being his Cannibalistic Goon squad...that is until the Drugs where off at the crack of down and they are all strung out wanting go home:)
