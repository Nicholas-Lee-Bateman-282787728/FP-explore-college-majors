4906518,5,B005Z2D88O,"I had the good fortune to see this documentary during its too short run on the big screen. It's one of the very best and memorable (heartbreaking at times) depictions of lions I've ever seen (and I own virtually every documentary on lions ever made). I've also been privileged to personally visit the location of this film, Duba Plains, and watch these extraordinary lions hunt buffalo. This film haunted me for weeks afterwards and is so much better than the happy-go-lucky approach of Disneynature's African Cats. I'm very pleased to now own the DVD of The Last Lions.

Since last January, National Geographic has donated 10 cents every time the official trailer for this film is watched on YouTube (up to a million views; $100,000). In a year, less than 350,000 have viewed the trailer so only a third of the possible money has been designated. In a day when silly videos go viral and quickly get millions of views, it is tragic and an indictment on the human race that so few people care enough to save these magnificent creatures to spend a couple of minutes watching the trailer. Do your part and watch it at least once daily until the goal of one million views is reached - [...]",1326067200,2,1186,4.62085308056872
4906519,5,B005Z2D88O,"Other reviews have correctly summed up the story line.  As a nature film lover, I have seen hundreds of productions.  This film, however, stands heads above the rest in its production value.  It is, quite simply, the most beautifully filmed nature film I have ever seen.

The continuity between the various scenes, the multiple angles achieved, as well as the composition of the scenes themselves were breath-taking.  You literally feel yourself a part of the story and the action.  The narration by Jeremy Irons was also very well done.  The result is a truly amazing achievement.

The rapid extinction of the African lions is in itself a tragedy, but National Geographic Society is raising funds to help stem the tide of the lion population's collapse through their ""Big Cat Initiative"".  After you have seen the film, please give to this great project.  Learn more at [...]",1325980800,4,876,4.938356164383562
4906520,5,B005Z2D88O,Never before has a film given me tears of sadness and tears of happiness in one hit! This film is ingeniously made and certainly not your stereotypical documentary film. This has straight in at the top of favorite films! I would recommend to anyone!,1325894400,2,249,4.681818181818182
4906521,5,B005Z2D88O,"A simply gorgeous and remarkable documentary about a lone lioness trying to survive and raise her cubs.  Why she was not part of a pride of lions at the beginning of the story is never explained, but she is expelled  from her territory by a large and aggressive pride, and must go to a island inside a river teaming with crocodiles, hippos, water buffalo, and other dangerous animals.

I don't want to ""give away"" the plot...this documentary DOES have a plot and one as riveting as any really good movie could be.  Filmed by the husband and wife team of wildlife filmmakers, the Jouberts, scenes of real life in Africa unroll with beauty, cruelty, and intensity.  As always, their documentaries seem to ""get"" the feel of wild Africa as if they were part of it, living and experiencing it.

I would not recommend it for young or very sensitive children/adults since the brutality of the real-life world of lions trying to survive is nothing like a Disney movie....but the ""main character"", the lone lioness, is one you will remember long after seeing this top quality documentary.

The background music, African in nature, is lovely, and Jeremy Irons does a good job narrating.  I truly can't believe this was not up for some documentary award, it is, in my opinion, that worthwhile and well done.

Highly recommended as are any of the Jouberts' films for National Geographic.",1324598400,35,1375,4.7923728813559325
4906522,3,B005Z2D88O,"Mutual of Omaha did a video on the swimming lions of Botswana back in 2003. This video was way less dramatic and did not have all the beautiful images that The Last Lions did. However, it also told of a mother teaching her cubs.

The lions of this region have many adaptations to survive in these special habitat. These lions have developed thicker fur and stronger forelimbs in comparison to other lions that live in Kenya and South Africa. The lions of Botswana are very successful despite the watery environment. Not quite the dramatic overcoming that appears in Last Lions.

While I do not discredit the beauty of this film, you really should watch both and do a comparison.",1324339200,,678,4.689075630252101
4906523,5,B005Z2D88O,"Think about the phrase when describing someone who has ""the heart of a lion"". In The Last Lions, Beverly and Dereck Joubert aim to demonstrate this phrase, in the form of a quasi-documentary film.

The film is not quite objective in flavor as a real documentary, but is still filled with facts and observations from the eyes of the Jouberts. The very scientific types (as well as those who believe animals are beneath humans) may completely dismiss the film due to its anthropomorphic nature, but I believe this one should not be completely dismissed. You may ask, why not? The film is filled with details and observations that are telling; the award-winning duo, the Jouberts, have dedicated their entire lives to the study and preservation of cats. They have braved the volatile weather and forgone daily comforts to catch even a glimpse into the lives of these creatures. Their observations are detailed here, and narrated by Jeremy Irons using deeply sonorous tones evocative of the warm, rich colors of the film.

You are thrust head first into an intimate acquaintance with Ma Di Tau, the main lioness. A little background information- Lions have a unique social structure- they group in prides, and are comprised of a single male and several females. The females hunt, and the males have to secure their lands, often against other male lions. When a male challenges another, the male either stands down (and is driven off), or fights. If the other male wins, it is in their instinct to kill any cubs from the previous male. Another option is for the female to take her cubs and run, hopefully joining another pride. This social structure places the female lions of prides with unstable factors (weak males, encroaching humans, etc) in particularly difficult situations. The instinct to survive, or to protect cubs, is a familiar scenario in nature, man included. Though this is not necessarily what the film is about, you will come to sympathize with Ma Di Tau, you will cry when she does, and you will roar when she does. The point of the film is that you will ultimately come to an understanding of Ma Di Tau, and come to celebrate what it means to have ""a heart of a lion"", or in this film, ""the heart of a lioness.""

The only part with numerical facts come spliced in the ending credits, reminiscent of the Jouberts' TedTalk, in which there are details about the dwindling creatures and mere minute shots on what the Jouberts went through in order to capture the footage found in the film. The fact that there wasn't even a human featured in the film should be telling enough of the subtle ways humans affects can wildlife, and the Jouberts have an intimate understanding of this. This film is their own message, their own cries, in hopes of an eventual triumph.",1324252800,26,2773,4.760914760914761
4906524,5,B005Z2D88O,"This spectacular movie follows the life of one lioness as she finds a territory of her own, and deals with an antagonistic pride of lions and the massive (and deadly) prey animals in her territory.

The Jouberts capture the lioness' life like no other filmmakers have ever done. They document amazing details of her life, going far beyond the cliches of the average lion documentary. The story they tell is harsh, brutal, and HEARTBREAKING. If you have the fortitude to stick with the movie until the end, the story is ultimately uniquely uplifting.

The narrator's script delves deeply into what the pseudo-scientific types will want to dismiss as ""anthropomorphizing"", but if you can look at what has been filmed and not know that every aspect of this film is absolutely and beautifully true, including the narration, you're just not paying attention.

I know people who could not sit through the beautiful fable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-Brothers/dp/B00005JN2B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two Brothers</a>&nbsp;because they thought the tigers suffered too much in the story. This movie is reality, and it is far harder to take than the fable. But if you can take it, you will never forget it.

A very important movie.",1323475200,57,1272,5.507692307692308

Is it me or are some of the scenes in ""The Last Lions"" seem fake and edited to seem real? For example: At the beginning when the female and her cubs are crossing the swollen river, it looks like the smoke to the left of the screen, once they cross, is fake. It never actually showed the pride of lions and the runaway female and cubs in the same frame either. They could have really been chasing her I just didn't see the proof. It doesn't show the lioness and her male counterpart in the same frame when he is suffering in the early beginning, though it is edited to make it seem like she finds him and stares at him. I'm not complaining, just noting some things. I really liked the film. There are just a few scenes that seem pieced together to seem real. The story is gripping, very dramatic and intense. It could be I'm just flat out wrong about my acquisitions. I just really want to know if that smoke was real or fake... right after lioness & cubs crossed the river.....",1414022400,,987,4.25531914893617

The camera work by Derek and Beverly Joubert is outstanding, the narration by Jeremy Iron strikes just the right tone and the background music portrays a tragedy.

I admit to a tear towards the end, when the story takes an unexpected and dramatic turn.  Jeremy Irons narrates the film, and since I need to use closed captions because of my hearing loss, I could not hear a lot of the narration clearly.  One friend (out of 6) who borrowed my DVD  found Irons' narration a bit of a monotone.

I will also say this --- thanks to this important documentary, which moved me greatly, I am now supporting the Big Cat Initiative.

The Last Lions is a powerful, moving, sad and somewhat disturbing, visually stunning, action-packed, and electrifying film. The film, seen in HD, is like nothing else ever filmed about the mysterious and noble beasts known as lions.
Jeremy Iron's narration is perfect, and Dereck and Beverly Joubert's footage is truly, truly stellar.

It tells the story of Ma di Tau (Mother of Lions), and her battles to protect her cubs, and rear them into lions. As The Last Lions proclaims: There is no stronger force in nature than a mother's love.

By far the best nature film of the year!

4906636,5,B005Z2D88O,"Wonderful film that shows reality in the wild.

This movie shows how hard it is even for these beautiful and majestic kings (and queens) of the wild to live and survive the wild. Most of the time we see big cats such as lions as predators of deers and other animals in the wild. But this movie shows how brutal it is to survive in the wild. I am the type of person who cheers when a deer or zebra escapes the fangs of lions or tigers on TV. But after watching this and seeing some other National Geographic documentaries make me appreciate them.

I cried several times in these movie. Nicely done, some people may find it a little dramatic but I don't. There is one thing worth mentioning though that for me is of minor importance. SPOILER: There is a flashback scene that I have seen in another Nat Geographic documentary (Lions and Hyenas Eternal Enemies) where it shows what happened to the other lioness how she got ambushed by other lions and lost her one eye. In Lions and Hyenas they showed that the lioness was killed. But then I assumed they probably used this scene as a flashback scene to make the viewers feel sympathetic to the other lioness (we do have 2 main Lionesses in the movie) or they borrowed this scene for the other documentary.

Other than that, the movie is brilliant. Because of National Geographic it makes me appreciate how beautiful and majestic lions are and how hard it is for them to survive. Now going to Africa to see these wild cats in action is in my Bucket List.",1344124800,,1500,4.407942238267148

It is very well put together. High production values aside, this film features some of the most touching scenes I have seen yet in any lion documentary. The narrator's deep calm voice guides you in a detailed tour of a single lion's love for her cubs. It is extremely easy to get absorbed into the turbulent emotions the main characters of this film goes through. I didn't cry at the end of Titanic, but I sure as heck teared up multiple times in this movie. The lions are portrayed in such a way that I almost believed this was staged, as in the lions are merely actors guided by a director and trainer behind the camera. However, the events are so vivid, I don't think it's possible to manufacture something like this.

This is a rare find, no doubt. Out of all the documentaries that tried to humanize the lions, and attempt to translate their inner thoughts for us to understand, this one did it with efficiency. The commentary combined with the lions' actual body language, and even the light dulling in their eyes in desperate times, weaved a believable yet entertaining story. This deserves two thumbs way up.",1342310400,3,1385,4.492063492063492
4906639,5,B005Z2D88O,"This film, and I do mean FILM, is one of the most beautiful on the subject of African wildlife ever. Like all Joubert films, this one is several years in the making.
This is not a typical Animal Planet documentary that took a few weeks to film and edit. The Jouberts literally follow and film their subjects for years at a time. This film, like all of their others, is absolutely amazing if you're in to nature. It is heartwarming and heartbreaking.  Unfortunately this is the way of real African survival for big cats.  Horribly tragic at the same time as triumphant. I actually just finished this one an hour ago and I honestly I can't express in words how I feel about so many parts.

However, I was a little disappointed in viewing the deleted scenes and discovering that the story had actually been significantly altered while still being presented as ""true"". I was also disappointed in the beginning how obvious it was that different shots from completely different days were all combined as if it happened in a couple hours. You are left wondering just how much of the story is accurate.

She slowly adapts to the new landscape while rearing a new enemy, the King of the Bulls; ""Scar"". As they square off on this island time and again, she becomes a deadly hunter, desperate to feed her young, but here comes the twist of fate; her old nemesis and the invading Pride of Lionesses are coming!
I would have named this brutal documentary ""Fate"", because it is the best example of nature and it's cruel laws that I have ever seen. ""The Last Lions"" is the elite documentary on Lions, and is narrated to perfection by the always magnificent, Jeremy Irons.

In my volunteer work at the Lion Camp (SDZSP), my main job is to create a connection between visitors and the creatures in our exhibits, and the reason why they're here, and the many ways we can help save their habitat and protect their population. I am deeply passionate about the wildlife conservation of Big Cats, and I do not ask visitors to feel the same passion I feel, but to make them understand why we need to help... This movie does a tremendous job at excelling that function: These animals are in such danger, and people (our ever over-populated world) need to understand that we must act now!

With the incredible story of Ma di tau and her cubs, her strengths, weaknesses, and all of what she endures to survive should say something out loud to all of us: To her, is the fight for survival, and to us, is the fight we must win to protect these creatures.

You will learn that Lions, amongst many other big cats, are aggressive creatures in their own environment b/c they need to be to survive, they don't ""attack"" because they're ""evil"", they attack because they're hungry, they feel threatened, and they know life is damn hard for them...

4906653,3,B005Z2D88O,"I just watched this dvd, and have some thoughts to share...

On the upside, this is a beautifully shot documentary. Of course the standard for documentaries nowadays is high, and often very good to watch at home. However this, like Relentless Enemies, also by the Jouberts, is BBC level documentary in terms of footage. Absolutely no remarks here, other than perhaps the fact that I personally love to watch male lions as well, and this 1,5 hour documentary is pretty much all about female lions. They are gorgeous examples of the species though. This documentary is about a lone lioness, who had a small pride with her mate, and her mate and she are attacked at the start of the story, and the male is so ravaged that he dies. She is then exiled, and our story begins.

So why detract two starts? Two reasons, one star detracted for each. First is the ""plot"". There seem to me to be a significant difference between what you actually see, and indeed what actually happened, and the plot of the film, which appears to be concocted by the Jouberts. A lot of the story itself seems suspect, and it seems like the gorgeous footage they had was cut and pasted to match a script they had in mind. Which is a shame, because this footage really did not need a plot at all, and certainly this plot also looks rather unbelievable. To go into specific examples would spoil the film somewhat, let's just say that some sequences that were filmed seem to have been spread out over the film somewhat, in order to tell the ""plot"", and also, some sequences show something, but then a story is told about that sequence which you don't see. As an example, at the start of the film we see the lioness gazing over the plains, and we are told that she has finally found, and is looking at, her mate, who we see dying at that point. But you never even see the two of them in a single shot, or approaching each other, or having anything at all to do with each other really. And there's more of that later on. I understand some viewers gloss over these things entirely, but as a somewhat observant and critical reader and viewer, it stuck out to me.

My second complaint is the downright irritating narration by Jeremy Irons. He speaks in a very low, deliberate, faux meaningful way, he repeats himself, but mostly he just speaks average sentences and tries to pass them off as wisdom through the tone of his voice. I found it overly dramatic the way he narrated this film, and it actively interferred with my enjoyment of it. It's a shame, I'm sure the Jouberts went for Irons as a deliberate choice because he is a famous actor and has narrated films of theirs before, and they probably thought he had just the voice for this tale. I beg to differ.

Still, the documentary is worth seeing despite these complaints, and Amazon is currently offering it quite cheap at 10 bucks or so.",1333756800,3,2859,4.481765834932822
4906654,4,B005Z2D88O,"I almost never write reviews but I just finished this movie (and dried my tears). I gave it 4 stars because it was a stunning and beautifully done documentary.  The shots they managed to get and the flow of the story was amazing. Definitely what you'd expect from a National Geographic film.  But it was so depressing it was difficult to finish. They barely mentioned the main threat to lions, aka overpopulation in Africa and the destruction of natural land in favor of agricultural products and cows to feed all these people. No, they're too busy just trying to survive in the wild. *spoilers ahead* Evil buffalo and a somewhat sadistic challenge from a rival pack manage to kill the male lion and two of the cubs. The first cub is eaten by a crocodile while the mom watches passively and never tried to help him cross the river. Then she finally manages to take down a buffalo and eats it by herself....then goes to sleep it off and leaves her cubs unprotected all night!  They stampede through the cubs hiding place and crush the back of the little girl cub. To watch her drag herself across the ground after her mother and then have her mother abandon her with barely a second glance while she's crying for her....I couldn't stand it. I know it's survival of the fittest and she wasn't going to survive, but that was heartbreaking. The fact that she then attacks the head buffalo in practically a suicide attack in revenge is interesting but doesn't make up for her lack of parenting skills. Jeremy Irons was an interesting choice for narrator as he was the evil Scar in Lion King and his voice brings back bad memories. Of course, to salvage the end when you're about to throw the dvd, she discovers her male cub managed to survive on his own. No thanks to her! Maybe next time they could pick a better representative of the female lion population. She is certainly never going to win mother of the year!",1333670400,3,1910,4.546511627906977

4906656,5,B005Z2D88O,"The lioness being viciously mauled near the beginning of Dereck & Beverly Joubert's The Last Lions; was not the featured lioness they named Ma di Tau. That deadly mauling actually occurred 19 years prior to when this movie was made. That mauling clip was borrowed from their successful 1992 film called: [Eternal Enemies, Lions And Hyena's]. Ma di Tau is never brutally mauled by rival lionesses, and she never rupture's the eye ball of rival Silver Eye, which can be verified to be completely fictitious. That Eternal Enemies mauling clip, was deceptively spliced into this film, and passed off as original material.

That lioness was mauled to death, and shown being eaten by several scavenging hyenas in 1992, and has been revived 19 years later by these film directors, to play the role of Ma di Tau. When you have followed Dereck & Beverly Joubert and all their past films, you know right away when you have seen a scene before. All those who have seen Eternal Enemies, and The Last Lions, will immediately know that the two lioness attack clips from both movies, are one and the same.

That original fight clip was edited into The Last Lions script, with a computer generated fake eye injury added, to give this movie its fictitious script of: Silver Eye and her pride, seeking the same encroaching lioness they killed back in 1992, who returns back from the dead 19 years later as Ma di Tau, who's fearful for her nine lives once again. (Hypothesis) Just knowing they fabricated this script, took away Dereck & Beverly Joubert's integrity, and sincerity. I should also mention, they use this disturbing lioness mauling clip, two more times during this movie.

The main problem I have with this movie is with its ill script. That a pride of seven lionesses from the north, stopped the eviction of a rival lioness without a pride, and accepted her into their pride as their new leader. It is a proven and much known fact, that lioness would never accept an unrelated lioness and her cub into their pride. Let's assume these lionesses indeed had accepted Ma di Tau and her cub, eventually the two male lions that ran her and her 3 cubs out of their territory and killed her mate, would kill her 2 remaining cubs, in order to father their own cubs.

Another problem I have with this movie's accuracy is when a clan of eight hyenas' appear out of nowhere, and surround Ma di Tau as if they are going to attack her. One of her cubs was fully exposed out in the open, with a broken back and crippled legs. Are we to believe that a clan of hungry hyenas didn't smell the cub's bloody scent, nor see it moving? They were only a few feet from the injured cub, and still didn't detect it. The lioness then returns to her cub even before the hyena threat is over. The hyenas then clearly looked back at the lioness and her mortally wounded cub. Ma di Tau then abandons the poor cub forever, a few moments later.

After I observed these lionesses, and how they banded together near the end of this movie with Ma di Tau, I became certain that she, and her last cub, were never in danger of any attack because, she was their pride member all along. My perceptions lead me to conclude, those lionesses already knew her, because they quickly responded after she roared, and called to them. Territorial lioness would never kindly respond to a rival's SOS call, to help it hunt Water Buffalo while intruding in their territory.

If a trespassing Ma di Tau knows to keep quiet or be killed again, why would she give away her location, by roaring as loudly as she did? (hypothetically speaking) They showed supposed rivals Silver-Eye, and Mau di Tau, the new leader of the pride bonding near the end of the movie, as if no aggression had ever happened. They fabricated this and just about the whole script in this movie to create some fictional drama. For example, all of Silver Eye's pride, just unusually stood around several times watching from a distance, as she went out alone to face Ma di Tau. The lioness mauling clip shows that a lioness pride always works together as a group, when facing any rival.

The Last Lions is a visual of hardship and survival that touches deep senses that have been suppressed by many years of human evolution. To watch a mother lose her mate who put his life on the line for what is his and die, then witness a fearful cub waiting until it's too late and get eaten alive, then witness the mother's cry after she finds only one of her cub and its fatally hurt. To see the lioness risk her life so she and her cubs will not starve. How us people got life so easy and they got food given to them when they are not willing to provide for themselves. How many opportunities people have in front of them and they are just being passed by. How many people wait fearfully until it's too late and its over then? The animals in the wild have to lose all their fear to fight for what they need. How many people lose all fears to get what they want? This movie might awaken the strength in people who have something to fight for, to see Ma Di Tau go hunt over and over even though there is fear and hardship, to be able to fight others who are willing to kill her and her cubs. Those are true God given natural instincts that will awaken the fighting spirit of those who watch this, considering those people have a heart and if they do, they will experience a wide range of emotions that a billion other movies will not make them.",1329436800,2,1414,4.1268115942028984

4906666,4,B005Z2D88O,"Wildlife photographers and documentarians Beverly and Dereck Joubert created the Big Cats Initiative with National Geographic to educate people about the declining populations of large felines in the wild and, hopefully, to save them from extinction. ""The Last Lions"" is part of that effort. The film follows the daily life and struggles of a lioness and her cubs in Botswana's Okavango Delta. Fifty years ago, there were about 450,000 lions in Africa. Now there are an estimated 20,000. It is the filmmakers' hope that giving people an intimate view of these animals, in a narrative form, will inspire the audience to want to protect them.

The filmmakers call the lioness Ma di Tau (Mother of Lions), and actor Jeremy Irons narrates her story. Ma di Tau has a mate and three cubs but is forced to flee her home territory across a perilous river, when another pride of lions in search of new territory invade hers. She and her cubs take refuge on Duba Island, in the middle of a swampy river. When a herd of buffalo take up residence, it's not clear whether they will be dinner or a new menace. And a lioness with whom Ma di Tau did battle still looms threateningly on the other side of the river with her following of females, seemingly not content to let Ma di Tau and her cubs alone.

What is interesting about this film is also what is likely to be controversial. Ma di Tau's fight for survival for herself and her cubs is turned into high drama, which it is, but is also imbued with emotions and particular motivations via the narration. I'm not entirely against this. Emotions are not unique to humans. Countless species experienced them before humans existed. I don't think the film overplays the emotions, but I was sometimes doubtful of the motives it attributed to Ma di Tau. Even without the narration, this is an incredible story, however. It has drama, action, and will evince a gamut of emotions in the human audience no matter how the cats felt.

I was surprised how far the animals would go to defend their brethren and to destroy their enemies. I've always thought of lions as powerful predators, but ""The Last Lions"" makes it clear that hunting is difficult and usually unsuccessful. The challenge of feeding and protecting cubs in this environment, on her own, is heart-rending, and, though she is usually stoic about it, it gets to Ma di Tau sometimes. The shifting allegiances between the animals are fascinating, but the film focuses on narrative rather than facts, leaving me to wonder whether the animals were acting out of instinct, logic, or emotions. It's an incredible, intimate look at life in the wild, in any case.

The DVD (Virgil Films 2012): Bonus features include ""Behind the Scenes"" (27 min), which is footage of the Jouberts filming without any narration or explanation, some deleted scenes, a publicity spot for the Big Cat Initiative called ""Cause an Uproar(dot)org"" (30 sec), 2 theatrical trailers (2 min each), and an ""Interview with Dereck & Beverly Joubert"" (12 min) in which the couple answer some questions about the film and about their many books.

  The cinematography is superb. Over and over again, we are treated to beautifully framed nature shots. The cloud cover alone is  breathtaking. Wide angle distant views (including aerial shots) would make any set designer envious. Top talent all around including ""lighting by God""! This is true art at its best.
  The storytelling may be the most compelling draw. The best scriptwriters in Hollywood could not have done better. Your emotions will go to all extremes-you will rejoice, you will feel sadness, and you will cheer for certain players- but never because of misleading copy or cheesy special effects. The words ring true throughout. The film editors do use occasional effects- The sepia filter is beyond gorgeous! Even here, it is not used as a gimmick for it never detracts from the stunning real life visuals. (Lions look great in Sepia- especially HD)
  The last 15 minutes are beyond belief! This is the story of one lion in particular- ""The Mother of Lions"". Her journey through life, and how she rises to power (despite great loss) is the stuff of legends. WOW!
  The narration by Jeremy Lyons is, once again, perfect.
  The musical score is excellent, and perfectly supports the triumph and tragedy of each scene. Near the end, the use of a single woman's vocals will give you chill bumps. You may well cry- the scene plays out with joy at first, then chilling remorse and a deep heart-felt sorrow.
  I have not seen an ending to a movie that blew me away like this since ""The Sixth Sense"". (No- lions don't see dead people- just dead water buffalo!)
  It just couldn't get any better than this- and then it does! The Joubert's have devoted their lives to the study and filming of big cats, but The  King of the Beasts is in trouble.  The statistics are frightening- the lion population in Africa has dropped by over 90% in 50 years. This film is not just to entertain- it is a tool to encourage us to do everything we can to preserve these ""Last Lions""  Through this movie, this masterpiece, you will will develop a deeper love for these amazing creatures, and then hopefully you will cherish and protect what you love.
