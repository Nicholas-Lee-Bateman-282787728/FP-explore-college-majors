8645050,5,B00ISK982U,"I spent an hour looking for a workout video that *I* could do.. I found one. It still kicked my butt in a good way. I'm not a senior, but I am 42 and have health issues that include thyroid, arthritis, chronic migraines, back problems and a fused hip.
I have tried doing all the normal routines and yoga's and Pilate's and zumba and even my own exercise routines I used to teach in dance class... but the regular ones are too hard for me to keep up with, the yoga is hard to do because I have core strength but little strength elsewhere due to my back being bad in three spots. ..and my body is so used to my routine that it literally does nothing for me even though it kicks everyone else's butts.

So.. today I tried this routine and I have no extra back pain afterwards, to be honest.. I have less pain in my back right now than I did before I did this workout.  .. I did have to push through the pain at first (hence the crying) but .. 45 minutes later.. I feel accomplished and excited that I found something that doesn't make me feel like a  failure afterwards.",1532044800,,1067,4.144927536231884
8645051,5,B00ISK982U,"I'm 46 and remember Tracie from The Firm, back when I was in great shape. Well, life happens, and now I'm overweight, out of shape, dealing with some injuries, and in minor pain. I was a bit overwhelmed about where to start with regaining my fitness, and this video is everything I wanted. It focuses on strength, mobility, and balance. I mix it with low-impact cardio and stretching/yoga for total fitness. I look forward to working my way up to Tracie's Longevity and Stronger Longer Series.",1527638400,,493,4.744186046511628
