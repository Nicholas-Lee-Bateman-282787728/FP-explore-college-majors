7961137,1,B000065NBJ,"CAUTION when buying! This review applies to the HEAVEN FIRE COMPANY release.  It says it is 200 minutes long, which would make it pretty much the full length serial.  It's the same 84 minute version offered in many editions for as low as 1 dollar.  I was willing to spend 29.95 for the full version, but not for another copy of the one I bought so inexpensively not long ago.  As for the movie itself, it's Tarzan,  and not MGM's famous one , so you know you aren't in for Shakespeare or Ibsen.  Jungle swinging, alligator fight, etc. are all here though. It's very low budget fun, although somewhat disjointed having been edited down from a longer serial.  Crabbe does a  pretty good job and is in peak physical shape, and the leading lady is pretty.",1411776000,3,751,4.470588235294118
7961138,3,B000065NBJ,"Not bad DVD containing two 1930s B quality Tarzan movies.  TARZAN THE FEARLESS was originally a serial that was eventually edited and stitched together to make a feature-length film.  OK.  Tarzan is played by Buster Crabbe, a not bad looking athlete that plays Tarzan in his interaction with the love interest like he is mentally impaired.  Tarzan and Mary, (not Jane), act like two grammar school kids with each other.  No romantic chemistry at all, even for an early 1930s film.  Somewhat dullsville.  TARZAN'S REVENGE stars two professional athletes as Tarzan and Eleanor, (again not Jane).  Hedda Hopper, in one of her few movie roles, plays Eleanor's mother.  A pair of unknowns, (at least by me), play Eleanor's doofball dad and animal-murdering, country-clubbing fianc.  This cracked family unit goes to Africa to bring back a zoo-full of captured animals.  They run afoul of a lustful Arab potentate with a stronghold in the jungle.  Sort of south of his expected regions.  The non-actors playing Tarzan and Eleanor are just that.  Again, no romantic chemistry.  Other than that both of these films are OK time wasters. for Tarzan completists.  The Roan DVD is not as high quality as I was hoping.  Even though both transfers are OK quality, they are not re-mastered.  Hopefully someday both films will be released upgraded and high quality.",1380412800,2,1349,5.027149321266968
7961139,4,B000065NBJ,"I gotta admit, I'm a sucker for jungle B-movies, and if they're Tarzan adventures, all the better. Two of them make up a double-feature DVD put out by the Roan Group, TARZAN THE FEARLESS (1933), and TARZAN'S REVENGE (1938). Produced by B-journeyman Sol Lesser, both films are good, old-fashioned jungle romps with one viewer requirement, and that's to sit back and enjoy.

TARZAN THE FEARLESS is the better of the two, with a fairly interesting plot. Originally a 12 part serial, all that exists is a feature version that's been floating around in public domain VHS and DVD transfers for years. Based on an original story by Edgar Rice Burroughs and directed by Robert F. Hill, TARZAN THE FEARLESS stars Olympic swimming champion turned actor Buster Crabbe as the famed ape-man. Crabbe, who went on to immortalize Flash Gordon in three serials for Universal, dons a leopard-skin loincloth and makes a pretty good Tarzan too, albeit an inarticulate one. But hey, that's part of the fun of the character. The important thing is he handles himself well in the action scenes. The story concerns a fortune hunter (Philo McCollough) out to kill Tarzan so he could claim a large reward. He and his accomplice (Matthew Betz) accompany a professor (E. Alyn Warren), his daughter (Jacqueline Wells) and her boyfriend (Edward Woods) on a safari to search for a treasure in emeralds that's guarded by the ancient tribe of Zar.

Since this was edited down from a serial, the continuity is understandably a little choppy in spots. The acting is appropriately melodramatic, with occasional unintentional humor such as when the villain is dying and he moans, ""I was wrong Mary, trying to win you... by being a rotter!"" Also, Matthew Betz's idea of acting tough consists of constantly hitching up his pants and spitting. Cute and sexy Jacqueline Wells has a brief, pre-Code skinny dipping scene wearing a very skimpy slip. The music score is a patchwork of original and stock compositions heard in other low-budget productions from the era. If TARZAN THE FEARLESS seems somewhat pedestrian in style, it nonetheless retains a certain charm that I find entertaining. For some reason, the simplicity of the parting scene between Edward Woods and Jacqueline Wells has always stood out in my mind. After Woods is turned down in favor of Tarzan, he gives Wells this sarcastic little ""so long"" salute and walks off, dejected.

Even though The Roan Group's DVD transfer of TARZAN THE FEARLESS is from the same source print used by other distributors, the sharpness and contrast looks better here. It's splicy to be sure with some hiss and pop in the audio, but this is the best version available.

Directed by D. Ross Lederman, TARZAN'S REVENGE (1938) is also a Burroughs tale about a hunting safari consisting of a young girl (Eleanor Holm, another Olympic swimming champion), her parents (George Barbier, Hedda Hopper), and ineffectual fiancee (George Meeker). An evil sheik (C. Henry Gordon) kidnaps the girl to add to his harem, leaving Tarzan (Glenn Morris, yet another Olympic champ) to save the day. This film contains a little more humor for its own sake than TARZAN THE FEARLESS, and runs almost 20 minutes shorter. Morris is passable as Tarzan, and his jungle cry is the same one used for Buster Crabbe in the earlier film. Eleanor Holm is pretty as Tarzan's girlfriend, and both she and Morris get a chance to display their diving and swimming skills. Holm also plays her role with a tongue in cheek quality that's largely responsible for the light hearted tone of the film. There's not much action until the ending, then things really come alive physically and visually when Tarzan sets out to rescue everyone from the sheik. The climax takes place on an elaborate palace set, complete with dancing harem girls and a host of feather plumed natives. Once again the music score is a mixture of original and stock cues, with even a familiar passage from WHITE ZOMBIE (UA, 1932) thrown in.

The print of TARZAN'S REVENGE is, like the other movie on this disc, a little beat up but better than you'll find elsewhere.

Bonus features include an episode each from two Republic serials, RADAR MEN FROM THE MOON (1951), and THE UNDERSEA KINGDOM (1936).

If you're looking for some vine swinging fun, pick up this affordable double feature and don't expect more than what these films were made to deliver - you'll enjoy them all the more for it.

7961142,4,B000065NBJ,"It makes sense to put out these two Tarzan films together: made a few years apart both by producer Sol Lesser in an effort to capture some of the spotlight of MGM's Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan epics. Both star former Olympic champions--Buster Crabbe and Glen Morris, respectively (Revenge... actually stars two chanpions; co-star Eleanor Holm was a swimming champion; she was so famous that no attempt was made to call her ""Jane""--she was referred to by her name, Eleanor). Both films even use the same stock library music. Both are modestly budgeted, which shows in comparison to the Weissmuller Tarzan films. But both are quite enjoyable.  Tarzan the Fearless is a feature version of what was originally a movie serial that seems to be lost.  Having seen poor to mediocre quality videos and dvd's in the past of both of these films, this is the best, clearest, quality I've seen yet--very acceptable. And the viewer even gets a bonus: chapter 1 of Radar Men From the Moon, also put out by the Roan Group.  I've been waiting to pick these films up on dvd and finally settled on this inexpensive double-feature version--and I'm glad I did.",1111622400,29,1137,4.82051282051282
7961143,2,B000065NBJ,"As is the case with several Tarzan films from the 1930s, ""Tarzan the Fearless"" was originally released as a 12-part serial.  The interesting historical footnote is that theater were given the option of showing the first four chapters edited together as a feature film to get kids interested in the serial and apparently many theaters showed the ""film"" without ever airing the rest of the serial (or even the trailer for the next exciting episode).  Apparently all that is left is the ""film,"" which explains why ""Tarzan the Fearless"" is a prime candidate for the bottom of the heap of Tarzan movies. Tarzan is played by Buster Crabbe, who won the gold medal in the 400-meter free-style at the 1932 Olympics, one of three formers Olympians to play the Lord of the Jungle that decade.
The story (or the first third of it since the rest of the serial is apparently long gone) begins with Dr. Brooks (E. Allyn Warren), studying ancient tribes in darkest African when he is captured by the people of Zar, the god of the Emerald Fingers.  Tarzan aids the doctor's daughter, Mary (Jacqueline Wells) in trying to find and rescue her father, along with everybody else who has fallen captive to Eltar, the High Priest of Zar (Mischa Auer).  However, ""Tarzan the Fearless"" pretty much ends before it gets interesting after about 85 minutes, which is a blessing.
Keep in mind that this is a 1933 film, which means pre-code and explains the reason Tarzan's loin cloth is the skimpest you have ever seen (hopefully).  Crabbe, whose previous film role was Kaspa the Lion Man in the Tarzan ripoff ""Lord of the Jungle,"" is given little to do and is also in the running for the least articulate Tarzan of all time.  So if it was not for purient interests, there would probably be no interest in this particular Tarzan movie at all.",1068508800,,1812,4.682389937106918
