This DVD is extremely informative and easy to follow, even though the people in it are experts i certainly got something out of it. All in all an excellent product and i will be buying more.",1409616000,,268,4.0754716981132075
8101408,5,B000CRT8UO,"I am not sure that I would call this an amazing dvd, but it is certainly a very useful introduction to the principles of breath control and natural motion that are at the heart of Systema, the Russian martial art that has gained noteriety in recent years. I would recommend that unless you are specifically looking for wrestling material, and not a general look at Systema, to get Vladimir Vasilev's dvds such as Hand to Hand Combat and teh New York Seminar. They are more well rounded for a non-wrestling interested viewer. This is not to cheapen the worth of this dvd. I give it five stars and I mean it. It is really good. Just not as useful as some of the other dvds in the Systema catalogue.

I suggest that you look for Scott Sonnon's books and dvds as well. They are very useful and run along a similar track as he too has a strong Russian flavor to his approach and applications.

Keep training.",1156550400,7,903,4.401197604790419
