Just like having a teacher there with you every step of the way! I highly reccommend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn to knit! Make sure you get her kit or go on her website before you start to get info on the needles you need and type of yarn! And, she is super helpful if you contact her needing any information!",1266451200,5,446,4.309523809523809
