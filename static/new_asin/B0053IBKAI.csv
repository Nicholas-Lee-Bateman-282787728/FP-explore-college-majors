8455264,4,B0053IBKAI,"I am cofused by the poor review given earlier, I found the instructor to be very good. He moves quickly though and this tape is not really for beginners. It will help if you have some experience with Kali/ escrima etc... If you look and listen closely you will learn some advanced concepts and this kind of material is not in abundance either. I saw some moves I had not seen before and some material useful for drills. Nice arm intwine and neck cranks. I would buy a part 2.",1334361600,,475,4.288888888888889
8455265,2,B0053IBKAI,"I really would advise anyone who thinking of buying this video to reconsider before blowing 30.00. Now to an untrained person 30 min's of a few cool moves maybe worth it, but to others once they see this video will realize that not allot of thought went into making this, ""Empty Hand: Kali Method Series"". First of all you have the instructor, who has some serious skill I believe but lacks in the teaching ability. His flow and organization of his methods are not very good at all, in-fact they barely cover proper striking, angles, footwork, counter-striking, grab's, deflections, kicking, strength training etc. The partner that he is performing all these move's on needs coaching in the film on how to perform several of the moves which show's me that this was not well thought out, and that his methods are not accurately understood by his students.

Empty Hand incorporates several key facets in modern combat, Strikes, Footwork, Elbows, Kicks, Knee's, Body Position, Grabs and Wrist Locks, Joint Locking, Submissions and the Anatomy and Physiology of the human body and how to strike them . You are not going to be an instructor in these things in 30 minutes even if he covered them all...they are studies unto themselves and need much time and attention in-order to gain proficiency.

Why did I buy this video? I am a student of combat and am always willing to learn, and unfortunately I live in an area that is has very little other than MMA, Tae Kwon Do, BJJ, Go-Ju Ryu and boxing. The Closest that come's to modern combat here is Goju-Ryu and Krav Maga, and even then the Krav Maga school is not very good....but I digress. Filling your library with good material is important whether it be books, videos, audio recordings etc... If you are looking to broaden you martial arts knowledge and are interested in Kali or eskrima get Danny Inosanto's stuff...he by far is best guys. And so I give this guy a 2 star for effort and and having a cool cover for his DVD.",1332720000,2,1972,4.663793103448276
