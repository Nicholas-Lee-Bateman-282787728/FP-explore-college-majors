To do so they had to learn exactly how the ears adn eyes work. This documentary explains that process and showed my how an understanding of human biology allowed the early recording managers to figure out how to record symphony orchestras and maket he first movies.

The films on this set are some of the most educational ones I've found online. They are hard science flicks, but they explain everything very easily.
