4188333,4,B003SHDN7E,This is a simple watch it and feel balanced video. I love it and will use it regularly. The producers don't over complicate this simple procedure. Just watch it periodically and get balanced. It really is that easy.,1360540800,,215,4.684210526315789
4188334,4,B003SHDN7E,"Although there are flashier graphics out there, and you are likely to fall asleep when watching chakra videos if you have a lot of stagnant energy to off-load, this video is very effective at changing your brain wave frequencies so that you can relax and allow the sound frequencies to do what they were designed to do. The suggested 'affirmations' that you look at on screen are more likely to bypass your conscious awareness - that place were you get 'stuck' with all your pre-programmed thoughts are good. They aim at targeting common issues people face when they clear chakras - this is my third product from her, and I think she does a great job at accessing the nervous system and brain to better the personality.",1343952000,5,719,4.669291338582677
4188335,1,B003SHDN7E,"It was really hard not to fall asleep on this video but I fought to stay awake just to get through it. I wanted to give it a chance. The concept is good and the audio segments are very relaxing, however, the overall execution is lazy and one-dimensional.

For each chakra, there is a looping background in the color of the chakra and adjectives describing the chakra scroll from the bottom of the screen supported with ambient audio. If there's not going to be more variety than this, then perhaps shorten the segments so the viewer remains engaged. Otherwise, the repetitiveness goes on for too long. How about make the words fade from the center or ghost the words and play with emphasis on some of the adjectives? Spice it up. Is this meant to put the viewer in a coma because if so, the video is a success. Maybe it's best to view one chakra per day as doing all seven chakras in one sitting was a challenge.

Also, the quality is poor. The words are not crisp and neither is the video. Basically, what you see in the preview is what you get for all of the chakras, that's it. Don't expect to get your socks blown off or for your Kundalini to do a jig. It's a repetitive template.

The price of this video should be what it cost to rent it - $1.99. Luckily I only rented it and even at that price, I would not sit through it again.

8404335,3,B003SHDN7E,"Disappointed - Was trying to replace one I had and couldn't find.  This one has sounds, colors, and words appropriate to each chakra.  The down side is that you have to focus on watching it to see the words.  It distracts from being able to go in depth in a meditation.  Will look for the one I had that gently tells you the messages with the colors and sounds.",1523923200,,361,4.188405797101449

8404340,5,B003SHDN7E,"This is  great DVD with wonderful Tibetian bowl sounds that vary for each chakra level with bright and colorful visuals and meaningful messages for each Chakra.  After watching, listening this video I am more balanced.  My cats even join me when I play this DVD and they seem to be better balanced and less crabby too.  I first found this online via Youtube and loved it so much that I had to own it.  Very happy with my purchase.",1404950400,2,430,4.3924050632911396

It gives you all the information for each chakra that you need for modern self-improvement. I watch it at least 3 x's per week.  It keeps my chakras balanced and active for my Yoga exercise.
