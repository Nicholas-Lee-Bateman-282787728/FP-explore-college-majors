1250173,3,B000022TSA,"Man, they freed Willy once and he just won't quit!  They freed him again and he ain't legit!  What up with you, Willy?",1397088000,,118,4.086956521739131

1250176,5,B000022TSA,"The Free Willy series was light and shallow, but this third in the series was much more brilliant in scenery and the characters and story line flowed nicely. Made me cry.",1386806400,,170,4.516129032258065
1250187,3,B000022TSA,I was really impressed with free willy 1 and 2 but in 3 I didn't feel for willy or what's his name I did feel for kid who was weighing his love for his dad and his hatred for his dads work,1379462400,,188,3.5
1250188,5,B000022TSA,"While this is just a movie, it's not surprising that the unnecessary killing of animals/mammals and selling them on the black market is true even in today's society. As I said that while the good guys won in Willy 3, there are still many illegal fishing is still going on and there are just not enough personnel to catch them all.",1378944000,,330,4.426229508196721
1250189,1,B000022TSA,old fans go back but i would stick to the original this is obviously a forced sequel for the original cast.,1378944000,,107,4.142857142857143
1250190,5,B000022TSA,"I watched this years ago when it 1st came out as a kid. I love the 1st one and the 3rd movie in this series. The 2nd movie is good, just in my opinion, it has a similar approach to the 1st movie.",1376265600,,195,3.558139534883721
1250191,5,B000022TSA,"My kids aged 3, 7 and 9 loved this, and it was good for the parents as well.  Lovely scenery of beautiful British Columbia, and a great story about doing the right thing.",1367193600,,170,4.151515151515151
1250192,1,B000022TSA,"My son (6) watched this movie, well part of it, and he was very scared.  He had nightmares that night.  I'm not sure what it's rated but Free Willy should be rated G I would think.",1364428800,,180,3.9722222222222223
1250193,5,B000022TSA,"The third in the ""FREE WILLY"" series is as entertaining as one and two. Jesse meets a young boy, Max. Jesse as we learned from ""FREE WILLY"" loves killer whales, and will attempt to do everything in his power to protect them from danger and save them. Jesse discovers that Max's father is involved in illegal business, and his goal is to kill whales to sell the meat. Jesse teaches Max right from wrong, and Max teaches his father the same. The story is intriguing, the colorful characters come to life, and both the scenery and sound effects are stunning. A great adventure for the entire family, and very enjoyable. Heartfelt, educational, and highly recommended!",1363737600,,664,4.782608695652174
1250194,5,B000022TSA,This was a very good movie. It was actually a family movie on New Years Eve. This was the one we were missing so thanks to Amazon we were able to see it.,1357257600,,153,3.6666666666666665
1250195,5,B000022TSA,"Our family chose to get the Free Willy movies.  It is a good selection over a long weekend.  We view it a few times a year!  It is refreshing, fun and entertaining.",1353974400,,164,4.0625
1250196,5,B000022TSA,"Willy the whale is back, this time threatened by illegal whalers making money off sushi. Jesse, now 16, has taken a job on an orca-researching ship, along with old friend Randolph and a sarcastic scientist, Drew. On the whaler's ship is captain John Wesley and his son, Max, who isn't really pleased about his father's job, but doesn't have the gut to say so. Along the way, Willy reunites with Jesse, who helps Max realize that whales are a little more than just cheese burgers. This is the third movie of the sequel and I found it be excellent also. This movie has great cinematography, great scenery, well written and poignant story and a very good soundtrack. Free Willy 3 is an excellent example how good a family movie can be. Sweet and innocent, bright and entertaining.",1262908800,,777,4.678832116788321
1250207,5,B000022TSA,I found the Free Willy 3 movie to be a bit too much.  I enjoyed the first 2 but enough is enough.  Glad I ordered this for my niece and not myself.  Had no problem with the DVD itself; just not impressed with the material.,1231718400,,222,3.888888888888889
1250208,3,B000022TSA,When you get to the third film in any series there is usually a drop in quality. 'Free Willy 3' is surprisingly good for a second sequel. the story of whaler's hunting Willy and his family is the most exciting film of the series. This film shows some character development as the whale hunters aren't shown as 1 dimensional characters. The DVD transfer is very good and I rate this film 3 stars.,1220054400,,395,4.424657534246576
1250209,5,B000022TSA,"Free Willy 3, is a great follow up to the first two movies.

  My oldest Son Derek, enjoys watching the first one so much,

  after a hundered times or more, its time to move on. So

  I bought Free Willy 2, then this latest one Free Willy 3.

  I the parent, injoyed the movie alot but for my son I think

  it was a little bit hard for him to watch, the harpooning of

  whales I think bothered him, he see's Willy as his friend,

  and is very hard to see a friend get hurt. I still think if

  your a Free Willy fan you need to have the hole set. Bring on

  Free Willy 4.

  Regards

  Dad",1154908800,,594,3.76271186440678
1250210,4,B000022TSA,"I found this Free Willy the worst out of the series, not because the movie was bad,it was good but there was some parts in this movie that peaple didn't like. The little kid kinda messed up the bond between Willy and Jesse. But this was still a great movie,what an ending this movie had,Willy becomes a daddy, shocking ending to a great series.",1081728000,,344,4.390625
1250211,2,B000022TSA,I liked this movie but they replaced Jessie. They had This 10 year old kind of come in and try to be the hero. I mean what was so special about the first too movies is that Jessie was the only one Willy trusted and then they had this ten year old come in and all of the sudden he and Willy were special friends. They should have left it alone with that special friendship between Willy and Jessie.,1047859200,,397,4.037974683544304
1250212,1,B000022TSA,"This movie blew it. We thought the could make up in the next film, but nnnnnnooooooo! I don't want to tell you the plot because it hurts me. This film is not for kids. Killing whales, bar fights, and pranks is why 9/11 happened!",1009756800,,228,4.204545454545454
1250213,5,B000022TSA,"Free Willy 3 is primarily about Max, an intelligent, inquisitive ten-year-old who accompanies his father on a whaling expedition.  His conscience bothers him about his father's career, but instead of taking the usual route of performing a string of silly pranks (like you would see in a lot of children's shows), he tries reasoning with his dad.  He also asks question after question -- not just about the technical aspects of whaling, but he also delves deeper into the more important questions of life (""Do you always have to do the right thing, even if it hurts?"").
One of the things I liked best about Free Willy 3 was the realistic and sympathetic portrayal of the father, even though he was the ""villain"" of the story.  He was a man doing a job that has been in his family for years, and without it he wasn't sure who he was.  Despite having a career others disagreed with, he was a caring, compassionate person who loved his son.  Other characters are drawn out nicely as well -- Jesse and Randolph, from the first two films, and their new co-workers on the sea -- showing their tempers as well as their more positive sides.
Couple all these features with stunning cinematography and a beautiful score, and you have one fine film!",983318400,,1237,4.63013698630137
1250214,5,B000022TSA,"This movie is great, despite what you may be thinking. More realistic that Free Willy 1 and 2, it's plot is seamless and easy to believe. Jesse (Jason James Richter) interns with Randolph (Schellenburg, the Native American  guy) as a research assistant. They find Willy with Jesse's harmonica call  played 24 hours a day throughout the Canadian sea. They encounter a whaling  boat, but the captain's son, ten year old Max, is silently opposed to  whaling. Max and Jesse work together to try and stop the whaling boat. It  isn't kid-ish like the other two Willy movies, and features less of Jesse.  The whales are beautiful, and there is a pleasant surprize at the end.  Hopefully there are more Willy movies ready to come out!",948931200,,726,4.76
7915363,5,B000022TSA,Awesome product!,1521849600,,16,7.5

7915365,4,B000022TSA,"This is the 3rd sequel of Free Willy I have on DVD, and it's the last sequel I would watch. There is also a 4th sequel of Free Willy, which is really the last sequel, but I would do without watching it. I never saw the 4th sequel of Free Willy before, but it's OK. That same actor Jason James Ritcher, who stared in the first two sequels of Free Willy as (Jesse) is also seen in this 3rd sequel, but is not seen in the 4th sequel, and I would hate to watch the 4th sequel without him in it. So that's why I say that I would just watch the first two sequels and this 3rd sequel of Free Willy, and do without watching the 4th sequel. And I really do like actor Jason James Ritcher who stars as (Jesse), and I would watch the first two sequels and this 3rd sequel of Free Willy with him all together. And not only do I like Jason James Ritcher, but I also like Willy the whale. I also find this 3rd sequel of Free Willy is a good movie to watch and enjoy, and so are the first two sequels. The 4th sequel of Free Willy might be a good movie for other people to watch and enjoy, but I just choose not to watch it and just stick with watching this 3rd sequel and the first two sequels.",1511136000,,1180,3.9208333333333334
