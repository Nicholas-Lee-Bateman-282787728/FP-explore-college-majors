8328706,5,B001O16SRI,"I would highly and I do mean highly recommend Autopsy Life & Death!!!  Sincerely, if all smokers would view this video they would stop smoking, it is that powerful a video presentation. In each of the four phases of the video it goes in-depth and it is an eye opener.  Anyone who is in the medical field should view this as well.  It is done so extremely well the thought of being squimish becasue it is an autopsy is reduced immediately.  The presentation is done before a live audience and they also present a number of demonstrations as to how the body functions.  For example, they give a great demonstration as to what happens when we eat and how it goes through the digestive system, etc. Bottom Line: don;t pass this video up.  It is worth every penny and more!!! DJ",1387497600,4,773,4.446808510638298
8328707,5,B001O16SRI,"got this for my Anatomy & Physiology students, actually just started watching it with them this quarter so have only seen 1 section but just as the other 2 videos by these doctors, it's really good.",1374364800,3,198,4.527777777777778
8328708,5,B001O16SRI,Recommended for anyone interested in the composition and function of the wonderful machine that is the human body. Clinically and professionally presented.,1369267200,2,155,6.090909090909091
8328709,5,B001O16SRI,"In this DVD, Dr. Gunther von Hagens and Prof. John A. Lee show the four causes of human death using cadavers. The causes are related to blood, cancer tumours, aging and organ failures. The cadevers have gone through the preserving process called ""plastination"". According to its inventor, Dr. Gunther von Hagens, plastination is "" The process of extracting all bodily fluids and soluble fat from specimens, replacing them through vacuum forced impregnation with reactive resins and elastomers, and then curing them with light, heat, or certain gases, which give the specimens rigidity and permanence"".

The video is sharp, colorful and detailed. It's unique. Nobody has ever done this before. It's a must for anybody who is learning anatomy. It tremendously satisfies my curiosity.

The only downside is there is no subtitle. That's an obstacle for non-biology viewers because you don't know the scientific terms beings used by the doctors. Dr. Gunther's accent also makes it a little difficult to understand sometimes.

This DVD is one of the 3 sets of DVDs in the same series. The others are Bodyworlds and Anatomy for Beginners.",1324166400,7,1131,5.169398907103825
8328710,5,B001O16SRI,Many colleges do not have cadaver labs and having these videos to show in place of hands-on dissection labs is wonderful.  The highly informative format of the presentations keeps the veiwer engaged and helps to overcome the discomfort some veiwers may experience.  The naked live models add shock value (of course) but I found them to also be particularly useful in uniting the subject matter between life and death. I recommend these for any A&P class particularly at the college level. The price is also very reasonable.,1299801600,4,523,5.0
