The 1990 Hindi film `Lekin' is an intelligent, poetic tale beautifully written and directed by Gulzar. It is a story of love, loss, and enlightenment all expertly interwoven into a mystical cultural framework set within an exotic Indian landscape. Combining romance with spirituality can be a precarious thing to do. Often times the spiritual can become dogmatic, overtaxing the overall storyline. Or the romance can emotionally overwhelm the spiritual, thus trivializing the underlying message. `Lekin' avoids both extremes and by doing so provides the audience with a profound, romantic, and immensely memorable viewing experience.

Dimple Kapadia (Reva) and Vinod Khanna (Samir) are two forlorn lovers separated by the immutable laws of time and space, life and death. The prospect of these two meeting each other would be impossible under ordinary circumstances and yet somehow they do meet. Reva has unresolved business to attend to while Samir has an important lesson to learn about the meaning of life and the true importance of the past and what it has to teach us. There is pain ahead for both of them, but with that pain comes truth, self-awareness and liberation.

Dimple Kapadia is magnificent in the role of Reva, her hauntingly beautiful face had an absolutely hypnotic affect on me. Whenever she was on the screen I couldn't take my eyes off her for a second. I was also impressed with the performance of Vinod Khanna as Samir. His slow transformation from a self confident, objective, scientifically oriented researcher to a impulsive, emotionally charged, angst filled seeker of spiritual truth was truly unforgettable.",1303344000,,1698,5.25830258302583
8143825,5,B000I2UKAU,"This is one of the most engaging Hindi movies I have watched, and with a unique plot...it centers around a man Sameer [Vinod Khanna] who is sent by his superior to do an inventory on the contents of an old Indian palace that hasn't been occupied since the 19th century. On his journey by train, he meets a mysterious woman, who then pulls a disappearing act on him.

At the village, he meets up with his old friend Shafi [Amjad Khan] who warns him about some of the dangers of the desert surrounding the village. When he gos out to the palace, he bumps into the mysterious lady [Dimple Kapadia] again, whose haunting looks and melodious songs compel him to find out her story.

There is a paranormal twist to this story that has to do with a soul being trapped between life and death...fearing death, and yet afraid of life...and Sameer needs to help the restless soul find peace, even at great cost to himself.

The acting by both leads are compelling [no surprise since they are both fine Bollywood actors], and the songs are simply amazing, they touch one's soul, especially the song ""Yara Sili Sili"" [one of my all-time favorites].

A wonderful film that explores the deeper meanings of life after death, wandering spirit, and human compulsions.",1185580800,4,1249,4.663636363636364
