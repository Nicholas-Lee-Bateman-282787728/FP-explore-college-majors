885686,3,6304469659,"This production (one of the only - if not the only available on VHS at the present) would warrant five stars considering Domingo and Verrett's performances alone.
However, there are times in this performance when  the SF Opera Chorus' performance is sloppy....I think mostly due to Maestro  Rudel's EXTREMELY fast tempi (particularly in Act 1) which defy musical  common sense and at times actually destroy the beauty of Saint Saens'  gorgeous choral writing.
One can only wonder - since this production was  filmed for ""Great Performances"" in 1981 - if the maestro was  under pressure from the PBS network to bring the length of the show in at  under 120 minutes.  There are also several short ""cuts"" in the  chorus parts to make Act 3 shorter...which is disturbing if you know the  show by heart.
The tempi ""settle down"" in Act 2 allowing  Shirley Verrett to shine. BRAVA!
Domingo is powerful throughout and is  especially Brilliant in the beginning of Act 3 - the scene at the  millstone.  Add this video to your collection for this 8 minutes sequence  alone!  BRAVO!
I would love to see this released in a letterbox  ""widescreen"" version so you could see more of the beautiful sets,  costumes and the stunning SIZE of this show....rather than the constant  camera framing of the principals.  Still, the sound is good quality and  picture is clear in this presentation.
1981 seems like a long time ago.  While the performances by the principals is fantastic, other artistic  considerations leave something to be desired from this production.  San  Fransisco Opera is such a fantastic opera house today with such a fine  chorus that I can't help but feel that a new production of one of my  favorite operas -available on VHS/DVD - is overdue.",951350400,49,1744,4.843537414965986
885827,4,6304469659,"Beware as another reviewer has already mentioned, Amazon.com isn't allowing one to write separate reviews for the 2 different performances (Vickers,Verrett, Davis. Royal Opera House at Covent Garden and Domingo,Verrett, Rudel, San Francisco Opera) of this opera. So I've decided to review both at the same time. I wish the Kultur label would remaster their operas into 5.1 surround sound Dolby Digital or DTS. That way the music would have more presence and the video would be crisper/sharper. Jon Vickers, who is my favorite helden tenor, sounded like he was straining to reach some of the high notes in the Covent Garden Opera performance of the opera. Shirley Verrett's singing and acting was spot on and the orchestra played with great feeling and moved the drama along. The Covent Garden performance overall was very sensual (e.g.the sexually graphic baccanale scene). In the San Francisco Opera performance Placido Domingo sung flawlessly, but his Samson wasn't as believeable as Jon Vickers'. Shirley Verrett's singing and acting was again spot on. I disagee with the reviewer who wrote that Julius Rudel and the San Francisco Opera Orchestra raced through the opera. I felt the tempi were just fine. The costumes of the Israelites and Philistines made one feel like one was watching the Munchkins of the Wizard of Oz or characters from Star Trek. Samson pulling down the columns of the Philistine temple in the final scene of the opera was very spectacular!",1377734400,6,1465,5.108333333333333
885828,3,6304469659,"It's hard to find this opera on DVD, which is a shame since the music is magnificent and the story offers many opportunities for enterprising directors and producers - not to mention vocalists. So one has to bear in mind that anyone looking for a better version of this will find slim pickings indeed.

This one has some very good points. Shirley Verrett is the best of them, as a subtle but daring Dalila with the come-hither in her eye (and voice, and movements). The orchestra keeps up a spirited tempo without rushing. The dancing for the Bacchanale is superb, with costumes then and in other scenes reminiscent of African tribal costumes. And Jonathan Summers is a suitably menacing High Priest. But Verrett by herself would make this worth watching.

So much for the good. Now the bad news: Jon Vickers has a voice you could grate carrots on. And in many good moments he manages the mobility and vitality appropriate to Samson, but for the most part he lumbers around the stage with occasional pauses to declaim a few bars. I don't know if his rasping was a factor of the recording - certainly Verrett and Summers don't sound scratchy - but they seriously detract from the overall quality.

The staging likewise is a mix. The director decided to drench everything in crimson, which gets old fast, and when Samson pulls down two massive but freestanding pillars at the end, it's plain that the rest of the temple was in no danger whatsoever. However, the scene at Dalila's house is very well done, as is the ""taunting"" near the end of Act III.

Overall, I'd say this is a passable version of a scarce opera - better than passable, when Verrett is onstage. I haven't seen the Domingo production, so I can't compare the two.",1368662400,3,1727,4.633986928104576
885829,5,6304469659,"I wish this was in real DVD (widescreen) quality, but the performance itself is PRIMO!  And the finale!  Now THAT'S how you end an opera!",1368489600,2,137,4.44
885830,5,6304469659,This is a traditional production and well done. The ending alone is worth owning this DVD. It is amazing. Never seen anything like it.,1368230400,,134,4.625
885831,4,6304469659,"A very fine production of this Opera. I was happy to find it and to be able to add it to my collection. I was especially impressed with the beauty and singing of Shirley Verrett, previously unknown to me.",1327708800,,204,4.256410256410256
885832,5,6304469659,I saw the production in London... Vickers is probably the best Samson I ever heard and saw on stage.. and I am an unconditional fan of Miss Verrett.. She was beautiful on stage and Dalila was so much in her voice ! After her death one year ago it is so nice to be able to have this vivid memory of a great opera evening in Covent Garden.. some years ago.,1317686400,,354,4.0
885833,4,6304469659,"There is no dought to tell that this is a great performance with Domingo, Verrett and Brendel at their best condition. Their voices are all powerful and beautiful with full of expression. The stage design is classical with traditional costumes, although I am not very sure that they are historivcally correct, and I was happy to enjoy this performance without funny modernism like Samson in T-shirt + jeans or Dalila in a mini-skirt. Rudel's conduct was also good and the orchestra played very well. Is this so good? YES!
But there are two problems. It is impossible to make the subtitles off. They are part of the video and we have to watch them always. Also soon after the end scene a loud extra anouncement starts. This is quite noisy!
Anyway I think in this stage this performance is the best.",1307836800,2,797,4.659574468085107
885834,5,6304469659,"This is an amazing performance of an amazing opera by amazing performers.  The only negative I would cite would be the quality of the recording.  The colors tend to bleed and the resolution really isn't up to HD standards, minor thing and probably not noticeable on a smaller screen (I have a 106"" screen).  Vickers and Verret give nearly flawless performances.  Vickers drops/mumbles a few words, Verrett is clearly counting and watching the conductor at one point,  but these are very minor things and would be un-noticeable to most viewers.  The supporting cast members are equally strong.  Everyone acted as well as they sang.  I just can't say enough good things about this DVD.  If you want a DVD of Samson, get this.  If you want an introduction to opera on DVD, this would be a good one as it is well paced and dramatic enough to keep the interest of an opera newbie.  :)",1306195200,3,879,4.606451612903226
885835,4,6304469659,"At times I thought Domingo looked like Victor Mature, though I was expecting a Delilah looking like Hedy Lamar. No problem. This is a terrific cast and production with great voices, music, sets, costumes, libretto and generous sub-titles, a rarity for the latter. The four stars go to Saint-Saen. With his genius he could have given us more show stopper arias like Puccini or Verdi. I counted one --- the love duet. And yes I missed how Deliah wrestled Samson's secret out of him.",1302566400,2,480,4.726190476190476
885836,5,6304469659,"As someone who always looks at the principle singers first in an opera, this production is a dream. While it's true that some of Rudel's conducting and some of the choruses are slightly objectionable, you simply can't beat the lead trio.

First of all, Shirley Verrett (La Nera Callas) is simply astonishing in this role, one of her finest. She has the perfect Italianate sound for Dalila from top to bottom. Her French diction is excellent, and her phrasing perfectly suites the French style of the work. I find her in fresher voice than in the later London production with Vickers, and her acting is far superior in this production as well. Her costumes and wigs are always flattering and help her get into Dalila's skin, and this manifests itself magnificently.

Domingo, though not my favorite tenor, is again consistent in his singing and characterization. He handles the French quite well and is quite believable as Dalila's helpless victim. His solo scene is very moving, as is his performance in the final scene. Brendel is also quite convincing. I find his baritone much smoother and better suited to the High Priest than Summers' in the London production, and his characterization is quite good throughout.

Overall, this is a gorgeous and impressive production of a superb (though overlooked), very French opera. Verrett is simply sublime, and the rest of the production follows her example. Highly recommended over all other recordings and DVDs of this opera (and I've heard/seen 'em all!).",1249084800,5,1502,5.024096385542169
885906,5,6304469659,"I have read with disbelief some of the negative reviews of this opera.  I can tell you with honesty that this is one of my favorite videos.  Domingo sings fabulously well, and Verrett sings, and looks, like a goddess.  (Actually, Domingo looks pretty good, too.)  And the baritone, Wolfgang Brendel, has a strong, ringing baritone that can't be beat!  I found the chorus to be excellent, and the scenery and costumes wonderful, especially for a house of the size of the San Francisco Opera.  Even the subtitles are easy to read.  And, of course, the music is very beautiful.  This is as close to perfection as you are ever going to find.",1223510400,8,637,4.625
885907,2,6304469659,"Well, I was very cuorious about this DVD but when i finally got it...what a disappointment!
The perfomance generally is very dull, the acting is boring and sometimes all lacks of director's work are obvious. They sing...rather good...but that's it. Better not see the video. When one watch the seduction scene it's rather hard to pick up how Dalila succeded to seduce Samson...kind of ridiculous. etc
More to this the sound direction of the opera is not really well-done - the voices are pulled straight very loud while the music is rather quite.

2 STARS only - better choose another video of this wonderful opera. For Verrett and Domingo fans only.",1220572800,,650,4.8558558558558556
885908,5,6304469659,"I've never thought that I could witness such a powerful and commanding performance till the day I've watched this dvd. I must admit that I've ordered this dvd for Verrett because I wasn't expecting Vickers to sound as powerful as in his thrilling 1963 samson recording with rita gorr on emi. but I was so wrong!
He's singing here with a terrifying power and in a complete trance that makes you think that he's truly a demi-god like samson. Even Madame Verrett who in san francisco production had dominated the stage in every scene she was in, is a bit shadowed by Vickers' divine aura. And I didn't like her short hair either. She was much more vibrant, agresive, glamorous in san francisco and so was the production. the rest of the covent garden cast isn't very strong. especially Summers' voice compared to brendel at san fran. is quite weak.

 the recent met production (from dg) has only one advantage, better sound and picture quality. but these two other versions are fairly well presented as well.

in short, if you like to watch a legendary samson accompanied by a legendary dalila and a great orchestra (davis surpasses levine and rudel)
buy this one. If you want a glamourous hollywood like production dominated by Verrett's unsurpassed Dalila and a great but not legendary samson (domingo) with superb cast and choir and orchestra buy the san fran. version.",1204848000,18,1369,4.7923728813559325
885909,5,6304469659,Always pleased with Shirley Verrett; the part belongs to her and she is amazing in it.  The chorus was simply amazing as well.,1182297600,6,126,4.478260869565218
885910,4,6304469659,"This opera ought to be called Dalila et Samson. In any production that I have seen, it is Dalila who captures eye, ear and imagination. Ms. Verrett is a phenomenon, she has beauty (though she has put on a little weight here), she can act, she can sing (and how!)and her intelligence shines through any role she has portrayed. She is a velvet-voiced Dalila, smooth and seductive. No wonder Samson succumbs to her charms despite the old Hebrew's misogynistic and xenophobic warnings. Ms Verrett's acting, excellent throughout, reaches a peak at the penultimate moments of the opera, just before the fall of the pillars.

I have to agree with the previous reviewer that the actual demolition of the temple was a little lacking. Those falling pillars would not cause much damamge. Otherwise the scene is magnificent. I do not want to spoil it for those seeing the opera for the first time, but there were a few moments when I had to look away, so brutual and realistic was the staging.

One sour political note. The scene opens in Gaza, where the Israelis groan under the heavy hand of the Philistines. In today's (March 2007) context, it is heavily and unpleasantly ironic. I hope that some day soon, both sides will settle to fair and lasting peace and that opera lovers on both sides will be able to view this opera with detachment and equanitmity and enjoy itwithout political passions interefering with their appreciation of the music.",1173657600,10,1436,4.809716599190283
885911,3,6304469659,"This is not one of my favorites but Domingo makes this watchable.  The last scene, as always, goes on a bit too long.",1167436800,,117,4.086956521739131
885912,5,6304469659,"I had seen this production years ago on PBS and its every bit as fantastic as I remember it.  Placido Domingo was still at his vocal best here, which was not the case with his farewell performance in Samson et Dalila with the Metropolitan Opera.  Some people see opera purely in terms of the singers.  I see opera as a total package, singers, costumes and sets. I feel cheated when I pay good money and get stylized sets..or no sets at all. This production has all of the aforementioned characteristics.  I only wished the film crew had pulled back a little further during many of the scenes so one could really enjoy the full effect of the production.  If you go for opulent sets and costumes, check out the Metropolitan Opera production of Turandot with Domingo and Marton.  I never really cared for that opera until I saw the Met's production and now I love it.",1149379200,12,864,4.506410256410256
885913,4,6304469659,"Here is a wonderful performance of Samson. It was filmed in London not more than a year after the rival dvd from Sanfransisco. The production by Elijah Moshinsky is marvelous in it's subtle details which bring the story to life. The sets & costumes by Sir Sidney Nolan are a beautiful fusion of African and Far Eastern art notwithstanding some bizzarely expressionistic front curtains before each act. Don' be put off by them. The cast is uniformly excellent. Verrett, one of the most dramatically beautiful women to ever walk the stage is a supreme Delilah. Her singing is ravishing and she infuses the character with so many subtle touches that show she has really thought out the role. She must have worked very well with the director because  it is all the small touches that bring her performance to life. For example, I love the way she conveys a woman voicing her thoughts out loud and discovering her feelings at the same time during the Act 2 duet with the High Priest. Verrett is also in the SanFransico dvd but she is that much more engaged with her role in this performance. She is also more flatterinlgy costumed in this version. Vickers is somewhat les of an actor than Verrett but Samson was one of his finest roles and his sheer force of nature tone and personality are more suited to the role of Samson than the otherwise wonderful Domingo in both other versions on dvd.  Jonathan Summers is, I think, the more convincing of the High Priest's than either Wolfgang Brendl or Sergei Leiferkus although to be fair Leiferkus makes the High Preist seem more spooky. Summers' singing is marvellously firm in what is one of those baritone shouting roles like Don Pizzaro in Fidelio.  Gwynne Howell is also the better of the singers portraying the Old Hebrew. He looks more convincing as an old man and he has the most velvety sounding voice of the three competing singers. My only reservation about this performance is the staging and setting for the Final scene. The Bacchanale is staged quite wonderfully as an outdoor fertility ritual involving blood sacrifice. Very well done and very convincing. In the rival SanFransisco version the ballet is staged as a wonderful temple orgy in a truly magnificent, steamy looking, pagan temple. The taunting of Samson in the temple is truly scary in it's brutality in the London version but it is negated by the unconvincing destruction of the temple by Samson. It mostly doesn't work because of the outdoor setting that the director & designer decided on so that when the collumns collapse It is unlikely that anyone would get hurt. In the rival Sanfransisco version we are treated to the most gloriously cinematic staging of the destruction of the temple. It still sends shivers down my spine 20 odd years later. That alone is worth the price of that dvd.  The Covent Garden Orchestra and Chorus respond excellently to Davis's masterly acount of the score somewhat surpassing the SanFransisco group under Rudel. The picture and sound of this dvd are as good as one could expect from a television recording that is over 25 years old. All in all, if you can afford only one dvd of Samson this really is the one to have.",1137801600,36,3171,4.739130434782608

Desde unos secundarios que estan entre la suficiencia discreta y la deficiencia hasta un coro flojo, pasando por una produccion anticuada, fea y aburrida, y por una poco inspirada direccion musical de JULIUS RUDEL.

7872393,5,6304469659,"Get this ""Samson"" and forget all others. While director Elijah Moshinsky and his design team have relocated the action to a vaguely African locale, the performance is so electric that one quickly accepts, the change -- done with the intelligence that always marks Moshinsky's work. Jon Vickers invests Samson with his customary sense of mission, his Heldentenor scaling the heights of Saint-Saens' writing to thrilling effect. Vickers also allows himself to be subject to some nerve-rattling abuse at the hands of the Philistines in Act III, a truly selfless performer. He faces a worthy seductress in Shirley Verrett, who demonstrates why she was preeminent in the role during the 1980s. She treads the fine line between love and hate, presenting both faces to Samson with equal conviction. Jonathan Summers' firm, dark baritone hits all targets at High Priest of Dagon and having Gwynne Howell as the Old Hebrew is a luxury touch. Continuing the embarrassment of riches is Colin Davis' conducting, which unveils many colors in Saint-Saens score that are often glossed over in the average performance. TV direction is top-notch. Shirley Verrett's other DVD Delilah, opposite Placido Domingo, has no shortage of merit but her teaming with Vickers is the stuff of which legends are made.
