2482375,4,B000E1OI58,"If you like old burlesque, this DVD is for you.  The dancing and costumes are classy and sexy.  This is not porn or dirty.  Enjoyable to watch.  Bette Page looks fabulous, however, she is not the star of either show.",1414454400,3,216,4.325
2482376,3,B000E1OI58,"It is just okay, not impressive. Boring actually!",1407369600,,49,5.25
2482377,5,B000E1OI58,"Irving Klaw was rightfully concerned with BS censorship of the time.  You won't see so much as a nip slip in either one of these videos.  Some creepy idiot still thought he had grounds for filing a legal complaint.  Surprisingly rational judge though the case out, and commented on the complainant.  Still enjoyable to watch & has some other vaudeville bits thrown in.",1401062400,3,368,4.7936507936507935
2482378,5,B000E1OI58,"a true look at burlesque, Fun and talent from a time of my parents generation, this shows the last look at a time where sexy women were just that, and how they put a show on for both men and women, that was still flashy but with a touch of innocence , where women were idolized and not belittled by ignorance. These gals were beautiful and smart, I was lucky to have seen a burlesque show at the ripe age of 16 and saw Blaze Starr and Tempest Storm, and learned to respect women while getting an eyeful of why they are the reason  we guys are so lucky to be guys.  This video is well worth having. a 10 out of 10",1385164800,7,612,3.967479674796748
2482379,5,B000E1OI58,"this definitive look at 1950's raunchy cabaret's that
features an assortments of busty ladies in an range
of provocative and exotic themed costumes to go
with the routines any routine from an Hawaiian
hula dancer to an sensational belly dancer I came
across the footage on an English documentary dvd
titled video nasties :THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE where
they focused on the culture aspects on various
types of horror and sexual violence and why only
39 titles came under the dpp and film censorships
scrutiny lead under the late English prime minister
Margaret thatcher but I have seen taster clips of
varietease and teaserama on the dvd and to say this
was pre playboy era type of titillation only made
for adult cinemas from the 50's-80's before censorship
came.
REVIEW QUOTE:this was pre playboy era type of titillation-Frankie(cool rider) smales

2482380,4,B000E1OI58,"Considering the footage is from the 50's and was filmed without a big budget, this is certainly worth it's money if nothing else for the historical value - or at least thats what I told my wife  ;-)",1375488000,,198,4.2105263157894735
2482381,5,B000E1OI58,"Buy this one just for fun! Corny? Shlocky? Yes but that's what makes it fun! Low budget? Cheap sets? Yes but that's what makes it fun! Don't buy this for skin-skinflick it ain't. I'd venture to say you probably wouldn't have to hide this one-you'd see more on a day at the beach or pool, but again that's what makes it fun. The girls are pretty (especially Betty-she's just so CUTE!). A couple of high points- the dancer/contortionist; how does she do that? Also-the dance team-he's in a fancy tux and she's in a full green dress- they are a riot! These are both just a great look back in time. They are both in surprisingly good shape with just enough grainyness or imperfections to retain the feel of the time period, especially when you consider the low budgets that these were shot under. Buy 'em, enjoy 'em, I don't think you'll be disappointed!",1282953600,13,850,4.525974025974026
2482382,3,B000E1OI58,"These films are not masterpieces, but are indeed fit for a burlesque time-capsule. They are basically filmed stage productions, including burlesque, music and comedy. There are stripteases here from legends such as Bettie Page, Lily St. Cyr and Tempest storm. They are not crass, there is no nudity - only titillating lingerie scenes at the most, and the comedy is probably cringe worthy by contemporary standards. They make for delightful viewing and are great nostalgia.",1266278400,5,472,5.306666666666667

8104329,4,B000E1OI58,These two videos let me see how Bettie looks in movement instead of just seeing her in a still photograph. I only wish Bettie had been shown more on the video. The parts that have her in it shows that she is even more beautiful than she is in her photos.,1432771200,3,254,4.0
