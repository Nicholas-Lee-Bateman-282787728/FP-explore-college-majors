Over the 5 or 7 year interval, (5 years according to the scripts, but 7 according to broadcast dates) Bob had matured and also developed aspirations further up the class ladder. Terry remained stuck not only in his class but also in the attitudes which had prevailed 5/7 years earlier. This gives rise to situations which are both witty and perceptive.",1473465600,,503,4.929411764705883
8135076,3,B000GY788W,"Moderately amusing but must be viewed before ""When the Boat Comes In,"" if you can arrange that. In both series Jack Bolam plays a young man who rubs most people the wrong way, but in this one he is mostly a shallow jerk, whereas in the other he is a man of exceptional character who is an extraordinary leader. Those who watched the two series as they came out must have been pleasantly surprised by Bolam's ability to play a strong character. Having first watched ""When the Boat Comes In "" around 1990 and again this year, I expected to enjoy a light comedy that featured him. The inversion of his on-screen character was an unpleasant surprise. Take this personal review for what it's worth, but attend to this:

If you can find a copy, be sure to watch ""When the Boat Comes In."" It is one of the most thoughtful series ever broadcast on either side of the Atlantic and also thoroughly enjoyable, if also occasionally, and appropriately, bleak.",1436313600,,946,4.564705882352941
