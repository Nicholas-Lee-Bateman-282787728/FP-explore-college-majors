It's unbelievable, subtitles are obviously made by Google-Translate, they just don't make any sense. Picture is cut out on both sides (you see only S from SBS logo) (no widescreen) and above and below too - might be good, Korean TV series tend to be taken directly from the broadcasting together with all ads and info going on the downbar, so you at least don't see this. Also some dvds are not sharp (anywhere near), sometimes audio is not in sync with video. And they even want money for this! Such a good series. Don't recommend to anyone!",1311552000,,643,4.649122807017544
8443448,2,B0033OATY2,"I'm assuming that I've bought the original not the pirated DVD.
The worst subtitle that I've ever seen in my whole life.
It simply does not make any sense.
Spellings all wrong. I can translate better than this.
Whoever does this and put it out on world market.
Sucks!!! Total embarrassment.
All and all picture quality is OK although there are couple shady ones.
Don't recommend to anyone.
Too bad ... It's such a good drama.",1289606400,2,425,4.605263157894737
