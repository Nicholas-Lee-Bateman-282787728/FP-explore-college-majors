606867,3,6303241387,"The kids all want to enlist; they're bitten by the war bug. However, they're all too young, so they do their part by harassing a local Asian who owns a store. It turns out, he isn't even Japanese; he's Chinese, and he is murdered in his store. The kids feel so bad, they take it upon themselves to find his killer, and run into an underground ring of Japanese spies.

The picture quality on this film isn't great, and neither is the sound quality. After all, these films were made by a very low level company.

Normally Leo Gorcey stands out, but Huntz Hall really steals the show. His kleptomania and great zingers really liven up the film. He certainly doesn't get the credit he deserves as a comedian.",1195689600,,704,4.449612403100775
606868,2,6303241387,"After the Dead End Kids and before the Bowery Boys, there were the East Side Kids: Leo ""Muggs"" Gorcey, Huntz ""Glimpy"" Hall, and Bobby ""Danny"" Jordan-along with Ernie ""Sunshine Sammy"" Morrison as ""Scruno,"" the token black member of the gang-starred in a series of rough-and-tumble action-comedies set in New York's Lower East Side (but actually shot at the lowly Monogram Pictures studio in Hollywood) that combined the dramatics of the Dead End films with the knockabout slapstick of the Bowery epics. These cheaply produced, quickly made films (in which much of the dialogue was improvised) proved popular with moviegoers and were run repeatedly on local TV stations for years.

If nothing else, the East Side Kids movies were a product of their era, which is why, in these Politically Correct times, you're not likely to see LET'S GET TOUGH! (1942) turn up on television anytime soon. In this flag-waving World War II entry, the East Side Kids tangle with a Japanese spy ring that has ties to Nazi infiltrators. As you might expect, the racial epithets fly fast and free, though perhaps no moreso than any other patriotic war-themed production of the '40s.

This Alpha Video edition is typical of many of the East Side Kids movies available on DVD: transferred from a used 16mm print (splices, scratches), with scenes edited out (for TV?). There's no ""Digital Restoration"" going on here.

The East Side Kids movies are, at best, a pleasant diversion, though they were never as funny as the later Bowery Boys efforts. LET'S GET TOUGH! is not one of the better ESK entries; fans of this team will want to see it, but it's of little interest to anyone else.",1132358400,4,1656,4.865248226950355
606869,3,6303241387,"While the film used to make this DVD has lines and splices, it is sharp and clear.  When you see the story content you will understand why.

Made during WWII, the boys talk about killing Japanese.  This film was pulled from Television syndication a while back, so the only original prints around are a bit old.

In comparison, try to find a copy of the 3 STOOGES anti-Japanese film ""THE YOKES ON ME"".  Japanese owned Columbia will not release that through their Sony DVD division.

Take this film in its historic context and watch a rare piece of 1940's B-Hollywood influenced by the war.",1109808000,3,588,4.605769230769231

The East Side Kids (Leo Gorcey, Bobby Jordan, Huntz Hall, Sunshine Sammy Morrison, David Gorcey, Bobby Stone) want to join the U.S. Army, but they have to be 21 years of age.  (In real life, they all were over 21 except for Bobby Jordan and Bobby Stone who were almost).  Not even the whiskers worked.  So they went to the U.S. Marines.  The muscles didn't work. Too young.  So they go to the U.S. Navy.  Smoking cigars didn't work.  The japenese small business owners don't really care for the East Side Kids because thay are trouble makers.  They like to throw eggs at store front businesses.  Phil Ahn (Kung Fu tv series 1972-75 as ""Master Po"") plays the bad guy, Joe.  While they go to Miss Keno to apologize to her for the damages they made, they see Joe make an exchange with Miss Keno.  Later at the hide-out, Huntz Hall had taken a pen as a ""souvenir"".  The pen won't work, but he finds a mysterious note inside.  Leo does a trick he learned from correspondence college.  They discover a secret message.  They go to Matsui's Tea Shop to interpret the message.  mat sui tries tio take it, but Leo says ""no stealing"".  Matsui then releases a small dagger and kills himself.  The boys run to Policeman Pop (Robert Armstrong) to tell him.  They all go back to Matsui's Tea Shop.  The old man is alive, or is he?  Policeman Pop is angry at the boys.  The boys go back to Matsui's.  The old man is gone now.  Huntz steals a bag of tea.  Outside, the boys discover in the bag, it is not tea, it is not sugar, it's magnesium.  Can the boys uncover this spy ring and catch the crook, Joe?  Gabriel Dell appears in this one.  The next film in the series: SMART ALECKS (1942).",1079654400,3,1696,4.329073482428115

This is clearly dated but is fun to see how bored kids get into trouble and cause it. The boys decided to rough up a local they deem Japanese they find he was Chinese. The man is later found dead and the gang is drug into a murder. When a piece of paper in Japanese has a clue. They end up sneaking into a closed store which has a meeting of the 5th Columnists (ENEMY SPIES) planning some espionage. This is silly and funny.

606927,2,6303241387,"The premise here:  the East Side Kids vs. Axis spies is pretty cool. I'd have loved to have seen it well executed. Unfortunately that doesn't happen here.

  I cut the East Side Kid movies a lot of slack where production values and plot coherence are concerned because I usually find them very entertaining anyway. For me, the best part of these movies is the humorous interaction between the characters and sometimes the goofy, even improbable storylines. This movie though, is not funny, and it's only marginally entertaining at best. Most of the humor either feels forced or plain just doesn't work.

  So what's good about this one? I do like that when the boys realized the error of their ways they didn't just apologize but took action to make up for their mistake. In that sense this movie shows some of the heart for which the series is known. Robert Armstrong is good in his tiny role and Florence Rice has a great smile.  Overall, while it did have a little heart, it lacked fun and seemed too forced or rushed.",1294963200,,1021,4.602209944751381

World War 2.....too young to enlist the ""East Side Kids"".....decide to pick on Keno and toss some tomatoes at his widows. They believe he is a ""Jap""/ Japanese. They later find him murdered.

They show scenes of a WW I parade of soldiers, made to look like that year. The Boys decide to join the Army. Do they have proof of their age? They try the Marines. No birth certificates? They go to the Navy while smoking cigars; that doesnt work. Their comments show their prejudice against an Oriental. [The background scenes tell of a bygone era of small shop owners, no corporate chains. There is a violin lesson [for laughs]. The Boys break into a store to vandalize it! They find the owner, but he doesnt talk. Pop Stevens takes them to the police station, they are in trouble. Next we see foreign agents plotting to accomplish their mission. The Boys read The Bill of Rights. [When was the last time you read it?] They are taught a lesson against prejudice. [The views of this movie.]

Phil Connors was Dishonorably Discharged for Subversive Activity! [A clue here?] The Boys sell goods to pay for their vandalism. [The prices date this movie. Notice the editing of some scenes?] The Boys find a blank piece of paper hidden in a pen. Is there a hidden message? [Dont you wish you understood the language?] The note is shown to Mr. Matsui, with fatal consequences. Muggs goes to the police, they investigate the report. [What happened?] Can the Boys act as Junior G-Men? What is that bitter white powder? Phil was rejected by his girl Nora, then hits Danny. Can they get that message translated? That white powder causes a fire! Its put out with a s pray of water! Magnesium in a paper bag? Miss Stevens visits Matsuis Tea Co to ask Joe about note. She knows too much and is captured. But this is observed. The Boys are told what happened. They go to investigate Heinbachs Used Goods store.

The Boys pile up boxed in the back to reach a window so Muggs can reach a window. The others follow into a room. Is there a trap door? They find a hidden door. They see men in black hoods leave another room. Tie him up quick! Two strange men arrive. The gang starts their meeting. The plotters tell of their aims, there is a blood oath. There are spies among us, remove your hood! There is a chase! Phil drops his cover. The police are called for a showdown. Phil gets his orders to report immediately!

This is an about average story, some scenes were cut for one reason or another. Is the warning against prejudice too subtle for the audience? It probably wouldnt register then. This story is an example of wartime propaganda. I once read that the Army sent soldiers who were political to a camp in the Mid-West for isolation. Was the Army afraid of their effect on apolitical recruits? It shows the problem for those work undercover. A member of the OSS parachuted into war-time Yugoslavia to aid Titos Partisans. He joined their political party. Years later this was used against him when he was a Hollywood movie star.",1471046400,,2848,4.535019455252918
