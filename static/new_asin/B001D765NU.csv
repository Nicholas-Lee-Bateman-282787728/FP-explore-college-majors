I think Big Sister 2000 came about something like this.

# hypothetical

Once upon a time a porn producer rented a location and some film equipment for a week in the hopes of shooting 5 typical sex movies.

After successfully completing his filming on Friday afternoon a full day ahead of schedule he throws a party for the cast and crew. Everyone gets stone drunk by 3:00 AM and someone suggests they should do another movie on Saturday. A script is written, roles are assigned and locations selected all before dawn.

Filming started at 10:00 AM when everyone was still hung over and barely awake and ended at sunset. All editing was done that same night while sharing some more alcohol and good vibes.

Big Sister 2000 is what you would expect in a movie that was made this way.

Note that there is no mention of plot or characters in my review. This is consistent with the movie which also lacks both.
PS: I watched it a 3rd time just to revel in the share audacity of the producers, for releasing this.",1374537600,,1184,4.55188679245283
8291997,3,B001D765NU,"I am a big Julie Strain fan but this is not one of her better movies. This movie is a little on the cheesie side to say the lest. There is a fair share of skin like in most of her movies. But the acting is pretty bad and the budget was pretty low as well. It would have been nice to have seen more of Jill Kelly nude, but oh well. You might be able to call it a cult classic depending on your tastes.",1333670400,,400,3.6627906976744184
8291998,2,B001D765NU,"Could have used a lot more female nudity! Full frontal at the beginning of the flick, but doesn't last long. Could have been so much more but can't recommend this flick. Julie Strain should have been naked the whole time. Would have been more convincing on her part. Oh well.

Not Recommended!",1234396800,4,293,4.634615384615385
