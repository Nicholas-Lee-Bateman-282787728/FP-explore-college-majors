4906467,1,B002XUSJQ2,"This DVD is 30 minutes of amateur comment, photography, very poor production quality and is of NO VALUE to any visitor to Bermuda.

Amazon should reconsider selling this DVD.",1267833600,3,174,5.0

8489314,4,B002XUSJQ2,"Very good video with great ideas; however, it is old so I'm not sure how accurate things are. I did give a good idea of accommodations, things to do and basic island history.",1465257600,,174,4.303030303030303

8489319,2,B002XUSJQ2,"This was more of a travel guide than a documentary, which maybe we should have expected from the title.  Bermuda has a kind of magic that was not captured by the camera or the narrative.  Certainly, more could have been done to present this lovely place as the truly unique destination that it is.",1434758400,,297,4.481481481481482
8489320,4,B002XUSJQ2,"Even though this is an older video (and doesn't have the brilliant colors of HD), this is a lovely travelogue with a lot of history and tips for enjoying Bermuda.  The presenter is very low key & makes the destination the focus, not his own personality.  And if you are looking for a lift in the middle of a very cold, snowy winter, this video will help!  I would also like to recommend Sir Trevor McDonald's Secret Caribbean series (available in Prime) as not only a good travel documentary, but also a wonderful escape from the winter blahs.",1424131200,,543,4.520408163265306
8489321,2,B002XUSJQ2,"This is a video made by Grand Circle tours, which caters to those over 50. It is 30 minutes long with no subtitles - a bad choice for the over 50 crowd.
The volume goes up and down, especially when they interview tourists or others on the island and most of the time it is very soft even at the highest level.

Part of it is outdated - it describes cruise ships stopping at Hamilton and St George which most if not all do not do now, since they are too big. They anchor at the Navy Yard.

There are some interesting facts regarding the fact that outsiders are virtually kept from purchasing property unless it is over the million mark and there are some nice photos of the island and suggestions for places to visit; but other than a general introduction this is not done very well.",1408752000,,782,4.277027027027027
8489322,2,B002XUSJQ2,A lot has changed in Bermuda since this Video was produced in 2004. Nice for the scenery and history only.,1375488000,,106,4.35
