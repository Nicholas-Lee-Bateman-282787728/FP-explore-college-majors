5426559,5,B00AIBZFDI,"My title is not to imply that part 1 was a bad movie, it felt like most indie flicks. But that's really the most I can say about it. You could really tell it was a relatively low budget movie.

Part 2 manages to give a much stronger ""film"" feeling. The camera work was much improved and the dialogue felt much more fluid than in part 1. The actors were all great, and some improved upon their predecessors in part 1. Jason Beghe embodied the strong-willed, stoic Rearden (Once you get past the initial shock of his smoker voice). And Esai Morales especially captured the playboy, energetic, seemingly cocky Francisco.

The CGI was very TV quality, but it's only used in a couple scenes and only to drive the story forward, so it wasn't too distracting. Still, the opening flashback/final scene was a little difficult to swallow, being so clearly CGI.

I'd have to say, I was surprised that my favorite role was Diedrich Bader playing Quentin Daniels. Bader's history of silly characters had me skeptical when I saw his name in the cast, but just a few seconds of screen time quelled that easily. It's a shame really that his character only has a few scenes, since he really shows his acting skills here.

Overall, if you've seen part 1, I think you will be pleased to continue the story with this addition to the trilogy. And if you haven't seen part 1, this movie actually attempts to stand alone, as it has an entirely new cast (with the exception of a cameo screenshot of a character from part 1), and also recaps the major events of part 1 through dialogue.

Final word: Watch it, it's worth it. It might not be the perfect adaptation of this famous controversial classic, but it's enjoyable. The characters are believable, and there are even a few laughs at the expense of the villains. Which more movies could do with.",1357603200,18,1824,4.565749235474006
5426560,5,B00AIBZFDI,"A great movie! It was even better than ""ATLAS SHRUGGED PART ONE.""  As the author of ""21ST-CENTURY COMMON SENSE"" the liberal intellectuals have always considered me a ""mentally challenged radical for capitalism.""  so perhaps, my review is tainted by my political views and my understanding of the role of tyranny in history.  For that, I have Ayn Rand to thank!",1357516800,45,360,4.966666666666667
5426561,1,B00AIBZFDI,"Horrible acting, if you want to call it that. Pathetic screenwriting (one wonders if he ever read the book) and beyond amateurish direction.

5426562,5,B00AIBZFDI,"I went to see Atlas Shrugged, Part 2, at one of my local theaters the day of its first showing.  The film is a pretty accurate reflection of the direction our Nation is taking.  Little wonder that the movie makes Hollywood critics and D.C. politicians uncomfortable.  The film reveals what they really are and what they are about.  The characters are believable, the acting is supurb, and the plot ties into current events very well.  I'm looking forward to Part 3.",1357257600,163,465,4.691358024691358
5426563,5,B00AIBZFDI,"This is Part 2 of the Atlas Shrugged series; and it's a powerful continuation of Atlas Shrugged Part 1.  I viewed this when it was released into theatres.

This part depicts the United States' further decline into the depths of economic despair.  And it shows how increasing government oppression causes the decline to accelerate, even as more and more producers and innovators disappear from industry.

The acting is good to very good.  Samantha Mathis brings a more dynamic range of acting skills to Dagny Taggert.  Jason Beghe is first rate in his role as Hank Rearden, and Esai Morales is exceptional in his role as Francisco d'Anconia.  In fact, I must say that these three are much better suited to their roles, especially at this point in the story.  For example, Hank Readen's speech before the court was much more forceful, I think, than if it were rendered by Grant Bowler.

The camera work, computer graphics, scripting, and cinematography are all first rate.

There's nothing that comes close to this story.  It is an in-your-face depiction of liberty vs. tyranny, and how an overbearing government impoverishes, and then destroys everyone.  I guarantee you'll either love it or hate it, but you won't be neutral.

True to form, the critics bestowed even more hate than they did on Part 1.  And yet, the audience seemed to enjoy this even more - for at the film's ending, they stood and applauded!  And cheered!

This is a great film and a great story.  I highly recommend it.",1357084800,319,1488,4.7952755905511815

Samantha Mathis is hard to compare to Taylor Schilling in the first one, but she pulls off the job respectably.  Some of the writing is a little overwrought and simplistic.  Of course this is essentially a morality tale celebrating the greatness of economic libertarianism, which is in line with many of the ideals I hold, so I enjoyed it.  However, I couldn't recommend it as a must see on it's own production merits.

The special effects are a joke. But I get it, the movie is more of a just a project, not really a serious blockbuster effort.

There is repetition in message, and the implausibility? It's Ayn Rand. That explains it all.

I actually loved the novel the Fountainhead even though I am not a Rand fan.

The cast from this one is not noticeably better than the first one.

Samantha Mathis got better in the role as the movie went on. Mathis is the daughter is the late actress Bibi Besch. Bibi was a great dramatic actress. Samantha? Not as much, but she did the job. I thought Taylor Schilling did a good job in the first one.

I can't really compare it to Part 1 because Part 2 has a completely different cast of actors, etc. so continuity is skewed. I enjoyed both Parts 1 and 2, but Part 2 definitely has the bigger budget look (i.e. more CGI). I'm not sure which film I liked better. Many others have debated which is the better cast, director, etc. but I think there is some decent acting in both. However, after seeing the first film, it took me a while to adjust to the new cast. Upon second viewing, I was accepting of them.

Let's face it, it's a tough job to make all the details and depth of the novel fit into a film. People who've read the book will understand the story and characters better --- and will either hate the film by comparison to the book, or (like me) enjoy seeing how the book has now been turned into a film. People who have never read the book will probably not follow the plot well enough, and there's not really a lot of ""action"", so they may not like it.

As a film, it's had to be simplified a lot, and characters are very one-dimensional (as in most films). It looks more like a very good, high budget made-for-TV movie than a proper film release. There is far too much usage of ""Who is John Galt?"", as other reviewers have commented. I won't say anything about the story itself, so as not to give anything away.

I've heard mixed reviews on how the film did in theatres, mixed reviews by fans and critics, and that they lost a lot more money on Part 2. Personally, I'm looking forward to Part 3 being made. I'm curious to see how they'll end the film trilogy and how much continuity it will have from Part 2 --- will it be another new cast? Who knows.",1455494400,,1899,4.180327868852459

5426883,3,B00AIBZFDI,"What the? I have to say, the casting was better in this movie as I don't think James Taggart was supposed to be a stronger character than Hank Readon as was the case in Part 1. I mean No offense to Samantha Mathis but Taylor Schilling owned the part in the first movie. This movie was made with half the budget, a different tone and director and like Parts 1 and 3, it lost money which is not something I think Ayn Rand would have approved of. If you can get this for 6 or 7 bucks, go ahead. I wasn't that bad. I saw Part 3, and it was really needing some budget money. For die hard Ayn Rand believers, I know some of you can suspend disbelief and enjoy this, while I've seen others pan this rush job. Still, I soldiered on. For me, Ayn Rand has that appeal that alot of undiscovered artists can relate to, but economically, the vision of the future from 1957 just isn't there except for the Pre-Dystopian landscape that we see now. An ironic contradiction to this painfully modern point of view. But, I will give this chapter of the series credit as some missing ordinary craftsmen and train schedulers had their worth, and not just some banker named Midas.",1452729600,,1158,4.31651376146789

5427289,3,B00AIBZFDI,"Atlas Shrugged Part 2

 We have a new director and an entirely new cast with part two of the Atlas Shrugged saga.  Director John Putch has 48 mostly TV credits on his sheet.  The new cast, like the old cast, are all solid pros if not famous pros.  Of the three writers both Duke Sandefun and Duncan Scott are new to the series.  Only Brian Patrick O'Toole had a hand in writing the first episode.  That, and the inherent difficulty with the plodding pace of the original Ayn Rand novel present problems for any film makers.
  But the movie as a movie isn't really the point.  The object is to expose the public to the ideas of Ayn Rand.  Rand thought that people should be free to live and crate without a bossy government getting its nose in a person's business.  That's pretty hard to argue against as a philosophy.  We understand the distinction between tyranny and freedom, we are Americans.  We grew up with the idea of Give me Liberty or Give me Death.
 In the middle part of the series, the government tightens its grip on the lives and fortunes of the people, and not to their benefit.  Rand depicts the government as grasping for power for the sake of power.  Frequent shots of the people at large show increasing poverty and desperation.  The policies of the grasping rulers only accelerate the ills of the economy.  The government believes that the fruits of one man's labor should be reaped by those who know best how to devour said fruits, the governors themselves.  For Rand, this is little short of slavery and she wants no part of it.  It also does not work very well in real life, as we can see from examples of other nations currently, Greece for one.
 This film like its companions is best thought of as a stimulus for conversation.  How much of my lifes blood is the government entitled to take from me, if any?  If creative, driven, people are the spark plug of society, shouldn't we try to foster their creativity rather than stifle and thwart it?
 If we look at the society we now inhabit, we can easily see the problems that Ayn Rand brought forward in her thinking.  What to do?",1430179200,,2103,4.454068241469816

With several things going against them - the main being that this was a middle movie of a trilogy (you know you are not going to get ending) - they made a monumental error.  Not very well directed this film was not a stand alone film so to make people wait a year you know you are going to lose viewers.  Only series geared towards young adults and blockbusters (all retaining the same cast) have succeeded in this.  With a ten million dollar budget they only recouped about three and a half.  While being a good actress Samantha Mathis looked too old and a bit worn for the Taylor Schilling role.  If you had not seen the first installment you may have been confused and the end was unsatisfactory.  Critics and viewers were not happy with this.  Only recommended to watch are those determined to see the full trilogy.  The storyline continues with problems arising from politicians crushing free enterprises with new laws and regulations and people still vanishing.",1427155200,,1058,4.706521739130435

5427623,3,B00AIBZFDI,"It takes a lot of guts to try to make a movie out of this book---for several reasons. The first, of course, is the sheer length of the book, akin to War and Peace. The other, equally obvious, is that the philosophical and political message in the book/film is anathema to the leftist Politically Correct hyenas that infest Hollywood and the overall media.

Now as to the first film: many of the characters are excellent. Taylor Schilling is superb in coming across as a no-nonsense executive surrounded by mediocrities who are constantly sabotaging her. Grant Bowler is also good at being stiff upper lip as he, too, is surrounded by whining, evil mediocrities. His wife (can't remember the actress' name) is also good at coming across as a ball-busting bitch. There are a lot of good secondary character actors. There are some problems with the script, primarily in that it doesn't really drive home the message just how bad things are, a lot of crucial details are left out, and, that the problems are a worldwide phenomenon, as was the case in the book.

Now as to the second film: it was a shock to see the entire cast replaced and the script is worse. Taylor Schilling, howevever, was irreplaceable, yet she was and the film suffers as a result. Sometimes it seems as if the character actors are shouldering the film. In short, it is not as good as the first. It takes up after the Colorado oil fields are set on fire and ends when Dagny crashes her plane.

The third installment was bad, no getting around it. The cast in once again replaced and not even the character actors can hold up the film with a terrible script that wastes a lot of time in a love interest between Dagny and Galt.",1424649600,,1694,4.547540983606558

5427819,5,B00AIBZFDI,"My review is deeply coloured by knowing the book which i had as an audiobook from the library. So in effect this is the second dramatisation I have experienced. Certainly don't think I would have had the patience to 'read' the novel if it was the first exposure as I found Rand's book almost autistic and monumentally over explanatory, but oddly that is a large part of its spell. Usually i would say movie first, book after, but given the limited amount of screen time, even as a trilogy, I think one should listen to the book first to enjoy the visual version. The movie adaptation has had to struggle with her monolithic style, and I think the writers and new cast have done a wonderful job - this second installment shows they have learnt a lot on the job!. I loved the sets, the train interiors, the Galt motor sequences and the cgi plane chase ( less is more sometimes. ) It would be wonderful to see what they could do with a blokbuster budget and more time - HBO remake?",1420761600,,978,4.3791208791208796

I personally feel that it most important that this movie be true to the book, no matter how difficult to reconcile a futuristic book written during the 1950s with our current civilization.  The book is true to the spirit of the book, so the changed actors is forgiven.  This movie is likely entertaining only for those that ""get it"", the philosophy of Ayn Rand or the triumph of the individual mind over the collectivist philosophy and the brutish use of the muscle of the Statists.",1420588800,,550,4.649484536082475

It is eerie to know that the things you are watching on screen were the very same things she was afraid of, over 60 years ago. I recommend the trilogy if for nothing else to say you have watched it, and give you an example into her mind.

The change of actors for the Dagney character was disastrous; her portrayal and looks are more of someone who just woke up from too long at the trailer park bar the night before, her costuming awful, clothes ill fitting and her acting of a successful and powerful corporate woman unbelievable.

Galt's motor is cool and reminds us of all the so called free energy devices.

LOVED the book and was somewhat excited to see the movie - painfully finished the first one just out of curiosity, but it was terrible.  The 2nd one was even WORSE as the actors all changed and I didn't know who was who - at that point, I put the movie in the trash.

Don't get me wrong, the actors in book two did a find job, but they weren't quite right. The story line is fine I supposed, but having read the book, I was more interested in seeing how closely to the book the characters were portrayed. I wonder what they are going to do for Part III? I wouldn't mind if they changed the actors again, maybe we'll get a Dagny and Hank that were more like the first cast.",1411603200,,566,4.0625

And if one is tuned into the changes in political policy going on in governments throughout the world today one can't help but find empathy for those like Westinghouse, Tesla, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs who have vision, character, drive, and need to express their creativity. Then cometh the suits, the bean counters, the politicians, the bankers. The audacity, independence and success of the entrepreneur causes those who cling to the existing systems and seats of power to react. Out of jealousy and the lust to control, they willfully would and do kill the creative goose that lays the golden innovative products for society- toilets, refrigerators, phones, computers, efficient LED lighting, sewage treatment, solar panels. The history of this cycle repeats and repeats but school children and most adults are unfortunately bored by the lousy way history is taught, hence the importance of this unique movie, one written by a creative, world renowned female economist, out to share the truth about the value of the entrepreneur.",1411516800,,1056,5.254437869822485

5428679,2,B00AIBZFDI,"The sound was excellent as was filming. But this movie had amateurish graphics and poor research on the central industries, the railroad, whereas the steel factory seemed mostly accurate, with very good CG.

Seems that Hollywood doesn't have knowledgeable people to go to when creating trains or realistic railroad scenarios. There were more than  three major technical errors, besides the impossible jet plane maneuvers in the chase sequence. I've only seem two movies with accurate portrayals of trains in the last decade: ""The Lone Ranger,"" where the original locomotives are accurately replicated, and ""Unstoppable"" where appropriate contemporary trains were actually used. Most movie producers use the local train museums for their trains.

First, railroads don't have grades of 15-percent. No locomotive could go up that steep a grade, much less pulling a train. (Maybe a tourist cog loco up mountain.)

Second, a steam locomotive takes hours to get steamed up before operating, that's why in the big industrial junctions, an apprentice was assigned to keep the locomotives steamed for the next day's runs. He was also responsible that the pressure on his locomotives didn't get too high, and explode.

Third, a single steam locomotive of the type shown wouldn't have enough drawbar power to pull that many passenger cars on level track, much less in Colorado mountain lines.

Finally, in one scene a boxcar roof with ice hatches rolls down the video. Maybe a 1925 museum piece.

I gave it a second star for the actors portraying impossible characters. This film reminded me of student films that I've seen, created by beginning  college film students.

I read ""Atlas Shrugged"" years ago, and neither this part nor part one seemed an accurate portrayal.

The age thing isn't a big deal with the right actress, but the frumpyness is just offputting.

We see now about 1 1/2 trillion dollars parked in off show accounts to protect it from the voracious appetite of the government's over reach for new taxes and power over individual decision making.

5428815,1,B00AIBZFDI,"I awaited Atlas Shrugged part 1 with much anticipation.
I was disappointed.

I awaited Atlas Shrugged part 2 with much dread.
My darkest expectations were exceeded.

Frankly, the movie is terrible. That this wonderful, world-renowned book received such dismal treatment is criminal.

Building on the complete and utter failure of Part 1, part two continues the agony and adds to the amateurish fiasco by replacing the *entire* cast. Oh, there may have been one or two minor characters out there from the first part - but EVERY single major character is different than the first movie. I suppose if the screenplay and production were spellbinding you could overlook this, but it's neither.

I won't get into how badly this movie misses the target. That's something for Rand's die-hard defenders to argue about.

What *I* feel is most important is that Atlas Shrugged is an EPIC novel. One with a very important message and a very particular way of driving that message home. People who know and love this book will either hate this movie - or be lying to themselves. It's no reflection on Ayn Rand's work to say - this movie sucks.

The REAL tragedy here is that have been hearing ""You MUST read Atlas Shrugged"" from their friends for years - but couldn't bring themselves to crack an 1,100 page novel were thinking they could just watch the movie and save themselves the reading. WRONG! I'm sure those folks saw the movie and ask ""What? Was this supposed to be good or meaningful? What did you SEE in this book!?""

This movie is an affront to Ayn Rand. he producers NEVER should have attempted to make the movie because it is clear they don't have what it takes. It's amateurish, completely misses the mark on what it does present, and leaves out extremely important portions of the book.

This movie *deserved* a producer like Peter Jackson.

One can only HOPE that somebody with a little more ability and financial resources decides to re-make this movie and offer a faithful representation of the book.

Don't bother watching this movie. Please read the book. If you already watched - try to forget what you saw and - read the book.

If you JUST can't slog through the length and Rand's admittedly long-winded writing, then do the second best thing - get a ""books on tape"" - there is an abridged (8 hour) one that is actually fairly good and MUCH better than this terrible movie.

People who want to rag on me for this review - have at it. But please, lying to yourself is one thing, lying to everybody else is another thing entirely.",1394496000,6,2537,4.676404494382022

I haven't been to a walk in movie theater in decades but this summer when the final movie is released, I'll be the first in line and I intend to bring everyone I can round up!

You'll read reviews critical to the movies in relation to the book. This isn't unique to this book. No movie has ever lived up to it's book. Many of Ayn's fans boarder on fanatical. I'm a fan and have my ""Who is John Galt"" sticker attached to the rear window of my car. Very few will take the time to read through 1200 pages of Ayn's book. The message can be condensed considerably and that's why I bought these movies. I intend to send them to my kids and I'm encouraging them to send them on to their friends as well.

It's unfortunate those who elect idiot politicians from either major party are so unaware of what they're doing. Ask anyone who the latest American Idol is and they'll respond instantly. Ask them to name 3 signers of the Declaration of Independence and they'll stare at you in a stupor. If this describes your awareness of the country you live in, not only will the book be overwhelming to you, the message will be lost even in the abbreviated and entertaining movies. Please just stay home on election day and watch TV!

Ayn was a visionary. Today more than ever, her depiction of the corruption and incompetence in government is spot on. While the movers and shakers of American industry have not chosen the exact method of expressing their contempt for perverse government and regulation depicted in this tome, they have found other ways to express themselves. The result is the same, lower paying and fewer jobs, increasing civil unrest, moral decline... All leading to a hopeless political cycle of social and economic purgatory. Economics is a science, not a theatrical affair than can be manipulated by mindless words and promises to the proletariat in exchange for votes. When those who are willing to spend the time and energy creating products and services and the jobs that are required to bring these to market are not rewarded for their efforts, the economic outcome is tragic; businesses close, people loose their jobs and their assets, families collapse...

5428886,1,B00AIBZFDI,"The best, most succinct review I can give is to quote what someone said about Ayn Rand's book: ""There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year olds life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves Orcs.

You smile when some of the industry leaders actually do follow their conciouses and oblige the government.

In the movie adaptation of the famous Rand novel Part I, feeling less like a cinematic event and more like a television mini-series, still drove the important and politically messy and relational points home.  Actress Taylor Schilling who plays lead character Dagny Taggart was pitch perfect as the cold-as-ice businesswoman compelled to find the answer of ""Who is John Galt"" refrain as well as forge her way through the political muck and mire to keep her families business as her families business.  Part II here drops the ball by (1) turning this into more of a conventional thriller and (2) by changing actresses to Samanthis Mathis who just doesn't possess the cold, driven faculty that Schilling was able to convey.  Part II feels a bit like a mess, trying to heighten tension in more typical Hollywood fashion, rather than allowing the ideas to really compel the viewer.  I'll still watch part III (if they ever produce it...) but part II here made me frustrated with the loss of an actress who fit the part nicely and moved toward Hollywood clich.  2.75 stars.",1390176000,3,1205,4.797101449275362

Trying to communicate those in a movie, even one necessarily broken into parts to accommodate the scope of the source material, loses something in the translation.

I, too, liked Part I and thought the cast change an obstacle the movie could never hurdle. But, after about ten minutes, I had accepted the cast change. They all do a good job.

And, I have to say, Part II is better written, with more memorable lines and even more humor.

Some of the scenes are simplistic to silly (like the Hank Reardon court-scene and the Lear jet chase scene)but I took them as symbolic, rather than attempts at realism.

Overall, it's not bad. More than not bad; it's good. Definitely worth seeing.

When the DVD started, and I didn't recognize any of the actors, I stopped the DVD and looked it up on-line to be sure that I had received the correct DVD. I suppose there was a good reason for changing actors for all of the primary roles in the middle of the story, but I can't imagine what it was. It was very disconcerting, to say the least. Once I picked up the story line again, I waited to be swept up into the world of Ayn Rand, but I found the characters to be wooden and the dialogue to be pretentious and awkward. The Rearden and D'anconia actors were okay in their roles, but the new Dagney Taggart lacked the gravitas and presence of the original.

The line ""Who is John Galt"" was heard much more often, but with little explanation or clue as to the answer... The heavy-handed government bureaucrats, seizing the means of production and limiting the output of factories, are universally unlikeable (Rand would like this portrayal.) The special effects, particularly the flying scene, were definitely low budget. Though the film was probably fairly representative of the plot in Rand's book, I don't think the author would have been particularly pleased with this rendition. Nevertheless, I will probably view the third installment when it finally arrives, just to see if the screen writers are able to wrap this up effectively and maintain the integrity of Ayn Rand's dystopian view of society.",1384128000,,1495,4.772200772200772

I drove a friend and his family to see the premier showing in Annapolis, MD.  Included was his 16 year old daughter.  During the trip she and I were discussing altruism, government entitlements, personal risk and profit.  She professed the typically Utopian views of naive youth, including how unfair it is for businesses to make large profits.  I tried to explain that those profits are the essential motivations for those business owners to do what they do ""for"" us, and how it is also a reward for the total risk that business owners take just to start.  She listened, but was unswayed.

After the movie ended, and while we drove home I asked her what she thought of it.  Her curious response really surprised me.  She said, ""It was the most terrifying movie I've ever seen"".

A little off balance by her response, I asked why?  She replied instantly:

""BECAUSE IT COULD HAPPEN!!!""

It should be required viewing for American students and anyone who thinks big, ""all powerful"", government can micromanage business and industry successfully.  While the movie is based upon a fiction novel, one should keep in mind that Ayn Rand had the benefit of watching the failure of eight 5-year plans in a row in the Soviet Union.  Soviet central planners were never able to operate their economy profitably and created 70 years of misery for the population with severe shortages of even basic needs. Russian rulers were tyrannical, whether they were czars or commissars, and the common people had been trained to obey them over centuries of subjugation.  Rand prophesied that if such an authoritarian style of central government were attempted in the United States of America, freedom loving entrepreneurs, inventors, engineers, and other patriots would refuse to support it and it would collapse.

5429198,3,B00AIBZFDI,"The new actress playing Dagny Taggart is a big disappointment. I also found it particularly disappointing

to see somebody like Teller show up in a cameo appearance. There were other actors also, well known from

SciFi that should have been avoided. One of the great things about a new movie like this is to use

unknown or less known actors. Well known actors always pull the focus away from the story. Here the

director could not be true to the story at all using popular actors.

Dagny was just awful. Slow witted, boring and lack-luster. I can imagine her managing a dog grooming

business, maybe, but not a railroad. She couldn't even hold a power drill properly when she was at her

cabin. The actor from CSI Miami and who played Kip Chalmers was not bad but got killed off pretty quick,

thankfully. Others were not so lucky and I had to watch them ply their craft to a distraction from the

real story.

The actress who played Cheryl was acceptable but the one who played Hank Reardon's wife, Lillian, was

even worse than Dagny. The previous actress in part 1 was superb, playing that nasty, devious controlling

shrew well. This one from part 2, I can't imagine anyone like Reardon ever marrying her in the first

place. No personality, and dumpy as well. Bad scenes, poor drama, no story tension at all and quite slow pace.

Overall I get the impression that those who funded this second movie, insisted that their friends or

relatives, or unemployed actors they knew, were selected in exchange for funding. Even the tiny role

Teller played smelled of a ""favor"". Why put him in there?

No cigar for part 2 as far as I'm concerned. And if this same director or somebody like him does part 3

then those who know what the story is really about will be laughing. Even with part 2, most people don't

know what's really at stake in the telling of the tale. Another commenter said it well. The story is

about ""competence"". I don't see much of that in part 2.",1379894400,,1968,4.521246458923513

5429240,5,B00AIBZFDI,"The courtroom scene really had impact. Without being a spoiler for those that have not viewed part two this was a compelling dissertation between a panel of judges and a steel company billionaire. It showed the effects of tyrannical law called the Fare Share  Act. We are talking about Socialistic principles at the core of this judicial argument. Simply put everything done should be for the good of the collective. Individualism and ownership is punished and all production belongs to the state as the owner/overseer and distributor. Government intervention and interference are the new norm. That is just a primer of what the movie is about.
It was an excellent fictional story with a serious message told by an honest Russian Emigrant named Ayn Rand now post humus. She lived through the Bolshevik Revolution before escaping to the U.S. Who is more qualified to recognize the Marxist phenomenon incrementally creeping into the U.S. culture than a first hand witness from the first Communist country.. She recognized the direction this country was headed back in the 30's and has been active throughout her life trying to warn us of a titanic economic and personal event looming over the horizon. Most of her thinking was philosophically uncommon yet common sense principles with endorsements from people as high in the economic world as Alan Greenspan in the 50's and 60's. . If you ever asked the question; Whats wrong with Socialism? this movie will demonstrate those principles with a modern twist.

5429305,1,B00AIBZFDI,"The cliff hangar combined with having enjoyed the book brought me to watch Part 2, and am I glad I did. One of the best parts of this movie is that I got to play a game where I tried to figure out who the hell everyone is since none of the actors from Part 1 seemed to want to be in Part 2. Dagny Taggart looks similar, Henry Reardon went from being a blonde model to a gravelly-voiced normal guy, Dagny's work friend went from being a small guy with an afro to a bald linebacker, Wesley Mouch transformed from an old heavy guy with great hair to a bald 40-something with a stupid goatee (who votes for a guy with a goatee; honestly?), James Taggart metamorphosized from a twerpy little ball sac to a guy who may actually be able to defend himself (physically, not in character), and Francisco D'Anconia went from being a really tall, broad shouldered, lazy-eyed second or third generation American to Esai Morales, who's awesome, but what's going on over here?

Lillian Reardon is unrecognizable as well; I thought she was Miss. Scarlet from the Clue movie, who was totally hot, but I then realized that it's unlikely that Marty McFly was sharing his time machine that day, given that Clue was released in 1985.

This movie is terrible from the beginning. In the first 10 minutes we are at James Taggart's wedding where he marries the convenience store clerk. Movies are very time-sensitive, so I can forgive the skipping of their courtship, but this is where Francisco D'Anconia gives his money speech. In the book, he is having a discussion with other people where everyone is taking part in it, albeit just to help the beliefs of Ayn Rand move along; it was good enough that I noted the page and went back to read it a few years later. In the movie, he interrupts the groom's speech after 5 seconds and looks like a rude jerk in front of everyone. It sets a proper tone for the movie, and you should let this adjust whatever standard you have for how good this film is going to be.

Later on, Dagny and Henry are travelling all over the country trying to find the person who built the great engine. It's hilarious as they literally fly all over the place instead of picking up the phone to make an appointment, or to see if anyone is even home, or writing an email.

The best part of this movie was in the muscle that Tom Wilson brought to the cast as a member of the board of the railroad. He might have had one line and two scenes (one of which was slow motion walking!). And I think that that really sums up how good this movie is.",1377043200,2,2538,4.3594080338266386

5429307,5,B00AIBZFDI,There are so many things in this movie that are getting closer and closer to real life. It is not hard to believe that our government will get more and more controlling and start telling the people and businesses how to run their lives. Ayn Rand was considered a crazy person by many in the 50s but her insight in many ways is becoming a reality. I like the movie for that reason since I remember Ayn Rand on a TV interview when I was a kid and she was basically shunned. If things keep going the way they are going she will be considered in history as not so crazy.,1376784000,,566,4.108108108108108

5429338,5,B00AIBZFDI,"Part 1 was a beautifully produced movie.  So was this one, but it looks very different.  Visually, it strongly reminds me of an extreme alternate universe episode of Stargate Atlantis.  (Including Mr. Woolsey, almost Dr. McKay and almost a ZPM.)

The producers had to try to convert the second third of the 1200 pound (or is that page) book into a 2 hour story and seemed to do an excellent job.  (I never read the book.  Never even picked it up.)  If you haven't read the book because of what you think it is, then you owe it to yourself to at least see the movie.  It is a good story (although the same themes certainly could be better told by Joss Whedon) and, much like the bible, it is referenced by people through-out our society everyday whether you (or they) know it or not.

Story-wise, this is a middle piece.  (Imagine Empire Strikes Back without Star Wars.)  You should see part 1 first.  Part 1 looks like it could have been ""Best Picture"" of 1964.  Part 2 looks like a 2013 movie with the CGI to match.  (In the extras, it's actually shocking to find out that some of the bigger scenes were 95% real and only 5% CGI, much like the hovercraft scenes in Serenity.)  Both parts are worth watching.

Some of the actors were changed out from their roles in the first part but this does not detract from the story.
  If you want a different point of view on what is happening with the economy and why nobody manufactures things in the USA anymore then I Highly suggest you watch part 1 first then this sequel.
  The author of Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand, was a child during the Russian revolution and her family fled to the USA. Through her family's experiences in early Soviet Russia, she writes a fictional story predicting the same economic collapse Russia experienced due to an overbearing yet well intentioned government.

It is a great work, but it is only one third of what probably will be a three-part-three video set.  The non-existent (yet) third section is where Rand's message comes together.  Until then, neither of the first two parts comes together in a truly comprehensible manner.  But it was a good try.

One last comment:  Changing the characters from segment to segment is very distracting.  The actors chosen do good jobs, and though the parts still make up only two-thirds of an important whole, their work is astonishingly close to the characters in the book.  The trougle is that, while the Fountainhead stands on its own, and the apologetic is finally crystallized in Roark's speech to the court.  In that film, I was never sure that Cooper or the others really understood the vital message they were acting to, but it came across pretty well.

In my review of the first part of Atlas Shrugged, I described it as ""better than I expected"", and I was honestly looking forward this installment. I guess it's roughly as good as the first.  On the positive side, some things actually *happen* in this movie, which is a step up, but other things pull it down, so it's kind of a wash.

First, although it takes up where the first left off, all the actors have magically changed - and for the most part they're worse than the originals.  I actually liked the first Hank Rearden, but this guy is smug jerk who goes through the whole movie with a superior smirk frozen on his face.  Dagny has bags under her eyes and a permanently strained look that I couldn't help but interpret as menstrual cramps.  The smoldering passion between the two of them that was in the book went from lukewarm in the first part to nonexistent in the second. While we're on that subject, the makers shied away even more from Rand's penchant for rough sex, and toned things down even more than first, which was already strictly Hallmark Channel to begin with.

The Wesley Mouch of the first movie really captured the insidious evil of the character Rand had written, while this guy's just kind of annoying. One of the only ones who did a halfway good job was the guy who played Ken Dannager, the coal magnate, but he has a small part and disappears around the middle.  The only truly good casting was Dagny's brother. Rand would have been pleased.

Easter Egg alert: keep an eye out for a short cameo by Teller (of Penn and Teller) - in a speaking role!

The movie also abandons the atmosphere of the first, so now it looks more like ""the future"" than a weird alternate history of the 50s.  This arguably makes more sense, but it also loses some of the charm of the first - and charm is in short enough supply.  It also makes it even more implausible that railroads are suddenly so important again.

Rand has a rather simple point to make, and she doesn't believe in subtlety.  In the first move, she makes her point by repeating things, and in this one, she does it by getting sillier and sillier, and her plot is even more ridiculous as a movie than in print.

Things pick up a bit with some dramatic tension after Dagny goes on vacation and the railroad begins to fall apart.  This is the high point of the movie and it's actually pretty good for a while.  Here, the movie actually makes its point in the action, rather than by preaching, but it's too little to late.

Those who have read the book will recognize the beginning as foreshadowing Dagny's arrival in ""Galt's Gulch"", which gives you hope you will actually see their vision of Rand's Utopia.  Unfortunately, the movie ends with that arrival, so you'll have to tune in for the third installment - presumably with totally different actors and settings - for the payoff.

Once more, the movie is pulled down by slavish devotion to the book.  Rand believed that great men could follow many paths: engineers, scientists, artists, architects, businessmen, authors, musicians...pretty much anything by comedians.  Like the book, and all her books, there's not a trace of humor in the movie.  The closest thing to a ""joke"" is when Francisco D'Anconia sets fire to his mines to bankrupt his investors.  Yup, a real knee-slapper that one.  He is polite enough to warn Rearden (making it both arson *and* insider trading) - and of course nobody else matters.

Even so, although Rand's writing is devoid of humor, she at least gave them a certain ""joie de vivre"" that's totally lacking in the movie.  The actors deliver their lines, economic lectures, and sermonettes without a trace of joy or passion.

It struck me that James Taggart's wedding is a good representation of the movie as a whole.  If listening to a political debate at a wedding reception is your idea of a good time, then you'll probably love this movie.  Otherwise, like me, you'll probably want to shout ""lighten up"" at several points.

Still, if you watched the first one, you'll probably want to watch this one, and if you watch this one, you'll find yourself hoping they'll finish the trilogy.  I want to see their vision of Rand's Utopia.  Personally, I've always wondered who cleans the toilets in a society populated entirely by arrogant supermen.",1373500800,2,4307,4.626315789473685

5429470,3,B00AIBZFDI,"Even though the first movie was produced fast on a shoe string budget from a visual perspective, it simply presents better. If you can, go back
and rewatch the first one and you'll see what I mean.

What is entertainment if not partly visual? The message of the movie translated from the book comes across in its purity and was not sacrificed. The second installment, or part 2 of Atlas Shrugged movies' message continuity feels disjointed and the chemistry between actors, with the exception of Rearden and D'Acostonia; the sets and props which gave the first movie impact and vibrancy w/a stylized throw back vintage feel along with the sweeping shots of desert/valley scenes in the first were majorly lacking in the second.

The first movie had at the time, mostly unknown actors which at first makes one think - 'shoestring' but the acting was VERY strong and good and having watched the movie a second time, I appreciate it twice as much now. The characters appeared much more interesting...there was an intensity in the acting and quite frankly the lead characters a lot more attractive.

Putting completely new actors in the latest installment - all of which appear at least 10 to 15 years older was a bad move. Samantha Mathis does her job well as does Esai Morales but for me they were both a distraction. I'm a fan of Jason Beghe and given his characters dilemma I think he added the most continuity structure wise. Also, two different actresses play his wifes' role and boy, they couldn't have been any different looking. The 2nd actress was a good choice and appeared much more modern/attractive than the first actress playing the character. But the first actress made me loathe her more so having 2 VERY different actresses kept me seeing the disparity which again - was a back of the mind kind of distraction.

I appreciate that there will be a part 3 and I just as soon see other actors in these roles or would hope they would bring back the originals. The actor who portrayed the character ""Mauch"" (sp?) for eg was heavier set and conveyed the business of politics and cronyism much stronger than the actor in the 2nd movie.

Part 2 is still a good movie with an intact message and in that regard, still worth seeing. Best scene: guys in the operations center trying to route the train and the tracks just before catastrophe strikes. You felt their desire to work the problem, a problem that at the end of Ayn Rand's fountain pen would indeed... not be solved.",1373328000,,2476,4.669724770642202

As this is really really low budget movie, they did not seem to be able to keep the original casts, so they swapped them all!

When I was watching part I, I thought the cast in the movie part I was quite bad... but turns out, they were far better than the ones in part II! I could not believe it! And the average age of the actors increased by 20 years? Also in Part I, I thought the set was like cheaply rented and badly thought, here in part II, it is again, far worse...

I don't know... if part III comes out, it may be like, it's so bad, it could be really good!

Well, maybe I am quite unique here, because I am more or less forced to get into this Atlas Shrugged thing.... If it wasn't for my coworker friend, I would have watched this thing for 5 minutes and moved on to something else and forgot about it completely.

1)Didn't appreciate the change in cast but tried to overlook it. I agree that the new Dagny was emotional and too old for the part. Henry was okay but also too old. Their acting is okay. I think I finally got used to them near the end of the movie.
2)There is a point in the movie where everything starts to fall apart. It was so cheesy and unbelievable that it became almost painful to watch. The ""dumb"" start to get dumber. So painful. Of course the ""smart"" ones become heros. The government rises up to become to super evil power that people today fear that it will become.
3)This movie went further than part 1 to draw a line between givers and takers. It draws a line between corporations and government. This just isn't reality.
4)This movie is clearly trying to make up from lack of eye candy in the first movie. This starts with flying jets and is far more futuristic. Once again, this just comes across as cheesy.

I would recommend watching this, and then reading the book if you haven't already.

5429512,1,B00AIBZFDI,"All around bad. They replaced the cast from the first movie with bad actors. They spent money on no-contribution show-ups like Shawn Hannity. Hank Reardon's character played like a reject from an old gangster movie. Francisco was played like he was passionless and bored. Dagny was the best acting in the movie and that wasn't too good. Hank and Dagny's relationship was unconvincing. The dialogue in general was illogical, uninspiring, and plays the opposite of the intent of Rand. The conversation between Hank and Fransisco comes off as the actual stereotype of rich industrialists ... two bitter billionaires bitching about how they can't make enough money. The dialogue between Dagny and Ken Dannager sounded like the two actors couldn't believe the lines they were asked to speak. And oh yeah, if you're going to stick Halley in there playing the most brilliant uplifting piece of music in the world as a scene...you better pay for some damn beautiful music to be written...the technical bullcrap he played isn't worthy of the scene and I'm thinking... God let it end, quite already, get off the stage. Then, the entire meltdown scene was literally laughable (I stopped the movie at this point and found myself laughing at it later). Why laughable? Every character in that scene was a prop, not an individual. Hank rushes in, drags a guy on the floor, another guy runs by on fire, right in front of Hanks face, and he doesn't even seem to notice. He abandons the guy on the floor and runs over to ""fight"" the disaster (so, I guess the guy is just a sack of potatoes not worth thinking about). At no time does anyone care about the safety of anyone. Hank and Francisco make some half-ass feeble attempt to shovel something around the edges of the molten metal pool, a really really pathetic attempt ... then everything explodes and its over, and you're like WTF? In the book, the young guy watches them and is awed by the heroism he sees. In the movie, his jaw is dropped as if he can't believe the two idiots he's watching running around. I turned it off and went to bed, right after a fit of laughter at the absurdity of it.

Even more soap operatic than Part I, Part II also lacks the few scattered exciting moments and variations in scenery we had in Part I, which I awarded two full stars.

Regardless of political persuasion or stance on America's current economic problems, I can't see how anyone would regard this film as anything but ludicrous. Example: The corrupt sell-out CEO James Taggart encounters a fawning groupie of a sales clerk in a bargain store where he's stopped to purchase a tie and immediately marries her. One of the dumbest confrontations in Filmland history takes place at the wedding, where mining mogul Francisco d'Anconia engages Taggart in a heated philosophical debate about the function of money in human society.

Remarkably, the acting and script are even more stilted than those in Part I. Still, I must give ASII an additional half-star because it's quite funny --albeit, unintentionally--in a number of places. So, maybe watch it as a comedy (?)

5429566,1,B00AIBZFDI,"If you listen closely, you can hear Ayn Rand crying in her grave. You would think that when translating a novel about people who are the great movers of the world into a movie, the cast would be full of great actors with a great screenplay to work with and great director to guide the process. Who is John Galt? More like, where are the actors from the previous installment? And, why is Part 2 so much worse than the already dreadful Part 1? Surely, no one can blame the actors (and I use that term loosely) from Part 1 from trying to save their careers (and I use that term loosely) by refusing to appear in Part 2. With a completely new cast for Part 2, it was as if the casting director deliberately made the worst possible casting decisions in an effort to sully the most important points of Rand's seminal book. [A quick Google search found the director's convoluted reason for the cast change, but I prefer to think that the actor from Part 1 asked for more money to be in Part 2 and were refused, which would be laughable for a film attempting to praise free market capitalism.] While terrible casting sometimes results in a movie that is unintentionally so bad it's good, this movie is not that kind of movie due to the low, very low, production values. Was that a model plane in the opening sequence? Are you kidding me? I got past that but was soon infuriated by a cameo by Fox News pundit Sean Hannity, whose intellectual qualifications barely surpass those of a bag of peanuts. I'm pretty sure Rand would vomit at the thought of Hannity in an Atlas Shrugged movie, especially when you consider it is people like Hannity who have hijacked Rand's message about capitalism while conveniently ignoring Rand's moral philosophy, to which Rand's vision of capitalism is married. (This was Part 1's greatest flaw as well.) Amusingly, fans of an unrestricted free market economy who say they have but never really did read Atlas Shrugged seem to think the acting and this movie in general is stellar, which is to say they think Linda Lovelace and Deep Throat should have won an Oscars. This movie is an abomination, but not inexplicably so if you consider that the director had no idea what the finer points of Rand's philosophies actually were. If you've never read Ayn Rand, stay away from this movie. If you have read Ayn Rand, stay further away from this movie.",1372636800,4,2368,4.561032863849765

For instance, Francisco's ""Money is the Root of All Evil?"" speech (sililoquy) is one of the most important events in the book (along with Galt's speech over the radio nearer the end of the book). In the MOVEIE, the ""money speech"" gets a few offhand lines. It is condensed and edited to the point of meaningless drivel. That's just ONE specific example.

I am not a ""Randian,"" but I AM a big fan who has read almost everything she wrote. The movie (as I sort of expected) was an extremely poor effort at portraying how collectivism will (already is) damaging our society and the world.

5429674,3,B00AIBZFDI,"'Atlas Shrugged' Part II is honed far better than its predecessor.  The pace of the plot, the intensity of the characters, and the ""on track"" trajectory of the dialogue make this segment of the adventure far more worthwhile.

In a previous review, I stated that 'Part I' was lackluster, and Ayn Rand would have shuddered at its production.  However, part of my basis was on how she reacted to the celluloid version of 'The Fountainhead,' starring Gary Cooper, but her main contention was with the change of lines which took a lot of the spirit from her protagonist's centerpiece speech. I also cited the lack of fire portrayed in the characters, the gratuitous expletives, and the overall lack of zest put into the first installment.

Here they've upped the quality and have harnessed the spirit of her epic novel far better.  Maybe even having Samantha Mathis at the helm, injecting a true spirit into protagonist, Dagny Taggart (instead of Taylor Schilling, who seemed too cold and steely in demeanor) and adding name actors like Diedrich Bader (as Quentin Daniels) and Ray Wise (from '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twin-Peaks-The-First-Season-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JKES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twin Peaks - The First Season (Special Edition)</a>as Head of State Thompson).  As lesser names, Patrick Fabian is a silver-tongued weasel (enough for James Taggart), and Paul McCrane is officiously offensive as the government nemesis, Wesley Mouch. However, it is Duncan Jones's directing (replacing Paul Johansson) which should get front and center credit for making the deliberations so ably paced that make this portion of 'Atlas Shrugged' gets back on its rails and deliver the goods.  (Puns intended.)

It is hard to imagine what proceedings will take us into 'Part III,' (Only for those who have read the book know what I mean), but 'Part II' can only have us hoping for more of the same.

The actors all seemed to be ""playing"" their parts rather than being their parts.  I felt they were trying to play their parts like they ""thought"" the original actors portrayed their characters.

I wonder why the original cast wasn't part of Atlas Shrugged II.  Does this mean that there will be even another cast for Atlas III?  If that is the case I don't look forward to the finale.  I just re-read the book.

Part 2 though had many-a-change in it. I was not thrilled about who those changes were, but hey, what can you do right? The special effects were obviously not as well done for this movie. It reminded me much more of a low budget TV series than any real movie, but regardless, the actual CONTENT was good, hence the 5 stars.

Fantastic character sketches, intricate themes, surprises around every chapter, romance, successes and failures, and a glimpse into the final outcome of a socialistic society played out fully.  What that does to the human spirit....  So the 1st movie was disappointing.  Hard to follow if you had not memorized the book, and the relationship between Dagny and Roark was so wrong that I could barely watch it.  Also, it was as if too much time was spent on cinematography, and they left way too much of the dialogue in the dust!  The Strike made up for it.  It was fantastic.  The acting was great, but more importantly, they got the essence of the storyline!!  The character sketches were spot-on and Ayn Rand's message was there..without being hung-up on fabricated ""romance"" and panoramic views.  More like this.

The first installment, Atlas Shrugged I, was excellent in every way particularly the cast. For Atlas Shrugged II, the entire main cast was changed, and the result was terrible.

The new cast is lackluster. In fact Dagny Taggart, the principal character, went from a hard driven, sophisticated, glamorous woman to a frump. The other principal characters such as Francisco d'Anconia, Hank Rearden, Eddie Willers and James Taggert were also far less dynamic and appealing.

I also found the cinematography to be of lower quality. If it was not for Ayn Rand's excellent story, I would have turned it off. Giving the film two stars was generous and entirely due to Ayn Rand's masterpiece. I hope that the producers will reprise the original cast for Atlas Shrugged III.",1371081600,2,969,4.902439024390244

I wish the first set had stayed on but such is Hollywood.  Continuity is always a problem when a well know classic is changed into a movie.  To do all of the major scenes in the book would take 12 hours or so.  I think it would have been worth it.  Which means I would have paid the hundred the set would cost but would enough others?

People familiar with the book do not need to see all the scenes that set up the major scenes.  Others will be confused by the jumping around.  For instance in the movie Dagny abandoned the Railroad fairly quickly.  In the book she fought for a long time.  Same with the government takeover.  Took a lot more time in the book and was much more interesting. The script also updated the government takeover to include current slogans and the recovery of shale oil. They kind of had to keep the blackmail pictures the reason Henry gifted the patients but that wouldn't work today.

Naturally the book was better, but the screenwriters have done an outstanding job in encapsulating her writing and getting to what's important. Sadly we will not see the end of the series until near summer of 2014, although I am sure it is worth waiting for...We may well see what Capitalism is capable of, something the Government cannot nor will try in both the film, as it is here in today's U.S. That is the Private Sector can do anything with the best of innovation, and do it better, faster, and safer that any Union or Government sponsored jobs.

In world of Atlas Shrugged, the Government is in trouble, but those in the ""underground""  have the answer, but the problem is, will it change minds? There is always a better way than an oppressive government as time immortal has proven over and over again throughout history. Their way is not working (no big surprise to those who have common sense), many do not realize their is a difference between plain Democracy and a Democratic Society (Libya and Egypt are Democracies for example), which is what they are dealing with in Shrugged. Is John Galt a person, a way of life...or both?

Do not allow yourselves to think with a new cast of characters and new director that this movie is any less that Part 1, just the opposite, they are more suited to the roles than in #1. The look and tone of the film is outstanding, and made to be believable, the first one was no doubt good, however this one is much more convincing are real, as with any good series, it will leave you wanting more, as it should. I am normally one who wants it all at once, not wanting to wait, although it does make the wait worthwhile in building anticipation for the final episode and it makes you think of the scenario's of what will happen...part oft he appeal.

This is one of the reasons for the Five Star review, these have been done so well, the only thing we know now, is that the screenplay is already written, though prone to some changes, with some scenes already being filmed, I do not think we will have much or any character changes in the final of the three movies. Yet we are looking at about a year from release.

5429803,4,B00AIBZFDI,"Hope you watched part one before this.

You're going to have to read the book if you really want to know what this film is all about. There is no way to recap the story or the philosophy behind it in the short review. So I will have to assume that you either have read the book or intend to read it.

As with most book adaptations one could build a laundry list of what is missing. I personally was hoping for a period piece. However after viewing this presentation I realize that a period piece would be very clumsy and that they made the right decision by adapting it to a more up to date venue (the year 2016.) Then of course you have to choose the actors (differed from part one) and that must've been a monumental task.

Bottom line is this is as good as it's going to get. I actually found myself enjoying the film even with the anticipation of some story parts from the book and am looking forward to the last part III the Shangri-La scene. Atlas Shrugged Part III will be written by Duncan Scott and Brian O'Toole.

If you haven't read the book first though there are a lot of things that have been implied a few things that have been combined or dismissed so you will have to watch carefully to be able to figure out what the story line is and the reasoning behind the action.

If you're not inclined to read books that can help you set up taller at the table (approximately 336 pages) then be sure to look at the DVD extras as they will give you a better insight as to what the producers are trying to portray with the various scenes.",1369267200,2,1544,4.202702702702703

5429806,4,B00AIBZFDI,"I watched ""Atlas Shrugged I"" and ""Atlas Shrugged II"" on consecutive nights.  Except for the change in actors it was a good movie ...I am certainly looking forward to Atlas Shrugged III.  I like the actors and the performances in part II better than part I.  This presentation of  Ayn Rand's now classic book reminds me of the great presentation of ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""  It is hard to turn writings of authors like Ayn Rand into decent screenplays.  I think that these folks did a good job.
Another thing. . .by watching part one and two on consecutive nights I got a real double bang!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Last thing....many conservatives and libertarians have argued against the ""nanny"" state. They and I prefer strong individualism in most things. Ayn Rand's book and now these movies argue in quite specific and highly visual  terms what happens when the government is given total control over American industry. Government's only goal is to become bigger and more powerful.  Government and government officials do not possess the competence to do the job!
Get both part one and part two. . .give yourself a double bang!  For me it was almost mind boggling. Get ready for part three!",1369267200,,1182,4.835820895522388

5429906,4,B00AIBZFDI,"The plot is one dimensional in address only one side of its story. Big Government intrusion into big business. However, the plot is the little told consequences of a socialistic state were those who do not produce expect to share in the rewards of those who do. The plot brings to mind the old fables about the ""Ant and the Grasshopper.""  Also, the fable of the chicken who planted the grain, cared for the gain, harvested the grain, milled the grain, and baked the bread, while no one else wanted to help. However, in the end, everyone wants to partake of the fruits of chickens hard work.  Of course, she refuses to share with those who refused to share in the labors that made the bread possible.

This is the moral of Atlas Shrugged. Those who do the labor deserve to reap the rewards of their labor. And, those who refuse to labor will suffer the consequence of their slothfulness. Some will find the underlying philosophy of the movie to be disturbing and selfish. For in the plot those who produce feel no obligation to share with those who do not. Just as in those old fables, those who do not labor to contribute to their own welfare suffer the dire consequences of their own actions or lack of actions to save themselves.

The movie use the events of the last few years to demonstrate how, author, Ayn Rands vision of the future is at hand.  The movie shows protesters outside of the offices of major industries holding signs saying, ""We are the 99%."" The movie's philosophy see these protesters as those who use the products which are created and produces by the hands of others, but then, also want to share in the profits of the labors of others.

During the last election, President Obama, told a gathering of his supporters, ""That businesses own them (the supporters) a share of the businesses' profit because without them buying their products/services those businesses would not be successful. Ayn Rand's vision of the futures has become today's political reality. Today, the chicken would be forced to share the fruits of her labors, with those who refuse to labor at all. And, then, those who refused to labor would take the profit the chicken had earn for herself. Leaving the chicken with little reason to produce in the future.

When Ayn Rand's vision of the future becomes today, Atlas, Shrugged, and asked, ""Who is John Galt?""",1368489600,3,2350,4.675544794188862

Some people who have posted their reviews think it's a correlation to what is happening today on the political landscape.

Typical for someone who is from Communist Russia Ayn Rand could not even appreciate America the land of the free. apparently she did not truly understand the US constitution and the will power of the US voters. She was a hypocrite.  She got sick, could no longer work, ran out of money, and lived off of Medicaid and Social Security until she died. The movie is good for entertainment and that is about it.

""Why is that?"", you may ask.

Because watching all three of these godawful, public access quality ""films"" still takes less time than it does to read one of the most over-hyped books in the history of man. Atlas Shrugged is selfish, meaningless, shallow drivel that was written by a psychopath who minted money off of the idiots who consumed it and called it ""philosophy"" (also, that word doesn't mean what you think it means) and these movies are doing the same, except with far less success. Intelligent people do not take this stuff seriously. This is Battlefield Earth territory, except far less interesting with worse dialogue, production value, plot, and character depth. Citizen Kane this is not.

Part II did a much better job all around, the actors were better, the story was told better, yet there was still so much missing from the book.  The movie did a decent job introducing us to the characters, but without the background from the book, some of them fell kind of flat.  While Part II is much better than Part I, it still has more of a ""Lifetime"" movie quality feel to it.  I would have liked to see this story given the attention and production of something like Lord of the Rings, but I am still looking forward to seeing Part III.  The worst part would be trying to watch all three parts at the same time since Part I was not only done poorly, but just about the whole cast was replaced, making it awkward and disorienting going into Part II (I hope they keep this cast going into Part III).  If you can, read the book (yes, it is LONG, but worth it).

If you like the book, you will most likely like the movie.  If you do not like Ayn Rand and her books, do yourself a favor, skip the movie so you do not have to whine afterwards about watching it.

I read the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings before that and found the movie version was exactly like I imagined it.  However, the movie version of Atlas Shrugged (Part 1 and Part 2) does not begin to be as closely scripted as the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings.  I was able to get past that fact the idea that this picture was not an exact copy of the book.  It gets to the heart of the issues and covers most of the bases fairly well.  I found it bridging the technicalogical developments since its writing in such a way as to make it feel realistic. (Trains today are not a major player in transportation of people but certain changes such as oil depletion could change that.)  The core theme, big overcontrolling government that manipulates everything for incompitant insiders at the expense or real ability and producers is an evil that will destroy everyone and everything unless it is destroyed before it can finish the job.",1367539200,,1054,4.424870466321243

So, Ayn Rand haters will hate the movie, and Ayn Rand lovers who understand the realities of movie-making, might love it, and others will react in many different degrees.

5430087,4,B00AIBZFDI,"First of all, let me say I love the book.  It's by far my favorite book of all time.  I'd give the book 10 stars out of 5 if I could.  My review will be based on the movie itself.

I was impressed with the movie.  The script, though fast-paced, was true to the book; the picture (I'm sure there's a technical term for this) was acceptable--not quite as ""shiny"" as the last, but it didn't bother me at all.

But I was distracted the entire time by the actress playing Dagny.  I can't really decide if it's because all of the actors changed for this movie or because her acting was off (not per se, but compared to the depiction of Dagny in the book).  Though I read the book too many years ago, this actress portrayed Dagny as more vulnerable, emotional, and tired where I remember her being more defiant, hard, and determined.  I guess that's more how she was portrayed in the last movie, and I liked it.  Don't get me wrong: I think she's a fine actress; I'm just not sure she was right for the part of Dagny.

On the plus side, I thought the actors cast for Rearden and d'Anconia--and actually just about everyone else--were actually major improvements.  I never really bought Rearden as a pretty boy; the actor in this movie was much harder, more how I'd imagine a steel man.  And the actor playing d'Anconia did a much better job of juxtaposing the public image of D'Anconia as a playboy lady's man with his true philosophical nature.  Everyone else, particularly James and Mouch, were much better cast in this movie too, for reasons I can't really explain other than to say that they just ""seemed"" closer to how I'd imagined the book.

I guess in my humble opinion, this movie, and the last one, would have been better if they had kept Taylor Schilling as Dagny and used just about everyone else from this movie.  If Dagny weren't the main protagonist, I'd say casting majorly improved this time around.  Unfortunately, though, the Dagny issue was just distracting enough, to me, to warrant knocking off a star.",1366848000,,2016,4.4945054945054945

that surprise, the movie moved along well and was reasonably faithful to the book.  However, I didn't know that there

from the 1930's, per the book, so the updating to modern times was also surprise, but perhaps makes it the

He is such a nice guy, it's hard to see him play such a louse.
In three movies, they couldn't even give us a hint of Cherryl's story? She was such a rich character. They got a perfect actress to play her.
I loved that she got to say her one iconic line, but it didn't make a lot of sense unless you read the book.

Good to see such a great book get transferred into a trilogy of movies when the book deserves it.

5430154,2,B00AIBZFDI,"Times are hard in Galt's Gulch as they are everywhere else. Over the past two years, Wesley Mouch, recovering from cancer I suppose, dropped 40 lbs, lost his hair and grew a wispy goatee. James Taggart and Eddie Willers started shooting steroids and both tripled in size. And Rearden Metal was taken over by Sonny Corleone. For Dagny Taggart it was all too much. She aged 20 years in two.

If you enjoyed part 1 of Atlas Shrugged (the movie) you'll be amazed by part 2. These producers were not able to retain a single actor. The really odd thing is they made no effort to find actors who looked remotely like the original cast. I know they produced this on the fly, but frankly from a viewer's perspective, it might have been better if they simply hadn't done the project at all. It is completely disconcerting when you meet the new Dagny and can only recognize her because she's wearing the Rearden Metal bracelet. Ironically in a film based on a book about extremely competent people in a world falling apart, the feeling you get is that this production team is inept and incompetent.

The production values are still high. Camera work is good. The direction, however, is much more heavy-handed than it was in part 1. While the actors are capable they can't get around the more aggressive script and their completely different interpretations of the characters from the part 1 cast.

I suppose the cast for part 3 will be geriatric and I doubt I'll be there to witness it. I wanted to see this at the movies when it was released and now I'm glad I was too busy. If you watch parts 1 and 2 back to back, (as one might expect to be able) I recommend you drop 300 micrograms of LSD first.

I thought Part 1 was quite promising, decent cast and presentation.  Part 2, however, felt very amateurish in comparison.  Oddly enough, I enjoyed the actors for Rearden and Francisco much better in Part 2, but I think they were hampered by a poorly adapted script.
The special effects were atrocious and reminded me of 10-15 year old sci-fi original pictures.  So many shots could have been practical effects, stock footage, or just plain absent and would have been better than the very poor CG that they decided to go with.
Even the parts that should have had great impact, like Francisco's money speech or Rearden's defense at his trial, seemed flat and a bit forced in the film.
If you are also an Atlas Shrugged/Ayn Rand fan, I'm sure you'll want to see this movie.  If you are not familiar with the book, skip the movie and go buy the book.  I think you'll get a lot more out of it.",1366156800,23,1001,4.502762430939226

5430158,5,B00AIBZFDI,"Two years ago, ""Atlas Shrugged: Part One"" exploded onto the Shruggalo scene.  ""Atlas Shrugged Part II: Rise of the Shruggalos"" continues the story of Violent JT and Dagny 2 Dope as the government's newly enacted ""Fair Share"" law has forced businesses to sell to all buyers, leading to intense dissatisfaction amongst the commercial elite and transforming a once-vibrant economy into a dark carnival of industrial stagnation.  Tycoons begin to vanish, leaving behind only the question ""Who is Juggagalt?""  2 Dope & JT criss-cross the country, searching for answers in the disappearances of America's big money rustlas.

2 Dope and former business partner Raw Stank are charged under the new law.  At trial,  Raw Stank defends the pursuit of profit and is given only a token penalty. However, Sheriff Sugar Wolf announces ""Directive 10-289"", which freezes employment and production, requiring all patent rights to be gifted to the government. Bureaucrat Dusty Poot blackmails Mud Bug into giving up his Mud Bug Metal patents, using photos of Mud Bug and 2 Dope that would damage 2 Dope's reputation.

Dagny 2 Dope leaves her post at the railroad when her prized Juggagalt line is disassembled due to lack of business. During her absence, a Greez-E Transcontinental train collides with a military train in a tunnel, due largely to political pressure by a passenger and to human error by 2 Dope's poorly-trained replacement. This impels 2 Dope back to her job. Rhyme Doctor Grizzly Wolf  tries to dissuade her from returning, as he had earlier tried to talk Mud Bug into leaving his business, but she returns anyway.

2 Dope takes a train to Colorado to show her faith in the railway, but its engine fails. The repair technician used to work for The Great Milenko's Amazing Mighty Death Pop Motors, which produced the motor 2 Dope found. He tells her how the need-based reward system in his company failed, and his coworker Juggagalt left the company to ""stop the motor of the world."" 2 Dope calls Big Baby Chips, who tells her that he is quitting. 2 Dope buys a small airplane and flies to Utah to try to dissuade him, but as she is landing, she sees him get into a plane on the airstrip.

After a pursuit in the air--the opening scene of the film--2 Dope's plane crashes in a valley hidden by stealth technology. 2 Dope crawls to the edge of her crashed plane, where she is greeted by Juggagalt.

All in all, this is one of ARaynd's finest works, and the movie is the maddest.  I laughed, I cried, I went outside to wrestle.  Shruggalos...whats our signal? WHOOP WHOOP",1366156800,4,2566,4.804545454545455

I don't think these screen writers really appreciate the true meanings behind what Ayn Rand wrote. Both movies are action packed, but many scenes differ from the book, apparently to try and make it more exciting. And in the process they are messing up what Rand wrote. For example, take just the final scenes. (spoiler alert) They make it clear that JG knows he is being chased by Dagney. And, in trying to loose her, shows no concern for her life or safety. But in the book JG does NOT know he is being followed, and if he did he would NOT have put her life in danger. In the book she yells out the ""famous phrase"" as her last breath the moment she is, or thinks she is, going to die. In the movie she appears to mutter it for no apparent reason. In the book her vehicle is repaired. There is NO WAY they are going to repair that thing in the movie. In the movie she takes the ""final plunge"" like a crazy woman because she saw them do it. In the book she has resigned herself to the fact that she has lost them, is lost herself and finally makes ""the plunge"" because she has run out of fuel. I could go on and on. All of these things have meaning to the story line and are a part of the nature of the characters.

So see the movie but also read the book. Rand is a captivating writer and there is so much more to her meaning than is being portrayed in the movies.",1366156800,,1515,4.066889632107023

Now this is into the darker part of the story, so there's not too much room for showing the enjoyment of life that either of these characters has; but you do get to see their strength, dedication and hard work, and the pride that they take in it.

I saw ATLAS SHRUGGED: PART 2 in the theater last Saturday (October 13). It has a totally different cast, and was a good continuation of the story (the movie ends when Dagny Taggert, the lead character, finally meets the elusive John Galt, after being injured in a plane crash).

We will see.

There are not that many DVD extras, except for a slightly longer version of Sean Hannity's segment (he is not one of my favorites); some behind-the scenes footage, sixteen deleted scenes, and two sneak peaks of other movies.

ATLAS SHRUGGED, PART III will be filmed later this year, and is scheduled for a fall 2014 theatrical release, with a DVD release likely in late 2014 or early 2015.

The same actors from part one weren't used either. the screen play left a lot to be desired, the sets and locations were sub- par, the visual effects were poor at best, and the direction seemed like it was done by some high school kid. if this had been done by a Hollywood production team with proper financing it would have been great because the story is very compelling.",1365206400,,559,4.436893203883495

5430332,2,B00AIBZFDI,"Right, then...

Here's the upshot:  This movie (like Atlas Shrugged: Part 1) is awful.  Ayn Rand's head would have exploded if she were alive to see this.  Mind you, this is coming from someone that has read the book several times and finds it to be a passable work of fiction, with some philosophical bits on capitalism and laissez faire government.

So, what's wrong with it?  A lot.  What I won't harp on is the fact that they could not get the same characters for Pt 2 as they had in Pt 1.  That's life, and I can't say if one group of actors were really any better than the other, so that's a wash in my mind.

As for the rest of the movie:  First, they should have made it a period piece instead of a futuristic piece.  Atlas Shrugged was published in 1957 when passenger trains were still a reasonable method for cross-country travel.  The premise with the movie is that the US had fallen so hard, and gas prices had gotten so high ($40/gallon?) that rail was the best method of long-distance travel.  It's not believable in the modern world.

Second, the dialogue was choppy at best.  Now, in the filmakers defense, this was also the case in the book.  The difference is that Ayn Rand was Russian and English was her second language.  So even though her writing was choppy and contrived, you're willing to overlook that.  But the folks that made this movie had no such excuse.

Third, they're trying to stuff the plotline.  The book is just under 1100 pages.  You can't make [ostensibly] three 2-hour movies with that much material and not have holes in the plot.  At least it looks like they're trying to save time by deleting the whole love story plotline (I always skip over that when I read the book).

Finally, the acting.  I don't know - it's just that the way lines were delivered did not seem natural.  For that matter, in real life, a CEO (or COO) would not care that much about a fellow CEO disappearing.

What's upsetting is that this could have been a better movie.  But I think a) they were trying to do it on the cheap and b) were more focused on making the movie an editorial comment about current politics rather than trying to tell a story.

I watched this (and Pt 1) hoping to be delighted; I was disappointed.  Ayn Rand believed in hard work and money.  She also believed in quality, something this movie does not have.",1365033600,2,2346,4.413551401869159
5430363,5,B00AIBZFDI,"Looking forward to the rest of the series. Odd how this is released on DVD and not movies or tv. It's a great story, just sad the actors changed.

5430405,2,B00AIBZFDI,"Taylor Schilling and Grant Bowler probably shrugged off the chance to nose-dive their careers by appearing in a second part.  That or its producers couldn't get the where-with-all to keep on through with the same quality of production.  I actually enjoyed part one of the series, and was still then somewhat 'bitten' by the 'Rosenbaum' complex (which probably helped).  I'd already ditched a large part of it, certainly my work has always been unaffected (except in the negative) by objectivism's Philosophy First! defiance of logic but to maintain its own fraudulent handle of supremacy.  Hence I'm now retroactively glad to see part 2 come in with all the delivered promise of a belly-flop.  Aided by a cheap looking production and cast replacement (where a cardboard cast does full justice to their paper counterparts on page), Altas' Shrugging finally begins to demonstrate that the world still turns (and is much the better for it).  No more decent minds getting side-tracked by a mystical phantom and personal 'stand' that has the end result of dis-allowing and disavowing the means to and of good discovery.  No more thankless uphill battles to understand a mind fundamentally distorted by a childhood struggle to assert itself carried way too long into adult-hood where it seems to have become a semi-national fixation on the other side of the world.  No more notions of sacrifice that distort the healthiest relationships and imaginations to contort them into replications of another's skewed views and deep-seated never confessed fears of existence and of ability to hold their own views and values alike (except as a stranglehold! - that doesn't count).  No more attempted high-jackings of cognition itself, and attempted monopolies inserted over one's own ability to see and know (and feel!) reality as it is, not via someone else's word or declaration.  No more empty mouthing and endless repetitions of concepts taken way beyond any level of kidnapped axioms - to reinforce a structure of pre-tensioned freedom that proves nothing of the kind, but walls up any mind it can 'sway over' to its version (the ONLY one EVER!, absurdly) that has ever grasped the totality (""Totalitariality"" - more like it!) of truth and reason . . .

Rand's ""Altas"" - (a holographic paper image - nothing more except in its own disturbed mind and those of others it would similarly whack with its own parody) - ""Shrugged"" and the only thing that fell (out) was his own brainstem. Your chiropractor would call that 'Atlas' when making adjustments, and this advocate of all things good in man, woman and humanity - strongly suggests that the sooner one re-claims one's own - as one's own, the better - literally - not to be messed around with by a Russian immigrant woman on the hop from a totalitarian state - who doesn't take the essential and necessary time to get her skewed hangover in order before writing. This is a mentality, sadly affected, by this and the political issues ""at home and abroad"" of the time along with her own primary misconception regarding her own value/s - that should not still be allowed to put its hands and handle over free Americans today - especially in schools and at formation level - where it can do and no doubt already has done untold damage. One day the world will be rid of this meddlesome mind-melder, but until then, I stand firmly against its influence as one not good for developing brains - or anyone else's. 'Original Sin' is bad enough without Rand compounding it into a prison of the mind.

The young Alisa Rosenbaum realized hard and young that her emotions were not going to be any good to confront the evils of her childhood. Instead of allowing good sense and time to heal, though, she simply declared and defined them as helpless, hopeless, and of no use. Especially ones that may allow real and true perspective. She mis-integrated them (as the predominate feeling of her childhood - along with a 'sure' sense of her own importance and superiority - also needed for survival then as well as a 'light and gay' - meant as an expression of the 20's - kind of 'unilateral essentialism' of only one kind of fragile but piquantly and ONLY over-bright sensibility) into a new fixation in her new world. It's done no one any good since**, and never will, as basically it's nothing more or less than a reaffirmation of the state of her 'feelings' (as a sum) retaining the giant ""Against!"" all else, that when ""integrated"", must by nature work against (itself - as the whole it is vainly trying to be in that miserable state but can never know - in all truth while retaining the giant load it also vainly tries to throw over everyone else in its path, it calls ""in its way"" instead) a forever looming and perpetually recast crisis - or ""Other!"" that must be defeated at all cost/s - even though it predominately exists as a cessation of thought and emotional paralysis in its own consciousness. A shame for the 'victim' involved that it also ejects any remaining ability to understand it - by doctrinal overkill. That's the essence of Rand decoded briefly but accurately for the genuine reader, that even contaminated her ability to fully appreciate Rachmaninoff - along with so much else. Unfortunately, I'd have to consider (objectively) that objectivists are mostly beyond help by their own hand (they desperately need to believe is a 'first' one, already having been 'treated' by Rand's, for them second ones. Hands, that is.)

Any mindless clicking of ""No"" below won't change the facts or the review, no matter how much 'wishing away' some indulge in - by nature and their doctrine and 'story'.  How can I put it into words to say votes don't matter - as I'm not a politician - I just care about viewers - and readers.  No spiel, no angle, no backstory - this is it.

Nor in fact any mindless reporting as ""abuse"".  In response to such a comment (as you see below);  ""For not conforming to your own limited views, or as your attempt at grand-standing? Whatever it is, it's a try at censorship that smacks of the mid 20th century. How ""free"" thinking of her. All I have done is state the facts, which objectivism claims to support - but proves itself constantly as truth aversive by underlining ""As long as it's OUR facts, presented in OUR way."" A try at mind stealing - originally attempted on a grand scale, while finger pointing anywhere and everywhere else it can put its hands to the lesser charge of ""concept stealing"" to cover for its own. (Both second hands, I add!) My point is that no group - secular, governmental, philosophical or religious - can highjack the language - in whole or part - no matter what ISM - or Truth - it calls itself. Not can't, as in ""you can't"", just can't as in ""not possible"". (Unless backed up by force, or overcall, or another voice considered greater than their own - none of which actually work for any party in the long run.) What part of that is abusive? What is obnoxious? Those who brazenly declare their right to place their views ideationally over those of others. They claim to be against that, as long as their way is acknowledged by all - as ""good"" for all - and the way of all ""good"" for that matter -  preferably with others' pocket books - only to its own cause absolutely and any other only under carefully defined limited circumstances.  What is it actually?  The most inverted form of non-self recognizing (inwardly anti-self symbolism - the ""self"" overtaken by Rand as her ""key"" concept - with the same rubber stamp mechanism she was exposed to in her youth of) the most pure and towering altruism imaginable. Endorsing no other form, but its own. Hence again, a finger-pointing at everyone else's values declaring most of those she encountered in the free-world all to be 'altruists' and potential 'enslavers' and of no value - unless pro-herself.  Disgusting, vain, pointless, and productive of nothing but contempt itself.  To put it in terms even she may be able to understand, cumulatively, the amount of taxes generated on sheerly the sales of objectivist ""literature"" (not allowing the false claim to take precedence of how much ""work"" it endorses) but as purely that of its own action - is actually immaterial and could be said to be effectively (nil) - as a percentage of GDP, calculated in 1982 - and even closer to the zero in 2013.  Rand's estate for instance - was 800k I think - that doesn't give it a lot of 'pull' (in its own terms) so therefore needs continual endorsement by others to help force its point.  Don't kid yourself if you think it doesn't live by 'pull'.  It lives off it!  (Hence its 'last' subterfuge - actually they are endless - to suggest all others are 'push and pull' merchants - again - only to try force its own - which it calls 'yours'.  Absolutely horrendous and the closest thing to amoral I've seen on earth thus far.)  As such, no longer by or for or with me, and as this is a marketplace where the veracity and decency of products is at issue in review - my consumer based reviews are not only good and vital - but - objectively valid - being based in the nature of living - human style - rather than in a sub-setted attempted railroading/highjacking/kidnapping/distortion/mis-use for its own purposes (or lack thereof as the case ever more invariably seems to be) that is also an attempt at the overtaking of cognition itself, originally, as said, envisioned on a grander scale - but now rather appropriately and pathetically spiraling like ""Ms. Taggart's"" fake jet (on non-exsitant jet-fuel) not quite getting the tractor beam treatment - as that proved unworkable - or ""sorry - just not functioning well"" - as in most equipment in would-be dictatorships - - - - and psycho-unactive dramas cast along the same lines. Which is to say, the propaganda flick nose-dived. For what lies behind ""part 2"" of ""the strike"", no actual abuse - if I chose to engage in it - could be strong enough.""

**No real and lasting good, except for the few - actual parasites (although they mouth that term more than anyone) at the 'top' of objectivsim's tree - who've cashed in on it ever since - and are still doing so now.",1364860800,2,10145,4.715254237288136

5430446,4,B00AIBZFDI,"While part one set the story in motion and held my interest, part TWO kicks things up a bit.

Although the book is legendary and has been around for decades, the story always remains extremely current because this is a story about events that continually ensue in America and around the world.

It is a story about freedom vs the oppression of it. It is a story about self made success stories vs demands of success/wealth redistribution from people of lesser results being encouraged by and used by power grabbers and dictators.

Although the main characters in part one are played by different actors in part two, there was continuity and the story continues to build.

The production seems better in part two, but I think that the camera positions and editing are more documentary style at times than big screen style and the passion of the characters comes off more like we are witnessing it than experiencing it. Because of that, it seems like it doesn't deliver some of the drama that is present in the story and performances as well as it could, but I can relate to the property rights defenders and story quite easily. I am glad that I bought this instead of renting it. I will watch the 3 parts again in the future after we have access to part three, due in theaters in 2014.

I realize, of course, that books made into movies always have people railing about how the movie is nothing like the book. That said, I've seen many faithful reproductions of good books over the course of the last decade.  This movie, however, is nothing like the book. Granted, the level of detail in the book is astonishing and it would be hard to be faithful in all aspects. But in this case it really seems as if the movie producers did their best not to pay attention to the details and feel of the book. It's almost as if the movie is telling a different story altogether. In my opinion, the modernization of the setting lends to the overall disappointment (why not just stick with old steam and diesel locomotives?!).

The other big disappointment was to find that the cast of Part I was almost entirely replaced with new actors. This, together with the serious deviations from the book, really made Part II a doubly-bitter pill to swallow. Uuuugh!",1364515200,4,1014,4.72316384180791

There was no sexual chemistry between her and the new Hank, a disservice to the characters. Esai Morales and the others gave fine performances; they just didn't gel into a convincing ensemble cast.

Unfortunately the limitations of budget and casting keep this effort solidly in the 'ABC Afternoon Special' class of filmmaking.

Samantha Mathis makes Taylor Schilling look like Meryl Streep. The producer was unable to afford to keep the cast together and
Mathis is weak in the role. Jason Beghe fares a little better as does Esai Morales. Director John Putch is a strictly color by numbers guy.

That said, most won't be watching it for it's artistic merits. It's about The Message- in this case Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. In that arena the film succeeds in advancing the concepts of individual man against the oppression of the collective. If one is a fan of Rand this makes a nice companion to the first, and slightly better, effort.

The next installment will bring us the character of John Galt, fully fleshed out (and played by D.B. Sweeny- easily the best actor in the cast) and the face behind the movement of talent that 'disappeared' at the peak of their respective careers due to attempted government theft of their services, a meme first established in 'The Fountainhead' with Howard Roarke.

The movie is a polemic on modern American society, post 2008, and  is the swan song for what many people feel is the decline and fall of the American cowboy spirit, the survival of the fittest, the fastest, the strongest--but also the smartest and most hard-working.
Those viewers who see themselves as libertarians will love this flick and will forgive its weird parts, like the perpetual energy machine and a jet flying through a force-field left over from Star Trek.  Those enlightened viewers who are now happily ensconced in the USSA (United Soviet States of America), will see only an affirmation of selfishness and greed driving rich people to be greedier and more selfish. But they may lack perspective.

5430652,1,B00AIBZFDI,"I think the only reasonable way to look at the Atlas Shrugged films is a science fiction film.  They take place on a planet that bears a superficial resemblance to the Earth, but is a very different place.  The society seems to be in the process of developing an economic system, but lacks a clear understanding of what motivates human behavior, and hence they are constantly debating how to structure the economics of their planet.

  At the start of the movie, the people of this world are experiencing a severe energy shortage.  No reason is given for why this shortage is taking place, and except for Dagny Taggart's work on a kind of magic energy machine, no steps are being taken to solve this crisis.  Curiously, the wealthy people who are the main characters in the film seem unaffected by the crisis.

  One problem with the film is that it does a poor job of relating how this imagined world relates to our contemporary society, which is what the best science fiction does.  A good example of this is when Dagny Taggart meets with her company's board of directors, where they decide to close the John Galt line.  This is presented as the board somehow getting in the way of Dagny Taggart's leadership, but doesn't all that depend on the way in which the company is structured?  If the Taggart railroad is a publicly traded company, the board has a legal responsibility to run the company of behalf of the shareholders.  Dagny Taggart would serve at the pleasure of the board of directors.  If it is a privately held company (and given the way it is named after the family, this seems possible), whoever has a controlling share of stock can make decisions of the company.  This is basic capitalism.  Instead, decisions seem to be made mostly to make Dagny sad.

  It's unfortunate that the nature of the economic emergency is never made clear.  During WWII, national economic policies resembled those enacted during the film to some degree, but the WWII was a true national emergency that required the mobilization of the national economy.  Governments have taken much more limited steps to deal with the recessions of the past few years, and while they have not brought about a complete recovery, they have prevented recessions from turning into something far worse.

  It's interesting to contemplate a film that would allow for more imaginative debate on the role of economic systems in building a healthy society.  Unfortunately, Atlas Shrugged, Pt. 2 is not that film.",1363824000,3,2482,4.794811320754717

Perhaps ""Atlas Shrugged 3: John Galt Killed the Electric Car"" will be better.  We were treated to some CGI plane chases, but sadly, they looked as if they were rendered for a Playstation 2.

5430839,5,B00AIBZFDI,"First, consider the obstacles put up to prevent this visual Cliff Notes effort from ever getting onto the screen.  The entire Hollywood establishment trembled in horror when they first discovered anyone would dare to put Ayn Rand's masterpiece on the big screen with Part 1.  Now, again, working under major constraints, this movie succeeded tremendously, both visually and in following the key points of the book.  The performers must be commended for admirable performances.  But the real story, the reason everyone, especially PC brainwashed public school children should watch this movie is the basic message it presents to the audience; the scenes where an incompetent bureaucracy blindly leapfrogs the nation toward utter economic destruction.  Many of the scenes, the choice of words, the blame-game, are all part of our government today, especially the executive office.  I sincerely hope Part III survives the unending viseral attacks by the socialists/academics who can't stand to look in the virtual mirror at themselves as they view this movie.  For those who slept through history class (or after the schools switched to textbooks rife with propaganda), this amazingly successful nation was built on capitalism and every nation throughout history that dipped their toe in Marxism has economically collapsed. Ayn Rand lived through such a horrific event growing up in the USSR at the turn of the 20th century (described in her first book, ""We the Living"" which should also be on every university students 'must read' list.

While I had no trouble following part 1, having read the book, I wonder if the viewer can follow part 2 without seeing part 1 and/or reading the book.  Movie is well done and I love the stupidity of big government and the subborn resistance of those who represent personal responsibility and initiative.  Part 2 ends  before the end of the book's story so maybe another part will be coming.  Having read the book, however, they may have to improvise a movie ending to the story.

Well it here, and more is coming over the next few years. Remember, all it takes for evil to exist is for good people to do nothing. We will quietly give up our rights in return for ""public good,"" and will not even raise a eyebrow until it's too late. It is the ""frog in the pot of cold water versus hot water"" syndrome. America is entering its twilight years without the possibility of a reprieve, and this movie along with its first episode is simply showing how it can happen so quickly.

5430901,4,B00AIBZFDI,"Watching Atlas Shrugged Part II I couldn't help make comparisons with America today--especially the shocking growth of the federal government's power in just the last few decades. Things are not exactly like Ayn Rand envisioned, but we think of her when we pump gas! I thought the story moved along at a good clip and a lot of very difficult concepts were explained pretty well without being boring; I watched with my 16-year old daughter, who of course learns NO economics at school, and only had to explain one thing (why they couldn't afford to fix the broken railroad). She really liked it a lot, which surprised us (and her!) as she really likes movies with a lot of action/not much talking. She much preferred the first Howard Roark though, and I confess I don't understand why the entire cast was changed. Several other reviewers mentioned this and I'm with them--and why was Dagney so much older looking? Yikes. Rand ""good guys"" are supposed to be filled with inner energy and always up to the next challenge, this Dagney looked like she hadn't slept in weeks. The new Mrs. Roark looked liked a cheap tart instead of the high society cow she was in the first movie (and in the book, if memory serves). The brother was certainly more charismatic in this movie, I guess, but he seemed slimy rather than incompetent. In the first part he came off as a useful idiot who just doesn't understand how things work while in part II he seems like a manipulative bastard--I don't even mind changes from the book, but this is supposed to be a continuation so changing the characters is confusing to say the least.
Anyway, I enjoyed it, as did my husband, who has never read the book. Most importantly, my daughter watched the entire movie with us and liked it a lot (we don't make her watch movies with us, though we do make her ""try"" for 10-15 mins before deciding).",1362700800,,1863,4.597597597597598

5430923,2,B00AIBZFDI,"The film suffers from attempting to make a modern adaptation of Ayn Rand's master piece. Part 2 does better than Part 1 as we now see the cell phones and computers in abundance. However, alternative energy seems nonexistent. Indeed with gas at $40.00 a gallon, Volts and Prius would be everywhere. Since plastic comes from petroleum, the use of plastic as a coffee cup lid would have ceased. But the film was made to show us that when all the world's best and brightest are taken away, Sean Hannity would be left behind and no one can fill the void of those wonderful job creators.

No matter which side of the political spectrum you are on the film agrees with both: The poor couldn't exist without the rich. Henry Rearden (Jason Beghe) is quite the despicable character to be the hero of libertarian capitalism. He makes amateur speeches similar to those made by tax protesters I knew in the 1980s...the ones who ended up in jail. His message is simple: Government is evil. Taxes are robbery. Tax money given to help everyone but himself, goes to looters. In this film capitalism has gotten so out of control, they force the hand of government to nationalize all business and created a sudden communistic society by executive order. Can't happen, but try to go with it.

There is a gross exaggeration of the battle between capitalism and socialism, as if the two can not coexist in one society, except it does exist that way in every society to one degree or another. However, they don't exist exclusively without each other. You hear the mantra of the barter system ""True value for value."" Hand me my barf bag.

The main problem I had with the film was not the exaggerated if not cartoonish view it took on economics, but the stiff cardboard characters who can't act. The directing, editing, and screen adaptation also left much to be desired. And yet, as bad as it was, it was an improvement over the first film.",1362614400,,1916,4.629411764705883

The director and entire cast of Part I have been replaced for this installment, the budget has increased a little, the FX are improved, and all these changes seem to have been for the better.  Samantha Mathis and Jason Beghe make a more believable and less wooden Dagny and Hank than were their Part I counterparts.  There's more and better action this time around, the soundtrack has been punched up a little, and once again the sets and FX look like they belong in a movie with two or three times the budget.  All in all, with one exception, this film is a distinct improvement over Part I.

That exception, unfortunately, is a serious one.  Atlas Shrugged is a story with a message, one which emerges in full force in part 2 of the novel.  In the movie, however, the meat of this message seems to have gotten lost among the cocktail parties and train wrecks and sign-waving demonstrations and jet plane chases.  We learn a lot about *what* is happening to the country as it nears total collapse, but we learn little about  *why* it is happening.  The problem is that in this story the ""why"" is far more important.

The most glaring example: In the book, while en route to Colorado (by rail, of course,) Dagny encounters a stowaway tramp who turns out to be a former employee of the now-defunct Twentieth Century Motor Company, the factory where Dagny and Hank discovered the prototype energy generator.  She befriends him, and he tells her at length about the failure of the company after being turned into a Marxist collective by its new owners.  This is, perhaps, the most powerful chapter in the entire novel: a chilling, dramatic, entirely too believable tale of souls being crushed en masse in the name of ""the common good;"" a once-proud company falling to ruin as its workers find that the New Order rewards political maneuvering and backstabbing over ability and integrity.  It finally, fully reveals just what the Makers are up against, and it is ugly.

This tale easily warranted ten or fifteen minutes of screen time.  Instead, we got a 90-second monologue from a track worker beside a stalled train; yeah, these people took over the company and it was bad, and the guy that invented the generator said he'd stop the motor of the world, blah blah, let's wrap it up because Dagny has a date to wreck a Learjet in a few minutes.  I realize that some severe condensation of Rand's story was necessary to avoid a 36-hour run time, but the glossing over of this and a few other powerful moments (""Who are you?"" ""I. AM. JOHN. GALT!"" - way to hit us over the head with it, people) is very disappointing.

Bottom line: Atlas Shrugged II is watchable; it's a definite improvement over Part I, and will impress those unfamiliar with the novel a lot more than Part I did.  For those who have read the book, however, it's something of a letdown.  I'll watch Part III when it's released, but the cautious optimism I expressed in my review of Part I is pretty much gone.  Three stars, and we'll see this fall whether Part III can drive the story's point home in a way that this installment did not.",1362441600,,3815,4.67814371257485

The film and acting quality was a bit off and in need of some slight improvement, so I was excited to sit down and watch the second installment as I heard it had a bigger budget and more star power. What a let-down!!! Don't get me wrong, the message was spot on, but the special effects and computer animation looked like it was done by the Smallville tv show crew in their first year and the acting by the female lead was horrific!!! Why did they change the cast anyway?! There was nothing wrong with the first movie as cast. It just needed a little more work. If I had it my way, they wouldn't make the third part to Atlas Shrugged until they had the cast from the first movie remake the second one, it was that bad. My only realistic hope is that after whoever butchers the third movie, a Christopher Nolan type will relaunch the franchise with his vision and talent. With all the talent there is out there and with how great the book Atlas Shrugged is I cannot believe how bad the second movie was.

No it is not a blockbusting box office smash or oscar winner. But it is a dose of reality the world needs to wake up to.  The growth of over bearing Liviathan governments the world over and sadly here in the United States, where the Constitution no longer matters, should be of deep concern to all. This movie could be a great motivator for the people to wake up and understand where we are heading.

5431013,2,B00AIBZFDI,"Overall, better than part 1. The characters of Rearden and Francisco are closer to those in the book. Better editing and overall production.

Worse: the actress who plays Dagny Taggart is better suited to play the role of some bitter housewife in middle America. Sean Hannity and Fox news as messengers of reason?

The more fundamental question is this: without reading the book, does the movie offer a self-consistent and self-contained story-line? I think not. [Examples of good adaptations: Gone with the wind, The Pelican Brief]",1362268800,,532,5.174418604651163

5431016,1,B00AIBZFDI,part 1 was quite good. This part 2 was atrocious. All the actors changed. The acting was awful. Production values were cheap.

5431017,5,B00AIBZFDI,"I was happy to see Atlas Shrugged get a deserved Part II.  The message in Part II comes through even stronger in this film, even moreso than the first.  The book by Ayn Rand is so immense, that I think it would have been better served as a 10-part miniseries.  There's SO much information and the plot is so dense, that even spanning it over three 2-hour films feels rushed.  Relationships and plot elements ""just happen"" because the story has to keep moving.  There's so much ground to cover.

Aside from that fact, the acting is well done.  I know there were major cast changes to the principle roles from Part I, particularly Dagney and Reardon.  I didn't think those changes added anything to the film.  I really enjoyed both actors from the first film.  While Samantha Mathis also does a great job here as the new Dagney, Michael Biehen as Reardon (who I've loved in other things) just seems too worn out and tired of a guy to take on the world in this epic battle.  He's also significantly older than the previous actor, who I really missed.

Production values are overall, pretty good.  I'd heard they raised the budget for this installment and that the effects were much better than Part I.  I didn't see any real problem with the Part I effects.  Having said that, there are moments in this film, where the CGI is SO bad, it's cringe-worthy.  Most of the wide, geographical vistas look completely phoney and the plane crash sqeuence that opens and closes the film looks so fake, it seems like a video game image.  I'm stunned than anyone would accept that in the final cut.  The film ""Alive"" did one of the most famous plane crash sequences ever put to film with NO CGI and that was over 20 years ago.  Why didn't the director take a ""less is more"" approach when handling that scene?

The best part about this film is its message and it's even more central in this installment.  Reardon, during his congressional indictment hearing, Francisco and a few others have great monologues that make profound statements.  I'm giving this film 5 stars for its timeliness and courage to put forth a message that a sleepwalking American public needs to hear at the 11th hour, with its best days seemingly behind it.

It's the oldest trick in the book.  Whenever anyone wants to control another person or group of people, you have to make them AFRAID first.  Fear is the real weapon.  Once you make them afraid, you simply propose a solution that will ""protect"" them from that big, scary problem (and serve YOUR interests at the same time).  It's the easiest way to get people to agree to things they would NEVER logically consent to outright.

I'm NOT a conservative, Republican or even a Democrat.  One need only look at America's history over the last 100 years and you can easily see the ""problem-reaction-solution"" game that's been played by self-serving government powerbrokers to further their own interests, whittle away freedoms and make the citizenry even more subordinate to them.  No matter where you stand on the issues, it's VERY clear that more government involvment in anything is NEVER a good thing.  The US government was originally intended to be VERY, VERY small, with only 39 specific duties delegated to it.  Whether it's gun control, government sponsored ""free"" healthcare or anything else; the result is always the same.  In return for ""protection"", you get more regulation and less freedom.  Americans need to wake up.  Atlas Shrugged is happening NOW and as long as there are those who refuse to exert their own power, there will be those more than willing to take it from them...in return for ""protection"".",1362182400,3,3630,4.717011128775835
5431018,5,B00AIBZFDI,this adaption of Ayn rands book is fairly fast moving and entertaining.  for those of you not familiar with the Book this can be a shocking wakeup call to the abuses our federal government is imposing on the producers in this country.  maybe this movie demonstrates the reason why Companies keep shipping jobs overseas!,1362182400,,319,4.888888888888889

It seemed to me that the players in the first movie had an interest in the book itself and the casting seemed quite smooth. Part 2,in my opinion seems like a cheaply done sequel where the actors are doing this for the paycheck and a rather low budget affair. In particular, the role of Dagny Taggart,who in the first part  nails her part both in acting and physical appearance  perfectly. Her successor,played by Samantha Mathis, never has me believing that she can run a railroad, much less track down John Galt in a plane. The movie still has its moments and is worthwhile if you want to introduce someone to Ayn Rand without throwing a 1000 page book at them.

I should mention that at one point we stopped the movie so that my wife could nip into the kitchen to bring back a glass of tea, and while I was waiting I flipped over to one of the cable news channels (where the talk was all of the sequestration apocalypse) and I thought for a minute that I had put the movie back on!

This video, like Part I, captures the essence of the message and the warnings that are presented in the book.  I am not a film expert so I make no reference to artistic presentation or acting.  One word of caution to the viewer, you must quickly adjust to the ""time juxtaposition"" in part II DVD before you can fully absorb the important message being presented.  If you watch both DVDs in succession you may be initially concerned with the time shift and actor changes but that is a minor issue with respect to the message. I was just interested in the message and how I might get people to take the presented issues seriously.  Showing my friends DVDs -- Part I and Part II -- encouraged some to read the book.  That is valuable! Maybe some will see the parallels to today's society and where we could be headed if we, as a country, are not more circumspect and cautious.",1362096000,4,1167,4.420560747663552

5431092,5,B00AIBZFDI,"I watched Part 1 and Part 2 of Atlas Shrugged one after the other and having read other reviews, I can't say I agree that Part 2 is a repeat of Part 1 and that it is slower. I found I liked the revamped cast better than the original (although Grant Bowler is always one of my personal favorites). I thought Samantha Mathis did a very good job as Dagney Taggart, owner of the railroad in dispute throughout most of this story. I went into Part 2 not having read any reviews and as I said, directly after watching Part 1. I don't know if that made a difference in my opinion or not, but I found The Strike to be quite exciting and the essence of Ayn Rand's point seemed to be made more openly than the subtleness of Part 1.

I gave it 5 stars, something I don't do easily for movies (well, that's only partly true, I tend to only review the movies I like because I don't enjoy writing bad reviews - just me). I thought it moved along quickly, there was more involvement in the actual factories which was nice because we got to see the product, and basically how it's made and the employees involved in making it. In Part 2, the government seems to be winning this sort of war by using nefarious political strong arm tactics and by blackmailing the business people. I thought this had a very strong cast, and I thought the story was told a bit better as there were more visuals and explanations than in the first part. There is never any doubt, however, which side of this debate Ayn Rand stands on. She obviously saw the evils of Communism and wanted to write something people could relate to that would have an impact on a generation that seemed to be tuned out (the book was written, I think, in 1958). The only weak link, I thought, was the mysterious disappearance of the smartest and best creative thinkers, industrial owners, and artists by a darkly almost sinister figure named John Galt. I know the third movie of the series should settle it all out, if we get to see it, but the thread and threat of John Galt throughout the two movies could have been fleshed out a bit more, explained a bit clearer. There was also one discussion about John Galt and his mysterious Atlantis - a place where freedom reigns. Not having read the book, I'm at a disadvantage to compare it to the book, but in terms of strictly storyline, either leave it out altogether, except minor references, or give us more information. It seemed to be handled a bit clumsily in my opinion. But again, not having read the book, there could be a good reason for it and so it did not figure into my rating.

I loved the ending, except now I have to wait until next summer (if they make the 3rd installment at all considering the negative reviews the 2nd installment got - which, to me, is possibly more scary than the story itself. Are people rating it because of their political persuasions, or because of the story? Just asking) for the finale. I bought both Part 1 and Part 2 here on Amazon, something I don't do a lot of these days because I thought it was just that good and worth owning. Keeping my fingers crossed for Part 3. Sure would like to see where these producers take the story. Otherwise, I'll have to read it. Yikes! It's 1,100 pages long! So, I loved both of these movies. I guess I just don't see all the negatives other people saw in the second movie. I would encourage you to rent it and think for yourself! After all, that's the very essence of Ayn Rand's writing. Don't just take things for granted and do what you're told. Think for yourself, be free, embrace free enterprise, because humanity hasn't grown as fast as their technology has grown. Wisdom, peace, understanding come with age and experience. I believe Ms. Rand wrote Atlas Shrugged to show just how far humans have to go before the responsibility of all of society's enterprises can be managed by one entity and that the capitalistic system has been set up with checks and balances needed to keep one group of humans from becoming all powerful. As they say, and it fits with the theme of this series of movies, power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.",1362009600,,4121,4.428194993412385

5431097,3,B00AIBZFDI,"I am a fan of the book. I am also a fan of the first Atlas Shrugged movie. I had read about the pros and cons of Part II switching out most of the original cast, but in my opinion there were NO pros to this. I thought the actors and style of the first movie were much better. Based on the descriptions in the book, the actors in Part I fit my imagined view of them much better. The lady that played Dagny in Part II looks older than the book seemed to indicate. The new actors are a distracting change to the plot of the movie and are not an improvement in any way that I can see. I didn't look to see, but I expect that there was a different director for Part II as well, as the style change was bothersome to me as well. I always bothers me when a new director takes the reins midway through a series of movies and they just can't resist `adding their particular flare' to the remainder of the series instead of trying keep the viewers /customers happy with what they were used to and expecting for the remainder of the series. One example in this case, that I especially didn't like, was the long pauses where the cameras were just fixed on Dagny, or sometimes the other actors, for what seemed like forever - and apparently for no cause. It wasn't watching as they were doing something important, just simply a long annoying stare. I would have preferred the content of the book been brought out more instead of wasting so much time on these odd, long, staring sessions. I assume it's supposed to be some form of an artistic tactic, but I'm interested in these movies for their representation of the book and its message being portrayed as fully as possible, not on artistic flare at the expense of the proper portrayal of the book. If I had my way, they'd need to redo Part II with the original director and cast, and then proceed to Part III. As of this point I will probably buy Part III when it comes out, but not because I'm eager to see the movie, but purely because I want the whole story and don't want a busted series. Even if they get the original director and actors back for Part III, it is now a busted series and I just don't like that. The only reason this gets 3 Stars from me is because of the content and message -exposure of the book itself - but I'm not a fan of this movie at all as far as the movie goes. Hopefully it's not the death nail in Part III.",1362009600,,2377,4.1695652173913045

The message is true to her original story, Atlas Shrugged, as well as fully developed and realistic in it's present day approach to the book.

The actors are truly spectacular. You truly believe you are watching a biopic, and not a movie.
Well done to all those who are pushing through with this seminal work! This trilogy is going to bring to light the very reality we are currently facing and just how far that can go (and will go) if left unchecked.

Bravo and Brava to all who worked on and participated within this most important movie!

5431152,4,B00AIBZFDI,"How sad to live in a world where you only enjoy the books and movies that reflect your own  beliefs and you hate art That represents anything different!  So many reviewers here are not looking at the art or artist but just cheering for their own political team.  I am a LIBERAL. I loved the book and thoroughly enjoyed the movie, part I and part II. do you have to be a mafioso to love the Soprano's or appreciate The Godfather? Do you need to be southern to love Gone With the Wind? Yes, I do want to see the wealthiest Americans pay taxes too, but that does 't mean that I am not all for free enterprise and corporations being allowed to turn a profit. yes I believe that every American should be able to buy healthcare without being excluded because of a Pre-existing condition but that certainly doesn't mean I am in favor of socialized medicine . Moderates exist! You can be left wing without being a communist!  Even Democrats might enjoy Ayn Rand as a brilliant writer and appreciate her tale of warning regarding the horrors of the repressive communism she fled.  News flash:  all liberals do Not hate Ayn Rand!  Oh, about the movie........I loved how it was set in modern times...I thought that worked well.  I did find Dagney Part II to be distractingly old, especially in contrast with Dagney Part 1, but this was not a deal killer for me.  I have never been a big fan of movies broken into seperate parts with the release dates years apart from each other ( Hobbit, Twighlight, Star Wars, Harry Potter, etc)  Unless I am very familiar with the book and the characters, it is hard to remember what happened in the preceeding part. I am not sure this movie would be that enjoyable to someone who had not read the book...unless they wait for Part 3 to come out and then watch all parts back to back.  But for those who enjoyed the book, I think the movie is a pleasure to see, especially in that it challenges us to look for parallels in our present culture (yes, even open minded liberals can find that thought provoking!).
