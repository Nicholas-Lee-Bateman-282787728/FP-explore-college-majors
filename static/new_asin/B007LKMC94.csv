5098924,5,B007LKMC94,"First of all, this is by far the most generous Bluray disc to date - 4 hrs. 15mins and all music - no documentary filler. This demonstrates how cheap the labels are with their releases - some with as little as 80 mins. Why aren't they utilizing the huge bluray disc capacity to give us more music? I think we all know the answer to that one - $$$!

Here we are treated to the last eight Mozart piano concerti played wonderfully by Daniel Barenboim at the height of his pianistic capability in the late '80's, aided and abetted by the Berlin Philharmonic on a diet. I am one who thinks that Barenboim's conducting has greatly improved over the last 20 years, whereas his piano playing may have suffered a bit. Here, he is slim, suave, debonair and perfectly coiffed. Quite the matinee idol!

The setting for this extravaganza is the Siemens-Villa,in Berlin, in what looks like a very large drawing room. Eighteenth century chairs and carved baroque music stands sit on the parquet floor. None of your stackable convention center chairs and adjustable utilitarian stands here! This is movie-making! I don't know how many cameras were used, but none is visible.

If you love Mozart, you are a shoo-in for this set. There is none of the (dare I say it?)original instrument nonsense here, just a small perfectly executed orchestral accompaniment to some lovely piano playing. All cadenzas seem to be Barenboim's own - good for him!

It is a tribute to the quality of the original 35mm. film of these concerts that they could be converted to such good-looking bluray video. And thank you, Euroarts for not giving us any of your fake surround sound. Let us do our own processing if we so desire. The PCM sound is very good. Modern HD cameras have greater depth of field, but here, the field is not that deep, and there are no audience shots because there is no audience. Color saturation is not 2012, but how could it be, recorded in the mid to late eighties. Still very acceptable.

Apparently, there are other filmed concerts that may be available for this kind of endeavor, and if that's the case, I can't wait to see them. Come on, Euroarts, let's go!

Don't hesitate!",1336953600,17,2165,4.639686684073107

5098926,5,B007LKMC94,"Highly recommended is this generous Blu-ray DVD of the last 8 piano concertos of Mozart (4+ hours). The setting is stunning....the Baroque Siemens-villa in Berlin. It is a great production, shot on 35mm film and digitally remastered and meticulously restored..but it is not exceptional since video is slightly grainy, flesh tones pinkish blotchy at times and audio is only in stereo. If you want to see exceptional restoration see the Arthur Rubenstein DVD (Greig, Chopin, Saint-Saens) shot 15 years earlier. Never-the-less video and audio exceeds many classical performances on DVD with the exception of newer Blu-ray recordings. Five stars for tremendous value.",1365206400,3,663,5.509803921568627
5098927,5,B007LKMC94,"Daniel Barenboim is an excellent pianist and conductor: he does both in this blu-ray. He looks much younger than would be expected because this concert was recorded in 1986-89. As a result, even though the original tapes were remastered, the blu-ray is a bit grainy. Nonetheless I am glad to have it: the sound is excellent. I will watch it many times.",1359158400,2,352,4.693548387096774
5098928,5,B007LKMC94,A truly wonderful dvd on some of mozarts piano concertos. It has a very fluid and consistent feel and it has been excellent filmed and recorded and barenboim's magic over Mozart is truly bewildering. It's an enriching watch.,1358380800,,224,4.921052631578948

5098930,3,B007LKMC94,"I bought this simply for completing my collection. The Berlin Philharmonic orchestra performance is fine as always. But because this is re-mastered, it far lags modern digital recordings in terms of video quality and audio quality. The picture colors are just bland, un-life-like. The audio is acceptable but not comparable to modern-day CDs or DVDs. And unfortunately, without a great audio quality for the piano instrument, Daniel Barenboim's performance just seem/sound ""flat"" and ""mechanical"" without little artistic values. I can't recommend this product.",1352505600,7,560,5.759036144578313
5098931,5,B007LKMC94,"Lovers of the Mozart piano concertos should run, not walk, to get their copy of this collection.  Done in 1987-89, the performances all include Daniel Barenboim at the piano, accompanied by the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra.  Audio and video transfers are impeccable.  All that might be missing is an audience to help cheer on the performers.

Concertos #20 and #24 are my personal favorites, but there is plenty to enjoy in all these eight masterpieces.  Considering someone who might not be moved by #24, and especially #20, one would have to believe they are either deaf or incapable of emotion.  Sadly, there are people like that.

For the rest of us, buy these concertos before they are out of print and unavailable.  I think of the DVD with Mitsuko Uchida on Deutsche Grammophone, as an example.  Her rendition of #20 is another rouser that shouldn't be missed.  One can only hope that DG will bring this one back soon for others to enjoy.

This Barenboim DVD gets a 5-star rating and is highly recommended.  Even the most casual music lover will be captivated by the performances.  Bravo!",1347321600,5,1095,4.82258064516129
5098932,5,B007LKMC94,buy this disc and you will not repent...the most beautiful concerts of Mozart with the best pianist and one the best orchestra in the world,1343779200,3,139,4.6
5098933,5,B007LKMC94,"I could not resist getting this blu-ray, which combines the programs from four laserdiscs that I have treasured for twenty years.
AUDIO--The LD audio was great, but the blu-ray audio is significantly better. Barenboim and the reduced forces of the Berliner Philharmoniker have never sounded better. This is a nice complement to Barenboim's recent release of the Beethoven Sonatas (DVD) and Concertos (blu-ray).
VIDEO--Though the blu-ray is promoted as coming from 35 mm film, in fact the laserdisc is in Academic Ratio, and the blu-ray must be masked, as they say. The picture is then blown up to fill the 16:9 TV screen. As a result the moving parts of the picture are really jumpy--things like fingers moving across the piano, hands conducting, strings bowing, all those things that draw your eye. Unfortunately there seems to be a mini-trend in Germany to mask and blow-up nice classical music programs. The same treatment was given to Bach's Matthew Passion, and I have recently seen a third program announced as ""upgraded"" to widescreen. I wish they wouldn't.
SIMPLE SOLUTION--I tried downsizing the picture to the size it would have had if it had not been masked and zoomed, and it worked! There was less picture on the screen than with the laserdisc, but the motion was no longer in blur. So with the recommendation that this be done, I withdraw any reservations from this release and, in view of the generous timing and excellent audio, have no trouble giving it five stars. I just ask the producers not to do this again to a video. There isn't much point to a full-screen picture that hurts the eyes.",1339632000,23,1609,4.8545454545454545
5098934,5,B007LKMC94,"When you buy this disk, you'll get an incredible amount of music for your money (255 minutes), originally filmed in 35 mm and transferred into very decent (stereo) audio and clear, but somewhat soft video. Be aware that these are not exactly ""live"" recordings made in the Berlin Siemens Villa - an ornate venue - from 1986-1989, at least not in today's common usage: there is no audience, everything is beautifully ""staged"" without the excitement (and obvious risks) of a concert/audience setting. Perhaps these recordings could be called dress rehearsals, if they were not quite so perfect. Let's call them meditations for piano and orchestra... Regardless of their original intent, they turn out to be an invaluable documentation of Daniel Barenboim at the apex of his powers as a pianist in intense (mostly unsmiling) collaboration with the BPO musicians (apart from the occasional token female still all-male at the time) who had just recovered from the Karajan decades and display both razor-sharp precision as a group and impressive solo work by the first desks. The orchestra has been slimmed down in size respective with the individual works, but may at times still appear fairly large for today's standards of Mozart performance. Barenboim's approach is strictly ""classicist"": he eschews any kind of extemporized, ad-lib ornamentation or embellishments, as they are practiced by more period-aware pianists nowadays. He sticks to the letter of the score, except in the cadenzas, many of which are his own and very good. Conducting from the piano is still one of his preferences, and he does quite well here, with a bit of help from the different concertmasters. It is important to note that piano and orchestra are equal partners in these performances, both in the way they are recorded and in Barenboim's direction which never fails to showcase an instrumental solo voice and gives full rein to the orchestra in the tutti passages. This sets them pleasantly apart from many contemporary recordings with miserably over-miked pianos and sonically undernourished ensembles.

As to the individual concerts, I'll not go into much detail. Each and every one is played very well, with plenty of energy, power, elegance and nuance. My favorites are numbers 21 (emotional without being sentimental, spunky in the finale), 23 (stylish, nimble, reminiscent of the late Monique Haas), 24 (muscular, dramatic, foreshadowing Beethoven), 25 (festive and radiant with the exception of the somewhat tentative finale) and 26 (obviously one of the earlier recordings, spontaneous and well shaped in all its dynamics). Number 20, the most frequently played and, at the same time, the most enigmatic of the lot, is very fine, but here I prefer both Mitsuko Uchida and Stefan Vladar (with Hartmut Haenchen) on DVD, and in number 22 my vote goes to David Fray (with Jaap van Zweden) who has more subtlety. It is interesting to compare his earlier recording of 22 with Barenboim's later (2006) remake in the Prague European Concert. I could go on and on, but we are now on highly subjective ground. In sum: get these recordings and you will enjoy many hours of exquisite Mozart.",1337385600,38,3163,5.117988394584139
8519380,5,B007LKMC94,"Besides the expected outstanding performance by soloist and orchestra, this is a tremendous bargain,  in terms of both money and convenience. It runs Mozart's finest orchestral music for hours and hours without a need for a disk change. It's one of the favorite items in my immense collection of classical music.

8519388,4,B007LKMC94,"I am not a musician so I don't feel qualified to comment on the technical aspect of the performance. I have never witnessed a bad video performance by Barenboim and this one is no exception. This older recording, originally on 35mm film, has been expertly remastered. in digital PCM stereo. Audio and video quality are very good. The performances are in a ballroom-like locale with the camera facing large windows only partly covered by drapery. Only one of the eight performances appear to be before a live audience.
While a theatrical atmosphere with a live audience would, in my opinion, greatly improve the visual aspects one can not fault either Barenboims nor the Berlin Philharmonics performance. I rate this recording as four stars instead of five only because of slightly outdated sound quality and the lack of a more theatrical live audience atmosphere. Despite these reservations I highly recommend this recording.",1402358400,3,925,5.132450331125828
8519389,5,B007LKMC94,"Although not all of equal merit, these are probably Mozart's finest compositions for the combined forces of Piano and Orchestra. At its best, the music is more sublime than  he wrote in any other form, excepting the String Quintets and the most celebrated Operas. On these two discs, they receive stunning performances from Barenboim and the BPO.  The orchestra is scaled down to the dimensions of a small symphony rather than a chamber orchestra, that is very much my preference. This allows the grandeur and sonority of the accompaniment to be appreciated in all its glory, without detriment to the sensuous poetry of the piano scores. For whatever reason, the personnel come and go over the span of the 8 performances, and the players are not identical throughout, making for an intriguing game of ""spot the differences"". The audience-free auditorium accommodates the players snugly, and offers just the right ambience for a Mozart recital. It could have stepped right out of the settings of any of his operas and offers plenty for the camera to focus on.
Combining the roles of conductor and soloist, Barenboim turns in one of his finest performances in both capacities. At first, this is a little disconcerting. He insists on standing as much and as long as possible in the former function, and the viewer/listener is faced with the dangerous possibility that he may not make it to the keyboard in time. Thankfully, that never happens, but it does add to the excitement. When seated, he never misses an opportunity to use an unemployed hand to control the flow of the music. He exercises a mystical control over his forces to the point of unison at which one might say that these are not concertos at all, but symphonies for Piano and Orchestra. His keyboard playing is ravishing in touch, tone, timing and timbre: 10 (or often just 5) fingers digging deep into the music to bring out every layer of poetry, spirituality, harmony, and even occasional dissonance with faultless accuracy and confidence. We see him in middle-age, still trailing the vestiges of his prodigial youth, so much more charismatic than the greyer, more somber Barenboim of the present. This persona is perfectly captured, as are his flying stubby fingers, by the excellent camera team, who also bring us fascinating cameos of the orchestra and its individual instrumentalists. One caveat: I have heard and seen both the Blu-Ray and regular DVD versions, and the sound quality is much superior in the former to the point where the extra cost is truly worth while.",1397347200,5,2541,4.934579439252336
