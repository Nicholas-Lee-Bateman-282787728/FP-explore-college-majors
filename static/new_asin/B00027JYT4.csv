8023202,4,B00027JYT4,"Unless you have a taste for old school, heavy-handed, unashamedly red blooded Victorian melodrama, then I would steer clear of this or any other Tod Slaughter movie that you might run across. However if you enjoy English history and would like to see what the Victorians considered a good time, then you owe it to yourself to check out this double feature starring the inestimable Mister Slaughter (1885-1956). Already well known for touring throughout the country in the 1910s and 20s (with time off to fight in World War I), Slaughter teamed up with ""Quota Quickie"" producer George King to make film versions of Slaughter's best known and most successful melodramas (FYI a ""quota quickie"" referred to an English film made for very little money to help offset the rising imports of Hollywood movies). His signature role was as SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET (where do you think the idea for the musical came from?) which is also available but this double feature contains his other signature role, Squire Corder in MURDER IN THE RED BARN as well as his most frightening film THE FACE AT THE WINDOW and in the best quality prints available so far. This Arcanum Entertainment (Johnny Legend) release is the way to go to get a proper introduction to Tod who was to British horror what Karloff & Lugosi were to American horror. The informative liner notes by horror film specialist Ken Hanke are also a big plus. There are quality prints out there but they British and therefore Region 2.

MARIA MARTEN OR MURDER IN THE RED BARN was Slaughter's first film and was made in 1935 when he was already 50 years old and had been barnstorming up and down the U.K. for years. It is based on a stage melodrama which is based on a ballad that was based on actual events that took place in 1827. It would have been well known to British audiences of the time, second only to SWEENEY TODD which Slaughter & King would film after the success of this movie. Slaughter plays William Corder, a local squire who promises country girl Maria Marten that he will marry her only to murder her in the title structure so that he can marry a wealthy spinster. Maria's mother has a dream for several nights running that her daughter was murdered and buried in the barn. When Corder is finally forced to dig in the barn, he cracks up and then breaks down and is taken away to be executed. In classic 19th century style, Slaughter rubs his hands, leers lasciviously, and invites the audience to boo and hiss him which, apparently, they did wholeheartedly. The movie opens in a provincial theater where we are formally introduced to the characters who are about to perform the play and then the movie proper begins. A nice touch. As someone who spent 20 years doing regional theater and who once worked on that most classic of melodramas. THE DRUNKARD OR THE FALLEN SAVED, I had no trouble relating to the very theatrical goings on.

THE FACE AT THE WINDOW is a rather different affair made 4 years later in 1939. While Slaughter is up to his old tricks, relishing his misdeeds and lusting after the heroine, he is also a serial murderer known as ""The Wolf"" who is terrorizing all of 19th century Paris. Just before each murder occurs, a hideous face appears outside the window of each victim. This visage is truly disturbing and steers the film toward outright horror. That and a sequence of reanimating a corpse to reveal the true identity of the murderer makes THE FACE AT THE WINDOW the best of Slaughter's ""quota quickies"". Only THE GREED OF WILLIAM HART made after World War II and based on the exploits of real life grave robbers Burke & Hare can lay claim to being Slaughter's best film. While I am a huge Tod Slaughter fan, it's hard to recommend him to a modern day audience. If they laugh at the original DRACULA and FRANKENSTEIN, they should find Tod hysterical. Instead they would probably find him very boring. Old school melodrama was never meant to be taken seriously and today's horror fans want their horror straight and as boringly realistic as possible. So if you enjoy all things British, don't mind some obvious theatricality, and are a fan of old school 1930s horror films, this double bill will be a treat. If you're not, then it's your loss.",1411948800,,4251,4.644090305444887
8023203,1,B00027JYT4,"I ordered JOHNNY LEGEND'S DEADLY DOUBLES VOL 2 because a previous commentator wrote that the
manufacturer had stopped sending out defective copies with no sound for Murder in the Red Barn.
Not so.  Fortunately the seller (not the manufacturer) is refunding my money.
BUYER BEWARE! THERE SEEMS TO BE NO WAY TO BE SURE YOU'LL GET A PROPER COPY.",1348876800,,342,4.796610169491525
8023204,5,B00027JYT4,"Yes, my first copy had the audio problem, but the replacement played fine, so don't be afraid to buy this fine introduction to an overlooked horror star. In his highly theatrical way, Tod Slaughter was as enjoyable as Karloff or Lugosi, and, as a few reviewers have noted, no actor ever had so much fun being Bad (with a capital B)!  FACE is probably his best and BARN is his first; both films are eminently watchable with good picture quality. So, give Europe's Horror Man a chance; if you love '30s and '40s fright films, chances are you won't regret it. I, for one, hope to see more Slaughter on DVD.",1102723200,7,603,4.4324324324324325
8023205,5,B00027JYT4,"Based on the review above, I contacted the company before buying this title.  They told me that though the initial pressing was missing the audio on the second title, it was caught almost immediately and only 125 copies got to market with this problem.  They also informed me that they would replace any defective copies if you drop them an email at their website.  With this assurance, I went ahead and purchased a copy.  To my delight, it not only plays perfectly, but both films are sharp, crisp and the best, most complete versions of these films available anywhere.  The Alpha video version of MITRB looks like mud next to this.  Extensive liner notes and beautiful packaging all around.  A ""must-have"" for Slaughter fans and devotees of classic horror.",1101081600,10,758,4.829457364341085

8023207,4,B00027JYT4,"This 1940 George King production from British Lion Studios is a delightfully evil if somewhat hokey little horror film.  The setting is Paris, France in the year 1880, and a series of murders has the populace in mortal terror of ""Le Loup"" (""the wolf"").  Why the killer is described as a wolfman is beyond me because in each case, the victim sees a horrifying face in the window and is stabbed in the back with a dagger.  When M. de Brisson's bank is robbed during one murder, he fears he will be ruined financially.  Then a new client, Chevalier Del Gardo appears to entrust a substantial amount of money to his care; the Chevalier's motives are far from noble, however, as he wants the hand of the young, beautiful Cecile de Brisson in return for his help.  Cecile is in love with ""lowly"" bank clerk Lucien Cortier, and Del Gardo attempts to frame him for the murders.  Several additional murders are perpetrated during the course of the story, and Lucien's last opportunity to prove his innocence involves a great new discovery made by a ""mad"" (yet noble) scientist.  This scientist has successfully used electricity to reanimate dead animals, and he is convinced that he can do the same for a dead human; in this manner, one of Le Loup's victims will be able to come back just long enough to name his murderer.
I found this to be an excellent early horror flick.  Some elements of the plot are a little ridiculous, but the actors play their parts exceedingly well and do not at any time overdramatize and thus undermine the story.  Tod Slaughter plays the evil Chevalier Del Gardo to the hilt and could rightfully make reference to a truly evil cackle on his acting resume, John Warwick as Lucien Cortier shines as the quintessential hero determined to clear his name and nab the true killer, and Marjorie Taylor is delightful as Cecile de Brisson.  The special effects, such as they are, are also very effective, particularly the coalescing image of the hideous ""face at the window.""  The introductory text that introduces the motion picture sums the movie up quite well; The Face at the Window is an old-school melodrama ""dear to the hearts of all who unashamedly enjoy either a shudder or a laugh at the heights of villainy.""",1042934400,6,2231,4.680306905370844
