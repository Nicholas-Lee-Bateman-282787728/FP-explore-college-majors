Would not recommend.",1381363200,,244,3.9
8518413,1,B007JMA6YC,The cover made this movie look promising but it was a crappy movie with no plot ans horrible acting! Save your money!,1368230400,,117,4.363636363636363
8518414,1,B007JMA6YC,"Here we go again!  A group of obnoxious twenty-somethings get picked off one by one in an apartment complex that used to be TA DA a hospital where the coroner was a necrophiliac.  Just who or what is killing the whiny youths?  You probably won't care and when you do, it won't make any sense.  Beware---there's copious nudity including some frontal female shots.  You also get three time periods to keep up with so good luck in keeping up with.
RIFT is not worth the effort.",1367712000,,474,4.465116279069767
8518415,1,B007JMA6YC,Horrible and very cheap. Not interesting at all. Stupid plot with dumb actors. One of those cheap horror movies that fill the shelf of your local video store.,1343692800,3,158,4.678571428571429
8518416,5,B007JMA6YC,"When an independent horror thriller film is released, I always have hesitation that the film is a nothing but a smorgasbord of blood and gore or the usual ""scarefest"" that has become the main staple of most horror and paranormal films lately. Fortunately, this film came through as a subliminal surprise. It is intelligently written with a plot that will challenge your wits. The blend of never-heard-of actors and some seasoned cast members worked pretty well although the budgetary constraints is quiet obvious in the overall production. I am wondering why the studios did not do a nationwide theatrical release for this movie. I enjoyed the twist and turns and would gladly recommend it to other film thrill seekers.",1339459200,2,719,5.050420168067227
