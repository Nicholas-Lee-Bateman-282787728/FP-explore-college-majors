8621614,5,B00GAHSSR4,"If you're looking for a way to obtain your favorite Disney/Pixar films on Blu-ray, this box set may make sense for you. These five films (""A Bug's Life,"" ""The Incredibles,"" ""Ratatouille,"" ""Up,"" and ""Wall-E"") are all masterpieces of animation and delightful works of cinema for the entire family. They come with matching DVDs, which I don't need, but some folks may find the extra discs useful, and virtually all Disney/Pixar releases come as Blu-ray/DVD combo packs in any case. As of this writing, the cost of the 10-disc box is slightly less than that of the five movies purchased individually. These aren't the newest three- and four-disc deluxe sets for ""Wall-E,"" ""Up,"" and ""The Incredibles,"" which contain additional bonus material and digital copies, but they will do for all but the hard-core collector.",1401926400,,810,5.097744360902255
