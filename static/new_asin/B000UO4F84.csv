8214083,5,B000UO4F84,"Yes, it is a good movie. I bought it for the actor Stephen Baldwin and because it is a scifi/disaster movie.",1384387200,,108,4.190476190476191
8214084,2,B000UO4F84,OK - I knew when I placed the order that it would not be a great movie but come on people.......this is more of a comedy!  I got some great laughs from the story and the acting both!!!!,1277683200,,185,3.8684210526315788
8214085,1,B000UO4F84,"i tuned into this movie about an hour into the film. stephen baldwin is in a hospital bad. his poorly made-up face looks fat and bloated. i couldn't believe the poor camera angle which exacerbated the size of his neck and lack of chin.

but it was the toy helicopter (with real chopper noises) landing on plastic grass that had me howling out loud. and then the model radio telescope arrays. i suppose if they couldn't afford a real helicopter they really couldn't afford to go on a real location.

this is one of the funniest film snippets i have ever seen. and it isn't even a comedy. make it into black and white, and it would look as if it was made in the 50s. except for baldwin's long hair style. i am not going to make it to the end, unfortunately. gee, i wonder what happens next.",1258156800,2,788,4.281879194630872
