8762112,5,B01G2FHUAO,"I viewed this movie on a movie site and really enjoyed it. While a bit predictable and cliche it also veered off in interesting directions that I did NOT expect. I bought this copy for a Horror Movie buddy of mine and his wife. I thought it was enjoyable enough to give it 5 stars and to buy a copy for someone. May eventually buy a copy for me too. This movie is better than a lot of the horror movies coming out of Hollywood. With horror, really the independent movies are MUCH better in plot and scares. When you do not necessarily have a huge budget for Special Effects, you must rely on other ways to get the scares across. This one DELIVERS!!",1531353600,,648,4.233870967741935

8762115,5,B01G2FHUAO,I liked this movie but it could have a lot more scares in it.,1475712000,,61,3.4285714285714284
8762116,3,B01G2FHUAO,"I would actually go 3.5 on this movie. 4 young counselors will have to set up the camp for the soon to arrive children but something is happening to them. The counselors seem to be going savage. I will say this....if you don't get what is causing it....go back to scifi viewing school. I will say no more. The actors are all relatively harmless and I didn't have any major problems with them. The ending was predictable but still pretty good. I will not tell you the primary twist, don't ask me. I will recommend this movie for anyone with some time to kill. Not bad, really, not bad.",1472688000,2,584,4.36697247706422
8762117,5,B01G2FHUAO,We just watched this for movie night and we actually enjoyed it. Was pretty interesting even tho was easy to guess what would happen sometimes.,1472342400,,143,4.76
8762118,2,B01G2FHUAO,I watched this movie last night and I thought it was going to be a great  movie but it wasn't ... This movie does not have a plot to it and it is confusing to me maybe I need to watch it again I guess lol... I could not figure out if it was the Water or the Pollen what make them act crazy & killers ... Then they go back like normal .. That was stupid to me nonsense ... Once you are infected the damage is done but on this movie it was totally different the movie start going different directions without making sense ... I do not recomended it unless you want to see some stupid acting and cheesy acting I was so disappointed it.... Don't waist your time in this I rather watch CABIN FEVER that movie is not the best out there but at Least make more sense than this one.,1471046400,,773,3.9551282051282053

8762120,2,B01G2FHUAO,"Four American camp counselors get ready for summer in northern Spain. On the eve of the children's arrival they all go into a berserker mode and try to kill each other for awhile, then they come out of it and someone else goes into one. The film is filled with jerky cameras. jump scares and kids running around grunting and screaming...mostly in the dark.

I was bored with the film from beginning to end. The plot went nowhere. The film got interesting at the end and then it was over.
