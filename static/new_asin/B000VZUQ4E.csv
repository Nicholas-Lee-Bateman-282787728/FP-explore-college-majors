The movie was not the movie I wanted because I am still searching for a movie I viewed when channel 5 use to have Saturday Kung Fu theater.  I was about a Mother who knew the Monkey style of Kung Fu who started to teacher her daughter the same style.  I watched This movie,it is not too bad.  Picture not great and voice overs are a thumbs down. Has a love interest for the young woman and she fights with Monkey style.  I received movie quickly too.",1364860800,,454,4.125
