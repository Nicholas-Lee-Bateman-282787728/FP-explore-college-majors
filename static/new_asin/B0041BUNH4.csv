The film was directed by Nikita Mikhalkov, who has a wonderful talent to convey such a love story that sweeps across the beautiful houses of both Russia and Italy in a magnificent film image of travel.

This is a rare film of quality that might have otherwise felt dated by its period drama...but it is a story of love that will never grow out-of-date in changes to its shifting scenery: A love that is unmoveable like a mountain  only changing in nature and season of time  and a love that cannot be separated in an extended landscape of endless thought....

The film is not as stunning as The Barber of Siberia in epic proportion, but is not unlike that film in its allurement of mystique of storytelling -of a lost love that draws itself into the past and present as though time itself were one of an imaginary thought of reality - only age will eventually capture love lost souls in times end?

Macello Mastroianni is a wonderful actor and excels in his light and comical portray of the Italian whose life is easy going, and has the time and wealth to enjoy his leisure in the films haunting theme of love....

Dark Eyes has world class status -with Nikita Mikhalkov as the master, film director, and Marcello Mastroianni as the exceptional actor: a combination that in itself is remarkable! It is a film of my personal choice.",1465516800,,1559,4.546428571428572
8412594,5,B0041BUNH4,"This is a classic film, one which inspired my long lasting fascination with Russia, Russian literature and the language.  Unfortunately, the DVD has English subtitles only for the Italian parts of the film.  Fairly large parts of the film take place in Russian.  I have a personal nostalgia for this bittersweet and somewhat comic love story, but I found the background of Italy and Russia enchanting.",1361059200,2,401,5.045454545454546
