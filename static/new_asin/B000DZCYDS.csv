8102943,5,B000DZCYDS,Fantastic DVDs for educating those that do not know all the moves in chess. Very good. Wish you could play along with this as it teaches.,1347148800,,137,4.3076923076923075
8102944,2,B000DZCYDS,"I bought it thinking I would get lessons on strategy, but it is an elementary primer.  Don't buy this if you want to learn tactics, openings, strategy of anykind.  And, three discs that could have been condensed to one because they were trying to sell you a three disc set to get more money out of you.  It could all have been done on one if they had cut out the lousy (and I mean LOUSY)production elements.",1288569600,6,407,4.259740259740259

Although it starts with the basics of chess it has information that will help those who have played casually for years.  DVD number 3 has the best information that you will want to watch over and over again, especially chess game endings.  This is a must see!",1279670400,6,324,4.4576271186440675
