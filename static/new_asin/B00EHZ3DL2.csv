8605376,5,B00EHZ3DL2,One of my favorite concertos and Lang Lang is a treat to watch. Camera work on his hands top notch.,1503964800,,99,4.0
8605377,4,B00EHZ3DL2,"We enjoyed this disk a lot and the documentary was worth the price of admission (definitely 5 stars).  I just want to clarify what is actually on this disk since it's very hard to know by the information provided - and hard to navigate around the disk.  I hope this helps.

All of the video on this disk has only stereo sound.  This includes: The documentary and a casually dressed, but magnificently played, performance of the Prokofiev Piano concerto.  The rest of the disk includes a stereo 96/24 AUDIO ONLY and a 5.1 surround 48/24 AUDIO ONLY (screen is black) recording of both the Prokofiev and Bartok concertos.  This surprising and odd combination of formats was hard to figure out but in the end everything that showed Lang Lang, Simon Rattle and the orchestra was superb.  I much prefer true high res surround for classical music but if I had known what was really on this disk I may not have bought it . . . and would have missed a lot of fun seeing the documentary and the great music and performances.",1434153600,6,1014,4.508196721311475

8605381,5,B00EHZ3DL2,"wonderful insight into the workings of a recording session. But, the actual complete performance of the Prokofiev piano concerto is absolutely outstanding. Lang Land is such a complete artist.",1393200000,4,192,5.655172413793103
8605382,5,B00EHZ3DL2,"a great watch of prokofiev 3rd. nuances missing but , fun to watch nonetheless.

recommended for all lang lang fans.",1389657600,,116,4.8
8605383,4,B00EHZ3DL2,"Buyers beware - it is not a video for both concerti, just the Prokofiev.
Rattle and Lang Lang and the BPO in recording the Prokofiev III Concerto.  Interesting, but there is a video on this same work taken in September 2012 in Paris with Paavo Jarvi that is even better - Lang Lang and Jarvi are both better there than here, with perhaps exception of the Berlin Phil, which is a great orchestra in all respects.",1389139200,7,411,4.407894736842105
8605384,4,B00EHZ3DL2,"Fun to watch Simon Rattle and Lang Lang working together in the sound booth, preparing the Prokofiev and Bartok for a CD--and then to see Lang Lang posing for camera shots for the cover of the CD. Quality of the video through-out is top-notch: extremely clear and detailed. The music? Heavenly--except for one moment in the Prokofiev that seems just a little TOO dissonant and chaotic. (Maybe it was just me.) One criticism--not of the music but of the BD's format. On the menu you can access a complete performance of the Prokofiev, from start to finish--but the same can't be said of the Bartok. As far as I can tell, the only way to listen to the Bartok--not in a PATCHWORK way but from beginning to end--is to listen to it in audio section, with no accompanying video. [Disappointed groan.] Other than that, great fun! Lang Lang's energy and MASTERY of the two concertos is astonishing. (Only a true artist and master pianist would feel comfortable in confessing to the conductor that, at one point, he played the wrong note!)",1386460800,9,1030,4.696132596685083
