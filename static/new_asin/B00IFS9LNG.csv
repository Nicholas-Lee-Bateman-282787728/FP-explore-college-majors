8641894,5,B00IFS9LNG,Just love the fact that I have this concert for my collection!  Not the best quality.  Could have been more to the concert but like I said just glad to have it!,1461456000,,160,3.96875
8641895,3,B00IFS9LNG,"Good news: here's your chance to see rare 1985 era Culture Club performing songs like God Thank You Woman and Gusto Blusto live in concert!

Bad news: this is basically an old vhs recording burned to dvd.  Picture quality is mediocre at best.",1428105600,2,242,4.604651162790698
