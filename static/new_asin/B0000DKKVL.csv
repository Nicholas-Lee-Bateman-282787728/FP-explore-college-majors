1927242,3,B0000DKKVL,"I would love to own this DVD, (Within Temptation-Mother Earth Live) but my DVD Player will only play a disc recorded with the NTCS format. So what's my problem with AMAZON? If you look at the product description, it clearly states that this DVD was recorded with the NTCS format. ""NOT SO"" It was recorded with the PAL format. I ordered this DVD twice, one new and one used, both were recorded with the PAL format. Ended up wasting time going to and from the post office.",1244419200,11,470,4.413793103448276
1927243,5,B0000DKKVL,"This is an amazing music DVD for any collection.  When you purchase one of Within Temptation Live DVDs, you not only get disc but the heart and soul of the band.  They put hours of footage and spectacular performances on all their dvds.  It's almost like they want you to get every penny worth and don't disappoint.  You'll get behind the scences footage, music videos, live concerts, and hours of W.T. loaded on the disc.  This band plans dvds after all their major concerts of every album so far and they spend months preparing the dvds.  Trust me, they don't disappoint.",1216512000,5,573,4.623762376237623

8001388,5,B0000DKKVL,"This item came way ahead of the expected delivery date.  I had to play it on my Oppo BD player because it is PAL encoded.

The Oppo is a very good player and it excels at up-scaling anything to 1080p.

That being said let me say that the picture and sound quality of this concert DVD were excellent.  If you have read any of my other Within Temptation reviews you would see that I heard Sharon den Adel's voice more clearly on the stereo/direct sound setting.  Not so this concert video.  The mix was perfect (compared to other music BDs and DVDs) on any sound setting.  Her magnificent voice and the band's exceptional instrumental abilities were well showcased.

  The entire group showed so much more energy and stage presence than in any of my music videos (With the possible exception of Nightwish in the Showtime Storytime disc).
I realize that this was their first recording in....i think 1996 or 7...I'm still catching up...But if you are in to this type of music you should try to get an original copy (black market versions are usually not worth seeing or hearing) of this Mother Earth Live DVD.

IMPORTANT UPDATE:  I mention my Oppo BD player here and other places in relation to playing PAL encoded discs.  You should be made aware that the player has been made to include provisions for playing PAL. It does not come that way from the factory.",1399161600,,1356,4.576763485477178
8001389,5,B0000DKKVL,"Had to order my copy from ebay cause dealers here on Amazon are just asking rediculous prices for this. Granted it's the very first ever DVD of WT but over $50? This is a nice piece to add to your WT collection. Concert is in widescreen with 2.0/5.1/DTS surround options. This is only in PAL format so make sure you have a multi player. It's 3 concerts on the first disc where you have the option to play in continous play or play each concert seperatly. Also on the first disc are 3 videos (The Dance, Mother Earth, Ice Queen). The second disc are behind the scenes, interviews, pics, and documentaries. I haven't gotten to the second disc yet, but it's a bunch of goodies. This DVD is awesome to own as they perform the older songs from there first 2 albums that they don't perform on The Silent Force Tour DVD and Black Symphony DVD.",1388966400,,836,4.365384615384615
8001390,5,B0000DKKVL,I own this DVD thanks to my son who had imported to me as a gift in 2007. I have seen them in concert twice. The first time they came to USA was in 2007 very near to my home in Ky. The 2nd Time we saw them we drove over 700 miles to see them in NYC in Sept 2011. It was the best ever!!!! Sharon and Robert were seen on the streets of Manhattan just hours away from the concert time and my son was lucky enough to get his pic taken with them.,1361404800,,441,3.6041666666666665
8001391,5,B0000DKKVL,"Just got home from seeing this band live at the Palladium in Worchester, MA. Absolutely amazing, they just get better with age.",1315526400,,127,4.818181818181818
8001392,4,B0000DKKVL,"I became a WITHIN TEMPTATION fan a couple of years a go after I saw the DVD of the
""Black Symphony"" Concert.  I would truly love to see them in concert, but that will probably
not happen. They are doing a mini USA 4 city tour in Sept, but it's not even close to where I live.
So through the miracle of DVD I can put them on and crank it up, whenever I am in the mood.
This show is very good but it's not as great as Black Symphony. They have matured a lot in their songs and performance, BUT it is great, as a perspective of the bands past.",1305331200,3,540,3.8214285714285716
8001393,5,B0000DKKVL,"Within Temptation is a female fronted ""Gothic Metal"" band in the shadow of a band like ""Night Wish"".An American band I can relate them to is ""Evanescence""...Their dvd concerts are breath taking. Stunning,visual,and the performance is always top notch. Great array of guest singers,and wether they play with an orchestra or as a band alone...nothing tops their sound. Buy this dvd,well worth the money !!!",1274054400,,404,5.230769230769231
8001394,5,B0000DKKVL,"i confess, i have downloaded this DVD from the internet, but, it deserves to buy it!!!!,",1269648000,,88,4.5625
