I love history,but this documentaries are indeed a boring!",1321488000,3,219,5.285714285714286
8168982,5,B000MGBTKC,"Very nice trio. The crusades one was a bit rougher in production and should have gone into the 4th crusade in depth and mentioned the last 5 with more than  a footnote on the fall of Acre in 1291 but still nice history of the first 3 crusades, the Agincourt and the War of the Roses were very informative. I would have liked to see more on the Battle of Bosworth mostly to wash the Shakespeare version out as a historical work! Nice series, glad I bought it. Would reccomend for school studies.",1312675200,4,494,4.311827956989247
