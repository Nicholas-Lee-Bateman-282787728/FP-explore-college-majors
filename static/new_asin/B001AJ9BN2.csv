8606242,2,B001AJ9BN2,"Well since there's only two reviews, you need to watch it! Hard to speak of the acting since there was a little budget. I'm sure it was fun to make. Julie Lynch had a sexual crush on Christine, this was clear.",1383436800,,209,4.121951219512195
8606243,5,B001AJ9BN2,but an amazing independent film in the tradition of the great New York Movies. Christine Harnos is giving a heart wrenching and daring performance.,1355443200,,147,5.166666666666667
8606244,5,B001AJ9BN2,Director Julie Lynch takes us back to when we all started to worry about HIV Aids in our free wheeling lives. Her shots of the city brought real world credibility to the picture. The main characters all did a tremendous job in portraying the personalities and characteristics that many of us had lived during that time. Thouroughly enjoyed the film!
