8181364,5,B000NTLYI0,"""Unwary"" is a delirious and engaging tour de force movie, about the art of cheat (In Thomas de Quincey's memory).

A solid script supported by a formidable cast -Federico Luppi and Victoria Abril are superb in their respective roles- in which the double crosses and betray are part of their way of living; a necessary device for surviving.
