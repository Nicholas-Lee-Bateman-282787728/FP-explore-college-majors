8707840,3,B00UPJZKME,"This movie has a lot of rapid fast excited back and forth talking between lots of characters which results in the English subtitles sentences only being up for a second or so most of the time as they are replaced by the next line, meaning you're constantly speed reading while watching.  Subtitles as well are in white thin font and very difficult to see against backgrounds such as characters wearing white at times. I'd watch at least 100 foreign language spoken with English subtitles films each year and this film was faster and more difficult reading than I've ever experienced before in a movie. The elderly woman wasn't a very likable character and showed no respect for her adult daughter or others.  Didn't like her and with the fast dialogue I didn't stick with this one up to the point she becomes twenty again.",1493164800,,822,4.701388888888889
