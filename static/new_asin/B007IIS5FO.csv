8517562,3,B007IIS5FO,"On the 5th & 6th days of Christmas 2015 Im going to reivew... TNA Against All Odds 2012 & TNA Victory Road 2012. first off: TNA-AAO 2012. A suprisingly decent PPV from TNA.  Two matches that were very worth watching in the X-Division Title match and Kazarian/AJ Styles.  Sadly, there isn't a whole lot more here.  The main event was ok but spoilt by shenanigans.  The Gunner/Garrett match and the Television Title match didn't belong on PPV or even television for that matter. The rest was pretty passable, certainly nothing offensive but nothing too exciting either. Next; TNA-VR 2012. The PPV proved to be one of the best events TNA has put on in a long time. The opening handful of contests were pretty poor but the back half of the card more than made up for that. It was also refreshing to see some clean finishes for a change. TNA had been overdosing on the goofy endings so hopefully this marks a permanent shift toward clean endings at PPVs. I give both PPVs a 6 out of 10.",1450483200,,981,4.4636871508379885

8517564,3,B007IIS5FO,"Against All Odds 2012 - The first ppv is honestly not the best. Nothing bad, it's just there. It feels like a filler ppv where there really isn't any match that stands out. If I had to pick one match the X-Division title match was the best and the main event was a good attempt of making a good match, but the show overall was just basic.

Victory Road 2012 - Now this one is much better than Against All Odds. The matches were much better, explosive start and a dramatic end. There's a lot of twitter references in this show, but doesn't go in the realm of annoyance. The matches were much better, Angle/Hardy, the Styles/Anderson vs. Bad Influence match is good, and the main event was pretty decent. Once again the X-Division title match in my opinion stole the show.

Overall it's a decent DVD pack, maybe get it for cheap, but there are a few good matches in this set.",1405641600,,873,4.3496932515337425

8517566,3,B007IIS5FO,"This Twin Pack covers contains the PPV's of Against All Odds & Victory Road that leads into one of the biggest shows of the year in LockDown.  It was during this time that Sting was the General Manager of TNA but kept having his issues with Bobby Roode who kept disrespecting his authority causing Sting to get more involved in the action while A.J. Styles had lost all of his allies as Christopher Daniels had a personal secret against him that would eventually cause Kazarian to leave his side.

Against All Odds '12:
It should be noted here that due to a death in Taz's family, Jeremy Borash did the commentary with Mike Tenay for this event.

Jesse Sorensen vs. Zema Ion - This was to determine who got the next X Division Championship match at Destination X as Jesse gave away his football at the beginning of the match only for Zema to try & upstage Jesse but nobody wanted his hairspray.  They started out trading momentum with Zema getting frustrated & stealing the football from the fan at ringside.  Unfortunately the match didn't go long as Zema executed a springboard moonsault from the top rope with his knees hitting Jesse right in the head that knocked him out resulting in Zema winning by count out & as we've seen since this time, Jesse suffered a serious neck injury here.  The match itself was going well but the injury happened before it started to go anywhere.

Television Champion Robbie E vs. Shannon Moore - Robbie E issued an open challenge & was responded to by Shannon Moore who we've rarely seen since the breakup of Ink Inc.  Moore was in control causing E to try to leave before Moore brought him back & stay in control before he was knocked off the apron into the guardrail to get control.  They traded momentum throughout the match with Robbie T getting involved in what was a solid match that was made better by the crowd really getting behind Moore here.

Knockouts Champion Gail Kim vs. Tara - From the moment Gail entered with Madison, we clearly saw there were issues between the two partners that kept distracting Gail during the match to the point where Madison walked away from ringside after an argument.  Gail then focused on Tara's leg with various submissions like the octopus which did effect Tara as she he made her comeback but hurt her knee doing a top rope moonsault.  This was an average match with the match they had on Impact weeks earlier being much better in quality as this was just a backdrop to the issues between Gail & Madison.

Tag Team Champions Matt Morgan & Crimson vs. Samoa Joe & Magnus - The challengers showcased their strategy here by singling out Crimson & working him over by staying fresh with quick tags & keeping him on their side of the ring building the hot tag to Morgan but the biggest story of the match here was revealed with the miscommunication between Morgan & Crimson resulted in new champions.  Good match that had all men work hard & meshed better together than they did the previous match.

X Division Champion Austin Aries vs. Alex Shelley - Aries tried to showboat early with Shelley responding with chops & kicks gaining control with moves like the springboard top rope dive onto the outside & a clothesline that turned Aries inside out.  Aries had to resort to surprise tactics like crawling under the ring to get the advantage back focusing on Shelley's previously injured neck with moves such as the top rope elbow drop right on Shelley's back, the death valley driver on the apron, and various brainbusters.  This was one of the hardest fought X division matches in a while.

A.J. Styles vs. Kazarian - Daniels was in Kaz's corner & even forced him to his t-shirt which Styles eventually ripped off his back.  Styles was in control & worked over Kaz's back with kicks, a backbreaker, and various submissions but kept his eye on Daniels.  Kaz was able to regain some momentum by grounding Styles & even tried his own submission working over Styles' own back before A.J. came back with a fireman's carry into a backbreaker on the knee but ended up hurting his own knee in the process.  Kaz retailed with an explosive dropkick that knocked Styles across the ring while later driving Styles head into the apron & kicked A.J. on the top rope that knocked Styles out for a little bit.  Styles turned his focus to Daniels which opened the door for Kazarian to capitalise.  This was a good match & told a good story but it didn't touch the matches they've had in their previous X division days.

Garett Bischoff vs. Gunner - Hulk Hogan & Eric Bischoff were in the opposite corners here & the main story here was that Gunner was just punishing Garett non-stop by punishing his neck with various neckbreakers & DDT's but Garett refused to quit despite Hogan wanting to throw in the towel at one point.  You got the point across storyline wise as far as establishing Garett as a tough kid who won't quit but this was easily the weakest match on the card as Garett is in the ""David Flair/Eric Watts"" role where he's push too hard & too fast not because of his talent but strictly because of who his father is as he had no business being in this spot & in this long of a match on the card.

TNA Champion Bobby Roode vs. James Storm vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Bully Ray - All three of these men have been screwed out of title matches in some way, shape, or forum by Roode resulting in this match with Sting making himself the special enforcer to make sure that we had a clear winner here.  Roode knew he was the odd man out here so he tried to make deals with everyone with Ray answering by exiting the ring allowing Roode to get beat down by Storm & Hardy before each man showed it was ""every man for himself"" by trying to roll up the other for a quick pin.  We had various moments involving all four men here such as a Beer Money reunion, Bully Ray getting a ""Devon's better"" chant from the fans, and the Tower Of Doom.  The big moment came here when Sting had to interject himself into the match as a referee leading to where Roode once again ""spat in the face of authority"" forcing Sting to react which ended up forcing Sting to do the one thing he didn't want to do.  The work here was good but the bigger story here was the continued issues between Sting & Roode.

Victory Road ;12:
It should be noted that this PPV was the beginning of TNA's heavy push into social media via Facebook & Twitter as the commentators would read tweets throughout the commentary all night & had Twitter questions asked during the backstage interviews.

James Storm vs. Bully Ray - Ray took to Facebook hours earlier & threatened to take the show hostage until his scheduled match was made into a #1 contenders match for the TNA Title which Storm agreed to.  This was pretty short & sweet as Ray was dominate before Storm hit his superkick to knock Bully out for the win.  The match did it's job in putting over Storm's superkick as a dominate move that can hit anywhere at anytime but if you want a more quality match, check out the one they did on Impact after the previous Against All Odds PPV.

X Division Champion Austin Aries vs. Zema Ion - Aries walked into this match against someone who had just as big an ego as himself as we saw in the early moments with both men exchanged slaps while Aries also had fun with Zema's hairspray & even tweeting during the match (yes, you read that right) while Zema did the moonsault that injured Jesse Sorenson the previous month & even tried mocking Aries elbow drop to no avail causing him to try to use the spray to blind Aries like he did in their previous match.  This was a good performance from both men.

Tag Team Champions Samoa Joe & Magnus vs. Crimson & Matt Morgan - There had been issues for weeks with Crimson blaming Morgan for losing the titles the previous month & that clearly played out here.  Crimson wrestled the match alone & refused to tag Morgan to the point where Morgan was begging to come into the match & the crowd chanted ""Tag Your Partner!""  It eventually caught up to him as Joe & Magnus continued to beat Crimson down before Morgan finally tagged himself in leading to the complete breakdown between both men leading to Crimson walking out before costing his team the match.  This was all about the breakup of the team of Morgan & Crimson more than anything else.

Television Champion Robbie E vs. Devon - Robbie issued another open challenge which was eventually answered (after 5 minutes of talking) by Devon in his street clothes.  Devon dominated here causing Robbie T caused a distraction to get an advantage to the point where even Brooke Hogan was in the audience but stopped Robbie E from attempting to use a chair before Devon rebounded to win the title.  Outside of the title change, this wasn't anything special.

Knockouts Champion Gail Kim vs. Madison Rayne - The former Knockouts Tag Team Champions went at it here & tried to show that they were still close friends to each other as they hugged & acted friendly before the match but even Gail teased hitting her with the title belt.  There really isn't much to say here as the match was pretty dull as they just never left first gear & Gail was off this night as shown when she did a crash & burn off the apron onto the guardrail & later doing a top rope dropkick that ended up hurting both of them as Gail hit the back of her head on the way down.  I was more entertained by Taz having trouble reading the tweets during the match than the action itself.

A.J. Styles & Mr. Anderson vs. Christopher Daniels & Kazarian - A member of each team came into this match already banged up as Daniels had a bandage under his eye from having stitches due to his match with Mr. Anderson on the previous Impact while Anderson had a black eye thanks to Daniels from a match they had at a live event.  Daniels was avoiding Anderson during the early moments before a brawl broke out between all four men on the floor & settled back down in the ring where Styles showed his strength by doing the classic British Bulldog delayed suplex.  Eventually Daniels & Kazarian were able to get the advantage & work over Styles with Daniels still ordering Kaz around building to the hot tag to Anderson.  This was a good tag match between all four & even had a unique ending with the countering back & forth between the Styles Clash & Fade To Black.

Jeff Hardy vs. Kurt Angle - Angle grounded Hardy with amateur wrestling only for Hardy to keep countering Angle's moves with his own reversals early on before Hardy went for the Poetry In Motion on the flor only for Angle to move & Hardy crashed into the guardrail on his tailbone.  They traded momentum & picked up the pace over time before taking the match to the outside with Angle being opened up thanks to the steel steps & both men kicking out of each others signature moves including Angle taking the Swanton Bomb with Hardy's weight completely crashing on top of Angle.  The ending was a little cheap but opened up the door for a rematch as this was a good quality match between the two but didn't top their back to back series of matches they had back in 2010.

No Holds Barred Match: Sting vs. Bobby Roode - This was a non-title match as Sting was the General Manager of Impact at the time & Roode was already scheduled to face James Storm at LockDown for the title while it should also be noted that Dixie Carter was at ringside for this match.  Sting kept sending Roode to the floor causing Roode to try to walk away only for Sting to keep fighting him & banging his head on both sets of steps.  Roode resorted to dirty tactics to gain control & worked over Sting's leg using whatever he could including the post & a figure four but Sting would return the favor by working over Roode's legs as well but it was a case of not being aware of his environment when attempting the Scorpion Deathdrop that would come back to haunt Sting.  This was a real good match with the aftermath being one of the most evil acts in recent memory of the company to where I had flashbacks of Jake Roberts slapping Elizabeth back in 1991.

Against All Odds was was one of those PPV's that had good matches overall but was more about continuing the storylines already in place (Sting/Roode, Garett/Hogan/Bischoff, Styles/Kaz/Daniels, Gail/Madison) with none of them really getting solved here.  Victory Road had the entire undercard (except for the X Division Title) pushing storylines/characters more than actually having a quality match as it was the X Division match along with the final three matches that were worth taking a second look at here but the heavy overkill of plugging their social media didn't help any.  Both events were those ""in the middle"" shows where it has some nice action but you aren't really missing anything if you skip it.",1352160000,,12760,4.484024179620034
