8332184,1,B001P68WHG,"I must say I was excited when I got this DVD, but after watching it I found myself trying to stay awake during most of it. It you're an art lover or history lover, this video is for you as it goes into great depth going over the history of Hungary and of detailing the country's art. I thought I bought a tourism DVD, not a history DVD. If you're looking for a video to show you what to see and what to do while in Budapest, this video had very little to offer. I was disappointed quite honestly and would not recommend it to anyone (unless history and art is what you're looking for).",1327449600,,585,4.095652173913043
8332185,3,B001P68WHG,"It was a little difficult to understand the speaker's English.  Also, I would have liked a map that pinpointed each site that he described.  The film would probably be better for someone who had been there at least once.  Visually, it made Budapest very appealing, though I could have done without all the camera lingerings on lovers smooching.  You wouldn't want your young kids with you.  Those wrapped around images are considered poor taste here (Maryland).",1325808000,,461,5.0131578947368425
