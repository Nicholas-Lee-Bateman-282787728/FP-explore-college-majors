8356854,5,B0028RXZEG,"What a sweet story!  Anyone who remembers the ""sock hops"" of their high school years, and especially remembers what it was like to stand on the sidelines and being too bashful to accept invitations to join in, will find a soft spot for Joy Chan (Donna Lai Ming Lew).  She's the pretty and talented Chinese-American teenager who has dreams of Broadway stardom.  She is befriended by another ""odd bird"", Brother T. S. Murphy (Michael Moriarty), a math teacher at a boys' school who is a chaperone at the dance where he spots Joy.  Brother Murphy encourages shy Joy to pursue her dreams of becoming a performer by actually auditioning the for some roles.  She does!  What a sweet short-term friendship develops between this teacher and student.  Then school's out for the summer.
Donna Lew is excellent in her debut role.  Michael Moriarty, always excellent in the ""warm-fuzzy"" roles throughout his career, is so believable in ""Odd Birds"" as a big brother anyone would want to have around.  Viewing this movie will definitely contribute to a cozy, popcorn type evening.  It will also bring a pleasant smile to your face and warm spot in your heart!  We'll look at this one again.",1022630400,,1176,4.800995024875622
8356855,4,B0028RXZEG,"This is a ""coming of age"" story about a girl, Joy Chan (Donna Lew), who dreams of the glamor of what could be if she were a well loved Broadway stage performer. It's also a story about the loneliness of being an adult mired in a life lacking belief and purpose. Brother T.S. Murphy (Michael Moriarty), a high school teacher and Irish Christian Brother finds himself surrounded by Joy's adoration, hope and unspoken love. He wants to break through his vows and his personal barrier to touch Joy, but is not able to.
ODD BIRDS is also a study of racial stereotyping of Asian-Americans in the 1960's. They can dream about becoming another Vivien Leigh or Elizabeth Taylor, but must settle on school part try-outs being relegated to the role of the maid.
Joy Chan, the dreamy adolescent who tries to go beyond her mother's counsel to be practical and become a nurse, tries out for the ""Barretts of Wimpole Street"" school play at nearby Brother Rice (Catholic) High School. There, she meets and befriends an equally distant ""odd bird,"" Brother T.S. Murphy, who has fallen into the role of the Religious Order's counselor without having the requisite faith.
The tension of not being considered for the role of ""Elizabeth"" added to her dispair at falling in love with T.S. propels Joy to try out for a Broadway audition that Gower Champion is holding in nearby San Francisco across the Bay. T.S. Murphy can only encourage Joy and retreat to another ""assignment"" in Chicago, far from the tender warmth of the adolescent who adores him.
The smitten Joy cannot dance, but does sing in her audition for Champion, the famed choreographer of ""Hello Dolly,"" ""42nd Street"" and other Broadway hits. Joy accepts his heart-felt accolade for her vocal talent. This is as good as it gets for someone for whom it's not good at all. It's a poignant ending as Joy returns, alone, from her audition, with Gower Champion's ""bravo's"" still ringing in her ears. She'll never be cast, she'll never see her friend T.S. again, but like a few lucky souls, she's had her magic moment.",991267200,2,2052,4.750700280112045
