8094554,5,B000BYW70G,"This is a great movie, even athough the subtitling and DVD transfer is low-par.

Not to make the story redundant, it is about a Israeli kibbutz in the early-1950s that is full of (mostly) East European orphaned children who were sent away by their parents at the begining of the Hitler years (even afterwards) and brought to Israel to escape the anti-Semitism and violence of Europe.  -- Think: Kindertransport, which was the UK. --  Here, the trauma of not having parents, or being brought up in the forest, or being ""adopted"" by those parents who lost their children, or having parents who believe they are first-hand victims runs the movie.  It is fantastic, and very different to the Holocaust movies that deal directly with death camps, concentration camps, Europe, or Nazis/anti-Semites.  It's about children coming of age and coming to terms with trauma, memory, and the inability to change the past.

For a film made in the mid-1990s, the actors in this movie are EXTREMELY BELIEVABLE!  The acting is so good, that one would believe that the film was made in the early 1950s!  The gradual unravelling of each of the main characters' lives was just so well written that I was engrossed the entire length of the movie.  Not only do you have a type of teenage love/jealousy story(s), but to intermesh that narrative(s) with the story of post-Holocaust memory is near-genius!

The movie would be a great double feature with a little-known movie from Poland called ""Our Children"" (1948), which deals with children (some younger) at a Lodz (Poland)-area orphanage.  I would also include Film Movement's ""Mother of Mine"" (2005), about a Finnish boy (not Jewish) sent to Sweden during the war.

Now the 2 downsides to the DVD:  1) The subtitles.  Boy, are they really bad.  The grammar is terrible, and the spelling is often wrong.  Although they are the black-outlined letters (so not to meld with light backgrounds), lines are often incomprehensible; 2) The visual quality of the transfer is not that great.  SISU Home Entertainment is the distributor, but the film is so good, it needs some company like Film Movement or First Run Features to do it justice.  The movie just looks a bit out of focus.

There aren't any really mentionable ""Extras"" on the DVD (I would love to hear a director's commentary, or even some from the actors and actresses, because it is a great movie).

5 of 5 Amazon stars, even with the problems.",1378512000,,2426,4.828087167070218
8094555,5,B000BYW70G,The film has universal themes and for that it needs to be viewed by all audiences. I am a teacher and will incorporate this film into my program.,1364515200,,145,4.214285714285714
8094556,4,B000BYW70G,"""Under the Domim Tree"" is the sequel to ""The Summer of Aviya"", both of which are based on the early life of Gila Almagor. This is one of the few occasions in which I actually liked the sequel better than the first.

The performances by the teenage actors and actresses are excellent, and the film shows a realistic picture of their lives post-Holocaust.

I have only one major complaint about this movie, and it is that the background of Aviya's mother, Henya (who is portrayed by Almagor herself), is changed. In ""The Summer of Aviya"", it is stated that her husband - Aviya's father - died in the woods of Poland in 1941 and that she was imprisoned in the concentration camps (she is shown to have a string of numbers tattooed on her wrist). In ""Under the Domim Tree"", Henya came to Israel before the war and was never in the camps. All of her relatives were killed, though, and she insists that she was ""there"", which Aviya says is ""all in her head"". Aviya's father died in 1939, and she is able to visit his grave in Israel.

The second version is more similar to Gila Almagor's background, but I wish the producers of this film had been consistent and had not changed the details so drastically.

Highly recommended film.",1354924800,,1225,4.504504504504505
8094557,5,B000BYW70G,"Amazing story of how a bunch of young teenagers cope with loss of parents, moving to a new country and growth pains.

Beautifully explores the emotional side of living in a world full of conflict, with beauty and horror close to each other in the form of holocaust memories and the new beginning in the land of Israel.

Greatly recommended product! Some of these DVDs seem to have minor defects, meaning you should probably rip the DVD in order to ensure being able to view it in the future.",1328659200,,491,4.50561797752809
8094558,5,B000BYW70G,"It's only as I've gotten older that I really understand the horror of the Holocaust and the kind of evil that precluded it.  To imagine a hopeful movie about anything to do with the Holocaust is virtually impossible but that's what ""Under the Domin Tree"" is, perhaps because it's about rebuilding in the aftermath.  Never insulting to anyone's intelligence, this movie tells the story of young adults who, having escaped Nazi terror as children, must come to terms with its after effects and start anew in the fledgling nation of Israel. This movie is so very beautiful, and it will especially resonate with anyone who has had everything taken from them and finds themselves navigating themselves towards love, because that's really the only choice there is.",1230249600,3,758,5.007936507936508
8094559,4,B000BYW70G,"Under the Domim Tree is the second film of a two-film series based on Gila Almagor's stories about her upbringing in post-Holocaust Israel.  (Either film may be viewed independently, though.)  Almagor is one Israel's most noted and well regarded actresses, and her books reveal a childhood that surprised many Israelis.

Aviya is sent to live in a youth village (kfar no'ar) because of her mother's emotional instability following her migration to Israel as a Displaced Person.  Her mother--remarkably played by Almagor herself--features minorly in the film, although her influence plays a major role in Aviya's development into a teenage girl facing love, loss, and self-consciousness.

Aviya--the character based on Almagor--is sent to live in a youth village (kfar no'ar) because of her mother's emotional instability following her migration to Israel as a Displaced Person.  Her mother--remarkably played by Almagor herself--features minorly in the film, although her influence plays a major role in Aviya's development into a teenage girl facing love, loss, and self-consciousness.

Other characters include child Holocaust survivors still imprisoned by their memories and village staff--some who provide the nuturing their charges need, and some who don't.

Under the Domim Tree is a poignant film, portraying Aviya struggles in reconciling the horror of her mother's Holocaust experiences with the ramifications of her own maturation into adulthood.

The film is suitable for many age groups, namely high school on up.",1144108800,3,1525,5.595652173913043
8094560,4,B000BYW70G,"This is the next chapter in Gila Almagor's coming-of-age autobiography, begun in her film, THE SUMMER OF AVIYA.  UNDER THE DOMIM TREE (or crab apple tree) continues the story five years later, in the mid-1950s, in  Israel. Aviya, now 15, lives in a youth village for war orphans and  teenagers from troubled homes, where she and her new friends stand in as  family for one another. Aviya searches for clues to the identity of her  deceased father, endures the unpredictability of her emotionally unstable  mother, Henya (played by Gila Almagor herself) and is pursued by  Polish-born fellow teenager, Jurek, who desperately tries to win her heart.  By day Aviya and her friends laugh, play and study like other teens; by  night memories of their unspeakable losses return. They find refuge  together under the domim (crabapple) tree, where the story finds its  surprising and exhilarating climax. Filmed in a Zionism-realism style.",955152000,11,931,5.14
