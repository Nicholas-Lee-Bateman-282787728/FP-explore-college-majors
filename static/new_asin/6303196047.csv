8168320,5,6303196047,"Nina Ananiashvili is one of today's top ballerinas , performing regularly with both the Bolshoi Ballet and American Ballet Theatre.  She appears in  this performance with one of her usual partners, Aleksai Fadeechev of the  Bolshoi.  The other international stars are: Darci Kistler (New York City Ballet), Tatiana Terekhova, Andris  Liepa (Kirov Ballet); Rose Gad (Royal Danish Ballet); Irina Dorofeeva and  Vadim Pisarev (Dusseldorf Ballet); Elisabeth Patel and Nicolas Le Riche  (Paris Opera Ballet).
The opening piece is the classic ""Pas de  Quatre,"" danced, as in the original, by ballerinas of different  nationalities and styles.  With one exception, the rest of the program  consists of 19th century pas de deux (Raymonda, Satanella, Grand Pas  Classique).
This Japanese production was taped in Tokyo.  There are no  sets, and the camera work is the best type for viewing classical ballets.  There are very few camera angle changes, and the dancers are consistently  shown full view.  In other words, there's nothing to distract you from  concentrating on the dancing.
