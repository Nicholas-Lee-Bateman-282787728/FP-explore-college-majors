4687278,5,B005G4FFDW,"I've been ""doing Jane"" since the first routine came out on vinyl. I have all 4 of the latest DVD's since she came out with them in her Prime time. Way to go again,Jane.
I've always kind of felt like Jane was my functional big sister. So encouraging and positive. I'm 60 and now feel that I'm older than Jane. My goal is to become her little sister again. I look forward to my exercises with these DVD's.",1324080000,102,403,4.17948717948718
4687279,5,B005G4FFDW,"I am 51 yrs old, have developed arthritis, weak muscles, and can't walk up the stairs to my apartment (16 steps) with out being out breath. I have had enough with my laziness!

I purchased this video on Amazon Prime Video with my Roku box. I tried both, the upper and lower workout in one session and was amazed how in poor shape I have really become. I will be working out with Jane three evenings a week using this video. She has a sense of humor and is inspiring for any senior or pre-senior (like me) that wants to start exercising. It seems like you are actually there with her working out. It is 45 minutes of moves that your body and muscles  actually feel, without the expense of having to pay monthly gym fees, or using your precious gas and time to get to a gym. After you finish you can do want you need to do in the comfort of your home!

You will need:

1. pair of small dumbbells - (a weight that you can use for 45 min) I have them at 5 lbs each and will work up to 9 lbs over the next few weeks
2. small chair (that is stable)
3. yoga mat
4. simple hand towel (thin and long) for stretching

They are not very difficult but they are a good workout.  I'm 59, was extremely active until injuries and am trying to get back to it, these are perfect.

You'll need 2 -3 lb weights or 1-6# since she held both 3 lbs in one hand for an exercise, a mat, towel. At the end of the 2-20 min workouts there is a 10 minute relaxation session..Do it!

4687315,5,B005G4FFDW,"I bought my copy at a yard sale and came here for a copy for a friend, and to purchase other Jane Fonda videos. I am only 47, but I have Fibromyalgia, and arthritis everywhere. I have been limited to lifting 5 pounds after my bad neck went worse, but am now up to 20. These workouts seem very slow and easy while doing them. I sure have been able to tell a difference afterwards, though. JF's slow but steady pace has been fibro- friendly. Her reminders regarding proper technique and posture, and demonstrating the exercises before asking you to perform them are helpful for someone who needs to consider the safety of the moves prior to doing them. This has been a great video for a stressed body, and one I will feel good about giving my friend. I also feel good about leaving a review for this product that others with Fibro might read.",1463529600,2,840,4.391025641025641

Using this video, I now have muscles in my arms and have reduced the hanging sagging skin.  By summer, I will be showing off toned arms in sleeveless tops!  The leg workout is good for both toning and strength.  What's great about this video is that Jane really emphasizes correct posture for each exercise and there are continual reminders to hold your abs in and breathe.

4687407,5,B005G4FFDW,I am a 71 years old women who has walked and exercised a lot for the last 40 plus years. I actually walked a lot listening to Jane Fondas' walking tapes. I have developed arthritis in my knees the last 2 years and it has left me unsure of how to continue on my exercise needs. Classes seemed to be very repetitious and I kept up but in hind sight should have skipped some of the reps involving the knees. I believe Jane Fonda has been a positive addition to woman's health for many years so I purchased this tape along with another by someone else. This is a great bridge to healing my sore knees while continuing to keep working on balance and strength.,1424217600,9,654,4.24
4687408,5,B005G4FFDW,"These routines are great for the middle aged & up person or younger who is out of shape. Or if you have joint issues. She sets them up nicely. In fact, there were some new moves I didn't know about. I have Gilad DVDs but read where one needs different DVDs because of boredom and working the muscles the same way all the time. These fill that need perfectly; however, they are low impact. One needs low impact on occasion in my opinion. Thanks Jane",1424217600,,448,4.2823529411764705

4687425,5,B005G4FFDW,"There are two workouts.  One for upper body and one for lower body. They each take about 20 minutes.  You can do one at a time or both together.  After injuring my back I was unable to do my usual Jillian Michaels and Jackie Warner workouts so got these Fonda Prime Time videos.  These will keep me from atrophying until I have recovered from my injury and can go back to more challenging exercises.

Jane Fonda is a wonderful instructor.  Thorough, patient and genuinely warm.  You feel like she cares.  She addresses many issues for older people from arthritis and range of motion to balance.  Younger people in fairly good shape will find these too easy.  But if you're older, overweight, not used to exercise or injured these workouts are good to do.",1421539200,4,754,4.601503759398496

Even though I am not too much out of shape, this workout is great for beginners and us older ones to start back exercising. Even after one day I wasn't sore which is a plus. You can add weights if you want or without, depending on what your body tells you to do. Highly recommended for people starting back to exercise and us seasoned folk.
One other thing, I am bone on bone in my right knee and have no problem doing this DVD so if you have joint problems, this should be OK to use.",1421280000,7,608,4.075

4687447,5,B005G4FFDW,"This is an AWESOME stretching (key word - she has other videos more for cardio) - video for women or men approaching middle age and are either in good shape as they are (but not going to gym) or people who are not active - it has an UPPER body (20 min) and LOWER body (20 min) - I do them together but when time is short I can do one and still feel good. This TT&F routine is unique in that it gently lubricates and strengthens your muscles & joints - essential in the fight against arthritis and joint & tendon problems that start already at this age.

Jane is really down to earth talking you thru each one and explaining what benefit it is - plus she has chosen 3 other women to join - all 3 NORMAL and not the usual sexy over fit ones in videos.  It is sometimes hard to accept that Jane is over 70 - she was about 72ish when she did this video and her energy and strength is stunning ! She also shares with you her challenges with certain moves & recommends what you can do to help these besides the stretching moves.

I am a GYM HATER - I tried once and it was so demeaning and stinky that I wasted my $600 membership (as they would not give my money back) I am quite active with a moving around profession (luckily not sitting at a desk) - I have been doing the TT&F for over 4 months now - trying to stick to 3-4x a week and after only a few weeks I felt the best I have felt in ages - like how I did in my 30's (I am nearing 50) so flexible and ACHES free - especially in my back area - which is a problem area with a past herniated disc.

I kind of rediscovered Jane Fonda at this stage of her life through these videos.  It helped to find out that she had some surgeries just as I have had (three knee surgeries). It was fun to do the exercises with her, and to my wonder, I found that I really liked Jane.  I forgave her for all the old stuff she did when she was young, rebellious, and self-centered.  I hope people forgive me for my youth and the foolishness of things I may have said or done, so why not forgive Jane Fonda?  It's always good to move on.

4687534,5,B005G4FFDW,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm nearly 43, 5 foot 6 inches, and about 35 pounds over where I should be. I'm strong, but not really fit and flexible, and I prefer working out at home. After a lot of experimenting, this is my weekly routine:

M,W,F: I do the Jane Fonda Walk Out--the WHOLE thing. It takes about 50 minutes, I recommend snug workout pants. You need to wear running/walking/tennis shoes and have a sturdy chair with no arms available. By the time I'm done I feel sweaty, but great. Not sore, but like I've really done my body a favor.

T, TH, Sat: I do the Trim, Tone & Flex video. You need some basic hand weights (I'm on only 2 lbs right now,) and a sturdy chair. Wear shoes.

Sunday morning: I do the AM part (the first 3 sections) of the Jane Fonda AM/PM Yoga. It is a great way to begin the day on a Sunday. You'll need a mat and hand weights.

EVERY evening, before bed: I do the PM part (the last 2 sections, and often the balance section, which is only 5 minutes.)

I haven't seen a lot of progress on the scale, but I feel amazing. I can tell the different in my energy level, my posture, and the quality of my sleeping. I love the fact that I don't leave the morning workouts feeling sore and unmotivated to do them again. On the contrary, I wake up looking forward to doing them!

The Jillian Michaels workouts are too much for me at this point and I don't like her attitude. Denise Austin is way too perky for me and I get too sore. TRY THIS COMBO. I've been doing it diligently for 9 straight days now and I feel SO much better!",1390176000,19,1561,4.118421052631579

This latest one does not disappoint. I'm about 10 years younger than Jane, and she definitely knows her audience. Her comments are interesting, her warmth and honesty about the difficulty of some moves are genuine.

I find the 20 minute workouts very helpful. Enough to stretch my muscles and invigorate me, and not discourage me from following it often.

She also has a ""meditation"" section that I love. She recommends following it before bed, but I find it relaxing after a tough day, or even in the morning to center myself.

This was really important because I was so out of shape and needed a kind and considerate introduction to getting in shape. I have always loved her low-impact aerobics videos.

Decades later and a sedentary lifestyle and office job sat in front of a computer all day I need toning. I hate aerobics and running (bad knees) so was looking for a good stretching and toning routine.  I've only used this a few times so far and really enjoy these workouts.  I was shocked at how challenging I found the lower-body workout in particular. Ms. Fonda is still fun to workout with, I love her self-depreciating humor and the bits of advice she gives during the course of the workouts, acknowledging how our bodies have changed.  I plan to use this workout several times a week. The guided relaxation is a wonderful stress reliever to use after working out or just when you need to re-center!",1364342400,,865,4.633986928104576

4687615,4,B005G4FFDW,"This is a good workout for the intended audience.
Years ago I had used some of Jane Fonda's other workouts. They were comprehensive and vigorous. I trust her to produce something worthwhile. I am 60 years old and exercise nearly every day. I bought this looking for an alternate routine to eleviate bordom. It is not really as intense as I need.
Having said that, it IS a good routine. Easy to follow and definitely geared to someone 65+ who isn't used to vigorously working out. She works all body parts, is energetic and encouraging, clear in the flow and directions, and also specifically works on fitness issues that are of concern to us seniors. (ie. arthritis, balance, etc.)
I WOULD recommend this DVD. I will use it on my ""rest"" days. If you have not been exercising regularly and want to get started with something that is very ""doable"" this may be your routine.",1362441600,,871,4.625806451612903

I have grown tired of hearing Jane Fonda say the exact same rather inanely pleasant things every time I do the workout.

I bought this as a warmup to my original workouts. I wanted to change up my routines a bit and also like the zero impact which I thought those who are overweight could use more of when working out. When watching the trailer this workout seemed so simple and easy to do. But after doing something so simple and easy for 30 minutes - oddly enough became a workout.

4687658,5,B005G4FFDW,"The sexy Jane Fonda of my 80s workout tape - resplendent in her leopard unitard - has morphed into a well-preserved, but still elderly, woman in a demure yoga outfit.  The women working out with her no longer are reed-thin, sporting bright leotards, leg warmers and big hair.  Instead, rather stocky women with sensible haircuts and loose gear follow Jane as she gently leads us through movements to help prevent arthritis and strengthen joints.

How times have changed ...

She discusses why strengthening certain muscles will help keep our knees intact, and urges us to pretend we're backing a car out of the driveway as we swivel sideways to stretch our obliques.  At first, I rolled my eyes as I started, thinking it would be a total waste of time.  But guess what?  I was wrong!

Her voice is as familiar to me as my sister's - after all, how many hundreds of hours have we spent together over the years?  She still reminds us to straighten our backs and to breathe.  She counts out the reps and keeps up a positive patter as we bend and stretch.  The routines are easy, but I definitely feel a burn and, to be honest, I emerge more energized and spirited after a session.  Working out with Jane is like working out with a familiar friend.  As I exercise my arms and lengthen my back, it's reassuring to know that we are all in this aging thing together - and it's a great way to start the day.",1352678400,18,1399,4.43921568627451

4687667,5,B005G4FFDW,"I purchased Jane Fonda Prime Time: Trim, Tone & Flex and Jane Fonda Prime Time: Firm & Burn Low Impact Cardio CDs at the same time. So glad I did. I have been alternating the videos, which are very different.
I selected the full 40 minutes of workout time on each video and realized how out of shape I was. Firm & Burn Low Impact Cardio was the toughest. Perspiration was running down the sides of my face along with a full body sweat. Phew! Trim Tone & Flex truly works most muscles in the upper and lower body. I can tell which muscles are the strongest or weakest. I am definitely on my way to a healthier me.
Thanks Jane for thinking of people that are really out of shape or need to bounce back from a health issue! These videos fit both.

This is the first Jane Fonda exercise dvd I have tried. I am used to Denise Austin and better yet Wai Lana Yoga. I love Wai Lana`s style. Very slow, fluid & graceful. And she speaks in a soft voice, never once saying ""watch Me"", which Jane says maybe two dozen times on this. A good workout, but I`m not crazy about her style or ego.

The workouts are not too strenuous and combine a little warm-up, some yoga, some Pilates, some cardio, some aerobic, etc. The music is soothing, not pounding like other programs. Jane is chatty, and moves things along at a good pace. Workouts last about 20-30 minutes and have two levels. The program is great for people getting back into some basic exercise, people recovering from injury, boomers whose joints aren't what they used to be, and anyone who just wants to stay home to exercise and not have to drive to the gym. You don't need any fancy equipment either. I think they're a wonderful addition to anyone's fitness program.",1330041600,7,736,4.7578125

Even though she looks to be in great shape, she uses the modifications that a beginner would need to use.  She demonstrates everything, and she coaches throughout.  It's not so fast that I couldn't catch on quickly.  There is a great deal of thought behind these exercises.  I heard her talking about this on the radio, and she explained that older people need exercise to avoid injury and maintain flexibility. Glad I tried it!",1329523200,9,569,4.64

4687681,4,B005G4FFDW,I have MS so some days my body doesn't move very fast. This video took things slow but stayed with each exercise so it was effective for the particular part of your body that you wanted to strengthen.  I have done videos for years but can't do what I used to at the same pace due to MS and joint pain. I feel this video is gentle for anyone no matter what your age or ability. I want to stay fit but can't do a lot of the fast pace videos. I end up hurting my hip or neck when I jump around and jerk too fast. I'm glad that Jane put out one for our aging bodies or for some of us who have certain limitations. I love this video.,1329350400,14,628,3.7938931297709924

I hope someday you get to read this because I want you to know how much I appreciate what you have done for me.  I'm about 6 months younger than you, but up until about a year ago I felt like an old lady. Today after losing 40 pounds, I move like I did when I was 20 and I feel amazing. I look pretty darn good for a 73 year old too.  I started out doing the Prime Time ""Walkout"" and ""Fit & Strong"", then this year I got the two new ones, ""Trim, Tone,& Flex"" and ""Firm & Burn"".  I work out with you three times a week and alternate the videos so that I'm never bored.  The exercises are fun, and I'm so glad you keep reminding me to stand tall, hold in my tummy, and breathe. Even after all this time, I still need those reminders.  I also like the fact that you address balance problems in seniors and I continue to work on that as well as refining my technique in performing the exercises, making sure I'm doing them right.  I've been blessed to have had no major surgeries or illnesses in my life, so I am able to do the moves without risking pain.  Oh, by the way, I wear a size 2 jeans, yea!!  You are such an inspiration to me, Jane.  Thank you so much.  Looking forward to your next pair of videos.",1328745600,7,1216,3.9670781893004117
