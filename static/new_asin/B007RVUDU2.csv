5109377,4,B007RVUDU2,This was frightening.  Transhumanism is a terrible idea and our world will be changed forever for the worse if our governments pursue this any further.  Do we really need to modify living organisms any further than we already have?  I say let's stop at corn and not try to send genetically modified soldiers to fight at war.,1353456000,4,324,4.649122807017544
8521550,2,B007RVUDU2,"This documentary takes the notion of Transhumanism and attempts to point out the beginnings of this movement from the start of mapping the human genome through the decades of transgenics that started with the food and drug research years with the sporadic enthusiasm of a paranoid schizophrenic. There are some compelling arguments in the documentary that cant be ignored from the studies that show transgenics is having a negative affect not only on the natural world but also on man by creating new strains of ailments and an increase in cancers. However it only took around 30 minutes before the host of this documentary turns it into a fear inducing rhetoric based on Christian values. The subject of Transhumanism is a fascinating topic both the fantastical implications of possible  benefit and the argument of detriment to the natural balance that would without doubt be compromised.

Hybrid World has a lot of interesting information within it and the topic is one of the hottest going around the internet conspiracy world. My only problem with this documentary is how it was represented. It tries very hard but fails at being unbiased and universally embraceable. Not everyone is Christian or a Naturalist so the argumental points used to argue against transgenics comes off as Right-Winged and abrasive. There is a specific audience that this documentary is aiming to appeal to and it is the religious, anti-Obama, liberal = evil segment of todays society. In the beginning it is less obvious but like I said earlier within about 30 minutes the thing takes a direct and focused agenda stance that is meant to instill fear against scientific advancements.  With that said this is a killer conspiracy topic and if your against manipulation of genetics or the research and development of genetics in general then this conspiracy will speak volumes to you. If you are a member of the Transhumanist movement then this will be an offense and sound like an anthem of despise.",1431216000,,1978,5.006079027355623
8521551,4,B007RVUDU2,This stuff should scare you if you have a soul. It sounds fake but check out the crazy creatures they keep finding in India. Why do they keep finding monsters in India and not all over the world. It makes you think. What about the alleged body farms. India is a strange place. How would you feel about creating human frigs to cure cancer. Would that be ethical.  After seeing this I now sleep with my guns loaded. Horror films have nothing compared to reality. This is some scary stuff. If you get upset easily then stear clear.,1426291200,,528,4.387755102040816

8521554,1,B007RVUDU2,"The information in the video was very informative.  Horn knows the topic well.  However, the ""Special features"" after the film included graphic imagery from a film about sado-masochism and perverted sex - including depictions of nudity and sexual acts in the preview.  DO NOT GET THIS FILM.  Instead, go for his film with Chuck Missler - The Hybrid Age put out by Koinonia House.",1405296000,8,379,4.875
8521555,2,B007RVUDU2,"What is interesting is how this DVD was mislabeled in the description field. Right underneath the title, it says Ken Klein (actor). I didn't see him in it. What's this all about? That's the main reason why I purchased it. I checked out other sites that offer this DVD. Almost all don't mention Ken Klein on their listing.

Thomas Horn talked for around 55 minutes and 20 seconds. Tom is not mentioned on the DVD cover either. What he said was interesting.

The cover says the run time is 60 minutes in length. Now while that makes it short by a few minutes, when you add all of this together, you begin to wonder...

The special features appears to contain ads for dark movies at the reality-entertainment website.",1374969600,,714,4.5625
8521556,5,B007RVUDU2,For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction. I think that is lesson to be learned here. When you toy with Mother Nature the results can be unexpected. Especially if the intent is nefarious.,1368921600,,202,4.638888888888889
8521557,5,B007RVUDU2,It's pretty obvious to me that the powers that be are trying to keep information from us. After watching this video it's even clearer. Genetic modification is just one piece of the puzzle. We must remain vigilant and stick together if the human race is going to have a chance.,1368835200,,276,4.54
