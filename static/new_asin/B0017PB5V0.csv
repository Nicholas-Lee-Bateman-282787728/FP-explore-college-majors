3174932,5,B0017PB5V0,"The sequences presented on this DVD have been the journey for healing my body, mind and soul.
Micheline is an example of beauty and grace. Her sensuality is inspirational. Her energy in contagious. This flow is unique. It is wonderful to experience that our bodies are designed to move like water. I recommend Liquid Asana: The Fluid Dance of Vinyasa Flow to all yogis and yoginis. This flow makes us dive into the sensual and undulating dance that deepens our breath, helps our bodies getting stronger and brings more joy to our lives.
Actually I've been in Brazil for 2 months and It's been an honor and a great chance to practice Micheline's flow at anytime. I am so grateful for this gift.",1215993600,4,693,4.642276422764228
3174933,5,B0017PB5V0,"This DVD is inspiring, uplifting as well as challenging.  Micheline's voice is soothing, angelic and direct.  the sequences are straight forward, creative and easy to follow along with.  I was able to listen while doing the poses and stay in the relaxed flow that the DVD inspires without getting confused or having to come out of the pose to look at the TV in order to follow along. Micheline guides the audience like we are her own students.  She explains the movements and reminds the viewer to breath and surrender to the movement. Also she asks that we challenge ourselves to go deeper, meet our edges of resistance and move past any obstacles to our health, vitality, strength and inner radiance.  Micheline herself executes the poses and is an example of proper alignment, poise and grace. I recommend Liquid Asana to serious yogis as well as those just starting on their yogic path.

3174934,5,B0017PB5V0,"As a yoga practitioner for over 25 years, I find Micheline's DVD to be a perfect guide for my home practice.  For beginner's,  Micheline's detailed instructions are simple and clear, and for the more advanced, her vinyasa sequence is well rounded, complete and beautifully paced for any level.
Her voice and beautiful  music put you right where you need to be for a fabulous yoga experience.",1213920000,4,391,4.893939393939394
3174935,5,B0017PB5V0,"Micheline Berry's introduction will inspire anyone to take to their yoga mat.  As she instructs during the video, her explanations, along with the videography, provide the perfect pace (you can actually keep up with, and enjoy) and example (visual demonstrations) for those who are new to learning yoga... and for those who have been practicing and want to refresh some of their key foundation skills.  Her voice (very pleasant to listen to) and the beautiful studio in which she's practicing are the cherry on top!",1213920000,8,515,5.047058823529412
3174936,5,B0017PB5V0,"This DVD is now my favorite yoga DVD. I have several Shiva Rhea DVD's and also loved them, but I have had some back problems that require me to be more gentle with my back. Micheline Berry's Beginners Flow Practice is slow and gentle, yet still powerful. I can't do the poses that cause my back to bend backward, but I just substitute back exercises and do them to the soothing music until she moves on to the next section. I didn't know what to expect when I read the review about ""all the Hindu religious elements"" and ""Hindu religious icons"". Maybe I'm not worldly enough, but I didn't see anything that I would have equated with religion. Yoga is an ancient exercise form and the inclusion of ancient elements, whether it be rhythmic chants or esoteric music or stone carvings of yoga poses between transitions, really helps me to forget the everyday world and focus on breathing and doing the yoga flow. I love the way I feel at the end of the practice.",1238198400,6,958,4.48
3174937,5,B0017PB5V0,"As a 52 year old woman, deep in the throes of menopause I finally found some relief by practicing Yoga with Michelline's dvd. It woke up my sensuality, I sleep better and I feel happier. The 50 minutes passed so easily due to her smooth relaxing voice and beautiful choice of music.  I have been practicing yoga for 6 years and I know this dvd will always keep me interested and focused. This is a must have for home practice, and I love it.",1235347200,5,441,4.25
3174938,5,B0017PB5V0,"I've been looking for a DVD series that could replace going to a class - this is it. It feels like Micheline is in the room with me & the whole experience is a good balance of meditation & flow. Plus, the music is right on.",1235174400,3,223,3.869565217391304
3174939,4,B0017PB5V0,"I found about Micheline Berry here at Amazon searching for some new yoga DVD's and noticed she studied with Shiva Rea whom I love so of course I had to try her. I liked all of her DVD's especially her 3rd one which is still only available at her website. I find all of her DVD's to be ""Shiva Rea for beginners"" , she does some similar flowy stuff but not as much as Shiva and nothing is too strenuous or too fast , though I don't think it's for complete beginners. This second volume offers slightly more advanced poses than the first one - it starts with some core activation with variations of cat and a plank vinyasa and then surya namskar A&B and standing poses which include lunge with a twist , tree , eagle with a fluid transition to a side bend which I liked and a low lunge sequence. There are also backbends which include camel and bow and it ends with forward bends and twists and savasana. The flow itself is quite slow but she doesn't hold poses that long. There's also a liquid art segment with music that lets you extend your savasana if you want to. The music is great and includes Shaman's Dream and some more  good world music. Overall a good and balanced 50 minute vinyasa practice suitable for beginners with some experience or for days you want a slower and less intense yoga.",1231459200,11,1297,4.337448559670782

Never boring,  and wonderfully sequenced.

3174942,5,B0017PB5V0,"Slowly, in her own inimitable way, Micheline takes us through a complete yoga practice, suitable and enjoyable for all levels but especially good for beginners. Although she doesn't shy away from challenging poses, and no serious beginner should, she explains everything clearly and slowly, and yet is never boring. On the contrary, her seductively hypnotic voice and impeccable taste in music get us through full series of sophisticated sequences almost imperceptibly. You get in a groove and, when you notice, you've already done all kinds of twists.

The chapters are clearly labeled, so you can pick and choose depending on your time and disposition. And at the end she gives you time for meditation. No more, no less, all you need from a yoga practice, from an unassuming teacher with deep knowledge of the subject. If you're looking for a yoga DVD to practice at home or on the road, this one is hard to beat.",1227139200,3,915,4.865384615384615

The sequences and instruction are easy to follow and I have learned so much.  I find that Micheline's technique and style have really enhanced my passion for yoga.  It is not only a wonderful tool for learning but so beautifully presented.  She has really inspired me to continue to grow my yoga practice.  I will most certainly be using this DVD often!

8266884,2,B0017PB5V0,"It's kind of ""ho-hum"".  I feel like I am a fairly fit person, but some of the exercises on this DVD came close to putting my back out.  Proceed with caution.",1422662400,,157,4.032258064516129
8266885,1,B0017PB5V0,I felt the title and description was misleading.  There is really no dance mixed in to the yoga and I found the yoga routine to be a little boring.,1418947200,,147,4.068965517241379

8266888,3,B0017PB5V0,"Her instruction's were clear and concise and her tone of voice was very smooth and tender. She is a great teacher and the way she put some of the flows together were very simple and easy to follow.

 My only issue with this dvd is that it states that it is vinyasa flow but you don't flow on your own ever and the flows were very simplistic for an intermediate flow.  Which is why I am giving this video 3 stars, because the title was misleading and I didn't get the type of exercise that I wanted.

I would recommend this dvd for people just starting out in their practice but if you are an intermediate-to-advance student, I would look for other options.",1391299200,,656,4.308943089430894
8266889,2,B0017PB5V0,I thought I was purchasing a creative movement yoga DVD.  It was very slow and I didn't find the rhythim that Micheline Berry kept going on about.  Disappointed.  I've seen much more creative yoga videos elsewhere.,1378339200,,214,4.888888888888889
8266890,4,B0017PB5V0,"This is a really nice practice.  Although her cuing isn't the best and often times I had to look at the screen, the music is superb, the set is beautiful, and the practice itself and sequencing is very nice. She is a good teacher, but her cuing was sometimes difficult to follow by words alone.

Micheline's voice is soothing and clear.  It's done in voice over, which is my preference.

For those who compare her to Shiva Rea, I agree that they both say ""listen to your body, move with your body,"" but Micheline does seem to provide more direction or structure on how to do that. I know that with Shiva, a lot of people are thrown by the ""just move"" comments.

This is a lengthy practice with little chaptering.  The savasana is just one minute, but there's a five minute ""liquid meditation"" that's separate that can be used for savasana.

She's a caring and compassionate teacher.  For someone seeking a one-hour practice, this is a nice practice that combines movement and relaxation.

I look forward to trying the more advanced DVDs in her series.",1372032000,,1051,4.60752688172043
8266891,5,B0017PB5V0,"I've been practising yoga for a couple of years now, but with some longer breaks. I have at least 20 yoga DVDs and the most of them are either for the beginners ( for ex. Barbara Brennan) or for very advanced ( Shiva Rea). On those beginners DVDs you find the same basic poses that change without any flow. Those for advanced practitioners are just impossible to follow if you are not flexible enough. This DVD by Micheline Berry is really intermediate level- as it says it is. The tempo is just adequate for the intermediate user, the poses and flows are neither too easy nor  too difficult to perform. She gives you some challenges, but if a pose is a little bit more challenging than others, it doesn't last long. The music is beautiful and the voiceover is just right.

I have also noticed that there is a 'meditation' at the end of the DVD , which is just a peaceful music, perfect for savasana. And, when it's over, the DVD is switched to title menu, and the same music just continues!
I appreciate it, because it's so upsetting on some DVD's when you want to spend some more time lying in savasana, and DVD switches itself to title menu with some abrupt, energizing music, and just destroys this delicious feeling of bliss and tranquility.

So, if you want a perfect yoga practice for an intermediate practitioner, that's it!",1359763200,4,1332,4.541666666666667
8266892,5,B0017PB5V0,"As always, before purchasing any fitness DVD I consult the reviews on Amazon, and liked what I was reading.  When I received Liquid Asana this afternoon, I popped it in immediately, even though I'd done a cardio/strength training routine this morning.

I am an ABSOLUTE beginner when it comes to actual yoga.  I've done the occasional sun salutation as part of a warm-up on other DVDs, but never a full yoga routine.  That being said, Micheline Berry's direction and style were easy to follow and soothing.  I found the routine doable, but not easy--certainly something I will get many repeated uses out of.  I appreciated the occasional reminders during a pose of what muscles to engage, what to relax, and how to breathe when.  The music was also very nice, and I didn't notice any strong suggestions of any particular religious associations--Berry encourages that the practitioner become more one with the body and, of course, flow with the breath.  I can't recommend this DVD too highly, and I plan to purchase the Intermediate Flow DVD once this one becomes easier.",1249344000,8,1070,4.905555555555556
