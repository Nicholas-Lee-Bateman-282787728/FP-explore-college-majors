336040,5,6301598946,"I chose this rating because I have watched this movie for years  and find the history of the time period fascinating.  The movie is pretty close to the way Gwen Bristow wrote about in ""Jubilee Trail"" - a great book for those interested in women's history of the west.  I recommend this movie highly.  It's an oldie, but goodie.",1401494400,2,327,4.491525423728813

336045,5,6301598946,"I saw this movie years ago and was glad to see in on Amazon.  It was about a variety of people from all walks of life who happened by chance to come together.  No one asked questions about the others past. It was heartbreaking, entertaining and just a good, wholesome story.  The color was vivid and beautiful.  If you like the older western movies, I'm sure you will enjoy this one.",1369526400,,383,4.352112676056338
336046,5,6301598946,"I LOVE Jubilee Trail by Gwen Bristow.  I have read and reread this book many, many times.  I am due for another reread!  I introduced this book to my daughter when she was a teenager and she read and rereads it.  She is now an English Professor at a prestigous college and she still loves Jubilee Trail.
I gave her my copy for her growing library.  My youngest son knew how much I loved the book and actually tracked it down (through Amazon, where else?) and gifted me one Christmas.  I was amazed at his thoughtfulness and appreciate the gift so much.  Thank you Amazon!",1348185600,,571,4.380952380952381
336047,2,6301598946,"Jubilee Trail was my favorite book for many years and I was thrilled when it was made into a movie. The book is comparable to Gone With the Wind and would have made an almost equally epic movie. Unfortunately, they went Grade B all the way. Grade B actors, miscasting, terrible writing, cheap filming. It was terrible. I wanted to sit down and cry at what had been done to a wonderful story. I wish someone would film this story again and do it the right way but that ain't gonna happen.",1331769600,2,487,4.304347826086956

336205,5,6301598946,"I actually passed up Jubilee Trail several times in the past few days just because of the picture on the cover, it didn't interest me.  But after watching several westerns that I wish I hadn't, I came back to it because of the high ratings most everyone was giving it.  I'm glad did, because it was well written, I liked the cast, and it kept my interest.

It was also nice to see a young looking Forrest Tucker play a roll where he ended up with the lady at the end of the movie.  I read others say the video wasn't good, but my viewing was great!  It's well worth watching and I give it 5 stars, or a grade of A-.",1450396800,2,615,4.008196721311475

336209,5,6301598946,"Clearly Vera is aged somewhat in this colorful, well put together western saga, each actor/actress given their own snap shot role, from mexican dons, the new American wantabe dons, Fremonts settling brigades, and Joan is a tough as they come, hangs in there until her threats are ended.  Forrest always delivers and the movies is filled with enough diversities that will make you head spin.  Vera sees the trail through to the end, only revealing her own dilemma in the end.  This is good stuff!",1435622400,,495,4.8

336300,3,6301598946,I read the book and liked it enough to want to see the movie. It was sentimental and not as informative but I am glad I got to see it anyway. They can't cover all the material but it was an easy watch.,1429401600,,201,3.697674418604651

So many times when I re-watch something that I remember as being such a good movie when I was 10 or 12 doesn't seem quite so good now. I was very pleasantly surprised to find I loved it just as much now as I did then.",1422576000,,322,4.111111111111111

7812882,3,6301598946,"This is less of a western than a historical saga about the early days of California in the mid-19th century, from 1845 to the 1850s. It's quite an ambitious production for Republic Pictures and is closer to the kind of thing Warner Bros. used to turn out regularly 10-15 years earlier (think GOLD IS WHERE YOU FIND IT, VALLEY OF THE GIANTS, SANTA FE TRAIL, SARATOGA TRUNK, SILVER RIVER). It's flawed in many ways, but I enjoyed watching it, thanks to its beautiful Trucolor cinematography, possibly the best example I've yet seen of Trucolor, a process used exclusively by Republic Pictures, and its large, colorful cast including Republic regulars Vera Ralston, Forrest Tucker, Jim Davis and Grant Withers and Warner Bros. refugees Joan Leslie, Pat O'Brien, and Barton MacLane, not to mention John Russell, Richard Webb, Buddy Baer, Ray Middleton, Nina Varela and a host of Latino actors playing the original Spanish settlers of California. Although Ralston is top-billed (she was the wife of studio head Herbert Yates), it's really Joan Leslie's film, with Forrest Tucker as her leading man. Based on a best-selling novel, although it might not be too faithful to it. If anything I've said here intrigues you, then you're curious enough to give this a chance.",1461024000,,1261,5.0095238095238095
