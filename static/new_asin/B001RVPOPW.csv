3781196,5,B001RVPOPW,"I just watched this film for the second time and am convinced that this film is destined to be hailed, cursed and studied for years to come ~ Lars von Trier is so brillant. (DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.)

I believe this is a metaphorical movie about misogyny (the hatred of women). For example, the character played by Charlotte Gainbourg, her thesis was on ""Gynocide"" and the torturing of women ~ there were photos of the witch hunts in the attic, the husband discovers. The child's shoes, twisting the bones in his feet to grow perversely, were symbolic to Chinese foot binding of little girls. Her orgasm and watching the child fall from the window is tricky. But I think it was to show the possiblility of calousness/""evil"" in females. It possibly even has to do with how women are shamed when it comes to their sexuality. She even goes so far as to mutilate her own genitals ~ as was, and is still, forced on little girls and teenagers.

Eden is significant in that Eve, in the creation myth in the Bible, is blamed for letting loose ""evil"" and ""sin"" into the world. She is the vessel thru which life springs and thusly death follows, as ancient misogynists use to preach... that may be the child falling metaphor there. Historians consider the Bible a misogynistic text, so the anti-christ title may mean something along the lines of that feminism is anti-christ.
I mean, go back and listen to the dialogue! This movie is an incredible conversational piece about misogyny and the silence of our history as women, and the emotional chaos that stems from the violence of which we've sprung. It's also poetic, horrifying, enchanting, and authentic. (I hope those animals weren't actually harmed but I don't know.) The acting is phenomenal. The storytelling ~ dreamlike and nightmarish.

Be brave. Watch it again... but listen.
As an apropo footnote, I also HIGHLY recommend reading

3781197,5,B001RVPOPW,"The movie affected me so much that I went to sleep and woke up questioning it. The acting was extraordinarily precise and the setting was haunting but there were several things that i could not resolve in my mind. First,
what did Nic's deformity of the feet mean, was it just symbolism of imperfection that translated into the ultimate
insanity of the mother? Why did the mother put the shoes on backwards, was that the first sign of her break with
reality. I watched the movie twice, can't do it again for a while. Question 2: what was the reason for the use
of gynocide and what did that illustrate, nature was satan and it was human nature that was evil. It shook me to my
core. I love both actors and admire their performances though I don't think I can watch it again. At the end after
he escaped what was the reason for all the women coming up the hill. Were these the dead that had been liberated from the past and if so why were they free and what did the wife's death mean to those women? Was Eden hell, was he the evil or was the wife the evil? You too will have some questions, no  doubt. I am a therapist and I don't recommend this for the squeamish. This is not classified ""Horror"" but it is the worst kind of horror, something we can all relate to on some level or some part. The bottom line is
that this was a couple caught in a tragic event, a mother in deep grief and guilt for allowing Nic's death to happen
and a loving but arrogant husband who thought he could save her sanity by isolating her and putting her thru a
series of psychological exercises, challenging her misperceptions which ultimately turned her anger and guilt
toward him. Was this arrogant act another demonstration of female abuse. I have read some of the comments but no
one addresses the reason for his survival and her demise. If anyone has any ideas about eh women going to the cabin at the end and the husband's act of murder of his wife, for compassion of her suffering, hopelessness of her recovery or punishment of her rage directed toward him. If you need happy endings, forget it, I will be looking at
this from so many perspectives and asking questions for the next few years that maybe that is the true values of this form of art.",1256860800,8,2230,4.3349282296650715
3781198,3,B001RVPOPW,"This is quite possibly the most disturbing film I've ever sat through. While Antichrist doesn't show absolutely everything and it's usually rather brief when it comes to showing disturbing material, it shows enough to make your stomach drop.

Everything leading to the last half of the film is done incredibly well. The cinematography is rather incredible, especially while they're in Eden. Everything is so lush and green while certain shots alone say more than the characters in the film ever could. The score is haunting and successfully establishes putting its viewers on edge. The entire film is spent with this married couple and their performances are top notch. It's just those last thirty to forty five minutes take such an abrupt turn. Nothing can really prepare you for how unrelenting and horrifying the finale is. The events that unfold in this film will haunt you and stick with you for an incredibly long time.

The less you know about Antichrist, the more surprising that first viewing will be. That's the main reason this review is so vague. Don't read up on it and don't watch anything other than the trailer before seeing the film. Just be warned, the film shows enough for a gutwrenching reaction. Antichrist's strongest asset is the atmosphere it builds throughout the film. The air just seems to be constantly thick with the fact that something terrible is going to happen at any moment. While the film is disturbing, shocking, and was able to make me feel things most horror films aren't capable of, I wouldn't say the film was enjoyable. The film takes its toll on you and I don't think it's a film I'd really enjoy sitting through again.",1256342400,15,1662,4.848591549295775
3781199,4,B001RVPOPW,"""It is a repulsive, perplexing piece of art"" as described by the press notes of writer/director Lars Von Trier's latest film ""ANTICHRIST"". This would be the best way to describe this metaphysical journey as the film seems to have been made with the full intent to shock, sicken and dare the viewer to sit through the brutal acts of unreasonable violence and painstaking themes that taps into the depredation of the undone mind. This film is not for the squeamish but fans of Von Tier would marvel to his return his enticing confrontational appetites that blatantly exploit human suffering and misogyny to add to his visions and daydreams in a very disquieting manner.

The characters in ""AntiChrist"" are unnamed as we can only refer to the lead characters as a HE (Willem DaFoe) and SHE (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Von Tier begins the film with some very intense intercourse as their infant son crawls out of his crib to an open window and eventually fall to his death. Devastated, the couple feels that their sexual appetites have contributed to the death of their only child. SHE falls into deep depression and HE is a therapist who disagrees with the medical care given his wife. HE decides to take his own wife under his care and to take the devastated woman to their remote cabin in the woods. Once there, SHE's consciousness begins to further fall into madness as the woods give her much more memories about their deceased son. The wife also begins to feed upon images in the research of witches as the husband tries to counter her ailing mind with logic and psychiatric training. The evil that lurks in the woods eventually begin to overcome SHE as she becomes a destructive force goaded by archaic instincts to defy his best efforts to cure her.

If anything, Von Trier's desire to shock, unnerve and bring scenes of discomfort to his viewer is brutally effective. Most people would say that the film borders on challenging the borders of taste as the film has a lot of violence, sex and full frontal nudity. It is very difficult to dissect this film without spoilers so I will try to avoid discussing many key scenes; the film's main strength comes from its ability to make the viewer uncomfortable and the sensation of shock and surprise is crucial to its enjoyment (if you can call discomfort that way). Von Tier fills the screen with gothic imagery, unsettling atmosphere and sexual games to drive his theme of grief and depression. The film has a lot of symbolisms and metaphors; as the audience is drawn to Von Tier's theatrics. ""AntiChrist"" may not match the intensity of ""Dancing In the Dark"" but the film still proves to be an intriguing piece of taxing surrealism and controversial undertone.

The film may become too cryptic for its own good and will prove too much to swallow for the inexperienced movie watcher. I am pretty open-minded and I revel in darkly twisted films but there were times that the screenplay taxed my brain as it felt a little incoherent. It is an unrelenting journey to the deep end of the line; as we become privy to SHE and her descent into extreme madness. It does help as Von Tier divides the film into four chapters as he begins the film with an arresting, beautifully shot barren monochrome as to usher the misery that is to come. The film has a few symbolic entities such as ""Grief"", ""Pain"" (chaos reigns), Despair (gynocide) and the ""Three Beggars"" that brings the depths of SHE and her quickly deteriorating sanity. The monochrome sequence stuns rather quickly as the audience is brought into a very graphic display of intercourse, as it brings the audience in a dispiriting scene of tragedy. The film's mood becomes more catastrophic from there.

Von Trier seems to represent his main characters as ORDER and NATURE. HE is a determined to pull his wife from the brink of chaos while SHE is a force of nature whose hysterical and increasingly deranged state appear natural and unstoppable. HE is determined to go to the depths of her psyche and SHE is determined to fight off this assault; it is obvious that the film is meant to shock as we see the mental conflict that rages between the two. SHE uses sexual favors and hysteria as she is tormented by the forest itself, fearing an evil that equals feminism itself,  as explored in her Biblical thesis of the historical decline of women as 'agents of chaos' when driven by forces unexpected and beyond control.

Scissors and stones meet genital areas as images of self-mutilation, torture and stillborn imagery becomes commonplace in the film. Uneasy sequences they may be but they prove necessary to exhibit and augment the suffering of the two protagonists. There is a calculated ugliness in ""AntiChrist"" as the film resorts to verbal hostility for the first two acts until the horror elements are kicked into high gear that includes some very graphic genital mutilation. Trier brings some bloody ejaculate and female circumcision that is complemented by the case of pure delirium in the woods of Eden.

""AntiChrist"" is a movie not for the faint of heart. I cannot say that I can give the film a strong recommendation since the film just gets its strengths from graphic imagery. However graphic and disquieting the film is, it is mesmerizing as the film has some enthralling tricks of camerawork, nice artwork-like compositions and the naked despair is just able to move the most detached watcher. Much of the film's burden falls on Charlotte Gainsbourg and she delivers in her portrayal; she is scary yet so sympathetic. Von Trier's ""AntiChrist"" is very combative and definitely tests your threshold for discomfort and pain. You have to have a mindset that is bold and daring to partake of this dark, slow-burning, ""art house"" horror movie.

The Film is of very graphic nature that only a timid recommendation may be given. [4- Stars]",1256342400,3,5836,4.8
3781200,4,B001RVPOPW,"Self indulgence is inherent in storytelling. In the case of filmmaking, we have the writer and director, who each have a specific vision of what will unfold in front of the camera. What ultimately limits the vision are practical matters such as budgets, limits of technology, studio meddling, scheduling, the MPAA, or any combination thereof. Watching Lars von Trier's ""Antichrist,"" it became abundantly clear, rather quickly, that I was watching a completely unlimited vision. This is a truly self indulgent story, and in all honesty, I don't know whether or not I mean that as a criticism. I appreciated Trier's audacity to make the movie he intended to make, yet I find myself in utter disbelief over the confusingly allegorical plot and the extreme sexual content, some of which validates the criticism that the film is misogynist.

It stars Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg, who were indeed brave to accept their roles. They had an even bigger challenge than simply making their characters believable; they had to be physically and emotional vulnerable, and at times, this required them to act in scenes so frighteningly cringe-inducing that it wouldn't be enough to call them shocking. Trier is obviously trying to provoke the audience, not merely in terms of violence and gore, but also in terms of heavy dialogue, strange setups, a meandering structure, and bizarre symbolism. The title in and of itself is an attention grabber, and it will almost certainly inspire visions of unspeakable (and typical) demonic horrors. Ah, but this movie isn't about to let you off so easy. The title, just like everything else we see, is open to interpretation.

For example, is the word ""antichrist"" referring to Dafoe or Gainsbourg, their characters known only as He and She? The film, divided into four titled sections, opens with a prologue that shows He and She graphically having sex as their infant son falls to his death from an open bedroom window. As the story proper begins, in a chapter called ""Grief,"" we find that He won't let She go through the process of grieving. He's a therapist, you see, and as such, He would rather treat his wife's symptoms through a series of mental exercises while jotting down meaningless notes in a hierarchical pyramid. He sees She not as a wife so much as a clinical experiment, and regards her distantly and coldly, almost as if He were trying to punish her for their son's death. Would a caring husband take his mourning wife to a cabin in the middle of the woods, a place She has been before and intensely fears?

But why did She go to this cabin, named Eden? To write a thesis, naturally, although She never finished it. She has, however, done enough research on the forces of nature to make her believe that women are inherently evil. Now that her son is dead, She has all the more reason to devalue and punish herself. But does She also have reason to devalue and punish her husband? By now we have reached the second and third chapters, called ""Pain"" and ""Despair,"" both of which follow such twisted and disturbing logic that it's difficult to think past how the mind could conceive of it. They involve the appearances of a crow, a fox, and a deer, each so ghastly in appearance that it's impossible to think of them as of this earth.

By the time we reach the fourth chapter, ""The Three Beggars,"" He and She find themselves in extreme physical and psychological situations. The outside world, unnatural in every sense, is cold, filthy, and inhospitable. Tree roots sprout human limbs. Caves and tall grasses shield terrifying representations of animals. As for Eden, which is decaying both outside and in, it's eerily claustrophobic and a perfect catalyst for He and She's respective emotional breakdowns. They really do know how to hurt each other. More to the point, She knows how to hurt herself. She wants to hurt herself. She wants him to hurt her. It becomes an exhausting and grotesque downward spiral, where suffering and anger give way to physical punishments best left unspoken of.

Inevitably, it comes down to a simple question: Is ""Antichrist"" a good movie? The thing is, I don't think the word ""good"" really applies here. If immediate reaction is of any indication, then the truth is I left the theater feeling disgusted and emotionally drained. However, I also found myself a little in awe of Trier, having the nerve to release a film so uncompromising. And there is no mistaking the artistry that went into virtually every shot. The ending, while highly enigmatic, is visually stunning, playing into the figurative nature of plot. So if I can't give it credit for delighting me, I can certainly give it credit simply for affecting me. Some filmmakers, I suspect, are not interested in telling a story so much as they are in being memorable, be it in a positive or negative light. You may like ""Antichrist"" or you may hate it, but either way, you will almost certainly never forget it.",1256169600,60,4951,4.826855123674911
3781201,1,B001RVPOPW,I thought this movie would be something pertaining to demons and what not but I was wrong. This was one of the worst I have seen don't get me wrong I like wierd movies just not this one. I had to fast forward to the end when it kind of got more interesting. The movie is very slow and just has no point to it other then she is sad cause her kid died. All I'm saying is if you don't like really odd movies then do not get this one at all S Darko was better and that was alright.,1254096000,3,477,3.732673267326733
3781202,4,B001RVPOPW,Powerful film. Brilliant performances. Very depressing but strangely arousing as well. Fantastic ending. Not a good first date movie but well worth your time.,1252368000,7,158,5.625
3781203,3,B001RVPOPW,"I have never heard of the work of Lars Von Trier and I have only ever heard mutterings, both positive and negative, of his skills as a director. I am afraid that I am going to lean towards the negatives and agree with the one claim of the director being pretentious. The movie is not a bad effort and actually provided quite a disturbing viewing experience whilst still maintaining my interest throughout. In the UK and, undoubtedly the rest of the world, this film has drawn massive controversy for its graphic sexual depictions and other depictions of self mutilation. There are times when the graphic violence or sexual nature work for the purpose of the plot structure, yet there are other times when the graphic nature appears as a gratuitous insult to my visual senses. The sheer lack of subtlety is what really made me rate this film quite low as in my own perspective; a good director can show as little as possible of the core event of a scene whilst still creating the same desired impact and gaining the same desired reaction from the audience.

The plot focuses around He & She, Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg. At the start of the film we see this couple locked in a passionate sexual encounter whilst their young baby boy, Nic falls to his death from a bedroom window. The film is split into four chapters; Grief, Pain (Chaos Reigns), Despair (Gynocide) and The Three Beggars. Chapter 1 shows She wrapped with grief at the death of their child and after collapsing during his funeral she is put in hospital. He, being distrustful of the Psychological care she is receiving, decides to take it upon himself to give her therapy to help her get over the grief of their dead son. During the therapy sessions she keeps visiting an old log cabin located deep in a forest known as Eden. This is her worst fear and it is revealed that this was a cabin where she spent her last summer with Nic whilst she was writing her thesis on Gynocide. He decides that the best way to help her overcome her grief is to visit this cabin and have her confront her fear, little is known at the beginning but the cabin starts to make things a whole lot worse as she falls deeper and deeper into her own insanity.

At the initial glance of the trailers of the film and the numerous reports you would read about it, you would be forgiven for thinking this is in any way a horror film. It is not. It is more a psychological thriller as you see both characters destroyed in their own way by the torturous grief resulting from the death of their infant son. Dafoe at the time of making this film is quite a respected actor, but I felt his role in this film was is attempt at something new, sort of a stepping outside the box if you will. His acting was a worthy pleasantry and his placement within the film seemed to work even though I did find that in some of his scenes he seemed particularly awkward. Gainsbourg plays her role spectacularly especially when she delves further and further into the depiction of pure insanity. They had a perfect chemistry with each other and when you consider the types of acts they had to engage into together, it was something that had to exist in order for the film to really work specifically when its entire attention is focused solely around these two characters.

Lars Von Trier seems to be a bit of a fan of slow motion as, aside from the initial opening credits, there were a number of moments throughout the film when he would adopt the same slow motion technique and some of them just seemed to be utterly ridiculous. The setting of Eden was a very haunting one and you can sincerely come to terms as to the possible reasons of why this place would become a woman's worst nightmare. The controversial moments are what interested people and had them talking about this film and some of them in particular; I can not help but think they were deliberately graphic for the sake of grabbing some cheap media attention. Not being wholly familiar with other Von Trier works I can not compare this to any of his other work to really define whether this was a deliberate attention grabbing device or something that is used throughout his other films.

Overall this is a really good film. It is dark, sick and twisted and if you are of a nervous disposition then I would strongly recommend you give this a miss, or at least have a go at trying to get hold of some form of edited version as the acting alone makes the film worth a watch which is sad in one way as the thing which grabbed it the most attention was the thing, in my eyes, which dragged the quality of the film downwards.",1251936000,4,4610,4.458530805687204

He is an uncompromising artist, and a polarizing figure in film, I get that. It is brutal, jarring, and upsetting. None of which are criticisms. It is an extraordinary film by an extraordinary director and amazing actors and the squeamish should just stay away, and not make ridiculous criticisms like, ""gee, I thought it was going to be a horror movie"".

The director has said this movie is an expression of how depression feels, and I can see that. Outwardly, this is a film about a couple dealing with incredible loss. The man, a therapist, thinks he can help the woman deal with it better than doctors can. Unfortunately, as the film points out, doctors/thearpists probably should not treat their own family members, and the husband doesn't pick up on hints from his wife about what she is really feeling. With very little action in the first three acts, the film does an incredible job of creating mounting tension until a truly explosive final act. The husband may not see it coming, but the viewer feels/knows/senses something is very, very wrong here. As far as the film's reputation for horrific imagery: it's deserved.

3781217,5,B001RVPOPW,"Lars von Trier is in a venerable league of his own, and I'm humbled by how left-handedly he spins his socially apropos tales.

I'm not a big fan of spoiling the plot in a review, and, as I write this, I realize how convenient that is I don't think the plot is nearly as important to the director as is the experience hes subjecting the viewer to, in fact, I think the plot is only an ancillary utility in his 'self-awareness' promoting process.
Hollywood has, for years, trained you to be dumbly plot-centric, and Lars von Trier unapologetically smacks you upside the soul with consciousness-centric subtlety.

I was born an introvert with idealistic notions of how humans SHOULD treat one another, and for me, Lars von Trier uses the film genre (plot, scenery, dialog, art, horror, gore, sex, etcetera) as a tool to render his own idealism in a way that examines just how prevailingly the selfish and the reckless rule this good Earth.
Sun and moon and fox and crow ...modern culture is out of synch with a natural order. What selfish entitlements do you justify, and how do you perpetuate the reckless swing of our SHARED social pendulum?

I also enjoy horror, and heard this was Lars von Trier's take on the genre. Personally, I enjoyed ""Antichrist"". It's visually and psychologically effective as an ""avant garde"" horror film.  I've read some reviews calling it inherently misogynistic. I'm not sure I 100% agree with that, but I don't 100% disagree either. I feel like the intentions of the characters are vague enough that you can't make a blanket assumption that all of the motivations come from a misogynistic place. Both She and He have their individual neuroses and they act those neuroses out upon each other (and themselves) throughout the movie.  I think von Trier's goal is for the individual viewer to determine for themselves how guilty or righteous or ambiguous either characters intentions are. And, as always for von Trier, some of what's there is there simply to provoke thoughts/emotions/reactions from his audience by being.... well, provocative.

With all of that being said, a warning:

This is REALLYREALLYREALLY not a good movie to watch if you're at all squeamish. It's not a good movie to watch if you're just looking for standard horror fare. I'm trying to be 100% spoiler free, so I'll just say: if you read a spoiler review, you'll hear that there are definitely some body horror moments that are...unique to this film.

It's a revealing journey with quite a bit of gore.
I didn't sympathize enough with the wife. Her story seemed a little contrived and nonsensical- her grief echoes the madness of someone in a postpartum psychosis than a grieving mother.

There is genital mutilation, dying gutted animals, child abuse in foresight (the mother was forcing her child to wear his shoes on the wrong feet) etc. The sex isn't enjoyable for the viewers, the ""artistic"" scenes are just too much, and even when you get the meaning behind them, it's just not enjoyable. Seeing a fox eating it's own intestines, turn to the man and talk...that's just not enjoyable. Seeing a woman beat a man's penis, then jerk it off until it bleeds...not pleasant. There's nothing in this movie that's really redeemable as a horror movie at all.

This movie is clearly about being sucked into darkness and by being a rational being we collectively have the option to either stay in the darkness with the risk of being completely consumed by it or we can use the proper mental tools to find our way out of the darkness.
The Gainsborg character is an over the top example of being consumed by darkness hence the satanic stuff in the attic and the other satan related imagery. The Dafoe character has tools to not be consumed by the negative spaces the mind can go due to tragedy. Von Treir makes his character a therapist on purpose to show the difference between a person who is not in tune with their mind vs someone who is. They both lose their son but react differently based on their psychological models they live by. All of the violence is symbolic especially when she drills the hole in his leg and put a weight in so can't leave her. The body mutilation is obviously symbolic. The tripped out dream scenes are absolutely beautiful and very haunting. The way Von Trier uses hardly any music but creepy echoy stuff is masterful.

Yes very graphic unstimulated sex scene right in the beginning of this film and then more sex scenes which are not smutty but frantic , desperate , and seem like its morelike  a weird sick release for the Woman in the film . The Woman here is very much the sexual aggressor , that's for sure. Also the Woman seems fragile , lost and seemingly in need of the Man's stoic , educated guidance. Not really.
I read that some female critics labeled this film misogynistic - as a woman myself I didn't feel anything like that at all from this film - too many films portray women as always the victims , always the wonderful mama bear prototype (which has been  into the ground and frankly nauseating to me. ;if I wanted that ,I'd just watch Lifetime Channel movies) and always the Good One , or the sexy cocky little bimbo with daddy issues ... not here - this Woman is just a sick evil human being - Yes !  Women can be rotten , manipulative low down scum just because , no excuses , just a rotten person , period. This movie was a stark portrayal of wickedness that just so happened to come from a female. No I'm not offended at all , I'm more offended by condescending excuses for women's behavior in most films , which frankly is boring and tiresome. If we women are strong and liberated , ,then we should be able to accept a loathsome female character in a movie without getting our panties in a wad.",1455667200,2,1433,4.319702602230484
3781253,4,B001RVPOPW,"The blurb on the package says that this movie is no mere ""provocation,"" but it sure seems like one. Excellent acting and very beautiful photography are its strengths. Obscure occult symbolism and self-mutilation mostly involving female genitalia are its weaknesses. I can't help feeling that Lars von Trier took a very simple horror idea--the cabin in the woods--and draped it in the most exquisite cloakings.

It is a very effective horror film. Dafoe thinks their son's death triggered a breakdown in his wife, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg. While at the cabin in the woods, he realizes that his wife was crazy before the boy's death, that she may have been torturing their son, and that he's trapped in the middle of nowhere with a lunatic. What follows is graphic and brutal, but par for the course in any horror film.

The opening black-and-white shots, accompanied by an aria by Handel, are so beautiful and mysterious that their inchoate and indecipherable symbolism doesn't matter. You just sit back and enjoy it as visual art.

Those are the high points. But like I said, you can't help feeling that the movie is very pretentious with its labored symbolism and allusions to fine art paintings. The only clear pattern to me is that it begins with a chaste view of sexuality and ends with an act of genital self-mutilation that comes off as some kind of punishment for sexuality.

Is Anti-Christ a criticism of bourgeois decadence? Is Lars von Trier saying that the bourgeoisie believe that sexuality and materialism bring happiness but actually result in despair and disillusionment. Who knows? Because the movie's wrapped in such a tangled web of symbolism, I'm also inclined to ask Who cares?",1454198400,,1703,4.964912280701754

Second, the pacing. This is where the film suffers greatly. The film starts with a black and white scene that has been slowed down (not going to spoil for the people that want to see) the scene goes on forever. That wasn't a good sign.

The result is Antichrist: A spectacularly awful - yet beautifully filmed - train wreck of jumbled plot lines, conflicting messages, and a terribly confused cinematic identity. Am I art? Am I smut? Do I send a profound message about human nature that's so deep, even Adele couldn't roll in it? Or am I just a horror a movie with delusions of grandeur?

I guarantee that by the end of the film, the answer could not matter less to you.

But if you're looking to bring something different and edgy to movie night with your carefully diverse group of college liberal friends, you can't go wrong with Antichrist. In the ringing silence that follows the credits, take a drag of your herbal cigarette, stare off into the distance and say: ""I chose this film because I thought you all would appreciate it as the new masterwork representing the essential nihilism of human nature as it juxtaposes the man/woman motherhood/rape dichotomies.""

3781262,3,B001RVPOPW,"In case you don't know the basic plot for ANTICHRIST, here's a quick synopsis.  One wintery, snowy day, husband and wife HE (Willem Dafoe) and She (Charlotte Gainsbourgh) are making love, and hence don't notice that their young toddler has escaped his crib and climbs onto a table to look out their upper apartment window...only to slip and fall to his death.  Needless to say, this is a devastating event.  He (a therapist) decides the deeply depressed She needs to get away and he takes her to their cabin in the woods for some homegrown therapy.  Strange events and madness ensue.

I don't think I've spoiled much, because I've only touched on the first few minutes and haven't even tried to explain what watching this film is really like.  It's tough to review such a controversial and confrontational film, but let me try in 3 ways.

1)  As a story, the film is a bit of a failure.  The subject is immediately gripping, but the film doesn't really prove to be much about what happens as what is experienced.  The couple head to the woods and a series of events...perhaps supernatural, perhaps merely madness manifesting take place, resulting in the couple coming to a pretty severe crossroads in their relationship.  There is essentially no reason to see the film just to see how the story plays out.  There is, indeed, some graphic nudity and sex, but trust me...it is not enticing.  (Hell, by the end, it's quite off-putting!)

2)  Deeper meanings.  Here's where director and proficient provacateur Lars von Trier really really goes to work.  On the simplest level, the film could be about madness brought on by grief.  She is barely able to put one foot in front of the other because of grief, guilt and fear.  He either doesn't feel much grief, or puts on this therapist hat so that he can deal with his wife and not face the grief himself.  Either way, his seeming lack of empathy doesn't help She feel better, and her animosity towards her husband grows.  Everyone grieves in their own way, and when a couple isn't on the same page in how their grieve, the marriage is damaged or destroyed.  But this, to me, is only the surface lesson.

The film also seems to suggest that She is possibly evil.  Prior to the calamity, She  had been working on a thesis about how women have been portrayed as evil or Satanistic through the centuries.  She worked while in the cabin for a getaway with her son (HE did not come along, tellingly).  And she plastered the attic room with horrific images of women being tortured and killed for their evil natures.  But it appears She may have come to believe these images to be true.  She berates herself constantly for her guilt and evilness.  It could be that women are inherently evil, or that a SEXUAL woman is evil.  After all, their son died while she was enjoying sex.  And throughout the film, she occasionally practically rapes her husband, and these moments of brief physical release seem to be her only moments of relative control (not sanity, though.  Just harnessing her wildness.)  Have her studies and the events of her life rendered her convinced of the crazy notion that she is evil...or is she ACTUALLY evil, as VonTrier seems to hint.  We get ideas that she...may have been a little unhinged (especially about her son) prior to his death.  She seems to not only FEEL responsible but perhaps actually IS responsible for what happened.

3)  Visually, the film has some stunning moments.  There are some scenes of beautiful slow-motion, in particular the opening.  (I liked the slow-motion better in MELANCHOLIA, but it's nonetheless quite something here too.)  There are many alarmingly disturbing moments (consider yourself warned that there are moments where you must turn away from the images on screen).  The actors give strong, committed performances, especially Gainsbourgh, who is really quite something in this film.  VonTrier, the director, is pretty effective in working his audience over.  VonTrier the writer is perhaps just a little too proud of himself and sometimes wallows in imagery or metaphors that are a bit too heavy-handed.

I can only give the film, despite some strong elements, 3 stars because it is so deeply unpleasant to watch (overall) and because it is too clever by half.  I'm great with ""art films"" or ""indie films""...but VonTrier just tries too hard at times.  He's never yet done better than BREAKING THE WAVES...a movie with some humanity.  In the end, ANTICHRIST seems to hate both its main characters and we sort of do too...thus we are left with a film with no compassion towards the suffering parents.  Simply put, I didn't like that.

By the way, I watched the Criterion Blu-Ray.  The movie itself looks and sounds great.  The essay provided is thoughtful.  The bonus materials are a bit skimpy, given that this is a fairly recent film.  There are a few moderately interesting interviews with the two stars...but the little ""making of"" videos are brief and very surface-level.  We don't quite get the ""academic"" dive into the film that Criterion gives us in their best releases.",1439510400,21,5075,4.79123414071511
3781263,3,B001RVPOPW,"This film is about a man and woman who are struggling with grief over the loss of their son. The film is extremely dark in nature, as the two characters retreat to a remote cabin to try and deal with the grief. This journey into ""the heart of darkness"" leads to a shocking and deeply disturbing conclusion.

The movie boasts fabulous performances from its leads, and the cinematography is superb. However, I found myself frustrated by many of the scenes, which I found to be very contrived. I felt like the director didn't strive to tell truth in this film, but instead created a spectacle, that is meant to shock the audience.

3781267,4,B001RVPOPW,"Graphic, Violent and Sexually Explicit Content:
This film is unrated. A Danish production that wasn't commercially targeted to US audiences, this should not be a surprise. Anyone remotely familiar with Lars von Trier's overall work as a whole will also not be surprised that had it been submitted to the MPAA, it would have, without question, garnered an NC-17 rating. In general, Scandinavian films do not shy away from graphic or explicit content with very adult themes.

I don't consider this a perfect film, but it is an excellent exploration of very deep depression resulting from profound loss, unforgiving guilt and unremitting grief. Antichrist is not intended to be a ""feel good"" movie with a ""happy ending"" of human will and spirit prevailing triumphantly. Just the opposite. It can be classed in the ""horror"" genre but if you're expecting a ""slasher"" with blood spurting everywhere and gore galore flying about, seek out the George Romero zombie movies. You won't find it in this film. It's graphic, and explicitly so, with the combination of emotional and physical pain inflicted and suffered as a husband attempts to recover his wife and their relationship from the depths of her extreme guilt, grief and the resulting depression. The horror is their slow surreal spiral downward to a tragic ending. It's shockingly provocative. The audience is supposed to cringe at the physical pain and feel the extreme emotional pain.

Not a 5-star which I don't dish out much, but a solid 4+ stars. It delivers a very visceral insight into the abyss of extreme depression, and is the first in von Trier's unofficial Depression Trilogy, followed by Melancholia, the mildest of the three, and then a much more sexually explicit, provocative and quite lengthy, but less physically violent, Nymphomaniac.",1431907200,5,1801,5.122448979591836

3781290,4,B001RVPOPW,"Ive known about Antichrist for a few years now, and wasn't that interested in it at first, until someone mentioned a scene that made them as uneasy as whats known as the scene from Hard Candy. At the same time, that made me a little hesitant to watch it, since Hard Candys infamous scene is one of the only times Ive -ever- felt sick to my stomach while watching a movie. Going through my queue, I decided to finally give it a go (great for Thanksgiving viewing, right?) and came out with no bad feelings, aside from feeling like I watched a pretty good movie. That being said, this is definitely not a film for everyone. It starts out with a scene that is supposed to set the tone of a tragic event, but comes off as something so artsy that I sighed a few times. What follows is a movie thats entirely driven by two characters. Look, I love There Will Be Blood, but I can admit that the movie is boring as hell. Daniel Day-Lewis is the reason that movie works- because his performance as Daniel Plainview has you hooked. Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg don't do quite as well as him, although they put in the same amount of work making characters that kept me interested the whole time, even when I was exhausted and running on a little over 4 hours of sleep.

(The two characters in Antichrist are never named, so Ill just refer to them by the actors first names to make it a little easier, rather than calling them He and She.)

Willem and Charlottes child, Nic has died. He fell out the window of their apartment while they were in bed, and like any parents, they're having a hard time coping with the loss. Charlotte especially. She passes out at Nics funeral, only to regain full consciousness after a month. Willem is a therapist and is trying to help her with the pain, asking questions about everything, what she fears, etc. She seems to be avoiding everything by having sex with him whenever she can, and doesnt point out much of whats bothering her. She reveals that Willem was very distant to her and Nic the summer before everything happened, but Willem states that it was because they went to a cabin in the woods where she was going to finish her thesis, and figured she wanted time to herself to get it done. We discover that its this location that scares Charlotte, and has some significance to the tragedy in some way. She has a very difficult time even crossing the small bridge that leads to the cabin, and once there, things fall apart in ways Willem couldn't imagine.

Its hard to give a real plot summary because 70% of the movie is drawn out scenes of Willem and Charlotte talking about everything, arguing, or a lot of shots of scenery to set the mood. Again, if you aren't big on movies driven by the characters, and need something to be happening a lot, this probably isn't for you. The movie progresses from Charlottes depression to something that could be much bigger, if its what it appears to be. When Willem starts encountering very strange situations with animals, like a fox disemboweling itself, you have to wonder whats really going on. Additionally, this is one of those movies where nothing is spelled out for you, and message boards for it only contain theories as to what represents what, and who the Antichrist was. Normally Id be against this, because it usually feels like a cheap way to get past a plot hole. Here though, I liked it. They also did a great job with supernatural elements that don't feel forced in any way when Willem begins to investigate the cabin and we learn what Charlottes thesis was about.

As for the scenes involving sex and gore, theres plenty of sex scattered about with nothing that graphic apart from a few seconds in the beginning. Most of it is aggressive, with Willem not exactly being that into everything while Charlotte is doing it to numb some of the pain. Its the gore that happens after sex that will throw off some viewers, women especially (youll see what I mean when it happens). To tell you the truth, I didn't think anything here aside from that scene was excessive or very brutal. I also need to mention that the opening scene almost made me turn off the movie. Losing a child is the worst thing that could happen to any loving parent. I have two and cant imagine my mindset or life if anything happened to them. Even before I became a dad, scenes with very bad things happening to kids were never easy to watch. The opening for Antichrist, however, had me thinking oh no, is it one of those movies?. Its shot in slow motion, black and white, with classical music playing over Willem and Charlotte being passionate, and Nic making his way from tipped over crib to falling out the window. This scene feels so forced and out of place that I cant believe some people said it made Nics death even more powerful. This is the kind of scene that people make fun of, and think of, when they hear the words art film. I felt sad that the child died, but not as sad as I would have if it was shot like the rest of the film, which was more down to earth.

Antichrist is a movie Ill probably be watching again sometime in the near-future just to see what I can come up with regarding the plot. There are a lot of things to look out for, and Im pretty sure I saw a demonic face in one scene, and the face of an angel in the couples apartment when light hit a wall a certain way. Intentional or not, there are things to pay attention to that help you draw your own conclusion. All I have left to say is that its a shame neither actor was in the running for an Oscar, Golden Globe or Academy Award, aside from Charlotte winning Best Actress at Cannes. She definitely deserved it.",1417219200,2,5656,4.408612440191388

3781297,1,B001RVPOPW,"I always considered myself at least somewhat intellectual, definitely not stupid.  I have always enjoyed film, whether it be silly Hollywood blockbusters, twisted thrillers, clever sci-fi, a touching indie, a mesmerizing art-house, or cheesey horror movies.  I have enjoyed many ""so-called intellectual"" movies with all kinds of symbolism and the search for answers of the nuclear existential man. You know, all that ""high brow"" stuff that makes us feel important because we watched a movie.
I have been on a mission of late, to view ""the most disturbing films of all time"".  This title was mentioned many times in my search. So, I had to watch it!  This was not disturbing, but laughable.  It was like watching a really bad B-Movie that was filmed with A-Movie equipment.  Sure, it had some nice cinematography, but really?  Was there that much fantastic cinematography to make up for the boredom of the story?  Sure, the shots with the son and the window, and the tree thing was neat.  If I would have known better, I could have saved a lot of time and watched those two segments and said ""yep, that's perdy"".
The acting was fine, Defoe rarely disappoints, and this film was no different with his performance.  I can not excuse any of it's few attributes with the downright slow, senseless, boring story, and tempo. Taking us to the last 10 minutes of the film of over the top torture and violence.  ""Von Trier was breaking boundaries!!""  Ejaculating blood? Seen it, watch the ending of Nekromantik.  A three second clip of full non simulated sex?  Who cares, how important was that to the story? That I had to make sure I saw a penis enter a vagina to make sure I understood they were having intercourse? For shock value?  Shock? That is so sophomoric, anyone could come up with the idea of putting non simulated sex into a movie for shock value. That is one of the most taboo subjects in mainstream movies. That idea of utilizing it doesn't take a genius.
Then the ""cutting edge"" torture scene.  Just way over the top and done so in a way it just came off as pretentious and cheesy.  This whole film comes off as a pretentious steaming pile of schlock.
 ""A Serbian Film"" was shocking. Far more entertaining, and well shot. With an atmosphere to it where you didn't want to take a nap.  You want disturbing?  Watch ""Funny Games"" from 1997, and you'll see that you don't need gore and graphic torture to chill you to the bone.
I just don't understand how these A-List actors are waiting in line to be signed up to get paid $1.50 an hour just to have the honor of being in one of Von Trier's films.
I really don't rant about movies, I rarely write bad reviews, but I felt insulted by this movie.  Maybe I'm getting too old.  Maybe I'm eating too many GMOs and it's killing my brain cells for deep thought.  What I do know is that Von Trier is no where close in the ranks of Kubrick, Tarantino, Hitchcock, Argento, Gilliam, Jarmusch, Scorsese, Cohen, or Lynch.",1410739200,9,2960,4.596190476190476

3781304,4,B001RVPOPW,"This film is not a very great film, even if it is very well done. It is the story of a couple with an important age difference, a professor and a doctorate student with a young child, a toddler actually. One night when they make hectic love in the bathroom, on the washing machine, in the living room, etc, the child wakes up and they do not hear the call in the baby surveillance unit that might not have been on. He gets out of his bed, through the baby gate, sees his parents, goes back to his room, pushes a chair to the table, climbs on the chair, then on the table, then on the window ledge because the window is open. There is snow there because it is snowing. He slips and falls. The film is the story of the mother's subsequent depression treated by her husband who is supposed to be a head shrink.

This is the fundamental mistake. A psycho-therapy cannot be performed by a person directly connected to the patient: members of the family and above all sexual partners. He knows that because he tries to cut sex off, but he cannot resist to her neurosis or psychosis that is taking hold of her and forces sex onto him as a poison for herself.

The second mistake is to isolate with her in a mountain cabin far from everything and any communication line. He broke there the normal procedure in which the relation doctor-patient has to remain within the frame of a socially situated and defined setting, method, process, with help within easy reach.

These two mistakes become dramatic when he discovers the mother had systematically and probably for a long time put the shoes left side right on the feet of the baby. He knew something was wrong because of the autopsy performed on the child that noted a deformity in the feet, which could explain the accident on the window ledge. You add that deformity to the fact that the window was open and rather easily reachable and you have a criminal scenario, maybe unconscious but definitely from a criminal mind. The man finds confirmation of this ""torturing"" with pictures of the child on which the shoes are always right side left. He finds these pictures in their isolation, and then this guilt gets into her head and she becomes convinced she has to do something to purge it.

The doctor and husband should have known that she was to come to this breaking point for various reasons:
1- The torturing reveals she wanted to make the child suffer and hence felt guilty about the birth and presence of the child, hence about having sex with the older professor.
2- The fact that they were making love when the child ""committed suicide"" makes her responsible at first (""it's my fault"" she says at the beginning) and her guilt getting bigger she will shift this guilt from her to him who forced her to have sex when the child was in danger.
3- Her desire to have rough sex, even hurtful sex at the end shows that she considers sex coming from him is and has to be a violent process, that she has been forced into it, that she was raped, and that explained how and why she tortured the child.
4- Then she will have to torture him and eventually kill him to alleviate her own guilt, and that will be justice for her since he is the ""bastard.""

The whole story is wrapped up in some kind of myth. The myth of the three beggars, represented by a fox, a deer (that has to be a doe) and a bird of prey. When the three beggars come together someone has to die. She tells him about the myth. And in his own torture (she has screwed up a sharpening stone into his left leg to prevent him from escaping and also with a very obvious sexual innuendo: to sterilize him, to make him impotent without castrating him) he sees visions and he finally sees her lying with the fox, the deer and the bird of prey, and he knows she will kill him. So by some miraculous turn of the screw in the story he recuperates the wrench she had hidden under the cabin (suspend you disbelief one minute) and in spite of her trying to stop him he manages to get the sharpening stone off his leg and he strangles her, then burns the body (to prevent her being scavenged by animals of prey, shall we say). His escape becomes a futuristic vision that has little value: the myth of the resurrection of the hundreds if not thousands of dead bodies buried in the forest and they come from behind him alive and rejuvenated and overtake him and we can then wonder if he is still alive or if he has joined the resuscitated crowd, whose resurrection was called by the killing of the curse of the three beggars.

The film though is a tragedy brought by some insidious torturing of a child by his own mother, and then by the absolutely absurd and unprofessional decision of the father and husband to take over the psychological treatment of his wife himself, which is totally forbidden by all codes of behavior and action in the psychiatric profession.

Lars von Trier decision to make his characters make these mistakes is of course the fruit of his own twisted mind that tortures his characters probably because he does not have the courage to do it for real in his own life. The film must have a cathartic dimension for him. But the film has not cathartic dimension for the audience because we would never, for those who are doctors in a way or another, do this mistake. It becomes then a warning, a road sign saying: ""ROAD TO HELL"" and you better know you must not take it.

3781309,3,B001RVPOPW,"Spoilers.  I always have a difficult time evaluating a film made by Lars von Trier.  I'm convinced he's always messing with the audience and especially the critics.  Not even getting past the title, he's pissing people off.  And chuckling, I suspect.  In this wildly controversial film, we get sucked in from the opening shot.

Characters named only He (Willem Dafoe) and She (Charlotte Gainsbourg) are going to town in the sack.  Von Trier leaves nothing to the imagination, so that gets your attention.  It becomes unnerving as the camera moves toward their 2 year old son Nic, in another room.  He's climbing out of his crib and toward an open window as he watches snow fall from 4 stories up.  This is all shot in black and white at this point and in super slow motion.  Technically it's beautiful.  Story wise, it's horrific.

The parents must deal with the unthinkable death of a child and the actors make it extremely difficult to watch.  She in particular, struggles with the guilt, collapses at the funeral and is hospitalized.  He is a practicing psychotherapist.  They agree that He will guide his wife through the various stages of grief.  This ultimately leads them to their remote cabin in the woods where She and Nic had gone for a couple weeks earlier.  She was researching a paper based on witches and the evil of women throughout history.  But she never finished the project.

She devolves into paranoia, trance-like stages and eventually lashes out at her husband.  She insists on having sex often which He rejects, as he wants to keep the professional element of their relationship intact.  But he's a man and occasionally slips.  None of this is particularly erotic, even though they both spend a lot of time in their birthday suits, inside and outside the cabin.  Von Lier tosses in a trio of odd forest creatures for good measure.  A deer, a crow and a talking fox.  Perhaps the most cringe-worthy scene I had ever seen in a mainstream film was in ""In the Realm of the Senses.""  This movie takes over first place with genital mutilation of both sexes.  And yes, it is very explicit.  Big ouchies.

Again, I'm not sure what von Trier is up to or trying to prove.  Maybe that he can make his own style of torture porn or slasher films and still get recognized at Cannes where he was nominated and Gainsbourg won for best actress.  While I appreciate the technical artistry at work here, I struggle with the film as a whole.  But like every von Trier movie I've ever seen, I won't forget it.  Maybe that's his angle.

I watched this film on a Criterion Blu ray and as usual it is pristine.  Here are comments included in the 28 page booklet that comes with the package: ""The film was shot in 4K resolution with the RED One Digital Camera; in addition, the Phantom HD camera was used for the high-speed sequences. The entire production was completed in a fully digital workflow. Postproduction and color timing were done using Assimilate's SCRATCH and Nucoda's Film Master systems. The final color-corrected DPX files were output to Rec. 709 high-definition color space for Blu-ray and DVD release.
Digital color timing: Stefan Ciupek, Dirk Meier/Nordic Film Lab, Copenhagen.
Supervised by: Anthony Dod Mantle; Peter Hjorth/Nordic Film Lab, Copenhagen.""  I could not see any visual anomalies in the transfer which comes with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and in 1080p.  The black and white sections that open and close the movie look excellent.  In the color section of the film, there is a deliberate toning down on the hue.  It all works.

There is only one audio track and it's a good one.  DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 comes in English but does have English SDH subtitles.  No others are available.  Here is a comment from Criterion captured from the booklet: ""The 5.1 surround soundtrack is identical to the theatrical mix. It was remastered at 24-bit from the original digital audio master files using Pro Tools HD.""  The only thing of significance I noticed from the surrounds was the excellent musical enhancements.  Specifically, music from Handel's opera ""Rinaldo.""  Here are the extras:

*Video interviews with von Trier and actors Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg.
*A collection of video pieces delving into the production of Antichrist, including interviews with von Trier and key members of his filmmaking team as well as behind-the-scenes footage.

3781312,5,B001RVPOPW,"Nine Things about the Movie Antichrist [Denmark, 2009]

1. This is the first film in director Lars von Triers remarkable Depression Trilogy. I had to watch it twice to really start unpacking it enough so that I could start writing my thoughts about it.

2. Its not really about the Anti-Christ. At least, not as most people think of it.

3. The Prologue is one of the most gorgeously tragic, sexually explicit, opening sequences in film history.

4. Its about a therapist and his wife whose child has died. The wife is undergoing extreme grief over the loss, and her husband tries to help her by taking her to a secluded cabin in the woods. Once they get to the cabin, he starts getting visions of things like foxes eating themselves. She thinks the ground burns her feet. It just gets worse from there.

5. The cinematography is entrancing, trippy, and gorgeous. The soundtrack is surreal and disconcerting.

6. Nick is the only named character in the movie, and hes dead five minutes into the film. The husband and wife (played by Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsborg) are never given names. In fact, every other person in the movie actually has their faces blurred out.

7. This film is an examination of many things - death, grief, internalized misogyny, the evil of human nature, and the meaninglessness of everything. It requires a lot of reflection to make sense of whats actually going on. Von Trier does not make easy movies.

8. This movie was quite controversial when it was made because of its extreme sexual imagery and violence. A few scenes were filmed with porn stars taking the place of the main actors.

9. This movie is definitely not for everyone. Its a difficult, brave, important, psychosexual nuclear bomb. Its not a horror film, but it uses horror movie conventions to make the point that the real horror is life itself and maybe our own souls.",1402531200,4,1868,4.705521472392638

3781317,4,B001RVPOPW,"A brutally dark, intensely and weirdly and unnervingly erotic, AMAZING art house film brimming with an admixture of visual splendor and vile imagery.  This is easily among the most provocatively messed up movies I've ever seen.

Lars von Trier (Nymphomaniac, Melancholia) sets a powerful mood in this visually stunning film straight from the opera-scored opening slow-motion sequence of a sex scene complete with pornographic penetration in the first 60 seconds.  I know, I just mentioned penetration.  But just trust me right out of the gates that this shot, however controversial or shocking, fits the scene perfectly like an artistic puzzle piece that has a significant story to tell.  Whereas there is something ominous to be feared for sure, the scene is more a splendor to the eyes than a 1990s French noir perfume commercial--you know, the commercials that are so ""out there"" that you never knew what they were advertizing until they told you at the end.  Some call this high art, others pornographic and provocative.

This film strikes me as a challenge.  We only ever see three actors, one of which is the child who dies in the opening sequence.  As husband (""He"") and wife (""She""), Willem Dafoe (Nymphomaniac) and Charlotte Gainsbourg  (Nymphomaniac, Melancholia, 21 Grams) carry every scene as nameless characters enduring the loss of their child, who died while they were having sex.  He is an over-involved psychoanalyst (playing more the role of therapist than husband) attempting to guide her through her grief, which she serially transmutes into sexual fixation.  In an effort to force her to properly grieve and face her mounting irrational fears he takes her to a secluded cabin in the woods, where the sexuality, tension and violence escalateoften, in fact, TOGETHER!

Great acting, great film!  As past tragedy begets the tragedy of their present, the Biblical symbolism rains down hard on these actors' positively fearless journey venturing to dark places most actors wouldn't dare.

Strikingly sublime imagery stimulates us as we endure often unsettling profound emotions.  The raw visceral nature of their surroundings parallels her ravaged, desperate psyche.  The more he tries to deconstruct her mental torment, the more she in turn tries to disarticulate their sexuality.

This is easily among the most provocatively messed up movies I've ever seen.  Full frontal nudity, masturbation, sexual penetration, animal birth, violent sex scenes, violence against animals, violence against women, torture and genital mutilation are sprinkled about in this controversial (but far from conventionally exploitative) artistic endeavor.  So, while I encourage adventurous cinephiles to accept the challenge of seeing this film to its end, let's just not make a family night of it and DEFINITELY don't watch it on a first date.",1399766400,5,2840,5.325112107623318

Therefore I could recommend this film only to those 3 out of 100 who would agree with me that these images exist in the film not for their shock value but because they are necessary for an understanding of what these characters encounter under the influence of the dark side of Nature. Unless the viewer is compelled to watch, he or she cannot understand the pain (or the madness). Other than that, there is an extraordinary similarity here (in visuals other than the shocking ones alluded to above) in the director's observations of nature and those of Sartre in his fiction, a theme clearly enunciated in one of von Trier's other films ""Melancholia"". Whether or not the filmmaker is an ""existentialist"" or, from a different perspective, a Gnostic, it seems clear in ""Antichrist"" and ""Melancholia"" that von Trier is coming to the same conclusions about the Human Condition as the adherents of those philosophies. And for those of us who have come to those same conclusions, whether existentialist, Gnostic or otherwise, it is somehow comforting to know that we are not alone. On a less weighty note, it has to be said that Charlotte Gainsbourg has an extraordinary amount of courage",1396915200,3,1434,4.763052208835341

3781327,2,B001RVPOPW,"I was hoping for something visual, moody, with some life drama happening that I could give my own meaning to. That was necessary for his movie Melancholia (which I love for therapy when melancholy), and after three viewings at times when I was kind of melancholy I created a meaning I liked to accompany my mood.
  So for this story, I watched with wonder looking for suffering, fear, resentment, mistakes, growth and the lessons to be won and honest reflection to be provoked with the experience. I saw some of those things. Mixed with I guess delusions manifested and believed by the characters (Total rapid mental breakdown and its effect on those in your immediate vicinity when civilization is not used for its intended purpose)...  I have no more to say other than it was many unique sets of the Lars visual style with a expected sexual and violence element for those in a desperate self destructive place... and for that this was ok if a little silly or maybe amateur technically, mixed with moments of talented beauty. Very confused.

Antichrist is a dive into anxiety, fear, insanity and how nature/women encompass or project all of this. As with all his films, this one is a projection of von Trier's own demons.

There are a couple story elements that are over-the-top violent even by my standards but they have their place in this portrayal of hell. If you're a film lover, I'd highly recommend this. However it's definitely not something for the casual movie-going audience.",1388275200,4,665,4.981981981981982

The heavy reliance on the watchable qualities of the actors' performances and extended slow-motion doesn't hide the feeling that the characters are missing important ingredients in this very complex statement. I think it could have been an unqualified work of genius had it been fleshed-out better - instead, it's a bit of a mess.

Violence is an expensive gesture in art - you'd better get the math right if you want the audience on your side. When you add epic themes to violence (infant death, sexuality, psychological abuse, murder) and fail to make your audience aware of your point, you've... well, failed somewhere. You can't hide behind artistic license forever, particularly if you want to communicate. Some of the audience will always give you an 'A' for effort because you've attempted something difficult and made them feel.

The opening scene would lead one to think this movie was going to live up to the hype but it didn't. People called this the film ""you can't unwatch.""  But this film was indeed very, very forgettable.

The storyline was good and had so much potential but I was hoping for a shocking, disturbing, jaw dropping and scary movie and it didn't deliver. Was this film a censored version? I dunno. It had only two mutilation scenes, the ankle scene and her who-ha part. Was there supposed to be more than that?

As for the sex scenes, with the exception of the opening scene, I've seen more graphic sex scenes in romantic comedies. Not that we'd really want to see willem dafoe's late 50's body in too much detail anyway but that's what I was wanting to see!

If you want to see people get brutally and mercilessly hacked and butchered and killed in other creative ways, look at other titles. This was boring and the 70's style special effects didn't do much to captivate my interest. Plus it was a little too sci-fi for my tastes.

This didn't even show the toddler's brains splattering on the pavement or anything. It just faded to white. One poster wrote they had to keep pausing the movie to breath so they wouldn't vomit. Oh puhlease! I really don't know what everybody's going on about.  Yaaaawwn.",1377475200,6,1374,4.493975903614458
3781338,1,B001RVPOPW,"All the questions about the meaning of the title and of the film itself are pointless and needlessly dignify this ugly piece of pretentious garbage.  Trier obviously has no idea of spiritual matters, and notions like the antichrist are complete mysteries to him - like love of any kind beyond the groping and grunting of mere sex.  He also apparently has no understanding of human relationships or even what it means to be human.  Based on this film and MELANCHOLIA (which is much better but still quite bad), I get the impression that Trier is in a permanent state of depression which he wants to share with his viewers.  I will not waste time detailing the irony of the ""Chaos reigns"" theme in a film which goes out of its way to appear structured.  ANTICHRIST raises many questions, especially for those who are able to take it seriously, but the greatest question is a practical one: ""Where did all that $11,000,000 of its estimated production costs go?""  Dafoe and Gainsbourg are virtually the only actors in the film, and the whole thing was shot in what appears to be one location. Trier's backers must be steaming -- let's hope they are more cautious in the future.  The only positive thing I can say about ANTICHRIST is the DVD was a gift, so I did not waste any of my own money on it.",1375747200,9,1294,4.527896995708154

3781346,5,B001RVPOPW,"When trying to explain the film 'Antichrist' to people who have never seen it. It may be best to leave out the parts about the testicle crushing or vaginal self mutilation. Lars Von Trier, the madman filmmaker from Denmark who brought us such feel good films like 'Dancer In The Dark' and 'Breaking The Waves', takes us on a dark and tragic journey into the human soul and leaves us all rattled.

Lars begins the film with Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg making wet and wild love while their sweet young son falls out of their apartment window and dies. Already the film goes into depressing mode and it never lightens up. After the funeral we see Charlotte's unnamed character going through the grief while Willem's character (also unnamed), a therapist, tries everything he can to comfort her. Soon it becomes clear that nothing is helping and he decides to take his wife to their cabin deep in the woods, a place called Eden. Some therapy exercises later and it would seem that Charlotte's character is slowly coming to terms with her child's death and that is when Von Trier unleashes his darkness once again and all hell breaks loose.

'Antichrist' is a film best watched with an open mind.. a very open mind. I must say though I am biased to liking this film because I am a big fan of Von Trier films. This Criterion Blu-Ray release looks sharp and utterly beautiful, but I wouldn't expect nothing less from the esteemed label.

Right from the beginning when we see a child falling from a window in slow motion with black and white graphics (and opera music playing in the background giving viewers the illusion that it's somehow a beautiful moment) that gives us a PERFECT introduction at just how confusing this movie is going to be.  I figure this scene is so weirdly expressed because the writers wanted to give us a fresh spin on a deathly scene.  They've succeeded, but it turns out the *rest* of the movie is not so successful.

The storyline is about the mother trying to cope with her sons death so she moves to a cabin in the woods with her therapist husband.  For about 80% of the film, we witness the woman either going through traumatic experiences related to her sons death that the therapist/husband is always there to help her cope with, or we see several uninteresting therapy sessions between the two of them unrelated to the main subject of the movie.  The problem is that virtually nothing makes a lick of dog on sense.  The therapy advice for helping the woman falls flat and never makes any sense to us, the viewers.  Basically I was watching the movie for the purpose of just seeing how this storyline is going to wrap up.

I strongly believe an actual therapist must have written this storyline so really they're the only people who can understand the techniques used to help someone.  For the rest of us with no college degrees in therapy, we're left scratching our heads.  This movie is clearly intended for the deep thinkers of therapy.  Even the scenes where the message wasn't clear to the woman so she either gets confused or questions it seems to confirm how difficult it is for therapists to get their advice through to people.  Clearly written from a therapists point of view.

It gets worse I'm afraid.  The therapy advice turns insane, basically.  Acorns falling in slow motion from above, the woman blending into the ground and becoming green like the grass due to a deep level of concentration and envisioning it, stumbling upon a deer that runs away in slow motion and the worst one of all- in one segment an animal actually *speaks*.  Speaks English words!  Apparently the therapist is just as crazy as the woman!  Easily the most confusing segments of all but luckily these are the only REALLY bizarre ones.

However the final 20 minutes are pretty good.  I won't spoil the events but the action picks up considerably.  Of course we don't know WHY exactly these things are happening.  We don't know why the storyline abruptly changes from coping to the death of a son to figuring out whether women have been heartless and evil for centuries.  We can only assume the woman was either secretly a psychopath all along, or the death of her son made her that way.  Add some REALLY intense sexual scenes and you have a bundle of nonstop confusion.

Although the film does not supply any easy answers, in order to get meaning from it I think the film requires a certain amount of knowledge about a variety of subjects, including mythology, feminism, psychology, and European religious history. I find it to be both a very disturbing and powerful film. At times beautiful, and others gruesome. A battle between the Apollonian and Dionysian principles.

3781360,5,B001RVPOPW,"Was hesitant about this film because didn't want another shock-jockeying ""new art"" sort of experience... but luckily, Antichrist was everything I could have hoped for. It was harshly beautiful and sharply real, with even better cinematography than I experienced in Lars von Trier's newer film, Melancholia. I'd never realized such vividness could be captured by camera, and it was all done with the organic simplicity of nature.

However splendid the cinematography, it would have been nothing to behold without Dafoe and Gainsbourg as the leads. They brought such a level of intimate expression and painfully lifelike storytelling, there was scarcely a moment I wasn't firmly glued next to them. Their performances guide you down a winding, deepening roller-coaster that both terrifies you and fills you with toe-curling anticipation.

The sound was no exception to this sensual joyride either. There were moments that were breathtakingly beautiful and whisked you into a euphoric state of mind, then the next moment wrenched your gut through your diaphragm.

If you don't mind a darker, very cerebral movie that sends you into complex yet organic moments of bright anticipation and understanding, as well as horror, dread, and depression, then you should definitely sit through this near flawless masterpiece.",1350518400,3,1311,5.448275862068965
3781361,1,B001RVPOPW,"I suppose the value in this movie lies in the extent to which the viewer can hook into the 'gothic vibe' it seeks to portray. I couldn't.

If you are going to take the audience on a grisly ride into the world of sex-torture and insanity... you had better get them invested first. If a comedian is going to tell edgy jokes, he'd better be likeable. Losing sympathy is a dangerous game when you have to tell stories to people and hold their interest.

This film doesnt do the small stuff well... it is visually appealing in a way that conveys no deeper meaning, other than 'shock and awe cruelty of a hate-filled universe' type stuff. Since he doesn't really know how to create interest on a small scale in any of the characters or situations, you get the feeling that the heady intensity of its shock-scenes is the only juice the film has. Aside from a few beautiful visuals, grizzly sex torture is the heart and soul of this film. What? You seem surprised. If a film has no small-scale character development, then grizzly climaxes are all it can offer. Thats this.

Lars von Trier does self-serious European gothic with an cinematic art-house WOW factor. The human element is weak, weak, dishwater weak. If you cant connect to human beings, its hard to tell a story that has any meaning. Meaning is an inside job - not something cured by any deliberate string pulling. Thats what shines through here...

Dont take my word for it, try the movie for yourself. But switch it off if you are not affected by it in a way, otherwise you will be forced to watch vivid sex-torture scenes. Its the worst graphic stuff I've seen, so be prepared.",1347062400,19,1634,4.5288135593220336

3781363,1,B001RVPOPW,"It is hard to know what to say about this movie--or movies of this type in general.  By  this I mean:  beautiful-looking, well-made movies that contain very controversial content which by its nature polarizes audiences.  That either love it or hate it thing.  In the very least this movie ignites again the argument about art, and then people get all defensive trying to defend the meaning or intent of the movie, its artistic value, the performances.

This movie is visually interesting, at times starkly beautiful.  The music chose to score the film is also lovely, and tends to throw the content into even greater relief because of the juxtaposition of beauty and violence, for example.

But mainly I just thought the movie was plain boring and contrived, and not very original.  I never see films or books or any sort of art as Truth (with a capital T)--as though any person could have such a privileged perspective.  Art is more about an expression of personal ""truth""--the truth being a product of who we are in our place and time in culture.  That we are in a sort of decadent, jaded phase is pretty clear to me.  This movie just cements that fact.  In movies that are as heavily laden with imagery and metaphor as this one--none of it all that original if you think about it for a moment--you are kind of bamboozled into thinking that you are seeing something profound.  Particularly if you throw in some genitalia and sexual violence, in the presumption that we are diving into profound truths of the human condition, everyone seems to be in such awe.  It prevents people from seeing, for lack of better words, that the emperor doesn't really have clothes.

By this I mean it's all been done before; themes of guilt, misogyny, sex/death, not to mention the rather cliched psychology.  But maybe it hasn't been as well-crafted as this film, or quite as explicit.  I'm not quite sure why this director has to be so extreme, it kind of hints at an adolescent personality who still needs to break the rules in order to feel naughty and special.

I suppose as I get older, I realize that I don't want to waste my time on ""art"" that reduces us to our supposedly basest natures.  I work with very small children and having observed them closely, I believe we are born quite innocent and full of potential--NOT in sin--and our lives are twisted by how we are raised--both in the physical and psychological environments.  I thought I'd give this film a try because I generally like the work of Willem dafoe, and I did like ""Breaking the Waves,"" though the ultimate premise of the movie was pretty unbelievable (again, if you think about it).

I'm sort of tired, I suppose, by films that propose the worst about us.  That somehow it is more true and profound than what is the best about us.  I personally find the daily struggle just to find meaning in the day and keep a roof over one's head sufficiently compelling to be a proper subject of ART.  So ultimately, this visually arresting and provocative film seems simply to me the self-indulgent kind of hysterical musing of a rather psychologically immature man.

3781371,4,B001RVPOPW,"4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece

""Antichrist"" is a very graphic analogy to Adam & Eve. A story about the misogyny of religion, in this case, Christianity, & how it can effect the female psyche to commit atrocious acts of self mutilation to her person, & in this case, her male spouse too.

 A study on how a woman can be driven to enormous extremes over the fear of losing her mate, thusly, she'll stop at nothing to keep him.

A study of superstition vs. rational psychology. How rational psychology can fail to recognize & treat the deeply disturbed female individual, who is lost to the world of man & his tool, religion, to create guilt, fear, & thusly, control over woman. Here it flagrantly backfires like the wrath of god on all those who have sinned in his presence before the golden calf.

""Antichrist"" definitely pushes the envelope of what a traditional, or in this case, a non traditional horror film can get a way with. It turns the traditional horror film inside out, with an orgy of graphically sadistic, sexual scenes, & masochistic mutilation. Not since Bob Guccione's, ""Caligula,"" (and a few Italian cannibal films around the early 80's) have I seen such graphic, violent sexual mutilation, though I'm sure there has been some films in between, I have not seen them, especially with a star of William Dafoe's stature. This is a film that draws one in to it's slow, but deliberately paced portrait of depravity. It's like a horrendous car accident, you don't want to look, but can't help it.

Kudos has to go to William Dafoe to take on such a role! The role of husband, father, but clinical unemotional therapist first, administrating to his wife's mental condition. Then again, he is a actor who has always taken chances, & never shied away from controversial roles. Equal kudoshas to go to Charlotte Gainsbourg, as the deeply disturb wife & mother of a baby son, whose death she blames herself for, which may be not far away from the truth. Director Lars von Trier could be accused of over the top sexual & violent sensationalism, if this film did not run as deep as the human question of self understanding it's self. Here he has weaved a hugely disturbing ugly spectacle of the real & surreal, with some startlingly beautiful, & starkly dark, cinematography.

""Antichrist"" is not a film that people will flock back to for replay value, other than to further analyze what it all means. This is not a film for the timid or weak of heart. It is a violently ugly document, of the darkest recesses of the female condition, & the blatantly neglect of that condition by the man who claims to love her the most.

I rate this film 4 1/2 stars, not for it's accessibility, but it's unnerving, unflinching portrait of depravity, which many will find inaccessibly ugly.",1335312000,2,2779,4.680327868852459
3781372,1,B001RVPOPW,"So when I saw this on the Criterion Collection I was pretty pumped because I've come to associate the good ol' CC with some pretty solid skin flicks. When the lady and I are thinking of getting down to business we like to pop in some of these to get ourselves in the mood, because we're some high class people and like that artsy stuff. I've always been a fan of Willem Dafoe and figure he could teach me a thing or two about gettin' stuff done. So when I saw Antichrist pop up and saw that people were describing it as ""erotic"" I figured where could we go wrong?

Boy oh boy was that a mistake! This movie didn't put the lady and I in the mood for intimate times, and we ended up turning to our old friend and therapist Mr. Sam Adams to console us. After this we needed a cool shower and some Secret Life of the American Teenager. At least the kids in that don't get down for mutilation.

Let's just say there's some pretty gnarly stuff that would make any guy's pasta look like cooked spaghetti, and I couldn't really imagine how my lady felt. Y'know, I can't really think of any redeeming qualities of this movie at all and it's not just because of the crazy couple stuff that goes on.

In Lars von Trier's psychological drama-cum-horror film, ""Antichrist,"" the two main characters - allegorically named He (Willem Dafoe) and She (Charlotte Gainsbourg) - are forced to endure the single greatest tragedy any married couple could ever face: the loss of a child.  While the two of them are having passionate sex, their toddler son manages to make his way to an unsecured upper-story window, falling to his death on the snow-covered street below.

Of the two, She seems the more devastated by the loss, falling into a state of near- physical and emotional collapse as she attempts to come to terms with the unthinkable.  Paralyzed by grief and fear and burdened by the weight of her own guilt, She begins a downward spiral into a bleak, all-encompassing depression that is perfectly natural and understandable given the circumstances, but also worrying and alarming at the same time.  Out of concern for his wife, He immediately slips into his role as professional therapist, talking She through her various stages of grief as if she were one of his patients.  Or is this merely He's way of coping with - or perhaps NOT coping with - his own grieving process, a way of making himself an objective observer of, rather than active participant in, the couple's shared tragedy?  After all, at one point, She directly accuses He of being both physically and emotionally distant from her and their son while the boy was still alive.  So why should he be any different now?

But all this is mere prelude to the second half of the film, which evolves into an intensely disturbing horror movie, revealing dark aspects of She's psyche that apparently existed long before the death of the child and are now using that event as a means of asserting their preeminence.  The couple retreats to a creepy, solitary cabin in the woods, where He believes he will force She to confront her greatest fears as the first step in the long process of healing she so desperately needs.  But He soon discovers that all his years of study and practice as a therapist may not be enough to protect him from the terrifying realities of his wife's mental condition, which has become weirdly and dangerously obsessed with Woman's role as both submissive partner and dominator of Man throughout the course of history (hence the generic pronouns for names).  On a thematic level, the movie is really about women finally asserting themselves after millennia of suppression by men, while at the same time acknowledging the many ways in which women have learned to manipulate men - primarily through sex - to ensure their own survival.  In fact, that He smugly and naively believes he has anything to ""teach"" She is the cosmic joke that exists at the core of the story.

In the allegorical world Von Trier has created here, Woman has become a demon - i.e., the Antichrist - a figure like Eve or Pandora upon which Man can thrust blame for his own inadequacies and sins, thereby absolving himself of guilt for the injustices he commits and the temptations he falls prey to.

Since sex is viewed here largely as a weapon used by both sides in the epic war between genders, Von Trier doesn't shy away from showing us some pretty raw footage of the couple's more amorous moments.  And indeed the close-ups of copulation, genital mutilation and human-on-human savagery can be a bit tough to take at times.

Von Trier's intensely personal style gives the work a haunting, dream-like quality at times, so much so that even the somewhat overworked symbolism - connecting birth with falling and even death - becomes an acceptable part of the surrealistic fabric.  In fact, the whole thing plays like a dream - or nightmare if you prefer - even in its more ""realistic"" moments.  And since the ""evil"" inherent in nature is also a major subject of the film, Von Trier makes the setting an integral part of the drama.

There's no denying that ""Antichrist"" is certainly not for the prudish or the faint of heart.  But the intense, insightful and, above all, brave performances by the two lead actors, along with the artistry of the filmmaking, make it a fascinating experience for the viewer looking for something a bit more cutting-edge and challenging than the average fare.",1318896000,2,4244,4.810178817056396

3781386,5,B001RVPOPW,"I first saw ""Antichrist"" shortly after its American release, and I have now seen this film three times.  I'm sorry that so many other Amazon reviewers of this DVD were unable to enjoy the film, having deemed it to be gory, pornographic and slow.  Although the many bad reviews of this DVD are understandable, as this is a polarizing film, one that provokes extreme reactions.  Yes, it is a difficult picture to watch, because it so graphically confronts the contradictions of life in regard to nature, the nature of women, superstition, the dubious goodness of humanity (the Danish newspaper ""Politiken"" referred to the film as ""a profoundly serious, very personal ..... piece of art about small things like sorrow, death, sex and the meaninglessness of everything."").  ""Antichrist"" is not strictly a horror film, although it is a frightening picture, and is ""horror-influenced"".  It is a psychological excavation of horror, and it is horrific, as well as transcendent, in its harsh, brutal depiction of the mystery of madness, in all of its enigmatic facets and manifestations.  ""Antichrist"" was dedicated to Andrei Tarkovsky; like Tarkovsky, Von Trier dwells on images, he meditates upon them, so that the scenes of this film not only resonate, but indeed vibrate.  ""Antichrist"" was made in ""real time"" and the intimacy between ""He"" (Willem Dafoe) and ""She"" (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is heavy and occasionally suspenseful.  It is a picture whose roles could only have been taken on by the bravest of actors.  In Chapter 15 of this DVD, ""She"" says, ""Women do not control their own bodies.  Nature does"".  And it is this truth, with all of its implications and complications, that is too scary for ""She"" to face, thus leading to her downward spiral.

As another Amazon accurately noted, ""Von Trier has studied his Lynch"" (as in David Lynch, I presume).  Like Lynch, Von Trier has a fascination with the animistic spirits within the merciless, malevolent woods.  Unlike Lynch, Von Trier explores that theme with practically no humour.  Which makes Von Trier's animistic world, especially as it is presented in ""Antichrist"", even scarier and stranger.  It is via the sublime presentation of nature (""Eden"") wherein this film excels; the shot of ""She"" disappearing into the green, becoming green (she is absorbed into the irrationality of nature); the dream-like shot where ""She"" crosses the bridge over the moonlit creek (as if she's sleepwalking and crossing over into her madness); the dead tree with its menacing looking branches, which ""She"" refers to as having its ""strange kind of personality"".  The ""Three Beggars""--Pain, Grief, Despair (the crow, deer and fox) -- represent the grossness and the violence of nature; nature's law of amoral retribution.  The ominous background music punctuates the entire picture with a spine-tingling, hair-raising quality, and the images of the witches in the attic of the cabin, where ""He"" and ""She"" go through their experience together, are nightmarishly apropos.

As for the supplemental material included on DVD Two, it is mostly compelling.  I especially enjoyed the French language interview with Charlotte Gainsbourg; the interviews with Willem Dafoe are also revealing.  ""The Making of Antichrist"" provides insight into the creative processes utilized for manifesting the various effects that contributed to the film's audio-visual tone.  Finally--film director John Waters praised ""Antichrist"" ""as being one of the ten best films of 2009"" in Artforum Magazine, making the following statement: ""If Ingmar Bergman had committed suicide, gone to hell, and come back to earth to direct an exploitation/art film for drive-ins, [Antichrist] is the movie he would have made."".

3781390,1,B001RVPOPW,"Man when I heard about this movie I heard it was going to be well disturbing and it was (but not until 73 mins in) but no one told me this would be a Art Film. The story from what I watched of it is about a (Married?) Couple having sex and while so their son goes and watches what's going on and while so falls (in probley the world's slowest recorded fall, and the fall takes 3 mins... 3 FREAKIN' MINS?!?!) and dies. Then they have a funeral and mom falls, and ends up in the hospital and then the couple moves into the cabin (and chaos insues, very very very very very slowly). I really disliked this movie for the fact that it takes so long for something to happen for example the kid falling or their talking (it seems there's more talking then action in this movie, which is also why I can't bare to watch as well). Also another reason why I can't stand this movie is that nothing memoriable happends other than strange baby bird falling from a tree, and badly animated talking fox that said ""Chaos Rains!"" in like a Mortal Kombat narration voice, and when the man cuts a woman cl*t (not sure if I can say it on amazon but the * equals an i) off. Also the last thing that kind of pissed me off was when I found out this movie's budget was 11 Million Dollars. Really, 11 Million to make one of the world's boringest ( don't care if it's not a word) Art Films, it's just doesn't make sense. What scene in this film was worth 11 Million Dollars???

If you have an open mind and an appreciation for films as a medium of art, one that stretches beyond the bounds of entertainment, you won't regret watching this film.

I can't even put it all into words, but to me this film is an amazing critique of the conditions of gender oppression. Even though I was horrified by certain elements of the film, I don't know any other way that the depth of the grotesque dialectic between masculine and feminine could be honestly conveyed in film. I came away from it believing that all that was included in the film was necessary to represent this fundamental truth.

In order to understand the whole plot. it's neccesary to go back to the last twof ilms of Andrei tarkovsky, whom this film was dedicated.

First at all, we must cite Tarkovsky's The mirror in which the reminded Russian genius describes with all the maxim poetic intensity the presence of the nature as well its nostalgic impact. The cabin, the river, the fire, the mother nature and forest are watched from the perspective of a child. On the other hand we have to internalize how would you do placed in her place?

They retreat to a forest because this was the last place she shared with her son, trying to find some clues to face this horrid situation.

The woman feels herself doubly guilty: on one hand, they were enjoying the maxim pleasure while their son was dying and on the other one, she hasn't been able to overcome the trauma of certain religious images. as a amatter of fact, when she express him in the therapy ""Nature is Satan's church"" and the distorted concept the woman is a devilish being, she blends into her schizophrenia both events and so we may watch the nature from the other side of the coin respect Tarkovsky's viewpoint.

I refused to just buy it because I've never seen it before and the reviews from it are very mixed. I finally found it online from blockbuster, surprisingly. Anyway, this film was the first of Lars von Trier's collection that I have dipped my feet into. I've also heard many mixed things about him as a person and all, but I'm not bothered or offended easily so I was interested in his work. I heard he was controversial, in your face, yet that his films can be beautifully executed and portrayed. I will admit I was smittened by the artsy feel for this film. The black and white prologue and epilogue were unique and well worth a watch just for these, the slow motion settings, the surprising CGI the Danish director used in the film. All of these aspects made this film ""watchable"" for me. I put the word in quotations because it is not easy to say this film is watchable. I personally think many, if not most will strongly dislike, maybe be offended someone can even direct this. There are many gritty scenes and painful scenes to view. Honestly, I was very bothered by the child falling out of the window at the beginning. I am expecting my son to be here within a month and some change as  I write this and I cannot fathom losing my lil man in a situation like that or at all to mention it. This is what the director wants, though. He wants you to feel what the only two actors in the film feel; grief, anxiety, despair and the three beggars (symbolism for the fox, deer, and crow). Another scene that many will not be able to look at is the infamous ""decapitation of her clitoris"". That is correct...I warn you only because I was warned, yet still for some reason felt I needed to see this film to understand what others were saying about it. Do I regret it?...No not really, as I'm glad to have checked this film off my list and move onto others. Will I want to watch it again?...probably not, I think once was enough for me personally. Others may be determined to understand this work of art and view it more than once, I on the other hand can just leave some things unexplained...

The film is no ""feel good"" movie. It is PURELY and ONLY ment to watch as an ART FILM. If you do not understand that concept, then go watch Xmen or something lame.

3781402,4,B001RVPOPW,"Let me first say that I had never heard of Lars von Trier before seeing this and that I only happened to see a preview for the film on the IFC station late one night. As it hadn't been released yet on DVD in the U.S.A. I decided I'd rent some of his other films to gauge his style. Luckily there is a local video store nearby that prides itself on its collection of non-mainstream and lesser known cult classic titles. My first rental was Europa, which I must say I absolutely loved. I then saw the first season of the Kingdom which I also enjoyed immensely. At this point I had a fairly good idea that I liked this guy's style. So, then came Antichrist...

The movie essentially revolves around a man and a woman who have lost their child. The woman goes through a semi-mental breakdown after the incident and the husband suggests that they go up to their cabin in the woods so the woman can work through her grief. This may sound like a simple enough story but the movie is filled with a myriad of other elements that make it worth viewing.

The dark, foreboding atmosphere keeps you wondering what is going to happen next and the film seems to maintain an overall eeriness for its duration. With this being said, I did not, however, find it to be as scary as I expected from previews and for this reason alone I gave it 4 stars as opposed to 5.

The thing that surprised me the most was actually the relentless use of full frontal nudity by both the man and the woman. I am not the kind of person that gets offended by this type of thing and I personally thought that it somehow fit into the overall tone of the film quite nicely - to the point that it didn't feel like it was there simply for shock value alone, but that it actually served a purpose with both the character's relationship and the story overall. I will say, however, that it does get quite graphic at various points.

The technical aspects of the film are superbly executed. The cinematography alone would make the movie worth viewing at least once with some beautiful black and white sequences as well as a few ravishing slow motion sequences of the woman walking through the woods.

Overall I would have to admit that I did not like this as much as I had hoped based on the few other works that I have seen by Lars von Trier, but that it was still too alluring to give less than 4 stars to. I do believe that the pace of this film may be too slow for mainstream American audiences (as there are quite a few scenes early on of nothing but conversation or silence, or a combination of both).Also, I felt that some story elements were not as well established as they could have, or should have, been (i.e. the womans back story). At certain points I felt like the story was dragging and I would frequently ask myself ""where is this going"" when finally something would happen to fuel the story onward just as I was on the verge of throwing in the towel. I will point out that the final 40 minutes of the film do manage to keep your interest with very little effort as the action and suspense begin to creep in fast and furious.",1301788800,4,3095,4.30188679245283
3781403,1,B001RVPOPW,"I'd like to review this without being cliche and using the word ""pretentious"", but the movie opens with a passionless black & white Mapplethorpe sex scene set to Handel in which a young child dies at the very moment of climax. You can argue a firetruck's white and you might be saying something new, but it's still red.

Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg play a lizard-like couple who deal with the grief of losing their child with implausible pseudo-psychological back and forth sniping. They go to the woods and Things Get Bad. Eventually, CGI wildlife starts talking to Dafoe. It is stupid. Before melting into pure crazy, Gainsbourg's character oscillates between a mix of self-destructive hysterics & unchained libido, and icy, calculated contempt. Her unconvincing grief feels like an excuse to paint women as irrational hyper-maternal animals who just may attack you without provocation, but it's ok because they don't know what they're doing. Either way, it's hard to make any emotional investment (i.e. care) because all the dialogue is so detached and inhuman. The film's flirtations with gender studies feel like Transformers 2 taking on institutional racism.

Visually, it looks like a Hollywood movie except the camera shakes around more and makes more ""unconventional"" incongruous cuts.

When any art goes way into the deep end of comical grimness, its last hope is uncomfortable laughter, because the discomfort shows that we're still with it. With Antichrist, there is only eye-rolling.

Like an art school student, Lars von Trier took three ""heavy"" concepts--sex, violence and guilt--and assumed that no matter what he did with them, the results would be meaningful. self-serving turd",1300320000,36,1705,5.280442804428044

3781406,5,B001RVPOPW,"Here is a film that will confound some and resonate with others.  Which side of the divide you fall on will depend on your childhood.

The director is a fearless filmaker, but in real life he is hobbled by depression and phobias so bad he almost had to give up filmaking.  I suspect, but have no way of knowing for sure, that his childhood was disastrous and his mother evil/crazy.  As such, I see this film as a statement feminine evil, and in particular the feminine evil of pernicious mothering.

Mothering in its pure and good form, involves unconditional love and supportive nurturing and in a perfect world, all mothers would be that way.  The reality of course is that not all children are so lucky.  Some are betrayed by the very person that holds their life in her hand.

Some mothers are evil to varying degrees.

My reading of the film is that She (the female lead is never named) is an evil mother symbol and He is the child symbol.  The torture inflicted on He is pretty clear.  A millstone is bolted onto his leg, and his manhood is crushed.  This can be read as the legacy of evil mothering on some adult male survivors in the most blunt of terms.  The director does not deal with female children because this is his story and he is a man;  nobody should read into the story misogyny.

'He' frees himself from She by killing and then immolating her.  He is left however, lame and neutered.  But he is still alive.

I could continue, but I just wanted to write a quick blurb on some of the ideas that this movie triggered in me.

It pleases viewer with beautiful shots of nature and animals, contrasted with black and white shots of a married couple that has to accept tragedy that occurs during their passionate lovemaking.

If there is a way for parents to crack once their child dies,this film definitely is able to touch on that subject.  Loss, fear, guilt and unbearable grief lead to many different emotions for different people.  For protagonists in this film, played by Charlotte Ginsbourg and Willem Defoe it leads to a downright spiral.

As we learn about grief and its phases these two individuals experience, one spouse decides to rationalize them by using his professional background, while other chooses to experience grief in all its force refusing medication and confronting the anxiety that follows. Compared to what happens afterwards, this couple's initial resolve to conquer their loss on their own seems almost idealistic.

Some of the scenes I found gruesome.  It is a special kind of pain and inner human nature that can force two people to do things to each other like these two characters set out to do to themselves.

If you are hoping for a good and entertaining Horror, then look else where, this isn't your typical Horror movie, it is nothing like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scream/dp/6304711875/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scream</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist-The-Version-You-ve-Never-Seen/dp/B0000524CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense-Collector-s-Edition-Series/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)</a>. it is not like any other Horror movie for that matter.
If however, you are a big movie and film buff who loves to watch new stuff and analyse films from acting to direction to cinematography, then you will definitely find something to enjoy with this movie.
the plot is good, about two griefing couple who just lost their child and decide to leave to a cabin in the woods for healing, but the pace it moves in is mega slow, something that the regular movie goer would not want in a Horror. then there is the twists and turns that make this a bit hard to follow and understand. it sort of tries to take you deep into Psychology issues and so on.
the acting is superb, both Willem Defoe and the lady playing his wife are pretty good here, but again, acting alone won't satisfy the regular movie goer.
the movie does include some original and never before seen scenes in movie history, some brutal and wierd scenes that i would never have thought would ever be shown in movies. so if you are really curious to see something new, rent this and see.
the Cinematography and direction are superb as well, good scenes and artistic shots of the woods and the cabin.

So in short, if you are an average movie watcher who is looking for typical Horror, this isn't for you. if you are more of a film buff who likes acting, Cinematography and seeing something new, then you might want to rent this, you might find something out of it. definitely not worth buying for either crowd because the script is just awuful !!",1298332800,5,2514,5.5811518324607325

Turn away and don't look back.  Because this is not an easy film to watch.  I say this as someone who is seldom disturbed by fiction; it isn't real, it doesn't get to me.  ANTICHRIST does.  I can't say that I will ever watch it again...and yet the viewing experience will last for quite some time.

The film's plot is deceptively simple.  A couple (Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg) suffer the loss of their infant son.  The tragic event throws the wife into grief, and her therapist husband suggests a trip to the woods to help her overcome her grief.  As you may expect, things don't go quite according to plan.

For two actors to hold a film on their shoulders requires an immense level of talent.  Dafoe and Gainsbourg both turn in performances that are stellar; the only reason these actors haven't received infinite accolades is because the film itself is so controversial...the controversy in large part due to the realism of the performances.  This is a highly surrealistic film, yet the pair manages to grasp a level of reality and cling desperately to it.  The result is graphic violence--often sexual in nature; consider yourself warned--that hits harder and surer than the ""torture porn"" films that are being tossed about these days.  This isn't the latest SAW sequel.  This is Lars von Trier ripping at your guts, going below the belt and doing considerable damage.  It's a film full of art-house imagery, macabre scenarios (von Trier has been studying his Lynch), and thoroughly disturbing concepts.  Slightly misogynistic in nature (but intentionally so, without judgment) though it may be, ANTICHRIST is a film that will leave a lasting impact.  You can love it or hate it; there's no middle ground.  Either way, you have to admit, this film succeeds at its intended purpose--that is, it gets a reaction from you, a visceral response that leaves little room for doubt.",1297728000,6,2044,4.886627906976744

3781413,3,B001RVPOPW,"Some films make it a point to shock the audience.  Lars von Trier is always good for that.  Sadly, `Antichrist' is not like his previous efforts in this whole `shock therapy' format of storytelling.  Unlike films such as `Dancer in the Dark' or the savagely brilliant `Dogville', `Antichrist' fails to underline the key elements that make this shocking structure relevant and acceptable.  Instead, this film just becomes a glossy (one way to look at it) attempt to portray sadomasochism to generate controversial attention.

Let the genital mutilation commence.

I will admit, shortly after watching this film I felt kind of sick.  It was a regretful sickness; like WHY DID I JUST WATCH THAT kind of feeling.  It's sad, since I'm generally drawn to von Trier and consider him a genius auteur who continues to amaze me.  `Antichrist' has all the makings of a signature von Trier vehicle and yet it lacks that special something that constitutes the film necessary.

`Antichrist' feels like a sick joke.

The film centers on a couple going through a terrible tragedy.  During a moment of passion, their young son stumbles out of the window and freefalls to his death.  The mother is devastated (as is to be expected) and she is suffering mentally because of it.  The husband happens to be a psychiatrist and so he whisks his wife to a cabin in the woods in order to `treat her' himself.  While there she goes completely insane and chaos ensues.

Some have `mistakenly' labeled this a horror film.  Much like von Trier himself admitted, he attempted to make a horror film and failed.  This is not a horror film.  To say that that fact is a detriment to the film is a misguided accusation.  The film does not suffer in tone, for the tonal shifts in the film are expertly played.  Like I said, this film has nearly everything needed to create a perfect von Trier film.  The direction is one of the films many assets.  Von Trier is ridiculously on top of his game here.  Every single surface is crawling with atmosphere.  Visually, this film is undeniable.  The acting is also superb, especially Cannes winner Charlotte Gainsbourg.  Some have stated they felt her one note (she screams and cries and loathes herself) but that `one note' is layered with so much visceral emotion it is uncanny.  The way she completely gives herself over to her director and his vision is breathtaking.  This is the definition of `fearless' acting (note the amount on uncomfortable sexual degradation she was put through and the ease of nature that she went about her business).

Her Oscar snub was expected yet a pure travesty.

Yes, everything was in line, expect for the script.  The idea is there...the concept.  The play on man's initial plight with woman (Eden) and the fact that throughout history women have been degraded as inferior to man, dominated by their husbands thanks to their initial sin, is all expertly conceived, it just isn't brought to completion as wholly as it should have been.  The slight turn of emotional complexities within Gainsbourg's character give hint to something more sinister, deeper than the film is allowing.  It makes great strides to deliver something so bizarrely shocking and upsetting to the eyes that it forgets the most haunting aspect of a film is the mental game it plays on the audience, and this film's mental games feel absurdly shallow.

I thought that the eventual outcome, that last few moments where fate is dealt, was deftly executed, but it also underlined the films major flaws because it felt out of place and undervalued thanks to the lack of consistent poignancy in the film.

I am a firm advocate for von Trier and his visionary theatrics, and I will continue to respond to his films, but `Antichrist' is certainly his least successful film to date.",1296172800,6,3786,4.813953488372093
3781414,4,B001RVPOPW,"Antichrist is a 2009 film directed by Lars Von Trier, and stars Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg in tremendously brave performances.  It would appear Antichrist is the musings of a madman but I'll admit I will need to see it again to find the deeper cutting points I'm quite sure Von Trier intended to make.  As it stands Antichrist is a movie that can be described as grisly, surreal, puzzling, explicit, polarizing, and profoundly sad, but powerful.  The jury is out as far as the accusations of misogyny are concerned but I see where the existence of such scrutiny has merit.  Nevertheless, it is a film that put me in a state of numbing amazement, but I'm not so sure I can say it is a great movie for that.  It is better than the more common films with similar devices to shock, if only because the actors know exactly who their characters are and what their characters are doing, even if the viewer doesn't  necessarily know what's going on it makes the terrifying elements of Antichrist work far more than your typical modern torture porn.  Antichrist is torture porn but it just might be the Opening of Misty Beethoven of torture porn.  In other words, it appears to have a reason for its uniquely grotesque content, beyond just making the audience generally uncomfortable.

Antichrist feels like a horror film as it trudges through its narrative; which is divided into a prologue, four chapters, and an epilogue.  The two leads are a couple that experiences a tremendous tragedy in the film's opening frame; it's very best scene, a black and white montage that is gutsy enough to contain surprising hardcore inserts and a horrific finish.  The scene instantly sets the stage for what is a slow nail-biting build-up in the following chapters.  The two leads retreat to a cabin in the woods where odd visions plague the man and the woman gradually goes mad and begins to exhibit disturbing and enraged carnal conduct.

Antichrist is a horror film but many fans of horror will reject that label.  I would suggest that's because it makes even them uncomfortable and it just isn't a fun movie like most horror films are, often by accident.  It is a subversive film that smashes you hard in the face to get your attention.  It hit me hard enough that I almost want to watch it again to figure out what the hell it was about but yet it made me uncomfortable enough that I'm not in much of a hurry.  Regardless, Antichrist is extremely provoking and has divided its audience so intensely I had to see it at least once.  The performances are outstanding by its leads, particularly Gainsbourg who won Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival.  The soundtrack, editing, and special effects are top notch as well.  Von Trier knows how to make a movie but I'm questioning his ability to tell a story.  He's forever piqued my interest and that has to count for something.  Antichrist is a daunting film that is without question extremely bothersome to abide, but it just might be worth your time if you want in on the conversation.",1296086400,3,3031,4.6685499058380415
3781415,4,B001RVPOPW,"Charlotte Gainsbourg thoroughly deserved her Cannes Award for ""Antichrist"", a film that has become controversial for its' graphic scenes of female genital mutilation, though of course this is not advertised on the sleeve. In what can be called Lars Von Triers' highest & lowest point on film, he extracts a beguiling performance from Ms. Gainsbourg, who proves that she is equally adept at both a film and musical career. Here, she slips into her role as lead actress with an unashamedness that should be seen to be believed, as its impossible to think that any actor would be this comfortable in front of the camera, doing the things she does.

Many have called this a classic retelling of the Adam & Eve story, albeit through the eyes of a madman. This is in part true. The similarities are endless, and one can find numerous references to the Genesis (and even the Bible) throughout the film, although its obvious after a certain point that everyone involved is in on the joke. This is why I wouldn't call this a 'horror' film per se, although there is not one scene of goodness or human empathy here. From children dying to people harming themselves in twisted, grotesque manners, this is violence portrayed as high art, and if that is a concept that seems unthinkable or gross to you, then 'Antichrist' is not the kind of movie you should be watching.

Directorially speaking, this is Von Trier's lowest point on film, in many ways, because a lot of the creative charisma he demonstrated in 'Dancer in the Dark' (which revolutionized how a scene could be shot)is sorely absent here. There are a few minor touches here (and some splendid cinematography), but production-wise I would put this only a few notches higher than 'Dogville', or even 'Manderlay' (another true-blooded classic that is thoroughly underrated and overlooked by the viewing public). Willem Dafoe eschews his inspired performance-mode (one that he brought to the table in ""The Last Temptation of Christ"") and instead adopts the screen presence that he did in the tawdry ""Body of Evidence"" with Madonna Ciccone. This is not entirely a bad thing - ""Antichrist"" wants us to look at two human beings at their lowest points in life, and observe the harm they inflict upon one another in no uncertain terms. This is hard viewing, at times you wonder if there is any storyline at all except for two human beings locked up in a cabin wounding themselves, but it is nevertheless riveting.

There are some scenes of special note. The opening sequence where their infant dies (while they are engaged in other activities) is beautifully crafted - a moving piece of cinema comparable in spirit to the instrumental overture of ""Dancer in the Dark"" (although in a totally different way). There is the infamous segment where Willem Dafoe, stumbling in the forest, comes upon a fox who utters a few simple words - at which point the film comes entirely undone, and everything in it goes absolutely haywire. This is intentional, and is the turning point for the storyline to go from reserved to full-blown madness. Here, it is comparable to the box scene in David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"", where the opening of the box changes everything, and the rest of the film seems in no way connected to the first. This 'two films in one' concept works well at times, and here it is almost necessary, just to see how low these characters can sink.

For those of you worried about the violence in this film, well you should be. This is definitely not a family-viewing experience, and is better watched as part of a discussion group. There is nothing happy about this film, and thats its point. Its also a brutal allegory that neatly ties in certain concepts of the Bible to the current state of humanity. Of course, there are those who choose to read the film this way, in which case it works for them on other levels, but as a solid work of art, there is much to enjoy here. No doubt Criterion scored a coup when they obtained the rights to release this on DVD, and this is definitely the best label for such a movie. Criterion is known for its painstaking efforts to remaster and retouch every film they release, which explains the brilliance of this DVD, and a good film often has the opportunity to become great when its released on the Criterion label.

Onto the actual DVD itself. The pristine transfer aside (even scenes in the dark are clearly visible and not muddled, like some of the R2 DVD releases), the sound is spectacular. This is a very vocal film, in many ways, with a quiet atmospheric score, sweeping strings, and then hushed vocals - it simply cries out for a good sound system or else there is almost no impact.

Special features include an Audio commentary by Von Trier and professor Murray Smith - this is interesting because Von Trier comes across as really intelligent, and not as quirky as I thought he'd be (he DID come across as super talented on the special features of 'Dancer in the Dark' too). There are also video interviews with Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg - Gainsbourg in particular comes across as being thoroughly invested in the role and a 'directors actor'. In fact, she seems almost shy, coy and rather reserved, which is totally at odds with the insane person she portrays on screen. This is a good thing, I suppose.

""Chaos Reigns at the Cannes Film Festival 2009,"" a documentary about the film at the Cannes festival rounds things up. In terms of extras, this is not your typical deluxe edition as I do feel there could have been more, but since the quality of the audio commentary and the lengthy video interviews are so good, I'm willing to cut them some slack. I came away from this film feeling that Von Trier has definitely progressed in his thinking, but at the same time there is a sense of 'sameness' about his work that he needs to work on. For example, from 'Breaking the Waves' to 'Manderlay', there have only been lead female characters in his films that have to deal with some sort of interminable suffering only to emerge semi-triumphant in the end (except for 'Dancer in the Dark' where poor Bjork met the most tragic conclusion). While he does seem to enjoy this theme, and so do we, 'Antichrist' is in many ways a consolidated lump of all of those earlier storylines, only more graphic and troubling. For those of us used to his work, its not all that shocking to actually witness the cliterectomy at the end of the film, but for those of you who haven't seen many of his movies, you might be moved (for very different reasons).

All in all, this is a good film with an eye for color, texture, sound, and what it misses in storyline it makes up for with lunacy. It could also be considered a star vehicle for Charlotte Gainsbourg, who despite being a huge recording star in her native France (both her albums ""5:55"" and ""IRM"" are huge alternative hits) has only now broken out as a full fledged film star, acting in films that only her deranged father Serge could have dreamt up of. Watch this for her, and to discover that she has far more potential than what was hinted at in ""The Science of Sleep"" (the magical piece she did with Gael Garcia Bernal).

3781417,4,B001RVPOPW,"We live in a world were a modern heterosexual male has Homer Simpson, Peter Griffin , Stan Smith , Ray Romano, and Kevin James as his role models. To be more specific a world where the regular everyday man is painted as an idiot who has no taste in music or fashion,  takes golf over his wife and bacon over his children any day. Well if you don't agree, that's just fine but for those who do, watching ""He"" or Willem Defoe's character in Antichrist is like a breath of fresh air. It is perhaps for the first time in a while that a male character has been portrayed as understanding, considerate, loving and compassionate. He's intellectual but not snobby, virile yet not violent. He is as strong of a character as any female leads in Ingmar Bergman or Andrei Tarkovsky films. For this very reason, I would say that Antichrist is a film of a significant message and worth watching and debating for years to come.

That aside, I would've easily given Antichrist a full five stars review had Von Trier handled the final scenes  with more taste by showing less gore and torture.... less is always more and I got a sense that in the final scenes  the direction of this film lost its cohesion.  Besides that Antichrist is a gem of a film, a milestone in the recent European cinema and an experience of its own, the kind that stays with you for days and haunts you for nights to come. If you ever got to sit down and watch this film, expect world class photography,  superb acting and a sophisticated story....nothing less than a masterwork.",1294012800,2,1535,4.483870967741935
3781418,3,B001RVPOPW,"I was rather disturbed watching this movie late at night. Good movie, to simplify it, i would say that its one isolated case, one look at how a  given couple deal with tragedy. Its one opinion, one couple's demon faced, one different look at grief and post traumatic stress.

People handle things differently. The ending was a surprise, i wasn't expecting it. Not sure if it made me feel uneasy or sad..definitely shocked. At first i thought he was the one thats gone mental indeed as the movie progressed and started to focus on him indirectly, then i thought i wonder if he is doing her a favour in the end because he loved her..Nevertheless shocking ending

Hmm i wonder..it actually made me feel relieved, not sad. Maybe this was what she needed

Worth a watch, but to be honest its not for everyone's taste. Warning - contains some hectic scenes and imagery, NOT for sensitive viewers, especially the scene with the scissors as well as the scene with the deer - the first time Willem Dafoe sees her in the forest.. Hectic

I must admit i cheated, i fast forwarded during the scenes when Charlotte explains 'her place' the imagery moved sooooo slowly that i was falling asleep. I guess greater concentration is needed when watching it, so i gave it 3 stars cos it was a bit too slow at times..

All in all a deeply psychological movie and not your typical slasher horror film,  that the title might suggest, although it fits the movie perfectly.

3781425,4,B001RVPOPW,"Lars Von Trier may not always be successful in a given endeavor but he's always worth watching. ""Antichrist"" is no exception. This is a fascinating work, but it is so in the 'train wreck' category. Some of what happens here is extremely difficult to watch. I've not been this disturbed in viewing a film since ""Martyrs"" and ""Irreversible.""

Basically, a husband and wife lose their child through an accident. Mom goes off the deep end and therapist dad takes her to Eden, a cottage so remote in the depths of Washington State you can only get there on foot, to see if he can square her away. He is almost entirely removed from the tragedy through being cerebral, while she is going completely mad through being entirely emotional.

There are a lot of creepy, yet sometimes very subtle, images throughout. There are also a lot of creepy, nasty things that happen, particularly in the third act. I don't recommend eating anything while watching this. But there is a fascination to it all. Von Trier does move the viewer toward something but I guess that is where I started getting lost. I simply did not understand exactly what he was trying to say. Did I not get it or was Von Trier not good at conveying it? There was a scene where Defoe finds some research his wife had been doing. It's hidden up in the attic. In a normal horror movie this would have pulled together all that had come before. In this film it only added to my confusion.

The visuals are very interesting and intense. The sound design is much like one would find in a David Lynch film. It might be a bit much at times but overall it adds to the proceedings. The performances by the two leads are top shelf. Maybe I should have given this three stars as have others. I'm going the extra star because I have the feeling this will get better with repeated viewings. Maybe it hasn't given up everything it has as of yet. This is not for the casual viewer. One needs to pay a considerable amount of attention and the disquieting aspects of the film might be off-putting to some.

One critic called it Ingmar Bergman meets Saw and there's a lot of truth to that description.  Apparently the playwright Strindberg is a real influence here, and there's a sense of marriage as a brutal contest between two souls, at least when it goes wrong.  The movie is also extraordinary in presenting a certain type of female evil that we don't usually see in films or elsewhere.  Male psyches twisted into tangible evil are run-of-the-mill but I don't remember any female characters quite like this one (except maybe in Fassbinder's ""Bremen Freedom"").

Now I have two tips for enjoying this movie :

One, be aware of when the two genital mutilation scenes are going to happen, and avert your eyes.  I feel bad for the original festival audience who weren't braced for those scenes.  I say just don't look and if you do peek through your fingers as I did you might notice that the scenes aren't especially realistic looking anyway.  Those scenes aren't my idea of entertainment.

Two, ignore the coda to the film which implies supernatural goings-on.  Von Trier did this same stupid stunt with ""Breaking the Waves""; the movie works as a psychological study of a human being and then he tacks on a silly ending to make it seem as if God or some supernatural force is directing the suffering.  And some people play into it and invest the film with spiritual meanings.  Ignore the ending, see this as a story about a singular female going off the rails, and I think it works much better.

The atmosphere von Trier creates is similar to that in movies such as ""Psycho"" or ""Bug""--all in all, good company to be in.  The eerie mood of the film is enhanced by von Trier's excellent use of distance and motion in his choice of camera, color and editing.

I E-Mailed Criterion at [...] yesterday and got an E-Mail back today from a Karen Mesoznik who works there and this is what she had to say:

Hi Aaron,

Thanks for your email!

We are issuing the uncut version of this film (108 minutes). Our master is the same version as the one that premiered at Cannes; IFC did not edit the film for release here. It's possible there may be some confusion due to the French DVD which incorrectly states the run time as 120 minutes.

I hope this information is helpful. Thanks you for supporting Criterion and please let me know if you have any more questions!

Best,

Karen

So, I wondered what she meant by the French DVD stating 120, so I dug a little deeper and found out that the French DVD in fact states the film at 120 minutes, but the film itself is actually 108 minutes (uncut). There is no 120 minute version of the film. 108 minutes IS in fact the longest running time. The cut versions range from 100-104 minutes (depending on where and how you view the movie). If you have seen the 108 minute version, then you've seen it all, and THIS is what Criterion will be releasing. (The film in all of its unsettling glory!)

I hope this helped you guys! I will definately be purchasing this version myself. Hopefully this persuades people to do the same.

If anyone has any further doubts, feel free to E-Mail Criterion yourself at the E-Mail address mentioned earlier in my post!",1285027200,382,1844,5.216949152542373

Willem Dafoe is a fine, and woefully underutilized, actor who rarely gets a chance to shine in a lead role, and everything Charlotte Gainsbourg touched in 2009 turned to gold (her album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Irm/dp/B002V9L57A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Irm</a>&nbsp;is the best of her musical career as well, if you've not heard it). So I already knew I wanted to see it. And then I found out that Anders Thomas Jensen, one of the flat-out best comedic directors to have ever lived, was credited as a story supervisor. How could this possibly go wrong? Besides, it sounded a heckuva lot like Larry Fessenden's underrated, brilliant&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wendigo/dp/B00006SFJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wendigo</a>. AND I'm a sucker for a good two-person movie. I was pretty sure I couldn't not love this. And then I sat down to watch it.

I have often, over the years, characterized certain films as endurance tests, either those that push the envelope of brutality and gore (Flower of Flesh and Blood, the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-Behind-The-Sun/dp/B0000AQS1H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Men Behind The Sun</a>) or films that are so emotionally wrenching they're difficult to watch (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iris/dp/B000067J3R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iris</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grave-of-the-Fireflies/dp/B0029KS9FM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grave of the Fireflies</a>). Antichrist is the first movie I've ever seen that combines the two effectively (though the gore is usually far more suggested than shown; it comes by its NC-17 rating for sex), to the point where I could not actually watch the movie in one sitting. That has never--not once--happened before with a movie to which I ultimately ended up giving a positive review. Which makes me think I should probably be rating this much higher than I am; I may go back and re-rate it later on. There is no doubt Antichrist is an effective movie, perhaps one of the most effective, on some sort of base, vestigial level, I have ever seen. But it is not without its problems.

The movie takes place entirely in the space of two different people. We are not sure what their relationship is, though it is a long-term partnership of some sort. Nor are we ever given their names; they are presented to us solely as He (Dafoe) and She (Gainsbourg). Their late son, whose name was Nic, appears briefly in the first scene, and then in flashbacks and photographs, but this is very much a two-person film. As you may have guessed from that last sentence, the film begins with Nic's death; he falls from the window of their apartment while the two are making love. Chapter One (the film, as von Trier's sometimes are, is structured in a Prologues, four chapters, and an Epilogue; the prologue is Nic's death) begins at the funeral, where She collapses during the procession. Fast-forward a month; She is still in the hospital, heavily medicated. He is convinced the doctors are wrong (He is a psychological internist of some sort, we gather from their conversations, while She is a Doctoral student who abandoned her thesis sometime between the summer before the film begins and Nic's death), that her grief is not atypical, that they're medicating her too much, and that He is capable of getting her well better than they can. Thus, He checks her out of the hospital and takes her to their cabin in the deep woods. But not all is as it seems. Soon, the two begin to shed the trappings of civilization, and in parallel, strange things begin to happen to the animals in the vicinity...

The success of Antichrist, as that of any two-person film, relies on incredible acting. And we get it. Dafoe is magnificent, but that is something we expect by now. Gainsbourg, on the other hand, turns in a career-best, and possibly a career-making, performance. (Gainsbourg won four different Best Actress awards for the role, including Cannes, and was nominated for two more.) She is shattering, and even had a lesser actor than Dafoe been cast opposite her, I have little doubt she could have carried this film on her own. But that alone does not take a film from the morass of the mediocre into the realms of greatness. Von Trier's script goes above and beyond the call, and in case you're wondering, here comes the major spoiler: everything we know about the film from the first two chapters says this is a slow-descent-into-madness movie, and then in Chapter Three we find out that She has, the entire time, been completely [censored for Amazon consumption] nuts. How's that for a plot twist? (Related minor spoilers: 1. We never find out what, specifically, it WAS that drove her completely [censored for Amazon consumption] nuts, only that it occurred sometime during the summer before the events depicted in the movie take place, and 2. I don't know why, but everything I read about the movie before I watched it led me to believe that Dafoe was the person who snapped in the movie; this is entirely untrue. He's the good guy, and he really is trying to help.) And when you go back over it, you see how well it's set up, so that when you think about it in hindsight, it seems blissfully obvious. But it isn't. That's some brilliant writing right there.

I just talked myself into revising the rating I was planning on giving it up half a star. And the more I think about it, the less annoying the actual flaws in the movie are; there are some pacing problems (especially towards the end of Chapter One), but they're minor at best, not nearly as bad as the pacing problems in the same place in Dogville, and I forgave those. And I had some problems with the gore being suggested so much of the time (and those are reinforced by von Trier's quote that he was trying to make a horror film), but it is entirely possible to make an effective horror film without gore; think Tourneur's Cat People as compared to the Paul Schrader remake (which is, to be fair, pretty light on the gore itself). Also, I know two of my problems with the film are far more personal than I should be allowing to creep into my reviews--the animal violence (none of it, I should stress, inflicted by humans) and the sexuality, which turns unremittingly brutal come Chapter Three. It's obvious in both cases that von Trier knew what he was doing, and I shouldn't be counting off for that; quite the reverse, probably. If it made me uncomfortable, it was doing its job. In fact, the only real problem that still remains with me is the epilogue, which was a little too straight-outta-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silent-Hill-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000GCFO0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silent Hill (Widescreen Edition)</a>, but even to be fair to that, it really did fit in with everything that had come before.

Short answer: by far von Trier's finest achievement to date. For that matter, the finest achievement from anyone there to date, with the exception of Jensen. It will probably disturb you, and you may end up hating it, but you must see it. ****",1285027200,3,8302,5.357088122605364
3781437,4,B001RVPOPW,"The troubles of a grieving married couple (Willem Dafoe, Charlotte Gainsbourg) soon grow exponentially worse when they travel out to a cabin in the woods in order for the wife to overcome her fear of nature. The fear that she has, in fact, causes her physical pain and as a result her end of the grieving process has been a lot more troublesome, coupled with the fact that she blames herself for the death of their newborn baby who accidentally kills himself in the opening of the film. The wife had taken their baby up to the same cabin prior to the accident in order to write a thesis on historical atrocities. The husband, naturally, understands that her connection with these woods is what intensifies her guilt and therefore challenges her to confront her fears. However, things start going wrong. After several grotesque warnings from their woodland surroundings and an even more terrible revelation involving the circumstances surrounding their child's death, it becomes clearer and clearer that there is a deep seated evil that lingers even deeper than the woods. Bloodshed, sexual mutilation, and terrible pain and agony ensue.

I apologize ahead of time for the unorthodox nature of this review, because I cannot tell you what this film is exactly. I think that however you react to this film will depend on your knowledge of film, your interest in horror film, your feelings about violence and the way people react to it, and your own bloodlust. This is a very subjective film, and I doubt that any two people who think that it works will like it for the exact same reasons that the other does. The most non-subjective way to put this film would be to call it an unusual horror film. I know that often times, when viewing or reviewing a film, it's important to separate the knowledge that you have about a particular motion picture from the initial first viewing of the same motion picture. Well, with this one I could not really do that. Really, how could I? The film was met with more jeers than most films in Cannes film history, and it was even the recipient of the first ever Anti-award for it's extreme themes and images of what most people would call pure misogyny. It also won Charlotte Gainsbourg a lot of acclaim, and she received the best actress award. So basically all I knew about the film was that a lot of people thought it was a very misogynist film, even more so than Von Trier's previous works, and that Charlotte Gainsbourg's performance is extraordinary. One thing is for sure, her performance here is about as good as any female performance I have seen this decade. Her performance has already become the stuff of legend, and I can MOST DEFINITELY see why. My god. Her work here chilled me to the bone. It is a heartbreaking, shocking, sickening, and at times slightly tender performance that I found tough to shake. I can see why her performance gets hailed alongside performances such as Isabelle Huppert in the rather quietly ferocious The Piano Teacher (2001) and Isabelle Adjani in the deeply deeply disturbing Possession (1981). Here, Charlotte Gainsbourg reaches the same level of genuine bodily horror, physical exertion, fearless emotion, and breathtaking beauty. It is one of the most unpleasant female performances I've ever seen and I almost hated parts of it due to how shattering her emotional impact was. I think that's how the horror of this film works the most.

Looking at the film itself, is it a misogynist picture? Definitely. That's not to say that Lars Von Trier is a misogynist, but it's easy to see why based alone on the female character in his own The Element of Crime. Here we have Antichrist, and this film is misogynist for completely different reasons. Antichrist may be a horror film, but above all it is an exploration of misogyny and the use of misogyny as an art form above all. When looking at the film in this way, there are a lot of things that make more sense. Von Trier has some incredibly fascinating ideas about guilt and how guilt can be used as a weapon against the people who you love (or in some cases who you pretend to love), but upon deeper thought the circumstances surrounding the grotesque series of events in the last act of the film seem a lot more simple. People force themselves to believe in good and evil, the film appears to be saying, but looking at the world in such a black and white way can cloud our judgment and make things complicated when the actual explanation is a whole lot more simple. I personally do not believe in true evil, and that's probably why I found this film to be so deeply disturbing in some ways. The husband in this film is mostly an unassuming, conflicted victim, despite taking part of the blame for the tragic events that occur in this film. Because of this, we are forcibly distanced from both of them so as to get more of a sense of their chemistry and less of a sense of their personal feelings and reservations. Because of this, the film's suspense is a lot more effective. We don't know for sure what these characters are willing to lose, and that's where the film succeeds at being a horror film. Looking at the film as it is, however, it would be impossible for a person who is truly misogynist to make a film like this. Alfred Hitchcock is probably the most blatant example of this, despite the fact that he's a brilliant filmmaker and an even more brilliant storyteller. A lot of horror film directors have successfully garnered horror out of women being stalked and hunted by mad psycho killers and monsters. Even Brian DePalma is guilty of the same thing! We're talking about the guy who made Carrie (1976) here! Just take a look at his extremely tragic suspense thriller Blow-Out (1981) starring John Travolta and Nancy Allen. It's one of my favorite films of all time. It's a perfect film in my opinion. Looking at it today, however, there are some very misogynist images and themes that run throughout. The film works, first and foremost, as a political suspense thriller, so obviously this isn't important. The film, however, opens with a man looking through several windows at several girls, some of whom show skin. Yes, the reasons for this gratuitousness are explained soon after, but that doesn't mean that the audience to escape the fact that we just saw women take off their clothes and be displayed as almost alarmingly vulnerable. It wasn't the film's intention to look deeply into those scenes, and so it's important that we don't. The major difference between a film like Blow-Out and a film like Antichrist, however, is that for the former it's not necessary to think about the female characters in order to be kept in horrific suspense by the film. With Antichrist, it really is necessary.

Even if you aren't the kind of person who will be scared by a film like Antichrist, chances are you will at least be haunted a bit by it or at least shaken up. That has a lot to do with the way it is photographed. The look of the film is very dark, luscious, and slightly dingy. It's also very colorful and not washed out at all. The shots of the trees and plants and the entire atmosphere that accompanies it is nothing short of breathtaking. The shots of the woods and of the interior locations reminded me deeply of Tarkovsky's The Mirror (1975). In fact, if there's any film I can say that this is inspired by, it'd be The Mirror. They both have the same dreamlike quality, the same emotional imagery, and the same sense of disorientation. Antichrist is kind of like a cross between The Mirror and Hxan. The film's only humorous aspect, in fact, comes in the form of a dedication to Andrei Tarkovsky in the credits for the film. I do not know whether Tarkovsky would have loved or hated this film, but one's thing for sure. He likely would have at least laughed at the ending credit dedication. Lets face it. Lars Von Trier loves to pick fights. His only reason for including that dedication, as far as I understand, is so that he can try and claim the title of being the next official Tarkovsky-esque filmmaker. It's something he's been trying to do ever since he made The Element of Crime. I mean yes, Von Trier went off the deep-end when he started making films in the mid to late-nineties that took place in heightened reality. Antichrist is a combination of both of his styles. His stylized and visually provocative style used in The Element of Crime, Europa/Zentropa, and The Kingdom, and his raw, horrific, and personal approach used in Breaking the Waves, Dancer in the Dark, and Dogville. Above all of that, I see Antichrist as a faerie tale in the style of the Brothers Grimm. It has the talking animal, the colorful setting, the dark tone, and the idea of something from the past coming back to bite you in the ass. When I looked at Antichrist as that, I found it to be an almost enjoyable descent into psychological madness and the destruction of togetherness amongst two beings who want nothing in life other than for one half to complete the other and likewise. It is heartbreaking, yes, but there is a lesson to be learned.

So despite personal feelings toward Von Trier's approach to the nature of evil, I found Antichrist to be an effectively scary, beautifully made little film with a lot to offer the cinematically adventurous and even more for those seeking a challenge within their own personal beliefs about misogyny in film. Above all, however, if one is to view this film they need to be able to want to be challenged and they need to be willing to be frustrated if the film is going to allow it's emotions and it's humanity shine through. I haven't talked about the sexual content of the film because I'm not even sure what to think. I will say that I do find a couple of scenes to be a little too gratuitous, but I think that it's a very creepy and very haunting little film. Is it my favorite film of Von Trier's? No way. I will say though that in terms of challenging cinema and challenging images, it succeeds in spades. I think it's a brilliant return to form in the vein of unfiltered and stylized filmmaking, and I cannot wait to see what Von Trier is planning on making with his next film. He's one of the weirdest filmmakers out there, but if he can make more films like this and continue to show no fear in abusing the viewing audience then he'll most definitely be remembered. Hell, I already appreciate the cinema of Von Trier about as much as I appreciate the cinema of Tarkovsky.",1284854400,5,10462,4.61406333870102
3781438,5,B001RVPOPW,"A psycho-therapist attempts to aid his wife through the grieving process after the couple loses their only child to a freak accident. As her condition worsens, he attempts more radical treatments in order to have her to face her fears by removing her to their isolated cabin in the woods. It is here that he discovers his wife has become obsessed with witchcraft during her thesis research, which sparks a dramatic shift in her attitude and causes her to lash out at her husband with a frightening ferocity. Director Lars von Trier delivers this brutal and shocking Arthouse picture that will have viewers on the edge of their seats! ANTICHRIST's experimental story structure can be a bit uncertain in the beginning, but as the plot unfolds, each of the perceived events from early on become integral elements that build into the twisted and horrifying revelation in the end. A dark, suffocating, and oppressive mood is developed through the turbulent emotional vortex in which the couple finds themselves caught thanks to a pair of incredible performances by Academy Award  nominee Willem Defoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg. As the plot hits its breaking point just after the hour mark, the slow and methodical character development gives way to scenes of nauseating gore, savage sexuality, and profoundly disturbing psychological terror that are sure to leave an immediate and lasting impression on audiences in the same way that MARTYRS had done in 2008. Lars von Trier has created a masterful visual and mental mind-warp that will leave some breathless and others completely dumbfounded while establishing ANTICHRIST as a modern classic.

As soon as He and She lose their child
Things start to get a bit wild
With each session of sex
an evident hex
makes the relationship soon get defiled

I'll admit I'm a tad in the dark about Lars Von Trier- I saw Dogville a few years back and thought it was an interesting film. Like Trier's most recent flick, Antichrist, Dogville is told in chapters. I'll admit that was one of the things that piqued my interest in Antichrist, so I'd thought I'd give it a chance.

Now I will admit it's a well made piece of cinema. But it's simultaneously just garbage. It is indeed very visually pretty; the stark black and white is definitely pleasing to the eye (the opening in particular, the shot of the baby opening the window is just breathtaking). But most of what follows is pretty bleak and the rest can't take your mind off of it until Von Trier throws some sick and disgusting crap in there. Some stuff makes the Saw movies look like a freakin square dance.

3781442,5,B001RVPOPW,"Lars von Trier's latest film caused quite a stir when it made it's debut at the Cannes Film Festival this year. Audiences there were divided, with some calling it beautiful and brilliant, while many others called it repulsive and pornographic. Antichrist is essentially an art film with many horror film elements. It has very graphic scenes of sexual imagery, as well as sexual mutilation...This is what has scared many filmgoers who have not given the film the attention it deserves.

The film's Prologue shows a couple (Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg) engaged in passionate (and, in one shot, explicit) lovemaking as their young son falls from a window to his death. This scene, shot in black and white, is one of the most beautifully filmed scenes I have ever seen in a film. The following is presented in four chapters; Grief, Pain (Chaos Reigns), Despair (Gynocide), and The Three Beggars, followed by an Epilogue. It follows He and She coping, He better than her. She is mad with grief, while He has found a way to muffle his emotions. The two go to their cabin in the woods (called ""Eden""), so He (a therapist) can help her further.

It's when chapter three begins that the scenes that had Cannes talking begin. This chapter specifically contains the most well-known image from the film of Dafoe and Gainsbourg under a tree, an image I find deeply unsettling in a film filled with unsettling images. Many viewers have mentioned the talking fox as being laughable, but I found it quite creepy and well-done. Von Trier uses CGI in this film, but it's a beautifully rendered use of the technology and it's not used often.

This is a movie filled with symbolism; some obvious, some a little more inconspicuous. I don't want to attempt to dissect any meaning from the film as I've read so much into it, I believe I'd have a biased view. With that said, I'm not sure anyone has nailed down von Trier's exact intent and I'm sure that whatever you take away from the film is close enough.

Now, on the performances...Dafoe and Gainsbourg show they are absolutely fearless in these performances, which show them willing to go places few actors would. Gainsbourg won the Best Actress award at Cannes and it's no wonder as she puts both her body and soul on the line in this performance. Dafoe is very convincing but isn't required to hit on all the emotions required by Gainsbourg. There are those who have blasted Dafoe's character as emotionless, but I don't see it this way. Dafoe grieves for his son, just as Gainsbourg does, but his grieving is characterized more by rationality and reservation than absolute emotional Hell.

Now, as for Antichrist being labeled ""pornography,"" I must say that this is very inaccurate. Not a single scene in this film is intended to arouse and von Trier seems to use the graphic sexual imagery as a way of exposing these character's inside and out. Furthermore, as She sees sex as being the cause of their son's death, these scenes of human nature and the human anatomy seem necessary for what the film is trying to illustrate. Does the film use explicit sexual imagery only when completely necessary? No, probably not. But I'm sure, in his own strange way, von Trier could justify this. On a similar note, many of it's violent images may be intended solely for shock value, but von Trier's use of this imagery doesn't come across as exploitive the way it would in a film by Eli Roth for example.

The cinematography in this film, by Academy Award-winning cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, is beyond masterful. Minus the shot of explicit sex, if the first scene of this film was released as a short film I have no doubt it would have received a lot more acclaim than this film has. The cinematography here makes one appreciate just how important good cinematography is to good filmmaking, for without a cinematographer of Mantle's merit I doubt von Trier would have been able to make this film. Many reviews (from both critics and audiences) have frequently cited this film as ""boring,"" and I expected that after hearing it labeled an ""art film."" I was surprised watching Antichrist, because there wasn't a single moment where I found myself bored with it. Both the beauty and the horror of the images onscreen kept me so transfixed that I found myself less interested in how the plot would progress, but how the images onscreen would progress.

It's not hard to see why many will completely reject and recoil from this film, but that's to be expected from a von Trier movie. Many who have loved his movies previously will hate this movie. I hated two out of the three films I've seen by the man previously and I loved this movie. Antichrist is a poetic, slow-moving film with shocking, memorable images and two fearless performances. It's a powerful film that is uncompromising in it's vision and not afraid to take it's audience to the depths of despair in a way that few films could or would. I am happy to be in the minority here when I say that Antichrist is one of the best films of 2009.

3781444,5,B001RVPOPW,"When Antichrist was presented at Cannes and around the world in 2009, moviegoers heard the reporters and critics from the press- either people that did see the film, or others that never did- give their comments on this movie, about its supposed misogyny,(when there are several Hollywood flicks, action and horror films, that are filled with such values), and its rough and violent sex scenes as being depraved or sick. In the end, there were even people who said the director deserved to be locked in an asylum for making this work. Which is just ridiculous for I believe all those people completely missed the point about this movie, for it is about depression, about the psychological battles Lars Von Trier does with himself in his own psyche. But it is also a movie about fear, the viewer's own fears.

Having endured a few years ago a long period of depression, which may not have been as intense as Lars Von Trier's, but powerful enough for me to have felt long periods of self-guilt, a complete lack of confidence with myself and my own talents, bouts of angers, and even suicidal thoughts, I really recognised myself through the emotional crisis, reactions and words of Charlotte Gainsbourg's character. So much that when I watched this movie for the first time, I felt more at peace with myself. As if the movie exorcised me of something that had been haunting me for a long time.

Back to Charlotte's character, I believe she is a woman who tries to express her own emotions, but who is constantly repressed by her own husband who is an incredibly cold and insensitive man. Come to think of it, since there are only two characters in this movie, I believe that Charlotte Gainsbourg's character could be a representation of Lars Von Trier, and his desire to express through his female characters, starting from Breaking the Waves to this movie, his own desires and emotions, but also his own fears. As for Willem Defoe's character, he maybe represents Lars' repressive side, linked to the director's own family origins, who taught to him that expressing emotions was shameful and ridiculous, and the technical side of his first three movies.

As for the actors, who are just perfect in their roles, most of all Charlotte Gainsbourg who deserved all the awards she got for this movie, they really make us understand their characters' actions and emotions.

To conclude, it is a incredible movie made by an incredible storyteller whose stories are filled with strong female characters who have to face coward and repressive men.",1282521600,5,2537,4.838709677419355

3781447,2,B001RVPOPW,"Antichrist is one of those movies that falls primarily in the ""love it or hate it"" category.  I, for the most part, hated it up to about the last half hour, to which it had some redemption.  I will not ruin anything, but let's just say that something happens to Willem Dafoe's character that makes me understand why people were walking out of theaters....if they hadn't walked out already.  But aside from the final 30 minutes, this film is truly a test of patience and endurance, feeling like one long therapy session, interrupted by scenes of rough sex.  Sure, there is a fair share of deeper meaning behind it all, but it all unfolds veeeeerrrrryyyyy slooooooooowly.  The basic premise is that while a married couple is engaged in black and white filmed sex, their infant son falls to his death in extreme indie art school fashion.  The remainder of the film focuses on Dafoe's character (who plays a Therapist), trying to get his wife through the stages of grief.  Religious intermixing of good & evil with the underlinings of trust & mistrust formulates the battle between man & wife.  Tedious interplay unfolds until we eventually arrive to the ""Holy Crap!"" moment, which rivals the ""Holy Crap"" moment of ""Audition"", which to me is a far better and disturbing battle of the sexes movie.  Anyways, what I'm getting at is that if this film is going to be released solely as a Criterion Collection release, you know that it is going to be pricey.  I would highly recommend that you rent it first to see if you fall into the ""love it"" crowd----to which I'm anticipating to be a smaller group.  There are aspects of the film that I commend the director for, but ultimately I was left unsatisfied and disappointed.",1277510400,12,1714,4.68
3781448,4,B001RVPOPW,"A woman and a man lose their son in a tragic accident.  Rather than trust in the medicine prescribed by her psychiatrist to ease her grief, he (a psychotherapist) decides to subject her to his own therapeutic regime.  She (in an incredibly devastating performance by Charlotte Gainsbourg) will face her fears directly, and see that there is nothing to fear.  He doesn't consider that he may have something to fear from her, or that he, with his clinical detachment from feeling and incessant preoccupation with the stance of observer, may be the one who truly needs therapy.  (On that note it is hard not to detect a kinship of the themes of this film with the themes of von Trier and Jorgen Leth's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Five-Obstructions/dp/B0002KPI3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Five Obstructions</a>, that set up von Trier himself as therapist to Leth, whose capacity for aesthetic detachment he found troubling).

The imagery in the film is fascinating and frightening - it is certainly von Trier's most accomplished film in terms of cinematography, and it definitely deserves to get the Criterion treatment.  The prologue and epilogue are highly formalistic, shot in a series of powerful black and white images that border on the unreal; the rest of the film, broken into four chapters, is shot handheld with washed out but saturated colors, with rippling natural imagery and occasional freaks of nature that as a whole evokes a darker vision of Tarkovsky's zone (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stalker/dp/B000I8OOG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stalker</a>).  The film is in fact dedicated to Tarkovsky, and suggests a kind of inversion of his values and approach: whereas Tarkovsky finds in nature the potential for transcendence, suggested but not depicted, von Trier depicts in nature the reality of hell, a ""Satan's church"" where, as the fox asserts, ""chaos reigns""; where Tarkovsky takes long, leisurely tracking shots, von Trier's are a bit jerky and employ the occasional jump cut, but he also employs the trademark Tarkovskian slow zoom into extreme close up on a partial face or gesture, and also (as I recall) occasionally employs the ""temporal folding"" that is common in Tarkovsky's films, where in the course of a single pan or tracking shot of the camera, events are depicted as if simultaneous that could not have been.

The film has been described by several critics as suggesting that women are evil, and the setting in a woods they call ""Eden"" makes it hard not to see ""she"" (Gainsbourg) as a kind of twisted Eve figure whose longings and obsessions (and sense of guilt) introduce evil and death into the garden.  Still, it seems to me that the central character in the film is ""He"" and the film uses him as an object lesson to provide a critical depiction of a paranoid male fantasy/nightmare.  ""He"" (played admirably by Willem Dafoe) is a therapist who is confident of his powers, and was obsessed by his job and detached from his wife and son until the accident allowed him to treat her as patient.  He had dismissed as trite her writing and research on misogyny and ""gynocide"" - hatred and violence against women, born of fear -- and was emotionally distant from her until now she became for him a fascinating object of study.  He becomes threatened and uneasy when she seems to have been cured, and seeks to continue the therapy by whatever means necessary.  What she really fears, he insists, is that the male fears about women that inspired the violence she had studied were in fact true, that women are in fact evil - and that she is herself the object of her fears.  When his projection onto her becomes real, when the fear he projected onto her comes to life, it becomes clear that this is his own paranoid fantasy, his own fear of aggressive female sexuality come to life allows him to justify and actualize the violent retaliation he had formerly only been able to realize against her in words, by objectifying and dismissing her.

It is as if, von Trier's film suggests, as if the modern version of the old male fear of the feminine, expressed then by accusing powerful women of witchcraft as a justification for doing them violence, as if this fear has been transformed or sublimated into the male pretense of objectivity.  An objectivity that treats women as if their fears and concerns were utterly banal, but only out of a deeper anxiety that if women were to realize that male objectivity is really a new form of witchcraft aimed at silencing women, if women were to realize this they would come into their own and that would be the real danger.  The film does not, as I see it, in any way endorse this view of women, or this fear, but depicts it powerfully in the form of a perverse parody.  Not for the timid, but not to be dismissed, either, as if it were merely another provocative and shocking joke by that Danish trickster, Lars von Trier.  It's a subtle and complex film, powerfully shot, darkly scintillating and dangerous.

3781449,1,B001RVPOPW,"I can't even understand why this movie was even made.  Basic plot:  kid falls out the window while couple is having sex, wife goes through a long and drawn-out grieving process while therapist husband tries to help her, they go off to the woods so that she can confront her fears, she goes a little batty on husband, and husband finally chokes her to death, then burns her body.  That's all, folks.

I didn't find this movie that disturbing, except for two parts:  when the wife was pleasing his phallus, which he then ejaculated blood; and when the wife cut off her own clitoris.  Amazing stuff, huh?  Please...  What the director/screenwriter should have done was incorporate more of the ""satanic"" elements into the movie.  All you see are pictures of medieval witchery, which were the subject of the wife's thesis.  Although this was never explicitly revealed in the movie, my best guess is that she literally ""became"" her thesis.  If only that concept was developed further....  As such, this is a half-star film.",1275696000,9,1017,4.815028901734104
3781450,4,B001RVPOPW,"The 2005 film Tideland opens with that film's director Terry Gilliam informing the audience that some of them will hate it, but some will love it. That may have been a smart choice because I don't think I would have been prepared for what I saw without that disclaimer. Lars von Trier, director of Antichrist, is too relentless to include any such warning, but if he had, it would have been more fitting to say, ""Probably nobody should watch this. It's going to give you PTSD.""

The film opens beautifully in a black-and-white sex scene between the film's two principal characters, known simply as He and She. It is the only good and happy part of this film, so you better enjoy it, because before you know what hit you, a toddler falls out of a window to his death. After She spends months in the hospital, enduring the crippling grief over the loss of her child, He, being a psychiatrist, finally decides that no progress is being made and he must take her healing into his own hands.

This is a bad decision presumably motivated by his feelings of jealousy. Ultimately, He decides they must travel to their holiday cabin in the woods to confront her depression. What ensues are some bizarre incidents of psychological torture and ultra-violence, which the film's press releases attribute to ""nature."" Is it the inherent evil of our very human characters? Or is it possible that there is some sort of evil presence in the cabin? These questions are left appropriately abstract and further earn this film more horror credits.

And yes, this is a horror film. Von Trier claims that he failed in trying to make a horror film, but he gives himself too little credit. It may be the most genre-defying genre picture I've ever seen, and that is what truly elevates it.

Some have accused this film of being misogynistic. That very well may be true. I prefer to believe that it is more about the corruptibility of humans as a result of pervasive social stigmas. We are crafted by the evil which surrounds and envelopes us.

To put it mildly, Antichrist is rough stuff, and is going to be talked about by serious cinephiles for some time to come. Its cruelty transcends sensitivity, and its ugliness subverts beauty. To witness the complexity of the relationship between He and She, and the performances that generate this complexity is worth the price of admission alone.

My disclaimer? I will never recommend this movie to someone who is not curious about seeing it already. After watching Antichrist, I honestly felt rattled for the next few days, and I didn't truly know how to feel about it. In hindsight, I'm glad I saw it. This is an unpleasantly powerful film.",1275609600,20,2662,4.701716738197425

3781452,5,B001RVPOPW,"[Edit: 11/10/10 Received my pre-order copy yesterday. Criterion delivers! The following address some serious pre-release ambiguieties/anomalies.]

Big Questions that need answering for this Criterion Release.  Many are unthinkable for such a prestigious company as Criterion, but they're demanded and need circulation/speculation prior to the release:

1.  The Region 2 copy for France listed on Amazon is 120 minutes.  This one is listed as a 108 minute runtime.  The Catholic version was the one released for theaters in France.  Is Criterion releasing the uncut ""Catholic"" version or the cut""Protestant"" version?  Will obtaining an unspoiled copy of a cinematic masterwork be as difficult as it currently is to find a legitimate copy of LvT's ""The Idiots""?

2.  The US is a 'prude market' according to Zentropa Entertainments:

""We reached an agreement with Lars more than a year ago to make a 'Catholic' version of the movie, to cut some scenes and replace them with others,"" Peter Aalbaek Jensen, the head of the Zentropa production group, told AFP.

""Otherwise it would be impossible to sell (it) to prude markets like southern Europe, Asia and the United States, where you can't show a naked man from the front,"" he said.

[taken from France 24 online news]

3.  IFC's released version was uncut.

4. IFC and Criterion recently made a merger.

5.  Amazon needs to make this information available and clearly listed on the product page and the blue ray format, otherwise it WILL find itself having a disproportionately high return rate for this product.

This is a niche market.  This director has a hardcore following and attracts broad interest and attention even on the merit of purely his technical skills and sensationalism that surrounds his releases. People who WANT this film want to see it, own it in its entirety.

We are not a prude market, we have prude authorities.  This release will suffer severe curtailing of sales if Criterion/ifc have bent over backwards to political pressure.  The Protestant version WILL be boycotted by American consumers en masse.",1273881600,69,2076,5.149700598802395

However, this work is much ado about nothing as an extra-orbital price on DVD swept out from shops is rather a royalty of the past achievements than reflecting a sense of this movie if any at all could be digged from an under tree root natural cave a character sought refuge in to struggle with something demonic, not visible in the darkness.

In few words, psychotic nymphomaniac and a schizophrenic sex-machine compliment each other running around undressed down the belly mostly and copulating to calm mutually.

As their toddler had tragically gone, a couple moves into woods to heal from a lose but ends catastrophically.

3781454,4,B001RVPOPW,After seeing this I really wanted to tell other people to watch it but because of a few unnecessarily graphic scenes it makes it a hard sell. Without spoiling too much there are some graphic scenes that I am fine with. Even the most graphic scene at the end with the female and the scissors was OK because it was an important shot for the story. The three other graphic scenes with the animals were also fine because they were meant to shock not only us the viewer but the male lead as well. However there are other scenes that are there that just feel out of place or over the top and actually hurt the film. Just shocking us for the sake of shocking us makes those scenes hallow and take away from the film. This movie has a very well written story to tell and the actors do a great job. It is just too bad that most people will skip it or all they will take with them from this film are the shocking moments when there is so much more there...,1271721600,,946,4.118918918918919

I love Charlotte Gainsbourg as a musician but she scared the hell out of me in this movie. The other reviews are correct. It is incredibly graphic and there is mutilation of sexual organs in this movie. It is not horror in the sense that it is scary. It is more of a psychological terror and you watch a fragile mind slowly lose control of reality. Some people have given this film a 1 star rating but I don't think they fully grasped what was behind it. It is a slow moving movie and is not for everyone. Definitely not for kids to watch. I give it 5 stars because it is very unique and really disturbed me. I don't see them releasing this movie in the U.S. It is not an X rated movie but it won't get by with an R rating.

3781456,5,B001RVPOPW,"I came into this film with absolutely no expectations.  I watched it solely on the fact that two of my favorite actors took the starring roles.  From the opening shot, I was mesmerized by the incredibly beautiful cinematography and direction.  I will be checking out more of Lars Van Triers' work, you can count on that!  Every shot amazing and haunting.  The first half hour sets-up the conditions for what appears to be a portrait of a tragedy.  Then...the film evolves into a manifestation of penance and self mutilation that takes guilt to a whole other level.  Even though we wouldn't think we would ever get to that point, you understand the reasoning for the violence and the possibility that it very well could happen. You will cover your eyes a few times, but the script pulls you back to see if there is any absolution.  Does it come? Watch it and see.  Incredibly disturbing at times, I was hypnotized by Ms. Rampling's acting range.  I loved her and I wanted to kill her. Willem Defoe holds up his end with incredible verve.  I consider this ""a must see"" film.  As David Lynch once said, ""There's a lot of beauty in the dark gritty places of the world.""",1270339200,5,1165,4.548076923076923

I've enjoyed von Trier's wor in the past, and Willem Dafoe usually provides a wonderful performance (which could be taken in other ways in this context.)  The movie was amazing in the sense of being a work of art, but I don't think I could watch it a second time (though I'm tempted to buy it just to support von Trier's work.)  It contains intense violence, sex and a rather bizarre story.  I highly recommend it to those who enjoy a smart, artsy film and have strong stomachs.",1270252800,,512,4.414893617021277
3781458,3,B001RVPOPW,"To sum it up, AntiChrist is oblique, pretentious, creepy, and oddly compelling. Let me just give you a warning: despite some claims that the movie is not particularly graphic, it is, and despite other claims that the graphic parts of the film are not gratuitous, they are. The sex scenes are violent, often literally pornographic, and the scenes of violence and torture that come about two thirds of the way through are incredibly graphic and disturbing, to say the least. I think anyone who says otherwise must be pretty jaded. All of this is not intended to warn you off the movie, but to give you a heads up if you like to avoid that sort of thing. Tone-wise, the film reminded me of Don't Look Now and, even more so, Polanski's The Tennant. Expect the horror element to develop very, very slowly. You may in fact wonder what the heck you've gotten yourself into during the first half hour or so, which offers zero horror content (and the first five minutes is the definition of pretentious. Edited down to 60 seconds it could have been effective).",1268438400,2,1051,4.625668449197861
3781459,1,B001RVPOPW,"Anti Christ is another one of those movies that the critics have praised to the skies and loved every minute of it. Some friends recommended it to me and I attempted to watch it. Attempted is the word that I use to describe this movie because in my opinion it is one of the most unwatchable movies ever. A couple played by William Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg are making love when their baby falls to death from falling out of the window. To repair their marriage and gain solace they go the woods where the husband tries to cure his wife by psychotherapy. What follows is disaster and mayhem which culminates in a bloody climax.
I thought the film was strictly for lovers of cinema in which the story unfolds but nothing is obvious, it is up to the viewer to decipher the goings on in the film. Anti Christ is that film. If you like symbolism in films and like to come up with your own version of events then this is the movie to see. Strictly for Film school students and lovers of gut wrenching violence.

It seems more like it wants to be a piece of art than an actual movie with a storyline, since the plot is as thin as a lifetime movie of the week. There's a man and a woman. Basically the lady is crazy and their son died because they were too busy getting their groove on and he fell out the window. She could have stopped it but she was having an orgasm. Then they go to the forest. AND WOW...it's beautiful but weird and twisted. A deer runs away with a dead fawn hanging out of it. A fox eats his own guts and says ""Chaos Reigns"" not to mention their roof gets attacked by acorns. Yeah, scary stuff. Oh yeah and then there's some torture porn. Only it's not because it has a deeper meaning or something. Throw in a ridiculous ending and you have a movie no one will ever want to watch again after seeing it once.

3781461,1,B001RVPOPW,"You know you are off to a bad start when you see the film is staring William Dafoe (A man who never does seem to have much luck with women, they always seem to have a habit of wanting to bump him off.  Not surprising really) However this film ignoring the ""Warning contains scenes of a sexual and disturbing nature"" Is just quite frankly dull.

Yes, there are moments of cinematic brilliance and the director seems to have spent far too much time capturing visual image than he has in actually putting together a half decent film.  The visual of the opening scene is brilliant as are a number of other scenes in the camping lodge however as I say, it just doesnt deflect from the utterly tedious nature of this film.

Defoe and his misses are buisy making love when their son climbs out of cot, opens the child safety doors to the bedroom and proceeds to fall out of the window, his wife has a nervous breakdown and Defoe being a psychiatrist decides that after seeing his better half spend over a month in an institution pumped full of drugs to take her back to the holiday lodge in the middle of nowhere to cure her of her melancholy state.  Unfortunately for Defoe he gets more than he bargained for as he soon finds out that his better half is in fact as mad as a box of frogs.

The problems with this film are numerous.  Not least that Dafoe has one of the most monotone voices on earth and has a personality that you simply cant relate to but also the fact that for the most part of the film its just him making boring notes about his wifes condition while he tries out various ""games"" To cure her (Such as curing her of her phobia of walking on the grass by putting two rocks on either side of the lawn and having her walk across)  Occasionally they have sex (Presumably this is the ""Sexually graphic bit"" But if Defoe wriggling around on top of some woman is your thing well, each to their own I suppose) and more and more Dafoe finds out about his better halfs dark side.  Things here go from bad to worse and the film spirals out of any coherent sense.  He finds pictures of his son with his shoes on the wrong way and confronts her that she has been doing this for quite some time causing him to have a deformity of the feet (Some may as why the hell didn't Defoe notice this, had he never put the kids shoes on or something? Had he never bothered to look at the kids feet or notice he was crying in pain?) It just smacks of middle class pretentious parents who quite frankly have never bothered to notice their own kids until they are gone.  He then finds various pieces of writing (And here comes the accusations of the film being misogynist) By her claiming women are somehow evil (Well this one is shall we say a little crazy) Defoe confronts her with this but within about 5 minutes probably wishes he hadn't and just jumped in the car and got himself home.

Then we have the gratuitous and utterly unnecessary violence.  Its probably on par with Audition in its graphic nature.  Loving wife proceeds to hobble Dafoe by drilling a hole in his leg and attaching a lump of concrete to it (As she doesnt want him to leave her.  Could she have not just paid for a nice night out at a restaurant instead?) It then just goes on and out as wife goes from slightly disturbed woman recovering from the loss of child to out and out loon bag.  The change is just too great to make any sense and you get the impression this is thrown in by a desperate director hoping for something to draw in the cinema going crowd.  The violence continues with the wife then cutting a piece of her own genitalia off with rusty scissors (Again why?) And Dafoe conveniently finding a wrench below the floorboards to get the concrete off his leg (Must remember to put one there myself, you never know) again this makes no sense.

I would imagine people who found films like 9 songs cinema at its best will love this dross but to be honest if I filmed paint drying in the back yard and told some people it was directed by someone with an East European name they would love it.  I read that this had a fair few positive reviews which to be honest just goes to show how far from reality and the cinema going world some of these people are.

3781468,2,B001RVPOPW,"Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier made waves at this year's Cannes Film Festival with his graphic and brutal film: Antichrist. Polarizing critics who either loved it or hated it depending on how they took the message of the film and the violence and mutilation, Antichrist became the talk of the town, even receiving an anti-award from the ecumenical jury which usually awards films for spiritual or humanistic values but awarded this film for it's misogynistic viewpoint. After all the controversy (even the movie poster has had scandal over it's content) I knew I had to watch this film.

Antichrist is a beautifully shot film. Von Trier, and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, have an eye for picturesque images that rival that of Kubrick. The opening scene which depicts the death of the child juxtaposed against the main characters (we never hear their names) making love is rich in cinematic beauty. Von Trier even goes as far as focusing on background items and making the innate appear ominous. The performances are also something to behold. Gainesbourg won the Best Actress award from the Cannes jury for her performance as a mother slipping into insanity from the grief that plagues her. You really feel where these actors take you, and their relationships. Gainesbourg and Dafoe breathe life into characters that don't really have much given to them.

But therein lies the problem, there's not much there. Trier, who was coming off a film that he felt was too mainstream and wanted to do something more ""arthouse"" so to speak, feels like he trying to hard at times to alienate and shock the audience. Largely dealing with Gynocide, the film does feel misogynistic as it turns toward the evil of women. But by and large the film fails to truly deliver any message, but becomes torture porn by the end.

That's not to say the film is unwatchable. I did enjoy it for the most part, it just feels as though it should have been better, or more clearly defined what the director was trying to get across. If you like controversial films I recommend you give this a try. But beware, there is a lot of graphic sex, violence, and even genital mutilation (they choose to go the route of having the movie Unrated to avoid an NC-17 rating).

3781469,3,B001RVPOPW,"Anitchrist is going to be one of those movies that one group of people will praise as a brilliant and innovative horror movie and the the rest will write it off as pretentious crap. I'm somewhere in the middle. ""Antichrist"" is a about a couple that are suffering from the tragic loss of their toddler son. The child's death is especially hard on the wife(Charlottle Gainsbourg) who falls into a deep anxious depression. The husband(willem Dafoe), who happens to be a psychotherapist, decides to treat her. After a few sessions, he discovers that her anxiety is heightened when she thinks about their cabin in the woods(I'm thinking that von Trier is an Evil Dead fan)called ""Eden"". So what's better than a little confrontational therapy? The couple set out for a little camping trip and things get progressively bizarre. As the plot thickens, we discover that ""She""(Dafoe and Gainsbourg have no names in the film) spent time in Eden writing her dissertation on the morbid subject of ""Gynocide""(I.e the murder of women) During her studies in isolation, she becomes obsessed and warped by the subject material, believing that woman aren't only the victims of evil but also a powerful source of it. She also becomes fixated on a fictional constellation called ""The three beggars"" which is comprised of a dear(grief),fox(pain) and crow(despair).The animals make their appearances in the films more disturbing scenes and come off as forest spirits demanding human sacrifice. ""Antichrist's magic is in its ability to build tension and its cinematography. von Trier uses a lot of extreme camera zooms into dirt and tree branches that are hauntingly unsettling. Many of the films more intense moments are shot like the characters are running through a hall of mirrors, which helps add to the feeling of disorientation and paranoia. Beyond that I felt that ""Antichrist"" didn't have much to offer. The plot was thin and there were times where a otherwise scary moment was ruined by something silly. During the film I knew there was a line that von Trier was dieing to cross(If you've seen ""Dancer in the Dark"" you know he likes to cross some lines). When that line came, and he danced over it, I felt that he built the whole movie around it and the rest of the movie was cheapened because of it. ""Antichrist"" is going to be remembered for those parts and that's a shame because I think that they where the weaker points of the film. Not for the squeamish, ""Antichrist"" is definitely a acquired taste. The taste of blood, wood and dirt.",1259884800,5,2525,4.874418604651162

3781471,1,B001RVPOPW,"This is a dumb, ugly, pointless film.

It begins with the pretentious slow motion black-and-white images set to an unrelated aria.  This sequence shows a couple's baby plummiting from a window.  What follows is Charlotte Gainbourg's character whimpering and banging her head against things for what feels like four hours.  At one point a fox looks at Willem Dafoe's character and says, ""Chaos reigns!"".  Does that actually mean anything?  I doubt Lars von Trier could tell you.  I don't think any of the forced symbolism of the movie has substantial meaning.  It's just Lars trudging through every threadworn arthouse cliche.

The movie culminates with Charlotte Gainbourg implausibly cutting off her own genitals with a pair of scissors.  A horrible scene basically included because it's a horrible scene.

Incredibly unpleasant for all involved.  Avoid.",1259625600,2,855,5.345864661654136
3781472,5,B001RVPOPW,"The film has two levels: psychological and religious.
To start from psychological level film is extremely symbolic. You hardly could find objects in the plot, that wouldn't be symbols. Forgive me for some ""personal"" view:  she (femininity), he (masculinity), child (with Nick -name - deep self), forest, Eden (unconscious), fox cave (very deep place of unconscious), fox, hind, raven, bridge in the forest etc, etc - better see vocabulary of symbols.
The film would be dull if it would be only psychological illustration of unconscious and its impact on human soul. But the very important suggestion of Lars von Trier is about the roots of evil, ""church of Satan"". Does it lay in unconscious? Does femininity is the part of human personality, which is the most exposed to Satan (evil). Eve is not woman who brings sin into the World, it is femininity, which resides both in men and women. This Goethe's praised femininity must be treated carefully, especially when it closely connected to unconscious. Sexuality in this case could be very dangerous collaborator with unconscious. It is archetypical feeling that feminine sexuality brings evil (some tribes in Africa cut off women genitals when they are still virgins to escape dangerous consequences of sexual behavior). At the end of the film She wants to imprison her ""masculinity"" and some women do the same thing with real men leading to fatal relationships.... Well, maybe unconscious is really the gates through which Antichrist is approaching us... These are some few thoughts on the film and please excuse me for my poor English.
P.S. Cinematographically film is worth to be dedicated to A. Tarkovsky.",1258675200,2,1659,5.121771217712177
3781473,4,B001RVPOPW,"A woman and a man lose their son in a tragic accident.  Rather than trust in the medicine prescribed by her psychiatrist to ease her grief, he (a psychotherapist) decides to subject her to his own therapeutic regime.  She (in an incredibly devastating performance by Charlotte Gainsbourg) will face her fears directly, and see that there is nothing to fear.  He doesn't consider that he may have something to fear from her, or that he, with his clinical detachment from feeling and incessant preoccupation with the stance of observer, may be the one who truly needs therapy.  (On that note it is hard not to detect a kinship of the themes of this film with the themes of von Trier and Jorgen Leth's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Five-Obstructions/dp/B0002KPI3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Five Obstructions</a>, that set up von Trier himself as therapist to Leth, whose capacity for aesthetic detachment he found troubling).

The imagery in the film is fascinating and frightening.  The prologue and epilogue are highly formalistic, shot in a series of powerful black and white images that border on the unreal; the rest of the film, broken into five chapters, is shot handheld with washed out but saturated colors, with rippling natural imagery and occasional freaks of nature that as a whole evokes a darker vision of Tarkovsky's zone (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stalker/dp/B000I8OOG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stalker</a>).  The film is in fact dedicated to Tarkovsky, and suggests a kind of inversion of his values and approach: whereas Tarkovsky finds in nature the potential for transcendence, suggested but not depicted, von Trier depicts in nature the reality of hell, a ""Satan's church"" where, as the fox asserts, ""chaos reigns""; where Tarkovsky takes long, leisurely tracking shots, von Trier's are a bit jerky and employ the occasional jump cut, but he also employs the trademark Tarkovskian slow zoom into extreme close up on a partial face or gesture.

The film has been described by several critics as suggesting that women are evil, and the setting in a woods they call ""Eden"" makes it hard not to see ""she"" (Gainsbourg) as a kind of twisted Eve figure whose longings and obsessions introduce evil and death into the garden.  Still, it seems to me that the central character in the film is ""He"" and the film uses him as an object lesson to provide a critical depiction of a paranoid male fantasy/nightmare.  ""He"" (played admirably by Willem Dafoe) is a therapist who is confident of his powers, and was obsessed by his job and detached from his wife and son until the accident allowed him to treat her as patient.  He had dismissed as trite her writing and research on misogyny and ""gynocide"" - hatred and violence against women, born of fear -- and was emotionally distant from her until now she became for him a fascinating object of study.  He becomes threatened and uneasy when she seems to have been cured, and seeks to continue the therapy by whatever means necessary.  What she really fears, he insists, is that the male fears about women that inspired the violence she had studied were in fact true, that women are in fact evil - and that she is herself the object of her fears.  When his projection onto her becomes real, when the fear he projected onto her comes to life, it becomes clear that this is his own paranoid fantasy, his own fear of aggressive female sexuality come to life allows him to justify and actualize the violent retaliation he had formerly only been able to realize against her in words, by objectifying and dismissing her.

It is as if, von Trier's film suggests, as if the modern version of the old male fear of the feminine, expressed then by accusing powerful women of witchcraft as a justification for doing them violence, as if this fear has been transformed or sublimated into the male pretense of objectivity.  An objectivity that treats women as if their fears and concerns were utterly banal, but only out of a deeper anxiety that if women were to realize that male objectivity is really a new form of witchcraft aimed at silencing women, if women were to realize this they would come into their own and that would be the real danger.  The film does not, as I see it, in any way endorse this view of women, or this fear, but depicts it powerfully in the form of a perverse parody.  Not for the timid, but not to be dismissed, either, as if it were merely another provocative and shocking joke by that Danish trickster, Lars von Trier.  It's a subtle and complex film, powerfully shot, darkly scintillating and dangerous.",1257465600,10,4682,5.025839793281654

The boy had a name. Why not give the main characters names? It's not like they can stand for every man and every woman. They are distinct, unique characters. If they had names we could reference them easier like Lois Lane.
It is not a good idea to take a toddler with you to a cabin if you plan to spend your time researching and writing. The husband is a counselor or therapist and he doesn't think it's strange that his wife spends her time with her studies while the toddler runs around alone in the woods and plays in the tool shed?
