5864639,3,B00DY64C8S,"This season is different. 1 moment was crazy. It was literally insane. The head of the prince was brutally, sadistically destroyed into pieces with lots of blood and sadism. It's like first the opponent which is a murderer and rapist breaks his skull just a little bit and then pushes his fingers deep into his eyes and finishes his head. It was extremely gory and just after that I was in shock. It was so believable, so extremely realistic. It was a few minutes and it was too much. Why show this? How could a director enjoy doing it and then re-watching it? I don't understand. As for the rest of the episodes, they didn't feel as special as 3 seasons before that. And the thing number 2 that I really disliked was that the character that played Daario Naharis. He was so cool and looked really awesome. Then in season 4, he leaves Game of thrones and another character takes his place (and he really looks not that good as the first guy was). Hate these 2 things. If not for them, I would have probably liked this season.",1406160000,6,1025,4.4
5864640,3,B00DY64C8S,"Another great season but whereas seasons 1-3 all featured blu-ray, UV, *AND* DVD in the box, season 4 is only blu-ray and UV.  Now I know many won't care about this change but it was incredibly useful to be able to watch the show with friends when many of them don't own blu-ray players of their own.  This just seems very cheap of HBO to exclude the DVDs from their blu-ray sets now.",1406073600,38,384,4.2465753424657535
5864641,5,B00DY64C8S,"Best season of Game Of Thrones yet. Covering the second half of A Storm Of Swords(Book 3) and some elements from A Feast For Crows(Book 4) and A Dance With Dragons(Book 5), Season 4 of Game of Thrones has many plot twists and action-packed moments to keep you on the edge of your seat and wanting more.",1405468800,3,302,4.315789473684211
5864642,1,B00DY64C8S,"Nerds & Geeks haven't been this excited by  the next chapter of an artistic creation since...well....maybe the last XBOX DownLoadableContent of Skyrim or some other similar sword & sandal pantomime fantasy game.
The much anticipated  follow up to last season's Much Ado About Nothing Part 3 sees all your favourite moustache twirling villains, six pack ab heroes, eye fluttering maidens & assorted obligatory naked models back for a fourth go around the old chopping block.
Who is who, where is where and who did what to whom is anybody's guess, and even if Jon Snow's weekender in Pompeii proved a bust, at least all that heightened prose can fool you into believing it must somehow be just... awesome. Failing that, there is always a weekend of Game Of Thrones dress-up to look forward to with your two or three friends.",1405468800,8,822,4.864285714285714

5864644,5,B00DY64C8S,"What a fantastic season of Game of Thrones this was! So much happened. Every season has one really big episode that everything builds up to, but this one had several. The acting was top notch, maybe the best since the show started. At first I didn't think Game of Thrones would have a chance at this year's Emmys since they're competing against last year's Breaking Bad finale, but then I saw Tyrion's trial. WOW, the emotion, the betrayal, the hurt, is all palpable. The Mountain vs the Red Viper fight was amazing, and the ending just as shocking as it was in the book. Arya and the Hound absolutely stole the show this season by the way. If they made a separate show just about them wandering the countryside murdering people, I would watch that show. The battle for the Wall was every bit as epic as the Blackwater, and let's not forget Daenerys and her ever more difficult to control dragons.

I also want to give a nod to Jack Gleeson. We all hated Joffery, which is kind of the point. The kid is a terrific actor to bring such a rotten little monster to life and make us all revile him so much. It was great to see the little turd get what he had coming, but in a way I think I'm actually going to miss him. He certainly brought something to the show in the form of a memorable villain.

I simply cannot say enough good things about this season of Game of Thrones.

Not much to say so far about the box set itself, but I LOVE the cover art). There are at least two deleted scenes thus far that we know of, and more of the typical extras. An interview with the man himself, George RR Martin, a look back at the effects that the Red Wedding had on the war in season 3, commentaries of course, a thirty minute documentary about the battle for the Wall, a look at some of the cast members and their character's deaths, and more history and lore from the books that the show skips over.

I'll update this review with more information when it's released, and of course when I have the box set in hand.",1405468800,198,2002,4.274406332453826

5864646,5,B00DY64C8S,"Season 4 is the best season yet, and I don't think it's close. A grip of elements fall into place: the complex storytelling, the pacing, the jaw-dropping twists, the phenomenal acting... Just hand Dinklage his Emmy already - sorry, Bryan Cranston. As well, fork another Emmy over to Pedro Pascal whose electrifying performance as the Red Viper merits him one. Season 3, watchable as it was, was still undermined by a catalogue of gone-nowhere-fast story arcs. Conversely, Season 4 seemed to hurtle by. The trademark big, visceral moments aren't withheld until the ninth episode but instead are sensibly spaced out. I loved the heady sense of forward momentum, never mind that, okay, Dany and Stannis were still essentially treading water in their storylines. Thankfully, Bran's scenes - which locomoted at glacier speeds - were kept to a minimum, even though this meant less Hodor. Incredibly, Season 4 ends with that rarest of things for this show: a tentative whiff of hope. That rousing, triumphant score - a tweaking of the theme song - that sends off a beloved GoT character as Season 4 called it a day, oh man, I want to download that version.

I was tidying up the other day when I came across an old, tattered scrap of paper on which I'd written a wish list for what I'd hoped to see for the fourth season of Game of Thrones. (Man, was I naive back then.) Here's that wish list - it comes with a huge honking SPOILERS ALERT:

- For Daenarys to mobilize her massive army to Westeros already, so she could commence to tearing sh-- up at Kings Landing
- A touching father/son bonding moment between Tyrion and Tywin, maybe during a spot of debauchery at Littlefinger's brothel? Oh, but hold up, Tywin is too classy for that
- Much as I like Sansa's hanging out with Tyrion, it's an icky marriage; I hope GoT avoids putting those two in a borderline ped0 relationship
- I am ba11s deep into Season 4's best and most charismatic new character, Prince Oberyn, who promises to monopolize the season's cheekiest lines; After the brutal gut punches of Ned and Robb Stark's executions, I am certain there's no way GoT would dare for the trifecta
- Please, some (or any) clarification of Bran's weird and boring dreams
- A few intense minutes of Ser Pounce batting around a ball of string
- Ygritte and Jon Snow's romantic ice-fishing honeymoon
- Arya and the Hound branching out into their own sitcom (maybe call it The Road to Moon Door Castle)
- More, please, of Tyrion and his sardonic bud, Bron, and their special tale of steadfast camaraderie
- ""The Rains of Castamere"" and ""The Bear and the Maiden Fair"" only whet my appetite for more ballads out of Westeros - more ditties, please
- Cersei Lannister for Mother of the Year

Not one of those panned out. So here's an alternate list, this one of takeaways and of life lessons as imparted by GoT Season 4 (and again huge SPOILERS alert):

- The only thing love and honor will get you is your teeth punched out and your skull graphically 'sploded
- The Hound really, really likes chicken
- Tywin has got no patience for elderly hype men
- Gods laugh at trial by combat; Arya laughs during those awkward moments
- When winning in a fight, go for the kill, son; DON'T take a page from those old wrestling shows and strut around and posture and hover over your fallen adversary
- also, refrain from Inigo Montoya impressions
- Poor old Ser Jorah - but at least he's done getting friend-zoned to death by Daenarys
- Tywin is now taking Khaleesi seriously
- a dire wolf makes the best pet/auxiliary killing device
- I wonder what other amenities the phrase ""Valar Morghulis"" will get you in Braavos? Maybe a free taco?
- Sansa is finally playing the Game of Thrones and is now being dressed by Cher's glam squad
- Must take up half the night before our little psychopath, Arya Stark, gets to go to sleep
- The only thing more scary than Westeros weddings are baths with Reek
- The sheer satisfaction of the Purple Wedding
- Ramsay Snow is a more depraved, more cunning, more formidable version of Joffrey
- It's super-hard to get a loan from the Iron Bank of Braavos... although absent body parts may grant you an extended audience with the loan officers
- We suspected it, but now we know: Jaime Lannister doesn't give a dusty f--- about rules
- At the Wall, Jon Snow's heart gets shattered by an orphan kid's bro nod
- The Wall is no place for sex ed talks
- Sam Tarly went for it; about time
- On Grey Worm's playlist - Pink Floyd's ""Empty Spaces,"" Air Supply's ""Making Love Out of Nothing at All,"" and Spike Jones' ""Yes! We Have No Bananas!""
- ""Pillar and stones"" - because there aren't enough euphemisms
- Who knew Tywin and Elvis had something in common? Or Brienne of Tarth and Mike Tyson?
- Those thinking that Arya didn't deliver the coup de grce because she didn't want to kill her friend haven't been paying attention
- No Lady Stoneheart, guys - maybe in Season 5

5864677,3,B00DY64C8S,"The discs are fine, however the packaging and the magnet are not what I expected. 1) The discs are stacked in order to fit a standard steelbook case. I'm not a fan of this, but I did select the steelbook edition. What I really do not like, however, is that the hubs are so tight I feel like I'm going to crack a disc each time I try to remove it from a hub. 2) The signet magnet is not anywhere near as good looking as it appears in the product image. In my opinion, it looks cheap (quickly hand-painted; The N in ""I AM A WATCHER ON THE WALL"" has a glob of white paint covering it) and the right side rim of the shield had a half inch long scalloped chip out of it.
I bought this because it would ship quickly, it cost just as much as the regular edition at Target, but this included a current digital edition, and I thought the magnet would be cool (not something that looks like it's from the ""dollar"" store. So, a star removed for the hub issue and another for the damaged, sub-par bonus item.
The series by itself, is a 5 star & highly recommended.",1525824000,,1052,4.086956521739131

5864817,5,B00DY64C8S,"F YOU ARE NOT WATCHING GAME OF THRONES SEASONS, YOU ARE MISSING OUT ON THE MOST AMAZING FILM EXPERIENCE EVER -- BETTER THAN ANYTHING YOU'VE SEEN IN THEATERS.

This series is a work of love, and it shows in the quality of acting, shot locations, studio sets, and writing.  Across the board, this is the best thing I've ever seen.  I am always glad to lend my GOT videos to friends (for short periods of time), and then I sit back and wait for their phone calls and love the chance to talk with them about GOT and to hear their reactions to story events.  When I get the videos back, I watch them all again.

Watching the GOT videos also enhances reading the books.  The books cover so many characters and events that it is difficult to process it all the first few readings.  The videos make it easier to keep track of characters in the book, because you have pictures of them in your head.  It is also easier to pick up additional information, because it stands out from info viewed in the videos.  It is also fun to reread the books to identify story events that differ in the book from the videos.

GOT IS ENGAGING IN WAYS NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED.  IF YOU ARE NOT WATCHING, YOU ARE MISSING A BIT OF HEAVEN ON EARTH.

This is a MASTERFUL series.  MUCH WATCH.",1515801600,4,1260,4.31063829787234

5864837,5,B00DY64C8S,"I'm a late bloomer to the fold. I picked up seasons 1-6 just last year and season 7 is on the way. I knew this was going to be a good ride just from the publicity and the talk but I don't always jump on the wagon until I'm ready...and having just finished S4 I can say with no reservations it was worth the wait. So many things can be said about this series, but there is really no need to for those that know what I mean. For the uninitiated, if one has time, watch this! So much going on and it covers pretty much every type of genre' one can pack into a show like this. You name it: drama, deceit, battles and war, mystery, action, sci-fi, adventure, swords and sorcerers, life and death, the setting and the scenery, love and loss...it goes on and on. And wine - lots and lots of wine! There are so many sub-plots it boggles the mind. You will find yourself hating the good guys and loving the bad ones. Just as soon as you think you've figured it out it will twist and turn out of nowhere. The acting is so good you forget they're acting. Some of the dialog is so subtle, dark, and sarcastic it makes your head spin. The set pieces, the background, the attention to detail and the SPEFX are so good you forget too that they are just show sets. Also important to note - if you're overly-sensitive or squeamish or easily offended, don't bother. This is an in-your-face, brutal and apathetic piece. Pay attention because there is a LOT going on here. Your emotions will roll. To make a long review short - this ain't your grandmother's soap opera!! - 'The night is dark, and full of terror.'",1513987200,,1593,4.260726072607261

5865054,5,B00DY64C8S,"I had trouble sticking wth this series at first because it is a bit gratuitously brutal. My favorite character (Maximus Of Gladiator reborn) is killed in the first few episodes, which made me angry, and the violence is almost too much to bear. The torture is particularly hard to watch. But I'm very glad my friends made me stick it out. The creativity and innovation in fiction George RR Martin and the filmmakers have shows is mind twisting and unbelievably fun.  There is a rich variety of languages, cultures, religions, locations (everything from an ice world to desserts), even differing British family dialects that make for an intricately woven tapestry of a distant universe--one with summers and winters that you never know the duration of (a phenomenon my scientist husband assures me is possible with planets that could have wonky orbits). The acting is not always Oscar worthy, but usually decent and sometimes outstanding as it is with Pete Dinklage who is the best, most noble part of the entire series, for all his drunken whoring. Well, I take that back. The BEST part of of the entire series is the absolute BAD ASSERY of the whole of the female line up from little Arya Stark to Lady Brienne of Tarth--an Arthurian-type knight who reminds me of Sir Percival so much, I keep expecting her to come up with the Holy Grail. Despite living in a Middle Ages-like setting, these women hold their own against misogyny, attempted and carried out rape, kidnapping, being held hostage, being bear bait, and torture. And they come out the other side with their enemies heads swinging by the hair. The coolest female character of all is the Mother of Dragons, one of the contestants in the game -- and, in my humble opinion, the most deserving candidate for the Iron Throne. I can only watch and wait to see if she is triumphant in her quest to rule the Seven Kingdoms. But wouldn't it be such sweet justice if a woman were to win The Game of Thrones?",1502668800,,1957,4.688953488372093

If they kill Pete Im gone. Seasons 1 and 2 of Fargo are way better than what Ive seen of GoT so far. Its good enough for me to want to finish what I started but not good enough to tell you its one of the best TV shows out there.

Thought the dwarf ""play"" after the wedding was a bit too long and quite stupid but the after wedding party had a great ending. Episode #9, (the Wildling battle @the wall), was the best episode.

However, with that being said, I did finish it because the story is phenomenal, the sets are amazing, the costumes are breath taking....and the acting is well pretty darn good...I was disappointed with the unnecessary pornographic sex and extreme violence. The story is so great and a lot of those situations could be ""implied"" rather than camera in your face stuff. I thought HBO could have told the story without all the graphic violence and still maintained a phenomenal fantastical story.  It could have been right up there with Lord of the Rings.....Unfortunately they chose to cheapen it.

Evidently others are having the same problem with these dvd sets from reviews I have read. Otherwise would have been 5 stars.

5865245,5,B00DY64C8S,Best Series ever to come from HBO.,1491868800,,34,4.0
5865246,2,B00DY64C8S,"For the show itself, 5 stars wouldn't be enough.  I think it's extraordinary.  But I'm rating the DVD sets here.  I purchased Seasons 1-6 as the separate sets, have watched them all and I'm just shocked and frankly angry at what poor quality these are.  The picture is just awful, particularly in scenes that are dark.  Think VHS quality.  I do not exaggerate. And it's every season, though oddly enough, some episodes are worse than others.

I really don't understand this.  I have many other shows on DVD, including HBO ones, and none of them are like this.  Muddy, blotchy, artifact-laden image quality, and sometimes even skipping.  For disclaimer's sake no, it is not my player, not my TV (I've tried them on a few players and screens), and these are the legit, licensed sets.

Then there's the packaging itself.  The ""fat"" sets that fold out with a disk on each page (versus the ""stacked disk"" sets) are also crap.  The plastic disk holders have a tendency to come unglued from the cardboard backings. I've heard others mention the same issue.  Again, I have other sets with a similar design and this doesn't happen with those.  What the heck is going on with the quality control where they're making these?  GoT deserves better.

Anyway, I can't recommend buying these.  And considering some of the problems I've heard with the BluRay disks, too (and my own negative experiences with BluRay players which makes me steer clear of converting over to that format), I'm not tempted to purchase again.  I'd recommend renting the shows instead and save your money, perhaps check a local library for them.  I may, in fact, donate my sets, as I'm not sure I could stand watching them again.

P.S.  Amazon, FFS, keep the different media and edition review sections SEPARATE!",1491609600,,1772,4.778877887788779

The case is metal and opens like a regular DVD case with only two sides instead of other GOT DVD cases that are foldouts. The problem I had with this case is that the discs were stacked on top of each other and, for me, the discs get scratched or damaged much faster being stored that way.

I have SO much regret for not watching it sooner! I just finished all available seasons, and I can't wait for season 7 to come out. There were moments of joy, sadness, shock and pure rage throughout every season. I can't recommend this enough!!

After adding new plot line after plot line, until it looks as if there is no real ending for it all, there is hope that all the loyal fans won't just be left with some crappy cobbled together finish, as we were in the tv series Lost. I was beginning to wonder if we would be abandoned in a similar way with this series. Now I'm more hopeful.",1485388800,,406,4.151898734177215

5866534,3,B00DY64C8S,"Game of Thrones has gotten predictable.  It's strong point at the start was its willingness to divert from a storyline, e.g., killing Ned, the good guy.  Now he is just predicable in continuing to kill the good guys.  So now the storyline is all about a predictable success for the intelligent and immoral.  A real dystopian view of humanity.  I can only play in the mud for so long before I want to see the beauty of life, which Game of Thrones never touches.",1481673600,2,460,4.428571428571429

I have watched/listened to excerpt from all seasons and am disappointed that HBO would produce this poor of quality commentaries.  Here is what you get in the commentaries.  Actors, producers and sometimes directors sit around (sometime without even ever seen the completed episode) talking about all the great restaurants in Spain, much laughter associated with inside on-set jokes, name-calling and stage banter that has nothing to do with the episode they are supposed to be commenting.

5866675,5,B00DY64C8S,I did not watch Game of Thrones when it first appeared on HBO in 2011. I have been binge watching seasons 1-4 for the last month or so. Season 4 is the best so far in my opinion!

5866976,5,B00DY64C8S,"What a fantastic season of Game of Thrones this was! So much happened. Every season has one really big episode that everything builds up to, but this one had several. The acting was top notch, maybe the best since the show started. At first I didn't think Game of Thrones would have a chance at this year's Emmys since they're competing against last year's Breaking Bad finale, but then I saw Tyrion's trial. WOW, the emotion, the betrayal, the hurt, is all palpable. The Mountain vs the Red Viper fight was amazing, and the ending just as shocking as it was in the book. Arya and the Hound absolutely stole the show this season by the way. If they made a separate show just about them wandering the countryside murdering people, I would watch that show. The battle for the Wall was every bit as epic as the Blackwater, and let's not forget Daenerys and her ever more difficult to control dragons.

I also want to give a nod to Jack Gleeson. We all hated Joffery, which is kind of the point. The kid is a terrific actor to bring such a rotten little monster to life and make us all revile him so much. It was great to see the little turd get what he had coming, but in a way I think I'm actually going to miss him. He certainly brought something to the show in the form of a memorable villain.

I simply cannot say enough good things about this season of Game of Thrones.

Not much to say so far about the box set itself, but I LOVE the cover art). There are at least two deleted scenes thus far that we know of, and more of the typical extras. An interview with the man himself, George RR Martin, a look back at the effects that the Red Wedding had on the war in season 3, commentaries of course, a thirty minute documentary about the battle for the Wall, a look at some of the cast members and their character's deaths, and more history and lore from the books that the show skips over.",1473811200,,1888,4.268156424581005

5867558,5,B00DY64C8S,"This TV show is both the poison and the antidote to a common life. I was but a naive child when I watched the first episode, but I am now an extremely mistrusting individual who expects every person in my life to be guilty of impending betrayal and constant dishonesty. I, myself, am now only 38% sure I am not a bastard, and the percentage was at least 45% before I started. Do not watch this show if you have a tendency to like anything that exists. At the start of season one, I enjoyed each episode with a small glass of pink Moscato to dilute the shock factor that is crammed into every pixel of the screen. After season 5, I now subsist on a steady diet of moonshine and mouthwash with a side of despondent atheism. I am broken; a wasteland of aborted hopes and dreams. Nothing can be trusted. Nothing should be loved. Nothing will be the same.",1468540800,2,850,4.285714285714286

5867585,5,B00DY64C8S,"I love this show. It's terrific in so many ways. The political maneuvering, the story arc, the acting and writing, the sets and costumes, and oddly I'm going to say the historical accuracy. And what I mean by that is I have heard some version of many of these stories directly from history. King kills his kids, kids kill the king or each other, king takes throne, kids wants throne, someone was poisoned because of this or that, all of it is in history and it's also here all connected by a coherent story line that pulls all these actions together in perhaps the most entertaining way I've ever seen. The golden age of television is now. It took 50-60 years for us to realize the problem with a movie based upon a book is that the movie takes place in 2 hours. A book can take 20-40 hours to read so they never quite match up. But television runs over multiple seasons and is basically an entire book with all the trimmings of cinema. This show takes full advantage of that and it's fun to watch.",1468281600,,998,4.342245989304812

The missing star is for the ""special edition"" case/product. As you can see in the picture, two of the tabs used to hold the Blu-rays were broken off. When I opened the box they were sitting in the bottom of the case. The Blu-rays are stacked directly on top of each other, two to a side. I'm not sure if the tabs were supposed to keep the Blu-rays from rubbing/damaging each other, but either way, they were broken...

The shield magnet that came with the special edition looks great! That being said, the actual magnet is extremely weak! It will stay on a refrigerator door, but don't expect it to hold up even a single sheet of paper:( The shield itself is a bit smaller than a credit card, but the magnet is about the size of a penny!

 MULTIPLE COPIES 
You technically get three different copies of the series:
1) Blu-ray (physical discs)
2) UltraViolet 1080p HD version (digital copy, HD only available on some devices)
3) iTunes 1080p HD version (digital copy)

The digital code gives you two digital versions (which is rare, and appreciated).

 STEELBOOK and MAGNET 
This steelbook has artwork designed by Elastic, the agency that created the Emmy Award-winning opening credits, and has a magnet on the cover that can be removed and used as a regular magnet, or left on to show off as a collector's piece. Each season represents one of the major houses of the series, and this season four steelbook doesn't represent a house, but the brotherhood of The Night's Watch of The Wall with its Raven sigil on the magnet. The steelbook is in a matching decorative plastic outer case that holds the magnet in place so it doesn't scratch the steelbook. Depending on how this was shipped, this plastic may or may not be cracked as I've seen a lot of cracked plastic cases with the steelbook intact.

 THE SHOW 
The show is greatin acting, in storytelling, in visuals, in music, and in writing. I've watched everything at least three times, and there are so many new things you see when re-watching, and with the knowledge of future episodes. The fourth season brings Dorne into the picture with the character or Oberyn Martell. We also see the players of the game switch places in terms of positions of power after the events of season three. There is also a trial, and a fight of the century in the second half of the season. If someone had recorded my reactions for this particular fight, I am pretty sure it would've gotten millions of views if you saw my reaction. The final episodes are epic in scale and prepares us for Winter.

I have converted many friends who previously used to think this was about ""dungeons and dragons and lord of the rings,"" (like I did) who are now *all* addicted to the show. If you don't already know, this show isn't about what you think it may be about.

This is currently THE only good show on television, and if you don't like it, you probably don't understand good television (sorry, not sorry). It has been the number one torrented show in every single year since it came out for a reason (which is a blessing and curse for the producers). After watching this, everything else on TV becomes: ""why I am watching all these other crappy shows?""

This is one of those series that I will buy the individual season sets, and whatever big box set comes out in the future. GAME OF THRONES! Recommended.",1465862400,5,2655,4.659528907922912

I simply can't say enough about the perfectly performed roles by all the actors/actresses! It's absolutely amazing how the characters come alive and will have you ultimately choosing which family should obtain the ultimate power and reign over the remaining kingdoms that they desperately try to defend or conquer. It's very easy to get caught up in the politics and decisions made by those already in power and the viewer is able to see how making the right choices can lead to their inevitable rise to great power or making the wrong choices can lead to their ultimate defeat and demise. This is the type of show that  I can watch over and over!,1465344000,,789,4.676258992805756

It is being handled by an amazing production company. The writers, directors, actors, all the designers, set designers, and all the people I don't even know about who have worked on Game are amazing in the flexibility they show moving between the various venues of the story line.

5868161,5,B00DY64C8S,"Season four Game of Thrones continues as the most epic medieval/fantasy genre series of all time as the royal families of Houses Stark and Lannister -- loosely based on England's Battle of the Roses (Houses York and Lancaster) during the 15th century -- continue to wage brutal war and cruelty on each other. Meanwhile, the White Walkers continue to build their Army that threatens The Wall, the Castle Black on Top, and the men who guard it -- while also posing threat to the Kingdom of the North beyond the Wall, while exiled Queen of the Dragons, Daenyres Targaryen, continues to become a legendary ruler in in the making in Mereen who will one day return to Westeros to re-claim the throne in her family's name. The acting is simply superb -- Academy Award in quality, every bit as good if not better than the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The stellar cast in my opinion is led by the funny, articulate, wise, indomitable Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister. The costumes, and the on-location sets are simply amazing. It is truly a show of the world featuring a world cast.",1464393600,,1073,4.652631578947369

5868383,4,B00DY64C8S,"Let's start with the extras--same as before you get the recap and preview plus commentary for each episode. On Disc 5 you get deleted scenes (zzzzz), not enough bloopers (only a couple of mins), another great roundtable with some of the actors (this time with ones who died off in Season 4) and a lengthy behind-the-scenes breakdown of the big battle scene at the Wall which is far superior to the actual battle onscreen.

Regarding that, although a lot is going on and the battle scenes between the people north of the wall and the Night's Watch do take up pretty much the whole episode, there are some serious flaws. Far too much is going on that it's hard to focus on anything. Then in the oddest editing in a series, that is so bizarrely edited from day one, one of the most important scenes shows a giant running down a tunnel and a group of Night's Watch behind an iron gate trying to stop this giant.

Then the episode cuts away. Eventually when we get back there once the entire battle is over in all these other locations. Then we see the giant and all the Night's Watch guys dead. Why would they not film and show how this battle went? It would've been far more interesting than the axe, sword, arrow and fist play in the castle courtyard which I fast-forwarded as it became too samey.

The weird thing is I found the action scenes involving Bran Flake's storyline where the White Walkers pop Lillehammer 1994 Winter Olympic Closing Ceremony style up out of the snow-covered ground and attack like crazed wombats way more fun and scary than the ""big"" battle at the Wall.

Having said all this, I'll say Season 4 finally gave us death for its buck. We get rid of many annoying characters in often superb death scenes. There's far more fleshing out of the grand scheme of things. I still feel as if the Queen of The Dragons' storyline is off on some other world that basically never touches Westeros at all. Honestly, get this moving and get her, the dragons and the Unsullied doing battle for King's Landing as well toute de suite.

Anyhoo, those of you without the time, I'd highly recommend watching Plate Of Scones as follows: Watch Episode 1 in every season then skip right to Episodes 8 thru 10. It most likely will be far more interesting to use your imagination as to how who got where, who is that and why are they so annoying than to sit through entire seasons that plod in many parts especially the wandering around the dreary North. Given I've been sucked in and now have to see how things end (plus have even read the Wiki pages on what's going on now in Season 6 as I don't truly care about spoilers at all to be blunt), I just want the pace to quicken. I get the story needs to unfold at a medieval pace but sometimes it seems more glacial. Even White Walkers on glaciers move faster than this TV series.",1462579200,,2827,4.428846153846154

It had already been out for some time and I was able to binge watch (which is always good for me). Let me tell you, I was hooked. I love the intricate characters, the ever changing story and multiple plot lines. You are never bored watching this show.

I will say that if you are an emotional TV viewer, such as myself (I am a cryer and get connected easily with characters) you will find yourself in tears, raging mad and upset throughout the show. The point is, it is a good enough show to draw you in and make you part of the experience.

This show has left me soaring, left me sad, made me angry, made me cry, made me laugh, made my day. It is thought provoking and entertaining all at the same time. Love it.",1460937600,,802,4.069620253164557

<Spoiler>

For example:

Tyrion killed his father, not because his father had always hated Tyrion. It was because Tyrion found out that Tywin had arranged Tyrion's first marriage, and prevented Tyrion from seeing Shae. Tyrion was ready to run away from the castle until he found out some things about this first marriage and wanted to hear it straight from his father. I hated that scene. The screenwriters should have stuck with the book on that most important detail.",1459382400,,733,4.7109375

If you are buying it on Blu Ray then it doesn't come with DVD copies. I ordered seasons 1-4 in June of 2015 and oddly then only season that came with Blu ray and DVD was season 3. All other ones were only Blu ray. All 4 of them did come with Ultraviolet codes which was the primary reason I bought them. The case that holds the disks holds them well and makes sure none of them would get scratched. Put together really well so if your thinking about getting this series on Blu ray then I would recommend it.

So the case is badly dented and bent. I've only just opened it so haven't played more than one disk. Will update if they are damaged.

I of course was very sad for the Dragons and loved however that we are seeing in this 4th Series that it is bringing some pieces into understanding.  Wished we had more info on the Three eyed Raven...and the Magical Tree and why the children have had to go there.  This family has these changling ways and with this some powers seem to NOT be in others of their Family....loved all the magical parts.

The ten episodes speak for themselves and the extras are interesting and informative.  Game of Thrones is a series you need to follow and think about the relationships between the characters and houses.  This is the first series I can remember that is bold enough to kill off the pre-eminent characters and move on from season to season.  That bravery makes the progression of the series surprising and unpredictable. Enjoy the journey!",1446768000,,612,5.07

5870109,5,B00DY64C8S,"Lord of the Rings for grownups. Brilliant writing, casting, cinematography, costumes, set design, special effects and acting. Totally immersive. Some of the best written dialogue -- much of it witty and laugh-out-loud funny -- ever to appear on any screen of whatever size. Shot with the verve and scale of a Hollywood Technicolor movie of old. A lot of swordplay, grizzly deaths, bloodshed and sex. But all of it excellently choreographed and photographed, with much of the action being unexpected and engrossing. G.O.T. is a fully realized alternate time, place and world. And it has lots of smart things to say about power, politics, ambition, the human heart and the human species capacity for both cruelty and nobility. Also, the supernatural creatures (White Walkers, e.g.) are vivid and realistic, and the dragons, onscreen neither too much nor too little, are freaking awesome!",1446336000,,885,5.23943661971831

Spoilers follow...

We see Arya head across the sea.  The Queen of Dragons does not invade Westros, but the Iron Throne is well aware of her.  Sasha is with Little Finger in the Aerie.  Tyrion gets in more than a bit of trouble.

5870724,3,B00DY64C8S,"WARNING: Two spoilers included here. One specific one, and one general one.

Because of the enormous amount of details which are involved in Game of Thrones as a TV series, there is no way to do a detailed write-up on Game of Thrones. So, instead of trying to evaluate this TV series by its raw details, I will evaluate it in a holistic, summarized sense.

I was drawn to Game of Thrones because, from what I understood about it at the time, it seemed to offer richer lore and a richer plotline, which was more developed like Lord of the Rings was, in its own way. So, in response to this appearance of it, I sat down and buckled up to watch it in hopes of an epic tale.

I watched and followed this show, through the end of its fourth season. In doing so, I followed the roller coaster ride of its regular plot twists and turns, with contentment with them, in and of themselves, for a while. Individual scenes in them are done with an immersive, well-rounded, detailed environment, immersive, flowing drama, and well-defined, memorable characters. But, as I did so, I increasingly looked around the tracks of this roller coaster ride for its central narrative, its central direction or its central struggle, and the like. I asked, was there a sunset, a midnight, and a sunrise of some sort, under which all the figures, reflections, and shadows of its characters operated in relation to? If so, then where was it?

But, oddly and frustratingly, I never found any. For instance, winteras in the teased invasion of the White Walkers in southern Westerosnever came as a grand, unifying plot. It kept being put off, as always. Instead, I observed that good and bad characters alike randomly schemed and died in whimpers. Heroic movements and tyrannical powers alike randomly flourished and fell to ruin. Supernatural or magical forces, as in the ones which actually appear, randomly creep unfettered according to their own selfish, cruel wills. And, in the meantime, brutality, rage, greed, sexual desire, drunkenness, gossip, manipulation, politics, and so on remained as the only fundamental, consistent aspects of reality in Westeros, under the general principle of, Let us eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die. Thus, in light of this, I disappointedly concluded that, though physical sunrises and sunsets graced the land of Westeros, darkness consistently rules Westeros in its essential ways of operating, under a medieval form of Lovecraftian Cosmic Indifferentism and Humanistic Egotism. Put another way, I found that Game of Thrones is, at best, a dark reflection of the Lord of the Rings, where J. R. R. Tolkiens themes, moral philosophy, and cosmology, which were inspired by his Catholic faith in a positive way, have been apparently replaced by George R. R. Martins more brutally naturalistic viewpoint, as a lapsed Catholic. Interesting parallel, no?

Moreover, from what I understand, Season 5 actually got worse! Apparently, it is downer after downer, even in terms of its regular plot points and twists now.

Once I saw the essential senselessness of the universe of Game of Thrones, I lost the desire to keep watching it. After all, why watch, if there is no particular, ultimate good thing to look forward to and feel good about in it? Whats left? Sex, violence, and so on, just for its own sake? Drama, just for its own sake? Chaos, just for its own sake? Certainly, if I wanted to get depressed, then I could watch real world news for free and get the same result!

So, in short, Game of Thrones does exceedingly well on the smaller things in the Game of Thrones universe. But, as you zoom out and progressively get into the bigger picture of the Game of Thrones universe, Game of Thrones increasingly falls apart in its quality as being based on bad, unfocused, depressing writing.",1441497600,8,3808,4.849230769230769

Peter Dinklage's Tyrion is hilarious and scathing, Breane is far more homely than I imagined her (beautiful actress, homely character), ... The settings are what I imagne when I read the books as well. I am looking forward to completing the series, both in book and television formats. I don't even mind that there are deviations between the two, so long as HBO's 'edits' do not detract from the story, I think they are a fine alternative take on the story.",1440720000,,749,4.555555555555555

5871112,4,B00DY64C8S,"Brutal, harsh, gritty, graphic, violent, sexual violence.

I realize that the author of the books and the producers of the show put the sexual violence there because it's a matter of harsh reality that where there are males and females, there is sexual violence. Still, lost a star for sexual violence due to how strongly I feel about the subject. Wish it wasn't part of the books or the show.

Same as the other seasons. As true to the books as can be. Thought that the last scene with Arya could have been done better.

Love the costumes, the locations, Peter Dinklage (as Tyrion Lanister), and Gwendolyn Christie (as Brienne of Tarth).",1439424000,,638,4.678571428571429

5872001,5,B00DY64C8S,"Enjoy the job (hahaha yeah right), pain, humiliation, and gratuitous nudity and violence over and over again in this visual masterpiece by HBO.  This DVD set is just like the other three you probably ordered on Amazon already (or if someone loves you, were given as a gift). If you read the books or not it doesn't matter because coming season 6 we will experience complete fear and confusion at the unknown as we wonder why season 5 is not on DVD yet because we need to yell at Stannis and analyze that last scene over and over.",1435708800,,529,4.3979591836734695

5872014,5,B00DY64C8S,"What can I say? I'm really like the Game of Thrones and have read all the books currently available. This ambitious and epic undertaking is filmed in multiple countries and is really a series of parallel stories linked across the theme of a struggle for power and the throne of the Kingdom of Westeros. It is definitely not recommended for children as it contains graphic violence and sex set against the backdrop of a fantasy, medieval world where armies clash, dragons fly, and evil undead warriors gather to strike against the kingdoms of men.
The performances are riveting. The settings, landscapes, and stories that are revealed are universal and compelling. There is something in this series for everyone. Don't miss a single episode!
Season 4 roughly parallels the 4th book in the Game of Thrones series and advances the storyline further. We continue to be immersed in the characters explored in Seasons 1-3. If possible, Season 4 holds even more surprises, action and drama than the previous seasons. The fascinating development of the storyline takes the viewer from desperate battles between armies, intrigue behind the throne room, and struggles for power. If you're already a fan of Game of Thrones, you'll want to make sure you add this set to your collection.",1435708800,,1274,5.014150943396227

5872117,5,B00DY64C8S,"I love HBO release of Game of Thrones Blu Ray sets.  All the previous sets have been great and this one too is awesome. But there's one thing that's missing from this Season 4 release compare to the earlier 3 seasons.  There's no longer DVDs included in this one.  Yeah, you can say DVD doesn't matter since you have the Blu Rays.  But the benefit of DVDs are you can watch the show when the Blu Ray player isn't available. And the DVD has multilingual subtitles (whole lot of other foreign languages beside in English/ Spanish/ French) which the Blu Ray discs don't have. This doesn't matter to those who understands English or Spanish, but for those who are fan of the show and have hard time understanding it, it matters. For instance, my dad is a fan of the show.  He got to enjoy it even more with that extra DVDs that came with the previous Blu Ray sets. He understood it lot better with Korean subtitles.  Oh well, I guess I might have to find another set for my dad with a Korean subtitle, if there's one.  I still give this 5 stars though.",1435190400,,1048,4.316326530612245

5872257,5,B00DY64C8S,"Lady Stoneheart- where art thou??? That's really my only disappointment with this season. I expected the deviations from the book but I was really hoping for this one to make it through. It still might  crossing my fingers. The royal wedding was amazing and such fun to see. Despite my hatred of Cersei, I really like how the show's writers emphasized her overarching love for her children, making her sympathetic despite her villainy. However, I really question the sex scene which the show turned into a rape scene instead. I'm not sure what they were going for there. Even more sympathy for Cersei ... or to go in line with the fact that she is such a devoted mother she would never want sex so soon after her son has died. But then why include a sex scene at all? Is it just for shock?

Tyrion was outstanding in this season  yet again. His speech at the trial and the last episode just about broke my heart. Peter Dinklage, you are still the man!

I have to give it to Pedro Pascal  he was simply magnetic as the Red Viper. I really dreaded the trial by combat knowing what was going to happen but holy moly, the show managed to surprise me and utterly gross me out even so. Definitely one of the most memorable scenes of all time. There is no lack of creativity here.",1434585600,,1273,4.377118644067797

I was only purchasing digital media content from iTunes, but since we got a smart TV and it had it's own built-in Amazon Video app, I took a chance and bought this season of ""Game of Thrones"" on it. For reasons, which I am not completely sure, I always wondered if the 5.1 audio surround would truly be supported by the HDMI port that went directly from our AppleTV to our television. The TV does have a digital out cable, but it goes directly from the TV to the Sonos sound bar.

I was very pleased as to the video quality and sound! Very pleased! The jury is still out as to whether we need to purchase an amp to separate the digital 5.1 surround for other HDMI components connected to our TV.

5872721,5,B00DY64C8S,"Production values extraordinarily good. Story is carried forward with clarity and intelligence. Divergences from the books are generally constructive and tend to help the inattentive through the maze of storylines. Physical set is missing a non-Blu-Ray copy, which is a pity. Enjoy this season as the writing mid way through season 5 is crashing. Benioff & Weiss complained in an interview that writing ten fifty minute episodes each year is ""so hard."" Their answer appears to be: more salacious violence (like there isn't enough already) in Westeros; incomprehensibility in Mereen, and just plain slapstick comedy in Dorne.

GOT has been the more thoroughly enjoyable television series I've ever watched and I go back to early black and white days (as in ""I Love Lucy"", ""Dick Van Dyke"",""Gunsmoke"", etc).

Development starting on second and third generation people giving us interest in future episodes and series. Hopefully at least 8 seasons. Aya is changing, Kalisi maturing, some characters have 'bit the dust' too bad. Still my favorite actor and character is Tyrian ....such a great actor!  So far I have been only disappointed in season 2, and am rewatching it to see if I missed something and have undervalued it. Perhaps season 2 will make more sense to me now that plots have progressed and some characters dropped out. Please, not too much in the way of flashbacks...they can be overdone and can convey little.
Series 4 still feels far away from the ultimate clash between feared Northern Walkers and/or other terrors and clashing kingdoms of the South.",1431907200,,857,5.16546762589928

This is a big deal for because I've purchased the prior seasons in this format and it sucks that they can't be consistent with the product line.

2. There's no Amazon VOD option for the Digital Copy.

5873034,4,B00DY64C8S,"The whole Game of Thrones televised series hovers in a realm where it could be tripe if produced badly but is brilliant because it is produced and acted to an extremely high standard.  Personally, I find that Season 4 feels a teensy bit shallower than previous seasons; I think the plot content that had to be covered was so large that the performances were forced to be slightly less nuanced than in seasons 1-3.  That said, I still loved every minute of it, and I respect the difficult decisions involved in translating such a HUGE literary opus onto screen.  It is an intriguing experience when the book version and the televised version of a work diverge from each other even though they are alike in spirit.  I appreciate how much more detailed the books are, but I actually feel that there are ways in which the televised version achieves a few moments of more incisive character exposition than the books on which it is based.  Overall, it's a win-win situation for all concerned: author, readers, creators of the tv series, and viewers.",1431302400,,1044,4.714285714285714

A decade or so later, after having read the series multiple times, I saw a very quick commercial on HBO and nearly lost it.  HBO has done an outstanding job with the casting and writing. It has remained fairly true to the books and done a pretty good job getting the story across for those that have not read the series.  Of course the readers know that our favorite writer likes to elaborate and can go into a lot of detail.  The seasons would have to be 20 to 25 episodes to include everything.
I'm always going to recommend reading the books first; but the show absolutely can stand on its own.",1431216000,,718,4.226277372262774

5873246,4,B00DY64C8S,"HBO's (Author George RR Martin's) Game of Thrones: Seasons 1 thru 4 are generally very well done material. Season 3 is very good because we see some more broader advances with the characters. Young actress Emily Clarke is fantastic, and she is absolutely gorgeous. Her character Danni Kolisie Tardarian ""The Dragon Queen"" is the only character besides Peter Dinklege's ""Tyrian"" that I really ever cared about at all. In fact I love Emily Clarke as the ""Dragon Queen"" the most. She has a ""Queen Victoria"" presence behind her character.

 What I really like about the show is it's Shakespearian themes, tied with a little ""Braveheart"", and some ""Lord of the Rings"" elements, but most of it is focused on individual character development alone & their relationships with other characters more then any grandiose geo-political goal (such as what ""Braveheart"" had been all about).

 I recommend seeing it, but ultimately you may come to the same conclusion I have, that there are just too many characters and the plotting goes on and on with very little satisfying action in between.

 The Dragons really do not do much until Season 3 and 4, and even then she doesn't use them enough for my taste.

And ultimately this is what the crux of the problem I have with this franchise in general, unlike lighter sci fi fantasy franchises like ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Conan the Barbarian"", & ""Star Wars"", or even historical genres like ""Braveheart"" & ""Gladiator"", this very long and very violent epic has no real ethical core nor provides us with solid characters with real souls (except the Dragon Queen or Peter Dinkledge) that operate in this dark medieval hellish world. In all honesty, I really only skip to the scenes of her alone now, occasionally checking on Tyrian but not liking any of the other characters and wishing them all a nasty death scene!

 With the only exception of Emily Clarke, I don't like nor care about these immoral and savage characters, and eventually get disgusted on how they behave and act in this sinister cruel world of kill or be killed. The torture, both physical and mental, sadism really doesn't stop nor have any point, nor does the constant sexuality with out any real romance nor responsibility.

 These characters are always at each others throats, plotting to damage and destroy, and to no end in sight. There is NO decent nor morally good side to this series, just about everyone is a villain and every tone of this show is a dark and depressing one. Sean Bean's good character lasts for about a few of the first episodes, then off with his head.

 We get teased here and there about the ""White Walkers"", these snow zombies who are trying to invade from the outer wall, but then again very little there happens either except an occasional run in. I for one wanted to see a major battle between these creatures and the kingdoms, but instead we have more in fighting and a big yawn.

 Another major complaint I have is we want to see some climatic combat, we want the bad characters and their kingdoms overthrown but instead all we get is the Dragon Queen roaming around the other continent fighting small loser kingdoms, and no direct action against the Lanisters or anything. Literally nothing happens. Over all a very slow moving series with a ton of sex scenes in-between.

 There is a lot of excellent entertainment value in all of the GOT episodes, and I do look forward to the newer seasons but I wish there where some loose ends that get tied up quicker. A- & two thumbs up for GOT.",1430611200,,3518,4.703583061889251

5873365,4,B00DY64C8S,"Brutal, harsh, gritty, graphic, violent, sexual violence.

I realize that the author of the books and the producers of the show put the sexual violence there because it's a matter of harsh reality that where there are males and females, there is sexual violence. Still, lost a star for sexual violence due to how strongly I feel about the subject. Wish it wasn't part of the books or the show.

Same as the other seasons. As true to the books as can be. Thought that the last scene with Arya could have been done better.

Love the costumes, the locations, Peter Dinklage (as Tyrion Lanister), and Gwendolyn Christie (as Brienne of Tarth).",1430265600,,638,4.678571428571429

I understand that certain things need to be changed when you adapt a book to a movie or series, and in the earlier seasons it was understandable, but the changes in season 4 seem to go beyond that. I've read all the books 3 times and I'm more of a book person anyway so I'm easily upset when the adaptation strays too far from the original... so don't take me too seriously.

The characters also are complex enough that I hated Jamie Lannister in the first season and now have grown to like him.  This season proves there are way worst families out there than the Lannisters (scary as that is).  My favorite story arcs from this season include Daenerys (as ever) with her growing ability to be a Queen and her focus on freeing all slaves.  Also, shockingly, the relationship between Arya and The Hound.  The introduction of Oberyn...I found him fascinating right off.  But the star of the show continues to be Tyrion and his trials (in this season, quite literally).  Beautiful scenery and clothing, great acting, terrific plot...can't wait for the next season!",1429142400,2,1051,4.948571428571428

If there is less sex, then the violence seems to have no let up. Episode 5 has a graphic gross out scene. Not that the guy didn't deserve it, I suppose, given the premisses of the show, but still.

Spoiler alert: I was waiting for the mad, inbred 13 year old old king's deserved demise, and I was shocked that it occurs so early and is so surprising. The Red Wedding on Season 3 seems to find a math in the Purple Wedding of this incarnation.

Show of course is great, many stars.  Just don't buy the HBO DVD.  I sure wish I hadn't.  Very disappointed, will never buy DVDs made for this series, and won't buy anything HBO unless I find it in a thrift shop, lest I make this expensive mistake again.

You might do well to buy an Amazon Instant Video version, I don't know.

This show is so great, it deserves better DVD manufacture than whoever was the dufus DVD house HBO used.  Shame on them.",1428624000,2,859,4.483870967741935

5874149,5,B00DY64C8S,"I started reading George R. R. Martin back in the mid 1990s; the story line and characters really caught me. I never expected to have the opportunity to own such a well done rendition of this Tolkien like saga. I have heard that the actors don't talk to anyone ""killed off""; Martin seems to kill off more of his major characters than any author I have experienced. This is definitely five star material.
  I was surprised that I received two copies of the set; I placed this order on my Kindle and I could have make a mistake. I was attempting to type in my gift card alphanumerics and was booted from the page. Besides not getting my gift card recognized, I ended up with a second copy. No problem, I gave the second copy to my daughter, who is also a fan. I mentioned this situation in case others are having this problem.

5874191,4,B00DY64C8S,"Although I enjoy the ""Game of Thrones"" series there are some aspects of Season 4, that I did not like, chief among them is the new actor playing ""Dario Naharis""  to me he lacks that certain devil may care charm that the first actor brought to the role and was more in keeping with the character.  This new actor is wooden, exudes no charm or charisma whatsoever.  Remember Dario Naharis is described as a ""Flamboyant Tyroshi Sellsword.  Secondly - Stannis coming in after the battle was very anti-climatic and to me it did not work, it was quite flat.  His coming to the rescue would have been better, if you could not afford a second battle, have him come to the rescue during the first.  I think the writers need to look over the books, because there is a reason why, despite the many characters, convoluted plots, and to some extent boring drawn out stories the books are read.  Take Tyrion for instance in the books by downplaying his first wife, the passion and the reason for his killing his father was missing.  He never got over the loss of his first love and to learn from his beloved brother that she really loved him and was not the whore he was lead to believe and what was done to her.  That dear readers is what would lead someone to kill.  The final straw that broke the camel's back, after years of rejection etc...  The fight scene with Brianne of Tarth and The Hound should have been left out altogether. Hated it and thought it was pointless.  The fight with the Viper and the Mountain was good.

Anyway I think Jon Snow is the son of Lyanna Stark and Robert Baratheon.  He has the right colouring for  it.

But don't let the negative criticism turn you off, I am just hoping in changing some of the events in the books HBO does not loss some of the things that made the books.

Overall excellent selection of actors for the parts.  We all loved the ""Viper"", and was sorry to see him go.",1428451200,,1906,4.3664772727272725

5874475,5,B00DY64C8S,"Game of Thrones season 4 Blu-Ray:

Once again I review this massive TV production without comparing it to the books [which I don't intend to read], but as a stand-alone media experience.

I wasn't at all sure when I began this series whether I would like it, let alone my wife who is much more reluctant both with fantasy-type stories and stories of war and violence.  However once again, we both watched season 4 all the way through with much interest.  As anyone looking at this series must know by now, there are two major story lines (along with many minor ones): first a complex struggle between a number of great families over who can assume and retain the iron throne which seats a king at least nominally ruling over all 7 kingdoms comprising the great bulk of the civilized world.  The other story line involves the onset of winterwhich in this world is an ominous event.  This world must have some very complex rotation around a multiple-star system, because both the onset and the duration of winter are difficult to predict in advance.  Sometimes it seems to last the equivalent of a year or so; other times it might last a decade.  And in addition to the cold and darkness and therefore the difficulty growing crops, there are other problems.  Wild peoples from the far north, fleeing the intense cold can threaten to overrun large parts of the civilized world.  Lastly, in one of the magical twists in this fantasy world, it also brings out white walkers, which seem to be risen dead, or at least raisers of the dead, or both.  [So far, the TV series has not explained their meaning in detail, though theyve been seen on occasions, and are often referred to]  To defend against these twin threats the seven civilized kingdoms have established a huge wall of ice blocking off the far north, which is manned by an almost-egalitarian society of castouts from all lands, for every conceivable reason, who take vows to defend the wall, and with it the civilized lands, for the rest of their lives.

The fantasy elements of this series, while they no doubt appeal to some viewers, do not by any means overwhelm more realistic struggles between the kingdoms and their noble families, or the nuanced portrayals of individual characters, keeping this interesting even for those uninterested in fantasy.  A couple of the other fantasy elements seen in the first 4 seasons are dragons (one character controls the only 3 known to exist now, which seem to be adolescent-sized in this season) and the shaman-like ability of a few people to project their minds into the minds of animals, or even simpletons among people.

One of the mottos in the story, valar morgholis, translates apparently into all men must die, and puts into perspective the loss of some characters in each season.  It reminds us in real life, that we should be less concerned that we die, or how we die, than what we have made of our lives, and how we will be remembered afterward.

There are other aspects of this series worthy of respect.  Yes, the characters can loosely be sorted into good and evil.  But rarely are they two-dimensional.  One can see the character flaws in almost all the good, and some admirable aspects in almost all the bad.  Looked at closely, it reminds us that real life is seldom black and white, but admixtures of grey.  And when a character does die, one can usually trace it back to a particular character flaw or a bad decision earlier which contributed to their later demise.

To me the story has obvious resonance with the world of today.  While leaders spend much of their time on competitive issues like trade and job balances, how much Irans nuclear program can be reined in, Russia vs. Ukraine, competition among China, Vietnam Japan and the Phillipines over control of ocean regions, nobody is doing very much about issues which threaten to overwhelm all of us, like rising temperatures and ocean levels, severe droughts and hurricanes, over-population and resource depletion.  We become so caught up in short-term struggles that we fail to confront the much bigger long-term issues [in this story, the oncoming winter] which threaten all of us and require a strong joint response.

The production values in this series are very high and I certainly hope they make a good profit worldwide, which apparently they are.  Otherwise its hard to sustain such expensive productions.  Great costumes, beautiful outdoor scenes, lavish palaces, fine actors and actresses, large casts for battle scenes, all take a toll and all contribute to a rich visual story experience.  Even the opening sequence is so beautifully done, with both exquisite graphics and music, that I almost always watch it all the way through, just to savor the experience.  As for plot twists of the latest season I don't want to give away anything too important, but will say that Peter Dinklage who plays the dwarf Tyrion of House Lannister, continues to be a scene-stealer, who remained very active this season to my great pleasure.  Probably the two most likeable characters that have persisted through all 4 seasons to date are him and Jon Snow, a bastard son of Ned Stark of the northern kingdom, now stationed on the huge defensive north wall.  Emilia Clark as Daenarys Targaryen, the woman with the 3 dragons, continues accumulating a slave army in the south, but might have made her first major mistake in dismissing her longest-serving and most loyal supporter, after learning that he started out being paid to spy on her (and in her sense of betrayal overlooking that he subsequently fell in love with her and was perhaps her most loyal and a very experienced advisor).  There was a brief firestorm of controversy whether the TV series was disrespectful to women with depictions of rape.  I didn't find it so.  Yes, there are such depictions, but there is plenty of male-on-male violence, and overall I'd have to say the violence is equal-opportunity.  Second, throughout much of human history rape along with child abuse, murder and warfare has been all too common, and in that sense it is ""true to life"".  Third, there certainly are some very strong (physically and mentally) female characters in this series, fully a match of any of the men.  In season 4, these women are stronger than ever.  At times the degree of violence bothered me, but these were usually brief, bloody male-violence scenes.  Lastly, there are plans for a season 5 and six, and just possibly a 7th, so there will be many more episodes yet to enjoy

The specials of season 5 were not too impressive for me.  They were mostly concentrated on discs 1 and 4 and included just 2 short deleted parts of scenes, a few bloopers, a review of the new characters and locations introduced this season, and a group interview with actors and actresses who made their exit from the series this year.  For me the value of owning the Blu-Ray in this case is not so much the special features but the ability to pause at any point, go back, turn on subtitles, etc.  I must say its a well-done story.  Comparing to other fantasy series, its far more adult and serious fare than the Harry Potter series.  Compared to the grand-daddies of them all, The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit (each having become a 3-story series), it has less fantasy elements and a closer resemblance to our own world before the industrial revolution.  Once again I liked season 5 very much and would rate it A-.",1427932800,11,7426,4.752143413873734

5874573,5,B00DY64C8S,"Richly exotic and intense, GAME OF THRONES never disappoints and always keeps the view guessing. Lavish costumes and luscious settings make this HBO TV series outshine even the most expensive Hollywood film production. There is nothing else like it on TV or on the big screen. GAME OF THRONES is a winner on every level. That being said, GAME OF THRONES can get awfully confusing with all of its characters and their unusual names. Don't forget all the alliances and wars and intrigue. Fans of the book series may be able to follow all the plot lines and character names but be prepared to be confused - in a totally good way. Watching the series on DVD can add to the confusion just trying to keep up with what happened the previous season.
THE GAME OF THRONES is an epic of massive proportions with a cast of thousands and locations across the globe. The beauty is astonishing. How HBO does all this on a budget is astounding.  The settings have a medieval feel with castles and knights. Some locales are lush and colorful but the dark, night settings only add to the atmosphere.
Season  4 seemed to have a slow start but maybe it's all about getting back into the GAME OF THRONES mind set. Here is also a series that is not afraid to shock and upset viewers. Expect the death of at least one major character and the demise of several lesser but important characters. No one dies of natural causes in this series.  As we learned last season, beware or weddings! Prepared to be amazed in episode 9 THE WATCHERS IN THE WALL as the Night Watch fights an attack by the wildlings. Here is one amazing battle scene unlike any others filmed before.

5874601,5,B00DY64C8S,"I originally bought Season 1 for myself, as my wife wasn't interested in a midevial fantasy.  I left for work, and she decided to watch it.  That was the end of her disinterest.  She went into a Game of Thrones marathon mode for each season.  So I've bought every season so far, and until season 4 had only seen maybe 6 episodes out of hte first 3 seasons.  My wife on the other hand has seen every episode at least twice.  She's impatiently waiting for season 5.

I bought her the books after she'd seen season 1, and she read every book in the series in 4 days.

What I've seen of the series is really good.  It's an edge of the seat cliffhanger, but I hate how they leave the seasons open ended.  I guess that makes you want to come back to see what finally happens.",1427673600,,769,4.135135135135135

In a nutshell....
This is a great series, with amazing details and cinamatography! It builds characters well, and always ties things back in. I have yet to complete the 4th season, but about to watch the 6th episode.

Only thing is, I can't imagine how fullfilled we can be about each of the family of players in this grand scale series.  I ask this in wonderment...Will we really know in depth about the Jaberwalkies? Even though Geoffry is poisoned and dies, will we ever get a satisfactory revenge?

We've read the books, so the series is a subset of the books, what is lost in the need to keep the story fast-paced for TV is made up for in the amazing visuals. The series does not completely faithfully follow the books, though its quite close and the changes generally add / help with the TV show. The extras on the discs are fun, after watching the series its great to then watch how the show is made and see the actors behind the characters of the series. We get the blu-ray series as its simply the best quality you can view, cable / satellite TV and streaming are not as good.

Now, game of thrones season 4, I don't know how that is even on the movies i purchased because we have never watched this show. In fact, we have never even watched the first episode on cable TV.

The actor's portrail of each character is spot on. Peter Dinklage's performance specifically will give you chills. So many important parts are covered in this season. You will be left on the edge of your seat, screaming at your TV and desperately waiting for April to see what happens next.

The only reason I gave this a 4 star rating and not a 5 is because of the packaging it was sent in. There was a ding on the box which was a little disappointing, but not so big to make me want to return the item.",1427414400,,665,4.155038759689923

Amazon offers the best price for all of the items they sell.  Save your self some time, money, effort,  sign up for a Prime Membership for all sorts of wonderful offers, music, movies, any thing your little ole heart could desire,  they have.  You order it and it gets brought to your doorstep. Hey,  you can even shop naked,  if you want!  So many choices of every thing under the sun.

5874858,5,B00DY64C8S,"It's so hard to talk about Game of Thrones without wanting to spoil all the amazing things that happen within it.  It's best to experience those yourself so I won't comment on those, instead I will say that Season 4 has built upon the quite amazing last few episodes of Season 3 to become what I feel is the best paced and produced episodes of the series so far.  All the characters(that are still surviving) are touched upon and thrust upon a whole new variety of scenarios in an effort to fulfill their goals.  There are some of the best action battle scenes of the series included to date.

To be honest, if you are reading a review on the 4th season of the show, you have probably watched the others, and to you I say GO GET IT.

The quality of the blu-rays are to be expected of the always superb collections of the series.  I enjoy the box(which is slightly smaller than previous ones) and the quality of picture and sound that is produced.  The extras are a nice touch as well and always enjoy the amazing cast bloopers.",1427155200,,1027,4.345549738219895

5875143,5,B00DY64C8S,"VALAR MORGHULIS. Death has become a way of life in Westeros.
Not that thats any news to those who read the books by George R.R. Martin or watch the HBO series helmed by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. We learned in Season 3 that weddings are deadly affairs. Season 4 repeats the lesson in Episode 2, The Lion and the Rose. Young, psycho king Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) meets his end by a particularly nasty poison during his wedding feast. His uncle, Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) is accused of the crime, which becomes one of the seasons main storylines.
Did Tyrion kill him or not? Heaven knows, he had enough reason to. In the episode commentary with Martin and director Alex Graves, we find out some fans complained that, nasty as it was, Joffreys death wasn't worse. They wanted the character to suffer more.
Maybe  Still, we have plenty of other deaths throughout Season 4 to make up for it. Several major characters  some longstanding, others new  meet their end by poison, eye gouging, arrow, a handy shove and other brutalities. Readers knew some of these were coming. Even so, Benioff, Weiss and Martin threw us a few curves, offing a few who still live in the books. Bonus feature The Fallen: A Roundtable, hosted by co-producer/writer Bryan Cogman, gives us the actors and their take on their GoT experience and demise.
Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister) found out his character died from a fan, who, on meeting, told him he had one of the best deaths in the series. (True. And, like Joffreys, well earned.)
But Dance also talks about his first scene: It was in a tent that was in a field at 3 oclock in the morning. It was bitterly cold. And I thought why are we in this tent? There are no shots outside the tent. This tent could be set up on the studio floor where we could all be warm instead of freezing our asses off in the middle of this field 20 miles outside of Belfast.
As Cogman says, Welcome to Game of Thrones, where atmosphere and location is everything.
Mark Stanleys first time on set came on a boiling hot day in August, filming a scene at Castle Black in full winter-wear as Jon Snows Night Watch comrade in arms, Grenn. His is one of the surprise deaths. As Cogman puts it, Its really a compliment because we knew that the Battle of the Wall had to have consequences.
Stanley found out by reading the script. I opened the script for Episode 409 and started reading this epic battle sequence that lasts the whole hour. A hundred-thousand versus a hundred, guarding the Wall for honor and the survival of mankind. And  I skip ahead and I see Grenn is dead. And I went  The f**kin bastards! My girlfriend was sitting on the sofa opposite, and I went, The f**kin bastards! Do you know how much money were going to lose? You can wave bye-bye to the car!
Season 4s final two episodes  The Watchers on the Wall, showcasing that battle between the Nights Watch and invading Wildlings, and The Children, showing the battles aftermath and setting the stage for Season 5  was compiled into a mini-movie shown on 150 IMAX theaters in January.
Meanwhile, Mother of Dragons Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) begins to determine how a queen should govern before setting out to take over Westeros; Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) and Sandor The Hound Clegane (Rory McCann) form an unlikely and, ultimately, deadly alliance; and Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright) finally finds the three-eyed raven. Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) accompanied by her new squire, Podrick Payne (Daniel Portman) continues her quest to find the Stark girls  although it seems Petyr Littlefinger Baelish (Aidan Gillen) has his own plans for Sansa (Sophie Tucker). Through Littlefinger, we discover just how the war for the throne began. Meanwhile, Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen) continues to suffer at the hands of slimy Ramsay Snow (Iwan Rheon), no relation to the heroic Jon.
Season 4, like its predecessors, is epic. The pace is head-spinning fast.
Game of Thrones continues to be HBOs most popular series of all time with approximately 19-million viewers per episode. Again, they give us a perfect home theater experience in a Blu-ray presentation that includes all 10 episodes, 11 commentaries, In-Episode Guides (characters, locations and histories), and several outstanding extras in addition to the Round Table discussion.
The Politics of Power: A Look Back at Season 3 is a 25 minute recap designed to refresh memories or bring newcomers up to date. New Characters and Locations, a highlight of each season, introduces new faces and cultures. Behind the Battle for the Wall is a behind-scenes, 37-minute documentary about Season 4s big battle. We learn some of the mechanics and hear interviews from major players like Harington, John Bradley (Samwell Tarly) and Rose Leslie (Ygritte).
Histories & Lore  also part of the In-Episode Guides  are narrated by various actors and cover subjects such as poison, dragons, the Iron Bank of Braavos, Roberts Rebellion, Sellswords & Hedge Knights, and Bastards. (Bastards have always been important in Game of Thrones lore and get an additional seven-minute featurette from Bennioff, Weiss and Martin.) Like every extra, these are very nicely done  beautifully illustrated and performed, and loaded with information.
A blooper reel of the usual goofs  including a rollicking entrance by Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister)  and two deleted scenes complete a thoroughly entertaining HD experience.   Kay Reynolds",1426896000,2,5449,4.920479302832244

I will refrain from critiquing the show itself. If you don't know if you will like GoT, then find one of the thousands (literally) of websites that have open discussions of the merits of the show's writing, design and production. It's enough to make you sick, and watch out for spoilers. I like it enough to buy the Seasons as they come out on Blu-Ray. The review really should be about the set, which is exactly what it should be.",1426636800,,672,4.333333333333333

5875599,5,B00DY64C8S,"First, let me say, I can't WAIT to see how George R.R. Martin is going to pull off the ending to his series. I absolutely love it! I've read the books twice, and I just don't see how Martin is going to tie everything together so that they can finish the cable series. All the characters are scattered to the far ends of Westros, across the Narrow Sea, or dead. So far, the series has been right out of the book. But, in this latest season of TGOT, I see the producers and writers are beginning to take a little leeway with things. Those of you whom have read the books will know what I'm talking about. In this last season --which is still fantastic none the less-- there are a few things missing. I'm not going to spoil anything so leave it at that.  It took Mr. Martin over twenty years to write this epic story to this point. Of course he never had the pressure to write faster before his books became one of the most exciting and interesting works of fiction since Lord of The Rings. How is he ever going to stay ahead now!? If you haven't read his books, I would strongly urge you to do so! This is fantastic stuff. What's he going to do!? In a perfect world (I think) Tyrion and Danerys become allies, come back to Westros and use the dragons to defeat the Lanister's, then they save the people from the TERRIFYING evil of the White Walkers form the North. They are hero's! Danerys becomes Queen and rules over all the lands to the east (Meeren and all the desert kingdoms) AND THE ULTIMATE IRONY: Tyrion, the scorned and scared little dwarf becomes the king of Westros!! Right? I mean he's obviously the most intelligent and compassionate of the Lanister's, am I right!? In the last book by Martin everything is still in the midst of turmoil. Either Martin gets with some FAST writing, or HBO finishes this thing with him as a consultant. Either way will be great. The suspense is killing me! Lol.",1426464000,,1904,4.363380281690141

It's along the same lines as the novels I write only mine are historical fantasy.  Loved the complex plot lines and how they're interwoven.  There are a great many characters though and I suppose it's necessary because the author seems to be so fond of killing them off.

Go back and watch Series 1 and be amazed at how many plot twists and events there are, it's like more happens in that one series than in all the subsequent combined. Daenerys and Arya/Hound keep the story going for me, but after they killed Ned, most of the characters just weren't that interestingly portrayed. Season 3 and 4 were total snooze fests, but I still keep watching and hoping it will get better. Kind of reminds me of the Series Dexter...started strong, fizzled out. Only Battlestar kept up the quality up for all seasons...until the final show, where it nose dived. Anyways, will watch Season 5 and hope for better.",1426377600,,746,4.616541353383458

5875772,5,B00DY64C8S,"This has been a great series but this season was spectacular.  This review contains no spoilers, just my praise for this season.  My wife and I avoided any previews or catching an occasional single episode of Season 4 during the year.  We waited until the DVDs came out before watching any of this season.  Before we watched it we watched Season 3 and then we had a one day Season 4 marathon.

This season has 10 episodes and this was the best season yet.  Continuous action and the storyline in the show was just excellent.  The acting was really top notch and we simply could not stop watching the entire set of discs.  It was full of violence, warfare, plot twists and turns and special effects as each episode left you hanging and wanting more.  There were even some shockers for us!  This in one of the best shows on TV today and this set of discs is worth getting for your collection at home.

There is a lot of adult content so this is not for children but we enjoyed every minute of this season.  I rated it at 5 stars and I recommend it to you to watch.",1426118400,2,1062,4.255

5876081,5,B00DY64C8S,"In the Seven Kingdoms, the War of the Five Kings is all but over. King Joffrey is poised to marry Lady Margaery Tyrell, placing the bulk of the military power of the continent under his command. Stannis Baratheon persists in his claim to the throne, but his lack of men, ship and gold forces his Hand, Ser Davos Seaworth, to seek allies in unusual places. Meanwhile, the forces of Mance Rayder advance on the critically undermanned Wall, whilst far to the east Daenerys Targaryen seizes the slaver city of Meereen, only to find that holding it will be more difficult than she thought.

The fourth season of Game of Thrones is the most ambitious to date. In terms of structure and plot it draws upon no less than three of George R.R. Martin's novels (A Storm of Swords, A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons), features a battle sequence that dwarfs even the Blackwater from Season 2 and features much more extensive use of CGI for creature effects, establishing shots and even virtual sets.

In overall terms, it may be the strongest season to date. Previous seasons built slowly to massive 'Episode Nine' moments with an extended coda afterwards, but Season 4 features some massive moments and confrontations throughout its run. The Battle for the Wall in episode nine is indeed amazing and may be the best episode of the season, but there are other moments through the season which come close to rivalling it (the ""Purple Wedding"", Tyrion's trial and resulting duel and multiple moments in the finale). It's certainly a more compelling season than the preceding two, with more substantial moments of plot and character development in early episodes rather than just a lot of slow-building set-up.

Performances are, as usual, superb. The newcomer of note this season is Pedro Pascal as Prince Oberyn Martell, who brings all the deadly grace, measured debauchery, confident swagger and resolute vengeance of the book character to the screen. Other newcomers are less impressive, although this is more down to the writing than performances: the decision to reduce Mace Tyrell to a bumbling oaf only worth comic relief as Tywin ignores him is implausible given how badly reliant Tywin is on Mace's army and support. Peter Dinklage, Charles Dance, Conleth Hill and Rory McCann continue to provide superlative performances, and as usual Aidan Gillen's acting is undermined by his ludicrous Batman voice. Sophie Turner steps things up in the last few episodes as Sansa gains some agency and power of her own, but, disappointingly, it feels like Maisie Williams is treading water a little as Arya. She has a few good moments (such as her outrage as the Hound mistreats a family who has taken them in) but she often makes inertness Arya's response to threatening situations.

The stand-out performance of the season, in my book, must go to Gwendoline Christie as Brienne. A little stiff and awkward in the second season (where it fitted the character superbly) and more confident in the third, Christie really comes into her own this year with a series of humourous exchanges with Pod, some human ones with Jaime and a brutal confrontation with the Hound in the finale. These all serve to complicate her character and the actress more than meets the challenge. In a much more limited role, it's also good to see Kristofer Hivju nailing Tormund more as the character from the books (part man, part force of nature), particularly in his final discussions with Jon Snow (Kit Harington being effectively surly and northern, as usual).

So the series is well-paced, with some great storytelling moments and some wise decisions on when to follow the books religiously and when to move away and do their own thing. There are a few missteps when it comes to translating iconic scenes from the books, with them generally being made less powerful and resonant than what was in print. This may be down to a limitation of the medium (Tyrion thinks about Tysha fairly regularly in the books, whilst in the TV show it's unlikely viewers will remember a minor backstory point made three years earlier) but it also feels like sometimes there are changes for change's sake, which hurts the TV show by reducing the full potential impact of scenes.

Another problem in Season 4 is that the ugly spectre of sexual violence rears its head more noticeably than ever before. In the novels, there are certainly unpleasant moments of sexual assault or threatened violence against both men and women, but the TV show takes this to new extremes in the fourth season with an inexplicable (from plot and character terms) sexual assault in the third episode and the disturbing use of 'rape-as-wallpaper' in the fourth. Whilst this is a harsh and ugly world and the urge not to sugar-coat it must be strong, the writers go way overboard in these incidents and seem to be using the very real and distressingly common crimes of sexual violence for the purposes of drumming up controversy and media coverage. The presentation of one of the villains responsible for these scenes, Karl, as a corny villain who drinks blood from the skulls of his enemies (a character and scene not in the books) doesn't really help with the idea that these scenes are meant to be realistic in any way, shape or form. It also doesn't help that the show does sugar-coat the antics of other, more fan-favourite characters so as not to offend the audience. The events of A Storm of Swords pretty much destroy Tyrion as a character, reducing him to a vile-spirited murderer in the finale as he realises how his attempts to be (in his own way) honourable and fair have backfired on him. The TV show doesn't hold much truck with this, making Tyrion a killer only in self-defence and allowing him to retain the veneer of heroism rather than complicating and darkening the character as Martin does in the novels. It's a lazy and obvious choice for a show (and series of books) that shines the brightest when not doing the lazy and obvious.

Still, whilst some elements are hard to swallow or excuse (and nor should we), the fourth season of Game of Thrones is, when it is on its game, still highly watchable, entertaining and the most epic ongoing TV series ever made. The problem is that the series isn't hitting those best moments with the frequency that it really could with some cleverer and more subtle writing, and sometimes lets itself down by chasing controversy which it really does not need to do.",1425686400,,6443,4.820072332730561

5876151,5,B00DY64C8S,I really enjoy this series and Season 4 does not disappoint. It is a classic drama storyline with a wonderful cast.,1425513600,,115,4.523809523809524
5876152,5,B00DY64C8S,"I love this season! Great packaging that will last and become a collector's item. Has a case AND AL a jacket. 4 discs instead of the 5 discs included in previous versions, but still the same footage and material. Large amount of bonus features.",1425427200,,244,4.568181818181818
5876153,5,B00DY64C8S,Long awaited Season 4 didn't disappoint. Top quality BluRay presentation,1425427200,,72,6.3
5876154,5,B00DY64C8S,"When a series gets some years on it, it tends to get stale. People become predictable. Themes seem to repeat. You get to that happily-ever-after sweet spot that becomes boring. Or it jumps the shark and becomes ridiculous. Not so with Game of Thrones. I am only on episode 3, but I watched the first 3 back to back because I absolutely couldn't stop. If I weren't falling asleep, I'd still be watching. I've got no idea what is going to happen next. It's always something unexpected. Even the scenes that should be as commonplace as having something to eat have twists and turns.

I was not a fan of the series when it first started. I only watched the first season because it was a gift. I have to say I am thoroughly hooked now. I don't particularly like the nudity, foul language, violence, or sex, but it comes wrapped in a well-written, well acted, visually appealing story that I can't resist. Bravo to writers, cast, and crew. Give me more, more, more!

Update: I watched the whole season in 2 days! LOL. I realized that what makes this so spectacular is that follows no typical rules. The ""hero"" isn't necessarily the every day guy or the golden child. The hero doesn't always get the girl, succeed, or even live. The bad guy isn't always defeated. A person with a destiny doesn't always get to fulfill it. The wicked can also be stupid and make mistakes. The mouse doesn't always stay a mouse. It's like life. We have plans, and then stuff happens. There are twists and turns. The fact that you can't say for sure that it's a story about this person, this family, or this event keeps you on your toes. I hope the writers never play it safe and fall into patterns. It's so much more exciting this way.",1425427200,,1709,4.456869009584665
5876155,5,B00DY64C8S,Continues the theme don't get too attached to any character. Lot's of good twists and surprises with only a few spots that are slow. Well worth the time to watch.,1425427200,,162,4.433333333333334

5876185,5,B00DY64C8S,"I love this series, I love the books and it's exciting that GOT has become world known.  Season 4 was better than ever; I marvel at the writing and the choices the adaptors must make to bring this story to us in ten hours a year.... HOWEVER.......... the first three seasons managed to draw this world wide audience WITHOUT gratuitous sex, nudity, gore, and language.  The ""F word"" and the ""Cword"" were used way more than I care to hear, especially, from a series I admire so much.  With SPARTACUS, one grew accustomed to the language, nudity, sex, and gore, but that was what SPARTACUS was; one knew it would be there as the nature of the show.  In Game of Thrones, it is disappointing, though I still give it five stars, but this series cheapens itself with the language alone... I hope it is dialed back some...  It is truly among the best ever TV shows done, and I applaud the writers, directors and actors for their superlative work.  I can even applaud Jack Gleason, who did a brilliant job as the hideous boy who would be king....That cannot have been easy...  I count Game of Thrones among the best of art which is produced today.... Bravo GOT.",1425427200,,1152,4.483253588516747

5876227,2,B00DY64C8S,"I liked the book series and the first two seasons.  Season 3 and 4 just plod along.  Also agree with other reviewers that there is too much gratuitous sex -- feels like marketing is directed at the adolescent population every time a sex scene comes along.  Been there, done that, don't need to see it every episode - and it does not add anything to the story line.  There were some good moments which is why I did not give one star.  Will ONLY buy season 5 to see the walk of shame.  Otherwise I would not bother based on last two seasons productions.",1425427200,,551,4.25

Post Note: It does have brutality, which I usually disdain because it feels gratuitous, but GOT does not wallow in it or focus on it like a lot of modern shows do; it is always in context and it IS realistic, unfortunately.",1425427200,,390,4.82089552238806

The Blu Ray set does NOT come with the additional DVDs like Season 1-3 did.  A little pissed about that, not a deal breaker though.  I just was kinda miffed that I paid the same price on the set and it comes with less.  This being said, the special features kind of fall flat.  Not as cool as the first 2 seasons SFs.

5876285,5,B00DY64C8S,"I just wanted to rate all of the 4 Seasons I've watched so far because I hope HBO never ever ends the Game of Thrones series. This series is excellent and is the best show out there. I could watch 20 of these Seasons and hope HBO continues making them for many years to come.

PARENTAL WARNING: There is a lot of extreme violence, extreme nudity and extreme sexual violence. In my opinion this series is not for teens, even those you would normally allow to watch R rated shows. This is strictly an adult show. Adults are capable of seeing the violence as relative to the times in which it is portrayed and see it in perspective. Teens ARE children as their brains are not fully developed until their early 20's, and are easily influenced by what they see. And this show is raw and base and violent in the extreme and in my opinion it is not for teenagers, even older teenagers.",1425254400,,878,4.353658536585366

5876317,5,B00DY64C8S,"I think everyone knows that this is one of the best shows on TV, but I think I can be helpful by saying that in many ways, getting season 4 with Amazon Video streaming was actually better than buying DVDs, because of the lack of shipping delay and the ability to go anywhere in my house and watch on pretty much any laptop or PC (helpful when my 11 and 13 year old kids claim to need various rooms in the house for one thing or another!). As far as the show, I will have to say that it's clearly not for kids and some episodes in the season approach the ""NC-17"" rating used for movies. I purchased the standard definition version of the show and had no trouble at any time watching with Verizon FIOS wi-fi (25mb/sec download)",1425254400,,725,4.223021582733813

5876333,5,B00DY64C8S,"Warning...This contains spoilers from the prior seasons, and hints, but no major giveaways from season 4. If you have not watched the prior seasons proceed at your own risk.

As most know this is just a continuation of one long story. There are really two ""main"" story lines going on, that of course spin off a bunch of ancillary stories. One is the aftermath of the Red Wedding, and the death of Robb and Catelyn Stark. There are several ancillary stories that stem from that including Arya trying to get revenge on those who have wronged her, all while having to ""team"" with the Hound who she wants to kill. There is also a murder that lands Tyrion under arrest, and Stannis' plot to gain the throne (which really does not advance much until the end of the season). The other story follows the wildling's planned invasion which culminates in an epic battle at the ice wall and Castle Black in episode 9. Daenerys has still not crossed the sea, and really does not do much this season aside from freeing more slave cities. The main crux of her story this season is that she is having a harder and harder time controlling the dragons. I cannot say too much more without revealing too much, but like in past seasons major characters die. Also as in prior seasons some parts of the story mirror the books well, and other parts they made up for the show. If you are a huge fan of the books, just be aware (as you probably already are) the show does not follow the books 100%, which given the length and detail of each book would be impossible anyway.

For those who get the actual discs, the show looks and sounds great on Blu Ray. For extras there are commentaries on select episodes. In episode guides for every episode, a season 3 recap, a making of the castle black battle, a roundtable discussion with most of actors who played major characters who died in season 4, and a gag reel. A lot there for those who like to go through the bonus material.

Realistically the show has been on long enough now that most know what it is and what it is not. It continues to be very violent and sexual, although this season was probably a little tamer on the sex than in prior seasons. It is very well written and acted, but it does not follow the source material exactly. In fact there are some characters that die this season that are still alive at the same point in the books. Chances are if you are a fan of the prior season and accept how it has been adapted for TV, you will like this season as well.",1425168000,,2496,4.363440860215054

5876399,5,B00DY64C8S,"Best one yet with hopes that HBO will continue this fascinating, ever quickly changing, story (stories), Brilliantly, subtly acted, graceful, at times beautiful, visually stunning, locations a real treat for the eyes, costumes are excellent designs, characters are all different enough to make story lines engaging.

What I appreciate about this series is that the supporting casts carry their own weight easily being able to carry each scene effortlessly. The supporting casts could have branches all their own for further character, story developments and I certainly hope that at some future dates entire story lines are carried through with some of the supporting characters.

I would also like to see story lines further developing some of the far to quickly disappearing main characters.

This is not fare for the faint of heart. This series makes a person think.",1425168000,,869,5.282608695652174

5876402,5,B00DY64C8S,"If you're reading reviews of season four of the fantasy phenomenon that is Game of Thrones, then you're probably, like us, already irretrievably addicted. In eager anticipation of the release date, we avidly re-watched season 1-3 so were totally immersed and raring to fight our way through the usual impenetrable cellophane and get stuck in.

Although we tried really hard to pace ourselves, we couldn't help but gobble up the whole season in two sittings; it is just so engrossing, gripping, enthralling and lots of other words ending in ing. Theres so much going on, loads of intricate plot twists and some truly astonishing surprises (so, you thought the Red Wedding in the last season was a shock, just wait for the  .!!)  that it would be impossible to describe them without spoilers, but suffice to say that the main story lines established in Season 3 gather momentum and bear some surprising fruit.

The main cast continue to delight and horrify in equal measure; the ghastly Joffrey becomes more so, poor Tyrion had a really hard time of it while Cersei fails to accept the fact that Jamie one-hand is a changed man.  Theon is completely broken by Ramsay Bolton while Bolton Snr. attempts to cement his claim to the North by hunting down the remaining Stark boys. Theres an excellent new character from Dorn with his own reasons for wanting to be at The Wedding and Arya and the Hound, Sansa and Little Finger & Brienne and Podrick all set off on separate quests. The wildlings continue South while the undermanned Castle Black prepares for the onslaught (there is a brilliant Helms Deepesque battle with giants and mammoths) while the Stark boys head north driven by Brans visions.

Ive probably forgotten something important but weve only watched it once; a few days after finishing our Blu-ray player gave up the ghost (it may only be three years old, but it has done  a lot of hours!). We will be re-watching it as soon as the new player arrives and then well have to wait, however impatiently, for the next instalment.",1425168000,,2033,4.7749287749287745

5876595,4,B00DY64C8S,"Seems kind of short for a Game of Thrones Season.
A lot of build-up clips of Cast & Crew are included with this season, again.  Some of them are actually funny.

Plenty of interesting things happen in this 10 episode season. The Wildlings storm the great wall and there follows a savage battle for Castle Black. First-born son, Prince/King Stanis Barathian shows up with a huge army at the end of this episode and captures the Wildling King and his army.  Stanza Stark finally escapes from Joffry, Queen Cerce and the Castle, aided by little finger.  Stanza later watches as her Aunt Eliza is thrown through the moon door in the Vale.
Little sister Aiya Stark almost stumbles into Stanza in the Vale; but arrives at the Bloody Gates 3 days after her Aunt death and too late to be ransomed from her captor, The Hound.
Daenarius has heartbreaking problems with her dragons. Unfortunately they've been incinerating sheep, goats & even children around the countryside of Mereen.  Mereen is where she has decided to remain and rule permanently; forsaking the idea of taking back the Throne of the Seven Kingdoms. Her oldest & most trusted advisor, Jorah, is exposed as the Barathian spy when a messenger delivers a pardon for him from Westeros, signed by the dead Barathian King himself.
Tyrion's obnoxious royal nephew, King Joffry, finally gets his and Tyrion, (after an odious trial for nephoticide), generously awards his father, Tyrell,  the same status by killing him as he is seated in the privy.  All edge of your seat action but it still feels like there are fewer episodes than previous seasons..",1424995200,,1601,4.842490842490842

5876630,5,B00DY64C8S,"The show continues to mesmerize and surprise!  Wow.  Don't read any spoilers until you watch it for yourself. Many unexpected twists and turns -- but GOT has taught us  -- expect the unexpected.

 Without giving anything away, I will say Peter Drinklage and Lena Heady should both be getting Emmys this year. Jon Snow takes charge and we LIKE It. Sansa comes of age. A lot of sad deaths. A few gratifying deaths! Those dragons are getting very big. Arya and the Hound -- hostage situation or unlikely alliance?  Does Jamie Lannister have a heart? Never underestimate the women of Highgarden.

Politics is a strange balance -- what happens if you free slaves and they may have actually liked their captivity? With great power comes great responsibility.  Can there ever be love without betrayal? How far do we go to keep our word?  Family trumps all -- or does it?  One of the things I love about this series is that the big questions continue to be asked and there are never simple answers. It all ends on an intriguing note and now I can't wait for Season 5.

Yes, it's a must-see for all GOT fans!  Don't miss it.",1424822400,3,1115,4.52

This show was great in the first season, still pretty good in the second, the third season was weak and rudderless.  We needed a real strong 4th season to remind us why we love this show.  It didn't happen. The best thing I can say about season 4 is we don't have to deal with this crap again for another year.  The shows creators are always wondering how can we pad this out another season without really doing anything instead of just giving us a real good 2 hour finale to wrap everything up once and for all.

After watching first two episodes on the first season we were hooked!!  It is excellent!!!  We now brought season two, three and now four.  It is very entertaining, interesting, great story , and  ADDICTIVE  and fun to watch.  Best part which helps a lot buying the videos and I recommend is that the first season comes with maps, pictures of the all the actors, who  are in the show, pictures of the clans, we refer to this often watching show, it adds to the enjoyment cause it helps with following and understanding  where there are  and who is related to who.  The other seasons also had inserts to look at.  At the end of each DVD if you want  you can click on commentary  and listen to actors  talk about story line, directors talking about making the film, which we do and we think is just great. The ' GAME OF THRONES IS NOT FOR CHILDREN OR TEENS"".  These films are for adults.  There is cursing, sex, drinking  and violence but having said that - it's all also about family, love , humor and honor.
 The show  takes place in Scotland - The scenery in the show is breathtaking!!  We are hooked  and are amazed with the writing, acting  and all that went into the making of this films.",1424736000,5,1311,4.375

The story lines follow the book's for the most part but, if memory from reading the book series is correct, there are a few alterations, if you're not a purist you find these alterations minimally alter the book's storylines. I'm hoping that HBO will allow the early viewing of season fives episodes to none HBO cable subscribers this year, like AMC does with its shows.

5876746,3,B00DY64C8S,"The 3 stars is not for the program itself.  That I give 5 stars.  The story is marvelous and the acting the best.  The 3 star rating is for the unnessessary nudity, x-rated porn that for some reason the directors feel is necessary.  The x-rated porn scenes are not entertaining and actually take away from a great story.",1424563200,,320,4.4655172413793105
5876747,4,B00DY64C8S,"So hard to review this and not give up the shows contents.  What you need to know is that Season Four, like the previous seasons will have the following:  oodles of blood and guts, nudity aplenty, darkness, death, mayhem and destruction.  Throw in the most debauched plotlines you can imagine and there you have it, the guilty pleasure that is Game Of Thrones.  Epically popular and well worth the watch, as each episode unfolds you will be astonished at the sheer brutality as well as the razor-sharp writing.  Pleasantly all actors in the show are amazing.  You will not find the usual penetration of Hollywood elite here, no stupid cameos or bad craft.  That is probably what makes this show so impressive. That, and the sheer audacity of the writers.  Very few subjects have not been broached. If you have a hankering for great TV and are not particularly squeamish or easily offended, this show is one of the best there is on pay TV.  If you are frugal like I am and refuse to pay for HBO just for one show, welcome to Season Four.  You will not be disappointed, though one of your favorite characters might get poisoned, decapitated, or burned alive.  Who knows which?  Watch and find out.  Looks perfect on Blu-Ray.  Shame that they cut out the DVDs in the set and just went for the digital download.  Always nice to have the show in both formats.  But whatever. Someday soon they'll be phasing out DVD altogether anyway.

5876748,3,B00DY64C8S,"I love the book and the movie, but by this part of the movie I was a little disappointed. Overall it's still very good except couple parts,a
which are change from the book. Here (in the movie) we see that Aria with her big protector are getting to the Castle of Lisa - Aria's ant.
The ant is killed and because of that nobody offers protection to Aria, where her sister Sansa is also staying at this very moment. It's hard
to believe in realistic of such situation - even when Lisa is dead the local lords would still offer protection to one of the Stark's family members. Second moment is when Sandor is killed by the Brietta (another change from the book) Aria does not want to stay with her,
while she any help she can get. The moral - unless is really needed - stick yo the book, even overall the movie is still well done.",1424563200,,826,4.234177215189874

5876757,3,B00DY64C8S,"Absolutely love GOT and this review is not a reflection on the quality of the series, however, we were disappointed in the quality of the recording.  The first disc came up on Gracenote on our BluRay and it wasn't identified as Game Of Thrones Season 4but as Olive Kitteridge starring Frances McDormond.  The only explanation would be that they reused old disks and they weren't recoded?  The sound and picture quality was average at best.  The second disc was coded properly but the sound quality was lacking.  After playing other BluRays and regular DVD's we have determined it was not the fault of our player.  We've invested a lot of money in this series and this copy was a huge disappointment. I hope they step up their quality control to rectify these issues on Season 5.",1424563200,2,778,4.6838235294117645

5876775,5,B00DY64C8S,"My husband and I really enjoy the Game of Thrones series.  We are always surprised with what happens in each and every episode.  We never know what will happen next.  The story has many twist and turns in the plotline.  We find ourselves passionate about one character or another in one episode, only to change our minds about him or her in the next episode.  We have actually gone back and re-watched episodes just to make sure we didn't miss something.  I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a storyline line with suspense, drama, and action that keeps you on your toes.

The HBO series is based on a series of books, which we have never read.  I am sure like most movies or series based on books, the show deviates from the storyline in the books.  Since we hadn't read any of the books, my opinion is truly based on the series alone.  After the series is completely finished, I believe I might just have to read the book series.  I enjoy the storyline of this series that much! Enjoy!

I have enjoyed season after season and I am looking forward to purchasing and watching season 5 when it is available.",1424476800,,1114,4.433497536945813

5876783,1,B00DY64C8S,"Highly  disappointed...with all previous seasons of Game of Thrones, they included both Bluray and DVD so I could watch it anywhere whether I had newer or older equipment.  I specifically didn't order at first because it didn't say it had both.  I waited several months actually...and then one day it finally claimed to be a Bluray/DVD combo like Season had changed when it got closer to release. So I ordered it...but with no attempt to tell me they just change it to Bluray plus digital...my older stuff doesn't do digital, but they do play DVD.  I place this one squarely on Amazon...not much I can do...but totally changed my view of Amazon...not sure I can even trust them now.  Likewise, why suddenly get cheap Game of Thrones/HBO...Now that you are like the greatest show out there and practically everybody watches loyally, I guess you decide to give us half as much for the same cost...sounds pretty greedy!

5876838,3,B00DY64C8S,"Oh I love all the trailers. The cheapest way for me to get  to view this season was to order HBO for a month, watch all the shows as fast as I can, then unsubscribe to hbo. That way it's a about 15.00 for the month. So I've sent three videos so far of season 4. Since I've read all the books, I am disappointed with the changes, and that is the reason for the three stars. But the bottom line is that the scenery, the costumes, the effects and so on are well worth seeing. I have never acted in something like this so I can't say what it takes. I just wish that Circe (I know I didn't spell it right) could emit tears over the kids. It seems like the acting may be a little forced, as if there are deadlines and people have their lives to live as well as show up to work on the set. I could beg for it to seem a bit more natural at times. But this is true for many other productions besides Game of Thrones, so it is not something I criticize only once and only here. That said, however, the quality of television has gone up tremendously despite the volume. I need to add that watching the extra materiel enabled me to enjoy the drama as it's own creation, as opposed to simply being a rendition of the Ice and Fire gitas.

All general review aside, I must digress: I am proud to know that more people can find work in entertainment because it's ART, and the world, imho, should be full of ART and not WAR. Things can only improve from here, and hopefully we in West Virginia will be able to participate instead of having to be only  hill folk & coal miners. BTW I am from the Bronx, so if I sound like I'm not in touch with West Virginians, that may well be so. I'm an outsider looking in. But know this:  I've lived a country life for a long time, and my desire to see people be un-beholden to the JOB PROVIDERS and MORE self sufficient in all ways, is very sincere.",1424390400,,1869,4.056910569105691

5876960,5,B00DY64C8S,"I can't believe that it took me this long to get on board with this series. My son started telling me about the series when he was over this past Christmas. He told me about how he and his girlfriend had crowns and swords and how they dressed up to watch each episode. Being the third child this didn't surprise me too much, he grew up with Harry Potter. Anyway, his enthusiasm was enough to get me to order the first three seasons. Oh my god, after the first season I pre-ordered season four. Having been a history major in college I had never been satisfied with movies about the Dark Ages. Richard Gere romping around the countryside on a white horse just wasn't getting it done for me. GOT has galloped in on a fire breath black horse slashing and burning to save the day. There is a reason why they call it the Dark Ages.
It took me about ten days to watch the first three seasons. I don't think I got out of my pajamas during the first season. I showed a little restraint during the next two seasons, I cut back to watching only two episodes a day. Well, season four came in the mail yesterday. I'm going to try to watch one episode a day, but, if season four is anything like the first three I'll be finished tomorrow. I don't know how I'm going to get through a whole year before season five comes out. One of these days I might have to order HBO.",1424304000,,1355,4.195402298850575
5876961,1,B00DY64C8S,First this is not a review of the show but of the product that we purchased. We love Game of Thrones. When we opened the package there was no code for the Ultraviolet digital copy. Instead there were 2 copies of the episode list. This is unacceptable. I would not have paid full price just for the Blu-Ray.,1424304000,5,306,4.293103448275862
5876962,3,B00DY64C8S,"This season was hyped predictably to be the best season yet for the show.  It was nowhere near.  The story feels glossed over and is not compelling to the audience.  There was quite a bit of time spent in empty dialogue that didn't serve a real purpose and felt like dead air.  The epic nature of the drama and setting of King's Landing was lost.  One of the key scenes feels like you just turned on a Sunday morning cartoon.

This season more than the others leaned very heavily on the actors to prop up weak writing and story lines in comparison to previous seasons of the books.  The actors succeed in some scenes, but overall the flat uninteresting storyline shows through in many spots and I find myself not caring about the characters because they are poorly developed.

Very little effort was put into some scenes to make them work.  For example in one scene the characters keep talking about the quantity of soldiers opposing them repeatedly as a very large number.  I won't say how many or what scene I'm referring to as I don't wish to spoil.  But during the scene you never see evidence that even 1/3 of that number are even there.  And later when another opposing force shows up and is scene via overhead, they only appear as maybe 10% of the number stated, but somehow the much larger stated army immediately is captured.  It's very difficult to follow unless you happen to know the back story from the books and are mentally pushing the scenes forward from memory in your mind.  Otherwise it just doesn't make sense.

The writing of this season wasn't up to par for HBO and wasn't a strong representation of the books.  The season lacked weight.  It was hard to buy into many of the characters in this season, though others were done true.  For example I think Arya's overall tone in how she was presented was spot on.

There wasn't much tension or conflicting chess pieces moving around either so the dramatic things that do happen also feel unopposed and lacking in importance as they serve to move the plot forward primarily rather than being large tentpole moments such as the end which Ned Stark met and the Red Wedding.

The season felt rushed and that the writers were placed under the gun to decide more than previous seasons what scenes were going to make the who and which weren't, and due to this and their choices they started creating dialogue and moments that aren't true in the book to connect the dots that had voids of information that the audience needs to process the storyline coherently.

This season should have had more episodes to cover more in breadth.  Much of this season felt like snapshots rather than fully realizing the story.",1424304000,12,2671,4.590717299578059
5876963,3,B00DY64C8S,"That Amazon and/or HBO did not notify customers who pre-ordered season 4 that the format and product had changed is wrong. Not life altering wrong, as in ordering a  Furby and ending up with a live and hostile water moccasin, but still poor service. Of the last six/seven orders I have placed in the past two months, three have not been delivered as ordered. It's strange, especially for a company who has been excellent in the past. I watch the DVD's when I am on the road and the Blu-Rays at home, so it is unfortunate they are not included as promised.

The mix-up aside, I love watching Game of Thrones, and this season has plenty of everything I have come to expect from the show, including the deaths of characters I was hoping could live on and be a part of an evolving and interesting story.  Hopefully season 5 keeps the tension, drama, and action at the same pace, and takes us past what has been already published in the books.",1424217600,12,938,4.441860465116279

5876984,3,B00DY64C8S,"10 episodes is a major CHEAT for a TV series where there is so much going on. G of T has TOO much ground to cover they could of easily made 12 to 15 episodes or MORE. For instance: Each scene isn't whole. It just gives you a little taste and then moves on to another scene with out completing the last scenes intention. I enjoyed it but the G of T TV execs are really squeezing every last dollar and cheating their fans. Most G of T fans don't understand quality vs quantity unless your a fan of the books (and we all know they have upset the fans of the books). If you look back from the first season; you get way more ""bang"" for your ""buck"".  This season is just subtle teasers for what you ""may"" or ""may not"" get in the next series run with few exceptions. Insignificant characters in scenes that entertain a mindless fan but have no relation to the plot within the story itself. Which is disappointing for those who expect more from this franchise. Also, replacing Daario Naharis for an uninteresting/""the average actor guy-type character"" (which has a completely different chemistry with the dragon queen than the last actor) was a major, epic mistake! When you see characters being replaced like this it shows there are troubled waters brewing with the film/cast/and crew. They are clearly getting too fat with popularity and losing touch with the fans who made them rich!

I was able to watch this entire TV series in ""one afternoon"". EVEN the  BBC series ""The GAME"" which is just 6 episodes give you plenty of quantity and substance for your money. Watch it and you'll see what I mean. This show as much as I love it is disappointing because they clearly take advantage of their fans.

To the people who gave one-star reviews because they somehow thought this was released already, some insight: None of the previous three seasons were released to home video before mid-February. It's for marketing reasons and isn't going to change. The new seasons begin airing in late March or early April. They put out the box set in mid-February to build the attention for the new season and give people a chance to catch-up or refresh. If you are new and didn't know this, now you do. If you are upset you pre-ordered a show you can't watch for 3 months, understand that it is a pre-order, and you can just cancel the pre-order to get a refund. It's actually faster and easier to do than come here and complain in a review because you didn't know.",1417651200,79,960,4.5813953488372094

I feel sorry for the fools who have only seen a needle of the show and have already crossed the show off their lists because they didn't like it. You really gotta watch at least one whole season to test it out, but since all seasons are amazing thus far, I would only recommend watching all of them. But the show is just great, top notch writing, acting and overall presentation. It's a masterpiece. The story is full of drama, suspense and characters you will learn to like, love and loathe.

It is brutal, bloody and frequently devastating! Strangely, as the series progresses, I actually find the writing to be superior to its' source material. I have read all the books, and it seems that, unfortunately George R. R. Martin is , shall we say, running out of steam, if not words. The tv series, on the other hand, just keeps getting better, even given that it was superb from the beginning. Aside from the writing and production values, the acting is so consistently, shatteringly incredible! Every....and I do mean EVERY character is portrayed with conviction and complexity. The story may be fantasy, but the characters are real, vibrant human beings, replete with all the foibles inherent in the species. Even the most minor characters make you totally forget that you are watching actors. I can offer no greater compliment than that! While this series certainly does not appeal to everyone, I personally feel it to be a monumental achievement. It may be entertainment, but it is so much more.

5877308,3,B00DY64C8S,"I feel that season 1 was a near-perfect adaptation of the first book, even down to entire lines of dialogue.  Season 2 necessarily cut a lot of content, but still remained astonishingly faithful to the book.

By season 3, I started to notice a sharp deviation from the book in terms of dialogue, and in major plot points and characters, but despite that, it was richly done and near perfectly executed.

By season 4, I feel as though the rot is setting in.  I remember the creators saying that if they did the show and just got to the Red Wedding from book 3, they would be happy regardless of whether the show went on or not.

After viewing season 4, I almost feel as if that statement has resonance now, as if the creators got past the part of the books they loved, and have started to get lazy.

While season 1 was cramming an entire book into it and season 2 had to cut, seasons 3 and 4 had the benefit of having the largest book of the series basically being cut in two, while also condensing what many fans considered ""filler"" from books 4 and 5 to make it all move swiftly and smoothly.

And despite all the time given, it still felt to me like so much of the show was rushed, as if they couldn't wait to set up major events, play them, then move on to the next event.  Three-eyed Raven?  Endure undramatic skeleton battle, go look at Bloodraven, enjoy?, moving along now.

The dialogue feels like a cliff-notes version of what the actual dialogue was supposed to be. Everything felt rushed, as if by the end of Joffrey's wedding, they were picking up speed and sprinting for the finish. And then they... just stop short of the actual finish. What was the rush? What could they possibly have been saving up for, especially when they couldn't even cram that anti-climax of an ep10 open into a spectacular climax for the previous episode?

And this sort of condensing suffers even worse by having so many of the colorful ""flavor"" bits removed---the rhyme-game Reek plays constantly ""Reek, Reek, rhymes with -eek"", ""Only Cat"", any sort of flavor or humor from Tormund Giantsbane, anything even remotely interesting beyond exposition from Meera and Jojen Reed, bits of lines from songs like ""Hands of Gold"" or ""The Dornishman's Wife"" or ""The Last of the Giants"", anything to justify Edd being Dolorous Edd beyond just ""other guy from Night's Watch""

All of it was removed and replaced with... nothing. I didn't complain all the way back in seasons 2-3 when most of these characters were first introduced, because I figured they would eventually play in to more fruitful roles when they had more time (like in A Feast for Crows). I still hold out hope for this with Tormund and Edd, but season 4 has made that just all the more noticeable in its absence, and the finale has utterly broken any and all trust I had in the show creators NOT in ""faithfully adapting"" the book, but in making it their own in such a way that it could have some fun on its own and retain some actual drama from the books.

This is mostly apart from the finale, ultimately, which I think is summed up best as: lack of potential, could have been more, just enough, average effort,

(Spoilers HO!)

I cannot think of any excuse to leave out Lady Stoneheart other than ""actress was unavailable"".  It was basically all laid out for the show ahead of time with the books, AND set up with the entire Brotherhood Without Banners storyline from season 3, AND would have provoked a colossal response from fans, especially following the Red Wedding from season 3.  Instead it was removed and replaced with... nothing.  Why?  Because they didn't like it?  Because of personal reasons?  If they had actually bothered to do something different, it would be one thing, but given the Red Wedding, Brotherhood Without Banners, Beric Dondarrion's constant resurrections, the Red God references, everything, it was clearly foreshadowed to anyone expecting such a cliffhanger.  All the clues lead to something big, and the big thing is missing.

But even leaving that aside... the big WHAM moment of the entire season... arguably of the entire SERIES thus far, they blew it.  Tyrion and Tywin's confrontation.  The whole point of Shae's betrayal of him and his confrontation was the revelation that Tysha, his first wife (whom not only did he tell the story in season 1, but a recap of him telling the story was replayed in season 4 seemingly for no reason) was not actually a whore and was raped and paid off.  Legendary line people love ""Where do whores go?"" will be missing from the show because the series apparently just couldn't be assed with that level of storytelling.

Everything was set up, happened, then brushed away, with a stunning scarcity in musical cues at key moments that pretty much ruined much of the potential drama. I found the ""fight"" Shae put up with Tyrion to be absurd, and it utterly killed any and all shock/horror/heartbreak from that scene. Dinklage almost saved it with his facial expressions immediately after, but the whole straightforward-ness of the entire scene, and the bland earnest-ness of Jaime to just release his brother ""because he's my brother, dude"" instead of being driven by genuine love and guilt, fell horribly flat to me.

I felt like this was supposed to be a character-defining moment for Tyrion, much like the scene at the trial, but even more so.  Jaime reveals the truth about Tysha, and Tyrion in his rage, emotionally hurts Jaime probably for the first time in his life, revealing that Cersei had been sleeping with Lancel and others, and falsely claiming that he actually did kill Joffrey, followed by the confirmation from Tywin that Tysha genuinely loved Tyrion.

Instead he clings to Shae, who while being more defined and fleshed-out as a character in the series than the books, is still ultimately depicted as willfully betraying Tyrion and trying to kill him at the end.  It could have been a hammer blow, but they settled for a wooden mallet.

I can't believe it but the only thing about this season that worked was everything involving Oberyn Martell, Sandor Clegane and Arya, and the battle at the Wall. That battle was seriously mind-blowing in its relentless music, scale, diversity of  going on, and the dismal realization for pretty much anyone that ""This is going to keep going until we are ground to dust and given how main characters in this show aren't safe, there's a high probability that Mance Rayder could take the wall, then tell all the kings in the south 'I am King of the Wall, now send help against White Walkers or we'll invade you'""

The first two-three seasons actually felt like a labor of love. Season 4 doesn't. And I look back now at that statement the showmakers made that the Red Wedding was what made them want to make the series to begin with, and if the show survived just long enough to depict that, they'd be happy. In retrospect, it feels like they got that and were happy, but now they're not happy anymore and don't care about putting forth the maximum effort.

I'm not even the type to whine and complain about any such work doing this, but it struck me here as just so patently obvious... like they had to make a conscious effort to fail as hard as they did with this finale. Even without Stoneheart, they had the pieces there to make it one of the greatest finales of the series (not the greatest) but they rushed their sole remaining wham-moment so badly that it barely registered as much as it could have.",1406505600,30,7470,4.646165527714503
5877309,4,B00DY64C8S,"I really want to give this season set a solid 5 stars with the enthusiasm that I did with seasons 2 and 3. However, I am worried about the exception of a DVD copy when you purchase this. I'll admit that I felt spoiled in the past with having 3 options to watch each season because I am in love this show. It was also a nice to have the ability to lend out my copies to those who don't have a Blu-Ray player (and probably still won't anytime soon). For example, my mother who is not subscribed to HBO and her internet speed can not handle HBO GO. This item could be a subject to change and I will change my pre-order accordingly so if they decide to include it back. But for now, I'm a bit disappointed with this change. Sorry to sound old fashioned.

Of course, when watching this season from episode 1 to 10 I would immediately label it a 5 star or a 100% rating in a heartbeat. With all of the blood curdling shocker moments to the amazing performances of Maisie Williams and Peter Dinklage, this show keeps on giving in my opinion. In fact, I have three ways of explaining material shown in this show when in comparison to the book series it's based on:

Better than the book
Better in the books
Just right.

Right now, this season was borderline with Just right and Better than the books.  Oh no, grab your pitchfork, he said an unholy thing. Sorry guys but (SPOILERS SKIP TO NEXT LINE IF NEEDED) the finale of the hound was SOOOOO much better here. Now, I will admit there was an important character missing (or at least should have shown up) and it made me shake my head a little, but everything else was fun to watch. Let's just say I can't wait to watch the making of the Battle for the Wall.

And as of now the continuity of following the book order is starting to change drasticly for the HBO series.  Storm of Swords Had a tremendous amount of events contained within it. There were additions thrown in for the sake of the many characters you read about, and it feels more like a brief ""meanwhile, on this side of the world,"" side note. I feel that the 10 episodes a season mentality is probably the smartest thing they could have come up for this. I loathe waiting for amazing moments that should have happened already after reading, but I appreciate HBO and anticipate watching this show every year. And with Season 4, it proves it. And at the end of this season, it just feels like a whole new beginning (or end) for characters you loved watching from the very first episode. It's like, you could almost stop right here and be content....but of course, nobody who loves this show will do that! WE WANT MORE!

I'm sure that the special features will include a similarity as previous sets like the always loved Animated history of Westeros. For once it would be nice if they included comic con footage because it's great seeing the actors talk or unwind about thier parts.
The one thing that I would say would boost my rating back to a 5-star even with the exception of a dvd copy (maybe) would knowing that I could redeem my digital copy through Amazon.com.",1406505600,8,3070,4.366024518388792

My humble opinion is if this was the last of the Game of Thrones videos, it would be a good ending. Bravo George Martin! and Bravo HBO Producers, Directors and Actors! Very well done.
The series is five stars, be sure to give it just due by watching it in Blu-ray not only by itself but also through the sets for full glorious import.
Others will comment on plot points and comparisons, my thoughts are on the future.
Reading on, I think after this the books lost a lot of luster that was so evident in the first 4 books. Whether the author can bring that back or not is to be seen in future volumes.
I am glad HBO did a great job in bringing the story alive (thanks for not straying too far from the books, and the quality of the casting is impeccable).
As for the future, perhaps the author will make history, to be the first to start with a famous fantasy epic in book form and finish it in video series.
And why not? After all, the main characters are fairly set, well defined, and the plot fairly well moving along with little need for further depth in character development and environment, so instead of characters and actions in print, since now brought alive in excellent visuals, continue the story on with good scripts, Martin at the helm.
He remains in script and counsel control and lets the filming take over from the written and leads us all into the remaining journey, until the end, in video. Again, just a thought.
Either way, George Martin will have some firsts after his name, and he can enjoy his fame, fortune, and attention and not have to retreat to a lonely keyboard keeping us all waiting to see if he can finish.
Instead he can let his ideas flourish in his scripts and with HBO support present them in as many seasons as he wishes, or the market supports. This way, we have the best chance in seeing the completed work, a masterpiece presented in a way that viewers will find exciting right to the end.
And new readers will be even more amazed when on the stage of their imaginative mind they read the true master at work with the beginning books, written words penned before the videos that followed, a vibrancy of literature needed to flesh the 7 Kingdoms world out when it most matters, and then a continuation on to the end in HBO series .

Season 4 makes you fall in and out of love with new and old characters alike. I find my opinion of different characters changing on almost a week-to-week basis.  Also, as a book reader, the series as a whole has done a fantastic job of portraying the main concepts that occur.  They don't always match up on how each respective medium gets from point A to point B, but they always seem to end up in the same place as they did in the book itself. Obviously there are some added and subtracted parts from the book itself to enhance dramatic effect and allow for the series to fit in 10 1 hour episodes, and that is fine with me. It kind of comes back to one of the quotes GRRM said himself. ""Your Shae is better than my Shae."" The acting in this season is absolutely on point, so much so you feel like you have almost met some of these characters in person.  My favorite thing is that no matter how hard you try to figure out ""who did what"" and that sort of thing while it's happening, there's always a few details you miss until you come back for another watch, and then you have that"" Ah-ha!"" moment.

8598934,5,B00DY64C8S,Great series. There is so much drama and suspense because you have well established characters that you want to find out what is going to happen with them. Each season feels like it gets better and better. Definitely worth a watch.,1531094400,,231,4.658536585365853

The Purple Wedding, Tyrion's trial, the Mountain and the Viper, and the Battle of Castle Black. It's all here. This is Game of Thrones at its best. Other seasons, particularly 3 and 6, have come close, but this remains my favorite season.",1530662400,,363,4.6875

8598940,4,B00DY64C8S,"Man, this is one of the best series going. The writing and keeping all the strategies straight probably takes a huge amount of people. They deserve 10 stars for that alone. I've taken one star off for the violence and nudity - which is needed in the story but I think they could do more or just as much with these scenes if they made some attempt to minimize it in certain scenes. There's no expense spared on blood, gore and sex. Then there's the bro and sis thing that'll make your skin crawl...so if you can deal with all of that, you'll see the show for the best of what it is. Rooting for Sam and Gilly...which by contrast to all the violence surrounding them, was a soft and hopeful moment.",1530403200,,696,4.28030303030303
