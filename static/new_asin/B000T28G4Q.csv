8207241,1,B000T28G4Q,I bought the 4 DVDs for MAR thinking I would be able to own the whole series legitimately instead of downloading them somewhere. Don't be mistaken! This is only the first few episodes. They had over 50 dubbed but canned the whole DVD production for this series. In reality there are over 100 episodes to this Anime! This is not worth purchasing because you will be disappointed to only have a small fraction of the series to own.,1372204800,6,429,4.512820512820513
