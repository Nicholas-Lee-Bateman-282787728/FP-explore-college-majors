5856340,5,B00DUGBZL4,Love it!  A great workout that I could do daily.  It is easy to follow and gets the body moving.,1380672000,,96,3.75
5856341,5,B00DUGBZL4,"The walking workout is 30 minutes.  It is a light workout that is very fun, but works the problem areas.  She does a brief warm-up, then 5 minute sessions of walking integrated with exercises to work specific problem areas, like the arms, waist line, legs.  It is a good cardio workout.  Before you realize it, the 30 minutes are over.  Denise does a much better job with her choreography and instructing on what will be the next step in this video.  I really enjoy this video.",1380672000,3,477,4.488372093023256
5856342,5,B00DUGBZL4,"I have over 100 walking/exercise DVD's.  Therefore it is really hard for me to have a favorite.  Well, this has become one of them.  It is only 30 minutes long but I feel I get a good workout. I am almost 63 and for me it is great.  Now for someone younger it might not be enough.  After I do this I usually do maybe another half hour on my stationary bike later in the day.  Denise is great in this.  I only wish the cool down was a little longer.",1379721600,38,448,3.857142857142857
5856343,4,B00DUGBZL4,Worked up a good sweat. The moves change fast so it is hard to get bored. Good walking DVD. There are a lot of moves and not just marching in place. This is one of Denise's better DVDs. I only took one star off because the ques could use some improvement.,1379635200,4,255,4.019607843137255
5856344,5,B00DUGBZL4,"If you like the other walking work-outs, you will love this one.  It's a great variety on the concept of at-home walking.  The music is good.  The instructions are clear and easy to follow. Her personality is encouraging without being sugary or annoying. There is also the option to turn off the instructions and just have the music which is great if you'll want to do it often.

 It's only 30 minutes though. I hope she'll come out with some similar longer ones and/or some that you can customize. I'd like to be able to vary length to make it longer or shorter some days.",1379030400,6,573,4.419047619047619
5856345,5,B00DUGBZL4,"Love  this  workout!  It never  got  boring.... love  the  variety  of  the  workout... Denise  is  definitely  quieter  but  encouraging in  this  one  and  her  cuing  is  perfect.... I  would  say  this  was  really  made  for  beginner/ intermediate ( you  can  make  it  either one)
 You  start  with a  fun  warm  up  and  move  onto  5  separate  sequences  that  consist  of  arm  toning, side hop steps,  side  shuffles( with a  little  hip  action) jogging, squats  with  side  leg  lifts,  hamstring curls jogging w/jacks, jumping scoop ups  and a  variety  of  sport moves.... there  is  also a  cool  down  and a 10 min bonus ab  routine (standing and mat  work)
I  highly  recommend  this  one  to  anyone  wanting a  fun  exciting  workout...... this  is  much  better  than  Leslie Sansone.... because it doesn't  have repetitive  moves",1378771200,41,852,4.7443609022556394
5856346,5,B00DUGBZL4,I conduct a low impact aerobic class and I was thrilled with this DVD.  It is better than  my expectations.  It arrived on time and was in good conditions.  It is a great workout and you can work at your own level.,1378512000,9,214,4.023809523809524
5856347,4,B00DUGBZL4,"Definitely a keeper.  The workout is divided into small sections each with a different focus (arms, lower body, higher impact).  I think this adds to the variety and the intensity.  The intensity is up to the user, as low impact options are shown throughout.  The moves are easy to follow using the music only option.  The music is not typical of so much other (electronic) workout music.  For me, that's a good thing as I have enough of that already.",1378425600,25,451,4.575
5856348,4,B00DUGBZL4,"I was skeptical about puchasing this workout because I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone (and let's face it, Leslie is the Queen of walking workouts, so she sets the bar here).  I was pleasantly surprised!  I am a big fan of Denise Austin, and she is her usual bubbly self.  If you don't like Denise's personality I suggest you skip this one.  At first I thought this would be too beginner-ish, but once you get past the warmup, she picks up the pace.  There are some high impact moves (with the option to stay low impact).  I loved having the high impact options and really worked up a sweat and burned more calories than expected (I use a heart rate monitor to track calories burned).  Denise walks with two back-up people to her left and two to the right.  The two on the left do the higher impact/intensity moves and the two on the right do the lower impact moves.  The workout consists of your typical walking DVD moves (walking in place and back and forth, she calls this ""easy walk"" throughout the workout, side to side step touches, hamstring curls, etc.  She also adds in some leg, arm, and ab toning exercises throughout.  The higher impact moves include jumping jacks, lateral skater jumps, jogging, fast feet (football runs), and rapid knee repeaters for the abs.  (One thing to note, in one section of the workout, she does some jogging (or walking) in a  circle to simulate running around a track, it is beneficial to have some space for this, but you could keep it small).  The workout ends with some dynamic stretching and breathing, followed by some short static stretching.  I also did the ""bonus"" 10 minute ab routine, which I enjoyed.  It included both standing and floor ab exercises.  I think it would be a nice stand-alone workout for when you are short on time or a good add-on to other workouts.  The reason why I have to give the DVD 4 stars instead of 5 is because the music wasn't very good.  I have to admit, as the workout picked up towards the middle, the music got a little better, but I still wouldn't consider it ""good"".  It has a driving beat, so it serves its purpose, but it isn't memorable.  There is a music-only opion on the DVD.  The second reason I took off a star is that Denise says some annoying things throughout the entire walk portion of the workout (things about burning so much fat or losing a clothing size).  If you look at sample clips of the workout on youtube or other websites, you can get a better idea of what I mean.  These two things aren't deal-breakers for me.  There is one thing that was mentioned on fitness message boards about this workout that it isn't mirror cued.  This didn't bother me.  She starts on the left and I still mirror her.  I am a lefty, so I appreciate starting on that side.  She never says ""go left"" or ""go right"", she just says ""now go in the other direction"".  Overall, I think it was a fun walking workout with some higher intensity options that left me feeling great (not drained) and sweaty afterward.",1378425600,134,2989,4.4411764705882355

5856404,5,B00DUGBZL4,So easy and fun. I love that you can work out with or without Denise's instruction. A good combo of low and high impact movements in a cardio workout that does not require much space or skill.,1482969600,,192,4.216216216216216
5856405,5,B00DUGBZL4,"Love These workouts, I've been working out for a very long time , I now have back and neck problems but I still get my walk on and workouts with theses videos, they are awesome! I get 10,000 steps and a great workout :)",1481587200,2,219,4.0

5856407,5,B00DUGBZL4,Love her walking program.,1476144000,,25,5.5
5856418,3,B00DUGBZL4,"If you are one of those people who find Leslie Sansone too quiet and demure, you'll probably like this workout.  Denise (who looks FANTASTIC) is her usual super perky self (""Blast away those fat cells!"").

There are supposed to be five sections:  arm toning, slim sprints, hill climb, rolling hills and sport star.  It wasn't always clear when one section ended and the next began.  And there simply isn't enough toning work of any kind for this to be anything other than a cardio workout.  There are a few times where the impact is a little bit higher, but there are always some background exercisers keeping it all low impact.

The moves were fairly easy to follow along to, but Denise is not one to cue before the move.  She just starts doing something else and then sort of points it out.  Every workout of hers I have is like this, so I'm used to it, but it can be annoying.

The ab section is titled ""Walking Abs"", but only part of it is done standing, the rest is on the floor.

Overall, a decent 30 minute cardio workout, but not one I'll be reaching for that often.",1475625600,3,1074,4.373737373737374

5856420,5,B00DUGBZL4,"I have always liked Denise Austin's show and found her very encouraging.  This DVD is just what I was looking for as I ease back into activity after a couple of years of being a lazy sloth.  Hopefully, after a few weeks I will be able to advance to more vigorous workouts.",1471046400,,272,4.211538461538462
5856421,4,B00DUGBZL4,It's much more aerobic than what I would call walking.  It will definitely burn the fat if you do it consistently.,1470787200,,114,4.428571428571429
5856422,5,B00DUGBZL4,"Denise Austin does a good job at keeping clients/purchasers motivated.  This DVD makes walking less boring, more fun, and encourages the user to never give up.  She's peppy but not overbearingly so.  On bad weather days, I like walking in my living room and this DVD is perfect for that.  Because of an old injury, I can no longer jog making that part of the DVD impossible to do like she does so I adjust and walk through that part. Very encouraging.  Good DVD for beginners and more advanced walkers alike.  One thing I find helpful is wearing athletic shoes with good arch supports and socks because this is a good workout.",1469232000,,626,4.544642857142857

5856471,5,B00DUGBZL4,"I decided to buy this to begin a light workout after years of abandoning the gym. For three years I continued to hike anywhere between 2-4 miles 3 times a week. But then a family situation presented itself and I fell into a rutt of not doing any exercise for various reasons. Anyhow, this DVD is perfect. Its great for beginners, just make sure you follow the modified modes by the girls on the right. Don't be fooled though,  it's completely achievable but it really makes me sweat more than what I can do on an elliptical.  I couldn't recommend this enough. I have like 10 Denise Austin DVDs and I love each and every one.",1426291200,,624,4.370689655172414

5856473,5,B00DUGBZL4,"I purchased this video thinking it would be great for days when I didn't really feel like working out... Only 2 miles after all...I was wrong.  The arm move movements make this a pretty intense work out.  On ""good"" days I carry weights and it's a killer workout. Love Denise Austin!",1425600000,,282,4.509803921568627
5856474,3,B00DUGBZL4,"Denise Austins Fat Burning Walk claims that you will get 4200 steps, but according to my FitBit I didn't clear 4000, even with all of my morning activities prior to doing this. Denise does all of the basic moves that an indoor walking workout usually includes, but she adds some dancy steps, some side to side hips. She also adds skaters, and several other impact moves that she builds up to. She has it broken down into themed sections, the first section which has unweighted arm movements like bicep curls, tricep kickbacks, etc. The second is slim sprints, which has some higher impact moves, the third she classifies as hill climbs, and also has a lot of hill climbing type moves. The next is what she refers to as rolling hills, and this is sort of an interval section. Lastly there is one with soccer kicks and the like and this one they call sports star. The cool down is pretty good and thorough, but this probably has the most impact of any walking workout Ive ever done. If you don't like Denises voice, or sayings like burn that butter theres an option to do it without instruction.
Denise seems about ready to jump out of her skin in this one, she gives a little hop as she returns to the walking movement and she seems so peppy its possibly hard to take.

5856484,1,B00DUGBZL4,"I wanted to add some variety to my Leslie Sansone 'Walk Away the Pounds' collection, and I decided to get this DVD based on the high reviews. I'd say that the only good thing about this video is that it makes me appreciate Leslie Sansone so much more.

In this video, there are no warnings when Denise switches to a different movement. I feel like I lose a quarter of the workout trying to catch up with her changes. She has four other people in the video with her, and two of them do milder versions of the exercises, but they are all so squished together that it looks like even they can't even follow what Denise is doing, which is also confusing to me when I am trying to follow along.

Another thing I appreciate about Leslie Sansone is that she will do some of the counting aloud, and the music she uses has clear, easy-to-follow beats. This is helpful because I can't always see the television when I'm doing these exercises. Denise's music is not easy to follow, and there is no counting, so I kept losing the pace.

This video is also not challenging. I like Leslie Sansone's 12-minute miles - I get a really good workout. This video did not raise my heart rate. It is a very slow pace, and most of the non-walking exercises are ineffective. Some of them are inordinately fast, but not enough to get my heart rate up. Some of the non-walking exercises actually would have been better if they were done at a slower pace so that you could have time to really engage some muscle.

I was very disappointed with this video. I like some of Denise's older aerobics videos and I thought this ""fat-burning"" workout would have some kick to it.",1421884800,5,1642,4.409240924092409

5856497,5,B00DUGBZL4,I like working out with Denise Austin.  She is encouraging and you have a good workout when you are done.  It is a 30 minute workout followed with an optional 10 minute strength building routine which I do as well.  Like it a lot and would recommend it.,1401926400,,253,4.229166666666667
5856498,5,B00DUGBZL4,"Denise is peppy, upbeat, and fun.  This is the first of her exercises that I have purchased and so far I am really enjoying this one and will alternate with my Leslie Sansone (walk away the pounds) dvds to get a more beneficial workout each day.",1399507200,,245,4.326086956521739
5856499,5,B00DUGBZL4,I like Denise Austin!  She has got such an infectious personality which makes her workout fun.  The workout is great for low impact or higher impact people.  One set of girls are doing the higher impact while the other set of girls are doing the lower impact.  The steps are fairly simple to keep up with.  You will sweat during this workout.  The 10 minute toner is also a nice quick workout to tone the abs and behind and its not too strenuous either.  Hope that helps!,1399507200,2,471,4.344827586206897

5856505,5,B00DUGBZL4,I love Denise Austin workouts. This one is easy but still gets you moving.  It is perfect for those rest days to break up your excerise routine but you still finish feeling like you have done something good for your body for the day.  I walk outside before any of my work out routines but when it is raining this one fits into a great warm up and more.,1395619200,,352,4.086956521739131

I will update with results in 6 months.",1394064000,,316,4.147540983606557
5856508,5,B00DUGBZL4,Great motivation. Denise is the total opposite of me when it comes to working out but her energy keeps me moving. This DVD  is easy enough to do but really gets you moving.,1393632000,,172,4.212121212121212
5856509,5,B00DUGBZL4,"This is more challenging than Leslie Sansone's workouts, which I do love. Once your fitness level is high, though, Leslie's videos are only good for lower energy days in my opinion. This video is challenging enough to get a good workout, but light enough that I can still manage to do it on my tired pregnancy days.

People make fun of her perkiness, but I find it motivating and fun.",1393027200,10,384,4.485714285714286

5856511,5,B00DUGBZL4,"This video was outstanding.  I have another walking video of Denise's called ""Blast Away the Pounds, Indoor Walk"".  It was pretty good but this one is much better in many ways.  It moves quickly from move to move keeping it interesting.  Her cuing and transitions are much better than in some of her earlier videos.  It is really a great workout.  I was surprised how I sweat.  The extra 10 minutes of ab exercises were a great addition.  I have some other walking videos from a popular trainer and I like this one so much better because it is not monotonous!  I have nearly all of Denise's videos and this is definitely one of her best!",1388793600,,637,4.422413793103448

5856514,3,B00DUGBZL4,"I am a huge DA fan, but I did have a few problems with this video. First there is only one video on it where as she usually offers two. The ab routine cannot be added to the walking workout in the beginning set up section, which disappoints me. The moves are nothing original. She uses the same tried and true moves as on all her prior routines. Overall a good beginners workout, but I hope to see more from her in the future.",1387152000,,426,4.083333333333333

5856516,4,B00DUGBZL4,"I like this video- it provides different levels for different abilities. It is challenging for me, a 54 year old who really never worked out before!

5856517,1,B00DUGBZL4,"She seems out of her element with this one almost as if she wants to take to take off running, but then remembering, ""Oh yeah, that's right, it's supposed to be low impact.""  It does seem disjointed.  I didn't like how it flowed.  Guess I'm too used to Leslie Sansone.",1385510400,10,268,4.32
5856518,5,B00DUGBZL4,"I just got this DVD and I really love it. It is such a good walk workout-- I think one of the best walking workouts I have done. I really enjoy it and the time goes by very quickly. There is nothing dancy for a non-dancer like me, even though Denise Austin likes to throw in dance moves sometimes. The routine takes some room for those who have a small space. You walk back and forth to the side doing side steps and walking to the side. You also walk to the front. My apartment is a little small to do more than three walks to the front. She usually does about four, so not too much of a difference. There are knee raises, walking in place, and other things like that. It is great for beginners or those who are very obese ( as I am). The routine lasts a good 30 minutes. I usually do two workouts together when I do this tape for a total of an hour workout. Oh, and lower impact moves are offered when she does higher impact which I really like. The only problem I have with the video is that the background exercisers are all very young and look like they are professional models instead of people who actually do the workouts.",1384819200,27,1130,4.140909090909091
5856519,3,B00DUGBZL4,"This workout is fine if you're an absolute beginner.  It's enough to get your heart rate up and burn some calories, but it's not enough - I don't believe - for serious weight loss.  Plus, I swear Denise is missing a screw or two.  After all the years in this business, you'd think someone would have taught her how to instruct a DVD.  There's music for a reason; i.e., using the music to move to in time to the beat.  Instead she, once again, continuously moves faster or slower than the music which is quite off putting.  She also doesn't give much notice for some changes of movement.  One minute you're doing kicks or simple marches, and the next she says that you're moving on to Charleston type steps, and before you can blink, you're already doing them with no instruction on how they're done.  And also, there's never enough repetition to really work a specific set of muscles.  You do a particular movement for one set and then it's on to something new.
Apart from the fact that the background exercisers know what they're doing, you could swear this was put together at the last minute with no practice or anything.  I should have learned from the last couple of Denise Austin DVD purchases I made, but I keep thinking she'll finally get it right.  After watching and doing this, it's clear she never will.",1384560000,2,1315,4.529661016949152
5856520,5,B00DUGBZL4,"Being 54 and not able to really do the high impact/ high energy type exercises, I was looking for just the right type of DVD.  This one is well laid out and gives you 30 minutes of cardio.  Denise is pleasant and encouraging and keeps you going.  What is nice is that she gives alternatives for easier movements.  I have begun to have a few knee issues and have to be a little more careful but am able to do most all of the workout.  I am happy with this and have been using it for several weeks.",1384128000,,496,4.020408163265306
5856521,3,B00DUGBZL4,"I'm no rookie to walking work out videos. I fitness walk outdoors and can do up to 3 miles with Leslie Sansone's videos. I was hoping that this new Denise Austin video would be just ""something different"" to my routine - boy! was I wrong.
I thought that (because Denise is a Baby Boomer too), this would be something that I could do. I forgot that Denise is not your average middle aged lady, but a teenager in a 50 - something year old's body. There was no way that I could keep up with her. The routine is not simple but a lot of changing steps that are difficult to follow. The people with her in the video are all 20 somethings who obviously have dance training.

The thing I like about Leslie Sansone's walk at home videos is that she and all of the people in the workout are very ordinary. The steps are easy to follow and I feel as though I'm working out with people like myself.

Perhaps Denise Austin could target another walking video to people her own age. She's sell a lot of them!",1383264000,4,992,4.21578947368421
5856522,3,B00DUGBZL4,"The workout is just so-so.  A lot of it seems just slapped together or like she's making it up as she goes along.  There are times when we are literally running around in circles, because it seems like she's run out of ideas.  There's a sudden, short, almost frantic segment of higher impact exercises near the end, as though she realizes the workout is coming to an end and that she might want to step up the aerobic content.  Low-impact options also are given, which are basically just to keep walking.  In short, not a very inspired workout.  The young women doing the routine seem to be lackadaisical about it, including Denise herself.  Oh, and her husky voice repeating, ""Easy walk!"" every time she wants us to resume walking in place gets a bit tedious after a while.  Still think Leslie Sansone is the best option for ""home walking"" routines.",1382572800,4,850,4.62

I see  Slim in  6 and  JCore moves incorporated in both the 30 minute  walk and  the 10 minute ab workout.  If anything is too difficult there is always the option to do a lighter move or just the basic walk.  I am pleased with this purchase.,1380844800,,315,4.016393442622951
5856528,5,B00DUGBZL4,I ordered this after using the old walking video for months.  I LOVE this one.  It is a tougher workout that uses many different muscles.

This is much better and there's more variety in the moves. She has some higher intensity moves. But don't expect to sweat much!  It's beg/int level.
