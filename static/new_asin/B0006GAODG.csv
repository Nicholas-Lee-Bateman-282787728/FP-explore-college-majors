2183230,5,B0006GAODG,"This is a great movie, dealing with a girl who is trying to be her own person. It stays on topic. It doesn't get lost in the sub-plots. I hope there is a First Daughter 2!",1096243200,6,171,3.7777777777777777
2183231,2,B0006GAODG,This movie is exactly like Chasing Liberty. I didn't believe the critics at first. So I decide to see it for myself. Believe me the critics hit it dead on. I enjoyed better this movie better than Liberty. For one reason only because Amerie Rogers who played Sam Mackenzie best friend. She was funny and hilarious. Save your money and time. Because this movie is already out on DVD is called Chasing Liberty.,1096156800,2,407,4.589041095890411
2183242,5,B0006GAODG,"Found this movie by watching Operation Christmas, which just happens to be the BEST Christmas move ever made, and fell in love with Marc Blucas, which lead me to find other movies he had played in. I love this movie because of MARC. MARC is dashing, debonair and a  beautiful dancer, and his smile would melt any heart. In fact I wish the camera had shown his face more than it did. I watch the dance scenes every night -- he is so smooth. I only wished someone would have had the good sense to make a sequel -- our loss.",1515196800,,521,4.158415841584159

The casting is perfect.  Katie Holmes perfect for the part, Marc Blucas is a heart throb,  Michael Keaton another great and very natural performance.

2183327,4,B0006GAODG,Good movie but not quite as good as What A Girl Wants.  The acting is good and the story is nice.  It's just not as entertaining as a 5 star movie should be.

2183370,5,B0006GAODG,"Katie Holmes and Marc Blucas did a fantastic job in this movie.  If you watch it you might find as I did that Katie looks like the great Audrey Hepburn at that age.  The story is pretty much a beautiful love story.  Everyone knows how it will end but it's not about how it begins and how it ends but the journey it takes you on.  The music was great and the dancing was wonderful.  I will have to admit I have watched it several times to see the dancing and hear the music.  Don't  skip over the credits at the end because you will miss two really great songs.  The theme song that is performed by Tamia at the end,"" I DANCE IN MY DREAMS"" is one of the most beautiful songs I have heard in a very long time.  Michael Keaton does a good job as the president.  His love for Samantha is always obvious.  The story takes Sam, as she prefers to be called, to California to college where she meets James.  If I told you all of the story it might ruin it for the first time viewers.  Also, watch the deleted scenes and the behind the scenes comments.",1442275200,2,1043,4.078817733990148

All she wants is to fit in and be part of the mainstream of the things going on at college.  She doesn't want security lurking around her all the time.  Unbeknown to her, a young man comes into her life and makes her feel normal, but he is really part of security.  I love what transpires between them and what happens when she finds out about him.  This movie pulls at your heartstrings but is fun to watch, too.  I would recommend it to those who like a love story that you just know that the two people should be with each other but circumstances make it impossible.  Good movie.",1440374400,,679,4.291338582677166

2183378,2,B0006GAODG,"This teen-oriented romantic comedy focuses on the daughter of the President of the United States. Katie Holmes stars as Samantha MacKenzie,the young daughter of President John MacKenzie who has been in the public eye for her entire life.

The story is about the events in the First Daughter's life such as becoming a college freshman at Redmond University;acting normally in school just like the rest of the students by removing the Secret Service Agents keeping track of her;the friendship that she has developed; and the romance between her a fellow student who obviously has political motivations in getting to know her.

This is another film limited for young viewers as the story is both simplistic and formulaic. Also,everything that happens becomes predictable before the scenes occur. Too bad that Katie Holmes' charm could not lift it from becoming an average movie. Overall,everything it does not have something original or refreshing",1439078400,,944,5.286666666666667

2183439,4,B0006GAODG,"""First Daughter"" is silly, cheesy, unrealistic, and sometimes eye-roll-worthy.  The storybook format at the beginning and end are especially cheesy, the concept has been been done before, and the acting is mediocre at best.  All that being said, why would I give it 4 stars?  I am not judging it alongside Oscar worthy movies here...if you take it for what it is and don't expect cinematic excellence, you might just enjoy it.  It's one of those guilty pleasure movies that I find myself enjoying despite my better judgement.  Marc Blucas is super hot and enough reason to watch in itself ;)  The relationship deveopment between the main characters is cute, and the (predictable) twist was crushing.  I really wish it had a more climactic ending though...a passionate kiss at least...but the ending is a bit lacking, and it goes back to the silly storybook style.  Anyway, it's a cute little chick flick that I would recommend if you like these types of movies :)",1407628800,,963,4.829268292682927
2183440,4,B0006GAODG,"I don't know why:  maybe it is the idealized form of parenting, maybe it is the superficial insight into a childhood in the White House, maybe it is the orientation into life as it could be separate from both of those things.  And, of course, maybe it is the love story intertwined, also new to the protagonist played by Katie Holmes.

But, occasionally, this funny little film is my perfect escape.

The mother is overplayed and didactic, the father by turns stern and humorous, trusting his daughter to get it right and deeply disappointed when, in some college high jinks, gets it wrong.

The music is outstanding and the idea of this story as a fable is perfectly presented in this Forest Whittaker film.  I am not familiar with the lead's work, Katie Holmes, but this one I enjoy.  She has spark and seriousness and an underlying boiling point that is guarded by longstanding training in political protocol.

All of this to say, it is light, it is airy, it is a fairy tale, there is love in the end.  What's not to like?",1407542400,2,1025,4.5271739130434785

This was the better of the two, though that isn't saying much, and both have the exact same plot twist.  I think the biggest problem I have with both is:  with all of the misery in this world, how are you supposed to cry and feel sorry for the MOST privileged girl in the country.  She doesn't have enough freedom!  Waaaah!  She doesn't have a real boyfriend!  Waaaah!  She has to act responsibly and not become a drunken college fool!  Waaaah!
Hey, here's an idea -- send the 'First Daughter' to live on her own in a third world country for a semester.  See if maybe that changes her outlook on life a little.
Also, I think they may have had the president in this movie get a third term...
If you would like a 1 star version of this movie, watch ""Chasing Liberty"" instead.",1389312000,,883,4.329268292682927

Margaret Colin is excellent as the ""First Lady"".  The resemblance between Margaret and Katie is remarkable.  You really would think she was Katie's real mother!  Michael Keaton as the ""President"" dealing with the fact that his little girl is all grown up does a terrific job.  A movie not to miss...",1389139200,,581,5.117021276595745

I really love watching Katie Holmes convey so much with her facial expressions and how she experiences such a wide range of emotions in this film from newly in love to exuriating heartbreak and betrayal.

One of my favorite scenes is at the end when she is attending the dance at the white house.  Her dance scene with Michael Keaton is so playful and flirty.  Of course the final scene with her Secret Agent Boyfriend.

This ranks up there with The Prince And Me, with the world the way it is I look forward to this kind of Movie. If they do make another sequel to this, they should keep the Katie and Marc and other stars this is a mistake they made with The Prince and Me I did not like the sequel as well when they changed the actors.

The ending is not too over the top sweet, but still expectantly happy with the promise of happy ending possibilities.
 ""Chasing Liberty"" was out the same year & it has zero appeal... just a huge disappointment. if you liked this movie don't bother with Chasing Liberty,which has Mandy Moore at turns over the top starry eyed & then bratty like 12 year old.

Marc Blucas, was just so impressive.  I hope to see him in more acting.  I''ve seen him in Necessary Roughness.  Marc has put on a little weight, different parts require different looks, he's  a good actor., M.Keaton, you looked good, just like ""Batman""
Marc,I will be looking forward to your future, appearances.
I can only tell you I bought two copies of First Daughter, and they both came from Amazon.  If you need more proof, let me know and I will furnish you with my purchase order number.
I watch it at least twice a day,and enjoy every minute of it.  of yes, I noticed someone mentioned it was great for maybe a 20 year old, but I am well past 65, and I believe it is for all ages, with good taste, and quality is good for all.
Thank you, so much for a calming, classic, story.  I suggest this for all ages, class, never goes out of style.

Not only did my wife purchase it but I had to watch it.  Having survived the film I'll say that for what it is it wasn't bad.  It's the old poor little rich girl story modernized.

2183542,5,B0006GAODG,"I absolutely love this coming of age film that is a fictitious look at what could happen if the president's daughter went to college.  It's also a very touching love story.  To start I have to say that I had a very hard time finding this film!  I had seen a preview a long time ago, but didn't see it in the theatre.  Finally through multiple searches (um...President's daughter...er...no) it came up.  I rented it on i-tunes and then loved it so much I bought the dvd.  This has got to be one of the most under-rated films in this genre and I wonder why when it's so well done!  I have read that it had many negative reviews, but keeping things in perspective, most movies of this genre are marked down by critics. Most of these well meaning people are males over 40 years of age who can't really understand why the film doesn't appeal to them (lol).  As someone who is a fan of this type of film, I have to say that it's one of the best in my collection and is comparable to movies such as ""The Princess Diaries"" and ""What a Girl Wants"".  It also has a great balance between touching moments, both happy and sad, and humour too.  It's one of my favourite love stories and is really enjoyable which is why I gave it 5 stars.  There is very little potentially offensive material which includes the odd mild swear and one quiet use of Christ's name, mention of birth control, and one incident of over-drinking as a minor.  I also enjoyed the effective use of music such as Sinatra's ""The Way You Look Tonight"" which added to the emotional intensity of many scenes.

Samantha is the president's daughter and goes to Redmond College (thrilled that my Mom went there too).  In a gentle exaggeration of what could happen and what we hope the real president wouldn't do, she goes with a full security team and secret service agents.  This really hampers her ability to have any chance of enjoying the college experience.  Sam meets James who is in one of her classes and the two quickly bond.  Finally Sam is able to be herself, and as they fall in love, she enjoys some freedom and independence.  The romantic chemistry between Sam (Katie Holmes) and James (Marc Blucas) is just outstanding and they are a very stunning couple. This film showcases Katie Holmes' beauty and good acting ability, and in fact the whole film is very well acted.  At first I wasn't wild about how the president is portrayed, mostly because the president is a bit a jerk at times in how he relates to his daughter and seems to put his political aspirations above his daughter's happiness.  At times I imagined how it would be if Colin Firth was playing the role, but I guess he's not qualified with the British accent, haha.

This film also highlights the problems that famous people face with being hounded by the paparazzi.  In the film Samantha mentions that the only time she had privacy was in utero.  This reminded me of the famous quote by Queen Elizabeth's favourite governess Marilyn Crawford, who said ""Royals are only private in the womb.""  Such a sad commentary about what has happened to many of our celebrities today!

My only disappointment is that it does have a bit of a bitter-sweet ending and that it was sort of a set up for sequel that never happened. I would have loved to see the continuing story!  All I know is that it's one dvd that I will watch over and over again, and I hope someday the producers will realize they do have a very good product and come out with a blu-ray version.",1348272000,,3480,4.458135860979463

2183557,5,B0006GAODG,"There have been MANY  REAL First Daughters, but in the reviews noone mentions that this might film might actually be based on a REAL LOVE story in the Gerald Ford White House. His daughter, Susan Ford, married her Secret Service agent, I believe. The audience might not even know there WAS a President called ""Gerald Ford""!
So I enjoyed it cause it reminded me of the REAL press at the time that  a REAL ""Love Story"" actually happened in the White House. Didn't see ""Chasing Liberty"". Caught ""First Daughter"" on FX channel. Thoroughly LOVED it. Clean, wholesome poking fun at the tabloids that cover the REAL ""First Daughters"". The script uses all the girls who grew up in the White House for its basis - up to and including the Bush twins bouts with drinking...
The chemistry between Mark Blucas and Katie Holmes  - dancing to the wonderful carefully selected music and their first date at the fair  - was gloriously innocent! How original is that!
I didnt' realize Forrest Whitaker was the director. Joy to find that out.
Just a pleasant film all around.
Everyone in the film seemed commited to making it as real as possible. I wonder if Susan Ford ever saw it?",1187568000,6,1163,4.631067961165049

2183559,4,B0006GAODG,"To be perfectly honest, after the first hour I thought I had the whole movie figured out... and then it twisted in the opposite direction and I was totally shocked!

Katie Holmes plays Samantha MacKenzie, the President's Daughter who is trying to fit in and have a normal college experience. Only there are some things in her way, such as security guards following her everywhere, press close on her tail, and she just can't get rid of her White House mannerisms that kinda make everyone around her flinch and go ""what was that?"" Amerie plays her roommate Mia who is used to lots of attention and has trouble letting it go. Seemingly perfect timing, Sam meets her perfect guy (Marc Blucas playing James)... a little too perfect at first, as they are both brainiacs, kind, funny and well, he's crazy about her. It seems everything is going to work out perfectly! I was almost disappointed when the movie twisted in a completely different direction!

While I was at first shocked, I quickly got over it and was pleasantly surprised and proud that the script succeeded in being unpredictable (because most movies are predictable). Then I became disappointed. It seemed the film was going steady in a good direction, and I felt kind of let down, like they could have done more, like the story could have developed into something truly charming and touching, however it seems they decided to veer away from the romance of the film and focus more on the main character's adolescance and learning about herself. It seemed to me like the movie was strolling along and then suddenly dropped off a cliff, however safely landing.

It was not unpleasant. Despite the twist, they managed to give it a cute (although almost cliff hanger) ending, and a beautiful final scene. I must admit I was slightly disappointed with the outcome between Sam and James, but I guess I can't always be satisfied!

A very entertaining film however some letdowns and [I feel] almost unnecessary twists. Nevertheless, I have no doubt you will enjoy it as I did. The script is witty and aimed more at preteens and teens then adults, as it is completely clean, and some of the jokes just won't reach adults as they are just not very funny, however I think I might have laughed at them when I was younger so it's not totally hopeless.

The acting makes up for most of these faults however, as Katie Holmes was charming and fun to watch, as was Marc Blucas who isn't exactly ugly either!",1177372800,4,2450,4.688372093023256
2183560,2,B0006GAODG,"I give only two stars to this Fox's romantic comedy ""First Daughter"" not because of its unlucky resemblance with Mandy Moore's ""Chasing Liberty"" or the acting of Katie Holmes, which is not bad at all. She is sweet and cute even though the film completely misses its target audiences by including her embarrassing `table dancing' sequences.

No, I am disappointed by something else. ""First Daughter"" is pleasant, maybe too pleasant for me. I was thinking that the film is about the romantic life of Katie Holmes' character Samantha, only daughter of US President Mackenzie (Michael Keaton) running for the second term (reminding us of the real-life counterpart George W. Bush and his twin daughters). What happens if Samantha goes to college and falls in love with another student?

Though some hints are given, the film wisely removes direct mention to the politics in real life. You don't know much about the president himself or his policies and party (except that he is very likable), but that kind of decision is understandable because the film is meant to be a romantic comedy that can be enjoyed by everyone.

Still ""First Daughter"" does not have much romance in it. When the film should be romantic with Samantha's romance with the resident adviser Marc Blucas, it fails to be so, its romance interrupted by the unnecessary plot twist and the film's attitude after that point, which takes itself too seriously. The silly antics like water slide episode and Katie in blue bikini do not help, and neither does the subplot about Samantha's friendship with her roommate (played by Amerie).

The film is directed by Forest Whitaker who won Oscar for his terrific acting in ""The Last King of Scotland."" I don't know what attracted him to this film, but I know his orthodox approach does not work here, ending up with rather tepid storytelling and bland characters. We need wit, satire, or at least biting kind of humor, and wilder romance and more imagination and fantasy. Katie Holmes is charming, but her getting drunk and doing table dance does not exactly make her so more.",1174521600,,2078,4.894886363636363

I got the double pack because it was cheaper and decided to have a look at First Daughter.

I had to turn off the movie after 15 minutes.  Katie Holmes's character had the personality of cardboard.  She seems to spend her time walking around with a fake smile plastered on her face pretending to have fun.

These movies are always the same - rich girl wants a real life, she rebels and falls in love with some handsome guy who looks like a model, he teachs her about real life, they fall in love, they either have a fight or betray each other, then get back together at the end.

Katie Holmes bored me and so did the guy she fell in love with.  I could see what was going to happen next.  The whole movie was so sickly sweet I literally wanted to throw up.

2183564,4,B0006GAODG,"The plot itself - about the First daughter who went to College in Carlifornia, far away from the White House, in order to be normal and meet friends may be clich. Yet the movie on the whole can still hand out nice surprises every now and then. Katie Holmes has a unique face and looks intelligent enough to want to be independent as well as not to disappoint the First family. More importantly, Marc Blucas (her love interest) is not like the stereotyped Prince Charming for a teenager. At least he also looks sophisticated and mature and gives a strong case why the first daughter would fall for him. The two make an attractive couple and are on the same wavelength when they share the views on science etc.

The twist in the movie, at least I didn't see it coming, is good. Considering how many such plots have appeared on screen, I must say this one at least is not as predictable and does give me some credibility as a story about real people. The President and First Lady are not given a significant part here. The young couple already is a good reason to watch the movie. The love songs that accompanied the ball room dances are pleasant and well-chosen. The First Daughter stands out in his genre with its creativity and credible performance by the leading couple.

Sad that this new generation hasn't the concept of a good movie or that matter, good music. No, if there isn't blood, guts, sex, violence or profanity, no interest is at all desired.

What frustrates me the most is that the ""adults,"" who are suppose to be mature, steer in their direction and reaps the benefits. I'll call it blood money.

Then they have the audacity to be appalled when all the school shootings happen and/or other tragedies occur. It doesn't help that young people are encouraged to do so because of a movie.

Yes, I blame the movies and this thing they call music! Not to mention, where ARE the parents? Schools, the stereo/CD players and the televisions are NOT baby-sitters nor are good matters and good morals embedded. Schools are not the same.

2183570,3,B0006GAODG,"If you're looking for a good family film with clean language, clean scenes, and a clean script, you couldn't go wrong here. FIRST DAUGHTER has all those prerequisites.

The film introduces us to Samantha (Katie Holmes, PIECES OF APRIL) who happens to be the daughter of the current President of the United States -- played well by Michael Keaton (BATMAN). She's on her way to college and adulthood but with little emotional support from her mother and father. Every aspect of her life has been laid out for her, and now she has to try and find out ""who"" she is. Is she really happy? Does she have an opinion on ...well ...anything?

The film pulls us through her early time at Redmond University but does so using a lopsided script and rushed revelations. She has to contend with the overbearing status of her secret service contingent, her every move being tracked by the tabloids, and a roommate who has personal baggage of her own.

Although the film was at times touching (especially when Keaton and Holmes are on screen together as father and daughter), the script rushes us through any trials and tribulations, as well as life-changes regarding parenthood and growing up.

Also the movie felt like an overly sweet pill that was difficult to swallow. Even though Samantha had problems, there was never anything even remotely obstacle-like that she couldn't have easily overcome with her available resources (as shown when she takes her friends on a trip in an Air Force One jet; which, by the way, would NEVER happen, so credibility was seriously lost there).

But I'm sure this film will have a pretty powerful appeal to the preteens and early teens out there. And parents can rest easy knowing that there's very little (if anything) in this slight movie that'll corrupt the pliable young minds of their kids.",1130976000,5,1815,4.80448717948718

2183573,3,B0006GAODG,"I remember when I first heard about this movie several years ago, about how it was the brainchild of Jerry O'Connell, that goofy guy from equally goofy movies like Kangaroo Jack and Tomcats. When I finally saw this movie, I realized that I couldn't expect anything less from Jerry O'Connell. I'm not quite sure if that's a compliment... but I still enjoyed this movie. It's very formula, very sappy, yet there's something about Katie Holmes and Marc Blucas that just sorta clicked.

This is a sweet little movie about daddy's (the President's) little girl, who just wants to have a normal life without the photographers or the swarming secret service. Her respite is a college 3,000 miles away from that big, white house she lives in. Her conflicts include a jealous roommate who's used to being the center of attention, bad press because of her ""crazy"" behavior at a couple of parties, and meeting and falling for the totally hot resident advisor (Blucas). Michael Keaton co-stars as the President and Jerry O'Connell provides an unneeded, extremely cheesy narration at the beginning and end.

Yes, this movie is very similar to Chasing Libery, a film that I actually like better, mainly because Mandy Moore's turn as the First Daughter had more punch and less sap. The one thing I liked better about First Daughter is the way the ""big twist"" is handled, which I won't giveaway here... though I will say that in First Daughter I was surprised and in Chasing Liberty I expected it. I probably didn't expect the twist in this movie because I had already seen it once and didn't think the movies would be quite that similar, but oh well, it was handled better here. Added all up, however, Chasing Liberty wins... but certainly don't ignore this one.

And there was certainly good chemistry between her and Marc Blucas (who I had no complaints about on viewing him sans sweatshirt).

Katie's character tip-toes around rebellion and always comes running back. This one is more of a ""family"" movie, (to be watched by younger children)

I was SHOCKED to find out that in this movie, the daughter's boyfriend was also a ""secret agent"". Clearly they have no shame in details..

Comparing the two is something that  can't be ignored, and this movie is empty, shallow scripted, and weak. We never see the stronger girl, the wilder girl, anything more than she was. In that we, these movies couldn't be more different.

It is basically on the same level. Chasing Liberty was almost the same movie as this one but I enjoyed both equally. See this movie for a wholesome good movie.,1119225600,6,712,4.442748091603053
2183580,2,B0006GAODG,"What is life like for the daughter of the U.S. president when it comes time to cut the apron strings and move to another state to attend college? This is the main idea behind ""First Daughter"", a film about a girl who has spent most of her life in the spotlight and longs to be treated like an ordinary person.

This movie follows a typical movie formula. We have all seen plenty of films involving young adults moving away to go to college and this movie isn't much different. It follows this young girl as she moves far away from her parent's residence at the White House; gets followed around by security personnel; meets a guy and falls for him; and struggles with the media to protect her privacy and reputation.

What makes this movie fail in the end is its lack of any real story and the lack of any feeling for the characters. Michael Keaton's portrayal as the U.S. president isn't that good, and you really get annoyed by his indifference toward his daughter. Actress Margaret Colin seems out of place as well. She plays Keaton's wife, and she has very little to say in this movie.

If there is anything redeeming about this film, it would have to be Katie Holmes in the lead role. Katie is a pretty woman, but in a cute and innocent way. This makes her character that much more compelling. She seems so helpless and so sweet, you can't help but root for her to triumph over the media and its annoying and unethical treatment of her. And you hope she can work things out with her parents and live the life she wants to live without interference.

Overall, this isn't a very good movie. It isn't terrible, but it is mostly predictable and the performances (with the exception of Katie Holmes) are not very memorable. It's the type of film that will be enjoyed most by people who can relate to it; i.e, teenagers and college students who can empathize with the young woman's problems and concerns.",1116547200,15,1903,4.491329479768786

Their scenes together are very charming - I loved when they shared midnight chocolate cake and when they danced at the Inaugural Ball in one of the last scenes.  Keaton's President character makes you wish that he actually was the President.  The soundtrack is fantastic too and leaves me wondering why it was never released as an audio CD.  I especially loved the songs they played when Sam and her parents were being driven to her school and when Sam, Mia, and the group were frolicking on the water slide.

2183585,2,B0006GAODG,"In what has to be one of the biggest ruses in the history of Hollywood last year somebody sold the exact same script to two directors and had their movie made twice. How else do we describe the eerily similar ""First Daughter"" and ""Chasing Liberty."" Let's be honest, if these movies had come out 5 years apart people still would have raised eyebrows at the similarities.  That said this movie was quite bad and I just don't know who would be interested in this film. If anything it says that we like our movies just as we like our politicians: light and fluffy. There is no edge here at all. Good luck figuring out which party this president is supposed to represent (I'm guessing Republican, but it is highly debatable).  Plus this film's idea of rebellion is...um...sliding down a hill? Dancing on a table? Drinking alcohol? Wow...hardcore. I also find it a bit disingenuous when these princess movies make money off telling kids that really it's best to be ""normal"" and that being privileged is overrated, and then following it up with a scene of unrestrained greed. The reason they do that is that in reality all kids want to be rich far more than they want to be normal and the filmmakers know this. I also have to somewhat dump on Katie Holmes performance here. For somebody who seems to have potential choosing this cream puff role did nothing to impress me.  Even when she was supposed to be angry in this film she came off as timid. My question to you is this: Can Katie Holmes play any role other than Joey from ""Dawson's Creek?"" Can she play angry, mean, crazy. . .or is sweet all she does? In this case she was severely upstaged by Amerie who played her roommate. I also did not like the way that the film seemed to have no new idea's in its head. For example, how clich&eacute;d to have it so that Holmes' character doesn't like ""Hail to the Chief."" For most of the film I didn't have the energy to build up a strong dislike it, but then it kept going and going, with happy ending piled on top of happy ending. By the time they got done piling happiness on me I was quite angry to say the least. **1/4",1112054400,5,2113,4.398976982097187

Guess which premiered in theaters first? ""Chasing Liberty"". Guess why - because it was better, and rather than release ""First Daughter"" at the same time, the studio delayed it so that it would have a better chance at the box office. The only problem is, by the time this film came out, it looked like a copy cat of ""Chasing Liberty"". I did not go see it in theaters because it looked like a second-rate version of Mandy Moore's movie. For a cheap rental fee, I was willing to check it out, and was not impressed.

I was very disappointed once the dvd arrived as half of the really funny scenes have been taken out of the dvd.  I can only assume that a different version aired in theatres in Australia.  I'd wait to get the Directors cut or purchase it overseas as this DVD version is no where near as good as the version I saw at the cinema.

But this little nutrition-less-but-nevertheless-sweet confection? I stayed up past 1:20 AM to finish it. I don't care what anyone says and I'm like, 33-it's a darling movie.

I've never been a Holmes' fan, but she is just so likeable and pretty in this-very natural and I thought appropriate in terms of playing someone just get getting her bearings. She gets to wear some sweet duds in this movie ala formal dresses.

The little father-daughter connection between her and Michael Keaton was also sweet-I wanted to call my dad and tell him I loved him after watching it. What was up with the Mom though? She seemed kinda off and she gave a look to Katie's love interest at the ball that was a little drunk and pervy I think.

I also thought the chemistry between her and the James guy was great-they would make really cute kids. Tell them to hook it up and grace the world with some uber pretty children. And the best part is the chemistry is like, PG rated, so you don't have the cover the kids' eyes at all-all you get is a couple kisses and a pretty mild shimi-shimi dance from Katie in hot pants during her not-so ""wild""acting out moment.

All in all, a very sweet movie with a really asthetically pleasing cast(think of walking clearasil and noxema and whitestrip advertisments all melded into one-or uh, like several-body/bodies)- and don't miss seeing Amerie as Katie's roomie-she's a really great singer-in her movie debut.

The story is that the ""first daughter"" goes to college at an unnamed school on the west coast (it's filmed on the beautiful UCLA Westwood campus).  The first daughter wants nothing more than to have a typical, normal life.  That is not exactly obtainable, however:  the Secret Service agents make having a reasonable life, difficult, if not impossible.  As a result, the first daughter takes affirmative steps to normalize her life, unaware that she is still within the protective cover of the secret service.  The twist is that she falls in love with a secret service -- although she is unaware of it at the time.  That's one of the best parts in the movie.  Overall, Katie Holmes is not the best actress, and it is plausible that someone else could have played her part better.

FIRST DAUGHTER is about the president's daughter (played by Katie Holmes, who I find really likeable). She feels like she's being treated like a little kid, even though she's heading off to college, and she just wants some more freedom. Of course, she gets watched over all the time, and when she gets to college it isn't any different. Along the way, she makes friends with Mia, her roommate that's always looking for a good time, and James, her RA. Just as Samantha starts to fall for James, she finds out that he has a huge secret.

I enjoyed FIRST DAUGHTER, but the storyline was really predictable and somewhat forgettable. It seemed like it was trying too hard to be the next Princess Diaries, and if that's your kind of movie, I'd recommend getting FIRST DAUGHTER.

2183593,4,B0006GAODG,"FIRST DAUGHTER has Forest Whitaker at the helm and with this gifted man's reputation he manages to salvage what could have been a bit of superficial fluff into a quiet statement about the private lives of public persons.

The theme is straight forward enough: President of USA (Michael Keaton) is running for second term at the time his only perfect daughter Samantha (Katie Holmes) is off to college.  Her father and mother (Margaret Colin) accompany her to her California college with all the fanfare and security guards one might expect.  Sam wants to be 'just a normal person' and talks her assigned roommate Mia (Amerie Rogers) into sticking with her.  Despite the restrictions of 'life in a glass house', Sam finds joys and trials in trying to be a private person drowned in a public persona.  She falls for James her Residence Advisor (Marc Blucas) and that starts the errors in judgment that result in her being recalled to the White House until her father's election is over.  How Sam resolves her identity against the overwhelming odds and seeks her own existence is the punch of the closing of the film.

In less than capable hands than those of Whitaker and his fine cast this film would have been extraneous bubble gum.  It just shows that good folks can give a weak plot a bit of pizzazz and manage to make some important social commentary despite a weak script.

2183597,3,B0006GAODG,"Do not confuse ""First Daughter"" with ""Chasing Liberty,"" even though both films are about the daughter of the President of the United States and the title of the former was the working title of the latter.  Actually these two films are a lot closer than ""Armageddon"" and ""Deep Impact,"" but there was never a notion of the two films battling it out to be the best President's daughter movie of 2004 the way those films dueled for best object from space trying to hit the Earth movies did back in the summer of 1998.

Having succeeded in progressing beyond the role of Joey that got her noticed on ""Dawson's Creek"" in films such as ""Wonder Boys"" and ""Pieces of April,"" Katie Holmes is forced to take a step backwards in this 2004 romantic comedy.  The same thing can be said for her leading man, Marc Blucas, who had his part in ""The Alamo"" left pretty much on the cutting room floor and is basically back to doing the Riley Finn character he played on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""  Both Holmes and Blucas deserve better, but while the script is dressed up with the trappings of serious things, once you get passed those you are talking strictly predictable clichs.  Although director Forest Whitaker adds some lyricism with the narration and opening sequence, the script keeps this one from really going anywhere good.

Samantha Mackenzie (Holmes) is the only daughter of a first term President (Michael Keaton), and she is heading off to college during an election year.  Of course Sam yearns to be a normal kid when she arrives at the University of Redmond in California, but that is pretty hard when the school band and drunken frat boys are all doing ""Hall to the Chief,"" and pretty much impossible when reporters are sitting outside your dorm and you sit in class surrounded by roped off empty seats and a buffer of Secret Service agents between her and her classmates.  Sam's only initial success is in convincing her skeptical roommate, Mia Thompson (Amerie), to stick around for the fun and be the stalwart best bud through the nonsense to come.  Then she meets her new resident advisor, James Lansome (Blucas), and discovers for the first time in her life somebody with who she can be herself.

The only problem with that is that given the political world in which she grew up it is hard to believe that Samantha Mackenzie ever had the chance to develop a real sense of self.  However, ""First Daughter"" has a bigger problem in trying to keep things real.  Since I started voting for President there have been a lot of teenage daughters in the White House, from Amy Carter to Chelsea Clinton and the Bush twins, and the basic rule has been to leave them alone (remember when ""Saturday Night Live"" apologized for making jokes about Chelsea?).  Clearly one source of inspiration for this movie has been the exception to this rule, which is when a first daughter is busted for underage drinking, because as we all know if a teenage girl makes a major mistake like that it is fodder for the national grist mill.

But ""First Daughter"" jumps the gun on this one.  This is a film that has Joan Rivers making a joke about Sam looking like a terrorist had dressed her while the President is making thinly veiled references to exactly that possibility.  Even Jay Leno is making jokes on ""The Tonight Show"" about the way this teenage girl dresses before she actually does anything to embarrass her parents.  The justification is that Sam is a target throughout the entire film.  Students protesting her father's administration feel free to call her out on the quad and reporters with their cameras are apparently allowed to camp out in front of her dorm, when they are not stalking her out on the streets.  Yet in the real world such things would not be allowed and first daughters tend to be surrounded by a cadre of friends who fiercly protect their privacy.

There is a moment in ""First Daughter"" where the film touches us when Sam is out jogging with her secret service detail, stops running, and breaks down.  The agents keep their distance and the sense of the painful bubble of isolation in which she lives her all too public life becomes palatable.  Her life has reached rock bottom at that point and as the rest of the film quickly plays by the numbers without trying to build on the emotions it has finally revealed.  Sam's mother (Margaret Colin) turns out to be a political Machiavelli, the election becomes more important than education, and the last act of the film disintegrates into real basic connect the dots to hurry along to the ending (despite some nice moments by Keaton).  Throughout the film Sam is being urged to say what she thinks and not what is written for her, but the big payoff for this I was expecting never showed up.  Then there is the final shot of the movie, which is supposed to be the requisite happy ending.  But ask yourself if Samantha really wants to be doing what she is doing given what she is wearing and what time it is?  Just so you know, the answers to both parts of the question would be ""No.""

In terms of the obvious double-bill with ""Chasing Liberty,"" it would be interesting to see which one you like best because both films have pretty good chemistry between the boy and the girl but suffer from weak scripts and less than satisfactory endings.  In fact, the way both films jump to the (semi) ""happy"" ending is a rather odd coincidence, which is a strange complaint given they both have the same semi-shocking revelation.  I like Holmes' performance a bit more and the running gags with the secret service agents in this one, but the other film has better locations and more interesting supporting characters.  However, if these films did not have Katie Holmes and Mandy Moore as their starts I shudder to think that they would have each lost another star and have descended to the level of not worth watching.",1106784000,23,5859,4.631884057971014

It was better than Chasing Liberty, and Katie Holmes continues to have a sort of ""girl next door"" quality that makes up for her lacking acting ability. Michael Keaton was good in it as always. It was also interesting to watch some of the things the president's kids have to go through that normally cross your mind. I don't think I could handle comedians making fun of my appearance during those awkward teenage years or my college class choices. You also have to feel for the guy playing the love interest. It must take a lot of nerve to ask a girl out with a 300+ gorilla guarding her at all times.

2183600,4,B0006GAODG,"Katie Holmes proves charming as daughter of the President of the United States in the romantic drama `First Daughter.' From director Forest Whitaker, `First Daughter' features Holmes' playing the character of Samantha Mackenzie - a freshman who navigates college classes, while dealing with testy roommates and romantic entanglements - all under the ever watching eyes of a cadre of Secret Service bodyguards.

Add Michael Keaton as a President running for reelection and Marc Blucas (from the television series `Buffy the Vampire Slayer') as a graduate student with a secret agenda to the mix and the ingredients are all here for an enjoyable, if not intellectually stimulating, diversion for a couple of hours.

Where this DVD fails, however, is its delivery on special features. We have a very short featurette on the choreographed ballroom dancing scenes, as well as a tribute piece to the famous composer Michael Kamen who died shortly after starting work on the picture.

There are also two deleted scenes that are actually merely extensions on existing scenes - more birth control products for Samantha as she endeavors to make her boyfriend jealous and more of Holmes dancing on the bar. They add nothing to the picture and its quite obvious why the extra seconds were trimmed from the final theatrical release.

Where the DVD does deliver the goods though is in the rather laid back commentary from the three young stars (Holmes, Blucas and Amerie). It starts a little slow, but soon livens up as the three began to relax. The three share some entertaining anecdotes about life on the set, and their experiences working with Michael Keaton. However, the commentary also highlights what is missing from the DVD as the three discuss all the outtakes from the picture, and Blucas even speculates (incorrectly as it turns out) as to their presence on the DVD.

As is the case with so many releases these days, we have the cropped full-screen version on one side of the disc and the original theatrical widescreen presentation on the flip side, with the special features split (half on each side).",1105660800,27,2101,5.008595988538682
2183601,3,B0006GAODG,"Katie Holmes plays the title character, as she enters college. It seems that no member of the First Family can really have any semblance to a ""normal life"", but this movie is supposedly a case of a First Daughter in college giving a serious shot at a fantasy of a ""normal life"". She starts off as a fairly sweet ""girl next door"" type, and it is that part of the role that Katie Holmes plays most successfully. Then in other episodes she nearly goes bonkers at having a constant presence of secret service agents all the time, and at another time waxes arbitrarily rebellious, going to a bar, getting apparently drunk, and performing a table dance, just to thumb her nose at the image expected of her as the President's daughter. The latter two episodes seem arbitrarily tacked together with the rest of her character, and make no believably smooth whole. Although we can well imagine that a lot of angst would come with the territory of being constantly in the spotlight and surrounded by secret service agents, the movie has very little impact in bringing home any aspect of that angst beyond what we would already suspect. Yet the movie does venture into that territory like it had something significant to say there. But ultimately it is like the film is torn between focusing on that angst and turning into a fairy-tale-like romance. The latter wins out in the end, with the movie getting a bit of an overlong and ponderous feeling in the process of getting there. The title character meets an apparent straightforward boyfriend with no apparent hidden surprises or strings attached (As you're probably guessing, things WON'T turn out to be exactly what they seem). She soon tells him that he might as well not try to keep any secrets from her, because one call to an FBI or CIA agent could get her any information on him that she might want. Seems that reminding him of such a thing would have been a case of ""better to not go there"" when fulfilling romance is being pursued. Seems to be a line that would have much more efficacy when the intention were to run somebody off. But she tells him that, for better or worse, and the rest of the movie is largely about how things play out. As mentioned, Katie Holmes does give it a good shot at playing the title character, given the script she has to work with. And the same can be said of Michael Keaton in the unlikely role of her father. Before I saw this, what if I'd been given a list of all who have played fictitious U.S. Presidents, and I'd seen Michael Keaton on the list? I would scarcely jump to any conclusion of expecting him to be like the dignified and heroic Presidents, such as those played by Harrison Ford in AIR FORCE ONE or Morgan Freeman in DEEP IMPACT. I would have visualized him as likely much nearer the opposite end of a spectrum of cinematic Presidents, more like the biting satirical portrayal by Billy Bob Thornton in LOVE ACTUALLY, or a farcical version like Jack Nicholson in MARS ATTACKS. So I suspected to find Keaton rather miscast or at least oddly cast if his was a serious portrayal of a heroic president. But he does play it straight and likeable, with more successful results than I expected. Still, I don't think his performance will go down as one of the most memorable serious performances as U.S. Presidents. Nor will this movie go down as any groundbreaking classic. But with the right laid back expectations, you can enjoy this as a sometimes sweet and heartwarming little tale, for all the incongruities and sometimes improbabilities.",1100995200,7,3531,4.624203821656051
