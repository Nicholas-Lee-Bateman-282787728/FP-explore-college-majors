8039556,4,B000679NH8,GREAT DATE MOVIE  BUT REALLY MORE OF A TURN ON THAN A PLOT,1461715200,,58,3.4615384615384617
8039557,3,B000679NH8,It was ok. The sex scenes were very soft-pornish from the early 80s....more like what you see on TV today than what you would expect from a DVD.,1358812800,,144,4.178571428571429
8039558,1,B000679NH8,"I ordered this video, as I thought it would be like the previous Karma Sutra's I have in my collection ~ which are outstanding, very sexy and good story lines.  This Secrets of the Karma Sutra 2 sucks.  I don't know how they could even use the same name.  Horrible movie.",1324252800,2,271,4.2745098039215685
8039559,5,B000679NH8,"This DVD contains three more episodes from the late night cable TV series. If you liked the three episodes from the first volume, then you'll like these as well. The stories are still not very interesting, but then not much time is wasted on them. This show knows what the viewer wants to see and gets right to it.

There are thirteen sex scenes. All are boy/girl, so I guess this would be good for couples. Most of the scenes were great. A few of them were a little short, but when the time between the long sex scenes is filled with short sex scenes, that's not something to really complain about. There are lots of beautiful women, some familiar (Tamara Landry, Gabriella Hall, Taimie Hannum) others new (Chloe Nicole, Tawny Garrison, Shyra Deland).

The DVD is authored better than the first volume, they included credits for all the episodes. I'd still like to see more chapter stops. But that won't stop me from buying future volumes.

This is very recommended.",1105920000,22,967,4.643274853801169
