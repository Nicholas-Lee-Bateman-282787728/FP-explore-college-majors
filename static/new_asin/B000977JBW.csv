2268534,3,B000977JBW,"Gene Wilder's narration adds an appropriate sense of Willy Wonka-esque wonder to this solid overview of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. At almost two hours, though, the DVD drags a bit - cheesy reenactments, for one thing, might have been happily omitted. While this documentary provides a lot of interesting information about how the Exposition came to be, and what it contained, it falls short in adequately placing the Exposition in a broader context. The most glaring and unfortunate oversight is the failure to include any discussion of the Fair's exclusion of African-Americans, and the resulting controversy.",1136246400,18,614,5.34020618556701
2268535,4,B000977JBW,"If you have only read ""The Devil in the White City"" by Erik Larson and want to see and know more about the fair you will be happy with this documentary. If you have read many books about the fair and taken advantage of all the resources at the Paul V. Galvin Library Digital History Collection online you may find yourself wanting more.

The focus of this documentary was mostly a tour of the fair. In recent books on the fair there seems to be either a ""horray for progress/wasn't the fair pretty?"" or a ""damn American imperialism, racism, and sexism"" route. The tone of this documentary was neutral/celebratory as it largely omitted discussion of racism and sexism (with only a few passing mentions). There were photos I hadn't seen before, and the narration (Gene Wilder) was superlative.

I do have quibbles with the film, which are most likey not the fault of the creators. See, what I really want is a bigger-budget version of this, full of computer reproductions of the fair so that we can ""walk through"" it instead of just scenes of a camera panning over a still photograph or painting. The live reinactments were limited to a belly dancer, beer drinking, and the murder of Mayor Harrison. There was also some live footage of fish and animals that the fair goers would have seen, which I am ambivalent about. But don't just tell me that the great pyramid would fit inside the Palace of Manufactures and Liberal Arts, drive the idea home with a little graphic, even a simple one, of the pyramid sitting inside it.

All that said, this was worth every penny and contained a lot of great material which I am bound to watch over and over again.",1127001600,82,1648,4.579661016949153
2268536,5,B000977JBW,"The Columbian Exposition was vast in every way - from the sheer size of its physical location to the number of its visitors to the diversity of its exhibits - yet this film covers it all using a historically responsible and entertaining approach. ""EXPO"" treats its viewers to a detailed ""behind-the-scenes"" look into the Exposition with Gene Wilder as a guide. The tour is chock-full of fascinating tidbits, and the period photographs add a whole other dimension that is often absent from texts on the subject. The film truly drops the viewer smack in the middle of the Fair. The quality of the high-definition transfer is stunning, and the picture looks as clear and crisp as a high-definition broadcast. The sound is enveloping and adds depth to the documentary; you actually feel as if you're surrounded by the Fair's bustling crowds. The film is without a doubt satisfying for everyone from the amateur history buff to the well-read historian.",1126828800,31,947,4.962264150943396
2268537,5,B000977JBW,"very well done documentary, full of wonderful details and pictures I have never seen. Gene Wilder was an excellent narrator ( especially for someone I would not have initially thought to narrate something like this.)  I truly enjoyed it. I was surprised there was no mention of Henry H. Holmes, but as that was not necessarily pertinent to the fair and the White City itself, I can see why they don't mention it.",1505779200,,412,4.6438356164383565
2268538,4,B000977JBW,Great to mhere Gene;s voiceover.  A nice documentary. And I'm glad they spent no mention on HH Holmes.,1505692800,,102,4.666666666666667
2268539,4,B000977JBW,"I love the idea of this documentary much. I love festivals, and I feel like we as a society don't try to connect with cultures often enough. The theme of this world fair is why we need more events like this in our lives.",1505692800,,220,4.0227272727272725
2268540,4,B000977JBW,It was great and full of interesting information about the fair. I didn't think I was actually going to like it! I loved looking at all the pictures. Very delightful. Gene Wilder did a fantastic job of narrating. It would of been a little more interesting with more it depth details. But I still enjoyed it very much!! And I thought it was going to be boreing!,1505692800,,360,4.388059701492537

2268542,5,B000977JBW,"This documentary covers the breadth of the 1893 World's Fair so thoroughly, it is as overwhelming as the fair itself! I had *no idea* of how *enormous* the scope of this fair was! Mind-blowing even today.

Fascinating, to try and imagine what it must have been like for so many Victorians to see electric light for the first time, let alone at such a magical scale; To marvel at the revolutionary machinery of the Industrial Age; To takes rides in these novel electric-powered boats and trains and even a 22-story-high Ferris wheel. Impossible, to comprehend the volume of fine quality wares for sale such as porcelain, textiles, paintings, jewelry, clothing, and more and more and more -from dozens of countries- that were displayed in a single pavilion probably close to the size of a modern-day shopping mall. It was the largest building in the world at the time, and just one of the exhibits on a fair ground which would reportedly require a person to walk over 100 miles to see everything. I think it would take an attendee a month to take it all in. My mind started to swim near the end of this 2-hour presentation.

The highly educational script, narrated by Gene Wilder, is comprehensive and efficient in content, and covers the entire timeline of the fair from conception to destruction. As some other reviewers have commented, the modern-day video clips used in the introduction and occasionally inserted as supplemental visuals are *painfully amateur*, and incongruent with the production quality of the rest of the film, which is 95% photos and materials from the day.  I have never seen so many photos of the fair, and never knew it had been visually captured so extensively.

I found myself thinking, ""I want to go!!"", and then being amazed that I found something from over 100 years ago as exciting as anything from today. More exciting, in fact; Something like this 1893 Chicago fair could not be done again today. The scope is impossible. Disney's Epcot is a 2-bit lemonade stand compared to this Expo... a gnat compared to a jumbo jet. It truly is a Wonder-of-the-World event.
If you're one to enjoy random educational programming as I do, this is a must-see.",1504915200,,2177,4.81283422459893

2268544,5,B000977JBW,"I'm glad this documentary is so lengthy as it is necessary to portray how awestruck the visitors must have felt.  I cannot believe the scale of this World Fair, in physical dimensions, international participation, or product demonstration.

No doubt many of the images used in the production are part of the library of congress available to the public so I must now seek them out to take in the spectacle (silver, fine art, sculpture, jewelry, et al) in more detail.  I also have many unanswered questions like where did all the fair visitors stay overnight?  My heart aches observing the past greatness of our nation and the worlds ability to interact and trade in peace to the benefit of all.",1496275200,2,682,4.658333333333333

I do wish they had talked more about Nikola Tesla, since he created the a/c electricity that Westinghouse used to light up the fair. Overall, I highly recommend this documentary.",1486598400,,354,4.619047619047619

2268559,4,B000977JBW,"We just watched this documentary. WOW!! It told a lot about what all happened and gave some little tidbits, like where the monikers of 'windy city' (referring to the pitched battle in Congress for the expo to be held in New York City or Chicago, the New York papers started to refer to Chicago as the Windy City for all the bombast they were doing in Congress)  and 'the monsters of the midway' (Soldiers Field is situated near to the site of the expo, and the Midway was outside the fair, but the exhibitors from around the world presented their wares along it) came from.",1474070400,,573,4.457142857142857

Something like this probably wouldn't be feasible today.  People really put artistic craftsmanship into what they created back then. No cheaply made imports then.

Even the narrator (actor Gene Wilder) of this documentary flat out says ""there is no place built on earth ever before, or built after, or possibly ever in the future, that can compare to the White City"" (paraphrased).  The scale, magnitude, beauty, and artistically phenomenal buildings, reflecting pools, and waterways that were built for the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, are unparalleled throughout history.  So why isn't this phenomenal place still on the banks of Lake Michigan, only 7 miles from downtown Chigago?  You'll have to watch it, to see what happened to it.

It is a visually stunning and well done window into a time and place in US history that is fascinating in  itself.

The use of the drawings and postcards kept my attention as well as the photographs.  I was surprised how clear they were.  One thing that I think I figured out is where Walt Disney came up with the layout for the nation's part of Epcot!  I would recommend this documentary to all ages.

It is a novel that uses the real story of the building of the infrastructure and then the fair itself as background for a crime.  It described the fair so vividly that I went on-line to see if I could learn more.  It lead me to this excellent DVD.

Where and how it was built, who was there, etc.  Although they mostly emphasized the positive and predictive elements of the fair, hey did give some time to the darker side including the corruption and safety issues.  My only real disappointment was that although they mentioned Edison and his electrical demonstrations, they really didn't highlight Westinghouse who had won the electrical contract for the fair.  Nor did they mention Tesla who had a demonstration at the fair with Westinghouse showing things like metal eggs hovering in a magnetic fields to demonstrate how motors spin and gas discharge lamps which were the forerunners to today's fluorescent lights.

Yes, I could almost imagine being there from time to time and I was impressed at how big and detailed the fair was. They used the latest technology and that at times was very risky. More than 600acres was built on former swampland that would not support any real buildings and that land all had to be reclaimed. They used electricity and electric lighting on a scale that had never existed before. They did not sugarcoat the fair or the many problems that they faced. It was a rough and tumble situation in a rough and tumble place and time. The fair had to be done on a profit basis...and it was. There were fights as to what was to be allowed or not and almost everything was eventually allowed. There were so many displays that a person could not possibly have seen it all...Chicago has never been a perfect place and they did not have a perfect fair....but it certainly was an interesting one. One of the telling displays was done by Germany and Krupp steel. They chose to show huge cannons and much war armament. It was very impressive and some realized that they were the world threat that they proved to be. There is much to this DVD and I found it all very interesting. Want to see some real history?

It's about one of the half forgotten wonders of the world, with a lot of amazing facts and interesting original footage that bring alive the world and times of 1893. And of course I truly admired the wonderful White City which I did not expect to have been so beautiful.

I disliked the reenactment. Why wasting time on acting, when there is a lot of original material that could be used?

2268702,5,B000977JBW,"This historical documentary tells the story of Chicago's 1893 World's Fair, originally intended to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Columbus discovering the Americas. The DVD also provides details of many exhibits, including those by George Westinghouse (eg. a switchboard, step-up and step-down transformers, and operational railway motor), Nikola Tesla (eg. a two-phase induction motor, generators, shooting lightning from his fingers), and Thomas Edison, as well as the outside the fair side-shows, belly-dancing, Ferris wheel, the first commercial movie theater, and Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. (Excluding the latter from the Fair was a serious financial mistake.)

The fair covered over 600 acres, and featured nearly 200 new, though temporary, buildings of neoclassical architecture, canals and lagoons, and exhibits from around the world (46 nations). Over 27 million attended during its six-month run. The buildings were clad in white stucco and illuminated with extensive use of street lights; they were part of the inspiration for Katharine Bates' 'America the Beautiful.' The Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building was then the world's largest; today it would rank #2 in volume and 3rd in footprint.

Only two of the original fair structures are still standing - the Palace of Fine Arts and the World's Congress Auxiliary Building.

The original Ferris Wheel (264 feet high, 36 cars - each capable of holding 60 people) proved to be a major attendance draw and helped put the fair into the black. Westinghouse won the bid to power the electrical needs of the fair, using AC current - proving the safety and reliability of that method and helping gain acceptance over Edison's direct current. In retaliation, General Electric banned the use of its Edison lights at the fair; Westinghouse responded with its own version that both reduced the cost and increased the life of their lights.

Overall, the number of buildings and the exhibits within those buildings was incredible; one would have to make numerous repeated trips to fully benefit.",1365897600,2,2057,5.37888198757764

The fair showcased many first that are still with us today such as the Midway, electricity and Cracker Jack to name just a few.  Building the fair was a super human feat in the short amount of time given.  It was truly a one of a kind event in both its construction, attendance and the sheer number and magnitude of the exhibits.  One I suspect shall never be repeated. I recommend reading Devil in the White City first as it provides much more detail about the people who designed and built it.  Book is two simultaneous stories:  One about HH Holms, Americas first mass murderer and the construction of the fair.  An extremely good read.  The DVD really comes to life if you read the book first.",1356652800,3,773,4.503597122302159
2268717,4,B000977JBW,"This documentary is an inside look at the Chicago World's Fair of 1893.  Everything is covered in enough detail:  the back door dealings in selecting Chicago, the actual presentations and buildings, and that this beautiful City was never meant to last.  (I would have liked to have seen more about certain displays.  But as so much was shown at the fair, each building is only given 5 - 10 minutes.)

Almost the entire documentary is Gene Wilder narrating over old pictures and paintings of the fair.  I was surprised about how few pictures there were of certain buildings until the documentary explained near the end why this was.  The documentary does use a map to show where events where held but this really does not the viewer any perspective of the size or scale.  Though I have heard better narration, Gene Wilder isn't too bad with enough change in his voice to keep the viewer interested.

My only complaint is in order to compensate for the lack of pictures, the producers added some very cheap looking video of the same belly dancer and animals.  I found this to be very annoying - especially as they would occasionally show these videos when Gene Wilder was actually talking about something unrelated.

Overall this is a great documentary and I was left feeling that we all missed seeing an event that will probably never happen again.  It is amazing that so many countries came together to compete in presenting the best pavilions - especially as the world would soon be consumed by two world wars.",1356566400,,1511,4.7251908396946565

2268721,5,B000977JBW,"Along with others, I found this very interesting.  It told me much about the Expo that I didn't know.  I appreciated the fact that almost everything you saw was old photos or engravings.  There were very short modern dramatizations (something that I am not a fan of), but they were barely there.  Lots of information and facts and I liked Gene Wilder as the narrator. The only thing I could think of that would have made it better were some interviews with people who were actually involved or who went to it.  But, of course it was too long ago for that.  I would definitely recommend it if you are interested in the subject.

BTW: There is a PG-13 warning at the beginning, but I have no idea what it would pertain to.  I would feel comfortable showing this documentary to anyone one who wanted to see it.

This fair had exhibits that would attract people today. A Ferris Wheel that could carry 2,000 people at one go, camel rides given by Bedouin tribesmen, exotic foods, electric boat rides, (think about that--in 1893!) A balloon ride (that crashed), belly dancing, the first light show set to music, weird farm exhibits, and an impressive display of German military might courtesy of Krupp Arms Works. There was even an unintentional mini re-enactment of the Chicago Fire. This fair spared no expense and still turned a profit.",1345420800,,703,4.966101694915254

So many amazing things

The first Ferris Wheel. It held 2000 people at once!
The introduction of Chili Con Carne
The introduction of Aunt Jemima
One of the largest buildings ever created. It's still in the top 6 today

and many many others. 26 million people visited at a time when the population of the USA was only 60 million.

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is there are several really cheesy videos of modern actors. They're short and easy to ignore but they're super cheese and don't add anything to this amazing topic.",1343692800,,683,4.44

2268726,4,B000977JBW,"After I read ""The Devil in the White City""  I gained a renewed interest in the Columbian Exhibiton of 1893.  I grew up near Chicago and was aware that members of my family had attended the fair. I was fascinated by the history of the development of the fair and its significance in the life of the country.  I also realized that I had in my possession several souveniers of the fair passed down through the family.

The DVD ""Magic of the White City"" further brought alive the flavor of the fair, well narrated by Gene Wilder.

I bought a copy for each of my three sons from Amazon.com and passed them along with some of the souveniers I found in our collections.",1275696000,,662,4.349593495934959

In fact, so many statistics, comments, and images are shared that it bears numerous watchings to digest the enormity of the fair production. Gene Wilder did a very good job of description - at an almost non-stop rate in order to include as much as possible. If you remember that the ""closing of the western frontier"" had just been announced by a U.S. Census Bureau representative and that many towns and settlements west of the Mississippi didn't even have electricity at the time, the staging of this event was an incredible example of the American spirit for trying on things new and shiny. It's worth a look just for the graphic images of the park layout.",1270512000,2,736,4.713178294573644
2268728,4,B000977JBW,"Like so many other viewers, I came round to viewing EXPO - The Magic of the White City (""EXPO"") because I read The Devil in the White City  (The White City) first.  Sort of.  Actually, my wife read The White City years after I did and, her curiosity piqued, rented the DVD.

EXPO is about the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, an exposition of such majesty, scope, corruption, and expense that it is a feat unparalleled in America today.  The closest we have to the Fair is Disney World, a lineage most explicitly drawn in The White City; Walt Disney's father, Elias, was a construction worker on some of the buildings at the fair.

EXPO is narrated by Gene Wilder.  I'm admit to a bias - I'm a big fan of Young Frankenstein and he's the only ""celebrity sighting"" I've ever encountered in real life. Wilder's getting on in age (the DVD was produced in 2005), so there's now a bit of a whistle to his speech. Still, his lilting voice has enough emotion and wry humor to make his narration enjoyable.  And there is a lot of narration.

We tend to think of previous American centuries as quaintly backward, where such modern notions as political correctness and global unity didn't exist.  And while EXPO is careful to point out that American culture still had its own foibles and intolerance endemic to the time, the World's Fair put all those to shame.  It was a global unification of wealth, prosperity, and cultural exchange in a way that's inconceivable in today's contentious world. We can learn a lot from the Chicago World's Fair.

EXPO uses old maps and photographs to detail events at the fair whenever possible, with few computer graphics or animation.  There are occasional shots of live actors, none whom particularly add anything of value to the narrative.  In fact, it's clear that the producers felt that the medium was a little dry, because there are copious live action shots of a belly dancer interspersed with discussion of the Midway.

Minor quibbles aside, EXPO works overtime to try to encompass the grandeur of such a huge undertaking without losing sight of the details. As a result, it necessarily glosses over some pieces (rampant corruption, the aforementioned Devil himself who is the subject of The White City book) and emphasizes others (global diversity, architecture, and the first appearances of American staples). That's okay though; EXPO is a huge undertaking with such a sweepingly broad subject that it's better served as a companion piece to a book.  Like The Devil in the White City.",1257379200,9,2513,4.782407407407407
2268729,5,B000977JBW,"I cannot believe that anyone who is interested in this period of history ( as I am) would not love this video.  First of all it covers virtually everything about the Fair, from beginning to end.  Second, Gene Wilder does a great job of narration. Third, being recorded in HD makes it visually beautiful.  Finally, how many such programs like this get made these days anyway? For the producers to take on a project like this shows they have great fondness for the subject. Minor complaints like too much belly dancing is irrelevant to the overall excellence of the program.  You simply get lost in the whole visual experience of what the Fair must have been like to tourists of 1893.  It was a wonderland.  I've always wished I could have lived back then and this program just confirms it.",1250208000,6,788,4.5928571428571425

I found it very detailed in terms of explaining the various exhibits and structures, this part of the video I'd give 5 stars to.  The rest however, left me hoping the video would come to an end.  Gene Wilder, while a fun actor is not the best narrator, he would put a class of teenagers to sleep.  The film is very static in that it only uses old photos and artist portrayals with panning in and out of them to tell this story.  Then there is the cheesy belly dancer that is put in the video and is about the only thing that moves.  This documentary would have been better interviewing Chicago historical society folks, some professors and maybe bringing in the present day site before the end.  I was dissappointed in the way this story was presented.  Great info for informations sake, but not very good in terms of being watchable.",1245196800,18,963,4.401129943502825

2268732,3,B000977JBW,"As a long-time fan of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, I was eagerly looking forward to seeing this film.  In spite of a well-researched script, an abundance of historical photos and visuals of the Fair, and Gene Wilder's excellent narration, I was disappointed by it.  Other reviewers have mentioned the ""cheesy"" and distracting modern-day footage of the dancing girl, zoo animals, fish in an aquarium, beer being poured into a glass, etc.  I'd like to add some poor choices in the music heard on the soundtrack.  Rather than limiting themselves to music that was actually played at the Fair or at least that was in existence in 1893, the producers chose to include music from a much later period.  Two examples are ""Dill Pickles Rag"" from 1906, and ""Swanee"" from 1919.  On the other hand, they failed to include the one piece of music that is closely associated with the Chicago World's Fair Midway, the famous ""hootchy-cootchy"" dance (aka ""Dance of the Snake Charmer""), the music for which appears in both Stanley Applebaum's ""The Chicago World's Fair of 1893,"" and Erik Larson's ""The Devil in the White City.""

2268743,5,B000977JBW,"It's difficult for me to pinpoint exactly what I like about this documentary. Mostly, I'd say it was the mood, the way it took me back to a time I did not know, but now have a sense of what it might have been like.

I first watched/ listened to this while packing boxes for a move. I really only intended it to be background noise while I worked, but instead I found myself coming back to it, slowing my packing progress.

I now own the DVD so I can watch it at my leisure. I have since spent the time researching many of the interesting things mentioned. It must have been an amazing sight. Even for us jaded folks of the 21st century.
Oddly enough, when the DVD ends, I feel just a little bit how folks might have felt when the Fair ended: a sense of loss; a sadness that it had to end.

Please note: My review is a based upon the needed escapism I experienced while watching. I didn't feel the need to be critical with this documentary.",1216512000,4,939,4.148351648351649

2268746,5,B000977JBW,"I received this DVD as a gift last year and have since recommended it to every Chicagoan I know.

Despite having lived in Chicago some years ago, my knowledge of the World's Fair of 1893 was quite limited.  I had seen the occassional photo of ""Big Mary"" and Court of Honor, but was not familiar with the scale and history of the Exposition.

I was advised that my whole family would enjoy this DVD, but my 8- and 11-year olds weren't interested.  That is, they weren't until they walked into the room where the documentary was playing.  Perhaps it's something about Gene Wilder's voice, or perhaps it's those incredible images, or simply the mystery and romance of a time when electric lights were a magical new phenomenon; but once engaged, they were completely transfixed.

I can't recommend this DVD enough.  We all loved it, and it inspired each of us to seek out age-appropriate books related to the 1893 fair (I'm now reading ""Devil in the White City"" and the kids are reading ""Fair Weather"").",1189468800,8,999,4.674285714285714

He was a brick layer in Berlin. Chicago was where the jobs were. I know he was in Chicago when the Columbian Expo was going on. There was very little written about family backgrounds.

My wife's maiden name is Ferris. For generations her family believed they were related to George Washington Ferris, inventor of the Ferris wheel, which was first exhibited at the Chicago Columbian Expo.

Further investigations revealed that the family myths were just that, myths. The DVD gave us a lot of information on the inventions of the day, why the Expo was so popular. As a youth, growing up in Chicago, one of my favorite places was the Museum of Science and Industry. The only building still standing, from the fair. I think that museum may have had a lot of influence on my career. I'm an engineer. Great DVD.

2268751,3,B000977JBW,"After seeing a glowing review about the historical accuracy of this DVD on a local Public Television station, I was disappointed at the way the section on the Midway Plaisance was treated.  While it is true that the Plaisance was meant to be commercially appealing to the masses, it is not true that the entertainers were low class types dragged over here to perform.  Many were well-trained and famous in their own countries.  In the Turkish Theater alone, fair goers were able to see a well-known performance troupe from the Ottoman Empire which had also toured in Europe.  As for the so-called ""Little Egypt,"" anyone who has done any kind of research from primary sources about the Plaisance would have learned that there was no such woman at the fair.  In fact, the only dancer advertised on the Plaisance was one Mlle Rosa, a performer in the Turkish Odeon Theater. The live modern dancer supposedly imitating the non-existent Little Egypt was dressed in a costume in which no Plaisance Ottoman  dancer would have been allowed because the contracts for these performers specified that they dress in a respectable manner. In addition, many photos of subjects from the ""Street Scene in Constantinople"" were mixed in with ""Cairo Street"" photos.

As one who quickly succumbs to museum fatigue, I understood references to visitors being overwhelmed by the scope of several exhibits. Indeed, video producers faced the challenge of making nearly two hours of facts and (mostly) still photography anything other than deadly dull. Using a few bits of modern film and much compelling dialog artfully presented by Gene Wilder, they succeeded. Despite fear of being bored to tears, my grim expectations were soon put to rest. Despite its focus on the fair grounds, buildings and exhibits, this documentary is enlivened by, for example, glimpses into municipal, national and global politics. It is likewise enlivened by its tying some of the exhibits into wars that soon followed. It was therefore thought provoking and as well as entertaining.

One of the more interesting, and fortuitously timely, tidbits is that the fair was constructed on what had been a swamp. Reconfigured by Frederick Law Olmsted, famous for designing New York City's Central Park, the area has since become Jackson Park. The western area is now destined to become the home of the Obama Presidential Center and is likely to spark renewed interest in its origins.",1506988800,,1417,5.2105263157894735
