8290318,2,B001CXEDW0,"This is a very...special movie. It's bizarre but not necessarily in a good way. The premise is interesting: a man and a woman, neighbours who have never come in contact before, are stuck in an elevator. They stay there for what seems like days, weeks, months with their food supplies magically renewing itself. Over the course of their ordeal they reveal themselves in ways that become more and more disturbing until strange supernatural things start to happen that makes you wake up if you were starting to fall asleep.

In spite of the black and white format and the lack of action (you have to be a bit patient if you can't follow words being exchanged because that's what the movie is made of), the dialogue holds its own, up to a point, that is to say it's amusing for someone who has nothing to do on a Saturday night, has smoked something or is really, for some reason, into that kind of student/bizarro/wannabe-Lynchian of a movie. I like bizarre enough but this was a bit too simple and pointless for me, sorta undeveloped.

Watch it with someone or a few people and laugh. It's a bit like renting a B-movie from the 50s. Its qualities are that it is original and the dialogue is better than most Hollywood movies because the whole product stands on this verbal exchange.",1232841600,2,1280,4.585152838427947
8290319,5,B001CXEDW0,"While certainly low budget and not for the faint of heart, ""Elevator Movie"" certainly possesses its own unique lan vital for the thinking person.  One cannot help but admire the raw existentialist nerve that runs through the pithy, often-very-funny dialog.  As the film progresses and the circumstances become more bizarre and the characters increasingly unlikable, an ever-increasing something is there, both addictive and eerily familiar--namely, we are reminded of ourselves and of our own interpersonal relationships!  Do not miss out on this Sartre meets ""The Twilight Zone"" experience.  Highly recommended.",1225670400,4,612,5.766666666666667
8290320,5,B001CXEDW0,"The first 10 minutes were slow, and a bit sloppy -- but there was something about ""Elevator Movie"" that sucked me in from the beginning. I found myself asking why I couldn't turn the darn thing off.

And I'm glad I didn't -- this movie has one of the most shocking and unexpected twists I've seen EVER. Despite the awkwardness (a style that really grew on me as the movie got going), ""Elevator Movie"" is one of the most unique pieces of cinema I've seen in a long time... a movie I chuckled and marveled over for days.",1224201600,4,518,4.285714285714286
8290321,1,B001CXEDW0,"As a steadfast and perpetually humbled fan of Lynch, Buuel, and Cronenberg, I was drawn to this film by accolades comparing it to the works of those masters.  Though ELEVATOR MOVIE does have the germ of an idea, I am incensed by such comparisons.  David Lynch spent five years of his life making his first film, ERASERHEAD.  If this sophomoric home movie took five hours I would be surprised.

It's so easy to get into the art scene these days.  But develop the thought, get a budget, mount a production, and try to hone a work of art through sweat and tears if you are going to call yourself an artist.  Please don't try to sell us a sketch on a napkin as anything worthy of being seen by anyone outside of your high school film class.",1223164800,,736,4.335766423357664
