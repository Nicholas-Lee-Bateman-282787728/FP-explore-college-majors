2183227,5,B0006GAO0O,"The movie SATAN NEVER SLEEPS and the mass market paperback from Pocket Books, Cardinal edition #C429, were both released in 1962.  The movie opened in New York City on Febrary 22, 1962, in what would be Clifton Webb's final motion picture. It was also one of only two movies that Webb made without his trademark mustache.

Pearl Buck was one of the two writers of the script, she knew China well, eventually earning a Masters degree and working as a missonary in China during the years 1914-1933.  She was tutored in Chinese with English becoming her second language.  Her parents had been Presbyterian missonaires before her with Pearl living in several cities in China including Nanking, Shanghai, and a small rural village named Suzhon, which must have resembled the village of SATAN NEVER SLEEPS.  Buck, a Phi Beta Kappa, eventually went on to receive the Pulizer Prize in 1932 and the first American woman writer in 1938 to receive a Nobel Prize in literature.

She and her family were eyewitnesses to at least one shooting battle between Chang Kai-Sheks troops, Communist forces, and assorted warlords in 1927, a battle in which several westerners were killed. At one point, Buck and her family had to go into hiding due to the neumerous bullets that were flying around.  Conditions in China continued to be dangerous up to and even after the 1945 Communist uprising.

The movie, SATAN NEVER SLEEPS, carries several issues that Pearl Buck saw and lived through during her earlier life in China. Especially the issue of tug of war between Christianity and aetheism. She also would have lived among the peasants of that time no doubt sharing many episodes that the movie portrays.  Whether a viewer appreciates this movie or not it represents a story that has many elements of truth and would have been one not completely objective to Pearl Buck. Her script helps bring sobering reality to the events pictured on the movie screen.

I first saw the movie in 1962 shortly before shipping out to Japan where I was to serve on a military base between Tokyo and Yokohama.  I later found out from one of Pearl's books on Japan that she too had lived in that area of the Tokaido Road on one of her family's return trip from China.

The movie remains one of my favorites though I cannot exactly say why, for it is a movie with much travail and human suffering.  And to this day China is still a land of much travail.  But be that as it may, the movie is one I have watched many times. Maybe it is the dialogue between Holden and Webb, maybe it because in the end, though many innocents have died, the 'devil' returns to the church and represents all the good that must yet remain in China.  No doubt about it, it is a film that will leave most watchers with many thoughts and impressions.

2183228,4,B0006GAO0O,"I don't know how closely this film follows the then recently published novel of the same title by Pearl Buck, but the screen writer might well have been Senator Joe McCarthy. Basically, a morality play in which the Chinese communists are the bad guys and the Western Catholic priests and their Chinese converts are the good guys.  It also highlights the not uncommon problem of a woman falling in love with a priest and the intense conflict this can cause to both.
  I would like to offer my interpretation of the later part of the film, which is where many viewers have a problem. Many don't feel the rape of Siu-Lan was a necessary nor desirable part of the story and can't imagine that she would later willingly accept the rapist as her husband.
As I see it, the rape serves 3  purposes in the story. First, it is another indication that the communist army is out of control. Rapes are a common accompaniment of wars, major revolutions and civil wars. Usually, under these circumstances, they are not punished. Secondly, the resulting child serves as probably the deciding factor in the eventual acceptance of Siu-Lan and Father O'Banion(William Holden)of the rapist(Ho San) as Siu-Lan's husband. Ho San is thus rewarded for seeing the light and reconverting from Maoism to Catholicism. He is also being rewarded for saving the lives of Siu-Lan and Father O'Banion in their attempt to escape to Hong Kong. If he had not come along and interjected his own  plan for the escape, the others would have died along with Father Bovard in the bombing of his car.
  Thirdly, the rape  serves as another test of the Christian ideal of forgiveness of sins(turn the other cheek). Previously, Father O'Banion was forced to decide whether to strike back when Ho San repeatedly slapped him. At first, he did nothing, but finally punched Ho San. The message is that the practice of this ideal has limits. Apparently, over time and in view of subsequent events, the rape eventually was considered to be within these limits. Although this might seem implausible to many viewers, it wouldn't exactly be the first time in history it has happened.",1215561600,8,2130,4.800546448087432
2183229,5,B0006GAO0O,"When I came across the DVD release of this film I was surprised at how recently it was made. I saw the film a number of times many years ago (not always on television) and vaguely imagined it dated from the early Fifties. I was also surprised to find it was made by Leo McCarey, who is mostly known for his popular comedies starring the Marx Brothers or a cassock-clad Bing Crosby.

Because it is a story of Catholic missionaries, the plot appears superficially to be a tale of conflict between the earnest, civilized Christian West and the cruel, backwards, self-satisfied Asiatics who regard the Westerners as 'barbarians.' Cultural historians might also describe the film as part of the late-50s/early-60s propaganda campaign designed to encourage American military support of the (Catholic, Westernized) South Vietnamese. However, if the film were no more than all this it would have no relevance today, when Red China has changed its trappings but is mightier than ever. The moral void at the center of the Red Chinese soul is not something than can be described by trade statistics or industrial output or the type of consumer goods now available to office workers in Shanghai. It is a fundamentally a religious problem. The film is more than an allegory, and the Satan in the title is not a figure of speech.",1203465600,27,1315,4.844444444444444

2183241,3,B0006GAO0O,"I liked this movie mainly because of France Nuyen but it has its moments otherwise.  It has a few scenes intended as comedic that fell flat for me.
Some other parts depicting horrible treatment of women aren't done well at all.  William Holden does OK but I didn't like his treatment of Miss Nuyen.  His character didn't deserve her anyway!  LOL!",1419552000,,346,4.622950819672131

2183263,4,B0006GAO0O,"The story about the Communist take-over of Christian missions in China during 1949 is compelling when it maintains its serious tone, but fails miserably at times due to a misguided attempt at humor in France Nuyen's character's fliration with the William Holden celebrate priest character. Clifton Webb is magnificent as always and there are some surprising plot twists that will keep you hanging on til the final resolution. Great cast and the story has its moments, if you can manage to get past Nuyen's annoying mugging and smiling for the first three-quarters of the film. Not one of Holden's best efforts, but worth adding to your collection.",1414368000,,647,5.05607476635514

2183268,2,B0006GAO0O,I was disappointed  in this movie the story was just to unbelievable. William Holden and Clifton Webb were wasted I hope they got paid for working because they really must have needed the money to accept their rolls in this movie.,1391990400,,230,4.609756097560975

2183271,5,B0006GAO0O,"I intend to write a much more complete review on this soon because I have not seen it for some time...a mistake for me who loves good stories & to ever slip up and not watch Holden over and over, in all he does makes me lose much. He offers so much in all he ever does that one has to go back again and again.

Remember ""Breezy?"" That one (and Susie Wong also) I stopped counting the times I saw them. (DVD'S are the greatest  thing, to go back often to this great actor who just turns everything he does into pure gold.) He, much like Spencer Tracy, makes it all so absolutely convincing and simply they become whoever they play. Paul Newman's later films had that (and Robert Redford anytime (I think) had much of what Holden does.

I watched Breezy and Susie Wong last week both twice...by myself and then few days later a friend and like the great books we have read, we are drawn back over and over...the best compliment to an actor is how often you have to go back and see, hear him/her again. So accept this as a William Holden review...and the movie I must come back to....oh, regarding Holden in a number of his films, why is it that the studios never take the great ones (mentioned here alone for instance?)...
and show them at about 3,000 theatres again, like Breezy and Susie Wong, others as great as them too. There's a whole generation that has not tasted these great stories with all their literary and artistic senses. We need some stuff like this to see these days when almost nothing comes forth as the ones spoken of here.
Hollywood, you have so much gold sitting in cans out there...let the gold out on to the big screen again...make tons of money and let people be mesmerized and experience sheer joy as we all did.",1371081600,4,1736,4.351851851851852

2183283,4,B0006GAO0O,"What can you say about a William Holden movie? Thay're all great! He never made a bad movie. Holden always but always holds an audience (usually on the edge of your seat). In many of his films he becomes a martyr to his cause and we celebrate his heroism, his Americanism in the face of evil and the Grimm Reaper. This movie is no exception. But it is a different kind of film. A love story of epic proportions. Get to know the other Bill Holden. See the movie (also starring Clifton Webb).",1366416000,4,490,4.279569892473118
2183284,5,B0006GAO0O,This was really a fine movie and William Holden did a great job as he always did. It had a bit of everything in it from action to drama.

2183285,5,B0006GAO0O,"This is a film that shows the evil we are capable of descending into, especially when young and impressiom
nable minds are controlled by a corrupt system like communism. It also shows that the institutional chuch is not irrelevant, on the contrary, it is  a lifeline for those who have a love in their hearts that no evil system can ever destroy. The courage that people are called upon to show is truly amazing. The power of conversion is also very edifying to see as the story unfolds.",1356739200,2,487,4.534090909090909
2183286,2,B0006GAO0O,"Holden mailed in this performance. Just because he was capable of doing movies with Asian co-star doesnt mean the screenplay is automatically high caliber. And whoever imagined the part for the lovely France Nyuen must have had a stereotyped image of how Chinese ladies behave in such a situation. I agree this was done in the 1950's when Holden was still doing pictures with Jennifer Jones playing a half-cast Chinese doctor in Love Is A Many Splendored Thing, but Nyuen simply says nothing with an empty smile on her face the whole picture. The studio set backdrops no more look like the real China than does my hometown. All the other Chinese actors try valiantly to overcome the stiff direction with various degrees of success.",1354924800,,731,4.856

At the mission Obanion meets Father Bovard(Clifton Webb)who takes an instant dislike to Obanion. Bovard is retiring after being in China for 25 years.
Soon,the old priest is brought back by a red company. In command is Col Ho San(Weaver Lee)who had once been a devote Catholic,but is now a hard core communist.
