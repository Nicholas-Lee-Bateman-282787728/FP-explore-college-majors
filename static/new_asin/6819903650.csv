It Is Really Going To Mess With Your Emotions

You will find yourself crying to the point of dehydration with Koe no Katachi (A Silent Voice). Especially after the time jump because, as the trigger warning notes, things get bad enough that there are suicide attempts. Of which one in particular, if you are the type who don't know how to control yourself, may lead you to leap out of your chair and yelling at the screen. For that is how invested you will get in these characters. Even the ones which were introduced to us as Shokos bullies.

Of which who bring the real complications into play. On one hand, how long can someone be judged for their past actions? When Shoya bullied Shoko they were in middle school, so does that damn them for life? Yet, on the other, taking into account what Shoya did and how no one did more than be indifferent or encourage him, until the adults found out, are they deserving of forgiveness?

That is going to be something which will make it hard sometimes for you to deal with how loving, forgiving, and especially sensitive, Shoko is. For she is so quick to forgive and blame herself for any and all situations and we are watching her tormentors try, try being a very strong word for Naoka, to make amends. Which, considering how they humanize Shoya and flip the script on him, youll find yourself coming around despite some desire not to.

Tomohiro Nagatsuka & The Funny/ Awkward Moments

The first friend Shoya makes after being blackballed is Nagatsuka (Kensho Ono). Someone who comes off adorable at first, obsessive after a while, maybe even creepy, but then brings it right back around. If only because Nagatsuka is a ride or die friend and after Shoya makes sure his bike doesnt get stolen, he does anything and everything for that dude. Including fight with Yuzuru, before he knew she was a girl, much less younger than he perceived, so Shoya could talk to Shoko.

Alongside that, there are a lot of those awkward moments romantic animes use like a character being dumbfounded or saying or perceiving something which makes them look really dumb. Such as, being that Shoya is deaf, when she speaks it isn't necessarily the clearest. Leading to some moments where Shoya, after the 5-year jump, misunderstands her and it leads to a comical moment or two.

Criticism
The Romantic Plot Sort of Fades Out

By the end of the movie, it becomes clear that both Shoko and Naoka have feelings for Shoya. Shoko outright confesses to Shoya but, due to her verbally saying she loves him, he thinks she is talking about the moon due to not hearing her properly. As for Naoka, while she doesnt confess, it becomes clear in what she says, does, and how she treats Shoko after the time jump. For you get this vibe that she liked Shoya in middle school, but because of Shoko telling on his to the adults, she had to distance herself and it ruined the trajectory they would have been on. Then, with him hanging with Shoko and changing on her, it made it so the disconnect that began because of Shoko is getting deeper and harder to traverse.

Yet, despite there being a bit of a love triangle, Shoko just stops seeming to have a crush on Shoya and Naoka doesnt really make a move. Much less, Shoya never has a light bulb go off moment when it comes to either of them.

On The Fence
It Can Feel Long

This is over 2 hours long. On top of that, it is a two-hour long movie which spends a good portion having us watch Shoya torture Shoko. Then it has a time jump which pushes us to feel bad for Shoyo. Which tries to get us to like him, and smartly it uses that time well to turn that corner. However, in the time necessary time to take this little kid you want to see thrown in prison to someone you end up crying tears over, it is an arduous journey. One which, by the time you hit 90 minutes, you may feel like the movie is just stretching this story out. Especially after Shoya and Shoko seem good and you're waiting for them to kiss, maybe do the sign language for friends, or what have you.

For, I really do mean this, between the crying and laughter, this does get a little taxing on your emotions.

It Doesnt Touch On a Lot of The Deaf Communitys Issues

Consider me spoiled by Switched at Birth, but I have to admit, in retrospect, I kind of wish we got to see more of what Shoko went through as a deaf person. We are made to understand deaf people are bullied, that hearing aids are expensive, and that deaf people can have full lives. But A Silent Voice doesnt touch on any sense of Shoko being part of a community, common discrimination a deaf person may experience in Japan, and things of that nature. Not to imply that Shoko being deaf is treated as a gimmick for sympathy. laughter, or to stand out, but A Silent Voice also doesnt go too deep with what it means to be deaf or hard of hearing.

Overall: Positive (Worth Seeing)  Recommended

I firmly believe Koe no Katachi (A Silent Voice) is going to be this years Your Name (in terms of deserved notoriety | Fun Fact: This was released in Japan around the same time as Your Name). For one, it brings what I have rarely seen in anime which is a marginalized group  in this case, a deaf person, as its star. On top of that, it addresses the bullying that community faces in such a way that even live-action depictions rare go into. And following that, it somehow makes this despicable brat you think could only be understood if his parents were abusive, into someone you like. Not even just like, but laugh with and cry over.

Hence the positive label and this being recommended. For while it does give you the vibe it is overstaying its welcome and the Shoya love triangle just getting suddenly dropped, it once more shows that anime, as a means of storytelling, can easily rival anything done live action.",1513814400,,5808,4.446848541862653
1108948,5,6819903650,Loved it. There are parts that make more sense when you read the book but overall a great movie. I think it would have been even better if it was made into a series so they could go more into detail on certain relationships and issue,1513036800,2,233,4.086956521739131
1108949,5,6819903650,"While the manga definitely focuses a little bit more on the psychological concerns of our characters, this adaptation definitely does the work justice.

7899395,5,6819903650,"This movie is in the top ten of my favorite movies. I never would have thought a Anime movie could get so high on my list of movies as it is drawings, but this story is captivating. It is a problem that English caption does not align up with exact words all the time, but ""oh, well.""

This a must watch, but keep in mind the content is for adults only or parents should watch with their preteens and teens, due to content.",1521504000,,422,4.0843373493975905
7899396,4,6819903650,"I feel like I bought a pirated copy of the movie. The audio was really clippy, some of the subtitles were off, and there were weird visual artifacts in the corners of my screen when I watched this.",1520726400,2,197,4.2105263157894735

7899400,1,6819903650,"The movie is absolutely fantastic and one of the best movies I've seen period, easily in my top 3. However, there are no subtitles for what Shouko writes. This is extremely frustrating, as what she little she writes, the content is extremely important. Also, the subbers seemed to have gotten lazy with the text messages as well. I can't in good conscience recommend anyone to buy this movie from this distributor because they wouldn't be buying the full thing.  Shame that such a good movie can be overshadowed by the lazy translators who decided to put this it out.  By it from a different group or rent it. That is your best bet to watch this masterpiece.",1518307200,5,658,4.615384615384615
7899401,3,6819903650,"The animation, story, and English voice acting was very enjoyable. However, the only thing I noticed wasn't offered are English subtitles for written Japanese text in the movie without having the whole movie in English subtitles. That is to say, there are subtitles, but they also show what is being said as opposed to just showing what is shown written on screen (such as when Shoko shows her notebook for others to read).
Furthermore, the subtitles for what is being said is not the exact wording of the English dub, making watching the film with subtitles on somewhat distracting. This movie would be infinitely more enjoyable if there was an option for English subtitles for just the written portion shown as opposed to the entirety of the movie's script.
I had purchased this movie for a family member, and as I can read Japanese, I have no problem while watching the dub; but my family and friends had some difficulty just watching the dub as a significant portion of the movie's flow is through text displayed on screen, which remains Japanese. However, they still loved the movie and are keeping it.",1515974400,11,1107,4.801047120418848
