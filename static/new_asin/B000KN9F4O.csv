8158279,5,B000KN9F4O,"Kagome is a normal high school girl, until she falls down a well at her home on her 15th birthday. She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurable powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

After the events surrounding Abi unfold, Inuyasha's group discovers the connection she has with Naraku. Naraku is using the blood she collects to open the path to the netherworld. Inuyasha and the others can also use this path to cross the border. But is the huge amount of people sacrificed to make the path worth it?

There is enough action to keep you intersted, although it its is better to watch the video with the subtitles.  If your into action anime this one should catch you eye.",1191974400,,289,4.415094339622642
8158281,4,B000KN9F4O,"Inuyasha is a great TV series on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. The price is going to be the downfall of this product. Fans of this show will be better off financially to just watch the show on TV or buy the paper back books for the series. With only 3 episodes per disc, you really are left wondering why you made that impulse buy to see if Naraku finally gets destroyed. Extremely addicting and fun to watch but too pricey.",1178409600,2,424,4.3125
8158282,5,B000KN9F4O,"This DVD contains 3 episodes (152 - 154):

* Protect & Plunder!

* The Cruel Reunion of Fate

* The Demon Linked with the Netherworld

If you are already collecting the Inu Yasha series individually, I would recommed this one.  If you are new to the Inu Yasha world, you would probably be better off buying the box sets.",1174262400,3,320,4.3559322033898304
