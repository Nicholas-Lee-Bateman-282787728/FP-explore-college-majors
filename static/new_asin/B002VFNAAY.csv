I don't know if the promoters weren't able to get a lot of old ECW guys or if they just didn't want to pay the top tier ECW guys but when I watch an ECW reunion guys like ""The Musketeer"" are not who I want to see. The show wasn't a total loss but not something I would recommend for your DVD collection",1376438400,,369,3.7435897435897436
8382010,2,B002VFNAAY,"I have both Hardcore Homecomings (Shane Douglas Reunion Shows), the WWE reunion show (One Night stand 05), and the TNA one (Hardcore Justice). This one is by far the worst ECW reunion show, hardly any wrestling, bad/low card wrestlers like Crowbar, Scotty Riggs, the Mustkateer, Belvis Wesley etc..

Francine ""The Queen of Extreme"" put this together as a charity event, it's a nice idea. But the matches are all slow and very gimmicky, with stupid endings, dancing, and hardly any wrestling moves. I was pretty dissapointed with the Jerry Lynn/Al Snow match which sounded better on paper. The best match is Raven and Justin Credible vs Sandman and Sabu. And it wasn't even great, just decent. If you like ECW check out any of the other reunion shows, this one is just eh at best. More nostalgia and for show than anything else, save your money. Very disappointing.

Grade Rating: D",1294358400,2,881,4.827814569536423
8382011,3,B002VFNAAY,"For the 10th day of christmas I'm going to review...Legends of the Arena. The 2 Cold Scorpio-CW Anderson match was a pretty good opener to say the least. The Bilvis Wesley-Musketeer match was crud with nothing but talking and shenanigans. Not only that,it was too short. The Chris Hamrick-Devon ""Crowbar"" Storm match was pretty hardcore but too long for it's own good. The Rhino-Jaimie Dundee-Scooty Riggs-3 way match was also too short. The Balls Mahoney/Axl Rotten-Da Baldies match was a bloody,hardcore,smash-mouth brawl. The BWO-FBI match was dumb due to the shenanigans again and lack of wrestling. The Al Snow-Jerry Lynn match was great 20 min,back-and-forth,high-tech showstealer. The Sandman/Sabu-Raven/Justin Credible match while slow at points, it was still a fun,hardcore,entertaining,smash-mouth brawl. Overall:while not a great wrestling show,it was still fun to watch and everybody had a great time bring there. I give this show a 7 out of 10.",1293062400,,957,5.472972972972973
