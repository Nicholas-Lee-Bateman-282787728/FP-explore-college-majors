2840154,4,B000QTD6QA,"Carole Lombard was a talented star. She could play drama, comedy and
screwball at the drop of a hat. Her co=star Fred MacMurray gives her
a run for the money in this one. I recommend it to anyone who likes
jazz, comedy and drama rolled into one good film for the ages.",1201046400,5,268,4.173076923076923

2840158,3,B000QTD6QA,"This version of an often filmed story has as its main attraction the glorious Carole Lombard in her best form. Directed by gay director Mitchell Leisen it is quite stylish and very funny at times. It also stars Fred MacMurray, who was the Tom Hanks of his time. The DVD version is not great  -  rather grainy like an old video copy.",1404950400,2,332,4.338709677419355
2840159,1,B000QTD6QA,"The VHS is a copy of a copy of a copy... The audio is best described as noise. Every now and then you might make out a word or two. The visual is best described as a black dust cloud in front of the screen. Occasionally, you might see the actors. Avoid the Madacy VHS at all costs!",1387670400,,281,3.8620689655172415
2840160,5,B000QTD6QA,"This is not one of Carole Lombard's best movies, but it is a decent one. I enjoyed the story line and thought that the casting was very good. I am giving it 5 stars because I cannot give it 4.5 and I think it is better than a 4. You certainly have to take into consideration that it is a movie that is 80+ years old, so one cannot complain about the quality of the print. Considering its age, it's not bad. Carole's character was easy to warm up to, but then Carole Lombard was easy to warm up to. She had a sweet personality and it shines through in almost every movie she ever made.",1379203200,2,584,4.043103448275862
2840161,2,B000QTD6QA,"I have to admit that I could not get through this entire film. Another reviewer said that it was probably one of the least remembered films pairing Carole Lombard and Fred MacMurray. There's a reason for that. If you're looking for a happy-go-lucky musical of the 30's filled with memorable songs, which the movie title would imply, this isn't it.",1377734400,,347,4.8
2840162,5,B000QTD6QA,"First, Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard were quite smashing when they were paired together on screen. You don't want to miss any of the four films that they starred in together. ""Swing High, Swing Low"" (I can't say that I care for the title of the film -- it sort of misses the mark) is pretty much a formula romance; however, Lombard and MacMurray's chemistry together take a formula romance and make it smoldering. In the end, you sit back, sigh, and wonder if that kind of love really exists. Fairy tale or not, it's an enjoyable film to watch for those who love classic cinema. Watch for Anthony Quinn in the barroom brawl scene. If you love the silver screen, heady romance, and an dip into the 1930s -- you don't want to miss this one.",1365120000,6,742,4.423357664233577
2840163,3,B000QTD6QA,"Swing High, Swing Low, 1937 film

The film begins in the Panama Canal Zone, a military area. Shops pass through the locks. One of the girls is working to get to California. They tour Panama City. Harry takes quinine for his fever. At the bar a misunderstanding leads to a fight, and jail. The boat sails, and leaves Maggie behind. We see their living conditions. Running water in the kitchen. Skid Johnson bets his money on a fight and loses. Maggie King gets a job singing and dancing, and talking to customers. Harry gets an idea to compose a new song. Harvey comes to Panama to rescue Maggie. But Maggie and Skid marry. A promoter wants Skid to perform in New York. He agrees, and will send for Maggie.

Skid is a featured trumpeter in NY. But he keeps putting off sending tickets to Maggie. Finally Maggie sails to NY, but Skid isn't there to meet her. [Is he easily led astray?] Maggie will file for divorce. Will Skid try to change her mind? They talk of old times. Harvey Howell shows up and orders Skid out. [Are some musicians emotionally unstable?] Weeks later Harry finds Skid. Can Maggie convince Skid to pick up and return to his career? Or has drink damaged his talents? There will be a happy ending, but the film doesn't tell about their future.

This drama is based on a stage play. It tells about the life of people in the entertainment business. Maybe being an accountant is better in the long run?",1266883200,,1416,4.48062015503876
2840164,3,B000QTD6QA,"This film was one of the most popular films of the late 1930s and probably one of the least remembered films pairing Carole Lombard and Fred MacMurray.  It was a pretty prestigious production in its day; it was directed by the legendary Michell Leisen.  Maggie King (Lombard) meets a soldier Skid Johnson (MacMurray) during a cruise through the Panama Canal.  Maggie stays in Panama where her relationship with Skid turns from one of annoyance to love.  The two work together in a local nightclub, where Skid gains fame as a trumpet player.  A visiting talent scout gives Skid the opportunity to make it big in the States.  Encouraged by Maggie, Skid travels to America, leaving Maggie behind in Panama.  On his road to success, Skid is manipulated by his crafty vocalist Anita Alvarez (Dorothy Lamour in an early role), which in turn, ends up damaging his relationship with Maggie.  Skid's career and personal life take a downturn and he realizes that all he really wants is Maggie's love and the simple life they had together.  If you are a Lombard/MacMurray fan, this film is a must, but unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a decent DVD version around.  It deserves a restoration and some commentary.  Still, it's worthwhile to see the irresistible Lombard and a great cast of supporting players including Jean Dixon, Charles Butterworth, and a very young Anthony Quinn.  There's also a funny bit in the beginning of the film with Lombard, Dixon, and Esther Howard in a beauty salon aboard ship.  Howard was a popular character actress under contract at Paramount and pops up in just about every Preston Sturges movie.",1207180800,10,1625,4.886861313868613
2840165,2,B000QTD6QA,"Mitchell Leisen is one of the neglected and underrated directors of Hollywood's golden age.  This movie, however, is not one of his best.  The picture and sound quality are rather poor for starters.  Although MacMurray and Lombard have been in other Leisen movies, they don't generate many sparks here.  MacMurray plays the troubled brilliant trumpeter part as a kind of physically and morally lazy cipher.  There's not much about him for us to get excited about and therefore not much to make us believe that Lombard would go for him and rescue him from the skids.  I mainly got the DVD because I wanted something by Leisen, but the joke's on me because now (or very soon) two of his best - Midnight and Easy Living - are out on DVD.  Get those and No Man of Her Own (if you can find it)to see how adroitly Leisen mixed comedy, drama, romance, and the darker aspects of human nature.",1204156800,2,884,4.522012578616352

8197285,4,B000QTD6QA,"I'm afraid I didn't like this one as much as many of this era. It was well done and I'm thinking some of the effects were likely cutting edge back then but the story was rather dark and I can't get behind a drunken, selfish husband who supposedly cannot see another woman trying to get between him and his wife. Sad that the good ole days had as many problems as we do now.",1515888000,,373,4.054054054054054

8197289,3,B000QTD6QA,"This 1937 B/W film is a contemporary story about two Americans in Panama, he Skid (MacMurray) and she Maggie (Lombard). Skid is an unemployed free soul who courts Maggie with classic rapid-fire wisecracking that is Lombards strength. They wind up doing a gig in a local cafe, he playing the trumpet really well and she singing alongside him. Along comes an old flame Anita (Dorothy Lamour) a dancer in the show in the same cabaret our protagonists play in. She represents a challenge to Skids morality, but soon leaves to go to NYC to star in a show on Broadway. Skid quickly seals the deal with Maggie, and they are married.
An offer comes to Skid to star in a show in NY, guess what at the very same cabaret as Anita. The deal requires Maggie to stay in Panama because they don't need singers on Broadway. (Challenge to marital stability alert!) Skid leaves and is a financial success but is remiss in keeping contact with Maggie. When she tries to contact Skid with letters and calls, Anita intercepts them without Skids knowledge. Maggie suspects the worst and flies to NYC, having sent notice to Skid to meet her at the boat. No show. She finds out where Anita lives and calls Anitas apartment where Skid has crashed after a late night post-show. He answers the phone. Nough said. She notifies Skid she is going to Paris to get divorced from him thinking the worst, although (nave wink alert!) we were never privy nor was it suggested there was intimate stuff between Anita and Skid. Maggie has an old flame replacement in line. Skid is still loves Maggie and is crushed, loses his job, and (pun alert) hits the skids. At a last chance for him to get his plush nightclub job back, Maggie hears of his plight and still loves him, rushes to his side and rallies him, with some difficulty, to blast out the tunes like his old self to the satisfaction of the radio shows sponsor. (Hollywood ending alert!) Shes back with him, hopefully the dysfunctional dyad will remarry and live happily ever after. Fade to black.
The repartee between MacMurray and Lombard at the beginning of the movie is vintage and worth a look. Because the character Skid has been portrayed as an irresponsible jerk, there is little sympathy for the predicaments (that are predictable) he gets into. (No brainer alert!) The weakness of the story lies at the heart of him leaving Maggie in Panama, and not tending to the long distance obligation of marriage. Three star rating is generous.",1473033600,,2462,4.662068965517242
