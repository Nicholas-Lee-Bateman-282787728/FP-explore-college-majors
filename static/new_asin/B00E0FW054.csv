5882422,5,B00E0FW054,"I don't want to be a wet blanket here, but as of July 16th (and as far as I can find as of July 28th), FOX still hasn't issued an official statement about this set. Unless the disc specs are upped to 5 or 6, it's highly unlikely all 23 episodes plus a good helping of special features will be on 3 discs.
Simply looking back at the past sets shows that's simply not how FOX does it.

Since 2005 they've all had 3 discs & only one set was released with more than 14 episodes, Volume 8 w/ 15.
Since the revival, FOX hasn't been that interested in keeping the seasons together, so there's no logical reason to believe they would attempt to release a complete Season 10 by cramming all 23 episodes & special features onto three discs.
I'd love to have a complete Season 10  as much as the next fan so we're not waiting 2 years for Season 11, but I just don't see it happening.",1374969600,10,872,4.123529411764705
5882423,5,B00E0FW054,The release date has been set for September 24. This will surprisingly include all of season 10. Maybe Fox is turning it around.,1373932800,8,128,4.608695652173913

5882428,4,B00E0FW054,"""Brian Writes A Bestseller"" is one of my favorite episodes ever.  Fortunately, it's included in the approximate half of this season that includes DVD commentary.  I love this show, and I've never taken sides when it comes to Family Guy vs. The Simpsons.  But the Simpsons' DVDs include commentary on EVERY episode, and it's far and away more entertaining than the ridiculously lackluster Family Guy effort.  Whenever Seth is actually included in the commentary, they're usually pretty funny and/or interesting.  Otherwise, it's just a gang of awkward nerds waiting for the time to pass by.  On the contrary, The Simpsons' staff commentates every episode, and they're genuinely entertaining.  But none of this will stop me from being a lifelong fan of this show.  We good, Brian.  We good, we good!",1469923200,,797,5.069230769230769

5882476,5,B00E0FW054,"I'm sorry but how can people honestly say that Family Guy has gone downhill?..in what way has it gone downhill?..the program is amazing and never fails to make me laugh. If anything the program has gone uphill! It's funnier than ever. Volumes 1-3 for me were still hilarious but not as funny as it is today. This volume proves that family guy is one of the greatest shows in history and in my opinion, is as great as it ever was. Sometimes even in the show seth hints that he's running out of humor/gas within the show..well I disagree. I mean even that itself is kind of funny isn't it?

Don't listen to people who criticise Family guy saying the later episodes of family guy aren't as good because they are! I agree with them about the half-season DVD releases which used to be put out but not the episodes themselves, no chance. This volume has 23 episodes on it (the full 10th season) so no complaining. They've finally started to release full seasons.

Buy this DVD you'll love it! how anyone can find family guy unfunny or even say the show is taking a turn for the worst is beyond me",1416614400,7,1090,4.391089108910891

5882496,5,B00E0FW054,"Whereas the first 3 seasons are the bar to achieve and the show has stepped down in it's laugh factor, I do still want my Stewie and Brian and the rest fix that FG provides.  It has become a bit tired and repetitious over the once shocking over the top pop references, but once in a while they still get it right.  Can they still shock an audience when they've used most of the fodder of our youth already and still remain fresh and worth watching?  Some episodes aspire to still try whereas others are unfunny and actually sad.  I have bought EVERY release, even if it meant not very episode is good. Not yet has FG jumped the shark, but it's close to it.",1404604800,,656,4.224

The first few seasons were hilarious but these last few seasons have not been so good. For me it went south when they started swearing.

5882566,2,B00E0FW054,"VERY, VERY disappointed.  I have EVERY season of Family Guy on DVD.  I had not seen many of the episodes of this season on TV so I was excited to see many for the first time.

Disc 1 left me certain that FG had taken a DARK TURN.  The episode where Meg suddenly turns the tables on the family went way overboard to the point that it felt like watching a LIFETIME Network drama. Completely UNFUNNY.  Most of Disc 1 left a somewhat disgusted feeling after watching the episodes.  Take somebody who has never seen any episodes before, show them Disc set 10 versus 11 and they would immediately notice the dark turn.  Almost felt like McFarlane was giving a big finger to the fans.  The episode where Quagmire is found hanged and then his abused sister comes to stay again, was way more dark then funny.

 I watch some Family Guy on DVD almost every day but set 11 will not be in the line up. Ill keep it to keep my collection complete but it was a huge letdown.  I plan on watching them again with the commentary on to try to get some insight into this seemingly intentional change in direction",1380326400,3,1091,4.299019607843137

5882571,5,B00E0FW054,"Most of Season 10, of the hit, super funny, cartoon show, 'Family Guy', will be represented in this Volume 11 DVD.

Season 10, begins with 'Lottery Fever,' which is a great episode.

Tea-Peter is another great episode from Season 10, #21.

I also really liked the episode entitled, 'Amish Guy.'  'Burning Down the Buyit' is another awesome episode.  Some of these I bought and downloaded to Amazon's Unbox Video Player, so I could watch 'em over and over, before they get released, which is this September 24.

'Killer Queen' is another episode I really liked.  And also, 'Cool Hand Peter', and 'Screams of Silence: The Story of Brenda Q', Quagmire's sister.

All the way back to episode #2, is 'Seahorse Seashell Party.'
Brian trips out on this episode and Meg gives her parents the business, making them feel awful for always taking her for granted.  I'd say it was a long time overdue and an interesting twist in the series' sort of normality of putting Meg down all the time.

Without detailing all of this DVD set, I know I will love this Volume as much or more than previous ones, and I think season 10, which is well represented here, is one of their best.  I hope everyone gets a few 'yucks' out of this DVD, I know I will!",1377907200,6,1231,4.524886877828054

Here's the thing though that bugs me about this, you all seem to know a lot about this, so what does that tell me? It tells me that at some point in the past you bought the volumes that preceded this one. So, what are you complaining about? If you keep buying these things knowing that they've made this mistake before, that's your problem. Stop buying if that's your reason for believing that this one won't be any good. Also, who says that FOX can't release a full season? What stopped them from releasing the full season 5 on volume 6 of American Dad! on DVD? Nothing! Ok, sure, it wasn't a very long season, but they caught up on the proper season. Now, Family Guy has done the same. I believe that it will have the full season. Logic dictates to me that if they can release a full season of American Dad! on DVD then Family Guy can do the same. Also, who hasn't bought these past volumes to see the way these episodes were meant to be seen rather than the televised version? That's probably the only complaint I've had with the past volumes, the fact you can't watch them the way they were on television, but this show seems like it's on all the time so I can forgive that.",1376092800,,1295,4.377593360995851
