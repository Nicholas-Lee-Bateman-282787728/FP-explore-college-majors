7855554,3,6303916767,"I've had this tape for years now. I have to admit, although I bought it because it was John Tesh, I mainly like the violin parts with Charlie Bisharat. He really makes the songs that he plays in sound good, and I think, really steals the show! A lot of the songs are kind of boring, except for when Charlie plays. I had found a cassette tape of this, but Charlie wasn't on it. I got rid of it.",1415059200,,393,3.9873417721518987
7855555,5,6303916767,"In 1995, John Tesh made his PBS television premiere with his dream-come-true renowned concert live at Red Rocks Amphitheater in Denver, Colorado.  Prior to this breakthrough performance, Tesh had already been known as a former sports newscaster, as well as a successful New Age solo studio artist.  Essentially, Tesh's most famous composition, ""Roundball Rock"", had been revealed to the entire athletic world in 1990 as the theme for the NBA On NBC.  Five years later, his live act became a class act.
Maintaining the connection to sports and athletics, John Tesh combines his brilliant compositions with awe-inspiring acrobatics from famous Olympians (who took part in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain [a tune for which Tesh composed and performs at this concert]), both child and adult--showcasing elements of ballet, gymnastics, marathon running, and a beautiful parade of world flags throughout a few of the numbers (""Day One"", ""A Thousand Summers"", ""On American Shores"", ""In A Child's Eyes"", ""April Song"", and ""Group Five"").
The gorgeous natural environment--complete with thick caverns surrounding the amphitheater, fog and mist penetrating all the while--makes the sound quality of this show purer than pure!  Of course, the Colorado Symphony Orchestra, conducted by John Bisharat, contributes significantly to this oral wonder, with arrangements that truly make the music of John Tesh come alive!  Once you begin watching this video (yes, it is only available on VHS; 'twas never reissued on DVD), you too will break out of your seat and find yourself dancing with delight to the both the hard-rocking and slow-dancing grooves this music provokes within the listener, viewer, and performers.  After encouraging audience members who are ""watching this show with someone they are in love with"" to get up and slow-dance to ""Key Of Love"", John Tesh himself even ascends his piano bench to dance to his own music, all throughout the show!!!  He even makes reference to his lovely wife, Concetta Sellecchia, and their newborn daughter, Prima, when introducing the piece he wrote for her, entitled ""Concetta"", upon his proposal of marriage!  After the romantic piece concludes, Tesh goes over to his wife and daughter and gives them each a kiss; too sweet!!!!!!
It should be duly noted that the order of the musical pieces differs slightly on the video from the CD.  But not to worry; the alternate arrangements make for an equally exciting evening of music and harmony, including three additional tunes left off the 16-track companion CD (""The Games"", ""Homecoming"", and the encore, ""Exit Mulholland"")!  Around the midway point of the concert, it begins raining heavily, causing Tesh and the Orchestra to break briefly and wait for the rain to clear.  At this point, John Tesh and his bandmates go on performing by themselves--as the orchestra secretly leaves the premises to avoid getting drenched.  When they return, the performance virtually picks up from where it left off prior to the thunderstorm, and ends on an equally strong note.
Whether or not this is the first music or performance of John Tesh you have seen/listened to (I know it was for me and many others who, thanks to PBS, got exposed to the brilliance that lies within this musician), you will be hooked on his work forever, given the raw vigor and energy arousing from Red Rocks.  Live it today!",1357430400,,3371,5.12956204379562
