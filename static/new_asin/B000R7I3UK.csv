2860911,5,B000R7I3UK,"Boring as this DVD is and as repetitious as it is, IT WORKS!  Joyce has always been one of the best instructors out there, and I'm glad to see she is still out there getting all of us in shape.

Not a bunch of fancy movements.  Just the ""same ol, same ol"" with fantastic results!

Way to go, Joyce!  You still a hot mama!  :)",1206144000,32,325,3.923076923076923
2860912,5,B000R7I3UK,Great for a quick workout.  It packs in a lot in a short time.  Easy to do in the living room with a few hand weights.  At her age she is in amazing shape and very inspitational.  I have been using Joyce's workouts for a LONG time and love the results.  She knows what she is talking about.,1184198400,47,290,3.9310344827586206
2860952,4,B000R7I3UK,"Just started back to working out but really wanted to dive back in as I gained 25 lbs over the past year and was used to being at my ideal weight and pretty fit.  This video is great! It eases you back in while at the same time really making you work without even realizing it! I'm 4 weeks in and have definitely noticed a difference in muscle tone and strength.  I'be also lost 8 lbs and my pants are feeling alot more comfortable in the waist and hips :) Week 3 I was able to increase my weights to 5, 8 and 10 and I will likely be upping them again next week to 8,10 and 12. Other pros.... Short workouts that make everyday commitment easy for a busy lifestyle. I dislike doing cardio unless its hiking or biking outdoors so the fact that this has a mild cardio component is really helpful, you will sweat if you challenge yourself with the weights.  Cons: Joyce is a bit cheesy and he daughter who does the rep counting seems uninterested, but it can be kind of funny.... Also, only 4 weeks in I have been able to shut the sound off and just watch and listen to my iPod.  Also, some exercises in the upper routine are difficult with heaviest weight and others seem too easy. If you really pay attention and are on the ball you can switch weights during a giant set, for instance biceps are easier and I can use a heavier weight where my heaviest weight is quite challenging for triceps, so I switch in between, it's a fast switch :) I made a 6 week commitment myself on this video, I may make another 6 week commitment and continue to increase weights and see if my results continue to be as good.  Over all Quite PLEASED!",1359590400,12,1626,4.215434083601286
2860953,5,B000R7I3UK,"It is very good for me as it does what it says on the DVD. Hard going because just starting to use weights.
The stomach blast is extremely useful although I find the exercises rather too much. On the whole worth the money.  I can feel the results already. Thank you. Susan",1356825600,5,272,4.230769230769231
2860954,5,B000R7I3UK,"I Bought This Exercise Program Exactly Eleven Days Ago. I Received It Four Days Ago And Viewed It On That Night. I Then Went To Work First Thing Monday Morning, With The ""Upper"" Body Session. Zip, I Picked Up The Lightest Weight And Went Through That Whole Set. Then Zap, I Picked Up The Medium Weight And Started On The Next Set. Then Before Moving On To The Heaviest Weight, The Session Is Interrupted With An Abdominal Routine. Then Back To The Heaviest Weight Set. Then After That Was Over, I Had The Option To Continue Or Stop And Pick Up The Lower Body Workout The Next Day, Which I Did. And Joyce Zapped Me Through That Session Too. What Surprised Me Was The Interruption With The Abdominal Workout. I Thought That Would Be Included In With The Lower Body Workout, The Way They Are Presented In Her Books. But It Was Getting Through The Program So Quickly That Really Impressed Me. I Have Joyce's ""Fat-Burning Workout"" Book And Her ""Bottoms Up"" Book. And The ""Fat-Burning Workout"" Took Me No Less Than Forty-Five Minutes For The Upper Body Session And Forty-Five Minutes For The Lower Body. With The ""Bottoms Up"" Program, It Took Me No Less Than Two Hours For The Upper Body Session And No Less Than Two Hours For The Lower Body Session. I Didn't Have Two Hours To Devote To An Exercise Program. So I Couldn't Continue To Use The ""Bottoms Up"" Program. I Decided To Start E*Mailing Joyce. She Suggested That I Try Her ""Cougar Workout"", ""Fast Forward"", And ""Quick Quartet"" Workouts. I Do Own A Copy Of ""Quick-Quartet No Stopping Quick Shape Up"". I Haven't Tried That One Yet. All I know Is I Do Like This One. It Is To Early Yet To Tell Whether Or Not This Program Will Shape Me Up. I Can only Compare It To Those Of Her Programs I Have Tried. Joyce Is Rather Fast. She Will Have You Done And Moving On To Another Exercise Before You Know It. So Stay Focused. But Buy This. Just Keep In Mind That If You Exercise Your Entire Body, You Are Not To Use Weights The Next Day.",1329177600,8,1976,4.386920980926431
2860955,5,B000R7I3UK,"I am in my forties now and have been working out with Joyce for 20 years thru her books and dvds and have to say that she is the reason I am still wearing a size three and no sign of cellulite.  She is prove positive that one does not have to become unattractive and matronly because the years go by as it does for everyone.  Fact is that a lot of illness and being out of shape is caused by bad habits and inactivity and negative attitude rather than ageing.  Alcohol, drugs, cigarettes and poor food choices are all toxic to the body and it is nonsense to say that I am now forty so I cannot be attractive and full of life.  I love Joyce and her accent and her guts to go against the naysayers who use the age thing to tell women that they are too old to do things or be attractive.  Its one way to keep women in their place and keep us from having great lives.  Throw off the shackles of ageism and work out to Joyce and see the difference a regular workout regime will make in your life.  I hear people say that they don't have time to work out for half an hour a day but they find time to watch some show that won't do them any good at all.  Remember, if you cant find time to take care of yourself you will end up spending time at the doctors office or the hospital because of poor life style choices.  Poor health and overweight is the result of poor lifestyle choices, not ageing.  If you want to live long and healthy enough to play with your grandchildren grab a Joyce Vedral workout and make your life worth living.",1324771200,14,1526,4.073578595317726
2860956,4,B000R7I3UK,"I'm still at a stage where speed isn't as necessary as just doing it.  Watching this tape made my muscles ache; however, her approach is great as usual.  If you're in pretty good shape but want to be in better shape, you probably won't have any problems keeping up with this dvd.",1311033600,3,279,4.346153846153846
2860957,5,B000R7I3UK,"I've been doing Joyce Vedral's workouts since I had her book back in the early 90's. She's a matter-of-fact, raised in the Bronx go-getter who gets all the essentials in this DVD. I love the straight-forward workout with weights and how easy it is to work in your day no matter what -- it takes 20 minutes max. A big plus for busy moms.

For weights I used an adjustable weight set like these (highest weight is 12.5 lbs per dumbbell) I got up to 10 lbs for the highest weight for my pyramid sets, and that was plenty&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weider-PowerSwitch-12-5-lbs-Adjustable-Dumbbell-Pair/dp/B000N9E4N2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weider PowerSwitch 12.5 lbs Adjustable Dumbbell Pair</a>

Joyce is a bit of a character and has a good sense of humor -- she doesn't take herself too seriously and she constantly encourages you with ""You'll look better than me!"" She is 65 and no one can deny Joyce looks great. Her style may not appeal to everyone, esp. younger women if you want a ""cool, hip"" workout with cool, hip young people. For anyone over 40, you'll appreciate Joyce's encouragement that anyone can look good at any age.

I have 3-4 of her DVDs just to mix up the workouts, but this is the best. I got great results and my only problem was...I stopped working out to Joyce's DVD and REGRET IT! Working out on the treadmill 5-6 days a week and light hiking doesn't cut it! I'm starting again because it works.",1288137600,17,1470,4.9918367346938775
2860958,5,B000R7I3UK,"I truly dislike working out but have no problem with this workout.  In fact, I look forward to doing this workout.  It's fast-paced, well-cued and over before you know it.  By the time I'm done with it, I know I've gotten a good workout without having to spend hours in a gym.",1271635200,14,276,4.269230769230769
2860959,4,B000R7I3UK,"I wanted to try one of Joyce's workouts because she looks terrific for her age!  Weight training has given her definition. I chose this one because it can be broken down into 2 separate 20 minute workouts, one for day one, the other day 2.
Aside from her not being a great actress (you can see her reading the cues and making some mistakes) i would recommend this because its ""speedy"" and uses weights for resistance training. The DVD is really set up for a continuous workout with a warmup in the very beginning and no cool down!  When you start in the middle to do workout #2 you need to do your own warmup/cooldown.  The ab workout is a serious of crunches.  She does 3 sets of each exercise using more weight/less reps each time.  This DVD is ideal for the working woman (like me)...followed up by some cardio on the treadmill or walking. Its only been a week and I actually look forward to this because I can fit it into my schedule and I feel the burn.  Joyce suggests increasing the weights as you get stronger.",1259020800,11,1018,4.35978835978836
2860960,5,B000R7I3UK,"I used to lift weights (quite heavy ones, as I had a job that occasionally required very heavy lifting.) I used to go to the gym, work with a trainer and even bench press 90 lb barbells, which for an over-40 woman is not so easy.

Then I got lazy (and fat, hopefully not dumb) and very busy when I started a new career. I have very little time anymore to do anything. I have a collection of Joyce Vedral's books, from full workouts with weights to short, you-can-do-it-in-a-hotel-room workouts with one set of dumbbells and a phone book. But I recently discovered this DVD and this is a GREAT WORKOUT. This does it all, it takes 15 minutes or thereabouts, and you only need minimal space and equipment. When you are finished, you've done strength exercises with weights (good for bones and muscle mass) AND aerobics, AND abs/core.

The equipment you need is minimal. You need a triple set of dumbbells (2,3,5 but working up to heavier ones later on, say 3,5,8 or 5,8,10 so eventually you may have five or six pairs. I have&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neoprene-Dumbbells/dp/B002BUUVC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neoprene Dumbbells</a>&nbsp;and I like them because they don't clank on my laminate floor in the bedroom. I also use a yoga mat and a physio ball for a bench (you need a bench, but I don't have one and the ball works fine.) THAT'S IT. How cool is that? You can have a gym in a space the size of a small bedroom.

The workout is by days, first you do upper body with abs, and then lower body on the next day. The workout takes about 15 minutes and it is done with super-sets. Super-sets are a continuous arrangement of exercises that pair opposing muscle groups (for example, biceps versus triceps) with an additional muscle group (say, lats) and you move through a group of muscles with one single weight. Then you return to the same sequence with a heavier weight and then the heaviest weight, three super-sets in all and YOU WILL FEEL IT. The first set is oh, so easy. But when you hit set #3, you will know you've worked out.

The video is very plain-Jane. The camera has a few angles focusing on Vedral and her workout buddy, who does the counting (sans annoying headset mic) and Vedral offers a bit of encouragement but this is pretty basic. You are there to work and get the job done. The set is simply a laminate floor, 2 benches and mats and the workout team, nothing else. No pretty pots of ferns on a mistily-lit studio floor with vistas of the Pacific Northwest shrouded in fog in the background. And Dr. Vedral has a New York accent which may grate on the Suth'n ladies' sensibilities but she has a pleasant tone (I love Denise Austin, but that raspy soprano makes me want to bang my head against the wall in five minutes of listening to her.)

You can memorize this workout fairly easily as it is logical (think which muscles are opposing and you will get this down in a few repetitions.) So you may not even have to watch the DVD after a while and just grab those dumbbells and be done in 18 minutes.

I like the abs workout--many many different exercises with legs in different positions that work upper, lower and (not so much) obliques. I prefer a certain oblique exercise and I like doing my abs on the physio ball, so I modified this a bit and do some of the abs on the ball rather than on the mat. But it's a very intensive core workout, though nothing like Pilates.

I also modified this a bit and use a ball rather than a bench. I don't have a bench currently in the room (though I'd like one) and the ball is great for the same exercises and it uses your core at the same time as you prop yourself on the ball on your back with legs on the floor. If you aren't used to the ball, you might try to find a simple bench. They can be found at yard sales, Craigslist or sales at big-box and fitness stores and are not so expensive. When you are done working out, you can shove it at the end of the bed and plop a duvet on it, if you work out in your bedroom as I do. I may end up doing this, though the ball is very fun.

Summary: GREAT 18 minute workout. Can be done almost anywhere if you have dumbbells and a bench and a floor. Good for travelers (hotel gyms may have a set of dumbbells) and small spaces. GETS THE JOB DONE. For the lazy-to-get-to-the-gym or time-crunched, this is a life-saver.",1253750400,49,4373,4.443890274314215
2860961,5,B000R7I3UK,I don't know how Joyce packs so much into one video.  This one has it all.  I was impressed.  The workouts are terrific and fast.  They get the job done without spending hours at the gym.  Wonderful!,1210723200,17,199,4.27027027027027
8199268,5,B000R7I3UK,"My abs have never been so strong!  I mainly use the upper body routine on this video. During the upper body portion, Joyce takes a break from lifting to incorporate the abs routine and then comes back off the mat to finish the third weight set. Highly recommended. You will feel proud when you can complete the 315 reps of abdominal work (7 different ab exercises at 15 reps each, performed three times in a row).  Has really helped my low back pain.",1457481600,,450,4.409638554216867

After gaining 20 pounds and not working I got this dvd because it only takes 20 minutes a day.  I am not an exercise lover!  After working with this dvd for 2 months I have 6 pack abs and have lost inches all over.  It is quick, straight to the point and over just when you think you can do more. If you want quick results and no frills this is the dvd to get!",1424563200,4,449,3.694736842105263
8199271,5,B000R7I3UK,Joyce Vedral is a bit strange but I really do like the DVD.  I am glad I got it!.  I play my own music and just follow along.  I really did see results.  My arms are tone and muscular looking.  I have had this for a long while and slowly progressed up in my weights 25 and 30bls is the heaviest so far.,1418860800,,302,3.7301587301587302

8199273,5,B000R7I3UK,"Purchased this workout a few weeks ago.....I love this workout!!  I am in my late 50s and had been attempting to do workouts with my daughter, but was not able to do the acrobatics that her workouts called for, such as doing 15 burpees in a row, then 20 pushups...and repeat 10 times! . Even the modifiers were difficult to follow!  This DVD consists of basic weight lifting moves. The degree of difficulty comes as the weights are increased gradually to increase strength. And the length of the DVD, which is approximately 20 minutes long for upper and 20 minutes for lower body, is short enough time to get it done even on a busy day....which leads to consistency with workouts.",1396915200,6,680,4.6115702479338845
8199274,5,B000R7I3UK,"I was doing Tracy Anderson, and this is so much better. There's no annoying chatter or stalling. She's efficient with your time, and I like her personality a lot. She's like a no-nonsense mom or grandma who is beautiful and in great shape and full of helpful knowledge. I guess if it's important to you to have someone young and fashionable teach you exercise (seriously, I think those reviewers are beyond shallow and weirdly ageist), you should go elsewhere, but you'll be robbing yourself of an instructor who knows what she's doing, and helps you to get a good workout in quickly. I do turn the volume off and listen to music, but I did that with (the much more chatty and long-winded) Tracy Anderson too. And I've gotten better results with this one.",1396656000,7,755,4.641791044776119
8199275,5,B000R7I3UK,This workout looks deceptively easy! At first u watched Joyce swinging those weights like toys and I wasn't too impressed but I kept the faith after all this is Joyce Vedral. But after 2 days using the workout I'll say this. I am in as much pain if not more than longer and more frenzied workouts. What I feel now there is potential to see results soon I believe if I am consistent. Whats also great is it's pretty short too. I couldn't believe I was done today in maybe 15 minutes or so. It went quickly and finito! As quick as this goes by I think sticking with it will be easy. I love this workout I have to say. As for Joyce she's colorful and very authentic she's terrific. I must be the only person who didn't know she had DVDs and videos but I knew some of her books.  I see why this DVD is so well rated. I don't think I'll regret it and neither will you.
