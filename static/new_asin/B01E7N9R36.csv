7732046,4,B01E7N9R36,"As I learned from the interviews in the two bonus features (six-minute interviews with two of the stars on one; an interview with the director on the other), this film is supposed to be a modern version of The Thomas Crown Affair(1968) which starred Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. In some ways it resembles Oceans 11 (or Oceans 12) in the sense that a diamond heist is being planned by a team of about 10 (I lost count) criminals. Theres a lot of action going on (and, honestly, some of the scenes  like drilling a large hole in a bathroom wall that wouldnt be noticed  confused me.

There are a lot of twists and turns to the plot and  if youve read my other DVD or BD reviews here on Amazon  you know I HATE spoilers. So I won't tell you about these or spoil the ending.

No, this is not a five star movie but the cast is attractive and you won't expect some of the turns. If you liked film like TTCA, youll enjoy this one. It is in French and the subtitles were easy to read.

The film was released in 2014 but is now making its DVD release from Cohn Media Group.
There is no nudity (and I don't remember ant foul language) but there is some graphic violence and some scenes are bloody. The film runs 108 minutes.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7732047,3,B01E7N9R36,"The Last Diamond is about a planned theft of a valuable, ancient jewel. Simon Carrerra (Yvan Attal) has just been released from prison and is now on parole. His friend Albert persuades him back to his old ways with the idea of stealing a celebrated diamond  the Florentine  in Antwerp, where it is soon to come up for auction after the death of its owner. The owners daughter, Julia (Berenice Bejo), is in charge of the sale. Simon meets Julia while posing as a friend of her mother, and uses their relationship to get to the diamond.

The first part of the film develops like a traditional romantic comedy sparked by crime. The latter section deepens characterization, exploring themes of honor among thieves, greed, and loves ability to change a person. The plot has several interesting twists and stays ahead of the viewer with unexpected situations that cause shifts in characters motivations. Director/co-writer Eric Barbier has imbued the characters with wit and intelligence, qualities often sacrificed to serve plot in sloppily crafted movies. Unfortunately, the ending doesnt live up to the classy build-up.

The scenes of the robbery are the films best, as the meticulously detailed plan is carried out. If it had been devoted entirely to the robbery, the movie would have been a terrific caper thriller. But a tacked-on sequence in which Simon seeks redemption dulls the overall impact.

Bonus features on the DVD release include an interview with director Eric Barbier, interview with stars Berenice Bejo and Yvan Attal, and theatrical trailer. The R-rated film is in French, with English subtitles.",1469404800,2,1611,5.087121212121212

7732058,4,B01E7N9R36,"Brisk pace; the camera is moving across the details of the story, so the subtitles are only a minor intrusion. The acting is nuanced and understated. Quirks of humor provide visual relief and depth, an insider's view. A French movie with a French feel, you should watch and appreciate the difference in the French and American forms of action-heist cinema to be engaged and entertained.

I'm glad I did.  It is a fun movie.  Not too complicated or simple, with a few good twists.  Enough to hold your interest, and even get a few laughs.  There are a few weak points in the story (hence 4 stars), but the pace of the action and story, along with the fun bits, make up for it.",1494892800,3,454,3.934065934065934
7732062,2,B01E7N9R36,"This is one of the worst French films!  Don't waste your time, luckily I was trying to fall asleep when I watched it, although I viewed the entire trite film.
I thought at first it was a comedy take on the original Pink Panther, and  that would have been ok, but this film is predictable and not believable.  I am a lover of French films but this stinks.
How I miss the the great auteurs, Truffaut etc!  I hate to think that the French are going in the direction of Hollywood?  What would I watch then?",1492646400,,502,4.1875

7732064,4,B01E7N9R36,"It would seem stretching the plot to the point of near unbelievably convoluted is the norm for major heist movies. This French entry wasn't much different though it did have a nice plot twist after the robbery. Its sub-titled and it would be a great improvement if they went with something other than white lettering or putting it in a black box because on a light background it can be impossible to read. If you can ignore the incredible plot contrivances and the impeccable timing of everything youll make it to the end and shouldnt be disappointed for doing so. Whoever said the sub-titles were easy to read must have seen them displayed differently than in this version. Worth the view but I find caper movies very entertaining with high production values, good effects, fats moving, lots of gimmicks and with the usual double-dealing scruffy bad guys so it gets 4-stars.",1491091200,2,875,4.801324503311259

It's not as complicated a scheme as Ocean's 11 for example, but it's enough to be intrigued throughout.  It does get a little slow at times, and I don't really see someone like Berenice Bejo and Yvan Attel getting together in real life, but I guess that's the movies for you.  This probably won't be in your top 10 favorite movies, but it's a good way to spend a weeknight.",1479168000,4,461,4.264367816091954
