7052138,5,B00UM7FX9O,"What is the look of a killer?  It is how Viktor Karppa's former KGB bosses described his expressionless visage.  No matter if he is in pain, fearful, about to be killed, or grieving, Viki's face never changes.  He is a man, however, and feels emotions but cannot show them.  He loves his sweet mother, his shady brother and a beautiful young woman, yet cannot bring himself to say the words.  Samuli Edelmann's skillful portrayal of this anti-hero is compelling and I had to stay up almost all night because I could not stop watching.  Dirty politics, threatening mafia, blackmailing Russian spies, cultural discrimination and watchful local police all hover over Viktor while he tries to establish a sense of normalcy in his turbulent life.  All the acting is spot-on, bringing a wide variety of characters to life.  Love this series and hope there is a Season Two.  Thank you, Finland.",1431648000,5,887,4.86
8707391,4,B00UM7FX9O,A bit slow at first but drawn into the world of the Russian and Estonian gangsters operating in the least populated country in the EU. Complex and engaging lead with some terrific supporting characters,1501718400,,201,4.9411764705882355

8707394,5,B00UM7FX9O,"Well done!  We love Nordic Noir, Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish detective series, and all over the world map.  But Finland was a new adventure!  The hero, Finnish but raised in Russia, was excellent in his acting role as good guy and sometime detective assisting police. The plot and scenery were educational as well as a broadening of our cultural appreciation, once again allowing us to escape the boring sameness of the American Hollywood actors and extreme but impossible plots propped up by too much action, violence, and noise (with the recent exception of ""True Detective"" (first series). We enjoyed every minute and are ready for a second series.",1463616000,,654,5.037037037037037
8707395,4,B00UM7FX9O,"Sufficiently violent to appeal to the general public, with an element of the redeemed ""good guy"" after all !! It did not hold my undivided attention, but overall a good interpretation of present day Finland, (I think ?!). As far as I am concerned, the most appealing character is the Finnish plain clothes police officer who essentially holds the ""middle line !!"" I am a huge fan of Scandinavian productions, but this one did not entirely live up to my expectations, although, as the saying goes ""comparisons are odious!!""",1463616000,2,522,4.876404494382022
8707396,5,B00UM7FX9O,"What I enjoyed most about this series was its convincing depiction of the protagonist's (Victor Karppa) interactions with a complex, multi-national cast of characters (Finnish mob, Estonian mob, Russian mob, KGB, ethnic Finns living in the improverished Karelia area of Russia, Finnish police, Russian diplomats, struggling immigrants and those who exploit them, tax avoiders, loan sharks, prostitutes, students, etc.). Victor's background (ethnic Finn born and educated in Russia, former KGB employee) draws him into increasingly complicated and dangerous situations when he claims his Finnish citizenship and moves to Helsinki to start a business as a ""representative"". Victor is not a killer, even though people around him often seem to end up dead. Victor is seen as a hero by the people he rescues.",1461283200,4,803,5.536585365853658
8707397,5,B00UM7FX9O,"A great protagonist with an interesting back story, beautiful views of Helsinki.  Excellent job on the English subtitles, so you really feel you are getting the Finnish irony in the dialogue.  We'll be watching the entire series at our house.  The story is continuous, rather than episodic.",1460937600,3,290,5.127659574468085
8707398,2,B00UM7FX9O,"Sucks, bad acting, crappy dialogue, stopped watching half way through.  Don't waste your money on this dog",1458864000,,106,5.235294117647059

8707400,4,B00UM7FX9O,"This series took a little while to grow on me as it is so different from the Swedish/Danish variants i am more used to. The production is not quite as polished and the ""pacing and feel"", but particularly the language, are so different from their Swedish counterparts. Nevertheless the plotting is excellent and the characters and background start to become more familiar and intriguing. I ended up really enjoying the series and hope there will be another. Highly recommended !",1452643200,3,477,4.975
