8276880,2,B001AD54HU,I agree with Gary from Los Angeles. I have always enjoyed biblical movies and now collect them.  I saw this one in the theater when it first came out. I distinctly remember the color being bright and vivid. This movie was hard to get so I was thrilled finally to obtain a VHS version. But I was disappointed with the picture quality. So when the DVD came out I was really hoping that it had been restored/remastered. Nope. It looks like they made the DVD from the lousy VHS - and this time I was REALLY disappointed. How unprofessional! But like Gary I kept it because I like the movie. I'm still hoping a better version will come out. I've seen much worse movies restored so why not this one? Or at least find a better version to make the DVD!!,1310860800,2,745,4.283687943262412
8276881,2,B001AD54HU,The quality of DVD-Rs from Sinister Cinema is always variable. This is one of the worst. On a regular TV the image is letterboxed at about 1.75 with the picture looking squashed together. On a flat screen you can adjust the image to the correct 2.35 aspect ratio. This is the only positive aspect of this DVD other than the movie itself. The source print it is taken from has no color at all and it is scratched with splices throughout. If I didn't like the movie so much I would have only given it one star. This film deserves a better presentation but right now I suppose this is as good as it gets.,1279152000,5,601,4.234782608695652
