553913,5,6303017991,"Katheryn Grayson and Joel Mcrea are delightful in this musical.
It's romantic with some great songs and costu,es.  It has the lovely desert scenes.  It's a must see musical film to see over and over.",1054857600,10,199,4.6571428571428575
553914,1,6303017991,"The movie version of ""The Desert Song,"" with Gordon MacRae and Kathryn Grayson, is an okay musical movie, but in many significant respects it bears only a passing resemblance to the stage version.  Having participated in the chorus of a high school production of Desert Song in 1953, I was very much disappointed in the movie.
 The name of the female lead in the stage version is Margot Bonvalet, and the name of her opposite number is  Pierre Birabeau, son of the French General.  The name of his rival for the affections of Margot is Paul Fontaine.  Pierre is portrayed as a weak, indecisive individual.  However, he also masquerades as The Red Shadow, leader of the  Riffs, a group resisting the French colonial government.
 The movie distorts these relationships by making Margot the daughter of the General  and eliminating Paul Fontaine altogether.  Unfortunately, the important and amusing musical byplay between Paul, Pierre, and Margot also vanishes.
Ali ben Ali and Sid El Kar, who sing ""Let Love Come As Some Rare Treasure"" and ""If One Flower Grows Alone In Your Garden"" are absent, as is the scene where they sing those selections and Pierre responds with one of the great love songs  of American musical theater, ""One Alone.""
The rousing chorus numbers when the French troops return home are absent, as is any evidence of the treachery of Azuri, the native girl who is in love with The Red Shadow.
The movie version is passable entertainment for one unfamiliar with the stage version, but it is a pale shadow of the stage masterpiece.",1029283200,37,1547,4.844106463878327

553916,5,6303017991,"I love those old musicals, and Gordon Macrae's wonderful baritone makes this one of my favorites. Macrae is a Clark Kent-ish  anthropologist: mild, scholarly, and uninterested in love, also disguised as ""the man of action"" El Khobar, the secret Riff leader, dedicated to protecting the desert people in time of need. To spice up the plot enter Margot: the vibrant and capricious general's daughter who is searching for excitement and love. Add to this the hilarious gossip columnist who will risk anything to get his story, a jealous palace dancer rival for El Khobar's love, a dastardly villain, and a hauntingly beautiful musical score, along with the backdrop of the beautiful African desert. This operetta acheives a wonderful balance of romance, comedy, action, and music that you just don't see anymore!",971308800,64,809,5.175572519083969
553997,4,6303017991,"I finally got an old, hard to find Musical that I have always liked! Desert Song isn't one of great, classic musicals but it has great singing and an interesting plot.  After years of thinking about this movie, finally seeing it again was a real treat!  It's slow moving and also more contrived (think Zorro aka El Kobar on the Desert) than I remember which is why I am not marking it ""Love It"".  But I am definitely impressed by the singing of Grayson and McRae which is the best part of this film.",1482969600,,499,4.287234042553192

The sound and picture were of great quality making the experience of viewing The Desert Song a pleasurable time.  We enjoyed seeing something we had not seen in decades and to be able to see it with the same quality we saw it originally was and extra bonus.  I highly recommend this DVD.,1475712000,,447,4.162790697674419
554000,1,6303017991,"This DVD was purchased as ""New, in origional factory wrap."" The  DVD was a disaster!! There were pauses, skips, fragmentations and (the worst) complete absence of the final scene where Margot finds out  that El Kholbar is actuatly the professor. Hopefully this copy is one of a kind but I would suggest that anyone offering this  DVD for sale should check their discs for quality. Actually the one star rating is not deserved!

554004,4,6303017991,"If you have seen the stage production of The Desert Song, you may be disappointed in some changes that were made for this NEW Desert Song. Some changes:
 1) Only Margot and Pierre (now named Paul) sing solos.- They are beautiful, but many wonderful songs are lost.
 2) The leader of the Riffs is El Khobar in this version, but the Red Shadow in the stage production. But, El Khobar does wear a red scarf.
 2) If One Flower Grows Alone in Your Garden is sung by Margot. Consequently, it doesnt make sense as that song and One Alone are two songs between one of the Riffs and The Red Shadow as they debate the pros of Eastern and Western styles of love  i.e. a harem vs a single love.
 3) In the original musical, Pierre was in the French Legion, but when he defended the Riffs after being ordered to raid the Riff villages, he was struck in the head by the then governor and ended up wimpy and half idiotic. His father, General Birabeau, became the new governor. Margot, who was a ward of General Birabeau,  was to wed Capt Fontaine. However, in this version, Pierre is Paul and he is a brilliant professor with two Masters degrees and two PhDs. Moreover, Paul when not posing as the Red Shadow/El Khobar is quite normal looking and acting. It is hard to be convinced he wouldnt be suspected as being the Red Shadow/El Khobar.
 4) In the stage production, Pierre was the only son of the general, Birabeau,  that came to Morocco to govern it. Margot was not General Birabeaus daughter, but his ward. This meant the entire ending had to change.
 5) Benjies secretary, Susan, who had some nice comedy scenes with Benjie, didn't exist in this version.
I didn't think the changes added anything to the production, but I did still enjoy the singing!",1466899200,,1742,4.470031545741325

554103,4,6303017991,"Improbable and politically incorrect but tuneful and exciting, this is the most recent film incarnation of Sigmund Romberg's 1926 operetta, ""inspired,"" says Wikipedia, ""by the 1925 uprising of the Riffs, a group of Moroccan fighters, against French colonial rule...[and] by stories of Lawrence of Arabia aiding native guerrillas.""  (Purists should note that most of the songs from the stage production have been eliminated, for reasons unclear, and several others have had their lyrics altered, while a new one, ""Gay Parisienne,"" has been added.)

In the 1920's in French Morocco, the Riff tribe of desert nomads has broken out in banditry, not against the French, but against their treaty-partner and administrator, Sheik Yousseff (Raymond Massey), a subtle and clever man who has managed to thoroughly pull the wool over the eyes of local Foreign Legion commander Capt. Claude Fontaine (Steve Cochran).  The Legion has been treating the situation as Top Secret, but word has leaked out all the same, bringing brash and persistent New York reporter Benjy Kidd (Dick Wesson) to town, where he's taken rooms with Paul Bonnard (Gordon MacRae), B.Sc., M.A., LL.D., Ph. D., an anthropologist who spends much of his time out on the desert, living with the tribes and studying their customs.  Or so he'd have everybody think--for in reality Bonnard is El Khobar, the Riff chieftain, who has mounted a clever campaign against Youssef and the private army he's assembling under the very noses of the French.  Stealing from Youssef and redistributing his booty among the tribes the sheik has been plundering, El Khobar has gained the loyalty and devotion of all the Riffs, including lieutenants Hassan (Paul Picerni) and Mindar (Frank deKova) and Yousseff's latest-recruited dancing girl, Azuri (Allyn MacLerie), who's in love with him--although Mindar often complains that El Khobar isn't ruthless enough.

While the Legionnaires fight to keep Benjy out of their headquarters, somebody else gets in--Margot Birabeau (Kathryn Grayson), who has wheedled her way aboard the mail plane from Casablanca after fleeing the boring finishing school in which her father had installed her.  Unexpectedly her father, a general (Ray Collins), arrives on an official mission to uncover the truth about the Riffs--are they the bandits and outlaws Fontaine believes, or is there some reason behind their attacks?  In hopes of keeping the girl out of trouble, the General engages Bonnard to continue Margot's schoolwork--which, of course, puts him in the perfect position to find out what the Legion is up to.  But Bonnard isn't interested in espionage so much as he is in furthering the General's quest for the truth.  Meanwhile Fontaine, seeing clearly the possible advantages of being a general's son-in-law, has set out to get her to fall in love with him, while Yousseff draws together the threads of a tangled plot intended to get the French concentrating on a nonexistent enemy, and Margot unwittingly becomes a pawn in his scheme, only to be rescued when El Khobar abducts her.  Soon it's up to them, with assistance from Benjy and Azuri, to expose the sheik's plan and get a fighting force into his walled fortress before he can make his move.

Grayson and MacRae, of course, contribute beautiful trained voices and physical attractiveness to the movie, and there's plenty of desert pageantry and a flamboyant and exciting dance number by Azuri and the other girls as Youssef entertains the French in his palace.  The story, like that of most operettas, won't bear close attention, and there's a good deal of rather obvious blue-screen work, but it's still one of the best examples of the kind of dashing romanticism that was once popular on the American and European stage, and naturally transitioned to film.",1437004800,3,3794,5.169657422512235

There was an attempt at comedy with a bumbling American reporter, but it fell short in my opinion.

554399,4,6303017991,"The music of Sigmund Romberg are lovely romantic ballads and the operetta ""The Desert Song"" is no exception.  What better person to sing them in the third movie version than Gordon MacRae with his magnificently rich baritone/tenor voice.  He is joined by Kathryn Grayson, who sings with him on a couple of songs as well as by herself.  The movie story is exciting and also includes some humorous sequences.  For those who like comparing musical performances, Gordon MacRae also performed music from ""The Desert Song"" with both Dorothy Kirsten and Lucille Norman, both from The Metropolitan Opera, for vinyl record releases.  I personally feel that his partnering with Dorothy Kirsten is the superior version, but for those not familiar with Romberg operettas, Warner Brothers' ""The Desert Song"" is an excellent starting point. I do not think this movie is available on dvd at this time.",1302912000,2,886,5.082758620689655

they left humming the songs. The tape was well recorded and the colors were fine. this
movie came out in 1992. I saw it then and always had a fond memory of both actors..although
they never made another movie we thought they sang together beautifully...LOVE IT...",1289001600,,349,4.737704918032787
554401,4,6303017991,"I love Ali Baba and Sinbad movies and also musicals from the past cause there were so many great singers like Nelson Eddy and Jeanette Macdonald. This is due
to my Mom that was a great fan of those musical movies. Having just bought the
Desert Song, i have to say that its one of those wonderfull movies that came
to our television with great Arabian sceneries and great songs. It was as good
as when i saw it many moons ago...and will now be a keeper for a yearly view.
  Lets just hope someone makes a right decision and puts it on DVD.
A Keeper for sure.",1281916800,,557,4.148148148148148
554402,5,6303017991,"I saw ""The Desert Song"" when it was first released. I am a fan of Gordan MacRae and Kathryn Grayson. If you like light opera and romantic story settings this is great. The one thing I didn't like is it is not on DVD.  My VHS copy was very good, however. It's a collector's item for sure.",1268438400,3,287,4.035087719298246
554403,5,6303017991,"This is an old operetta made into a musical.  This may be a loss to operetta fans, but the cinematography and sheer chemistry between the protagonists more than makes up for the name changes or the loss of some of the old musical numbers and double entendres.

Now how about a DVD?",1228694400,,281,4.384615384615385
554404,5,6303017991,"I love old musicals and think Gordon MacRae was one of the greatest singers of all times.  I have quite a collection of these, including an out-of-print copy of ""Deep In My Heart,"" the story of Sigmund Romberg's career.  I also have ""The Student Prince.""  This movie, ""The Desert Song,"" was really fun to watch and filled with great music.  The acting of some of these old singers is not as great as their singing, but if you like the old musicals the way I do, this is one of the best.  My only regret is that so many of them are only available on VHS and have not been made into DVD format.",1216598400,,592,4.157894736842105
554405,3,6303017991,"Watched this movie dozens of times at a youth, but not up to current movie standards.  The music is great.",1189814400,,106,4.3
554406,4,6303017991,"Great fun; great kitsch.  The opening scenes with the obvious rear-screen projection, matte paintings, and intercut desert footage are laughable from a directorial point of view.  The plot is stereotypical, but perfect, with unctuous baddies, a mustachioed rival, and uppity leading lady.  As soon as Gordon and Kathryn begin to sing, however, we are transfixed, and all of the cinematic hoo-ha dissolves in the schmaltz of Sigmund Romberg.  In short, it's delicious, and you succumb to it because the songs are so wonderful.  And with Ray Collins as the wise general who helps sort out Arabia, what more could you ask?  Note, there really were riffs and they really did have a legendary leader--in Morocco.",1185753600,11,707,5.104347826086957
554407,5,6303017991,If you  love light opera you will not go wrong with this one. Gordon McRae and Kathryn Grayson at their best,1180656000,6,108,4.142857142857143
554408,5,6303017991,"This movie was as I remembered seeing it in the 1950's. Gordon Macrae is the handsome dashing hero, who happens to have one of the greatest singing voices ever. (He was  Curly in Oklahoma.) So the movie is a bit smuchly! It is still one of the most romantic movies ever.  If you want all the music of the operetta, you'll have to buy an audio recording. But still all the favorites are here. Pop some popcorn, light the fire, put your feet up, and enjoy.",1107907200,23,454,4.267441860465116

7836689,4,6303017991,I HAD BEEN SEARCHING FOR THIS MOVIE FOR A LONG TIME.  THE QUALITY WAS EXCELLENT AND I KNOW THAT I'LL BE WATCHING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN,1513555200,,135,4.0
7836690,5,6303017991,an all time favorite - but of course no captions,1509148800,,48,3.9

7836692,5,6303017991,"For fans of MacCrae and Grayson, this is a must.  Their voices are fresh and young and the sound and look of the DVD is awesome.  Although the story is silly and the characters' dialogue is sillier,  no one watches for acting and deep meaning.  Thanks to Warner for transferring this to DVD so beautifully.  It is a delight for those of us hungry for great musical talents today.",1495065600,,379,4.434782608695652

7836695,5,6303017991,"The story here, involving tribal conflicts in the middle east, is OK, but the singing by two of the best (Kathryn Grayson, Gordon MacRae ) is outstanding. Raymond Massey is an excellent villain, and Dick Wesson provided comic relief as he did in so many films.",1489190400,,260,4.673913043478261

7836697,2,6303017991,"This movie did not meet my expectations at all. Kathryn Grayson's costumes were not very good, and there was too much violence. Also, it seemed rather silly when the Riffs started singing when they attacked.",1483142400,,207,4.942857142857143
