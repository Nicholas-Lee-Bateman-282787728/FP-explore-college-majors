7794496,4,0972659021,"The first part of the film is a bit hard to watch because it was not done professionally, but the information is great. The second part was done much better and didn't feel as dated as the first part. The scientific evidence for a plant based diet is well presented and the scenes of factory farming is heartbreaking.",1370044800,,317,4.482758620689655

It is an eye opener on how our food is produced and processed, and the truth is, there are some very questionable things going on that everyone should be aware of.

Unlike one reviewer's thoughts (which I can understand why he would feel that way), I actually liked it more as it went along, and thought the second half was just as powerful, if not more so for me, in it's own right.  I had not expeted it, but I was impressed that he showed the full spectrum of our country's (and spreading throughout the world's) food supply/diet choices.

Awesome documentary.",1204070400,6,459,4.772151898734177

Statistically, 1.5 million Americans die from heart disease annually. This DVD will definately change that! As a practitioner of Herbology and Naturopathy, I have finally discovered THE most critical element in the healing process. Without question, A PLANT BASED DIET IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN ANY HEALING PROTOCOL. If you suffer from ANY degenerative disease (Heart disease, Diabetes, Cancer, etc.), you must first part company with the Standard American Diet (SAD) and secondly you must adopt a plant based diet, in order to conquer and overcome your condition. Using a plant based diet, the Gerson Clinic (World renown for its Cancer therapy) has successfully cured Diabetics, in just two weeks! This DVD has changed my life and it will definately change yours. It is truly a life saver! Buy it and share it with family and friends. Michael Anderson's latest installment, ""Healing Cancer from Inside Out"", is equally as dynamic! I highly recommend it. I give them both, FIVE stars! ""The greatest gift than one can give his fellow man, is the gift of health"". Michael Anderson has given us just that! Bravo!",1190764800,11,1259,5.146341463414634
7794503,3,0972659021,"This film is a documentary. The following isn't meant to be comprehensive -- simply one person's opinion and commentary on a few of the images that stand out in this work.

Early on, a memorable interviewee is Pinckney, who, once at death's door, now has the arteries of a 21-year-old and has started support groups for others facing bypass surgery. What a great service this person is doing. Juxtaposing this casually-dressed person with the white-coated folk throughout the first half of the film is a brilliant technique.

The commentary about the dairy lobby (and the tobacco links and comparisons) are also valuable. It's worth repeating that the dairypeople have $30 billion at their yearly disposal for advertising, yet the organic, health sector has only has 30 million going out to promote healthful foods. Anderson's point? There is a PR agent from the industry in every kitchen.

Then there is the parallel between deaths from food and deaths in war. Of course, the military-industrial complex is another sector that sends us multiple messages, and the promotion of violence now just runs itself--in sit-coms, in cop shows, in video games, in school sports classes, on the news. And Anderson rightly points out that TV is anything but nutritionally beneficial.

Throughout the film a few good, well-illustrated facts came onto the screen. For example: an image of milk and cookies changes into a glass of meat and cookies, and we learn that three glasses of milk has the artery-clogging equivalent of 21 slices of bacon. (I would like it if the film said no animal flesh or milk was actually bought for the show. I don't know if the film did this; I could have missed it.)

Then there was the straightforward dismissal of the heavy-duty myths: white meat, protein, and the Atkins Diet. These and similar promotions and myths have unfortunately caused U.S. meat consumption to double in just 50 years.

The first half is stronger than the second half of the production.

The second half, which I count from when Anderson introduces the RAVE Diet, seems geared to someone in a life-threatening situation. Fats are ruled out.  If people avoid bypass or chemotherapy with this particularly strict, no-exceptions protocol, then by all means, they should do it. But as one who has been a vegan for more than twenty years, I do feel comfortable stating that a vegan diet can clear up many common health concerns. Thus, we can have our olive oil, I think, without worrying that it'll do us in. Indeed, some natural vegetable oils are used in the regions of the world that the first half on the film holds up as dietary models. Definitely, all good vegan diets, including John McDougall's well-known protocol, make it clear that refined, saturated oils should be off-limits, and that oils should only be used sparingly. But the great weight of the vegan material shows that cold-pressed, organic vegetable oils such as olive oil and flax oil have benefits for a typical, active vegan.

A review of the past 60 years of literature surrounding the vegan diet suggests strongly that if people worldwide would go vegan, their health generally would improve so much (simply due to cutting out animal cholesterol) that they could avoid most of the situations that might make a very strict protocol appropriate. And so, not being a doctor, I tend to lean in the direction of not making the vegan diet sound so strict that it's hard to attain except for the few (or the life-threatened).

That said, Michael Anderson does not self-identify as vegan, and simply promoting veganism is not the point of this film. Anderson's view of veganism suggests that people eating a diet of doughnuts and fizzy drinks can count as being on it. Not so. That's called the Malnutrition Diet!  A serious overview of veganism would be aware of things like Donald Watson (who coined the term ""vegan"") being an organic grower, the vegan organic movement of today, and the Vegan Society's very careful and valuable educational history regarding the plant-only diet.

So again, this is not necesarily a film promoting veganism, but rather a film promoting one particular plant-based diet, and tailored to an audience with life-threatening conditions.

One outright quibble I have: Whereas the film rightly critiques the dairy advertising models, it falls into the use of a highly sexualized photograph after the obstacle-course footage of the athlete Lori Ann Lloyd. The pin-up picture of Lloyd should have been skipped. It calls into question Anderson's frequent use of footage of people with large bodies, and one might wonder whether Anderson's expecting people to strive for precisely the same TV model of sexual attraction that the film at other times rightly questions. Nor is the appeal to ""manliness"" and overcoming ""impotence"" needed. There are many social, psychological and physical factors in non-standard sexuality, and in a world of 6 billion humans, frankly it might be just fine if impotence were not such a constant obsession. In short, the film loses a lot of its impact by playing to people's vanity over sexual normalcy that's largely been created by the fashion industry, media, and even the pharmaceutical industry.

Anderson's work does increase the viewer's knowledgeable about the food industry, and will doubtless inspire people to learn even more.",1169078400,17,5345,5.031674208144796
