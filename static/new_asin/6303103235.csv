7837764,5,6303103235,"I love Robotech.  I watched it some on Cartoon Network's Toonami & watching it now I realize it's alot better than I remember.  In fact, I'd rank it up there with Macron 1 as my favorite giant robot anime.  But I hate the uncut versions not because of the violence but because of the nudity.  I ordered this tape before I realized they released the edited versions on the Legacy Collections.  My mistake but hey someone benefited from it.",1365465600,,438,4.493670886075949
