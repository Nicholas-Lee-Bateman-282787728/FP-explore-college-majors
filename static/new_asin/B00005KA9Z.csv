3007234,5,B00005KA9Z,"This show is a classic, the acting is sub-par and that's why i love it. I am a sucker for amateur movies but they give the best messages, this movie delivers and I am hard to make laugh but this movie delivers on all levels. A comedy about a mail man who hates dogs and come upon a dog trained for FBI. Hard, tough and no jokes at all, until a young kid with a love for dogs turns all that around. Meanwhile a group of mafioso has put a hit on this dog, this young kid, the mailman and the dog all team up and make for a great family movie to enjoy!!",1492732800,,550,3.8333333333333335

3007323,1,B00005KA9Z,"This movie relies on exploiting gender stereotypes, enabling carelessness, and I'm rating this as low as I can because of the repeated use of the R-word that was intended to be humorous, but it is always offensive.  As far as a movie, it was well-done, but whoever was in charge of language and wardrobe made this raunchy and not for kids to take after.

My 9-year old enjoyed the slapstick physical humor of this movie.  He also enjoyed the kid, the dog, and the goofy main character.  I did not enjoy having to interject throughout the movie to point out why something isn't appropriate.",1475971200,,589,4.634615384615385

3007346,5,B00005KA9Z,"Very Hilarious movie. At times in between it is boring & the Director has tried to make the Movie Long for no apparent  Reason. But in general the Bonding  of the little Boy & David Arquette as FATHER & SON is very touching to the Heart. Spot the Dog also is well played.
IN SHORT A VERY NICE COMEDY .",1474848000,,301,4.0
3007347,2,B00005KA9Z,"Good natured but very juvenile comedy that may appeal to pre-teens but offers little for adults. I doubt anyone involved lists this one on their resume.

David Arquette stepping in dog poop was disgusting and this and the other comic devices were overdone.  This could have been a funny film.

3007684,4,B00005KA9Z,"I likely would have given this DVD a 5 Star rating, (it is mostly family friendly and some parts make me laugh a lot), but I am incredibly disappointed with the music being so quiet in the pet store scene. I remember it being louder in the VHS and it is a key component to the scene; in the DVD it is like quiet background music that I can barely hear. I tried adjusting my TV audio settings, but it seems the music has been equalized by the manufacturer. Maybe it's an issue with playing the disc on a BluRay player, but then I would like the company to make a Blu-Ray disc version.

Although I don't mind, other buyers should know that the DVD case is flimsy as there is no plastic behind the disc, only the front insert and its sleeve. However, Amazon shipped my copy effectively with no damage.",1464134400,,798,4.25

3007756,4,B00005KA9Z,"This is the type of movie that went straight to video (DVD these days) when it first came out that if you come across somewhere for a couple of dollars is well worth obtaining.  It's got quite a few recognisable faces in it, the most obvious is the kid from Two and a Half Men, back when he was still a little kid. This may have even been before that show even started, as he's pretty young and doesn't have a great amount of lines, although he is in a fair few scenes obviously.

It's basic plot is about the mob trying to carry out a hit on an FBI agent, that FBI agent just happens to be a dog.  Of course the dog ends up in the back of a postal workers (Arquette) truck, who just happens to be reluctantly looking after his hot neighbour's kid who he's trying to hook up with.  This is a fish out of water type comedy with Arquette not knowing what to do with either a boy or a dog, as well as the dog being a very serious dog who has been forbidden to play his whole life but whose police instinct kick in every time he sees a crime going down.  Thrown in some Home Alone type bumbling hit men who get outwitted by the dog time and time again.  Scenes with the mother tying to call/get home are also quite funny.  The pet store scenes are the best, although cheesy they are lots of fun, don't get up to use the bathroom or anything when they arrive there.

You know what type of gags you're going to get with this type of movie but See Spot Run manages to pull them off and keep you entertained.  The start is a little slow but once the dog and encounter each other it keeps the humour and pace nicely.",1414368000,,1607,4.044164037854889

The story of a single mom needing pinch hit assistance for a few hours while the regular sitter is on her way  turns into a few days from her hopeful suitor next door, a mailman terrified of dogs.  Things soon turn into a madcap romp when a canine FBI agent targeted by the bad guy he helped to capture tries to put him off the scent, permanently.  All's well that ends well when the four legged agent winds up in the care of a temporary owner - the mailman watching out for the boy next door.

3007839,4,B00005KA9Z,"This was a very pleasant surprise; a very good comedy filled with a lot of laughs and - more surprise - not much raunch and profanity. Wow, that's unusual for today. Some people say this was strictly made for kids. Well, I am hardly a kid..... and I loved it.

All the characters in here are just that: characters, from goofy David Arquette's ""Gordon""- to the cute kid, Angus T. Jones (""James"")  to big Michael Clarke Duncan (""Murdoch"")  to pretty Leslie Bibb (""Stephanie"")  to Joe Viterelli (""Gino"")  to Anthony Anderson (""Bennie"") - to Paul Sorvino (""Sonny Talia""). Yeah, the last guy is the only one with a last name. I especially liked Viterelli and Duncan.

The film gets too silly in one spot - at the store, where the slapstick goes on way too long, but otherwise this is a funny movie. As the clich goes, fun for all ages.",1240272000,,830,4.5

I mean don't get me wrong I loved David Arquette in Ready To Rumble but this by far is a horrible and degrating movie ever. There are lots of disgusting comedy in this. With lots of poop jokes. But It is meant for a 4 year old who has a sugar level of 1000 and loves to laugh at anything it sees. Parents you shouldn't even see it if it's on a plane. IT'S THAT AWFUL,1143417600,,490,3.7211538461538463
3007846,3,B00005KA9Z,"Is SEE SPOT RUN a great movie?  NOT REALLY.  Is it entertaining?  Yes, I must admit it made me laugh quite a bit.  It's really a slapstick farce with a blonde David Arquette mugging it up like the world was coming to an end.  He plays a dog-fearing mailman who has his own devices to elude the dogs on Bleeker Street, ""Canine Alley.""  Agent 11, a canine FBI agent, is targeted by mob boss Paul Sorvino (humorously so), so he is sent to witness protection for canines in Alaska, or he's supposed to be.  A crooked agent sets 11 up, and the mob's hit men (especially funny is the late Joe Viterelli who plays mobsters with unabashed fun) go after the dog to kill him.  11 manages to escape to where else?  Arquette's mail truck, where he is instantly adored by cute little Angus T. Jones, the son of the hottie (Leslie Bibb) Arquette is mooning over.

Michael Clarke Duncan has nice moments as 11's ""partner"" who can't seem to function without the pooch in his life.  There are lots of predictable gags and even though the showdown in the pet store is incredibly goofy, it is funny.  So if it makes you laugh, it succeeds as entertainment if not a great film!",1142208000,,1157,4.380281690140845

3007851,5,B00005KA9Z,"I never went to see this movie in the cinema. It was advertised on its release as being the only movie showing the preview for 'Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone'. I figured that any movie that had to rely on _that_ sort of publicity to get an audience had to be really bad. Boy, was I wrong.
My father hired this movie out for the family to watch (him having a bizarre sense of humour, and all) and I watched it simply so he wouldn't feel bad about picking a dud movie. Well, I think we spent the next two or three weeks searching high and low for a copy to buy.
This is a very, _very_ funny movie. I think there were only two or three places in it that I wasn't laughing. Yes, it is plugged as a kid's film, and there are a couple of spots with a bit of crude toilet humour, but don't be put off by that.
See Spot Run is a laugh-a-minute movie in every sense of the word. Certain characters are over-acted to perfection (see Agent 11's handler and Mr Arquette's neurotic dog-hating character) while others are played straight with equally good results.
Possibly the best scenes in the film revolved around the demolition of a Pet Store interior, including a fish bowl, sea urchins, bubble wrap and helium, and a scene near the end where Spot rolls a single ball across the floor to the Mob boss in a very obvious taunt (he'd already bitten off one of the crook's afore-mentioned appendages).
This movie is hilarious, while also managing a touching feel-good finish. This is one film you can watch over and over, and never get sick of.",1047772800,,1541,4.354166666666667

But it is a comedy so don't expect any life lessons or teary moments cause' you won't find them in this movie.",1034812800,,378,4.338028169014085
3007853,3,B00005KA9Z,"The best part of ""See Spot Run"" is its star, but not David ""Ready to Rumble"" Arquette.  Its real star is Bob the Mastiff, who plays the role of Agent 11, the ace investigator of FBI.  At least, I found the dog is most recommendable.
Don't think about the story.  Though it seems five writers are involved, there is none that the film can be proud of.  It is basically about the relations between the dog and a boy, who is in charge of a bumbling mailman Arquette.  The plot is full of corny situations, which is concocted in order to display many physical gags.  Some of them are genuinely funny, but mostly they are made of clithe, stretched beyond our belief, and many of them are simple, traditional ones like throwing dirt into the face of unlucky passer-by, or simpler ones like so-called toilet humor.  No wonder critics disliked the film.
But there is some merits here.  Michael Clarke Duncan (the kind-hearted convict in ""The Green Mile"") is acquited, playing a chief FBI dog trainer, who loves Spot the Dog aka. Agent 11 very much.  Perhaps because his (Cleake's) good-natured character is telegraphed to us, his relation with the canine agent makes us smile.  Arquette is making full use of his body, showing slapstick turns you can think of, and some of them are funny (see his ""ET"" walk.)  But as we come to realize the pointless situation surrounding his character (Why mailman?  Why in love with Leslie Bibb?  Why a dog?  And Why a gangster Paul Sorvino?), we, I mean adults, soon get bored.
Maybe kids feel differently.  But the kids cannot be underestimated.  They know sooner or later there is other films like ""Turner and Hooch"" (though not that good, you can see  another mastiff with Tom Hanks), ""Beethoven"" and many others that feature dogs.  Until then, ""Spot"" will do.  ...",1031184000,,1796,4.662420382165605

3007855,1,B00005KA9Z,"I try to find good things in every movie by considering all the various elements involved - script, acting, music, pacing, direction, photography, etc. Sometimes, almost nothing good exists, as in the case of See Spot Run, which is a dog of a movie. Perhaps the worst thing about it is its claim of being a family movie. I doubt there is anything especially harmful in it, but I have seen R-rated gross out comedies with less emphasis on bathroom humor bodily functions. I don't think using such material has much to do with the idea that kids are more worldly than they used to be. I think it has to do with Hollywood filmmakers who are out of touch with their audience and with Roger Ebert's assertion that society's tastes seem to have fallen to the level of the whoopee cushion.
The movie's thin plot revolves around Gordon [David Arquette], a postman whom you would not want delivering your mail, and Agent 11, a dog trained by the FBI's Canine Unit. The dog is far better at his job than the postman. In fact, he's so effective that a gangster has taken out a hit on him. It seems Agent 11 has cost him $22,000,000. It has also damaged some very personal parts of his anatomy. Across town, George has fallen for his neighbor, Stephanie [Leslie Bibb], who has sensibly thwarted his advances. When she is called away on business, George gets stuck taking care of her young son, James [Angus T. Jones], after the baby-sitter doesn't show up. Meanwhile, Agent 11 makes his escape from a pair of goofy hit men, and Gordon, oblivious to the dog's dilemma, as well as to almost everything else going on around him, winds up with the clever pooch. He's stuck with a precocious kid, a dog that doesn't know how to have fun, and those inept killers. Lucky for him he's eternally clueless, I suppose.
I have rarely seen a movie with so many lost opportunities. It invariably sticks with tried and true cliches that even the average eight year old is tired of. Rather than making the effort to come up with some truly funny lines and situations, Its writers fall back on stupid jokes involving passing gas and things animals naturally do to fertilize the ground. Done once or twice, such jokes can be amusing, especially if they are unexpected. Done six or seven times, they are embarrassing for the writers since they imply that these people have limited talents and are stuck in the most infantile areas of humor. There is also a running joke about the gangster that will elude children but seem plain dumb to most adults. Only once is any event seen through the dog's eyes, though I think that Agent 11's take on things could have been quite funny. Again, the writers dropped the ball.
Arquette literally falls on his face here over and over trying to get laughs. He is never very funny. I've seen him do some good acting in the past, but this time all he proves is that he's no Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast does better with what little there is to work with.
It doesn't bother me too much that Hollywood makes so few movies for kids these days. They are deluged with too much entertainment as it is. It does bother me that, outside of animated films, Hollywood doesn't remember how to make one.",1016064000,,3196,4.521588946459413
3007856,3,B00005KA9Z,"I know, I know.  You saw the same previews that I did.  Bad Point
Number 1 is the Cute Kid.  Bad Point Number 2 is the super dog that the mob is after.  Bad Point Number 3 is the male lead...David Arquette.  Strangely though, I heard a lot of good things about it and with some trepidation fell prey to my wife's badgering and rented it this weekend.
 David Arquette is a lazy, shiftless, no-account mail man who accepts no responsibly in his life...and he hates dogs.  His biggest goal in life is to date the pretty woman who lives down the hall and if he has to be friends with her son, he will bend over backwards to be friends with her son.  He even agrees to watch the son, granted only for a couple of minutes while waiting for the baby-sitter so the woman can make it to the airport on time. Naturally the baby-sitter cancels entirely.
 Spot, or Agent 11, is the number 1 dog with the F.B.I. and the mob boss, played by Paul Sorvino, has put a hit out on Spot in retaliation for Spot's taking a bite out of...Paul.  Naturally Spot, the boy, and Arquette all end up together and found that they are a family waiting to get
together.
 When the movie started, I thought my fears would be correct.  It was slow and the plot was so unbelievably retread that I was beginning to grate my teeth in agony.  Then I fell off the couch laughing.  Then I doubled over in pain because I was laughing so hard the tears began to flow.  Yes, it is
one of the silliest movies I have ever heard of and the previews looked ridiculous.  However, it cracked both me and my wife up.  I will most probably end up adding this to the collection, though I will say that after checking the DVD version out I don't see a basis for not buying the VHS to save the money.",1012608000,,1746,4.179640718562874

Michael Clarke Duncan, Oscar Nominee, is in this film, but why? All he does is cry about not having his dog. And he does little to show that he wants the mutt back.
This movie starts out with a bang, a spoof of mafia activity, and you can tell it is all down hill from here. I have seen enough dog movies in my day to tell that this is not the type of cute, lovable animal that anyone would want back. He is a big, ugly dog that just is the center of all the torment that David Arquette can throw at him.

3241820,1,B00005KA9Z,"This movie relies on exploiting gender stereotypes, enabling carelessness, and I'm rating this as low as I can because of the repeated use of the R-word that was intended to be humorous, but it is always offensive.  As far as a movie, it was well-done, but whoever was in charge of language and wardrobe made this raunchy and not for kids to take after.

My 9-year old enjoyed the slapstick physical humor of this movie.  He also enjoyed the kid, the dog, and the goofy main character.  I did not enjoy having to interject throughout the movie to point out why something isn't appropriate.",1475971200,,589,4.634615384615385

David Arquette stepping in dog poop was disgusting and this and the other comic devices were overdone.  This could have been a funny film.

3242181,4,B00005KA9Z,"I likely would have given this DVD a 5 Star rating, (it is mostly family friendly and some parts make me laugh a lot), but I am incredibly disappointed with the music being so quiet in the pet store scene. I remember it being louder in the VHS and it is a key component to the scene; in the DVD it is like quiet background music that I can barely hear. I tried adjusting my TV audio settings, but it seems the music has been equalized by the manufacturer. Maybe it's an issue with playing the disc on a BluRay player, but then I would like the company to make a Blu-Ray disc version.

Although I don't mind, other buyers should know that the DVD case is flimsy as there is no plastic behind the disc, only the front insert and its sleeve. However, Amazon shipped my copy effectively with no damage.",1464134400,,798,4.25

3242253,4,B00005KA9Z,"This is the type of movie that went straight to video (DVD these days) when it first came out that if you come across somewhere for a couple of dollars is well worth obtaining.  It's got quite a few recognisable faces in it, the most obvious is the kid from Two and a Half Men, back when he was still a little kid. This may have even been before that show even started, as he's pretty young and doesn't have a great amount of lines, although he is in a fair few scenes obviously.

It's basic plot is about the mob trying to carry out a hit on an FBI agent, that FBI agent just happens to be a dog.  Of course the dog ends up in the back of a postal workers (Arquette) truck, who just happens to be reluctantly looking after his hot neighbour's kid who he's trying to hook up with.  This is a fish out of water type comedy with Arquette not knowing what to do with either a boy or a dog, as well as the dog being a very serious dog who has been forbidden to play his whole life but whose police instinct kick in every time he sees a crime going down.  Thrown in some Home Alone type bumbling hit men who get outwitted by the dog time and time again.  Scenes with the mother tying to call/get home are also quite funny.  The pet store scenes are the best, although cheesy they are lots of fun, don't get up to use the bathroom or anything when they arrive there.

You know what type of gags you're going to get with this type of movie but See Spot Run manages to pull them off and keep you entertained.  The start is a little slow but once the dog and encounter each other it keeps the humour and pace nicely.",1414368000,,1607,4.044164037854889

It's really a slapstick farce with a blonde David Arquette mugging it up like the world was coming to an end.  He plays a dog-fearing mailman who has his own devices to elude the dogs on Bleeker Street, ""Canine Alley.""  Agent 11, a canine FBI agent, is targeted by mob boss Paul Sorvino (humorously so), so he is sent to witness protection for canines in Alaska, or he's supposed to be.  A crooked agent sets 11 up, and the mob's hit men (especially funny is the late Joe Viterelli who plays mobsters with unabashed fun) go after the dog to kill him.  11 manages to escape to where else?  Arquette's mail truck, where he is instantly adored by cute little Angus T. Jones, the son of the hottie (Leslie Bibb) Arquette is mooning over.

Michael Clarke Duncan has nice moments as 11's ""partner"" who can't seem to function without the pooch in his life.  There are lots of predictable gags and even though the showdown in the pet store is incredibly goofy, it is funny.  So if it makes you laugh, it succeeds as entertainment if not a great film!",1142208000,,1157,4.380281690140845

3242348,5,B00005KA9Z,"I never went to see this movie in the cinema. It was advertised on its release as being the only movie showing the preview for 'Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone'. I figured that any movie that had to rely on _that_ sort of publicity to get an audience had to be really bad. Boy, was I wrong.
My father hired this movie out for the family to watch (him having a bizarre sense of humour, and all) and I watched it simply so he wouldn't feel bad about picking a dud movie. Well, I think we spent the next two or three weeks searching high and low for a copy to buy.
This is a very, _very_ funny movie. I think there were only two or three places in it that I wasn't laughing. Yes, it is plugged as a kid's film, and there are a couple of spots with a bit of crude toilet humour, but don't be put off by that.
See Spot Run is a laugh-a-minute movie in every sense of the word. Certain characters are over-acted to perfection (see Agent 11's handler and Mr Arquette's neurotic dog-hating character) while others are played straight with equally good results.
Possibly the best scenes in the film revolved around the demolition of a Pet Store interior, including a fish bowl, sea urchins, bubble wrap and helium, and a scene near the end where Spot rolls a single ball across the floor to the Mob boss in a very obvious taunt (he'd already bitten off one of the crook's afore-mentioned appendages).
This movie is hilarious, while also managing a touching feel-good finish. This is one film you can watch over and over, and never get sick of.",1047772800,,1541,4.354166666666667

3242350,3,B00005KA9Z,"The best part of ""See Spot Run"" is its star, but not David ""Ready to Rumble"" Arquette.  Its real star is Bob the Mastiff, who plays the role of Agent 11, the ace investigator of FBI.  At least, I found the dog is most recommendable.
Don't think about the story.  Though it seems five writers are involved, there is none that the film can be proud of.  It is basically about the relations between the dog and a boy, who is in charge of a bumbling mailman Arquette.  The plot is full of corny situations, which is concocted in order to display many physical gags.  Some of them are genuinely funny, but mostly they are made of clithe, stretched beyond our belief, and many of them are simple, traditional ones like throwing dirt into the face of unlucky passer-by, or simpler ones like so-called toilet humor.  No wonder critics disliked the film.
But there is some merits here.  Michael Clarke Duncan (the kind-hearted convict in ""The Green Mile"") is acquited, playing a chief FBI dog trainer, who loves Spot the Dog aka. Agent 11 very much.  Perhaps because his (Cleake's) good-natured character is telegraphed to us, his relation with the canine agent makes us smile.  Arquette is making full use of his body, showing slapstick turns you can think of, and some of them are funny (see his ""ET"" walk.)  But as we come to realize the pointless situation surrounding his character (Why mailman?  Why in love with Leslie Bibb?  Why a dog?  And Why a gangster Paul Sorvino?), we, I mean adults, soon get bored.
Maybe kids feel differently.  But the kids cannot be underestimated.  They know sooner or later there is other films like ""Turner and Hooch"" (though not that good, you can see  another mastiff with Tom Hanks), ""Beethoven"" and many others that feature dogs.  Until then, ""Spot"" will do.  ...",1031184000,,1796,4.662420382165605

Just watch the movie. I watched it twice the same day, so it must be good.",1016323200,,378,3.986842105263158
3242352,1,B00005KA9Z,"I try to find good things in every movie by considering all the various elements involved - script, acting, music, pacing, direction, photography, etc. Sometimes, almost nothing good exists, as in the case of See Spot Run, which is a dog of a movie. Perhaps the worst thing about it is its claim of being a family movie. I doubt there is anything especially harmful in it, but I have seen R-rated gross out comedies with less emphasis on bathroom humor bodily functions. I don't think using such material has much to do with the idea that kids are more worldly than they used to be. I think it has to do with Hollywood filmmakers who are out of touch with their audience and with Roger Ebert's assertion that society's tastes seem to have fallen to the level of the whoopee cushion.
The movie's thin plot revolves around Gordon [David Arquette], a postman whom you would not want delivering your mail, and Agent 11, a dog trained by the FBI's Canine Unit. The dog is far better at his job than the postman. In fact, he's so effective that a gangster has taken out a hit on him. It seems Agent 11 has cost him $22,000,000. It has also damaged some very personal parts of his anatomy. Across town, George has fallen for his neighbor, Stephanie [Leslie Bibb], who has sensibly thwarted his advances. When she is called away on business, George gets stuck taking care of her young son, James [Angus T. Jones], after the baby-sitter doesn't show up. Meanwhile, Agent 11 makes his escape from a pair of goofy hit men, and Gordon, oblivious to the dog's dilemma, as well as to almost everything else going on around him, winds up with the clever pooch. He's stuck with a precocious kid, a dog that doesn't know how to have fun, and those inept killers. Lucky for him he's eternally clueless, I suppose.
I have rarely seen a movie with so many lost opportunities. It invariably sticks with tried and true cliches that even the average eight year old is tired of. Rather than making the effort to come up with some truly funny lines and situations, Its writers fall back on stupid jokes involving passing gas and things animals naturally do to fertilize the ground. Done once or twice, such jokes can be amusing, especially if they are unexpected. Done six or seven times, they are embarrassing for the writers since they imply that these people have limited talents and are stuck in the most infantile areas of humor. There is also a running joke about the gangster that will elude children but seem plain dumb to most adults. Only once is any event seen through the dog's eyes, though I think that Agent 11's take on things could have been quite funny. Again, the writers dropped the ball.
Arquette literally falls on his face here over and over trying to get laughs. He is never very funny. I've seen him do some good acting in the past, but this time all he proves is that he's no Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast does better with what little there is to work with.
It doesn't bother me too much that Hollywood makes so few movies for kids these days. They are deluged with too much entertainment as it is. It does bother me that, outside of animated films, Hollywood doesn't remember how to make one.",1016064000,,3196,4.521588946459413

Number 1 is the Cute Kid.  Bad Point Number 2 is the super dog that the mob is after.  Bad Point Number 3 is the male lead...David Arquette.  Strangely though, I heard a lot of good things about it and with some trepidation fell prey to my wife's badgering and rented it this weekend.
 David Arquette is a lazy, shiftless, no-account mail man who accepts no responsibly in his life...and he hates dogs.  His biggest goal in life is to date the pretty woman who lives down the hall and if he has to be friends with her son, he will bend over backwards to be friends with her son.  He even agrees to watch the son, granted only for a couple of minutes while waiting for the baby-sitter so the woman can make it to the airport on time. Naturally the baby-sitter cancels entirely.
 Spot, or Agent 11, is the number 1 dog with the F.B.I. and the mob boss, played by Paul Sorvino, has put a hit out on Spot in retaliation for Spot's taking a bite out of...Paul.  Naturally Spot, the boy, and Arquette all end up together and found that they are a family waiting to get
together.
 When the movie started, I thought my fears would be correct.  It was slow and the plot was so unbelievably retread that I was beginning to grate my teeth in agony.  Then I fell off the couch laughing.  Then I doubled over in pain because I was laughing so hard the tears began to flow.  Yes, it is
one of the silliest movies I have ever heard of and the previews looked ridiculous.  However, it cracked both me and my wife up.  I will most probably end up adding this to the collection, though I will say that after checking the DVD version out I don't see a basis for not buying the VHS to save the money.",1012608000,,1746,4.179640718562874
3242354,5,B00005KA9Z,"This movie is great!! I loved to plot: A mail carrier in his twenties is in love with a girl living next to his apartment. (Who happens to be played by Mandy Moore.) He tries to impress her by taking care of her son, James, while she's away. He ""accidentally"" gives James a dog that also belongs to the FBI. What should he do? Take away the dog and make James hate him, or let him keep it and possibly make his girlfriend mad? You'll see what happens in this REALLY FUNNY movie if you get it. It's well worth the money!",1011139200,,519,4.098039215686274

This tells the story of an idiot who befriends a dog. (...) If you are thinking about having triple by-pass surgery for fun one night, I would suggest that you eat a lardy cheeseburger before it, to try and complicate the process. That experience is more fun than watching this movie.",1006992000,,415,4.333333333333333

I was hoping for the same in this movie, and was sadly disappointed.  The best thing about this movie is the dog.  The dog was great.  The rest of the movie unfortunately was not.  A waste of good talent.",999302400,,317,4.183333333333334

It one of thoughs family films that parents will like too. Some parents will sit there and pray for it to be over. Not this one, it's great for kids and adults. Not to be missed if you're looking for a great laugh.",998956800,,353,4.057142857142857
3242361,5,B00005KA9Z,"The initial reviews I read about this movie when it came out were not very positive and so I wasn't planning on seeing it in the theater.  A good friend of mine invited me to go along with him and his family and kids and so I decided it would be fun to go just to hang out with them.
I was so glad I went.  I laughed sooooo hard!  Then I invited my friend Matt to go and we went and laughed our brains out some more.  I actually saw the movie again after that and it was just as funny as the first time.  I like good slapstick and ""stupid"" humor and this one just nailed me on both ends.  It had a little bit of everything in it; action, humor, romance, did I mention humor (hehehe).  I will most certainly buy the DVD when it's available and have fun watching this one over again.
Not only is the movie funny, but it promotes family values and is great for kids and adults alike.  Highly recommended no matter your age range.  Good stuff!  Rare to see something really funny and entertaining from Hollywood that doesn't leave you feeling crappy after walking out of the theater.  You'll be smiling all the way.  :)",996278400,,1115,4.158878504672897

I would have gave I at least four stars if I just didn't have one scene where this guy falls in dog poo. It also has some bad acting in it, like some of the people look nerveous in front of the camera. Besides that it is a great movie that is good for the entire family.",985996800,,352,3.888888888888889
3242365,1,B00005KA9Z,"See Spot Run has to be the most unintelligent movie I have seen since the Sixth Sense. This movie is just a reason to have David Arquette run around being a spastic idiot for and hour and a half. The real stumper here is why the dog is the best actor in the film. Michael Clarke Duncan, Oscar Nominee, is in this film, but why? All he does is cry about not having his dog. And he does little to show that he wants the mutt back.
This movie starts out with a bang, a spoof of mafia activity, and you can tell it is all down hill from here. I have seen enough dog movies in my day to tell that this is not the type of cute, lovable animal that anyone would want back. He is a big, ugly dog that just is the center of all the torment that David Arquette can throw at him.
I feel sorry for anyone in this movie, and more importantly to anyone who had to see this movie. I saw it for free, but i can still complain. It is bad. Kids will not like it, they will even think it is juvenile and unfunny. Give me Turner and Hooch anyday.",985305600,,1026,3.8904761904761904
