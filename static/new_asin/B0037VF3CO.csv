It does accept Jewish,Mixed background as one former member who is part Native American explains,I still think NG should focus less on social issues and problems and gangs and more on what they are known for.",1287360000,3,711,5.033898305084746

This work speaks about the prison gang Aryan Brotherhood.  It goes by AB for short.  It said that although only 1 of 1,000 federal inmates is a member, they are involved in 20% of prison crime.  I would never, ever watch shows on Nazis or Klansmen, but because I am fascinated by prison shows like ""Lockup Raw"" or ""Oz,"" I could bear this.

I kept wondering why an AB member was wearing a Native American choker if the group supposedly promotes white power.  It was later explained that the interviewee was a former member and had some Native ancestry.  That interviewee stated that while racism plays a role in AB, the gang's criminal activities is the emphasis.  The narrator stated that AB has biracial and Jewish members, including one founder sporting a Star of David tattoo.  The works focuses on similar topics from other prison shows: drug sales, shank attacks, revenge killings.  Thus, I could push aside the yucky hatred stuff and listen to those other matters instead.

I knew about lightning bolts, but the documentary says shamrocks are an AB symbol.  One interviewee said an inmate of Irish ancestry, but not an AB member, would have to rid himself of shamrock tattoos.  Again, though the work spoke of racism, when they showed a visitor bringing in drugs during a visit, it sure seemed like it was a multiracial conspiracy that was recorded on camera.  Many of the members seemed to sport bushy mustaches, but the narrator never explains why that is.

The work stated that AB did not start outside of prison, unlike other gangs.  However outside dynamics are emphasized here.  It is stressed that gang members can easily communicate with fellow gang members many time zones away.  It demonstrates the gang's written code and if you are intrigued by the Rosetta Stone and its ilk, you will be amazed by that.

This work focuses on California.  As many prison shows state, it says race divisions are big in prisons.  However, I know an inmate in Kentucky who said race does not overpower things.  He said there are inmates of different races in cells and that crossracial friendships are not punished.",1285977600,2,2206,4.762532981530343
