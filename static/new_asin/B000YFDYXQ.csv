8232569,5,B000YFDYXQ,"Albert Rudolph was a spiritual adept, and the proprietor of an Asian art gallery in Greenwich Village (NYC) during the 1960s and early 1970s. He made many journeys to India where he studied with various gurus, most notably Swami Muktananda. Swami Nityananda seemed to have the most influence on him, although he only met him once. He began teaching classes in the basement of his gallery, eventually becoming a guru himself, Swami Rudrananda or Rudi.

This brief film may be the only known video footage of Rudi. It starts out with him giving a talk to his students prior to the arrival of Swami Muktananda to the U.S. for the first time. One statement he made that stuck with me was ""If we didn't have garbage, we'd have nothing to burn. We wouldn't grow spiritually."" (Garbage referring here to negative patterns of thought and behavior). He then leads the group in meditation. He meditates with his eyes open, and has powerful kriyas (spasms caused by excess energy).

Next we see Swami Muktananda's arrival at the airport, where his limo is covered in flowers, and at Rudi's ashram in upstate New York, where he is greeted by chanting students. A nice segment is included where Rudi leads a group of students up a hill, and they all sit down in a meadow while he gives a discourse on kundalini yoga and other topics. It would be easy to imagine a scene like this occuring in India 2500 years ago with the Shakyamuni Buddha giving the talk.

For me, the most powerful part of the film is when Rudi gives energetic transmissions (shaktipat) to some of his students. Some go into spasms, others pass out or start crying. There are a number of people laying down on the grass, overwhelmed by the experience. While this footage is shown, the audio of one his talks plays in the background.

Although the film itself is only about 30 minutes in length, numerous bonus special features are included, such as a director's commentary, a number of additional short films including a trip to a reservoir with Mukatananda and Ram Dass, several narrated slide shows of pictures, a short with rare footage of Swami Nityananda, and additional audio files that can be played on a computer. The packaging for the DVD is quite nice, and includes Rudi's biography.

This DVD is clearly a labor of love by some of his devotees, and the care that they put into it is evident. Although Rudi died at a young age, he still seems to have a powerful influence on those whose lives he touched. It would have been interesting if a ""where are they now?"" piece had been included on some of his students, especially those that continued the teaching, which it appears that there are several of. Definitely worth viewing for the spiritually inclined in general, and especially those interested in the guru movement of the 1970s.",1331942400,6,2800,4.706122448979592
8232570,5,B000YFDYXQ,Rudi was/is an amazing teacher. This documentary is a labor of love and gives some amazing footage to cherish forever.,1317772800,,118,4.95
8232571,5,B000YFDYXQ,"What a great collection! Rudi was a remarkable teacher who's work touched thousands.  He visited me in a dream, some months before I met him. You have to be a Master of extraordinary quality to pull off a trick like that on the Astral Plane. His Samadhi came much too early (for me). This DVD is a great introduction to his Work in the Kundalini/Tantric tradition.",1228262400,5,364,4.515151515151516
8232572,5,B000YFDYXQ,Highly recommended!  I purchased this for research purposes while I was writing a Wikipedia article for Albert Rudolph (Rudi).,1213920000,,126,5.631578947368421
8232573,5,B000YFDYXQ,"This is a beautifully produced audio and video DVD of a remarkable teacher, Swami Rudrananda, known as ""Rudi.""  Rudi's loving and fierce energy comes through in a clear and present way.  The extras on the disc are inspiring also. I loved it!

(Not noted on the DVD was the fact that Rudi completely separated from  Muktananda, after the events depicted in this video.)",1208822400,,368,4.7936507936507935
8232574,5,B000YFDYXQ,"I pre-ordered the Rudi DVD and was delighted to find the producers had included some bonus audio footage from the dedication of a San-Francisco Meditation Center.

I was just listening on the subway to the talk and Rudi characterizes the work of meditation as like a river of spiritual energy where people can come and quench their thirst.

What I kept thinking about over and over again after that was the part just a bit later in the recording where Rudi actually walks you through in some detail how to open not superficially like a rock on the bottom of this river, but very deeply.

This is just to recommend the /bonus/ audio footage available on this DVD. All of the rare and meticulously restored video footage from the 70's comes alive with rich and vibrant color. For a person who was born mostly after all of this occurred, this is title is a rare and wonderful treasure.",1197849600,9,882,4.569620253164557

This is about the spiritual work that makes a difference.  The results last and deeper satisfaction occurs the longer you use the techniques.  With this experiencing God is ecstatic and very real.  I lived with Swami Rudrananda's teacher in India.  Nothing is held back here.  No BS is used to make it artificially pretty.  Few films are this candid.  Those practitioners who want more fire in their development should watch this DVD.  For the non initiated this DVD will provide a journey of wonder.",1196899200,16,694,6.387096774193548
