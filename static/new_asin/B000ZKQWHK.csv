3042305,5,B000ZKQWHK,"If you're any fan of Bollywood, OM SHANTI OM is sure to entertain the bejeesus out of you. This movie is joyful and extravagant and at times very funny. It tells of love and revenge, and of reincarnation and redemption. There's also a bit of film industry spoofing going on. This is only Farah Khan's second turn at directing (after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Main-Hoon-Na/dp/B000LXSAIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Main Hoon Na</a>, yet another must-see cinema), but she already shows signs of becoming a great director. Certainly she knows how to tell a story, although, to be honest, in this instance, the story is overshadowed by the spectacle. Despite some tragic and somber moments in the plot, OM SHANTI OM remains overwhelmingly a display of sheer, rowdy exuberance. It's a party caught on film.

Plot SPOILERS now.

It's Bollywood in the 1970s. Om Prakash Makhija (Shahrukh Khan) is a lowly, aspiring actor (or ""junior artist""), whose resume, at this stage, consists of taking on gigs as an extra in films. He is seriously crushing on reigning Bollywood queen Shantipriya (Deepika Padukone), with whose billboard image he often converses. Om's dream comes true one day when he gets to meet Shanti, and even ends up saving her life. But Om then stumbles on a secret which makes any notion of romance with Shanti an impossibility.

Things take a turn to the sinister when Shanti perishes in a fire deliberately caused by a shady movie producer (Arjun Rampal), and Om, in a desperate bid to rescue her, soon after passes away from grievious wounds. But, nearby, in fact in the same hospital, as Om takes his last breath, the baby son of a famous actor is born. And the baby's name happens to be Om. You see where this is going, right?

30 years later, Om Kapoor (again Shahrukh Khan) has followed in his father's footsteps and has himself become a celluloid superstar. But his priveleged status has gone to his head, making him into a spoiled and selfish brat. Om also loses some street cred with his underwhelming brand of cussing, which mostly consists of ""Oh, fish!"" And, mysteriously, he's had a fear of fire all his life. Events unfold to at last make Om recall his past life even as he prepares to make a film, under the patronage of a shady movie producer (yes, that same one from 30 years ago). Then a bubblegum chewing girl named Sandy enters Om's life. Sandy is a huge fan of his and bears a striking resemblance to Shanti. And, suddenly, Om sees a way in which his beloved Shanti's death can be avenged...

SPOILERS end.

Bow down to this blockbuster picture if you, in any shape or form, are hooked into Bollywood, and, specifically, into the 1970s Indian film industry. OM SHANTI OM is simultaneously a fond sendup and a wry homage of that wild and wooly era. For one thing, if you go way back to those days, then you'll enjoy that bit of fun with 1970s actor Manoj Kumar (although, reportedly, Kumar himself wasn't too enthused with all the ribbing). If you pay attention, you might even learn how Govinda might possibly have gotten his screen name. Myself, since I've started watching Bollywood only about two years ago, I'm sure many inside jokes flew by unrecognized, over my head and unappreciated.

OM SHANTI OM reunites Shahrukh Khan and director Farah Khan (MAIN HOON NA and other films), and these two are undeniably the wellspring of the film's energy, enthusiasm, and vision. The general feel here is one of good-natured boisterousness, yet Shahrukh and Farah keep this ship steady and on course. The feel-good nostalgia is tempered by enough contemporary touches in the second half of the film, so that even the younger generations are kept engaged. Fair warning, though, if you haven't seen any (or a lot) of Bollywood cinema, OM SHANTI OM just may overload your senses and sensibilities.

It's near 3 hours long, and packed with many wonderful moments. As when Om first gets a chance to talk to Shanti but is so flabbergasted he can only make weird faces and funny noises; this, even as his voice-over reflects his elegant but unsaid responses to Shanti's questions. Then there's Om pretending to be a big movie star and then having to put on an act when Shanti comes to visit his set. And those are just two in a busload of memorable scenes. The film does tend to bog down post-intermission, but, still, the second half has its share of highlight bits. Unmissable is the whole Filmfare Awards sequence, which had me rolling on the floor and revealed what good sports Abhishek Bachchan and Akshay Kumar truly are. This is followed by an all-star afterparty as Om's pals in the movie biz show up to help him celebrate (this is the portion of the film where you play ""Spot that Bollywood Star!""). Shahrukh pokes fun at himself with the two suspiciously similar ""movies"" he's nominated for in Filmfare. And, for the ladies, the musical number ""Dard-e-Disco"" showcases Shahrukh's rockhard abs, which, rumor has it, he'd worked on for 3 months. Me, being a manly man, I shrugged at the newly buff Shahrukh (while bitterly drowning in envy, of course).

Oh, man, the sets, the sets, the opulent sets. I don't know how much it cost to finance this film, but it was well worth it. The set designs are spectacular, especially the 1970s film studios, before and after the devastating fire. The awesomely garish costumes and hair styles simply evoke that era, even as you grin at the kitschiness of it all. Most of the songs rock, from the sweet ""Ajab Si"" to the hauntingly melodious ""Main Agar Kahoon."" The wonderful ""Dhoom Taana"" is evocative of the tunes churned out back in the day (the song's set pieces incorporate pirates, the cabaret, tennis and also, thru special effects, 1970s stars Amrapali, Jay Vijay, and Saccha Jhoota). ""Dard-e-Disco"" is an item number, with Shahrukh himself, abs and all, as the ""item girl"" on display (Farah Khan calls him that). The showstopper, of course, is ""Deewangi Deewangi"" in which 30 Bollywood big names pop in and boogie down with Shahrukh (""All the hot girls put your hands up and say Om Shanti Om..."").

It's almost impossible not to have fun when you make a movie like this. The actors must've had a blast. More importantly, they were good. Deepika Padukone is a star in the making. This is the former model's debut film in Bollywood, and she's tall and gorgeous and is engaging as the sad Shanti and, later, as the klutzy Sandy. Also a former model, Arjun Rampal's acting hasn't impressed me in the past. But, here, as the conniving movie director Mukesh Mehra, he lands possibly his best role. He's surprisingly effective as the villain, in spite of that tacky little foo-foo mustache. Kirron Kher is also memorable as the melodramatic mom. As for Shahrukh Khan - reliably over-the-top yet magnificent and poignant for all that - the guy owns this movie. Even in his goofiest moments, he never loses that charm. There's a reason Shahrukh is one of the (if not THE) most sought after actor in Bollywood.

Eros International pulled out the stops with this dvd packaging, too. There are two dvds in this set, and they come in this oversized, very cool protective box. The first disc has the movie, the song selections, and the Director's Commentary (taped while Farah Khan was lying in bed, 6 or 7 months pregnant). The second disc has 2 and a half hours of extravagant bonus features: the pretty thorough Making of OSO; the Making of the Songs (sorry, I always find this segment boring); the not-very-serious (and occasionally annoying) interview with SRK, Arjun Rampal, Deepika Padukone & Farah Khan; Bloopers; Visual Effects (interesting for the ""Dhoom Taana"" segment); OSO Events - worth watching for the Music Launch, the Fashion Show, the London Premiere, and the Special Screening (where you get other actors' reactions); and an OSO Trivia Game. The best part (for me, anyway) is that most of this stuff is sub-titled in English. There's also a booklet with Cast & Crew bios and a poster of Shahrukh and his abs and his autograph.

Bollywood hasn't been exactly shy about producing movies with a reincarnation theme. But OM SHANTI OM may be the most buoyant and feel-good of them all, despite the dark supernatural element which creeps in. The plot, admittedly, is mediocre and rehashed, so we're pretty much on automatic when it comes to the storyline. The fun, instead, lies in soaking in the nostalgia and the gentle lampooning, the glorious absurdity and even the friendly self-indulgence of the film. Then there's also the tons of cameo appearances. Inspired by a warmth for the past and crafted with skill and heart and imagination, it's very hard not to be swayed over. OM SHANTI OM is a celebration of Bollywood. And, really, why even fight it? Wallow in the film, man, wallow!",1208390400,40,8806,4.8360982083609825
3042306,5,B000ZKQWHK,"This spectacle of colours and sounds is like a celebration of Bollywood with its crme de la crme cast and crew, and a story set in the Indian film industry spanning 30 years of classic and cult movies.  As such, this film cannot fail to stir the hearts of most Indians and lovers of Bollywood, but its appeal can reach much further beyond its domestic arena because of its high production standards and personnel of international acclaim.  The two most famous names in ""Om Shanti Om"" are Shahrukh Khan, one of India's most talented and versatile actors, and the film's scriptwriter, choreographer and director, Farah Khan, who has also earned many local and international awards for her outstanding productions.  The two Khans (not related) have already worked together successfully on several big hit movies, and ""Om Shanti Om"" is yet another step along this fantastic journey into semi-fantasy, escapism and sheer delight for the senses.  Although technically a Bollywood standard production of nearly three hours in length with about eight song and dance scenes throughout, ""Om Shanti Om"" is in fact many films in one as it embraces three decades of Indian films.  A basically simple story is very effectively woven through this film industry history, mixing a tragic drama with the unreal world of show business while making fun of its own industry by overplaying the sentimental tones of many classic Indian films.  For this reason alone, a general knowledge and feel for Bollywood would help the viewer to appreciate and understand these playful yet respectful tributes to Indian cinema.  Yet the story itself already makes for general entertaining viewing, and the high-profile stars, brilliant music and choreography, as well as lavish sets make this film stand out from the rest.

The first half of the film is set in the 1970s, complete with garish fashions and cars, big hair and sideburns, and even nauseating Seventies wallpaper, as we watch a young studio extra trying to get closer to the beautiful, famous actress he is in love with, when suddenly tragedy strikes.  But true to Hindu traditional belief, his soul is reincarnated that very instant into a newborn baby so that 30 years later - in our present day - when he finally remembers his past life, he can mete out justice and revenge on the evil perpetrator who took the life of his beloved three decades ago, but not without a nice little twist at the end.  A lot of work went into making the sets, especially those with an authentic 1970s look and feel, and even the songs and music in the first part of the film are in the style of Bollywood's Seventies films.  Some Bollywood cult figures are also comically represented, but many are also internationally recognizable or are very similar to Western and Hollywood characters and movies, such as a parody of India's Filmfare Awards:  Bollywood's Academy Awards, at which everyone who is anyone in Bollywood makes at least a two second appearance in their most typical and best recognized role or personality.  For viewers not up on Bollywood's Who's Who, the second disc in this set might be helpful with nearly three hours of ""the Making of..."" complete with interviews, bloopers, deleted scenes, audience comments, interactive trivia quiz and much more, all with English subtitles.  A nice, colourful booklet also has a brief summary of cast and crew which serves as a nice introduction to get acquainted with Bollywood, and the medium-sized, autographed poster of a bare-chested Shahrukh Khan in a sexy pose is also an added bonus in this set.  In fact, in recent times the EROS label s been producing ever bigger and more lavish box sets with more bonus material, and ""Om Shanti Om"" is the biggest one so far, and therefore worth a little extra money.  Watching this top-notch Bollywood production is like taking a fun ride at an amusement park with all its sounds and colours to create the perfect escape from the real world for a few hours, and then makes you want to come back for more.",1206835200,63,4017,4.8766519823788546

After researching a bit about the film online, the context and jokes made much more sense, and I liked the film so much more.

3042381,5,B000ZKQWHK,"I feel lucky to stumble on this movie while desperately searching for anything different to watch. I am a huge movie fan and very happy that amazon made this available for us since at this moment netflix is only offering with dvd option.
Of course, reaching to Bollywood movies is a bit problematic since I am not Indian and do not speak Hindi and cannot make sense of them unless there is a subtitle. They should be more accessible for the rest of the world : )
I found this movie very entertaining, heart warming, and encouraging (to follow one's dreams). It is funny at times and a little bit satiric (of older film industry in India). Picture quality, costumes, rich colors, dances -not over done and cheesier with a purpose- all comes together beautifully. It does not give the impression of a redo of a particular Hollywood movie but I kept thinking about the chandelier scene from the Phantom of Opera. However, overall, it seems like they owned every aspect of the plot, which includes reincarnation of the main character to give very simple and sweet messages such as: If you want something in life with all your heart, the universe will help you to obtain it.  Nobody gets away with a bad deed.
I do not think this movie is based on Shah Rukh Khan's struggle in his journey to stardom in real life, however, Om's different lives  pokes fun at unfairness of life or old Bollywood film industry specifically where having certain connections makes life easier even for a lazy/untalented/stupid/spoiled person. I like this aspect of new trend in the Bollywood movies: They are getting more complicated and more universal while they are not giving up their traditional themes or some of the old Bollywood movie signatures. Of course, it is always fun to watch Shah Rukh Khan dancing in traditional or semi-traditional Indian outfits, trying to do the right thing (not much fan of him when he is a villain), following his heart, serenading his lover, being such an Indian gentleman, etc.",1408579200,7,1991,4.7514450867052025

I saw my first few movies Bollywood films lately (3 idiots being one of them) and got turned me onto this market.

What was less enjoyable for me about this movie was the many dance scenes. It seemed they were as many dance scenes as actual acting scenes. Personally, I prefer the acting with a few dances thrown in. I almost didn't finish the movie, but thanks to fast forward got through several of the dance scenes that I was bored with.

I read some of the other reviews here, and I have no doubt...to someone with full appreciation of the dance and Bollywood history, this probably is a five star film. But for me, I have to give it 3 stars due to its length and IMHO excessive dance scenes.",1388102400,,802,4.34

3042445,4,B000ZKQWHK,"Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's ""Om Shanti Om"" is, in a nutshell, a Bollywood film about Bollywood, with nods to the nostalgic 1970s disco era.  Choreographer-turned-director Farah Khan (her second movie as director) knows what she is doing when shirtless Shah Rukh Khan dances with scantily clad dancers. This is cinematic eye candy, with a good guy falling in love with a damsel-in-distress. And don't forget a bad guy.

The film starts out as a light-hearted romantic comedy about Om Prakash Makhija (Shah Rukh Khan), an unknown actor dreaming of becoming a big star, under the studio system of the 1970s Bollywood film industry. He falls in love an upcoming star Shantipriya (Deepika Padukone in her debut). Without revealing too much about the rest of the film, the story takes a dark turn when Om Prakash Makhija learns the starlet's secret.

Because the story of ""Om Shanti Om"" takes place in movie industry, the film is filled with many cameo roles by well-known actors (don't miss the party scene) as well as the film's director Farah Khan herself and producer Gauri Khan (wife of the star Shah Rukh Khan). Indian cinema fans will also enjoy the numerous 70s pop culture references.

But you don't need special knowledge about the film's cultural background to enjoy its joyful dancing and music. The story is thin and drawn out, but the colorful film delivers the goods.",1365984000,,1385,4.931330472103005

The picture shows the ""Collector's Edition"" 2-DVD set with autographed poster. What you may get is one ""Movie-on-Demand"" DVD, not packaged as the collector's edition, and no poster.

His dream came true when he was reincarnated as a star.  Bollywood makes all things possible, especially in Mr Khans movies.  The glamour in the movies with costumes, dancing and architecture is a feast to the senses.  I love watching them and wish Amazon would feature more of them I heard he has more than 70 movies.

The songs are as stellar as some of the best Hindi songs out there, and there's a good variety of sad, slow, and upbeat songs that will have you putting your hands up and saying ""Om Shanti Om"".

There are a couple of points I liked about the movie. It made charming references to several Bollywood films and actors of the past. It had great costumes, and songs, as I've already said. The plot is pretty original, and connects back to the concept of reincarnation that's popular among Indians. And, unlike a lot of other recent Hindi films, it doesn't try too hard and turn out to be a wannabe American movie. These days, many Hindi directors opt to make movies with very Westernized themes, with the actors speaking in English at least half the time and hardly showing any sign of being Indian aside from their name, if anything. Om Shanti Om, on the other hand, complements Indian culture very well while still being edgy for a contemporary audience.

I just thought that a couple of scenes were a little cheesy, although I should have expected that to come along with a Bollywood movie. The other little complaint I had was that in the second half of the movie, while some characters had reincarnated, others were apparently still living the exact same lives as before as if nothing happened to them in 30 years. I realize the directors didn't let anything happen to those characters just for the sake of consistency, but it was a little ridiculous to see some of the supporting actors with the same exact lifestyle and physique, just a little graying hair, when we are supposed to believe 30 years had passed.",1308009600,,1695,4.627906976744186

3042500,5,B000ZKQWHK,"I love Bollywood films in general, but this one - Om Shanti Om - enriches the usual content of drama and dance with a tongue in cheek parody of movies and movie-making, with Bollywood and Shah Rukh Khan bearing most of the brunt of the wit.  The plot is a clever two-parter, in which our hero, Om, a low-level bit player in the first half, dies and is reborn into the second as a mega star.  Director/writer/choreographer Farah Khan has crafted a satisfying web of love and loss, murder and justice, death and rebirth, laced through with film cliches.  And who but Shah Rukh Khan could carry off delivering a line like, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,"" to a male co-star (the villain of the piece, Arjun Rampal)?  Shah Rukh's characterizations are superb, from overacting the drunken acceptance of an imitation award in the first part to portraying a self-centered superstar in the second, who alternates constantly grabbing his own crotch with insisting on a dance number in a film, although the wheelchair-bound character he's playing is deaf, dumb and blind, and has lost both hands and feet.  The resulting Darde Disco number pushes music video cliches to their extreme.  There are fires and a falling chandelier a la Phantom of the Opera, and an award show at which the superstar Om is nominated for two best actor awards for playing exactly the same part in two different movies - only his co-star and the color of his sweater change in the clips.  Even motherhood comes into the mix, with Kiron Kher giving a fantastic performance as Om's first-part mother; their reunion in the second half brings tears to the eyes!  Shreyas Talpade does well as Om's friend, and Deepika Padukone is amazing as graceful tragic heroine Shanti in the first part and clumsy star-struck Sandy in the second, popping bubble gum and fainting every time Shah Rukh comes close to her.  An array of stars too numerous to list have cameo appearances in a second part party dance number that crescendos to a confrontation between the suddenly-aware Om and Mukesh, the man who murdered Shanti in the first part.  All in all, this is an immensely enjoyable film to watch and I recommend it highly.",1293321600,,2183,4.736147757255937
3042501,4,B000ZKQWHK,"Enough has been said in previous reviews about the production value, cast (dozens of big names), sets, music. I have only this to add:

Om Shanti Om deserves every unkind thing said by negative reviewers. And yet...

How does it manage to be so good? It's campy and overblown, makes fun of everything and everyone, seems willing at every turn to sacrifice narrative quality for melodrama or snide cultural satire, prefers parody of Hindi-film stereotypes to originality, and should barely be able to limp along on its awkward, strained, artificial, self-conscious, and utterly predictable plot. Yet somehow it manages to be endearing and entrancing; it's complete cheese, but cheese of the very finest quality. How?

By doing all of that really, really WELL. So well that you can take all that in and be amused by it while still retaining suspension of disbelief and just enjoying the flow of the film.

Examples: The English subtitles translate one song (as the hero weeps after terrible and shocking news) as ""A dream when destroyed / Makes your world a void / Your life is not yours any more / Your life is a barren core..."" -- but the music is dreamlike, seeming to pulse and spiral, perfectly capturing the stunned state of the newly heartbroken, as good an aural portrayal of the character's pain as SRK's kicked-puppy-dog face and soulful eyes provides for the visual. Although in the movie the intent to parody Bollywood's overblown tragedic moments is clear, the song stands on its own as good music; it's found its way as an MP3 into several playlists and always makes me stop to listen.

Likewise, ""Dard E Disco"", ""The Pain of Disco"" has such a ridiculous introductory setup that I expected to fast-forward through it in disgust: a film hero and director are discussing what a certain scene is lacking, and the egotistical actor announces that he will save the movie from certain disaster (""You are dead, man, dead! Unless I think of something, as usual."") by recommending just the right musical number (""to express all this pain""). After a little brainstorming (""A sad item, maybe a trance number... No, a sad rock-n-roll. [waves the idea away] Done to death!"") he settles on ""a painful... DISCO!"" Well, yes, I agree... I do find most disco music pretty inherently painful. ""Dard E Disco"", however, is catchy and, again, an enjoyable song in its own right, even as it seems to parody stereotyped rhythms and melodies Westerners recognize as ""Indian"".

The scene leading up to this is fairly representative of the over-the-top parody. The director is explaining the scene to the actor, who is only half-listening while talking to a girl on his bluetooth earpiece.

Director: Sir, as you see sir, this is the climax scene where heroine Natasha is getting married to -- (dramatic chords) villain Ranbir! ...Sir Raj, that's you, his heart is breaking. He wants to tell the heroine that 'Natasha I really love you!' but he can't say it!
Actor: (laughing) Why? Am I mute?
Director: Correct sir! You remember your mother's death scene?
Actor: Now there is a mother also?
Director: Sir, sir, in mother's death scene, you scream so loudly that you lose your voice. Now, for the last time, you want to look at Natasha... but sir, you can't even do that!
Actor: Why? Why?
Director: Because you are blind as well sir!
Actor: Oh, I am blind also! I see.
Director: No sir, you don't!
Actor: I don't!
Director: Sir, music starts in the background! You leave the foreground! Natasha turns to look at you and --
Actor: Whoa, whoa, whoa! One second, Natasha turns to look at me, but Natasha is blind!
Director: No sir, you are blind.
Actor: But I was mute!
Director: Sir you are mute AND blind, and when Natasha calls out to you saying, 'Don't go, Raj!' you don't stop sir, because in the film you are deaf as well!

...it goes on like that for a bit, putting the hero in a wheelchair and cutting off both his hands also, before setting up the big dance number. It reads like a bad Abbott and Costello ripoff, but somehow it manages to play out smooth and droll. Timing, pacing, chemistry, good direction and good acting... something saved this film and made it wonderful; it deserves all the kind things said by positive reviewers, too.

Maybe it really needed that sad disco number, after all.",1293235200,4,4289,4.754032258064516

3042508,4,B000ZKQWHK,"Actor Shahrukh Khan is the ultimate showman and Om Shanti Om the perfect showcase for his brand of talent. This campy, retro spoof is directed by Farah Khan, who choreographed the Broadway musical Bombay Dreams, and she brings that same theatrical style to her filmmaking. The first half of the movie is set in the 1970s--and it's a tribute to the Hindi films of that decade. Struggling actor Om Prakash (played by Shahrukh) falls in love with starlet Shanti (Deepika Padukone in her Bollywood debut)--but fate drives them apart. Fast-forward 30 years and Om has been reincarnated as a huge star with the same first name, and a wannabe actress named Sandhya helps him rectify the past. Om Shanti Om is full of cameos--the title-track dance number alone features appearances by more than 30 Bollywood stars--as well as inside jokes that only those familiar with Bollywood will get (one particular scene at the Filmfare awards ceremony--Bollywood's Oscars--is hilarious), but anyone with any level of knowledge will realize that the actors are making fun of themselves, providing plenty of laughs. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1253750400,,1330,5.825641025641025

This is more like an MTV movie. A lot of flash without any heart. She said she was after Shahrukh a lot to make this movie and I understand why he was playing hide and seek with her. Now don't get me wrong. The first half was very funny thanks to SRK's wit. She actually said he improvised a lot during the filming and she kept it because it was so funny. Good move sherlock. However, please don't put this movie up there with there with the greats. Lets not encourage this kind of garbage.

With shirt off or open, in ""Darda Disco"", he provides legitimate competition to Hrithik Roshan while dancing with some sizzling hot sensual sirens.

Deepika Padukone shines as both the serious sophisticated Shanti and the ditzy charming star-struck Sandy.  What a dazzling big-eyed beauty she is. As good as this movie is she makes it better, along with Arjun Rampal who took the part of the villain when he didn't really want to.

This movie rocks from the deliberately cheesy opening song and dance, through 2 more strong songs and dances numbers, through a really funny and clever spoof of an award ceremony, through the dance party with 31 big name stars on stage, all the way to end where the cast and crew humorously run through the final credits leaving Fara Kahn in a funny situation.

3042513,5,B000ZKQWHK,"I loved this movie (even though most of the in-joke references to earlier Bollywood filmstars went over my head) because there was still more than enough fun to be had in this 2 hour and 42 minute film. Bollywood definitely gives you your moneys worth and more. It manages to give us a story filled with love, laughter, karmic revenge, and some really wonderful, eye-popping song and dance numbers with tunes so catchy that I'll probably be singing them for the next two weeks. This review is full of major spoliers although the film's ending isn't revealed.

Shah Rukh Khan stars a love struck bit player with the unfortunate name of Om Prakash Makhija in the Bollywood of the 1970s who's desperately in love with gorgeous megastar Shanti(Deepika Padukone) and he frequently converses with a giant billboard of her, completely oblivious to the stares of passers-by. One day Om and his brother have the good fortune to be cast as extras in a film in which Shanti is starring and it seems as if fate has brought them together. For quite awhile it does seem as if Shanti will fall for the charming Om, especially after he resecues her from an on-set fire. But alas, Om over hears Shanti telling her director Muhkesh Mehra(with whom she is secretly in love) a terrible secret that will make their love impossible. When faced with leaving his wife and marrying her as he has promised, the director (played by Arjun Rampal)does what most men would do--traps her in one of the extravagant sets in which they are filming and lights it ablaze. This time there's no escape from the fire for Shanti, or for Om who dies attempting to rescue her again.

We go immediately from a sheet being pulled over Om's body in the hospital to the new and improved reincarnated Om 30 years old and still played by SRK. He's the person our deceased Om had always dreamed of being, a famous actor with a great name-- Om Kapoor! His life comes complete with round bed, velvet slippers, and servents at his beck and call. When we first meet him he's waking up in the middle of the afternoon to go to work at the film studio--surrounded by screaming fans (who can't help observing ""He's so much shorter in real life""), fawning studio executives, and a frantic director who's trying to film a really weird scirpt.

 That scene leads into the film's BEST dance number to a song called ""Dard-e-Disco"" which I've since learned is a parody of a number by Hrithik Roshan, one of Bollywood's number one studs. Roshan and his father also have a cameo as themselves in this flick. I doubt that he knew he would be parodied at the time. I had no idea he was a paroding anyone in particular but by the time SRK got to to the part where he was shirtless and dancing provocatively while wearing a hardhat and a toolbelt with a rope slung over one shoulder and singing ""My heart is filled with the pain of disco,"" I was laughing in spite of the fact that SRK looked really hot. You can always count on Bollywood for a little comedy.

 But it's during the ""Pain of Disco"" number that Om Kapoor first begins to remember his past life as Om Makhija. Later at the Filmfare Awards (which feature hilarious send-ups of other stars' images) Om's memory clears even more, and when he spots the director who had killed both 30 years ago Om remembers everything and begins to plan his revenge.

 GUARANTEED END OF SPOILERS. OM SHANTI OM is a throwback to the films of the 1970s for its entire first half, which is to say it shows both the worst of the decade's fashion trends and the best of Bollywood's over indulgent opulence. The sets and costumes are magnificent beyond imagining and damn near knocked my eyes out. There are 7 or 8 musical numbers in this film, with the standouts for me being the ""Pain of Disco"", and ""Deewangi Deewangi""  with the lyrics ""All the cool boys come and make some noise, sing Om Shanti Om"". It's also a good practice for seeing how many Bollywood stars you can name since it's sung at Om's party as an entrance number for all the guests (who are playing themselves) as they arrive. I'm not very good but I was able to identify 6, maybe 7. Still it's an exuberant, catchy tune that will drive you out of your mind.

 If you've never seen a Bollywood film this might be a good place to start even if its most subtle parts will be lost on you as they were on me. Be sure to watch the end credits where almost everyone connected with the film gets to dance down the red carpet.",1241654400,14,4454,4.479654747225648

3042529,4,B000ZKQWHK,"Farah Khan's best quality as a director is that she is not confined to what is trendy or what is expected from a Bollywood movie.  Instead, she makes movies that she wants the audience and the actors making the film to enjoy.  In this case, we get a movie that deals with heavy themes of reincarnation and revenge in a lighthearted package that shamelessly embraces and yet spoofs 1970's Bollywood.

Om (Shah Rukh Khan), a bit part actor in the 70's, is in love with the beautiful leading lady Shantipriya (newcomer Deepika Padukone).  Through a series of coincidences, he manages to catch her attention but finds out that she is already married to the evil Mukesh Mehra (the handsome Arjun Rampal).  Tragedy ensues, but Om and Shanti get another chance at happiness in their next lifetime, when Om is the spoiled son of a rich actor and Shanti returns as Sandy, the diamond-in-the-rough who helps Om get revenge for the treachery of Mukesh Mehra.

Without a doubt, the best part of this movie is the song/dance numbers.  That is only to be expected, as Farah Khan remains the absolute best choreographer in Bollywood.  For instance, Dhoom Taana is a catchy song, choreographed in a manner that is engaging and funny.  But the real treat for Hindi cinema fans is Deewangi Deewangi, which features cameo appearances by just about everyone in Bollywood (31 star actors and actresses).

It's also clear that everyone in this film seemed to enjoy themselves while making the movie.  Shah Rukh Khan, in particular, embraces his inner ham here with solid comedic results.  Farah Khan, during her brief on-screen appearance, also seemed to be having plenty of fun.

Their enthusiasm is contagious, and I believe you will enjoy Om Shanti Om even if you have never seen any older Bollywood movies and can't conceive of a story line involving reincarnation.  This film is lighthearted entertainment, and seems to be making fun of itself on more than one occasion.

Certainly she knows how to tell a story, although, to be honest, in this instance, the story is overshadowed by the spectacle. Despite some tragic and somber moments in the plot, OM SHANTI OM remains overwhelmingly a display of sheer, rowdy exuberance. It's a party caught on film.

Plot SPOILERS now.

It's Bollywood in the 1970s. Om Prakash Makhija (Shahrukh Khan) is a lowly, aspiring actor (or ""junior artist""), whose resume, at this stage, consists of taking on gigs as an extra in films. He is seriously crushing on reigning Bollywood queen Shantipriya (Deepika Padukone), with whose billboard image he often converses. Om's dream comes true one day when he gets to meet Shanti, and even ends up saving her life. But Om then stumbles on a secret which makes any notion of romance with Shanti an impossibility.

Things take a turn to the sinister when Shanti perishes in a fire deliberately caused by a shady movie producer (Arjun Rampal), and Om, in a desperate bid to rescue her, soon after passes away from grievious wounds. But, nearby, in fact in the same hospital, as Om takes his last breath, the baby son of a famous actor is born. And the baby's name happens to be Om. You see where this is going, right?

30 years later, Om Kapoor (again Shahrukh Khan) has followed in his father's footsteps and has himself become a celluloid superstar. But his priveleged status has gone to his head, making him into a spoiled and selfish brat. Om also loses some street cred with his underwhelming brand of cussing, which mostly consists of ""Oh, fish!"" And, mysteriously, he's had a fear of fire all his life. Events unfold to at last make Om recall his past life even as he prepares to make a film, under the patronage of a shady movie producer (yes, that same one from 30 years ago). Then a bubblegum chewing girl named Sandy enters Om's life. Sandy is a huge fan of his and bears a striking resemblance to Shanti. And, suddenly, Om sees a way in which his beloved Shanti's death can be avenged...

SPOILERS end.

Bow down to this blockbuster picture if you, in any shape or form, are hooked into Bollywood, and, specifically, into the 1970s Indian film industry. OM SHANTI OM is simultaneously a fond sendup and a wry homage of that wild and wooly era. For one thing, if you go way back to those days, then you'll enjoy that bit of fun with 1970s actor Manoj Kumar (although, reportedly, Kumar himself wasn't too enthused with all the ribbing). If you pay attention, you might even learn how Govinda might possibly have gotten his screen name. Myself, since I've started watching Bollywood only about two years ago, I'm sure many inside jokes flew by unrecognized, over my head and unappreciated.

OM SHANTI OM reunites Shahrukh Khan and director Farah Khan (MAIN HOON NA and other films), and these two are undeniably the wellspring of the film's energy, enthusiasm, and vision. The general feel here is one of good-natured boisterousness, yet Shahrukh and Farah keep this ship steady and on course. The feel-good nostalgia is tempered by enough contemporary touches in the second half of the film, so that even the younger generations are kept engaged. Fair warning, though, if you haven't seen any (or a lot) of Bollywood cinema, OM SHANTI OM just may overload your senses and sensibilities.

It's near 3 hours long, and packed with many wonderful moments. As when Om first gets a chance to talk to Shanti but is so flabbergasted he can only make weird faces and funny noises; this, even as his voice-over reflects his elegant but unsaid responses to Shanti's questions. Then there's Om pretending to be a big movie star and then having to put on an act when Shanti comes to visit his set. And those are just two in a busload of memorable scenes. The film does tend to bog down post-intermission, but, still, the second half has its share of highlight bits. Unmissable is the whole Filmfare Awards sequence, which had me rolling on the floor and revealed what good sports Abhishek Bachchan and Akshay Kumar truly are. This is followed by an all-star afterparty as Om's pals in the movie biz show up to help him celebrate (this is the portion of the film where you play ""Spot that Bollywood Star!""). Shahrukh pokes fun at himself with the two suspiciously similar ""movies"" he's nominated for in Filmfare. And, for the ladies, the musical number ""Dard-e-Disco"" showcases Shahrukh's rockhard abs, which, rumor has it, he'd worked on for 3 months. Me, being a manly man, I shrugged at the newly buff Shahrukh (while bitterly drowning in envy, of course).

Oh, man, the sets, the sets, the opulent sets. I don't know how much it cost to finance this film, but it was well worth it. The set designs are spectacular, especially the 1970s film studios, before and after the devastating fire. The awesomely garish costumes and hair styles simply evoke that era, even as you grin at the kitschiness of it all. Most of the songs rock, from the sweet ""Ajab Si"" to the hauntingly melodious ""Main Agar Kahoon."" The wonderful ""Dhoom Taana"" is evocative of the tunes churned out back in the day (the song's set pieces incorporate pirates, the cabaret, tennis and also, thru special effects, 1970s stars Amrapali, Jay Vijay, and Saccha Jhoota). ""Dard-e-Disco"" is an item number, with Shahrukh himself, abs and all, as the ""item girl"" on display (Farah Khan calls him that). The showstopper, of course, is ""Deewangi Deewangi"" in which 30 Bollywood big names pop in and boogie down with Shahrukh (""All the hot girls put your hands up and say Om Shanti Om..."").

It's almost impossible not to have fun when you make a movie like this. The actors must've had a blast. More importantly, they were good. Deepika Padukone is a star in the making. This is the former model's debut film in Bollywood, and she's tall and gorgeous and is engaging as the sad Shanti and, later, as the klutzy Sandy. Also a former model, Arjun Rampal's acting hasn't impressed me in the past. But, here, as the conniving movie director Mukesh Mehra, he lands possibly his best role. He's surprisingly effective as the villain, in spite of that tacky little foo-foo mustache. Kirron Kher is also memorable as the melodramatic mom. As for Shahrukh Khan - reliably over-the-top yet magnificent and poignant for all that - the guy owns this movie. Even in his goofiest moments, he never loses that charm. There's a reason Shahrukh is one of the (if not THE) most sought after actor in Bollywood.

Eros International pulled out the stops with this dvd packaging, too. There are two dvds in this set, and they come in this oversized, very cool protective box. The first disc has the movie, the song selections, and the Director's Commentary (taped while Farah Khan was lying in bed, 6 or 7 months pregnant). The second disc has 2 and a half hours of extravagant bonus features: the pretty thorough Making of OSO; the Making of the Songs (sorry, I always find this segment boring); the not-very-serious (and occasionally annoying) interview with SRK, Arjun Rampal, Deepika Padukone & Farah Khan; Bloopers; Visual Effects (interesting for the ""Dhoom Taana"" segment); OSO Events - worth watching for the Music Launch, the Fashion Show, the London Premiere, and the Special Screening (where you get other actors' reactions); and an OSO Trivia Game. The best part (for me, anyway) is that most of this stuff is sub-titled in English. There's also a booklet with Cast & Crew bios and a poster of Shahrukh and his abs and his autograph.

Bollywood hasn't been exactly shy about producing movies with a reincarnation theme. But OM SHANTI OM may be the most buoyant and feel-good of them all, despite the dark supernatural element which creeps in. The plot, admittedly, is mediocre and rehashed, so we're pretty much on automatic when it comes to the storyline. The fun, instead, lies in soaking in the nostalgia and the gentle lampooning, the glorious absurdity and even the friendly self-indulgence of the film. Then there's also the tons of cameo appearances. Inspired by a warmth for the past and crafted with skill and heart and imagination, it's very hard not to be swayed over. OM SHANTI OM is a celebration of Bollywood. And, really, why even fight it? Wallow in the film, man, wallow!",1208390400,40,8806,4.8360982083609825
3276803,5,B000ZKQWHK,"This spectacle of colours and sounds is like a celebration of Bollywood with its crme de la crme cast and crew, and a story set in the Indian film industry spanning 30 years of classic and cult movies.  As such, this film cannot fail to stir the hearts of most Indians and lovers of Bollywood, but its appeal can reach much further beyond its domestic arena because of its high production standards and personnel of international acclaim.  The two most famous names in ""Om Shanti Om"" are Shahrukh Khan, one of India's most talented and versatile actors, and the film's scriptwriter, choreographer and director, Farah Khan, who has also earned many local and international awards for her outstanding productions.  The two Khans (not related) have already worked together successfully on several big hit movies, and ""Om Shanti Om"" is yet another step along this fantastic journey into semi-fantasy, escapism and sheer delight for the senses.  Although technically a Bollywood standard production of nearly three hours in length with about eight song and dance scenes throughout, ""Om Shanti Om"" is in fact many films in one as it embraces three decades of Indian films.  A basically simple story is very effectively woven through this film industry history, mixing a tragic drama with the unreal world of show business while making fun of its own industry by overplaying the sentimental tones of many classic Indian films.  For this reason alone, a general knowledge and feel for Bollywood would help the viewer to appreciate and understand these playful yet respectful tributes to Indian cinema.  Yet the story itself already makes for general entertaining viewing, and the high-profile stars, brilliant music and choreography, as well as lavish sets make this film stand out from the rest.

The first half of the film is set in the 1970s, complete with garish fashions and cars, big hair and sideburns, and even nauseating Seventies wallpaper, as we watch a young studio extra trying to get closer to the beautiful, famous actress he is in love with, when suddenly tragedy strikes.  But true to Hindu traditional belief, his soul is reincarnated that very instant into a newborn baby so that 30 years later - in our present day - when he finally remembers his past life, he can mete out justice and revenge on the evil perpetrator who took the life of his beloved three decades ago, but not without a nice little twist at the end.  A lot of work went into making the sets, especially those with an authentic 1970s look and feel, and even the songs and music in the first part of the film are in the style of Bollywood's Seventies films.  Some Bollywood cult figures are also comically represented, but many are also internationally recognizable or are very similar to Western and Hollywood characters and movies, such as a parody of India's Filmfare Awards:  Bollywood's Academy Awards, at which everyone who is anyone in Bollywood makes at least a two second appearance in their most typical and best recognized role or personality.  For viewers not up on Bollywood's Who's Who, the second disc in this set might be helpful with nearly three hours of ""the Making of..."" complete with interviews, bloopers, deleted scenes, audience comments, interactive trivia quiz and much more, all with English subtitles.  A nice, colourful booklet also has a brief summary of cast and crew which serves as a nice introduction to get acquainted with Bollywood, and the medium-sized, autographed poster of a bare-chested Shahrukh Khan in a sexy pose is also an added bonus in this set.  In fact, in recent times the EROS label s been producing ever bigger and more lavish box sets with more bonus material, and ""Om Shanti Om"" is the biggest one so far, and therefore worth a little extra money.  Watching this top-notch Bollywood production is like taking a fun ride at an amusement park with all its sounds and colours to create the perfect escape from the real world for a few hours, and then makes you want to come back for more.",1206835200,63,4017,4.8766519823788546

Of course, reaching to Bollywood movies is a bit problematic since I am not Indian and do not speak Hindi and cannot make sense of them unless there is a subtitle. They should be more accessible for the rest of the world : )
I found this movie very entertaining, heart warming, and encouraging (to follow one's dreams). It is funny at times and a little bit satiric (of older film industry in India). Picture quality, costumes, rich colors, dances -not over done and cheesier with a purpose- all comes together beautifully. It does not give the impression of a redo of a particular Hollywood movie but I kept thinking about the chandelier scene from the Phantom of Opera. However, overall, it seems like they owned every aspect of the plot, which includes reincarnation of the main character to give very simple and sweet messages such as: If you want something in life with all your heart, the universe will help you to obtain it.  Nobody gets away with a bad deed.
I do not think this movie is based on Shah Rukh Khan's struggle in his journey to stardom in real life, however, Om's different lives  pokes fun at unfairness of life or old Bollywood film industry specifically where having certain connections makes life easier even for a lazy/untalented/stupid/spoiled person. I like this aspect of new trend in the Bollywood movies: They are getting more complicated and more universal while they are not giving up their traditional themes or some of the old Bollywood movie signatures. Of course, it is always fun to watch Shah Rukh Khan dancing in traditional or semi-traditional Indian outfits, trying to do the right thing (not much fan of him when he is a villain), following his heart, serenading his lover, being such an Indian gentleman, etc.",1408579200,7,1991,4.7514450867052025

I saw my first few movies Bollywood films lately (3 idiots being one of them) and got turned me onto this market.

What was less enjoyable for me about this movie was the many dance scenes. It seemed they were as many dance scenes as actual acting scenes. Personally, I prefer the acting with a few dances thrown in. I almost didn't finish the movie, but thanks to fast forward got through several of the dance scenes that I was bored with.

I read some of the other reviews here, and I have no doubt...to someone with full appreciation of the dance and Bollywood history, this probably is a five star film. But for me, I have to give it 3 stars due to its length and IMHO excessive dance scenes.",1388102400,,802,4.34

All I can say is 'WOW'  this has to be one of SRK's best films! Great DVD. I loved the story. The acting. The music. A must see film. I have nothing negative to say about it.

They had a good concept for Omm Shanti Om but it's rather disjointed..hard to follow the storyline in my opinion.

Both were back  together to revenge the injustice of the protagonist who was still alive and at the prime of his career.  I enjoyed the music, the dances and the film sets of old and new.  The lead character always wanted to act but only got bit parts.  He got his wish in his second life time to be born into a rich director's family where he became the lead actor.  The female lead who was burnt to death by the protagonist also came back to life in the form of a clumsy young actress who was recruited  in the plot against the protagonist.

3276942,4,B000ZKQWHK,"Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's ""Om Shanti Om"" is, in a nutshell, a Bollywood film about Bollywood, with nods to the nostalgic 1970s disco era.  Choreographer-turned-director Farah Khan (her second movie as director) knows what she is doing when shirtless Shah Rukh Khan dances with scantily clad dancers. This is cinematic eye candy, with a good guy falling in love with a damsel-in-distress. And don't forget a bad guy.

The film starts out as a light-hearted romantic comedy about Om Prakash Makhija (Shah Rukh Khan), an unknown actor dreaming of becoming a big star, under the studio system of the 1970s Bollywood film industry. He falls in love an upcoming star Shantipriya (Deepika Padukone in her debut). Without revealing too much about the rest of the film, the story takes a dark turn when Om Prakash Makhija learns the starlet's secret.

Because the story of ""Om Shanti Om"" takes place in movie industry, the film is filled with many cameo roles by well-known actors (don't miss the party scene) as well as the film's director Farah Khan herself and producer Gauri Khan (wife of the star Shah Rukh Khan). Indian cinema fans will also enjoy the numerous 70s pop culture references.

But you don't need special knowledge about the film's cultural background to enjoy its joyful dancing and music. The story is thin and drawn out, but the colorful film delivers the goods.",1365984000,,1385,4.931330472103005

Having said this: Be aware that the images and product information for this item are not correct as of the date of this review. The picture shows the ""Collector's Edition"" 2-DVD set with autographed poster. What you may get is one ""Movie-on-Demand"" DVD, not packaged as the collector's edition, and no poster. Apparently, this is not the fault of the sellers, but a problem with the way Amazon updates its pages. The original seller must do the update, and when the product being sold changes (perhaps they ran out of the Collector's Edition), the page may not get updated.

The reason for my low rating is that the description doesn't quite match what I got. I selected the ""Two-Disk Collector's Edition with Autographed Poster"". Instead, I got a 1-disk copy with no poster.  I was very disappointed that I didn't get the collector's edition.
Looking back at the ""Product Details"", I see that there's only 1 disk listed, which should have clued me into the fact that there was a discrepancy. (Usually those details are not very helpful, so I skip them).",1358812800,6,729,4.6

3276970,5,B000ZKQWHK,"Replete with inside jokes, self-loathing Bollywood mocking of all-too-common motifs and walk-on appearances by nearly 2 dozen Indian cinema stars, well, that should be enough.  Not to mention Deepika Padukone, quite possibly the most exquisitely lovely woman on the planet (even my wife calls her ""impossibly beautiful"").

All this, and a great, involved plot, (mostly) razor-sharp directing from Farrah Khan (no relation to Shah Rukh Khan) and editing, this nearly 3-hour feast takes you through 2 lives lived for one idea.  Incredible, sweeping, and ultimately, creepy, as in sending shivers down the spine in a plot twist that will have you going back for more.

Yes, just a touch campy; yes, the big Bollywood production numbers are both slightly numerous and long, but are involved in the story if only marginally.

His dream came true when he was reincarnated as a star.  Bollywood makes all things possible, especially in Mr Khans movies.  The glamour in the movies with costumes, dancing and architecture is a feast to the senses.  I love watching them and wish Amazon would feature more of them I heard he has more than 70 movies.

The songs are as stellar as some of the best Hindi songs out there, and there's a good variety of sad, slow, and upbeat songs that will have you putting your hands up and saying ""Om Shanti Om"".

There are a couple of points I liked about the movie. It made charming references to several Bollywood films and actors of the past. It had great costumes, and songs, as I've already said. The plot is pretty original, and connects back to the concept of reincarnation that's popular among Indians. And, unlike a lot of other recent Hindi films, it doesn't try too hard and turn out to be a wannabe American movie. These days, many Hindi directors opt to make movies with very Westernized themes, with the actors speaking in English at least half the time and hardly showing any sign of being Indian aside from their name, if anything. Om Shanti Om, on the other hand, complements Indian culture very well while still being edgy for a contemporary audience.

I just thought that a couple of scenes were a little cheesy, although I should have expected that to come along with a Bollywood movie. The other little complaint I had was that in the second half of the movie, while some characters had reincarnated, others were apparently still living the exact same lives as before as if nothing happened to them in 30 years. I realize the directors didn't let anything happen to those characters just for the sake of consistency, but it was a little ridiculous to see some of the supporting actors with the same exact lifestyle and physique, just a little graying hair, when we are supposed to believe 30 years had passed.",1308009600,,1695,4.627906976744186

3276997,5,B000ZKQWHK,"I love Bollywood films in general, but this one - Om Shanti Om - enriches the usual content of drama and dance with a tongue in cheek parody of movies and movie-making, with Bollywood and Shah Rukh Khan bearing most of the brunt of the wit.  The plot is a clever two-parter, in which our hero, Om, a low-level bit player in the first half, dies and is reborn into the second as a mega star.  Director/writer/choreographer Farah Khan has crafted a satisfying web of love and loss, murder and justice, death and rebirth, laced through with film cliches.  And who but Shah Rukh Khan could carry off delivering a line like, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,"" to a male co-star (the villain of the piece, Arjun Rampal)?  Shah Rukh's characterizations are superb, from overacting the drunken acceptance of an imitation award in the first part to portraying a self-centered superstar in the second, who alternates constantly grabbing his own crotch with insisting on a dance number in a film, although the wheelchair-bound character he's playing is deaf, dumb and blind, and has lost both hands and feet.  The resulting Darde Disco number pushes music video cliches to their extreme.  There are fires and a falling chandelier a la Phantom of the Opera, and an award show at which the superstar Om is nominated for two best actor awards for playing exactly the same part in two different movies - only his co-star and the color of his sweater change in the clips.  Even motherhood comes into the mix, with Kiron Kher giving a fantastic performance as Om's first-part mother; their reunion in the second half brings tears to the eyes!  Shreyas Talpade does well as Om's friend, and Deepika Padukone is amazing as graceful tragic heroine Shanti in the first part and clumsy star-struck Sandy in the second, popping bubble gum and fainting every time Shah Rukh comes close to her.  An array of stars too numerous to list have cameo appearances in a second part party dance number that crescendos to a confrontation between the suddenly-aware Om and Mukesh, the man who murdered Shanti in the first part.  All in all, this is an immensely enjoyable film to watch and I recommend it highly.",1293321600,,2183,4.736147757255937
3276998,4,B000ZKQWHK,"Enough has been said in previous reviews about the production value, cast (dozens of big names), sets, music. I have only this to add:

Om Shanti Om deserves every unkind thing said by negative reviewers. And yet...

How does it manage to be so good? It's campy and overblown, makes fun of everything and everyone, seems willing at every turn to sacrifice narrative quality for melodrama or snide cultural satire, prefers parody of Hindi-film stereotypes to originality, and should barely be able to limp along on its awkward, strained, artificial, self-conscious, and utterly predictable plot. Yet somehow it manages to be endearing and entrancing; it's complete cheese, but cheese of the very finest quality. How?

By doing all of that really, really WELL. So well that you can take all that in and be amused by it while still retaining suspension of disbelief and just enjoying the flow of the film.

Examples: The English subtitles translate one song (as the hero weeps after terrible and shocking news) as ""A dream when destroyed / Makes your world a void / Your life is not yours any more / Your life is a barren core..."" -- but the music is dreamlike, seeming to pulse and spiral, perfectly capturing the stunned state of the newly heartbroken, as good an aural portrayal of the character's pain as SRK's kicked-puppy-dog face and soulful eyes provides for the visual. Although in the movie the intent to parody Bollywood's overblown tragedic moments is clear, the song stands on its own as good music; it's found its way as an MP3 into several playlists and always makes me stop to listen.

Likewise, ""Dard E Disco"", ""The Pain of Disco"" has such a ridiculous introductory setup that I expected to fast-forward through it in disgust: a film hero and director are discussing what a certain scene is lacking, and the egotistical actor announces that he will save the movie from certain disaster (""You are dead, man, dead! Unless I think of something, as usual."") by recommending just the right musical number (""to express all this pain""). After a little brainstorming (""A sad item, maybe a trance number... No, a sad rock-n-roll. [waves the idea away] Done to death!"") he settles on ""a painful... DISCO!"" Well, yes, I agree... I do find most disco music pretty inherently painful. ""Dard E Disco"", however, is catchy and, again, an enjoyable song in its own right, even as it seems to parody stereotyped rhythms and melodies Westerners recognize as ""Indian"".

The scene leading up to this is fairly representative of the over-the-top parody. The director is explaining the scene to the actor, who is only half-listening while talking to a girl on his bluetooth earpiece.

Director: Sir, as you see sir, this is the climax scene where heroine Natasha is getting married to -- (dramatic chords) villain Ranbir! ...Sir Raj, that's you, his heart is breaking. He wants to tell the heroine that 'Natasha I really love you!' but he can't say it!
Actor: (laughing) Why? Am I mute?
Director: Correct sir! You remember your mother's death scene?
Actor: Now there is a mother also?
Director: Sir, sir, in mother's death scene, you scream so loudly that you lose your voice. Now, for the last time, you want to look at Natasha... but sir, you can't even do that!
Actor: Why? Why?
Director: Because you are blind as well sir!
Actor: Oh, I am blind also! I see.
Director: No sir, you don't!
Actor: I don't!
Director: Sir, music starts in the background! You leave the foreground! Natasha turns to look at you and --
Actor: Whoa, whoa, whoa! One second, Natasha turns to look at me, but Natasha is blind!
Director: No sir, you are blind.
Actor: But I was mute!
Director: Sir you are mute AND blind, and when Natasha calls out to you saying, 'Don't go, Raj!' you don't stop sir, because in the film you are deaf as well!

...it goes on like that for a bit, putting the hero in a wheelchair and cutting off both his hands also, before setting up the big dance number. It reads like a bad Abbott and Costello ripoff, but somehow it manages to play out smooth and droll. Timing, pacing, chemistry, good direction and good acting... something saved this film and made it wonderful; it deserves all the kind things said by positive reviewers, too.

Maybe it really needed that sad disco number, after all.",1293235200,4,4289,4.754032258064516

This campy, retro spoof is directed by Farah Khan, who choreographed the Broadway musical Bombay Dreams, and she brings that same theatrical style to her filmmaking.

Struggling actor Om Prakash (played by Shahrukh) falls in love with starlet Shanti (Deepika Padukone in her Bollywood debut)--but fate drives them apart. Fast-forward 30 years and Om has been reincarnated as a huge star with the same first name, and a wannabe actress named Sandhya helps him rectify the past. Om Shanti Om is full of cameos--the title-track dance number alone features appearances by more than 30 Bollywood stars--as well as inside jokes that only those familiar with Bollywood will get (one particular scene at the Filmfare awards ceremony--Bollywood's Oscars--is hilarious), but anyone with any level of knowledge will realize that the actors are making fun of themselves, providing plenty of laughs. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1253750400,,1330,5.825641025641025

Funny move. Great songs and dances. Really fine acting by everyone including the ""junior artists"".  Shahrukh Khan is his usual self and is in great physical condition for this film.

Deepika Padukone shines as both the serious sophisticated Shanti and the ditzy charming star-struck Sandy.  What a dazzling big-eyed beauty she is. As good as this movie is she makes it better, along with Arjun Rampal who took the part of the villain when he didn't really want to.

This movie rocks from the deliberately cheesy opening song and dance, through 2 more strong songs and dances numbers, through a really funny and clever spoof of an award ceremony, through the dance party with 31 big name stars on stage, all the way to end where the cast and crew humorously run through the final credits leaving Fara Kahn in a funny situation.

3277010,5,B000ZKQWHK,"I loved this movie (even though most of the in-joke references to earlier Bollywood filmstars went over my head) because there was still more than enough fun to be had in this 2 hour and 42 minute film. Bollywood definitely gives you your moneys worth and more. It manages to give us a story filled with love, laughter, karmic revenge, and some really wonderful, eye-popping song and dance numbers with tunes so catchy that I'll probably be singing them for the next two weeks. This review is full of major spoliers although the film's ending isn't revealed.

Shah Rukh Khan stars a love struck bit player with the unfortunate name of Om Prakash Makhija in the Bollywood of the 1970s who's desperately in love with gorgeous megastar Shanti(Deepika Padukone) and he frequently converses with a giant billboard of her, completely oblivious to the stares of passers-by. One day Om and his brother have the good fortune to be cast as extras in a film in which Shanti is starring and it seems as if fate has brought them together. For quite awhile it does seem as if Shanti will fall for the charming Om, especially after he resecues her from an on-set fire. But alas, Om over hears Shanti telling her director Muhkesh Mehra(with whom she is secretly in love) a terrible secret that will make their love impossible. When faced with leaving his wife and marrying her as he has promised, the director (played by Arjun Rampal)does what most men would do--traps her in one of the extravagant sets in which they are filming and lights it ablaze. This time there's no escape from the fire for Shanti, or for Om who dies attempting to rescue her again.

We go immediately from a sheet being pulled over Om's body in the hospital to the new and improved reincarnated Om 30 years old and still played by SRK. He's the person our deceased Om had always dreamed of being, a famous actor with a great name-- Om Kapoor! His life comes complete with round bed, velvet slippers, and servents at his beck and call. When we first meet him he's waking up in the middle of the afternoon to go to work at the film studio--surrounded by screaming fans (who can't help observing ""He's so much shorter in real life""), fawning studio executives, and a frantic director who's trying to film a really weird scirpt.

 That scene leads into the film's BEST dance number to a song called ""Dard-e-Disco"" which I've since learned is a parody of a number by Hrithik Roshan, one of Bollywood's number one studs. Roshan and his father also have a cameo as themselves in this flick. I doubt that he knew he would be parodied at the time. I had no idea he was a paroding anyone in particular but by the time SRK got to to the part where he was shirtless and dancing provocatively while wearing a hardhat and a toolbelt with a rope slung over one shoulder and singing ""My heart is filled with the pain of disco,"" I was laughing in spite of the fact that SRK looked really hot. You can always count on Bollywood for a little comedy.

 But it's during the ""Pain of Disco"" number that Om Kapoor first begins to remember his past life as Om Makhija. Later at the Filmfare Awards (which feature hilarious send-ups of other stars' images) Om's memory clears even more, and when he spots the director who had killed both 30 years ago Om remembers everything and begins to plan his revenge.

 GUARANTEED END OF SPOILERS. OM SHANTI OM is a throwback to the films of the 1970s for its entire first half, which is to say it shows both the worst of the decade's fashion trends and the best of Bollywood's over indulgent opulence. The sets and costumes are magnificent beyond imagining and damn near knocked my eyes out. There are 7 or 8 musical numbers in this film, with the standouts for me being the ""Pain of Disco"", and ""Deewangi Deewangi""  with the lyrics ""All the cool boys come and make some noise, sing Om Shanti Om"". It's also a good practice for seeing how many Bollywood stars you can name since it's sung at Om's party as an entrance number for all the guests (who are playing themselves) as they arrive. I'm not very good but I was able to identify 6, maybe 7. Still it's an exuberant, catchy tune that will drive you out of your mind.

 If you've never seen a Bollywood film this might be a good place to start even if its most subtle parts will be lost on you as they were on me. Be sure to watch the end credits where almost everyone connected with the film gets to dance down the red carpet.",1241654400,14,4454,4.479654747225648

Other than that this was horrible, my friend from India said this movie was not liked in India...hey 600 million (something like that right?) people can't be wrong.

The movie had such bad Bollywood acting.

The plot just went aimlessly around until it would run into plot walls.

I have the DVD as well and when I play them side by side for my guests, they are amazed at how crappy the DVD looks when compared to the Blu-Ray.

Not a lot of great extras - Bollywood has yet to catch up regarding extra content.  There is the director's audio track, which is very nice.  The main audio track is amazing.  All of the songs in this movie are great and a joy with 5.1 Dolby Digital.

To my knowledge, there are only 3 Bollywood movies on Blu-Ray.  This and Saawariya are must haves.  The third, I've heard is terrible, regardless of format.

If you've paid the big bucks for a Blu-Ray player, and you love Desi movies, you must have these 2.  Saawariya is better in production quality and transfer - but it is a bit of a departure from traditional Bollywood movies.",1229817600,,952,4.233333333333333

I finally got a copy in November '08 (after waiting for the pre-order from Amazon since January) and I was doubtful if it was indeed a Blu-Ray. Very limited copies available online - from third party merchants.

This was the second or third Bollywood we ever saw (we are now near the 200) and it was the one that 'closed the deal' for us and sold us to Hindi movies thereafter.
It has a well-crafted reincarnation plot that is very engaging. Is well-acted by almost all. The songs and amazing dance numbers are a reason to watch in themselves (It was directed by a former choreographer so this may not be surprising)
Shahrukh Khan is so well cast and he reaps every bit of potential from the script.

When watching OSO, you feel that you are watching a classic, grand scale movie. This film is remorselessly '70's themed, and the plot seems to be based on that time period's formula. If you are open to that serious a through-back, you will find this movie very enjoyable.

SRK comes off with a genuine, touching, non-franchise/automated performance. Hard to pull off when you have been in more movies than probably anyone in history. Ok, a few of his signature moves here, but it guud!

Music, dances, more polished than any previous B'Wood movie I've seen, with a ghost story, reincarnation, good vs. evil, and of course a storybook romance.  Farrah Khan, who I've seen work her way up from assitant choreographer to directing this blockbuster, goes all out with her creative brilliance.  Deepika Padukone is breathtakingly beautiful in 3 roles (girl, ghost, and reincarnation), and Shah Rukh Khan gets to show us his stuff in two roles, one as a compassionate, likeable person, the other in his reincarnation as a spoiled Bollywood brat who doesn't initially realize that he's got some loose ends to tie up, and a lot of growing up to do. Shreyas Talpade, who was delightful in ""Dor,"" once again demonstrates his chameleon ability to get into diverse roles.

Don't watch this alone!  It's not that it's so scary, it's just that this much fun has to be shared, to be fully enjoyed.",1219190400,,966,4.83030303030303
3277022,5,B000ZKQWHK,"All you cool boys, come and make some noise,and say ""Oh Shanti Om!""

I am so glad I listened to the reviews here. I wanted to see more Bollywood after seeing a ""Bollywood""-style number in ""So You Think You Can Dance,"" and Bollywood-fusion films like ""The Guru"" (NOT the Mike Myers film ""The Love Guru"" - I mean the GOOD one, with Jimi Mistry and Heather Graham) and ""Bride and Prejudice.""

This film is wonderful. The dancing, the energy, and the comedy have a touch of the goofiness that make musicals like ""Singing in the Rain"" so much fun (and like that musical, this one is also set in the world of movie-making). And though there is a dramatic side to the story, the story never drags; for a 142-minute film, that's saying something. It is definitely a fun movie. The musical/dance numbers are dizzy fun, the hero is likable, and the actress who plays our heroine is a knockout (both in beauty and in talent. My God, these Bollywood heroines are gorgeous women). Even the credits are a hoot, as everyone from the director to the carpenters take bows at the end.

3277026,4,B000ZKQWHK,"Farah Khan's best quality as a director is that she is not confined to what is trendy or what is expected from a Bollywood movie.  Instead, she makes movies that she wants the audience and the actors making the film to enjoy.  In this case, we get a movie that deals with heavy themes of reincarnation and revenge in a lighthearted package that shamelessly embraces and yet spoofs 1970's Bollywood.

Om (Shah Rukh Khan), a bit part actor in the 70's, is in love with the beautiful leading lady Shantipriya (newcomer Deepika Padukone).  Through a series of coincidences, he manages to catch her attention but finds out that she is already married to the evil Mukesh Mehra (the handsome Arjun Rampal).  Tragedy ensues, but Om and Shanti get another chance at happiness in their next lifetime, when Om is the spoiled son of a rich actor and Shanti returns as Sandy, the diamond-in-the-rough who helps Om get revenge for the treachery of Mukesh Mehra.

Without a doubt, the best part of this movie is the song/dance numbers.  That is only to be expected, as Farah Khan remains the absolute best choreographer in Bollywood.  For instance, Dhoom Taana is a catchy song, choreographed in a manner that is engaging and funny.  But the real treat for Hindi cinema fans is Deewangi Deewangi, which features cameo appearances by just about everyone in Bollywood (31 star actors and actresses).

It's also clear that everyone in this film seemed to enjoy themselves while making the movie.  Shah Rukh Khan, in particular, embraces his inner ham here with solid comedic results.  Farah Khan, during her brief on-screen appearance, also seemed to be having plenty of fun.

Their enthusiasm is contagious, and I believe you will enjoy Om Shanti Om even if you have never seen any older Bollywood movies and can't conceive of a story line involving reincarnation.  This film is lighthearted entertainment, and seems to be making fun of itself on more than one occasion.  Although not particularly deep or poignant, this film succeeds at what it is supposed to do:  entertain thoroughly and unexpectedly.",1216252800,,2087,4.903133903133903

This movie turned out to be one heck of a romp.  It just goes all over the place from being overly dramatic, very grave, to ridiculous comedy or parody.  At least half of the musical numbers were quite well done especially the huge homage to Bollywood's past.  But most notable by me was the leading heroine who played Shanti.  Actress Deepika Padukone is stunningly beautiful and does not seem to be of this planet.  I could just gape at her all day.

This is only the 3rd Bollywood movie I've seen to date, but if this movie is any indication, sign me up as a fan for life.  I have to believe this is a bona fide Bollywood classic.",1211932800,3,885,4.098837209302325

In brief, Om Prakash Makhija (Shah Rukh Khan), a ""junior artist"" at the movie studio, is in love with top actress Shantipryia (Deepika Padukone).  They both meet with an unfortunate event, and are killed.  Thirty years later, Om Kapoor (Shah Rukh Khan) realizes suddenly that he is the first Om reincarnated, and sets a path to avenge the death of Shanti.

Comedy and drama combine to make this an entertaining film.  In addition, Om Shanti Om, makes gentle fun of itself and Bollywood movies in general, adding another level of fun. Both of Khan's performances are solid, and Padukone (in her debut role) is a confident, convincing actress.  The movie is full of  Bollywood big names giving special appearances and cameos --well over 50-- giving an added dimension to the movie, as the viewer tries to recognize them all.  It contains impressive dance numbers, with mostly good music.  Overall, while not perfect, Om Shanti Om is thoroughly enjoyable.
