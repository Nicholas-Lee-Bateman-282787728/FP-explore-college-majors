Ben Miller is an understated marvel in his role of the visionary Mr. Jonathan and the entire supporting cast is wonderful. The music chosen for the film completes this entire entertainment package.

3048041,5,B001068D9S,"If you have a child who is learning to dance and goes to dance competitions, this film is for you. If you don't but would like to know what would it be if you had, then you should watch the film, too.

The film ""documents"" a fictious dance studio's struggle to win the largest Australian dance competition. Ben Miller plays the owner/teacher/choreographer of the school, trying to do something different and also to make a difference. All characters in the film are slightly exaggerated caricatures of everyday people; you lough a lot but you never loose that vague feeling that it could actually be a real documentary.

The film shows the less glamourous aspects of the competitive (children) dance world, yet it does it in a way that it is obvious that the makers do actually love it. It is a satire but a satire that does not want to hurt, it just wants to show that if you see a silver lining, there must be a cloud somewhere.

It is a film for those who appreciate subtle humor and irony, prefer dialogue over visuals and character acting over action.",1207526400,,1056,4.5473684210526315

8237220,5,B001068D9S,"Delightful, quite funny mockumentary in the vein of Christopher Guest, especially Waiting For Guffman. If this isn't quite as surreally inventive or hysterically funny as that modern classic, it makes up for it with a great sense of good cheer, a dose of humanity between all the absurdity, and a terrific lead performance from Ben Miller as a deeply self-delusional dance teacher.

Its all about dance school competitions between different groups of pre-adolescent girls. Miller plays Mr. Jonathon, who not only desperately wants to finally win, but also to make political statements by staging dances based on issues like the Kyoto Climate Protocols. This leads to some extremely funny sequences as we see these little girls dancing about some of the most un-danceable concepts imaginable. The dialogue is witty, the supporting performances generally very strong (the one weakness is that some of the supporting types lampooned are a bit too familiar and easy targets), and the choreography is great - just off enough to be extremely amusing.

I was very glad I took a chance on this.",1453852800,,1086,5.129943502824859

8237223,4,B001068D9S,"This Australian mockumentary of dance competitions for young people is a pleasure to watch when it focuses on the girls dancing.  Let's face it, few boys go in for dancing, so those that do get the limelight.  We viewers can thrill in watching nimble cute girls jump and swirl and kick and so on along with their costumes.

What made me chuckle and sometimes really laugh was the commentary given by Mr. Jonathan about his point of view in running the dance school.  He is clearly a bit worn and weary of the struggle while still young so his strange remarks reflect his frustration.  funnier still is his absolute belief that dance should show oppression and be acted out on stage.  So sometimes he has his girls dance as oppressed workers of corporate factories with the mean corporate owners hitting them!  Then he has some act as small animals with the others as mad scientists trying to experiment on them.  The extreme leftwing goofiness is funny.

In comtrast Miss Elizabeth has an old fashioned dance school with a few to performing in the style of musicals.  It should be light and fluffy and happy with girls wearing pink and red and so on.

These two schools are in competition for the the grand finals. Originally mr. Jonathan was in third place but good news!  The second place group had a bus accident and their leader lost a foot!

I suppose the director went to some real dance schools and real dance competitions because there seem to be at least a hundred dancing children in this film.  The obsessed mothers are classic.  The woman without kids who adopts them as a foster mother gets angry when she cannot return them as unsuitable.

Unauitable means naturally not very good dancers!  So finally she resorts to kidnapping an exceptionally good boy dancer for the troupe who razzle dazzles them all.  Until the police come....

If what I have told you this far seems amusing...off you go!  If you know the series Death in Paradise, you'll be happy to see that Mr. Jonathan is the actor in a younger incarnation.",1418342400,,2030,4.648876404494382

Some beautiful dance moments and many make-you-cry-it-is-so-funny lines and scenes.  Gets better and better as it runs and finishes strongly.  One of my all-time favorites and certainly a top Aussie film.  Buy it! Watch it! Don't miss it!!",1246924800,2,361,5.375
