8290863,4,B001D11A2M,"I enjoyed this DVD. It does not cover any new ground in illuminating the legends of Native American history. I am glad that this DVD honors the people, and legends, as their stories are told in a respectful way. I am glad that this DVD has been produced with the underlying ideal that people can always grow their compassion and understanding of past history to light a way forward through the darkness of the horrors of the past. The legends live on, as we all do through the stories we consciously choose to tell our children ... and may the stories be of peace and progress for us all individually and collectively, as global hosts for this earth. Healing. It is all about the evolution of spiritual healing.",1269820800,21,711,4.5625
