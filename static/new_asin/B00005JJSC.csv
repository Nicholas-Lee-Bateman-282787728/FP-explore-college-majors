7939366,4,B00005JJSC,"In English the title is Max and The Junkmen. It sounds goofy but makes sense as you watch the movie. The basic plot is that a rich guy becomes a cop and runs into an old friend from the army who now works for a chop shop. The rich guy is ambitious as a cop and feels emasculated by the criminals and the laws around him. To fix the issue, he intends on setting up his small time chop shop friend by basically manipulating his hard luck prostitute girlfriend. He sets them up to commit a major heist and then catch them in the act. Mas is essentially a jerk.

The plot thickens though as the prostitute girlfriend has an effect on Max he wasn't expecting and that's the whole crux of the film. Each character when brought into the orbit of others affects changes in the other. Max is affected by the girlfriend and she's affected by his wealth and frustrated sexuality. It leads her to egging on her boyfriend to going for a big time move. It's the nature versus nurture debate played on a small level and in a subtle way. You can completely ignore it and enjoy a vague cop romantic drama if you want. However, it's like a more intelligent version of Clockwork Orange by Stanley Kubrick and a good deal more interesting, which is kind of like the original Anthony Burgess novel anyway that Kubrick deviated from.

The performances are all pretty good. No one is playing too far against type. Michel Piccoli shows up as yet another sinister sexual presence just this time with a badge. Romy Schneider is asked to play tragic. Considering she was awfully  tragic in real life, she nails the part with ease. It's not to say that they are bad or phoning it in. They're delivering the goods.

Claude Sautet's early gangster and thriller work is some of his most interesting work and quite a bit better than his later glacial dramas no matter how many lovely actresses appeared in them to be filmed with all their best sides lovingly lit. Here, you can see his mid career drams beginning to crystallize. Most transition films are difficult watches but this is one of the few that isn't.

The DVD itself comes with 3 language tracks and only French subtitles.. It was a good purchase. The film is good and the transfer is good enough to not look terrible on a HD TV. Worth the effort to pick up if you can.",1510704000,,2298,4.423167848699763
7939367,5,B00005JJSC,"This is a film I'd heard of when it came out, but somehow never got the chance to see as I've spent a lot of time outside France. Seeing it about 30 years after it came out was a surprisingly fresh experience: I think Romy Schneider - as the happy prostitute - has never been so beautiful, and Michel Piccoli - as the treacherous cop - never so weird and ominous. It was the beginning of a long series of beautiful films by Claude Sautet with these two actors (among others).",1358467200,,475,4.230769230769231
7939368,5,B00005JJSC,"Once more, Claude Sautet proves us why he was one of the most sensitive and zealous French filmmakers of those ages.

A police officer, lives just immersed in into his job, when sudenly the state of things will lead him to meet a very clever, lovable and alluring pros (Romy Schneider). Then, he will support her and even, will go to prison in order to redeem her.

In the hands of any other director this script World have become a simple store, but Sautet gives it grandness and eloquent expression.

Don't miss this extraordinary film that incluyes one of the most mesmerizing performances of that majuscule actor named Michel Piccoli.",1177545600,4,638,4.781818181818182
