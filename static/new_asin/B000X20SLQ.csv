2996452,5,B000X20SLQ,"I had seen this DVD on eBay for quite a while and ended up purchasing it as well as Part 2.  Overall it is a very well drawn anime and highly explicit however well done to not be overly graphic.

The artwork is beautiful and storyline of this vol is excellent. Vol 2 is also well done but leaves an open ending like there maybe a 3 but isn't. I would recommend it if you are a yaoi fan for the artwork alone is breath taking.",1223251200,17,425,3.9302325581395348
2996453,4,B000X20SLQ,"Overall, I found this a highly enjoyable DVD, but it does contain some reasonably explicit rape scenes, and I can appreciate that this might not be everybody's cup of tea. The ending, however, is a happy one, so fear not.
The animation is very good, and while it's unfortunately in Japanese there are English subtitles. The story is set in Japan's seedy criminal underworld, where Yakuza-run casinos collect their debts by selling people into slavery or selling off their organs. Kanoh is a loan-shark who fits neatly into this world, and buys Ayase at one such auction, after Ayase was offered as collateral by his gambling cousin Ishii. Ayase doesn't remember Kanoh, but the two have some history, and Kanoh is absolutely obsessed with the pretty youth.
But I won't tell you anymore, lest I spoil the story...
The character of Kanoh is particularly interesting, as he swings between a bad man being bad and a bad man trying to be good. Ayase is stereotypically tragic, but sweet, and the combination works pretty well. Some extra angst is added by the fact that Kanoh is struggling with his sexuality, maintaining that he isn't gay, it's just that Ayase is special.
Anyway, it's got some hot scenes, and just enough plot to make it interesting ;)",1220918400,32,1248,4.809302325581395

8226576,1,B000X20SLQ,"This is not technically hentai... but it is not anime either.  I mean, there is sex and rape and all that stuff.... if you are in to that, hold off before you get this.  This has no nudity to speak of.  Ass shots, but not dick shots and there are no shots of penetration.  Soft core is putting it mildly with an adult topic.",1391385600,3,324,4.015625
8226577,5,B000X20SLQ,"I loved it of course.  I must, as it turned out this was the second time I had ordered it.  I would like to see a sequel.",1372550400,,121,3.4444444444444446
8226578,1,B000X20SLQ,"I borrowed it from a friend, it contained 2 ep but in total 60 min long. I've had my dose of animes, and the quality isn't very good with the disproportions not to mention the blond protagonist is practically half the other's size and looks like a pre teen than a college kid. I felt it was very exaggerated. The emotion was rushed in quickly, I've seen good 2-4ep shows like this before and know it can be done right. I don't recommend it.",1366070400,3,440,4.25
8226579,3,B000X20SLQ,"I really wanted to like No Money. I thought it was going to be one hot series and then some. The premise certainly had promise; unfortunately, I did not feel the series delivered on that promise at all. One, there is barely any sex scenes, and forgive me, but I did not buy this anime because I really wanted a lot of internal dialogue. Two, the series is more about a budding romance between the two characters, not a master-servant relationship. Three, there is an oddly homophobic vibe that runs through this series: we are supposed to root for our male/male couple but laugh at a transvestite.

I guess I was expecting something along the lines of Boku No Sexual Harassment or Ai No Kusabi, and that's not what I got at all. If the company would have promoted this as a pseudo-comedy about an odd budding romance, that would have been one thing (and I would have saved my money and not bothered with the series), but the company purposely billed it as a sexy yaoi with a lot of lemon potential.

I am clearly in the minority amongst the reviewers, so if you are into yaoi romance, this series might be right up your alley, but if you are looking for hardcore yaoi, this series might not do it for you. Just depends on your taste. :-)",1357171200,2,1237,4.397379912663755
