6304385,5,B00IXXVCT4,These six movies are standard.  I've got all of them on VHS taped from the TV.  In watching these movies I've discovered one or more scenes in every movie that was not in the movie when televised.  Either the movie was edited for time or content. I'm hoping to get every last one of the movies made during the final years of Raymond Burr's life.,1397692800,3,345,4.276923076923077
6304386,5,B00IXXVCT4,"I talked to Amazon recently and asked them for more information about what movies were being released in this collection.  They were very nice and gracious when they explained that they don't have access to that data yet.

I'm just grateful that they are willing to post the photo and pre-order information at an early date!

There is only so much that the production company is willing to release about a collection, even though it is coming out in stores only month away.  Even the Perry Mason Facebook page and TVShowsonDVD.com haven't been able to tell their fans more about this collection than Amazon can.

We are all excited about this new release.  I'm sure the information will be posted as soon as possible.

Until then, I can only guess that it will probably be similar to the previous collection.  This set of movies will probably continue with the next 6 stories in the series: Scandalous Scoundrel, Avenging Ace, Lady in the Lake, Lethal Lesson, Musical Murder and All Star Assassin.

I cant wait until this collection is released!

Thank you so much, Amazon!  Youre amazing service is greatly appreciated!",1397088000,19,1120,4.842105263157895
6304387,5,B00IXXVCT4,I am so glad to be getting nice official releases of these movies. They are worth the price. You get what pay for if you want quality and clarity which I do. I have all the TV series shows on DVD now it's great to be getting the TV movies too. Our whole family enjoys these and will for years to come.,1396915200,4,301,3.870967741935484
6304388,5,B00IXXVCT4,"I have the original series collection and I'm starting on the Television Movies.  They are all fantastic and timeless!  I think the quality of the first movie set is not as good as it should be.  However, it is not bad enough to pass on these DVD's! I just preordered the next set!  I can't wait!",1396656000,9,296,4.232142857142857
6304389,1,B00IXXVCT4,I will wait for single disc releases like I am for the Vol 1 MOD release which is coming on June 10th. Spending $36 rather than $54 is worth the wait. I did not order the Vol 1 release due to the high price and I sure won't get Vol 2 either.,1396137600,28,241,3.6538461538461537
6304390,5,B00IXXVCT4,"Perhaps if correct & further information were presented then you might make a case for purchasing this collection (Vol,#2).  Does the box set contain one disk, or three disks, as was the case with the volume one set ???
What are the disk contents for volume two ???  The volume one box set contained six tele-films on three disks with a SRP of $58.99; volume two lists one disk and no listing of the tele-films with a comparable SRP; so, why should I buy volume two in such ""blind"" conditions ???  I will not purchase this set until corrections are made to the product listing.
I demand to know what I am purchasing or YOU won't get my money !!!

Have fun :) :) :)

6304391,1,B00IXXVCT4,"Unfortunately, having not learned anything from the issuance of Volume 1 at this astronomical price, the studio (with is doing it again. While ""Perry Mason"" remains one of the great TV legal dramas of the Golden Age, the studio (Paramount) that released this set has no shame at pricing this collection well over $53.00 for this 3 disk, 6 movie collection! For that it deserves ONE star or less! Note: This is ""Collection 2  (so labeled) --and there are 30 ""Perry Mason"" TV movies. At this ratio, the 30 movies will be released in 5 sets of 6 movies each and cost well over $300.00 or more!! Let us look at some even better known and widely-followed other TV movie series. In comparison, the ""Columbo"" 1989 Movie collection cost $11.50 for a 2 disk, 4 movie collection; the ""Columbo"" Movie collection of 1990 of 6 movies on 3 disks is $12.00; and the ""Columbo"" Movie collection, 1994-2000 -- again is 6 movie grouping on 3 disks cost only $18.21. Finally, the ""Murder She Wrote"" Movie collection (4 movies on 2 disks) cost $20.00. In case Hollywood in general and Paramount in particular hasn't noticed there is a on-going recession going on in this country. Discretionary funds for such luxuries as DVD sets, go to the bottom of the list. Just because fans have a loyalty to a program doesnt mean they are stupid. Raising prices out of all proportion to earlier sets or similar sets is just greed. Suggestion: Let market forces do their workdont purchase until the prices come down appreciably.",1396051200,47,1495,4.706106870229007

The slipcases are not based on any seasons, there is no reason for them.  The movies in this slipcase set ran from 1987 to 1989.

6304415,5,B00IXXVCT4,"To be honest, I can not write an ""honest"" review on anything Perry Mason  - I LOVE every bloomin' minute of it regardless of the cost.  If someone yells ""The building is on fire, run for your lives!"" the first thing I will do is grab all the Perry Mason DVDs before heading for the door (thank goodness there are no children in the house) and then worry about the rest.  From 1957 to the '90's, they are just the best entertainment though I admit the movies do lack the 'special' charm with Paul Drake Sr, Lt. Tragg, and Hamilton Burger gone - may they all rest in peace.  My prayers are with Barbara Hale - thanks so much for all the wonderful entertainment and hope you have many many more birthdays to celebrate.",1403136000,,715,4.313432835820896
