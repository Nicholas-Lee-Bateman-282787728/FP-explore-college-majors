8551504,4,B00AGMWETM,Only down side to this DVD is his sweatshirt. Can't see how the move should look on the body. Actual mussel & body part movements. He does a great job teaching.,1471392000,,160,4.193548387096774
8551505,5,B00AGMWETM,"I ordered this DVD as it had a big discount and I wanted to get to the next level of dancing. I always wanted to be able to pull advanced moves like waving, popping but following Youtube videos on left me frustrated.

Most teachers are fantastic dancers, but when it comes to breaking down the move, they kinda do it in a rushed way leaving out vital components thus creating a lot of frustration for myself.

Brian(the teacher from the DVD) is a good dancer, but a fantastic teacher. He takes amazingly complex moves and breaks them down into 4-6 steps which are easy to comprehend.

Sometimes if the move is more advanced he uses what I call middleman moves. Basically I similar move so that your body can get used to the angles, muscle tension so that when the time comes to perform the actual move you're more adept and ready.

And for some reason this works.

Another thing that I liked is that most of the time Brian actually anticipated the mistakes I was going to make and he pointed them out as I was making them. Ex: twisting my hand at weird angles, trying to ""shortcut"" some moves, etc

Overall these DVDs build a solid foundation for your popping, waving, isolations and other cool looking moves leaving room and actually encouraging you to develop your moves unique for you.

For the price it is a must buy and I can not recommend it enough.",1452384000,,1355,4.461538461538462
