2586862,5,B000FTCLTO,Captures the magical 2005 Steeler Super Bowl run in it's essence. Listening to Steeler announcers was especialy nice. Tunch and Billy add a home town touch and much enjoyed insight!,1163203200,3,181,5.066666666666666
2586863,5,B000FTCLTO,Now I already taped all of last seasons playoffs. Of course the quality is much better on these dvds plus you get play by play from Tunch Ilkin and Bill Hilgrove and sideline interviews with players. No commercials and edited huddles and timeouts. Relive the experience of the Steelers championship run and how special of a team it was. I just wish they would put out 1970's playoff runs by the Steelers. Putting the whole playoff games and adding Myron cope and Jack Flemings play by play. I think the NFl and MLB are getting the point that fans want more than just highlight films. Check out the 1979 Pirates world series set too.,1158019200,6,632,4.552631578947368
2586864,5,B000FTCLTO,"For those out of state Steeler fans, this is a must get.  Having Bill Hillgrove and Tunch Ilkin's radio broadcast synchonized with the action is great.  Made me feel like I was back home in the 'burgh watching the game while listening in on the radio.

As others stated, you just get the action, the games are dubbed very well. NFL Films has done it right.",1157760000,13,356,4.363636363636363
2586865,5,B000FTCLTO,"OK, for the record, these ARE all the complete games.  The VIDEO is just what was broadcasted on gameday.  The games are only edited slightly. And I'll tell you what has been cut out: 1. the commercials. 2. When CBS would, in between plays, put up the graphic and go through the starting lineups.  3. The footage that is shown when the network comes back from commercial (which serves only as a backdrop for ads/logos anyway). That's what I've noticed so far. But getting rid of that only streamlines things and you won't really notice it.  That being said, the AUDIO is the Pittsburgh radio broadcast team, not the network commentary team.  That is a little weird at first, since sometimes the screen is showing a stat or player and the radio guys are talking about something else entirely.  The games start seconds before kickoff. But for the Super Bowl DVD, they do include the trophy presentation after the game, and you can hear each person talk and the music, just as on gameday. That was a nice touch. Essentially, all they took out was the audio track of the guys in the booth and looped in the radio team.  Also as a bonus, they have include an NFL films piece on each DVD.  There are segments on Chuck Noll, Hines Ward, Dick LeBeau, and Bill Cowher.  I think this is a must buy for any fan who wants to relive the greatest run in Super Bowl history.",1157500800,70,1359,4.44758064516129
2586866,5,B000FTCLTO,"NFL Films continues to dish out great Super Bowl DVDs. Everything from the Super Bowl Box Sets to the New England Patriots home videos, to the 3 games to glory Patriots DVD 2 disc set to the Steelers Super Bowl XL DVD and now this.

It seems that after each Super Bowl these days that NFL Films dishes out great DVDs and then some. Ever since the Patriots DVD from 2001 season, I have seen dramatic improvements in each DVD release of the super bowls in every way.

I thought that they could not improve much on the 3 games to glory DVD 2 disc set of the Patriots.....NFL Films has proven me wrong.

NFL Films continues to improve on their DVDs and this is just proof. This is a pre-release review. I give this pre-release a 5 star rating because of the new improvements on making the Super Bowl DVDs even better....who knows what could be in the future for Super Bowl DVDs but one thing is for certain....NFL Films keep satisfying us Football and DVD fans.",1150329600,12,957,4.365168539325842
2586897,5,B000FTCLTO,"I have never seen all these games in their entirety, this was a treat! I highly recommend it to all Steelers fans",1392681600,,113,4.181818181818182
2586898,3,B000FTCLTO,"While I love the fact that these games are available on dvd,, I do not love that you don't get the network commentators. Especially the game against the Colts. The commentary is awful. I don't know who the guys are that are doing the commentary on this game but I'm guessing there is a reason for that. They stink. But if you are a football lover it's worth the sub-par commentary.",1386115200,,381,4.380281690140845
2586899,5,B000FTCLTO,"They said Ben did not have a great SuperBowl But he was great in all the other games, worth every cent.",1377388800,,103,3.9523809523809526
2586900,5,B000FTCLTO,when I watched it seems like yesterday my first time seeing the steelers win it all Its nice to watch it all over again!,1371081600,,120,4.041666666666667
2586901,5,B000FTCLTO,This is a must have for any true DIE HARD STEELER FAN! One for the thumb is not in our vocabulary anymore because of this season.,1357257600,,129,4.0
2586902,5,B000FTCLTO,I just bought it and I think it's great to own it but for nowadays football it gets a little boring the games really aren't that close except the divisional game,1353628800,,161,4.225806451612903
2586903,5,B000FTCLTO,"very good dvd. would definetly recommend this dvd. seen same dvd at models for $40, more than half price i paid. arrived very fast.  'GO STEELERS'",1296864000,,146,4.615384615384615
2586904,3,B000FTCLTO,When I first watched the games I thought that it was interesting that they had the local radio guys doing it instead of the CBS/ABC broadcast team. Most sets have the network broadcast. Then I realized that the NFL probably didn't want John Madden explaining to the audience how the refs were handing the game to the Steelers on a silver platter. I'm sure the original Super Bowl broadcast is probably harder to find than the Ark of the Covenant.,1291680000,5,446,4.5875
2586905,5,B000FTCLTO,"This is one of the most interesting post-season runs ever.  Big Ben doesn't play so well in the super-bowl but he comes away with a ""W"" for The Bust. The DVDs themselves are nice with a good menu.  A good buy for a steelers fan.",1288915200,,228,4.044444444444444
2586906,5,B000FTCLTO,"I love this DVD set.  It has four complete games (commercials and advertising edited out) with the RADIO commentary team instead of the TELEVISION commentary team.  I love it.  (It's nice slightly ""faster"" football games.)  The audio is the way I watch the games anyway.  (TV on mute and radio cranked up) I've seen these games over and over and over.  Good stuff.  Highly recommended!",1226016000,,385,4.8307692307692305
2586917,4,B000FTCLTO,This is good because it features the full-length games with Steelers radio commentary.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that it didn't go into depth about important plays and such.  Exciting to watch those games over again!,1211846400,,233,4.8
2586918,5,B000FTCLTO,"Good DVD, love having all the playoff games on DVD.  I wish it was offered on Blu-Ray.",1188259200,,86,4.0588235294117645
2586919,4,B000FTCLTO,"Having purchased the Super Bowl XL DVD, I was quite disappointed to find that the game itself was not included on that DVD.  Later I found out why when this set was announced.  Although I think the Super Bowl itself should have been available separately, I will admit that it's pretty cool having the entire Steelers' 2005 postseason set.  Like other complete games done by NFL films, the game dispenses with commercials and lengthy huddles, and this speeds up the game considerably.  It is very well done and flows together seamlessly.  The play-by-play is done by the Steelers' radio team, not the CBS team who did the original broadcast.

It's great to be able to replay these games and see the big plays, especially ""the tackle"" in the Colts game when Ben stopped Nick Harper from scoring.  Since the Super Bowl itself was not as good as it could have been (other than the outcome, of course), it's nice to have the playoff games.

This set includes four highlight pieces as well:  Bill Cowher, Hines Ward, Chuck Noll, and I forget the fourth one, but they're pretty entertaining as well.

For Steeler fans, this is a must-have.  For everyone else, buy it if you just love to have NFL games.",1183939200,,1195,4.642857142857143
2586920,4,B000FTCLTO,"This is a very good DVD Collection. It's great to have all the playoff games and Super Bowl together to watch especially full game coverage. My only suggestion would have been to have 1 more CD in the collection containing the ""extra"" videos and maybe a video compilation of what happened during the season to get the Steelers to the playoffs so there is an understanding of the season as a whole.",1172448000,2,397,4.527777777777778
2586921,5,B000FTCLTO,I intended this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend who is a die-hard Steelers fan but gave it to him early for fear he'd purchase it himself. He never gets tired of watching it and the easily accessible championship reminder may ease the pain of the 2006 season...as much as that is possible.,1167868800,6,294,4.462962962962963
2586922,4,B000FTCLTO,"I really enjoyed watching the Steelers playoff run to the Superbowl again.  My only dissapointment with the DVD's is that although they show every play, there were sections that were cut out.  I like to watch the whole game, with pauses in play and all (exept for the commercials).  For example, much of the coverage of Palmer being injured at the beginning of the Cininnati game were cut out.  Overall, I would recommend buying the 4 DVD set.",1167868800,8,443,4.641025641025641
2586923,5,B000FTCLTO,"The dubbing of steeler anouncers over the video is nothing short of outstanding.  You get the Pittsburgh slant as you watch.  Imagine what they said when Jerome fumbled in Indy, Ben made the tackle, then headcase Vanderjagt gave us the ""immaculate redemption"".  Imagine what was said when Fast Willie broke it 75 yards for the TD or when Antwaan hooked up with Hines.

The one thing you have to get used to is the time between plays is totally cut out, and so just when you think you can get up and refill your chip bowl, the next play starts.  All the plays are there, but the huddles and timeouts are gone.  You decide whether that is good or not.

By far, if you are a steeler fan, you will want this in your collection.  If you are a Cincy, Indy, Denver, or Seattle fan, you may want to wait for another year.",1167782400,21,813,4.26797385620915
2586924,5,B000FTCLTO,"As a Pittsburgh Steelers fan for a long time now, I thought this DVD set with commentary by the Pittsburgh Radio announcers was great. It was a welcome relief to hear someone other than the Network announcers making the calls. The Steelers played with poise and overcame bad calls in Indianapolis and Detroit (against Seattle in the Super Bowl). Seattle didn't, the Colts didn't respond well to the pressure they were under, even with help from a bad call late in the 4th Quarter. Ben's tackle saved the game there. Ben scored a touchdown in Super Bowl XL. According to the rules the ball has to cross the goalline. In the ref's review it did. Even if Seattle pushed Ben back prior to his hitting the ground. I know not everyone will agree with this. But, who overcame the bad calls and responded better to the penalties assessed: Pittsburgh or Seattle? HERE WE GO STEELERS HERE WE GO!!",1165881600,4,886,4.613924050632911
2586925,5,B000FTCLTO,"The guy who wrote the bad review on this box set probably doesn't even own it. Why would he? He obviously hates the Steelers and loves either the Bengals or Browns and is bitter because Pittsburgh won their 5th ring and both those teams combined still have ZERO! As far as his comments about the Refs. All the calls made, except for one, in Super Bowl XL were text book, if one would read the definitions of calls in the NFL Rule Book. The one that wasn't was a post possession foul. He fails to mention or doesn't remember all the breaks Seattle got. Such as the no falg on the block in the back on Roethlisberger during the int return which set up Seattles sole TD. A late hit after a QB slide and an intereference on Pitt WR Nate Washington, neither which were called. The flag thrown on Seattle which was picked up after discussion on a non reviewable helmet to helmet and a whistle blown while Pitt tried to recover a fumble. The refs didn't make the Hawks go 5 of 17 on thrid down or miss 2 field goals and have poor clock management. They dindn't score the longest run in Super Bowl History or throw the only TD by a WR in Super Bowl History or record three sacks and a pick for Pittsburgh. AS for the Set it is Awesome. All four games from the live TV telecast but with the Local Steelers radio call.",1165190400,10,1308,4.2151394422310755
