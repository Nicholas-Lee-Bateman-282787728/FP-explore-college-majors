8472658,5,B005H45M7K,"I was looking for something to watch with a film noir vibe as I was waiting on a delayed flight, glad I happened upon Safe House.

I remember reading something about this film when it screened a few years back at a film festival in Germany. The critics liked it then and I enjoyed it now. It's a gritty little slice of ""real life and real relationships."" Clifton Powell and Deborah Lacy both very talented actors, carried the tension well.",1473552000,,439,4.4875
8472659,5,B005H45M7K,"What a great ride! True film history told with power and boldness. If want something daring, this is it!",1458691200,,104,4.526315789473684
8472660,5,B005H45M7K,"Refreshing new take on the good old detective noir.  Nice solid set piece with interesting twists, turns and burns.  A fun experience.",1367280000,2,134,5.045454545454546
8472661,1,B005H45M7K,This would of been better if it was actually a porn. It was really stupid. I don't really have anything else to say about it but I had to add more words so.,1359936000,,156,3.757575757575758
8472662,4,B005H45M7K,"I bought this movie strictly because of Clifton Powell, I love this man, he is a great actor, the movie itself was ok but not great, but because of Clifton Powell I watched it anyway.",1338768000,,183,4.257142857142857
8472663,1,B005H45M7K,One of the poorest excuses for a movie i have ever seen. I could believe it. Deleted it before it was finished,1334188800,3,110,4.045454545454546
8472664,1,B005H45M7K,What a horrid waste of money. You can't even get into the movie without being drowned with cussing and lesbians. Couldn't watch it for the grossly overused foul language and lesbians. Skipped to the end to see the Undercover Detective outsmarted and murdered by 1 lesbian he's to protect. Why anyone would spend good money to produce this trash is beyond me. I spent less than 2 bucks to watch it for 7 days but deleted this movie instantly because it's nothing more than trash. Made me sick to get this junk in my head! I gave a 1 star rating because there's not a 0 star rating but this is definitely a negative 0 movie to me.,1331683200,3,628,4.330508474576271
