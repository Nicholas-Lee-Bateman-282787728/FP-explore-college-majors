8205810,1,B000EMFX1A,"I have to agree with the ""moron"" who reviewed this inferior production.

Read Sherif's own comments and you will sense his self-consciousness, inferiority complex, and attempt to defend something that is the antithesis of beauty and art. I bought this DVD on a lark and after one viewing, found it most useful as a frisbee or a coaster for my coffee table.",1172880000,,356,4.741935483870968
8205811,5,B000EMFX1A,"I think the DVDs are great and so do 9 others who have seen them. They think the DVDs are outstanding. The idiot moron who left the negative feedback here is obviously either a competitor, or a loser who has tried to succeed but could not due to his brainless stupidity, so he has to try to destroy others efforts. Oh well, losers will be losers.",1168473600,,346,4.257575757575758
8205812,1,B000EMFX1A,"I have enjoyed several ""relaxing"" DVD's featuring ocean waves and beaches in Hawaii and around the world with stunning photography and appropriate meditative music. This version, with its uneven, jerky photographic techniques, reminds me of the videos I took just after purchasing my first camcorder years ago. Whoever produced this must have also just purchased his/her first video camera. The music is poorly chosen, sounding more like something the college guys edited in after their fraternity break in Hawaii. I am an amateur photographer and could have done much better. I will try to return this disc to the Amazon Marketplace seller as soon as possible. Please do not waste your money!",1150243200,3,693,5.196428571428571
