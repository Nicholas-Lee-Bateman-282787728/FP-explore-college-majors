2452892,5,B000C65Z20,"After renting this movie three or four times, I thought I might do better buying it.  It is haunting in a way that most other Le Carre movies are not.  It demands close attention from the viewer, because it crams a lot of plot, characters, and detail into approximately two hours.  But if you are patient enough to deal with it all, you will be rewarded.  Most of the story takes place in contemporary Kenya (though the actual filming was in South Africa), and the local scenes are heart-wrenching.  The story is rich enough to include black, white, and various shades of gray -- much like the world we live in.  The heroes include a milksoppish young diplomat (Fiennes) who falls in love with a dynamic, rather monomaniacal social activist (Weisz).  It is her demise that forces him out of his botanical comfort zone and into a hopeless confrontation with Le Carre's inevitable villains, corporate capitalism and western civilization in general.  I often have problems with Le Carre's ideological predictability, which is attenuated in his novels by their very complexity, but which, in the movies derived from those novels, often assumes comic book simplicity.  Such is not the case, or at least is less the case, in this movie.  Fine performances from all actors and actresses, a literate and well-paced, if somewhat densely-packed script, and scenes you will have trouble forgetting.  The violence is almost completely off-camera, the sex is mild by today's standards, and for those who incline toward ""Fast and Furious"" plot devices, there is even a car chase.  Regrettably, no ninjas, zombies, comic book characters, or animated pseudo-Broadway gay songbird extravaganzas.",1514073600,,1678,5.083941605839416

But this was one of the first movies I really came to love despite its not having a very happy ending. I picked up a secondhand copy of the book, which I never got around to reading but will be making a priority now that I realize I seem to have a penchant for adaptations of John LeCarre's works, including The Night Manager.

From the trailer; to the cover of the DVD; throughout the movie; you are led to believe something interesting is about to happen, but it never does; nothing clever; no action; no spying; no nothing. At one point the guy is handed a gun, but never uses it or pulls it, or carries it later. That said; there is location footage in Africa of the people and a little scenery. There is some one-sided action of running-away. The guy has sex with the girl on the first date; then says ""I cannot let you ride with me in the plane to Africa, because we do not know one another."" We do not care about the characters. A promising, simple plot, which the script-writer fails to do anything with at all. I want my money back.",1481587200,,742,4.345323741007194

This is one to watch if you want a genuine look into the world of third world drug testing and developing. This is a movie to watch, if you want to have your conscience stirred, if you want to feel that incredible burden for the lesser privileged. It was a powerful movie, a heartbreaking story line. There is no redemptive ending, there isn't a miraculous hero that saves the day (well sort of I suppose). It is raw, honest, captivating and ultimately moved me in such a way that I was completely burdened for these countries that are in dire need, and countries like America, Canada, England...have exploited.

2452976,4,B000C65Z20,"John Le Carr was widely criticized for the book that this film is based on.  However, the critics didn't get it.  This film, while it departs in the book in some ways, conveys the same message that Le Carr was trying to get across in the book, which is that life is cheap and that we in the West who place an unbelievable value on our own lives are living in an unsustainable dream world.  I love the setting in Kenya, which is probably the first Third World country to be subjected to Western medicine, resulting in its transformation in two generations from a beautiful land to an overpopulated and underfed basket case.  My main quibble with this film is that the cinematographer was not up to capturing the drama of desolate expanses of that part of the world.

2453010,5,B000C65Z20,"The Constant Gardener is an entertaining thriller. Its main strength is the acting rather than the plot. The movie is set in modern Kenya, which is depicted as corrupt and AIDS infested. Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) is a shy middle ranking diplomat based at the British High Commission in Nairobi. He has a fiery and idealistic wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) who takes an interest in the activities of a major pharmaceutical company carrying out trials of a new tuberculosis drug. The company wants the product on the market quickly, and this requires the drug to be tested on unfortunate Africans. Tessa is brutally murdered and Justin begins an investigation into her death. It leads him into a murky world of corrupt Kenyans, clueless British diplomats and ruthless pharmaceutical executives.

Tessa is rich, beautiful, outspoken and devotes her time to saving the world. She has a passion for involving herself in controversial issues and trying to help the less fortunate. In this story Kenyan government leaders are willing to exchange the lives of their citizens in return for cash in a Swiss bank account. Incredibly, Quayle's boss in London (Bill Nighy) is willing to participate in the conspiracy in order to win 1,500 pharmaceutical jobs for Britain. He also confesses his sins in a memo, which is also hard to believe. Le Carr&eacute; has always been suspicious of big business, and believes that multi-national companies employ hit-men to solve their problems.

Fiennes gives a great performance as Justin, the mild-mannered and unambitious diplomat who turns into a tenacious sleuth. Weisz is a revelation as Tessa and won an Oscar for her performance. She is required to play someone more complex than the typical movie heroine. Tessa is strident, obstinate, clever, vulnerable, sexy and fun. There are also great supporting contributions from Danny Huston and Bill Nighy. The cinematographer, C&eacute;sar Charlone, shows an Africa full of colors and beauty.",1427500800,,1970,5.211356466876971

a genuine masterpiece.  Every actor in the cast performs
on the highest level of which he or she is capable.  And, if
I am right, that is no small or unimportant claim.  Further,
the director Fernando Meirelles, uses a strange but utterly
brilliant directorial method.  The movie is based on the novel
by Jean le Carre; and when you catch on to the devices of the
director you realize that he has deepened the novel and its
masterful and contemporary plot.  Also, I love the music that
sets the action; and the figures of African life intermixed with
the plot.  After multiple, multiple viewings, I'd now rate this
movie as one of the finest that ever has been made.  Check
it out yourself.  But do NOT believe that one or even two
viewings will be enough to reach its depths....  Or to enjoy it
to the full.

I must confess that the fact that Ralph Fiennes is pretty hot and Rachel Weisz is one of those actresses that gets into her character won.

Because the testing is done far away in Africa, the negative consequences of unauthorized tests can be ignored.  Seeing the destruction of this practice, and caring about the people, Tessa devotes her time to research and pursue the links in the chain that authorize the process - her commitment demands so much energy and time, and engagements with other researchers,  that her husband finds himself asked to trust her - even when some clues suggest her infidelity.  He is in great measure supportive of her work and she is strong in expecting his support - but unfortunately chooses to ""protect""  him, by not telling him the details.  It takes her death and his investigation into it, for him to see that she was pursuing something others would kill her for.  My one issue is that as usual,  there is little depiction of self organizing systems that women use to get things done in Africa. So the white woman is the hero, along with her black medical colleague, but conditions otherwise look horrific and dirty with no collaboration among local people to clean public spaces.",1415318400,,1350,4.860262008733624

The diplomat and his wife are an ill-matched couple who seem determined not to acknowledge their differences, or to express anger at their antipathy.  ""Tessa"" and ""Justin"" do not evince much love for each other; one is patiently hopeful, introverted, wearing blinkers; the other an impatiently single-minded activist.  Their difference is such that a viewer may at the start be sidetracked wondering how on earth they got together and stayed together.  But wait:  in crisis and later we learn their back-stories and how their natures are challenged.

Fiennes is painful to watch, a brilliant piece of acting.  Le Carre is a master, in all his novels, at portraying half-successful people who half-achieve; it is a hallmark of his view of the British Establishment, and especially of its foreign service and allied agencies.  His theme is that ""you can't win"", at least not without complete self sacrifice ---- very British.

I did not read the book, so I do not really know why the author named his work The Constant Gardner, but I interpret the film as saying that Ralph Fiennes loved Rachel Weisz, the two stars in the show, with a love that is as strong as the gardener in the Chinese proverb. However, another interpretation of the title may be that while Rachel, a lawyer-activist in Kenya, is very active in her pursuit involving people, Ralph, a British government official, is somewhat passive, and although certainly loving Rachel, is generally uninvolved with people and more interested in his gardening. Whether I am right or wrong, the interpretations I give to the title, I think, captures some of the main characteristics of this fine film.

 Without divulging the intricacies of the plot, it focuses on the fact that Rachel is found shot to death. This awakens Ralph, who feels remorse for not knowing what Rachel was involved in, and bothered by rumors of her infidelity, decides to find out everything about her and who killed her. He discovers a far-reaching high-level conspiracy, far more complex than he ever imagined.",1337644800,,1262,4.7318181818181815
2453055,4,B000C65Z20,"Well, it has very little to do with gardening, which I wish I'd known earlier. I must admit this one caught me napping. It was not like anything I'd ever seen before, except to some small degree documentaries. It is fiction, but it follows so closely on fact as to be positively chilling.

Justin Quale (Ralph Fiennes) was a fairly minor British diplomat on his way to Nairobi when he was seduced by Tessa (Rachel Weisz), who asked him to take her along with him to Africa in whatever capacity he thought appropriate. So he took her as his wife.

Turns out Tessa is a progressive activist, working with a variety of groups, including Amnesty International, and one which was specifically investigating the exploitation of Africans in drug testing. Through her work in an AIDS abatement program, she came into contact with doctors who knew that people were being used as guinea pigs for drug testing, supposedly with informed consent, but in fact with their consent being the only way they could go to the only available clinic.

Then she and one of the African doctors are murdered, and Justin decides he must find out who and why. She had told him very little about her work, and so he was working with what he found among her papers (those that were not stolen when her computer and discs were) and the people she had apparently trusted.

I say ""apparently"" because it turns out almost nobody is telling the truth, nothing is as it seems to be, and some supposedly very respectable people were involved in some really horrible activities.

It's pretty hard to follow, but sooner or later the important points get sorted out. And as I say, it sounded so horribly real. I wonder how much of it really is.",1336780800,,1704,4.629139072847682

2453057,5,B000C65Z20,"With some thrilling cinematography, a gripping story and some powerful performances, `The Constant Gardener' is one of those films that continues to grow on me over time.  It has considerable staying power and the haunting truth behind the film's message is one that will take you by surprise, not in that you won't follow the subtle hints spread throughout, but in the effect that the realities it brings to light are ones you can't help but take home with you.

You'll think about this one long after you've seen it.

The film unfolds by shifting from present time to flashbacks that follow the murder of a diplomat's wife.  That diplomat is Justin Quayle, and his wife is an opinionated and fearless woman named Tessa.  Tessa is getting her hands dirty so-to-speak, uncovering the backdoor politics of a pharmaceutical company in Kenya.  Desperate to shut her up, Tessa is brutally murdered.  Leaping off the edge of sanity, her widowed husband makes it is goal to get to the bottom of her murder, and in doing so he uncovers more than he bargained for.

His wife was a busy lady.

Instead of becoming formulaic or predictable, `The Constant Gardener' bypasses those pitfalls by building a solid foundation for our attention and then surprising us with tonal shifts and deceptive stylistic approaches that color outside of the lines.  The film is beautifully constructed, and the use of flashback sequences is done with style and grace; used as a tool that is effective, not distracting (which can easily become a problem with that particular plot devise).  Fernando Meirelles has a superb grasp of his story, moving in and out in a way that attracts us to every scene.

Then you have a slew of stellar performances that really captivate.

The more I think about Weisz's performance the more it's proven that she earned that Oscar.  She develops such an interesting and soulful character, consumed with her passions and yet she elicits such passion in the viewer.  I still think she was in the wrong category (sorry, but she anchors this film), but I can't fault her placement (considering her screen time) or her win (even though I still think that Amy Adams and Michelle Williams were stronger overall).  Ralph Fiennes gives one of the best performances of his career as the increasingly more desperate and confused widower, and Danny Huston is impeccably smooth as Sandy, the elephant in the room.  They all come together flawlessly to create a stirring drama.

Intense, provocative and profound; `The Constant Gardener' is top-notch indeed.",1318982400,,2547,4.938967136150235

2453061,4,B000C65Z20,"The Constant Gardener is based on the book by John Le Carr of the same title. Set mainly in Kenya, it's a murder mystery about a woman who wrote a scathing report about a drug company that is using poor Africans as test guinea pigs.  After writing this report she is murdered while on a trip to the Turkana region of Kenya.

Like the book, the movie opens up with the the murder of Tessa Quayle and her doctor friend, Arnold Bluhm. They are found in the Turkana Lake region of Kenya.  Her husband, Justin Quayle, a British diplomat, is left to piece together Tessa's secret project.

We go through flashbacks of Tessa and Justin when they first met, a diplomatic party where Tessa is high ranking diplomatics about the pharmaceutical industry in Africa, Tessa researching the rigged trials and testing of a new tuberculosis drug, her life with Justin, etc. along with watching Justin deal with his wife's death end piecing together what she was doing and why she was murdered.

This movie is well filmed in my opinion.  Filmed on location both Kenya and Sudan, all the scenes in Kenya and Sudan were authentic. The Kibera slums in Nairobi look like the slums - trash, filth, and everything. Some of the music in the background was by Ayub Ogada from Kenya. You easily make out the words of ""Kothbiro"" a couple different times throughout the movie. I highly recommend Ayub Ogada's music, by the way.

I did find the movie a bit hard to follow and the device going from flashback to present over and over lent to my difficulty in pulling together the bits and pieces of the mystery as they ever so slowly unfolded. In the final 30 minutes of the movie, the story finally pulls together and we understand why Tessa was murdered.  The book is written in much the same manner - so the movie kept true to the book in this respect.

Although the story line is a bit hard to follow I am recommending this movie as the movie is simply very authentic. If you are interested in what things look like in Kenya and how life is lived this is an excellent movie to watch.",1272240000,,2056,4.475935828877005
2453062,3,B000C65Z20,"I found ""The Constant Gardener"" to be a standard suspense movie.  There's a fair amount of mystery and intrigue but, frankly, I was more impressed with the location shots in Kenya.  The only reason that I thought to write some comments about ""The Constant Gardener"" was the politics involved.  This could be one of those teachable moments that enlightens how two sides of a story could both be correct.

There's an aspect to ""The Constant Gardener"" that involves pharmacutical companies dispensing their products on Third World countries prior to the normal length of research that takes place before such drugs can be introduced in the USA.  The suggestion is made that this early availability is terrible and is happening solely for the benefit of greedy indutrialists.  While watching these developments I couldn't help but think of the early days of the AIDS epidemic.  There were no drugs that could cure the disease back then but there were drugs in various stages of promising research that might eventually help.  The pleas of dying suferers went in vain because the FDA could not OK a new drug until all extensive studies had been successfully completed.  I recall that, in time, some restrictions were eased somewhat but the rigorous standards of the FDA continue to persist.  So, is the release of drugs that have laboratory-proven results but without the conclusive, time-consuming studies a crime? Or is it an effort to reach impoverished remote areas with epidemic levels of lethal diseases?  I kept thinking how the other side of the story was totally ignored and that greed was shown to be the only motive involved.",1270252800,,1631,4.981549815498155

The action is taut as first the wife and then the husband search out the link among a number of health organizations engaged in research into the efficacy of a new drug to combat TB.

See, she got bored just sitting around Africa all day and started emailing the charitable drug companies who were providing drugs and vaccines to the Kenyans who can't even afford clean water, threatening them saying she was going to get them in some sort of trouble. She's causing difficulty for them the same way she humiliated her poor innocent gardener husband.

2453070,5,B000C65Z20,"Part mystery, part love story, part political thriller, director Fernando Meirelles' THE CONSTANT GARDENER was one of the very best films of 2005.

Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz star in this adaptation of John LeCarre's novel that takes some effective shots at the international pharmaceutical business.

Fiennes plays a rather passive British diplomat, stationed in Africa, and Rachel is his activist wife who too often sticks her nose into very dangerous situations that makes some highly placed politicians nervous.

It's no spoiler to reveal that Rachel is murdered, since this event takes place within the first five minutes or so of the movie.  Virtually her entire role is seen in flashback sequences, as Fiennes thinks back on their relationship in his quest to learn who killed his wife and why.

His investigation uncovers a sinister conspiracy between big business and members of the British government that will destroy millions of innocent lives if it isn't stopped.  Soon, Fiennes finds himself being stalked by the same forces that killed his wife.

Danny Huston, Bill Nighy and Pete Postlethwaite co-star in this superbly acted and scripted nail-biter.

DVD extras include deleted scenes and several ""Behind-the-Scenes"" featurettes, including a fine one on Le Carre.

The only flaw in what would have been an otherwise great movie is its overuse of the flashback technique to the point of being somewhat confusing and disjointed.  But, that is a very minor flaw easily overshadowed by great drama, romance, mystery, suspense, and tragedy. The storyline remains intact and continues to convincingly fall into place as the movie progresses.  Big Pharma's use of the desperately poor of Africa as expendable medical guinea pigs, whose poverty and living conditions are stunningly and accurately portrayed in the movie, serves as a backdrop to the mystery that gradually unfolds before the viewer.

There is little action--and what little action there is, a raid on an African village late in the movie, seems completely contrived.  Instead, we come in late to the action scenes in almost every case--or in the final one, early.  But almost nothing is shown directly, only the consequences.  Much of the film is told in flashbacks or jumpcuts, making the story somewhat difficult to piece together; and the one scene in which most of the dubious characters are introduced happens quite quickly.  I have to confess to quite a lot of confusion about who was who and what was happening--most of it cleared up, but frankly the ending didn't seem terribly satisfactory to me.  My whole family was left saying, ""hunh"" and my 24 year old son further opined that it was much ado about nothing.  The 'hero's' revenge was pretty understated, too--a public shaming doesn't really seem enough to pay for your wife's murderer, does it?  It's certainly not an American action flick; exactly the opposite.  But if you enjoy British reserve, this might be the film for you.  As others have said, the acting, cinematography, and music were excellent--it's the plot and it's telling that left me cold.",1214352000,,1310,4.886877828054299

In the meantime the film offers a lot of food for thought about how the Third World is exploited by the major pharmaceutical companies and their corporate and government accomplices.  I think the film also concerns itself with passive diplomat Justin Quayle(Ralph Fiennes) bringing closure to the horrific murder of his activist wife, Tessa(Rachel Weisz).  Fiennes is nothing short of brilliant in an understated performance that suggests the anger and frustration that lurks within.  Weisz deservedly won an Oscar in an impassioned and effervescent turn so much so that Justin's loss is the audience's loss as well.

2453081,5,B000C65Z20,"My wife and I just finished watching The Constant Gardener.  I was so impressed I came straight to Amazon to write a review.  I ordered it for 2 reasons:

1.  John LeCarre always tells a good story, full of intrigue (remember ""Smiley's People"", ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" and ""The Honorable School Boy""?  LeCarre's characters may be fiction but the overall plot and point of his literary work is always based on truth, fact, and his real-life experiences in the British ""Foreign Service"".

2.  Ralph Fiennes might not be able to pronounce his own first name correctly (Rafe?) but he is incapable of a bad performance; the man is a brilliant actor.

This film is beautifully shot, the acting is fantastic, the locations are incredible, the story is first-rate LeCarre, and it has a great musical score to boot.  What more could you possibly want?

It's impossible to walk away from this film saying that it was enjoyable.  It wasn't.  Like Blood Diamonds, it was full of disturbing and heart wrenching realities. Sadly there is no denying the continued exploitation of third world peoples for profit whether it be for precious stones, drugs, weapons sales, etc.  I feel sorry for anyone who can watch this and not be moved b the plight of those people and does not feel very fortunate that they do not have to endure such an existence.

The Constant Gardener is full of well-paced suspense.  It is a fairly long film (over 2.5 hours) but it did not seem that long.  This film is very worthy of 5 stars and YOUR attention.  Those who would ""dis"" this film were either made very uncomfortable by the sad and outrageous truth, or would not know a great film if it walked up and bit 'em on the backside.",1195257600,,1699,4.62876254180602

However, the film did justice to certain issues which countries in Africa face.  And it did so in a way that makes it accessible to mainstream Americans.  Some of the more intense or artistic types may be aggravated by instances of ""simplicity"" in the film or the ""mainstream"" aspects.  Yet at the same time, this film is a work of art.  It has a wonderful love story intertwined with the intensity of one of the larger issues that Africa faces.  For those who are less in touch with global issues, after showing them this film, they'll become more aware.  The actors did a spectacular job and the film acts as an eye-opener.  It takes the mainstream of filmography but twists it in such a way that you can thoroughly appreciate it as a meaningful film as well; an interest in the world at large blossoms in your heart to a point where you truly realize that life doesn't always consist of simple electronics ready at your fingertips.

The girl activist in question is married to a minor diplomat in Africa who looks after gardening (hence the title).  She delves too far into what a drug company is doing in Africa and gets killed because of what she knows and is threatening to expose.  Her husband, who up until then liked to stay out of her work to pursue his more mild manner diplomatic work, then follows the clues to unravel the mystery involved in his wife's death.  In the process he finds out just how faithfully his wife really did love him. I won't expose the ending, but it tells a real story with all the twists and suspence that makes for good story telling.

Yes, I too am invigorated by a film in an exotic setting, but there is something terribly predictable about bright, rich women holding little brown babies and screaming at their boyfriends, husbands, or bosses because they dare not to care. Particularly, I find, this plot, set in motion by the angry female protagonists, dominates British drama. One thinks, off-hand, of David Hare's ""Plenty"" - about the maddened former resistance fighter who can't accept peacetime life (Meryl Streep).

Curiously, these gals come to these scandals of capitalism with wide-eyed innocence, having learned nothing whatsoever about the world at their posh private schools and expensive universities.

The scenes in Africa depict a land of such misery that it was painful to visit, even in a movie, let alone in person. The subjugation of the impoverished African people to powerful, wealthy drug companies playing research roulette with their lives was just one aspect of their misery. They are also shown as being harrassed by brutual bandits that are their own countrymen. The inhumanity of man to man on this continent by both visitors and natives was graphically illustrated.

It's not exactly a true story, but the plot does revolve around drug companies using untested drugs on African countries. Which is a real issue. So I guess it's close enough.

The big problem for me is that the film uses that issue to create a sort of suspense thriller. I'm not sure how I feel about that. I have to admit that this film (and the internet researching I did following it) did increase my awareness of the unsavory practices of pharmaceutical companies in the 3rd world, but I did feel that the movie was simply using it as a background to make their suspense story and sappy love story more compelling.

2453093,5,B000C65Z20,"I think it is easy to get the wrong idea about this film. It is about so much, and much of it is uncomfortable to watch in many ways. If you focus on what might be considered the 'biggest' aspect of the story, you might just miss what is really important about it.

Part of what makes 'The Constant Gardener' hard to watch is that it is so well done. Shot and edited in a gritty, almost documentary style, I felt like I was watching something that was, in ways, more intimate and more real than I should have been seeing. It's a hard illusion to pull off, but here it is accomplished admirably well. Fine performances by all the actors, and in particular the leads, Ralph Fiennes and the stunning Rachel Weisz in her best role to date, make this a compellingly authentic film, one that is difficult to extract yourself from once you are in it.

On the surface, 'The Constant Gardener' is about Western pharmaceutical companies and the lengths they will go to to get their drugs to market before their competitors. This is an unstated evil in our culture, a secret we all know about but do not speak of, and this film makes a bold stab against it. Ralph Fiennes, as Justin Quayle, spends much of the film following his dead wife's trail, uncovering the dirty deals and dangerous (sometimes fatal) practices of one such company and one particular drug, and it just seems the more he digs, the worse it gets. It portrays well how Western companies abuse the vulnerable state of many African nations, where the people there do not get the medications they need and how big drug companies take advantage of this. This alone makes it a hard movie to watch.

At its core, however, this is not just a political movie with a point to make. At its heart, 'The Constant Gardener' is a moving story of the love between two people. In following the trail of his wife Tessa after her death, Justin revisits his relationship with her.  We see how they met and how their love grew, and we see the passionate woman Tessa was -- passionate about many things. On his journey, Justin rediscovers his wife and his love for her, and he discovers just how much she loved him as well. He learns, along the way, how he could have loved her better. The ending, while sad in a sense, is also beautiful and very moving. It's the only way it could have ended to complete its story.

This is a movie about secrets -- political secrets and the secrets of global economies, but also about the intimate secrets lovers keep, between one another and from one another. Though it may seem like a political story on the surface, it is really the story of a passionate love between two people, one which doesn't end even in death. Though it may be uncomfortably intimate at times, in the end it is a beautiful, heartbreaking film, and worth watching more than once.",1178323200,,2826,4.479611650485437

I shut this movie off about 3/4 of the way through which is rare for me. I usually see things through but this was killing me. The pacing was lost, the plot didn't know what to do, and the main character just didn't have seemingly any emotion or care as to what was going on.

The film starts with scenes from about halfway through the movie which is fine...but then the film repeatedly jumps forward and then backwards. Thats OK I guess but it has to be done right and this wasn't. There was a disconnect with the plot and nothing really advances. There was little or no build-up of suspense or real action. The main character just plodded along trying to piece together what happend to his wife which was entirely obvious from the get go unless you were born yesterday.  Except for one scene the main character didn't seem extremely distressed over the death of his wife, it was like ""Yeah, thats too bad.""

Also, the wife apparently had some affairs with one or possibly two other characters which of course now paints her as a canniving skank that deserves to get burned to bits. The ""Evil corporation"" card was being played here as well which most normal people are growing tired of. Honestly, a drug company doing tests on real humans and using them as guinea pigs right out in the open has a ZERO chance of happening so it was sort of unbelievable right from the get go.

For those that liked this film, hey whatever...to each his own. Some people commented on the beauty of the cinematography. Even that was somewhat underwhelming and even if it was really ""pretty"", there was little substance so that alone cannot make for a good film.

2453106,4,B000C65Z20,"This film is extremely beautiful. The poverty in Africa is contrasted against the beautiful African people, the wonderful African children, and the stunning African landscape. The film is full of wonderful images of African cities and countryside.

This film is extremely well directed. This is basically a murder mystery with an international scale. The pieces of the mystery are pulled together carefully and in an intelligent manner that keeps the viewer quessing while also keeping the viewer informed so that they do not lose track of the action. The cuts from interiors to exteriors, serenity to action, vista to close-up, are all masterfully done.

The acting is superb, with Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes at their best. She plays the rich angry activist who over speaks and over commits. He is a more intellectual careful diplomat who is driven to bold brave action as he tries to discover who killed his wife and why.

So if the photography, scenery, acting, and directing are all so excellent, why did I give it just 4 stars? I gave the film 4 stars primarily because of the shaky premise on which La Carre developed this plot. As we now know, TB is the major world killer of HIV infected persons. Medications to treat the treatment resistant strains of TB are crucial. In this film, a British pharmaceutical giant is testing a high powered TB medication on persons infected with HIV without consent and while some people are cured, many are dying from side effects of the powerful medication. This is so outlandish that it undermines the whole excellent film. Testing drugs without voluntary informed consent is no longer done and a pharmaceutical company that violated this rule would be in a heap of international trouble. The consequences of being caught are so great that no pharmaceutical company would ever do this. Secondly, in the film, those persons who are HIV positive and die of the side-effects of the drug are hidden in secret graves. Again, this is nonsense since licensure of medications requires extensive medical case records of those who did and did not receive the drugs.  If those persons who died from side effects are deleted from the data-base, the medication may then be deemed efficacious when in fact it is not. However, once licensed, and side effects emerge, the lawsuits would destroy the pharmaceutical company. There is really no incentive to hide side effects, distort the data, and then face a industry destroying crisis when the true effects of the medication are later discovered.

This is an enjoyable suspenceful mystery showing a man propelled into brave action due to the incredible grief he feels for the loss of his wife and his desire to try to discover why she was killed. I just wish the central premise conducted by the bad guys was more realistic.",1170633600,,2806,4.9113924050632916

2453113,1,B000C65Z20,"One of 2005 most disappointing films. Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles had made before the great gangster film ""Cidade do Deus"" about the brutal life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. So expectations were high for his second film. Alas, he choose as its material a recent novel by John Le Carre, an exciting writer of spy novels in the 60s and 70s, but someone who has since the 90s been very disappointing in his work, turning the moral ambiguity of his earlier books into shrill indictments of the West in his later ones (not that he does not have a few points here and there in those books). So, from this unpromising material, Meirelles has made a truly awful movie. Basically, the plot is about a timid British diplomat (Ralph Fiennes) trying to solve the murder of his activist wife in Kenya (Rachel Weisz, playing an insufferably smug individual). Fiennes character eventually finds that she was on the track of evil western pharmaceutical companies testing new drugs on African patients without obtaining their fully informed consent - not Africa's most pressing issue. What is most disturbing about this movie, though, is that Africans are basically used as props, useful for the filmmakers to show their superior moral status over other whites. Africans are at most exotic objects here, not subjects of their own lives. You never get to hear their own voices in this film.",1166832000,,1385,4.872881355932203

Justin begins a quest to retrace his wife's steps and discover the true story of her death. It was an interesting plot woven of world health issues, record profits for pharmaceutical companies, and international political intrigue.

First of all, the performance are wonderful. Weisz is luminous as Tessa. She is probably the true anchor of the film. Fiennes gives a nuanced performance as Justin, although I did find some plot-related motivations towards the end to be a little less than satisfying. Also, the environment of Africa is practically its own character in this film.

Unlike movies starring Pierce Brosnan or Mel Gibson, the hero doesn't start shooting everyone in his path and showing up in exactly the right spot with the right clue to bring the ""bad guys"" crashing to the ground.

Ralph Fiennes is a British Diplomat in Africa. When his wife is murdered in unusual circumstances, he starts looking into her death and what information she might have had that could have led to her being killed.

What results is a fascinating look into big pharmaceutical companies and their desire to make money regardless of the cost to human life. On top of that is the idea that maybe we can't help everyone that is in need, but as Rachel Weisz's character remarks to her husband: ""These are three people that we CAN help, right now.""

2453159,5,B000C65Z20,"Giant pharmaceutical companies come under scrutiny - some might say attack - in this fast moving political thriller based on the novel by John le Carre. I remember seeing a number of documentaries round about the time this movie was released in cinemas, that questioned the motives and methods of ""Big Pharma"", particularly in the way they work in third world countries. I remember one documentary in particular looking at one company that was testing drugs on children in northern Nigeria, usually the children of illiterate parents, by promising them cures and getting them to sign consent forms that they couldn't read. In that context, this movie seems to know exactly what it's talking about, hitting the nail squarely on the head.

The phenomenal ""City of God"" director Fernando Meirelles (who showed us the slums of Rio de Janeiro in a completely new light) brings his distinctive visual style to a very exciting story, filmed in Kenya, with twists and turns I could never have seen coming in a million years. Activist Tessa Quayle (played by Rachel Weisz) is murdered and her diplomat husband Justin (played by Ralph Fiennes), who up until that point seems rather hesitant when it came to local affairs, becomes suspicious that she was killed because of what she knew and what she could do with that information and becomes determined to get to the bottom of what led up to her getting killed. He gets right stuck in with no thought of risk to himself.

The story unfolds in a series of flashbacks and while it is said that le Carre novels are notoriously difficult to adapt, Meirelles handles the material superbly, knowing what subplots to keep and which to discard. Even so, it is not an easy plot to follow is not for the faint-hearted. It requires complete concentration but the final result is an edge of your seat thrill and I'm so glad I got this on DVD. I know I'm going to want to watch it again soon and again later. By the way, Weisz won a well-deserved supporting actress Oscar for her role in the movie.

Perfectly cast, Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz's limitations work for the roles for once: his awkward, half-apologetic shtick and her over-zealous head girl act are as right here as they are irritating in too many other films. Not all the casting or performances are as good, however, with Bill Nighy showing again why he's better in light comedy than in straight drama.

The journey of an activist in Africa can easily be frought with danger.  Exposing a far-reaching conspicacy that compromises public health is a powerful subject.  One mans quest to uncover the truth and honor his dearly departed partner is a moving trip through the twists and turns of a complicated crime.  The coverup is something that could easily happen in real life.  It wouldn't be the first time that corporate greed compromised the public good.  While there is heartfelt vindication in the movies conclusion it is still sad.  There is no happy ending or lasting satisfaction.  But it is a grim reminder that courage no matter how worthwhile can get you killed in the modern world.  The value of human life is something that powerful people denigrate on a daily basis.  It is hoepful that this movie will strike a chord in the minds of the public opinion.  Question all motives at all times.  Keep a vigil out for the sick and helpless.  Sometimes a crisis in underdeveloped countries will go on festering for years.  It is on our watch that people everywhere should have someone to count on when there is a crisis.  The world owes those less fortunate to have a helping hand extended towards them.  This one man teaches a lesson we should never forget.  Always question those in power and hold them accountable.  Activism is a altruistic crusade that is much needed and deeply appreciated.  This movie makes you remember that and is must see viewing.  It is a sad reminder of what can go wrong in the modern world.  If only there was retribution more often in the real world.  For those who live in well-developed countries they have much to be thankful for and much to be expected of them.

This is definitely an anti-drug company movie. This movieis a slam on the drug companies in the same way the Davinci Code was a slam to the Catholic church, it makes the powers that be look like greedy, power hungry hypocrites.

Equally intrigued, Tessa follows Justin to Africa, where they are married, although the newlywed husband harbors some distrust for Arnold, the African doctor with whom Tessa works. Justin allows himself to be blinded to her passions on behalf of the Africans, her interest in the rampant spread of disease and the exploitation by government-sponsored pharmacological corporations, great conglomerates who make available the currently used drugs on a massive scale.

While accompanying Arnold on his rounds in the townships, Tessa makes a stunning discovery, but pursues it without informing Justin, hoping to shelter him from any fallout. When Tessa and Arnold go on a trip to the interior, Justin is informed that there has been an incident: his wife is killed, Arnold missing, the implication that they had been on a tryst. Through the merest chance and the efforts of Tessa's brother, Justin begins unraveling the thread of his wife's discovery, pursued at every turn by threats.

Essentially this starts out as a liberal propaganda piece against every issue imaginable.  It does , however, develop into a compelling story with a lot of graphic and stunning cinematography

Things are not quite as they seem as you watch this movie and that is why I give it a high rating.  The movie effectively uses your biases to lead and mislead your perceptions throughout the story.

The basic plot is that a diplomat's activist wife is brutally raped and murdered.  Your job is to figure out who did it and why.  There are lots of twists and turns and a climatic finish.

Just remember this is a movie and is not based on any sort of true story nor does it claim to be.  In movies there can be villains of all sorts and you do not necessarily have to object to this one just because of political views. I am sure you have seen the Fugitive and the bad guys in that were of the same sort.  Personally I believe the wife's political views to be misguided at best and in the real world alienate those that actually help her causes.

A final thought (a friend's actually, but I like it) for those of you that complain about the cost of medicine.  When you start your own company and produce your own medicines, you can feel free to charge whatever you want.

2453204,3,B000C65Z20,"I have great admiration for the performance of Ralph Fiennes here. He treads the fine line between compromised (nearly feminized) British diplomat and impassioned defender of his wife's honor and principles. That he comes to acknowledge her love for him as the unquestioned given of the film is what finally redeems him and this movie as well. The quasi-erotic rendering of the African continent is also an enormous virtue. A beautiful film in many ways, especially in the cinematography and the rhythm of the scenes as one blends into another. Also, I love the musical background.

Still, it's just too d**n tilted against Europe. In this movie, a British accent simply condemns a guy, and the representation of the pharmaceutical industry is finally too easy and politically correct. Wouldn't you guess: It's all about the bottom line, unless it's about love (for which read sex). Presumably this perspective derives from John LeCarre's novel, but that doesn't justify it. Even set against the substantial virtues of the film from an acting and cinematographical point of view, the limited politics keep it from being a five or even a four-star movie.",1153180800,,1153,5.1005291005291005

And the movie, based on the famous John Le Carre's novel shows us many people consider this region of the planet as a huge field for experimentation, due the statistics may minimize, hide or even transfigure the most awful reality, in the name of any label, belief or ideology you wish imagine. Its undeniable potentialities have always been a succulent motive of greed; you may think in diamonds, raw material for nuclear weapons or even become a living laboratory for testing new technological devices, because after all, who really cares if any native from this continent might die?

The strange deaths of many countrymen in Nairobi will be the dramatic core of this intriguing, brave and lugubrious portrait about a chilling reality. Potent script, bravura performances from all the cast, and a very interesting camera handle, that combines elements that featured the cinema verit (with the camera on the shoulders, remarking the dramatic vision through nervous displacements), wondrous narrative ellipsis and formidable traveling, ravishing photography and emblematic close ups.

2453208,5,B000C65Z20,"Genre: The Interpreter, The X-Files, CBS 60 MINUTES (Darfur stories), owning a rental period of customer patronage I think shall suffice this analysis h'yar...

In group psychology, the element of primacy is essential to maintain control of group role play and dominance.  Films about Africa are of characteristically foreign, anglo, English speaking affluence to American and world audiences.  What this tell us is that what we can gather from the Bush administration's not only lack of any domestic conception other than price fix and gouge gasoline prices, expropriate the budget for corporate expeditions and so forth, their is no foreign diplomacy tolerated from America regarding Africa.  Likewise America is not to enter into bilateral recognition of North Korea other than to perhaps recommend a safe and optimally media placed stunt with inadequate rocketry, as Rice no doubt also recommended sub rosa agreements to Iran to take a defiant stance after her whirlwind tour of backward bridge under the card table.

Then again, any higher thinking on the matter might be appreciated more along the lines of moronic American crime television, the title itself: The Constant Gardener, might be found loaded with overt suggestion of latent homosexuality, like: The constant hairdresser...The consummate quiche recipe...The constant fashion monitor...or The constant showtune collector.

One thing's for sure though, American's superiors are in control of all the panic and chaos abroad.  And to make that all the more clear to American audiences, a seat has been reserved for British accent on every television no-talent contest; their presence and its eminent associativity (neurolingual programming being extremely provocative to human intelligence in many forms it takes) is foisted on us quite peculiarly unless we take into account these other factors at work in mass entertainment media that dramatize and misinform the picture of goings on in the larger world.  And always, always, as is true of every American tv programming week's killing and crime spree indoctrination, stiff coercion must be applied, coercion to suggest that fearless manipulator (rather than constant gardener) will just trapse around killing anybody it wants, or even anybody it want to silence.

Well the other day I was considering the more deliberate course for Senator Hatch's flag burning bill to have been constructed in prohibition for burning not the American flag, but rather the more offensive one, the British ""Union Jack"".  I mean Mr. Hatch is the constant salesman and does always arm-twist the power of suggestion Americans burn their own flag, obviously because it's the safer one to burn for all he cares.

The movie looks at scenes something similar to the genocide in Darfur.  60 MINUTES showed everyone the satellite image of all the pinpoint laser guided munitions craters, which everyone knows was so well demonstrated in the First Gulf War, and that would require a rather sophisticated aircraft also complained about by those people (and reported by 60 MINUTES), a plane attacking at night under the cover of darkness so as not to be photographed for any misbehaviors it might implicate.  Perhaps arms sales of stealth bombers to some foreign entity?

The AIDS epidemeology and medical response has drawn question in America as well, it looks to many people like a feeding frenzy for drug manufacturers rather than methodical anti-viral immunological approach.  I think we can talk about that can't we...without some creep in a bowler turning up around the corner with his poison umbrella...hopefully as charming, and yes...masculine...petty...petty little tyrannist gardeners...and for that, I shall force you to read American scripture:

""I have as little superstition in me as any man living, but my secret opinion has ever been, and still is, that God Almighty will not give up a people to military destructions, or leave them unsupportedly to perish, who have so earnestly and so repeatedly sought to avoid the calamities of war, by every decent method which wisdom could invent.  Neither have I so much of the infidel in me to suppose that he has relinquished the government of the world, and given us up to the care of devils; and as I do not, I cannot see on what grounds the king of Britain can look up to heaven for help against us; a common murderer, a highwayman, or a housebreaker has as much pretense as he...""

2453210,2,B000C65Z20,"Unlike The English Patient, which was AMAZING, The Constant Gardener was a quite a disappointment.

The film sheds light (as it should do) on the reality of major pharmaceutical companies' dirty dealings in the third world with the support of various governments. More importantly it does a good job of showing who is, more often than not, behind the various plots, schemes, and wars, not to mention how corrupt the world has become, and how tragic conditions really are in most of Africa.

Ralph Fiennes' performance was surprisingly (!) average, while the rest of the cast seem totally out of place.

As for the characters, they are weak, bland and just plain uninteresting.

Moreover, it seems as though the chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz is not all that great.  To that, one has to add the poor dialogues and the bad choice of lines that the actors are given.  In addition, Bill Nighy who was wonderful in Love Actually and the Underworld trilogy has his talent go to waste in this film.

Other setbacks are in relation to:

1) Ralph Fiennes' character was a major pushover bordering on ludicrous.

2) Rachel Weisz who does not seem to belong in this movie.

3) Rachel Weisz' character who overdoes it in all respects, becoming VERY annoying, very early on!  Give me a break!

4) The weak first half of the movie as opposed to the rest of the film.

5) The writers/director lacking the ability to... write and direct.

In short, the acting is average, the setting is good, the plot is interesting (could have been amazing!), while the dialogues are below average.

Though the potential for a good movie was there it fails to take off.

Fernando Meirelles creates a web of paranoia, political intrigue and an interesting and haunting love story all rolled into one beautiful looking film that captures the spirit and the landscape of the African nation. Rachel Weisz not only cements herself as one of the most powerful, versatile and talented actors of her generation with her performance but also raises the stakes highly in this taunt, scary and ultimately tragic love story. Weisz not only makes you believe in her character but also makes you aware of the power of the human spirit. Her co-star Ralph Fiennes is just as good with a role that is a mixture of vulnerability and courage and his performance is the best of his career. Weisz and Fiennes carry this picture into the heart of darkness, corruption and lies and they both bring the viewer along for the ride and Meirelles gives this ride a touch of realism that is refreshing and disturbing all at the same time.

Anyway, it's about conspiracy among powerful pharmaceutical companies. Weisz plays a radical who tries to stir things up for the companies and force them to take more precautions when helping people in Africa. Ralph plays her husband who is the total opposite and wants nothing more than to live his comfortable life and tend his garden. This is one of those movies that makes you feel like you're helping just by watching. The only thing I didn't like was that Bill Nighy played a bad guy.

2453213,4,B000C65Z20,"`The Constant Gardener' is based on a John le Carr novel of the same title, and is sometimes referred to as a thriller, but what you see in this beautifully-shot film is not exactly about the secrets of murder or the cover-up of the government. The film's content might look in fact nothing new for those who are interested in Africa and its problems, and the thriller part itself often sounds rather conventional to those who have seen the films of the genre.

`The Constant Gardener' is most impressive when it shows the love story between the married couple - mild-mannered British diplomat Justin and idealistic activist Tessa both living in Kenya. Right at the beginning of the story, Justin is told that his wife is killed while driving a truck with another man. While following the orthodox course of thriller with the determined protagonist investigating the truths behind her death, the film's first part, fragmented with skillful editing, shows in occasional flashbacks how these two people met in London, and how they see the world differently.

Rachel Weisz received an Oscar for the part she seamlessly fits in, and you will soon realize that she well-deserves the award. That doesn't mean that Ralph Fiennes is not good. The fact is this is one of his best performances in his recent films. Virtually the film's emotional power stems from superb acting from them and other capable supports including Danny Huston and Bill Nighy. Plus, the film's realistic look of Africa often reaches the territory of documentary, shot in the real shantytown and real people in there, but the film also does not forget that the film is basically a thriller with constant supply of surprises and mysteries.

Not every surprise and mystery work, though. The mystery itself is plausible, but as the gripping story goes on, the film in the second half sometimes relies on the hackneyed methods like computer hacking and a wizard kid. Fast cut and semi-documentary touch barely hides it, but the core of the story is pretty conventional political thriller, something that you might have read somewhere else.

But the most touching part (and least conventional part too) is the Justin's quest for the truths about the meaning of his wife's life. Only at the very end, and at the very right place, he comes to understand Tessa and her value. He pays the price, and some might think the price is too high, but surely the film has made a point.

Rachel Weisz deservedly won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her impassioned, heartfelt portrayal of Tessa, but why was Ralph Fiennes left behind.  The chemistry between the two actors is mesmerizing and captivating.  You can truly feel the love he has for her, and ultimately long for them to connect until tragedy strikes, and sets a series of events into motion. Combining passion, tragedy, beauty, love, and a serious examination of pharmaceutical industries, all executed in seamless fashion, The Constant Gardener ranks as an unforgettable film that will stand the test of time.",1149638400,,872,5.119718309859155
2453227,3,B000C65Z20,"At its simplest, The Constant Gardener can be classified as both a political thriller and a haunting romance. While both genres could have made for great films by themselves, their fusion here seems to result in nearly as many conflicts as it does accomplishments.

The story concerns Justin, a British diplomat, whose life is shattered when his wife, a zealous activist, is found brutally murdered in Africa. While struggling for clues to her murder, Justin discovers she has been playing a critical role in uncovering the truth behind a pharmaceutical company drug testing on African residents. His journey will lead him to not only uncover a deadly conspiracy but secrets about his late wife that will take him to places he never could have imagined.

This summary can't even begin to relay all the complex facets within Fernando Meirelles's skillfully directed piece. Stars Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz give heartfelt performances while instilling the film with its most commendable quality; a profoundly acted marital portrait. Fiennes (who always seems to elicit such smoldering chemistry with his romantic co- stars) is devastating as Justin- a once passive minded widower whose life takes on new meaning in the wake of his wife's death. Rachel Weisz is luminous as Tessa- the ill fated activist whose spirit haunts the film. Both actors understand their characters to the fullest extent- giving us clues as to why two people of such opposing personalities would spark such a passionate connection. Audiences will be privy to casual yet unsettlingly intimate moments between the impassioned couple.

Hence, when the narrative flips back and fourth to the film's political conspiracy our emotions are jolted while we have to catch up with the increasingly complex plot lines. As Justin drives deeper into a world of political corruption where intrigued enough to care but perhaps the filmmakers could have transitioned the films subplots in a more coherent manner.

Yet ultimately the films pros outdo its cons and the end result is, for the most part, a beautifully crafted film. The cinematography is nothing short of astonishing- as it is in most of Meirelles's films. The camera seems to pick up every layer of Africa's searing terrain with a raw intensity. Featuring a stellar cast and visionary director, The Constant Gardener emerges a film as beautiful and thought provoking as its final, poignant scene.",1149465600,,2420,5.181585677749361
2453228,5,B000C65Z20,"While I do not love this film as much as many others do, I think it is superbly acted and powerfully told.  It is the actual story with the ""big pharma"" companies as stand ins for the Nazis or the Commies.  Really.  John LeCarre uses authorial anger as a stand in for facts and clear seeing or understanding.  It is a movie that says that drug companies would sacrifice human lives in Africa to bring a faulty drug to market so they can lose billions upon billions of dollars to law suits, fines, and credibility once the faulty drug kills people in the rich West.  Does this make sense to you?  But of course this is the kind of thing you are supposed to feel rather than think about.  And that anyone gets sick and dies in the entire world has to be someone's fault, right?  Everyone would live forever in Eden if it weren't for wicked businessmen and the politicians they own.  Yeah, right.

Ralph Fiennes is absolutely wonderful as the government diplomat, Justin Quayle.  Seemingly, he is all diplomatic avoidance, but underneath he is quite strong.  Justin is all about what goes on under the surface.  From his conversations we learn that his family has been in the government diplomatic corps for generations and that he has not been a particularly brilliant or ambitious diplomat.  He does love to garden and is passionate about keeping weeds out of his garden.  Hence the title.

Rachel Weisz plays Tessa Quayle, Justin's love and wife.  We only see her in current time briefly.  The rest of the film, her role is in flashback.  Tessa is a very charismatic young woman who is passionate about her causes to the brink of nuttiness.  The questions are, has she become unbalanced, is she using Justin for some other purpose and cuckolding him, or is there something else she is onto?  What is it the she and Dr. Arnold Bluhm (Herbert Kound) are up to?  Romance?  These are the mysteries of the film and different parts of the film seem to push us into different paths.

Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston) is Justin's longtime friend and seems to be there all along the way to support Justin.  However, the question about Sandy is whether he is trying to manipulate Justin or whether he really believes the path he is trying to encourage Justin to take.

There are other spies, government bullies, and all kinds of paranoia inducing technologies that are almost standard spy stuff anymore, but it is used well to enhance the drama of the movie.

I found the ending the Justin chooses for himself rather sad and unsatisfying.  It seems to me that he would have honored Tessa more by taking a more defiant and life affirming stance.  Still, what Justin accomplishes with Tessa's cousin makes for a powerful affirmation, but I simply don't think Justin should have chosen the ending he did.  Too nihilistic a romantic conclusion for my taste.  You might certainly feel differently, and that is perfectly fine with me.

This is a very well acted and dramatically satisfying drama that really does rise above the mystery-spy genre.  That is, once you get past the nonsense of connecting the bad guys of the story with any bad guys in real life.  Don't do it!

The ""R"" Rating is for some gruesome scenes of the results of violence and a few romantic flashback scenes between Justin and the pregnant and nude Tessa in and out of the bath.",1148688000,,3331,4.626279863481229

There's little more here than the old Hollywood standby ""evil profit mongering corporation driven by a corrupt CEO and/or politician"".  Typically, this leaves only the context and the characters involved in the struggle as the fresh and interesting aspects of the movie.

The context and setting works well enough...the cinematography was attractive and much time is devoted to depicting the plight of poverty and the struggle to live amidst rampant disease and lawlessness in remote Africa.  You also get a good sense of what aid workers (or anyone else helping in those regions) are up against...the numbers are so overwhelming that you know you can't help them all, but what if you can help this one right here, right now?  How do you choose which ones to help and when?  When do you bend the rules, and what are the consequences?  Thought provoking notions in refreshingly compact dialog that doesn't get too preachy.

Ultimately, the characters involved fail to drive the movie, and that's a problem since there's not a lot of fast-paced action happening as the coverup is unravelled (as you get in something like ""The Bourne Identity""), so the characters are all you really have.  The most notable flaw is the fact that the timeline jumps around on the main characters too much for you to build an adequate sense of what they're about or to care what happens to them.  Tessa's anti-Iraq rantings felt a little too much like a trendy Hollywood copout instead of a solid backdrop for her political motivations.  Is she more interested in helping and protecting the disadvantaged?  Or simply sticking it to the establishment?  Sure, the two intersect frequently...but you never get a true sense of what is truly driving her.  Justin works a little better as the ""Constant Gardener"", just oblivious to everything going on under his nose until he quite passively uncovers Tessa's involvment in the drug testing coverup and decides to finish what she started to honor her memory.  But still, he does it with far less punch than other memorable wife-avenging widowers like ""Braveheart"" and ""The Fugitive"".

It makes you think about what we're doing for the lives of millions in Africa. It's necessary to take in mind that money and politics must not be over life.

Yeah, the world is so disgusting. But this film does not rejoice in showing gratuitous deaths, sadness and poverty. Faces of these people seem happy and confident about a better future.

But this is not only a film for denouncing life condition in Africa. It's the story of an activist and a diplomat. It's about love, confidence and faith.

The twists of the political story are easy to preview. But not in the love story, in which nothing is as you can imagine. Justin (Ralph Fiennes) seems to be so worried about his carrer and Tessa (Rachel Weisz) seems to be so worried about her ideals. The difference of age between both is another false clue about their romance. Their love is much important than this.

I have really liked this film. The book which inspired the film is a very good one. It's no wonder, knowing the author is John Le Carre. The soundtrack is also brilliant, and could have won the Oscar instead of ""Brokeback Mountain"".

She challenges him with such pointed and angry questions about British policy that the audience gets up in clusters to leave.  Keeping his composure and his diplomatic skills, he speaks calmly enough to disarm her.  From here they have a passionate affair, then quickly marry. Soon later she insists that he takes her on one of his African diplomatic voyages.

She challenges the status quo of bureaucracy, greed, and indifference, and it is this match up that gets her deeply into trouble.  And it is trouble that Justin inherits as he tries to unravel the mystery of his wife's disappearance and slaying.  The clues he comes upon tell us even more about the troubles in Africa than they do about his wife.

This is a socially conscious movie that does weave intrigue and suspense well throughout.  The panoramic views of the colorful African landscape and people are inspiring enough, and the entertainment is crafted in a way that is engaging and edgy.

2453248,3,B000C65Z20,"Here's another highly praised film that left me, if not cold, at least not much more than tepid. Several flaws struck me.

First, I found the love story unconvincing, and once again, not about love at all. Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz get together way too fast. Or it seems fast. The general chronologically fractured structure of this movie often leaves the viewer with no sense of how much time has elapsed. So it appears that one moment, Weisz is in Fiennes' classroom, flirting, asking to go along with him to Africa. And the next moment, there they are together, in the thick of Africa's medical dilemmas.

Or actually, the two are not really there together at all. Contrary to the great love story that many people claim to find in this film, I found only separate tables. Fiennes and Weisz seem to be pursuing different paths from the start. They don't confide in each other about certain dangers, presumably to ""protect"" each other. But their lack of communication more often seems to derive from actual hostility, which flares palpably on more than one occasion. So where is the great love story?

Then another flaw is that the movie once again conjures the corporate executive as nearly invincible boogieman. There is no nuance in the evil of these men. And once again, they are omniscient and omnipresent, capable of commanding the gruesome murder of anyone hundreds of miles away, who so much as whispers a thought that would reduce their profit margins.

Finally, gratuitous red herrings are cast into the mix. For example, there is the hospital scene where Weisz is shown holding a baby. That's misleading for no good reason.

This movie does give a strikingly different view of the African landscape though. It's not the usual landscape we see on nature specials, with a herd of giraffes loping in front of a beautiful sunset. And it's not the jungle that some Tarzan enthusiasts still equate with Africa. The area where this movie was shot is a vast, parched moonscape. Being projected onto this ground for just the hours of the movie gives the viewer a sense of searing dearth. Our teenagers, whose biggest problem is often choosing between a Gucci or a Pucci handbag, seem as if they are growing up not thousands, but millions of miles from the present African generation.

So the film does wake the viewer up to some harsh realities. But on the whole, the constant gardener has too many weeds growing in his plot.",1147564800,,2434,4.7695961995249405

2453250,4,B000C65Z20,"In the tradition of ""Z,"" ""All the President's Men"" and ""The Quiet American,"" ""The Constant Gardener"" is a political message movie that comes packaged as a taut, gripping whodunit.  The ""message"" in this case is about how pharmaceutical companies often put profits ahead of patient safety and human life, especially in the Third World where many of the drugs are tested - on the assumption that the people there are somehow more ""dispensable"" than people in the West.

Ralph Fiennes plays Justin Quayle, a British diplomat sent to Kenya along with his new wife, Tessa, a human rights activist played by Oscar-winner Rachel Weisz.  When Tessa suddenly turns up dead, Justin begins to wonder if perhaps his wife had found out a little bit more than she was supposed to know regarding a huge drug company's dealings in that part of the world.

Even though I have no clue as to whether or not this story is even remotely plausible (though I suspect it most likely is), ""The Constant Gardener,"" nevertheless, works very well as both a nail biting political thriller and a  complex human drama.  Running along both tracks simultaneously, the film opens our eyes to the possibility that the people and institutions we trust with our lives and our futures may not, in actuality, have our best interests at heart.  As Justin follows the clues to his wife's murder, a depressing picture of ignoble motives and corporate malfeasance slowly emerges.

But it is as a human drama that ""The Constant Gardener"" truly excels.  Justin is a man who, even though he has thrust himself onto the world's stage as a potentially major player, is actually little more than a bureaucratic cipher, content to go through life doing other people's bidding, causing no ripples and spending his time nurturing and cultivating the plants in his garden.  Tessa, on the other hand, is a fervid activist, quick to speak her mind on issues of social injustice and unafraid of taking on the powers-that-be, even if that means upsetting the applecart and endangering her own life.  Based on the John Le Carre novel, the Jeffrey Caine screenplay turns Tessa into an enigmatic figure who fascinates us with both her beauty and her air of mystery.  Even Justin doesn't always know what to make of her, but we can certainly understand why he and most of the other men in the movie are hopelessly drawn to her.  Weisz, who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this performance, does a beautiful job capturing the many moods of the character, and Fiennes gives his usual outstanding performance as the naturally passive man ultimately jolted by circumstances into taking a proactive stand against injustice.

As with any adaptation of a Le Carre work, ""The Constant Gardener"" may be a trifle too slick for its own good at times, but excellent writing and acting help to bring the message forcefully home.",1146441600,,2862,4.862139917695473
2453251,5,B000C65Z20,"God I wish this movie won the best picture! It's interesting, the actings were GREAT (Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisez just took my breath away!) and its thriller is SO intense that I had to hold my breath, and the cinomatography GOSH it's BEAUTIFUL!!

Fiennes captured that perfect British well-mannered gentleman who constantly buried his inner conflict due to suspicion of his wife's disloyalty, and the hearbreaking breakdown and remorse when he found out the truth. This gotta be the first actor on a movie who gives me the goosebumps and makes me just admires him so.

Rachel Weisez is as gorgeous and great as always, she's one of my favorite actress of all time, so frickin talented!!

The ending was a little disappointing for me, yes I get it, the guy is going to die, most likely horribly (alas!). But still, ANOTHER cliffhanger and/or tragic movie?? I guess life just sucks huh?

Alot of people complained about the whole conspiracy is a little dumb, but seriously, stuff like this do happen, ya never know, I only know that, the only reason this film didn't even get nominated as a best picture is because Hollywood DESPERATELY trying to stay away from conversial stuff, the fact that Brokeback Mountain didn't win SO proved it. I mean, think about it, look back, which movie in the past that won best picture is controversial?

Anyways this movie took my breath away, I didn't think I would like it as much, but I LOVED it, much more than the four best-picture nominated (of course including the won one-Crash) movie I've seen.

Weitz was the best thing in it. She was passionate and natural. Fiennes
is not a favorite of mine - but was good enough.

My main fault was the endless tracking shots of the poverty and filth
with the crowded towns and hovels people lived in. Set the scene, for
Gods sake, and get on with the story.

That one looooooong shot after they first get to Africa was magnificent
in setting the mood and driving the point home. But the director was
not satisfied, and kept going over and over it, until I just didn't
care any more.

Hard hearted - maybe. But it is the directors business to know when
enough is enough.

The cast overall was very good and all the character actors did a fine
job. Cinematography was fine too, showing the endless sun searing the

shown magnificently.

But this movie is so heavy-handed it was painful. It bleeds for Africa, from the European man's point of view. It's brilliant of course, but it sees things so definitely through the lens of middle class guilt that it's hard to cope with if you've ever actually been poor.

It's about pharmecutical companies doing illegal things with a TB cure in a third world country, the death of a woman and the lengths her husband goes to when he finds out he hardly knew this woman he loved and married.

And it's so overwrought, so fast-paced when it should have been slow and meditative.

Fernando Meirelles creates a web of paranoia, political intrigue and a interesting and haunting love story all rolled into one beautiful looking film that captures the spirit and the landscape of the African nation. Rachel Weisz not only cements herself as one of the most powerful and talented actors around with her performance but also raises the stakes highly in this taunt, scary and ultimately tragic love story. Weisz not only makes you believe in her character but also makes you aware of the power of the human spirit. Her co-star Ralph Fiennes is just as good with a role that is a mixture of vulnerability and courage and his performance is the best of his career. Weisz and Fiennes carry this picture into the heart of darkness, corruption and lies and they both bring the viewer along for the ride and Meirelles gives this ride a touch of realism that is refreshing and disturbing all at the same time.

The real problem, is that you don't care about the wife who is found murdered. She is an unlikeable character; I couldn't wait for her to exit the movie. She is obnoxious, secretive, and you just don't fully trust her. What ruined it for me, is that Ralph Fienne's character gives up his life to find a wife who was a virtual stranger to him; he didn't even know her.

2453256,5,B000C65Z20,"This marvelous film's detractors, almost universially, either take issue with the plausibility of its pharmaceutical company bad-business plot thread, or accept that aspect in theory, but found a feature-length geo-economic lecture dry and boring.

I'm fascinated by these objections, because the film I watched wasn't quite about pharmceutical scandals. The film I watched assumed its viewers understood and accepted that high-flying, well-monied, western-world industrialists would always be tempted to exploit vulnerable third-world folks on the ground, and uses this stipulation as the backdrop for an incredibly potent love story.

Accpeting the reality of this sort of exploitation, and reflecting upon the terrible pain of those caught in the crossfire are different things, ""The Constant Gardner"" reminds viewers. Rachel Weiss' doomed heroine understands this. She's a great character--an astute, passionate young woman fully engaged in the lives of the African villagers she deals with daily at a health clinic. Her husband, by contrast, is a perfectly good man, but also perfectly pragmatic, systematic, respectful of authority, cautious and quiet to a fault.

What drives the film along is the incredibly observed and authentic way the quiet husband slowly adopts his late wife's sensibilities--it requires a terrible jolt, but when the man who never so much as shouts or doubles with laughter finally sinks to his knees and cries, it's devastating filmaking.

This isn't a story about the suffering woven by evil coroporations. It's a story about dynamic individuals navigating those ugly threads, falling in love, and slowly, painfully, if a bit too late, learning understand each other.

If, at movie's end, the viewer also elects to trace those threads back and resent the possibility that western economic interests exploit third-world citizens, all the better.",1145750400,,1877,5.618374558303887

Moreover, a film that rewards the attention of its viewers with fine details that pay off with subtlety-- not by hammering the less attentive over the head. The director trusts the careful attention of the committed movie goer rather than lower the bar for the home video viewer juggling home tasks while paying only slight attention to the television.

The payoff is a story that begins as a sketch in the vaguest of terms and comes to life over the course of its running time. It can't have been an easy task for the actors to deliver the dawning awarenesses at so many levels but as I've already said these performances are simply as good as one finds in today's features.

Rarely does a feature film satisfy with the resounding force that a novel can deliver, but this one delivers the goods. Based on the universally positive reviews and awards I was expecting a good time at the movies but my expectations were exceeded. I suspect this is one of those films that will stay with me for a while. Truly a masterful achievement, and hopefully one that will inspire other filmmakers to continue to raise the bar rather than lower it for our ADD society.",1145664000,,1322,4.819383259911894
2453260,4,B000C65Z20,"This is a terrific example of shaky material made good by outstanding execution. Fiennes, Weisz, and their supporting cast are all at the top of the game, and the photography is nothing short of breathtaking.

I couldn't, however, take the plot that seriously in terms of its political intrigue. Don't get me wrong. I'm not naive enough to think that Africa isn't being mistreated by western powers and corporations, but to really function as commentary, I have to believe that the pharmacuticle companies have something to gain by their questionable activities.

**SPOILERS** The Constant Gardener has the drug companies spending billions of dollars to test a TB cure they already know is deadly. They have word that TB is going to wipe out the world within the next few years (impossible to predict), and they somehow stand to make a fortune by not spending a few million dollars to make sure they don't wipe out their customers when the drug goes on the market. Therefore, they bribe African governments to approve human testing they plan to discard anyway and organize the murder of our heros, the supersluth diplomats.

In another film, these absurd details would've warranted my overall disapproval, but the focus of the story is not what the bad guys do. It's about how their actions affect the broader interests of the people involved. As Fiennes entangles himself deeper and deeper into the situation, he becomes more and more fascinating, and more and more helpless.

The same goes for Weisz, but to a lesser extent. Her character is such an outspoken liberal that she can barely function in a social setting without getting worked into a frenzy at anyone who disagrees. I've seen this done by both sides of the political spectrum, and it's a great way to alienate people who could potentially share your concerns. There is a scene which suggests that the filmmakers understand this, but the character never seems to figure it out. I have to admit, I was very amused when we first see her in Africa in the middle of a huge crowd with a black toddler in her arms. I wondered if she made a habit of carrying strange children in crowds.

Anyway, a great piece of cinematic technique daunted only by some very big holes in logic. Kudos to Meirelles and the cast, but John le Carr?'s on notice.",1145491200,,2299,4.7808564231738035

2453262,4,B000C65Z20,"Based on John Le Carre's novel, this film adaptation explores the corruption of the corporation and its collusion with big government. What this film communicates so well, is that human life is expendable, when the corporate ""bottom-line"" is in anyway compromised. The extent to which big business will go to ensure a profit, touches the diabolical, and is depicted clearly in this excellent film directed by the famous Brazilian, Fernando Meirelles, whose last film, City of God, won the director international fame.

Justine Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) works for the British High Commission as a diplomat stationed in Nairobi, Kenya. In London he meets the opinionated, idealistic and assertive Tessa (Rachel Weisz) and ends up marrying her joining him in Kenya.

Kenya is a third world country where hunger and disease run rampant, including the HIV virus. Tessa volunteers her time helping a Kenyan doctor supply aid to the impoverished people living in the settlements outside Nairobi. The film was shot in the actual settlement, where there is no electricity, sewerage or clean running water. The word poverty is really an understatement as the conditions reek of disease. Relief for these impoverished people comes in dribs and drabs as aid organizations do what they can, but despite their best efforts, it is never enough.

Justine observes something going on between the Nairobi doctor (Hubert Kounde) and his wife. He chooses, however, not to get involved. Rather than interfere, Justine finds refuge in his garden, his home away from the world. Her behaviour is quite odd, particularly after she sadly looses her baby in childbirth. One can see that this death fuels Tessa's determination to continue on her mission. But what is this mission?

The Nairobian doctor and Tessa have been brutally murdered. Justine becomes determined to discover the reason for his wife's death, which leads him into the dark secrets of corruption within the British government and the big pharmaceutical companies. This is a standard thriller, a ""David and Goliath"" theme between righteous individuals going against the giant corporations, who will do absolutely anything to avoid a scandal and make a profit, including mass murder. But what are they attempting to cover up?

The film's cinematography is excellent, conveying Africa's beauty and its desolate poverty. It is a contrast that translates as a great irony, in which a land so vast and nature-rich contains so much human suffering.

The Constant Gardener is a love story and intense thriller with a very powerful and topical theme. Good entertainment.",1145145600,,2600,5.237980769230769
2453263,4,B000C65Z20,"""The Constant Gardener"" in an involving, character-driven drama with some fine performances.  Ralph Fiennes plays Justin, a British diplomat who is basically a good fellow but would rather focus on his new marriage and gardening hobby than really get involved with the world around him.  Rachel Weisz plays his wife Tessa, who IS very concerned about the world around her, to the occasional frustration of her husband, who wishes she could just relax a bit and enjoy life's simple pleasures.

Tessa dies under mysterious circumstances in the film's opening minutes, and the first hour of the film is mostly a series of flashbacks showing how Justin and Tessa met and their early courtship and marriage, accompanied by the beginnings of Justin's investigation into her death.  The second hour focuses full bore on that investigation.  The film's cleverness and originality comes from the fact that Justin never gets to truly know his wife until his investigation of her death.

Drug companies are the villains of the film, and it was interesting to discover in the DVD's special features section that the story wasn't based on any true-life drug company scandals, but rather novelist John le Carre's dramatic supposition that drug companies WOULD eventually get into the kind of trouble depicted in his book and the subsequent film. In one of the DVD interviews, the author's researcher says, ""I spoke to a few drug company executives, and, amazingly, in confidence they said to me that, yes, the kind of cover ups seen in the story aren't in any way implausible and, in fact, would probably occur if a money-driven situation like the one in the story happened in real life.""

""The Constant Gardener"" does everything a good thriller- indeed, a good movie- should do.  It involves you in its plot, offers complex, interesting characters that the viewer grows to care about, and shows you a few things (locales, professions, situations) you don't see every day.  On that final point, it was nice to see a plot largely set in Africa, though there are many scenes in Great Britain, too.  And, oh yes, Rachel Weisz really deserved the Best Supporting Actress Oscar she ultimately won for her role as Tessa.  She's amazing here.",1144972800,,2221,4.975675675675675

The real high of this film is the romance between the diplomat and his assasinated wife (told in flashback), both Weisz and Fiennes play husband and wife with astonishing tenderness and depth. As the movie evolves we are made to realise more and more the pain of his loss and the true horror of murder, this is cleverly contrasted with the indifferent business as usual attitude of the sociopathic British diplomats who played a role in the killing. Weisz in particular is haunting as the murdered human rights worker. Fiennes' portrayal is nicely nuanced, he is not the bleeding heart humanitarian his wife was and we know this when he forbids his wife to pick up two bereaved Africans who now must walk twenty miles back home from the hospital. The political component of the movie revolves around a dramatic take on the true life practice of drug companies testing their products cheaply on third world subjects, in real life this happens not in a clandestine way but openly and is legitimised by Africa's antiquated laws on pharmaceutical practice. This aspect of the movie is a little underdone, it could have been fleshed out more fully but along the way the scene changes rapidly as we move through a Kenyan shanty town to the tragic situation of the people of Sudan. At one point in the movie we see an African town being attacked by marauding tribesmen in Sudan and for the first time the horror of the murder of Weisz is eclipsed by the terrible plight of one little girl who is left alone and abandoned to her fate in one of the most dangerous parts of the world 'what will happen to her' asks Fiennes 'she might make it to a refugee camp, if she is lucky' answers the doctor. At this point the tragedy of Africa's poor is made very clear to the viewer and i found this very sad and moving. This was Weisz's character's lifework, caring for these people so it is warmly appropriate that the emotional impact of her death should be overshadowed by it at at this point in the film. The musical score and the cinematography are beautiful, given that there are never any fairy tale endings to African tragedies it is appropriate that the ending should reflect that to a degree, ultimately Fiennes got some vengeance but the film does not attempt to insult the truelife reality of Africa's pain with an ending that grants complete justice to the African victims and stops their exploitation. In reality the corporations and government sget what they want and carry on as before. The title was superbly chosen, a constant gardener is required in the modern world to constantly fight back against those with power and corruption who are striving to dominate (as a weed) and thrive and choke the metaphorical flowerbeds containing the world's most vulnerable people, this is supported by the warning given to Fiennes by his sociopathic boss about investigating the murder of his wife...""do you no good to go poking under rocks Justin, some very nasty things live under rocks"".

As the film proceeds through a series of flashbacks from Justin's memory, it seems that Tessa had been sneaking around with a large assortment of men behind Justin's back with Justin never mentioning it nor investigating the matter further. After her sudden death, he feels compelled to find out the truth behind what was going on as some of the pieces don't quite fit. Ralph Fiennes does a good job as a man possessed not by a lust for revenge but for a dire want to understand his wife and the secret life she was hiding from him. Towards the end of the movie, Justin's remorse for doubting his wife as he uncovers the truth provides a selfless motivation to keep him pulling at the thread of the forces behind his wife's death. While Rachel Weisz is charming and appropriately enigmatic as Tessa and Ralph Fiennes makes his character easy to sympathize with, the plot, when it is finally revealed, is typical and unimaginative when compared to the rest of the movie. Director Fernando Meirelles takes care to have the tension develop slowly but surely throughout the course of the film only to have it dissolve anti-climactically as Justin begins to submits to fate. While that may be fitting for the character as he isn't particularly driven by vengence, it doesn't work so well in a movie that's trying to come off as part thriller.

2453280,4,B000C65Z20,"""The Constant Gardener"", an adaptation of the novel by John Le Carre, tells the story of corruption, conspiracy and love from the heights of government to the depths of human suffering.

Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) works for the British High Commission when he meets impassioned activist Tessa (Rachel Weisz).  Although they are opposites, the pair immediately falls in love.

When Justin has to go to Africa, Tessa follows and becomes deeply involved in the plight of the people who are being ravaged by the AIDS epidemic and lack of needed drugs.  Whether it's confronting members of the High Commission at an evening soiree, writing reports denouncing the inappropriate use of drugs by powerful pharmaceutical companies or working with the people of an African village, Tessa, who at this time is quite pregnant, remains diligent.  After a while, she becomes convinced that some of the local people are being slowly murdered.

However, Tessa's work isn't completed when she and her driver are killed in a roadside massacre.  It's then up to Justin to piece together the truth behind Tessa's actions.  Why was Tessa killed?  Was she having an affair with Arnold (Hubert Kounde), a doctor in Africa?  Justin soon finds himself embroiled in a life altering journey, where friends and enemies may not be who they seem but love is the one force that conquers all.

I really believe that if ""The Constant Gardener"" was released later in 2005, it could have been a serious contender for Best Picture.  There were a lot of things I liked about this movie; first of all the cast.  Fiennes and Weisz (who did win the best supporting actress Oscar for her role) seemed to have natural on-screen chemistry.  Both were also powerful in the leading roles.  One notable moment showed a lone Justin, looking through the glass doors of the house while standing outside.  A flood of memories overcomes him and we see him sobbing at the doors.  I think at that moment we truly feel the grief that he's going through.

The supporting cast was also good.  Bill Nighy as the snooty Sir Pellegrin and Danny Huston as Sandy Woodrow, the friend who is secretly in love (or lust) with Tessa were ideal.  Hubert Kounde as Arnold and Dr. Lorbeer a.k.a. Dr. Brandt (Pete Postlethwaite), a M.D. for the pharmaceutical company who later seeks redemption in a small village in Kenya, were also interesting.

I also like the way that ""less was more"" in the movie.  There were several instances, for example the murder of Tessa or when Justin identifies her in the morgue, where filmmakers could have shown moviegoers what happened in graphic detail.  Although we don't see that with ""The Constant Gardener"", the descriptions and the few shots we do see lets us conclude/imagine just how horrible these situations are.

There were things that I liked and disliked about the way the movie was shot.  Except for the first couple of minutes, Tessa is only seen through flashbacks in Justin's memory.  I liked the premise of this and really think this made the movie more intriguing.  I also thought the flashback sequence of Tessa pleading for Justin to give a woman, a boy and a newborn baby a ride to the next village/city was exceptional when Justin, in current time, uses her own words when he wants to save a young girl during a village attack.

However, it's easy to see how the switches from flashback to present time could be a little confusing.  It may take a few seconds to determine which time frame you're in.

A bit more background on Justin and Tessa would have been nice but wasn't really needed to enhance the story.  I also wasn't quite sure about the gardening part.  Was it an obsession, hobby, etc.? The movie really didn't go into detail other than showing Justin working with plants/flowers two or three times.

""The Constant Gardener"" is about having love, losing it and then finding out that you've never really lost it at all.  It's a beautifully shot drama with a riveting story and no happy ending.",1144281600,,3993,4.797950219619326

(I like everything else Le Carr has ever written.) And it definitely starts out slow and a bit confusedly, with intercut flashbacks and an unexplained murder. But then, as you gradually understand what's really going on -- at the same time Justin is figuring things out -- you get caught up in the immensity of the pharmaceutical conspiracy (I have no trouble believing it could really have happened, the pharma industry being what it is . . .), and you share Justin's anguish and Tessa's impassioned politics. Ralph Fiennes is very good as the gentlemanly British diplomat who cannot -- at first -- come to grips with the truth. Rachel Weisz, whom I don't really know much about, is also very good. And there's a chemistry between them that sizzles, . . . in a quiet, British way. The cinematography is stunning and the footage of Kenyan towns and Sudanese villages will stay with you.

As Justin Quayle, Ralph Fiennes suffers some more (yes, he does it well, having had a whole lot of practice) and (less usually) is stirred to action after the murder of his beloved wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz in a part for which she won a best supporting actress even though she is the female lead and almost the only female character). Well, nominally it was an automobile accident, though she was raped and mutilated, because ""there are no murders in Africa, only regrettable deaths.""

I don't think that it is a secret that the nefarious conduct of clinical trials in Africa is the muck Le Carr's best-selling book raked. The movie's editing seems to be to be unnecessarily jagged, but I soon was able to sort out the chronology of the flashbacks and the transformation of the ever-so polite low-level British diplomat (Fiennes) pulled out of his garden.

As a ""thriller,"" the movie takes its time getting going, but Le Carr is not the typical ""thriller"" writer. And his romances generally seem more schematic than heartfelt, which is exacerbated by the casting of the cold fish (if often yearning) Ralph Fiennes.

The DVD bonus features have considerable overlap. The best is the one that focuses on Le Carre, who pronounces himself more satisfied with the adaptation than of any of the other (many!) screen adaptations of his novels. (I'll stick with ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" for that accolade, while wishing that ""The Little Drummer Girl"" was both a better movie and that Le Carre's book was read more these days,  as it is even more relevant than The Constant Gardener .)

2453287,4,B000C65Z20,"The Constant Gardener is a triumph for Director Fernando Meirelles. The movie, filmed in Kenya and South Sudan, was based on John Le Carre's novel (also set in Africa) of love, intrigue and suspense in the British diplomatic service.

The story centres on Justin, a mid-level diplomat in the British Foreign Service, he bumbles around not wanting to upset people and just 'does his job'. He meets and marries the passionate and somewhat unruly Tessa, a political activist. Tessa, unknown to Justin, is involved in exposing unethical drug trailing on sample populations of poor Africans by pharmaceutical companies. Tessa's activities begin to embarrass some members of the diplomatic staff, and she is found brutally murdered. Justin, who was oblivious until her death of her attempt to expose the pharmaceutical intrigue, decides to uncover the truth about her murder. As Justin unravels the truth of Tessa's involvement in the exposure of the drug trails, he enters her world and 'transitions' into her relationships.

Ralph Fiennes is well cast as Justin Quayle, the gardener of the title. Tessa is played by Rachel Weisz, who got an academy award (2006) for her performance, and she was absolutely amazing as Tessa. But for my money the pottering, passive Justin was just wonderfully portrayed by Fiennes. He typifies the British 'mustn't grumble' character of so many serving in the diplomatic corps. Also worth noting is the strong performance by Pete Postlewaite as a jaded South African doctor working with refugees, he gives the movie a wry 'reality bite'.

The story is told in 'flash-back' sequences with Justin remembering scenes from the life he shared with Tessa, and the plot moves back and forth from past to present, Africa to Europe, and gradually builds up to a very powerful ending. The music is wonderfully atmospheric and really adds to the slightly melancholy, pessimistic nature of the film.

The intrigue of the plot which involved the British High Commission, pharmaceutical trails, and 'jobs in the UK', really made me ponder the 'ethical investment' policy of the British government in the late 1990s. The movie raises some politically sensitive issues about the collusion of self-seeking individuals in government and pharmaceutical investment.

There's a coverup in there, too as well as some suspected marital infidelity (guess they couldn't find a way to fit a musical number in..).

2453292,5,B000C65Z20,"This is partly a response to a one star review that I recently read.  On this review, it says ""One knows already who the culprit is.""  Is this a negative aspect to the movie?  The point of movies like this (see also Syriana) is not to hide the identity of the culprit until the end, whereupon the story takes a rediculous twist and we find out something shocking.  Of course we already know who the culprit is, just like we know who the culprit is in Syriana.  The questions these movies ask are: What are you going to do about it?  What can we do about it?  Can we do anything?  Are you willing to stick your neck out to save innocent people?  These movies are confusing at times, but so is life, and that is the mood these films try to achieve.  That being said, this is one of the most well put together films this year.  And, honestly, is Ralph Fiennes ever bad in any film?  Even in the Avengers, Fiennes gives it his all.  No matter what film it is, whether it be the Best Picture winner The English Patient, or the wonderful Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Fiennes is always acting at 110%.  Weisz, after the disappointing Constantine, gives the best performance of her career (aparently the Academy thought so as well) and she far outshines any other supporting actress, with the exception of the rivaled Amy Adams in Junebug.  The film also shows great supporting roles such as Danny Huston and Bill Nighy.  Fernando Meirelles directs superbly and does a wonderful adaptation of the John Le Carre novel.",1142208000,,1517,4.461818181818182
2453293,4,B000C65Z20,"Diplomat Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) receives news that his wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) has been killed in Kenya. Justin's British reserve goes so deep that he hardly blinks, and apologizes to the man who had to bear the news. Despite the calm formality, his eyes flicker with pain.

The Constant Gardener is a decidedly British film, a political thriller that displays low-key intelligence and yet crackles with intrigue. There are no shootouts or heroics, nor are there dramatic clues left behind at every location. Instead we are given a complicated, intersecting web of seedy diplomats, greedy corporations, battered third-world war zones, and merciless contract killers. Beneath all this, a touching human story punctuates every frame.

Before her death, Tessa was a leftist activist who traveled throughout Africa. Treading through Kenya alone would be dangerous for anyone, much less a pregnant British woman, but she does so with nave zeal, desperate to help anyone she can. Although Justin found these qualities attractive in the first place, they are getting tiresome. Tessa rarely comes home, and spends a startling amount of time with an African doctor, a sore point that generates no shortage of rumor. At the time of her suspicious death, Tessa was a key component of an investigation into the habits of a parsimonious pharmaceutical company, and Justin finds himself quickly sucked into his wife's work. Obsessively diving into the Africa his wife knew, Justin begins to acquire the same qualities that made Tessa a great person, and got her killed.

The Constant Gardener pays great respect to the intelligence of the audience, all but unheard of for a left-leaning political thriller. Tessa's death comes right away, but almost immediately the film cuts to flashbacks, correctly assuming that attentive audience members don't need it spelled out. The British nature of the story works very well; characters rarely say exactly what runs through their minds, but use subtle wording and veiled threats to convey the plot. Instead of long-winded monologues of The Contender or Good Night, and Good Luck, we simply watch events play out, free to make up our own minds.

Yet, most interesting is the story of Justin and Tessa's marriage. Justin had a deep but almost bemused love for his wife, who never seemed to forget about her humanitarian work for a minute. At the time of her death, the marriage appeared to be crumbling, Justin nearing the end of his rope with her secrecy and absences.

Through the course of his investigation, he discovers things about Tessa that he never knew, peeling back the layers until he sees what sort of person she really was at the core. Her generosity was infectious, and changes him profoundly. Many of us wish for a few more minutes with someone that we lost; Justin's longing for Tessa builds in his eyes until looking at him is like peering into the sun.

The Constant Gardener works splendidly on every level it exists. Simultaneously suspenseful, touching, and thought provoking, the film can justly take a seat with the other great issue pieces of 2005, though it will not be remembered solely for its views on drug companies. Any film maker who wants to touch on politics should take a note; lectures are boring, great stories are not.",1142208000,,3291,5.029357798165138

It's one of those movies that leave me with a 'why in the h*** did I waste my time watching this piece of garbage' feeling.

2453309,3,B000C65Z20,"I must agree with the last reviewer this movie does lead you to believe a lot of things. For one because Ralph Fiennes is holding a gun on the front of the DVD you would think he uses it. Ralph doesn't even get the gun until the last thirty minutes and it stays in his pocket the entire time. They put all of the good-looking scenes on the cover but they don't let you know that you'll be spending your entire day trying to finish this film. The movie is worth seeing at least once but I doubt if you'll want to keep it after seeing it so it's better to rent it. Good for the director of City Of God for a decent film but this is no City Of God and I say this because there are some similarities between the two films.

The acting couldn't save this but it was a good effort, Ralph does hold it up and he is most of the reason why you stick with the film until the end. I wasn't even aware that this was a story with a little love until I saw Ralph driving in the middle of nowhere talking to a Rachel Weisz that wasn't there.

2453310,2,B000C65Z20,"I found the movie predictable and dry and felt that it was entirely misrepresented (Fiennes on the DVD pointing a gun). Mild mannered is an understatement for Fiennes, whom as an experienced diplomat appears quite naive to everything around him and only finds out the story from ""friends"" self motivated confessions. The only thing Fiennes does is run aroud and slightly raise his voice. It was also by far one of the weakest love stories I have ever seen. Tessa Quayle (Rachel Weisz), Fiennes wife is so engrossed in her ""cause"" that she has to go out of her way throughout the movie to remind the audience that she actually has a relationship. Her character fails to convince me that she even cares about her husband or their expected child; more likely that she used him to get a foot into Africa so that she could join some generic cause that makes her feel important; she is like one of those idiots from college who just wants to hug African children and mouth off to corporate figures without any training or experience with the ""really real world"". Every scene between Fiennes and Weisz is excruciating to watch; like a loveless marriage that neither wants to make an effort to end. The whole plot can be pieced together after 20 min into the movie. I like Fiennes as an actor and I can only look to Meirelles for making an unconvincing love story that lasts about 45 minutes too long. The end of the movie brought relief that it was over and I felt as if I've wasted 129 minutes. The movie was anticlimactic and the characters seemed to risk their lives for no reason as evident in the last scene. You are left at the end of the movie with a feeling that if these to characters never existed it would make no difference. If you are looking for action or a moving love story look elsewhere, Fiennes and Weisz had no chemistry. I had all I could do not to turn the movie off.",1141689600,,1882,4.457971014492753
2453311,5,B000C65Z20,"Beginning with the greatest example of opposites attracting, The Constant Gardener tells the story of two people with different politics converging on the same path of trying to discover a conspiracy involving a pharmaceutical company.

Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) is a fairly prominent British diplomat who tends to keep his opinions to himself.  One day, while delivering a lecture for a colleague, he meets a very liberal, very outspoken woman named Tessa (Rachel Weisz) who openly challenges the content of the lecture.  Justin is rather taken by the young woman, and he offers to take her out after she ends up humiliating herself.  The two hit it off immediately, and they are soon married.  Justin eventually gets sent to Africa, and Tessa asks to come with him.  While there, she befriends Arnold Bluhm (Hubert Kound), a native scientist, and they begin investigating a drug company that is selling their newest product in Kenya.

All of that is told in a flashback.  Tessa and Arnold are killed within five minutes of the movie, and Justin can barely stand it.  He begins pieceing together the clues left behind by his late wife, who was truly the love of his life, despite their difference of opinions when it came to politics.  He soon learns that she was very close to uncovering a conspiracy involving the drug company and the British government.  The second half of the film follows Justin as he tries to finish Tessa's work and make sure she didn't die in vain.

Everything about the film is well-done.  The script is very well-written, and the actors all do fine jobs.  The story is very interesting, and the locations are both hauntingly beautiful and depressing.  The images of poverty and disease in Africa do their job and resonate with the audience.

Maybe that's why I went in to this movie expecting so much, and why it was a bit of a let down at the end, not because of the plot, but because of the pretext.

What everyone else has said about the acting is true -- it's very good.  Fiennes is compelling -- he has the quality of internalizing the drama and yet communicating that internal struggle effectively, Weisz is endearing.

I was a big fan of Mereilles from City of God, I love his sensibility, and the way that he shot the Africa scenes.  However, I think the  pacing of the plot was a little off for some reason.  We didn't finish the movie in one sitting, and my wife could not keep her eyes open.

2453313,5,B000C65Z20,"This is a great film with a story which needs to be heard by the ""First World"".  However, I was disappointed in it as it didn't compare well with the book.  The book shows that, even in this upmteenth novel, LeCarre has not lost the touch he showed in ""The spy Who Came In From the Cold"" or ""Tailor, Tinker ..."".  Whether due to time constraints (the book was 450 pages long) or bowing to pressure from the producer or financiers, the ""edge"" in the book is missing from the film.  The character of Tessa is reduced in intensity so that she becomes just another ""incensed protester"" instead of the woman who risks her life and perhaps her husband's career to improve the lot of African women whom she meets.  Her role in the African Womans' Movement is completely eliminated from the story.  The story, as noted, is a series of flashbacks showing Justin Quayle, in the person of Ralph Fiennes, trying to ""find"" the real personna of his late wife in the face of British authorities in Africa and in the Foreign Office who insist on ruining her reputation and portraying him as a ""cuckold"".  This is done to undermine the investigative work she had included in a mysterious report which has disappeared under the watchful eye of said diplomats.  Also missing, again perhaps due to time constraints, is the really chilling human lawnmower aspect of the pharmaceutical company security people as they move across the world eliminating each person who offers another piece of the puzzle to Justin.

The acting is wonderful.  Rachel Weitz won a Golden Globe for her portrayal of Tessa, and Fiennes is his usually great self.  Also giving a  fine performance is Terry Huston as a man who lost himself as he rose higher in the diplomatic core and is now the Acting High Commissioner of the British presence in Kenya.  However,  I was disappointed in Bill Nighy's performance as Peregrime.  A Peregrime is a hunting falcon, and the person in the book is just so deadly and final in his pursuits.  Nighy, whom I love, whether as Viktor in ""Underworld"" or as the aging rocker in ""Love Actually"" in Peregrime comes across more as a slightly edgier, more dangerous version of his role in ""The Girl in the Cafe"" instead of the cruel sleeze masquerading as a polished British diplomat.  In the postscript to the book, we are told that this man retires from his post and takes a position with the pharmaceutical company which is at the center of Tessa's investigation.

Overall, this film is just an incredibly poor example of filmmaking.  For starters, the director's vision was foggy, at best.  I'm not sure what kind of film he hoped to make.  Spy thriller?  Romance?  Political intrigue?  Human interest?  Pseudo-ficto big Pharma expose'?  Regardless, the cinematography was poorly executed and totally inappropriate for the material.  The jerky, grainy camera work was distracting, dated and tiresome.

I also found the film to be totally implausible on many levels.  If this is an accurate portrayal of Le Carre's novel, he should stick to writing about British spies in Europe.  I question whether he even bothered to research the elaborate hoops a pharmaceutical company has to jump through before a drug ever even reaches First-in-Human trials.  He also apparently has no concept of the vast number of local and international watchdog organizations in existence solely devoted to medical and human rights issues in Africa. (MANY, on both counts.)  Where were the watchdog organizations?  One woman and one doctor are going to take on this company and the British foreign ministers alone?  I think not.

Another plausibility problem for me was believing that Justin (Fiennes) and Tessa (Weisz) could possibly fall in love in the first place, given their vastly different approaches to life.  That said, I must admit that the two most believable, most REAL, and affecting moments in the film were their post-coital giggles.  I attribute that to two talented actors getting a momentary reprieve from having to work against some horribly contrived plot device.

My last beef is with the ending

!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!

The reading of the infamous letter at the funeral would have been a good ending for ONE of the 20 films that ""The Constant Gardener"" was trying to be.  It would have been perfect for the big bloated, glossy, Hollywood film demonizing big, bloated, glossy pharma, with the little guy winning after several exciting car chases and martial-artsy fight scenes.  They would, of course, not have killed off Ralph Fiennes.  He would instead have walked in the door at his own funeral service and read the letter aloud in voiceover while they showed a slo-mo scene of him disarming and blasting the entire carload of mercenaries that came to kill him.

!!!END SPOILER!!!

Ultimately this film is pompous and unsatisfying.  I suspect the director really wanted to make an art film and but instead tried to force this hack-job schizophrenic story into an art-house hole.  Naturally, it failed.  The two stars I give this film are only for the film's two stars.  Ralph Fiennes is one of those few modern actors, like Cate Blanchett, who is utterly mesmerizing onscreen.  Rachel Weisz is also skilled and subtle. This is a rental for fans, otherwise, don't bother.",1141084800,,2926,5.012474012474012

2453325,4,B000C65Z20,"When I first saw this film in the theater I was left with a distinct empty feeling at the film's end.  With little or no hope for the characters I cared about, I found myself forced to leave the theater and re-enter a world that suddenly wasn't as safe and comfortable-seeming as the one I had left just a couple of hours before.  I was glad I had seen the film and felt I understood the nature of evil in the world a bit better for it, but I wasn't sure it was a movie I'd want to see again.

I was wrong.

Something subtle in this film stayed with me through the succeeding months, haunting me beyond the politics of the movie's compelling plot line.  It lay in the luminous relationship between Ralph Fiennes' and Rachel Weisz's characters that those actors wonderfully portray.

Here are two people -- seemingly polar opposites -- who discover in one another a mutual respect and affirmation of life.  Just watching this fragile union between two disparate people truly work amidst all the evil that pervades the world around them is one of the most life-affirming things I can remember onscreen.  To have one's faith and principles shaken but to ultimately remain true to oneself is something rare and valuable and yet too little seen in film today.

For me this film has slowly grown from one that I admire to one I hold as truly necessary.",1140998400,,1346,4.506172839506172
2453326,4,B000C65Z20,"I started watching THE CONSTANT GARDNER last night at 9:30 and I turned it off at 10:30 because it was becoming way too stressful.  I knew if I watched much more, I would be too upset to sleep.  After finishing the movie this afternoon, I know I made the right decision.  And thank Heaven that the lovely heroine, Tessa was murdered during the beginning of the film and we could watch her life through the back filming.  If the viewer had formed a connection with this lovely and brave activist, and then had to watch her death--well--it would have been too much to bear.

The scenery of Africa was wonderful, the people beautiful, but the images were tragic.  Watching the rebels attack the little village at the end of the film was heartbreaking and appalling because we know that is constantly happening in Africa.  We also know there are pay-offs and dishonorable things going on in Africa so companies can make a buck.  This is what makes the movie so painful to watch.  Another reason is the poignant  character portrayals by the lead actors.  Ralph Fiennes as Justin Quayle and Rachel Weisz as Tessa Quayle were absolutely incredible.

This is a film that will be with me for a long time.  I am glad I watched it but this is not a story that I could enjoy again--too heart wrenching.",1140912000,,1290,4.556521739130435

2453328,5,B000C65Z20,"The Constant Gardener is one of the most surprising films I've seen in the last six months. For whatever reason, it gets miscategorized as a political thriller. Instead, this is a love story in context of international conspiracy. Much like Hostel is sold as an anti-capitalist film (it's really just a gore fest, to my delight), It's All Gone Pete Tong is sold as a club raver film (it's really a sappy drama about losing your hearing) and Crash is sold as a comment on racism (it's really just overrated), I hope this film doesn't get confused with its background.

Tessa (Weisz) is a smart, beautiful young activist who is driven by ideals and emotions. Justin (Fiennes) is a shy, patient, soft-spoken diplomat who abides by the rules religiously and tends to his garden the way he tends toward life: carefully pick out the bad and nurture the good. The two end up on a collision course of love and life.

In Africa, Tessa is murdered, and the film spends the majority exploring through flashbacks and jumps, how Justin must deal with the death, his work, her life, and what his life means to himself and everyone else. His colleagues and friends become enemies. He trusts no one. Does he even trust his wife? Is she who he thinks she is?

What Justin discovers is more far-reaching than he ever could imagine: Justin discovers that his own life is worth living beyond the borders he has put up.",1140566400,,1398,4.629032258064516
2453329,4,B000C65Z20,"While ""The Constant Gardener"" lacked the impact of director Fernando Meirelles' haunting classic ""City of God"" it was nonetheless a noteworthy tale of intrigue based on the John Le Carre novel.  Excellent cinemaography filmed in large part in both Kenya and Sudan made a stunning panorama of both the beauty and horrors of the African continent.

Urbane, genteel English diplomat Justin Quayle played by the versatile Ralph Fiennes falls deeply in love with political activist Tessa played by Rachel Weisz.  They marry and go off to his posting in Africa.  The chemistry between Fiennes and Weisz is unmistakable even though their personalities are at different ends of the spectrum.

In flashback sequences which at times are hard to follow, we learn that Weisz has been murdered amid rumours of infidelity.  She apparently had uncovered a scam perpetrated by a huge pharmaceutical firm which was test marketing a revolutionary TB drug in Kenya.  She and her colleague, a black African doctor Arnold Bluhm played by Hubert Kounde discovered that poor unfortunate denizens of the slums of Kenya were being used as guinea pigs.  Apparently the firm was covering up the lethal side effects of the medication in order to avoid having to go back to the lab and spend millions more in research.  Both Weisz and Kounde were killed for their troubles.

The normally mild mannered introverted Fiennes goes on a personal inquisition to find out what truly happened to his wife . Under threats from members of the British government and high ranking officials from the drug firm, Fiennes struggles to continue his dead wife's quest.  Threatened with great personal danger he is lead to a doctor working in the bush, Lorbeer played by Pete Postlethwaite who reveals the mechanism of the coverup.

2453330,3,B000C65Z20,"This material must have been so much better in the form of a book.  Multi-layered and over-nuanced, with a plot that loops backward awkwardly in the beginning reel, this movie tries to touch so many bases that little is left for the viewer to connect with.

The obvious path to the heart of the movie would seem to be the title character,  Justin ( Ralph Fiennes) the mild-mannered diplomat.  He alone among the characters is unallied to cause, corruption, and conspiracy.  But Justin's unassuming sensitivity doesn't ameliorate this movie's total lack of sensual depth.

This is one of those movies that attempts to create tension by questioning its lead character's manhood.  Can doughy Justin hold on to his younger, more passionate and idealistic other half?  is he being cuckolded by a colleague, a friend, or (gasp) by a young black man?[...]

The outer (as opposed to the inner) story in ""Constant Gardener"" is oh so topical.  But for all of its dealing with AIDS, poverty, and the greed of multi-national corporations, does it really prick the Western conscience, or raise awareness?  I think that 2004's ""Hotel Rwanda"" did a far better job.  This movie employs the natives as window dressing. [...]

Maybe I missed something in not seeing this movie on a large screen, but on a small one it came across as cynical, small-hearted, superficial, and quite disappointing.",1140393600,,1376,4.956331877729258

Even though the end is fairly predictable, the emotional road that the story takes to get to its climax is beautifully written and the performances are amazing. Great movie!",1140220800,,399,5.25
2453342,5,B000C65Z20,"In ""The Constant Gardener,"" Fernando Mirelles has created what has come to be a rarity nowadays, a film that is both timely and absorbing. Narrated in flashbacks, it tells the story of a British Diplomat in Kenya who searches for the truth about the murder of his wife. During the process of his search, he not only discovers the ugly truth about her death but also the even uglier truth about the government-backed pharmaceutical companies who will stop at nothing to exploit the indigenous population, whom they have turned into human guinea pigs.

Because of Mirelles' direction and the fine ensemble cast, the timeliness of the plot in no way detracts from the dramatic tension, which, although it mounts slowly, becomes gripping as the film builds towards its climax. Rachel Weisz, who has been deservedly nominated for an Oscar, plays an engaging Tessa, an outspoken activist who challenges the rather conventional  beliefs of Rafe Fiennes' Justin, who begins the film as a staunch member of the British diplomatic corps.  Fiennes' moving interpretation of Justin is both understated and subtly nuanced (a combination that probably guaranteed that he would be overlooked at Oscar time). Their performances are amply supported by a splendid cast of plausible criminals-in-high-places (The downfall of one of them at the end of the picture is not to be missed!).

Perhaps the true stars of the film, however, are the people of Nairobi, who, along with the splendid cinematography of Kenya and Alberto Iglesias' haunting musical score, transform the film from a conventional thriller into an exceptional drama. Particurlarly moving are the scenes shot in Kebira, the impoverished favela, or ""city within the city,"" of Nairobi; and the scenes in which the women and children try to escape the murderous Janjueed horsemen in the Sudan also contribute a tragic realism to the film.

Although it might be objected that the title of the film seems inappropriate for the character of Justin, who putters idly among his nasturtiums, when considered in light of Voltaire's ""Candide,"" the title character of which decides to tend his own garden rather than engage the world, the name  ""Constant Gardener"" assumes a metaphorical status. It might connote the indifference of the world as we all ""tend our own gardens"" in spite of the ongoing tragedies in much of Africa today.",1140134400,,2368,5.1217616580310885

2453344,5,B000C65Z20,"Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles more than does justice to John Le Carre's 2001 novel, ""The Constant Gardner"" in this extraordinary adaptation. He worked closely with cinematographer Cesar Charlone to recreate the vivid quality of Africa, of Kenya, and of the African people, in the movie theater. With photography, color, motion and wonderful music, the viewer is taken to both the Nairobi of the wealthy expatriate community - and the villages and shantytowns of the not so fortunate. The acting is superb!

Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), is a kindly, self-effacing British diplomat, a bachelor attached to the British High Commission in Nairobi. He is a steadfast, loyal and moral man. Gardening is his passion. Justin meets and falls in love with social and political activist Tessa, (Rachel Weisz). One gets the feeling that he had never experienced such intensity of feeling before - not even through gardening. Therefore, shortly after their initial encounter, when she asks him to take her to Africa, he does - as Mrs. Quayle.

True to form, in Kenya Rachel becomes extremely involved working with the poor and infirm, especially with women and children. Her constant companion and coworker is a black doctor, Arnold Bluhm, (Hubert Kounde). Together they visit villages and do the best they can to tend to their patients with minimal supplies and medication from pharmaceutical companies and relief organizations. The dates on most of the supplies and medicine are expired by the time they reach the targeted population. The donors, however, are still provided with tax write-offs.

The film opens with the brutal murder of Rachel Quayle in an isolated area of northern Kenya, and the disappearance of Bluhm. When rumors of Rachel's infidelity surface as an explanation for her death, Arnold becomes the prime suspect as the thwarted lover. Justin's good friend and colleague, Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston), tells him of his wife's demise. Justin, in shock, still feels sorry for Sandy for having to break such terrible news. Grief-stricken, Quayle begins to investigate his wife's so called ""infidelities"" and discovers that Rachel and Arnold had been compiling evidence about a multinational drug company that uses the poor and uneducated to test new drugs.

Risking his own life, Quayle finds that his old colleagues in the diplomatic corps are well aware of Rachel's activities. He also discovers that life outside his garden is not a pretty place at all.

Fiennes is wonderful as the man mourning a woman he loved but did not know very well. The depth of his quiet sadness powerfully permeates the film. Weisz is perfect as the younger woman, sincerely driven to make a difference. The scenes when she romps with the children in the shantytowns are electric with energy and joy, despite the squalid conditions. Huston's character is a real sleaze but he's not the biggest rat - that position belongs to Sir Bernard Pellegrin, (Bill Nighy), knight of the realm, and probably the most corrupt, distasteful character I have seen in quite a while.

""The Constant Gardner"" is a wonderful and compelling love story, as well as a chilling mystery with themes of social justice and ethics, as well as deception, deceit and murder most foul.

Again, Meirelles' artistic eye and the camera results are golden. The marvelous score is by Spanish composer Alberto Iglesias. Highly recommended!

While Gardener  certainly probes into geopolitical issues with urgency and thoughtfulness, its mood and rhythm isn't consistent and is inferior to City of God in terms of vibrant energy. After a solid first act, it considerably loses its momentum once Rachel Weisz's character gets murdereed, it becomes somewhat plodding and tentative.

City of God, on the other hand, crackles with energy and verve and its unique aesthetic mood and style influences new films, like this new US documentary ""Favela Rising"", set in the Brazilian slums where an ex-drug dealer starts a musical revolution with hip-hop and reggae.",1139961600,,725,5.188034188034188
2453346,5,B000C65Z20,"The pharmaceutical mafia in Africa is striking everyday, or nearly everyday. Remember the polio vaccinations. Public research and testing in France by Institut Pasteur in West Africa, Private research and testing in the USA in the Ex-Belgian Congo. The two species of monkeys used by the two labs were monkeys that are carrying the AIDS virus without being affected. To say that is already an anti-pharmaceutical crime. There used to be an article in an English medical magazine about that experimentation. All traces seem to have disappeared. Only Mandela used that practice to get some rebates on the anti-AIDS drugs in the early 1990s. The only way to find out would be to get all the old issues of English medical magazines, and American ones at the same time, and check over the last 25 years (at least) provided one issue has not been accidently lost in some shredder. Even the Internet is a pretty dumb tool if you are not more informed than it is, at times. This film is about such a scandal in Kenya. To get drugs the people there are ready to do anything. If it can save the life of their children, and eventually made their life easier, they can accept any experimentation. And that happens all the time. Be sure that it happens in our countries too, but in our countries we use the final product after extensive testing on animals and with computers. The difference is that in our countries there are strict rules before, during and after that experimentation and if something goes wrong the responsibility of the lab is entirely complete and total. In Africa... ! Can you repeat please, we seem not have heard what you said. A girl gets involved in such a fight against a pharmaceutical trust and she disappears one day, and a few other people. Her husband tries to find the truth and does find it but he did not leave Africa where he was the victim of an accident: bullets from eight different guns. That's a good well organized and efficient accident. He had been prudent though and a certain clandestine secret report will finally come to the public, thanks to a little money under the table to a comprehensive black pilot: the man did not need that money since he did not plan to get out of Africa. That's probably the worst thing you can imagine about Africa. It is the most fascinating continent on this planet but it is also the most dangerous place to survive in. Gun smugglers are a horrible band of monsters but I believe pharmaceutical guinea-pig hunters are definitely a lot more inhumane and we cannot say we are not directly concerned: we are using these products everyday and most of them have been tested on African children, most of the time without them even knowing about it. By the way why is it said that Aventis is closing some chemical operation in Switzerland and opening the same in their factory next to my village in the Central Mountains of France? I guess regulations are not the same or if they are, the regulators may need glasses in France. The pharmaceutical vampires are everywhere and you cannot escape them.

2453347,4,B000C65Z20,"""The Constant Gardener"" is a film based on John Le Carr's novel of corporate mischief. When the activist wife of Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), employee of the British High Commission in Kenya, is savagely murdered, the normally self-effacing and reticent Justin finds himself investigating an unholy liaison between a drug manufacturer and Her Majesty's government. Justin's more radical wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) and Kenyan Dr. Arnold Bluhm (Hubert Kound) had been investigating a cover-up of a supposedly revolutionary TB drug being tested on poor Kenyan patients with a minimum of informed consent. Tessa submitted a report to Justin's boss at the British High Commission Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston). But where is the report and what did it say? Why and by whom was Tessa killed?

""The Constant Gardener"" tells two stories: One is a thriller about a harrowing race to uncover what Tessa knew and find out who killed her. The other is the love story of Justin and Tessa Quayle. I found the love story more compelling than the political thriller. The thriller has some moments of real tension and menace, but I think it's undermined by an improbable ending and a premise that isn't very strong. The conduct of the pharmaceutical company in regards to the drug study is really not substantially different from how drug companies act in the U.S. or anywhere else. It's just more dramatic. It's unethical, but not illegal. And I'm not sure their motivation is credible, since the drug company has to discontinue its study and kill the drug anyway for reasons unrelated to Tessa Quayle's investigation.

The love story, however, is effective. Justin Quayle's quest to learn about Tessa is as much the mission of a grieving husband to understand the wife who he didn't fully know as it is to find her killers. When Tessa suggested that they marry, Justin pointed out they hardly knew one another. Tessa's reply was, ""You can learn me."" Left with still more to learn after her death, that's what he does in this film. Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz have a nice chemistry as two people of opposite personalities who nevertheless share the same values. Tessa's a loose cannon when she latches onto a cause and blunt to the point of recklessness. Justin is a gentleman, a quiet, self-effacing man who likes to toil in his garden. And yet I was convinced that these 2 people adored one another, even though their story is told entirely in flashback.

2453349,5,B000C65Z20,"If John le Carre' wrote in any other genre than spy thriller, he would be considered one of our greatest authors. le Carre' is a hypnotic storyteller and although he spins tales of intrigue, more often than not his characters are also swept into complex moral and spiritual journeys. Such is the case here.

Only after her death does Justin Quayle, Ralph Fiennes, set out to discover his wife's real character; in the process, he learns a lot more than that. Fiennes is truly brilliant, always understated, always controlled, smoldering beneath a veneer of English civility. For an even closer look at his acting genius, try Spider, directed by David Cronenberg, an unsettling tour de force.

Much has been said about Rachel Weisz who plays his wife. Her performance is indeed vivid and credible, even if her character, Tessa, is a bit simplistic and myopic. Those who perceive this film as a left-wing diatribe against the big mean pharma companies are totally missing the point. Art can never be propaganda and vice versa. Bear in mind that the cold war is over and le Carre' must find new villains. He has found a very nasty one indeed. But third-world exploitation is merely the story's canvas, not its point.

Which brings us to director Fernando Meirelles, whose City of God electrified the screen with its portrayal of teenage gang life in Rio's slums. Meirelles has an astounding eye and ability to put viewers in a place. His work here is extraordinary; this is not the Africa of lion-country-safari. This is the real Africa, with beauty and squalor and color and desolation all shoulder to shoulder.

The only possible criticism I would offer is the pacing, The Constant Gardener seems to move as quickly as a plant grows. But with so many other virtues, one can overlook its lack of sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat tension. Maybe it's better to sit back in your seat, and watch the tension blossom gradually.",1139356800,,1916,4.886153846153846
2453350,5,B000C65Z20,"Like watching a group walk by a unique painting for the first time, The Constant Gardener will evoke different emotions and feelings from everyone that gazes upon it.  Critics far and wide have praised this film as a deeply political thriller that speaks passionately about the corruption surrounding the pharmaceutical companies, while there have been others that have called this the best ""revenge"" story to be released in the past decade (apparently they missed Oldboy).  Hearing these comments shouted at me from nearly every angle, I wasn't sure what to expect from this Oscar nominated film.  I had to see it for myself.  When I walked by this shattering portrait of humanity and humility, The Constant Gardener spoke to me about at theme that many have refused to acknowledge, I saw this as an immaculate love story.  What transforms this tale from your typical romantic thriller is the way that director Fernando Meirelles has crafted his story.  Taking it from the pages of acclaimed writer John le Carr, Meirelles uses apt cinematography, non-linear storytelling, and bold characters that sweep you passionately off your feet and never put you down.  It is told convincingly and sublimely enough that emotion will grip you by the end and make you hold your loved one even closer.

I would like to quote a line form this film that I believe summarizes this film in its entirety.  I use this line because it has remained in my mind long after the final scene of this film.  The line that I refer to is said as Justin is passing, almost secretively and mean spirited, by his wife Tessa.  It is a simple line that I believe was the first time I really saw this film for what it was.  The line is, ""It's like it's a marriage of convenience and all it produces are dead offspring.""  When you read this line, especially in the context it is used in the film, it gives off the sensation of anger and hatred in a bitter, disastrous relationship.  Yet, when it is used again in this film it shows the passion in both of these characters, and really opens your eyes to the truth surrounding this amazing motion picture.  I cannot stress this idea enough, but The Constant Gardener was on the surface a thriller/espionage film, but when looked upon closer, I saw this as one of the most amazing love stories told.  That may be big of me to say, but I believe that director Fernando Meirelles has transformed the idea of your typical love story and demonstrated his cinematic power to create a genre that has been recycled through Hollywood time and again.  Meirelles has rediscovered the romantic love story and provided a modern day twist, coupled with insecurities, passion, and of course, political lies.

Again, maybe I am speaking too generally about this film, but it was difficult to see this film as a ""first-rate spy game"" as the cover of the DVD boasts.  The connection between Fiennes and Weisz is immaculate.  Never before have I witnessed a finer pairing in Hollywood.  The two ooze with passion for each other, while both securing themselves so well in their characters that you forget that they are actors.  I believe that Fiennes is one of the greatest actors of our generation.  He has this ability to play down characters, as in this film, and suddenly bring them out in such a force that you never saw it coming.  Weisz has those eyes.  By this I mean her eyes can lie to us and reveal so little.  The beginning of this film is a perfect example.  During the couple's first courtship Fiennes says something along the lines of, ""...thank you for that gift"", and she responds with some line, but her eyes say something different.  It is hard to find actresses so dedicated to finding their character completely that it was refreshing to see that in Weisz's performance.  I do believe she deserves the credit that she is finding.

The Constant Gardener worked because it was not an American story.  I find myself getting sleepy over the tales about the evils of America.  While I believe that we are at fault for several issues in this world, I do believe that seeing the British involved in an American-esque scandal only strengthened the overall tone of this film.  Yet, something impressed me by this film, midway through this movie, I couldn't care less about the political issues.  I could have cared less about the pharmaceutical statement that was attempting to be made.  What I did care about, and why I think Meirelles did such a superb job of directing this film, were the characters.  I found myself lost in the technical espionage lingo, and instead found myself glued to Justin and Tessa.  Again, their chemistry, their passion, their love, their secrets are what made this film so thrilling.  This wasn't a story about a cover-up (while that would be the film covering the surface of this movie), but instead was a story about love, marriage, and loyalty.  I found myself more excited about learning about these two people than I did about the drug scandal.  I think, at least I hope, that was Meirelles overall point of the story ... shock the audiences by throwing a love story into the mix.  I didn't see it coming when I started this film, and that is why I believe I loved this film so much.

One cannot talk about this film without talking about the power behind Meirelles' camera.  This could have been another simple Hollywood ""who-dun-it"", but instead Meirelles takes it several steps further and creates a portrait of corruption coupled with love.  His quick shots, off-centered close-ups, and grainy character camera angles were sublime.  What kept me glued to my seat were not these long, drawn out picturesque landscape scenes, but instead, flash shots coupled with beautiful imagery.  I don't know whom he uses, but it was a similar feel to his other amazing film, City of God.  In both of these, Meirelles uses modern cinematography, classic tales and plot devises, and constructs some of the best cinema to be released.  He is a master of his trade, and The Constant Gardener proves it.

Overall, I was very impressed with this film.  I was angry at the beginning, curious towards the middle, and sad by the end.  Who else can say this about an espionage caper that does not involve huge explosions or meddling bad guys?  Who else, outside of Fernando Meirelles, can capture this range of emotion in a film?  Why is his work constantly breaking boundaries in cinema and reaching better expectations each time?  He does this by keeping us, the viewers, on our toes.  He does this by not conforming to typical Hollywood standards and keeping his own sense of originality and independence.  He does this by keeping his camera modern, while his stories are not.  He does this by employing amazing actors whom are at the top of their game.  He does this by creating films like The Constant Gardener.

2453353,3,B000C65Z20,"The Constant Gardener (Ferdinand Meirelles, 2005)

Meirelles, who stunned the world a few years back with Cidade de Deus, once again shows that great foreign directors imported to America turn out less than stellar movies when off their home turf. (Look at Guillermo del Toro, who makes great movies when he goes south of the border, but then comes up here and makes things like Blade II.) to be fair, he wasn't working with the world's best source material, but the very fact of Cidade de Deus' existence shows that Meirelles does know how to handle ham-handed social-consciousness junk with considerable aplomb; here, unfortunately, none of that aplomb is in evidence.

Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), a British diplomat in Africa, learns early on in the film that his wife Tessa (Enemy at the Gates' Rachel Weisz) and her driver have been found on the road back from a weekend trip she'd spent up north with a friend of the family. From this central point, we gradually get both the stories of how we got here (starting with Justin meeting Tessa) and where we're going from here (Justin trying to dig up exactly what it was Tessa was actually doing, and how he handles his conflicting opinions about it). It's impossible to go into without spoilers, but let's just say that ""what it was Tessa was actually doing"" is thinly-disguised (when it's even disguised) attempts to rouse the viewer into some sort of righteous anger, and social activism dolled up as art is almost impossible to do in any way that makes it still resemble art. When done correctly (as it was in Cidade de Deus), it requires the message never getting in the way of the story, and it also, pretty much by definition, requires a level of ambiguity; The Constant Gardener has neither of these qualities on a consistent basis.

When the movie's on, it's pretty firmly on; Weisz is a good actress when the script doesn't have her spouting nave homily, and there's a decent complement of thinking-man's action film stuff (by ""thinking man's action film,"" I mean that stuff doesn't blow up nearly as much as you think it should, but there are still many of the hallmarks of a spy thriller; think of the first Mission: Impossible flick). Unfortunately, it likes to swerve off the track a good deal, and could easily have been half an hour shorter.

Not bad; a pleasant way to kill two hours. But certainly could have been a lot better. ** ",1139184000,,2404,4.714285714285714
2453354,5,B000C65Z20,"""Constant Gardner"" is a riveting movie!  It starts off as an ordinary love story between the two main characters played by Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz.  Soon into the movie Rachel's character of Tessa (wife of Fiennes's Justin Quayle) is killed off with Quayle as played by Ralph Fiennes trying to find out the ""why"".  He, of course, finds out that there was FAR more to his wife than he thought.  That ""far more"" makes a wonderful thriller filled with all kinds of unsavory characters involving the continent of Africa and its healthcare for the masses with loads of money involved.

The film kept me riveted to the screen trying to keep the ""goings on"" ""straight"" in my head.  At the same time that the movie is being a thriller it never loses the ""Love Story"" element.  I always was made fully aware, at all times, that the movie was primarily about the love shared between the two main characters.

2453357,4,B000C65Z20,"The most significant thing about this movie is that it stands head and shoulders above most others released on DVD over this last year or so. I would love to say that this is because of the enduring qualities of the opposition but I cannot. Relatively speaking it is one of the better movies of the year but sadly, that is not saying very much.

I loved several things about the movie, beginning with the aerial shot of the birds over the lake. I am a sucker for good photography and that piece is exquisite. I relished too, the live shots among the locations and with the indigenous people. Far more realistic and inclusive than In My Country for example, and generating a greater impact than would otherwise have been the case. The cast in general was strong and I feel that Ralph Fiennes is almost becoming stereotyped in the strong, quiet man role which was very reminiscent of the English patient.

For me though the best parts of the movie were the way in which the flashbacks and current time were intermeshed which brought a great deal of reality to the proceedings. The things that he took for granted or did not pay attention to at the time assume a different significance in hindsight and his focus on his garden leads him to take for granted his wife's deep love for him. How like real life this is. Coupled with that was the interplay of dark political and human forces around him which are not in his vision which is focussed on tending his plants but which finally subsumes them culminating in the end set in the desert.

On the debit side, I think that the plot does not live up to earlier La Carre work. Set in the more contempoary world of global politics, his knowledge of the machinations of those involved in national and international politics is a little thinner here although there is clearly a good dose of reality in the concerns about the power of multinational corporations and their ability to use that power ruthlessly. It seems to me too that the author should rest his representation of the wives of the central character to be wayward and perceived to be untrustworthy. Whilst in this case, the evidence absolves her of these charges, the fact that Le Carre needs to use such a device once more detracts from the plot. I was a little uneasy too about the ease with which Ralph Fieenes manages to get back to Africa after his passport is confiscated. For a mid ranking Foreign Office official he certainly proves to be very capable.

Overall I award four stars to this movie. One of only a handful of better movies of the last twelve months. It raises some serious moral questions about nations, and transnational organisations in the twenty-first century but is a pretty good movie too.",1138752000,,2719,4.588477366255144

Other than the main performances by Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz (sp?), the beautiful music, and the extras (including deleted scenes and the cool, complete 8 minute play that the film only shows snippets of)...I found this film somewhat boring, unengaging, with a choppy flow. For example, the scene when Ralph takes the train, the images on screen are hard to watch as it flashes with quick images of buildings, sky, monuments. Quite jarring and difficult for me to enjoy. It seemed to me that the director was trying to be a bit too artsy by using supposedly hip-looking shots.

The story is somewhat hard to follow. I couldn't keep track of all the names and who was who most of the time. John LeCarre might be a suspense master, but I'm currently reading John Grisham's ""The King of Torts"" that covers similar ground: a literary hero taking on ""the evil pharmaceutical company."" Grisham does it better and I hope someone in Hollywood greenlights that novel for a motion picture. As for ""The Constant Gardner"", I had to constantly shake myself awake as I watched this film. Maybe next time, I'll be weary about seeing a film based on near universal critical acclaim. Sometimes, film critics are just drinking the same Kool-Aid...so don't believe their hype on this film.

Cast:  Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Hubert Kounde, Danny Huston, Daniele Harford, Packson Ngugi, Bill Nighy, Keith Pearson.

Running Time:  129 minutes

Rated R for language, some violent images and sexual content/nudity.

""The Constant Gardener"" seeks to juggle three film styles-the romance, the thriller, and provocative social realism. On all three levels, the film succeeds, especially with the latter.  Much credit should go to director Fernando Meirelles, who has synthesized a virtual textbook of different film techniques. The uses of set-ups, location filming, lenses, film editing, and close-ups were simply dazzling. While the panoramic scenes of the African landscape were breathtaking, there was a starkly contrasting approach to the close-ups in the scenes in the city. The jittery, hand-held camera sequences added to the dramatic tension and underscored the urgency of coming to terms with poverty and disease.  The romantic portion of the film was anchored by the two characters played by Ralph Fiennes (Justin) and Rachel Weisz (Tessa). Their first meeting was dynamically presented as Tessa was a social activist heckling Justin as he was making a political speech. When the hall was cleared, however, it was Justin who was actually comforting Tessa after her outburst. The juxtaposition of the placid, passive Justin versus the fervent, hyper-kinetic Tessa was brilliantly established in that opening scene.

The strands of thriller and social realism are inextricably tied together in the film. As a whodunit, ""The Constant Gardener"" seeks to uncover what actually happened to Justin and Tessa on their African journey. At the same time, the main culprit that emerges is the heavy hand of greed as the pharmaceutical companies exploit helpless victims of tuberculosis for the purpose of testing and marketing an experimental drug. At one point in the film, it is disclosed to Justin that the pharmaceutical industry is no different than ""arms dealers.""  Fiennes gives his most humanistic and endearing performance ever, perhaps even topping his Oscar nominated turns in ""Schindler's List"" and ""The English Patient."" Rachel Weisz is an illuminating revelation, turning in the performance of her career. Her character develops and becomes even more compelling after she dies and we learn her secrets through expertly paced flashbacks. Director Fernando Meirelles takes the amazing style he honed with ""City of God"" and adds a heart with ""The Constant Gardener,"" a big heart that bleeds a beautiful cinematic poeticism onto the screen.

This film truly rewards it audience as it works on so many levels. Like this year's earlier word-of-mouth and hot-button issue sleeper, ""Crash,"" you won't be able to stop talking about it after you view the film. The politics here are engaging and bound to stir up even the most complacent viewer. What's even more amazing is that all of the timely political discourse and subsequent thriller aspects of the film (courtesy of the source material, John Le Carre's novel) are wrapped up in a timeless romance. We, the audience, join Fiennes on his journey, and we rediscover the love story between he and his wife that anchors the film in a poetic realism usually reserved for movies with much less on their minds.  Meirelles again shows us he is a true artist willing to show both the shocking beauty and abject horror of the people and places that populate his films. Again he delivers a message that people are doing horrible things to other people the world over (be it in the form of wishy-washy governments turning a blind eye, greedy corporations putting a price tag on a human life, local thugs preying on the misfortune of their neighbors, or friends betraying friends).  Not a perfect film by any means and not for all, but an impressive effort from a fine director and an appealing drama that has many intelligent, thought-provoking layers.",1138406400,,3936,5.236883942766296

2453363,1,B000C65Z20,"We were on holidays in Melbourne, and it was 43 degrees Celsius (109 Fahrenheit), so an air-conditioned cinema seemed like a safe escape.  Ha.  No, the cinema proved to be a dark box filled with disappointment.  For much of this film I felt as if a large thumb was pressed against the side of my head and I was being asked to attest to enjoying wanton displays of stupidity - a stupid plot, stupid characters, and idiotic editing and cinematography - the latter, specifically the unmotivated and constant use of jittering hand-held effects, induced a physical headache and nausea - this subsided after walking out - a prochlorperazine tablet might also have been of use.

I fear this was meant to be a plot-driven thriller.  Sadly, the audience is virtually told the 'secret' within the first quarter hour. So, at this point, presumably the film becomes a character-led drama; however, none of the characters are believable - few of their actions make any sense.  Central to this is Rachel Weisz's and Ralph Fiennes' ""marriage"" - she tells him nothing about her ""work"" - the overtly stated reason for reticence is her desire to protect him, yet even cursory thought would suggest that no outsider would suspect him of being excluded from her knowledge and consequently her protection is utterly ineffectual.  At no level is the audience privy to any emotional intimacy between them - at best she sees him as ""safe"", much in the way she might see a cuddly toy, or a grandfather in a cardigan pottering in his garden.  The relationship has not been thought through by the author - I can imagine some viewers finding superficially attractive elements in both characters and feeling that these were enough to establish empathy, but then the same might well be said of the cast of ""Friends"", or the models in a Garnier ""Fructis"" advertisement.

The plot, as stated in most reviews, involves corruption between government officials and a pharmaceutical corporation - Rachel Weisz's character, Tess Quayle, has incriminating evidence - this evidence, for no apparent reason, is not disseminated.  It becomes embodied in an actual letter - why?  She has the internet, she has contacts.  Was that Canon all-in-one fax, scanner, copier defective? The stupidity of this is so frustrating that one might be tempted to quietly weep.

On a more serious note, the director feels obliged to tell his audience what to think.  The premiss that the poor of Africa, and elsewhere, are exploited by Western corportions and governments is not contestable - it is hardly hidden, but look at Amnesty's website, et al, for further disclosures - yet the actual scenario depicted is not as clear-cut as the director suggests.  Without elaborating too much, if a drug could avert an epidemic, what is an acceptable cost in terms of side-effects?  What is an acceptable trade-off in terms of development time, especially since it is by no means certain that a 'safer' variant could be developed.  To answer these questions details are crucial, and even then debate would necessarily ensue.  The director does not seem interested in debate, but rather would like a world of the blessed and the damned, the goodies and the baddies, and paints his cast, and the issues, accordingly.

The cinematography at least provides some vistas of Africa and these are in the main disturbing.  Yet the editor feels compelled to have no shot last longer than two seconds.  This staccato of images is as cliched as the ubiquitous pop video clip - at times I expected a flashed shot of a lead guitarist, sweat flung from stringy hair, cut to a bald drummer earnestly bashing his Zildjian, and then back to Africa and Ralph's slightly gummy bewilderment.  Overexposed colours for the shanty-towns, a palette of greys and blues for the dreary mother country - it's not only obvious, but preechy and condescending.

This is a badly crafted film.  A coherent dissection of the ills of Africa and the morality, or lack thereof, of Western policies towards the developing world, it is not.  Nor is it an engrossing love story - it feels as empty as Ralph Fiennes toothless smile.  For those expecting the raw shock of Meirelles ""City of God"", look elsewhere.",1138320000,,4205,4.903954802259887

I feel that The Constant Gardener is a movie about the cover up of the pharmaceutical industry as it relates to the diseases of tuberculosis and AIDS in Africa.  The critics have said that this is also a love story.  However, I feel that it is more a story of lies and betrayal.  I don't see how it can be a love story.  When the wife is lying to her husband about what she's doing, or perhaps just neglecting to tell him what she's doing.

The first hour of the movie is very slow with a lot of exposition.  The second hour of the movie is better.  Once we get into the meat of the story.

2453366,4,B000C65Z20,"This film, above all things, is an insightful look at what the world has come to.  To see the conditions of those living in Africa is enough to make you tear up, but to see the common disregard by those of higher economic living is even more painful to see.  The film revolves around Justin Quayle (Fiennes) as he searches for answers to his wifes brutal murder.  What he uncovers is that his wife Tessa (Weisz) and her friend Arthur (McCabe) have been working to uncover a conspiracy involving big drug companys and their iligal and unethical testing on African's.  As Justin digs deeper to uncover th truth he finds himself playing a game with his life, and he finds that everyone he trusted, everyone he loved may in fact be working against him.  No one is what they seem and just when you least expect it they will show you their true colors.  Supporting actors are many but few stand out like Danny Huston who plays friend Sandy Woodrow, a man Justin thought he knew, but will soon know better than he thought.  Very well thought out thriller that keeps you guessing and keeps you thinking through to the end.  My only regret is that Fiennes acting seemed slightly forced at times.  There is one scene though, towards the end when he's staring through a window and crying remembering his wife and that scene I felt really captured the essence of the loss his character was facing.  Weisz was amazing as was Huston...great thills and great story addressing a global problem thats slipping right under our noses.  4 1/2 stars for me...well worth a watch.",1138233600,,1557,4.605072463768116
2453367,5,B000C65Z20,"The Constant Gardener isn't just a movie, it truly is an experience.

The story follows Justin Quayle on his journey through Africa after his wife, Tessa, is found murdered alongside an African country road.  Justin is a British diplomat, and Tessa had taken up her own antics while they were living in Africa.  And someone wanted her dead because she was digging too deep at something.  This is the basic plotline of The Constant Gardener.  This is a film about murder, revenge, politics, and faith.  The film is very political, and is not afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve.

What makes a film good? Is it the story?  The action sequences?  The acting?  In the case of The Constant Gardener, it's all three of these.  The only flaw of the film is the pacing with which Fernando Meirelles directs.  The film seems to drag on at some points, but whenever it focuses back on the central story, and Justin's quest to find the truth, the film is truly captivating.  The film is even heartbreaking at moments.  The most powerful moment of the film comes when Justin finally breaks down and shows his grief when he returns to Tessa's home in Britain, and is greeted by flashbacks of their first intimate moments together.  Ralph Fiennes is an amazingly talented actor.  I still consider him not getting an Oscar for Schindler's List one of the greatest travesties of all time.  Fiennes is typically great in this film.  In my opinion, he deserves the Oscar for best actor, but he won't get it; too bad.  Rachel Weisz does an admiral job as Tessa Quayle, but nothing groundbreaking from her end.  The best character second to Fiennes' Justin Quayle is Bernard Pelligrim, played exquisitely by Bill Nighy, who is fast becoming one of my favorite actors.  Even though he is in the film sparingly, the few scenes he are in he completely takes over.  Nighy has a great ability seem inviting yet dangerous at the same time.

Maybe the best part of The Constant Gardener, though, is its realism.  The ending is absolutely perfect for the film.  Some average movie-goers will probably be unhappy with the way film ends, but I admire the courage of a screenwriter/director to stick to his beliefs and end a film the best way he thinks possible.  The ending leaves you shaken, and thinking back on the whole film, and the importance of the subject matter at hand.  Believe me, I'm no bleeding heart, but this film did strike me in a way I did not expect it to.  It made me angry, it made me feel desperate, but most of all, it made me see how the world works sometimes, and how most of us are helpless to change the big scheme of things, but we can all do our small part.

The movie is best summed up in a quote that is said twice during the film, once by Justin and once by Tessa.  In both situations they are trying to help a single, suffering African civilian, and are told that there are ""thousands who need help, and this is only one,"" to which they both reply: ""But this is one we can help.""

The movie starts with Justin Quayle, played by Ralph Fiennes, meeting his wife-to-be Tessa, excellently played by Rachel Weisz, while giving a speech at a conference.  Tessa is frustrated by the whole speech issue and she makes her objections so loudly that the rest of the journalists and reporters leave the room.  This leaves Tessa and Justin all alone.  After introducing themselves to each other and Tessa apologizing for being rude, it is predictable that they fall for each other.

The mood shifts when things start to go awry.  Tessa becomes involved in some political issues that she keeps well-hidden from Justin.  As the movie goes along, you kind of get the impression that Tessa is having an affair.  You'll have to watch for yourself to see if this is the case.

2453392,2,B000C65Z20,"I was really looking forward to this film.  The buzz from critics was largely positive, I liked the actors, the director's previous effort left me hopeful, and, though not LeCarre's best novel, certainly provocative and topical enough to make a terrific film (with the book's weaknesses filtered out).  Wrong.  The ""Constant Gardener"" is yet another example of read the book (if you must).  Basically, the book is about how Evil Pharmaceutical companies (with Political help) are using Africans as guinea pigs as they pursue the next big money making drug.  Ever since the Soviet Union fell LeCarre has been left to find another bookend to match his corrupt West.  By now he's quit looking, so he vents his spleen (not undeservedly) on the West.  The problem is he can't seem to learn that less is more.  The lessons from, for example, Greene's ""Quiet American,"" with all its use of nuance but at the same time clear condemnation of American policies in Vietnam would, you would think, be obvious to a seasoned writer such as LeCarre.  Well, no.  LeCarre's confusing of  shrill lecturing as substance shows him, sadly, the lesser writer.  I'm not saying that ""Constant Gardener"" is a bad book, it is interesting, and the didactic weaknesses are at least spread out over a long novel.

The movie is another matter.  It magnifies the very weaknesses that you would like to see muted.  Early on crusading ""activist"" Tessa (soon to be Quayle) (Rachel Weisz) gives an passionate denunciation of Iraqi policy while attending a press forum hosted by her husband to be Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes).  It's an embarrassing moment (for the viewer as well) that turns into ""Love.""  Maybe.  Problem is that Tessa is very manipulative - so much so that it's difficult to be sympathetic, despite all her trumpeted high ideals.  Justin is your classic LeCarre sympathetic lover - who must step beyond the gray bureaucracy of his life to prove (to himself?) he indeed cares about Love (see Winston Smith in Orwell's ""1984"").  Tessa becomes his Beatrice as he crisscrosses Africa and Europe in search of the Truth behind his wife's tragic fate, while sinister forces follow closely behind.  This all sounds fine, but as film it's very confusing.  Having read the book I knew what was going on, but I wonder how it plays for someone who has not.  One major problem is the cinema photography of director Fernando Meirelles (""City of God"").  Meirelles employs a lot of flashbacks (seemingly of the handheld camera kind) in ""Constant Gardener,"" so much so that the characters rarely get any traction as people.  The intent is to convey urgency and ""realism.""  Instead it results in a collage of cryptic images that never give you enough meat as to just what the story is about and who the characters are as people.  Characters, some important, some not, just pop up, say something that seems important, and then disappear again. And near the end, there is another embarrassing moment, another embarrassing speech, that tries to lead the viewer by the hand by wagging a finger.  If you want political drama of a coherent and literary kind, check out ""The Quiet American"" (movie and book).",1137715200,,3166,4.889305816135084
2453393,5,B000C65Z20,"Nope, it ain't the blistering spy thriller of a Jason Bourne or James Bond and, well, it ain't all that thrilling, but there are layers and depth in this movie that hold it high above the tripe shown in the last couple of years.

For a start, it's about something real. Le Carre confirm in a DVD extra interview, that he planned to make the central conflict something else but a friend convinced him to go for the pharmaceutical companies.

Second, the book boggled Hollywood - Le Carre says in the same interview that the big studios turned it down because ""African movies weren't in."" So the book went to a small producer who got a small director and it became a labor or love and it shows.

Third, the depth of characters is great. Ralph Fienne's character hears his wife whisper about it being a ""marriage of convenience"", assumes their marriage is falling apart and when he investigates her death, hears her report where she talks about the pharmaceutical companies and government being in a marriage of convenience. He had mis-heard his wife, mis-judged their marriage. In an amazing scene, his wife wants to stop to help a woman who is walking with her child. Ralph Fiennes launches into a big speech about how they can't help them all. His wife claims ""we can help this one person"", but Ralph Fienne remains steadfast. Later, when his character has gone through a personal change, he tries to save a young girl by taking her on a plane. The pilot gives Ralph Fienne's character the same argument Ralph Fiennes had given his wife.

This movie is about growth, awareness. It is beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, with great dialogue and pitch-perfect, thundering pacing. People who find it dull might head to other movies like Deuce Bigelow: European Gigolo.",1137628800,,1768,4.76797385620915
2453394,3,B000C65Z20,"OK, here's the scoop: multinational pharmaceutical mega-corporations don't give a flying f*ck about anyone or anything other than maximizing profits and increasing stock values; there are tons of corrupt politicians/bureaucrats/cops in not only poor Third World countries but also morally hypocritical Western countries who are all too ready to collude with these evil corporations; Africa's massive, starving and diseased poor are used as unwitting human guinea pigs for drug testing while Western governments continue to coddle Big Pharma in about a million different ways; nobody but a tiny sliver of determined activists knows about all this and actually tries to do something about it before they are silenced, persecuted, or even snuffed out.

Got it? Of course this being based on a work of fiction, a certain amount of embellishment and poetic license is to be assummed, but the overall Big Picture is mostly spot-on: ruthless and shameless megacorporations run most Western governments these days, there is no shortage of ruthless and shamless Western politicians to help them along, and finally (this last point is not emphasized much unfortunately) the vast majority of the Western populace is ignorant, willfully ignorant, or downright apathetic about it.

Those are most of the economic and political revelations that this film tries to convey---the problem is, instead of doing so in a straightforward documentary format it feels compelled to bundle it together with a clumsy thriller/love-story of a potboiler plot that is woefully predictable and pious.  Rachel Weiszc plays the requisite sacrificial virgin/crusader while her meek, complacent but sincere husband (Ralph Fiennes) first begins to doubt her fidelity and then her sanity, before events lead him to join her in anti-Big-Pharma martyrdom in some properly scenic desolation of a dried up African lake.

2453430,5,B000C65Z20,"John le Carr&eacute;'s novel THE CONSTANT GARDENER is one of his finer suspense/spy/thriller stories and screenwriter Jeffrey Caine kept the story and the technique of telling it intact in this successful film.  Director Fernando Meirelles was an excellent choice for director, bringing a fresh new look to Hollywood actions movies, a look that involves camera work, atmosphere, mirrors to society, and use of actors and vistas of Africa to drive the message behind this story home.

Proper High Commissioner Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) serves his British government with the same diligence with which he tends his garden of potted plants.  He is a constant diplomat and a constant gardener, never veering from his mission - until he meets mouthy smart rebellious Tessa (Rachel Weisz) in a classroom where he has literally 'read' a lecture for an absentee professor.  Her rage at the Establishment is calmed by Justin's quiet manner and in no time they have bedded, courted  and are on their way to an assignment in Kenya.  Once in Africa Tessa's forthright manner embarrasses everyone connected with government, but the couple are happy and trusting, and the now- pregnant Tessa discovers a secret plot for the unmonitored testing of an anti-tuberculosis drug (a threat of a mutant form of TB that will annihilate much of the world's population is the justification) on unknowing people of Kenya.  Tessa rails against the concept of human guinea pigs, finds a colleague in a Kenyan doctor Arnold (Hubert Kound&eacute;) and together they, undercover, investigate the connection between the drug company manufacturing the drug and the governments of England and Kenya. While proper Justin is keeping the peace with his confr&egrave;res Sandy (Danny Huston) and Sir Bernard Pellegrin (Bill Nighy) and nurturing Tessa after they lose their pregnancy. Tessa's rage is inflamed and while off on an assignment with Arnold she is brutally murdered (and Arnold is likewise brutally tortured and crucified).  Justin's world is shaken and his constancy is reversed in taking up where Tessa left off - working to uncover the truth about the scandalous coups. From here the story speeds along with twists and turns and the ending is unexpected.

Meirelles captures both the suffocating stifle of British politics and the breathtaking majesty and poverty of Kenya with uncanny skill.  His lighting is all natural and the camera work is basically hand held, intensifying the credibility of the story of a few people against enormous odds - medically, socially, and in the seething corruption of the governments.  He balances the tension by the use of flashbacks to moments when Justin and Tessa were courting and making love and living  and laughing, and these non-linear techniques offer breathing space for the story's propulsive drive.  The actors are superb: this is his finest role for Fiennes in years and for once Weisz is given a character into whom she can breathe all of her expertise as an actress.

Yes, there are flaws in the story and some holes of information that could use patching, but in the final result this is a movie of power, of message, and of technical finesse that makes it one of the finer of the year.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, January 06",1137024000,,3263,5.093808630393997
2453431,5,B000C65Z20,"THE CONSTANT GARDNER is one of those films that sneaks up on you and bites you in the butt. Mislabeled as a ""thriller"", this movie packs a wallop of a punch, leading into the lives of a man tortured by the murder of his wife, yet showing us an intimate love story that unfolds after her death.

The setting is present day Africa and the man is Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes, THE ENGLISH PATIENT), a British diplomat who struggles with a strong-willed wife (Rachel Weisz, THE MUMMY) named Tessa. Tessa is throwing a wrench into the works of the multimillion dollar operations of the pharmaceutical industry that use African men and women as test subjects for new drugs. And one of these new medicines (which is poised to make billions of dollars) may be killing people.

With too much money at stake, the drug company - that happens to be backed by the British government - takes its own action and kills Tessa.

Now Justin is on the case, trying to uncover what it was his wife had discovered and who was behind her murder. As he travels this road, though, he battles within himself the thoughts that Tessa may have been unfaithful ...only to learn that her love for him knew no bounds.

______________________________________________________________________________

The direction of THE CONSTANT GARDNER by Fernando Meirelles is fascinating. His unorthodox use of scattered events and time allowed for some interesting aspects, most notably a character flow that grew backwards from the story ...for a while. About halfway through the movie the continual forward motion of time starts up, with no flashbacks, and allows the viewer to see a pleasant (if somewhat fatalistic) ending.

There's no heavy-handed message that forces itself upon the viewer, either. Like immersing yourself in a steaming hot-tub, this film also gently lowers you into its waters, giving you a feel for what might lay ahead.

It was also nice to see characters that were so multifaceted. Friends became enemies, enemies became friends, and acquaintances could very well help or kill any one of the movie's main characters.

That's what a movie is--a story with visuals, not the other way around.  Yes, beautiful scenery is terrific, but enough already with the over-saturated colors--they're distracting and remind us we're watching a movie.  Ditto for the jittery hand-held camera work.  Also, has there ever been a widely successful film with a Le Carre script and/or storyline?  No, and here's why:  His stories purport to be thrillers, only they're not thrilling.  They're just unlikely, incoherent and relentlessly downbeat.  Justin's ""love"" for Tessa and his willingness to forego continued existence because of the memory of it seemed unlikely to me.  She was a spoiled, wealthy brat who had almost no time and even less room in her life for Justin.  She lied to him constantly except for the one time she was honest with him when she admitted that her ""work"" (poking the Establishment in the eye with a sharp stick) was everything and that her life was nothing without it.  Additionally, the motive for her grand crusade went unexamined.  It seems that a drug company has discovered a cure for drug-resistant TB which will forestall a coming pandemic which will sweep the globe.  Unfortunately, the drug is not perfect and there have been ""some"" deaths in the trials.  How many?  1 in 10?  1 in 1,000?  This isn't revealed.  And when is this global outbreak of untreatable TB expected to break out?  If the pandemic is to begin imminently, then these are acceptable risks considering the alternative (no treatment).  If the pandemic is to start in 5 or 10 years then the market will address the problem with another drug company producing a safer treatment.  For a so-called ""thinking-person's""-type movie there doesn't seem to have been a lot of thought put into the crux of the plot.  The storyline is as jarring as the camerawork.

Gradually, the focus changes and the political thriller takes over with the love story taking a back seat but Meirelles never loses sight of what motivates Justin's investigation and how this affects him.

Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz have great chemistry together and are very believable as a couple in the way they talk to each other and the intimacy between them feels very genuine. Fiennes turns in another excellent performance as a complacent diplomat whose world is turned upside down when he meets Tessa and this upheaval continues even after her death. The veteran actor conveys an emotional depth and vulnerability that makes us care about his plight. There is a scene where he learns of Tessa's death and it is a beautifully understated yet emotionally powerful one. Meirelles keeps the camera on Fiennes the entire time and we see disbelief and then grief wash over his face as he tries to keep it all contained. We empathize with his situation and want to see him expose the conspiracy that resulted in his wife's death.

The Constant Gardener shows the complex, political quagmire that exists in Africa. While its people starve and die from disease every day, their leaders get rich from deals with powerful corporations and American and British politicians. The film sheds light on the problems that plague Africa and why it is taking so long to help these people. It points the finger at the powerful pharmaceutical companies that charge these poor, third world countries outrageous prices and then take their sweet time sending much needed medicine to them. The Constant Gardener is a finely crafted political thriller that starts off as a character piece and then becomes an absorbing thriller that asks some tough questions about what exactly is going in Africa and what is happening to those people.

There are four deleted scenes totaling ten minutes that flesh out more details of the story and reveal more evidence of the conspiracy.

Also included is an ""Extended Scene: Haruma - Play in Kenya"" that features the entire outdoor morality play that was only featured briefly in the movie.

""Embracing Africa: Filming in Kenya"" examines what it was like to shoot in Africa in many of the places that Le Carre describes in his novel and this gives the film an authenticity. The film crew worked hard not to disrupt the peoples' lives there as much as possible.

""John Le Carre: From Page to Screen"" takes a look at the source material - Le Carre's novel - and how it was adapted into a movie. Hollywood wasn't interested in it because it dealt with Africa and so it took a British movie producer who believed sincerely in the book to get it made with European money.

2453456,4,B000C65Z20,"Jameson Thottam for the Constant Gardner

""The Constant Gardener"" features two of the best performances of the year in one of the most intelligent thrillers I've ever seen. That being said, the intelligence factor is so high, that it totally lost me the first time I previewed the film. After it came out, I researched a little into the subject matter and the novel by John Le Carre. The film is so realistic and organic, almost documentary-style, that all the plot points occur very subtly. The film's style imitates real life, and it is truly frightening how intelligent and knowledgeable the director, Fernando Meirelles, and author are on the subject of drug company partnerships and the AIDS medicine crisis in Africa. Let me say, the film is above most people's intelligence level. I don't know if any of it is true or there's any gravity to it. But I do know there are two stellar performances amidst the headache of history and information that is ""The Constant Gardener"".

""Here's The Scoop"" Jameson Thottam

Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) is a diplomat with the British High Commission. He meets Tessa (Rachel Weisz), an activist, at a press conference after she attacks him and Britain's foreign policies. They end making love, getting married, and having a baby on the way. Tessa wants to accompany Justin to Kenya to investigate what drugs pharmaceutical companies are testing on the poor. Once there, she and her driver, Arnold (Hubert Kounde), are murdered in their vehicle.

Justin begins an investigation and personal odyssey to discover what got Tessa killed. He wants to understand what she knew and what she was keeping from him. His colleague from the Commission, Sandy (Danny Huston), discourages him, as well as the Commission head, Sir Pellegrin (Bill Nighy), who Tessa had constantly confronted. The many facts, information, letters, associates, computer videos, and threats Justin uncovers occur in the last intellectually challenging half of the film.

""Don't want to Reveal too Much"" James Thottam

I haven't revealed much by saying Tessa is murdered, since it takes place during the first scene of the film. The story is told in fragments, past and present, looking back at Tessa and what she knew that got her killed. As mentioned, the last half involves Justin's investigation, and it is during these scenes audiences will decide if they like the film. For it is these scenes that really explore the subject matter in an oftentimes brutal and cynical way.

""How about the Performance"" Jameson L Thottam

But plot aside, what about the performances? Both the leads give Oscar-caliber performances that absolutely give this film a different level. Fiennes is at once charismatic and diplomatic as Justin. He projects a controlled sadness and rage. He always makes his character interested, as well as interesting to watch. When he learns of his wife's death early in the film, watch his expression. It is totally controlled, and we immediately feel sorry for him.

But it is Weisz, as the activist Tessa, who gives ""The Constant Gardener"" purpose. The actress is on-screen for less than the first 45 minutes, and she is able to emit kindness, love, concern, and controlled anger all at once. There are two scenes that really did it for me. While she is in the hospital, she has just been through some mild trauma, yet she is still able to pull over Sandy, Justin's colleague, and announce the doctors are killing their patients with test drugs. Weisz plays the character not in a begging type of way but a concerned way. She's an activist who acts, even as she lies in the hospital bed under emotional distress. The other scene involves her and Sandy again. Tessa wants Sandy to give her a letter but Sandy refuses. Tessa offers herself in exchange for the letter. Weisz announces Tessa's offer of adultery so plainly that it is terrifying. But we understand the stakes and what she really cares about. It is an outstanding performance.

""Conclusions"" Jameson Thottam

Two great performances to be exact in a pretty good movie. ""The Constant Gardener"" will mean different things to different people. Deciding the film wasn't clear enough in its information to be labeled a great film is my opinion. The direction is still top-notch and controlled. Meirelles knew where he was heading with the subject matter. The last few scenes, in particular, are directed, edited, and handled so well that you forget you had to go through the many investigations of Justin to get to this point. Want to test your intelligence level? Go see ""The Constant Gardener"".

His is about order, about cultivating and perfecting the structures of civilization (a gardener, after all).  Hers is about activism, revolution, and face-to-face intervention on behalf of the needy.  In each their own way, they are idealists and they nurture and respect each other as such.  He admires her courage and passion; she admires his discipline and sensitivity.  He tends towards being aloof, she towards recklessness, and each is punished as the story progresses.  Little domestic scenes, e.g. one where she tells him he's the type who would  ""buy the angry mob fish and chips while waiting for law and order to return"", are acted out very well.

The suspense in the film builds steadily as you wonder what it was she was investigating, whether her suspicions were correct, whether she was unfaithful to him/who the father of her child is, whether he will believe she was unfaithful, whether he can figure out who killed her, what he can do to make the perpetrators accountable, and what happens to him next.  The film gives you time to ponder these things - none of the above questions are stated with very much urgency - and it's nice to have a plot that isn't just about One Big Mystery.

One weakness of the film is that although it is purportedly about Africa, there are hardly any Africans in it.  There's an African doctor, but his character isn't developed very well at all.  In general, the Africans are portrayed as very passive: as recipients of medical aid, as servants and gardeners who need instruction, as victims of corporate exploitation, as corrupt officials easily cowed by stern, white envoys.  Et cetera.

Granted, there's mention of an African activist that Tessa wants to travel to meet and a brief scene depicting a local theatre group doing AIDS education, but they're both very much in the background.  I'm not pedantic enough to go back with a stopwatch and check, but I'm pretty sure the scenes of flamingos in flight are longer than the ones of grassroots efforts by African people on their own behalf.

So although the story is interesting, the acting good, and the African setting beautifully filmed, there's no escaping that this is solidly a movie about Europeans, and not about Africa.",1136332800,,2523,4.864168618266979

With this complicated thriller, Meirelles ""went Hollywood,"" meaning bigger stars and bigger budget, but he didn't abandon his knack for clear storytelling, beautiful visuals and his ability to create a setting that's exotic yet filled with danger. The film, based upon a John Le Carre novel, centers on a stuffy, boring British official working in Kenya named Justin Quayle, played by Ralph Fiennes. At the film's beginning, Quayle's pregnant, activist wife Tessa is killed by a Kenyan roadside, and it's suggested that a friend killed her in a crime of passion. Quayle, suspecting he didn't actually know Tessa at all, goes back over his memories of their lightning-quick courtship and marriage and through all of her things in an attempt to discover who she was and what really happened to her. Rachel Weisz gives her best performance to date as Tessa. Though the murder is key to the plot, the real mystery that Quayle tries to solve is Tessa herself, and Weisz is able to play her in flashbacks as a sometimes tender, sometimes volatile, thoroughly passionate woman whose motives are always suspect. THE CONSTANT GARDENER succeeds at what other films this year, like THE INTERPRETER, tried and failed.

2453461,4,B000C65Z20,"""The constant gardener"" is an extremely good movie that could have been exceptional but somehow doesn't reach that point. All the same, I think it is the kind of film you will appreciate, specially if you enjoy a good thriller, great actors, and the opportunity to watch the beautiful African scenery.

The plot is based on a novel by John Le Carre, who said that ""The constant gardener"" is an excellent adaptation of his book of the same name, even though it is quite different from it. In my opinion, the director, Fernando Meirelles, should be recognized for doing an excellent job in what ended up being an outstanding (and thouroughly non-linear) film. Even though I didn't like this movie as much as I loved Meirelles' previous film, ""City of God"", it easy to see that he retains his gift for surprising the spectator, and treating him with scenes of astonishing beauty.

The plot is, in general, the same of the book. Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), the main character, is an extremely polite English diplomat working in the British Embassy in Kenya. He who has only two passions in his life: gardening  and his wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz). Tessa isn't overly conventional, and can be downright rude when she is defending one of her many causes, while Justin is taking care of his garden. Despite their differences, they complement each other. Justin, oblivious to the reality that surrounds him in Kenya, grounds himself in Tessa, and can't imagine his life without her.

Unfortunately, when some hired guns kill Tessa, Justin will have to learn if he will be able to live in a world without Tessa. His more immediate concern, however, is why was she killed. Justin's life is thrown into turmoil, and danger abounds, as he learns that Tessa was investigating the shady dealings of an important pharmaceutical company working in Kenya. But what did she discovered? Justin won't stop until he learns just that, finishing what his wife started.

On the whole, I think I can recommend this movie as high-quality entertainment, fast-paced enough to engage even those who don't like ""slow"" films.  Heartily recommended!

2453462,5,B000C65Z20,"For years John le Carre has be turning out splendid spy novels, some better than others, but he can be counted on to hit on a plot line that draws us in and spins us around in an absorbing and entertaining way.  I read the novel before seeing the film, and I'm glad I did:  I highly recommend this order:  book first, film second.  What makes the movie so successful is that Meirelles lets the story tell itself without forcing it along.  It is not strictly a linear approach, since there are a number of flashbacks, but I didn't feel any sense of contrivance on the part of the filmmaker.

Fiennes is solid as the title character, a Englishman thru and thru, more wedded to his plants and to his job as a mid-level diplomat than to his vibrant and headstrong young wife, played with great passion by Rachel Weisz, an actress with wonderful smarts ( we know that she's as clever as any man in the cast from the moment we hear her in conversation ).

Africa is a hotbed of conflict, whether it be the political turmoil in this country of that, or the rampant diseases that are ravaging families, or the famines that kill as many children as the epidemics, or the soulless profiteering by global consortiums.  Le Carre uses the greed of a particular drug company and the victimization of hapless African TB sufferers as the springboard for his drama, and it makes for good cinema.  We love the underdogs; we chafe at the way the Bad British Bureaucrats are covering up for the drug companies; we want justice, justice and more justice.

And, fortunately, Mierelles gives us realism, unapologetic and unsentimental.  This is why the film succeeds.  There are very few Rocky Balboas when it comes down to it.",1129248000,,1704,4.569078947368421
2453463,5,B000C65Z20,"John Le Carre has found his ideal cinematic interpreters in screenwriter Jeffrey Caine and director Fernando Meirelles. Caine has made a thrilling, urgent screenplay out of Le Carre's novel ""The Constant Gardener,"" and Meirelles--building on the success of his debut film ""City of God""--creates a breathlessly compelling portrait of a world in chaos, thanks to the greed and cruelty of corporate-government hotshots who see the world's poor only as so many guinea pigs. Meirelles, once again demonstrating his flamboyant mastery of film technique, brilliantly contrasts vibrantly colored but chaotic scenes of African poverty with gray, chilly, oh-so-discreet visions of the halls of power in London and Berlin. The story unfolds in jigsaw fashion, as Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), a decent, emotionally reticent English diplomat, investigates the mysterious death of his passionate activist wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz). We react with the same sickened horror as Quayle as he uncovers evidence of pharmaceutical companies committing wholesale slaughter on impoverished Africans, aided and abetted by governmnent colleagues he'd thought of as friends. Fiennes and Weisz (whose story is told in flashbacks) give Oscar-worthy performances, and there are also superb supporting performances by Bill Nighy, Pete Postlethwaite, Danny Huston and Hubert Kounde.

The story: a mild-mannered British diplomat meets a fiery, passionate woman. They quickly fall in love, and marry, and then get posted to Africa. She's a crusader, and dies on her crusade, and he sets out in quest, to unravel the mysteries of her murder and her crusade.

Both Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz turn in fine performances. RW easily turns in the best performance of her career--very touching, especially with that smile and laugh--and I could see a nomination or two coming her way.

The plot is tight and believable. I won't spoil the story, but let's just say I found it disturbing mostly because I found it all too plausible.

2453465,4,B000C65Z20,"As evidenced by ""City of God"" and now with this feature, Brazilian filmmaker Fernando Meirelles may make the most visually arresting movies today and is certainly not afraid to take on seemingly untouchable subjects that are infused with life and death. This time he transposes the plot from his native Brazil to Africa where he captures the kinetic vibrancy of that world with equal lan. Similar to his previous film though, where I still feel he is lacking somewhat is developing a core heart around his characters that makes us care about their fates. This gap seems more pronounced this time since the plot is essentially a love story as much as a political thriller.

The story focuses on Justin Quayle, a reserved, mid-level British diplomat based in Kenya, and Tessa Abbott, the politically obsessed woman who complicates his life immeasurably but of course, excites him to no end. The development of their romantic relationship is given short shrift for the sake of the movie's time-bouncing structure, but this is not due to the lead actors who are quite compelling. Ralph Fiennes captures the exterior cool and interior fire of Quayle that motivates his intense politicization toward his wife's causes, the primary one being the purported abuses by multinational pharmaceutical companies testing radical experimental drug on unsuspecting Africans who are willing to receive free treatments. Looking and acting uncannily like Kate Winslet, Rachel Weisz has less screen time as Tessa, though she makes her moments count as her character has to remain somewhat of a cipher to move the thriller aspects along effectively. The relationship between Justin and Tessa is unsurprisingly volatile, but Meirelles leaves the actors alone to convey whatever romanticism may be underneath.

As is true with most John Le Carr stories, this one contains several characters who do not seem to be what the appear - Tessa's colleague Arnold Bluhm may or may not be having an affair with her; Quayle's boss Bernard Pellegrin may be in cahoots with the drug companies; and Quayle's best friend Sandy Woodrow may turn out to be a backstabber worthy of Shakespeare's Iago. Bill Nighy - most familiar to me as the comically aging rock star in ""Love Actually"" - certainly does an effective about-face as the malevolent Pellegrin, and Danny Huston (John's youngest son) does an adroit job in portraying a man who has been robbed of his conscience. A grizzled Pete Postlethwaite shows up late in the movie as a doctor who explains some of the loose plot threads and conveniently summarizes the situation with the Africans. Changing locations with dexterity from London to Berlin to Nairobi to remotest Kenya, Meirelles propels the storyline with fury and unique style aided immeasurably by Csar Charlone's vibrant cinematography and Alberto Iglesias' original, authentic-sounding music score.",1128384000,,2875,5.193965517241379

His performance is his best in quite some time and Rachel Weisz is just amazing, giving a performance that not only proves her to be the most versatile and talented actresses working today but almost locks her up for a Oscar nomination with one of the best performances of the year if not the best.

2453467,3,B000C65Z20,"""The Constant Gardener"" is a polished work absent the rage its subject deserves. Noble. Liberal. Emotionally punchless. The ingredients are there. John LeCarre novel. The continued abuse of impoverished Africans. Government corruption. Corporate greed. The death of a beautiful activist. And yet the movie poses as little more than an Amnesty International ad.

Part of it has to do the marriage of the two main characters. Ralph Fiennes plays British diplomat Justin Quayle, stationed in Kenya with much younger wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) a firebrand working for whatever cause she can find that helps the poor in Nairobi. She ruffles the corresponding feathers of whichever organization is giving aid on the cheap or, worse, testing other drugs on AIDS patients. Tessa's research points toward fatal side effects of a certain experimental TB drug.

Justin doesn't know any of this, because he and Tessa have an agreement: She won't tell him. So when Tessa is killed at a remote lake, Justin mourns and discovers her at the same time. The Le Carre novel may better explain theunderstanding Justin and Tessa share, but in the movie it's one-sided even after Tessa's death: A lot of people make a lot of excuses about a woman who essentially drove into her own death while playing some ""you know our deal"" lip service to her husband. I don't care if it's unlikely. It's a little inane.

So while the movie doubles back and shows us the hearts of these two characters, it expects us to care more about a byzantine conspiracy to inocculate millions by killing a couple hundred. The villains being the diffident Danny Huston and Bill Nighy as pitable, slightly dingy diplomats, the edge is lost. Yes, the world absolutely suffers out of bemused ignorance and neglect.  But ""The Constant Gardener"" executes fairly empty

justice in its second half, as Justin becomes as comfortable with his demise as his wife apparently was.

It's directed by Fernando Meirelles, whose last film ""City of God,"" about the slums of Rio De Janeiro, was cinematic lightning, a vicious, brilliant, candy-colored epic that deserve mention beside the great gangster pictures of any era. Here he employs a curious ethnographic technique: There are tons of random shots of Life in Africa. Weisz plays with kids. People wave at the camera. This a strange grab at prestige, bolstering the movie's case by showing ""the real thing."" Okay at first, eventually annoying. Meirelles doesn't take any of the chances he did in ""City of God""; the scenery is dramatic, but Meirelles relies too much on its beauty. Better films give context to the visuals through camera position and movement. Meirelles is proficient but functional from credit to credit.

""The Constant Gardener"" is the same as a whole. Fiennes is in the upper crust of actors, but he's traveled this road in ""The English Patient"" and ""The End of the Affair."" He's empty of charisma here. Weisz is a beautiful woman and the movie's only pulse, but she's hampered by a lack of screen time and her role, to some extent, as a near saint.",1128211200,,3058,4.937743190661479

2453469,5,B000C65Z20,"""The Constant Gardener"" was my 3rd choice (out of 3) of movies I wanted to see this weekend. What a pleasant surprise to find it so charming and realistic!

Simply told, Justin Quayle, a soft-spoken a British diplomat and his politically radical wife, Tessa, are living in Kenya. Quite quickly, Tessa and a black companion are found dead near a remote lake. Hints of an adulterous relationship between the two are floated, but soon fall apart. The movie deals with Justin trying to understand the circumstances of his wife's death, which revolve around her off-hours activities which she kept private.

The plot eventually involves foreign drug cartels, political favoritism, local corruption, AIDS, international aid organizations and greed. Ground up between these competing forces are the destitute of Africa, trying to survive in the midst of poverty and disease.

Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Wiesz bring ample humanity and believable depth to the Quayles, portraying their tenderness and devotion to one another. The rest of the cast and the writers make this one of the most intelligent movies of many a year. The cinematography of Kenya is stunning. Much of the film's personal scenes were shot by handheld cameras. At critical moments, though, shooting switched to an impressionistic flurry of shots and angles. The shanty-town misery of the Kenyan people was shown unsparingly but with sensitivity and compassion. The sound track, much of which is inspired by African music is achingly beautiful. Throughout, the film holds up the beauty, grace, dignity and long-suffering of the African people. They are not shown as faceless victims of white man's greed, but of noble human people caught up in forces larger than themselves.

2453470,5,B000C65Z20,"Adapted from John Le Carr?'s novel, Fernando Meirelles' The Constant Gardener benefits greatly from Ralph Fiennes' presence as a diplomat whose young wife, an activist interested in humanitarian causes in Africa, is brutally murdered. Investigating her death he discovers that she was involved in a corruption scandal involving a drug with potentially fatal side effects, its powerful manufacturer, and two governments.

All the familiar targets of paranoid conspiracy thrillers are here and the complex plot is presented with surprising clarity by a literate script. Fiennes and Rachel Weisz as his wife lift The Constant Gardener above the level of the average spy movie through their luminous performances. The former's resolute attempt to keep his composure at the moment he is informed of her murder is just one highlight among many. Ultimately what makes this film memorable is that it is not just about murder, betrayal, greed and corruption at the highest levels of government, but about two real people, who love each other but don't know a great deal about their individual lives.

While the documentary-style camerawork lends the film a sense of gritty verisimilitude that increases its power, and the African scenes are especially vivid, the viewer must be warned that the cumulative effect of so much shaky hand-held camerawork gave this moviegoer a headache and queasy stomach.

He was not really there for his wife and he just shut himself out of the world untill tragedy strikes and he has to not only defend his late wife's honor but also be aware of the horrors that are in the world he lives in. Fiennes carries this role to perfection and he's just as good as Weisz in his role as well.

2453490,3,B000C65Z20,"""The Constant Gardener"" is a ""supense-thriller"" where the main plot involves a British diplomat named Justin Quayle, played by Ralph Fiennes, seeking out who is to blame for the murder of his liberal activist wife, Tessa, played by Rachel Weisz

First I am going to focus on what is good about ""The Constant Gardener."" For starters, the director is Fernando Meirelles who made the outstanding ""City of God,"" a much superior film about life in a crime stricken neighborhood in Brazil. While I much prefer this earlier film, Merielles still manages to present an authentic portrait of life in Africa with its stunning beauty -both human and natural. But he shows it to be also a land haunted by disease, poverty and corruption. The movie bravely tackles the weighty political topic of corporate greed and maliciousness, in this case a multinational pharmaceutical giant named KDT. The bottom line is that life is cheap in plague ridden Africa, especially when death is being bought by a big money corporation with millions in profits at stake.

Unfortunately, this movie fails in other areas. I especially found the relationship between Justin and Tessa to be poorly developed. They enjoy a quick sex romp after meeting at one of Justin's lectures in England. Shortly thereafter, she manages to tag along with him back to Africa where he serves his diplomatic post in Kenya. They are married, apparently in quick order, though the movie never really depicts their courtship. Instead the movie opens up the question of whether Tessa is an unfaithful wife only using Justin because of his access to power. Meanwhile, his love for her is never fully explained, beyond his own loneliness and lust. Hardly the foundation for a devoted, caring relationship.

After her murder, Justin goes on a desperate and dangerous rampage to track down who killed her. In this respect, the ""suspense-thriller"" aspect of the movie is lacking, as it is clear she was killed for her political actions and the culprit turns out to be the most obvious suspect. Not enough ""twists and turns"" for a movie counting on mystery to provide the desired dramatic effect. Also since the basis for Justin's ""love"" for Tessa is founded on questionable grounds it just doesn't ring true to life when he turns from a passive British diplomat into a sort of heroic warrior willing to take drastic actions and make ultimate sacrifices to discover ""The Truth"". It would help if Tessa was a more likable character. Instead she is a rich, young idealist who is on a mission to ""save"" Africa without regard to who she has to lie to, steal from or manipulate along the way. She is shown to be reckless and self-righteous rather than thoughtful and consistent in her actions. At one pont, she even admits to Justin that she is an activist because it is what gives her life a sense of purpose and without it she is a ""nobody"". Certainly honest on her part. But it doesn't help to emotionally endear her to the audience.

""The Constant Gardener"" is a decent movie, in some aspects. But I find it highly suspect that so many critics have jumped on its bandwagon as being ""Oscar worthy"" and of the highest caliber. I think this is probably because so much mindless junk comes out of Hollywood that when a movie that is serious and with good intentions finally shows up the critics are willing to fall all over themselves to exaggerate its praise. Meanwhile, countless smaller, but better, indie films come out that are hardly given notice. Personally, I much preferred the charming and inspiring documentary, ""Mad, Hot Ballroom,"" about Latino kids from inner city New York schools learning how to ballroom dance. Also highly recommended is the overlooked ""Saving Face, a funny and intelligent movie about a young Chinese-American woman coming to terms with her lesbianism.

Rachel Weisz has not only raised the bar in acting prowess this year but I don't think I will see another performance like it. If she is not nominated for an Oscar, then there is something wrong. Ralph Fiennes also shines with his role that is a complex look into a man who has to find out not only who his wife was but also to see who he really is.

Fiennes once again proves to be a master of quiet mannerisms with his heartbreaking and intelligent performance as Justin Qualye, a shy British diplomat who must uncover the reasons for his wife's murder and uncover a government cover up of illegal testing of the poor and destitute of an African village who are being used as guinea pigs to test out experimental drugs for a pharmaceutical company. Rachel Weisz plays Tessa, Justin's late wife who was investigating the corruption when she mysteriously died. Weisz gives a supercharge performance that is full of bravado, guts, and humanity and Justin's flashbacks of her makes you not only respect and admire her for her bravery but makes you grieve for her as well because of the beautiful person she really was.

The directing of Fernando Meirelles gives this thriller the spark it needs to fully in habit the world where Justin and Tessa lived and makes you just as weary as they both were because of the lies and corruption that darken this other wise beautiful landscape with human blood.

2453495,3,B000C65Z20,"I didn't dislike ""The Constant Gardener"", but given it's critical buzz, it didn't live up to my expectations. In it, a British conservative bureaucrat marries a liberal activist who becomes involved in uncovering a pharmaceutical corporation conspiracy. She tries to prove impoverished Africans are being used to test new dangerous pharmaceuticals.

Director Fernando Meirelles (City Of God), films a glorious, remote and colorful country focussing on the poor, highlighted by aerial panoramas of red-baked seaside cliffs, green roving, grassy plains, and raw images of ingenious peoples and locales. The cinematography overwhelms the topical but standard suspense-thriller story, becoming nearly condescending in it's constant touting of the real poor in Africa. The enormity and plight of starving diseased Africans stands like a giant next to the fictitious, and often thin, characterizations of the two lead characters.

I couldn't buy the character of Tessa, as a humanitarian activist. Her character is flighty, a bleeding heart if you will, without roots to empathetic response to human suffering. She is more like a Peace Corp volunteer than a genuine activist. The emotional intention of the film may be to depict her as sweet and naive, but her superficial probing and brow bending suspicions, blunted a sharp edge the film may have possessed, had her character been more secure in responding to abusive global corporations.

Despite these reservations, the second half of ""The Constant Gardener"", improves over the first considerably, as the 'suspense-thriller' dynamics are set into gear, and the chase, so to speak, is on. Before then, the constant merry-go-round romantics of the starry-eyed lead characters become superfluous and annoying. He loved, loved, loved her, with all his heart, heart, heart. We get, get, get it.

As in his ""City Of God"", concerning the slums of Brazil, director Meirelles photographs a stunning human vista of a suffering and splendorous Africa. The conspiracy thriller aspect of it, is often only secondary.",1127088000,,2051,5.481012658227848
2453496,4,B000C65Z20,"Ralph Fiennes stars as Justin Quayle in ""The Constant Gardener,"" a film based on the novel of the same name by John Le Carr&eacute;.  Fiennes is a diplomat with the British High Commission who meets Tessa, played by Rachel Weisz, when she publicly rails against a speech he has just delivered. Justin and Tessa have completely opposite temperaments. He is undemonstrative and introspective; she is passionate and outspoken.  Still, they fall in love and end up traveling to Kenya as man and wife.

In Kenya, Rachel spends a great deal of time with a man whom she grows to admire greatly, a black doctor named Arnold Bluhm.  Much to their horror, Rachel and Arnold uncover a conspiracy that endangers the African people for whom they care so much.  Heedless of their personal safety, the two crusaders plan to reveal what they have discovered.  Before they get their chance, they are brutally murdered and a false cover story is circulated to explain the crime.  Justin Quayle has a choice to make.  Should he go back to his quiet existence in England and try to move on with his life?  Or should he conduct his own investigation into Tessa's death?

Ralph Fiennes is an exceptionally expressive actor whose face reveals, during different scenes in the film, hurt, jealousy, grief, and rage.  Rachel Weisz's Tessa is a beautiful and sensitive woman who wears her heart on her sleeve.  She never holds back when she sees injustice, and she refuses to puts her personal safety ahead of her concern for others.  In smaller roles, Hubert Kound&eacute; exudes warmth as the compassionate Dr. Arnold Bluhm, Danny Huston is effectively slimy as two-faced Sandy Woodrow, a colleague of Justin's with his own agenda, and Bill Nighy is a chilling Sir Bernard Pellegrin, a man whom it is most unwise to cross.

Credit goes to the director, Fernando Meirelles, and the cinematographer, C&eacute;sar Charlone, for the sweeping shots of Africa, with screeching flocks of birds wheeling towards an endless sky.  The scenes featuring hundreds of Kenyans, with their colorful garb, melodious voices, beautiful smiles, and heartbreaking suffering, are intensely moving.  Alberto Iglesias's haunting background score is by turns dramatic and poignant, and it adds immeasurably to film's atmosphere.

I did have some problems with ""The Constant Gardener.""  Much of the dialogue is mumbled and difficult to make out, some of the scenes are choppily cut, the hand-held camera work is headache inducing, and the villains are a bit too one-dimensional.  Even with these flaws, however, the film is extremely effective, and it leaves the viewer with deep feelings of revulsion towards the many venal individuals who routinely exploit vulnerable human beings for personal gain.  The transformation of Ralph Fiennes from a proper and well-mannered man who never makes waves to a firebrand who is anxious to ""finish what [his wife] started"" is in itself worth the price of admission.",1127001600,,2954,5.089211618257261

When his activist wife (Tessa) is found murdered, he detects and investigates a coverup by his government and a large pharmaceutical company which is flogging drugs to Africans. ""The Constant Gardener"" has a powerful message of capitalist brutality, governmental complicity, and the grinding poverty, violence, and corruption of Africa. I applaud the author for not taking the cheap shot and making an American pharmaceutical company the villain. For the first time -- probably ever -- the villain of a major motion movie is Canadian!  And Swiss too.  A Swiss-Canadian pharmaceutical company. Refreshingly original bad guys.

The reason I don't give the film the top rating is the heroine.  I found Tessa unsympathetic and her do-gooder morals questionable. This is a woman who lies, cheats, and steals to accomplish her aims. Well -- say you -- it was for a higher good: to save African lives. BS say I.  Is her character any better than the liers, cheaters, and thieves she strives with single-minded devotion to expose? . If her opponents are scary, so is Tessa -- but I don't think that is what the film maker intended. Those who live in glass houses...

Perhaps the film would have been more compelling had it focused on Africans rather than a foreign idealist.  See ""Hotel Rwanda.""

""The Constant Gardener"" is superbly filmed and well-acted and the images of Africa and Africans are powerful. The portrayals of British diplomats by Danny Huston and Bill Nighy are deserving of Oscars, as perhaps is the photography.

2453498,5,B000C65Z20,"This is perhaps the best movie of the year, yeah I know people have said with other lesser films but ""The Constant Gardener"" is the real deal. It punches you in the gut, presents realistic situations, questions our status in the world today and how much good or bad (War in Iraq, Aids in Africa, gluttony of the US and Brits flip/flop of support for the US) we're doing. This is definitely another movie that like ""March of the Penguins"" , ""Roots"", ""Hotel Rwanda"", ""Roger and Me"" that needs to be released to the masses and watched by many people to educate.

Well who better to direct such a power film that the man himself Fernando Meirelles (from Brazil Amigos!!!!) this is the same great director who brought us the astonishing ""City of God."", this man really needs more attention. I guess being from South America , the media neglects to put guys like this in the spotlight since he ain't American but come-on, he rules!!!

It's billed as a thriller on IMDb but really it's more than that film fans, it's a political thriller/drama/ love story/ social commentary all rolled up into one beautifully written and poignant story.

At it's core it's about what you believe to be right and fighting the good fight for a cause. Really that's in a nutshell. Some of us claim to want to do that, but others do it without procrastinating.

This helps introduce the two protagonists, Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) and Tessa Quayle (Rachel Weisz) . My God, they are so good in this movie, and to think Rachel has beauty to go with her skill as well!!! Fiennes once again silences those snobby critics who still doubt he can deliver a good lead well he does and then some.

Plotwise. the story concerns a journalist Tessa Quayle, involving herself into a corrupt medical company in Kenya with a terrible secret. More than that though Tessa, is a humanitarian who sees the suffering in Africa and wants to help the people. Eventually she learns of misdoings by the company there, and when she is about to break the story, she is murdered. Justin (Fiennes) is the conservative in the family, though he and Tessa disagreed on some topics, they love each other. Justin takes news of her death as bad you can imagine. Instead though of using his time to grief and feel sorry for himself, he uses his time to find out the truth, why did his loving wife find and why was she murdered? And more importantly is he next?

Thus the mystery begins, Fiennes is on here from start to finish, really he's such a good actor, you can't look away a sec from him or Rachel. They dominate here, expanding their characters from simple people with simple goals in mind, to individuals whose emotions go in different directions.

A bigger issue then that Constant Gardener address besides the poor dying people of Africa (a country decimated by Aids) is the issue of greed by the pharmaceutical drug companies and how they use their status as caring and loving to exploit poor people and desperate people for unproven studies with disastrous results. Of course the question that comes up is does this really happen? And the answer is yes, companies like Merck., PFizer have all been embroiled in drug scandals with dangerous drugs exposed by the FDA and news companies like 20/20 and 60 minutes. Of course the drug companies deny all wrongdoing but we as Americans are not fooled and thus we have this constant (no pun intended) conflict of interest with the drug companies over profit and safety.

The Constant Gardener then is simply one of the best if not the best movie to come out in 2005. It was simply a delight to watch this movie, and moreover write a review about it. I really hope everyone goes to watch this movie, and better yet, people should go in groups to see this film because really it's an important film that everyone should watch.",1126915200,,3821,4.625368731563422

Before the movie started I keep thinking, I hope I didn't waste

my money again on a bad film. I was pleasantly surprised at the great acting and the interesting plot of this film, even though

the plot is heartwrenching.  This film uses many flashbacks,

which I usually detest, but I think the flashbacks enhanced it.

I read most of the reviews here, and there are legitimate

critques by the reviewers regarding plot, camera work, preachiness, etc. but I enjoyed it anyway.  It's far better than the usual crap Hollywood is making these days.",1126828800,,749,4.707692307692308
2453500,5,B000C65Z20,"Justin Quale (Fiennes) is a mild-mannered British diplomat in the African country of Kenya.  His wife Tessa (Weisz), is an activist that is pushing peoples buttons.  When she turns up dead from an apparent accident, Justin suspects a cover-up.  And there are many questions surrounding Tessa's life that he has.

Justin is determined though, and soon finds himself involved in a mystery that will change his life.

""The Constant Gardener"" is a slow moving but highly engaging film.  The story is interesting and timely, and provides an insight in to modern day Africa and its politics.  Both Fiennes and Weisz are more than capable in the lead roles, and make the Quales real human beings.  The biggest drawback of the film is the hand-held camera shots that are very distracting from the story.  They almost make you feel more detatched from the story.  That is a shame in a movie that wants you to feel Justin's pain and confusion over the death of his wife.  Fortunately, that is one small aspect of an otherwise excellent movie.",1126742400,,1219,4.770334928229665
2453501,4,B000C65Z20,"There have been nifty thrillers over the years with conspiracy attached, and many of them have been good like The Parallax View and JFK.  Yet few of these have been able to rise above the visceral angst of suspense and intrigue to attain another level of human emotion.  One good example is the recent adaptation of John Le Carre's novel, The Constant Gardener.  Adapted by Jeffrey Caine and directed by Fernando Meirelles, this is a superior cinematic rendition of a good, moral suspense yarn told with methodical precision and emotional resonance.

Tessa (Rachel Weisz) is a volunteer-activist who marries timid diplomat, Justin Qualye (Ralph Fiennes) and follows him to Kenya in Africa.  When his wife goes missing, Justin decides to follow his wife's trail and find out what really happened and why.  The clues lead to a pharmaceutical drug corporation that is testing tuberculosis drugs on the lower class population.  What Justin finds is a shocking conspiracy of secrets and lies reaching up to the British government and a corporate entity that will stop at nothing to release its money making windfall.  As Justin discovers the truth, he begins to understand the ruthless nature of conspirators even as he begins to uncover the truth about his marriage.

This is a chilling mystery story that is at its heart a tale of romantic love between a man and a wife he really doesn't know.  Although not perfect, it does endeavor to be many things, and it integrates the love story that forms the soul of the film with an elaborate detective story that touches upon morality, fear, hope, and redemption and achieves them quite well.  It's like reading a long, complex novel. That a film could be filled with so many attributes is quite an achievement and a  testament to the source material by Le Carre, a constant source of complex, filmic material ever since the breakout adaptation of his The Spy Who Came in From the Cold in the 1960's.  It is also a tribute to director Meirelles who has a sure hand in every scene and edit while never losing track of his many themes and maintaining strong performances from his talented cast.

At first Justin is oblivious to the insidious forces around him.  The garden that he tends to is a metaphor of sorts to a basic, uncomplicated view of his world that is suddenly shaken. The backgrounds in many scenes show a rural countryside with poor people struggling to survive.  Life is hard for the people in a harsh landscape.  There are always incidental shots of children usually in the background as casual bystanders or observers; they are the innocent ones. This story and its people are distant cousins of the drug gangs in Meirelles' previous, breakthrough film, City of God.  It is in this setting that Justin retraces Tessa's footsteps which lead to a dirty secret and a rediscovery of their love.  Throughout it all, there is an almost inevitable, hopeless feeling, like a stacked deck against Justin.  Then there is the question of trust.  Who to trust?  It seems everyone is either partly involved with the bad guys or reluctant to get involved.  There are different levels of trust.  There is the hint of marital infidelity and the questioning of loyalty.  In this respect, The Constant Gardener reminds one of the underrated Under Fire.

The narrative fluidly flashes back and forth at will to show the beginnings of Justin and Tessa's relationship amid the intrigue in Kenya.  There's also lots of handheld camera work (Cesar Charlone) that gives the film a semi documentary feel.  While the look is raw and primitive, the editing (by Oliver Stone alumni Claire Simpson) is sophisticated and clever as various bits of associative imagery are connected to great emotional and informative effect.  A great deal of thought and planning went into this story and its adaptation to connect the dots.

Fiennes is excellent as the beleaguered husband who seeks the truth about his wife.  He has a knack for playing tragic characters (Quiz Show, The English Patient), and he has never been better than in this role.  You feel his confusion and pain as he goes against difficult odds.  Rachel Weisz is terrific as the brave crusader of the African people who risks harm and her marriage by digging for the truth.  You feel her passion in Tessa's character and the free spirit that dominates every scene she is in. You just know that Tessa's own hard-headed agenda will get her in trouble.  It is a far cry from Weisz's days in action blockbusters like The Mummy, and it is her best role to date.  The rest of the uniformly strong cast is excellent particularly Bill Nighy as the slimy Pellegrin.

If you are a conspiracy buff, then this is your kind of film.  Although it is a bit of a downer, ultimately it is a haunting fable with memorable imagery, and it is a film that stays with you long after it is over.  It should stay with Oscar voters for the long term as well.",1126569600,,4918,4.761511216056671
2453502,2,B000C65Z20,"This movie has an good storyline, and excellent acting. I'll leave it to the other reviews to expand on this.

But, honestly, it was ruined by the non-stop shaky, jerky camerawork. It was probably meant to enhance the feeling of tenseness, which I guess it did for 10 minutes or so. But it pretty quickly got old, and by the time we had finished TWO HOURS of this, I had a headache and my wife had actually developed motion sickness to the point of nausea.

I'd also have to say that this camerawork (I can't actually call it cinematography) failed on other levels, too. Even during the parts where I wasn't made physically uncomfortable by it, I was never able to forget that I was watching a movie. Every time the camera swung around or the picture leaned, or whatever, I was pulled out of the story - I was never able to lose myself and get really involved.

All the great acting, interesting storyline, social awareness, etc. in this movie is simply lost in the awful filming.",1126483200,,980,4.49438202247191

Instead the director decided to just run with the clich&eacute;s and ignore the rest. The cinematography was trying too hard to seem artistic using jerky, erratic motion and subdued hues. It could have been very beautiful but was just distracting.

The plot was very clich&eacute;d and simplistic. It totally ignored the other factors in the region like corrupt governments (well, not totally but enough to seem so) and makes the African people seem like victims who need help from the ""white man"" instead of the strong people that they are.

Overall this movie was a just a huge disappointment to me.",1126483200,,754,5.024
2453504,5,B000C65Z20,"The title 'The Constant Gardener' has multiple meanings for this film, but first it refers to the obvious, the character of Justin Quayle, a middle-tier member of the British diplomatic corps in Africa, who is constantly trying to cultivate a proper garden, be it in London or in Africa.  Into his routine civil service existence, Tessa arrives, full of ideas, passion for justice, and more than a few secrets.  Of course, the diplomatic corps powers also have their secrets, and it is in the clash of secrets that Tessa ends up being murdered, and Justin's life turns from one of routine if not wholehearted loyalty to the service into an extraordinary, passionate and heart-felt loyalty to the memory of his wife.

This film is remarkable in several ways, not the least because of the cinematography.  More than half the film is set in Africa, both Kenya and the Sudan.  Here is life in all its contradictions - abject poverty and stunning beauty, illness and disease amidst the overpopulation; life among the dying, and death among the living.  One thing the viewer will notice is that all of the scenes in Africa are shown in vivid, powerful colours.  The scenes in London and on the European continent are faded and gray; despite the fact that the European scenes are invariably set in wealthy settings (private clubs, opulent halls, expensive buildings, etc.), they lack the colour and life of the African scenes - even the Kenyan shanty town and the Sudanese refugee camp seem to contain more life than the major cities of the Western world.  This is surely no accident, but rather a device the director used to intensify the contradictions.

There are several plots that lead into one another - what was Tessa really up to?  Who was involved, and to what degree?  There are a few subplots that fall short, but on the whole, the film hangs together well in a narrative sense.  Tessa's murder is an early event, and much of the film is done in flash-back or memory sequences, until the two come together in time frame and the mystery begins to reach some clarity.

This film is directed by Fernando Meirelles, who was nominated for an Oscar for his first film, the Brazilian 'City of God'.  His is certainly a name to watch.  In this film he directs

Ralph Fiennes ('The English Patient', a film that bears many similarities here) and Rachel Weisz ('The Mummy'), together with a good collection of British and African actors.  The extras casting for Africa was extremely well done, and the nice touches such as the AIDS street-theatre performance in the Kenyan slum were inspired.

The film has  a majestic, broad and sweeping feel to it.  One is treated to a visual banquet of images, colourful deserts and lakes, wildlife and plant life, and the people of the lands of Africa, all truly remarkable.  The music is sometimes subtle and sometimes dramatic - much is inspired by native sounds of Africa.

The film is engrossing and interesting, causing many feelings to grow in the garden of viewing.",1126396800,,3004,4.7810077519379846

Tessa discovered not only are the drugs contributing to patient's deaths but also that high-level U.K. goverment officials are allowing this to go on with full knowlege of the drugs' questionable nature.

2453506,5,B000C65Z20,"Spies. Corporate corruption. Political intrigue. Secret drug testings. Murder, mass and private. It is strange, perhaps, that a film involving all of these elements should be entitled ""The Constant Gardener,"" and even stranger that a film so named would be one of the year's most exceptional. But so it is.

The eponymous protagonist of ""The Constant Gardener,"" Justin Quayle (played with reserved intensity by Ralph Fiennes), is at first glance just that: a mild-mannered, middle-aged minor British diplomat who is, it seems, constantly gardening. His much younger wife Tessa (a luminously fearless Rachel Weisz), who is impassioned and tactless and everything Justin is not, says, not unkindly, that he ""dreams of a world without any weeds."" That this observation is patently true makes Justin's inevitable journey from placid gardener to incensed investigator even more alluring to watch.

But exactly how well Justin Quayle suits the title, and the title its story, is not unfolded all at once, for this is a film of gradual revelations, where the audience is rarely allowed to see more than Justin does. We first see him reluctantly but tenderly seeing his activist wife Tessa off at a remote African airport. The domesticity of the scene is belied by a sense of consternation that is quickly brought to fruition, as the scene fades to reveal a smoldering truck, turned on its side in muddy, blood-red sand under a scorching sun, with a black body-bag being hauled away from it.

This disquieting scene is followed by a series of sharp narrative and mood shifts: first to Justin's quiet, softly-lit office, filled with his omnipresent plants, where he learns of Tessa's death, and then to a much earlier moment in the story, when he first met her. Just as suddenly, we are torn from a brightly-lit, celebratory love scene between them to a dark and gruesome Kenyan morgue, where he must identify her bloodied remains. The contrasts pull one into the story; like the protagonist, we are never quite sure what is coming next.

The film continues to loop back on itself at intervals, telling itself to us through Justin's eyes and memories. Several times the audience is shown things we remember seeing before, but that take on a new meaning because of what we have learned since. Despite the frequently nonlinear pacing of the film, it never drags. Indeed, it plays like a first-rate thriller, with the stakes and complications ever increasing as Justin uncovers more of his wife's politically disastrous discoveries about big pharmaceutical companies and their drug tests in Africa. ""Disposable drugs for disposable people,"" a character remarks at one point. ""We're not killing anyone who isn't going to be dead already.""

There is more than eloquent rhetoric at work through all of this, though; there are violent threats, assassination attempts, and even a car chase through the Sudanese desert. And yet, there are poignant moments too; this is as much the story of a man on a quest to discover the truth about a woman he loved but never understood as it is a race to publish the truth about corporate corruption and greed.

The filmmaking itself is extraordinary; I have seen nothing else like it this
year. Director Fernando Meirelles and his cinematographer Csar Charlone also made ""City of God,"" another complicated, breathtakingly beautiful story with a deeply personal feel and a sense of urgency that are also present in ""The Constant Gardener."" In the scenes between Tessa and Justin, their world is brightly lit, alive and vibrant with color and sound. When he has her no longer, the world becomes unfriendly: grey and gloomy or viciously scorching. Meirelles uses handheld cameras to draw one into the action; it feels intimate, personal, with an almost documentary-like quality to it. One feels immediately as though one is being presented with truth.

Whether or not the plot of ""The Constant Gardener"" is true or not is really
irrelevant, though John le Carr certainly brings conviction to it; rarely
has even he been this obviously indignant over something, and this infuriation is passed on to the audience. And it is not a plot that panders to popular conventions. ""The Constant Gardener"" is a romance, but it is not a romantic story: some ""very nasty things live in gardens,"" particularly this one. The Kenya where Justin and Tessa work is one of sewage-ridden shantytowns and sickness, hope and quiet desperation intermingled. And the ending of the film, though it is true to life and wrenches a gut emotional response from the viewer, is not contrived for a false happy ending. This film knows what many do not, and is not afraid to say so: that the truth is not only something worth dying for, but something that frequently requires it.",1126396800,,4762,4.997477931904162
2453507,5,B000C65Z20,"Based on a novel by John LaCarre, this film sensitively portrays and illuminates the skewed values of a global business and makes a moral and ethical judgement on the modern world. The clues are gradual, the build-up of suspense and espionage is very subtle. The pharmaceutical industry is revealed to care more about making billions of dollars than about the deadly side effects of the drug they are testing. Innocent people who are being treated for other illnesses sign consents under false pretext to test the drug ""voluntarily"". They are victims in many ways: betrayed by several governments, by healthcare workers, and by the pharmaceutical industry, which purports to be saving *their* lives ...

Tessa, the idealistic humanitarian social activist young wife of Justin Quayle, the mild-mannered proper quiet British diplomat to Kenya, suspects and uncovers the unethical testing of a drug designed to irradicate an up-coming Tuberculosis (TB) epidemic, resistant to current drugs on the market. There is a seamless plot which includes complicated underpinnings of wrong-doing by various levels of society both African and British. Jason is unaware of his wife's discoveries until it is too late. As her Majesty's Diplomat to Kenya, he is portrayed as a quiet person, interested in gardening and a bit out of touch with some of the surrounding reality, above it all, although he is highly regarded with impeccable high standards. After his wife's death, he is jolted into action ... examining his wife's private papers and computer he unearths the covert activities in which she was involved. The depth of his loss and the strength of his love for Tessa opens his eyes ... he becomes a fugitive ... seeking the truth and eventually justice.

There is superb cinematography ... a flock of wild geese flying in a V-like formation filmed from up above ... where the viewer sees the landscape below in its vast expanse of beauty. The viewer is given a glimpse into the over-crowded conditions of everyday life in Africa, small homes with corrogated rusting roofs ... as far as the eye can see. Fernando Meirelles, the producer, has superb casting, contrasting the dark beauty and extroverted personality of Rachel Weisz with the understated  striking blond good looks of Ralph Fiennes. The artistic filming techniques are used to maximum effect. The viewing of Tessa's body in the morgue by Justin, along with someone else in the Diplomatic Corps, who happens to have a physical reaction to seeing her charred body becomes symbolic of his responsibility and guilt. The joy of Tessa and Justin at her pregnancy is sensitively presented ... Justin's courage in fleeing the United Kingdom, without a passport, to discover what truths Tessa had uncovered which led to her death -- leads to his final act of love. This film is a classic which will long be remembered for its quiet strength and subtle ability to reveal deeply powerful penetrating truths. All 129 minutes of the film are worth viewing!

There was really no mystery here at all and the outcomes were predictable.

My main beef was the glacial pace of the movie and the frentic camera work that made me want to put my popcorn down and grab some dramamine. At times, I found my eyes fluttering shut, as it was easier to just listen to the dialog rather than watch it.

She is fearless and ballsy but also human and her character's insecurities and faults are all out in the open for the viewer to witness. The story is also top notch with twist and turns at every corner and the ending will leave you speechless.

She's just a raw acting powerhouse in this film and she propels this movie into the stratosphere with her performance. Ralph Fiennes gives a great performance as well and his emotional and solid performance that compliments Weisz in every way.

2453511,5,B000C65Z20,"THE CONSTANT GARDNER is not a film for the inattentive viewer, or for the audience member that thinks of ""thrillers"" as involving car-crashes, lots of ""action"" and perhaps crazy psycho-killers.  (Not that there's anything wrong with those kinds of movies!)  It's an understated, super-tense, very British mystery.  It smolders and seethes.  It doesn't raise its voice.

The story, in a brief nutshell, involves the relationship / marriage between Justin (Ralph Fiennes), a mid-level British diplomat, who keeps his emotions well in check and enjoys gardening) and Tessa (Rachel Wiesz) a hot-headed rich-girl with aspirations to change the world...by any means necessary.  They end up in an African nation, where Tessa seems to be working closely with an African doctor to bring treatment to the poorest of the poor.  She rubs diplomats the wrong way with her ""in-your-face"" attitude, and she may be a very unfaithful wife as well.

It's not spoiling anything to say that the film more or less begins with her brutal murder.  After this, the film bounces back to show us how we got to this point, and then leaps forward to show us what happens after.

This is an angry movie.  It postulates as fact some pretty cynical and nasty conspiracies about the cozy relationship between drug-companies and the British government, all at the terribly high death-toll of the Africans.  It rants a bit too obviously about Britain's involvement in Iraq.  But on the other hand, we all know that SOMETHING is terribly wrong in Africa and that for some reason AIDS is out of control, poverty never gets any better, despite billions in international assistance and that many of the governments are brutal dictatorships.  So the movie also rightly makes us look at the plight of these poor people, even if the exact reason for it is speculative.

But at the heart of the film is the mystery of Tessa.  What was she doing?  Who was she in love with?  Who may have betrayed her?  Was she paranoid, or was she really on to something?  Justin, who deeply loved Tessa, pulls himself out of his protective shell, and goes on essentially a one-man crusade to find the truth...despite the obvious risk to his own life.

I won't say more than this, because so many twists and turns happen in the film.  It's packed with ""plot developments,"" but one of its great achievements is that they are easy to follow.  The plot, even with shifts in time, is pretty easy to follow...yet we never feel led by the nose.  We discover as Ralph Fiennes discovers.  The movie never talks down to the audience.  You must pay attention to keep up, but you also don't feel strained.  This isn't MEMENTO.  It's an adult thriller.

It feels like its been awhile since Ralph Fiennes has done anything.  I checked and was reminded that he DOES keep busy...but just lately, the projects have been quite out of the mainstream.  It's great to see him.  He does his smoldering, implosive ""bit"" again, but he always keeps it real and grounded, and we can always see the decent man underneath.  He's a sympathetic character, even when his passiveness is frustrating.  We always see quite easily how much he loves Tessa.  It's this love that is all he needs to feel happy and content.

A failing of the movie is that we're asked to believe that despite his clear love for Tessa, he doesn't really know what she's up to.  He ""gives her the space she needs"" (my invented quote...not a line from the film, thank God!) but it's kinda hard to buy that he would love her so much (and she loves him?) and yet be so out of touch with what's most important to her.  The film does offer some motivation for this, but upon reflection after seeing the film, it rang a little false.  It's far from a fatal flaw, but it did distract.

Everyone in the film is very good.  Rachel Wiesz finally gets a high-profile role in a film that isn't silly (THE MUMMY, CONSTANTINE).  I think she has great potential, and this film began to tap it.  Bill Nighy has a small but critical role...he is just absolutely one of the most terrific British actors around right now...he steals everything he's in (LOVE, ACTUALLY, SHAUN OF THE DEAD, HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE... and the fantastic lead in STILL CRAZY.)  There are a lot of other great British character actors (and I'll admit I don't know their names), plus the always over the top but fun to watch Pete Postlewaite.

But it's Ralph Fiennes' film.  I predict another Oscar-nomination for him.  (Can't wait to see him as Lord Voldemort).  I recommend the movie highly.  Certainly one of the classiest movies of the year.

(In response to some other criticisms I have seen here...this movie does have a heart.  But as with all things in British diplomatic circles...it is kept discretely hidden.  Mustn't be improper.  I agree that the movie somewhat holds the viewer at a distance emotionally for much of the film.  But as Fiennes situation grows more desparate, he begins to loosen up and let us see what he's feeling.  The ""arms-length"" that we're held at slowly begins to bend and pull us closer.  By the final, lonely scene, I was very much held in an emotional grip.  The film had become quite personal...all the political undercurrents were set aside, and it was film about a man and a woman afterall.)",1126224000,,5269,4.709748083242059
2453512,4,B000C65Z20,"In the Constant Gardener, we see a theme that is depicted in the most dramatic of ways, with violent death. The theme is the giving of oneself to a cause that is bigger than any of us, despite the cost.

A recently married couple seems blissfully embedded in a life of love and promise. That all fades, and quite rapidly, when the wife if murdered en route to discovering a grand scheme bent on the murder of Africans in order to benefit pharmiseutical research. The husband, a British diplomat, who has had a hard time understanding his wife's compassion in his usually bottom-line world, sets it upon himself to find the basis for his wife's research, and, in turn, discover her depth of humanity as well.

Early in the film, the diplomat's wife, upon seeing a family walking miles to their destination, says to her husband, ""Stop, let's give them a ride."" He tells her, ""There's thousands of people who need help out there. We can't help them all."" To which she responds, ""Yes, but these are A FEW we can help.""

As we continue to watch the progression of the protagonist, played superbly by Ralph Fiennes, from a luke-warm spectator of the human condition to an actual member within it, going so far as to adopt the same quote as his aforementioned wife in a critical point in the film, we begin to feel ourselves gathering an empathy for that same philosophy. This is never more true than the closing segments of the film, when we watch the great lengths that our once-unaffected gardener takes to ensure his belief, and doing so with the utmost tranquility.

Action. Mystery. A change in outlook on each of our characters. And finally, a sense of peace that we might have never understood without the progression on the gardener's own journey, because with this peace comes the collection of the ultimate price.",1126224000,,1817,4.686520376175548

Fernando Meirelles creates probably the best political thriller in the last ten years with Top notch performances by Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes that make the viewer not only be captivate by their characters and their tender love story but be outrage by the horrors and the corruption that surround them both. The Constant Gardner is a potboiler of suspends, intrigue and gritty drama rolled into a political thriller that is terrifyingly real. Weisz gives the performance of the year with a character that has so many sides to her that you really don't know what to expect Intl the climax of the film and Ralph Fiennes is mesmerizing as a man driven by grief and lust and a desire to find out the truth about the woman he loved and the people he thought he knew. This is smart filmmaking and Fernando Meirelles does the story and its actors justice with a gritty and beautiful portrayal of the African landscape that exposes its beauty and horrors all at once.

2453514,5,B000C65Z20,"You know, it funny to read some of these reviews from people who don't like this film for reasons being either that it's too political to the very stupid reason that only film students will like it. The reason a lot of people like this film and are showering it with praise is the fact that it's the first film of the year that treats it's audience like adults and its story is pacifically written for thinking people who will appreciate it's intelligence other than to be treated like an idiot. Rachel Weisz gives a groundbreaking performance that is in my mind the best performance of the year with a character that is probably the most complex character in modern cinema. Her performance is a veil of secrecy, bravado, strong will and humanity. Her character would have been one note in any other actress's hands but Weisz gives a real human touch to the character that is refreshing and real and it drives the story in this disturbing journey. Ralph Fiennes further establishes himself as the most underrate actor of his generation with a quiet and somber performance that packs a lot of emotional punch. He journey of truth and self discovery is heartbreaking and liberating and it will give you such an emotional jolt. Fernando Meirelles does a great job in not only furthering the emotional landscape of the characters but giving the landscape of Kannia a real chance to shine as well. Making it just as much a character as the rest.

Hey, if you want to have a great time with a movie that will make you feel and think about what you just saw, be my guess. If you have personal hang ups over your stupid politics or the fact that you would rather be treated like an idiot for two strait hours, do us all a favor and skip this movie. It's probably will go over your head.

2453515,2,B000C65Z20,"I think in this day and age we sometimes go to the movies with this clandestine idea that some movies are good for us.  Especially foreign films.  If Alec Guiness proved anything by playing Obi-Wan Kenobi, a British accent can make any amount of bad dialog, and half hearted plot points sound like their Shakespeare. Monty Python made a career of making  fart jokes seem ivy league.  As an American I've always found British cultural to be a bit high brow.  Fernando Meirelles new film THE CONSTANT GARDENER is a highbrow film that pretends to be good for you, but in the end is all together cheesy.

Ralph Fiennes plays Justin Quayle a British diplomat who falls for Tessa (Rachel Weisz) a young student who becomes his wife.  When she is found dead on the side of the road brutally murdered Justin uncovers a mystery that challenges his friendships, and threatens his life.  What was Tessa involved in?  Was she having an affair with a young doctor?  Who's involved in her murder?  Was it an accident?  All these questions will be answered.  But I didn't buy the story at all.  So no amount of platitudes for the direction and acting could ever let me recommend it.

Because the film is half baked.  It's got brilliant performances, tight and interesting direction and editing,  it's timely, and it has a polish and sheen of an Oscar caliber film.  But I kept asking myself why?  Why go through the trouble of crafting such an intricate mystery, only to bungle it with a half hearted and empty ending.  The film does a great job of showing some of the horrors that are going on in Africa and then ends on this note of preachy self-righteousness.

I could rave about the performances for a whole page.  Fiennes and Weisz are fantastic.  Their chemistry works so well, almost too well.  Weisz is now becoming one of my most favorite actresses because she picks parts that have a lot of meat on them.  She could probably do a bunch of romantic comedies and be the British answer to Julia Roberts but hopefully she will chose not too.  Because there is an Academy Award waiting out there for her if she could just get the right part.

As for Fiennes he always great.  I wanted to watch him in this film. Had THE CONSTANT GARDENER  been a movie more about the relationship and romance between Justin and Tessa I would have embraced it.  I would have praised the film because this is the only thing the film gets right.  But alas, the story gets in the way, and we're bogged down with content that supposed timely and important.  We get a mystery that depends on so many people,  the film has so many small characters we have to try and keep track of, and the conspiracy that is involved in the film is so convoluted and in the end it so mundane.  That you're left wonder just what was the point?  I left the theater saying to myself ""Who cares?""  If I wanted to be preached at about the horrors of corporations and how they're killing the third world, I'd go to a DNC Meeting or turn on Air America.

A film can be timely.  A film can build a mystery.  A film can even attempt to showcase the horror in the world around us.  In the case of THE CONSTANT GARDNER a focus on human passion and heart was sorely missed.  Many people will like this film, they will praise it for what they perceive to be there.  But at the end of the day this is a film with powerful performances but no real heart.",1126137600,,3389,4.408723747980614

What we did not have this year was a film that grab you and shock you to the core with its issues. A film that has superb acting and a great visual sense of self.  Well, we finally have one and it's called the Constant Gardner. Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz give the best performances of the year in a story that will disturb you and scare you at the same time with its issues about corruption, evil and the power of love.  Fiennes is great as a man searching for the reasons why his wife was murdered and discovers treachery at every corner and Weisz is amazing as his late spouse who in flash backs tries to fight for the people of a small village who are being victimize by a big pharmacy company who does not care about how it's treating the people as lab rats for it's experimental medicines. The story is a compelling look at one man's fight to find the truth and find his faith again in the person he loved the most in his world and find a way to redeem himself in her eyes. Fernando Meirelles directs this movie in such a flawless manor that it often feels real in some aspects and the characters by Weisz and Fiennes will leave a mark on your heart after the move ends with their grace and their humanity.

2453519,4,B000C65Z20,"Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) finds himself oddly attracted to Tessa (Rachel Weisz, ""Constantine""), the feisty young woman who peppered him with `inconvenient' questions during his lecture. As the hall empties, he approaches her and they begin a torrid affair. Justin's duties as a mid-level ambassador call him to Africa and Tessa asks to come along as his wife. Acclimating to his new surroundings, Justin tends to his gardening as Tessa becomes involved with the local community. Soon, she uncovers a conspiracy that may involve the government and a huge corporation. When she is discovered murdered, Justin begins to make inquiries, and decides to finish what his wife started.

""The Constant Gardener"", based on the bestseller by John Le Carre and directed by Fernando Meirelles (""City of God""), is a very well-made, intriguing, adult thriller. Perfect fare for the Fall Oscar season but the studio apparently felt so strongly in the film, they decided to release it at the end of the competitive summer season. I hope it finds an audience. I also hope it is remembered during awards season.

Meirelles, who directed the great film ""City of God"", about a gang of young men in Brazil's slums trying to survive, seems to be the perfect choice to capture ""Gardeners"" sun-drenched African vistas. The director has a unique visual style, providing interesting detail which doesn't seem obtrusive or distract from the narrative. Exterior scenes are drenched with light, washing out most blues and greens, revealing hot colors like red and orange. On the other hand, interior scenes are predominately blue and gray. This may not seem revolutionary, but the technique used aids the look well. Depending on the amount of light, some scenes are more saturated than others, creating a consistency throughout.

Meirelles also uses other interesting techniques. For instance, in one scene, Quayle is making a long journey by car. The camera is positioned in the passenger seat, looking out over the hood of the car, which fills the screen. As the journey progresses, a street corner approaches, there is a long fade, then another street corner with different people. This visual touch adds a level of interest to a scene which could be rather boring in other hands.

The film is told in a way that expertly mirrors the unsettled state of Quayle's character. Because the film is, more or less, his journey, it seems only fitting that the director would attempt to take the viewer into Quayle's head. The film starts with Tessa's murder and we follow Quayle as he unravels the secrets behind her death. Throughout, we see flashbacks to his life with Tessa, learning more about her. As the story and journey become more consuming, the flashbacks become more surrealistic. Occasionally, he thinks that Tessa is in the room with him. Some people who read this description may think that the film will be difficult to follow, but if anything, this timeline aides in out understanding of everything.

Fiennes is, as always, great. A meek diplomat, he initially seems unsettled by most things, including his new, very forward wife, taking refuge in his hobby, gardening. After they are married, he is disoriented by her energy and tenaciousness. As they move to Africa, he becomes unsettled by his new surroundings, finding refuge in his wife and his hobby. But after her death, as he begins to uncover the secrets she uncovered, he seems to fall more in love with her, appreciate her more, become more like her. This isn't to say that he didn't love her from the beginning; he just didn't understand her as well. As he becomes more embroiled in the conspiracy he changes to become more like her, understanding her more. The performance is extremely subtle, and believable, yet moving and completely natural.

Rachel Weisz is also very good. She has a more difficult role as everything she does is experienced by the viewer in flashback. She has to create an indelible, interesting character from the first moment we see her, or else we don't care about what happens to her. She does this by making us appreciate her; during Quayle's lecture, she begins to pepper him with nasty questions about the government. Most people in the audience titter a little, shocked that the lecture was interrupted, but they soon turn against her. After the lecture, Quayle approaches her and they go on a date. Meirelles uses a series of images to depict their first sexual encounter and I have to tell you, it's an erotic scene. Not because he shows a lot of graphic detail, but because he shows a series of quick shots of various body parts, yet, somehow, the shots seem to linger, almost suggestively. In one shot, Tessa's leg is raised in the air as Quayle removes her stocking. What these series of shots convey is their mad infatuation with each other. Later, she visits Quayle's office and he literally drops everything to give her his undivided attention. Weisz conveys that she genuinely loves Fienne's character and we form an attachment to her.

The cast is filled with a number of great supporting characters who add to the mystery. Danny Huston (""The Aviator"", ""Birth"") plays Sandy, Quayle's associate who may have had a hand in the mystery. Bill Nighy (""Love, Actually"") is featured in a rare dramatic turn. And Pete Postlethwaite (""Dark Water"", ""The Shipping News"") makes an impact in a particularly brief role.

""The Constant Gardener"" is that rare thing, a film for adults that contains great performances, great writing, fashioned with skill that actually makes you think about something other than car chases or dumb comedy.",1125964800,,5610,4.973347547974414
2453520,2,B000C65Z20,"I was really prepared to like and be impressed with this film, but I just can't lower my standards. Tessa, a 24 year old free spirit who has already written her will, marries a stodgy British government person (what was it he did?), they travel to Africa, and she meets a black doctor named Blum. There's some weird stuff going on with this pharmaceutical company and its investors (if medicine is approved there will be 1500 jobs in France).  They are trying out this TB medicine on AIDS patients to see what the side effects are, instead of trying it out on TB patients. Side effect: kills AIDS patients.  This doesn't matter to the pharm company because these people's lives are expendable to them, but it's a big secret that no one must figure out.  Tessa and Blum figure it out and she writes a report, and very stupidly makes sure it gets to exactly the wrong people.  Blum, who previously shushed her, wants to go to the media, but she says no, do it her way. Why? So her husband will not have to be embarassed by her.  She and Blum are murdered, and her husband spends the movie (many flashbacks) trying to find out who precisely is responsible.  Bigwigs sit at a large table to discuss the problem (how to hide it from him), then various ones come forward to spill the beans to hubby to help him figure it out.

Basically, this movie makes no sense. Re-write it to where the characters have brains and plausible motives, then maybe it wouldn't be a complete failure.",1125964800,,1475,4.481343283582089
2453521,5,B000C65Z20,"I have not cared very much for films or television series based on the novels of John Le Carre; they have been slow moving and I found I usually did not care about the characters.  The Constant Gardiner is much different.  At first, judging from the trailers, it seemed the film might be too intense and sad but I found that the tragic elements of the story were handled well.  The film begins in Africa with the brutal murder of Tessa (Rachael Weisz) and disappearance of her companion, a native doctor (Hubert Kounde).  The film then moves to Tessa's husband Justin, a member of the British High Commission in Nairobi (Ralph Finnes), being told his wife is dead by his slippery ""friend"" Sandy (Danny Huston).  The story is told with sensitivity relating the love story between Tessa and Justin through flashbacks, the editing of which is handled with great skill.

Tessa was an outspoken woman and the opposite of the quiet Justin.  They have an arrangement that they will have an open marriage not pry into each other's lives.  So there is a mystery surrounding Tessa.  Was she having an affair with the native doctor?  Did he kill her?  Justin is haunted by remorse that he could have done something to prevent Tessa's death and gradually learns that his wife had uncovered a secret, and she was killed to prevent its exposure.

Ralph Finnes is magnificent as the mild mannered Justin.  We watching him grow from his first meeting with Tessa from a shy lover into a settled family life and his determination to discover the truth about her death.  Rachael Weisz is also excellent as Tessa; she is the opposite of Justin in her forward and outspoken nature, willing to confront anyone. Danny Houston is perfect as Sandy, although claiming to be a friend to Tessa and Justin he does not think twice about betraying them.  The conspirators behind Tessa's death are particularly effective with Nick Reding playing the cold-hearted Crick.  It was interesting to see Pete Postlethwaite (Brassed Off) playing Dr. Lorbeer, a tired old doctor working out in the bush who provides Justin with his evidence.

I did find the photography a little jarring at times.  Many of the flashbacks were shot with hand-held cameras deliberately made unsteady, as if someone was making a home movie - perhaps to give the impression of random thoughts?.  The shaking of the camera and blurring of the picture actually made my wife dizzy.  Overall, I found that most of it worked, and that the cinematography was impressive.

The characters of the film are finely drawn and the story moves along at a steady pace; we are drawn into the lives of Justin and Tessa from the beginning to the end.  I thought that the memories that Justin has of the dead Tessa were particularly well done and place nicely throughout the film.  It brings home his love and devotion for her and that she is never out of his mind.  We understand his drive to discover the truth and are carried along until the conclusion.  Another important subject of the film is how African countries are being exploited.  We see the vast slum of Nairobi where 80,000 people live in tin huts amid every kind of filth. So, The Constant Gardiner tells not only a story of people caught in a conspiracy but also something of the poverty of Africans and how countries like Kenya are still at the mercy of the developed countries.",1125964800,,3364,4.717465753424658
2453522,1,B000C65Z20,"I had high hopes for The Constant Gardner! Sure the cinematography and soundtrack are magnificent, but if that's all I wanted to see I'd rent a documentary, or nature program.

Medical research is an issue that's near and dear to my heart! I worked many years in the pharmaceutical industry recruiting subjects for 100's of medical studies. Most were fairly harmless, some of them risky, others were plain ridiculous. I even participated in a  fairly risky study myself, (of course, it wasn't described that way), to atone for my sins. Real or imagined. Even though I worked there for years, one of the doctors conducting the study told me a bald face lie in order to ""convince"" me to participate. His obvious deception did not stop me from participating in the trial, since money was not the motivating factor. As a result, I, along with many others, experienced temporary, but severe side effects. The study was eventually yanked, and thankfully that particular vaccine never saw the light of day! So one can only imagine the utter nonsense that goes on in Third World countries, or in poor communities, here, in the good-old U.S. of A. with regards to medical research. But that's a story for another day!

While abusing folks to make money is nothing new to capitalism, this is the first time Hollywood tried to tackle  the pharmaceutical industry, head-on. The problem with this movie, besides the disgusting scenes of violence and death, is the extremely pessimistic message: If you expose the pharmaceutical industry, or any other powerful transnational corporation, you can expect to be either  murdered; tortured AND murdered, if you're really unlucky; or essentially commit suicide because you're depressed from losing a loved one.

The ending was also lousy for other reasons. Suggesting even if you blow the whistle rather dramatically in public, you will never know what happens to the bad guys in the end. It's left to your imagination. Other rotten messages are: Western governments are totally corrupt. You have no friends among your colleagues,  when the chips are down. In order to be a successful activist, you must keep your spouse clueless of the dangers, ad nauseam! Wow! Who the hell, but a fool, would want to side with the poor and the downtrodden, if death and self-destruction is all you're going to get in return?

Hollywood, you will sell a lot more tickets by by writing your fiction with a bit more hope. Good does triumph over evil, every now, and then, in the real world!",1125878400,,2504,4.90307328605201
2453523,4,B000C65Z20,"Based on a novel by John Le Carre, this brand new film starring Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz just opened in theaters.

Fiennes is cast as a rather conventional British diplomat who falls in love with the fiery Rachel Weisz.  In the first few minutes of the film they meet, mate, marry and go off to Africa where Fiennes is stationed.

He'd rather tend his garden and keep a blind eye to the truths around him.  She adopts the humanitarian causes of the people and sometimes embarrasses Fiennes by telling off the stuffed shirt diplomats in his circle.  He adores her though and their relationship is hot even though it seems as she and an African doctor are having an affair.

Everything is shattered when the African doctor and Rachel Weisz are brutally murdered.  That's when mild-mannered Fiennes gets involved in the investigation.  What he discovers is corruption at the highest level, involving big pharmaceutical companies who are using the Africans as guinea pigs to test new drugs.  Fiennes' investigation leads to more and more discoveries.  Eventually, his own life is in danger.

The acting is excellent and so is the cinematography.  It really seemed to be the real Africa although the country remained unnamed. I do question the title because there was little about gardening in the film with the exception that it seemed that Fiennes would rather tend his garden than get involved in the horrible politics around him.  Then, of course, he couldn't stop himself.

I enjoyed the film and especially like the fact that it addressed some real issues in the world today.  It almost didn't matter that the details of the plot were a little confusing at times.  I wish it grabbed my emotions more though.  I know it was supposed to as it deals with the dire results of human greed and corruption.",1125878400,,1806,4.792880258899676

If there was one thing that I got out of the film, it is the fact that poor people are not given any respect in this society, whether in Kenya or New Orleans.  The film revolves around mid-level British diplomat Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) and his leftist activist wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz).  Tessa and his African doctor companion are killed in the beginning of the film, which was initially believed by road bandits.  But as the film progresses it is learned that Tessa was murdered because she found out that pharmaceutical companies, with the help of British government cronies, are testing dangerous drugs on unsuspecting Africans.  Unfortunately this is a very real problem as corporations use the developing world as guinea pigs.  In many cases pharmaceutical company will deny people important drugs to treat other diseases, such as AIDS, if they don't comply with taking these shady tests.  Because the vast majority of Africans live below the poverty line, many corporations think it is okay to take advantage of this.  The film also delves into briefly into the rights and wrongs of the Iraq War and the homosexuality of the African doctor (which would interestingly be a great subject for a whole other film).  While I thought the love story in the film was a bit sappy, I give the film high marks because I do feel it is important for people to know about the social ills going on around them.  Maybe as a result of viewing the film a few more people might want to get involved with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Oxfam or some other like-minded organization to learn about the issues.  After the success of Hotel Rwanda and potentially this film, maybe Hollywood is starting to realize that there are some people in the world that want to view films that have socially redeeming value.  You will definitely leave this film more informed about the real world, if not entertained.",1125792000,,2039,4.777777777777778

Rachel Weisz solidifies herself as one of the best actresses working today with a powerful performance that is not only mysterious but strong and compelling as well. Her performance is the highlight of the whole film and that quite a feat considering the fact that Ralph Fiennes gives the best performance of his career with a tight rounded character who is the anchor for the audience to go on this emotional and terrifying journey into the heart of real evil. He's a perfect acting partner with Weisz in every way and their love story is compelling and heartbreaking as well.
Fernando Meirelles gives the film an emotional edged that is equally satisfying and scary as well because he treats this story as kind of a documentary and by doing that, you are put into kind of a real life drama that is real to the point of feeling the emotions and the horror of what is going on.

This is the best movie of the year in my opinion, and I seriously doubt there will be a movie coming out that will mach the drama, the acting or the terrifying truth that this movie gives.",1125705600,,1287,4.571428571428571
2453528,3,B000C65Z20,"The Constant Gardener is a beautiful movie.  The scenery of Africa and parts of Europe are quite captivating.  Ralph Fiennes superbly portrays a diplomat official, Justin Quayle, who wants to find out why his wife (Rachel Weisz) has been raped and murdered.  Was this vile act committed by mere thugs, or is there something more sinister going on?  Tessa, after all, was investigating suspicious tests of AIDS patients who are also threaten with TB.  Are the multinational drug companies behaving in an altruistic manner, or are they diabolically experimenting on helpless indigenous Africans?  Furthermore,  what is the role being played by certain people within the British diplomatic corp?  Sandy (Danny Huston) is Justin's partner and supposed friend.  Is he actually trustworthy?  Justin is a quiet and retiring man who prefers staying in the background.  Will he find the fortitude to relentlessly search for the truth?  There are no weak acting performances in this film.  Director Fernando Meirelles, however, fails miserably in presenting a story that might be able to hold the interest of the general public.  This movie eventually became so boring that I could barely wait for it to end.

Am I presenting a biased opinion?  Can I even be remotely fair considering that I  strongly believe only free market economic policies can save the desperately poor of the world?  I think I can achieve this goal, but perhaps others will disagree.  Allow me to be blunt: The Constant Gardener is not even slightly subtle with its anti-capitalist message.  The exact opposite is the unfortunate reality.  I felt like Meirelles employed a sledge hammer approach to convince the audience that the major corporations will stop at nothing, including torture and murder, to increase their profits.  Such heavy handed propagandizing is never appropriate.  One can indeed lay it on too thickly.  A lighter touch is required.  Who will enjoy The Constant Gardener?  Are you someone who like the offerings of Michael Moore and Oliver Stone?  If so, this might be right up your alley.  But if you are anyone else---this film will put you to sleep.

2453529,5,B000C65Z20,"Justin Quayle, middle-level English bureaucrat (Ralph Fiennes, the perfect Le Carre' protagonist, circa 2005) is palpably appreciative when Tessa (Rachel Weisz, radiant, earth-motherly) deems to, really anoints him with, at the beginning of Fernando Meirelles' ""The Constant Gardener,"" a hot session in bed.  In fact, Quayle goes so far as to thank Tessa; which says more about Quayle's commitment to his Freesias, his backyard garden and his avoidance of really living than it does about Tessa's prowess in bed.
But that being said, the friction between the stiff-upper lip Quayle and the free-thinking, socially liberal and aware Tessa forms the backbone of Meirelles and Le Carre's outstanding film. Feinnes and Weisz's vibrant and provocative performances give this film a moral and intellectual as well as a human-level sensual and sexual center that binds the worlds of international diplomacy and social consciousness in a way that makes this film not only chock full of real-life ambiguity but also current and thought-provoking as well.
But then Justin is transferred to Africa and Tessa pleads with him to take her. And it is at this point that the movie changes tone from one of romance, lust and personal fulfillment to one of subterfuge on several levels: personal, governmental and that involving major drug companies using the medicine starved Africans as guinea pigs for their experimental drugs: many times to disastrous results.
Director Fernando Meirelles deserves a place in the pantheon of directors based solely on his revolutionary and disturbing ""City of God"" and here he boldly paints his canvas in broad strokes of saturated, gorgeous Technicolor for the scenes in Africa and solemn, dreary gray for the scenes in England and Europe: a little obvious maybe but effective nonetheless. Meirelles also becomes a little preachy towards the end of the film that I could have done without though I know that most people know nothing of what goes on generally in Africa and specifically in regards to the synergies between the African nations and the major drug companies.
Fernando Meirelles' ""The Constant Gardener"" is a terrific movie: breathtaking to look at, superbly acted by all but specifically by Feinnes, Weisz, Danny Huston and Bill Nighy. But it is not an easy movie to love for it wears its heart on its sleeve, at times pleading to us for understanding and compassion and Meirelles sometimes forgets that the best films show us...they do not tell us. Besides all this, there is undeniable power in the images presented and a formidable intellect to back them up and so we give in to it...allowing the exotic and rare perfume of Meirelles film to take us to a place we've never been before.",1125705600,,2721,5.1008968609865475

The Constant Gardner not only delivers the thrills and the political savvy of the best of them but it's scary to the point of questioning the world around you. Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz deliver powerful performances as two people from the opposite side of life who fall in love only to really know each other in the worse possible way. Fiennes is a shy and timid diplomat who falls for an outspoken and dedicated activist who loves to get into trouble. As the old word is said, opposites attract and they fall in love. When she is found murdered in road in Africa, Fiennes begins to suspect that more is going on that people want him to believe, so he goes on a quest to not only discover what has happen to his wife but to find out what is really going on. The things he find out are will not only shock him but shock the viewer as well with a real look into the power structure of a corrupt government that is being dictated to by big business and they lengths it will go to make the all might dollar. Fernando Meirelles delivers the goods with a fast paced and somber look at human evil and the notion of love conquering all and he does it in such a realistic way that does bring you right in the movie and into the characters lives.

Ralph Fiennes is just great as a grieving man out to find out the circumstances of his wife's murder and the reasons behind it. His performance is a texture of desperation and self-discovery and he begins to show faith in not only his wife's memory but in the world itself in his way to find justice. While Fiennes gives a great performance, it's truly Rachel Weisz who shines the most with he complex, powerful and tricky performance. We only get to know her from flashbacks and dialog from people who have met her character and from Justin himself. Some of those flashbacks are deceiving but all of them make up a total character who is structured enough towards the end to get a real picture of who she was. It's a tightrope of a performance and Rachel Weisz not only serves it up with class and strong will but with grace as well. She literally gives the performance of the year and it would be a crime towards real cinema if she were not recognizes for her efforts come Oscar time.

The acting is great; Fiennes is one of my favorite actors, and he's in rare form here.  Rachel Weisz is also outstanding.  The look of the film is killer, as to be expected from the director/cinematographer duo that brought us the dazzling ""City of God"" a few years ago.  But the film as a whole just doesn't hold together for me, largely due to a nagging sense of deja vu.  Follow me here (SPOILERS):  a man's wife is murdered; the powers that be tell him what happened; he doesn't believe their version, and spends the rest of the film looking for the real truth behind the death of his wife; the trail ultimately leads to an evil pharmaceutical company, protecting its interests and untold future billions to be reaped from a miracle drug that everyone will want; truth is outed in a public forum, revealing the greedy scumbags for what they are.  Now, did I just describe the plot of ""The Constant Gardener""?  Nope, I was talking about Harrison Ford's movie version of ""The Fugitive"".  That this is being touted as one of the year's best films says a lot about the lack of quality filmmaking and the shortness of the American attention span, I guess...",1125532800,,1315,4.581196581196581
2453534,4,B000C65Z20,"Fernando Meirelles (""City of God"")has crafted a intelligent political thriller that isn't without its flaws. First a warning--almost every review here (mine included has some plot spoilers **but** most of these spoilers are points that are revealed fairly early. Ralph Fiennes plays Justin Quayle a mild mannered diplomat driven to action when his wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz in a free spirited, powerful performance)a political activist is brutally murdered in Kenya. Quayle goes on a quest to bring those responsible for her murder to justice even though it might endanger his life uncovering a conspiracy that is little more than a ""marriage of convenience"". As he strips away the polite, politically correct veneer that surrounds those around him he uncovers a darkness that consumes his friends and may, ultimately, consume him as well.

This isn't a simple political thriller like ""Conspiracy"". Meirelles film is challenging as it is primarily told in flashback with some puzzling flash forwards towards the end that rob the ending of much of its power. The denouncement could have easily been placed at the end of the film without robbing it of its dramatic conclusion. That minor flaw aside and the fact that a good fifteen minutes needed to be cut from the film and the pacing tightened up a bit, ""The Constant Gardener"" will involve you as a filmgoer. You're drawn into Fiennes' marvelous portrayal of Justin although there's just as much mystery at the heart of this man as there is about his wife. Dispelling some of that mystery with a bit more character development would also have helped the film as well; the best political thrillers work when we're drawn into the world of those characters we care about. Whether that character development and background is important will determine if you like this film or not to some extent. Since this is, essentially, told from the point of view (with the exception of a couple of scenes) of one man his lack of knowledge is our lack of knowledge and his discover ours. While the mystery at the heart of this thriller isn't the main point (as it was about a film with a somewhat similar premise ""The Fugitive""), that's a good thing as we, the audience, are clued in and figure out of much of what's going on before Justin does. That can be bad if the pacing lags and it does lag a bit in the middle of the film. The point of the film is as much about Justin discovering who his wife really is and who he is as much as it is about discovering the ""mystery"" at the heart of the plot. This isn't atypical of LeCarrie's work (nor is the unusual structure of the film which echoes much of the structure of the novel). It goes back to the old adage; we don't really know anything about anybody do we?

Technically challenging and visually stunning, Meirelles film will be an acquired taste for those geared towards more tradtional politial thrillers like ""The Interpretator"" or even ""Conspiracy"". There's much to like about this film including the fact that Meirelles takes a number of risks with the material and the performerances themselves. If you enjoyed the recent film of ""The Tailor of Panama"", you'll enjoy ""The Constant Gardener"". If you're looking for a thriller along the lines of the very good film ""Red Eye"" you'll probably be disappointed by the film.

Corporations are an extension of our culture and who we here beneath the polite, political veneer that we present. Motivation, whether a company or government is good or bad represents the culture that it serves but, more importantly, these same corporations can set the bar for the moral and ethical thing to do. Why do I bring all this up? Because ""The Constant Gardener"" like ""The Parallax View"" or ""Three Days of the Condor"" and like John LeCarrie's Smiley books (and the films adapted from them) represented the way that intelligent political thrillers used to be made. They held someone accountable and they also weren't afraid to play with the conventions of the genre.

The theatre was packed tonight, a Wednesday night, for what looked like a film that promised relief from the stream of duds and shallow movies as of late.

Ralf Fiennes plays Brit diplomat, Justin Quayle, on location in Kenya. His wife, 24 year-old Tessa (34 year-old Rachel Weisz) , tags along with handsome Dr. Arnold Bluhm as he visits the villages, dishing out medical aid. Tessa is a committed social activist, critical of conglomerates who hand out free medicine, etc., and pieces together her observations with the Dr. to come up with a conspiracy theory that she submits to a respected higher up in the British High Commission. Of course, big trouble later ensues.

Shot with many flash backs, the film is about Justin's one-man investigation of his wife's murder and the greedy players in the busines and political world who promise to profit enormously from the shady pharmaceutical industry's practices.

Some of camera work was disorienteering, as it is shot with a shaky hand-held camera. Some of the footage seems pointless. What's the point of having the scene with the bandits raiding the remote village? It's a bit disturbing to see the fleeing villagers being chased, shot or captured, while the huts burn to the ground. With a couple of scenes, you really get a sense of how little life is regarded over there as compared to the first world.

The main problem with this film is that it felt so unfocused. It's too long and drawn out. It's not a clear, succinct thriller. The sound in some of the room scenes is full of echoes. If you thought this was going to be anything like The English Patient, which also starred Ralf Fiennes, you will be surprised. The romance is played up but this is not a romance film. Fiennes, who is usually reserved in his roles, is surprisingly smiley with some boyish charm. Overall, the acting was quite solid.",1125446400,,1868,4.753086419753086
2453538,5,B000C65Z20,"Intelligent and moving political thriller that should be held right up there with ""All The Presidents Men"" and ""The Killing Fields "" as one of the best political thrillers ever made. Fernando Meirelles tops his last directional effort with a thriller that is moving, scary and down right forthright in it's views of big companies gone wrong and the horrors that they are willing to inflect on others for the sake of profit. Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes give career best performances in this film and that's a huge compliment considering the fact that they are good in almost everything they do, even in bad movies. Weisz is strong willed and obsessive and Fiennes is determine and endearing and both of them compliment each other with their destine to be award winning chemistry and acting chops. The director compliments both of them with a view of Africa that is rarely seen in film and a sense of reality that is only found in real life.

Weisz is perfection as Tessa Qualye, a civil rights activist who is murdered for trying to bring awareness of their illegal practices on the poor natives of an African village. Weisz gives her character a self-righteous drive that is made poignant by her determination and sheer will and she also makes her character human, not a stereotype, which makes her performance the more real. Ralph Finnes plays her grieving husband Justin, who takes up her cause and begins to lean of how wonderful his wife really was and what he missed during the time she was alive. His haunted performance is in my opinion his best ever and is the driving point of this haunting odyssey of justice, lost and self sacrifice.
