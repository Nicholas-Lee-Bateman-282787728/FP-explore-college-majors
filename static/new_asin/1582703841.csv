Being able to see that people of all ages have trouble defining happiness is the reason why this organization needs to continue their work in helping all age groups develop their own definition of happiness.",1492387200,,332,4.741379310344827
8351920,5,1582703841,"Have you ever paused in your life and realized that you weren't happy? Have you ever wondered why?

We Americans are blessed with abundance. And yet, today more than ever, I find it astonishing that our entire country seems to be descending into a downward spiral of anger and anxiety - churning in unhappiness, and erupting into aggression against each other. Why is there so much unhappiness, strife and stress among us? Why are our children lashing out and hurting each other - and themselves?

What or who deserves the blame? To what purpose? To what end? Has any of the shouting, shaming, blaming, hating and intolerance changed anything for the better, for anyone?

So, what IS happiness? Is anyone truly happy? If so, what is their secret? Is happiness even attainable?

Filmmaker and author Randy Taran asked herself these same questions one day, sparked by the tears of a loved one across a breakfast table. What sprang to life is PROJECT HAPPINESS, a journey taken by four California teens facing personal obstacles to their own happiness. The film asks them to go deeper than what lay on the surface, and leads them on a mind-expanding journey where they meet their peers in Nigeria and India. Exploring the issues we all face, day to day, they ask these questions and more of a number of diverse voices and cultural icons such as educational activist and filmmaker George Lucas, actor and humanitarian Richard Gere, neuroscientist Richard Davidson - and culminate their quest with an eye-opening, private conversation with the DALAI LAMA.

PROJECT HAPPINESS offers anyone, teen to senior, student, parent and teacher, rich and poor alike, plenty of answers - and a treasure trove of new questions to ponder. It is a profound, moving, joyful, inspiring film, bursting with insights on what it means to be happy.

I highly recommended PROJECT HAPPINESS for anyone feeling down and out, for families, rehab centers, middle and high school classrooms across the country - if for no other reason, but to open up fresh dialogue between our people, especially our young people; to help them address and share their concerns, challenges and emotional upheavals we all face in a world struggling for equilibrium.

PROJECT HAPPINESS is a welcome tonic and possible cure for the roller-coaster ride and angst that is growing up - and being human.",1491091200,,2347,4.971938775510204
8351921,5,1582703841,"Project Happiness is an incredibly moving film by Randy Taran. Inspired by the love for her daughter, Randy sets off on a journey which spans many continents to find out the secret of happiness. She starts at a school in Northern California with a revolutionary teacher and his students. We get to know 4 teenagers in their senior year of high school. They have challenges in relating to their families and finding their destiny. This film gives me hope in the future because we see teenagers being inquisitive, euphoric, sad and brilliant. They interview George Lucas and one of them even brings his Star Wars light saber toy from his childhood. They also seek answers to the meaning of happiness from Richard Gere and ultimately get a private audience with the Dalai Lama. I was brought to tears at the end of the film when they return home from India. All of the teenagers are met at the airport by their parents and one girl knows her father won't show up for her. Surprisingly, the other passengers part like the Red Sea and we see that her father is there to meet her. She tearfully runs into his arms and we see them start to mend their broken relationship. I would recommend Project Happiness to anyone who wants to live a life of hope and joy.",1480550400,,1252,4.54424778761062

8351926,2,1582703841,"Didn't care for it much.  Interesting idea, great setup, but it just fizzled out without any real conclusions.  The turning point was when someone asked the dalai lama, ""How does one become happy?"" and his answer was, ""I don't know.""  And this was treated as some big revelation.  Check out my review for ""Happy,"" by Sonja Lyubomirsky.  Similar concept, interviews with much the same people, but I think done it a much more satisfying and useful way.",1415491200,3,450,4.792207792207792

It's a well crafted documentary that inspires viewers to go on their own personal journey to find happiness within themselves. Richard Gere, George Lucas, Richard Davidson, and the Dalai Lama all offer their own unique perspectives on happiness, and to watch the teens in the film learn and grow through the process is heartwarming. The statistics that are woven throughout the movie highlight an alarming crises facing today's youth, but the movie ends on a high note, leaving the audience hopeful and HAPPY!",1362614400,,564,5.01063829787234
