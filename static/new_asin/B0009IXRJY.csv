2293331,5,B0009IXRJY,"With a combination of archival and modern footage, this documentary cannot be beaten for showing just what it is about steam trains that is so enchanting (and dirty).

2293364,4,B0009IXRJY,"I thought this CD was pretty good,. I liked to see these old trains. Both my grandads worked on the Southern railroad at this time. I remember as a child in Sheffield,

2293368,5,B0009IXRJY,"Another excellent documentary brought to perfection by the History Channel. Some of the footage and music seems very old but this adds to the industrial character nicely. This includes footage of the Allegheny, so ridiculously powerful they say in that segment the railroad industry never had a job that could use up its performance. Plus there's brief footage of some large parts being put together in a factory. At last I must confess I'm not a train lover. I bought this for my 4 year old son who naturally likes trains.",1327968000,4,523,4.758241758241758

2293372,5,B0009IXRJY,"I bought quite a few DVDs for a paper I needed to write on steam locomotives.  This one was by far the best.  It's got a nice mix of technical and non-technical content.  The other DVDs were good, but a little cheesy and not as interesting.  The History Channel really did a nice job with this one.",1299715200,,298,4.175438596491228
2293373,3,B0009IXRJY,"This would have been a fantastic video if the frequent comments from Bill Withuhn had been left out. The comments are opinion, not fact, and anytime I hear him speak I am reminded that he is a politician rather than a railroader or railroad fan. Michael Palin would have been the perfect host for this video as seen in his recent journeys series with Nat Geographic.

The video of steam trains in action in the DVD does compensate for the issue above, however. Good variety and very high quality. Loved the N&W Y and UP Big Boy footage.",1298764800,14,536,4.469387755102041

8061531,5,B0009IXRJY,"A video you will watch over & over again. It provides interviews with retired firemen, brakemen & engineers & others who worked with steam locomotives to the engineers who designed them. Hearing their experiences with steam locomotives and how they made their lives for them and their families was so enjoyable. This DVD shows how the steam locomotive was responsible for the rapid growth of industry in America. It's all explained on this DVD. I enjoyed hearing the stories from the men who actually lived & worked in the days of steam locomotion. I'll keep this DVD in my library forever and hand it on down for all ages to enjoy. And I'm sure if your here looking at train DVD's on the webpage, you'll enjoy this one too.",1501977600,,724,4.62015503875969
