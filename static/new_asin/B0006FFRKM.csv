8041227,4,B0006FFRKM,"One of my biggest grips is the subbed English captions do not track will.  But this series does the job well.  I brought each dvd with 3 episodes so I am rating this as a whole, Note: there are 8 dvd's in all.  This was entertaining and fun to watch.",1332028800,,250,3.96
8041228,5,B0006FFRKM,"When you first watch this particular disc all the way through you will notice that it seems to come to a sort of climax! It seems that all the work of the past 2 discs of this Anime seem to come to a conclusion in episode 10. The nasty part is that they give us almost NO information on what is to come next besides some short and cheesy intro to the next episode. Anyway, to get down to business, this disc is all about ""Shepone"" (SP?) and her involvement with the ""Great Mission"". Throughout this disc we see a new character come into play and we have the pleasure of witnessing some nicely done CG work for all of the space flights. Though the series seems to come to a bit of a conclusion we are able to see that many elements that have been mysteriously alluded to in the past episodes are brought into light in this climax. Much speculation arises as to what may happen over the next few episodes. Now if only this series would be released faster . . . like every week or so . . . I am such an anime junkie . . . much more of Stellvia is yet to be revealed at this time!",1108857600,2,1076,4.0327102803738315
