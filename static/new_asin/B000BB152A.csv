2409558,5,B000BB152A,"This series is by far the most innovative and colorful to come forth this year. Criss is a definite triple threat. Exotically handsome with a hard rock edge, deeply philosophical about the enigmas that exist in our reality, and a genuine master of pure magical illusions. Move aside quirky Copperfield. Step away death-wish David Blaine. An Angel has come to open our mind and eyes to true courage and beauty in feats we wouldn't dream of attempting.",1128038400,6,450,4.857142857142857
2409559,5,B000BB152A,"I know I am being fooled by diversion of attention, deception, mis-direction and other tricks of the trade, but the illusions created and performed by Criss Angel are the best in the business.  Pure enjoyment, including the reactions of the crowds.  I have watched some of his ""illusions"" many times, trying to figure out ""how did he do that"", but with just a couple of exceptions, he has me fooled.",1459296000,,399,4.685714285714286

2409583,3,B000BB152A,"I need for ALL the packaging to be included. The Disk 2 was in a CD paper envelope inside the package that had Disk 1 in it. I'm not sure if it was supposed to come with a third Disk or not, but the other Criss Angel Seasons Three and Four came with 3 Disks each. So whether or not it was supposed to come with a third Disk, I still need the packaging to be complete. The seller said nothing about the packaging being INCOMPLETE ... Or at least, I didn't see anywhere where any statements were made regarding incomplete packaging. Whether this merchandise is supposed to have a third Disk or not is BESIDES THE POINT, because the packaging should have included something more than just a CD paper envelope for Disk Two.",1317945600,,719,4.333333333333333
2409584,4,B000BB152A,"Criss Angel fans, you will love this. Only complaint is the breaks (like on tv) they recap things and due to no commercial breaks, you seem to see more recaps of what just took place. wish they would cut those out, but he is definately one that always makes you say 'how did he do that'.",1315008000,,287,4.142857142857143
2409585,5,B000BB152A,I'm a fan of magic/illusions and the second season was one of my favorites. I highly recommend this dvd to all fans of Criss Angel.,1305504000,,131,4.28
2409586,5,B000BB152A,This was an AWESOME!!! my 11-year-old son enjoyed this very much and can't wait for the next set of discs for season 2.,1301875200,,119,4.217391304347826
2409587,3,B000BB152A,Criss Angel considers himself the new Houdini. He has a lot of good stuff in his shows but too often goes way overboard for my tastes. Younger crowd seems to love him though.,1290384000,,174,4.303030303030303
2409588,1,B000BB152A,"If you happen to like ""magic"" that insults your intelligence, then this is for you.  It's sensationalist claptrap for the most of it, relying on a variety of misdirecting dialogue and behavior rather than anything truly skillful in the way of ""magic"".

For instance, there was the tesla coil episode.  Sheesh.  First they show you previews of an ambulance, and Chris being carted away on a gurney.  That gets you thinking that something will happen.  It ""sets the stage"" visually and mentally and makes it easier for the observer to believe the load of bull he's going to try to hand you next.

Then he dons a mesh protective suit and then lets the Tesla operator ramp up the coil enough for a nice big spark-over in excess of about 3 or 4 feet long.  He takes the bolts easily in the suit because that's what the suit does:  It directs the current and voltage through the mesh suit to the ground rather than through your body.

Now here's the ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" moment.  Angel then lifts one foot off the ground long enough for a few sparks to become visible between the bottom of his foot to the ground.  (This is completely and utterly painless and NORMAL in the suit he was wearing!), but he feigns electrical injury; they shut off the coil, and cart him off to the hospital.

I have a couple of friends who are the creators of the now famous singing Tesla Coils on YouTube (see Masters of Lightning, and Dr. Zeus), and though I'm not an engineer, even I could tell his whole act was a total fakeup.  Lame, lame, lame.  Not believable at all.  After that episode, I never watched another one.  Couldn't stomach being insulted.

Buy this only if you like a fluff performance.  But don't think too hard about it or even more of his act will come apart.",1275264000,,1759,4.4748427672955975
2409599,5,B000BB152A,"I highly recommend this collection for any one who likes great, no, GREAT magic, slight of hand, and illusion.  He will freak out your mind!!",1256515200,,141,4.64
2409600,5,B000BB152A,"Criss is a 21st Century Houdini; not only to surpass his accomplishments but to far exceed them.  How he gets the ""rabbit out of the hat"" is far beyond me.  He is absolutely phenominal putting his life on the line to say to everyone watching him, that nothing in your life is impossible.  He is the 8th wonder of the world without doubt.",1252713600,,337,4.317460317460317
2409601,5,B000BB152A,"I bought the set for my granddaughter and her husband for Christmas they both love watching the show so know it will be liked, she can't wait until she gets to watch them. Its his present so he doesen't know he has them yet.",1227398400,,224,4.113636363636363

2409603,5,B000BB152A,"How does he do that?  If we knew how he does what he does then he wouldn't be as amazing as he is. What a superb showman Chris Angel is and what a magical, illusuonist is this wonderful Mindfreak! How DOES he do that!! Let's watch this one again...",1219968000,,248,4.061224489795919
2409604,5,B000BB152A,"I was amazed when I watched this dvd set. I never had a chance to see Season 1 when it was on T.V. Criss is amazing. I especially like his smaller magic tricks that he does one on one with people. His escapes and stunts are also amazing, but made me very nervous!!! I know he says he likes to blur reality and illusion, and he does this very well in these episodes. There is something about him that draws me in, he has a very warm personality. And he's pretty darn cute! I recommend this for anyone who loves great entertainment!",1219536000,,530,4.205882352941177
2409605,3,B000BB152A,"I've already seen this season on A&E. Wanted to own my personal copy in DVD. One of the best shows I like. I really enjoyed it. Wish I can tap in to that part of my brain someday and do amazing things. The possibilities are endless. Watching this DVD gets you motivated, and lets you think nothing is impossible. He also educates you on which ones are fake, and how not to get scammed. Anything is possible, if you only believe.",1216339200,,428,4.296296296296297

2409608,5,B000BB152A,Almost forgot to write this review;;; but alls well when I ordered these dvds.  Nice packageing; on time (even earlier than said)...so im well satisfied customer.  Good Job.  Denise (Pennsylvania),1199577600,,196,5.466666666666667
2409619,5,B000BB152A,"I know someone that was at Vandenburg AFB when MindFreak did their episode there.  That's the only case where I've known someone that's been around for Criss Angel's illusions.  She said everything was exactly as advertised ""What you see is what you get.""  I'm half convinced the man is using real magic; not the ""magic"" an illusionist would use but the real thing.  Mind-blowing whether it's actually an illusion or real magic.  I've been to a David Copperfield performance and I have to say I love the way Angel does his performances on the street impresses beyond Copperfield or anyone else.  Own seasons 1 and 2, looking forward to season 3!  Criss Angel, if you read through these reviews, looks like you're barely sleeping.  Don't crash and burn without needed rest.  We can't continue to be impacted on that ""emotional level"" if you don't give your body a break once in a while.  Love to catch a live performance someday...care to come to Misawa AB, Japan?",1199404800,,963,4.746987951807229
2409620,1,B000BB152A,"Okay, so Criss Angel has style ... but only if you're 13 years old and think that torn jeans, nail polish, and wearing your hat backwards is so cool.  But as a magician, he has no substance.  The lack of any disclaimers about trick photography, phony camera angles, bogus audiences, and prefabricated set-ups is a dead giveaway.  He is a great TV magician ... the important word being TV.  Anyone who thinks that Criss Angel is a true magician probably also believes that an aquarium is the same as the ocean.  If you're interested in the real thing, I have one word of advice for you ... SLYDINI!",1199318400,2,597,4.4907407407407405
2409621,5,B000BB152A,"I recently saw Criss Angel on the TV show Phenomenon and instantly fell in love with him.  I wanted more.  I like having the whole first season on DVD to enjoy whenever I want without the annoying commercials.  Lucky me.  Criss is personable, approachable, talented, and fabulous to watch.  He's easy on the eyes. too.  I'm beyond satisfied with this purchase.",1197849600,,360,4.819672131147541
2409622,5,B000BB152A,"I already wrote a review for Season 1 of this show. My foray into Criss Angel's world continued into Season 2. What can I say with the typewritten word to convey what it is I want to convey in this review? You see, I could tell you how great and mystifying Criss Angel is from a standpoint of viewing him as a stuntman, illusionist, and mentalist. I could tell you specifics of him walking on water, levitating, getting cut in half (in the open, not behind a box) or doing some cool motorcycle tricks. All of that is cool, but that isn't what makes this show special in my eyes, and it certainly isn't the sole thing that makes Criss stand apart.

I have never seen Criss' demonstrations live, and I am a bit of a skeptic, so I could sit here and freeze individual frames in the show, trying to figure out how he does what he does. Is it real? Is it an illusion? Is it fancy camera editing? Please . . .

I hope one day to see him do his thing in front of my - hopefully, unbelieving, mindfreaked - eyes. I'm not here to pick his demonstrations apart. While I do have a sense of wonderment about how he does things, I'm not about figuring him out, either. What I am after is to be entertained, and he has done that - albeit in a slightly different way - for Season 2.

The mesmerizing demonstrations are still there, although it appears that Criss has scaled back a little bit (and I emphasize little) on dancing with the devil by not performing as many death-wish stunts as he did in Season 1. What I think is a little different here is that I dare to think that we are seeing more than Criss Angel - we are seeing Christopher Nicholas Sarantakos. I think we are starting to see the Person behind the Illusionist.

What I mean here is that, not only have I managed to become mindfreaked with Season 2, but I been tickled with the laughing fits. The humor in Season 1 was only hinted at (as in the episode, Chicken. Try that one on for a little light-heartedness - it's one of my favorite episodes from Season 1). Some of the extras on the disc provide this humor, as do the episodes themselves. We are introduced to Crissy, one butt-ugly chick, to provide some comic relief and some nightmares as well. This dressing-up-to-look-ridiculous-and- be-as-obnoxious-as-I-can trend continues with Season 3 when we are introduced to other lovable characters in the Angel archives, but that's another review altogether.

What makes this man stand out to me is what I see behind the magic. I one episode, entitled Chad's Story, Criss makes a young magician's dream come true by coaching him and giving him a chance to perform with Lance Burton. Chad's story is truly tragic, as he had cancer when he was a very young child, and even died on a few occasions. His father taught him magic to keep his mind off the pain of his illness. Chad overcame his illness and was considered cured, only to lose his father to cancer shortly thereafter. Those who know anything about Criss Angel, aka Christopher Sarantakos, knows that he had lost his father to stomach cancer years ago. He took care of his father when he couldn't take care of himself, or even eat any kind of food. His father died in his arms, and something in Criss changed after that. He claims it made him fearless and gave him the inspiration to do what he does.

You know, Criss Angel is a new guy for me. I just discovered him months ago. I have had favorite celebrities over the years. I don't put them on a pedestal, and I'm not attracted to the kinds who do give off the ""diva"" act. If I became famous for one of my talents, would that mean I was less of a human? Would my personable qualities go away? I don't think so. Fame changes people, but life does, too.

Don't judge a book by its cover. People are multi-layered. Sometimes what you see isn't everything you're going to get, but just a fraction of it. Granted, if Criss had come out in his full Goth-garb like he was sporting pre-Mindfreak days, I might have run for the hills. I'm glad I found him when I did. He's a little less Goth these days and more rock-n-roller, but people will still form their opinions.

Chad's Story was proof there is more than one side. In that episode, what he said to Chad is what you have cannot be sold and cannot be bought. He was talking about personality. When people want to know what makes Criss freak my mind so much, I don't just point to the demonstrations. I point to how kids are magnetically drawn to him. I point to how he handles animals and how they seem to love him. I point to how he hugs his mom or how close he is to his brothers. I point to how he interacts with people and seems to charm them and make them feel at ease. I point to an almost childlike enthusiasm (Check out Bike Jump Vanish. He's like a kid on that bike). Criss is crazy, but he's not creepy.  He's got a sick sense of humor at times, but it's funny. He's not only talented, but terribly intelligent. His mind is always clicking. He's a light and an inspiration. There's something warm and personal about him. Maybe I'm wrong and he's mindfreaked us all by inserting subliminal messages throughout the episodes. Maybe we've all been hypnotized into submission. I suppose it's possible, but I don't think so.

Season 2, like Season 1 and Season 3, is one big roller-coaster ride - all good fun. Now, I think I'm going to go out and confront my fears.

ARE YOU READY????",1195862400,,5399,4.372881355932203
2409623,5,B000BB152A,"I had written a review for Season 1 about two years ago, and I have decided to rewrite it from a different standpoint. Two years later, and now with Season 5 just wrapping up, I am looking back at Season 1 rather than starting out with it.

My interest in Criss Angel came quite by accident. He was someone I stumbled across while I was flipping through the TV. When I decided to check him out, I took both Season 1 and Season 2 out of the library, along with his biography. I was also checking into his music as well.

I started with Season 1, and I can tell you that I pretty much watched the whole thing in one sitting. I was captivated by it. I think I managed to watch two episodes of Season 2 before ordering my own copies of both seasons. I also didn't return the library's until I had my own in my hands.  I was never a fan of magicians, but something was different about Criss, and there was something more appealing about Criss that extended beyond his magical talents.

Now, after just about wrapping up Season 5 with one more episode to go, I can look back at Season 1. Season 1 was the beginning of the TV Series, Mindfreak. I view Season 1 in a special way because this was a new thing for Criss with doing this television show. He has some following now, but it is almost uncanny to view Season 1 and the small crowds that were available to watch these demonstrations as opposed to the throng of devoted followers he has now. As they say, you've come a long way baby. There was no pretense in this season. He made a transition from being a ""goth"" guy from his earlier specials (Mindfreak Special, Supernatural, Made in Japan) to this approachable, charming, seemingly warm individual who was hungry in his craft and creative with his art.

Just about every episode has dealt with a stunt that was considered dangerous and death-defying. He put himself on the line to catch the public's attention and it worked. From this point on, he showed more humor and personality in the next two seasons, while still having the tricks and stunts, but curbing back a tad on the danger factor. Season 3 started to see a rise in his popularity, and there was more of a thrust of image being brought to the forefront. By Season 4, there was lots of image, some stunts, and his personality appeared to have changed, which is why I have reviewed that season as the weakest. The latest Mindfreak is a 5-part hour-long special returning to his roots a little, but that's another review.

I would tell the new fan to start with this season if they don't have anything by Criss Angel, and then work upward through the seasons. I would then advise a look into his pre-Mindfreak days with the above-mentioned specials to acquire another viewpoint into how some of these demonstrations started out, and how Criss started out before he landed a TV deal with A&E.

Season one is the Huger and the Heart of why Criss does what he does. You have your stunts, and you have some cool slight of hand. You have a guy that wasn't as much an image as he was an artist. You have a guy who I found extremely likable. You get to see his family a lot in this season, too, which tells you a lot about his family values and what was important to him.

Criss has said himself that he's more about the way the trick made you feel than about the trick itself. He's all about that ""emotional"" connection. My wish for him would be to not see him lose that. Because each of us are individuals, who he is as a person is as much a selling point as his bag of tricks are. His personality and his art should stand on its own, and that is what I would like to see him known for.

I don't want to see him become a Britney Spears who is known more for her tabloid dramas, or what she wears or doesn't wear, than for her music and dancing. He doesn't need to generate ""talk"" by going that route - just let your personality and your creativity be the guiding light. Some of that got lost in Season 4 with the flashy, tabloid image he was portraying. He's better than that.

Season 1 is proof of that.

ARE YOU READY?

2409627,5,B000BB152A,I don't know how he does it. The man is the best I have ever seen. I don't think he is human. But he is beyond words amazing at what he does.,1181433600,,141,3.4375
2409628,5,B000BB152A,"I can't reccomend this Criss Angel's mindfreak series enough. He is a real self made man, and one of the greatest magicians ever! His goal is to make magic popular again, because in his words ""magic has become a cheap novelty"". That's so true. I can remember as a young child (in the 1980's) watching these huge stage magic shows. There was alot of props, smoke and mirrors. It was pretty lame.

Criss has changed that by performing mind bending illusions in public. Not only does he perform illusions, he also performs death defying stunts. Aside from the magic and stunts, Criss is a good guy with family values. Sure, he is a bit of a flirt when it comes to the ladies, but what guy in his position wouldn't be?

(DVD QUALITY: don't let the cheap price fool you. This quality of the 2 DVDs are very good (smooth, clean picture, and great sound).",1180915200,2,848,4.464516129032258
2409639,4,B000BB152A,"At first I found a lot of Chris Angel's tricks really annoying.  I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to assume about what was an illusion and what was a stunt; who was in the audience and who was in the show; what was a ""real"" object and what was a magic prop; what was an unadulterated place and what was a set-up stage; and what was perceivable by the audience vs what was perceivable only by the camera.  But then I decided that this was part of the genius of it.  Magic presented on a traditional stage spells all that out for you in mind numbing detail.  Here you're left to wonder.

2409691,4,B000BB152A,"This writer loved Criss Angel from the moment she first saw Mindfreak on tv.

Of course, it may be because she has a bit of a crush on him, but that's beyond the point.

So, when she saw the first season of the show on DVD, she had to have it.

This writer loved his inventive tricks and his charismatic persona, however now seeing these shows with no ad interuptions, she has a few bones to pick.

For starters, she really is sick of hearing from the advisors on how great he is. Shut the hell up!

Another is the audience. They tend to overreact over Criss' tricks. If she hears another idiot on the street jump, use a four-letter word, or ask how that was possible when ever he does an illusion, she is going to scream.

Another is that she's tired of seeing Criss' ""family"" all the time. She does not want to see another scene of the fat woman, the kid on the bike, the count, the midget, or the beautiful woman in the skimpy dress.

Fortunately, if you have a DVD player with a fast forward function, you can go past all of those bits.

However, it is quite amusing to see the reaction of his real-life family before a stunt. One could almost form a drinking game just on the number of times J.D. becomes neurotic, Costa reassures him, and his mother panics (in fact, this writer has).

Other than its flaws, it is otherwise a good show and she hopes that there is a third season.",1168732800,3,1385,4.255725190839694
2409692,3,B000BB152A,"I love Criss Angel.
I love what he does.

He's an interesting illusionist, and i'm a fan of his music as well.
So please don't take any of this review as me bashing Criss, personally.

Season 1 was amazing. Criss did alot of dangerous and mind-boggling things. One being hanging by his back from hooks, while a helecoptor suspends him hundreds of feet above the earth. That was cool. Another cool thing he did in Season 1, was being stricken by a tesla coil, and nearly being electrocuted to death due to a mishap. Then there was the episode where he was put into a barrel filled with water, suspended in air, and had to escape before the barrel plummeted to the ground, and killed him.

...These all may seem like ""stunts"", and not ""illusions"", but they were death-defying, and quite interesting. Heck, even some of the ""illusions"" in Season 1, were pretty cool. Such as when Criss cut his wrist open, to pull out an initialed quarter.

...Season 2 however strays away from alot of these cool looking stunts and illusions, and seems to present more unrealistic and even at times ""funny"" illusions. Such as pulling a woman in half. That wasn't realistic...it was funny, and somewhat stupid. Then at one time, Criss was sawn in half by a giant saw, but no blood was apparent during this entire illusion. Thus, proving none of it was real. Because obviously, if you cut anyone in half, they're going to bleed...to death.

It saddens me to say that Season 2 just wasn't as interesting as Season 1 was. Call me a sucker for ""intense"" and ""bloody"" illusionry and stunts, but I don't find making an elephant disappear, very interesting. I've seen it done before countless times. Why would I wanna see Criss do it?

Furthermore, I didn't like the fact that Criss had to spam the phrase ""we've never met before, correct?"" That just screams ""setup"". Saying it once in awhile is okay, but saying it in nearly every single Season 2 episode, just begs you to wanna scream at the guy.

If he's so bent on proving what he's doing is real, then perhaps he should go back to doing what WAS real. Such as hanging by his back from hooks, and being suspended hundreds of feet in the air by a helecoptor, and risking serious injury, and or death.

That was interesting. I'm not gonna lie.

But that's not saying that Season 2 isn't worth owning nor watching, that's only saying that it fails to shock as much as Season 1 did. And where it tries to, it's far too unrealistic to create even a gasp.

In one such instance, Criss tried to balance on the sharp points of a gate, and ended up falling onto the said points, and wound up having his chest skewered. While yes, this was cool...there was no blood. Then he even cracked a joke about it. Thus making it entirely unecessary, and somewhat stupid.

If people open their eyes, they'll realize that Season 2 tries so hard to be ""believeable"" that it loses alot of what Season 1 had. Believeability. Shock value. And overall, a better episode roster.

I don't mean to be the ""bad man"" here, but i'm not going to lie to any of you. Season 2 is somewhat boring compared to Season 1. It's still intersting in many instances, but after watching one episode from each season, a viewer would probably choose the Season 1 episode over the Season 2 episode. Simply because Season 1 was more interesting, shocking, violent, believeable, and noteworthy.

Season 2 is good, but somewhat boring. Get it to add to your collection. But don't expect anything really risky, shocking, or bloody, as seen in Season 1.

3/5 Stars.

Better luck in Season 3, Criss.",1168560000,,3572,4.568075117370892

Is he a little hookey?.....Yup.

Season 2 upped the ante over Season 1.  The effects are better.  There are more over all effects.  Best of all, no lame hanging from a helicopter kind of episode.  I have read a lot of magic books, and know how a lot of effects are done.  However, at least once per episode of Mind Freak I am scratching my head.

I don't really buy into the dark mysterious personna of Angel.  I really like his behind the scene personality that shows he is a regular goofy magic guy.

2409713,5,B000BB152A,"I remember looking forward to the Criss Angel Halloween shows he used to do for the ABC Family channel. The guy would do things that would literally make me gasp. But I guess that is what good magic is supposed to do, huh? It is supposed to get you to question what is real and what is not. Because I believe so strongly in the power of the mind and its ability to do anything, I often wonder if Criss Angel is giving us a preview of the possibilities that are inherent within each of us. Not that I'm particularly eager to be put in a pine box and go through a wood chipper.

My wife, who practices Wicca, says that a lot of the things he is able to do are not illusions, he really is doing them. He is able to convince himself that he is the illusion and that the magic is real. Most spiritual masters believe that this every day reality isn't reality at all, it's all illusion; that there is really is nothing that is solid, that everything is Energy. Even Albert Einstein said this. But even though I have a feeling that they are right, that everything I see is simply a projection of my own mind and what it wants to believe, I'm going to leave it to Criss Angel to walk around on fire only to fall down, collapse, and have the fireman that put him out be Criss Angel himself. Huh? All I can say is, you gotta see it. Criss always comes out of these things with a smile on his face, which is also something that Spiritual Masters tend to do. Y'see, they know...we don't...we're left scratching those heads we think our so solid and so real.

Do I recommend this collection? Heck, yeah...it will freak you out, but it will also make you start to question what we really are capeable of being, of doing, of experiencing. But don't worry about it too much, afterall, none of it's ultimately real...

This Greek guy is really fabulous.

The show is mindboggling, but at the same time down to earth, in spite of it's subject matter, and Criss Angel just has one of the those ""larger than life"" personality types that just draws you into being interested in his world, whether or not you've ever been into reality or magic shows, either one. Not to mention the fact that if you happen to be female (or otherwise inclined, I suppose) he's a hard man to take your eyes off of, no magic required!

In my opinion, this DVD does an excellent job of showcasing Criss as the Best Magician in the world right now, even though judging from all the talk on the Web at this time, there seems to be a fair amount of opposition out there on that claim.  Why all the jealousy and sceptism exists at this time towards Criss and his talents, I don't know.  But if anyone out there is looking at this DVD with a sceptical eye, or towards debunking Criss Angel's talents, let's consider for a moment what performing magic and/or being an illusionist is really all about.

2409729,4,B000BB152A,"Okay...as an opening statement:

If you're looking for the unseen ""Bullet Catch"" episode, you're NOT going to find it on this DVD!

Aparently the episode was deemed ""too hot for TV"", THEN aparently ""too hot for this DVD."" While yes, I do find that somewhat assanine, i'm not going to complain about it too much. Although I basically DID get this DVD, hopeing that the BC episode with JD, would atleast make an appearance here. Just so I could atleast see the only part of season one, that nobody got to see.

But I was wrong.

Contrary to the DVD title, this is infact NOT ""the COMPLETE season 1"", because it's missing a few episodes. It's missing the following:

1. Bullet Catch

-The episode featuring JD (Jonathan Davis) of Korn, which was never aired. It was banned from being so. And thus, might be the reason why it's not on this DVD. Perhaps Criss will release it on DVD, on his website in the near future...we can only hope.

2. Halloween Special

-Speaks for itself. This was an hour long Halloween special Criss did in 2005. It was aired on TV as part of season 1, yet is NOT on this DVD. Somewhat disappointing, as that episode was actually quite enjoyable.

3. Best of I

-One of the two ""best of Criss Angel"" episodes aired on TV, that is not on this DVD. It showcased outakes, and never before seen clips. Such as a few from the ""Bullet Catch"" episode, with JD.

4. Best of II

-The second of the two ""best of Criss Angel"" episodes aired on TV, that is not on this DVD. Again, it showcased outakes and never before seen clips from the Mindfreaks series.

That's really my only complaint with this compilation of Criss Angel episodes. It's missing an unaired episode, and 3 aired episodes.

Also, the ""bleeps"" you got on the TV, that cut out the cussing...they're STILL HERE! This is also somewhat disappointing, as Criss could have atLEAST given his fans RAW and UNCENSORED episodes. AtLEAST for the DVD collection. Oh well. Perhaps nextime, eh? Knowing A&E...it's highly doubtful.

Anyways, aside from those flaws (the bleeps still being here/the missing and unaired episodes), the season 1 DVD is awesome! It contains every single other season 1 episode, exactly as seen on TV! Only now, you can watch them anytime you like, instead of having to wait for Wednesday nights.

I give this product 4/5 stars, for it's 2 flaws.

So if you're planning on buying this just to see the ""Bullet Catch"" episode with JD in it, you might want to skip this. Because that episode (along with 3 others) is not on this DVD.

And if you're thinking of buying this DVD, because you're thinking it'll be unedited and uncensored, again, you might want to skip this. Because the bleeps still exist.

But if you're a fan of Criss Angel, and simply want to own (most of) season 1, AS SEEN ON TV, then by all means, purchase this DVD set! You will NOT be disappointed!",1150848000,9,2859,4.538011695906433
2409730,5,B000BB152A,"I found out about Criss Angel late in its first season. Several friends were telling us about some of his feats and I had to tune in - This sexy Greek guy has it all - he is daring, very sexy (did I mention he was sexy?) and a master illusionist. A friend of mine is learning to be a magician in Vegas and he told me how cool Criss is -- May have to take a trip back to Vegas to see him in person. He peeks the imagination and the illusions are flawless. Houdini would be very proud -",1150243200,6,484,3.801980198019802

Why does it not have all the epsides it kinda made me a little upset that i didn't get ALL of season one.

So sorry that I missed this first season, A&E was not a station I frequented that time of night...BUT when I found the complete season for sale, believe me I jumped on it.  Criss Angel is not only HAWT, but he is so very talented! Illusionist on a well planned stage can hide cables and whatever it takes to do thier illusions,but Criss does his on the street and with ordinary people. He works hard to show you that there is no camera tricks, no cables, no hoky poky involved...He does some awesomely amazing things that will freak you OUT! Not called MindFreak for nothing!

2409734,1,B000BB152A,"Many magicians know that Angel is a fake.  Originally, he wanted to have his band get a record deal, so his parents financed his hobby.  In fact, they took out a mortgage to buy him illusions after he saw Arioch (The FIRST Hard Rock Illusionist) on MTV with Skid Row and Motley Crue.  He used to tell club owners in New York that he was just using magic as a gimmick to get his band signed.  Apparently, his mommy will give her boy as much money as he wants to buy toys, and he steals from magicians who actually work for what they have. after David Blaine made it big, Angel claimed to be the greatest street magician.  Lance Burton used a robot illusion, a few months later, Angel had one.  Simon Drake used assistants in cool outfits, Angel copied that.  Anyone can buy TV time and illusions, but they will never be able to buy talent.  If Angel didn't have so many paid stooges and rich parents, he would still be trying to get his band signed.  Hopefully he will get signed, and leave magic to the magicians.  FORBES magazine wrote that he screwed up an escape and had to scream for his crew to let him out.  How lame can you get?  Copperfield, Blaine, Burton, Arioch, and others have no competition with this clown.",1140566400,12,1221,4.353982300884955
2409735,4,B000BB152A,"At first when I saw Mindfreak on A&E I thought Criss Angel was the real deal. When I say real deal I mean a REAL magician. His levitation and building walk gigs totally got me. I thought for weeks trying to figure out how any human would be able to defy gravity to that extent. After, convinced he's the ""real deal"" I purchased his Mindfreak DVD and watched all the episodes. (I was disappointed to find that the ""bullet catch"" was not on it). Regardless, almost all the episodes are on it. OK, now this is where the BUT comes in. After you watch magic over and over again, you start to see things that you didn't see the first time. When Criss always says, ""one continuous shot, don't cut"" all he's doing IS cutting in the editing room. Criss writes, produces, and directs the entire series. So after I signed on to his website, and saw that he was actually selling the secret of levitation for $100 on DVD! Without hesitating i purchased it, and once the DVD arrived and I popped it in, I couldn't help but laugh my butt off! Very cheazy, but it does give the illusion. And if you think you'll be able to float 5 - 10 feet, don't get your hopes up like I did. All he teaches you is how to float a foot at most and its extremely angle sensitive, meaning your spectator(s) have to be right behind you. Not what I was hoping for at all. I also purchased the ""Quarter through soda can"" trick for $30 and that was 100% worth it. Fantastic illusion. I have fooled a lot of people with that one. Criss, if your reading this reveal your 5-10 foot levitations without shoes!!! Or how bout the building walk!?! If you put either of those on the market for $1000 (one thousand) then you got a deal, lol. Now that's one that still boggles my mind, if of course he's being honest and there are no special strings etc. Hard to trust a magician, lol. I wonder why you open the umbrella while turning. At one point I was so obsessed that he's real, that I attended his DVD signing at Virgin Megastore in Hollywood. After 3 hours of waiting it was finally mine and my friends turn. He was very nice and all, but when I asked him to do something with a quarter, all he did was a slide of hand my grandmother can do! There are a lot of more bloopers that are hard to spot on the Mindfreak DVD that I don't want to mention, because it'll take too long, but with these last words... Criss Angel is a master illusionist, not a magician. I give him 8 out of 10. And with all said, can't wait for season two!",1140048000,10,2486,4.202928870292887
2409736,4,B000BB152A,"OK.  Here is, what may be, the only true review of the DVD set released by A&E Entertainment, and not a debate over who is your favorite Magician.  This collection will be enjoyable to any Criss Angel fan or Magic enthusiast, so get it and grab the popcorn.  But first, there are a couple of things you need to know.  It is amazing that the Title is, ""The Complete Season One"", considering that 4 episodes are missing from the set. (1) The ""Bullet Catch"" episode that was ready for broadcast but banned by the network and never aired, (2) the one-hour 10/31 ""Halloween"" episode, (3) ""The Best of Criss Angel"" with scenes edited out from previous episodes, and (4) ""The Best of Criss Angel Vol. II"".  I am happy that A&E released the collection, and would be glad if they released more of their programming on DVD, but remain dumb-founded that they would forget 4 episodes and then title the collection what they did.",1137974400,22,916,4.560975609756097
2409737,5,B000BB152A,"I've been a magic fan since i was a very young boy and my family and I used to attend the annual, worlds largest magic convention in Colon, Michigan, home to the Abbotts magic factory and Harry Blackstone.  Angel is one of the new breed of magicians/illusionists who have said forget the stage and the beautiful assistant in skimpy outfits and who has taken his act to the street to perform tricks both mind-boggling and dangerous.  One has to question the sanity of a guy who sets himself ablaze on his mother's birthday but that's just what Criss does.

His feats of sleight of hand and illusion make for great TV.  Is it all camera tricks?  Are all the people paid shills and plants there to oooohhh and ahhhh?  I don't know and it really doesn't matter to me.  Seein him levitate himself three feet in the air onto a chair in front of a casino lounge full of guests is pretty damn amazing no matter how its done.  What makes Angel so intriguiing to me is his showmanship.  The greatest magicians are those that have showmanship and flair.  Even the greatest tricks can be dull in the hands of a bland performer.  Angel is anything but bland displaying a likeability that anyone who encounters him certainly feels.  The greatest trick isn't always how the magician pulls off his feats but rather how he manages to fool the audience.

Great stuff!",1135814400,6,1349,4.547717842323651

2409739,5,B000BB152A,"David Blaine and Criss Angel are the forefront of magic in the new century. Why?  Gone are the parlor tricks we've become so accustom to, and now we have magic that will make watch in wonder... how did they do that?  Tricks on the street, with common observers. Tricks that not only take illusion, slight of hand and craftsmanship, but also take MENTAL TOUGHNESS and PREPAREDNESS.

Some of the more dazzling things that Criss Angel does in season one will leave you awe-struck. Like when he walks DOWN THE SIDE OF A VEGAS BUILDING... or WALKS THROUGH A GLASS WINDOW. Even the little things... like levitating a frisbee that had landed on the ground, spinning it up to eye level and throwing it to an observer without ever toughing it. Or don't let me forget when he walks up to some random people in a park, puts a young girl into a trace, bends her BACKWARD at a 90 degree angle and then LEVITATES HER ENTIRELY.

Of course there's the time when he levitates HIMSELF. I'm not talking a few inches off the ground like David Blaine did previously. I'm talking feet. Three feet. Four Feet. High enough to lift himself over a good sized dog. Not taking anything away from the equally incredibly David Blaine, but a nearby observer spoke the SAYS IT ALL COMMENT, ""Blaine needs to kiss this guys ass.""

I don't know about that... Criss still hasn't done anything close to the most amazing trick that David Blaine did. Removing a wrist watch from a woman... walking a few feet down the street to a jewelry store where the woman's watch was displayed in the window... and being after hours, the store was closed, so he put his hand and arm through the glass right before our eyes and retrieves the watch.  Or creating water, wearing a sleeveless shirt with a single leaf for a jungle tribe that had no running water.

Okay, okay... back to Criss Angel. The show is incredible. I watch it religiously. One of the things I find enduring about the show is the fact that Criss' brothers are part of his crew and it's kinda cool to see them worry about him when he does his tricks... even though... sometimes it looks sorta staged.

Also, the fact that he includes other magicians in his show, like Lance Burton, Penn & Teller & the Amazing Johnathan. I'm just waiting for the 2 part episode where him and David Blaine team up... dear lord... wouldn't that be great!

If anybody out there is complaining about Criss Angel and the validitiy of his tricks... I'd like to see the magicians that they're watching because I can't imagine that magic could get much better.",1135641600,27,2553,4.544662309368192
