1236252,5,B00000JPGC,"John Wayne tells (told) it like it was. For those of us who had first hand knowledge of this subject can not help but give this video a big 5 stars. You may not agree with everything John Wayne did or stood for but at least he had the guts to put his career on the line for what he thought important. How many of the Hollywood crowd stood up for those of us in uniform during these trying times.
Watch & listen carefully and you will see who John Wayne really was.",1082160000,25,464,4.0
1236253,4,B00000JPGC,"This video is a fascinating time capsule, with The DUKE front and center.
A slanted, hard-right view of where we stood in Vietnam in 1970, and what should be done to win, this film is more heavily in favor of all-out war than a flock of hawks.
DUKE hosts a strange look at the history of Communism as the film seeks to explain why we were in Vietnam, why we were not winning, and why we should continue the war at all costs, in this failed attempt to turn public opinion.
The film itself is an odd mixture of stiff, 50s-60s style documentaries, far-right flag-waving propaganda, while similar in visual style and pacing to 1970's pseudo-science documentaries like ""The Amazing World of Psychic Phenomena"" or ""The Jupiter Menace"". Also interesting to note are the old ""noose-style"" microphones on DUKE and the interviewees, which further dates the film.
The 70 minute film is full of many interesting (although highly biased), interviews, including cameos by newsman Lowell Thomas, USO personality Martha Raye, and famous singing soldier Barry Sadler (of ""Ballad of the Green Berets"" fame).
An attempt at a documentary-style polictical pursuasion film, the propaganda value in ""No Substitute for Victory"" is pretty high. The film manages to raise the spectre of the 1950's Red Scare quite effectively for 1970. I would imagine many of the older folks who watched this at the time were in complete agreement with DUKE and the other interviewees after they saw this.
Most telling is that, other than the two or three who were in the military, there are no young people interviewed. The majority of the ""cast"" depicted are well over forty (some peaceniks in full hippie regalia are shown, however). This makes the film a great subject for study in Political Science, History, or Communication courses, not only because it is so heavy-handed in propaganda, but because the film unintentionally highlights the great divide that existed between the gererations of the day.
On the other hand, some of the hard-right fears were realized. Politicians did interfere in our ability to wage the Vietnam War. There was an almost constant waste of the lives of American soldiers and demoralization of the troops because of it. Simply leaving Vietnam did not bring an instant peace, and once the U.S. pulled out, there were massacres throughout the region. Our prestige on the world stage did suffer, and the feeling of defeat did permeate America for years.
However the film, for all its documentation of facts (real or imagined), comes off as rather naive in the idea that we could have won simply by dropping more bombs. DUKE was known as a hawk on the Vietnam war, and like most hawks probably did not understand why this war was different in nature than World War 2. His frustration over the events of the day is evident throughout the course of the film.
Still, the film is pretty honest, at least from the perspective of the far right. While pushing for an expansion of the war effort, the film honestly portrays the reasons why the hawks felt we should do so, and what we had done wrong in waging the conflict up to that point. Given the prestige of some of the commanders and soldiers interviewed, this comes off as more than Monday-morning quarterbacking, even when viewed through the lens of thirty-plus years of history.
The quality of the transfer is not too bad, but not as crisp as it could be, hence my four-star instead of five-star rating. It was transferred in SP, so the production people get points for that.
An intersting product of the time in which it was made, ""No Substitute For Victory"" is a relatively inexpensive historical text of political sentiments in 1970. It should not be missed by anyone interested in the era or the Vietnam War.",995328000,31,3750,4.824534161490683

The south vietnamese people despised the Strategic Hamlet program, so then they setup VC ambushes for our own guys in response. And besides, its their own GVN that was supposed to do these reforms for themselves anyways. Years went by and it NEVER HAPPENED.
This video is good for examining why that misguided war needed to be ended by MASSIVE protest. Because you could have produced this sort of pro-war viewpoint easily enough ONLY without asking most of the soldiers themselves about its conduct.

7913038,3,B00000JPGC,"For those old enough to remember, no matter which side of the issue you were on during America's Vietnam decade, the Hawks and Doves all had legitimate points to make about the conduct of this war and our country's presence in Indochina. John Wayne and an impressive group of authorities make a strong pro-war case in NO SUBSTITUTE FOR VICTORY (1970) that's based on the series of 20th Century events which culminated in the sending of U.S. personnel to Vietnam, first as advisors and then an active military force. They also present evidence that our government was unwilling to commit to total victory.

The all-important (and controversial) Tonkin Gulf incident that provided LBJ a basis for dispatching troops to South Vietnam is mentioned but not explored in depth. Regardless, years of guerilla attacks in the south perpetrated by Ho Chi Mihn's forces upon villagers, police and individual members of local governments needed to be addressed. The debate will always be whether Americans had to take up this burden. If you accept the premise in JFK's 1961 inaugural ""...that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe..."" then the answer is yes.

Things get heavy when Duke berates anti-war protesters who ""burn the American flag, stamp it into the ground while waving the flag of the Viet Cong..."" He labels them ""members of the enemy's forces."" In hindsight, such inflammatory language may have caused the concerned youth this film was in part addressing to tune out its entire message.

This mostly temperate and well presented 73 minute argument for a vigorous prosecution of the war is outstanding in its use of now rare film clips, plus the comments and reminiscences of newsman Lowell Thomas, Gen. Mark Clark, Gen. Albert Weidermeyer, Gen. Paul Harkins, Sgt. Barry Sadler, Adm. U.S. Grant Sharp, Wayne himself and others. Sharp's strategic analysis of a military hamstrung by government policy rings true, yet with both Red China and the USSR interested in the struggle's outcome, was victory in Vietnam ever really possible? We'll of course never know.

Recommended for all interested in American mid-20th Century political and/or military history.",1396915200,2,2213,5.121883656509695
