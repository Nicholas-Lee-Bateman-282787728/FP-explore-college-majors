8025836,5,B0002BPE80,"Love this film! I was working as a magician's assistant 10 years ago at the time someone gave this to me. The practice scenes were pretty spot on and very funny. Soundtrack music is quirky (as is this entire film). Alan Arkin is wonderful. Opening credits are a joy to watch with really fun miniature set scenes. I have it on VHS, want to buy a DVD, but seller wants $80!!!!!!! I will continue to search for this somewhere else. It has the appeal of a romantic comedy, a buddy flick, an on-the-road story mixed with self discovery, with a dash of, well...magic!",1369872000,,561,4.456310679611651

8025838,5,B0002BPE80,"This film is a gem.  It is true that the DVD has no chapters etc - that is the only format in which it is/was offered. It is not a bootleg.

You must watch it from beginning all the way to the end to get the ""message"". It's about creating family bonds - even with strangers; about believing in oneself and others -despite some evidence to the contrary; and about learning to accept oneself, and one's natural talents, and finding the faith to make the most of them. AND it's about learning how to create a shared reality - even within a roomful of strangers.

It's also hysterically funny.

I can't recommend it enough.

That said, when I gave it to my 70-yr-old parents a few years ago, they said they didn't understand it! (But then, my mother's take on Pleasantville was, ""Wasn't that a nice time back then....?""  !!!!!)",1338163200,3,823,4.453333333333333
8025839,4,B0002BPE80,"an entertaining little movie, especially if you like Til Schweiger, who, I am told, is the German Brad Pitt.  I can't say I would have come to that conclusion on my my own.  I did work on this film -  I decided to buy a copy because I realized that my contract provided for my name on the DVD case.  That's pretty rare, so I ordered a copy.  It's there.  This alone is probably not enough reason to buy the film, but it's fun, and you get to see some decent B actors in rather strange roles.  And it's a must if you're a fan of James Merendino, the director.",1327363200,,558,4.0181818181818185
8025840,2,B0002BPE80,"I got a copy of a dvd, not even the real dvd, no menu, no fast forward chapters. It's essentially a bootleg which is illegal to sell and I will be contacting amazon about this. The movie however is a great film. Find it somewhere else.",1269734400,5,235,4.130434782608695
