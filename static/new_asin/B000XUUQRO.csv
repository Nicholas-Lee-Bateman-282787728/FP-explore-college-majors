3009652,5,B000XUUQRO,"Like the other reviewer, I too was skeptical, but for different reasons.  I've seen ASSSCAT before and it's always been great, but I didn't know how well it would translate to video.  That plus I'm more familiar with the New York crew and this ASSSSCAT show was filmed in Los Angeles.  By the end of the DVD, though, any doubts I had were quashed.  This is brilliant.  Prepare to have the phrase ""toilet scissors"" enter your lexicon, the scene it appears in is one of the funniest things I have ever seen, read, or heard.  I highly recommend this for fans of the UCB, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, late '80s/early '90s SNL, and so on.

Enter ASSSSCAT.

If you are a fan of the type of humor found on the regular seasons of Upright, you will love ASSSSCAT. I watched this with my skeptical girlfriend, and we were both rolling with laughter for two straight hours.

So, to start, I think it is important to stress that this is improvisational comedy. Nothing is written beforehand, it is all made up on the spot and inspired by suggestions from the audience. If after reading this review, and then buying and watching this video and then hearing the people on your TV say that it is all made up on the spot you feel like the writing is poor, you need to return you TV, Quit your job, and give up on life because you are way too dumb to be a part of society. If you liked Who's Line Is It Anyway?, or have seen the Groundlings, or UCB or been to SAK in Orlando then you know what improv is. Its funny, vulgar and great.

3009688,5,B000XUUQRO,"One of the things on the DVD is an interview with the four members of the UCB from the Comedy Central series, in which they talk about, in part, the origin of the name ASSSSCAT!.  Basically the name came about because the show they were doing was failing and was painful for both the improvisers and the audience.  This DVD, however, is so funny from start to finish.  Off the wall scenes, touching scenes, even a psychic moose.  It's got it all.  Also, if you are an improv nerd like me, the DVD is a must own for the commentary track on the main feature alone.  They go through scene by scene and discuss the ""rules"" of improv and how they are following them or breaking them, as well as how and why they made the connections they did.

This really is a great DVD to own if you enjoy improv.  Not quite the same experience as seeing it live, but as close as you can get from the comfort of your couch.  Sooo good",1330905600,2,914,4.177142857142857
3009689,4,B000XUUQRO,"I was a big fan of the Upright Citizen's Brigade show when it was on Comedy Central (speaking of which - come on CC, release the third season on DVD already!), so when I stumbled upon ASSSSCAT and discovered there's a UCB disc that I hadn't seen yet, it was like my birthday and Christmas rolled into one.  I ordered it immediately and watched it as soon as it arrived, and I wasn't disappointed.

For those who are wondering if ASSSSCAT is similar to the UCB TV show, the answer is no.  While the show was basically deranged sketch comedy similar to, say, an American version of Monty Python, this DVD is a live improv show.  The four main UCB members from the CC show are joined by a handful of other improvisors, and they make up skits on the spot inspired by stories told by a guest monologist, who's story is in turn inspired by random phrases shouted by the audience.

The main program on the disc is about an hour's worth of one live show - it's edited a bit, but gives the impression of being a complete show.  There are also a bunch of bonus features which probably make up at least another hour of highlights from other shows.  My favorite bit is the bonus clip of the audience member who gets so drunk that he staggers backstage and completely disrupts the show.  It's amazing how well they handle the situation and turn it into part of the show.

I find it odd though that some of the other reviews really praised the commentary tracks - I thought most of what they said was really obvious just from watching the performance.  They describe improv comedy like it's as difficult as brain surgery.  I'm sure it's not easy to get up on a stage with nothing prepared and try to make people laugh, but it's probably not the rocket science they make it out to be.

The bottom line is that for fans of the UCB Comedy Central show, or just edgey comedy in general, this DVD is a must have.  The performances are like 10 Marti Gras, even if the commentary is like Hitler's birthday.",1330732800,,1985,4.361413043478261
3009690,5,B000XUUQRO,"Asssscat! is a show done by the Improv group UCB, or Upright Citizens Brigade, in both New York and Los Angeles. UCB is important because it is one of the most successful groups to exist outside Chicago. It is great to see that the original members of UCB, Matt Besser, Amy Poehler, Ian Roberts, and Matt Walsh, playing along side other great improviser. The format is basically an Armando, with a special guest monologist that tells a story that inspires the scenes done by the actors.
Let's start with this first. I have been an Improviser since 2001. I have always had an issue with Improv that has been recorded and edited. The real ""magic"" of Improv is seeing it live. If you never seen a live show, go see one. There are Imporv groups in almost every town. Okay, my rant is over, moving onto Assscat!
It is fun to watch because over 3/4th of it is ""funny"". That is a high ratio for Improv. One of the joys of Improv is that sometimes scene and things don't work. It happens. The people in it are doing a great job of playing the game in the scene and exploring the worlds they have created. As far as Improv skills go, these guys are close to being scary good.
This is a great show to watch if you want to learn Improv. I often recommend it to students. The extras that come on the DVD are amazing, like cast commentary and an interview with the four founders. I am happy with it in my collection and I watch it at least once a month. Sometimes I even take notes.",1328400000,,1469,4.268817204301075

Oh, I suppose it's okay for improv (and the various actors seems to be enjoying themselves immensely), but it really pales in comparison to their scripted material.  Sometimes an editorial eye can be really useful.

If you're new to the Upright Citizens Brigade, spend your money on the DVDs of the Comedy Central show.  If you're already a fan, just don't get your hopes too high.",1219622400,4,507,4.651685393258427

3009693,5,B000XUUQRO,"If you have seen long form improv comedy before and know what to expect, ASSSCAT! is an incredible show.  If you haven't and you're willing to give long form improv a fair shot, this is the best place to start; it's the funniest improv show I've ever seen.  Matt Besser, Amy Poelher, and Sans are all involved.  Need I say more?  Poehler, by the way, never stuck out for me on SNL, on ASSSCAT! she's the sole woman performer-- and she's darn funny.  For the curious, ASSSSCAT! features a guest monologist [Will Arnett and Kate Walsh among the more famous ones], whose story is then followed by a bunch of scenes.  It's great improv, it's funny, and even your friends who like extremely mainstream comedy should be able to enjoy it.

If you are an improviser, if you teach improv, or if you are even vaguely interested in the techniques that are used in improvisation, order this DVD one-day shipping.  Amazing.  While there are interviews with the cast members, they're basically filled with only somewhat interesting stories and the answer to the question you'll soon be asking ""why ASSSSCAT!?""

The guys lament that they can't be funny, but what you get is far better: people who are hilarious explaining why they're hilarious. Absolutely must-have.

If you are taking an improv class, then this is a great DVD to have; so that you can watch a seasoned ,and talented ensemble doing their thing. I don't want to be a spoiling-jerk, but you can watch Asssscat on Youtube for free. I bought this DVD because I'm old-school. Firstly this DVD is, much more than, worth the few dollars that it costs; I feel that buying it is my duty, as a fellow artist, to pay a group of artists for their highly, worth-while act. Secondly I like to lay in bed and watch it on my TV. verses on the computer. That may have something to do with the fact that I have a desk-top computer, and sitting in a chair, watching the act, when you are tired,at night, is less than ideal. So anyway, well worth it to own, fantastic improv!!",1490572800,,858,4.206060606060606
