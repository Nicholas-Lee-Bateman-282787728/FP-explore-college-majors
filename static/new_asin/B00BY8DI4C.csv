8575483,3,B00BY8DI4C,"Internet Movie Data Base has more in depth reviews of the plot so my purpose here is to share with you why I purchased the movie.  I first saw this movie in a theater when I was seven years old.  I don't remember much of the movie.  I re-discovered the movie by a Google search and then confirmed this movie on IDBM.  There are many recognizable actors (if you're, perhaps, over 50) in a low-budget, low-tech film.  One scene from memory seemed like it had a the two boys/bears next to the corner of a yellow wall (making it a color movie) but it's totally black & white.  That's what prompted me to purchase,  I recognized the one scene from so long ago during the movie viewing this weekend.  There are so many scenes in the movie that don't seem believable, no so much the obvious one of boys turning into bears, but the interaction with parents to their children and poor script writing to try to show you behaviors in scenes is how people interact with each other. It really didn't spew a bunch of memories but it's now something I can cross of my bucket list.",1401667200,,1065,4.343434343434343
8575484,5,B00BY8DI4C,I remember seeing this cute family film when I was a kid and had been looking for it on VHS through the Eighties and Nineties but now I have the DVD and am very satisfied.  A cool chance to see Brenda Lee at the height of her late 50s/early 60s popularity!,1369872000,4,256,4.019607843137255
