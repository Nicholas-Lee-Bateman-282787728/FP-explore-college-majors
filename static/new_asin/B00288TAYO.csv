8355910,5,B00288TAYO,"It might sound exotic, but if you have the courage, the Japanese division of Amazon (http://amazon.co.jp) offers Visconti's ""Vaghe Stelle dell'Orsa..."" (the original title, which means ""the bright stars of (Great) Bear"") with Italian dialogue supplied with fixed Japanese subtitles. In return the movie is presented in the original widescreen ratio (16:9 anamorphic). I strongly recommend the spectator to buy both the European (PAL Region 2) DVD offered on this site - with English subtitles - and combine it with the Japanese (NTSC region 2) DVD. This japanese edition (legally released by Kinokuniya Company Ltd, 2003), is not dubbed in japanese, don't worry for that.

Of course, it helps if you can understand a little Italian - ""non lo so"" and so further. Japanese should not be a problem when ordering, since Latin alphabet to some extend is accepted. Just log in with the usual password and pay the price. Unfortunately I cannot in this forum write a direct URL adress, since amazon.com does not accept japanese letters. But obviously your computer will do. Do not hesitate - even talkies like this - in the end - are moving images (in both senses). And the dialogue (apart from the synopsis - or the plot, if you will) is perhaps not the main issue. The underlining piano score (by the classical-romantic francophone Belgian composer Csar Franck) acknowledges no language barriers, and plays, so to say, a much stronger voice than the spoken voices by by the antagonists. After all, it is a Visconti pic, by the humle opinon of mine this director's ""hidden"" masterpiece.

I must add that this black and white movie is very very beautiful. But only the widescreen format manage to do it justice, at least what concerns the cinematographic virtues. Perhaps Mr Martin Scorcese should write to Sony Home Entertainment concerning the cropped format? At least for an upcoming blu-ray release!",1380412800,,1895,5.031847133757962

8355912,4,B00288TAYO,"Of course 1 star must taken away for the pan/scan format, and I have no idea why Sony chose this format for this fine film.  Still, this edition seems to be the only way to see ""Sandra,"" so I am grateful that it exists.  And the print is sharp and remastered, with English or Italian audio and subtitle options.  The full screen format does not ruin the film as other people say...",1307232000,4,381,4.263888888888889
8355913,1,B00288TAYO,"I perfectly agree with Mr. F. Lozzi, in some frames unless to have the three main actors (Cardinale, Sorel and Craig) you only see two actors (one is missing). The loosing of so a big portion of a frame is unacceptable. Reaaly a shame. Much much better the japaneese edition, nont restored but with the correct format 1:1,85. I also wrote to Sony Pictures at the time of the issue of the Dvd in Italy but they never reply to me.",1280102400,7,428,4.296296296296297
8355914,1,B00288TAYO,"5 stars for the actual film, but none for this shameful dvd release. After years of waiting for a legit dvd release of this great film, it was very disappointing to discover that such work of art by one of the all-time masters of film-making was released NOT in its original format (1:1.85) but in the TV format (1:1.33), which meant losing a substantial portion of the frame. It shouldn't happen to any film, certainly not to a beautifully photographed one like this. The recording I have from Italian TV is much better (and respectful of its original format). It's an insult to all film lovers, don't buy it.
SONY SHAME ON YOU!!!",1269302400,14,631,4.592920353982301
