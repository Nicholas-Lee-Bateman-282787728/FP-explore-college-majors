2922068,5,B000UJ48RC,"Just how good was Oscar winner Burt Lancaster? The man was a hell of an actor. He was remarkable in dramatic films, and in film noir and suspense, and even in comedy. He was so good and heartfelt in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Field-of-Dreams-Widescreen-Two-Disc-Anniversary-Edition/dp/078322611X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Field of Dreams (Widescreen Two-Disc Anniversary Edition)</a>. And, because of his circus background, it's not too surprising that he would show a decided flair for swashbuckling. Which now leads us to one particularly neglected swashbuckler. In 1950, 2 years before the sublime&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crimson-Pirate/dp/B000096IBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crimson Pirate</a>, THE FLAME AND THE ARROW was released, a rollicking adventure film starring Burt and his sidekick and long-time circus buddy Nick Cravat. This one's where they first unleashed their heady brand of athleticism and acrobatics.

The plot? In the twelfth century, northern Italy is suffering under the iron rule of the occupying German forces. But, in the mountains of Lombardy, the fires of rebellion are still being stoked. We are introduced to the dashing, free-spirited Dardo (Burt Lancaster), a savvy huntsman and deadly archer (he's nicknamed ""the Arrow""), whose wife had years before abandoned him for a life of ease and riches with the fearsome Hessian ruler, Count Ulrich, also called ""The Hawk"" (Frank Allenby). When Dardo, showing off for his son, shoots down Count Ulrich's hawk, Ulrich takes Dardo's son in retaliation. This act sets off the events which would ultimately transform Dardo into a leader of a peasant uprising against the Hessian invaders. Along the way, he also takes hostage and romances the beautiful noblewoman Anne de Hesse (Virginia Mayo), who is Ulrich's niece. This, in the midst of several unPC scenes of Dardo chaining up the Lady Anna. With another possible villain, the Marchese Alessandro (Robert Douglas) lurking in the wings, Dardo looks to be up against it. This just might call for a bit of chandelier swinging...

I'm a bit puzzled as to why this film isn't more well known. Yes, it borrows quite a bit from Errol Flynn's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Robin-Hood-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JKEZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Robin Hood (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;even as it holds to its tongue-in-cheek nature. And, true, it doesn't quite equal the polish, exuberance, and irresistible charm of Burt's later, more lauded THE CRIMSON PIRATE. But THE FLAME AND THE ARROW does offer its own share of lighthearted brio, colorful medeival pageantry, and, for its time, stunning action sequences. Perhaps, ultimately, the success of one and the forgetting of the other may simply come down to THE FLAME AND THE ARROW not being a pirate movie.

Burt Lancaster was definitely one of our most physical and agile American actors. He had that masculine magnetism going for him, abetted by his blinding, razzle-dazzle, con man's smile, his unruly shock of hair, and that rugged frame. And he had that bigger than life personality. Without a doubt, and with apologies to the gorgeous Virginia Mayo, Burt is the obvious centerpiece of this film. Your eyeballs can't help but track him as he smiles engagingly, waxes passionate, and performs with zeal his feats of daredeviltry. And, with him, just about step by step, somersault for somersault, and stunt for stunt is his partner Nick Cravat. Yes, they did their own stunts.

I've always been a fan of Nick Cravat, and this from only having seen him prominently in two films. Here, Nick Cravat plays another of his nonspeaking roles in Piccolo, faithful friend of Dardo's. It must be noted that Nick Cravat isn't mute in real life. It's just that he had such a pronounced Brooklyn accent, which he was never able to shake off, that giving him lines in a period piece would've been ruinous for the picure. Anyone recall Tony Curtis's horrid Brooklynese in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Black-Shield-of-Falworth/dp/0783218915/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Black Shield of Falworth</a>&nbsp;(""Yondah lies the castle of my foddah."")? Another trivia about Nick: he played the gremlin on the airplane wing of the classic Twilight Zone episode ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet,"" which starred a crazed William Shatner.

Directed with flourish by Jacques Tourneur, with rousing music composed by the ever dependable Max Steiner, and an Oscar nomination for best cinematography, THE FLAME AND THE ARROW doesn't deserve anonymity. I love swashbucklers. And, while Lancaster hadn't made but a handful in this genre (again, mostly because he was so talented he could and did dip his fingers in many other film genres), I count him as one of my favorite buckler of swashes. I saw THE FLAME AND THE ARROW when I was a kid and, dang, did I enjoy its brand of chest-thumping action and acrobatics. Back then, I was very much bowled over by Burt Lancaster and his swagger. I was never gladder than when I found out THE FLAME AND THE ARROW was finally coming out in dvd. This one's more gritty than THE CRIMSON PIRATE, but there's enough mirth, romance, and derring-do to make this a must get for me. If CRIMSON PIRATE is a five star flick, then this one's just below. Let's call it, four and a half stars.

2922070,4,B000UJ48RC,"A fine show of acrobats! A fable for fun!

Burt Lancaster and Nick Cravat indulge themselves in long leaps and vaults, pirouetting in mid-air, swinging on tapestries and chandeliers, and baffling the tyrant Ulrich with their tricks... Plenty of action!

The film is a flamboyant spoof of the Robin Hood genre, set against the castle battlements and banquet halls of medieval Lombardy... Ideally cast opposite Lancaster's swashbuckling Dardo were Virginia Mayo as the obligatory lady-fair, and Robert Douglas and Frank Allenby as the suavest of villains...

To play his mute sidekick, Piccolo, Lancaster engaged his old friend and circus partner, Nick Cravat. The result was a joyful team... Together they battled spearmen with blazing torches, and leaped around castle balconies...

""The Flame and the Arrow"" is a colorful adventure film with a great closing shot: Lancaster swinging in a series of circular movements on metalwork high above the courtyard of an old castle...

Lancaster's acrobatics boosted his box-office value, and so did another swashbuckler, 'The Crimson Pirate.'",1167436800,2,1084,5.467065868263473

2922114,5,B000UJ48RC,"Warner Bros. Pictures presents ""THE FLAME AND THE ARROW"" (1950) (88 min/Color) -- Starring Burt Lancaster, Virginia Mayo, Robert Douglas & Nick Cravat

Directed by Jacques Tourneur

Twelfth-century Lombardy lies under the iron heel of German overlord Count Ulrich 'The Hawk' (Frank Allenby), but in the mountains, guerrillas yet resist. Five years before our story, Ulrich stole away the pretty wife of young archer Dardo Bartoli (Lancaster) who, cynical rather than embittered, still has little interest in joining the rebels. But this changes when his son, too, is taken from him. The rest is lighthearted swashbuckling, plus romantic interludes with lovely hostage Anne de Hesse (Virginia Mayo).

One of my favorite all time films from my youth, when me and the neighborhood kids would play out every scene on our local street.

Oscar nominated for Best Cinematography, Color (Ernest Haller) and Best Music Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Film (Max Steiner)

Special footnote: -- Nick Cravat, who plays Piccolo, was an acrobat who was teamed with Burt Lancaster before Lancaster became a star. He appears in many of Lancaster's movies. In this one, and in The Crimson Pirate (1952), he plays a mute. The reason was that his thick Brooklyn accent, which he could not lose, would have been completely out of place in such period pieces.  Cravat appeared with Lancaster in nine films

2922115,5,B000UJ48RC,This is Burt Lancaster at his best.  He used to be in the circus as a trapeze performer.  It's sort of a Robin Hood story.  I'm so glad that it finally came out on DVD.  First saw the movie when I was in the Navy in the early fifties...,1293148800,2,236,3.7551020408163267
2922116,2,B000UJ48RC,"I had high hopes for ""The Flame and the Arrow,"" since I'm a fan of Burt Lancaster and director Jacques Tourneur, who made some very atmospheric horror movies. I also quite like Virginia Mayo, for obvious reasons...

But, alas, I didn't end up liking this movie. It's essentially a weak Robin Hood knock-off, with all the trappings of Sherwood Forest but none of the iconic heroes or villains. The plot is the usual ""rise up against the oppressors"" stuff, but there isn't any real depth to the political situations or the characterizations. Even worse, the story is supposed to take place in Italy, but it looks suspiciously like a bunch of old studio sets instead, and many of the characters have ridiculous/condescending names like ""Piccolo"" and ""Bambino.""

Okay, so I know that nobody should expect realism or depth from a fun action movie. But ""The Flame and the Arrow"" is more than just a little silly ... it's also bland. It lacks the star power and sparkle of a film like ""The Adventures of Robin Hood,"" or the wit of Tyrone Power's ""The Mark of Zorro."" Even the action scenes don't work too well; Lancaster's acrobatic tricks may be impressive, but they look more suited to a circus than a swashbuckler movie.

In short, there are many, many better movies out there with similar subject matter. ""The Flame in the Arrow"" may be good for a bit of nostalgic fun, but it isn't actually a good film.",1286150400,2,1401,4.663967611336032

I saw this film on television as a young girl, and have loved it ever since. I introduced my own son to this movie in the early 80's.  He's now 30 plus and it's still one of his favorites.  These older movies have such clever dialogue, such as when one of the villains in this film is described as ""...that jaundiced excretion of a bilious toad's eye!""  That's a line my son memorized well before he was 10 years old and astonished me when he came out with it in the middle of a role playing game years later!

2922121,4,B000UJ48RC,"Burt Lancaster exploded upon the screen in the 1946 film noir THE KILLERS.  For the remainder of the decade film noir was Lancasters' stock in trade with such classics as BRUTE FORCE and SORRY,WRONG NUMBER. In 1950 however, Burt made a sharp left turn when he combined his extraordinary acrobatic ability with this tongue-in-cheek swashbuckler which (literally) vaulted him to new heights.  (Warner Bros. offered a million dollar ""reward"" to anybody who could prove that Lancaster did not do his own stunts.) In this film Burt swashes with the best of them as he plays an Italian peasant who reluctantly leads his people in rebellion against the occupying forces of the Hessions.  Lancaster with his overwhelming charm and that trademark grin puts himself in Errol Flynns' class with this one. However, as good as this film is, it is NOT a great one.  (Lancaster's 1952 film THE CRIMSON PIRATE is a great one and for my money the best swashbuckler ever made.) That said, THE FLAME AND THE ARROW is a pleasant enough diversion for those of us who enjoy an old fashioned tongue-in-cheek adventure film every now and then.

It features Burt Lancaster, with the build of a Greek statue, at his handsomest and sassiest, those pearly whites glistening for the camera, and the beautiful Virgina Mayo, who also comes across as being carved from the finest Carrera marble.

Among the treats are watching the bouncing, athletic Burt go through his circus routine with sidekick/trainer Nick Cravat, with whom he started out early in his career as a trapeze artist.

The plot is lifted straight out of Robin Hood/William Tell legend, but who cares about such trifles when there are such handsome men, beautiful women, not to mention slimy hard-hearted villains, and gorgeous scenery to enjoy?  As can be said of so many great films from the Golden Age, ""they just don't make 'em like this anymore!""

Virginia Mayo is lovely but almost anyone could've played the female lead. Hollywood has done better versions of swashbuckling than this, but not with any other actor gifted as Lancaster, athletically. This is an average movie lifted  a hair above by Lancaster.

1.  The actors:  Burt Lancaster was made for this part and he plays it perfectly.  I love his character and he sells it well.  The supporting cast is awesome, particularly Nick Cravat who plays the mute Piccolo in the movie.  The back story is that Lancaster and Cravat were life long friends going back to grade school.  They did all their own stunts in this movie, which is truly incredible.  Interesting tidbit about Cravat is that he played a mute character because he had such a thick Jersey accent the director just made him mute.

2. The plot:  It's close enough to the best swashbuckling stories of the time like Robin Hood, IvanHoe, etc...to keep you interested, but it's also unique in that the story is told of Italy not England.  It's partly based on a Italian Legend(like Robin Hood).

This is a fantastic example of the adventure genre for the period, and I could watch it over and over.",1521936000,,983,4.554285714285714

8213455,4,B000UJ48RC,"The Flame and the Arrow is a classic Saturday matinee swashbuckler that doesn't try or pretend to be anything else, and as such it's one of the best of its genre. This 1950 technicolor feature rises above B status because of its incisive direction by Jacques Tourneur, a veteran Hollywood genre film maker best remembered for the noir classic Out of the Past and the horror classic Cat People, and also because of the spectacular athletics of an astonishingly youthful Burt Lancaster. There's also an effective sound track by major film composers Max Steiner; Virginia Mayo as the love interest stands around very prettily, which is about all you expect the female love interest in a movie like this to do. It's the sort of film you might have thought was the best movie ever made when you were fifteen years old, and can still enjoy fifty years later.  It's available in various DVD releases; I saw it on the Turner Classics DVD, which was an OK transfer of a rather muddy print; this film should really be remastered and put on Blu-Ray.",1482105600,,1038,4.672131147540983
