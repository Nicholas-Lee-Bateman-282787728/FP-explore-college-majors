8168312,4,6303819540,"My thanks to the previous reviewer for listing the performers, some of  which list I've incorporated in this review.  I just want to comment on the  performances that appeal to me the most.
Don Quixote - Act 1 Kitri's solo  and pas de deux): Maya Plisetskaya, Yuri Kondratov (1954).  This is one of  Plisetskaya's best roles.  I've never seen anyone who can match her bravura  in the first act.
Don Quixote - variation: Mikhail Baryshnikov (1969);  Mikhail Lavrovsky (1974); Irek Mukhamedov (1988).  Where else can you get  back-to-back performances of the same flashy variation by three such great  performers?  My favorite is Lavrovsky--he is very powerful, and has the  most authentic Spanish flavor.  His performance was done in at least two  takes, apparently of two different versions.  This is made obvious by a bit  of bad editing:  at the end of the middle section of the variation, he's  downstage center, obviously preparing to do a tour en l'air, then suddenly  he's upstage right, starting the final section with something completely  different.
Raymonda - pas de dix and variations: Irina Kolpakova,  Vladilen Semenov (1976):  When I first saw the Kirov in the early/mid-60's,  Kolpakova was the reigning prima ballerina.  Excellent!  [Besides her many  appearances as a dancer in videos, Kolpakova is also shown as a coach in  the documentary ""The Leningrad Legend,"" in which Natalia Makarova  returns to the Kirov, her alma mater.  Kolpakova is shown coaching (tearing  into, really) young Veronika Ivanova, now a principal dancer.]
Grand Pas  Classique: Gabriella Komleva, Yuri Soloviev (1974).  This was a great  revelation for me.  Although I remember Komleva's name and pictures in  1960's souvenir programs of the Kirov, I never saw her perform.  From what  I've seen on videos, I really missed something.  She and Kolpakova are of  the generation that predated the slender, pared-to-the-bone dancers who  prevail today.  And I think it is that strong, compact build that enables  Kolpakova and Komleva to be so rock solid, in promenades and balances, for  instance.  Komleva is beautifully formed, from head to toe.  She has a  perfect classical line and amazing strength (in the fiendishly difficult  relevs traveling on the diagonal in her variation, her upper body and arms  aren't disturbed even the least bit).  I might even say that she has too  much aplomb--she stays so calm that she makes it all look too easy.  [Komleva also appears, much later in her career, in an excerpt from Ruslan  and Ludmila in the ""Classic Kirov Performances"" video, still  making it look easy.  And she, too, makes a brief appearance as a coach in  ""The Leningrad Legend.""  She is the one in pink sweatpants who  coaches Galina Mezentseva.]
All in all, this is an excellent sampling of  almost 50 years of Russian ballet.",968716800,18,2829,5.048034934497816
