3474513,5,B001AYMMNS,"I was annoyed when this company cancel the second season of BL Stryker. I had just bought and seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/B-L-Stryker-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0010TDRZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">B.L. Stryker - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;and wanted to finish my collection. I asked friends who had VHS copies. So  i watched the complete second season from their VHS copies.

Now, I know the business of DVD are popular, but to cancel to the second season of a DVD release to put out a complete set is a moot point. From what I read, this complete collection has all the episodes

After viewing the all of the second season episode, i know that this complete collection is as good as the first season..in someways better. The acting is more crisp. Burt is Burt and it shows. The mysteries are good. And Ossie Davis's acting had never been better.

As in the first collection, there are NO EXTRAS, just the episodes uncut and cleaned up.

 So I am buying  it full collection knowing all well and good that this show is good television..now the hard question, who wants my used copy of season one?

3474536,5,B001AYMMNS,"My favorite thing Burt Reynolds ever did . I will probably wear these dvd's out if that's possible . I taped this series when it was part of the Saturday mystery movie in the 80's . Grab them while you can , if you like Burt Reynolds you should love this .",1405555200,,256,3.9423076923076925
3474537,5,B001AYMMNS,"I live in West Palm Beach, so it was fun to watch the show and know the local landmarks in the show. One episode was shot upstairs in the office building where I worked.  It was the FBI with Ned Beatty.  The show probably wasn't confusing to people who didn't live here, but being familiar with the area, I found it confusing.  Most of the filming takes place in the city of West Palm Beach, Jupiter or up in St Lucie County.  I could never figure why the Chief of Police for Palm Beach was always at the scene of crime outside his jurisdiction!  For those who don't live here, they might think Palm Beach is what they saw on TV, but its mostly million dollar homes and estates.  There are no Darth Vader buildings on Palm Beach.  The Darth Vader building is the tall black glass building, where Burt has to go to the roof top, which is along the inter-coastal at the Flagler Bridge on the north end.",1400803200,,900,4.258823529411765
3474538,5,B001AYMMNS,Don't take the show too seriously.  It is just good fun!!  I especially love the scenery and old cars.  The actors seem to be having a great time!,1390867200,,146,4.142857142857143
3474539,2,B001AYMMNS,"After a series of increasingly lower performing and lower quality feature films throughout the 1980s, Burt Reynolds decided to try his luck on network television as part of ABC's revival of the Mystery Movie format. On paper, B.L. Stryker looked solid, a private eye series with a light touch, produced by Burt and Tom Selleck. Doubtless, the two envisioned the series as an offshoot of Selleck's Magnum PI, but, in reality, most of the episodes misfired to one extent or another.

Reynolds starred as B.L. Stryker, a former New Orleans cop turned Palm Beach private investigator, who lived and worked out of a run down houseboat. Ossie Davis co-starred as Burt's only confidante, an ex-boxer who usually got involved in the cases as well. Burt also had a kooky secretary (Dana Kaminsky), a wealthy computer genius neighbor who was the butt of many of Burt's jokes (Alfie Wise), and a wealthy ex-wife (Rita Moreno) who still carried somewhat of a torch for him. Despite the talented actors in these roles, the characters were largely underwritten and underused, a far cry from the well drawn ensemble that supported Tom Selleck on Magnum.

The shows themselves were definitely a mixed bag. Because each episode ran about 95 minutes (to fit, with commercials, in the two-hour mystery movie time slot), the scripts were often quite padded. The crime elements of most of the shows were laughable, with third rate drug dealers, loan sharks, and mob enforcers played by fourth rate actors proving no match for Burt. So, during the parts of the episode in which Burt wasn't playing tough guy, he alternated between playing the snarky Burt, making fun of the cops and the Palm Beach elite, and the sensitive Burt, interacting with Davis and some of the guest stars. The sensitive serious parts of the episodes often worked well, but snarky Burt often proved quite grating, as his putdowns included people like Wise and the local police chief who really deserved better treatment, as well as the Palm Beach elite who needed to be knocked down a peg.

The guest stars on the show were also a mixed bag. Solid vets like Cicely Tyson, Elizabeth Ashley, Paul Gleason (in a rare sympathetic role), and Maureen Stapleton alternated with overpadded roles for Burt's cronies Jerry Reed, Ned Beatty, Dom DeLuise, and girl friend Loni Anderson. The two best episodes of the show were co-written by Robert B. Parker, creator of Spenser, and his wife. In Blues for Buder, Burt befriends a boy (Neil Patrick Harris), who has fallen under the spell of a sleazy televangelist (Michael Chiklis) and become an obnoxious brat who tries to convince everyone he meets they are degenerate sinners. Burt's scenes with Harris are quite touching. Also good, in a completely different way, is High Rise, in which jewel thieves led by Ricardo Montalban and Julianne Moore take Davis and Moreno hostage in a sealed off office building and Burt goes commando to rescue them.

The box set contains all 12 episodes from both seasons of the show. All in all, only one (Buder) is completely satisfying, while a couple (including the DeLuise episode) are painful to sit through. Most of them however feel like good one hour episodes stretched into two mediocre hours of material. Fans of Burt will want to see this, but those hoping for a newer Magnum will be disappointed.",1388793600,,3332,4.892035398230089

3474541,4,B001AYMMNS,"This show has Burt as a former cop now retired living in Florida. The concept is not original but Burt comes through on the character's personality, and it is his presence that keep the show moving. There are not to many slow moments in this series. It is 2 seasons of 90 minute episodes which are more like a collection of movies.
Burt was slowing down a bit when he took on this series he had already done Hawk and Dan August earlier in his career so tv was not unknown to him. The show has some excellent episodes and the pilot is a dark tale done well with Burt and co. Ossie Davis is in every episode and adds some humor and good buddy type exchanges with Burt.
Early in their careers are some(now) well known actors such as Neil Patrick Harris and Micheal Chicklis. Rita Moreno is Burt's ex wife. I wish they used her more as she added a nice lift to the episodes she is in. After this show Burt went on to do Evening Shades.
Good show check it out!",1378252800,,955,4.167567567567567

3474543,5,B001AYMMNS,"Any fan of Burt Reynolds will love this series. It has enough suspense, mystery and intrigue without overwhelming the viewer with an overload of gore and violence. Burt Reynolds is at his best, witty, gritty and funny. The classic Burt Reynolds charm exudes on the screen. I only wish there were more episodes in this series. This is a great deal made even better by the price. You get more for your money then you could ask for. Enjoy this lesser known, but very entertaining series from one of the best actors.",1369267200,2,512,4.576086956521739

3474560,5,B001AYMMNS,"The quality of the DVDs of the entire Burt Reynolds' ABC TV ""Movie of The Week"" 'B.L. STRYKER"" (1988-90) is SUPERB!
The viewing is better than when the series ran on ABC.  Each episode brought back many fond memories of a great
TV series Burt Reynolds excelled in.

I own many of the firearms used in the series, including the S$W Model 36 .38cal revolver
""Stryker"" used.

This DVD set is a MUST-BUY for fans of Burt Reynolds, who lives not far from me,
here in South Florida.

Once you own this DVD set, you'll travel back to a time when life WAS simpler, and Burt and I were a lot YOUNGER!",1280016000,,591,4.25

3474562,4,B001AYMMNS,"Excellent, intrelligent , character driven stories with a good ole boy comedic twist. For those who may not know, Tom Seleck was the exec. producer of this show, and famous mystery writer Robert B. Parker wrote a couple of the movies.",1250208000,,234,4.7317073170731705
3474563,5,B001AYMMNS,"There is always a chance that a Studio can pull the plug on a DVD release at any time and we the fans will always be at their mercy. After purchasing ""B.L. Stryker"" season one on DVD I was completely disappointed that Arts Alliance America pulled the plug on the season two release and offered no reason for their actions.

After learning that the season two set I had on pre-order from Amazon was not going to be available I contacted Arts Alliance America immediately and I was reassured that a complete series DVD set was being produced. I can't tell you how relieved I was to find out that I would have the opportunity to collect the remaining episodes of this great 90's P.I show starring Burt Reynolds.

Burt Reynolds first got his start in television back in 1959 in an episode of ""M Squad"" and after playing numerous characters on TV he finally branched out into movies where he became a leading man in Hollywood and a household name. After a lengthy hiatus from television Burt Reynolds made his triumphant return to TV in 1989-90 with the P.I. series B. L. Stryker. Just like William Shatner in T. J. Hooker, B. L. Stryker would be the vehicle that would resurrect Burt's career in television and he hasn't stopped since.

Former New Orleans detective B.L. Stryker returns to Florida and becomes a private investigator due to some unfortunate circumstances. Now you can join him in all 12 thrilling episodes for the first time ever on DVD. Either the original prints were in excellent condition to begin with or Arts Alliance America did an amazing job of cleaning them up for this DVD release. In my opinion this show has never looked better! The video transfers are crisp and clean and look like they were filmed yesterday. The sound is really good and it sounds great on my sound system. All 12 episodes can be found in this 7 single sided disc set complete with great artwork and packaging from Arts Alliance America. Bonus Features include: Two Original shooting scripts as printable PDF s.
