8701793,1,B00THR9JSG,I was very disappointed in this latest video series. The instructor spends more time talking than demonstrating tactics. What's worse is that the instructor's voice is very monotone and it's difficult to watch the video without falling asleep. Even more disappointing is that the information included in other Crucible videos regarding edge weapon responses is missing from this DVD. There's a section of the video which appeared to be just re-regurgitated from the Kembativ Knife DVD showing angles of attack. I'd recommend staying away from this one though other Crucible DVD's are worth looking at. I would recommend any of Kelly MCcann (AKA Jim Grover) or Lee Morrison's DVD's regarding knife defenses instead. Both are much better instructors and provide far better and more in depth information than this DVD does.,1440288000,,820,5.267175572519084

You can tell instructor was nervous about being on video but did very well.",1427241600,,139,4.833333333333333
