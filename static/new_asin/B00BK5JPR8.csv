If you care at all about the beauty of this opera (as written), you'll RUN from this production. It definitely falls into the category of ""Just because you CAN, doesn't mean you SHOJLD.""",1408492800,5,432,4.558441558441558
8569806,4,B00BK5JPR8,"It is said that it is not only the story Pushkin created, but how he told it that made it such a master work especially beloved by its Russian audiences. The same can be said of Tchaikovskys music. No matter how you stage the opera, the music is a master piece.
Musically, this production is very good. It is refreshing to watch young singers who can not only sing to our expectations, but also act, dance and even jump on stage. The young Israeli conductor does a very good job with the orchestra too.
The stage production is a highly symbolic and minimalistic one. It seems to me too symbolic. It feels like the producer is trying to explain us with his symbols the meaning of the story, although we can appreciated it by the story itself. In fact, I will argue that if this is the first Onegin you ever watch, you will have a harder time understanding the human characteristics of the story compared to a more traditional one.
One aspect of this production I really enjoyed is the camera shots (Photography). No doubt there was a lot of preparation on this subject and it reflects in the way it was filmed. The experience has to be very different for the watcher on a screen than what the live audience would experience.  The shots are very well composed and clear.  The minimalistic approach of the production helps to produce beautiful shots.
I would recommend this Blu-Ray to those who have already watched a traditional production and are familiar with the story and its meaning.",1398816000,7,1486,4.582706766917293
8569807,2,B00BK5JPR8,"Mariusz Trelinski's production is the worst example of the modern ""Regie-opera"" and has no artistic value. I'd definitely give it zero stars (not possible, though) and ask everybody to avoid it like a plague. ""Unfortunately"", there are 2 outstanding performances - Tatiana (Kristine Opolais) and Lensky (Dmitry Korchak) plus excellent orchestra and conductor. So, I have to give it 2 stars.

Most of the modern productions of Onegin are terrible (although this one takes the cake). My recommendation would be the wonderful traditional production from 1980s in the Kirov/Mariinsky Theater. As for the modern productions - the controversial Dmitry Tchernyakov's  Bolshoi Theater production is the only one worth considering.",1392336000,4,722,5.614678899082569
8569808,2,B00BK5JPR8,"this is a simple and beautiful story and does not need all this symbolic stuff.
Eugene Onedin is too skinny and too Dandy and Lenski too good looking.
Tatyana's husband is.dressed like working at a funeral enterprise.
No really;I did not like this performance very much.
No complaint about the music and the voice and acting of Tatyana but the scenery did not allow her to do better.
Impossible to destroy this fantastic music.",1383177600,6,427,4.783783783783784
8569809,5,B00BK5JPR8,"The audio quality of the recording on the Blue Ray disk is very good. The balance between the orchestra and the singers is good and the nuances in the orchestra playing are clearly heard.
Kristine Opolais in the role of Tatanya is excellent, but I was also deeply impressed by Dmitri Korchak in the role of Lensky - and so was the audience, to judge by the ovation he received after his aria at the end of Act II.",1380412800,3,413,4.2405063291139244
8569810,5,B00BK5JPR8,"I must say that my experience of this, most famous of Tchaikovsky's operas, has been somewhat of a disappointment, my first DVD is from the Bolshoi production of 2000, and while it is traditionally staged and fairly well sung, the sound quality is a real let down, muffled in places apart from the coughs, sneezes and audible sirens from outside the theatre. My second was the recent production from Amsterdam, good performance and recorded sound, it was the production that let this one down, I just couldn't get past the cosmonauts! This new DVD, I am glad to say, treads the middle ground between traditional and modern productions, quite minimal at times but nothing to offend, it is well sung and recorded too!
This is a relatively young cast which performs beyond their reputations, with Kristine Opolais being the star of the show. Opolais not only proves that she has a beautiful singing voice, but that she is a consummate actor as well, Tatyana is a difficult role to pull off, but she proves she has the measure of it. My only disappointment was with Artur Rucinski in the title role, at times I found his tone a little harsh while on occasion his acting was a bit wooden, but there were time when he proves that he can both sing and act! The rest of the cast was well balanced with all being in good voice, as was the chorus and orchestra.
I enjoyed this production greatly, there is a lot here which is attractive, and I am glad to say that the director, Mariusz Trelinski does not take any liberties. It is well staged and well televised, with the young conductor controlling his forces well. I would say that the DVD presentation was lacking a little, there are no extras, so no `cast gallery', `illustrated synopses or interview with the director where he explains his vision for the opera. The enclosed booklet leaves a lot to desire as well, with a fourteen line written synopsis being insufficient, even when you know the work, but then you are buying the DVD primarily for the opera and not the extras and booklet!
So, apart from my slight gripes about Rucinski, this is a very fine production and one I have no real qualms in recommending!",1375056000,7,2160,4.612987012987013
8569811,5,B00BK5JPR8,"I must confess I bought this despite having several Onegins,  because of my favorite present day singing actress.  She is Kristine Opalais who is well on her way to superstardom. She did not disappoint me.  She sang and acted beautifully, going from the innocent young dreamer to the elegant Princess Gremin.  The Lensky was very lyrical reminding me of Lemenshev in his sweet singing.  The Olga was very pretty and an excellent Mezzo.  The Nurse and Madame Larina were good as well.  I found Onegin to be somewhat less imposing in voice and somewhat menacing in his acting.  The production was rather surrealistic, but at least brought out the story line. So many productions from Europe either distort or ignore the story altogether.  I was disconcerted by the presence of body mikes.  I hope the Valencia acoustics do not require them.  I spotted them also in the Valencia Ring.",1374451200,5,881,4.845637583892618
