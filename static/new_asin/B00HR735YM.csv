8634715,1,B00HR735YM,"This movie is cringe inducing. I wanted to enjoy it, and literally wasted 60+ minutes of my life. The storyline was weak and predicable and the acting was overly dramatized and almost laughable at times. I watched it on Netflix, but there has to be a way I can be compensated for the time I lost watching this =(",1452988800,,312,4.305084745762712

8634718,5,B00HR735YM,This movie exceeded my expectation.  Actor Tyrin Turner plays a devoted husband who is cheating on his wife with her bestfriend.  A little comedy with the in-laws constantly using their key to come into their apartment.  When the love affair is found out all mayhem.,1405900800,,266,4.866666666666666
8634719,2,B00HR735YM,I don't like giving 1 star because they are trying to be better actors. This story was just stupid... But them again men do stupid things and maybe that's what they wanted to point out. Yes it was predictable,1403395200,,208,4.358974358974359
8634720,3,B00HR735YM,"As a black man who tells his 3 grown sons he will kick their take if the step out on their wife.. This tale written by the stereo typed black man mentality I am ""thinking"" seem to still support the warped mind set that a man can step out on his woman and by her being pregnant forgives his ways..... I really don't support that thought... But anyone out there.. What do you think..??",1396828800,3,383,4.1891891891891895
