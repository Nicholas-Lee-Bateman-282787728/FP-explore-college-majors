7866875,4,6304189508,My almost two year old grandson loves this tape. I had gotten the Chucklewood Critters tapes for my grand daughter when she was small (she is now a young teen) and she loved them so thought we would try them with this little one. The Chucklewood Critters tapes don't involved alot of violence or really scary parts that would upset a little one and they also teach and tell life lessons. Here it is April and we still have to play this tape over and over again for him. It is a real must buy if you want a nice entertaining holiday tape for your 2-10 year olds.,987033600,,561,4.203703703703703
