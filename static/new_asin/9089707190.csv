For a moment the ocean sound didn't seem right, until I realized I hadn't heard it for some time and that's what it really sounds like. At one point the wind started howling, until I realized it was my exercise bike. I had been enjoying the scenery so much I forgot that I was cycling along with it.

There was one point where the right and left sides of the screen jiggled a little. That didn't bother me. In fact, it made me feel as if I actually was jogging. If you are a person who demands technical perfection, that might bother you.

The beaches in Virtual Walks 1, 2, and 3 were sometimes the same, which was confusing, but not enough to distract from the experience. I was actually glad that they didn't put distracting labels with the location each time it changed. This is better. I would like to have more information about the length of each walk.

All-in-all, this is a beautiful virtual beach walk/run/jog experience. I recommend it. Relaxing? It could be, but in my case my exercise equipment challenged me so that it was invigorating, not particularly relaxing. If I watched it while reading, it would be very relaxing. The viewer gets to choose.",1382832000,2,1336,4.581589958158996

The first two walks are perfect, however the third walk was very poorly made....very shaky and blurry, it actually made me dizzy, which is a shame because the scenery would have been the loveliest of all three walks on the DVD",1500595200,,282,4.549019607843137

7901545,2,9089707190,I like this video.  You can almost feel the water washing over your feet at times.  The colors of the water in the sunset video were beautiful.  This makes my walk on my treadmill go by so much faster.,1469232000,,201,4.102564102564102

7901549,4,9089707190,"If you like virtual walking on beautiful beaches on a sunny day with no people around, this DVD is for you. Similar to Virtual Walks-Paradise Beaches, this is shot in HD with different beaches than seen in the Paradise Beaches DVD and looks even more stunning.

Of course with most of Tony Helsloot DVD's, this is not without some minor flaws. The second Walk on this disc is mostly on a hazy sky day which should have been shot on a sunny day. Also for the first four minutes on Walk 3, it seemed shot without a camera stabilizer and you can see the tree's on the right jiggle, though after that, the rest of the walk is OK.

Still, this DVD is well worth the money along with Paradise Beaches.",1423267200,,695,4.297709923664122
7901550,3,9089707190,Like my three star review shows its okay. I guess I was expecting something else.,1416614400,,81,4.466666666666667

treadmill watching this DVD",1397088000,,137,4.111111111111111
7901552,5,9089707190,Love to walk on the beach even when it is a cold snowy day! The blue sky and sandy beach is great love the sounds of the surf and birds. Would love to see more sunrise and sunset walks.,1385769600,2,185,3.769230769230769
