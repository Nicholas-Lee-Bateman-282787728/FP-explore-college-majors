8490805,5,B0061BDWES,"Dramarama was a series of one off children's dramas which was networked as part of Childrens ITV in the 1980s. Unlike most other programmes of the era which had one sole ITV company being repsonsible for the whole series, Dramarama had contributions from more or less every ITV franchise holder of the period, possibly without Yorkshire.
This set offers the ten episodes contributed by 1968 - 1992 contractor Thames Television and features a wealth of familiar faces incluing Gary Oldman, Dexter Fletcher, David Jason and Eamonn Walker playing a policeman two years before he would play a PC in The Bill. One of my favourites on this set is Dodger, Bonzo and the Rest which would eventually become a series of its own in 1985.
If you like a trip down memory lane and would love to see what ITV used to be able to provide for children in the afternoons, then this is for you.
Hopefully Network will release Dodger, Bonzo and the Rest as well as another Dramarama volume very soon.",1357516800,,979,4.664739884393064
