172470,5,0964616882,"This video gives tremendous hope to parents who have children with autism. As a physician, I learned so much about the progress we will make in finding better treatments and even a cure for autism. I highly recommend this videos for parents, educators and pediatricians.

7793757,2,0964616882,"While this video could give hope to parents of newly diagnosed children, it delivers very little information about the new laws. Only references to the law being passed and why the law is needed are mentioned in the video.  It lists sources at the end of the video where you can get additional information, however, a quick online search can deliver the same for a lot less money.",1080432000,,380,4.588235294117647
7793758,5,0964616882,"This video gave me hope that someday there will be a cure for autism.  It's important that all parents, educators and concerned friends of children with autism or PDD view this video.  The information you obtain in the video is critical in undestanding autism and the law designed to find a cure.  The video motivated me to get involoved and support organizations that are trying to make a difference.",1025049600,10,401,4.782608695652174
7793759,4,0964616882,"Although there was a lot of good information in this video, I noticed that most of the research it discusses is based in genetics, and I was disappointed that environmental causes aren't being addressed.  I was concerned that no other possible causes for the current epidemic were addressed.  Many of us believe that there must be an environmental basis for the increase in autism because humans don't genetically evolve this quickly.  I didn't see much addressed about physical health in autism either, which is a big concern for many as well.
If you have a new diagnosis, I would recommend it because it has some good information for beginners.",1021420800,17,646,4.908256880733945
7793760,5,0964616882,"As a professional educator who has worked with children with Autism and their families, I believe, this video offers parents, educators, and health care professional a clear explanation of Autism and other similar disorders.  It is full of valuable information presented in a useful format, simplifying and summarizing the Children's Health Act of 2000 as it relates to Autism.  It will be especially helpful to parents and can serve as a guide to them as they seek to become more knowledgeable and therefore become better able to meet their child's needs.

7793762,3,0964616882,"I found this video vague and not very helpful.  It shows the passing of the new laws but not how it effects the individuals.  The list on references/sources can be found on any Autism publication.  For good general information on Autism I suggest the book, ""Autism, Facts and Strategies for Parents"" by Janice Jansen.  This is an excellent source for Parents of newly diagnosed children as it is bias to treatment.  For informational videos try the University of Indiana web site who list hundreds of video on Autism, brief synopsis of each and how to obtain them.

The laws that we are subject to can be difficult to interpret,and they change  all the time!""Autism and the New Law"" is very helpful in explaining these law's (in a language we can ALL understand).",1011139200,3,244,4.4222222222222225
