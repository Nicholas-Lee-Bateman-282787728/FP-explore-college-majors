3726105,5,B001O2SGZY,"I already have the book of The Mousehole Cat and the video I taped off the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. I wanted to have it on DVD so my two Grand Daughters could watch it. I was born in Perth Western Australia. My mother was born in a village on Bodmin Moor in Cornwall. I have had 2 trips to Cornwall including Mum's village of St. Breward.

Yours sincerely,

3726107,5,B001O2SGZY,"I had taped this program on VHS years ago when it was on the local PBS channel and decided to see if I could get a commercial copy for when the VHS tape breaks down.  Friends and I watched the new DVD during the holiday season and enjoyed it very much; for me it has become a Christmas favorite.  Being a cat lover, this charming tale of a fisherman and his faithful feline is very appealing, and the musical score is the best thing about it.  Clever and heartwarming, the story of Mowzel and her ""pet"", Old Tom, is a must see.",1294963200,2,527,4.147058823529412
3726108,5,B001O2SGZY,"I will admit I'm 22 and love children cartoons. I never had the privilege to see this cartoon as a child. Even so, I love this cartoon and deem it a true classic. The narration is wonderful. The voice is soft and calming. It's not fully animated - to me it doesn't matter the art is good enough for me. It's a charming tale about helping a village around Christmas time.",1290643200,,370,4.225352112676056
