I have not seen the Alpha because I refuse to buy their products as they started using a superimposed logo around 2005-2006.  This VCI Kermit Maynard Doule Feature includes ""Red Blood of Courage"" and ""Roaring Six Guns"", both Ambassador releases.  According to records, they don't appear to be edited, but both features do have some annoying splices breaking up dialogue.  Unless I find them super cheap, I will be cautious about purchasing.  At  least the titles are original.",1355184000,,565,4.833333333333333

This movie seems to have lost about ten minutes or more of scenes. Its still a good story. Kermit Maynard, like his older brother Ken, was a rodeo and circus rider , This film shows one example of his act. This plot came from a James Oliver Curwood story, which made it better than average.
