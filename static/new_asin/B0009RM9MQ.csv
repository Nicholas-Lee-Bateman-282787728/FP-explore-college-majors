8065579,4,B0009RM9MQ,"A history lesson in the evolution of Honky Tonk piano starting from the beginning. This guy knows his stuff, plays through at tempo and then slows it all down for you. If you read, all the better as he includes his charts. I don't read, I play by ear but that doesn't matter. It's all right there. Just listen and learn. Playing piano takes a LOT of practice so if you think you'll quickly learn what he's doing here think again. He gives you all you need to get a great start but you must put in the practice time.",1494806400,,515,4.16
