6396366,5,B00JXBLL6Y,"This series is basically a sexually charged harem lol Yes, there is nudity (nowhere near as much as series like samurai girls) and there is plenty of sexual innuendo, but I wouldn't classify it as hentai. I thought the series was pretty funny, with plenty of memorable characters, albeit a pretty boring and forgettable protag. I loved the artwork and the style, this series was very visually stimulating. If you're into sexual comedies, this should be right up your alley. I say pick it up! I was not disappointed!",1423526400,3,515,4.797752808988764

6396369,5,B00JXBLL6Y,"I came upon this one day while browsing the DVD lists on Amazon, looking for something new to try, and was surprised to find it was one of the much more enjoyable series I have, now, in my more experienced state, found.

As with most Anime, I cannot suggest whether you should choose Blu-ray or DVD for your format, but either way, it will not disappoint.

The plot is not... completely unique, as it has elements of several other series, elements such as: girl pretending to be a guy, Butler/Maid culture (with a bit of comedic fetishism included), master/servant dynamics, father/daughter weirdness (but always amusing), Guy who has negative physical reactions to female contact, and frighteningly powerful ass kicking females.

At it's heart, this is a comedy series, though, it does get into some heavier areas here and there, it usually quickly picks back up into the funny moments, in a way that has a realistic flavor to them and will make you smile.

The plot is of average Harem comedy type, including the lack of solid resolution at the end of the run, but is still worth the ride if you can live with a look in the direction of which of the girls is chosen, without an outright resolution.

Where the show really stands out is in the characters, who can be stereotypical at types, but are still endearing and fun to watch.
Sakamachi Kinjiro (or Sakama Chikin Jiro as he hates to be called) is the Male, and is deathly allergic to the female touch, getting faint and a bleeding nose whenever a female makes contact with him for long, which is a defense mechanism evolved to deal with the particulars of his home life.
Konoe Suburu is a Butler to the Dean of the Schools only daughter, the resident Hot Guy, who is also secretly a girl, and a total badass who is surprisingly cute... for a pretty boy.
Suzutsuki Kanade is the Deans Daughter, prettiest girl in school, and secretly sadistic young miss who derives endless pleasure in ""playing"" with Jiro and his sister, along with other characters later in the show.  A constant source of exciting trouble, she is carrying mixed motives, and is one of the most fun characters in the Anime.
Other characters come in later, but I wish not to spoil it, but rest assured, they are entertaining to be on par with the others.

Overall, the show is a short, 12 episode (really 13, though the last is entered as a pseudo OVA) funny, slightly tear jerky, enjoyable ride from start to finish, with good comedy, slight drama, light action, and one of the catchiest theme songs around.

Also, a note, for those who have watched ""Hanganai: I Don't Have Many Friends"" and ""Haganai: NEXT.""  This is the show that it references a few times, in various episodes.",1404086400,17,2703,4.638075313807532
6396380,5,B00JXBLL6Y,"A wonderful anime with unique characters and zany shenanigans. The interpersonal interactions between the characters are PRICELESS, and the dub is absolutely fantastic (if you're a dub nitpicker, you might not enjoy Koreha's voice or one odd laugh Kanade lets out early on, but I think overall it was a great dub). The romantic relationship between Kunoi and Kinjiro is the absolute best thing about this show, no question. Regardless, a great show that is definitely worth your time.",1454371200,2,484,5.139240506329114
6396381,4,B00JXBLL6Y,The plot is interesting for the most part I enjoyed the series if I had 1 complaint is the show is rated MA but it somewhat censored other that it's good.,1453852800,,154,4.0
6396382,4,B00JXBLL6Y,"This is a great show, but there are issues with the Japanese audio track. The 2-channel english dub sounds fine and vibrant, with clear stereo separation, but when switching to the 2-channel Japanese dub (which I prefer), the audio sounds muffled, and the soundstage that was wide and vibrant in the english dub, collapses into mush. It is intelligible, but no where near the quality that it should be. This may not be an isolated issue either. It seems other fans have noticed the issue as well (http://www.fandompost.com/oldforums/showthread.php?12653-Sentai-Filmworks-licenses-Mayo-Chiki!/page5). So it seems like the problem lies in the disc pressing. According to some on the forum that I linked to above, Sentai may be slow to respond to this issue, if they respond at all.

If you are a fan of the english dub, you will be fine with this disc. If you prefer the Japanese audio, be warned. The DTS 2.0 channel Master Audio track is poor, and it seems like Sentai is not in any hurry to fix it!",1452816000,,999,4.876470588235295
6396383,4,B00JXBLL6Y,"I did not really understand the blandness of the dub (which FUNimation does better than Sentai in my opinion), but the anime itself is great to watch and the dub makes me enjoy it more.",1447200000,,185,4.314285714285714

6396385,5,B00JXBLL6Y,I like this video very much I wanted to be very funny and entertaining.,1440720000,,71,4.142857142857143
6396386,5,B00JXBLL6Y,"I love this anime series especially the dub, so much so that I imported the U.S. Version because the UK version doesn't have the dubbed version.
I'd recommend this anime to most anime fans, however a slight warning though, the anime itself never actually has a proper ending and leaves you hanging, but a quick look online tells you how it ends in the light novel and manga, and as I loved how it ended I brought the manga mostly as the original light novel that this anime is based in wasn't translated like the manga.
The series probably finishes on roughly volume 4 and or 5 of the manga anyway and the story just gets better including a proper end.
So to sum up this very looooong review
Good anime, Great Dub unfinished but ends in s way you can imagine your own end if you don't want to look the ending up or buy the manga.",1440288000,2,829,4.253164556962025
6396387,4,B00JXBLL6Y,Package came in early and in good condition...the anime itself is really good but not the best ending over all I rate it a 4 out of 5,1437609600,,133,3.7857142857142856
6396388,5,B00JXBLL6Y,Mayo Chiki is a wonderful show that any fan of Slice of Life can enjoy. The dub wasn't the best (if you watch with the dub) but it was also enjoyable at the same time.,1431129600,,167,3.8
6396389,4,B00JXBLL6Y,Story is as great as the animation. However it does not have a proper ending. If you liked the anime I strongly recommend the manga it gives an ending that it deserves; a season 2 does not look bright for this show.,1430870400,,215,4.142857142857143

8654408,5,B00JXBLL6Y,"I've seen many anime series over the years but this is one of the ones I keep watching.

Jiro's encounter with Subaru leads to his life being turned upside down. If the butler's secret wasn't enough you have Kanachan tormenting him throughout. Versus the manga, Masamune's story is somewhat condensed and later arcs omitted. But it covers the most important parts of the story. The ending is also very condensed version the manga and probably the weakest aspect of the anime adaption. Still it is very entertaining .

The Blu-ray itself offers good 1080p and stereo audio. We get the original audio with subs and a pretty good dub. There are minor alterations in the dub but if that's your thing you won't be missing out much. I still recommend the sub form though. Special features amount to the clean versions of opening/closing sequences.",1520121600,,841,4.833333333333333

8654410,5,B00JXBLL6Y,"Alright so... the story has a lot of 'cute' parts in it, however; it is very sexually straight forward. The service is moderate at best, mostly revealings without actually showing full disclosure. Plot was extensive, which was abit of a surprise. The character's 'condition' is what truly makes the series worth watching. All in all, if you've looking for a good show to both laugh and awe...this is for you. If you want another Sekerei...ehh.",1486857600,,443,4.92
