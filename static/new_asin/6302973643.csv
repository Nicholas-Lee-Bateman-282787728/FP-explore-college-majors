7833417,3,6302973643,The print is old and faded but lots of underwater photography. Low-budget but passable. Young Chuck Woolery with a beard and a young Cheryl Ladd.,1474675200,,145,4.84

7833420,3,6302973643,"Fun, low budget movie. I bought this to see my favorite actor, Stephen Boyd. Not a great role, but he is always fun to watch, and this is such an unusual role for him~ not the bad guy for a change! Also a very young Cheryl Ladd. Beautiful underwater film work. A good family friendly movie!!",1455580800,,291,4.214285714285714

7833423,2,6302973643,"The video quality was so poor it was almost unviewable. The plot looked like it was only used to justify the underwater scenes
which would have been excellent except for the video quality",1415059200,,187,4.696969696969697

7833425,1,6302973643,"I bought this video as a joke for a friend, which went over well....We watched the movie and it was painful to get through.  I am certainly a fan of low-budget, bad movies, but this one is truly the worst.",1295827200,,205,4.125
