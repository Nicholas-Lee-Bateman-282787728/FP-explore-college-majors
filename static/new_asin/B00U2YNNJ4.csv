7028463,5,B00U2YNNJ4,"Carpenters - Legends In Concert ...DVD. This is a concert recorded in 1976, the video quality is not the best. It was lip synced for a foreign TV show, the sound is great and nice to see Karen again.",1431734400,,199,4.128205128205129
7028464,3,B00U2YNNJ4,"So great to see Karen and Richard from the 1976 era. Some reviews have the year wrong. Kind of Hush and I Need to Be in Love are from that year. Anyway, poor video, fair audio taken from a video tape that does what tapes occasionally do. They warble or tracking goes off, some audio and video dropout. Anyway still great to have this in my collection. The price is about right for this type of DVD. Enjoy it anyway. I was fortunate to see them a couple of times at the Sahara Tahoe during this time. Sweet memories of that and college at CSU Chico.",1431043200,2,548,4.179245283018868
7028465,2,B00U2YNNJ4,"I bought this, watched it once and now has been put away, probably forever.  The music by the carpenters is why it gets two stars.  The DVD would get none if that were at all possible.  Never having seen the carpenters in concert I was excited when it arrived.  Then I realized its a TV special.  Go to YouTube , you can watch the same thing free and it's better quality",1430956800,8,370,4.154929577464789
7028466,1,B00U2YNNJ4,"Very disappointed.  The DVD was so obviously transferred from a video tape and is quite poor quality in both video and sound.  There are places where the tape is tracking badly.  At one point text appears as if the user pressed a remote button.  The entire show is short, and indeed at the end it even says it's from a TV special, so not even a live concert.  Like it's a bootleg copy.  The only good thing was when Karen first came out and used her lovely voice.  I do have to say I smiled through the first part, because they were having fun, and I enjoyed the music.  But I sadly don't recommend purchasing this DVD.  Giving it even one star is generous.  We should get a complete refund.",1430870400,15,691,4.246153846153846
7028467,5,B00U2YNNJ4,"Richard and Karen Carpenter needn't have ever worried about Donny & Marie stealing their crown back in the 1970's. With a dozen or so string of Top Ten singles that have gone on to become standards in American popular music, it's a feat no duo from the rock era has ever come close to accomplishing, let alone Donny & Marie. Songs like ""Bless the Beasts and Children,"" ""I Won't Last A Day Without You,"" ""Merry Christmas Darling"" and ""For All We Know"" to name just a mere few, are songs that Richard and Karen introduced to the world.  If you love the music of The Carpenters and want to see them perform ""live"" then this is the DVD for you.

This 1976 concert is what Carpenters fans and collectors have come to call ""the Holland concert"" which was actually a Dutch television special. But before you get too excited and rush to hit the purchase button you should know a few things.  This is far from being a professional release.  Although the picture quality is far superior to the bootleg video that has circulated among collectors since the late 80's, the copy presented here on DVD is on an amateurish level, transferred from a consumer's VCR in which we see the display counter pop up twice during the length of the concert, which runs 41:56. The picture quality, however, is not as horrible as the previous two reviewers have stated. Just don't expect a super perfect picture.  Additionally, the sound is very good which is what you would want from a Carpenters concert. I was surprised. If you can handle some imperfections you should be very happy with this DVD for your collection.

As for the concert itself what a show!  Karen Carpenter looks gorgeous!  And she's every bit the young superstar she was.  Karen was as magical as she was entertaining, charming the audience with not only her beautiful and one-of-a-kind voice, but with her great sense of humor, placing her tambourine on the head of the late Doug Strawn as she was performing ""Top of the World.""  Both she and Richard perform a good collection of their mega hits, including ""Close to You"" and ""Superstar,"" but also provide us with a segment from Broadway's ""Grease.""  This is where a lot of the fun is, with Richard riding out on a motorcycle all nerded out singing ""Greased Lightning"" and ""Beauty School Dropout"" with the guys in the band, followed by Karen coming out in a redheaded beehive wig and strutting around the stage with supersized ""boobs"" singing ""Look at Me I'm Sandra Dee,"" cracking the audience up. Whomever didn't push to get Karen Carpenter for a part in the motion picture release of ""Grease"" a couple of years later made the biggest mistake of their career. Karen Carpenter had talent coming out of her ears.

This is a wonderful trip back in time to see the Number One American music act of the 1970's. Get it.",1430784000,5,2808,4.627766599597585
7028468,2,B00U2YNNJ4,"I'm a Carpenters fan, and as I wasn't around when the Carpenters were performing, it is nice to see these concerts on DVD.  Especially with this DVD where they perform a few tracks from GREASE, the stage musical.  As this concert is from November 1976, this was before the 1978 movie

Unfortunately this DVD was made by a real Amateur when it comes to transferring VHS.  It looks like the transfer person was using one of those cheap USB VHS-To-DVD converters that you can buy in any department store or websit for under$100; where you can connect any  VCR to your computer.  I've tried them in the past and they give poor quality color and sharpness.  I do my own video transfers for myself and clients and I find that to get good DVD video you need to go through a converter like a Canopus ADVC-300, at least before burning to DVD.
Also, for VHS I use a S-VHS VCR with Time-Base Corrector and Proc Amp, none of which was used by the transfer person, who seems to have grabbed the nearest VCR and used that.  During ""Sing"" the video jumps around, and a Digital time stamp appears on the screen giving the date and time of when this video was being transferred.  This is the type of time stamp that you find on any VCR made sine the late-90's.

Also the video quality appears to be VHS Second Generation or Third.  This is evident in the GREASE secene, as the faces are mostly washed out from lack of detail, but at least the VHS tape, when it was copied, was copied in the SP mode.  Plus the Colors bleed a lot, and to help that, you can really only watch this DVD by connecting your DVD player to your TV by the yellow RCA Composite cable, which is a shame as the DVD's bitrate is in the 7.0-8.0 range, so there is very little compression on the disc.

If a little more time had been taken to transfer this with the proper equipment, such as using a S-VHS deck and Canopus ADVC-300 or another analog-digital converter, then this could've been an good release.  But because of the Amateurish transfer, I'm giving this release only 2 stars.",1430179200,15,2040,4.376657824933687
7028469,2,B00U2YNNJ4,"Back in early 2012 I reviewed a Carpenters DVD titled Carpenters - In Performance 1972. It was 70 minutes long and apparently a concert from 1972 in Japan. It wasn't an authorized release but still entertaining. The package said The Broadcast Archives.
Now  in 2015- comes this new DVD titled Legends in Concert: Carpenters and also says The Broadcast Archives. But this one is different. It runs about 50 minutes and  like the other one  has no beginning or end titles. You never see the audience so I cant tell where the concert was held. It has the hits but also an interesting section I don't remember seeing before (yes, the Carpenters experts will probably know more than me) with a scene recreated from the film Grease, a Piano Picker Parody with Richard and Karen doing a long drum solo. The images are dark in most places and the sound far from hi-fi.

What really surprised me was that about halfway through the screen image shows that this was recorded from a VCR. It even has the Time (12:00) and Date stamp (though not the year) and the counter number! It only lasts briefly but Ive never seen this before on a commercial DVD. The short blub on the package says the performance is from 1976.

Normally Id give this just 1 star but I raised it to two stars for the following reason: The Drum Medley is one Id not seen before and I enjoyed watching Karen beat those drum. And there were one or two more non hits that I didn't remember from other Carpenters DVDs. So I was entertained there. But, don't expect high quality image or sound on this release. Know that going in. Im guessing that completists may want it but, if this was recorded from a broadcast  which it obviously was  then there must be better copies out there (and without the VCR imprint.)

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8704278,3,B00U2YNNJ4,"This was disappointing but still nice to see.

The video ranged from ok to bad - sometime the picture was WAY too soft which was a shame because it's hard to get any concert footage of them. A nice sharp copy of a full concert performance would be golden. The other trouble was the length of this show - it wasn't much over 50 minutes but then concerts back than weren't much longer. The sound ranged from ok to pretty good - price was below $12 including S&H.

It was nice to see a drum solo by Karen!

The main reason I bought it was it's hard to get any concert footage. This meets that goal but barely.

I would rate this a 7.0 to 7.5 out of 10 - recommended for anyone wanting to see some concert stuff but not much else.",1452124800,,726,4.055944055944056

Says German dolby stereo on the pull up screen but the dvd cover said 5.1. This is a must , if u like me and adore Karen n will take any quality recording of her. All in all looks like a Counterfiet recording from some schmuck in the audience. No way this was released with  Richard's stamp of  approval .",1449014400,5,412,4.1375
