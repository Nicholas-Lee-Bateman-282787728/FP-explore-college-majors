8220608,5,B000VZBCX8,This was awesome. JCW is like the return of WWF and ECW combined and just a little more. Disc 4 Bloodymania Tracy Smothers spot gotta be one of the funniest things I've seen in the business. It is must see.,1517529600,,206,4.175
8220609,4,B000VZBCX8,"It's like watching an R-Rated version of ""Mid-South Wrestling"" . My only disappointment was the match featuring ""Jake the Snake"" Robert's. I expected more, but the other matches made up for it.",1492473600,,193,5.0625

8220614,2,B000VZBCX8,"I know ICP are rappers who have a loyal fan base. How the hell they ever got involved in wrestling especially during one of there biggest & last booms is beyond me (WWF Attitude Era & WCW). The fans throw crap into the ring, which is annoying, & plain disrespectful. I don't know why legends show up to wrestle in front of these fans. If I saw trash being thrown into the ring, I'd of walked out. The commentary is by ICP & it's awful as expected. It's just swearing and making fun of the wrestlers. I'm open minded and seen some bad wrestling companies but this might shoot to the top of the list. Avoid JCW, the wrestling isn't all that bad but the fans throw trash into the ring & ICP suck on commentary.",1416873600,7,707,4.205882352941177

8220616,5,B000VZBCX8,"I'm both a huge fan of wrestling and ICP so when the two are combined it's awesome. What I love the most is the way that Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope call the matches, though they're making fun of the wrestlers, it's highly entertaining. I actually attended one of their live JCW events and met some of the most famous wrestlers such as the late Trent Acid. That event is featured on this dvd, so I got to see myself which was dope! I suggest that any wrestling/ICP fan needs to own this.",1386028800,3,487,4.191489361702128
