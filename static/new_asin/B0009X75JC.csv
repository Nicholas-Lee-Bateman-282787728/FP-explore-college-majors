2333854,5,B0009X75JC,"The last of the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes series, Prelude to Murder was likewise the last of an era for British filmmaking.  By this time, the actors and writers had begun to show their age, and their enthusiasm for the characters they were portraying had noticeably slipped--such is the case for any film series that extends on for fourteen installments (imagine if James Bond never cycled actors, for instance).  Prelude to Murder is also the last and latest Legend Films entry into the Sherlock Holmes world, for the time being.  By this point in time, having three other Holmes films under their belt, Legend has perfected its application of their colorization technology, resulting in a quite beautiful job that is among their best.  Judging from the relatively poor quality of the public domain versions of the film, Legend had their work cut out for them in cleaning up this classic to the presentable state it finds itself.

But just because this may be one of the best colorizations of a classic film doesn't mean that you have to watch it that way, because Legend has included the cleaned-up black and white version on the same disc.  This way, those who prefer to watch their films in the traditional, nostalgic way can do so, while those of us might enjoy a little added spice of color can have our druthers as well.",1227657600,22,1327,4.747826086956522
2333855,4,B0009X75JC,"Prelude to Murder (DRESSED TO KILL) was unfortunately the last of about fourteen Sherlock Holmes films that starred Basil Rathbone as the famous private detective with Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson. The story concerns printing plates stolen from the Bank of England and a collection of three nondescript music boxes.  What connection do these items have and will this caper cost the famous Holmes his life?

The restoration is very well done for a vintage 1946 film.  One thing that did bother me was moving the timeline for the Holmes stories from Victorian England to the World War II era.  Somehow it did not seem quite right.  However, Basil Rathbone is a superb Sherlock although I think Nigel Bruce was more bungling than Dr. Watson should have been portrayed to my way of thinking.

Still all in all a fine job of restoration and entertaining.  Holmes comes very close to being in a heap of trouble.

Sherlock Holmes is a fictional detective of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who first appeared in publication in 1887 --- He is the creation of Scottish born author and physician Sir Arthur Conan Doyle --- A brilliant London-based detective, Holmes is famous for his intellectual prowess, and is renowned for his skillful use of deductive reasoning and astute observation to solve difficult cases --- He is arguably the most famous fictional detective ever created, and is one of the best known and most universally recognisable literary characters in any genre.

Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories that featured Holmes --- All but four stories are narrated by Holmes' friend and biographer, Dr. John H. Watson, two are narrated by Holmes himself, and two others are written in the third person --- The first two stories, short novels, appeared in Beeton's Christmas Annual for 1887 and Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890 --- The character grew tremendously in popularity with the beginning of the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine in 1891; further series of short stories and two serialised novels appeared almost right up to Conan Doyle's death in 1930 --- The stories cover a period from around 1878 up to 1903, with a final case in 1914. (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

Rathbone is most widely recognized for his starring role as Sherlock Holmes in fourteen movies between 1939 and 1946, all of which co-starred Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson --- The first two films, The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (both 1939) were set in the late-Victorian times of the original stories --- Both of these were made by Twentieth Century Fox, later installments, made at Universal Studios, beginning with Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror (1942), were set in contemporary times, and some had World War II-related plots --- Rathbone and Bruce also reprised their film roles in a radio series, The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1939 - 1946) --- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

2333858,3,B0009X75JC,"Basil Rathbone remains one of only two legendary Sherlock Holmes actors, even to this day. But ""Prelude to Murder (or Dressed to Kill)"" is not one of the better movies starring Rathbone -- while the mystery is genuinely entertaining, the plot isn't quite long or substantial enough.

Three plain music boxes are sold at an auction, one to Watson's old pal ""Stinky"" (Edmund Breon). The music boxes don't seem to be anything special, which is why Holmes (Basil Rathbone) is intrigued when Stinky is robbed of a similar music box -- and then found with a knife in his back. Obviously there's something special about the boxes.

Holmes and Watson (Nigel Bruce) rush to the next box's owner, and find that the little girl has been robbed by a disguised thief. But Holmes gets his hands on the third box, and learns what the thieves are after, and how the peculiar tune of the music box holds the key to unlimited wealth -- and ruin for England's economic structure.

""Prelude to Murder"" was sadly the last of Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes movies, after thirteen other movies that ranged from Arthur Conan Doyle's own stories to ones made up for World War II. Some of those stories were amazing, and some -- like ""Prelude to Murder""'s counterfeiting story -- are merely middling in quality.

The music box code and the missing five-pound plates make for an interesting mystery, especially for the first half of the movie. The thieves are especially intriguing, including a menacing colonel, a chauffeur madly in love with his employer, and the well-clad Hilda Courtney, who yanks her mink stole out from under a just-murdered man -- and seems more concerned about keeping the stole pristine.

But the plot just isn't enough to cover even a short film (about an hour and even minutes, in case you're wondering), and after the rescue of the little girl, it lags badly. Even more unfortunate, scenes like Holmes' capture don't have much suspense, even though they should.

Rathbone's performance is as solid as ever, giving Holmes elegant intelligence that he doesn't have to work at. He even gets to give Holmes some wistfulness in the opening scenes. And Bruce gives a similarly pleasant performance, although he does have his goofy moments, like doing a Donald Duck impression for a traumatized little girl.

This edition has the original black-and-white version, which has been carefully restored to its original sharpness. No scenes in it look washed-out or blurred. The sound is outstanding as well.

""Prelude to Murder (or Dressed to Kill)"" is an entertaining mystery, though it's rather slow and simplistic compared to Rathbone's other Sherlock films. But it's still worth watching.",1153526400,,2678,4.962053571428571
2333859,1,B0009X75JC,"Reading the comments below about some people favoring all movies shot in black and white be colorized because they believe that if the studios could have shot them all in color if they could is just nuts.  Many movies were intended to be in black and white to set the appropriate atmosphere.  Film noirs, horror, etc.  Ha ha, I'd love to see someone try to go to Martin Scorcese and tell him that they want to see a colorized version of Raging Bull.  I love old Technicolor movies because that is the way they filmed them, but I never saw one colorized film that was any good.  Someone said below said the system accurately colorizes them, but what they don't seem to realize is that when the studios shot them in black and white, they planned it that way and the actual color of the clothes they wore were not the normal colors we imagine we are seeing.  For examples, a pink shirt would be worn to pass for white because with the lights hitting it did seem to be white in black and white.  In a 1950s Superman movie with George Reeves, since it was a black and white film the costume was brownish instead of blue in order to film correctly. So, in them saying the colors are accurately colorized is wrong.  It would not surprise me to have these people are in defense of full-screen version of widescreen movies simply because the picture fills the screen.  What is surprising is that the studios are doing this will outrage a number of filmmakers because what they are doing is altering the director's vision.  And I MUST address the review in Mark of Zorro's listing that put forth the stupid argument that people buy DVDs with color covers because people would be turned off by a b&w one.  Isn't that like saying that back in the old days the studios made color movie posters hoping to trick people into coming in to the theatre, not knowing they were seeing a black and white movie?  According to ""Mr. Perfect"" (gad), we ""purists"" are phonies atop high horses.  No, we are film fans who like to see what we were meant to see when the movie was made. The one thing I regret about people who will not watch a black and white movie (and I have met some) is that they miss a number of great movie classics.  It's like having an education of movies that only starts with the beach movies of the Sixties and goes to the present day (minus, of course, fims like Schindler's List, Sin City, Raging Bull, Manhattan, etc.  I love these comments from directors about colorization:

Woody Allen: ""Determining the colors that people wear, or what colors the walls are and so on are major creative decisions. . . . To have a group of people from the outside making those decisions is criminal and ludicrous."" Also, he said, ""I have no quarrel with the mechanics. ""That has nothing to do with it. If a director is around and says he'd like to have it colorized, fine. If not, no one should be allowed to change it, in any way, ever.""

Billy Wilder: ""Those fools! Do they really think that colorization will make ""The Informer"" any better? Or ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Casablanca""? Or do they hope to palm off some of the old stinkers by dipping them in 31 flavors? Is there no end to their greed?""

Joe Dante: ""Black and white was an art form in the '40s. . . By changing them, they are tampering with history. It's the death knell of an entire art form.""

Elliot Silverstein: ""We're dealing with moral and professional issues here, not a commercial one. These fellows are lifting their legs on people's work.""

Milos Forman:  ""I might see a colorized film and not be offended by it. That's not the point. The point is creative rights. Coloring films is like putting aluminum siding on a 17th-Century castle.""",1130371200,15,3693,4.473919523099851
2333860,5,B0009X75JC,"Wow, that's all I can say about the beautiful job done by the masters of colorization at Legend Films.  Such a perfect color picture in every frame of this classic Sherlock Holmes movie.  Every item in the frame was given it's own unique and accurate color, it looked even better than a real color movie.  Perfection, that's what this colorized movie is.  You couldn't ask for a more beautiful color picture.  This wonderful new colorizing really does breathe life into these stale old b/w images, now this movie is alive again and of the present.  It no longers looks like a relic of the old days, but a wonderful visit with a very colorful Sherlock & Watson.  The colorful game is afoot and I loved every colorized minute!!  I highly recommend everyone buy this and all the other fantastic colorized movies in this Sherlock series, Woman In Green, Terror By Night, & Secret Weapon.  They all look just fantastic in these realistic and completely accurate and wonderfully beautiful color versions.  I can not say enough to complement the great colorizing geniuses at Legend and Off Color Films, they create real works of art.  I truly wish all dull drab ugly b/w movies & TV shows were colorized so beautifully.  I love it, PLEASE COLORIZE MORE MOVIES & TV SHOWS, I'll guarantee to be the first in line.  I hope more and more movie studios will start colorizing their movies, I'd love to see Paramount colorize ""Holiday Inn"", there's a movie just begging to be in color.  COLORIZE your b/w tv shows & movies, is the key word to all the video movie studo companies out there holding b/w movies in your vaults.  Video producers, Colorize all b/w movies/TV shows and release them on DVD, it would be a dream come true.  Fox has realized the beauty of coloring their b/w movies, now please Paramount, Warner, MGM, & all others, please follow Fox's insight and colorize all your b/w movies/tv shows, and you'll find a real audience for these b/w movies and programs.",1127260800,11,1962,4.692982456140351

The film begins with a view of snowy Dartmoor Prison. Prisoners manufacture music boxes for sale to the public at an auction. Later a man shows up, he wanted to buy all three. Can he find the purchasers? Is there some crime involved? An old friend of Dr. John Watson visits to tell about the theft of a music box. Sherlock Holmes is interested. Why would a thief steal a cheap item and pass up more expensive items? Was this a mistake? Mrs. Hilda Courtney visits Julian Emory. Will Emory pay attention to the warning? Sherlock Holmes questions the seller of those music boxes. Holmes & Watson visit one customer and discover something wrong.

The gift shop is under surveillance, but the pair get away. They learn the name of the convict who made the music boxes. If the printing plates for 5 were stolen the counterfeits could not be distinguished! [Except for the paper.] Can Sherlock Holmes deduce the secret of the three music boxes? Holmes consults an expert about that tune. Is there some code hidden in those tunes? Will that cigarette stub provide a clue? Or is it a lure to catch Sherlock in a trap? [Note the body double for the strenuous efforts.] Will Hilda fool Dr. Watson? [The same trick from ""A Scandal in Bohemia"".] ""Great Scott!"" Will Sherlock surmise the rest of the message and catch the criminals? Was there another Sherlock Holmes story used for this film, where Sherlock had to trace buyers of a similar object?

In the real world Nazi Germany actually created plates to counterfeit Bank of England 5 notes. Some of this money was used to pay their spies in neutral countries. [""I Was Cicero.""] The Bank of England recalled the old 5 notes to replace them with new money. Inflation has greatly reduced their nominal value. They were worth about $400 then ($25 in silver).",1457308800,,1850,4.6656441717791415

I read through many 100's of product descriptions; customer reviews; VHS/DVD jackets; included product commentaries and other online data base materials concerning Sherlock Holmes' films, both old and new. I've collected over a hundred and twenty five different ""Sherlock Holmes"" films that I consider worth having.
I don't do many of these reviews but hope to share some insight and guidance among those who like myself, may be looking back, in remembrance, or perhaps seeking something in Hollywood films that can be shared with others without reservation or embarassment, and worthy to watch over and over without regret.
As my title simply stated: ""Color Makes a HUGE difference!""  I enjoy the quality of many of the old black and white ""classics"" for their nostalgic value, because B/W movies are what we saw MOST of back in the earlier days of moviemaking. And, I had purchased some early colorizations done on VHS tapes by another film producer years before ""LEGEND FILMS"" began doing them with the aid of digital technology.

LEGEND has added NEW LIFE to these classics and I hope that they'll continue doing so to the other 10 Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce Sherlock Holmes movies because the difference between black and white and color is indeed like viewing a NEW FILM! And Legend includes the B/W version with the color version on the same DVD! Both in excellent quality!

A final word: be careful when ordering what you think may be a color version; as of 5/2011 I have only found 4 of the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce Sherlock Holmes movies in COLOR. I have even seen them advertised in ""color"", ordered them and had to return them. You can look up LEGEND FILMS online, as of 5/2011 they list only 4 of the Rathbone/Bruce Holmes films produced in color: Woman in Green-Secret Weapon-Terror by Night-Prelude to Murder (also known as ""Dressed to Kill"")as singles, or in a four-pack.

8069250,5,B0009X75JC,"Thoroughly enjoyed this well written mystery & Basil Rathbone in the role of Sherlock. I much prefer his version to most others.  Robert Downey Jr. , for example, was not so believable in this role & not nearly British enough. This script involving music boxes is a good one too.",1522886400,,279,4.58
8069251,5,B0009X75JC,"Dartmoor Prison, 1946. In one section, prisoners are making little wooden music boxes, which are sold in the outside world. Fade out to the Gaylord Art Gallery, London. It's having an auction, and three of the music boxes are offered for sale, and they go cheaply. After the gallery is closed for the day, a well-dressed man in a bowler hat pleads with the owner, ""This is extremely important.... I was unfortunately delayed in coming on time to bid on certain articles I'm rather anxious to obtain.... Three identical music boxes.""

He wangles the names and addresses of the purchases from the auctioneer (well, a 5 note does the wangling.) He leaves and tells his chauffeur, ""Is it my fault they were sold? She can't hold me responsible for that.""

Who is ""she"" and why does she want the music boxes? No matter, she'll get them by hook or by crook. Or by murder.

This is the 14th and last movie where Basil Rathbone played Sherlock Holmes, with Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson. It has been modernized to take place in the 1940s. It came out in 1946 and is only 72 minutes long. What it lacks in length, it makes up in excellence. This is one of the BEST Rathbone Sherlock stories and one of the best Sherlock stories by anybody. It has humor and a great plot, though you do have to accept that Holmes can repeat an odd music box melody after one hearing.

You get two versions of the movie, colorized and the original black & white. I didn't even bother watching the colorized version, but that's just my preference. The only Bonus Feature is the original trailer for the movie. Unfortunately, this movie release has no subtitles.

""Prelude to Murder"" is included in a collection of all 14 of the Sherlock films which Rathbone made with Bruce,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Sherlock-Holmes-Collection/dp/B000EXZFRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Sherlock Holmes Collection</a>. In the collection, though, it has the title ""Dressed to Kill"", which was the original British title. When it crossed the pond to the U.S., the title was changed. As a bonus, if you watch Prelude/Dressed in the Collection, it has subtitles available as well as a Commentary Track, neither of which are included in this single-movie issue. The Collection does not, however, include a colorized version of the movie.

I am a fan of many film and TV iterations of Sherlock Holmes, and that includes the Rathbone/Bruce Sherlock series.

8069252,4,B0009X75JC,"I enjoyed this Sherlock Holmes tale. The acting across the board is decent; there aren't any actors that detract/distract from the movie. This is a far more slow paced and mellow Sherlock experience compared with today's renditions (Cumberbatch & Guy Richie). I actually prefer it to be more relaxed; it fits the pacing and style of the books better. These kinds of Sherlock Holmes movies/episodes are great for kids; I got my introduction to on screen Sherlock with these older productions. They are a little dry for a kid, but they're still interesting and very much G rated. I recommend this whole heartedly; I think you'll only be disappointed if you go in expecting an exciting thrill ride of a mystery. There is definitely no RDJ here.",1517356800,,741,4.84251968503937
