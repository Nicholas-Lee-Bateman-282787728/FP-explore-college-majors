8483987,5,B005R1Y8WS,"Excellent old movie depicting a possible mercy killing. Acting of Frederic March and the rest of the case is very good. Amazingly this 1948 film could have been done today. The aspects of the trial are contemporary. The wife's bout with a brain tumor parallels that of Brittany Maynard who died with medical assistance in Oregon. It was easy to compare it, favorably, to Bette Davis' Dark Victory. That's a similar story -- woman with brain tumor, doctor who keeps the news from her but she finds out, and death at the end. But Bette Davis romanticizes the end of her life and it is mysterious how she dies. This is not the case in An Act of Murder which much more realistically shows the suffering involved and the ethical dilemma of her husband who cannot bear to see her pain. Highly recommended as a relevant, contemporary drama.",1497484800,,833,4.635135135135135

8483992,5,B005R1Y8WS,"MOVIES LIKE ( AN ACT OF MURDER ) ARE STILL, AFTER ALL OF THIS TIME EXCELLENT TO WATCH! GREAT ACTING, YOU CAN REALLY APPRECIATE THE SCRIPT, AND ITS VERY EASY TO BE SO INTO THE MOVIE THAT YOU ASK YOURSELF, : WHAT WOULD I DO IN THE JUDGE'S SITUATION IF MY LOVING WIFE IS SUFFERING THE WAY HIS WIFE WAS?
HIS POIGNANT TOTAL CHANGE OF HEART ADDRESS TO THE COURT AT THE END WAS PHENOMENAL; ALONG WITH HIS SON-IN-LAW, ( OR SOON TO BE SON-IN-LAW ) AND HIS DECIDING TO BECOME HIS LAWYER, EVEN AFTER BEING DISLIKED BY HIM...
THERE'S A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT HONESTY, CONVICTION AND THE READJUSTMENT OF ONE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD OTHERS, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR IN A POSITION TO WHERE YOU HAVE THE PROFOUND AUTHORITY AND POWER TO CHANGE LIVES AS HE DID!
 A TOTALLY AWESOME FILM! IN MY OPINION, ONE OF THE BEST IN IT'S KIND...",1350172800,3,801,4.34
