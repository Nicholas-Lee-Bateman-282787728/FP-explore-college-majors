8504746,2,B006UTDGV0,"Haven't there been enough movies to prove that a group of college students investigating the supposed hauntings in an abandoned mental hospital with a history of violence is a terrible idea?  Yet every couple of months, another handful of them decide to check out the legends and prove or disprove them.  And every time, they all die.

In this case it's John, Tess, Daniel, Brennan, Samantha and Blake, all looking to get a passing grade by going into the Odenbrook Sanitarium, a supposedly haunted hospital in which, years ago, everyone in the place committed mass suicide, and recording their findings for their group thesis project.

The movie is presented as half-found footage and half not as we open with John in the hospital after his friends have been slaughtered in the hospital.  An investigator is there with him, trying to figure out if John is responsible or not, so together they watch the recovered footage.  Turns out, soon after getting to the hospital, John bailed, saying his sister had called and their grandmother needed someone to tend to her.

Why did you lie, the agent asks, to which John replies, ""We just wanted to scare them.""  Because John and Tess believe in the paranormal, but the others in the group don't, so John was going to lock them in, then, late at night, make a lot of noises and scare them.  Only, John never showed up again until two days later, and by then it was much too late.

Meanwhile, inside the hospital, Samantha gets mad at boyfriend Brennan and says she's leaving, then is never seen again.  The others, discovering they've been locked in, try to find a way out but find instead that their only exit is DEATH!  Tess is dragged away, Brennan is beaten to death, Daniel appears to have been hung in mid-air.  Finally, Samantha gets out, but is met by a locked gate just as John shows up.  He unlocks the gate just in time, but it's not really, because Samantha is yanked back inside, followed by John.

So what happens, the investigator asks.  I saw the devil, John says, and he whispered something to me.

PARANORMAL INCIDENT, written and directed by Matthew Bolton, isn't the worst of these kind of movies I've ever seen, but I wouldn't place it in the top five, either.

It's not a terrible movie by any means.  The acting is decent, passable at least, and each character is given just enough backstory to feel more fleshed out than most teen ensemble movies in this category.

The location is definitely creepy as hell, and the scares don't come across as cheap and clich.  There are none of the standard cat in the window jump scares, at least.

The found footage aspect is used to great effect by putting the viewer in the dark, cramped hallways and stuffy patients' rooms with the characters, which adds greatly to the mood of the film.

The things that, for me, kept this movie from being really good were, first, the backstory feels unfinished.  Why did the patients all commit suicide?  What is really haunting the Odenbrook?

Second, the hospital scenes with John and the investigator, while providing a very real part of the story that most of these found footage movies never tackle (usually because they end with no survivors), felt forced and silly, especially the ending which left way too many questions unanswered.  However, they didn't feel unanswered because the film was going for that vague, mysterious ending, it felt like they were things Bolton just hadn't bothered to think of answers for, not that satisfied him any more than they would have satisfied the viewer.

The effects were decent enough but nothing to brag about, and in my opinion way too much of the movie was filmed with night vision.  But, really, those aren't factors that make or break the movie.  For me, it's those scenes afterward with John in the hospital, and that super weird and vague ending that feels tacked on, that keep PARANORMAL INCIDENT from being a better movie.  It's got all the requisite aspects, pretty people doing stupid things in the dark, getting drunk, college assignments, and a seedy, suspect location that no one has any right being in without some kind of supervision.  By all accounts, this should have been a no-brainer.  But, man, that ending.  Out of nowhere.  And it didn't make a lick of sense.

Sorry, everyone knows that so much of what makes a great story depends on the ending, and this one didn't only get it wrong, it got it weird.  An unoriginal story with no resolution to the backstory and not even a hint of an explanation provided.  Not only is there no explanation, as is so often the case in these found footage ghost stories, but the end of this one sidesteps any sort of answer by asking even more questions.  And those questions don't even make any sense.  It was just silly and unnecessary and took me completely out of the movie and the experience.

I tried to like this one, and I almost made it, but the bad choices by the writer/director kept it from reaching even mediocre status.",1383004800,,4980,4.67816091954023
8504747,3,B006UTDGV0,"The opening credits part of the film makes you expect that this is a great movie. Some clips on the early part of the film is a waste and pretty much does not have any significance to it other than a filler. The reason of the 3 star rating is due to the middle of the film where you will really get some chills. SPOILER ALERT!!! While they were looking for  a way out, it was freaking morning and bright, they did not even notice that the air conditioner in the window can be removed or dismantled. Only if they did not show that air conditioner unit then it would have made more sense.

You'll pretty much enjoy the film until the end. The ending is jaw dropping. You'll forget that you have been watching a ""horror"" themed movie. The ending to me was like ""Say what?!?!?"". It was good until it became government experiment conspiracy kind of thing.

An OK movie if you don't have anything to watch like I did. Amazon does not have a 2.5 stars so I chose 3 stars. My rating for this movie is really between ""I DON'T LIKE IT"" AND ""IT'S OK"".

The Good: No background music much and even without that bgm in the background, it delivered a chill at some point.

The Bad: The ending! The jaw dropping transition from a soft porn to horror theme and to a government experiment kind of thing.",1380585600,,1286,4.275720164609053
8504748,3,B006UTDGV0,"this is a decent attempt for a low budget film (i hope it was low budget). if you've seen every horror movie out there this is definitely not a good one, but it is one to watch if you've run out. i agree on too much stupid jump scares that lead nowhere, and that storyline has been repeated again and again, but hell you wouldn't watch this if you didn't want something mindly entertaining. i guess in comparison its that ridiculous plain boring pop song playing on the radio, but you like listening to it because its catchy. and trust me there is much worse. this one at least has decent ""B"" grade acting and enough plot to make you wonder what's goin on and finish the movie and be like, ok cool. this is definitely better than say, the repetative paranormal activity movies, but im sure you know that doesn't say much. but if you watched this, then you've seen all those, and you'll come out more entertained by this.

spoiler alert: sorta do wish ending was different. tho it did made sense, it was blah. i was hoping that the people interrogating the guy were really ghosts and he woke up as a prisoner in the asylum. the real ending was logical, attempt to be different which it was, but ended up being more boring. the predictive one which i mentioned would of been boring in predictable and used before, but better than unique but done obviously crappier than the rest of the movie.",1367971200,2,1390,4.4296875
8504749,3,B006UTDGV0,I thought it was pretty good. Some good scares but was not crazy about the ending. Pretty creepy overall....worth a watch.,1361059200,,122,4.857142857142857
8504750,1,B006UTDGV0,"How many bad rip offs, and sequels can one movie produce? Typical B-Movie. Talentless actors, naked girls, cheesy storyline. The scariest part of this movie, is when they're walking in and see a snake. The ending makes no sense whats so ever. It was as if they writer ran out of material. So he just pulled something out of his A*s. And if you had any doubt about it being a rip off of Paranormal Activity. They say the phrase ""Paranormal Activity"" ateast 5 times within the first 15mins. Look elsewhere. This movie is not even worth the price of shipping.",1344556800,,556,4.514851485148514
8504751,4,B006UTDGV0,"It wasn't the greatest film in the world but at least they had the guts to try something different. I like the ending. I don't really understand what the other reviewers are saying. The ending is really cool. The girl at the end is especially awesome. Anyway, if you like ghost stories and hauntings give it a chance.",1341878400,,317,4.482758620689655
8504752,1,B006UTDGV0,"I just wasted nearly an hour and a half of my life on this film. Paranormal Incident takes after movies like Paranormal Activity and the Blair Witch Project in that it uses portable cameras wielded by actors (in addition to stationary cameras within the  insane asylum where the movie takes place). It does this to quite poor effect unfortunately, as the film experience is clumsy and confusing. The story itself seems  to be an interesting premise (college students go to the asylum to study paranormal activity), but the movie just isn't scary. I saw this for free on a popular film streaming service, and I still think it was a waste of time. Somebody would have to pay ME to watch this movie. The ending is the worst part, and it will leave your mouth gaping open not in fear, but rather in disbelief at how horrible and the confusing the story line is.",1341532800,5,857,4.558441558441558
8504753,1,B006UTDGV0,"Acting bad, editing bad, everything bad.  How can a place that's been closed up for 60 years be clean? No reason to watch this movie.  Don't waste your time.",1341360000,2,157,4.379310344827586
8504754,5,B006UTDGV0,"A mass suicide took place in a sanitarium and its doors were closed and locked. Sixty years later, a group of six college students venture into the asylum, aiming to capture footage of the ghosts, totally convinced of its paranormal activity within the walls. The Nightmare begins as five of the students were Missing, and the lone survivor had to go on his own mission to find out why his friends disappeared,and if dead, who killed them. Are the other students found, and is this the action of a haunting from the past to clear one's name? The viewer is taken on a roller-coaster ride through a terrifying journey with intense suspense from start to finish. The drama continues right to the end. Chilling to the bone, scary, and mysterious. Acting performance Superb and Special Effects. Highly Recommended for all thriller and paranormal lovers!",1341100800,2,848,4.895833333333333
