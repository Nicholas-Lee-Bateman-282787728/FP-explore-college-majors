i grew up watching this cartoon

i would gladly pay 400..00 for  both box sets
but not 400 for a sigle box set
i1 am totally disappointed  you people allow this to happen",1511827200,,256,3.9411764705882355

7976811,4,B00007GZWK,"Very good, plays very well, sound is good, etc.  Don't try to copy it though, it is very difficult to do so.  One would think that at these prices you should be able to make a copy for yourself, at least . . .",1364515200,,209,3.727272727272727
7976812,5,B00007GZWK,"This is volume two of one of my favorite cartoons as a kid! This is the remaining 26 episodes of the original series. You can find this cheaper if you look around. The transfers are very good for an old show. If you like Gigantor,this is a must have!",1174348800,3,250,4.122448979591836
7976813,4,B00007GZWK,"Like one of the past reviewers wrote, I too used to run home from school to see Gigantor on channel 11 & then on chennel 9 WOR in NY. When I saw that these cartoons were available in DVD, I had to buy it not for myself, but for my son. (ok...mostly for myself) Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed. Yeah the DVD sound isn't great, but just heighten the volume on your T.V set and you'll be fine. Don't be cheap and settle for the less expensive VHS because you WILL REGRET IT! The tape will eventually get coroded and you will have to buy the DVDs anyway to keep on seeing this amazing cartoon! My son who is turning 5, ABSOLUTELY LOVES this cartoon. At first, I told him we were only going to watch just the first 2, but we ended up seeing all 7 episodes on the first DVD. He just can't wait to see the other ones, even telling me the order that he wants to see them! I can only say that if it brings this much pleasure to my son, and myself included, it can only bring happiness to you and your son or maybe just yourself. I am a fan of the older cartoons because they didn't bring with them, the ultra-violent messages that today's cartoons bring. Not to mention also, how the CARTOON NETWORK has demoralized and dirtied, such great cartoons as Space Ghost, Birdman and a Johnny Quest-like cartoon that I can't remember the name. They have made these cartoons pornographic after 12 a.m. & calling it ""swim cartoons"". Not sure why the cartoon network went this route, but needless to say, it no longer is a channel for kids and DEFINITELY not watched by my son. This channel's cartoons are geared towards the teenagers and even some young adults in their late teens or early 20's, due to the content of the ""cartoon"". Just remember who was watching Samurai Jack & why for a time, it had a cult following. This is why cartoons such as Gigantor, Speed Racer, Marine Boy, Kimba the White Lion will always be remembered as great cartoons! I doubt very much that you will be saying the same thing for Pokemon or Yuh ghe oh or Satch bell, 20 years from now. Even my son had to ask, ""daddy where did they come up with the name Yu Ghe Oh or Satch Bell? I wanted to say it was batch of bad drugs, but remember, this is a 5 year old boy that was asking this question! Anyway, I highly recommend the entire set of the Gigantor series and the entire set of Speed racer. I own the first 26 episodes of Gigantor & the first 23 episodes of Speed Racer and I'm just glued to the TV like a little kid again, along with my son. If you have a child or if you are looking to be a child once more, I urge you to buy the Gigantor series. Believe me, you WON'T regret it!",1140307200,3,2652,4.171539961013646
7976814,5,B00007GZWK,"This is Gigantor, a 1900's B&W Anime show, this was a great show, Even though I've never saw the show itself I like the commercials and Cartoon Network is bringing back ""Gi-Gan-Tor"" on DVD, so even your parents might remember this show. This is suitable for all ages!",1046044800,3,267,4.583333333333333
