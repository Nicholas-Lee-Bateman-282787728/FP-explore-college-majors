Dr. Johanson leads us thru human evolution honestly...with the humility to tell us he doesn't have all the answers and the whole story can change as new discoveries are unearthed.  Plus, it has been my great fortune to meet and visit with Don and he is so unlike the typical professor...very down to earth and fun!  This 3 hour Nova series should be your first step to a greater understanding of our distant anscestors.  I recommend it highly!",1206489600,,671,4.558333333333334
