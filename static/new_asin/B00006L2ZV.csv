7970940,1,B00006L2ZV,"This product is not worth the paper its packaged in. While the DVD is well produced, the lessons are superficial at best. Its only one hour and the instructor gives little instruction. He assumes you already know what you are doing. Plus, the accompanying written songs are so poorly presented its almost laughable. They include a sheet of paper with the tabs, which are poorly written and difficult to read. For the price I was expecting a nicely printed booklet with lyrics, music and tabs. What I got was a piece of crap. Save your money. I wouldn't recommend this to ANYONE, regardless of their guitar experience or ability.",1337212800,,628,4.770642201834862
