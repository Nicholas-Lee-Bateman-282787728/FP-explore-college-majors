7913760,4,B00000JWW2,"Strip Search has 24 girls, and this Playboy DVD goes down the list of them like we're at the Indianapolis 500. Also, this DVD has something to offend (or, to less-than-impress) almost everyone. It doesn't have much pink (to offend the pinkophiles), and it's loaded with women with fake tits, women who go for the tan-white-parts thing, and women with tatoos, three things I'm less than impressed with.
  The tan-white-parts thing is the notion that a girl goes out in the sun and gets sunburned like crazy and gets a tan, and then it's supposed to be sooo sexy to see the white parts of her where her bikini tops and bottoms used to be.
  It starts out with our host Lexus asking us, ""What makes stripping sexy to you....?"" And then she goes down a list of a few things, but what is conspicuously absent from her list is the very things that I just mentioned....
  Still, there were a number of things I liked about this DVD. It is a realistic, accurate and technically very well done view of strippers in strip clubs.
  There were a few strippers that I did like. Rayveness
was the prettiest one of all, and she was the one that I liked most of all. She was one of the three or four that was natural, and she purposely was jiggling her tits to drive home the point that she was natural. She was apparently the winner of the ""Night Calls Fax Girl Challenge"", whatever that's supposed to be; and she appeared in ""Risque Business"", which makes me want to see it. I also liked Tracy, Taryn Steel, Alexandra Silk, and
Holly Montana.
  Holly Montana (who was Miss Nude World) was the only one of my favorites who apparently had implants, but she had the best music, and she had the most entertaining dance, partly because the camera work was so well done when she was on stage.
I was tapping my feet to her music, and looking at her out of the corner of my eye, as I was looking up in the dictionary how to spell ""Indianapolis"".
  The camera work with Rayveness didn't have quite as much light and wasn't done as well; so, unfortunately, I wasn't able to enjoy Rayveness's dance as well as I enjoyed Holly's.
It's interesting to note that both Rayveness and Holly Montana were in the Nashville section of the DVD, so those good ol' boys down South are really getting a good deal with their women.
  It's interesting to note that one of these other reviewers mentioned there was editing done; and, you know, that's something that I was wondering about myself.
There were a few girl-on-girl features, and the girls seemed to pretend to suck on each other (or maybe they had just finished doing it, or they were about to do it), but it seemed like it could've been an awful lot more explicit than it was, and I was wondering: ""What's to pretend? Just do it and don't worry about it."" So, if there was major editing (not having seen the original tv version), some of these girl-on-girl segments would be my candidates for what was probably edited out.
  I could recommend this DVD, because people will have an idea what's out there in the stripping & strip club world.
But I wish Playboy would deemphasize the fake tits, and I wish Playboy would stop making it seem like women should go out and get sunburns, etc., for tanning isn't good for the skin. When Playboy goes out to these strip clubs, they should set up a booth with a nurse, and hand out phamplets cautioning against tanning, and Playboy should hand out free bottles of sunscreen.",1208217600,,3433,4.4688

In fact, I was very surprised.  Anyway, if you like strippers, this one is worth a look.",1154563200,3,252,4.340425531914893
