4016091,5,B002ZCY81S,"Update: I just watched the season finale, episode 10.  This series remained top notch from first to last.  I really hope there is another season.  I can't recommend the series highly enough. Below is the original review:

I am five episodes into this series and am absolutely knocked out.  The acting on this new series is absolutely superb and is equalled by the scripts.  I could never get into Ray Romano in his EVERYONE LOVES RAYMOND show despite its being an enormous hit.  Unlike that show, this is NOT a comedy although it has wryly comic moments. The premise is three guys in their late 40s who grew up together and have stayed together as friends their entire lives. Two of them are white and one is black. I grew up in a family business so the black character, spending his life in his father's car business, is the best story for me.  The actor does a superb job with the tensions inherent in working for your father, a former pro sports hero. He is also the only one who can hold down a marriage.  Ray Romano plays the one soon to be divorced primarily because of his gambling addiction. He owns a party store with lots of games, fittingly enough. This gambling addiction takes a fascinating script detour when he spends an entire evening in the company of his bookie as his friend for the night while his wife is out on a date. The third guy is the ladies man, a never made it actor who now tries out other occupations like some people try out new ties.  I like him the least of the three but that may be the point of including him. You are going to want to see this show, every episode.  I can hardly wait for episode six.

4016158,5,B002ZCY81S,"Plain and simple - This is a great show. Deals with reality , drama and comedy all mixed into one. The only down fall I have is with Ray Romano who I happen to think is a lousy actor. Other than that I love the show. Can't figure out why TNT bagged it after 2 seasons.",1407110400,,268,3.8035714285714284
4016159,5,B002ZCY81S,"I bought this because I thought Scott Bakula did a great job playing ""Captain Jonathan Archer""
on the decade-old 98-episode TV series ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" (the best most realistic of all
the Star Trek TV series offerings in my humble opinion... check it out on Netflix)... and I also
enjoy the comedy of Ray Romano on the classic old sitcom ""Everyone Loves Raymond"".
I was not as familiar with the work of the third co-star, Andre Braugher.

To my surprise, I discovered that the actor I was not familiar with, Andre Braugher, turned out to
be perhaps the most interesting of the three characters in this TV show, (though all three of
these actors do a fine job).  This ""slice-of-life"" comedy / drama is some of the best TV I have
seen in a long time.  There is no laugh-track... it's not a ""sitcom""... it's just good, compelling,
believable, intriguing TV... which is rarely seen today.

I am in my mid-forties, and although I cannot personally relate to any of these three characters
because none of them are anything like me; I nevertheless really enjoy seeing them deal with
the obstacles of their respective late-forties lives and mid-life crisis situations.  Great actors.
Great scripts.  Truly enjoyable TV-watching.  My wife also enjoys this TV series.... it is not just
a show that only men would like.  I wish there were more of this style of quality, realistic,
intriguing, not-overly-dramatic, window-into-their-world style of TV programming available.",1406505600,4,1467,4.983606557377049

4016161,5,B002ZCY81S,So bummed this only lasted a couple seasons. Quality television.  Good for watching one show at a time or a couple given the length- about 45 minutes/each.,1400371200,,155,4.7407407407407405

4016193,5,B002ZCY81S,"As the description says ""a bracingly honest comedy-drama about the joys and pitfalls of middle age.""...The show ""Men of a Certain Age"" was a wonderful show about 3 middle aged guys that have been friends for some time... each with different strengths and issues... very different in some ways but compatible in others... just great characters and situations... I am really sad that it only lasted 2 seasons as I would love to see where it would have gone with the characters.  Contains deleted scenes and commentaries that are very entertaining as well.",1392249600,,553,4.946236559139785

4016198,5,B002ZCY81S,this came so close to being a terrific series. they dropped the ball in the second half of the series and destroyed season two.  so disappointed. worth watching once and never again.  they had so much to work with and never developed the characters completely.  what a shame.,1377734400,,275,4.6875

4016200,5,B002ZCY81S,"This was a great series. I'm from the baby boomer generation and can no longer identify with shows dealing with male, under 30, problems. This hits the mark. And while they ocassionally get laid, the show doesn't revolve around their penises either ( female shows like ""Girls' and ""Cougar Town"" tend to be about their vagina's and the women themselves are just props). Each week there are three separate stories that come together at the end

  Casting was great but the producers went out of the way to make the show disinteresting (short broken seasons) andstill it gets 5 stars.

  I reserved the second season and got it the day it came out (amazon) and am equally pleased with that

  I like many others I'm sure would love for another network to pick up and run with this beauty",1364083200,3,784,4.58273381294964
4016201,5,B002ZCY81S,"My wife and I have just finished watching episode one of season two. We love this show and were hooked after season one.
We cannot understand how this show could be cancelled after two seasons. It is smart, witty, charming,real, indeed everything we want a show to be. It truly entertains us and we are sure it entertains a lot of you. So why does it get cancelled? Our theory is that it is because it's about men and the women don't really want to think about the men. So cancel - it's no good. Better ( they think ) to have the men be like Joey and Ross in Friends, or Ray in ELR, or Douglas in King of Queens, - stupid men , all of them. It's such a shame we - my wife and I - won't be able to enjoy this wonderful series past season two. Damn you suits.",1363996800,,757,3.954248366013072

4016233,5,B002ZCY81S,"This series is an example of what talent and passion can achieve. Ray Romano turned out to be far more than a sitcom guy, he is in fact an extraordinary actor even better at drama than he is at comedy. His character is Joe Tranelli, a recently divorced middle age ""deer in the headlights"" guy with an addiction to gambling, a monster teenage girl and a boy with anxiety problems. The details of his life are shown in both realistically and funny ways without derailing from their dramatic drive.

I could go on and on with praise for Ray Romano and the rest of the cast, but it is Andre Braugher who stands out. This man truly made me feel for his character (and someone needs to apologize to him for not giving him an Emmy for this role). The acting, the painfully yet funny realistic approach to life, everything about this series is sublime.",1361491200,,844,4.445161290322581
4016234,5,B002ZCY81S,"This was an absolutely great show that was cancelled before its time. Anyone who watched it loved it yet the 'geniuses' who make these decisions didn't give it enough of a chance to find its audience. Truly baffling. I wish someone would pick it up and resurrect it. Until then, we will have to settle for the DVDs.

If you never saw it, buy both seasons, grab a six pack and sit back and enjoy the intelligent writing, realistic plots and terrific acting.",1360108800,,456,4.493975903614458
4016235,5,B002ZCY81S,"I loved the inside peek into middle aged men's minds, lives, hopes and dreams. These strong, likable, complex characters were written with vulnerability, flaws, immaturity... warts and all. They were real people like you and me and I cheered for their victories and groaned at their dumb mistakes.

Romano did a great job showing acting chops over straight comedy and you can't go wrong with Andre Braugher if you're talking power acting. Scott Bakula's character just charmed the pants off viewers and as he grew up to be a real man, it was heartening to see. The female characters were interesting and complicated, too. They drove the men nuts, saved their butts, stood by them at the crucial times and were real compliments to the main characters.

The storylines were easy to follow, but compelling. I was excited to see how Romano's character would deal with the gambling addiction, Braugher's character would handle owning the business and Bakula would fair in a real relationship. All these men were poised to live out real dreams in real ways. I was excited for season 3 to begin. I thought it was a really balanced show that deserved more of a shot then it got. I was bummed when the show was canceled. With all the garbage out there, reality tv I'm talking to you, this show got canned? Boo!",1356652800,2,1301,4.726872246696035
4016236,5,B002ZCY81S,"I arrived to this show AFTER it had been cancelled. I had finished watching all Nine Seasons of Everybody Loves Raymond and was left with wanting to see more of Ray Romano aside from the Ice Age movies. Netflix did not have this television series so I went to Blockbuster online and found the First Season. I am considering buying the two seasons of this series because it is really an exceptional TV show. I found the characters to be real, and as many other people here have commented, I too found myself wanting to meet these guys in real life and wanting to sit down and get to know them. At the time of writing this first review, I have only seen the first disc (five episodes) of the first season. I am currently waiting on the second and last disc of the first season to arrive by mail after I mail this disc off.

The key characters I write about in this review are: Joe Tranelli played by Ray Romano, Joe's ex-wife, Sonia Tranelli played by Penelope Ann Miller, Owen Thoreau played by Andre Braugher, Owen's wife Melissa Thoreau played by Lisa Gay Hamilton, and Terry Elliot played by Scott Bakula.

At various times while watching the first disc, I found myself crying at several instances, particularly when Joe, finds out about his wife's cheating while they were still living together before they split up. Joe takes it in stride when Owen tells him about it but one can see the hurt in his eyes and maybe fighting the urge to cry. When Owen finds out about Sonia's cheating, he takes it the worse out of the three men and that too delivers it home as the painful and emotional experience it is in real life when one finds out about the betrayal of their best friend's spouse; one gets angry for them.

Owen also has emotional scenes that brought me to tears, such as confronting his father about how he is treated at work and his father saying he is an embarrassment to his company which brings Owen to angry tears or how he has to deal with yet another personal and financial set back when he and his wife Melissa find out that the contractor they hired is unlicensed and now the city has shut down all construction on their home's addition leaving them temporarily homeless and having to go stay with Owen's parents. How would any of us act under those circumstances when you're ready to throw up your arms and quit your job and now you have to go live with ""your boss"", the same guy that's making your life miserable at work and also happens to be your own father?

Terry also has some personal breakthroughs with regards to his single lifestyle when he turns down the opportunity to get back for one night with a woman he had seen previously but since then has gotten engaged. Terry flirts with her and pretty much gives the woman a chance to step out on her fiance as she must think, ""It won't hurt anyone as long as he doesn't find out"". This is apparent when she tells him in a hushed way to meet her after a school function because quote, ""People talk"". She tells him to follow her in his car to meet up at another place for drinks. Having learned about Sonia stepping out on Joe way before they split up through Owen, Terry decides he does not want to be ""that guy"" that's responsible for someone's wife/girlfriend cheating since Owen took learning about Sonia's cheating so badly, so Terry takes a right instead of a left at a light and decides not to follow the woman for drinks after all.

The scenes are real and it is such a shame to learn that the show got cancelled. Maybe now as the show is watched by more people through Blockbuster or Netflix it may go back into production as it might now have the necessary fan base needed to keep the show on the air if they decide to carry it again.

I have a theory about the show's cancellation: it happened towards the end of the worse economic disaster since the Great Depression and I suspect a great many people were not in the mood to watch TV like before as they may not have had free time to sit back and enjoy the TV watching experience. Maybe a great many people decided to instead focus their attention to financial matters such as finding work or making sure they did not lose their homes. My husband (and now my ex-husband) was one of the many that lost their jobs in 2008 and then we faced eviction. It took him almost two years to find a permanent job from bouncing from temporary job to another and having had a ten month unemployment period. I can say I was not in the mood to watch TV like I had before all of this happened. Another great many people most likely cancelled their cable as they could not afford the bill anymore. I am one of those people. They had to do away with ""unnecessary expenses"". I have watched Netflix exclusively now since 2010. This may be why there was a lower watcher turnout compared to the First Season. I wish the people responsible for cancelling the show could take another look at it and reconsider bringing it back. That, or Ray Romano should look into taking the show directly to Netflix and this would guarantee a large viewer-ship.",1351987200,,5058,4.40427807486631
4016237,5,B002ZCY81S,"The three main characters compliment each other, bringing out the humour in this series of male friendship. It is not often, we see male bonding but this series is just plain fun. Excellent real life dialog that captures the feelings and emotions of male friendship. A must own for anyone who is a fan of these three actors.",1351900800,,324,4.603448275862069
4016238,5,B002ZCY81S,This was one of the finest shows on TV EVER!  I am still so sad that it has been cancelled.  I am anxiously awaiting for Season Two to come out on DVD.,1347667200,,151,3.6875
4016239,5,B002ZCY81S,"I had no idea this show even existed until long after its network run ended. I can totally relate to this show because I'm at the stage of my life where these guys are. I love how the characters are developed. They're all very real, with just the right amount of real humanity, no underplaying or overexaggeration. I can't recommend this show highly enough, especially to those like me who are staring down the prospect of middle age.",1327795200,,434,4.576923076923077
4016240,5,B002ZCY81S,"I love this show! The characters are all very ""real"" and believable, and Ray Romano's humor shows through brilliantly. Definitely hope for many seasons to come!",1326758400,,160,5.1923076923076925
4016241,5,B002ZCY81S,"I believe the writing of this show is brilliant and to be able to pick 3 people carefully to take on this type of show and make is successful is hard to do these days. I think the network did a great injustice taking this show off the air.

I was really excited to hear Ray Ramono, Scott Bakula, and Andre Braugher were in the same series. I am a big fan of Everybody Loves Raymond, Homiside, Enterprise and Quantum Leap.  I was very curious how all three of them would interact in this type of series. Wow, what a trio. It is comedy,drama,candidness, all wrapped up in one. You can relate to each character on an everyday basis. This is a realistic show, where it does not hide anything.  There are raw feelings throughout the show, which you can feel sad, about to laugh, or relate to what is going on. I am truly impressed.

I really enjoyed watching Everybody Loves Raymond, but this performance by Ray really gives us a glimpse on how talented he is.  Andre also delivers another amazing performance! I was not sure about Scott's role since I am watching Quantum Leap which is the opposite of Scott's role in MOACA. However, Scott is able to bring it to the table and do also another amazing job. These guys have all done a performance of a lifetime!!

I wish the network would reconsider!!!",1324339200,,1296,4.42436974789916
4016282,5,B002ZCY81S,"MEN OF A CERTAIN AGE is an intelligent, witty, warm and often insightful comedy/drama about three middle aged male friends.  I honestly can't recall another drama existing that seriously took the time to look realistically at the lives of men this age.  The three men - recently divorced Joe (Ray Romano), married car dealer Owen (Andre Braugher) and single faded actor Terry (Scott Bakula) are all very human and believable characters.  We get to enter their lives each week and share the trials and tribulations they encounter.  Sometimes funny, often heartbreaking and always relatable this excellently written and directed drama will appeal to everyone and not just men of this age for its issues are universal.  The true credit to the show goes to the superb acting done by all three leads.  Andre Braugher is getting deserved attention and has been nominated for an Emmy for each season of this show but for me the true revelation is Ray Romano.  Ray Romano of course achieved huge success on EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND and I think though believable and lovable in the part many thought it was the common stand up comedian having a series, the same as Jerry Seinfeld.  But here his sitcom character is quickly forgotten as he embodies the character of Joe.  He is slightly neurotic and insecure as he tries to deal with life as a divorced man.  And every action and step his character takes is even more belivable due to the depth of Romano's performance.

Of course I don't mean to belittle either of the other leads and each viewer will probably have a favorite.  Great news in that there are no weak links here.  The supporting cast is also superb with the stand out for me being Lisa Gay Hamilton as Owen's wife Melissa.  Bottom line, this series is exceptional and brings a breath of fresh air to tv.  I highly recommend it.",1316390400,2,1832,4.716981132075472
4016283,5,B002ZCY81S,"Both my husband and myself enjoyed this series very much.  We were not able to watch on TV, so ordered both seasons on DVD.  Sad it was discontinued.",1316131200,,149,4.285714285714286
4016284,4,B002ZCY81S,"Joe, Owen and Terry, three middle-aged men struggling with their lives.
I like this story. Script is funny and real-life.
But this item I buyed is weird, two DVD are in reverse order.
Actually, the first is the second and the second is the first.
I enjoyed it any way.",1315180800,,268,4.38
4016285,5,B002ZCY81S,"My initial reaction to ""Men Of A Certain Age"" was that Ray Romano liked what Larry David did with ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", and decided to get a couple of friends together and have some fun with a sparsely scripted sitcom and some hand-held camera.
However, this series has great back-story combined with underlying plot development which really brings it life.

As the character of Ray Barone has become so indelibly imprinted on the minds of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" viewers, it actually takes a little while to get accustomed to Romano's character, Joe Tranelli, a recently-separated father of two teenagers, owner of a party goods store and a would-be golf pro with a slight gambling problem. You can hear the stories unfolding already can't you, and that's just Joe. Wait till you meet his buddies, Owen and Terry.

Although each episode is self-contained, the unfolding personal stories which backdrop each episode, begin to kick in a much more defined character study which soon had me  hooked.

The scenarios are not as off-the-wall as ELR was, with the family-crazy intensity that drove that series. This is more laid back, and therefore more true to life. The humour is less telegraphed, more mature, which makes sense  considering the series' name and the age of its creator and main protagonist.

It took a couple of episodes to really warm to the characters and the story line(s), probably due to ELR-based expectation. Once you adjust to the more real-world scenarios, peopled by real-world style participants, the humour mixes well with the dramatic story lines which leads to an enjoyable television experience, and one which harks back to certain radio shows of the 1950's.

Depending on what you liked about ELR, you may or may not take to this. MOACA is reality-based, subtle and mature. The writing is excellent and all the actors seem to be really into their roles, playing the irony straight, with great results.

I'm rating this 5 stars mainly because it not only ticks all the boxes, but doesn't herald itself as a 5-star production, which is worth a star in itself.",1314489600,,2089,4.948571428571428

Ray Romano is fabulous as are Scott Bakula & Andre Braugher. Five stars for the series, however, two stars for the release.
  First off, the labels on the two discs are reversed,the disc labeled disc 1 is actually disc 2.
  Where was the source aquired for the video release for Season 1? The video is very distorted, not the quality on DVD releases that we as consumers are used to purchasing...I hate to say it guys this almost looks like a BOOTLEG DVD set, what gives.
  Maybe someone @ TNT can have a reponse to this and get the picture quality corrected before Season 2 is released on DVD!
  If the video problem ever gets corrected on Season 1, would someone @ TNT kindly let the fans (and we are many) of the wonderful series know.",1313539200,4,897,4.266272189349112
4016288,5,B002ZCY81S,"Ray Romano, Andre Braugher and Scott Bakula star as three longtime friends facing the various dilemmas of families, jobs, dating and getting older.

Joe (Romano) is a recently divorced father of two, struggling to re-establish himself in the world of dating, all the while trying to stay connected with his teens and their varying issues, as well as keeping his party shop business afloat. Owen (Braugher) is happily married with three small children, though the biggest source of anguish in his life is relationship with his former basketball player father - now his boss at a local car dealership. Conversely, Terry (Bakula) is a perpetual womanizer, never committing to either a relationship or a real job as he strives to establish his career as an actor.

Co-stars include Lisa Gay Hamilton as Owen's wife Melissa, and Carla Gallo as Terry's girlfriend Annie.

Episodes mix the perfect blend of seriousness and humor - just like real life - as the three friends navigate their daily hurdles.

4016290,5,B002ZCY81S,"I absolutely love this new comedy! It's about time that an hour-long comedy program presented midlife issues from a man's perspective. These three guys are terrific together! One is married, one divorced, and one who's never been married yet - with this in mind, they are covering ALL the issues that life at mid-life can throw anyone. They're great friends though their personalities are different. Ray Romano, for example, IS his character no matter what show he is in. He just must be that layback, easy-going, goofy kind of character in real life!  The other two actors were new to me when I began watching the show, but I soon grew very close to them. I enjoy seeing how men deal with the same issues that women encounter at that particular time of life...it's so common to see shows, movies, read books & articles, and be deluged with how women handle their problems. Men have somehow been tucked away in the unknown regions when it comes to things like that. I'm so glad this show has come out and taken upon itself to show how men handle life - the good, the bad, the highs and the lows - and include (as this show does) some terrific comedy and great lines between these guys.

For anyone who hasn't seen this show yet - I encourage you wholeheartedly - WATCH IT! You won't regret it!  I got hooked on these characters and their storylines quick! A wonderfully realistic and funny show!",1310688000,,1395,4.572
4016291,5,B002ZCY81S,"Tale focuses on three guys all pushing 50 who have known one another since their college days. I'd say one of the biggest themes is a combination of things not going as expected (one is recently divorced b/c of his gambling addiction; another is trying to make it as an actor; and the other is working for his father and hating it) and trying to go down the right path of life yet things don't work out so what do you do then? The overall chemistry between these three characters (all played by very good or better actors) makes the show work. No chemistry and no humor between three guys and this show would be dead in the water. The overall authenticity of real life problems and how they are dealt with makes this particular TV show refreshing. Some of the supporting characters, like the bookie
and Ray's imaginary son, truly stand out. I discovered this show while running on the elliptic at my gym (they have a bunch of TVs on the wall).  People on a budget can watch a few free episodes at the TNT site.

4016340,5,B002ZCY81S,"Besides an excellent cast an an equally good supporting cast, this show has quality writing and production.  The characters and their dialogue are ordinary yet interesting.  I care about the characters and what happens to them.  It's realistic in how it portrays life's victories and how they are often balanced out by life's setbacks (and vice versa).

Of the three main characters, its Andre Braugher who stands out as Owen, who at middle age is beginning to realize that working for his Daddy all these years may have damaged him and kept him from realizing his full potential.  All three main characters fight similar truths as Ray Romano's Joe struggles with a gambling addiction that contributed to the break-up of his family, and Scott Bakula's Terry begins to see that time is catching up fast to his twenty-something lifestyle.

I am a ""Man of a Certain Age"" myself and lately I find myself being more particular about how I spend my time.  I can easily say that watching this show is time well spent.  Kudos to all involved, particularly Romano who handles the serious side of his role with casual ease and whose behind the scenes creativity obviously propels this show to greatness.",1308873600,3,1193,4.842364532019705

First of all, it's bad enough we don't get a Blu-Ray release of this. Then the DVD picture quality is also quite bad, much worse than the TV broadcasts. Then they also choose the letterbox format, where on a widescreen TV you not only have black bars on the left and right, but also on top and bottom. Bottom line: It's looks horrible. I hope somwhere on the internet i can still find those 720p downloads, because you are far better of watching those on your PC, you can also hook that up to your TV.

that show up  on tv and you think, ""No one would ever act like that or say that.""  While there is comedy on the show, it isn't a situation comedy at all. It's just a little slice of life that most of us can understand and identify with. I just wish it was on a net work that most people had a chance to see. I only found it because I was watching Letterman and Ray was a guest. I made the effort to find the show. And it does take that but is well worth your trouble. I don't think you have to be 40 something to enjoy & 'get' the show. It's a show about friendship & support and gives a great insight into the male brain..this show gets it right..no contrived dialog & plots.. I think if it were on any of the three major networks, it would get Emmys for writing and acting.  I'm not sure why it has been ignored so far by the Emmy people.

4016348,5,B002ZCY81S,"I love this show.  Somehow I missed the first year and only picked it up 1 episode into the 2nd season, but getting the first year on DVD made it all fall into place. You could almost call this a ""sex in the city for men"" as it's about 3 long time buddies entering the middle age ""crisis zone"" and dealing with the sort of stuff that happens;  divorce, gambling addictions, familial disputes between fathers and sons, but with a moral code of what can happen when you tempt fate a bit too often.  It's about bad habits and how they manage to catch up with you and about how sometimes you can do everything right and still have a less than satisfactory outcome. It's also about how these 3  re-evaluate their lives, make the course corrections, and..... I guess we won't know until the series' finale.

We  don't easily recognize that there's two parts to life. The first part is easy; you just have to learn the simple stuff of how to play nice with others, get an education, have some fun, pick out a trade and a mate and settle into what you think life is about. That part stops when you think you've got all the answers.  Part 2 is about how that stuff doesn't always work.... and that's, in the end, what this show is all about. Oh, and by the way, it's outrageously funny.",1294963200,3,1277,4.317991631799163

Men of a Certain Age was so much better than I could have hoped.  As a woman I watched with interest as my partner started watching the DVD with me (I live in Australia and we do not get the show down here).  He was into it immediately and said to me you have finally purchased something that I can relate to.  I was surprised but happy because I have been trying to purchase something that he would enjoy as much as I do.  Anyway getting back to the show the storyline following these men as they confront normal problems (handled in such an interesting way) is a joy to watch.  I believe that Season Two has twenty two episodes.  If that is the case then roll on because I have watched Season One several times and I am counting down the days until Season Two is out on DVD.

4016392,5,B002ZCY81S,"Joe Tranelli (Ray Romano), Terry Elliott (Scott Bakula), and Owen Thoreau, Jr. (Andre Braugher) have been friends forever -- or at least since college.  Now in their late forties, pushing fifty, all three find themselves in places they never thought they would be.  Sweet, funny Joe, a family man at heart, finds himself unexpectedly divorced after a gambling addiction rears its ugly head.  Terry, a struggling actor with some real talent, is still single, unable resist the lure of the audition as well as the siren call.  Owen, with a sweet wife (Lisa Gay Hamilton), three adorable kids, and an impossibly successful, arrogant ex-athlete father, wakes up each morning in a C-pap mask.  He is an overweight diabetic, trying to live up to Daddy's achievements, and haunted at every turn by the thought that he might just be an imposter.

These three friends meet several times a week for a hike (good for the blood sugar and weight) and breakfast (a la ""Sex and the City"", but thankfully we leave sex in the bedroom where it belongs, most of the time).  There, with the help of a witty and believable screenplay, they hash out their weeks' problems.  They make fun of each other (male humor), encourage each other (because at heart they are really nice guys), and sometimes solve each other's problems.

It is wonderful to see the great Andre Braugher in a venue finally befitting his talents.  He was the rivetting star on ""Homicide: Life on the Streets"" -- the one you just couldn't take your eyes off of.  He does not disappoint in this series, where his humor, honesty, and integrity as an actor can shine.  Bakula, always intriguing, does an admirable job as Terry.  He brings a humanity and self-mockery to this role of the man-child, and you can't help rooting for him.  But it is Romano who owns the show, in my opinion.  Self-deprecating, struggling, humorous as always, a man who may have lost most of what mattered to him but is holding on for dear life -- this is the character you have to love.  He does a great job as Joe, and a great job as the creator of the show.  I hope for more seasons of ""Men of a Certain Age"", because it informs all of us at any age.",1292457600,5,2174,4.576227390180879

4016395,5,B002ZCY81S,"Men of a Certain Age is the brand new TNT show from Ray Romano.  It stars Ray alongside two of televisions finest actors Scott Bakula and Andre Braugher.  The show focuses on three friends each dealing with being in their mid 40s.  It's ostensibly a drama with some lighter comedic moments thrown in.  The tone is perfect and it's very easy to feel for these characters.

Ray Romano plays Joe a recently divorced man who runs a party shop and has a gambling problem. Scott Bakula is a struggling actor finding it hard to land any new roles. Andre Braugher is working as a car salesman at his father's dealership. All three characters have compelling story lines which drive the show forward.

Two of my favorite actors of all time are Scott Bakula and Andre Braugher.  Scott Bakula was brilliant as Dr Sam Beckett leaping in and out of people each week on Quantum Leap.  Andre Braugher was a powerhouse performing as Detective Frank Pembleton on Homicide: Life on the Street. Homicide remains my favorite TV show of all time. I think both actors have struggled to find good projects since then, but they've both finally landed on a good show.

The chemistry between all the actors is fantastic.  Their lifelong friendship is very believable. The scenes between them all at the diner, hiking or at home all work well.  The person who I was truly surprised with is Ray Romano. I never considered him a great actor, he clearly is a great comedian and is now proving himself as a great writer.  His character Joe really resonates. It's a very honest performance.

Andre Braugher is an incredible actor.  He could read a phone book and I'd be glued to the screen. This is a very different role though. It was originally written for Bunk from The Wire but when David Simon required him for his new HBO show ""Treme"" Andre came in at the last minute.  I'm glad he did, he does play more comedy here than he is known for. I think Andre can do comedy just fine, there is plenty of funny scenes between Pembleton and Bayliss on Homicide as examples of that.  This is no raging Pembleton in the box though.  It's no good vs evil showdown with the intensity of an interrogation.  Even so, It's no less enjoyable.  Here Andre's character is really struggling, trying to support his wife and kids and do a job that he simply doesn't want to do.  He's a broken character so it will be interesting to see his journey over the course of the season.

Scott Bakula is another actor who can have some amazing dramatic moments.  He play's the comedy to perfection in his role.  I think the way these characters interact with the younger characters is telling.  They've already been through it all before so they look on in bemusement.  Still, Scott's character still clings to his youth and even begins dating a 25 year old.  I love the scene where he goes to an audition for a lifetime series and stands in the hall. He is surrounded by plenty of other good looking 40 year olds who are great actors. There is a sense of resignation to his situation.

This show got overlooked when it first aired but it's clearly that a new show that you should discover on DVD.  It's something different. There's not any show on TV dealing with middle age men. It's not simply about a mid-life crisis.  These are very well drawn characters,very realistic, and extremely watchable.  Give this show a chance I think if it can find an audience on DVD it has plenty of seasons left in it.",1288656000,2,3448,4.532362459546926
4016396,5,B002ZCY81S,"I starting watching Men of a Certain Age because I'll watch anything with Andre Braugher.  I didn't care much for Everybody Loves Raymond, and so wasn't interested in Ray Romano.  I've always been a fan of Scott Bakula.  Well, was I ever surprised at Ray Romano who has some real acting chops.  The show, about 3 best life-long friends, each a unique personality and character.  Ray Romano as Joe is divorced and owns a party store and has a gambling problem.  Terry is a failed actor and somewhat of a Peter Pan - he's never really grown up and taken on the responsibility of a mature adult.  Owen (Braugher) works at his father's car dealership.  His dad was once a famous basketball player, and Owen doesn't have the drive to go out on his own.  Sounds pretty dull, but these 3 guys are among the most interesting and complex people you'll see on TV.  Each has strengths and weaknesses just like the rest of us.  The show is a drama but has a great deal of humor.  I'm a woman older than the guys on the show and absolutely adore Men of a Certain Age.

Being a man in my late 30's, I find myself drawn to this show and thinking about my life in many ways.

Both men bring nuances to the characters that keep you wanting to sit down with them and get to know them better.  However, Ray Romano is simply amazing and surprising here. I didn't know he had this level of acting ability! The other surprise for me is how much my wife and teenagers love this show - you'd think from the title it is a show for middle aged men but the reality is, it is fascinating viewing for anyone with a brain.

Gone FAR too soon, Men of a Certain Age paints an extremely accurate picture of what it means to be a man and what male friendships look like as an adult.  I've never seen a show or movie that seemed to so accurately portray these friendships from the exchanges of advice to the language used between friends.

From the first episode, you will be interested in each of the three main characters, as they are all in very different situations, but are always trying to relate to each other the best they are able to.  Terry is the lifelong bachelor, Owen the family man who works for his father, and Joe, the single dad trying to navigate the murky waters of divorce while battling his own internal issues.  For a show that addresses so many situations that cause nothing but stress in real life, these three handle it all with humor, and it never comes off as fake or unrealistic.
