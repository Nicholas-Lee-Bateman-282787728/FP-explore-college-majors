4462985,5,B004SI5VVI,"If one has enjoyed the writings of John Mortimer in ""Rumpole of the Bailey"" one will certainly enjoy ""Under the Hammer"" which was also written by John Mortimer.  I really enjoyed this seven (7) episode series on two discs.  We get a peak ""behind the scenes"" at a British Auction House for fine (high end and expensive) art in London in the early 1990s.  What intrigues, drama and sexual ""goings on"" there are.

  Besides some wonderfully humorous dialog for the viewer to enjoy, there are good mysteries to be solved by the team of Ben (played greatly by Richard Wilson) and Maggie (played wonderfully by  Jan Francis) heading up the ""Fine Arts"" team and are always questioning ""is it real or fake"" uncovering extreme efforts by many characters (played by some famous British actors such as Sir John Gielgud--he's fabulous plus there are many, many more ""guests"") to ""pass off"" fakes or to just ""pull one over"" on the experts.  In addition to the ""Art Intrigues"",  there are delicious sub-plots involving the ""sexual affairs "" of Maggie and the wine Department head of the Auction House, Nick  and the ongoing affair of the chairman and his ""office gal"" that he's not married to along with his many efforts to""hide"" her.  Added to the aforesaid, Ben is secretly in love with Maggie and is very jealous of she and Nick,

All in all, I derived hours of pleasure from viewing ""Under the Hammer"" and highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys wonderfully written,  directed and acted British ""mysteries"".",1309046400,12,1499,4.785992217898833
4462986,3,B004SI5VVI,"I eagerly purchased this series after reading the glowing reviews. Even though I often enjoy British TV, this series was not to my taste. The major problem, for me, was the under use of investigative research, both academic and scientific, about the art and characters that did not engage my interest.

Richard Wilson's attempt at portraying a sophisticated Ben came off more as just an unpleasantly snide man. I could not like the character or root for him, in his attempts to romance a much younger woman.

To me, the series would be greatly improved by an almost police procedural approach to investigating the art. Very little analysis was shown. If this was meant to be a comedy, it was just not funny enough. As a mystery, the series is only passable. I find that I much prefer ""New Tricks"" in a similar TV series category.

However, the cameos, by the likes of John Gielgud, were really wonderful. To me, the guest star performances only served to accentuate what was lacking in the rest of the episode. More engaging characterizations and a more interesting treasure hunt would have been just my cup of tea.",1308960000,27,1115,4.737113402061856
4462987,5,B004SI5VVI,"Great writing (John Mortimer- Rumpole fame) and more British acting stars than Van Gogh had colors. This is a feast for the entertainment eyes, and family friendly. It's a look behind the scenes of Klinsky's Auction House, and the mysteries behind the priceless sale items, or fakes. The department heads of the firm also have a good bit of sideline romance that goes well beyond the water cooler. Plenty of sexy friction as well as drama. Also plenty of laughs. A very solid 5-stars in British Drama.

Cast is led by Maggie (Jan Francis-`Just Good Friends' `Anne of Green Gables, Avonlea') head of Old Masters dept. who's desired by painting expert Ben (Richard Wilson-`One Foot in the Grave' but never says ""I can't be-lieve it!""). Maggie is hot for wine dept head Nick (Michael Siberry-`The Grand'). Klinsky's London office Lord Bernard `Chairman' (Robert Lang) cheats with office gal Camilla (Marsha Fitzalan), & then Annabelle (Kate McKenzie-`Endgame'). Shrimsley (Stephen Boxer-`Garrows Law' `Prime Suspect') is too busy counting the company beans to get female-frisky. Receptionist Lucy (Rose Keegan-`Lilies' `Harry Potter') dizzily dreams of acting.

And then the GUEST STARS begin to appear profusely in each episode. Many stars are not even recognized as such on the box or in the credits, just listed as a cast member. Many are noted below in the episode details (without spoilers).
7 Episodes, about 51 minutes each, all with SUBTITLES provided.
Bonus is a text bio of Mortimer, the AMAZING writer.
Rated perhaps PG (?) with plenty of adultery and bed shots but everyone covered. General family entertainment, but content likely more young adult and older.

THE FATAL ATTRIBUTION== A suspicious but potential Bronzino (1500s) oil gets the Old Masters dept thrilled and off to solving the mystery behind the art brought by Sarah Napper (Susan Wooldridge). Another expert, Hugo (John Gielgud-`Six Centuries of Verse' `Brideshead Revisited') is called to help. Romantic subplots also go up for bid at London Klinsky's.

WONDERS IN THE DEEP== Lord Bertie's wine cases are tossed into the lake by his tea-total wife. Valuable bottles offered for sale at Klinsky's leaves Ben suspect of love-rival Nick's find. Wine and a silver antique get the mystery investigation moving. Are the old items for real? In-house hormones rage on.

THE VIRGIN OF VITEBSK== Potential for a Moscow Klinsky's office is the exploratory trip reason by Ben & Maggie. Is this Ben's romantic opportunity to hit on Maggie? A resurfaced icon and a tour guide create a Russian block. Angela (Emily Mortimer-`Coming Home' `A Dance to the Music of Time' & writer Mortimer's daughter) is traveling in Moscow chaperoned by Batty (Judy Cornwell-`Keeping up Appearances'). A Russian gallery lady, Olga (Rosalie Crutchley-`Anglo Saxon Attitudes') knows something about the icon art piece.

THE JOLLY JOKER== Chairman of Klinsky's may have been taken when he purchased from a modern artist. Ben and Maggie find clues to a fraud plot as well as true romantic spark between themselves. Ned (Keith Barron-`Where the Heart Is') flings modern paint. Liz Hardcastle (Phyllida Law-Emma Thompson's ma) sings in a pub.

AFTER TITIAN== A Klinsky's NY bidder drops dead. Is Ben right in associating the Titian oil to the event? A conflict twixt conscience & career. Scot art buyer, Flecknow (Dan O'Herlihy)want Scot Ben's opinion. Klinsky's NY office head, Whiteside (Michael J. Shannon-`We'll Meet Again' `Superman II') who flirts with Maggie-& she with he.

THE SPECTER AT THE FEAST== Rare finds are always questioned-including an unpublished Charles Dickens manuscript. When it is stolen, Ben gets the blame. Did he do it? A host of guest stars make up the client's family. Dame Thora Hird (Hallelujah!' `Last of the Summer Wine') plays Nanny to the Bovington clan. Ma Hester (Rosemary Harris-`Holocaust' `Being Julia'); her son Hector (Martin Clunes-`Doc Martin'); son Mike (Richard Huw''Van der Valk' `Murder Investigation Team'); in-law Authea (Hermoine Norris-`Berkeley Sq.' `MI-5') make up the Bovington family. Annabelle (Kate McKenzie) appears at the London office to double up on the adultery for Klinsky's Bernard. Fun episode.

TREASURE TROVE== Maggie's personal life and company relations take a bit of a hit. Decisions must be made. Calpurnia (Susan Fleetwood-`Persuasion'), head in Antiquities dept, causes issues too. Sad because there is no more ""UNDER THE HAMMER.""

See, that's a lot of stars in one series.
TRULY FUN MYSTERY, ROMANCE, DRAMA, HUMOR MIX. Not just a DVD for the art lovers. All lovers will like this one.",1304294400,33,4596,5.257844474761255

4462989,1,B004SI5VVI,"I loved Richard Wilson in an earlier British sit com... thought he was wonderful, so I ordered Under the Hammer based on that.  I was bitterly disappointed with the series.  Weak plots and characters I didn't relate to easily.  Also, sound quality was poor.",1425859200,,257,4.795454545454546
4462990,3,B004SI5VVI,IMO this show gets on ones nerves very fast. Arguments and petty quarrels seem so childish. Gave it to the library.,1417824000,,115,4.523809523809524

4462992,5,B004SI5VVI,"We're fans of Richard Wilson.  These episodes show him in fine form.  Now if someone would release Duck Patrol, we could watch Richard Wilson at his absolute best.  The plots of Under the Hammer were fun to watch and learn a little art history along the way.",1393200000,,258,4.446808510638298
4462993,2,B004SI5VVI,"Being a lover of art, auctions and British crime shows, I thought this would combine three of my passions. Unfortunatley, it turned out to be a dry bit of fluff (Think Remington Steele without the plot, action or sexual tension). The lines at times are hastily delivered so it sounds contrived. A number of british television stars make appearances which would be great if their characters were more developed or intergral in the story. The show has little to do with auctions even though it's set at Klinsky's Auction House and even less to do with crime. Basically it comes down Richard Wilson making barbs at people while trying to authenticate works of old masters and trying to woo Jan Francis.",1388620800,3,699,4.785123966942149

4462995,4,B004SI5VVI,"The relationship between the main characters was intriguing and emphasized by great dialogue. I enjoyed the plots of the episodes and the setting of the art world. Since this is an older series, it doesn't have some of the finishing touches that a modern series would have (such as a great soundtrack and interesting cinematography) but this is definitely a series I would watch again.",1378944000,,385,4.938461538461539
4462996,2,B004SI5VVI,Have seen better. Does not hold interest. Acting is below average. Plot made no sense. Would not recommend to a friend or family member.,1377820800,,136,4.708333333333333

4462998,2,B004SI5VVI,"We had high hopes for this series because it was by John Mortimer, the creator of two series that we had enjoyed very much: Rumpole of the Bailey and Summer's Lease.  Under the Hammer unfortunately demonstrates that nobody bats a thousand.  In Episode 1 (after which we quit watching) the lead characters were unappealing, much of the dialogue bore no resemblance to natural speech and the plot, though it had a beginning, a middle and an end, somehow still managed to leave the impression that it went nowhere.  The only redeeming features of the episode were brief star turns by John Gielgud, who as seemed to be his habit in his later years, stole the whole show, and character actor Frederick Treves.",1377216000,3,704,4.754098360655738

4463004,3,B004SI5VVI,A different type of mystery episodes.  Auction house deceit with likable and captivating characters.  Doubt if there is a second season?,1375056000,,136,5.428571428571429
4463005,3,B004SI5VVI,"This is a better program than most, but that's not saying a lot.  The setting is the back dealings at a Christie's-type auction house with a semi-romantic attachment between a soon to be middle-aged woman curator and her older subsidiary colleague.  It gives some insight into the business end of the art market, but it also takes huge liberties.

The lead performers do a good job, and I love to see the London background shots.  You could (and probably do) do worse in entertainment.",1374364800,,485,4.738095238095238

4463007,5,B004SI5VVI,Initially I thought that the situation and characters would not hold my attention but they did and I watched all the available seasons.

4463009,3,B004SI5VVI,While entertaining as I really like shows about art and mystery I thought I would give it a whirl.  Plot was pretty thin and predictable as were the characters.  I hoping for Lovejoy but got No Joy instead.,1369785600,,206,4.394736842105263
4463010,3,B004SI5VVI,"This show would be neat if it were updated.  As it is, it's very creaky.  Television production has come very far ahead since it was made.",1369440000,,138,4.269230769230769
4463011,3,B004SI5VVI,Took a while to get into it but enjoyed it after a few episodes. Worth the effort if just for the history.,1369353600,,106,3.8636363636363638
4463012,4,B004SI5VVI,Enjoyable & easy paced who-dun-it. I will watch this series again as I wind down from another hectic work week.,1368921600,,111,4.6

4463014,4,B004SI5VVI,"How can there only be one season? This series includes everything we like. The subject is interesting, you throw in a bit of history and the characters are both believable and humorous. It looks good too, especially for an early 90's UK series. We would have happily watched three seasons worth at least.",1367712000,,304,4.754716981132075
4463015,2,B004SI5VVI,Just didn't capture my attention at all. Felt that the stories dragged along in this series. I had hoped to enjoy it more since I like the genre so much. This one is just not my cuppa.,1367625600,,184,4.0
4463016,5,B004SI5VVI,"This very smart British series is equally approachable.  While it reminds me a bit of the Lovejoy series, it has a distinct charm.",1367625600,,130,4.6521739130434785
4463017,2,B004SI5VVI,Looks dated and hard to understand their conversations. No real mystery as to the guilty suspect in the first episode.,1367366400,,118,4.95
4463018,4,B004SI5VVI,"Happened upon this the other day.  I'm a big fan of British TV, but this one had somehow escaped me.  Although it has that late-80s feel, it's still a fascinating look into the elite auction industry, with mystery and a murder or two thrown in.  Good acting and interesting information about the art and antiques world.",1367107200,,319,4.660714285714286
4463019,2,B004SI5VVI,The story line was not paced well and it became boring; not like other British mysteries that we like to watch.,1366588800,,111,4.333333333333333

4463021,3,B004SI5VVI,"this show had an interesting premise, but the actors and plots seem a bit worn out- seemed a bit like a Lovejoy spin-off that had some interesting character ideas that didn't really go anywhere.  We have enjoyed the work of many of the actors in other series/films, but this one isn't top notch- but it's pleasant and not too taxing on your gray cells.",1365897600,,352,4.5
4463022,5,B004SI5VVI,A slow start but once you are into this series you don't want to stop watching it. Give us more!,1364515200,,96,3.85

4463024,4,B004SI5VVI,Liked the 1st 2 - has some comedy and a bit like watching mystery shows with a differernt slant.  Fun,1363824000,,101,4.05
4463025,3,B004SI5VVI,"Amusing and aimed at an educated audience, which I appreciate, enough so that I looked to see if there were further series of this BBC program.  There weren't.  It has some of the caustic wit and unusual (but implausible) plot twists that I would expect and applaud from writer John Mortimer, but Richard Wilson is too polished and upper class to pull off the key lines and the romantic/sexual competition built into each story was just annoying.  It takes a better author to make your heroin a promiscuous
slut. This could have been a really enjoyable series if someone had exercised a little tasteful editorial control and selective casting.",1363305600,,643,4.8807339449541285

4463029,5,B004SI5VVI,"This show earned five stars from me since it was well-written and acted. The characters were believable and interesting.

4463031,5,B004SI5VVI,"If you watch Antiques Roadshow and used to watch or own the Lovejoy series you probably like antiques and art. Combine the two with a touch of mystery and a bit of romance and you have Under the Hammer. While Lovejoy left you in the world of the small, independent antique and art dealers, Uncer the Hammer takes you inside the big time. Based in a major, although fictitious auction house modeled on the likes of Christie's, the series follows art experts Richard Wilson and Jan Francis as they wend their way through murder, art fraud and the odd romantic encounter. Great stuff and I'm hoping Season Two, which supposedly exists, becomes available soon.",1361750400,,656,4.7631578947368425
4463032,3,B004SI5VVI,"Not a bad show but there is nothing here to really keep you hooked either. The acting is OK and the stories proceed at a leisurely pace. The characters are somewhat sympathetic, but not enough to keep me hooked.",1360713600,,211,4.435897435897436

4463036,5,B004SI5VVI,"I watched this series during a long transit from Hawaii to Port Townsend, Washington sparingly viewing an episode or two each evening. It was well done, fast paced, witty, and not at all predictable. Very modern and contemporary presentation. I did have a little trouble with some of the English accents, but I think even the English would have incurred the same issues due to the fast paced dialogue. I may have to watch it again to see how many subtleties that I missed. I am hoping for some follow up episodes and will be watching Amazon for new releases. I don't know much about acorn media, but they really do hit a lot of home runs with their video presentations. I haven't encountered a disappointing series and that is why I have become such a fan.",1311120000,2,756,4.525547445255475
4463037,4,B004SI5VVI,"Enter the high-toned art world via Klinsky's auction house, home officed in London (compare to Sotheby's). The chief protagonists are Maggie and Ben, Old Master painting experts on the Klinsky payroll.  They work together a lot, and the fun part of the series concerns the nefarious dealings that can take place in the rarified ""fine"" art world, including a forged 1500's painting, a real newly discovered Dicken's manuscript, and an illegally imported Roman statuette.

I also like most of the interplay between Maggie and Ben. Ben has a caustic wit and very Scottish outlook on life. Maggie is the ""reasonable"" foil to his comments.  What I didn't like was the romancing between the two, mostly on Ben's part. He's too old compared to her, and it was not believable to me. It would have worked better if they just stayed colleagues, arguing and laughing together as old and loyal friends.

Overall, this series is moderately well written, and overall enjoyable. It is not as good as the ""Lovejoy"" series, which takes you into the world of antique dealers, which has equal opportunities for questionable practices.

I bought this DVD set sight unseen, based on the fact that it's based on writings by John Mortimer. I loved the TV series of Mortimer's ""Rumpole of the Bailey"".  Maybe there wasn't as much to work with. Mortimer only published one book about Kinsky's, titled ""Under the Hammer"". Now out of print, it was a compilation of short stories about the fictional Klinsky art auction world.

The episodes together involve a borderline-elderly art expert who lusts after his notably younger colleague, but seems to be losing her to a smarmily charming, more age-appropriate wine expert in the same auction house.
