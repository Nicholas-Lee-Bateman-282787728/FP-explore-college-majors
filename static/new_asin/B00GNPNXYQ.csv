8625172,5,B00GNPNXYQ,I brought this DVD back in November because it looked like a great choreography DVD... I have been belly dancing for several years and love watching and learning from different instructors from the comfort of my own home... Tara is very thorough and informative and has a very calming reassuring way of teaching belly dance. The DVD is great for all levels of dancer and the choreography is fun and a perfect performance piece...I love how the DVD is broken up into segments and you can go back and watch the portions you are interested in. Since I am a pretty quick learner I went right to the choreo portion and learned the whole piece without watching the break down of the piece. I highly recommend this DVD.,1401235200,,712,4.5703125
