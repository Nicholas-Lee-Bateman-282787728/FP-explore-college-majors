8760734,1,B01FG9JI3O,"I am so disappointed!! I have bought the movie via iTunes and have watched it over and over without any problems. For my birthday I got an amazon giftcard and was so excited to order the movie as a DVD and the DVD barely works. It has no scratches or anything on it. The box was sealed and as soon as I opened it I put it into my DVD player to watch and just a few minutes into the movie it just froze. It doesn't even let me fast forward, or pick other scene! The DVD is worthless, can't recommend ordering it at all...",1471564800,,520,3.961904761904762
