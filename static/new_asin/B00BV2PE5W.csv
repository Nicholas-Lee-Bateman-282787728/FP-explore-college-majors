5677444,3,B00BV2PE5W,"This was fulfilling to me because I wanted a refresher on why Nat Turner was famous.  The work says there is little info on the real Nat Turner.  Most info comes from a white, male contemporary who may have fudged the facts to sell books.  Thus, this work focuses more upon how Nat Turner inspired future playwrights and activists more than finding any truths.
Maybe this should have been just 30 minutes and combined with a second documentary, say one of Cinque or Quilombo or Garvey.  In this post-9/11 world, Turner's acts may seem obscene.  In fact, I wonder how the Black boy in my 5th grade class got away with focusing on Nat Turner during history reports when it may have ""threatened"" the non-Black students.  This work may be old as the late Ossie Davis is interviewed here.
The work never connects this slave revolt to those in Ancient Rome, or even the French Revolution.  I wonder if ppl may want to learn about John Brown and his anti-slavery actions alongside this.  (A small sidenote: a Black male porn star goes by the name Nat Turnher, obviously in a funny tribute to 19th-century revolutionary.)",1374624000,2,1113,4.671794871794872

This  video was clearly made in an attempt to persuade the viewers into believing that Nat Turner could not have been a thinking individual but one who was driven by his savage African heritage.  This video depicts Nat Turner as an individual who murders innocent victims in their beds when in fact this is what was done by the cold and savage captors. I cant say what I would have during this time the way some of the ""persons"" in this video did. But what I can say is to watch your sons and daughters being taken from you, killed, raped, tortured, used as mules, sex slaves, breeders and more must have been difficult. The savages in this history were they that did all the things Nat did without being provoked at all.  The savages are the they that took land and killed its occupants. The savages are those who sit in the position of entitlement and judge this man this hero of the negro people. The savages are these non God fearing people.  These savages that fear nothing at all.

5677481,4,B00BV2PE5W,"If you're looking for details on Turner's life and the brief slave revolt he led, you'd be better served reading the Wikipedia page.  The film gives only the barest outline, reenacting one scene and describing a few others.  Its main focus is how Turner's story has been retold, and how fluid it has turned out to be, given the scant information on the man's life.  Aside from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Confessions-of-Nat-Turner/dp/162845217X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Confessions of Nat Turner</a>, recorded by attorney Thomas Ruffin Gray after Turner's capture, there exist surprisingly few original sources.  Several former slaves interviewed in the 1930s for the WPA Slave Narratives recalled having heard of Turner from older slaves who had been alive at the time the rebellion occurred in 1831.  Beyond that, most other sources, including William Styron's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Confessions-of-Nat-Turner/dp/0679736638/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Confessions of Nat Turner</a>, discussed in the film, are speculative.

Turner's life and story, it seems, have provided fruitful ground for mythologizing.  The dearth of verifiable facts have led to Turner's presentation as a lunatic or a freedom fighter.  Actor Ossie Davis recalls boys in his childhood imagining themselves as Nat Turner.  His absolute ruthlessness - he and his army killed women and children as well as grown men - is presented as the necessarily total commitment of the revolutionary.  One cannot help but wonder what Turner's legacy would be today if his rebellion had been successful in ending slavery in the United States - more than likely, he'd be viewed as a hero on par with George Washington.

The film isn't really about Turner or his rebellion, per se; we hear nothing about its very well documented aftermath, which resulted in the deaths of many slaves who had not taken part in it, and was followed by prohibitions against slaves having weapons or learning to read.  The film also fails to examine the universal subject of how a mythology is created in the first place, and what purpose this serves.  We are finally left with the Nat Turner we want for ourselves, and as Professor Henry Louis Gates points out, if you don't like the story of Turner you're hearing, then write one of your own.  The filmmaker takes pains to ensure that we don't take his presentation of Turner as definitive, either - at the end, he pans back to show how one of the most violent scenes in the film was created with actors.  Turner is ""troublesome"" because, as the narrator says at the end, we want a sense of closure that we can never have.",1477267200,2,2733,5.443127962085308

5677495,5,B00BV2PE5W,"I watched this documentary in advance of The Birth of a Nation (2016).  Although this was an old documentary, including interviews with several deceased people (Ossie Davis!), I believe the content was still timely.  The major point of the documentary was to share how problematic it is to create/share stories about Nat Turner because of the potential bias and fabrications in the Thomas Gray version of his ""Confessions.""  We then talk about the Nat Turner folklore, a Nat Turner play, and William Styron's novel, which itself earned a rebuttal from noted black writers of the day.

People have complained about Birth of a Nation's historical inaccuracies.  This documentary should help more people understand why Nate Parker may have taken liberties with his interpretation of the Nat Turner story.",1476144000,6,801,5.2265625

5677509,3,B00BV2PE5W,"There were several opinions of whom Nat Turner probably was, but nothing to truly pique my interest to study more of him then I already have. There's much more history of Turner than what has been accepted. A footnote, if you will, mostly hidden by historical conjecture. To me, Nat Turner was a slave acting on delusional vengeance with the ability to entice other slaves to join him.
""Birth Of A Nation"" (2016) will be another attempt to interpret Turner's actions, Hollywood style. There was a reason no other slave revolts occurred as violently as Nat Turner's or as memorable.",1474848000,,581,4.82
5677510,5,B00BV2PE5W,"For me this docuvision is an attempt to track the path, purpose, and legacy of a man who's history has now become almost ghost-like. It invites its audience to travel through time; to pierce the veils of a time past through the limited scope of its contributors, with little or no certainty; challenging us to sift through the distorted, constructed, and conflated truths about a man who purportedly did, what some consider unconscionable; and for others, was plausible, and even revolutionarily redeeming. Each of us are charged to reconcile the judgments of our minds with the heart and mind of a tortured people through the hazy storyboard of the one, Nat Turner. Interestingly though, the film exposes the foul breath of the antebellum south, still apparent in 2003, as its stench reeks from the mouths of its unaware speakers, under the guise of evolved, intelligent and investigative introspection. This film reminds us, almost deliberately, that our challenges of today are the same as those of yesterday; they have merely changed in form. Is there any true progress then? Of course it is, but the work is not complete. Like fractions, we must recognize the head of the family to see a thing for what it is. I do not subscribe to the man-made, mind construct of race. The unconscionable atrocities surrounding the architectural mindset and acceptance of slavery, or any remnants of its surviving forms, is, and always has been born of ego induced grandiosity/elitism (a self constructed hierarchical framework). A discerning spirit does not need a fact for fact chronology to empathize with Nat's position. Nat's living truth: A demographic of humanity, defined by color and other physical traits, tyrannically forced into subjection, another demographic of humanity, defined by color and other physical traits. From Nat's actions it is clear that he rebelled not only against the failing so-called moral turpitude of a so-called civilized people, but the absence of spiritual excellence in those same terrorists. Again, this film recalls Turner's end-result actions and forces us to examine ourselves from the deepest recesses of our being. It begs abandon of what we think we know in order to humbly solve the equation from both sides of history. Implicitly, we are asked to consider the resulting horrors, and to continue such practice until we reach the most fundamental truth; thus clarifying our own reflection in the other's eyes; for only then can we understand the inception of such dilemmas.",1474761600,5,2508,5.134474327628362

''ONE STAR'' FOR THAT WRONGFUL PHOTO OF FREDERICH DOUGLASS BEING PLACED ON A WORK OF FICTION.  DOUGLASS WAS REAL!!

STYRON WROTE HIS NOVEL BUT HE DOES NOT GET ANY PLAY IN MY BOOK, AS IT STANDS FROM MY KNOWLEDGE OF HIS WORK BY THIS PRESENTATION ONLY.  HIS BOOK, A NOVEL OF FICTION,  WAS WRITTEN BY A ""RACIST"" WHITE MAN ABOUT A ""RACIST"" BLACK MAN.  THE WORLD THEN (IN STYRON'S TIME AND BEFORE, AND EVEN NOW) WAS BLACK AND WHITE AND QUICKLY TURNING TO BEIGE, CARMEL, COFFEE AND SO ON AND IT WAS TURNING THOSE ''COMPLEXIONS'' BECAUSE SOMEBODY WAS HAVING SEX WITH SOME BODIES.  AND BY AND LARGE IT WASN'T BLACK MALES HAVING SEX WITH WHITE FEMALES: SHE AND HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IMMEDIATELY DURING NAT TURNER'S TIMES.  BUT THERE WERE WHITE MALES FREELY HAVING SEX WITH BLACK FEMALES (NATIVE AMERICANS) WITHOUT REGARD FOR THEIR HUMANITY.  IT WAS THE WHITE MALES WHO SWARMED THE CABINS WHERE THE ""COLORED"" FEMALES SLEPT.
  ""COLORED""?....WELL YEAH.  IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR THE ''MIRACLE BIRTHS'' TO BEGIN.  THE BIRTHS THAT WERE IMPOSSIBLE ACCORDING TO THE THEORY OF 'race'.  IT IS DEFUNCT NOW AS BAD ACADEMICS.  YOU SEE, ""THE THEORY OF RACISM"" HELD THAT NATURE MADE ALL PEOPLE IN FIVE RACES: BLACK, WHITE, BROWN, YELLOW AND RED.  SEX AMONG HUMANS PROVE THAT THESIS TO BE WRONG, WRONG, WRONG.  DON'T EVER FORGET THAT: SEX MAKES RACE IMPOSSIBLE.  SO WHAT ARE WE LEFT WITH: WE ARE LEFT WITH BEING PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL APPLICATIONS DURING ""TIMES"".  HUMANS WILL ALWAYS SEPARATE OUT AND DEVELOP THEIR WORLDVIEW: WE CALL SUCH GROUPINGS: ''ETHNICITY''.
  SO.  DIVERSITY IS AMERICA AND AMERICANS ARE HIGHLY DIVERSED THUS DEFUNCTING THE CONSTRUCT & CONCEPT OF 'RACE'!
  IT'S NOT LIKE ALLLL HUMANS DON'T KNOW HOW TO ENSLAVE: THEY DO.  ALL HUMANS KNOW HOW TO BE EVIL.
  *WHEN STYRON SAYS IN HIS NOVEL THAT NAT TURNER WAS CONFUSED AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE YOUNG WHITE GIRL WALKING BESIDE HIM: RAPE HER, MURDER HER, LOVE HER, OR JUST LET HER BE....(THAT, BY MY ACCOUNTS, IS NOT A TRUE DESCRIPTION OF BEHAVIOR, MALE BEHAVIOR, OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A YOUNG CHATTERING WHITE GIRL WAS WALKING IN THE WOODS WITH ""ANY"" MALE, BUT WITH AN ""ENSLAVED"" MALE WHO WAS ANGRY AND REBELLISH AND READY TO DO EVIL: HE WOULD HAVE EITHER WALKED AWAY FROM HER OR RAPED HER VIOLENTLY AND WITHOUT REGARD UNTIL THE ACT WAS FINISHED AND MURDERED HER.  THEN, HE MAY HAVE EVEN CRIED OVER IT (THEN OR LATER... OR NOT AT ALL)  AND SHE, IF SHE LIVED, WOULD LIKELY SIT BESIDE HIM ON THE GROUND AND FORGIVE HIM OR SEEM TO FORGIVE HIM.  WHY?  tHE RAPE WAS OVER BUT SHE WAS STILL IN DANGER OR BECAUSE THE WHITE WOMAN IN THE SOUTH HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE WHITE MEN IN THE SOUTH.  SOMETIMES SHE FELT AS WORSE-OFF AS THE ENSLAVED ...THE AGAIN, SOMETIMES SHE WAS MORE EVIL THAN THE MEN ABOUT HER.  AND BECAUSE,  VERY FEW WHITE WOMEN WOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT CHANCE ON HER LIFE BY WALKING WITH NAT TURNER IN THE WOODS.  SHE WAS SOCIALLY OSTRACIZED JUST BY SPEAKING TO AN ENSLAVED BLACK MAN.

NO STYRON!!!  WHERE I COME FROM THE AFRICAN AMERICANS WOULD JUST LABEL YOUR WORK AS: ""SWS"" AND LET THAT BE IT,
SAYING, ""NEVER BELIEVE ANYTHING A WHITE MAN WRITES ABOUT YOUR HISTORY.  THEY WILL WRITE YOU ANIMALISTIC EVERY TIME.''
SO NAT TURNER IS NOW A FICTIONAL CHARACTER IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND ANY AMERICAN (ALL COMPLEXIONS AND HAIR TEXTURES) CAN WRITE THEIR VIEW OF WHAT HIS STORY MAY HAVE BEEN.--MO",1471132800,,3695,4.652241112828439

The ""by any means necessary,"" was a pivotal mindset for those living under the abomination of slavery to destroy whatever or do whatever to live a life of equality, happiness, and liberty. The means taken and influenced by Nat Turner were extreme and to be condoned, but the awakening began as more slaves took various means to be free.

Whereas, it may be true that we know very little about Turner himself, and what we do know may not be true as it was originally presented by a white man with his own motives, we do know what happened.  We know who was killed, how they were killed, and where they were killed.  We know what the reaction of the white slave owning south was.  We know what the conditions were for most black slaves in the South before and after the event.  Rather than indulge in a back and forth about whether Turner himself was a madman - which whites prefer, or a revolutionary hero - which African Americans prefer, I would have preferred more history about the event itself.  Was there much reaction in the North?  Did it help bring more support for the abolitionist movement?  How did it fit into the centuries' long struggle by African Americans for their freedom?

5677655,5,B00BV2PE5W,"A remarkable fusion of dramatic reenactment, interviews, narration, and more. As the film points out, we know very little about Nat Turner, although he has acquired a mythic status. The film is especially good at showing how much the meaning of Turner depends on the eye of the beholder. To most southern whites, he was a madman. To blacks and to many historians, he was (and is) a revolutionary hero in the best American tradition.",1467504000,,432,4.773333333333333
8574450,5,B00BV2PE5W,"William Styrons classic novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Confessions-of-Nat-Turner/dp/0679736638/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Confessions of Nat Turner</a>&nbsp;was published in 1967.  It made the cover of Newsweek during those very turbulent years of race relations in America, as the almost century old system of legal racial segregation came to an end. I waited until sometime in the 1980s to read it, which was my introduction to the most significant slave revolt in American history.  Several decades on, I felt a refresher course was overdue. This docudrama provided both the refresher, and greatly expanded my understanding of the actual revolt, as well as how it has been used and interpreted by a range of individuals today.

This docudrama was written and directed by Charles Burnett. Nat Turner led the revolt in Southhampton County, Virginia in 1831. Numerous slaves followed his call to revolt. Numerous whites were killed, including women, children and infants. Most of the slaves were quickly caught by militia, and summarily executed. It would take 70 days to capture Nat Turner, not far from his home. Virtually nothing is known of the historical personage of Nat Turner. The sole account comes from a lawyer, Thomas F. Gray, who was admitted to his jail cell before Turners execution, in order to obtain Turners side of the story, in brief, to record his confession. Most black historians dispute Grays version, strongly feeling that Turner would not talk in that manner. Gray calls him a complete fanatic. Quite possibly, Turner did think that he was a prophet who had God on his side.

In addition to the enactment of scenes such as when Turner murdered his white owners in their beds, Gray in the jail cell obtaining Turners version, and the hanging of Turner, much of the strength of this movie comes from the individuals who were selected to be interviewed. There was Bruce Turner, a descendant of Nat, as well as descendants of the victims. Professor Henry Louis Gates of Harvard was also prominently interviewed. He was very understanding of the revolt, as was Eugene Genovese, who wrote another classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roll-Jordan-Roll-The-World-the-Slaves-Made/dp/0394716523/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made</a>. And there was William Styron himself, explaining the basic blank sheet of Turners life that he could project his own impressions upon. One of which was highly controversial: without any historical basis, he depicted Turners love for a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, who he will kill in the revolt. Such a portrayal is the proverbial third rail for many blacks, particularly the women, some of whom refused to read the book as a result. I also learned that James Baldwin spent some time at Styrons home, and encouraged him to write the novel.

For my own unique twist on that largely blank sheet that is Turners life, I could not help thinking of someone else who felt he had God on his side, and could motivate others to follow him, Juhayman al-Otaybi, along with his brother-in-law, Mohammed Abdullah al-Qahtani, proclaimed the Mahdi. It was the year 1400, on the Higerian calendar, (1979) when they seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca. One school of Islam believes in the coming of the savior, the Mahdi, on the centennial dates. Hence, in the year 1300, a Madhi was proclaimed in the Sudan, whose actions would eventually lead to the siege of Khartoum, and the death of General Gordon. Part of the belief is that at the critical moment, the armies of the North would come and ensure victory. Al-Otaybi famously queried where they were just before his capture. And Turner? Was it just a visceral: Ive had enough?  Or was he aware of northern abolitionists efforts, and hoped his revolt would lead to a general upheaval, and the intervention of the armies of the north. It would take another three decades. 5-stars for Burnetts illuminating movie.",1504828800,3,4041,5.355905511811024
8574451,5,B00BV2PE5W,"I saw that the film was about Nat Turner, and I wanted to know more about him and his insurrection, so I didn't bother to check the details. I thought it was just a documentary.

Instead, it is a very thoughtful and well-crafted meditation on what gets passed down as ""history"" and the dissonance between different interpretations of history. I came to the film with an adult's awareness that history is always a matter of interpretation. The historian chooses which facts seem relevant to the particular mission of recording a history, and beyond that, emphasizes some facts, which amounts to de-emphasizing other facts that are less of a fit with the historian's point of view and his or her project. But in Turner's case, very little is known of the man, and so the interpretive function of history is a bit more transparent than we usually think.

The emphases and point of view are there in every case, however. I grew up in the Deep South, and I was taught at age 6 or before that Christopher Columbus had discovered America. It was as though the Americas were a huge unpopulated space that had never been walked on by another human being. Kind of like going to the moon. I of course discovered later that there were a million or more people here preceding that big find by Columbus. How do you ""discover"" an inhabited land? Well, you're a white European, and you're discovering it for an extraordinarily limited portion of humanity that white Europeans thought of as ""civilization."" And you plant a flag. (As comedian Eddie Izzard quips in a routine about  the ""discoveries"" of various inhabited countries, the new arrival, armed with his flag, can respond to the natives, ""Well, do YOU have a flag?"")

James Baldwin says in an old tape recreated in this film that his own education as a child included the misconception that Africa had no history. Only European whites had history.

The film juxtaposes all kinds of representations of Nat Turner from different genres--from stage and film to the written word and transcriptions of interviews with former slaves by WPA workers in the Great Depression. Each representation is destined to ruffle someone or other. But as Henry Louis Gates says in the film, If you don't like the artistic representations, go create your own. Which reminds me: The filmmakers had extraordinary access to very highly respected historians, activists and writers; the on-screen interviews with them are amazing.

It's an excellent, thought-provoking film that I would recommend to anyone.",1498953600,2,2522,4.92235294117647
8574452,3,B00BV2PE5W,"I understand the man he 'Mr. Nat Turner was! He got tired of being a slave for another man, and the pains & evil, that brought about to him & his people!
So, as a man he was, was to be a man, not continually to be weak & bow down and remain a slave and be like the walking dead, which is not living anyway! That is exactly, why we're taught to envy one another through slavery, that has kept us, from ever being unionized again, even during Martin Luther King time, he realized that monumental speech, was a devastating mistake, he implemented on his part!
Slavery is still going on today, look at the jails full of black men and let's not forget the invisible chains that's on free blacks of today in society!
We will never have the whole true story told, has it ever????? NO! That's why I don't like these documentaries! The only one part I believe that was true, is that he said they killed Jesus too! Because, they tried to mock him for that! I surely, be glad when Armageddon gets here, to wipe out the evildoers!",1495411200,,1018,4.252577319587629
