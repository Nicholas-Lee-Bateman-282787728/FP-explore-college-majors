8292052,5,B001D7T44W,"I have been an Edmonton Oilers fan for 35+ years, and this collection brings back a lot of great memories of when they were a great team. There are some great games here, such as Gretzky's 50 goals in 39 games against Philly , his OT goal against Calgary and finally beating the mighty New York Islanders. You'll get to see some of the greatest offensive players of all-time such as Wayne Gretzky, Jari Kurri, Mark Messier and Paul Coffey, as well as some great goaltending by Grant Fuhr and Curtis Joseph. The Oilers were one of the greatest dynasties in hockey history, and the greatest offensive team in history. I'm hoping with Connor McDavid they can have some semblance,  to a return to their golden years. Highly recommended.",1470960000,,732,4.674418604651163

8292056,4,B001D7T44W,"First the pros:  This is a well-edited set with no commercials and no wasted time.  The games are mostly excellent, with the first 7 or so being truly great hockey.

Now the reasons this isn't a 5-star set:

These are a wide spread of games, true...but that doesn't make them the Oilers' ""Greatest Games"" by a long shot.  Game 7 against Dallas was a great game for Curtis Joseph, the Oiler goalie, but frankly, the Oilers got a lucky breakaway during overtime in a game where the Stars played rings around them for 98% of the game.  Game 6 against Carolina was no different- the Oilers didn't decisively win the game...they won in overtime. Game 5 of that series, on the other hand, was a great game for the Oilers.  Multiple non-final games in the seasons from 80-87 were outstanding to watch, particularly some of the regular season games where Gretzky/Kurri/Messier/Fogolin/Coffee/Anderson/Lowe/Huddy/Tikkanen/etc. were functioning as less a collection of players and more a seamless, fluid example of perfect pass-pass-pass-triple deke-shoot puck magic.  Numerous games where both Grant Fuhr and Andy Moog were spectacular were skipped over in this series, just because they didn't involve the word ""Final"" in the title.",1376265600,2,1224,5.115577889447236
8292057,5,B001D7T44W,"The one reviewer was kind enough to put in exactly all of the games that are contained within the set.  As a result, my comments are directed on the games that were NOT in the set, but would have liked to have seen included in it.

The one thing that does annoy me about about these sets is that a Stanley Cup winning game does NOT necessarily mean automatically that it deserves the title of being a ""great game"".  Point being that Game #5 of the 84 Finals versus the Islanders is a bit on the boring side, as well as the Cup clinching game the following year against the Flyers.  I mean, they're great for reminiscing purposes if you're a fan of the team, but for pure nail biting action and some long lasting impression where you're on the edge of your seat the whole time, I can think of others in the Oilers' history that I would've much preferred to see.  For one, I would've liked to have seen Game #3 of the opening round vs. Montreal back in 1980 where the Oilers were HUGE underdogs to the one season removed Stanley Cup champion Canadiens that season, and managed to sweep the Habs.  Another game (and even though it is a loss, it was a classic in every sense of the word as far as historic comebacks) would be Game #3 of the 82 playoffs vs. the LA Kings where Edmonton goes up 5-0, but proceeds to blow it in the 3rd period and lose it in overtime.  Again, it may not be the most ""favorite"" game in the minds of Edmonton fans, but it is a classic that deserves its place in history.  I guess the one caveat out of all of these games on DVD is that the home team ALWAYS wins, which I guess is the purpose behind it, but like I said, for me it doesnt necessarily mean that the game is one of the teams ""greatest"" of all time.  One more thing I would like to add, for the first game on this DVD set (where Gretzky gets his 50th in 39 games), the color commentary for CBC is done by none other than Don Cherry.  Don is absolutely engaging and witty all during the game, but believe it or not, relatively subdued as well.  This is the time that I like to remember Don before (my personal opinion) he started to believe all of the newspaper clippings about himself and started becoming more and more bombastic (and phony) in the process.  Don seemed to be more of a ""regular guy"" back then (a not like a product of the WWF like he seems to be now) and it is refreshing to hear his commentary throughout the game.",1256256000,6,2418,4.176344086021506
8292058,3,B001D7T44W,"hi! just thought id point out that this set has 2 games from the great 4 disk ultimate gretzky collection. the 50 goals in 39 games and the winning of the stanley cup in 1984 against the islanders,both are on both sets. so,if you buy this set your really buying the 8 greatest games of the oilers. ill be buying a set just for the game in boston-one of the next to last games ever played at the garden. hope this helped.jim.",1251331200,3,424,4.182926829268292
8292059,3,B001D7T44W,"If you bought the ""Ultimate Gretzky"" (4 Disc set) prior to buying this, then you've been shortchanged by the NHL... the first game is the same on both sets!
Sure, it's a milestone.. but any Oilers fans will have bought the Gretzky set before that one was even planned... so why would the fans choose the same thing again? Isn't there just ONE game that could have replaced it?
Basically, I have 9 games on this, not 10.
Besides, the sound of that game is much better on the Gretzky set... why?
The source was the same... It's incomprehensible, but then again, you're in Oil Country... everything is slippery then.
Just disappointed that they'd show the same game again... Boy are we lucky they didn't put the Oilers-Canadiens Heritage Classic Game (which had already been released when the Montreal fans voted to have it - again - on the Montreal Canadiens set.. Makes no sense to me buying things twice...
Oh well...
Thus the 3 stars.. BAD planning (and bad sound for that game)",1233792000,,979,4.632183908045977
