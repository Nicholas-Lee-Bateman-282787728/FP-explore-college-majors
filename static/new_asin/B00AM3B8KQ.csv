5450041,5,B00AM3B8KQ,"I've only been using it for 9 days but I know it's effective because (excuse my language) my A$$ has NEVER ever hurt so much. One of the reviews said its fun and fast and that's true! Since I'm white, over 40 and Jewish, I KNOW I will never have my own Donk to clap but I know I'm getting a firmer, leaner, rear. MAYBE I'll be able to build a baby apple bottom if I stay committed. In the mean time I am having fun trying!",1357430400,371,422,3.8620689655172415
5450042,4,B00AM3B8KQ,"Good first effort by the Nida's (Phaedra & Apollo from Real Housewives of Atlanta).  The workout has lots of lunges and squats.  If you have weak knees, start slow and build up your strength.  I was walking like a stick figure for 3 days after doing this one!",1357257600,63,259,4.354166666666667
5450043,5,B00AM3B8KQ,"I bought this dvd to see if Phaedra and Apollo lived up to hype of working out my booty. They did not dissappoint at all and delivered a great booty work out dvd. There chemistry were insync and communicated great together. The video was very engageing and kept my heart rate up all through the work out. Exercises includes leg lift, lunges, squats and many more moves. When I was finish I was sweating and feeling the burn in my booty and legs. I will continue working out with my donkey booty  dvd until I achieve a voluptuous posterior. The great thing about this dvd is no matter where you at in your fitness level, you can do this work out and achieve results. SO whether you are 10 or 80 years old you can still work out with dvd, it is for all age group. Thank you Phaedra and Appollo for this fun work out dvd.",1357084800,62,818,4.210191082802548
5450044,5,B00AM3B8KQ,"Phaedra and Apollo did a great job with their Phine Body Workout. The first time I worked out with this program, I lasted twenty minutes. I had to sit down and catch my breath. I felt the burn ten minutes into the program. I purchased Phine Body as a Christmas present to myself. I've been  living a sedentary lifestyle, so I picked Phine Body as part of my introduction to fitness and exercise. So far, I've been feeling the burn.

Folks who already strenuously exercise may have an easier time with the workout, but most of us who sit throughout the day NEED to move, and  the Phine Body Workout is a wonderful introduction to establishing a fitness regimen. My lower body burned for two hours after the workout. I began to sweat during the Warm-Up.

I used caution before going all out trying to do the whole workout. I had to start out doing fifteen minutes, then add five to ten minutes per day until I can do the entire workout.

I'm determined to finish and start the Phine Body Workout. So far, so good. If you're fat and over forty, go buy Phine Body, turn it on, and get ready to sweat and feel the burn all over, especially in the lower body.",1357084800,82,1153,4.344186046511628
5450045,5,B00AM3B8KQ,I'm not a person who enjoys exercising but for 2013 I desired to be more active so I received this DVD for Christmas. The warm up is very Phaedra-licious and I enjoy her personality so it was a great way to start off the workout. The first round of exercise definitely had me sweating and with all those squats and lunges I most certainly felt the burn within 10 minutes!!! I literally had to pause the DVD and take a 2 min break during round 1. But I'm a novice so maybe that is why. But I know if I continue to do the exercises I will get that Donkey Booty in no time. Thanks Apollo and Phaedra!! ,1356912000,48,599,4.076271186440678
5450046,4,B00AM3B8KQ,"I tried the workout tape and on the cover Phaedra looks extremely small but on the video, she was a little bigger than on the RHOA. She also didn't seem as professional as other workout tapes but of course, shes Phaedra so I would expect that.

Anywho, I did the tape for 15 mins and my thighs and butt are killing me. I can barely walk. I know if I keep up, I can be lean and fit in no time. It was just so darn hard...My husband said its because Im using muscles I don't normally use. I definitely recommend it.

I also suggest that you stretch before the video. And have plenty of room to move about. The video is simple just a little ummm ghetto and vigorous.",1355788800,33,663,4.092307692307692

Which is not all together bad- at least I know it's doing something. It is a bit fast and you can't keep up with them all until you've done it a few times. The only thing I wish they did was explain what each exercise was doing- which muscles it works.

5450078,2,B00AM3B8KQ,"I purchased this DVD solely because I am a Phaedra fan, I always try to support business ventures when I can. But I couldn't make it past the first ten minutes of this DVD. The pace was awkward and seemed off beat. It could have potentially gotten better but I turned it off and resumed my normal workout routine. I may try it again one day but so far it's just been collecting dust. Save your money.",1394064000,2,400,4.207792207792208

5450080,3,B00AM3B8KQ,I did it once because it looks great but not something I would want to go through again.  I don't think Apollo is considerate of women's abilities and bodies.  This is what happens when you try and combine women and men exercises.,1386028800,2,230,4.4523809523809526

5450082,5,B00AM3B8KQ,This video is no joke. I must be really out of shape because the first day I did this video I was very sore two days later I could hardly walk up and down my steps..this is a great video it's fun you work right through instead of all the stopping and talking like other videos I've used,1385164800,,286,3.9482758620689653

5450084,5,B00AM3B8KQ,"I purchased this not long after it became available.  Minus the low budget of the video it's a great workout.  Phaedra is funny during the warm up.  I un-expectantly did an ab workout from laughing so much.  The main workout is divided into 2 parts so you can break it up over 2 days.  I mistakenly did both workouts on the same day and for the next week it hurt to bend my legs to walk, use the stairs or sit.  So if you haven't done squats or a leg workout in a while take it slow.  Otherwise great work out and I see the results.",1383091200,6,532,3.9622641509433962

5450088,2,B00AM3B8KQ,"The workout is decent but it doesn't provide you with the standard safety warnings when completing the exercises. For instance, when you are doing the lunges they don't tell you to ensure your knee doesn't extend farther than your foot. Failing to include this critical information could lead to serious soreness, small muscle tears, and injury.",1379635200,3,345,5.178571428571429
5450089,1,B00AM3B8KQ,"I was a fan of the concept of ""Donkey Booty"" but this video was quite amateur and definitely not what I was expecting.

5450092,5,B00AM3B8KQ,The video is a great buy.  Apollo's leg squat routine will really work you out.  Ladies....you might want to go at your own pace if it becomes too much for you as it will definitely make you sore afterwards.  It is a great workout that will eventually get you results in the end.,1374451200,2,279,4.226415094339623

So you guys are the bomb. I want all the videos that you guys make. Also Apollo when are you opening up your own  gym you are a beast. So people need to pay to come and see you.

I love Phaedra but I'm glad she was only doing the warm up because I couldn't deal with the warm up dancing, it was nice but I guess I was just ready to get with the actual cardio and core training. Apollo knows what he is doing, I could tell he was new at this because his counting was just a little off with the reps (counting while talking then start back with the counting was a little off) but other than that he delivered! My sides, thighs and arms were burning when I was finished. He is very professional and not to mention he is eye candy! Good job to both of them.",1370390400,2,716,4.013986013986014

5450113,2,B00AM3B8KQ,"This video was presented to have fun work out, energy, and motivation when presented on the tv show, The Doctors. First thing needing adjustment is the music. It does not make me want to participate because it is boring instrumental music. Another thing that distracted me from the work out was the female participating with the couple. She did not look professional nor motivates herself to do the exercise. She seemed to be unfocused as if this workout should have been practiced a couple of times before filming it. The work outs themselves were pretty good but after all the distractions and bad music my personal motivation to continue decreased. The video needs some more life and a more enlightened presentation.",1368835200,4,719,4.950413223140496

Apollo is also nice to look at so it helped me keep going and he is in good shape.  I have decided to try the second volume and I think it will be worth the money.,1367452800,2,320,3.661764705882353

5450127,1,B00AM3B8KQ,"I thought about buying Phine Booty however my friend bought and I just laughed and laughed which inadvertently worked out my abs in doing so. This is not a video for the woman wants to get in shape or even a primer/ jump start. It is pretty deceptive to market this as workout video when EVERYONE assumes you are NOT PREGNANT but just pudgy in need of a jump start. Phaedra has always had a body not be desired then to find out that she was 3 mos pregnant while shooting/promoting this long talked about video...pretty deceptive. Why not delay its shooting? Or market it as a prenatal workout? How immature and superstitious to hide your pregnancy AGAIN? Her cast mates could care less and if they do I'm almost 100% sure they would not wish harm. She can find an excuse for just about anything. I wish Andy would fire her. Or make changes as Nene implied during the reunion.

Maybe she could not hold off because she had to beat Kenya. She lies all the time as per the reunion. Mind you I give her two thumbs up for doing it anyways being pregnant and all. But what's up with the lying? Why ""motivate"" women to look out of shape?  Shady Fakedra strikes again. I hate money hungry people. Having legitimate hustle is one thing but to be dancing out of step just to make a dollar is pathetic. Funereal services for humans, funereal services for pets, stun guns, half-assed law practice and now the new black Jane Fonda. Chile sit down.

On a personal note, even though I wasn't blessed with Phaedra's genes in the booty area, I'd still rather do a workout video from someone who's booty is REAL, not silicone.  Also, if Kenya is such a top notch producer, why does her video look so cheap?  I bought both but was very disappointed and returned Kenya's video.  This is the one you want.

5450145,1,B00AM3B8KQ,"I purchased this workout video and found it to be kind of gross.  I think that Phaedra thinks that she looks so sexy and fit.  Personally, I think that Apollo should create his own workout video and keep it more serious without Phaedra.  Poor Phaedra -  I do feel sorry for her because of what happened with Kenya, but exercise is not her forte.  I hope that if she does create another exercise w/Apollo, that Phaedra lets Apollo instruct by himself.  I watch the Housewives of Atlanta and, of course, I had to buy Kenya's workout video as well.  I really loved Kenya's video and have already seen great results in a couple of weeks.  I really appreciate that Kenya's video wasn't all about sexual innuendos.  She is sexy and has a really beautiful body and keeps it serious. I hope that I can get my body to look just a little bit like her body (those abs and butt), but for now I am really happy with Kenya's video as she keeps me inspired and focused.  In any event, they are all laughing all the way to the bank!",1365897600,9,1016,4.3

I've purchased other workout videos and stopped using them because they were dull, boring and it felt like the same old same old routine. With this I laugh while watching and before I knew it, it was over and I felt energized. It's a great routine that gets you out of your seat, gets you moving and doesn't feel like you're exercising, but you are in fact burning calories and fat. Workouts should be fun and this is. I recommend it for everyone. Great Job Ms. Parks, LOVED IT!",1365638400,3,594,4.458715596330276
5450155,5,B00AM3B8KQ,"Being an avid watcher of RHOA since it's premiere, I was intrigued when I saw that both Kenya & Phaedra had workout videos. On the show, they seem both a bit outlandish, but that's what they're being paid to be.  So I don't prefer one housewife over the other. I am over 40 & in need of getting back in shape.  Skipping a meal & a walk around the neighborhood isn't keeping the body firm anymore.  Kenya's shape looks better than Phaedra's on television, but not really knowing what's real or fake with either's body, my friend & I decided to each purchase a video.  We both decided to give each a two week commitment, exercising daily & then swap videos after the two weeks.  I tried Booty Boot Camp first & then Phine Body.  After my 4 week commitment, I definitely have opinions and submitted them below.  I am sure my friend will be submitting a review as well, since she had very strong feelings on both videos.

My experience is hands down - Phaedra's video was better.  At first, when I started Phine Body, I was like are you kidding me?  It seemed so jokey ... not a serious workout video - like Boot Camp.  But I did feel the soreness a few days after working out with Phine Body, I did not feel any soreness with Boot Camp. I did lose a 1/2 inch from my thighs & my rear is tighter & not as jiggly after my two weeks using Phine Body, which I can't say totally was from Phine Body,  it was probably more the result of me working out for 4 weeks. And - while Phine Body seemed jokey, by the end of the first workout, I was having fun (as far as workouts go).  The time went by fast, where Boot Camp felt just like that to me, boot camp.  It was an EFFORT to actually work out with the Booty Boot Camp video.  With Phine Body I didn't dread putting the DVD in the player, I almost looked forward to it.

So, if you HATE working out, but find that you need to, Phine Body is the answer for you.",1365638400,4,1901,4.125

5450161,4,B00AM3B8KQ,I really like Phaedra concept on the show which prompted me to do it. The excercises are effective and gets very tedious throughout the video. The video in my opinion after veiwing it does what it offers if you stick with it. I like it however I did not care for the music. I can take instruction from a women who looks more like me and created something to help me maintain what I already have. Apollo is the lead instructor and Phaedra is co instructing. I only wish that they would have kept the fun energy up throughout the entire video. (it was a little quiet) But these guys are definately on the right track and I approve this message!

5450187,5,B00AM3B8KQ,Love this workout !! Phaedra and Apollo are so professional and adorable together. They are so classy and real!! So much talent and such a respectable couple. Look no further..this is the one to buy.,1365292800,7,199,4.714285714285714
5450188,3,B00AM3B8KQ,"Let me sum it up like this....the DVD is nothing but a bunch of variations of squats.  Period.

Unless you just want to support Phaedra and Apollo, save your money.  It definitely appeared amateurish (technique wise) but at the same time, it was nicely put together.  In their defense, you do feel a burn in your thighs and butt after doing the workout but anybody will if you do 30 minutes of squats!  A bit disappointing.  I bought this out of curiousity more than anything else.  And no, I will not be purchasing Kenya's video.

On another note, Apollo definitely steals the show here.  He's more of a natural than Phaedra. She needs to stick to practicing law.",1365292800,7,664,4.559322033898305
5450189,5,B00AM3B8KQ,"This video is great for a beginner like myself.  This video is not a full body workout but for the lower body. Waist and down. If u have bad knees this video is not for u bc it consists of lunges and squats. I can tell this video is effective bc after my first workout my legs were sore for a week. With continued use u will have a firm bottom and toned thighs and calfs. My only con is the counting is off at times and the warm up is blah. I chose to do my own warmup stretches. SN: I do not believe in the hype about growing a donkey booty. I just think this video is good at firming, lifting and rounding ur booty.",1365206400,5,617,3.858267716535433
5450190,5,B00AM3B8KQ,"I thought this workout was great!  Did it for the first time this morning.  I own about 20 different Exercise videos, and I thought this one did a good job of covering all the bases, but with a slightly different take on some of the exercises so it was unique and not boring. The routine had a good flow.  It was not easy, either. I am in fairly good shape; not a Beginner but not an Advanced workout junkie -I would say I'm ""Intermediate"" level- and I found this workout challenging with lots of room for me to improve because I couldn't do the whole routine and had to stop short on a few exercises.  Great job, Phaedra and Apollo!",1365033600,8,633,4.25
5450191,5,B00AM3B8KQ,I love this DVD. I normally do not workout but after the first day my body was sore for an entire week.

5450193,5,B00AM3B8KQ,"Ok so I order the dvd,not gone lie had it for about a month or so before I used it, omg my thighs, front and back was in pain even my butt, but I don't work out so that can have a lot to do with it, the next day I couldn't do the work out because the muscles were so tight, someone told me, it's going to be like that, because its building new muscles, I say all that to say this, I think it's going to work for me, because anything constant shows progress, I'll come back in a month and let y'all know what's up!  Bang",1364428800,4,519,3.761467889908257
5450194,3,B00AM3B8KQ,The workout was good but I think they should have recorded the video in 2 days instead of recorded it all at once. Phaedra is out of shape and she couldn't hang in the workout. That was not professional and it was tacky. Phaedra was breathing hard and not focused. You can't expect someone who just had a baby to be able to do such an intense workout like that. It made me not want to workout. I wasn't motivated after seeing all that huffing and puffing. She needed sometime to get her body back in shape 1st. Other than that Apollo did great. The production could have been better. Phaedra tried to hard to be sexy. Sexy is something that is NATURAL.,1364256000,7,652,4.308943089430894

5450196,5,B00AM3B8KQ,I had to check out both videos and found out that although Phaedras commentating is a little amateur it was cute and it was relating more to people who don't work out.  I liked it better when her husband was speaking because it was a more direct approach and got to the point.  I would recommend this video for people wanting to start off or for people who simply wants to target one aspect of their body.,1364169600,5,405,4.246753246753247

5450199,5,B00AM3B8KQ,I was very happy with this workout DVD. My sister and myself bought both volumes and are very happy with the results so far. I can already see the firmness and difference in my behind and also my legs and my stomach. I thought it was all talk when i seen it on the show but then i seen the reviews and thought may as well try it. We are very happy to say that we are very happy with the results.

5450200,5,B00AM3B8KQ,This is a fun and energetic video I have enjoyed every minute of it.  Apollo makes it worth every cent and Phaedra represents the everyday woman.  I hope there is a second video looking forward to it.,1364083200,2,200,4.378378378378378

5450205,5,B00AM3B8KQ,"When I purchased this video I did with the hopes that it will help with my back side. When I lost weight I also lost my behind and I did not want to do that. I have purchased workout videos just for the ""rear"" and all that it did was help with decreasing it and that was not what I wanted. But this workout video is just the opposite. If you are wanting to increase your rear, then this is the one for you and the added bonus would be your abs. This video will work them all and you will feel the burns after the first time you do the video. If you don't want to believe me or the others (viewers) then purchase it for yourself and you will see. Amazon has a ""money back"" clause so if you are not happy or satisfied then you can get your money back. But truth me ""You will not ask for it back.""",1363564800,34,794,3.8773006134969323

Phaedra and Pollo provided a nice overall presentation.

5450208,5,B00AM3B8KQ,"I loved this workout from the warmup to the cool down and everything in between.  Apollo and Phaedra made a terrific dvd.  I love where the workout takes places as it looks like they're somewhere in the Hollywood Hills in an all glass building.  It makes you think you're in a warm climate and makes you forget how hard you're working out and trust me you get a workout.  No way could I do all of the first workout but I tried and can't wait until I work myself up to be able to do both workouts.  I also have the other housewife's video and honestly I am not on either side but as far as workouts, Phine Body wins hands down.  This is a workout I will incorporate in my rotation at least twice a week.  The other I most likely will never use again unless I'm really bored.",1363132800,16,773,4.113333333333333

I went ahead and moved on to the workout portion and I learned what a WORKOUT really is! I felt the blood flowing and a little bit of an ache by the time I was finished.

So my husband said my booty wasn't a table like it use to be..well I bought this video and the movements are simple and they work.

I've been working out for many many years and can honestly say this video is effective for firming your hamstrings, quadriceps as well as your glutes. As far as ""Donkey Booties"" are concerned, either you're born with one, or you're not. No amount of exercising will make it larger however, exercising will make it firmer. I HIGHLY recommend this video.

Normally when watching an exercise video the group members know the routine and are right in sync with the instructor. Not so with this DVD. Since Phaedra swears that she is a southern belle who always remains professional and only works with the best the industry has to offer, I would venture to say that this was a colossal  failure. Save your money or ask someone who already owns it to make you a copy. I gave it 2 stars only because I believe Apollo is well educated in the world of fitness.

5450248,3,B00AM3B8KQ,"I have watched the DVD once before doing the exercises. I already know that routine is going to work your booty and you'll be happy that it's firm. I already have a natural booty. Not a donkey one and I'm happy it's not like a donkey. I don't know, but I just always find Phaedra a bit annoying with her comments and I did put that aside for the video. Again she was trying to be cute and yes I'm well aware she is engaging her audience to workout with her. I see her personality on the show and I'm not sure it's good here. Yes she wants it to fun, light hearted and to have her audience achieve the results she promises.
I did find the warm up too repetitious and that bores me. I also noticed that Phaedra herself didn't seem stable in doing a certain move when her hubby Apollo, instructed them to. My own body isn't good right now but my stability was at a better level that is required for results. With raising a child, being a lawyer and being a cast member of an entertaining show. Nah, she didn't look ready enough. Maybe she was nervous or tired, with that said. It shows to me and she maybe covering up that fact with her humor. I did read another review who asked ""Why is Phaedra in the video?"" Haha, Yes her husband is more pose and attractive and stable than his wife. She should just use that and have him do the videos with another man and woman. I did like the house they filmed the video it was calming interior and showed you can do this in your own home and feel relaxed and ready to burn some fat off your bum.

I found both Apollo and the other lady (?) where on their A+ Game. I didn't feel a chemistry with Phaedra and her assistant in the video and that just seems important to me and maybe that doesn't matter at the end of the day.  With all the chatter I expected more , energy? It just doesn't have what I need for myself. I'm used to watching the guy workout in scenic Hawaii with a grew that is what I expect in any workout video.

5450249,3,B00AM3B8KQ,"I think the DVD was OK. I feel it worked more on the legs than the Butt area.  I would have appreciated a better warm up routine.  The warm up was fun but I didn't feel it was effective for me.  Perhaps better suited for a beginner.

As for the main workout portion, I expected the second round of exercises to be different from the first, instead I got two rounds of the same thing. I could have just hit the repeat button on the DVD if I wanted to do it twice.

I would recommend this DVD for Beginners.  That said, I would love to see a follow up, the couple looks Great but needs more work on the actual workout routine.",1360886400,,624,4.032520325203252

I guess it's just hard to match up to Jillian Michaels. Instead of letting things just come naturally for them they seem to want to act or script out  what they are trying to do.

After the warmup where Phaedra tells you that she cant count so you're on your own or just follow her movements,lol, Apollo takes over and its lung, after lung, after lung, after lung. I need a full body work out with meduim to high cardio. I'm very disappointed because I was so excited about this dvd. All you do is stand in one/area place and lung. The music wasn't very good either. The same sound/beat throughout the whole first half. Seems that Apollo got his way by making this a mans workout rather than a womans workout. Im looking forward to Kenyas DVD. She says it will be a full body workout routine with her secrets and a meal plan. Cant wait for that!

I must admit I have tried other workouts for the buns and didn't really get that burn to let me know I was working my problem area.  Both of them did a great job.  I now have my supervisor and other coworkers working out with me and we love this video.  I know I will soon get that donkey booty I have always wanted to go with these lovely large breast of mine.

THIS product is the real deal and I am so happy I bought it.  I may not be able to complete the entire DVD because of feedings or not having the energy, but for what I can do, I have lost 10 pounds already!

I'll admit, as much I love Phaedra and Apollo, the video is a little underwhelming in terms of being professional and well-rehearsed. But I consider myself above average in physical activity and the next day I was sore!!! Apollo has you do a ton of lunges, which I personally would never do on my own, so it's good to have someone coaching you through it. Although I thought the work out was good and plan to continue doing it to lose weight and tone up... I really wish they would have spent a little more time preparing for the video.

I go to the gym 3times a week and I enjoy working out at home with my daughter and this is alot of fun but we are exercising having fun.  She also just had twin boys that are 2 and working out at home has been very good for her, and we are doing it together and we love the workout.

5450271,5,B00AM3B8KQ,"For those who are advanced exercisers, please disregard this review (it won't be helpful at all!)
I wanted to say that I am an out-of-shape mom of a toddler, I've lost about 30 pounds weight (still need to lose 15 more) via eating healthy and walking 5 miles/10,000 steps a day. That being said, I still need to tone up some areas, and wanted to start off by my lower body since that is my problem area. I purchased the Brazilian Butt Workout, and found it just too hard for me since I'm starting out with my strength training. So, after watching RHOA and saw Phaedra mentioning about a workout video that would not be as tough as others, I thought `why not try it?'
I am aware that Phaedra/Apollo are not personal trainers, or fitness gurus, however, it was refreshing to see a real woman with real curves do the workouts. To be honest, it felt like I was working out with a friend, since I have seen her for multiple seasons on RHOA. It gave me that extra motivation to complete the entire workout. Although it was not easy, (keep in mind I am still a novice), after some time I have been able to get the hang of the routine, and I already notice that  my legs are stronger, and my `donkey booty' is getting higher/firmer. I already notice that my size 12 pants are getting loose around my thigh, hip area, so maybe it's time to start looking for a smaller size! That's motivation enough for me to keep doing this workout ;-)

ETA: As of 3/13/13 (lucky numbers!) I'm down to a size 8 now! I've even started incorporating some free weights so I can intensify the workout. The best part - my inner and outer thighs are slimmed down and my 'donkey' is tighter! My ab-flab has reduced quite a bit too. I'm loving the results ;-)",1359504000,52,1726,4.340557275541796

5450273,5,B00AM3B8KQ,I love this video!  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.  I love energy and ease of the exercises throughout the entire workout.  This video makes you want to exercise and not miss a workout.  Great job Phaedra & Apollo!,1359417600,2,228,4.487804878048781

5450277,5,B00AM3B8KQ,I've been using this dvd with a friend for about 3 weeks and seeing results. This workout dvd is awesome. I think it's great for toning. I was spending money on toning classes at the local studio but I find thisjust as effective. It's actually the same moves that I'm accustom to from those expensive studio classes. I recommend doing lower body stretches beforehand. I love the fact that Apollo is a personal trainer so he knews what to do. Phaedra looks amazing. Most of us women look like her.  She and the other woman in video resemble everyday women not gym crazed ones!!! I give it 4-5 stars. I hope they produce a part two after Phaedra has her baby.

12.... How did they get the video so fast Hmmmmm! Anyways,the exercises were ok, but  nothing great, lots of squats  but you can do those for free.",1358121600,56,348,4.338461538461538
5450312,5,B00AM3B8KQ,Do your cardio but to work you AZZ!!' This video does that. My butt was hurting after and I can see a more tone behind!!!,1358035200,41,121,3.88
5450313,5,B00AM3B8KQ,Thank you Phaedra and Apollo for creating the perfect workout video!!!! I'm a busy woman that was losing my roundness as I get older. Your video has shown results after 3 weeks for me. Finally a video that works for me!! Well Done!!,1358035200,4,232,4.4186046511627906
5450314,4,B00AM3B8KQ,"Ok, so I love me some Phaedra Parks! As soon as I heard her workout DVD was available for purchase, I certainly knew I had to have it. So, I pushed play and immediately got my workout on. I think this is an awesome workout but there isn't any mention of proper form when doing squats and dead lifts. Because I know proper form, this isn't a problem for me but for a beginner, this could lead to knee and back injury. So I don't think this workout is for a beginner but definitely could be a lot of fun for an intermediate or advanced individual.",1358035200,14,545,4.150943396226415
5450315,5,B00AM3B8KQ,"I hate to work out, but I love this work out.... Well worth it! I'll have that ""Donkey Booty"" sooner then I thought, or at least something close to it!",1358035200,8,151,4.066666666666666
5450316,5,B00AM3B8KQ,this is a great workout targets all of the right areas (all those hard to do areas) I love it!!,1357948800,3,95,3.8
5450317,5,B00AM3B8KQ,I was happy to see that the DVD came in just 3 days from my order date.  I am really out of shape and got tired on the warm up.  I am very satisfied with the workout.  The only thing is that I wished the music had been more hard core Urban.  Apollo seamed as if he was talking to me.  I know I will try hard to keep this up because it seems as if I am exercing with someone I know personally.  It was most impressive that Phaedra did the exercises herself and did not use professionals.  I am glad that I purchased it.  Just a side note.  Apollo seamed a little winded at times.,1357776000,13,578,3.871794871794872
5450318,5,B00AM3B8KQ,"Well I am a super fan of Housewives of Atlanta and love Phaedra and Apollo as a couple!!!  When I saw that their workout video was already out I had to order my copy!!!

I thought this would be a light workout...H-E-L-L No!  Boy was I wrong!!  I read the reviews before and I saw people were complaining about not breaking a sweat.  Those people must be Billy Blanks, Jillian Michaels, and Tony Horton!!  This is a serious workout trust and believe!  Everybody knows to workout the booty you must do lots of squats (in my best Phaedra voice).  The video pretty much is all different types of squat exercises.  Phaedra is funny and says lots of funny things to keep you motivated through the warm up and Apollo sets in the lead the workout (he is nice to look at to keep you motivated).  She is a little bigger in the video (I saw this in reviews also, why does that matter) but if you are a true follower of the show we now see that she's pregnant so she was probably in the early stages of her pregnancy when filming the dvd.  In my opinion she a little thicker but not fat but she still looks great!

As for my personal experience, I sweat my mini donkey booty off!  My legs hurt the day after and I can feel it in my butt too!  I will continue doing the video!  The good thing about it is that you can go as hard, or not, as you want.  If you feel the workout is not hard enough then squat lower!  They are not professionals but they are fun, there's good music and the moves are familiar. A great alternative to liven up your boring workout routine or a good way to add lower body workout to what you already do.  They let you know that you don't need to go to the gym or spend lots of money to be fit.

In all, I would recommend this workout video and I already told all my friends about it!  My legs and booty are burning so I know its working.  What you put into the workout is what you get!  Keep at it and you will have a donkey booty in no time!",1357516800,95,1955,4.049608355091384
