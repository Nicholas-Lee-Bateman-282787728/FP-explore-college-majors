8436816,1,B004NTDEX4,"The film opens with ominous music and a shaky camera following Brandi Babcock who runs a firm that sells....? She demands perfection and needs to let some people go. This is a short 68 minute films that is still running credits 14 minutes into it. The director has named himself Creep Creepersin (I am assuming his parents didn't do that) which places him in the running for ultimate nerd. The camera was shaky during the entire filming, giving us a close-up of a woman's arm, cubicle wall, and a gurgling water cooler. Yes, at 68 minutes he needed to eat up film time.

Elina Madison, wife of said director douche, did a fairly decent job, unfortunately the script and budget needed more. The opening of the film has an unnecessary reading. If you listen to the two paragraphs, it was done in two takes with a noticeable splice pause in the middle. Seriously, the guy can't read two paragraphs without screwing up?

Clearly a film they had more fun making than it was to watch.
