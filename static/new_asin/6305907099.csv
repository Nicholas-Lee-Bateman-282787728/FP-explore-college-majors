1086844,5,6305907099,"I like Drew Barrymore, but my reason for renting this movie was Jon Stewart. Jon has a terrific comedic timing, and he shines whenever he's on screen. A proof of that is that the Daily Show got much, much better since  he started hosting it. As for this particular movie, it has a slow start,  and the first part is the hardest to get through. But once we move on to  the second things start connecting, and culminate in a sweet ending where  everything falls in place. And of course, Jon has his winning charm on!",939427200,4,514,4.322916666666667
1086845,2,6305907099,"This film was painful to watch. Thank goodness it is done in three different sections separating the film into the stories of different characters. If I were you, I'd skip the first ""chapter""  completely and go directly to Drew's character's chapter. No wonder Drew  didn't want to make this film! The only reason she was in it was because of  the contract she had with Miramax. They are just using her name to sell the  film. She made the best of it. And yes, she does shine on screen! Keep a  look out for the black and white movie sequence in this film. Hot stuff!",930960000,3,567,4.3619047619047615

1086966,3,6305907099,I only bought this movie because Jon Stewart was in it. He is as always adorable. You can't help but love him. The movie was weird and Jon needed to be in it more. Love ya Jon!,1115769600,2,176,3.7837837837837838
1086967,1,6305907099,"This movie was so stupid, everyone listens to Nina when she is clearly messing with their lives. They are stupid enough to believe her, and well I don't even know what else happens cause I saved myself and changed the channel.",1073260800,,226,4.536585365853658
1086968,4,6305907099,"A romantic comedy with Drew Barrymore, that must be added at once to Amazon's ""hunkmania list"" (this list contains movies with amazing handsome actors in the movies history), becouse you can find in a short role a manly beautiful young: Eric Thal. All other male actors in this film look so unpleasant to your sigth after the first appearance of Eric Thal that you are only waiting his next appearance in the comedy. It is a shame; this good and so talented actor with such extaordinary face and body has retired so young, so lets enjoy him in the 5 or 6 movies he did, in this DVD he looks like a perfect 10.",1061769600,4,609,4.350877192982456
1086969,2,6305907099,"The best part of this movie is Drew Barrymore. I really liked her character, Nina, who was so colorful, fun, flirty and a little schemer. :)This film tried a little too hard to be an ""indie"" film, told from two sides. It didn't work for me, but maybe it'll work for you.",1015545600,6,270,4.211538461538462
1086970,5,6305907099,"I adored this movie. The only people who wouldn't enjoy this romp through  a group's romantic problems are the one's who can not follow a plot well.  If you can sit down to a movie and watch it with even half your brain,  you'll understand the plot line and the cute little quirks it takes. Any  Jon Stewart fan, myself included, would love this movie. It's one of my  favorite movies, I just got it today and I've already watched it 3 times :  )  I recomend this to everyone!",968025600,8,476,4.222222222222222
1086971,4,6305907099,"I'm biased towards this movie form two reason. 1.)I've always loved 'B'  rated romantic movies and 2.)I adore Jon Stewart. This movie isn't for you  if you have problems following plot lines and actually watching the movie.  It's a cute, kicky little romantic movie about some people who, in my  opinion, need to get there stuff together. But I would recomend this movie  to anyone!",968025600,2,382,4.815384615384615
1086972,2,6305907099,"I must admit, the only reason I purchased this video was for the Jon Stewart parts. Unfortunately, there was not much to it. This movie sucked beyong suckiness, it creeped along at the slowest pace imaginable. The  acting done by Jennifer Beals and James Le Gros was horrible! It has this  Ally McBeal wannabe touch to it, when James Le Gros' character hears things  talk to him, like the typewriter, or stairs, or toothpicks, but this is not  the type of movie where that type of thing works. The whole movie is a big  befuddling mess, it's boring, trite and unoriginal.
And Jon Stewart did  not have enough screen time, but I digress.",949017600,7,636,4.584070796460177
1086973,3,6305907099,"I could see where this movie was trying to go. It had a Quintan Terrantino ""Pulp Fiction"" feel to it, but it didn't work.
I really liked Jon Stewart's character, but they didn't get into his character enough.  There is a movie out called ""Playing By Heart"" that has him in it  and it has 4 different love stories that all intertwine together.  If you  want to check out Jon Stewart in a good romantic comedy you should check  that movie out too.
Overall I give this movie about a 3.",948067200,2,482,4.252747252747253
7897504,2,6305907099,OK - There are 2 releases to choose from. A 2000 Miramax version with an anamorphic widescreen or a 2011 Echo Bridge (with Miramax on top of cover) Pan 'n' Scan (full screen version). Why EB would bother releasing full screen in 2011 beats me. Shop around and buy the older yet better Miramax release.,1505174400,,301,4.490909090909091

7897506,4,6305907099,"This movie is hard to find at the library and other streaming services. I only found it here in Amazon. (I don't intend to buy the DVD, and Im sure a lot of people now don't either now) I'm a big Jon Stewart fan and this was one of his first major supporting roles.

I really enjoyed it. The story is more like a teen romance movie with adults. Straight forward jealousy and the main guy's 'weirdness' in thought and action (for lack of a better term). Would I have watched it if Jon wasn't there? Maybe not.
Its not amazing memorable, its not awful enough to be memorable either. Its something you see, like it when you see it, then forget it kinda movie. So if you just want to watch to pass the time, here it is Your Moment of Zen!",1499990400,,734,4.1328671328671325

7897510,2,6305907099,"This was made in 2011??  If it were one of Drews first movies 'maybe' but this was a B movie at best.  The music was too loud and annoying.  The plot was disjointed and well, did I say ""plot"" because there wasn't much of one.  I gave it two stars because I actually finished watching the movie but it was painful.",1379808000,2,313,4.081967213114754
7897511,4,6305907099,"i just caught this movie the other night on regular broadcast television and really enjoyed it.  i had read reviews that led me to believe this would be a boring film.  after finally seeing it for myself, i beg to differ.  i found it extremely entertaining, not boring at all.  the story unfolded in a unique way, keeping you wondering what would happen next. i am a HUGE jennifer beals fan, and she was as gorgeous as ever, and turned in yet another fine performance. i will never understand why she never became a huge star.

 anyhow, i do not want to give anything away, you need to see it and judge for yourself. i hate it when reviewers give the whole movie away in their review. all i can say is, after seeing the broadcast version, i am anxious to see the uncut version on dvd. i think that this is a film to enjoy more than once, well worth adding to your dvd

collection if you enjoy unusual,fun and quirky romantic comedies.  any reviewers who said this was a boring movie must have never been in a serious relationship with a woman where another woman was involved as well. i have, and this movie reminded me of that, boy, did it.  only difference was, there were 2 other girls trying to throw monkey wrenches in my relationship. unfortunately for me, they succeeded.  if you want to find out what happens to the lovable sap in this movie, you need to see it, and you won't regret it.",1379548800,,1395,4.351351351351352

7897513,2,6305907099,"I'm a big Drew Barrymore fan so when I came upon this movie I was pretty excited to see it...but 45 minutes into this movie I was pretty much done with it.  Completely B O R I N G.

Jennifer Beals is a woman with a very jealous boyfriend ""Max"" - Drew Barrymore works with Max and has a serious crush on him.  She feeds him fuel for his jealousy...  But it was all sooo boring I didn't care what the outcome of the movie was.

I can't recommend this movie to anyone (unless perhaps you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep).",1349049600,2,529,4.0
