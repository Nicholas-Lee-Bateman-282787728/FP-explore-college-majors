8305279,4,B001GFHYFW,"I am not a pilates person, but after reading the reviews about this elsewhere, I thought I'd give this a chance.

Although I'm still not a pilates fan, I do like Kathleen's instructions. She takes the time to go over the moves in a five-minute overview. Then there's an 11-minute warmup. That's followed by a 23-minute workout.

She really takes the time to teach you each each, what to do, and how to breathe.  When doing pilates, all of these things are crucial.

What made this nicer than most pilates DVDs is that it's filmed outside, by a beautiful pool. The music is very nice and soothing.

I did this DVD on a day when I wasn't up for doing cardio or weights.

Kathleen is a very good instructor, and if someone is wanting to try pilates for the first time, I recommend this DVD.  She is a warm, encouraging instructor who takes the time to truly instruct, but does so in an interesting and helpful manner.",1430179200,,914,4.437125748502994

8305281,5,B001GFHYFW,This video breaks Pilates floor routines into easily digestible pieces.  Kathleen loves what she does and it shows.  I found it refreshing that she enjoys food and makes no apologies for it!  Chocoholic yet fit!  I love it!,1238630400,,223,4.7894736842105265

8305283,5,B001GFHYFW,"WOW! This is the best Pilates DVD I have ever tried.  Kathlene was a personal Pilates instructor for me in the past, and having relocated to another town, I am so proud to own this DVD.  It's like having her in my home, personally training me again, with a total body and mind workout. The results with Kathleen's personal training are unbelievable! If you follow the DVD your body and mind will be in better condition than you have ever known before. Very Highly Recommend",1224806400,,473,4.552941176470588
8305284,5,B001GFHYFW,"I watched the DVD for the first time last week and Kathleen will definitely show you new ways to get your body and mind working together.  All you have to do is to look at the shape she is in and read her profile on her website w[...] to know she has her act together!

Awesome video that everyone will benefit from if they just follow her simple steps that are unique to her video.  I would highly recommend this DVD and the price is a steal!  Great stocking stuffer for the holidays or just anyone looking to improve themselves!",1224633600,,530,4.27
8305285,5,B001GFHYFW,"I am brand new to Pilates and I must confess even though I have heard of Pilates through the years I have always dismissed it as a ""woman's exercise."" Yeah, I know, I'm sexist, but here's the thing, as a part time Kung Fu instructor I immediately saw the benefits Kathleen's video brings out with proper breathing & excellent body form.  Additionally, the work out is superior to most programs as I found myself amazed how quickly I felt a ""burn"" in areas I have failed to successfully and consistently work out with martial arts.  I will be adding Kathleen's instruction to my weekly Kung Fu classes and work out. It really is that good.  I also enjoyed the humor, sparkling personality and banter between Chef Cathleen and ""Pags""  The kitchen scene felt very ""real"" and it's easy to tell both ladies love what they are doing and are genuine friends.",1224633600,3,851,4.6158940397351
