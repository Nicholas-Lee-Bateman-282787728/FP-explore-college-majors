8337614,3,B001R9CY8E,"Tonight We Sing (2012) release from Fox Archives.
The quality of this dvd gives a whole new meaning to the words terrible, ghastly, and rotten. It is so dark in places that a violin section melts into the background as a blur. The color is so bad at times that it is almost unwatchable. I managed to look at half of it before my patience gave out. What are you guys at Fox doing, scope films in flat format when we all have wide screen television sets, is there a conspiracy to blacken the once great Fox image. Warner, Sony/Columbia, and Universal are the items to purchase. I will not be purchasing any further dvds from the Fox Archives until you lift your game. DaViD.",1356739200,13,672,4.384
8337615,1,B001R9CY8E,"Being a once well-respected and major Hollywood Studio, 20th Century-Fox of today should be utterly ashamed of the way they are treating consumers with their shoddy, lack-lustre and tawdry transfers of many of their Technicolor 'Fox Classics' releases, (and some black and white features as well).  Gone are the days of quality product presentations when true first class showmanship dictated in all their movie releases.  Darryl would turn in his grave today!

This recent release (November 27, 2012), of 'Tonight We Sing' looks as though it was transferred from a 1980s bootlegged VHS.  The Technicolor image is under par and very dark, which makes the colors over-saturated.  By the end of the film I felt nauseated from trying to decipher the images on screen, especially in all of the opera presentations.  However, there were a few brighter scenes towards the end of the film when there was full light, as much of the film takes place under gaslight replicated conditions.  However, they have released decent prints of 'Nob Hill' and 'Where Do We Go From Here?' and the Technicolor is quite acceptable.  Unfortunately, about 11 minutes has been cut from the original 1940s movie release of 'Nob Hill.'

If Fox continues to release such bad quality color and black and white material, including the disastrous television 4x3 Pan and Scan transfers of the CinemaScope films, 'The Best Things in Life Are Free' and 'Sing Boy Sing' etc, they will sink further into the abyss, especially in the present HD digital age as most consumers have widescreen TVs, and to scam us with inferior quality transfers is a slap-in-the-face insult and a waste of our money, but a quick buck for them!

Fox should realize that 'classic movie collectors' around the world are quite a passionate lot, and word-of-mouth reaches far and wide.  Surely, they must have decent prints in their vaults in the correct ratios, but obviously they can't be bothered making new transfers.  It's cheaper (and nastier) to release what they may have transferred years and years ago to analog videotape for TV screenings.

If they continue along the same shameful path they will eventually make their DVD-R business redundant.  In the past when they properly replicated their titles to DVD (the Betty Grable and Alice Faye box sets are good examples), the quality was superb.

Shame! Shame! Fox!  It's about time you lifted your game!  The quality of most of the Warner Archive and Sony Classic DVDs run rings around your present product!",1355270400,18,2505,4.997590361445783
8337616,4,B001R9CY8E,"A slow start but interesting.  The musical talent is excellent.  Jan Peerce singing in the duet from Madam Butterfly was outstanding.  A must for the music and performers alone.
