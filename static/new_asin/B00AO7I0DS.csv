8555262,2,B00AO7I0DS,"The music background is definitely for pre-teens. Same so much of the time with the narrator. As other reviewer said, so many are the rapid cutaways from one scene to another that you have to keep going back and pause to take them in. In short, an infomercial for preteens with all you'd expect from that. There are so many places shown I give it two stars.",1528588800,,357,4.343283582089552
8555263,2,B00AO7I0DS,"While the scenery is beautiful, let's not keep the shot any longer than a second or two so people can't actually take in what they're seeing. The quick cuts to a different scene, a different picture... I gave up before finishing the first episode. When I watch documentaries like this, I actually want to see the shots of the scenery being discussed. I think I would have enjoyed this if I didn't miss four shots just because I had to blink.",1525910400,,441,4.45679012345679
8555264,2,B00AO7I0DS,"I'm a tour director and guide and have led thousands of people to Yosemite and many of the National Parks over the years.  I can't make it through the first episode.  There are so many glaring errors and incorrect information.  Just some examples. Yellowstone was the first park but Yosemite has always been considered the crown jewel of the park system, not Yellowstone.  The scene from Glacier Point in Yosemite they show the Ahwahnee Hotel (Majestic Hotel) and say it is the visitor's center.  It's one of the grand lodges, not even close to the visitor center or even that small.  It is not a 5000 ft elevation gain to the top of Vernal and then Nevada Falls on the Mist trail.  Its about 2900 ft.  at one point there is a view of Vernal Falls just barely running (not sure why they used this video as Vernal Falls on the Mist Trail is spectacular in the Spring to early summer) and a comment comes on the screen saying it is Yosemite Falls and it is the tallest Fall in N.A.  That is correct but, the video is showing Vernal Falls.  I quit at this point.  The video and voice over are really good but, a lot of the information is way off or incorrect.  I'm surprised and disappointed coming from Lonely Planet which is a guide book company.",1517270400,3,1245,4.388646288209607
8555265,5,B00AO7I0DS,I watched this on July. After buying a set of dads off Amazon I put in national treasures and I found it boring and more of a history lesson for 5 th graders this show had a better narrator and interesting facts,1403654400,,211,4.0476190476190474
8555266,3,B00AO7I0DS,"This is a 2 disc DVD set that has about 4 hours of information on the National Parks. It is organized by topic not parks. It covers the following: 1. Best Parks for Jaw-Dropping Scenery, 2. Best Parks You've Never Heard Of, 3. Hottest Parks, 4. Best Parks for Creature Features,5. Best Freaks of Nature, 6. Best Parks for a Deep Freeze, 7. Best Parks to Escape the Crowds, 8. Best Parks to get Wild and Wet, 9. Best Parks to Star in Your Own Western,10. Best Parks for the Rise and Fall.

There are also extras - short films/information clips on: Wind Cave, Hot Springs, Grand Teton, Guadalupe Mountains, Kena Fjords, Great Basin, Olympic, Rock Mountain, Isle Royal.
Arrows are inserted with information and photos are blocked off with `you must do this'.
Because the type of activity and sight are the topics, there is much repeating of each park. Yellowstone and Yosemite are covered many times, sometimes with the same film clip and almost the same narration. The commentary seems to try to have a `hip/funny' attitude including describing Native American pictographs as `maybe signs saying the next gas is 200 miles'. At points the film is sped up or moved backwards. The pictures often are jumpy, moving from scene to scene rapidly.
This seems to try to be more of a pop culture film than a documentary. If that is what you are looking for - this is it.",1377993600,3,1358,4.6115702479338845
