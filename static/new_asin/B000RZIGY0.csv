2876949,5,B000RZIGY0,"In the gay enclave of West Lahunga, ""Rick & Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple In All The World"" (2007) are your typical thirtysomething guppies, complete with an attitudinal spoiled cat named Pussy. Rick is the sensitive one, a trendy Fillipino-American computer programmer, deeply in love with Steve, a gym-obsessed hottie who sells overpriced houses to the locals.  Rick (or is it Steve?) is the father of the child being co-parented by their best friends, Kirsten (a boyish lipstick lesbian) and her partner Dana (a sarcastic self-described J.A.B., Jewish American Bulldyke.)  They're also friends with Chuck, a 50ish HIV+ paraplegic, and his shallow but devoted 19 year old boytoy, Evan, and neighborhood ""fag hag"" Condi Ling.

When I caught the first episode of this series on LOGO, I was a bit taken aback by the rather unapologetic and definitely non-PC tone of some of the humor, including the stereotypes (Rick and Steve are shallow, often sex-obsessed, don't know what end of a hammer to hold, and depend on Dana to do any minor repairs around the house) and the concept of having a character with HIV, now healthy on the new drugs, using his antibody status as a way to get extra attention and considerations from others.  I relaxed a bit by the second episode, and began to better understand and appreciate the intentional ""in your face"" tone of the show that made the humor work all the better.  (Apparently, I'm not the only one who found this taking some getting used to, as actor Peter ""Queer As Folk"" Paige - the voice of Steve - mentions in the DVD extras, that the intent was to make a gay urban Simpsons, where you can get away with things using cartoon characters that you wouldn't dream of doing with live actors.  For example, we laugh at Homer stranging his son Bart, but could you imagine the outcry if John Goodman had stranged a misbehaving DJ on ""Roseanne""?)  It is indeed a topical, creative, daring and highly original series, dealing humorously with a myriad of situations including GLBT cruises, ageism, swinging, codependence, homophobia and other forms of bigotry.  My personal favorite of the six episodes is #2, which features an Ebony and Ivory, an interracial lesbian couple, who carry political correctness to a hysterical extreme, in that they don't want to even know their own baby's gender (They close their eyes when they change diapers) in order to avoid possibly pushing him/her into any stereotypical ""gender roles.""

The episodes are still on rotation on LOGO-TV, with some clips also available for free on their website.  But I recommend renting or buying the (rather bargain priced) DVD, for all six episodes as well as some interesting extras, including segments on how the stop-action annimation is done, interviews with Peter Paige (Steve), Wilson Cruz (Evan), Alan Cumming (Chuck) and Margaret Cho (Condi), and 12 brief ""digisodes"" that were not aired.  With well-deserved extra points for originality and chutzpah, I'll give it five stars out of five.",1188864000,10,3002,4.972055888223553
2876950,5,B000RZIGY0,"The lives of gay Lego's, how cool is that?!?  And this set is coming out right at the end of the first season.  Now that's how you do a DVD release!  Buy early and buy often!  The holidays are coming up, so think of stocking stuffers!",1188086400,,234,4.021739130434782
2876951,5,B000RZIGY0,F*ing hilarious!!! This is one of my new favorite shows! My only wish is that Amazon Unbox would get episodes up faster. iTunes seems to get them up to a day before they are available on Amazon!!!,1186790400,4,196,4.324324324324325
2876952,5,B000RZIGY0,"I only watched one episode on cable, and my friends and I were laughing non-stop throughout the entire show.  I cant wait to get my hands on this DVD!!!",1186444800,,152,4.241379310344827
2876953,5,B000RZIGY0,"This stuff is hilarious.  Originally a set of stop-motion shorts, they've been adapted into a season of animated shows.  The humour is so dead-on it hurts.",1184112000,9,155,4.923076923076923
2876974,5,B000RZIGY0,The endless tears and laughter from watching this is show is FANTASTIC.  I would definitely recommend this show to anyone.,1380240000,,122,5.1
2876975,5,B000RZIGY0,I've seen this before and every time I tell someone about this episode I laugh my ass off.  It's just a silly comedy of errors and the dialog is cheeky.,1379721600,,152,4.066666666666666
2876976,4,B000RZIGY0,"Pretty much every gay stereotype is featured in this charming queer-friendly story of Rick, a genius Filipino slash insatiable bottom and his partner Steve, a ""straight-acting"" gym queen who live in the fictional gay village of West Lahunga Beach. Rick is friends with lipstick lesbian Kirsten and her wife Dana, a mullet-wearing butch. Their journey to have a baby -- with a helpful donation from Rick (mixed, unbeknownst to the lesbians, with a contribution from Steve) -- is a continuing storyline throughout the first season. Using stop action animation, each episode explores various misadventures of our heroes as they survive circuit parties, gay cruises, parental visits and the interference of HIV-positive paraplegic Chuck, his latino tweaking twink boytoy Evan and everyone's favorite alternative lifestyle companion (translation: hag), Condi. Throw in some musical numbers and sexual situations (that you can only get away with when the characters are puppets) and you've got delightful fun from director Q. Allan Brocka that is much more accessible than his gay film festival efforts, Boy culture and Eating Out. The humor isn't for everyone and it gets a little stale if you watch all six episodes at once but, overall it's still good clean fun.",1376784000,,1259,5.3
2876977,3,B000RZIGY0,"Enjoyed watching, but it doesn't have a lasting effect on you.  Spend the money if it's extra.  Not in place of something else you may want.",1363478400,,140,4.346153846153846
2876978,5,B000RZIGY0,Q. Allen Brocka is absolutely amazing. His dialogue and down to earth views of a sampling of the homosexual community is extremely fun and playful!,1363392000,,147,4.92
2876979,4,B000RZIGY0,Rick and Steve is a fun movie for anyone who likes gay humor. The puppets are humorous and the story lines are funny.  We would recommend it.,1353283200,,141,4.222222222222222
2876980,4,B000RZIGY0,You have to first know what you will be watching. and then expect anything to happen. graphic language but that gets pushed aside becuase they aren't real people on the screen. i found it funny!,1350345600,,194,4.571428571428571
2876981,5,B000RZIGY0,"I LOVE Rick & Steve. It such a great show to watch, but to have them leave all of us hanging after the church scene is not right. They need to fisih what they started. Ohh, the dvd is awesome!",1293753600,,192,3.825
2876982,5,B000RZIGY0,"I own both seasons of this show. If you like comedy that's a bit outrageous (think South Park), then you'll like this show. The production quality is high, the voice actors are great (Peter Paige, Wilson Cruz, Alan Cumming, Margaret Cho, and more), and best of all it's FUNNY. The writing is really snappy. I was very disappointed that it wasn't renewed for more seasons.",1273017600,,371,4.723076923076923
2876983,5,B000RZIGY0,"This is a favorite of mine series, very clever, acid, not so correct, funny and GAY. AMAZING.",1248048000,,93,4.529411764705882
2876994,5,B000RZIGY0,"For the passed few years, friends have been talking about a show on Logo, a cable channel that presents gay themed, or gay-friendly progamming.
Rick and Steve has to be one of the most original shows i have seen in years. I was hooked from the first show i watched.
I won't repeat what many reviewers mentioned, but will stress that this show at times is vulgar (thankfully), and very funny. So, it's not intended for the kiddies despite it's cartoonish look.
Knowing it takes the producers alot of time to create the show, am hoping for more. I already have Series 2.
If you prefer mindless and sometimes political humor with sexual references thrown in with tons of insults, this is for you.",1247097600,,693,4.596774193548387
2876995,5,B000RZIGY0,I have been waiting for this to come out it is great! I love it. Now I am waiting for sordid lives the seasons to come out.,1238198400,,123,3.5925925925925926
2876996,5,B000RZIGY0,"I have never before encountered a show like this one. My older sister recommended this to me because, when I was a child, legos were my favorites to play with. I thought that this adaptation of lego life was hilarious. I recommended it to several of my friends, most of which have purchased the series since. Good job LOGO!!!",1236297600,,325,4.52542372881356
2876997,5,B000RZIGY0,"My partner and I caught a clip of this between a movie on Logo - and rented it from Netflix. After episode 1 we ordered it from Amazon - this is an hilarious show - well scripted. The humor lasted from episode to episode - and everyone Gay and Straight would find this entrancing.
The cliches are great and the puns are groaners but we are convinced if you don't roll on the floor with laughter after episode 1 - then you won't find anything humorous....
Anyone who can animate ""Lego"" like characters and turn them into these stereotypical but unoffensive portrayals of life in a gay village is a pure genius.
Rick and Steve may be the happiest gay couple in the world, but their bussom budies in the cast are just as cool - we loved Dana, Chuck, Evan and Kirsten too ... not forgetting Pussy ...
A witty line from the show Dana - ""I won't ever mess with Pussy again""- that made our laughter lines grow bigger.
A+ and now we have season two on delivery for the 3rd ...",1235779200,,968,4.266304347826087
2876998,5,B000RZIGY0,"The first season of ""Rick & Steve"" is true to life. It is a remarkably accurate piece on life in the gay ghetto and suggests that the most serious, accurate and precise account of some of the more important social issues surrounding LGBT can be delivered in a funny, cheerful and colorful package. I wish they would show this in every classroom in the world.",1232496000,,358,4.523076923076923
2876999,5,B000RZIGY0,This series is so funny. It is difficult to describe the incredible amount of thought the writers put into making this show. Watch it and you will roll on the floor with laughter. I can't wait for season two.,1231286400,,208,4.358974358974359
2877000,5,B000RZIGY0,"Funny, it is a Queer As Folk, cartoon version
Everybody will see itself or friends in these caracters, they are so typical!",1223856000,,123,4.636363636363637
2877001,5,B000RZIGY0,This animation is awesome - can't get enough of it and each time that we watch it we find more to laugh about. Really well worth adding to a collection and can't wait for series two.,1214784000,2,182,4.083333333333333
2877002,5,B000RZIGY0,"Irreverent doesn't even begin to cover it.  No topic is off limits in this series and stereotypes are skewered left and right.

Easily shocked and offended?  Go elsewhere.  But if you can laugh at yourself and even more at everyone else then you'll love this series as much as I did.

I just hope there's more to come.",1213401600,2,318,4.413793103448276

2877014,3,B000RZIGY0,"The thought of lego-esque characters in the Gay here-and-theres of life is truly amazing. I loved most every moment of each episode in this collection. However, there were a few moments that became a bit too sordid and, how should one say, too graphic where the imagination could have simply taken over and come out with a much more satisfying conclusion to an awkward/sexual/conflict situation.",1209081600,4,395,5.092307692307692
2877015,5,B000RZIGY0,"It was bueno, funny funny funny, very stereotypical funny. I bought it and love it, cant wait for more to come out.",1201219200,2,115,4.2727272727272725
2877016,5,B000RZIGY0,"This is a great series. Not for kids due to the explicit jokes but if you like South Park and Avenue Q, you'll probably enjoy Rick & Steve!",1199836800,2,139,4.0
2877017,4,B000RZIGY0,"Does everything that broadcast TV won't do. While very stereotypical of a section of gay life it raises serious questions about body fascism, monogamy, inter racial & inter generational relationships and family but does it all with humor. It doesn't really answer any of the questions it raises but then it's not meant to, its good nature fun that will offend those who find the idea of any type of gay relationship immoral or repugnant.",1198368000,,437,4.84
2877018,5,B000RZIGY0,"For LGBTQ-friendly types who enjoy postmodern cartoons (think Southpark meets a gayer SpaceGhost mixed w/ Harvey Birdman living in a gay ghetto), this is absolutely spectacular. I discovered this series as a stressed out first-year law student, and it has kept me sane and happy. There's cattiness, bitchiness, flaming queens, creepy sugar daddies, song-and-dance numbers with suggestive scenes of threesomes eating hot dogs and tacos, pregnant bull dykes, and so much more. I cannot recommend this series highly enough.",1197504000,2,520,5.594936708860759
2877019,5,B000RZIGY0,"Hi, I live in the United Kingdom, so not being able to see this show on TV first I decided to buy it based on the previous good reviews it has got. I was not disapointed, this is a great show, by the time I got to the end of the second episode I was hooked and watched the whole dvd. I hope they make another series, this show could really take off if it goes global. I love the characters, the style of the show, and its well written. This show could become a gay classic, its certainly got lots of potential.",1197158400,,510,3.9611650485436893
2877020,4,B000RZIGY0,This show is very entertaining. i loved it. i hope to see more of this show.,1196467200,,76,3.8125
2877021,4,B000RZIGY0,"I must say that i first thought that Logo was getting a bit desperate when  i saw that it looked like some kid had taken the ""Lego"" video camera system you could make movies with and made a show. I now realize these are legally distinct from ""Legos"", ""Megabloks"", or ""Duplos"" and far more entertaining. I had seen someone somewhere compare this to South Park and indeed in the extras they mention it is from studios that helped to produce that show.

This show had me amused by the mere introduction with plinky quiet little vocalizations that go from one to many as the theme song proceeds to a huge over the top chorus by the time they introduce Rick and Steve. This show is FUNNY, and extremely quotable. In fact the characters even poke fun at their own personalities and characters from time to time. Rick is a Filipino bottom. He's got a few body issues (what gay man doesn't) but he's got a genius level IQ which is underplayed due to his submissive nature. Unlike Bush, Rick truly is the Uniter of the cast and does it frequently. Steve is about average intelligence but has a body built like a block. He's sweet and really cares about Steve but has a very adventurous side that Rick does not always share. Dana is your stereotypical lesbian, she's extremely aggressive towards men probably because of problems with them in the past which i think is hinted at in the way she talks about men. Dana and Steve do NOT get along and i've loved the banter that they shoot back and forth. I also have to say that Dana has some of the funniest lines in the entire show, her sharp, uncompromising viewpoint and strength is what Kirstin admires. Kirstin (her wife) is quiet kinda like Rick in fact they've been friends for ""a long time"". She is socially aware, at about the same level as Dana but she cares far more about how what she says and does impacts others. Chuck is a ""pillar of the community"" he's HIV+++, in his late 50's, and confined to a wheel chair. He has a darker sense of humor than most characters and absolutely delights in torturing them. He's also openly extremely kinky which is a bit surreal at times because the characters gloss over it not because they're ignoring him but because they're so used to it it doesn't shock them but it hits the audience as a bit of a surprise. Evan is 19 and is Chuck's bf, he's a complete air head who tweaks on so many drugs they end up sort of balancing him out. He's extremely dumb but loveable nonetheless. He loves Chuck and as much as they fight and taunt each other it's sweet because they both know they were made for one another (quite literally).

The cast is an all star collection of actors and actresses who really bring these characters to life. I was entertained by every storyline in here and the digisodes are VERY worth watching, especially the one on straight jokes (quick! What'd you call a septic tank full of straights?).

The downsides, this dvd is SHORT. The shows are 25 minutes long and there are exactly 6. This show's first season is as much of a pilot as the first episode is. Although the show has some plot holes in it, it took me a time or two of watching to notice the holes and they are minor. In the interest of being critical, Rick and Steve is a good first attempt at a show like this on Logo and you should take that into consideration while watching this. 6 episodes, minor plot holes in some episodes, and limited extra content are the worst of what you get.

Is it a good attempt for a new network with little funds? Very much so. Is it worth it's price? Depends on the person, i would actually recommend trying to catch a show on Logo or maybe renting it first to see how you like it. I watched one episode on Logo and ordered this expedited shipping. Personally i think the show has great potential and I'm dying for next season. Buenos Smooches all!",1192579200,3,3847,4.405063291139241

NO apologies to anyone  equal opportunity offenders-nothing is off limits from gay to str8 to religion or politics. If you get offended easily this is NOT for you: if you ahve a sense of humor that has a twist to it then it is.,1475971200,,328,4.377049180327869
8203243,5,B000RZIGY0,"Probably the funniest, completely un-PC bit of animation I've seen in a decade or so. The characters, scenes, the banter and writing are just hilarious pulling many punches in a time on film & television where so many"" trying not to offend'.
From the stereotypes to the situations it's laugh a minute in that we can poke fun at a number of things only because it's LEGO/puppets
and not human actors.
Some people are so wrapped up in PC with no sense of humor, they have to play Cards Against Humanity to have a dark thought or
think up bizarre situations i.e. Michael Jackson jokes in CAH.
