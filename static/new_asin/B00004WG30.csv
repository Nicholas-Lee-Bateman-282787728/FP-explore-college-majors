7925059,5,B00004WG30,"The final two episodes of Red Dwarf Series 8.  Lister and company are forced to think of a way to deal with the T-Rex now rampaging around the ship in Part 2 of 'Pete'.  In 'Only the Good', a virus threatens to destroy the ship, and Rimmer finds a mirror universe in which he is the captain and Hollister is his underling.  The original ending of 'Only' was never used, but considering the replacement ending had to be written hastily, the writers did a really great job, as it's both moving and hilarious.

The added 'Can't Smeg, Won't Smeg' is a send-up of a cookery series, is presumably only intended for completists.  But having said that, if you didn't catch the two Red Dwarf episodes when they were on TV, then this tape is well worth owning.",1104537600,,750,4.445255474452555
