HORRIBLE acting, no story.
Silicone.
Absolute waste of time.
Garbage!",1407542400,7,120,5.368421052631579
1675983,1,B00005Y881,"I bought this, thinking it was ""I spit on your grave"", and when I watched it, it was sooooo horrible. You could tell it was like shot by a low budget Canadian film crew or something. The uhm, killer, is quit hilarious. And the way he is, ""killed"", is worth seeing. Only watch it if you score it for like a dollar!",1130112000,5,313,4.064516129032258
1675984,1,B00005Y881,"Even though the storyline is alright the movie is not worth seeing. The sound is aweful, the acting is bad, the filiming sucks and the special effects are below b-movie. This movie is only worth seeing for the full nudity, and even that is sub-par.
I would only suggest this to people who collect indie or b movie horror.",1089763200,7,321,4.4576271186440675

7956877,2,B00005Y881,"Trying to pull off of movie it's closely named like, doesn't quite succeed. No real surprises and the gore is pretty amateur. Whereas spit on your grave is pretty hard core and repugnant, this one only reaches creepy and unfulfilled. Want proof, spoiler coming. One death scene has our maniac find one girl alone on a bed. He takes his time tying her to the bed and gagging her only to SLIT HER WRISTS.... Seriously ! Is that the most gruesome you can muster to a helpless victim ? True, there are some moments later in the film which feature a wood chipper but that is so mainstream(Fargo).  All capped off by a farm tractor ride to escape the clutches of the maniac. Seen some worse, seen a lot better. If it wasn't trying to steal the thunder of another movie, it might get 3 stars, as it tries to piggyback and falls far short it gets only 2.",1427587200,12,846,4.320754716981132
7956878,4,B00005Y881,"This is a retitled SOV movie made in 1995 or 1992. Its original title was probably SURVIVAL 101, and I can't find it under that title at the IMDB. It's a direct to video slasher that's made on VHS, and it's basically just for fans of these cheap and violent video movies. Within the first 10 minutes, there's topless nudity and a graphic and gory scene of a woman having her fingers cut off with a chainsaw that's shown in black-and-white. There's also another topless scene during the first 10 minutes, but then the movie slows down. After the beginning gore and nudity, this group goes to this house in the woods and there's a big storm that provides some good atmosphere; so it's off to a good start. However, it then begins to drag in parts. There's another nude scene later on that has full nudity with a good looking woman, and it has its moments with the gore; even though the overall body count isn't as high as some might have hoped. The scenery is pretty good at times, it's decently directed, and it's well scored. The acting is what you would expect for this type of cheap VHS movie, but most people who buy lots of video horror flicks don't care about the acting. The main problem is that it needs more violence and nudity, instead of inserting some unnecessary filler. The climax of the film is pretty good, and the killer here displays the typical superhuman type strength that's found in many other slashers. If you like cheap retro exploitation flicks, you might like it.

The quality on this old EDEN release DVD looks decent, but doesn't look well mastered in any way. I've seen much worse quality, though, and I saw that it has just been rereleased on DVD again. Hopefully, the new release will look better.  This DVD has no chapter stops or menu screen.",1409011200,,1774,4.5233644859813085
