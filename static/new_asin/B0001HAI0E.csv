2002490,5,B0001HAI0E,"Samurai Jack epitomizes the balance of crucial - but very hard to master - elements in the art of animation.
The storytelling is engaging, exciting, and absolutely not condescending to the audience.
The posing is superb. Most of the action and energy of the show is contained in extremely pushed, clearly silhouetted, easily readable poses.
The timing and pacing is breathtaking. The long periods of absolute tension or bliss interlaced with lightning fast action sequences are intentionally designed to maximize the experience.
The sound/music design is in perfect harmony with the animation. Their presence (or lack of it) adds to the storytelling.
The backgrounds and layouts are designed in a style reminiscent of Maurice Noble's masterful compositions for Chuck Jones cartoons, strengthening the characters, leading the eye to the action, creating a visual balance and a palpable mood.
Samurai Jack is created from storyboards, not scripts, a technique that has given birth to the greatest animation in the world, from Warner Bros. and Disney in the 40s to contemporary classics like Ren and Stimpy. The fact that the scripted 'King of the Hill' is competing in the same category as live action sitcoms reminds me to a quote from the late Master Animator Lee Mishkin: ""If live actors can do it, why animate it?"".",1081296000,,1317,5.158878504672897
2002491,5,B0001HAI0E,"Samurai Jack is great because it combines fantastic writting with a somewhat unique, stylized look and feel. It's nice to see that Cartoon Network is beginning to release series such as Jack on DVD. I don't know will there be any special features but I can give you a basic synopsis of the episodes included. The set will probably skip the 2 hour movie (episode I-III) since that has already been release seperately. Here are the other episodes
IV-Jack, the Woolies, and the Chritchellites-Jack helps a group of supposedly savage beasts called ""Woolies"" who have been enslaved.
V-Jack in Space-Jack helps a group of scientists who want to escape into space.
VI-Jack and the Warrior Woman-Jack seeks a strange jewel in the desert, accompanied by a mysterious woman.
VII-Jack and the Three Blind Archers-Jack hears of a mysterious island which possess a well that can grant any one wish.
VIII-Jack vs. Mad Jack- Jack must face an evil version of himself.
IX-Jack Under the Sea-Jack seeks a race of amphibians living in an underwater city who have a time machine.
X-Jack and the Lava Monster-Jack is summoned by a Lava creature under the earth.
XI-Jack and the Scotsman-Jack makes a new freind.
XII-Jack and the Gangsters- Jack joins some gangsters.
XIII-Aku's Fairy Tales-Aku tries his hand at propoganda.
XIV-Jack Learns to 'Jump Good'-Jack befriends a group of high jumping creatures.
XV-Jack Tales- Three Tales of the Samurai.
XVI-Jack and the Smackback-Jack is forced to be a gladiator slave.
XVII-Jack and the Scotsman, Part 2-Jack and the Scotsman must rescue the Scotsman's wife.
XVIII-Jack and the Ultra-robots-Jack must fight a group of robots, each with a special weapon.
XIX-Jack Remembers the Past-Jack sadly remembers his childhood days.
XX-Jack and the Monks-Jack climbs the Mountain of Fatoom in search of truth.
In ALL cases... there is more to these episodes than the sum of there parts. Samurai Jack is probably one of the greatest TV shows of all time.",1079481600,22,1969,5.0244648318042815

2002495,5,B0001HAI0E,"The announced release of the first season of the brilliant animated series, Samurai Jack, is a genuine cause to rejoice! Finally, a studio understands the value of an animated series in a timely manner. One can only hope that other studios will get the message that animated properties can and are just as popular as live-action series and movies.
Samurai Jack was created by the multi-talented and truly gifted Genndy Tartakovsky, who also created the fantastic Dexter's Laboratory. Samurai Jack combines innovative and imaginative storytelling with a captivating animated style that is at once simple and evocative. The series tells the story of a Japanese samurai who has embarked on an epic mission to fight evil and save his world.
In the distant past, the samurai, who calls himself ""Jack,"" is the son of an emperor captured by the evil Aku, a shape-shifting wizard. The young Jack is sent away not only to survive but to train his mind and body in all forms of martial arts so that he will eventually be capable of vanquishing Aku.
Jack returns as an adult and reunites with his mother who gives him the sacred sword of the samurai to defeat Aku and rescue his father.
Armed with the sword, Jack is on the verge of a final confrontation with Aku when Jack is literally ripped from his own time by the evil wizard and hurtled thousands of years into the future -- a future where Aku has already become the all-powerful evil lord who controls the world and all living beings.
Jack begins anew, working not only to right the wrongs Aku has visited on the population of this future world, but ultimately to return to his own time and stop Aku before the nightmarish future he has seen can even be realized.
Mature themes including the true meaning of courage, morality, responsibility, faith, despair, good and evil are explored as Jack struggles, and risks his life time and again to overcome what at first appears to be a force that is all-powerful and unstoppable. However, through Jack's insights and pure heart, viewers come to realize there is hope, not just for Jack, but for any society in which just one individual risks it all against tyranny and evil.",1077148800,57,2165,4.745358090185676

2002538,5,B0001HAI0E,"Disclaimer:  I did not grow up watching ""Samurai Jack.""  I had heard of it, but never seen it (though I had watched and loved the 2D-animated ""Clone Wars"" cartoon by the creators of ""Jack"").  And while I had heard people rave about Samurai Jack, calling it one of the greatest animated shows of all time, I didn't see much reason to watch it for myself.  But a trusted friend recommended it to me, and finally we decided to watch it together, archive-binging our way through all four seasons over the course of a week.

To put it simply... I was blown away.  ""Samurai Jack"" is quite deserving of the mountains of praise it receives, with the only flaw being that the series was tragically cancelled before any kind of finale or resolution could be given.

""Samurai Jack"" opens with an evil shapeshifting being named Aku (voiced by the late Mako) being freed from his prison by a solar eclipse, and proceeding to wreak havoc upon feudal Japan.  After his father is abducted by Aku, a young boy is sent away from home to be trained by masters all around the world, coming back as a deadly samurai and wielding a mystic sword that is the only thing capable of destroying Aku.  Aku is not so easily defeated, however, and before the samurai can strike the fatal blow the shapeshifter flings him thousands of years into the future... a future where Aku's evil has been allowed to spread unchecked until he has the entire world enslaved to his whims.  The samurai, at first shocked and frightened by the futuristic world of robots, aliens, and other bizarre characters he's found himself in, takes upon himself the moniker ""Jack"" and sets out on a quest to find his way back to his own time, that he might destroy Aku for good.  Along the way, he meets a strange and colorful cast of characters, some helpful, some malicious, and most of them quite memorable.

The animation in ""Samurai Jack"" is stunning, stylized and colorful and blending the ancient with the futuristic quite well.  The art forgoes black outlines, presenting everything in lineless shapes and angles, and it gives the show its own distinct look.  It presents lush (if often bleak) environments, clever creature and character design, and the occasional experimentation with its own style and homage to older cartoons (some characters look like they'd fit into an old Hannah-Barbarra cartoon).  The show will often eschew dialogue for great lengths of time, and rely on the imagery, action, and music to tell the story.  In a day and age when it feels like cartoons treat their target audience like morons and fill episodes with wall-to-wall dialogue, this is a welcome change.

There are only two main characters in this show, Jack and Aku (a few side characters, like the Scotsman, do show up in more than one episode, though this is rare).  But both characters are memorable and fun to watch.  Jack is a typical stoic warrior, but he gets his moments of deadpan snarkery, and his expressive reactions to the often strange circumstances he finds himself in or the bizarre locals he encounters say much more than dialogue ever could.  Aku is pure unrepentant evil, but somehow he manages to cross the line to be hilarious, and his voice actor hams it up at every opportunity.

The storylines, while most follow the same line of ""Jack tries to get home,"" ""Jack is being hunted by someone,"" or ""Jack helps someone being hurt by Aku's reign,"" are always entertaining, and often pay homage to other classic films or shows.  The world of ""Samurai Jack"" is a strange but fascinating mix of mythology, science fiction, fantasy, and ancient civilizations, and somehow this mishmash of elements WORKS.  If nothing else, it ensures that one is never bored when watching an episode.

Tragically, the series was cancelled after four seasons without any kind of resolution, and the death of Aku's voice actor makes it unlikely that the show will ever see an animated conclusion (though a comic series appears to be trying to continue the story).  But I greatly enjoyed the ride while it lasted.  ""Samurai Jack"" is an animated masterpiece, and deserving of its many accolades.",1426636800,,4125,4.782792665726375

2002545,5,B0001HAI0E,"One of the best Cartoon Network shows ever. As well as one of the best cartoon shows period! As someone who grew up with this show, every time it was on I'd watch it. I love this show and was sad when it was cancelled. It was an awesome show, mixing action, adventure, and humor as well as having certain shout outs to other Cartoon Network shows and paying homage to other things. Aku the villain I have to say, is hands down (besides Jack) my favorite character in this show. Voiced by the late but talented Mako, he's hilarious like a James Bond villain, playing games with his enemy and not taking things too seriously. He's how a real villain should be. Very happy that the last disc of this season has Aku's Fairy Tales. That's one of my favorite episode. Just hilarious silly, and fun. An evil powerful deity reading familiar bedtime stories to children in the hopes that his demonization of their hero Jack would get them to hate him? It's hilarious! And the angry Scotsman? Love that character too!

The episodes are well-written, funny, and very interesting. Genndy Tartakovsky clearly has his own unique style. From the creator of Dexter's Lab, comes an original tale of samurai action and honor with a dash of humor on the side. A must-have for those looking for a series full of action, adventure, and clever comedy. GET THIS DVD!

2002565,5,B0001HAI0E,"I had watched other shows on Cartoon Network, but this is a cut above just about everything on there. There is something for almost everyone and yet, this is one show that has never lost its focus and neither has its main character. The style of the art is a bit bizarre and stylized but so was both Dexter's Lab and Powerpuff Girls. in fact that style was carried over into Samurai Jack when one could see the Archeologist Dogs digging up the remains of Townsville. For the sake of the younger set, oil has replaced blood in those fight sequences, but it doesn't render them any less brutal. From the beginning we see that Jack, as he is ultimately called is not a man to mess with, but that he is honorable, humble and polite. He is willing to help others and thus manages to acquire some very unusual allies. While he is not superhuman he is capable of some astonishing feats. Like any man, he can laugh, become angry, lose patience and even tire, but he is learning to come to grips with that. In season one, he is learning the ropes to where he has been thrown and is still fairly young and innocent as he meets with strange creatures and battles strange monsters--with the ever present shadow of his greatest Nemesis Aku watching his every move only to intervene when it becomes clear Jack is about to reach his goal.....",1403568000,,1327,4.442622950819672

I acquire this season and now I have watched complete. In my opinion, this is the new version of ""Kung fu"", the popular series of the seventies, but many times improved, including impossible characters in a western as that in which David Carradine starred, but with the same situations and moral approach, with a fresh scope.",1400544000,,500,4.882352941176471

It looks like the seller just repackaged a used copy, as the box also has some scratches on the inside which aren't visible from the outside.

So when Phil Lamarr was in town I couldn't resist buying my own copy to get him to sign it. Get this volume. All of those fond memories you had of Jack when you were a kid will come flooding back. And who knows, you may make some new ones like me. :)",1370476800,,364,3.8666666666666667
2002589,5,B0001HAI0E,"I tried this series entirely by accident.  Long ago in a distant store, I, Patrick unleashed an unspeakably good bargain when I bought an X-Men tape for 10 cents thinking I was going to get a 5 minute interview with some of the creators.  But, a foolish person put the wrong tape in & instead it was a recording labeled Samurai Jack 2.  It had 14 episodes from seasons 2 & 3 (I will mark them in my next 2 SJ reviews), & needless to say I was incredibly impressed.  It's like, the best Hanna-Barbara cartoon ever (I know it was actually made after Hanna-Barbera was assimilated by Warner Brothers, but it feels like something they would do).  The artwork was fantastic, & the variety of the stories amazed me.  Eventually, my whole family came to like it especially my aunt.  Best 10 cents I ever spent.

Here's the episodes, with synopsizes from the box.

1-3.  The Premiere Movie:  The story of how it all began.  When the evil Aku is reborn to set forth on his reign of terror, a young samurai attempts to slay him with a mighty sword, but Aku banishes him to the future, where he adopts the name Jack.  This is a very good pilot.  A

4.  Jack, the Woolies, and the Chritchellites:  Jack helps free the Woolies from the tyrannical Chritchellites.  The first regular episode of the series isn't fantastic, but it's still good.  B+

5.  Jack in Space: Jack & a group of scientists join forces to try to escape the wrath of Aku.  Again, good but not great.  B

6.  Jack and the Warrior Woman:  A mysterious female warrior joins Jack in his quest, but is she really an ally?  It starts out good, but the twist at the end really destroys this episode for me.  C-

7.  Jack and the Three Blind Archers:  Jack must get past 3 mysterious archers to reach an all-powerful wishing well.  There's a reason that the only commentary is for this episode, it's fantastic.  Not my #1 favorite of the season, but still really good.  A+

8.  Jack vs. Mad Jack:  Jack must do battle with his darker self, Mad Jack.  The first episode my mother saw, & to be honest she had the best introduction to the series.  If I had to choose 1 episode apart from the pilot to introduce this show to someone, this episode would be at the top of the list.  Oh, & look out for the cameo of Huntor from one of my favorite Dial M For Monkey segments on Dexter's Laboratory (those & the Justice Friends segments were always my favorite part of the show, & while only a few of Dexter's episodes still entertain me, the ones about or featuring the superhero characters are still great).  A+

9.  Jack Under the Sea:  Jack has an underwater adventure while hunting for an ancient time portal.  This is just a great episode.  A

10. Jack and the Lava Monster:  Jack survives a cave full of challenges only to find an old warrior longing to reach Valhalla.  My father's first episode, & while it's really good (he said he'd want to see the whole series after seeing this one) it's not what I'd recommend for a first-time viewer.  A+

11.  Jack and the Scotsman:  When Jack & a Scotsman meet on a never-ending bridge, they end up shackled together & on the run from bounty hunters.  The first appearance of the Scotsman, who is one of the most awesome characters in the whole show.  While this is probably the best one with him in it, all his subsequent appearances are really good.  A+

12.  Jack and the Gangsters:  Jack hooks up with some Chicago gangsters to try to get close to Aku.  This episode is great for the most part, but when they get to Aku a contrived moment all but ruins it.  B

13.  Aku's Fairy Tales:  Aku tells 3 fairy tales, with a decidedly skewed point of view.  Not the best episode, but it was funny.  B

A good season overall, but my favorites were 2 & 4.  This is still an absolute must buy, as are all of them.",1368144000,,3797,4.320970042796006

I don't know what happened. At one point they had grade a shows like Ed edd and eddy, DBz, dragon ball, yu yu haka show, courage the cowardly dog, code name kids next door and this show. A good story and a fun watch. Hurry and get caught up because sooner or later they are going to make a movie for this show to bring this show to a acceptable conclusion. The last episode on season 4 is kind of a cliff hanger.

2002592,5,B0001HAI0E,"When this show first came out I was 11 and ever since then it has had a permanent place in my heart. The reason why this show is so great is because it has the spirit of a classic japanese martial arts movie ( like the lack of dialogue and more emphasis on action) while also being funny and child-friendly. It's too bad the show never got a proper conclusion, but it doesn't really matter because the show is just that good.",1364428800,,425,4.195121951219512

Jack and the Lava Monster, Jack Versus Mad Jack. Those were really outstanding episodes, all of these are really good, but those were just WOW to me. I seriously recommend checking out this series.

The show itself is very good.  The story is full of action, comedy, and adventure.  Jack is a very amazing character.  He is essence of a hero in every form.

If you want a show that's good for anyone this is the show.  It teaches good moral values and just to be a good person over all.  The violence in it should not keep you parents from letting your kids see it.  It really is a show for everyone.

Just let me say again if nothing else watch this for the artwork.  You won't be disappointed.

But unlike other shows where the first season is very amatuerish, this one picks up lightning fast and every episode is excellent.  The one with the scotsman is good for a hoot, the one with the archers good for drama and a ""Conan"" tribute.

The power of understatement is evident. This is material that trusts the audience to figure things out for themselves. It is flettering in this time when so many feel they must hit everyone over the head with a 2 x 4 of a message.

  Yet this is still light and amusing. There isn't a sense that one must decode anything; just enjoy and emerse oneself in the grand epic of universal feelings, fears, hopes and struggles.",1162512000,,566,4.529411764705882

All the cliches are here, people! The meditative silence, the samurai's squeaking blade and the falling leaves that yawningly fall to the hero's feet. Genndy, leave it to Quentin!

The superficiality of the Japanese theme is the paradigm of how westerners see the Japanese Culture in particular, and Oriental religion in general. Make no mistake this is an adult product disguised as a kid's show. This is Gauguin's atoll girls all over again! The stressed out-workaholic-middle-class children will have a journey to the ether here!

It's amazing how history repeats itself, and the ***** 5 stars given by almost everyone(?) is the living proof that a vast majority of us are tired from reality, from our jobs, from ourselves, and 10 minutes of a shallow pseudo-anime cartoon show gives just what the doctor ordered.

I could go on about how Jack is identical with Miller's character but I think I made my point.

Grow up people! If you want to see mesmerizing anime and travel trough your lost childhood buy ""Spirited Away""or better yet, the amazing ""Porco Rosso""!
If you don't have much money to buy a real animation masterpiece get a used copy (on Amazon.com ,of course) of ""Animatrix"" to see a taste of what real anime looks like.

Its original, fresh, great action, funny at times, and true to the art form of storytelling with good writing.

Watching the cartoons is entertaining on all levels and for everyone in the family.  I would like a second copy to pass around to friends.",1140825600,,457,5.135135135135135

Episode Seven, when Samurai Jack has to get past three archers to reach a wishing well IS perfect in every way, shape and form.  Episode Eleven, where we learn more insults from a Scotsman than we would ever hear from a sailor is downright one of the funniest episodes up to that point.  The creator, Genndy Tartakovshy, in season one is just starting to feel out what works and what does not.  Lots of extras, get it used or new.  And I strongly suggest getting the next season to see the series develop and REALLY find itself.  By the way I love the voice actors for both Jack and Aku.

Unlike other cartoons, Samurai Jack is anything but predictable.  Jack's journey into the distant future from his native ancient Japan is heart-wrenching, hilarious and thrilling.  Mako (who played the wizard in Conan the Barbarian) is wonderfully outrageous as the voice of Aku -- the ""Shogun of Sorrow"" who is Jack's nemesis.

2002642,4,B0001HAI0E,"Although I rarely see the actual show on TV, this DVD is my very best bet for me and those who also miss the show as well.  This DVD has the first 13 episodes as well as some of the original art and animation of the series.  It even has a featurette with Mr. Tartakofsky himself !  Impressive.

Now here are my top five favorite episodes from the first season:

5. ""Jack and the Blind Archers"" - Jack approaches a wishing well guarded by a trio of blind archers.  Jack defeats them by cutting of his own sense of sight.

4. ""Aku's Fairy Tales"" - An episode where Jack doesn't ACTUALLY appear, Aku tells the kids some fractured fairy tales where he's the hero and Jack's the villian.

3. ""Jack vs. Mad Jack"" - The Samurai meets his match: himself !

2. ""Jack and the Gangsters"" - Jack teams up with a bunch of Chicago-style gangsters in order to get a guarded jewel.  He even almost defeated Aku !

1. ""Jack and the Warrior Woman"" - Jack has met a new ally: a warrior woman named Ikra.  Together they travel the desert in order to find a mystical time portal to send Jack back home.  Little did Jack know, that the warrior woman was Aku in disguse !

Honarable Mention: ""Jack and the Woolies"" - Jack stumbles across an ancient city of people called the Critchellites and their creatures called the Woolies.  However, the city belonged to the Woolies before the Chrichellites enslaved them.  Jack must find a way to free the furry captives and get their city back.

And that's about it.  It is a very good series.  Probably one of Cartoon Network's best works.",1121126400,3,1558,4.384615384615385
2002643,4,B0001HAI0E,"Due to a lack of cable, I only began watching Samurai Jack in the middle of the second season. The first episode I watched, Jack and the Imakandi, got me very interested; the second episode I saw, Jack versus Demongo, hooked me as a lifelong fan. Samurai Jack is a beautifully animated series about a courageous young warrior fighting to undo his mortal enemy's evils.

Season One introduces Jack, a Japanese prince whose kingdom is attacked and destroyed by the shapeshifter Aku. He travels all over the world learning different styles of fighting, and when he is grown, he returns to Japan to take on Aku with a mystical sword forged by his ancestors. The battle comes down to the wire when Aku, in desperation, flings his enemy far into the future, into a world where everyone and everything is controlled by Aku. Dubbed by the locals 'Jack' (we never learn his real name) the young samurai must fight robots and bounty hunters as he journeys for a way to return to the past, while righting injustices along his path.

Samurai Jack combines elements of anime and Western action films in a simply but gorgeously animated feast for the eyes and the mind. While at least seventy percent of every episode involves some kind of action, the quieter moments are treated with just as much reverence as the fight scenes. Jack is a simple and inherently peaceful man who fights only when he has to, a thoroughly likable character because of his strict code of honor and ethics. His quietness and simplicity of words give him far more strength and charisma than any brash, tough-talking anti-hero of a number of Western and Japanese animated series.

Season One has the show still finding its feet; a number of the episodes are not up to par with those of the later seasons, although Jack and the Blind Archers, Jack and the Norse Warrior and Jack and the Scotsman are gems. Samurai Jack surprises with humor sprinkled throughout the action and delights with many colorful characters to balance Jack's tranquility. Best of all, perhaps, it teaches without preaching or pandering. Viewers of any age could learn a lot from Jack's courage and willingness to help others.

I've borrowed the DVD from a friend and have greatly enjoyed rewatching episodes I haven't seen in years, although Season One isn't my favorite. However, I'm saving for and eagerly anticipating the release of the fantastic Season Two.",1108252800,3,2396,4.822384428223844

SJ is simply outstanding.

I am about to buy this box-set despite the fact that it contains all the episodes from the Premier Movie which I already own.

He speaks only when needed, fights only when he has to, and lets his calm demeanor do the rest. While he can hold his own in any fight, he is always compassionate towards those deserving - even when it means forgoing his own plans.

This is a very good show for both kids and adults alike. The show has some great action but is presented in a kid-friendly format (all of the characters Jack cuts up are conviently robots). Jack is also shown as an excellent role model - fair, patient, true to his word, a hard worker, etc. For adults, there is a strange appeal to the mature crowd - the animation is a bit more stylized and the show favors more subtle facial expressions in place of dialogue at times. Also, those that have seen some Kurosawa will notice a few similiarities as well.

My only complaint is that they have not released the rest of the show yet. So for now, this first set will have to suffice.",1106438400,,1020,4.225641025641026

2002648,5,B0001HAI0E,"Samurai Jack is, for lack of a better word, marvelous. Each episode, carefully crafted with a unique visual style, is a quiet gem of animation. Although sometimes violent, Jack has an odd beauty to it. Most episodes feature very little dialog (less and less as the seasons progress), with background noises like rain, wind, fire, and water taking the foreground. The action is often stylized, like kabuki or like a 1950's Western. This makes it sound dull.

It isn't.

It's exiciting. Kids love it for all the reasons they love other violent cartoons. But adults can be mesmerized by the way that episodes play with conventions (film noir detective movie or swashbuckling adventure) while also entertaining. Strangely, the show I most compare SJ to is early 70's Lassie, which also featured strongly visual stories with little or no dialog.

This DVD set has two discs. They *DO* include (let's settle the debate) the ""Premiere Movie"" as three separate episodes (I actually think the talking dogs work better in the smaller dose), as well as a number of very good episodes.

This ""Season 1"" box set is not an actual first season, as it is missing 6 episodes from the first run, and includes the premier movie as the first thee episodes.  In this way, the box set is a disappointment.  Fans of ""Samurai Jack,"" such as myself, probably already own the DVD of the premier movie, and are feeling slightly cheated.

However, the other episodes included in the set are as top-notch as the entire series.  My favorite episode, ""Jack and the Scotsman,"" is included, combing my two hobbies of Japan and Scotland.

This show is largely Tartofsky's big gamble.  He left his other show, Dexter's Lab in favor of starting a radically new and different show - which is Samurai Jack.  The instant Genny left the helm of Dexter's Lab that show just wasn't the same anymore.

I think only one or two at the most I didn't care for but I still enjoy them all.  The animation is absolutely wonderful.

The character of Jack is an immensely charismatic hero.  His courage, resourcefulness and ethical code serves as a breath of fresh air in today's sea of common, immoral TV characters.  This samurai actually inspires me to better myself in the real world.  Not many shows have that effect and even fewer cartoons do!
The only special features in this set I liked was getting to see what some of the voice actors looked like.

Here is a cartoon that uses frequently very limited animation, long periods of silence, cultural references that range from Akira Kurasawa to Lone Wolf & Cub to Jerry Lewis' Nutty Professor, and yet maintains the interest of both children and adults.
I've seen episodes where there are stretches of ten minutes or more without a single word of dialogue and precious little traditional cartoon action. And yet it is nearly impossible to take your eyes off it. This may be the first TV cartoon show to actually lengthen attention spans!

Be that as it may,while Miller may cater to bigger peoples, Samurai Jack caters to all peoples!!! Despite all this, the artwork is visually appealing and is far more original that most other American toons! Some stories work better than others but even the least successful ones are better than 95% of the other stuff out there (exception: Invader Zim). The real appeal is the fact that intelligence doesn't take a backseat to any cheesy kiddie stuff. Admittedly, many 4-6 year olds may not really grasp it but they still will find it visually interesting. Adults will find much to enjoy due to the artwork and main character. Those familiar with Samurai flix and Spaghetti westerns will find tons-o-much too like! Although, I do like the series, I do have a couple of complaints with the collection. First off, I wish they would have released newer extras. The ones in the set are practically the same as those in the ""Samurai Jack The Movie."" Second, The first four episodes are also found on the movie, thus, negating the purchase of the movie! I really wish that companies would use their brain matter and release material without totally negating previous purchases!!! Wishful thinking? True!!!

2002660,5,B0001HAI0E,"This show is absolutely beautiful. It possesses a cinematic aspect that few other animated shows (other than anime) have.
To be clear, this is not anime. It is a highly syltized fusion of modern cartooning and traditional Japanese art. The show has a visual strength that allows for long, captivating sequences without dialogue.
When there is dialogue, the voice acting is excellent, as you would expect with the talented Phil LaMarr and Mako behind the mics, playing Jack and Aku, respectively.
As this was the first season, a couple of the episodes miss the mark ever so slightly, but the sheer brilliance of the best episodes easily overshadows the minor flaws that some of the weaker episodes possess. I would have rated this 4.5 stars, if possible, but in the final analysis, it is much closer to 5 stars than it is to 4.

Jack is a warrior who has been trained from childhood to destroy the demon Aku and restore peace to his kingdom. But before Jack can kill Aku, he is sucked into a time portal and thrown far into the future. Now Jack must learn the ways of this changed world, battle Aku's minions, and quest towards returning home. Utilizing stylized art and animation, Samurai Jack combines relentless action with traditional storytelling techniques to become one of the smartest cartoons currently on the air. There's a lot of classic moments in this set, and it's definitely worth a look for animation fans of all ages.
However, the set isn't perfect. Extras are pretty sparse, with one short documentary, a video gallery of production artwork, a commentary track, and the original ""test pilot"" animation. I understand space is limited, but it's still disappointing considering that creator Genndy Tartakovsky seems to have a lot to say. I think either the French or Spanish audio track could've been dropped, or at least made specific to different regions. Including 3 audio tracks on a series where dialogue is often sparse seems like overkill. There are also some minor problems with the video - it looks beautiful up until characters start to talk, then video interlacing problems become visible. It's a minor problem and shouldn't interfere too much with your enjoyment of Samurai Jack, but it's there.

Two shows that stand out are the ""three blind archers"" where the animators creativity really shines.  As Jack blindfolds himself, you witness his senses gradually determine his surrounding environment as if he was able to see (daredevil).  Or the ""robot ninja"" he fights in a tall building, jack becomes all white, while he nemesis is all black.  Animated action in this show just sets the standard for american animation.

2002665,5,B0001HAI0E,"Normally I wouldn't review a DVD set before its distribution.  However, I don't see any way that season one of Samurai Jack could earn any less than five stars, unless it was simply not what it is purported to be.  For several years, I've waited for Samurai Jack to appear on DVD, gritting my teeth every time I spotted Saved By The Bell DVD sets on sale at my local maximart.  Now, my dream is about to come true.
Another review posted here describes Samurai Jack as having ""saved television animation"".  Not so.  American televised animation has been maturing and flourishing right under our eyes for the last fifteen years, since The Simpsons blazed the trail.  American animation is utterly unlike Japanese anime, with a far greater emphasis on comedy and social commentary.  Shows like South Park, the Adult Swim half-shows (Space Ghost, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Harvey Birdman, Sealab 2021, etc.), Dr. Katz and Home Movies (another personal favorite) are doing just fine.
Nevertheless, Samurai Jack is something special.  It is not in the tradition of current American animation; while light-hearted and sometimes comedic, Samurai Jack is never topical and is certainly not dialog driven.  It is heavily influenced by Japanese animation in terms of both subject matter (samurais, swordplay and science-fiction) and style (action-driven, with many borrowed visual ideas).  And yet, it is a thing apart from traditional anime as well.  The style of art is uniquely simplistic and elegant, potraying a maximum of information with abstracted silhouettes.  The tone hearkens backs to a more traditional Japanese culture, of silence and elegance, and from the antecedents of Japanese cinema as found in American Westerns.
Yeah, enough about the influences.  The important thing to know is that a decade or two down the road, Samurai Jack will be rightly regarded as a masterpiece.  Not of animation per se, but simply as a work of art.  The rendering of the hero's quest, a fanicifully stylized future, innocence and adversity, and mostly its ability to be so visually expressive with a minimum of detail and dialog, these are transcendent qualities.
All of this is said in reference to the TV series, so I have to qualify my statements just a little bit.  If the DVD set has some major deficiencies or special features, I will be sure to amend this review appropriately.  Nevertheless, this is a hard one to screw up.",1082678400,15,2417,5.0025
2002666,5,B0001HAI0E,"""Samurai Jack"" is an animated series that is in a catagory of its own.  In some ways it seems to have stylistically taken ideas from the UPA era as well as from the old Hanna Barbara limited animation (Yogi Bear, the Flinstones, ect.) Although inspired by these ""Samurai Jack"" holds a quality that surpases the old style.  Where the Flinstones and Yogi Bear were driven primarily through dialog ""Jack"" is comfortable with just sound and movement to sprinkle the canvas with story. The old dialog driven toons were an attempt to save money and they were wonderfull for their time, but this series is spectacualr for our time. As an animation student I have found that each scene and shot has been carefully thought through and established. ""Samurai Jack"" will live on(although the series has finished)in this DVD collection.  Hopefully the other seasons will soon follow suit. This is coming from a fan of Genndy since he worked on ""Two Stupid Dogs"".  The First Season of ""Samurai Jack"" is a must have in any DVD collection, and after you watch it through you will need to watch it all again with the directors Commentary. PS. I hope they air the fianl three episodes of the series soon, I want to know how the story ends.",1081468800,5,1221,4.665116279069768
