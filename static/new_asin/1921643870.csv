202641,1,1921643870,"pointing out flaws in evolution, however accurate they might be, is still not evidence for a god or a creator. Intelligent design is still not even considered a scientific theory.

202642,5,1921643870,"Finally, a well produced, scientifically accurate and complete listing of about a dozen things that devastate Neo-Darwinism. This video should be required as a counterbalance to the evolutionary indoctrination in every school. My only complaint is not with the video but that there are so few web sites that have any type of comprehensive, in depth examination of these issues.

202643,5,1921643870,This is wonderfully done with excellent examples showing the machinery working in the cells of life. For anyone to see this and think that life could have possibly came into existence without a creator is to be a blind anti-Creator religious believer.  Many areas of well reasoned explanations of the impossibility of the general theory of evolution by excellent qualified scientists in their respective fields. Those who are truly searching for evidence of creator God or have some doubts and need to be encouraged must see this DVD.

202645,5,1921643870,"Excellent presentation.  Already have the book and ordered the DVD when it came out.

Rather than choosing to confront areas that might be regarded as soft targets, ""Evolution's Achilles Heels"" represents a well-argued frontal assault on what many would see as invincible strongholds for today's evolution-grounded, anti-theistic establishment thinkers.

Not sure how anyone could or would want to believe in the man made fairy tail of evolution after watching this video.

Are there any arguments left for evolution? There is really only one: I don't want to believe in a Creator-God, I don't want to be accountable to anyone for how I live, and evolution is the only alternative, so I am going to believe in evolution regardless of what the evidence shows and proves.'",1417564800,93,770,5.136

The problem is that it plays into the hands of the anti science mood overtaking the political right and they are incapable of seeing how they are being played. By creating false narratives about the reliability of science, they prey on the very weaknesses they create. Climate change being an example of one. The right has spread the false narrative that climate change is not real so voters do nothing to curb it.

202686,2,1921643870,"I understand that if one is a Christian evolutionists, then that automatically makes them old earth proponents, but there's a lot of old earthers that don't believe in evolution. I personally have mostly seen OE Christians say that they believe evolution, if true, doesn't challenge the existence of a Creator, because it simply answers ""how"" and not what or who. I agree with that. The first 3rd of this documentary is effective in dissecting the THEORY of evolution, but from there it falsely ties old earth belief to the theory of evolution, implying that both beliefs go hand-in-hand, when they don't. From there, the rest of the 2/3 of this documentary focuses on attack the old earth viewpoint. If it would of remained focused on the what the title of this documentary represented, it would of probably been a stellar documentary.",1481068800,,836,4.9361702127659575
202687,5,1921643870,"This DVD is an outstanding dissertation on the real problems of Evolution and utilizes experts in various scientific fields to describe, in marvellously strong detail, why this theory lacks scientific credibility. It shows why evolution is so damaging not only to the credible institution of science (observe, theorize, hypothesize, test, repeat) but also to mankind overall by asking the question of the moral dilemma. It challenges presumed facts for which Darwinism never proved and could never answer. Whether you are a creationist or evolutionist, the information contained here offers the means to begin critical thinking about how you might learn, ask intelligent questions and distinguish fact from fiction. It covers all the key areas where evolution has attempted to support its theories and socially over-throw the creation account. Faith as defined in the Bible is ""The substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."" Evolution is a faith all its own, a religion itself in fact, and very much contrary to the quality of the faith that the scriptures define. This DVD is an excellent academic investment for those wanting to think for themselves, demand answers to reasonable questions and reject an idea just because it may be popular.",1480723200,2,1264,5.262376237623762

Reading the book and watching the DVD left me wondering why Evolutionists have remained so strangely silent; apparently employing a strategy of pretending to ignore scientific evidence for which they are unable to muster any reasonable defense. This book provides strong testimony that In spite of Evolutionist's howling protests to any contradiction of their doctrine, libeling all dissenters as ignorant fools, a close inspection utilizing the tools of modern scientific inquiry reveals the unproven idea of ""random shuffling"" of atoms accidentally forming all life on Earth to be an incredulous absurdity that never has been, nor ever can be proven scientific fact. It occurs to me that any acknowledgment of even the slightest chink in the armor of the Neo-Darwinist claim of Spontaneous Evolution, would open for them the Pandora's Box of begging the larger question of having to justify and explain Academia's 150 years of ""blind faith in unprovable 'junk' science.""

Logical people trust the countless engineers and scientists that build their 100 story buildings and make 100 ton aircraft fly or make 100,000 ton ships float or create the wizardry of electronics we use in our daily lives. We put our total faith and our lives in the hands of these scientists and engineers every day. We trust and have total faith in these scientists, biologists, Doctors, and numerous PhDs who develop our medicines and lifesaving procedures that we all depend on, but suddenly we distrust and debate with a different set of countless anthropologists, geologists, geneticists, and biologists, who are experts in their
field as well? These experts have come to a consensus that evolution is real. A consensus that was battled over for a 100 years. Of course there are fine points amongst the experts which are still being debated. That's the nature of science, but the theory is not being questioned. This DVD is attacking minor points in a huge volume of evidence. This DVD is not rigorous. It's not scientific. There are
100,000s of scientists, experts in their field that say evolution is real science. Of course you can find 15 PhDs that disagree with evolution. I'm sure you can find 15 PhD scientists or engineers who will say planes shouldnt fly.  As a Christian, I didn't expect God to explain creation to primitive, Iron Age people by mentioning DNA or cell mutation. We do a great disservice to our younger generation to question science or the scientific method. 50% of Americans now are raising their children to think that scientists and engineers are ""conspiring"" to discredit the Bible at a time when schools are struggling to teach proper math and science in our schools?? This is not good for the future of America.",1468886400,6,2043,4.887608069164265

202735,1,1921643870,"This crap is the most biased science I've ever known. It is only rivaled by panselectionism, genetic determinism, molecular reduction of biological systems, and over emphasis on information that is too anthropomorphic. This is the easy way out to understand any kind of phenomena. Intelligent design and neodarwinism are both not the the answers were looking for. It is only part of the story. These philosophies are unilateral ideologies that are full of empty teleologies. They hinder science, their the blinding lights that prevent us from seeing what's behind it. We can't automatically think its always intentional , in these cases intelligent. Evolutionary biology is only beginning to unravel how it really works. Its more than selection, competition, mutation, drift, and randomness. New computational tools and theoretical modeling is on the horizon... Oh yeah, don't let them get you suckered in, when there is more to evolution than meets the laypersons eye like symbiogenesis, niche construction or selection construction, developmental evolution by tumor/neoplasm neofucntionalization, genetic assimilation of plastic responses, the Baldwin effect, and these processes may be mutually inclusive in evospace. There are no definite general laws of biology except evolutionary change, diversity, selective self-organization, and some boundary constraints relating to chemistry and physics. Genetic entropy can be precluded by differrential and synergistic epistasis as genetic syntropy, also the mechanisms that prohibit gene duplication can be repressed  and duplications can favor increased robustness especially as evident in shadow enhancers, as cis-regulatory sequences can facilitate neofunctionalization. The loss of genetic information can allow new genetic information to integrate into the genome, and bad mutations cawn become adaptive. Creationism is all deistic, Cosmoquantum supraconsciousness or pantheism/panspychism would be a better way of looking at nature as self perpetual. Water memory can solve many of these problems in evolution as well.
Also organisms themselves not just us, can participate in their own evolution, through modifying existing or creating new selection pressures, giving the appearance in a way, of deistic design. Organisms are imperfect, evolution can only create better adaptation's. I'm not an atheist, but all creationism is essentially and inescapably deism and therefore idolatry, that is rooted in organism. What is random to us, is only degree's of freedom, that is the prerequisite to freewill, which can have a role in evolution, as plasticity, compensatory evolution, phenotypic/genetic accommodation and so on. Organisms co-create their own conditions of evolution, and most evolution is neutral or redundant in nature, especially genetically. New information can be added, through any number mechanisms as long as intragenomic conflict is low or reduced by mutation. For every yin in nature, there's a yang. So we can't look at things as being separate, especially god and nature, as the flower of self-creation is trying to tell us. These creationists and neodarwinists are both narrow minded and dogmatic. They are trapped and imprisoned by their limited perspectives. Quantum biology will be another tool in evolutionary theory.",1467676800,2,3297,5.797938144329897

My answers came this way; God did not show me how he did the 6 day creation but how immense the mind that created this and how my puny created mind could not fathom this mind. God gets lots of blame for things in the world but it is used primarily for an excuse not to search Him out. People tell me they don't want religion and I share ""good neither does God.

Mutation, Adaptation, and Species Diversification is all in-line with Intelligent Design for many reasons, but especially for the fact that no kind of animal has EVER been observed to deviate from its own genus (or ""kind"").
Inflationary theory related to time is an ""Evolution god of the gaps"" assertion tactic which, in fact, hasn't been observed nor can it be. A few hundred million yrs is a long time to wait around in order to find out you were wrong about it the whole time, is it not?
You'll be dead by then. So it is irrelevant to your existence. Truth is explicitly found in the Red Lettered parts of the 'ol Black Book. I challenge you to read them before you dismiss them. After all, testing it by observation is the fundamental basis for scientific exploration, is it not??!!

The authors combine Geology, Geophysics, Astronomy, etc and tag 'evolution' on top of them - But they have nothing to do with Biological Evolution. I don't know anything about biology, as it's not in my field, but I feel compelled to write a review about Geology/Geophysics. Snelling, Austin, et al misused K/Ar dating on Volcanic Samples that were sent to a laboratory (Henke,2010) - You can clearly see this in the graphs on the CMI page. You cannot use K/Ar on samples less than a certain age. What Austin, Snelling (and others) don't realize is that the misuse of K/Ar actually hurts their case since the mistakes still show the samples are still older than their '6k-to-10k' dogmatic Age of the Earth. Another thing to consider is that they never put their data up in Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta or American Mineralogist for review by the world's experts, to make matters worse for the authors of this DVD: CMI/AIG (and the others) never accept /any/ criticism for anything they have published.

A large amount of the other PhD's involved in this video speak out of their field - For example, Tasman Walker has a PhD in mechanical engineering - Not any Earth Sciences. Jonathan Sarfati once had a debate via a Amazon book review with Dr. Levin in which Jonathan Sarfati criticized Dr. Levin for talking about radiometric dating (Levin is a microbiologist) when Sarfati's book talked about biology and other non chemistry related field. Just like that review, He does the same thing talking about the Origin of Life.

202781,3,1921643870,"""Information, communication and language are necessary for life, those things only come from an intelligent source."" While the documentary does not convince either way - because a mind should always be left open until something is proven or disproved - that one phrase has left a lasting impression on me. To believe in the theory of evolution as it exists now, you MUST believe that if you placed all of the elements necessary to create an iPhone into a soup and then just wait long enough, those elements would spontaneously create the necessary language, information and communication systems needed to self-design a working, fully functional iPhone without any external intelligent design involved. Let alone that later on, more and more iPhones would be created and then a larger network of communication would be created so that those iPhones could talk to each other, and maybe add some servers and other such thing until you have a living, breathing system, or organism like the internet. (Hope you all followed that analogy because in a sense, cells are tiny little computers, processing information, different languages and talking to each other and carrying out functions and all the things that computers do - even moreso for they use raw materials to actually create their own parts and chemicals, enzymes, protiens, etc.). That thought just gnaws at my logic. I'd call it a bigger leap of faith or magic than just simply believing in some form of intelligent design involved. I mean, can anyone say for certain that we know for sure aliens do not exist? Then how can we be so sure that Gods or ""God"" does not exist? It would just be another entity in this fantastical universe. Oh and, by the way, I do not wish to be insulted by either side. Neither evolution nor creationism is a fact, and after watching this movie I have to say that I am now middle of the road. Which makes me open minded, and any would-be insulter an extremist. I feel comfortable where I am. Thanks for your time.

Edit: The incredulous Noah's Ark problem? Simple; suspended animation. Science fiction and science buffs alike shouldn't have a problem with that. It takes far less room and resources to store specimens than it does to feed and house carnivores. And this from just a human mind.

I am happy to see that this video includes the animated workings of DNA that Dr. Stephen Meyer shared in a talk with us at a Calvary Chapel a couple of years ago. Take the time to watch the bonus footage extended interviews where most of these doctors give their own personal story of how they came to believe in the creation model instead of the evolution model of science...you won't be disappointed. (After writing this review I went back and read the one star ratings, so I have to add one final comment, I wish people would address specific objections to the evidence presented in this video instead of giving it a one star rating and writing a bad review from their own personal biases. To me faith is defined as believing in something that we do not fully understand but we are willing to hold onto because it has been proven to be the best Metanarrative , evolutionist have greater faith than myself because there are bigger gaps and unknowns in their belief than in my belief. The scientific evidence that we do have, and this video shows, is pointing toward a creator and not pointing away). Last week I drew a picture of a tree stump with a dozen tree rings, if you counted the tree rings will you be able to tell me when I drew the picture? Think about this and then realize that when God created the universe, He made it fully functional from the beginning. He made adult humans and not babies because He designed them to function on their own right after he created them.
Some things could never happen because they are impossible by chance. In other words, the laws of physics prevents certain things from ever happening by chance. For instance, ocean waves on a clear beach would never produce a paragraph of neatly written text in the sand. Its not that writing would be improbable, but rather, it is actually impossible by chance. Waves just don't produce neatly written text written in the sand because they follow the laws of gravity and physics. Sometimes evolutionists get the concept of possibility and probability confused.

This point can be pursued empirically - and the modern synthesis in this area is soundly contradicted by hard evidence.)

I think the general evolutionary narrative is based upon presuppositions that are held by faith.  Modern versions of the narrative are are more likely derived from a prior commitment to philosophical materialism than ones derived from a purely objective assessment of evidence.  I would assert that evolutionary theory is a materialistic interpretation of scientific evidences, versus a conclusion that is dictated by them. I think the only thing one can honestly deduce from the empirical studies is that, special creation aside, we don't know how life got here.  All we really know is that it exists and can adapt and that those adaptations appear to be conservative, i.e., they  insure a creature is able to survive within bounded limits according to its kind.

I was raised a Christian, but never gave it much thought. Assumed the Bible was correct, but never really spent any mental energy on it. As a kid, I quit attending church and was just a Christian by label, not by practice. As I went through High School, College, and my personal studies, I grew into quite the fan of science and was convinced by the arguments for evolution and against Biblical creation. I mean, they're teaching this stuff in all schools - it must be factual. Recently, I realized I've never truly considered my views of this life and this world, and started my quest for answers. I watched this video entirely open minded, but leaning towards beliefs against Biblical creation.

As someone who assumed evolution was proven fact, it was eye opening to see modern arguments and proofs showing that evolution isn't as rock-solid as my science teachers told me. The video makes a strong arguments against evolution and has revealed to me that belief in evolution is a matter of faith! In fact, I would go as far as to say that belief in evolution is absolutely nothing except faith.

The video presents arguments against evolution and for creation from a multiple disciplines and topics such as biology, origins of life, radiometric dating, cosmology, natural selection, and more. It shows that natural selection is incapable of being an engine for evolution as we are taught in school. That survival of the fittest is incapable of explaining arrival of the fittest. That life is in a state of degradation from what appears to have been more perfect origins. These scientific arguments leave you questioning how evolution has come to be known as fact.

A number of other topic are discussed. Such as flaws in dating methods placing the age of the planet and life at billions and millions of years old. It discussed how slow tectonic activity cannot account for smoothly-bent mountains and cool tectonic plates submerged in lava. It discussed how the big bang would defy the laws of physics, and is based on assumptions that cannot be known to be true. A number of other topics are covered!

Finally, the video finishes with a segment on the ethical implications of humanity being the product of a random, unguided process of evolution. It explains that if we are merely the product of chance, we serve no purpose. Life is ultimately meaningless, morality is unexplainable, and free will is a mythical construct of the human mind. If you and I are merely a chemical reaction, what is our purpose? This segment spoke directly to my mind, heart and soul - as it is something I have deeply pondered.

It would have been better to just say there is evidence of a global flood all over the earth, but at this time a complete understanding of how it happened cannot be known.  John Baumgardner, the lead author of CPT, admits that he needs several miracles to occur in order for his idea to explain the flood.  Why throw a multiple miracle theory in a DVD that otherwise presents scientific facts?",1428364800,18,793,4.844444444444444
202851,5,1921643870,"I am not a creationist but this film readily illuminates many new things to investigate, question, explore and think about in relation to the fundamentals of the theory of Evolution. Many of the ""facts"" about evolution, that I have routinely taken for granted, without personal investigation, without ever really ""looking"", in detail, for myself, frankly made me laugh out loud, at my own naivete. The film smartly dismantles many long held ""truths"" about the basic premises of evolution and I admire and actually appreciate the value in doing so, unfortunately, after the logical fracturing of numerous ""evolutionist pillars"" that have supported my conclusions for decades, I felt that a liberal amount of undue license was then quickly deployed to retrofit the newly damaged structure with creationist suppositions that required leaps I could not functionally support.

It was rather ironic that the same flaws in my original reasoning, some that were articulately exposed in the first 80% of the film were then called on once again to support the conclusions made in the last 20% of the film.

The above said, this documentary is a competent piece of work and well worth watching. The majority of contemporary ""Documentaries"" that ""document"" controversial topics, shamelessly pander to your emotions, abandoning reason without a hint of an invitation to enhance your intellectual prosperity. This film however, did not insult me and even though, for me, the final conclusions lacked full analytical integrity, I still walked away with a sense of cerebral vigor and several definitive questions worth pondering.

In the end, whether you find concord or not with the film's perspective regarding a very challenging topic, I am confident that, like me, you will not find that your investment of time and interest has been squandered.

We know more about evolution than we do gravity, and other scientific ""theory's"". It's a done deal, no debate.

If you feel you can discredit a valid physical science that's been studied, re-examined, tested, repeated, and verified for 150 years running, in a video, you are gravely mistaken. Is it of no coincidence that these so-called scientists (fringe) who don't accept evolution just happen to be religious? They are obviously blinded by their creation convictions.

Sadly, there are many who will not accept the truth, no matter how well it is presented. If you accept creationism, then you have to accept the God of creation. The world we live in today is determined to discredit the Bible and every belief in God, and to modify the Christian faith to conform to its secular standards.

This is a quote from one of the ""scientist"" on the side of evolution:

""We take the side of science in spite of the patent absurdity of some of its constructs...because we have a prior commitment, a commitment to materialism.

As a former ""old-ager"" and biology major, I can attest to many of the teachings they claim evolutionists are espousing in universities and schools these days...even panspermia!

202887,1,1921643870,"I put this in the 1-star category so if you're reading all the very angry comments by the 1-star people (who claim to only deal in fact), perhaps you'll note the following:
- Almost every one appeals to ""science"" as if it is an infallible, monolithic belief system.  Is there no room for civil debate and disagreement?  Are all ""scientists"" in 100% agreement.  Of course not, otherwise there would be no exploration and debate in the scientific community.  Isn't that what scientists are supposed to do?  One reviewer even refers to this as an insult to Mother Nature.  According to evolutionists, there is no such thing....because if there is, then they agree there is an intelligent force behind the created order.
- Science has a long history of propagating wrong theories.  That alone doesn't mean evolution is wrong, but it also means that appealing to ""Science"" as a synonym for ""Truth"" is naive at best and dishonest at worst.
- The 1-star reviewers are not disagreeing with specific facts or intellectual arguments, but rather are resorting to broad generalizations and ""ad hominem"" attacks (i.e. they attack the people and their motivation, not their logical arguments).  This is the weakest form of intellectual debate.
- Most have a very angry tone.  The scientists in this movie are not angry--they are calmly presenting their case based on facts.  If most of the 1-star reviewers are Evolutionists, what do they care if some people are so ""deluded""?  Where is all this anger coming from?  If we are just physical matter and there is no life after we die, why get so angry with someone who sees the world differently than you do?  Can't they live their lives the way they choose and then be dead forever?  What do they care?  Actually, if they truly believe in evolution, they should see these men as weaklings who will not survive natural selection.
- Shouting down your opponents is always about suppressing real debate.  Wikipedia says ""Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about nature and the universe. This knowledge is determined through the scientific method by experiments and observations, and may take the form of scientific facts, scientific models, or scientific theories.""

202899,3,1921643870,"It does what it sets out to do with good production values and some nice CG: it lays out the basic tenets of Christian response to most scientific theories that would refute the Bible. A couple of problems. 1) All the experts are simply listed as having a PhD, without any info on their field. 2) Many of their experts comment on everything from genetics to geology to the big bang, and it's hard to accept they have expertise in all those fields
Trying to link all these theories together is a bad idea because while I thoroughly accept that science (especially Darwinian evolution) can't explain the original spark of life, I cannot, under any circumstances, accept the evidence that Noah fit samples of every single species of land-based animals on one wooden ark and managed to feed them all for almost four months, especially the carnivores who only ate other animals. The only way to get to that kind of acceptance is faith in miracles and a program that is specifically attempting a scientific refutation and that regularly derides evolution as needing leaps of faith loses credibility as a whole because a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. They also maintained a series of issues the Big Bang theory cannot explain, but in doing so made assumptions about time and distance that directly refuted their own arguments about the age of the planet and the Biblical description of Creation. Oops.
My biggest concern is its conclusion: unless you believe in creation of the Earth by the Christian God, you cannot have any kind of morality or purpose in life. I believe the opposite: if you require a vengeful father figure looking over your shoulder, telling you what to do, and punishing you for wrongdoing, then you have no internal moral compass. You only maintain your morality to avoid punishment, which means you have no internal morality at all.
Overall, it gave me an understanding of Christian scientific theory in one relatively elegant package, but reached far beyond its conceivable expertise and questioned one set of scientific ""facts"" with its own ""facts"" that were just as dubious if not more so.

The thing that really got to me was that they use Hitler Stallin and Mao to show how evil people are that don't believe like they do. They need to check their history books - more evil has been done in the name of religon than was ever done by those maniacs. If Pat Robertson had his way he'd make them look like beginers.

I enjoyed that, while obviously favoring one side of a debate it did not completely trivialize the other.  I do not completely buy the ""6000 year old Universe"" theory but I do agree that dating methods that are seen as absolute are in truth absolutely unreliable.  There is growing evidence and theory that there was a ""Great Flood"" at some point in human history, if it was designed or the result of unintelligent events is something that I will not force on others.
My prof. in Chemistry 101 many years ago told us that there is something called ""Root Pressure"" involved in very large trees that somehow allows for water and nutrients to overcome specific gravity and physics and allows such trees to exist.  He said it can not yet be explained or directly observed in science but we know it must exist because the trees are alive, he also said ""mind you Joey, believing in a scientific principle that you can't explain or define isn't the same thing as faith, that is for stupid people that believe in God or anything else outside of their own ass*&^les.""  Thanks Mr. McCreedy, he also brought up an instance he came across while doing research for a large chemical company on a proposition that would greatly reduce malnutrition in developing countries, only real problem is that all those poor malnourished children would have a hard time paying for the small packets of protein and vitamins you could drink with a Coke or Pepsi, besides they would just live longer and probably make more poor and hungry people.

Everyday and every year the proof for evolution seems to be fading and yet their is such a push right now in our culture to keep it alive.  In movies, in education, in government you can see a desperate need to validate the whole Darwinian mode of thinking.  If evolution is so factual and beyond reproach why do individuals who support this thinking respond with such hateful and violent animosity towards those who choose to think differently and can back up their ideas with factual proof.  I just finished watching the movie Lucy, if I didn't know any better, I would think it wasn't just a Hollywood movie but an evolution propaganda film.

It has presuppositions that are not subject to critical discussion (ex. Life came from nothing and less complex evolves to more complex, which can't be proven)  Then interprets the facts in terms of those presuppositions. Then uses these interpreted facts to prove the presuppositions.
Evolution, coming across as 'indisputable' fact when its premise is based on a faith based proposition that life came from nothing is probably the biggest hindrance to scientific development today.

This movie presents very strong arguments against evolution. Some arguments that have been known for a while but some that have originated within the past generation of scientific research.  The answer to many of these arguments from the evolutionist community are what is termed in the movie as ""Darwin of the Gaps"" (as opposed to God of the Gaps).  So what each person is left with are two radically different worldviews that each take a certain level of faith to accept.

202927,5,1921643870,"This film has only bolstered my belief that our first parents, along with other myriads of life forms, didn't evolve and were, in fact, intelligently designed and put together. Design demands a designer, and a law, whether physical or not, demands a lawgiver. I'd like to add another take here. Allow me to be simplistic, and let's say we did evolve. My simple question is which of our organs came into being first? The most logical assumption would be our brain, and what a brain that must have been! So let's grant that it was the ""processing"" brain. Now, which organ ""evolved"" next? The eyes (not just one!) or the nose (with two nostrils!), etc.? Let's just say it was our pair of eyes. Well, for our purpose here, let's just say one eye. My question to those who regard creation as a myth is this: how could an eye be formed without an eye to begin with? That ""brain,"" whatever glob-like construction it originally was, must have some kind of input for it to get cooking and form an eye it might  ""think"" it needed. Without an eye to receive light, with all the colors, how could it even start to produce an eye? And we're talking two eyes here, on the same plane and equidistant from the nose. The first man or woman was made as a complete packagebrain, eyes, nose, and allby a Supreme Being or Beings so prodigious in intellect and depth that I can't even begin to fathom them.

If a fellow human (with a brain) wants to remain unseeing to what's before his eyes, I just hope he wakes up soon. We live in the most dangerous age our race has ever known, mostly brought on by our increasing immoralitya consequence of not believing there's right and there's wrong. We kill unborn lives by the millions each year, and somehow I'm not as appalled anymore when I hear of  a cold-blooded teenager walk inside a classroom and start shooting.  I, too, have become a by-product of our ""evolved"" society.

I had tears in my eyes towards the end of watching this. Thanks to the producers, commentators, and the others for ""creating"" an enlightening piece every human would do well to watch.",1421884800,8,2086,4.522546419098143
202928,5,1921643870,"Phenomenal!  As for the negative reviews, where are the ""answers"" to this documentary which presents fatal flaws in Darwinian Evolution?  It's not just this documentary, but time and time again science is uncovering serious flaws that would definitely be pointed out in a courtroom if there were a trial.  Some negative reviews criticize the video to pointing at a Supernatural Being as the creator and originator of life.  Yes, it does point that way. These reviewers must be ignorant of the evolutionary theory of ""directed panspermia"", an evolutionary theory invoking aliens from outer space to explain the origin of life.  It takes faith to believe aliens from outer space explain the origin of life on earth but they call that scientific?  I wouldn't use that aliens in a modern day courtroom in America to explain the presence of your DNA at the crime scene.  That ""scientific"" theory would deserve scoffing from the judge/jury and earn you an acquittal.  This video scientifically analyzes many fields in science like geology, biology, and chemistry to name a few.  I love the treatment on the massive explosion of life instantly appearing in the Cambrian Explosion.  I like the way this video shows the football field representative of millions of years of passing time without evidence of life... From the endzone to the 20 yard line, no life.  Then passed the 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 yard line, and no life.  In the space of 4 inches of time at the 88 yard line (the endzone being present day), poof!  All sorts of well developed and distinctly different phylum appear with no evidence of prior transitional states.  That's not things evolving over millions of years, that is an instantaneous appearance of fully developed and highly advanced lifeforms.  Knowing that Precambrian fossilized sponges could be preserved prior to the Cambrian explosion, hard bodied crustaceans and other creatures could and should have been preserved if they existed.  The video covers Schweitzer's discovery of elastic soft tissue and red blood cells which had not decomposed in an alleged 68 million year old T-Rex.  She is not a creationist!  And now she has found the same in other fossils.  I'll let you decide if it is ""reasonable"" to believe soft tissue, red blood cells, elements of hemoglobin, and blood vessels should be present in a 68 million year old fossil.  The section on biology and genetics in this video will show how immensely complex the process is for DNA, RNA, and enzymes to work together to build amino acids into proteins, and equally how unrealistic (in my humble opinion) to believe life could have evolved without all three (DNA, RNA, and enzymes) simultaneously being present and working together at the same time.  Great video.  I highly recommend.  The negative reviewers need to give ""specifics"", not just make a blanket that it is a shame the video points to a Supernatural Being as the creator and originator of life.  When an evolutionist promotes directed transpermia, somehow that view is acceptable as scientific theory?  If you want some more mind-blowing evidence that evolutionists cannot explain, watch the Amazon videos ""Darwin's Dilemma"", ""The Privileged Planet"", ""Unlocking the Mystery of Life"", ""Metamorphosis: The Design and Beauty of Butterflies [HD]"", and ""Flight: The Genius of Birds [HD]"".",1421625600,6,3327,5.082872928176796

Creationists seem to think that if they disprove evolution then their god wins by default. It doesn't work that way, you can throw out the entire theory of evolution and that still doesn't prove god did it. What is more of a threat to their creation story is not evolution, its basic math. If what they are claiming is true, the Earth is only 6000 years old and the entire human population was reduced to 8 during the great flood, then if you calculate standard birth rates, by the time the great pyramids were constructed there would have been a grand total of 300 people on Earth.",1421625600,19,855,4.452229299363057
