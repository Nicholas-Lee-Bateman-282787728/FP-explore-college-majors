Again, as in the other old films, this one is clear, easy to watch, and I enjoyed it. In this film Mr. Moto is a spy in Cambodia. He disguises himself as an archeologists and sends messages by carrier pigeons. At times he also disguises himself as a Cambodian priest. He finds explosives and guns, which he was sent to find. He must face both the tribal leader and the high priest, each having a different agenda, each being against Moto. A woman parachutes into the camp. She is also a spy, but not from the same agency as Moto. Cambodia appears in the film with the same kind of animals seen in Tarzan films.",1511740800,4,721,4.194244604316546

8166777,3,B000M6F8U4,"Mr. Moto Takes a Chance,"" made in 1938, stars Peter Lorre as Japanese detective Mr. Moto working undercover as an archaeologist studying Cambodian ruins. His real mission: locating munitions dealers who are stockpiling weapons in Southeast Asia. Other characters are aviatrix Victoria Mason (Rochelle Hudson), newsreel photographer Marty Weston (Robert Kent), and Westons assistant, Chick Davis (Chick Chandler). The news team runs afoul of high priest Bokor (George Regas), who displays little trust for white people, and area monarch Raja Ali (J. Edward Bromberg), who has trouble separating the good guys from the bad.

Lorre gets to put on various disguises, exercise a bit of martial arts and comes off as more colorful than many B-flick characters of the era, though Charlie Chan still takes the prize as best Hollywood B-movie detective. Lorre conveys both intelligence and humor as he investigates what might be a sinister plot that can affect the entire world.

Picture quality on the DVD release varies. Stock footage and footage shot at the studio don't match, and sharpness isn't consistent. Interiors look best, with atmospheric lighting enhancing the black-and-white photography.

Mr. Moto, created by American author John P. Marquand, appeared in six novels between 1935 and 1957. Lorre portrayed the detective in eight motion pictures between 1937 and 1939. (This was a period when Caucasian actors routinely portrayed Asians.) In the earlier Moto films, espionage played a significant role in the plot. The later films were mysteries in the mold of Foxs Charlie Chan series.",1461542400,,1591,5.381526104417671

8166780,3,B000M6F8U4,"Mr. Moto Takes A Chance, 1938 film

Mr. Moto is again undercover, this time in Cambodia to investigate a plot for revolution. Cambodia was then part of French Indo-China. Two photographers were taken to a temple hidden in the jungle, but escaped due to an old traveler. [Recognize him?] They are asked to take pictures of that temple for Mr. Moto. Is his interest strictly archaeology? The photographers see skeletons in that well. A poison dart strikes the sun helmet of one photographer. An old man offers advice, and plans to eliminate Mr. Moto. This guru enters a hidden basement. Another man tries to attack him but fails! [A stunt double?] There are cans of gunpowder stored there. Can a carrier pigeon deliver a message? Not if it is shot down. There are dancing girls for entertainment. One man performs magic tricks. Will something go wrong? Maybe.

Will the ruler take a new wife for his harem? A meal of squab is given to Mr. Moto. There is a plan to eliminate Mr. Moto, but it fails. Bokor enters Moto's room, only to leave when Vicky enters. She looks at that map, then escapes with it. But she is captured and questioned by that guru. Is that a signal fire? A boat lands with men and supplies. The Captain gets his pay-off. Vicky blurts out a name! There is action when Bokor gets away and blames the Captain's death on the others. There is shooting. The extra ammunition is the wrong size. The ruler shows up with his troops to eliminate the survivors. But the good guys escape with Mr. Moto's help.

Most people knew little of Cambodia before the 1950s. There is a lost city in the jungles there. The nationality of Mr. Moto created a problem in December 1941. It would've been better to make him a Hawaiian, like Charlie Chan.",1375747200,,1743,4.562300319488818

Instead of the Oriental flavor that adds spice and mystery to the first two films,  ""Mr Moto Takes a Chance"" has our favorite Japanese detective thrust into the Jungle Adventure genre popular at the time.  The intrigue here involves a native tribal chief who is bartering for weapons so that he can ""drive every foreigner from Asia!""  Of course, this being the time of New Imperialism and ""French Indochina"", he is the villain of the piece rather than a sympathetic character who sees his land and culture being stolen, but one must do one's best to always set aside modern politics when watching the classics.  At least you have to try.

Peter Lorre gets to show off his acting chops instead of his Judo chops here a bit more, as they play up Mr. Moto's ""master of disguise"" aspect more than his fighting ability.  Of course, with that voice and eyes it is hard to disguise him under any amount of make-up, but he still does a good job.  Quite a lot of the flick has Lorre as a disguised character, and we don't see much of Moto until the slam-bang finish where he brings the house down. Literally.  All of the tropes are here, including the silly Rajah who wants to marry the beautiful blonde girl,  and the dashing hero who sails off into the sunset.  These are all the elements that make up&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indiana-Jones-and-the-Temple-of-Doom/dp/B0014Z4ON4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a>, and it is here in the Jungle Adventure genre that they first appeared.

It becomes pretty clear that Mr. Moto is a character served best by wandering the smokey back-alleys of Shanghai than traipsing around in a pith helmet in the jungle.  It just doesn't make much sense to have him there,  and he wanton destruction of ancient architecture for no good reason didn't ring true, given the respect that Mr. Moto has shown to antiquities in his previous outings. Because of Lorre's abilities, it is still a film worth watching, but I hope that the next Mr. Moto film I see returns him to his proper setting.",1223856000,,2822,5.766265060240964
