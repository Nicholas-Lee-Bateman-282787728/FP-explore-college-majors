5861142,1,B00DW7AL7U,"Ya this movie is horrible. So much unneeded straight up almost porn scenes that go on way longer than they should, boring characters that really weren't entertaining to watch, almost the whole movie was filmed in what seemed to be a Motel 6 or something, etc. I really really wanted to like this and at some points in the movie it was great but not nearly enough to hold this stinker together. I'm all for micro budget horror films and such and I'm not a snob to it but this movie sucked. I already bought a couple of Dustin Mills movies like Skinless, Zombie A- Hole and The Monster Puppet Massacre and I pray they are not as bad as this one. I'm gonna stay positive for those but for this movie don't bother at all or go for it, but I warned you.",1420329600,2,748,4.201388888888889

5861145,4,B00DW7AL7U,"Easter Casket was far and by the best movie about the holiday ever seen my mine own two eyes.  Though the task of special effects was a tall order based on the script, the campy nature of the film was anything but half assed.  The mega pope alone makes this film worth a watch and being an Ohio indie film fellow myself, knew eye must see this piece.  All in all worth a watch and congratulations to the filmmakers putting together a piece that brought puppets and people together in a way that put Alf to shame.",1390003200,,512,4.257731958762887
5861146,5,B00DW7AL7U,"Dustin Mills out does himself with great handmade visual effects, some well placed CGI, and a few of his puppets! but we can't forget the witty dialog, loads of blood guts and as always plenty of glorious full frontal nudity! oh and one more thing the story is like ""nun"" other!",1374364800,3,278,4.470588235294118
5861147,5,B00DW7AL7U,"Ok, so this may not be the special effects big-budget blockbuster of the year, but  what it lacks in that regard, it quickly makes up for in pure fun and entertainment!  If you have yet to experience a film by Dustin Mills, you don't know just how much you are missing out on!  Mr. Mills takes a great cast who give 110% throughout the entire movie and lets them show what they can do.  Considering the budget Mr. Mills works with, he provides some very entertaining effects and does not hold back for a single second.  This is a movie for horror fans who like their horror full of blood, guts, nudity, and cheesy one-liners.  One thing is for sure, after watching this movie, you will never look at priests, Easter eggs, or the Easter bunny in the same way ever again!",1374364800,7,769,4.380281690140845
5861148,5,B00DW7AL7U,"If you love puppets, b-movies, and tromaville style humor you will love Easter Casket and every other film released by Dustin Mills.",1374364800,3,132,5.045454545454546
5861149,5,B00DW7AL7U,Dustin Mills is a visionary film maker and we can only hope that in a world of remakes and regurgitated concepts that someday his vivid imagination will be brought to the big screen. Dustin truly enjoys making films and it's reflected in all his work. You'll have a blast with Easter Casket; guaranteed.,1374278400,,303,4.735849056603773

8598633,4,B00DW7AL7U,"I enjoyed this but beware a lot of nudity & some would say sacreligious. May offend some but if you read what its about you should be well aware of what your about to view. This was a very intertaining movie , but I like strange independent horror.",1454371200,,248,4.1875
8598634,3,B00DW7AL7U,I was excited when I first purchased this film on dvd. Until I realized the only scenes I truly enjoyed was  the ones that had the Easter Bunny in them. Besides that there was very little entertainment in my book.,1443830400,,213,4.325
8598635,5,B00DW7AL7U,"Easter Casket is the perfect movie to watch on Easter Sunday. It has all the ingredients for a holiday classic. Bunnies, eggs, baby chicks, and shaved nuns. You got to see this one.",1428192000,,181,4.515151515151516
8598636,4,B00DW7AL7U,"I will have to say, this was pretty good. It's low budget, but well made. Kinda reminds me of ThanksKilling, except with a killer rabbit. It will definitely offend others, lots of nasty jokes in there. I thought it was hilarious though and worth checking out. The rabbit is a hoot, and has some funny lines. Definitely one of the better Easter horror movies I've seen. Good fun! Nice puppet work too. Didn't look like crap, like some movies I've seen.",1427068800,,451,4.580246913580247
8598637,5,B00DW7AL7U,"Long live the  Easter Bunny! I am still laughing! I did not know what to expect?
But I am  100% Easter Eggs pleased with it! Maybe not for every one? But I Luved It!
Nuns, Schoolgirls, T&A, plus even blood & gore!
Looking forward too Part 2.
Once again, I just luved It!",1425427200,,270,4.0754716981132075
8598638,2,B00DW7AL7U,"This movie is what I like to call a ""ketchup packet"", it sums up the special effects. The actor's are your whitetrash 2nd cousins. The only reason it got 2 stars from me was my adolescent weakness for the BUN-BUN!! I loved his crazy mentally disturbed look & laughter....",1424131200,,271,4.551020408163265
