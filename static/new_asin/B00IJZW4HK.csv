6267031,3,B00IJZW4HK,I have seen better presentations of the D-Day story. This one drags and the narrator is boring. The main problem is that it has all been said and seen before.,1408147200,,158,4.3

6267039,4,B00IJZW4HK,"This two disc set is indeed a true value for the price.  The first disc is way too long about the life and times of Churchill, but the second disc is well worth the entire cost of the video.  Very well done and keeps one's interest alive.",1427760000,2,238,4.042553191489362

6267043,3,B00IJZW4HK,"Mostly good stuff, except the Victory at  Sea episode which has the original award winning music and narrator replaced with new loud music and low volume narration . If I turn up the volume to hear the narrator, the music is deafening.

The bonus movie Hell in Normandy seems to be a very bad fictional movie, worthy of the name.",1417132800,3,329,4.466666666666667
6267044,4,B00IJZW4HK,"A collection of a lot of film that was shot at the time. I'm old enough that I remember seeing most of it in the early 50's. My, dad , who was camped out at the air field at Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941 and fought island to island in the Central Pacific always complained that the guys in the European theater had it easy. I don't think that's true.",1413417600,7,350,4.014285714285714

8642760,3,B00IJZW4HK,"As one might expect from any collection of videos from different sources and time periods, this collection is very uneven.  A couple of the shows are very good, especially ""D-Day: June 6, 1944"" and ""Secrets of War: D-Day Deceptions.""  Balanced against these are two absolutely awful shows, ""The Finest Hours of the Second World War: D-Day"" and ""WWII Diaries: June 1944.""  ""The Finest Hours"" contains many blatant falsehoods and inaccuracies:

(1) ""34,000 Marines came ashore at Normandy.""  Huh?  That would have been a great surprise to Admiral Ernest King and General George Marshall, neither of whom wanted the Marine Corps anywhere near Normandy.  Between the Americans, British and Canadians, the Normandy invasion was completely army.  The US 1st and 29th divisions came ashore at Omaha Beach, and the US 4th division came ashore at Utah Beach.  All three were Army divisions, as were the 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions which landed behind those two beaches prior to the landings.

(2) A map that features prominently had Sword beach on the far eastern end of the five beaches, when in fact, Sword was between Gold and Juno beaches.  And the narrator tells us that the 82nd and 101st divisions jumped at Sword beach.  Nope - that was the British 6th Airborne division.

(3) The narrator is obviously reading his script without rehearsal and consistently mispronounces every French city, town or geographical feature he comes to.  Caen (pronouced 'Cawn') comes out of the narrator's mouth as 'Cayenne.'  No, that's a pepper, not a town in Normandy.

The same narrator does ""WWII Diaries"" and seems to have learned a little bit about French pronunciation, but it's almost as dreadful as ""The Finest Hours.""  It's probably not a coincidence that these two dreadful videos, and their narrator, come from the same production company.

All in all, there is something good on these two disks.  And for the price, you can skip the bad parts and not feel cheated.  But how any outfit with even a passing interest in historical accuracy could crank out two horrible videos such as these is beyond comprehension.  Given the prominence of D-Day in World War II, there are many, many accurate published accounts of D-Day and its various elements; too bad the producer of these two clunkers never opened any of those books.",1496966400,2,2317,4.981770833333333
