8375947,3,B002OD2GU8,"The films of the singer/comedian George Formby, the Lancashire lad who was a very big star in the UK in the thirties and forties, probably won't appeal to American audiences. Formby, possibly the male equivalent of Gracie Fields, played the working class hero, gauche and innocent, who had no pretensions above his station. Usually his films followed a formula whereby he overcame some challenge and won the heart of the girl. The attractions are that Formby was a first class technician in spite of his ""dumb"" demeanor, many of the films are nicely put together and when he picks up his ukele and sings, his charm is obvious.

""Keep your Seats Please"" is one of Formby's best. A beautifully constructed farce, Formby plays an unemployed entertainer who inherits the fortune of his wealthy aunt but with a catch because the inheritance is hidden in a dining chair. The plot follows how Formby stays one step ahead of crooked lawyer, Alistair Sim, in order to obtain his fortune. There are 2 comedy highlights - an doctor's examination and a goat disguised as a dog on a bus. Formby is paired by his best leading lady, the delightful and perky Florence Desmond.

The print is in fairly good condition but the DVD contains no extras, which at the price, is OK.",1285286400,3,1258,4.739726027397261
