8683423,5,B00OG48OSQ,"This three hour film, beautifully directed and photographed, is an extraordinary visit to one of the greatest cultural institutions in the world. It includes shots and descriptions of 255 of the countless masterpieces in the collection, with interview with curators, conservators, art handlers and several other department heads.

Details abound. Art, money, mystery. Moving, wonderful storytelling. At times it seems like a house of mirrors with paintings and film melded together in an extraordinary melding of pleasures from both artistic mediums.

The Gallery itself becomes the major character in this fascinating film. I can't wait to visit the Gallery next January -- this film can only deepen and enhance the experience.

8683424,4,B00OG48OSQ,"I was expecting three hours of paintings; maybe there would be descriptions and opinions.

What we get is much more. It is really documentary of life in London's National Gallery. I can relate as we have a local (Kimbell Art Museum) and took part in similar activities.

Do not get me wrong there are plenty of pictures and discussions. They are just part of the overall experience.

You will come away feeling that you are part of the gallery staff and participated in decisions. It is the next best thing to being there. And the three hours presentation in its casual form will leave you wanting more.",1442620800,3,603,4.616822429906542
8683425,4,B00OG48OSQ,"The greatest paintings in the world are full of ambiguity and extremely resistant to singular meanings. The educated art public knows this and probably doesn't need much assistance from the staff of the National Gallery but Wiseman is perhaps less concerned with the art connoisseur than he is with the staff of the National Gallery, the general public, and the gap that exists between the two.  Wiseman has a career-long fascination with institutions and their role in modern life and this fascination served him well in his last documentary AT BERKELEY. Here. however, this fascination with the merits and perils of institutional life is rather tedious. Too many of the conversations and/or lectures and/or discussions and/or faculty meetings that Wiseman eavesdrops in on are just not that interesting and/or go on far too long (faculty meetings in real life are tedious enough so why should we want to sit through ones we are not required to attend).  In its rather tedious way this documentary does ask big questions like what is a museum's primary function, the preservation or marketing or interpretation of great works of art? Unfortunatley, the doc has little to offer in the way of answers (or even compelling debate).  Unless you are fascinated by the kinds of things that fascinate institutional experts.....ie proper restoration and display of famous works......I'd avoid this one.",1441584000,,1394,5.1866666666666665

This is a documentary that portrait the interworking of a gallery where they create different venues to educate others what humans did through paintings and creations few centuries ago when there was no electricity and sophisticated architectural lighting that could even enhance their art work. This is a documentary that shows what it takes for a gallery to insure that the voice of the audience is heard and the audiences from different ages can attend the gallery willingly to explore the knowledge of art by humanity. It is an extremely educational experience to see what it takes to run a successful gallery. A place that humans can be proud of other humans achievements without saying much except possibly listening to the speaker, talking to themselves, analyzing what they see in those art works and possibly what others may tend to see including the artist.

This documentary is a reminder to humanity that knowledge is power especially after the 83 year old caretaker, Khalid al-Asaad, the retired chief of antiquities for Palmyra was dragged to a public square by jihadists on Tuesday, August 18, 2015 after detaining him for weeks, where a masked swordsman cut off his head in front of a crowd. Humanity needs education and institutions like NATIONAL GALLERY to take us there. An institution that requires many caring humans to coordinate the art works, the paintings, to setting the right environment in bringing such knowledge to us, the visitor, the audience with curiosity for art, humanity, history and much more just like Khalid al-Asaad had had for Palmyra even if ours may not be in the same heightened level of enlightenment as Khalid al-Asaads. Thank you Mr. Frederick Wiseman for your superb documentary. A must see documentary and a must visit gallery, NATION GALLERY. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1440460800,5,1890,4.958990536277603
8683427,5,B00OG48OSQ,"National Gallery : A Film by Fred Wiseman is a documentary following a working day in the National Gallery, it is 3 hours long and has an unhurried pace, without voiceover or soundtrack. We spend time simply looking i) at the major art works( it's probably the greatest art gallery for works of art in the world) ; ii) at how the public observes ; iii) at meetings of the gallery staff behind the museum walls; iv) at the various curators, restorers, the docents, filmmakers, talking about the subject matter of the paintings or the previous patrons or techniques used ; v) at the relationship between painting and film, painting and poetry, painting and dance, painting and music, painting and science(use of X-ray techniques, methods of restoration etc.); iv)painting and craft ( there are behind-the-scenes looks at the carving out of frames or the mounting of pictures in exhibitions, the placing of paintings for maximum effect and the life-class groups painting from the nude).There is time given over to young people, children, blind people(who have a Braille version of a Pissaro to understand) and exhibitions: Leonardo, Turner and Titian primarily, with the queuing to get in to these once-in-a-lifetime events. The tension between drawing in patrons and maintaining curatorial integrity is shown in meetings of front office staff.

The artistry of the film maker comes in the selection from 170 hours of filming over 12 weeks, the editing, the chance encounters with more interesting people like the woman curator at the start of the film who is talking about the religious triptych, how still images can come to life, her ability to talk to people, her knowledge, her scholarly,non-pedantic charm. There were great talks by different people about Vermeer, about Caravaggio, Poussin, Leonardo, Turner, Rembrandt and Pissaro. I loved the chance to see a lot of the works on view in close-up on HD TV, it was even better in some ways than the contingency of going around the gallery yourself at busy times with all the crowds jostling to see each picture. The film is not silent: the many talks, classes and behind-the-scenes meetings show the lengths to which the gallery goes to engage actively with its public. Ultimately you gazed on the works of art almost in silence like a thirsty animal coming down to drink from a pool of water. For Wiseman the final film is a response to the shooting of the film. He is dealing with the passage of time, characterisation, metaphor and abstraction in film as you would do in novels and paintings. He has no preconceptions to fit the meanings to his own purpose, he edits sequences to be fair representations of his understanding of what went on. Unlike journalism, he is trying to construct a dramatic narrative. There is no sense of anybody performing a role, people ignore the camera: true transparency.",1430697600,8,2857,4.952083333333333
