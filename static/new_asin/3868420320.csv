The seven members of LICHTMOND created an almost entirely synthetic aims for total relaxation with this second concept Blu-ray disc and especially with great pride with the collaboration of a true artist like Alan Parsons, the former sound engineer of the legendary Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon. In fact, there are some fragments, especially when the guitar is used in giving us the tone is on par with the legendary Pink Floyd.  The effective duration of 52 minutes is equal to something like a universal concept album.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The blu phase media GmbH presentation of LICHTMOND 2: UNIVERSE OF LIGHT on this out of this world 3D Blu-ray disc, is that you get to view stunning awesome 1080p visual images that will give you a truly spectacular visual experience, and equally impressive is the stunning 1.78:1 aspect ratio and can be either viewed in Real 3D and optional 2D images, but for me the Real 3D wins every time. The Real 3D visual presentation consists of a virtual ""dream world"" with many brilliant abstract representations, where the colours shine brilliant and strong, and the contrast is totally perfect for this Blu-ray format and the sharpness is exceptional and in the Real 3D image it offers you such stunning 3D effects that are so life like and gives the audience a greater depth effect feel to the images. With this ""dream world"" many of the shots offers greater clarity with the objects in the background, and again the Real 3D effects are really stunning and is totally perfect for this 3D Blu-ray format presentation and that has spectacular outstanding properties and sometimes what emerge from your television screen, feels like it is coming towards you, making you feel it is totally life like.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The blu phase media GmbH LICHTMOND 2: UNIVERSE OF LIGHT is presented on this Blu-ray disc in an equally stunning and awesome German: 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Surround, German: 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, German: 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio and English: 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio. The soundtracks with the German recorded voice poems can only be heard in 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio. But if you want to hear the recorded voice poems in English, then you have to select the English: 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio soundtrack. For me the focus is with the 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround sound track and provides a very powerful surround sound effects that feels very real, the intensively in events involving from the first scene to all speakers. LICHTMOND 2: UNIVERSE OF LIGHT defines a crystal-clear and consistently amazing surround sound ambient effects, for example, migrate the guitars and voices from one speaker to another. The music is totally perfectly mixed, which includes the targeted use of the basses. But for a purely technical perspective, the tone is a total revelation!

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: You can select the Credit items from the main menu, which is however only reached directly via the last chapter.

BONUS: You have a brilliant designed six-page booklet with acknowledgments of the band and a few beautiful colour photos.

Finally, In terms of picture and sound quality, LICHTMOND 2: UNIVERSE OF LIGHT is definitely worthy reference image quality for this Real 3D Blu-ray disc, which is also excellently well suited as a presentation material for your Home Cinema Theatre systems, that will really impress your friends if they have never witnessed Real 3D and will show them what real 3D is really like and far superior to what you will witness at the cinema, as at time you feel you can touch objects in front of you and feel you can actual walk into the 3D images, they are that spectacular. If you have never witness a Real 3D LICHTMOND Blu-ray disc, then I whole heartedly recommend LICHTMOND 1 [3D Blu-ray] which is Volume 1 and definitely one to start you on your journey in finding out what Real 3D is all about and you will be amazed what beautiful 3D image delights awaits you. Unfortunately, if you read other reviews of LICHTMOND 2: UNIVERSE OF LIGHT on any Amazon web sites, because they say this is not a patch on the LICHTMOND 1 3D Blu-ray, well this is a complete load of old tosh, as LICHTMOND 2 is totally awesome and goes into a totally different direction to make it totally unique and a very special presentation. If you want to really impress your guests in showing off what Real 3D at its best, then go to Chapter 9 Precious Life, as this is a video compilation of what you view on LICHTMOND 2 Blu-ray disc, as it will take them to a Real 3D world they probably have never experienced before and will make viewing 2D a very pass&eacute; experience. On top of all that, if ever you are feeling the blues, put on any Real 3D Blu-ray disc, and all your worries will disappear and lift your spirits 100%, which I can category guarantee you! Very Highly Recommended!
