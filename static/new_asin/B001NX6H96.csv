3723516,4,B001NX6H96,"For those instructors out there that have been using Stone's book 'Stick Control,' but have been looking for material that might be more engaging for today's more techno-minded student ... this production just may be precisely what you're looking for.

No ... your beginning level students probably won't be able to quickly master the Blue Devil's 'Ditty' nor Vanguard's 'Double Beat' with it, but I suspect that with as little as a week's practice using Greb's video ... almost any fifth grade music student can play a recognizable rendition of USC Trojan's masterpiece 'Orgasm.'

Anyone looking for a gift idea for some aspiring drummer, regardless of what style of music he is studying, won't go wrong with this DVD.  Note: it presents an odd, yet technically correct, means of teaching rhythm; and it presents it in a way that anyone who can sing 'Happy Birthday' can grasp the concept.

I won't call it revolutionary, but it is definately an evolution in teaching the rudiments.  And as applied to the drumset, it provides a meaningful (and enjoyably unique) foundation to the practice of independence.

3723517,5,B001NX6H96,"Benny Greb is a genius. He applies all the variations of sixteenth note and triplet rhythms to all sorts of excercises through clapping, pad & sticks, and eventually to the drumset.

However, you really do need to know the basics pretty well. Reading music is not necessary, but would be very helpful.

WHO THIS DVD IS FOR:
Drummers who are stuck! You don't know how to make your drumming better and are stuck on an intermediate level. This DVD opens up an endless number of complex rhythms in a way that's easy to understand, but at times, hard to apply.

Beautiful, funny, smart, and very helpful.

And not only that, watching this DVD was a ""mind-expanding"" experience for me: it opens up a new way of looking at drumming methods, and offers a new set of rudiments, so to speak; also, being creative with drumset setup and configuration, and using ""found"" objects with or as percussion helpers or objects is displayed.

Don't miss the segment at the end of Disc 1 where Benny gets percussive on kitchen gadgets, and at the end of Disc 2 when ""Old Benny"" (his dad) appears in a ""cameo.""

The mountaintop jam with the bongo (correct terminology?) cat, and the duet with Johnny Rabb are also highlights - you'll be grinning from ear to ear and wondering aloud, ""Was zum Teufel ist hier los?!?!""",1240531200,3,962,4.748502994011976

3723530,5,B001NX6H96,"Wow what a DVD!

Of all my DVDs this one easily ranks as one of the best. Benny Greb is both an amazing musician and instructor. What I loved about his disk was it did not teach me anything that I did not all ready know but it taught me in such a way that the information was new! (if that makes sense)

The break downs of four note groupings in a visual format without staff lines was brilliant. When working with my students every one of them understands the concepts easily but the application of the concepts is simple to insanely difficult. The progressive nature of the exercises is extremely helpful and makes learning the concepts easy. The layout is also very motivating. Benny gives you 24 letters, so the average drummer is not overwhelmed by the information. Plus as you work through it you realize that with only 24 groupings that anyone can accomplish them, this is really inspiring. Before you know it you have the system down and that allows you to open up your playing and really move forward with more difficult concepts.

The remaining parts of the disk are wonderful. Benny is funny, approachable and challenging all at the same time. The second on why records sound better than CDs is worth the cost of the DVDs alone. Plus the advice for creativity is spot on. Finally the performances with his bands are great. I have teenagers who just think it is wonderful to see him play with a Tuba, Trombone and trumpet. This is a rarity in these days for teens to like that style of music!

The Production, sound and video are all top rate.

I believe Albert Einstein once said that genius is when someone can take a complex topic and make it understandable by everyone. If this is true, the The Language of Drumming is sheer genius.

Outstanding... simply Outstanding!!

Cheers,

3723531,5,B001NX6H96,"I have a lot to say, so be patient.

Benny Greb has created something unique in the way of teaching ""rudiments"".  In fact, his method is so unique some may even argue that he's not teaching ""rudiments"", but of course he is.  But he teaches them in a style that is clearly oriented toward language which the title of this product promises.  In fact, is it true that he doesn't teach ""rudiments"" in their standard form, but as he points out, all of the elements that he teaches can be used to build whatever ""rudiment"" you can dream up.  He just breaks it down into a more fundamental alphabet of beats based on the various ways that beats can be grouped.

Perhaps before I go further I should explain a little bit about myself.  I'm only just starting to learn to play a drum set, rather late in life.  I've already purchased quite a few of Tommy Igoe's videos on Groove Essentials and ""Great Hands for a lifetime"" which I highly recommend for raw beginners.  Tommy does indeed teach the standard rudiment forms in great detail.  I was looking for something that might take it to the next level, like showing how to apply the rudiments to grooves.  I can't really say that Benny Greb's video does that exactly, but he does give a completely different method of looking at timing and working with basic beats.

I would say that Greb's Language of Drummer is really tailored for drummers who have already learned the rudiments and basically want to sharpen their timing skills and add vocabulary to their basic rudiments.  Because like Greb points out, when you look at basic beats as an alphabet there is no rudiment you won't be able to play.  So it's more versatile in that sense.  He prepares you for more artistic creativity in the long haul.

He goes through the alphabet many times using many different styles and tempos.  If you actually follow along by the time you've gone through all these exercises you will definitely know your musical 'beat alphabet'.  He also teaches it leading with the right hand, then the left hand, and even on the bass drum and with the left foot on the hi-hat.  So if you master everything he actually teaches you will have gained a lot of limb independence to be sure.  And that's just on the first DVD disc.

On the second DVD he takes you further into the drum set creating entire words and phrases using odd and compound meters.  If you learn all that you'll be a pro as far as I'm concerned.

Finally, he speaks to musical artistry and goes into some detail about how to listen to music, and what to listen for specifically, and how to tune into various parts of a musical composition.  I really enjoyed that part because a large part of why I bought a drum set in the first place is to improve my rhythmic musicality so I found the latter part of the second DVD to be quite enlightening, and I'm looking forward to applying some of the techniques he teaches to my own musical compositions. Not just on the drums, but for all the instruments I play and write for.

There are some weird scenes on his video.  I don't think I'll be playing the drums using plastic bottles, or using an egg whisk as a drum stick.  He was getting a little too 'creative' for my tastes in places.  I understand his intention but I think those spots would have been better filled by just showing some examples of using things like woodblocks, sambago bells, cowbells, or other drum accessories.  In fact, I wish he had included woodblocks since I have a pair on my drum set.  I guess the fact that he played on a log in the first DVD will have to suffice as a 'woodblock'.

Summary in short:

If you're a raw beginner looking for detailed instructions I'd recommend Tommy Igoe's ""Groove Essentials"" and ""Great Hands for a Lifetime"".  But if you're already playing and you're looking to express more artistic creativity and refine your timing, then Greb's ""The Language of Drumming"" might just be the ticket.",1291852800,8,3924,4.520567375886525
3723532,5,B001NX6H96,I own more than 15 drum DVDs. This one blows them all out of the water!! Benny gives you a SYSTEM that WORKS. This system is really great for those who are just starting and for those who are already advanced in their craft! And when you can perform everything here with ease? Hmm... why aren't you famous yet? Hahaha!!,1289865600,,319,4.333333333333333
3723533,5,B001NX6H96,"As a percussion student that is always stretched too thin on time, I'm always in search of a systematic approach to cover all of my bases on drums: rhythm, time, dynamics, sticking exercises, rudiments, four-way coordination, etc. Finding an efficient system has been the bane of my existence for years.
Benny Greb's alphabet system is a very comprehensive approach. He codifies 24 ""letters"" which represent all the rhythmic possibilities in music. What it shows is that in a majority of all music (rock, classical, jazz, world music, etc.), a lot of the same rhythmic material is used. Hundreds of years, encompassing millions of pieces, mainly rely on these 24 rhythms. He even challenges you to take a piece of music from classical repertoire, and point out the ""letters"" in that piece.
Back to the system. Like learning language, he starts with a basic understanding of the letters, and the sound they make. You start without drums, or sticks; you just clap the letters, providing a good mental workout. Then, at the snare drum, you practice rhythmic accuracy, dynamics, rudiments, and sticking exercises. Then, you move to the drum set, and apply the letters to a different limb, giving you a four-way coordination workout.
Beyond that, he talks about soloing in a more musical way, thinking of making sentences, and other materials.
Before this, I had barely heard of Benny Greb. According to another reviewer, his playing credits aren't very vast. I say, So what? And there is indeed something very ""New Breed"" about this approach. However, the New Breed didn't address several aspects of this DVD, like snare technique, or soloing ideas.
This system, and this DVD in general, amalgamate several methods from the past, and present them in a very gradual, comprehensive approach, that applies to beginning students, all the way through professional players. Plus, there's a printable PDF booklet of like 60 pages! Bonus, there's three german guys in lederhosen singing and playing accordion at various spots. The german guys don't help the system at all, but I find it humorous.",1274572800,11,2084,5.078717201166181
3723534,5,B001NX6H96,"Benny's approach to music and drumming is revolutionary. He plays the drums unlike any person I've ever watched, and I've been at this for over 30 years! Exercises range from very simple to very complex. The performances are AMAZING! He makes his drum set sound like an entire drum circle. I would love to study with this guy in person.",1273795200,,336,4.616666666666666
3723535,2,B001NX6H96,"Who is Benny Greb? I ask this because I didn't know who Benny Greb was when I first saw this DVD with so many positive reviews. I bought the DVD on a lark, and I also did some research on Benny Greb.

On this DVD, Greb teaches a system he's devised that's already been expressed in other books/methods. That doesn't make his system bad, it's just nothing new. (Check out The New Breed, which is a truly BRILLIANT system by the late Gary Chester). Nonetheless, if you get something out of Greb's system then it's worthwhile. Personally, it doesn't add anything new to my own studies.

Basic research indicates that Greb has played with almost no one. Other than a project of his own, Greb has zero credits. Why would we drummers (who are musicians) take advice from a practice room drummer of no particular note? Even more to the point, why is Hudson Music giving a platform to a practice room drummer of no particular note? Considering the number of great drummer/musicians out there who have extensive experience and so much to offer, to give Greb his own DVD at this point in his musical life is somewhat strange. For instance, Greb plays a solo at the end of this DVD which shows his playing to be utterly pedestrian. All ""drumistic"" stuff. No interesting phrasing. No interesting melodic content. By a drummer, for a drummer. If those are the results of practicing his system, I'd say steer clear of it.

Two stars for Greb's system, which is useful for drummers to learn to internalize time. After that, this DVD doesn't have much to offer.

Listen to recordings of Tony Williams, Elvin Jones, Philly Joe, Max Roach, Roy Haynes, Jack DeJohnette, Bill Bruford, Peter Erskine, Joey Baron, Bobby Previte, Bill Stewart, Jeff Watts. Listen to their phrasing. Listen to the music they make. That's what will open doors for you.",1272326400,19,1826,4.696875
3723536,5,B001NX6H96,This is a drum-life changing DVD.  Getting inside Benny's head and seeing his approach to drumming has connected me with the big picture of drumming in a powerful way.  His way of breaking down the entirety of drumming into a 'simple' language is refreshing.  Realizing that it will still take forever to come close to mastering the language is now a little less frustrating as he essentially gives you open ended and infinitely reaching practice exercises that only require your dedication and a little bit of creativity. A true master of the art... listen to what Benny believes is important to drums.  Well made DVD with loads of valuable instruction and some good humor.,1270684800,,674,4.885964912280702

In This DVD (which is beautifully edited,produced, photographed (and again photographed )) you will learn new language, new concept, this DVD is definitely not for beginners, as they could get confused.

Benny,  first a great drummer, and a great person, explain every thing very clearly, you can actually feel that you are sitting with a teacher in beautiful scenic places , in a VERY good drum class. Not like many DVD that doesn't teach you anything.

the first DVD is one hour of full material that has to be learnt slowly and practiced.

The second DVD is more of tips and tricks and other stuff that usually, in most DVDs that I saw until today,  doesn't show anything interesting, even in this DVD Benny manage to show some nice tricks , that can really help.

Enter this DVD. Benny Greb has developed a very efficient system for learning that combines so many different areas of musicianship: theory, technique, coordination, and creativity, to name a few. All of this is developed through use of a very unique alphabetical system of rhythmic phrases.
He shows all the different ways to use this alphabet: sticking patterns (on snare), rudiments (on snare), and then playing a beat, with each limb playing the letters of the alphabet at different times! He then shows how to practice, making sure you hit every area in your practice session.
It's brilliant, needless to say. Anyone  can pick up this concept easily. The PDF documents that come with the DVD are very helpful as well.
Altogether, this price of $30, or $39.99, or whatever, is a small price to pay for an instructional DVD of this caliber.

This video is going to change my life for sure.  I've only had it for a week, and I am happily learning and playing the rudiments (not my most favorite part of my practices).  The ""rhythmic alphabet"" is a brilliant concept that is SO simple and easy to remember.  Assigning words to odd groupings is a ridiculously simple concept, but is REALLY helpful. The exercize he gives using your voice and clapping is awesome...  now I can practice drums while I'm in the check-out line, waiting at the doctor's office or stuck in traffic.  The concepts in the video literally give you unlimited amount of ideas to draw upon.

8328014,5,B001NX6H96,"I purchased the DVD and liked the concept but didn't really start using the system until I got Benny's follow-up book (I reviewed that as well).

Bottom line is that this is an extremely well thought out system and is presented very clearly.  One of the most useful things I found was the visual representation of the ""Rhythmic Alphabet"" and this DVD provides a reference poster that is extremely handy for us visual thinkers!!!. The Rhythmic Alphabet is a great mental model that helps you start playing right away rather than getting hung up on the notes if you're not a reader (i.e easier to hear what your playing rather than thinking about the notes).

The system is worth exploring, Benny presents multiple ways to use the system, which can easily be expanded upon - just fire-up your imagination (Benny certainly helps jumpstart it).  As the DVD progresses through the system there are several performance clips to show how the system is applied in the real world (great for the visual and audio learners).

I bought the DVD first, then the book, which really pushed me to use the system.  I don't feel I've wasted any money with both products as my learning style was helped by both products - the DVD let me see Benny do it, the book gave me form so that I could do it.
