The acting was horrid, the dialogue corny, the effects (i.e. excessive candy apple red blood) were laughable, the storyline (for lack of a better description) was confusing, - plus countless other flaws.

It is NOT a serious movie!  It is NOT a comedy, albeit laughable!  It is NOT a horror movie!  It is indescribably BAD!

Don't let the one cent price for a new copy suck you in.  With Amazon's recent 33% shipping increase from $2.99 to $3.99, that's a total of $4.00 - better spent on . . . well anything else!",1399680000,,629,4.362068965517241
8204899,5,B000SAGGPK,Phil Heiple as the pirate scared the bejesus out of me!  I was scared...tried to look away...but couldn't!  Bought it here on Amazon and will keep it in my personal collection!,1398470400,,176,4.645161290322581
8204900,4,B000SAGGPK,"This was a strange ride. In the first couple of minutes I was not sure what I stumbled upon, it reminded me of home videos my drunken friends had made. I even thought someone slipped a gag gift into the DVD case. Then I started to pick up on what was going on here, and for that it was fine. It was done for camp. No one was taking anything seriously here. Everything was blown up for bombasity. There were some tremendous lines delivered in deadpan style, wacky costumes, and performers running around on a beach seemingly having a lark.

  At times with the pirates on the screen I felt like I was at the local Renaissance Fair. This is not a bad thing. I enjoyed the pirates, I enjoyed the other ramdom entities haunting the Island, and I enjoyed seeing characters i did not like for one reason or another being done away with. A couple of grumbling points - the blood did not just look silly, it was annoyingly so. Like 1st grade play Ceasar just got stabbed quality. Some of the ""special effects""  - even though i think that were done for camp, were sketchy enough to miss the mark.

  Bottom line, I enjoyed the movie. I laughed out loud a couple of times, which scores it points. And there were at least half a dozen cheesy lines that not only will I not forget, I will randomly blurt them out to either impress or annoy my friends.  I mean, someone actually exclaims, """"Holy double-s**t!  -  a cannibalistic pirate, combined with an immortal demon?  What a nightmare!""

  So take this for what it is, good fun. Its not scary, its not particularly gory (unless you freak out at slasher comedy) and has some funny lines.  And goofy folks dressed as Pirates seemingly having the time of their lives, and women running around in bikinis too.  Good fun!",1367366400,,1756,4.440625
8204901,2,B000SAGGPK,"This is a ""straight to video"" film. Not much acting, zero ""plot"", so-so costumes... kind of a bust as to time spent watching it. It's DEFINITELY NOT one I wish to see again!",1364601600,,173,4.2727272727272725
8204902,1,B000SAGGPK,"not well done. the acting sucked. alot of your line ,my line then your line. I first thought i had accidently bought a blue movie, but it urned out not be that either. Very cheesily done. Wal-mart tiki lamps and all.",1285632000,,216,4.2926829268292686
8204903,2,B000SAGGPK,"Did anyone catch that last Pirates of the Caribbean Movie. I still haven't checked it out yet. The unfortunate truth is I loved the first one but I really hated the second so I'm hoping that the third makes up for it. I don't know he truth is I liked it better when the bad Pirates all looked like dead ghosts and not like fish people, You see what happens when Disney takes over a project next thing you know you have talking animals and so forth.

Anyway I checked out a recent flick that my good friend Kristin wrote for a small production company that got distribution from Lionsgate that is the exact opposite of the recent series of Johnny Depp pirate adventures...Ok it flat out parodies them. I'm talking about Pirates of Ghost Island

What we have here Kiddies is the story of a group of marooned college graduates that are all trapped on an island that is inhabited by the ghosts of a group of Pirates that are eating anyone that happens to step foot on the island. What is different about this group is the fact that one of the girls is the reincarnation/descendant of the head pirate's wife and h wants her back. think of the Mummy with Pirates.

Now as far as the movie goes I like the story and the script. The dialogue was cheesy and campy but for a film like this it is intended to be. does anyone remember a flick from the 1960s called A monster in the Surf well not really any of you people but the guys that I know will remember it. I feel that this movie was made for the lovers of the cheesy B-Movie Lovers like me that like cheesy dialogue as well as hot girls in Bikinis and low prices sets and stock footage. I feel that Kristin knew what she was writing when she was asked to pen the script. I know that she took allot of heat from some critics but the critics that reviewed her I don't think would know a decent movie if it was right in front of them...That and they just wanted to see [...]. To that I say Get a girlfriend you losers. Or at least a decent girl and not some of those Skanks that you like to keep around

Now the acting was pretty bad but once again I feel that that was the intent. You see kiddies I think that the filmmakers knew that with a movie with the word Pirates in the title they would naturally be compared to that movie based on a theme Park Ride and went the opposite direction and made a campy cheesy 0 budget flick that is good for one thing entertaining you.

Unfortunately films like this are never appreciated Ed Wood Jr is often hailed as the worst filmmaker of all time and his flick Plan 9 from Outer Space has the mention for being seen as the worst movie of all time, I mean come on there are plenty worst than that. Did anyone see Battlefield Earth?...I rest my case.

10 Dead Bodies
0 Breasts (allot of hot girls in Bikinis)
3 Beasts
Pirate Ghosts
Samari Ghosts
Sailor Ghosts
Voodoo Headhunting Ghosts
1 Talking Island

8204904,5,B000SAGGPK,"Melissa Powell is a stand-out in this otherwise sort of unimpressive but campy pirate flick. Watch it to hear the pirate acccents fade in and out and to see some terribly bad special effects, but also to see a couple up-and-comers in young hollywood.",1194739200,,250,4.704545454545454
8204905,3,B000SAGGPK,"Okay accept the fact that this is an inexpensive made movie. Once over that I liked it. I call it a bit camp.  If you are a pirate movie collector, add this to your collection.
Starts out on an island with pirates hiding a treasure. Conspiracy- the pirate's that should come back for them, will not.  Soon, something causes the island to shake-rattle and roll. A voice booms forth to say they are all prisoners - lights flash - the Captain's wife disappears.
Back to modern day. Six newly graduated college students, who had been on a cruise and partying, have found themselves beached on the island. The next day one of the girls' is missing.  As the group tries to find Sara and unravel the mystery of the island, with pirate ghosts appearing and disappearing, each one gets killed in turn.  At the end only Brad and Sara are left.  Sara being the rebrith of the dissapeared Captain's wife.  A chase pursues, they defeat the Captain, who had been possessed.
Some funny lines, some campiness, some Ed Wood stuff, all in all a cute movie to keep with your Pirate Collection.",1193356800,2,1074,4.567708333333333
