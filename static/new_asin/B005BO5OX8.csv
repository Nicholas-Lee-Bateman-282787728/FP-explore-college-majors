4643818,5,B005BO5OX8,A great comedy that had me laughing nearly all the way. Certainly a wonderful twist to the normal comedy movies and many can learn from it.,1428537600,,139,4.384615384615385

4643822,3,B005BO5OX8,"The Seller does know how to ship and are on the ball about sending it out in a decent time. As for the Movie it is for 9 - 12 year old. If you like Goose Bumps TV show, then you would have a good chance of like this movie.",1406678400,,222,3.46
4643823,3,B005BO5OX8,"The real emotion that makes a character memorable just was not there thus I was disappointed. The youth, ages 7 and 9  laughed at the simple plot but did not state that would watch it again.",1377907200,,190,4.277777777777778

4643827,1,B005BO5OX8,"The titles says it all. This movie is one of the worst that I have ever seen. I am 11 years old and don't get scared of Goosebumps but not ready for horror movies and I love scary things so we bought this. Not scary at all! Amazon really needs a zero star rating. I've heard other customers say that too, so Amazon, please make one!",1318204800,4,332,4.045454545454546

8464060,5,B005BO5OX8,"Originally saw this on Netflix or perhaps Amazon Prime. My 10 year old made us watch it twice last year on the projector outside. Sorry not sorry for annoying the nuts off my turd neighbors. Anywho, he wanted to share the joy with his friends on a sleepover and was wrecked to learn he couldn't stream it. Thank god I found a disc. The kids all loved this and honestly, I do too. Kevin McKidd kills it as Hamish",1503014400,,411,4.215189873417722
8464061,5,B005BO5OX8,"I have looked for this film for years, having rented it at Blockbuster many years ago and since wondering if I would ever find it again. Of course I hadn't remembered the title until recently so there you go This is a funny, eclectic, strange whimsical movie. Cheesy CGI not withstanding I found the characters delightfully amusing and this is going to be in my all time  top 10 ghost movies.",1499904000,,392,4.52112676056338

8464068,2,B005BO5OX8,"Slow plot, cheesy effects, and limping story line make this an ""avoid and don't buy"" item.  I thought it looked interesting, but it almost looks like a high school theater project.",1434153600,,180,4.806451612903226
