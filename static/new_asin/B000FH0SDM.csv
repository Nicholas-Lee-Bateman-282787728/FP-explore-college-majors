8325118,5,B000FH0SDM,"Rossellini and Tom Conti are brilliant as once-and-future lovers at each other's throats.

There's incidental satire about Venetian informers, inquisitors, and the seamy side of life in the Most Serene Republic, all of which I found fun. But the heart and soul of the film is the fiery--and hysterical--interplay between the principals. Rossellini and Conti make the craziest interactions seem perfectly logical--from the perspective of love's inherent unreason. Their eyes are so alive and expressive!

The film doesn't drag for an instant.",1403308800,,541,5.585365853658536
8325119,2,B000FH0SDM,"A young woman escapes her arranged marriage when the elderly bridegroom dies at the altar.  Now that she is an extremely wealthy widow, three foreign suitors come calling.  The first is an English nobleman, who desires her money, although he is gay.  The others two are a Frenchman and a Russian, whose problems are a foot fetish and being a masochist.  Upon hearing these unworthy candidates are courting the rich widow, the town fathers become alarmed.  It's not that they care what happens to her.  No, they care about her money, and don't want her to marry and take her wealth to another country.  The town fathers engage the services of the widow's former lover to seduce her and keep her in Venice.  He is aided by a former prostitute.

This is supposed to be a farce, but it's only very mildly amusing.  Much of the humor is based on sight gags, so I don't think the problem is that the jokes are lost in the translation.

As amazon states, the DVD is region 2 and in PAL format, so you will need a special player.  The DVD defaults to Italian, but can be changed to the English soundtrack.  However, switching to English proves to be a bit tricky.  Oddly, the indicator arrows that show you which features are selected fail to load properly most of the time.  You have to either take the disc out and reload it repeatedly until the arrows appear, or you can randomly push selection buttons and start the movie hoping the English soundtrack is selected.  This is annoying, obviously.  Perhaps my copy of this DVD is damaged in some way that causes this problem.

I've watched this movies twice, and probably won't want to see it again.  However, if are specifically looking for comdedies in Italian, you might enjoy this more than I did.",1240531200,,1744,4.567741935483871
