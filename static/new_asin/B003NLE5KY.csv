4159939,4,B003NLE5KY,"It's not often that I watch British movies, so I was surprised at just how good this made-for-TV film was. English writer David Peace published a four-edition book about serial murders and police corruption in Britain. The books were adapted into three movies for British television, and while the crimes that take place are real, the stories are fictional.

What attracted me to the 1980 installment in the trilogy was that it starred British actor Paddy Considine, who I became an instant fan of after watching PU-239 (The Half Life of Timofey Berezin). Paddy is terrific as Peter Hunter, a police officer brought on to help with an unsuccessful investigation of a serial killer.

What I liked about the film is that it wasn't particularly fast-paced nor suspenseful like some American crime dramas, but a slow, building tension that really delivered by the film's conclusion. The cinematography was great, with cold and rainy scenes giving it a bit of a film noir vibe. I absolutely loved the movie's score, which was haunting and beautiful.

Remember, this is a made for television movie, not a big-budget blockbuster. So if you're expecting a movie in the vein of Seven, that's not what you'll be getting. What you can expect is amazing acting by an experienced cast, bubbling tension, and a surprise ending.

As far as Red Riding 1974 goes, I've been a fan of British actor Sean Bean since his breakout role as IRA soldier Sean Miller in Patriot Games. While he doesn't get much screen time in this particular film, he's representative of the top-notch casting. The film has an incredibly experienced cast of talented British actors, which makes 1974 a real treat. The standout performance in this film is definitely Rebecca Hall's portrayal of Paula, the mother of a slain child. While she didn't get to demonstrate her acting chops in Frost/Nixon (as love interest to David Frost), she's given plenty to work with in 1974.

Much like Red Riding: 1980, the film stars very slow, and patiently comes to a rolling boil by the conclusion. I also loved the lighting used as the film progressed, particularly a dinner party scene with shades of Eyes Wide Shut. What's interesting is that the movie was shot on 16mm film that was often used in the 70's, so a genuine period vibe is established. 1974 isn't the same quality as Red Riding: 1980, but a film you should check out if you like conspiracy movies.",1276473600,81,2407,4.818401937046005
4159940,5,B003NLE5KY,"I was checking out the Movies on Demand last night on cable and discovered that the IFC, ""in theaters now,"" film trilogy ""Red Riding 1974,"" ""Red Riding 1980"" and ""Red Riding 1983"" was being offered, on DVD as the entire trilogy, and on cable as invididual films. Although I am not a fan of serial killer films, except, of course, for ""Silence of the Lambs,"" I do like noir - both in literature and movies. So, I gave ""Red Riding 1974,"" a shot and wound up sitting through all 3 films in a row - a nightmarish triple feature - finally getting to sleep at around 4:00 AM - not something I usually do. The experience was somewhat like looking at a car crash - terribly upsetting, but I was unable to look away.

These three films are not for those who want to be entertained. I really cannot remember one moment of levity during the entire time I watched. This first movie in particular has an enormous impact, as it is the introductory piece and I never saw what was coming until it arrived - no usual police procedural here. There is violence, however - not for the faint of heart. As I wrote, I like noir, yet this film makes some of my favorites blanch in comparison! But I remained riveted...and I am no masochist!!

I would like to write about each film separately, but there is not a place for me to review them one at a time - so I will try to give the reader a synopsis of the trilogy. Please understand that by doing this, my review will be unusually long, but hopefully informative.

The ""Red Riding"" set is based on author David Peace's quartet of novels - truly grim whodunits, complicated by greed, corruption, conspiracy and local politics. The movie is set in gloomy, and seemingly always rainy, northern England, in Leeds, Yorkshire. The mean weather gives the viewer a feeling of foreboding throughout...and rightly so. Cynical, alienated young Eddie Dunford, (brilliantly portrayed by Andrew Garfield), has just been named crime correspondent for the Yorkshire Post. He is ambitious and this is his first major assignment. The new job happens to coincide with the death of his father, but his family obligations take a back seat to his zeal to succeed. He wants to become another Woodward or Bernstein, even as the Watergate scandal is erupting back in the colonies. Yep, Eddie really wants to earn his investigative journalist stripes fast and he is willing to take risks to do so.

Dunford's grim assignment involves the disappearance of 10-year-old Clare Kemplay. ""Clare is ten years old. She is fair and has blue eyes and long straight hair."" The last time Clare was seen, the day before Eddie gets the case, she was wearing an orange waterproof anorak, a dark blue turtleneck sweater, ""pale blue denim trousers with a distinctive eagle motif on the back left pocket and red Wellington boots."" Throughout the movie the figure of the little girl appears in sudden blurs with her orange jacket and red boots bright against the northern gloom. Spooky and so sad. Meanwhile, a jaded group of reporters takes bets on whether the child's body will be found by Christmas.

The images of the girl that the viewer sees are the same images that are seared into Eddie's mind after he looks at photographs of the crime scene. He is determined to stick with the case even after he is warned away...heavily-handed warned away.

Dunford's investigation uncovers 2 other similar incidents of young girls who disappeared in the vicinity and met violent ends - both cold cases now. He strongly believes there is a connection between the murders, especially when Clare's strangled and mutilated corpse turns up. No spoiler here. This is usually how disappeared children are found...when they are found. Dunford is determined to solve the murder and also find out who, if anyone, is set on suppressing evidence. He looks to those with power, those in high places, which is where his clues lead him. As Eddie follows his leads he enters a dark, dark world.

In all three films the visuals, the camera work, are extraordinary and really help to set the disturbing mood. The choppy camera movement parallels the choppy dialogue, which is a bit difficult to understand because of the actors' thick Yorkshire accents. I was watching so intently that I literally forced myself to be patient until I could understand much of the local dialect. The photography, especially of the northern rural scenery and urban city-scapes, is exquisite at times - you can almost see every blade of grass blowing in the wind, and the angular compositions of buildings, streets and alleyways - great landscapes, remsembling good paintings!

None of these films are linear. All three are really complex and frequently frenetic. There are flashbacks, flash forwards and black-outs. Minor characters in the first offering, remain so far in the background one barely notices them, become major characters in later films. I strongly advise watching all 3 movies in order. I don't think I could make sense of them viewing them separate and apart.

The cast in ""Red Riding 1974"": Sean Bean as a local and very powerful businessman, Anthony Flanagan, as a good friend of Eddie's, and Rebecca Hall as Eddie's lover who is also the mother of one of the dead girls, (years after the fact), do a superb job. They really seem so involved - like actual people not actors. And Tony Mooney and Sean Harris play a couple of cops I would never want to run into! The director really captured the feel, the ambiance, of the early 1970's. I was amazed at how easy it was to be transported back in time.

The film was adapted into three feature-length television episodes which aired in 2009. The three segments, (1974, 1980 and 1983), are directed by three different filmmakers. Julian Jarrold, (""Becoming Jane""), is masterful here, in the 1974 version. The screenwriter is Tony Grisoni. Peace's literary quartet is turned into a trilogy. I have no idea why the screenwriter left out one book, unless he combined it with another.

""Red Riding 1980"" is perhaps my favorite in the trilogy. The characters here are more developed, and since Part One provided such an excellent background, the storyline is easier to follow. I also became more accustomed to the northern English accent, thus understanding the dialogue was no longer a problem.

The setting is the same, Leeds, Yorkshire, and just as dismal and depressing as the scenario in ""Red Riding 1974."" Many of the characters reappear here, as they also do in Part 3, and the theme of heinous crime, local politics, corruption and conspiracy permeate this episode also. Here the backdrop, however, does not deal with a series of child abductions and murders, but centers around the ""Yorkshire Ripper,"" (an actual character), and a series of prostitution murders and mutilations.

The local residents are justifiably horrified at the murderer's five year reign of terror. He had killed thirteen women and left seven for dead. The police haven't come up with anything close to solving the crimes and the city's inhabitants are outraged. Stores close early and women are afraid to go out during the day, let alone at night. Assistant Chief Constable Peter Hunter, (Paddy Considine), is brought in to take over the case, infuriating the corrupt and complacent Yorkshire police. Hunter immediately establishes a superior team of 2 other excellent investigators, Manchester detectives John Nolan, (Tony Pitts), and Helen Marshall, (Maxine Peake), to work alongside him. The married Hunter, who has earned a reputation for being ""squeaky clean,"" slipped up once and had a brief affair with Dectective Marshall, his employee, which will come back to haunt them both. These three are to review all previous material concerning the ""Ripper,"" and investigate the ability and motivation of the West Yorkshire Constabulary to solve the murders. Is there a cover-up here? When a friend of Hunter's suddenly becomes the subject of an investigation, and then Hunter becomes the subject of another 'inquiry,' things really begin to happen and the the plot picks up pace. James Marsh, (Academy Award Winner in 2009 for Man On Wire), is the director and again, Tony Grisoni adapts the screenplay from the novel.

Part 3, ""Red Riding 1983,"" directed by Anand Tucker, (""Hilary & Jackie""), is the final act of the British crime trilogy. A ten year-old schoolgirl, Hazel Atkins, has gone missing on her way home from school. The press compares the disappearance to that of Clare Kemplay, found brutally murdered in 1974, almost a decade before. The case remains unsolved. Detective Maurice Jobson, (David Morrissey), is finding he has a conscience, at long last! He can no longer bear the shame of witnessing the web of deception created by the West Yorkshire police, with cover-ups spiraling uncontrollably. The bleak scenario is heightened, and it is in this final film that the material from the first two episodes become unified with the thrid.

This last film is as dark and desperate as the others. The storyline involves a male prostitute, a corrupt lawyer/solicitor, and a debased policeman. The reoccurring characters are all so human - complex people with complex motivations. Many of the same people from the first two episodes return. Again, the violence is quite explicit. There is redemption here, and the viewer reaches an awareness of the ugliness which can lurk beneath the appearance of normality - at least I became aware of this. There is a line which is repeated a few times in the trilogy, ""the North, where we do what we want,"" which manifests the three films.

Director Tucker deserves much crdit for tying up this finale neatly - no loose ends here. While in the first 2 films there was time to develop plot and characters, here the primary business was to create a believable ending, and in this, ""Red Riding 1983"" succeeds.

""Red Riding 1974, 1980 and 1983"" are phenomenal films. I really want to stress, for those inclined to watch - this is not an easy experience - but for me it was worth the ride. Highly recommended for people who love the VERY noir. All three motion pictures are produced by Revolution Films. The trilogy has already been released to theaters in the US in February 2010.

4159941,5,B003NLE5KY,"I bought this 3 DVD set subsequent to reading a rave review if it in the New York Review of Books. I can echo the enthusiastic comments; this BBC (Channel 4) drama is great viewing. Be warned that these gritty, sombre, uncompromising episodes (with three separate directors) are not pleasant viewing and will not appeal to those seeking a ""nice night's entertainment"".

The 3 episodes are separate but interlinked. The plot mainly revolves around corruption in the Yorkshire police force but interweaves the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper (born in Red Riding)and a child murderer. It takes some concentration to understand the roles of the different participating characters and, on occasions, the speech of the actors. The plot becomes clearer as time progresses.

This is British drama at its intelligent best. Great acting, directing and well filmed. This recent production will grip the viewer's interest from beginning to the end. Just be warned not to expect a traditional happy ending.",1264982400,28,991,5.1875

4159954,1,B003NLE5KY,"After the first movie in the trilogy, I would have given it 4 stars, but only because I had hope that the other 2 movies would come through.  By the end of the second movie in the trilogy, my hopes had gone down to 2-1/2 stars.  The third movie delivered the final blow.  The blow was delivered when a character, John Dawson, who was supposed to be killed in the first movie, suddenly reappears in the third movie, without even a casual mention of how he survived multiple shots to the chest at point blank range.  One of the scumbag cops, gets to be a hero at the end--not believable.  A waste of time.",1431216000,,603,4.254385964912281
4159955,3,B003NLE5KY,"I read all the books and was lucky to see their treatment on television. Neither the books nor the films follow the usual structure of serial killer yarns told elsewhere. The books were often written in a stream-of-consciousness style that was sometimes a bit off-putting to this American-born inveterate reader. The film treatments were much more enjoyable and interesting to me, but even then to expect Ann Rule-type true crime books or stories of serial killers made up from whole cloth is a fool's errand. There is a level of enjoyment in the books, but it takes a lot of work to find it and benefit from it.",1428969600,,612,4.675925925925926
4159956,4,B003NLE5KY,Truly enjoyed the trilogy. Wish I could make out the cockney accent a little better but overall it was a very interesting narrative.,1423612800,,132,4.782608695652174
4159957,3,B003NLE5KY,"Great actors and fine production values in a made-for-Tv trilogy, but it has almost nothing to do with the Peter Sutcliffe saga that it connects itself to.  While the story lines are concerned with real-life issues - police corruption, child murders, the worthless media - they are almost entirely fictionalized.  One of the few ""true stories"" in the trilogy is a retelling of the tragic case of Stefan Kiszko, an all-too-typical example of police destroying the life of an innocent man and letting a real murderer run free in order to pat themselves on the back for a ""job well done.""

The marketing blurb ""Better than The Godfather"" is absurd.  The Godfather is rich and historic cinema, while this is very well done for television.  I would compare it more with The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo trilogy from Sweden, and would probably also classify it with that fine work as being ""foreign language"" as well.  I love British stuff, but found the ultra-realistic accents in this frequently unintelligible.  Next time I'll watch it with subtitles on.",1423440000,,1050,4.898305084745763

Dates from Andrew Garfields days with the BBC before he hit the gym, went to Hollywood and donned spandex to play Spiderman. Shot in sinister cloudy almost greyscale light Garfields blonde hair is not discernible but his oversized mutton chops are quite prominent at odds with the boyish look of the rest of him. The Yorkshire accent and turns of expression take some getting used to. A murder mystery involving young school girls Garfield chain smokes, spends a lot of time in pubs, sheds his clothes and hops into bed with various women. And he uses profanity, a choir boy he aint. Police corruption and brutality figure conspicuously. The edition I watched forced me to watch a lengthy series of previews without jumping to the title screen and when the feature finally starts expect a minute of silence while the various producers logos spool across the screen. These caveats aside its a decent mini-series. One that kills off its principal  characters with disturbing regularity. The portrayal of police corruption is most disturbing.",1418860800,,1138,5.021164021164021
4159971,3,B003NLE5KY,These movies are very grim. They follow a group of corrupt detectives in West Yorkshire through the late 70's and early 80's.

4159973,4,B003NLE5KY,"This DVD contains 3 movies titled '1974', '1980' and '1983'.  I happened to watch '1984' on a cable network and didn't realize at the time that it was the 3rd movie in a trilogy.  I subsequently purchased the DVD and just finished watching the 3 movies in order.

Even though the 3 movies are interrelated regarding police corruption and some recurring characters, I felt from a viewing perspective that '1974' and '1983' were directly related as they chronicled the child abduction and murder storyline over a nine year period.  The movie '1980' told a different story of the serial killings of prostitutes.

I liked '1980' the best mainly due to the acting of Paddy Considine (Lead Detective) who was really up against it with all the police corruption swirling around him.  I preferred '1974' over '1983' again because the Crime Reporter (played by Andrew Garfield) was battling police corruption while attempting to cover the child murder case.  '1983' was a little anticlimactic as the child murder case was re-opened when another girl goes missing and also featured flashbacks which caused some confusion.  In addition, the focal point of '1983', Detective Inspector (played by David Morrissey), didn't hold my interest quite like Paddy Considine and Andrew Garfield did as his battle was with guilt over being part of the police corruption machine.

Overall the movies held my interest throughout and I'm glad I purchased this DVD.  As an aside, the movies take place in the 1970's and 1980's but I believe were all actually made in 2009 so the video quality of the films is excellent.",1405555200,,1592,4.973584905660378
4159974,4,B003NLE5KY,"I heard the 4 books inspiring this trilogy are brilliant and I can tell it by the way they've been adapted in those three films. The first one remains my favourite but the sense of apocalypse which surrounds the whole saga is al ost ubearable. It's dark and not just because of the subject (a ten years quest to find who killed some young little girls) but for the atmosphere and the sense of threat that doesn't let you go throughout the trilogy. A hidden, countryside england were institutions are held by dodgy people (no matter if they are cops, priests, journalist or businessmen) who create their system were everything must go the way they want. But the darkest thing is that this system of power and violence survive the death of the single ones, like a legacy of blood that ties together different people, sometimes above suspision.
So you hope that each new leading guy (there's one for each film) will solve the plot and let the mystery comes up, but you always get frustrated, like there's no way out.
It's a bitter and damned world that you end up witnessing by watching this trilogy, and it's a realistic world, depicted in such a way that only british television can do now.
Great performers, great photography, excellent blu ray.

4159975,3,B003NLE5KY,This is a British film about a reporter in the 70's investigating the murder of a young girl. I bought this because I am a big Rebecca Hall fan. Well she was good in the film but the film is dark and a bit disturbing.,1397865600,,217,3.8444444444444446

4159977,5,B003NLE5KY,"This crime trilogy represents the very best of British film making. For us American viewers I highly recommend buying the DVD set in order to use the subtitle function. In this way you will not miss the important and subtle dialog that is missed due to the Yorkshire accent and the soft voices employed in some of the most important conversations where clues are revealed. Once you get every word of dialog, then the story becomes even better. If you like police corruption and murder mystery, this can not be beat. The 1st movie 1974 proves to be the most gripping and best acted of the three, though that takes nothing from the 2nd and 3rd movies. In the beginning is a young Yorkshire newspaper lad just working his way into the profession. He has ideals, like all young people, these ideals clash with the intrenched way of news business and policing in remote Yorkshire. The result is gripping and mind blowing. The end is as shocking as it is exciting. Without giving anything away, I can say that in the last minutes I was sitting on the edge of my seat, fists clinched and growling at the lead actor ""For god's sake, do it!"". I give this the highest rating. All three fit together with seamless flashbacks that show to connections. By all means, buy this if you love murder mystery and love British film making. All the actors are flawless.",1386806400,,1348,4.574380165289257
4159978,5,B003NLE5KY,"Northern England has become a very scary place in several bestselling British crime writer's novels that have been adapted for television films. Val McDermid explores the area...one she knows well... in her series of novels loosely grouped together as WIRE IN THE BLOOD featuring Tony Hill, a profiler and Carol Jordan, a Detective Inspector. The WIRE novels became the basis for Robson Greene's television series of the same name. Greene not only directs the series but plays Tony Hill; he discards the McDermid plots and the Carol Jordan character after a few episodes and his series becomes darker and strange.

Now I've just watched the RED RIDING film trilogy adapted from the novels of David Peace that shares the Northern England setting. It's dark and strange, too, and fascinating!

RED RIDING TRILOGY: PART 1: 1974
Cast: Andrew Garfield, David Morrissey, Warren Clark, Jennifer Hennessy, Sean Bean,  Mary Jo Randle, Michelle Dockery
Director: Julian Jarrold
2009 NR 102 minutes
The trilogy begins with this tale of an investigative reporter (Andrew Garfield) who first pieces together a few Yorkshire child disappearances loosely based on the Ripper-like crimes that began in Northern England in the 1970s ... After viewing this first film, one can hardly forget a series of images that seem frozen in time. Garfield's handsome bloodied face is the first image of the film...and the segment ends with a still of the same bloodied face. When Dunford, the reporter, begins interviewing the mothers of the first three victims, an interesting green and white house appears to signal another visit to the mother of the latest victim. Most of the scenes are seen through a cloud of cigarette smoke...expected in a 1970s newsroom...but throughout this and the other films, a lighting up of a smoke signals the end of a particularly violent confrontation with the local police.  Dunford is constantly beaten and harassed, even water-boarded and apparently raped by the local police.

COMMENTS: The police brutality, the excessive smoking, the lure of the inhabitant of a green and white house....are startling scenes designed to be a bit haunting. Are they necessary? I suspect they are...for one can hardly forget the scenes as one catches breath before viewing the second part of the trilogy.

RED RIDING TRILOGY: PART 2: 1980
Cast: Paddy Considine, James Fox, David Carter, Nicholas Woodeson, Ron Cook, Maxine Peake, Tony Pitts, Jim Carter
Director: James Marsh
2009 NR 93 minutes
In this second installment of Red Riding...and after six years of vicious unsolved murders, Manchester detective Peter Hunter (Paddy Considine) arrives in West Yorkshire to supervise the murders and missing children investigations much to the chagrin of the former head, Bill Molloy (Warren Clarke). One member of Hunter's new, hand-picked team is Helen Marshall (Maxine Peake), his former lover. Hunter suspects that one of the supposed victims, Clare Strachan, was not actually a Ripper victim. Hunter learns that Strachan was a prostitute working for Eric Hall, a now-dead local policeman. Hall's wife requests that Hunter meet her and provides him with proof of Hall's work as a pimp and pornographer. She also mentions that she gave Hall's documents to Maurice Jobson (David Morrisey), the first detective to investigate the cases. Hunter is hampered during his investigation by frequent calls from his wife who has recently had a miscarriage.  When his Manchester home is burned down near the end of his Christmas vacation, he returns to West Yorkshire to learn that his superiors have taken him off the case.  The film ends with several violent acts. And the news that the Yorkshire killer has been captured and has confessed.

COMMENT: Considine and Morrisey are well cast and really shine in this installment of Red Riding.

RED RIDING TRILOGY: PART 3: 1983
Cast: David Morrissey, Lisa Howard, Chris Walker, Shaun Dooley, Jim Carter, Warren Clarke, Sean Bean, Mark Addy
Director: Anand Tucker
2009 NR 105 minutes
The final installment of Red Riding begins with the wedding of Bill Molloy's daughter.  After the ceremony, a group of West Yorkshire police and prominent citizens meet to discuss their investment in a shopping mall and some of their criminal enterprises.  The group has adopted a chant: ""The North: where we do what we want."" Meanwhile, a fourth girl named Hazel Atkins has disappeared and Detective Inspector Maurice Jobson (David Morrisey) has reopened the previous cases.  Jobson is plagued by guilt over his participation in the corrupt activities to protect high-profile figures from public exposure. Jobson is joined in an attempt to solve the cases when John Piggott (Mark Addy), a newly-appointed solicitor decides to explore the Atkins case himself. His inquiries lead him to Leonard Cole, the young man who found the swan-stitched victim in 1974 and who is now being framed for Atkins' disappearance. Cole is tortured and murdered by the police, his death disguised as a suicide. Using information given by Cole's friend, Piggott finds a mine shaft hidden in a pigeon shed where a pedophile and child-murdering ring exists in West Yorkshire.

COMMENT: Red Riding ends, as it began, in violence and murder.

AFTERWORD: A final and brighter image.  A young  and early victim with a backpack walks off into a grassy green field into the woods...replacing earlier settings of desolate country roads bordered by graffiti-etched walls and sinister-looking silos outlined by gray skies...
A startling, graphic, and brutal series ends with a nursery rhyme..",1378252800,3,5568,5.210290827740492

4159982,3,B003NLE5KY,"This trilogy is NOT an advertisement for the Yorkshire, England police force.  They are portrayed as the most corrupt, violent bunch of thugs that I've ever seen on film.  Even the lone 'hero' in the end has liters of blood on his hands after his late conversion.

The films, all part of a Channel Four (an English television network for my fellow Americans) mini-series, are based on a series of novels by David Peace(best known for The Damned United).  It very loosely follows a chain of events involving the Yorkshire Ripper, a serial killer of major repute during the 70's.

The 1974 installment features reporter Eddie Dunford (Andrew Garfield) fencing with his superiors, the police, and obviously shady businessman John Dawson (Sean Bean) over his coverage of the disappearance of a young girl.  Everyone wants him to back off, and the increasing danger only makes him delve into the situation more.  Everyone he touches or talks to could be a danger to him, but Dunford doggedly pursues his story.

1980 involves policeman Peter Hunter (Paddy Considine), who comes into Yorkshire from outside to investigate another missing girl, and to try and clean up the mess from the end of film one (Hunter is not in that installment).  Like Dunford before him, he runs into a series of stone walls, and the antagonism that every copper gets when he/she investigates his own.

1983 wraps up the story, with DS Maurice Jobson (David Morrissey), a minor character in the first two films, taking center stage.  Although he is a part of the police conspiracy in the first two films, his conscience, heretofore unseen in any of the police conspirators, rears its head.  He and lawyer John Piggot (Mark Addy) conduct somewhat separate investigations into a new disappearance, as well as the mentally disabled man who ""confessed"" to the murder of the 1974 case.  The mysteries are resolved ultimately, this is deliberately a mini-series and not a short television series that was cancelled.  That's key to keep in mind as you watch.

This should have been better.  That's my first inclination here.  There is a great cast of actors involved, including some well known names even to American audiences (Garfield, Bean, Addy, Morrissey, Michelle Dockery from Downton Abbey), and the story could be interesting......but.

It's just so bloody dark and depressing.  Serial killer shows should be of course, but it reminds me a bit of Karate Kid 3, where the hero takes so much abuse that by the end of the film you don't really care anymore.  And that was only 100 minutes, this is triple that.  The police corruption and brutality, while of course exaggerated, still makes me cringe just typing about it.  David Morrissey's Jobson is the loose thread that holds the stories together, though he's not the only actor in all three.  And he does a decent job, I guess, and you can kind of see echoes of what he would later bring to The Walking Dead (I'd only ever seen him in The Deal and State and Play).

Much has been made of the accents, and I agree that subtitles are needed for most American viewers.  I'm familiar with those accents from being a soccer fan, but even I was a bit lost without them.  I gather that they're not in the DVD version, but they are in the Blu-Ray edition.  The supplements however do NOT have subtitles, which forced me to abandon them halfway through (some interviews and making of docs).

If you can get this set for $20 or less, go for it.  It's dark, gritty, and a bit more than an R-rated version of an American cop show.  But if the price goes up, even for three movies.....then it becomes a case of how you want to spend your money.  Just remember, unless you have a personal dislike for some of these actors (if you hated the most recent Spiderman for example), that's the only way you'll be smiling during any of this.

Three stars because of the quality of the cast.",1370736000,2,3891,4.710059171597633
4159983,5,B003NLE5KY,"I know the area where the television film takes place and about the Yorkshire Ripper, the Moors child murders (now there's evil living amongst us in any language). And there are little girls kidnapped on their way to or from school in just about every country. Therefore, the expectations were a bit different for me.  I didn't need to question if the crimes were based on actual crimes or not. I did wonder how foreign watchers would figure it all out.

What surprised me was the police corruption angle.  It was well acted and shows what police corruption does to a society.  Don't know if it's true or if I'm a naive child of my generation and have been living in a  bubble. Whatever the case, this film hit me harder that the usual police corruption drama.  What happened to the nice bobby we grew up around?

Reporters here were shown in both a positive and negative light and that was a good angle in the drama.

In the end, it appeared that the real victims were the dead ones and the parents of the missing children who were exploited every which way.

A thought provoking drama which left you thinking.  In that sense, it was more than an entertaining film.

4159984,1,B003NLE5KY,"Firstly a word of warning. This is not a serial killer movie. This is nothing like Se7en or Zodiac or any other film involving a serial killer. Ok so what did I just see? This first installment of the Red Riding trilogy left me baffled as to what the hell this film has to do with serial killers and their victims. In fact the murders of children by the Yorkshire ripper was only a backdrop to a film that ended up being about a young newspaper reporter who sets out to discover who the killer is. There is little said about the killer, you never see him or his crimes, nor do you hear any details about the murders. In fact there are no murders or images of murders by a serial killer in this film except a few photos here and there. There is in fact literally very little even discussed about the murders. It's mostly about police corruption and how the law tries to stop the truth of who the killer is from getting out for reasons that are not explained. In the end the entire film is a painfully boring story about a single reporter going from one person to another asking questions, being beat up by the cops, and getting laid all the time. From the start till the last 6 minutes of the movie literally nothing else happens. And when it did the result seemed far fetched and bitterly stupid. There were only two things I liked about this movie and that is that Warren Clark who played Dim in 'A Clockwork Orange' and Sean Bean were in it.

4159991,5,B003NLE5KY,"Where this show elevates itself above most others is technically. A shot that is merely average in this show will be miles ahead of the best shots in The Wire. When I say that I mean the film experiments with angle, color tone, shot texture, image zoom and image context, and much more. The Wire, generally speaking, does not. I think the Wire is the best show I've ever seen, but that's because of its writing, plot, characters, thematic cohesion, progressive story arc, literary merit, and much more. By ""literary merit"" I mean the largeness of the questions it addresses and the sophistication (of theme, story arc, etc.) that it uses to address them. By no means am I saying that these artistic treatments exist only in literature, which is exactly why I like shows like The Wire and this, The Red Riding Trilogy. They prove that mature and ingenious art can and does live on the screen. I'm just using that term to describe it because, after all, books were here first, and they have still done, by far, the most with those large questions.

Anyway, my rant being done, Red Riding Trilogy has all the brilliant writing, story arc and progression, and immediate entertainment/shock value. But what I will always remember it for is the tone, the terrifying imagery and the artistry with which it was presented to me. The worst of the three films is the second, as it comes off seeming like it simply needs to be there in order to provide the viewer with some information which will be important for the final denouement of the trilogy. The only thing that keeps it from becoming a real loss is that, like the other two films, it has its own immersive tone and setting which match the period it is pretending to have been made in (each film was made to look like it was from the era that the title suggests). But at worst, during the second film I felt like: ""Okay, I get it, life is terrible, relentlessly. You're not making me want to hear this."" It's funny that the second one made me feel as such, because the other two are relentlessly cynical but they made me want to see more of this, to see how terrible life can be and perhaps to begin to explore why or how. But this second one turned me off.

On the subject of turning off or on, all three films also employ a ""love story"" or at least an ""somewhat interested in each other sex story"", pairing each respective main character with a respective main characteress. My girlfriend found this trite, and it is, but whether it's truly destructive to the main storyline is another matter.

The main point here is: when I think of evil, of nasty, gloomy gritty dank and grey and muddy and squelching, terrifying, child-molesting, creatures-living-in-the-slime-of-the-world evil, I think of this movie. Nothing that I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot, has ever captured that tone better than this movie. This alone would be a stunning achievement, but what rises this film into even greater greatness, quite honestly into feelings of redemption, comes from the fact that at the story's ending, thanks to one particular character and a particularly brilliant sequence, the viewer is made to think of all the numbing beauty that also exists, which makes us care enough to fight every day against that aforementioned evil. It brings to mind Chekhov, who said that he used a technique of showing great beauty just before scenes of a horrible nature, to make the reader feel the nastiness all the more incredibly. Here, we have a reversal. And oh, does the viewer feel it. Of course, this character and this ending sequence are simply the perfect final brushstrokes, which could not have worked without the entire film sequence before it working as objective correlative.

In summary? The Wire, The Sopranos, and many say (though I still need to check this out myself) Breaking Bad still might (still just maybe, not certainly) be better overall than the Red Riding Trilogy, but in tone and artistry, Red Riding shows us that British TV writers can play as well as any of the best of them in television drama. It's wonderful to see filmmakers working who remember that film is an art, that it's more than just a series of simple images with some words and some action. As much infinite praise as I have for The Wire, it still fits into this mold.

I also still need to finish Berlin Alexanderplatz, which, from the two episodes I have seen of it, not only rises above all of these shows filmographically, but thematically, imagistically, etc. etc. Perhaps the only shortcoming it looks to have is in a gripping and cohesive plot--which, however, seems to be exactly the point of BA, that plot is merely a trope to get to the meat, the important parts of life and death.

Of interesting note is HBO's Treme, which incidentally spills into Red Riding territory. I say incidentally because it is not from any unusual or artistic filmographic choices that Treme's creators make, but in the fact that you can't talk about New Orleans without talking about music, without hearing music really, so the show, great in and of itself, becomes a multimedia, multi-art experience.",1326844800,,5116,4.697881828316611

I didn't find the story line to meander at all - it is connected and cohesive, but you have to let it carry you along at its own pace without action hero montages or overt expository soliloquies. Yes, sometimes you have to watch, wait and think. There is a lot of evocative scene setting, which I love, and the filming was pitch perfect. Andrew Garfield was superb.

  To those who equate a British accent with the velvety, ""butter will not melt in the mouth"" tones of Rex Harrison, Sir Laurence Olivier, Leslie Howard, etc., the actors in this film sound as though they are speaking a foreign language.  So, to view and understand the dialogue in this film:

  USE YOUR CLOSED CAPTIONING!!!

(For DirecTV users, hit your yellow button, scroll to CC and select either ""closed captioning"" or DirecTV subtitles.)

The Yorkshire dialect, like other of the less polished British English dialects, can sound as though the speaker is talking with a mouthful of oversized marbles.

  Once the viewer can get past the ""mush mouth"" and enter the realm of the story, he will find the Red Riding Trilogy film is as seamy and hard-edged as the novels.  The stream of consciousness style is not my favorite mode of storytelling, but it can evoke the idea that crime has neither rhyme nor reason.  Words curling around other words, time racing to and fro... without symmetry, naked, frenetic fear and desperate spurts of energy; to me, these embody the style and content of this film.  You may love it or hate it, but you will definitely think about this movie after the final credits have rolled.

The other thing that I have a bit of an issue with is a number of the actors are speaking with such strong accents that the dialog is nearly impossible to understand. Since I bought this intending to watch it multiple times, I'm sure I'll get to the point where I will understand the accents so they don't really keep me from enjoying the movie and in time they will add to presentation. The filming and story telling is very interesting with a touch of avant garde and stylistically in a progressive 70s vein which i enjoy. Yes it is a bit of a challenge to watch, but I found that caused me to focus more instead of just casually watching it as I normally would have done. The acting I found to be very 70s also, I found myself taken back in time to the British 70s in a number of different ways and for me this added to the movie.

Yorkshire is one tough place; one can only imagine the hospitality they reserve for tourists. This movie makes you wonder if disarming the police in the UK is a simple effort to keep the public safe from their rampant corruption.

The movie was decent enough - but if you are looking for crime-thriller action, with less focus on police corruption and more focus on a serial killer investigation, look elsewhere.",1289088000,2,830,5.2406015037593985
4160021,3,B003NLE5KY,"The trailers/teasers you see for this movie trilogy make you think this is a sort of ""Zodiac"" treatment of the Yorkshire Ripper murders. No, it isn't. The Ripper murders are actually only dealt with on the second, ""1980"" disc of this 3-disc set, and then the investigation of those murders is only incidental to the main theme of ""The Red Riding.""

That theme is that life is nasty, brutish, and short. This linked set of dramas is cast in a gray monotone. There's the physically gray monotone of the old working class districts around Leeds; and then there's the emotionally gray monotone of all the characters in this series. The Yorkshire Ripper murders and then the two fictionalized series of child murders that are the actual investigative topic of Disc 1 (presumably taking place in 1974) and Disc 3 (taking place in 1983) just serve as hooks on which to hang illustrations of rampant police corruption, rampant corruption in business, and rampant human corruption in general. None of these characters apparently ever heard of the English tradition of ""engaging in pleasantries."" This is a world in which everyone is unpleasant to everyone else, all the time. You might come away from the films feeling that the murder victims are the lucky ones - lucky to be out of such an unloving world.

The theme of corruption is unrelieved to the point of becoming repetitious and clichd. There is even a brutally corrupt land developer included here. Will there ever, in any movie, be such a thing as an honest, decent land developer? The author and producer of this series apparently hold to the rather academic belief that only meanness is realistic. In truth, undiluted meanness is as unrealistic as undiluted Pollyannaism.

If you look for this series at a rental store, you will probably have to rent the set as three separate discs, paying three separate rental fees. Also, you might find this series hard to even find in the major U.S. rental stores. I was only able to find it available at movie rental stores in Canada. So if you are interested in seeing this depressing, but acclaimed triptych, it would probably be easier and more economical to simply buy it.

Although each disc does in one sense stand on its own, you really need to watch all three in sequence if you want to properly follow the evolution and partial resolution of the corruption and the child murders. Disc 3 seems to be an especially murky hodgepodge of flashbacks, possible imagined flash-forwards, and current action. But it does tie up a number of lose ends. And as with the other two discs, it makes more sense and has more emotional impact when you watch it through a second time. That's another reason to buy rather than rent the Trilogy.

If you are up for a downer, there is value to be had in the atmospherics and acting here. But don't even try to view the series without subtitles. The rapid-fire elisions and slang of the North Country accent are almost impossible for the average American to consistently catch. The standard discs do have English subtitling available on them, although those subtitles might be a little difficult to activate sometimes. If you are having difficulty accessing the subtitles, try clicking on the ""Subtitles Off"" and then ""English Subtitles On"" options alternately several times to get the subtitles to come up.",1289001600,11,3334,4.831873905429072

It was a unique idea to have all Three films presented at once and most certainly worth the price! There is a good amount of mystery and suspense and you will from time to time be wondering who can be trusted and who cannot but I must say overall very impressive.

4160025,4,B003NLE5KY,"'This Is The North, We Do What We Want', so says the policeman in West Yorkshire, England, town of Leeds. What we have here is a trilogy, 3 films of the times, 1974, 1980, and 1983 in this town and the tale of murders of young girls.

Most of the trilogy is about the corrupt police, botched investigations, the brutality and seemingly senseless mayhem that occurs during these nine years. In 1974, it seems the Ripper, aka 'Jack the Ripper' was out and about committing rape and murder of young girls, The public becomes distraught at the inept police force, but they are unable to move on it because of fear. A young reporter Eddie Dunford played by Andrew Garfield, takes on this world. From what Dunford can see, the police are too compromised to catch anyone. And it seems so corrupt that they influence everyone around them.

In '1980', the Ripper is still at work. The Home Office sends an inspector from Manchester to find the killer and clean up the mess in the police department. Peter Hunter played by Paddy Considine is an experienced detective. However, he has personal and family issues that keep interfering. The 'Ripper; is caught but disclaims knowledge of certain murders, which it appears the police were committing under the guise of the Ripper. Peter Hunter is caught in this maze and does not fare well.

In 'Red Riding: 1983' the deaths of the past decade sickens one of the police higher-ups, Maurice Jobson played by David Morrissey. He has been in on the fix all along, and undergoes a gradual awakening. He is joined in the fight by a shabby lawyer, John Piggott, played by Mark Addy, a hard drinking failure who is stricken by his own family connection to the Yorkshire violence. Into this mix and seen throughout the three films, but unable to reveal what he knows, we finally hear the hustler, B.J., played by Robert Sheehan. He witnessed some of the crimes, and narrates some surprises. The cycle of murder and corruption is brought to a close.

The first part of the trilogy was difficult for me to understand, some of the accents were difficult to follow and the storyline did not make sense. It took the second trilogy 1980 and 1983 to clarify the stories. Some of the same players follow throughout all of the trilogy. The greed, brutality and corruption is difficult to take at times. Could this really occur in any town, at any time? The direction and acting are exceptional. Each of the trilogies has a new director, but somehow the storyline was kept very recognizable. The innocents are given their day, and the true heroes are found.

4160026,4,B003NLE5KY,"It's difficult to impart just how good this is.

This is a trilogy made for British television based on a 4 book series by author David Peace. The books are said to be loosely based (very loosely) on the case of the Yorkshire Ripper. Though this is made for TV, at a glance, you wouldn't guess it. In U.S. television the made for TV movies have a rhythm that allows for commercials every ""X"" minutes. As the Brits don't need to bother with such things this is paced like a theatrical release and it's great.

Young girls disappear, are found dead with evidence of sexual assault and other craziness. A young Turk reporter is on the case and realizes all is not as it seems and begins to uncover corruption at very high levels.

This shows a very casual authority in it's making. Everything is just right. The shots are always framed and set up well. It's edited well and it doesn't seem forced at all. Plus, the director isn't ""grinding it out."" He'll take a minute to put in a shot that sets a flavor. He doesn't work as though every shot is a slave to the script. On that note: Each of these movies is helmed by a different director and all do a fine job. As others have noted, this isn't big, slick, in your face Hollywood fare. This is a quieter, more natural feeling ride through the investigation.

My only qualm would be with the sound. I don't know if was the mixing or the thick British accents but I missed more than I should have in the dialogue and really had to strain to keep a handle on things. The third film of the three, which revisits the first part of the story, threw me a bit because of this. I had a difficult time hearing things and I'd forgotten some of the important names so I did get more than a bit lost in the story.

This is great stuff and should hold up under repeat viewings. If you're at all a fan of British investigative dramas like Prime Suspect, then you should enjoy this. It is everything prime suspect is and more.",1283731200,2,1956,4.289972899728998
4160027,5,B003NLE5KY,"This trilogy, taken together, is easily the best sustained piece of filmmaking I've seen in years. I watched all three in a row at The Egyptian in Hollywood and was blown away. (If I had it to do over again, I'd have spaced them out a little... each is a tough, brutal movie in its own way and the cumulative effect was a bit exhausting. #3 suffered a touch only because I was a little overwhelmed by the time it started to come to its conclusion.)

Each is filmed in a different style, aspect ratio and medium. The acting is stunning throughout and the way the story plays out is continually engaging and surprising. The accents are indeed thick at times... some people might want to watch them, #1 in particular, with the subtitles. If you are a lover of film, this is can't miss. And well worth purchasing.",1283299200,5,809,4.429530201342282
4160028,3,B003NLE5KY,"Red Riding is a trilogy of films first aired on Channel 4 in the U.K. then released into american theaters as one big 4 and a half hour feature. The films are adapted from David Peace's grim but well realized quartet of novel's taking place in Yorkshire from 1974 to 1983 (Nineteen Seventy-Four, Nineteen Seventy-Seven, Nineteen Eighty, and Nineteen Eighty-Three). While there are obvious changes from the original novels (including one being completely dropped) with some characters playing different roles (as well as some being forgotten all together) these movies are very faithful to the basic story and overall tone of the books.

In the film 'Red Riding' we get the perspectives of several different characters in three different stories taking place in or around the 'Yorkshire Ripper' serial murders. The first story involves a young journalist (Andrew Garfield) on his first big assignment covering child murders. The second story is about a police detective (Paddy Considine) helping the local Yorkshire cops with the 'Ripper' case. The third story follows three different characters (a corrupt cop, and lawyer and a male-prostitute) as they investigate the resulting aftermaths of the first two stories. While each of these stories have different directors they are all well filmed and are faithful to the original book's sense of isolation and dread in a small town that practically rules itself unchallenged (the torture and mutilation scenes are intact and very hard to watch).

The acting in these films is terrific with Mark Addey, Rebecca Hall, Paddy Considine, and David Morrissey giving some of the best performances of their careers. Sean Bean is appropriatley shady (if obvious) as a local business man and Andrew Garfield (who's becoming one of my favorite actors) is pitch-perfect as Eddie, the young reporter.

Unfortunately as well done as these films are I had a hard time enjoying myself. Being a fan of Peace's work I knew the films were going to be grim but that still didn't make some of the more brutal scenes easier to watch (though to be fair the books were MUCH more explict). Also, while the novels were told from the first person perspective giving us a more focused look at the plot, the movies are so broadly told (though we are generally focused on one character at a time) that you see what's coming long before the main characters do. I've read all the novels but I think even those new to the stories will find the movies a bit too predictable. Also the ending of 1983 seemed too convenient considering what happened in the first two films.

Again, I realise it's probably a taste thing but I had a hard time enjoying myself with the Red Riding movies. If you like period thrillers and don't mind some predictable story-telling and some disturbing scenes you will probably admire what the the filmmakers have accomplished. For me however, after the story's 'surprises' are gone all that I was left with was the grimness and a sense of unpleasantness. But to each their own.",1281225600,13,3016,4.942800788954635
4160029,5,B003NLE5KY,"I had read a NYTimes article about this British made-for-TV three part series, and being a fan of film noir was intrigued. Happily, although obscure, all three parts were available on my system's OnDemand option.  About eight hours later, over two days, I was still reeling.

There is a continuous story-line, and a few characters who appear in two or three parts, but each section can also stand alone. The tonality remains the same, the abusive environment of Northern England over a fifteen year period. Some scenes are absolutely riveting, which in this case means both difficult to watch and brilliantly achieved.

Performances are so good. Nevertheless, an actor in Part 1 made quite an impression on me.  Looked him up and saw that this young British performer is named Andrew Garfield.  That was about eight months ago. ""Going to keep an eye out for him"" I thought. Last month, in one of those major Hollywood searches, Mr Garfield was selected over a number of bankable US stars to take over the lead role in SpiderMan!",1281052800,20,1028,4.818181818181818
4160030,4,B003NLE5KY,I love this series.  I own the original UK version.  But I must admit.  If you have not read the original novels--you will be adrift.  Not through lack of film/adaptation quality--but through accents which render much of the dialogue un intelligible to US audiences.  Accents are sometimes so thick (especially first segment 1974) that plot development is a Muddle. I can only hope that Blu Ray of this incredible series includes English  subtitles--to make the series right. Not the first time that BBC series left off the obvious-subtitles.  But this time--so necessary. Whether Rankin/Peace or other same such--no one should think that we USA'ers can understand dialects--even tho we have read the originals.,1278201600,56,711,5.238938053097345

8401240,5,B003NLE5KY,"Vicious, disgusting, more than gory, just gross, and yet so true to life if this is life. It sure is Yorkshire, accent, desolation and misery (more than plain and simple poverty), cruelty, pollution, greed, vice, perversion, etc. spread all over. All evils in one pouch, one bag in West Yorkshire and the motto that this is the north, where we do what we want, thats the great beauty of ugliness.

It will take you three long episodes to reach the culprit and you won't be surprised at all when you finally come to him. In the meantime the police would have revealed itself the most odious, ferocious and mentally cannibalistic institution you can imagine. Asking a question  for them is necessarily hurting, torturing and a few other things of the sort: breaking fingers, crushing burning cigarettes anywhere you can imagine, stripping the suspects naked, and the films do not show them naked (prudes!). There is not one single person in the police force that is able to do anything regular like find a culprit that is really guilty and bring that one to justice.

One journalist is driven to craziness and some deadly justice enforcing spree, and yet you will know if he was right in his choice of targets at the end of the third film. Another young man, slightly spaced out will be convinced under duress by everyone, probably only in the police, that he killed the girl. And he will end his life in prison. With little chance to be retried since he signed a confession and pleaded guilty.

And quite a few are questioned that way and yet the crimes are going on: kidnapped girls, then raped, and in many ways cut up and carved up and more or less endowed with wings and feathers.

And all that in a society that is rotten to the core, that speculates on the death of as many people as possible with pollution and the exploitation of them as long as they live with projects that are as crazy as they are greedy of shopping malls with cinemas and all kinds of entertainments to empty the billfolds of the gullible submissive slaves of the public till they are empty and they can then commit suicide or die young of any kind of hazardous escaping tentative or industrial pollution. And for the girls and women prostitution and promiscuity are the main two udders of everyday suspended death. You can imagine what the other two are.

And be sure that all the cadres of the police and the most respected people in this society, lay and clerical, are among the small circle of speculators and their only aim is to make money and thus to keep the surrounding society going because you cannot squeeze money out of marginal miserable derelict and impoverished proletariat. No matter what, they must have just a little bit more than their basic needs to be able to spend that little bit more in the traps of the entertaining plotters.

Is it a great trilogy? I do not know but one thing is sure even if at the end the killer is finally put out of the way all the corrupted elite of this part of Yorkshire will not be in any way even questioned, not to speak of prosecuted. After all corruption is the basic human dimension: the survival instinct of the more corrupted declared the fitter, by all means, even selling their parents into slavery and feeding their own children to the industrial sharks of our certainly not post-modern society but definitely pre-modern jungle.

8401243,1,B003NLE5KY,"This is set of 3 films, with one film per DVD. I read positive reviews on-line and found the 3-DVD set for $10 on Amazon, which I thought sounded like a great bargain. So I ordered it and I did watch all 3 films but in pieces over several viewings - I'd get bored and frustrated with the shows and have to watch something else.

Overall, they're dark and moody films but they seem like shows ""made for TV""... and definitely NOT North American TV, which moves along much faster and is easier to follow! These films have slow moving plots, with unresolved and/or explained details and actions (like we're supposed to know what characters are thinking when they don't talk!). The heavily accented English dialog is appropriate for the setting but it's hard to understand at times. There is a subtitle feature (the people who said the DVD's lacked this were wrong).

The story is broken into 3 films, each by a different director and focusing on a different lead character, although some characters/actors reappear throughout. The story is set to the background of the Yorkshire Ripper murders and I thought that's what the story was about, but it's not - that's merely the interesting background, over which they made 3 uninteresting films about corruption within the police force. The corruption affects and kills the cops, reporters, etc. who won't toe the line or who may expose it. That's the most I got out of it.

There are long periods where nothing really happens and no one really talks. I was constantly hoping SOMETHING was going to happen that would make sense and explain or move the plot forward. I think there's the potential to make a very good SINGLE film, with much tighter editing and a more logical and cohesive plot! I do think the actors were good but the film is not easy to follow IMO. I cannot see what others liked about it and I cannot recommend it to anyone.

Instead, I would highly recommend the original 3-film trilogy (and NOT the Hollywood version of the first film) ""Girl With a Dragon Tattoo / Girl Who Played With Fire / Girl Who Kicked the hornets' Nest"". They're not in English, but the story and acting are compelling and the plot moves along very well. Enjoy those instead!",1453593600,,2210,4.6445012787723785
