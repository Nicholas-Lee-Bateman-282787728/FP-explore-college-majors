The animation not bad. But then when the boy turned into an Xam'd I was like WTF. There every episode was getting better and a little bit more drama and intensity. Action is through the whole series so you don't have to worry about it. Once in the while it kind of reminds me of one of a Miyazawa Kenji films. Forget everyone else what they say even though it ain't looking that bad. But I recommend it.",1346976000,,559,4.045045045045045

X'amd: Lost Memories

By: James Y Glass

What an odd and beautiful anime, I really, really like X'amd, but no matter how hard I want to, I can't love it. What keeps X'amd from achieving true greatness, is its lack of development and explanation of the world of the story. For while there are many wars, governments, battles, and creatures, the show never takes the time to give you any substantial explanation for what any of them are, or why they are significant. As a result, it is always hard to feel for the characters, and the gravity of the situation they are in. The potential for true drama is wasted most of the time. Instead we're just expected to believe that war and hatred is bad, and peace and love is good. Unfortunately this is far from the first anime to have that message, and others have done it far better.

This particular story of good and evil begins with Akiyuki, an average, everyday high school student. But the anime universe seldom allows average high school boys to stay average for very long, and by the end of the first episode, his island home is attacked, and his body becomes the host of a mysterious being known as a X'amd. He is then saved and spirited away by a mysterious girl who has all the answers, but never gives them to the audience. She takes him to the postal airship she lives on, and introduces him to the rag tag group who also occupy it, and who will be responsible for teaching him the life lessons he'll need to learn in order to overcome his status as average high school boy, and help save the world.

It's a shame this story doesn't rise to become something unique, because it always feels it has the potential to do so, if someone would just explain what the heck a X'amd is, besides some sort of generic supernatural guardian of the world.

 What this series does have going for it is its lovable cast of characters (but what anime doesn't?). They must have meant something to me for I did shed a tear or two towards the end, not something that happens often, I just wish I had understand the situation more, maybe then I would have cared when one of the characters died, and why his sacrifice was significant. The animation for the show is also quite good. It must also be noted that the English dubbing of the show is superb (save for some brief cringe worthy lines from background characters), another example of how far English dubs have come in the past half decade.  Another high point is overall atmosphere of the show, which is extremely reminiscent of Princess Mononoke. It really does ultimately feel like this anime could take place in the same world as Mononoke only thousands of years later. Sadly X'amd's world is much more complicated then Mononoke's so the simple archetypal explanations don't suffice. And neither does the pretentious ambiguous ending. Though as far as pretentious ambiguous anime endings go, this one is pretty good.
 If you can watch this show for free on Crunchyroll or Netflix streaming or some other streaming service, I would definitely recommend it. Otherwise I would never suggest paying for Blu-Ray's or DVDs or digital downloads, without seeing the whole show first, and then deciding its something you always want to have with you.",1326758400,,3247,4.623263888888889
8405485,5,B003TX8QBU,"The animation in this series is simply amazing - I swear some was motion captured it's so well done. The plot lines, characters - even the equipment - all are captivating. Doctor Ryuzo - his past, and self-inflicted atonements. But, man, his wife - I just wished someone would shoot her - her character was just so spiteful, full of hate and annoying. Just examples of two of the well fleshed-out minor characters. They are all very real.  There's the required unrequited love with the two major players, Akiyuki and Nakiami, and among several of the other characters as well.

Many of the voice-actors were recognizable - after looking them up I found they were also in many of my favorite Anime. Full-Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Vexile, Vandread, Speed Grapher, Gunsmith Cats and many more. It's an all-star cast - voice quality to match the production quality.

On to the action - there's plenty of it. One on one fights, aerial combat, giant monster sized critters - petty much everything. But little is gratuitous - 95% is directly related to the plot.

If you liked Full Metal Alchemist, Vexile, Elfen Lied, Full Metal Panic, Claymore - anything along those lines, you'll really enjoy this series.",1318723200,,1204,4.887254901960785
8405486,5,B003TX8QBU,"Xam'd: Of the Lost Memories is an exceptional anime, one of the best I have ever seen.  It is currently available on Netflix and, at the time I'm writing this, is available for instant viewing.  I say that Xam'd is one of the best anime I have ever seen, and I am completely serious about this, currently it ranks in third place on the list of my top five favorite anime - and honestly I think that it is technically better than Record of Lodoss War (1st place), but my love for this anime sometimes approaches religious devotion, and so I can't rank Xam'd as number one.  I will warn you from the beginning that Xam'd is somewhat difficult to get into.  The story throws you into the middle of a truly fantastic world with very little explanation of what is going on, and then expects you to pick up the clues on the way. Although it offers a significant number of clues (way more than Ergo Proxy), I imagine that many viewers will have some trouble catching up and figuring out what is going on.  Trust me when I say that it is worth it to push through.  So, on to the review:

Overall: 10/10

As I said, Xam'd currently ranks third in my top five anime list.  So, I can safely say that I have seen very few anime that I enjoyed more than this, and I don't think that either of the first two are technically better than Xam'd, but due to either subject matter, or loyalty, they remain my top two.  At its core Xam'd is a love story, and it is the best kind of love story - a real one.  Nowhere in this anime do you find the cliche `love at first sight' or `wedding after two weeks' plots that are so common in romantic tales.  Xam'd is the story of two young people who do their best to remain true in their love for one another through a wide variety of trials.  The two main characters, Akiyuki and Haru, spend most of the first half of the anime apart, and so we see a growing commitment in their love for one another that is born of their separation. All in all, Xam'd is the best romantic anime that I've ever seen, and the romantic angle is only one part of the story.  Xam'd is a very complex show, blending themes of romance, identity, hope, loss, and the necessity of accepting pain as a part of life, all on the backdrop of a world war.  Think this sounds like too much for one show?  Generally I would agree.  There are not many studios that could have pulled this off.  However, Bones Studio has been responsible for RaXephon, Wolf's Rain, and both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist, so they have a lot of experience at this kind of thing.

Writing and Art: 9.0/10

With an anime I can't review writing in quite the same way that I would with a book. However, the writing in Xam'd flows well from scene to scene.  Transitions are strong, and while things are confusing at first, nothing is ever out of place.  If you pay attention, then you should be able to pick up the world easily enough.  The art is where this series takes a slight hit.  The art in Xam'd ranges from good to great, there is never a scene that is poorly drawn.  However, there is also not a consistent excellence in the quality of the art.  Some scenes just don't live up to the majority of the show.

Characters: 10/10

There is no bad character in Xam'd. There are some very negative characters, however there are no bad characters. Even the minor characters are well-developed, and shown a lot of care by their creators.  You will fall in love with Akiyuki and Haru, it can't be helped; you will root for Akiyuki's parents as they try to find their way back to each other; you will join Nakiami in her ever-present hope, and you will feel both frustration with and pity for the villains of the series.  As you watch this series, you will become deeply involved with each of the characters - which, in my opinion, is one of the most important aspects of any book or show.

World: 9.5/10

The world of Xam'd could be better explained, especially at the beginning of the series, and I know that this will scare some viewers away.  However, it is a complicated, fully developed (if slightly cliche in some areas) world that is both intense and interesting. There are a few aspects of the world that are difficult to accept, such as the war between the North and the South that has (apparently) been going on for the last thousand years.  However, these are very minor points to the overall story, and are fairly easy to overlook.

Plot and Content: 10/10

I'm not going to say much because I don't want to give anything away, but Akiyuki's story will take you from joy to tears and back to joy more than once.  The plot of this show is excellent, deeply thought out, and very well framed.  As for the content, there is a reasonable amount of violence (it does take place in a war after all), but this is far from excessive.  There is also one minor female character that walks around in a halter top, usually covered by a jacket.  Again, this is not excessive, but it is also not explained, it just kind of is.  So, Xam'd takes no hits from me for content.  If you get sick at the sight of cartoon blood, or you think that women should always be covered from head to toe...well, then you probably shouldn't be watching anime in the first place, but this one isn't for you.

Pacing: 9.5/10

Xam'd is a slow moving anime.  It is very well paced, and the story moves along at a near perfect rate.  However, it is generally slow.  If you don't like slow, deep stories - then Xam'd will probably bore you.  You'll be missing out, but I doubt that you'll be able to finish it.

Commentary: 10/10

This anime has some of the best thought through commentary of any I have seen for a long, long time.  This is one of the big reasons that it made it to the top of my list.  The commentary in Xam'd largely focuses around the nature of identity.  However, there are strong aspects of the necessity of accepting pain, the importance of commitment, and the need to hold on to hope.  Xam'd has deeply thought out commentary about what it means to be human, to know yourself, and to chase after both your desires, and your responsibilities.

Conclusion:

You need to watch Xam'd.  Even if you don't like it at first, keep going.  Let yourself fall in love with the characters, and let yourself learn from them.  It will be worth the effort.",1315526400,,6307,4.341025641025641
8405487,4,B003TX8QBU,"The story starts off with a pretty hefty right hook. I felt captivated after the first episode and watched as much as time permitted. The animation was really well executed, the characters have an extraordinary amount of depth, and the story has more than enough plot twists to keep you on your seat.

I found this anime to be more of a drama type than action type, which caught me off guard when looking back at the trailers and reading the product description. Mind you, this isn't a bad thing. Where the series lacks in action, it makes up for in character development and plot. The first half of Xam'd was truly the best of the series. The second half, however, felt like it was starting to stray off base and lose momentum. Regardless, I highly recommend this anime to just about anyone that enjoys a good story, with or without action driven content.",1305244800,,856,4.558441558441558
8405488,4,B003TX8QBU,"If you like steampunk, mechs, and typical Japanese lover's drama than you will like this series. It is not heavy on plot, but is heavy on action and from the start goes at 100 percent speed.",1295827200,,190,4.305555555555555
8405489,5,B003TX8QBU,I was disappoint to see that the anime was only up for rental on the Playstation Network for about $4 an episode. When I heard that Xam'd was getting a Blu-Ray release - I jumped onto the opportunity of owning it. Great anime - great artwork - well worth the purchase. It ends on a bad note due it feeling more of sucker punch than actually having any closure - but the second season looks to be so much better than what was already delivered here. Recommend.,1289174400,,459,4.287356321839081
8405490,5,B003TX8QBU,"This blu-ray box set collects the first half, epiosodes 1-13, of this awesome sci-fi action/drama anime series. The animation is sleek, from the backgrounds to the characters themselves. The animation studio Bones, also responsible for series like Fullmetal Alchemist and Darker Than Black, does an amazing job bringing this intriguing series to life. The accompanying soundtrack is also very well done and fits the mood and theme of the show. Plus, the character designs are nice. This release yet again shows why anime is best when viewed in full HD.

The story is basically about a normal high school boy turns into a superhuman-like warrior called Xamdou when a mysterious girl implants a gem into his arm. From there on out, he has to leave his hometown, friends, and family behind to battle other superhuman-type beings. The depiction of how the boy deals with this new found power and how it effects the people around him is at times humorous, dramatic, and other times heart-wrenching. You're left wanting to find out what is going to happen to him and his friends, new found allies, and family from episode to episode. Yes, it's really that gripping, in my honest opinion. Definitely not your typical sci-fi action/drama anime show. Highly recommended.",1287792000,12,1261,5.033492822966507
