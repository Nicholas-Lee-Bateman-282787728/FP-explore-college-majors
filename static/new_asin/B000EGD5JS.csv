2518557,5,B000EGD5JS,Saw this on Gallery HD and rushed to my computer. Its not HD but it looks and sounds great. Camera/dance orchestration is brilliant.,1213747200,,132,4.782608695652174
2518558,5,B000EGD5JS,It was so easy to purchase and it arrived really fast. This is a product I never thought I would be able to find anywhere but amazon had it and in  perfect condition.,1209340800,,166,4.03030303030303
2518559,5,B000EGD5JS,"I put this on my christmas wish list last year but no one bought it for me.
I finally broke down and got it myself.
It's beautiful and mesmerizing.
The music is great too.
I went through the trouble of loading it on my ipod so I can listen to it in the car.

I've probably watched it 10 times so far.",1202428800,,300,3.838709677419355
2518560,5,B000EGD5JS,"An amazing film of a ballet that, given its use of various media, is perfectly suited for the cinema.  ""Amelia"" visually articulates the ways in which gender is often performative.  The ballet's fluid yet artificially ""designed"" bodies remind us of larger cultural categories, specifically how sexuality is itself fluid yet artifically choreographed by law/policy makers.  The performers' bodies become robotic, hyper-mediated in, of all things, Armani suits.  A wonderful, exciting film.  And check out Billy Smith's and Zofia Tujaka's invigorating pas de deux.  Smith is incredible.",1185235200,5,584,5.732558139534884
2518561,5,B000EGD5JS,"As the previous review states - Amelia is a stage production adapted for the camera, choreographed by Edouard Lock and danced by members of La La La Human Steps, a contemporary ballet company based in Montreal, Canada.  For any dancer (contemporary or classical) this work not only challenges and collides paradigms of both traditions by including meticulously articulated (and incredibly quick) pointe work and partnering with intense gesture phrases and 'state' work...it also presents to us a new way of thinking about dance films, cinematography, and lighting.  The piece is a tremendous artistic experience and something that anyone even remotely intrested in art should see.  Amelia is something that, for dancers in particular, is invaluable.  It is the best dance film I've seen in all respects, and something that should be a part of anyone's DVD library.  The extra features (as described in the previous review) are wonderful and a nice added bonus, but the work itself is truly astonishing.",1152921600,12,1002,5.2375
2518562,5,B000EGD5JS,"First of all, the name of this ballet movie is ""Amelia"" and it is performed by the dance company ""La La La Human Steps"".  It is choreographed using mostly classical ballet forms, most notably pointe work(the choreographer and producer, Edouard Lock, really loves pointe work!) and pas de deux, although other groupings are included and the men dance in the usual way, with one exception:  there is a pas de deux with a man and a woman, both dressed as men and both on pointe!  The costumes are typical of modern dance, the woman wear leotards and the men wear pants and jackets.  Amelia is freely adapted from a stage production of the same same, but this is first and foremost a dance-for-camera movie, where the camera becomes an integral part of the action, using shots of many different angles, and rotation, dolly, and crane shots.  The dance space itself is quite interesting and is difficult to describe, but it looks a little like the inside of a ceramic vase.  The lighting is also very intricate.  The action is mostly very fast and frenetic, and the choreography is very challenging including some very difficult steps, both on the floor and in the air.
This is a two disc set, the first disk is the ballet itself and includes an optional commentary, and rehearsal footage(accessed in interactive mode).  The second disc is a little tricky.  It includes printed facts on productions, biographies, and awards of the dance company.  On some of the production boards, there is a media section with either one or two icons.  The icon to the left is for still images and the icon to the right is for video clips, so be careful not to miss those features as I did the first few times!
If you like ultra-modern ballet, you should enjoy this.",1147305600,30,1745,4.651465798045603

8109493,4,B000EGD5JS,A great combination of scenery lighting costuming choreography camera angles music E Lock is without a doubt a extremely creating person in a huge range of art media,1389744000,,165,4.928571428571429
8109494,5,B000EGD5JS,"The majority of reviews here (including all 3 stars or less) are for the Amelia Earhart biopic not LaLaLa Human Steps' Amelia.

Stunningly choreographed dance, camera work, and lighting, this is an astounding, beautiful, and moving ballet film.",1358640000,,244,5.421052631578948
8109495,5,B000EGD5JS,"If you're here and looking at this, you probably have already seen it live, watched some or all of it on YouTube, or know about this piece already. I don't think I need to go into this riveting and stunning work of art. You also probably know that it's not filmed like a straight forward dance documentary. The cinematography and editing have a style and artform unto themselves. Unlike the awful filming of Bill T. Jones Still/Here, this fits the piece and complements it with precise vision. The set alone is worth talking about. I'm giving it five stars because of that since most reviews of this nature on Amazon are of the film itself and not usually about the product...

... So here's a quick review of the Blu-ray itself. The picture quality is surprisingly not that good. Oddly grainy. I wouldn't imagine that it's much better than a DVD or even an old LaserDisc for that matter. So there's that. It's pretty evident on a large screen TV, but on the PC you can use some correcting features in software like PowerDVD 15 to enhance and sharpen it a bit.

BUT... the extras are GREAT. Much love and care went into producing this product, so DON'T SKIP THEM!!! Full commentary by Mr. Locke himself, lots of La La La Human Steps past dance clips, and an interesting interactive behind the scenes feature. If you're like me and watch great dance pieces repeatedly over time, it's worth every penny.",1314230400,,1401,4.6
8109496,5,B000EGD5JS,"Love, love, love this film.  A friend recommended it to me and I couldn't be happier with what I saw.  I played this film on a projection at my birthday party and because it's just music and visuals, it was perfect for a party atmosphere.  Beautiful dancing and creative film making.  Loved it!",1293926400,,294,4.490566037735849
8109497,5,B000EGD5JS,This is an amazing display of art in the form of dance! The music is awesome as well. It has that funky feel to it that will make you want to watch it over and over again.,1289779200,,171,3.6486486486486487
8109498,5,B000EGD5JS,"I wouldn't go to a ballet if you paid me. But this film... is arrestingly beautiful. It's so personal, so intimate, so erotic, so moving. The music is gorgeous, stark, striking---everything the film is. Watch it on youtube and see.",1259366400,4,231,4.8
8109499,1,B000EGD5JS,"This disc has been a no. 1 disappointment to me and opens with monotonous, unappealing music. The flexibility of the dancers is most impressive but hard to sit though because of the excruciatingly unappealing music. To me anyway, your take might be different.
Later scenes are better but IMHO dollars are better spent elsewhere. It is obviously an impressive production so maybe it appeals to someone else who can give a more positive review.
POSTSCRIPT:  I thought the first bit was sped up but I've been assured this is not so.  It has obvious appeal to some so I might try it again sometime.  If I change my mind I'll let you all know.",1245542400,3,638,4.578947368421052
8109500,5,B000EGD5JS,"Wow!
Beautiful!
I don't get it but... who cares?! The dancing is amazing and beautiful and like nothing else. The set is amazing and beautiful and like nothing else. The clothes are amazing and beautiful and like nothing else. The dancers themselves are amazing and beautiful and like nothing else. The music is amazing and beautiful and like nothing else.

In fact, the music is really as amazing as the dance. Reworkings by David Lang (a minimalist) of Velvet Underground songs, it made me go back and listen to that 60's album. The new songs are just as effective and true to the lyrics as the old, but in a completely different way.

Not to distract from the unbelievable dancing though...

Check it out!",1221004800,,708,4.693548387096774
8109501,5,B000EGD5JS,"This is not something that I would normally find on my own, but passing through the channels and I saw this on gallery HD.  My mind was blown by the beauty and elegance of the dancers and also the innovation used with the camera angle work and also the lighting.  I wish i was able to find the music alone to listen to.  Anybody have an idea? Regardless the visuals are stunning and the movements are so precise it's just phenominal and a definate must see.  During the credits they play ""all tomarrow's parties"" and you see lou reed and d lang listed as the music composers to different songs.  I say that because I am watching this as I type.",1215302400,,644,4.289256198347108
