8362477,2,B002BX7TG2,"This is just a DVD in a case and when I try to print out the music, I can't get to it.  Since he only talks about techniques, you need the music to see what chords he is using.  It's frustrating!!",1499644800,,196,3.7560975609756095
8362478,3,B002BX7TG2,"No where in the description is the fact that this is a companion DVD for the  Lyle Lite book.  Mr. Ritz introduces and  plays the seven pieces,  first slow and then up to tempo with some friendly comments on the arrangement.  There is a bass player in the background, so you will never sound this good alone.  It is true that the sheet music is encoded somehow in the DVD.  However, it is standard musical notation, not tab; so don't bother unless you can sight read.  I'm sorry, I was really disappointed, Mr. Ritz has a fabulous reputation. I just don't see how this is going to teach me to play like him.",1469232000,,607,4.3097345132743365

8362480,5,B002BX7TG2,I purchased a ukulele for my husband on our anniversary and he loves learning.  This is fairly advanced.  We know Lyle from Kailua Hawaii and have always loved his music.,1428883200,,170,4.633333333333334
8362481,4,B002BX7TG2,Bought this CD for the wife hoping she will pick up on playing her brand new yukelele.  We'll see if it helps!,1402444800,,110,4.0
8362482,5,B002BX7TG2,"Fantastic Ukulele player.  He is a good instructor, but the chords are hard to position with your fingers and make the fast change around.  With time, you can master his style of Jazz playing on the Ukulele.  It would help to have a Tenor Ukulele with a Low G string.",1385942400,3,267,4.3
