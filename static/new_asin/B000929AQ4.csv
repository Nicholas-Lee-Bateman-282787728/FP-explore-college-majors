8056532,3,B000929AQ4,"I WAS DISSAPOINTED! EVEN THOUGH THIS DVD WAS RELEASED IN 2005, THE CONTENT IS OVER 20 YEARS OLD! THE SONGS ARE GREAT BUT THIS IS AN OLD CONCERT. I THOUGHT I WAS WATCHING WOODSTOCK ALMOST. PETER DIDN'T DO ANY ANTICS ABOUT OTHER ARTIST LIKE HE DOES NOW LIKE JOHNNY CASH AND MICK JAGGER.
I WISH I HAD KNOWN MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE DVD.
AMAZON DID A GREAT JOB OF DELIVERING AS PROMISED BUT I WISH THEY HAD SAID THE CONTENT WAS FROM 1986 OR 1987.",1232409600,,440,4.188235294117647
8056533,3,B000929AQ4,"OK, if you've found this listing, you probably know who Peter Noone is - the front man for the successful group, ""Herman's Hermits"" that had a number of hits way back in the 60's (and 70s?) during the ""British invasion"" which was dominated by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.
  I won't say that all the songs on this DVD were great songs, but most were certainly good songs. The appeal though, is not so much the talent and musicianship, but it's the memories. I'd forgotten how many hits the ""Hermits"" had back then. It was good to hear them again after so many years.
  The concert is outdoors - mostly in the daytime. The stage and backdrop was quite large, but the crowd was pretty small. (I guess many HHs fans have disappeared in the 40 or so years since H.H.s were big). Noone still does fairly well as a performer, but the band fails to deliver much excitement. (Maybe we've come to expect more from live concerts nowadays. Yet, would we enjoy ""Mrs. Brown You Have a Lovely Daughter"" if it was done to a driving bass and screaming electric guitars? Probably not). The music was done in the same form as it was recorded in back in the 60s. The only hit song not done (as near as I can remember), was ""Henry the Eighth"", (which was not a great song, but it had a certain charm). I missed it.
  The Chambers Brothers performed just two songs on this DVD. Their hit, ""Time"" was one, and it was good to watch. This group had energy and excitement. I would have liked it if they had done more tracks.
  In the ""Bonus"" material, there are some trailers of four DVDs that are available thru the producers of this DVD, one of which has nudity and pornographic images which may be offensive to some, and certainly innapropriate for children. Be advised if you play this in a family setting.
  Overall, this DVD will appeal to those who grew up, as I did, listening to British Pop and Rock music some four decades ago. It will certainly bring back lots of memories.",1187049600,8,1965,4.403314917127072
