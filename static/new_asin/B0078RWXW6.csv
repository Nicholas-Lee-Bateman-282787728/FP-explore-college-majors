8512361,3,B0078RWXW6,"Denying the presence of internal power as a ""mystification"" is not good for presenting this skill. Each of the movement could be presented in more detail using the methods of presentation and teaching established by recognized Chinese schools of the art. Instead, it's offered to watch the showing of each specific fist to a group of  inexperienced trainees followed by asking them to repeat the movements, with are done with all the mistakes natural for beginners. This is very distractive and time wasting and is not the way of serious teaching of the art.",1437955200,,558,4.9361702127659575
8512362,5,B0078RWXW6,"I practice Hebei XingYi, and the DVD is for ShanXi XingYi, but the principles behind the movements are the same. Ken manages to show aspects of movement and form that most teachers simply do not show. It is said that instruction-by-DVD will never match instruction-by-teacher, and that is true, however this DVD may be an exception to the rule (unless one is fortunate to have a teacher who shows some of the key fundamentals in the manner that Ken does). You cannot go wrong with this DVD. Simply cannot.",1361318400,,505,4.685393258426966
8512363,5,B0078RWXW6,"I have been practicing and teaching a Style of XingYiQuan (Hsing I)for over 20 years.  Always searching to learn more, I picked this Video up just to browse through it. I had hopes of maybe be reminded of certain points or possibly see things through some new eyes.  I was very presently surprised to find that not only was the instruction very accurate and thorough, but I was given insights into a branch of Hsing I that I do not myself teach.

I was very Happy to see someone teaching Internal Arts without all of the mystical hokum that so often surrounds and waters down perfectly sound combat arts.

I commend Mr. Gullette for his well received offering and encourage him to produce more of the same type of material. If you want to start at the ground level and learn the art of Hsing I Chuan, and can not find a quality teacher.  This may well be your best option.",1335744000,5,872,4.391304347826087
