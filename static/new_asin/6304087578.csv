Good action scenes with entertaining gunfight scenes. I never did figure  out what the terrorists were trying to obtain. Was it nuclear in nature?  The terrorists never did issue demands. Perhaps they told Anna Nicole Smith  and she forgot. Her nude scenes were entertaining because she had no lines.  Perhaps she shpuld stick to nudie videos.,960508800,5,493,4.741176470588235

778293,4,6304087578,"After the opening credits end, this film offers zero credibility.  I give it four stars because it is truly one of the very few films that is so awful, you can't refrain from laughing (hysterically).  That, in my book,  is entertainment.
Anna Nicole Smith and whoever plays her boyfriend are  easily the two worst actors you will ever see grace film.  Smith can't even  stand in a shot, saying nothing, and be convincing.  When she radios into  dispatch from her helicopter, you'll laugh for hours on end.
In perhaps  one of the greatest special effects shots of all time, the side of a  downtown Los Angeles building is blown up.  The building's model is made  out of newsprint and cardboard, and two minutes after the explosion, there  isn't any broken glass, debrit or any semblance that anything had  happened.
The spinning backhanded slaps Anna displays defeating the  villain at the conclusion of this film are worth the hour and a half of  your life you realize you wasted only three minutes into the film.",954288000,5,1013,4.735632183908046
778294,1,6304087578,"Where do I begin so you can get some idea of this whole bad-version-of-Die-Hard-meets-softcore-porn mess?  Let's start with poor pitiful Anna.  This wannabe actress is so short on talent, you'll be  howling at how bad she is.  When she isn't whining her lines with a really  bad Southern drawl, then she's pouting her collagen-bloated lips.  That's  it.  That's the extent of her acting.  Cue card reading is very evident and  rumors that she couldn't remember the lines from the grade-school script  are confirmed when an earpiece is noticeable in a couple of scenes.  But  she's not the only bad actor in this disaster.  The supporting cast is full  of over-the-top thespians who seem convinced they'll win Oscars for their  amateurish performance.  The juvenile script doesn't add to this either.  Plot gaffes abound.  The most glaring is when Anna easily kicks through a  window in a building that is supposedly designed to withstand riots and  military firepower.  Go figure!  Then we're treated to a downtown Los  Angeles with almost no cars or pedestrians.  Although, once the bad guys  start plummeting to their deaths and the police finally arrive, then  there's traffic everywhere and there are more civilians running around than  at a local shopping mall.  Continuity is non-existent.  After fighting off  one of the bad guys, Anna has blood on her right arm and on the right side  of her face.  A couple of scenes later, the blood is gone.  Then it  reappears on the left side of her face.  And despite all her fighting, her  long fingernails never break or chip.  What a woman!  The whole thing  becomes so pathetic, you wonder who edited this.  Even the three nude  scenes (which have nothing to do whatsoever with the rest of the story) end  up being more comical than erotic.  One interesting comment: in a storyline  that supposedly takes place in one day, Anna actually gains weight between  the time the movie starts and the final scene.  Looks like she was visiting  the fridge a little too often between takes.  A sad, sad piece of wasted  celluloid.",949017600,5,2071,4.84393063583815

778461,2,6304087578,"This DVD package is extremely basic and has no extras, but believe me when I tell you that there is plenty of suffering on this single disc.

""Skyscraper"" stars Anna Nicole Smith as Carrie Wisk, a helicopter pilot for ""Heliscort,"" an air taxi service in Los Angeles. She is married to an LA cop and finds herself in the midst of a confusing plot complete with government conspiracy, terrorist ninjas, gun battles, a top secret briefcase in a dumpster, and an obligatory shower scene. The script is largely incoherent, but it's better than the acting. Her accent is beyond tolerable, and her countenance does not exactly lend plausibility to her casting as a pilot of one of the most notoriously difficult to fly machines on earth.

After a subplot about wanting to have a baby and her husband's fear of flying (apparently her boss just lets her take the helicopter home and use it for errands), her hubby, Gordon (Richard Steinmetz) gets dropped off at terrorist central, where he promptly asks one of the bad guys to cuff himself (I guess police procedures are a bit more laid back in LA). While Carrie whisks the bad guys from terror site to terror site obliviously, Dudley (Gary Imhoff), the worst security guard ever, realizes that a huge skyscraper is being taken over by terrorists and its occupants are hostages. The next half hour or so features lots of extremely bad accents, ridiculous stereotypes, and plotpoints that lead nowhere. Suddenly the least likeable character in the movie enters the distasteful melange on a Big Wheel. Who could it be? Why it's Billy Ray, played by Daniel Wayne Smith (who has a cameo in ""To The Limit"" as an altar boy as well), Anna's late son and obvious kidnapping fodder, who is the only one able to escape the vicious terrorists while riding around the building going ""vroom."" Seriously. In real life both Anna and Daniel had tragic lives; in this film you will have no difficulty sensing their special relationship, as acting talent is evidently largely inherited.

Of course Gordon is the police officer assigned to the case, and after a disgusting flashback establishing that Carrie excels at marksmanship (Caution: the love theme from ""Skyscraper"" is far more odious than anything ever recorded by ""Berlin""), Dudley and Carrie team up to retake the building. Dudley explains that the ""Emergency Containment System"" is activated, rendering the building incapable of letting anyone in or out, in violation of every building code on the planet. Despite this revelation (and lots of fretting from the building's architect, which pads the film immensely), the next shot is a cop walking in an open door.

Since everyone is sealed in the building, Carrie calls on her vast intellect and sets the building on fire, and agrees to give herself over to the terrorists. (Seriously.) This is when I learned two very interesting things: first, in LA a hook and ladder truck responds to a trashcan fire; and second, an abundance of Shakespearean quotes in a terrible movie only exacerbate the awfulness of the film, they do not raise the standard of dialogue. The terrorists don't seem to grasp that shooting the hook and ladder truck with a Rocket Propelled Grenade will attract police scrutiny, and reinforcements arrive in record numbers. Carrie and Gordon rendezvous in the basement, and it's Carrie who goes to rescue the hostages, not the trained police officer. You just know that the terrorists will eventually use hapless Billy Ray as leverage, drawing Carrie into a karate death match on the roof, and you would be right. I won't tell you how it ends, but I'm pretty certain you can guess (like you actually needed to watch this thing to know).

This movie is relentlessly cheap: in actuality only one helicopter appears onscreen playing all airborne roles (check the registration and very temporary ""Police"" decals if you don't believe me), and except for the scenes in Carrie's house (complete with Marilyn Monroe print) and the helicopter scenes, it's pretty much shot in an office tower, making the budget lower than low. If you are after a bad movie, this definitely fits the bill, but it's not remotely entertaining, even for camp value. Smith appears out of shape and not especially alert, and her acting (while not the worst in the film) is not so much funny as sad. This is a long, tough slog and I can't recommend it for any reason: even if you goal was to see Anna and her ample assets, this film is beyond the threshold of pain.

After viewing ""Skyscraper,"" I assumed that it had to be the worst Anna Nicole Smith movie ever made, but ""To The Limit"" is a strong contender in every way. In this one Anna plays Colette, a CIA agent who loses her shady art-dealer husband to a mysterious explosion while simultaneously across town mobsters Frank DaVinci (Joey Travolta) and Lupe are getting married. After seeing some hilarious composite footage of a helicopter being shot down by a sociopath, numerous ninjas dressed in black with ski masks and machine guns invade the DaVinci wedding, which quickly devolves into a shooting gallery. Lupe is killed, but Frank rallies back to life while we meet the crooked crew. They all have names like Joey and Philly Bambino, and really needed a dialogue coach or a trip to Italy to master their accents. Since this makes so much sense so far, the first curve ball (yawn) involves Frank being an agent during the Vietnam war when he was sent to Hanoi to assassinate General Tang. (""You remember that last black ops we had in Hanoi?"") Ignoring the ludicrous impossibilities of that as a premise, it serves to tie the whole movie together in a way I can only guess at, while padding the running time immensely.

Colette invades Las Vegas and immediately has a shootout, steals a police car, and runs it into a helicopter (don't ask), defeating ninjas and local law enforcement officials alike. Despite numerous plot detours (the petulant runaway teenage girl, a killer nurse, the worst Las Vegas review in history, Philly Bambino's serial infidelity, Colette taking a shower, etc.) the main characters finally rendezvous in Frank's hotel room. There Colette reveals that she is a CIA operative (yeah, that's plausible), but while she says ""I was proud to work for my company"" (groan), she fell for a mobster, and went rogue. At least that's what I think was going on: between her diction and an incoherent script, it's a bit hard to tell what's happening with any degree of precision. She says she's been hiding out ""up in the mountains"" and that a CIA boss named Arthur Jameson (creepy, tattooed Jack Bannon) is the man who killed Lupe and tried to kill Frank. The raw emotion she displays when this is revealed must be seen to be believed!

This whole thing boils down to a CD-ROM that Jameson wants, as it contains information that can indict him, and which a mysterious man named China (Michael Nouri) furnishes to Frank, getting blown up in the process (don't miss the riveting monologue about playing gin rummy with Jimmy Hoffa). China advises Frank to go to the FBI, because they hate the CIA more than they hate organized crime, and with that established Colette has to jump back in the shower. Of course Frank and Colette fall for each other in a truly loathsome display. Travolta, the old goat, doublecrosses Colette and takes the disc in the middle of the night, and Colette calls Jameson in a fit of pique. After Philly Bambino gets a well-deserved Thai gasoline massage (I am not joking), a showdown is arranged between the CIA and the mob. Question: why does nobody think to burn a copy of the CD? Wouldn't that make it less worth dying for?

There is a plot twist at the end that is not totally unsurprising, so for that it gets originality points over ""Skyscraper,"" but it's just a ruse to initiate more gunplay. Just when you suspected the film could get no stupider, you will be proven wrong in a massive way: there's a hostage exchange to perform on the Hoover Dam! The swap is simple: the CD for a mobster. (Again, people, burn a copy of the CD! Hello?) The scene which follows is entirely responsible for my two star rating of this DVD set, as in most other ways ""To The Limit"" is inferior to even ""Skyscraper."" The scene that sealed the deal for me was the hostage exchange, specifically, when Frank hands Colette the CD and she hurls it like a throwing star, embedding it deep in Jameson's skull, causing him to fall over Hoover Dam to his death. That is a priceless moment of cinematic cheese, and my only regret is that to get to it you have to suffer through 89 minutes of truly lamentable filmmaking first.",1267056000,3,8622,4.758021390374331

I write this assuming you have seen ""Die Hard"".

First, apart from the gratuitous scenes of sex and nudity, the crew here attempted to duplicate every scene from ""Die Hard"".  The way they were done was either absurd, ridiculous, or just stupid.

Second...the acting!  Much has been said about Smith's atrocious acting (if you could call it acting at all).  However, all of the actors were lousy.  Phony European accents.  Male models trying to masquerade as terrorists.  The alleged `criminal mastermind' quoting Shakespeare, in a pathetic attempt to appear sophisticated.  Poor delivery of lines.  Plain unlikable characters in general. etc.

Third, the way this ""takeover"" was carried out seemed implausible.  If you bother to watch this mess, consider how `believable' it was in ""Die Hard"", and how `unbelievable' it is in this junk.  Shootouts

Fourth, clichs...so many clichs.  If you bother to watch them, they will become extremely obvious.  Especially the concept of the `double cross'.

Fifth...continuity.  I guess with a movie with no budget, things like continuity will go by the waste side.

Finally... the gratuitous sex and nudity.  With a low-budget, direct-to-video piece of swine like this with Anna Nicole, this element had to exist, even though the scenes did not improve the so-called story.  This had to be done obviously to captivate the men.  It didn't work for me.

The cast and crew behind the original ""Die Hard"" should be appalled at this.  I found this movie an utter insult to the cast and crew that made the original DH so great.  This movie should have never been made.  It should be burnt.",1155081600,,1861,4.859424920127796

778582,1,6304087578,"I don't actually own this DVD. A friend and me were in the video store, in search for the lamest movie the store had to offer. Some movies can suck so much that they are actually enjoyable to watch. We stumbled across Skyscraper, a true masterpiece in movie dullness. What convinced us? Well, that has to have been Anna Nicole Smith's resume. Is read as follows:

*Playmate of the year 1993
*Sex diva beyond comparison
*Married to an ancient billionaire - widow short after the wedding
*H&M Lingerie model
*Possibly the least talented actress in the world.

This movie is positively the lamest, most boring, worst scripted, worst acted, badly paced movie ever made in the 90s. Words can't describe how much this movie sucks. We were in the mood for something really cheap to diss the hell out of, to really have a huge laugh at. This movie didn't even manage that! Anna Nicole Smith's acting is absolutely non-existent. As soon as she opens her mouth you can tell she is reading off a script board that someone is holding up behind the camera. She can't even move, walk or run without looking awkward and rehearsed. You can tell she is thinking really hard, conscious of every move she makes. You really start feeling sorry for the poor chick. This entire movie has to be a joke - on her! And not even her overly exploited boobs save this movie, because there is a great chance you've already turned it off before that first practically-soft core-porn scene unfolds on the screen. Stay as far away from this movie as you possibly can.",1117152000,5,1534,4.615384615384615
778583,5,6304087578,"Skyscraper is a movie starring Anna Nicole Smith, and it co-stars her breasts.  I must say that Ms. Smith should be jealous of her co-stars, as they get all of the good scenes, while sadly she must stand behind them and deliver her lines in a kind of stuper.  Also the movie has a great villain, in the part of Zorkov, I think, who pummels every line he delivers like a blow to the skull...""CIAO BELLO!!!"" When Carrie the helicopter pilot is in the helicopter, look close as you can see the REAL pilots shoulder in some scenes when she is suppose to be alone.  Anyway, it's been a while since I have seen this movie, but I do remember the strong parts, that is: lots or running, lots of screaming, tons of shooting, and of course, Anna Nicole Smiths huge naked breasts.",1107993600,2,769,4.363636363636363
778584,1,6304087578,"SKYSCRAPER is in one word, awful.  Anna Nicole Smith wouldn't know how to act, and once you've seen her watermelons once, they're not all that attractive.  The two love scenes with the wimpy background songs are some of the worst ever put on celluloid.  The acting is all around atrocious, especially Charles Hubere in the role of Fairfax, the Shakespeare spouting rastaman.  When Anna spouts off to her cop husband, that she wants a baby, you just wanna stick a binkie in her mouth, but not one as big as hers or she'd gag.

Which is just what one must do to survive this horrifying cinematic waste!",1096848000,4,600,4.570093457943925
778585,2,6304087578,"In Anna's final movie (why?), she plays Carrie the helicopter pilot with fake fingernails.  ""Skyscraper"" (1997) is directed by the same genius who brought us Anna's other blockbuster -1995's ""To The Limit"".  Both movies are similar(wow, really?) in that Anna uses a gun, she gets naked a few times, and attempts to act too much.  Oh yeah, there's also a really evil guy and a lot of explosions. If I must choose between the two for entertainment value, I'm going with Skyscraper.  Not only does Anna have more nude scenes in this one, her acting (and everyone elses) is even more hilarious (if you actually watch it with sound!).  Also there aren't as many long stretches of ""acting"" and ""explosions"".  Bottom line, a laughably bad acted movie with breasts, guns, and things exploding.

An Anna DOuble feature on one DVD? I'm in heaven! Why Anna isn't making more movies is beyond me. Every red blooded American man should stand up and shout ""I love Anna! She's the American man's Dream!!!"" Do it now!
Her acting is as professional as Bette Davis or Audrey Hepburn could ever hope to be. The range of emotions she can display makes you aware that she was born to be an actress and show her talent to the fullest.
Long Live Anna, she makes American cinema great!",1030406400,12,644,4.375

7861382,3,6304087578,"It was a different world in 1996. My bus driver listened to Jewel and Donna Lewis on her AM/FM radio while hauling us to school.
I remember Entertainment Tonight hyping up Skyscraper(1996), a Die Hard clone starring the late Anna Nicole Smith. Smith was cast as Carrie Wink in the film. She finds out that terrorists from South Africa are taking people hostage in a high rise. Anna Nicole Smith was a super model in those days. She was famous for being famous. Smith lived life in the fast lane. She had a lousy reality show. She had a part as a femme fatale in Naked Gun 33 1/3(1994). She passed away in early 2007. For a B-movie, Skyscraper has some suspense and some real, quality pyrotechnics. There is no computer generated imagery in the film. Today's B and Z grade movies are willing to use CGI. There is a gratuitous sex scene early in the film; we get to see Smith nude in the shower. Anna Nicole Smith was a ""skyscraper"". Smith's real life son played a hostage in the film. Skyscraper was a guilty pleasure from the mid-1990's.  Rest in peace, Anna Nicole.",1523232000,,1066,4.466666666666667

7861389,5,6304087578,"SKYSCRAPER (1996) stars the incredible, astonishing phenomenon known as Anna Nicole Smith! This time out, she and her 3-inch nails are helicopter pilot Carrie Wisk. When she drops off a mystery man w/ a briefcase, we know there's going to be trouble! Said mystery man meets w/ government agents. We know their government agents, because they all wear sunglasses. Oh no! A group of terrorist-types opens fire, ruining the meeting! This group fires rockets too, and includes a long-haired muscleman from a romance novel! With a gun! In a vest! Many explosions later, the briefcase guy runs into a nearby building, and is killed by an annoying man, waxing Shakespearean. Meanwhile, across town, Carrie takes a slow-motion shower! Yikes! Her cop boyfriend arrives, and... well, you get the picture! Several Anna Nicole grimaces later, and Carrie is back in the air. Oh dear! she's called to pick up that annoying, Shakespeare-spouting lunatic! We know he's a lunatic, because he quotes Shakespeare. And likes it! Oh my gracious! Carrie has no idea what these people are up to, as she transports them around LA! Everything winds up at the Zitex building. We know this because the name Zitex is plastered everywhere! Mr. Shakespeare's thugs show up, and start killing people. Oh fudge! Carrie has to use the phone, due to an antenna malfunction! The thugs take over the building, even the electronics! Yep, you guessed it! It's DIE HARD w/ Anna Nicole Smith as Bruce Willis! How could this possibly fail? Under extreme stress, Carrie must stay one step ahead of these misbehaving miscreants! She must use her wits to outwit her witty adversaries! watch as she swings on a cable like Spiderman, only to crash through a window! Yep, it's the fire hose scene from that OTHER high-rise, action movie. Thankfully, there's hairy muscleman, and loads of karate! And explosions! I admit to liking Ms. Smith far more here, than in TO THE LIMIT, as she appears to have a functioning brain in this movie. Besides, whenever things get a bit dull, or overly idiotic, she sheds her clothes, and all is forgiven! The terrorists are a laugh-out-loud riot, as they act ""sadistic"" and ""psycho""! They must have trained all their lives for these roles! SKYSCRAPER proves my theory that god loves cheeeze and schlock, and has vowed to keep them holy! A true religious experience!...  EXTRA POINTS- For all of the hilariously shameless DIE HARD lifts!... BONUS- For anyone who can figure out why they allowed Carrie's cop boyfriend to run around w/ his crotch ripped open, during the final part of the movie (???)...  EXTRA BONUS- For spotting that the pants are back together at the end, but now they're wet!...",1504569600,3,2684,4.922737306843267
