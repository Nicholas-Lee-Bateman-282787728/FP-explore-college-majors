Today's ""something"" is a movie about a bicycle journey that three young men took across the United States to raise money for two causes - the American Diabetes Association and the Kupenda foundation for disabled children in Kenya.
..... Feeling glum? The world too much with you? Financial crisis got you down? One antidote is to check out the Web sites of the American Diabetes Association, [...] and Kupenda, [...] Another suggestion is to watch this movie bursting with passion.",1237680000,,742,5.040650406504065
8334873,5,B001PYQKRC,"I bought this movie as a lover of biking, but wasn't at all sure what to expect.  Turned out to be a wonderful movie... much more than a great biking adventure (which it is too!).  Highly likable guys, funny, touching, self-effacing, competitive and inspirational.  It's the sort of movie that should appeal to the best in all of us.",1236297600,2,333,4.610169491525424
8334874,5,B001PYQKRC,"What an adventure!  This documentary is so inspiring! After watching the movie, I was inspired to do more with my life and make a difference.  3 guys who ride cross country on a fixed gear bikes is truly inspiring, but the real inspiration is that they do it not for themselves, but for a truly worthy cause.  They are trying to raise awareness and money for diabetes.  The best part of the movie is how Adam, who has diabetes, shows that he can do ANYTHING despite having the disease.  He especially inspires children!  The movie is fun and entertaining!  It  will make you laugh and cry!  Don't miss this because it is so worth watching.",1236297600,2,639,4.48695652173913
8334875,5,B001PYQKRC,"This documentary is truly inspirational!  The film tells a story of passion, dedication and work ethic towards finding a cure for diabetes.

I recommend this product to anyone who wants to be motivated and inspired!",1236038400,2,328,4.821428571428571
8334876,5,B001PYQKRC,"This is an amazing documentary!!  The three guys in this film are a true inspiration!  Riding across the country on a single-speed, fixed gear bike is not an easy task!  The scenery was ABSOLUTELY breathtaking and for one who knows about type 1 diabetes, this is especially incredible! This film shows with teamwork, true friendship, a positive attitude, and sheer determination, one can accomplish anything.  Adam is to especially be admired and is great role model for those with diabetes and for those without!  This documentary will inspire you, make you laugh, and much more. This is a must see!!!",1235865600,2,602,4.98
8334877,5,B001PYQKRC,"A group of guys cycling cross country for a cause: could this be fun? Well, yes!  Single-speed, fixed gear bikes means cycling up and well as down mountains, fending off dogs, and camping if needed, even in a barn..Well, yes! and the scenery is awesome! Mountains (even billy goats), streams, woods, and folks along the way make for an interesting adventure. Did I mention singing in a bar in every state was a key ingedient? What is the cause? and who are these guys and their dedicated crew? The guys are all from Maryland, went to UMBC and are IT types, they are showing that having fun and exercise, even if you are a diabetic, can work -- and helping others understand these issues can be part of the mix.  It is a WONDERFUL and FUN story! Buy it and watch it!
