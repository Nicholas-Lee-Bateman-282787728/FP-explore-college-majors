8035933,1,B0003C0140,"Do not buy this video if you want to really see what happened during the gymnastics competition in Atlanta.  This video features a very brief review of the competition, with NO full routines or original commentary.  Instead you get a poorly put together ""fluff"" piece of the events.  Fancy music plays over the spliced together routines and some random guy talks about the competition. I have the original broadcast of the gymnastics events from Atlanta and this doesn't even come close.",1096502400,47,487,4.987654320987654
