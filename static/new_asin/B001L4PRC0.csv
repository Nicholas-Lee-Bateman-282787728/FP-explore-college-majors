5859290,2,B001L4PRC0,"This was awful, caters were stiff, camera work was terrible and the storyline was handled poorly. Would not watch another.",1439856000,5,122,5.15
5859291,2,B001L4PRC0,I thought this was too mature for my 7-year-old granddaughter and I thought the production was tacky (low budget?).,1439596800,8,115,5.105263157894737
5859292,5,B001L4PRC0,I really enjoyed the appropriateness and content in this DVD. Highly recommended for middle school and maybe 5 th grade.,1439510400,3,120,5.05
5859293,5,B001L4PRC0,"soo good! it's amazing if you're into mysteries, Nancy Drew type of thing. This episode is super creepy and probably better for teens unless your kids are actually trying to date/flight online. If they are just getting to that age it's an awesome film you HAVE to show them!!",1425945600,3,275,4.63265306122449

8598215,5,B001L4PRC0,"I love Adina's Deck!! It's really good, and I love mysteries like the Nancy Drew books. I saw one viewers review and I don't agree with the ""it should be for 5th graders and older."" thing because I'm a 9 year old 4th grader.",1517270400,2,224,4.113636363636363

8598218,5,B001L4PRC0,Perfect for middle school kids! I showed this to some family friends who were in 7th and 8th grade at the time. They were able to relate to the subject matter and it made for good conversation after the episodes were done. Highly recommend this to parents out there who want to start a conversation about tricky subject matter.,1442102400,3,327,4.559322033898305
8598219,5,B001L4PRC0,"Timely and appropriate for tweens and teens (13+). This series captures real life situations of kids today. Important lessons learned, and the fact that everything isn't wrapped in a pretty bow at the end even makes it more realistic. The content is not appropriate for small children.",1441843200,4,285,5.085106382978723
8598220,5,B001L4PRC0,"You have to give the show credit for opening up the conversation - kids, chat rooms and staying safe. About 8 minutes into the show it really starts to get interesting, using technology and staying entertaining. Yes some of the shots seem a bit low budget, but the lesson is there. Since most apps/online games have chat rooms that adults do not think to check it's important to show kids what they ""say"" online can have scary consequences in real life.",1441756800,4,453,4.604938271604938

8598222,5,B001L4PRC0,"Every middle school child should view these excellently written and produced series of cyber bullying and the horrific effects they have on people in general.  I wish the series had been available when I taught school because I think that every one of my students, even the ones who would never bully, would benefit from the content of this series.  Bravo to the producers for creating such an important series of videos.",1440979200,3,421,4.833333333333333
8598223,5,B001L4PRC0,"I used this DVD in my class made up of exceptional Ed students aged 8-15. Many of my students make poor choices in social situations, especially on line. We watched all three dvds in the series and great discussions followed. the characters were relatable and the story lines kept a my students' attention. After the third dvd in the series, my students felt like they knew the main characters and were upset to find that only three shows have been made so far. My students actually wrote to the producers requesting more shows be added to the series, and that was a lesson in itself.  Adina's Deck tackled the problems of youth with characters and story lines that held the interest of all my varied exceptionality students.",1440892800,3,725,4.708661417322834

Adidas Deck illustrates the point of view of cyber bullying and it's ill effects. The video demonstrates the understanding of this complex problem and presents a video in a smart, mature, and safe way for youngsters to watch.
