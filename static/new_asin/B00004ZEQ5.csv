7928553,5,B00004ZEQ5,"I really liked this film. It showcased 4 different castles, Huntington Castle, Castle Leslie, Glin Castle and Leap Castle. The host visited all 4 castles and spoke to their present owners and caretakers, filming the exterior and some of the interior of each. They combined historical fact and legend with present day events and reenact the supernatural occurrences. It's more entertaining than a ""ghost hunting"" show and I found it very informative and on point with what I've read about the 4 castles and there were a few details in some of the stories that I hadn't heard before. It was filmed nicely with beautiful Irish scenery in between stories. Someone mentioned that the cover is Castle Matrix. I don't think so. I don't know what part of the castle looks like that. It looks more like it's a computer generated image possibly using some of Castle Matrix's crenelations.",1331856000,,878,4.899328859060403
7928554,5,B00004ZEQ5,"I've seen this movie ( and also castle ghosts of England, scotland and Wales..) I think those are really a very good ones. I really enjoyed it. Each castle has a dramatic, overwhelming story to tell, and you will feel the phantasmal, chilling atmosphere of a ghost story that sourrounds you as if you were there,walking trough long, damp corridors, dark corners among ethereal beings and freaky things. Leap Castle has a specialy dreadful and evil ambiance and a bloody, violent history. It is almost a . graphic narration, you can see a very well performed reenactements, and a very professional story teller",1103587200,5,609,4.922330097087379
7928555,1,B00004ZEQ5,"I have just finished watching the video, Castle Ghosts of Ireland. I have visited Ireland several times, I was excited about the chance to see video footage of the castles listed on the cover and hear about some of the tales associated with them.  What I purchased was a low grade rendition of late night TV.  It was so boring and poorly done that family members wanted me to fast forward on the first viewing.  Almost nothing is shown of the castles and the stories are told in a ""you are there"" acting style.  You are warned at the beginning that you are about to view things that will frighten you.  The only thing frightening was that I paid for this worthless account.
One of the biggest disappointments is that Castle Matrix is not even included in the video, but is advertised on the cover.  This lovely place is the main reason for my purchase of the video.  I will warn you, however, that you will see little, if any, footage of any of the castles, save for a few long distance post card shots and some staged drama scenes.
You would be better off putting your money away and saving for a trip to Ireland.  This is the first time ever that I will try and get a refund on a purchased video.",1041206400,7,1198,4.316964285714286
