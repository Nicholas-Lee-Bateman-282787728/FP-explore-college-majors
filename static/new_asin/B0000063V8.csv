7903629,5,B0000063V8,"My grandson gives it 8 stars!  He wants to watch it every time he visits---we limit him to once a day, though. Brett says he especially likes the trolleys! And, it came with trading cards which my nephew Doug really enjoyed.",1216944000,3,224,4.463414634146342
7903630,5,B0000063V8,"These videos are really cool! My eight year old used to watch them multiple times a day and now my 2 year old does the same. They have watched the movies so many times, they have worn them out! (Ijust bought a new set.) The music is a little annoying after the fifth time in a row but both my boys dance(d) to it. They are the perfect length for getting the dishes done or starting the laundry. I highly reccomend these movies for any young toddler that loves trains. Also, the ""Awesome Construction"" movies are great too!",1076198400,6,522,4.336734693877551
