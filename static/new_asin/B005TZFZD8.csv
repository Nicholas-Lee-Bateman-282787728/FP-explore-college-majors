I recommend this to all.  We need to know anything we can about our wars.  Viewing this gives you a glimpse into why our warriors are returning with health issues (mental and physical), potential problems assimilating back into society, bravery, etc.  If you know someone who went overseas in these wars, view these.

4892779,4,B005TZFZD8,I was going to give it lesser stars but felt it was unjust as I just didn't get into the movie.  I expected something different and grew tired of the main fella toting the gun around in civilian life.,1393372800,,200,4.128205128205129
4892780,4,B005TZFZD8,"The other day I watched the Academy Award nominated 2011 documentary Hell and Back Again. The film was directed by Danfung Dennis and follows a soldier in Afghanistan who is severely wounded in battle and then has to reintegrate to civilian life.

Dennis does an amazing job of capturing incredible and shocking footage from his time as an embedded reporter, and then weaving it into a story that feels more like a traditional drama than a documentary. As I watched the film I reflected on how much it felt like The Hurt Locker, a drama made with the riveting intensity of a documentary.

In some respects I suspect it is Dennis very success at making this such a seamless film that kept me at an emotional distance from it. The footage was so well done, and so expertly edited into the storyline of one soldiers difficult reintegration into society, that it didn't feel as real as it was.

But I suspect there was a deeper problem that kept me from identifying more closely with the film. To put it bluntly, Ive simply reached my saturation point for watching war documentaries, particularly those centered on Afghanistan and Iraq. Ive watched Iraq in Fragments, Gunner Palace, Body of War (which I reviewed here), Control Room, Taxi to the Dark Side (my personal favorite), and several more besides. Every one of those documentaries was good, and some of them were great. But there are only so many documentaries one can watch.

I also find myself somewhat conflicted about war documentaries. In my cynical moments I feel almost that wars are undertaken so that documentaries can be made about them. The documentaries help us channel our national pride, our rage, our dissatisfaction with the state of the world. They also provide first rate source material for those interested in making documentaries.

In one scene the soldier rolls into Walmart in a wheelchair. He then begins to describe his injuries to a kindly Walmart greeter. Afterwards she asks if she can give him a hug. In one sense it is an emotionally evolving scene. Like others in the audience, I feel the impulse to line up behind that greeter to give the hero an appreciative hug for acts of bravery and valor.

And yet at the same time I find myself reacting negatively to the scene. It feels like a trope. Ive witnessed it before in other documentaries, in countless public interest stories in the news, in national holiday events, and in the iconic images of war like the flag raising on Mt. Suribachi. In that moment the documentary which, in its best moments is supposed to be subversive of war-mongering, becomes but one more voice in the ceaseless cacophany.

And then I worry. Are there aimless youth out there searching for emotional depth and meaning who can be moved by this scene and end up themselves as sacrifices for the irresponsible foreign policy decisions of bureaucrats driven by various vested interests? In other words, to what extent does a fiercely emotional documentary like this become part of the problem?

While it undoubtedly is fiercely emotional for some viewers, even as I finished the film I found its overly familiar images slipping away, merging into the blur of iconic images drawn from other dusty middle east war documentaries. It would seem that like the hard baked earth of a dusty road in Iraq, Ive been over exposed, my emotions spent.

Whether or not society has seen enough war documentaries, I don't know. But I know that I have.

4892783,5,B005TZFZD8,"This documentary is truly eye-opening and insightful. First of all, it is one of few films that demonstrates the day to day activities and stresses of our soldiers on the frontline. More importantly, it shows in detail the new types of stresses and sense of isolation a veteran faces at home. It also shows how stressful the whole ordeal is for the spouse. I felt sorry but also afraid of the main character as he continues drown in despair. The fact that  he plays Russian roulette ""jokingly"" is indicative of how much pain he is in.

As an aside, when the names and places of origin of the soldiers KIA, we should hold the politicians accountable about the fact their sons do not participate. George W Bush is well known for dodging his responsibility during the Vietnam war. Obama is equally hypocritical in that he was elected by promising that he would end the war in Afganistan, but once in office, escalated the war. FUBAR.",1380672000,,930,4.63030303030303

4892806,2,B005TZFZD8,"Sergeant Nathan Harris led his men into battle in southern Afghanistan, and returned a wounded veteran.  This film, Hell And Back Again, keeps transitioning between Harris in the scarred farmlands of Afghasistan and back home with his wife, his doctors, and his pistols.

The fighting scenes are harrowing... you never see your enemy, but you certainly know they are there when the bullets begin to fly.  It's tough duty, and the ""fog of war"" makes it difficult to see that the training these fighting men received was up for the task.  As far as Harris at home?  He doesn't come off as educated, or particularly well-trained.  He expresses love for his pistols, and plays with them at home, seemingly worried that upon his return, there are bad guys on the other side of the door.  And the movie ends with him still needing at least 6 more months of rehabilitation  This is why the story seems untold.  What happens to Harris AFTER he recovers?  Does he go back to active duty in the Marines?  Does he adapt to civilian life?  Does his wife stick it out with him?  What?

The ending, perhaps like life, is too abrupt..",1368921600,,1119,4.614213197969543

4892808,3,B005TZFZD8,"It is was hard for me to give this even 3 stars. I did so, because of the heart-wrench I experience watching this. Sgt. Harris could have well been me in a different era. I came so close, so too many times.

Everyone who gave this better than 3 stars, please give serious consideration to the following:

""I believe that if we had and would keep our dirty, bloody, dollar-soaked fingers out of the business of these nations so full of depressed, exploited people, they will arrive at a solution of their own--and if unfortunately their revolution must be of the violent type because the ""haves"" refuse to share with the ""have-nots"" by any peaceful method, at least what they get will be their own, and not the American style, which they don't want and above all don't want crammed down their throats by Americans.""
-- General David Monroe Shoup, 22nd Commandant of the Marine Corps (1960-1963), Medal of Honor: Colonel, U.S. Marine Corps, commanding officer of all Marine Corps troops on Betio Island, Tarawa Atoll, and Gilbert Islands, from 20 to November 22, 1943, from speech delivered to community college students at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, California for their World Affairs Day, 14 May 1966.

Then please I wish you to make note of Gen. Shoup's commanding officer, while he was a young lieutenant, while on duty in China, Major General Smedley D. Butler. Gen. Butler wrote a very short pamphlet in 1935. It was called ""War is a Racket."" Shoup, in quoting the above in '66, was simply paraphrasing Butler.

Shoup was making direct reference to Vietnam. Butler made reference to particularly WWI, but also all conflicts prior, those conflicts post WWI, and those conflicts to come. They are ALL (will be) perpetrated by the very same people. And they are not the VC/NVA or the Taliban. I'm afraid most here, don't even have a clue as to who and what Al Qaeda is.

If any of you are veterans, as am I (USMC 1980-1986), then you need to make Veterans Today a daily reading stop. Even if you are not a veteran here, then Veterans Today is worth your time and energies. You will get news here, you will not get anywhere else. Get yourself educated about war and global politics. The senior managing editor at Veterans Today, is Gordon Duff. USMC combat veteran, Vietnam, sniper.

My heart goes out to Sgt. Harris and his wife. I sat in those very same chairs, in the MCB, Camp Lejeune Theater. I walked those very same halls of the Naval Medical Center, when it was freshly constructed. A brand new facility in the 80s. Its first combat casualties, those from Beirut. I was a different era. Before kevlar helmets, M16A4s, and Humvees. Still, a Marine.

It is very unfortunate, that Sgt. Harris and his wife, and those Marines associated with Harris, have no clue as to why Sgt. Harris must suffer his plight. It is sad, that apparently the Chaplain has no clue, as to why he had to preside over the memorial of those thirteen KIAs. This must stop. This must stop NOW!",1367107200,3,2978,4.650190114068441
4892809,5,B005TZFZD8,"Although I have mixed opinions regarding US Military spending/foreign involvement our veterans DESERVE love, respect, and the resources needed to help them reenter their civilian lives, post service.  This film exposes the trials of what I can only imagine many of our troops endure during and after war exposure and I applaud the filming quality, domestic and abroad, which makes this film wonderful.

4892810,5,B005TZFZD8,"All I can say is this documentary hit me to the core. My heart ached for Sgt Harris and what he went through from being in the war in charge of troops during an active combat situation to being back home, severely injured and trying to recover so he could go back.  The reality of not being able to return to being a Grunt hit him so hard and the way this documentary was filmed, made you feel his pain and disappointment.

I admire all that our troops do and to see what they endure in these horrible battles, just makes you appreciate what they do so much more.  When they are injured and return home, my heart just goes out to them and their families.  Mrs. Harris did her best to handle the pain her husband endured and I believe she was just as courageous for dealing with that and his fascination for his handguns.

I'm very pleased that documentaries, like this and others along with movies on the two wars, are coming out so American's can appreciate these young warriors so much more.  Most of these guys are just barely out of their teens and have to endure so much.  My brother had to have my parents sign for him to join the Army when he was 17 so he could go to Vietnam.  The stories he told us were so frightening and to see these films just confirms how terrifying it must me.

No wonder there is so much PTSD in this country.  I just pray the VA and hospitals can get on board faster and deal with this growing tragedy in our wonderful youth and brave soldiers.  There are just too many suicides occurring from these brave warriors and we need to nip it in the bud now.

4892812,4,B005TZFZD8,Compelling real life war doc with intense action footage of firefights. I was right there in battle with the soldiers.,1364083200,,118,4.95
4892813,3,B005TZFZD8,"I couldn't tell if the young US Marine Nathan Harris suffers from PTSD or had developed an addiction to the cocktail of pills which was making him behave erratically. In the end, what I ultimately took away from this documentary is Nathan has a sore hip, he sometimes argues with his wife, he likes to play with handguns during the most inappropriate situations, plays video games, and he takes a lot of pills. So in a lot of ways he's a totally normal twenty-something American male.

The documentary jumps back and forth between his third and final combat deployment as a US Marine, the latter footage being about 85% talking/negotiating with Afghan men and 15% actual footage of his platoon in contact with pro-taliban fighters.

Back home, we'll see Nathan struggle with hip/leg pain and civilian re-integration as he laments about how a Wal-Mart without vacant parking spaces is more stressful to deal with than being in combat, or how ordering fast food through the drive-thru is an ordeal. Perhaps he's claustrophobic or just rocked out of his gourd on pain pills, but there's a lot of footage of him burying his face in his hands seemingly freaking the *&%^ out.

It seems like the filmmaker thought these scenes of him losing his cool about totally mundane activities might make it hard for the audience to relate with his mental state, so the decisions was made to include an excessive amount of footage of a visibly semi-sedated Nathan handling loaded handguns around his visibly nervous wife. In bed. Or just while hanging out on the couch. You know, perfect moments to whip out a handgun and play with it. Doesn't the USMC teach you something about how one gun is for fighting and one is for fun?Watching these moments made me feel as uncomfortable as his wife.

The problem with the footage of him being back home with his wife is the viewer has no concept of the passage of time. The viewer won't know how long he's been back or how long it's been since he'd been shot. The whole time I was wondering if his wound was really that crippling in the long term, or if he was in all that constant pain because he'd just been shot 2 weeks ago and he's still recovering from complicated surgery. I got no sense of the severity of the wound over time other than he might walk with a limp for a while, and certainly his days as a grunt are over. Will he walk with a cane his whole life? Or will he be back to normal in a couple years with physical therapy? The film would have you believe the former but I'm dubious.

When you finally start to establish a timeline you are jarringly taken back to deployment footage, which feels like it is going to culminate in showing you, from his first person camera or the camera of another, the moment he takes that devastating bullet to the hip, but it never does. You just see some blurry footage of somebody on a litter being loaded into a medevac helo, who may or may not be Nathan. It's frustrating.

Still, I found in Hell and Back Again interesting simply because Nathan seems like genuinely good guy with a good sense of humor and a heart of gold, so I was sympathetic toward him almost immediately. I didn't find the ""flashbacks"" to Afghanistan boring like other reviewers did. Deployments aren't 100% firefights, there's a lot of relationship building with the locals, and the footage shows just that.",1362960000,3,3356,4.585

I realize that war films do not always ""sell"" well in main stream theaters, but this is a film that truly speaks to the real world that the men and women that have served in Iraq and Afghanistan have faced, and are facing.

This is a highly recommended film for anyone wanting to understand the journey that these true soldier heros must take.  Not a film you will soon forget.

4892822,5,B005TZFZD8,"""Hell and Back Again"" is an outstanding documentary that really should have won the Oscar it was nominated for. The story of Sergeant Nathan Harris, a young Marine badly wounded in Afghanistan while serving his country, could not have been told any better. Two things that stand out about this film are how carefully it was filmed and how the filmmakers resisted the urge to make any political statements whatsoever: This is Nathan Harris' story and the spotlight is on him. The editing is perfect and the music in the film enhances it as well.

Sadly, Nathan Harris is severely wounded by Taliban machine gun fire just days before his third deployment in Afghanistan was to end--he would have come home again safely to his wife Ashley and their friends and family. But life can be so cruel--he is badly shot through the hip and the bullet rips through his leg. Although Nathan survives we see him having to go through rigorous and painful physical therapy and meeting quite a few doctors routinely to manage his chronic pain and to rehabilitate him. I cheered for Nathan when he started using a cane instead of a walker; that how close I felt to him because director Danfung Dennis and the crew did such a fine job making this film!

We also see Nathan reuniting with his war buddies back stateside; and there's an emotional meeting of so many family members who have lost a relative in the fighting overseas. In addition, I was interested to see how soldiers tried to work as diplomatically as possible with local area residents whose lives are incredibly disrupted by the violence. Although I don't want to give too much more away for fear of spoiling it for you, suffice it to say I think you'll be as captivated by Nathan's story as I was.

The DVD comes with a few extras; and all of them are good. I particularly liked the deleted scenes and the extra about how the movie was filmed.

Overall, ""Hell and Back Again"" gives us quite a rare opportunity to see for ourselves just what modern warfare is like in a most dangerous zone of the world. I highly recommend this film for people interested in the war in Afghanistan; the everyday experiences of modern-day soldiers fighting overseas; and gritty social and cultural documentaries. In fact, people who appreciate five star documentaries in general will not be disappointed.",1340236800,3,2332,4.722358722358722

4892838,5,B005TZFZD8,"It used to be that the camera was considered the enemy of war.  The Tet Offense was shown on the network news and has often been cited as the dealbreaker for The Vietnam War.  Now it all depends where and how you aim and shoot, but with a video camera and some skillful editing, you can make some intimate and informative war films.  Of course today's support for the soldier has increased, but point-of-view has become essential in how one perceives any modern campaign.

Such is the case for 'Hell and Back Again,' an honest portrait of gung-ho soldier Sergeant Nathan Harris, and a film which criss-crosses between serving the end of his third duty in Afghanistan and his homeridden rehabilitation from a wound he received just days before his last duty ended. At first we see him as an able commander, barking at and leading his troops through some harrowing campaigns as we see their counter insurgency increase the pressure on the Taliban.

At home Ashley, his wife, is supportive, and many of his fellow North Carolina residents receive him warmly.  Rehabilitation takes its toll in the Harris home as we see VA meetings, rehabilitation sessions, trips to Wal-Mart, stops for multiple prescriptions, and home scenes generously provided.  As we close in on the battles that led to his injury, the fallout of PTSD becomes more apparent. Even the rucuperating soldier admits that he prefers the rigors of Afghanistan over the little hassles that stress him out so keenly on the homefront.  A bullet hit him in the hip, rickocheted through his right leg, and left him unable to walk and in great pain.  In Afghanistan we seem him as a brave commander and the best of sometimes a bad lot at persuading Afghanistan citizens. (It becomes clear that soldiers increasingly have become diplomats, not an easy task as Afghanis sometimes view both the Taliban and United States as mutual enemies.) When we close in on the time of his war wounds, both parts of his story seem whole and complete.

'Hell and Back Again' is an unflinching look at a soldier's life both on and off the battlefield.  It is a step up from the admirable '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-War-Tapes/dp/B000O76ZOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The War Tapes</a>' with Iraqi veterans, Zack Bazzi and Steve Pink, because it is tighter, shows more explicitly the dangers at the front, and more tangibly illustrates the consequences of their sacrifices.  (It just amazes me how determined Sgt. Nathan Harris is to be rehabilitated, so he can serve on a fourth tour--probably no better able to do more than limp the rest of his life.)  As a worthy recent Oscar nominee, 'Hell and Back Again' is an illuminating film and shouldn't be ignored.",1332374400,13,2743,5.002197802197802

""Hell and Back Again""
----------------------------------------------------
This is a depressing though insightful documentary about America's distant war in Afghanistan and the real-life impact it's having on veterans as they come back home. The film focusses on Marine Sergeant Nathan Harris, a rough-hewn working-class guy who excelled as a combat soldier in a leadership position, but who was critically wounded in the hip and sent back to the States to recover. Back home, Harris and his wife Ashley struggle with his disabilities, both physical and psychological.  Initially he has trouble adapting to the placid, insulated world of shopping malls and fast food restaurants, which stands in bitter contrast to the flat, rocky farmland and crude clay huts his Marine unit patrolled in Taliban-occupied Afghanistan, where villagers were utterly untrustworthy and death lurked around every corner.

The reality-show aspects are uncomfortable: Sgt. Harris' recovery is slow and painful, and his wife's dismay grows as he becomes angrier and more withdrawn, and his dependence on painkillers begins to grow. He lurches around their house carrying a pistol, and recoils in agony as his physical therapy intensifies. These homefront scenes are interlaced with footage from the frontline, where Harris and his platoon search houses, interrogate and negotiate with tribal Afghanis, and fall into firefights at the drop of a dime. This is what counterinsurgency warfare really looks like: it's grubby and frustrating and a constant strain -- the discomfort we experience as viewers is nothing compared to what these guys go through for months on end. But back home, the skills that keep soldiers alive don't count for much, and it's all about paying rent, picking up prescriptions and seeing doctors, and Harris has a hard time adapting to the demands of polite society.

There's a lot of harrowing combat footage, but perhaps the most moving scene comes in a back-home memorial service for several fallen members of Harris' company. A soldier delivering the eulogy breaks down into tears and can't continue... and in the audience, dozens of big, tough Marines are crying, too. It's a powerful scene in a powerful, timely film, a thoughtful documentary that deserves the attention of the folks back home. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1330387200,3,2388,5.51912568306011
4892840,4,B005TZFZD8,"This is the story of a young man who was in the front lines with an embedded video journalist. The young man is charismatic. He seems levelheaded. That's why they'd made him a sergeant. Then he's seriously wounded on his right side. The journalist embeds himself in the young man's civilian life thereafter. The contrast of who this person is startling between him in uniform on a battlefield, and him in civilian cloths in a department store looking at the video games. While at times the movie was moving ""tediously"", as another reviewer rightly mentions, what's most startling to me is his explanation why he joined the marines: to kill.",1330128000,2,640,4.827272727272727
4892841,5,B005TZFZD8,"""Hell And Back Again"" is the real, bitter truth behind the glossy Marines commercials, the pompous imperial rhetoric of politicians and it serves as a counterweight to our culture of video game-minded ignorance about war and violence. With a brilliant narrative technique, director Dangfung Dennis follows the trials at home and on the field of Sgt. Nathan Harris, who is seriously wounded in Afghanistan and must adjust to a life of recovery and pain, added to his new struggle is the leftover bloodlust of a senseless conflict.

The film tells two parallel stories of the same man. Dennis intercuts between Harris's time in Afghanistan and his recovery period at home as he deals with medications, finding an appropriate house and realizing his days as a grunt are over. His wife Ashley stands by him the whole way, even enduring the ghosts of war stirring inside him. These are powerful moments in their simplicity, the whole Spartan image teenagers are fed on the TV ads and through neo-propaganda films like the recent ""Act Of Valor"" is stripped down to the bare reality: The average soldier is a working-class citizen, not a comic book character. Nathan Harris is the perfect embodiment of the modern American male in his mid-20s: Nice but a bit ignorant, we notice he has few interests aside from guns and video games, and as he explains, when he was a teenager he ""just wanted to kill people."" In that one sentence we see clearly what we're producing as a society: A mindless, aimless generation easily picked up by the war machine and sent to fight in a land they know nothing about. The scenes involving Harris dealing with his injury are harrowing and drive home the reality of being hit by a bullet, without having to say too much the film makes the point that the human body is fragile and when it is shattered the experience is life-altering.

Some of the documentary's most memorable moments take place in Afghanistan where we see Harris as a serious, focused Marine leading his men. But it's interesting to see such dedication in a combat zone where it's hard to see the point of waging the war itself. The classic scenarios in any foreign occupation are here as soldiers, including Harris, try to reason with an ancient people they know nothing about, trying in vain to justify their reasons for being in the country. There are moments where Afghan elders make it clear that they don't like either the Taliban or the US, but they also make it clear that it is the US military presence causing the most damage. We see Marines using vague rhetoric about bringing freedom from oppresson, but the Afghans simply want to live their lives and tend their land. It feels like you're watching Marines march through an alien world where they have no business meddling. It's another country with a compeletly different culture, who are we to tell them how they should live? This sort of question naturally presents itself as you see resources and men wasted on a futile mission.

""Hell And Back Again"" is filmed with great skill, the cinematography adds a cinematic scope to a very down to earth story. The editing is impressive in the way it links Harris's experiences at home and in Afghanistan, using sometimes great sound transitions to create an almost dreamlike effect. But in the end this film's real merit is in its powerful story and the way it serves as a document of one man's experience, but also as a document of where we are now as a people and country. Like Oliver Stone's ""Born On The Fourth Of July"" this is a film that uses the shattering of a man's physical being to say deeper, wider things about war and the misguided use of violence as idealism. ""Hell And Back Again"" is memorable and explores themes which will remain relevant as long as nations venture into unknown lands, creating more victims of history.",1330041600,11,3836,4.7395209580838324
4892842,5,B005TZFZD8,"I'm a big fan of documentary films and those that seem to deal with personal stories are usually my favorites.  This story takes on the parallel journey of a man going from war back to home.  It becomes apparent early on that each side of the story would play out side by side with the other.  Just as each segment begins to build we are taken over to the other, showing the similarities.  The journey of a soldier does not end when he returns home, as my grandfather could tell me.  Instead the journey goes from a physical struggle to a mental struggle.  What we see in this movie is that transition and how difficult it must be to try to adjust to war, then in turn try to adjust to home.  I was really emotionally spent after watching this and anyone that has any interest in stories dealing with veterans (young or old) should give this a shot.  I do recommend that you realize certain parts will be difficult to watch for some, but worthy of watching none the less.",1329350400,3,971,4.3259668508287294
4892843,4,B005TZFZD8,"This film was recently nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, so I had high hopes for it.  I was not disappointed.  The film primarily follows one soldier, and it cuts between his time in Afghanistan and his return home after he sustains an injury in combat.  Remarkably, even after his injury, this young man indicates that if possible he would love to return to the field and fight for his country again.

This documentary shows both the reality of war and the reality of a soldier's post-war life.  There are some clever editing and sound techniques used by the filmmakers to suggest what the young man is thinking at various points during the documentary, and these moments are very effective.  I would say that the film does not take sides politically, but that it presents an accurate depiction of war and allows the viewers to come to their conclusions - but the strong violence and disturbing imagery within the film obviously would lead most people to draw the conclusion that war should only be a last resort and should be avoided if at all possible.

As someone who is not very familiar with the military, I think it is important to see these types of documentaries from time to time.  It reminds us of the sacrifice that our troops make in the name of freedom.  It also gives us a more in-depth look at the situation, and goes far beyond what the traditional news media reports.  Watching the soldiers interact with the local people was one of the most fascinating aspects of the documentary.  These men face the difficult challenge of communicating with a population which does not speak English, and in most cases the locals do not want soldiers in their village.

I would recommend that you rent it first - for most, one viewing will be enough.  But you should definitely watch this film, it is a great experience.  If you do buy this blu-ray set, you also get a standard DVD of the film included as well.",1329091200,5,1942,4.623906705539358
4892844,4,B005TZFZD8,"""Hell and Back Again"" is raw, real and an eye-opener.

Danfung Dennis is a photojournalist who has captured the war on Afghanistan for a variety of major news publications, but having documented the war and risking his life to show how things were in the battlefield, Danfung also knew how some people have their lives changed after coming back.

Having shot so many photos, he wanted to bring out the emotion through video and this time using a Canon 5D Mark II camera, a 35mm and 50mm lens and a rig, Danfung Dennis joined the Marines of Echo Company 2nd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment and documented the battalion and the challenges they faced in Afghanistan (with actual footage of the soldiers dealing with civilians but also fighting against the Taliban and also taking care of soldiers who were injured in combat), but also the life of Sergeant Harris who was wounded and nearly bled to death, but was rescued and now having to deal with his injury.

But there is more to the story of ""Hell and Back Again"", as the soldiers face a war in the middle east, wounded soldiers, soldiers who finished their tour of service  are facing an upward battle with post-traumatic stress disorder.

""Hell and Back Again"" is a documentary which was well-received by film critics and was nominated for an Academy award for for ""Best Documentary Feature"".

With the permission of Sgt. Harris, Danfung Dennis was able to capture the life of Harris and his wife Ashley as he deals with his new life with new disability, medications that he is having to take to deal with the PTSD but also the challenges faced by his wife during this challenging time. But for this couple who have been together since their teens and now having to face a new life of uncertainty, the two take on their new life as they both have gone through hell and back again.

VIDEO:

""Hell and Back Again"" is a film that is rather intriguing because it is entirely shot on a Canon 5D Mark II.  Dennis was limited to the equipment he had while in Afghanistan but he made do with what equipment he had, including dealing with the camera's limitations as well.  Bare in mind, while in Afghanistan, the camera would overheat due to the 130 degree weather but needless to say, this is fearless guerrilla filmaking at its finest.  Working with what you have, no film crew, just you and limited equipment that would allow one to run with the soldiers, hide from being shot and if anything, being mobile yet capturing everything on camera, making sure the camera was stable and using a mic that would capture the dialogue.

With that being said, Danfung learned a lot about the camera's limitation and tried to work with it, while others, such as one scene where they are in the room starts to show some blurrying and softness, as well as some white pixelation issues, considering with the challenges that Danfung had in capturing the footage by himself, the film still looks quite impressive.  Not pristine, but still better than what I expected and I was very impressed with the final cut.

Just a sidenote that Dangfung Dennis goes into discussion about the gear used in a special feature and the audio commentary.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Hell and Back Again"" is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and yes, this film was shot on a Canon 5D Mark II camera but by no means does that mean this film doesn't sound great on lossless because not only was Danfung able to get clear audio among the soldiers but during battle, he caught the explosions and yes, you get a fair amount of LFE.

While this is mostly used during the Afghanistan scenes, still the dialogue is clear, even stateside during the scenes focusing on the Harris family.  Good dynamic range and for the most part, once again, I was quite impressed with the soundtrack because it was much more than I expected and that's a positive!

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Hell and Back Again"" comes with the following special features:

  Audio Commentary - Director Danfung Dennis and Editor, Fiona Otway talk about the film.  How he got away with shooting the Wal-Mart footage to answering the questions about when Sgt. Harris was holding his gun and the things he said while talking in his sleep and more.  A very good commentary although there were some areas with long stretches of silence.
  Technical Gear Demo - (5:46) Danfung Dennis talks about the gear used for the film and the challenges he had in the making of ""Hell and Back Again"".
  Willie Nelson's ""Hell and Back"" - (3:14) Willie Nelson's song used as a theme for the film.
  Did You Kill Anyone? - (7:09) A family liason coordinator talking to families about how they should deal with their children/husband/relative when it comes to the war or what happened, what to say and what not to say.
  Invisible Wounds - (4:14) A speech given to the Marines of Echo Company 2nd Battalion.
  Collateral Damage - (3:00) A scene featuring the Marines of Echo Company 2nd Battalion having a conversation.
  Blue Star Families PSA - (:33) A PSA for those who are injured in combat that there is an outreach group for vets who are suffering from physical and emotional problems.

JUDGMENT CALL:

With every war, there have been news and some type of media coverage about how soldiers have been affected by a war and some who have been deeply affected.

We know that there are soldiers who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder but while it's mentioned on the news or publications, sometimes to get a message out, people need to see things visually.

And this is where I feel that Danfung Dennis ha achieved efficacy with that message is through its participants and also the juxtaposition of real life video of the soldiers in combat.

""Hell and Back Again"" is risky filmmaking.  This is a one-man crew on the battlefield and with Danfung having shot the war, this time capturing the war through video and we see the raw emotions of soldiers in battle but also the emotions when one of their own is killed.

This film is not some banal Hollywood version of a war, we are seeing actual combat taking place, people dying and people reacting.

In the United States, we get to have this voyeuristic view of the Harris family and how things are not easy.  Sgt. Nathan Harris is on medication, is wounded and disabled and his wife, Ashley has to take care of him but also deal with these mood changes.

For a viewer, to see Sgt. Harris grab a pistol and aim it hold it around civilians is a scary situation.  Granted, we learn from the audio commentary that Harris is a person who loves guns but for anyone who doesn't possess one, just seeing how one can hold a pistol in bed or on a couch and casually hold it like someone holding a cup of coffee is quite alarming.

But we know that Sgt. Harris has gone through hell and back and for both he and Ashley, as well as other families around the United States, there are soldiers suffering.

And with recent news of a few soldiers actually losing it and causing harm to others, those not taking their medication or getting any help can be problematic.  We often read of family members of these people who lose it, talking about how their relative, their son, their father was not the same when they got back from the war and it has always been a contentious issue even in past wars of how much the government should help these soldiers who are suffering.  May it be PTSD or some chemical agent they caught in battle.

What ""Hell and Back Again"" is able to accomplish is giving the viewer a chance to see what was going on in Afghanistan but also a personal look of the difficulties that some soldiers and their families are facing.  But also to show that there are support groups out there who are ready to help these soldiers.

If anything, this film is an eye-opener but it also has an important message which I hope soldiers and their families will watch and see.  (note: This film is unrated but its important to let people know that this is not a documentary that young children should be watching due to the profanity and also injuries that were shown).

As for the Blu-ray release, as mentioned, it was pretty cool to see a film shot entirely on a Canon 5D Mark II but also to see the guerrilla (and very risky) filmmaking involved as it was a one-man crew as Danfung Dennis was the director and camera operator.  The picture quality was very good (but also showing the limitations of this full frame DSLR) but also featuring a lossless soundtrack which was much better than I was expecting.  Also, there are special features that were good and in-depth, especially the audio commentary and the technical gear featurette.

Overall, ""Hell and Back Again"" is a film that not many people can make.  The U.S. military doesn't usually allow people to go and document footage for a film, but in this case, Danfung Dennis has the experience of capturing images of war for news publications.  This time around, we get a first hand look of what he experienced with the Marines of Echo Company 2nd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment.

Also, not many military families will allow someone to come into their home and document their lives.  This took a lot of trust in the Harris family's part but they trusted in Danfung Dennis to show how post-traumatic stress disorder is affecting soldiers and the challenges that these two are facing but yet, two people who still love each other no matter what.

""Hell and Back Again"" is a raw, real and riveting documentary worth watching!

Definitely recommended!",1329004800,4,9492,4.628059701492537
4892845,5,B005TZFZD8,"'Hell and Back Again' will affect each viewer on an individual, very personal level. It's not a film that one would consider to be enjoyable or entertaining in the traditional sense, but it will be a film that you will be glad you watched. The story line is at times fascinating and educational, other times mundane and boring and still other times surprisingly insightful. Oddly enough what segments of the film you would designate to each of these three categories will vary largely dependent upon what you're looking for in a war story. Because the film moves back and forth from the Afghan battlefield to life back home in the USA the audiences personal preferences between these two aspects of the story will determine the rise and fall of ones interest level.

However what ties the film together is the interior processes operating within the soldier the film focuses on. His psychological journey is at the heart of 'Hell and Back Again'. It's not an easy journey and it's not always comfortable to watch. But it's an important journey and that's what ultimately holds the viewer to the end.",1328918400,,1099,4.814814814814815
4892856,4,B005TZFZD8,"Danfung Dennis has touchingly documented the high price our young Americans are paying in yet another war against us and the Western world- the fight against the Taliban- in his film Hell And Back Again. The film focuses on U.S. Marine Company Echo and what they had to face in southern Afghanistan in 2009. The main character is 25 year old Sergeant Nathan Harris, whose unit Echo Company is attacked from all sides, leaving him injured to return home.

We follow Sergeant Harris literally to hell and back again as the story moves us back and forth from the past in Afghanistan back to now in North Carolina. Harris' wife, Ashley seems to try and live what ever life they have here as normal as possible, coping the best she can with his injury. You will also see the Afghan farmers in the middle of this war, also trying to live a normal life, as bombs and gunfire are all around their homes and family. This film is extremely touching as you can see that those who survive the war, maybe didn't lose their life, but lost something else, perhaps physical, mental, emotional, spiritual or all four.

There are scenes that are so sad, as when Sergeant Harris is in WalMart and relates to an elderly person in a wheelchair- seeing a 25 year old and a senior citizen sharing a similar old life, is just heartbreaking. I saw all our young men drafted to Viet Nam in the sixties, and those lucky enough to came back home were just a shell of themselves. Some, like Sergeant Harris had a disability and a simple thing like putting on a sock was like climbing Mount Everest. There is something so wrong with man, that he chooses to aggress on others, after thousands of years, only to put innocent men in harms way leaving them either dead, disabled, or mentally or spiritually damaged.

I lost my 19 year old Uncle in WWII- he was trapped in a B-17 ball turret that crashed on a mission to Berlin. The B-17 landed on a German farm where the farmers stripped him of everything except for his dog tag and buried him in a wooded area. War has no respect for the living or the dead. Hell And Back Again makes me think of all the boys who didn't come home from Viet Nam and of my precious 19 year old Uncle, whose not returning home damaged my grandparents completely and left every one of our family members so sad that we never got to meet him. Hell And Back Again is a heart breaking film that makes me wish, that mankind could get it together, so we would never have any new war movies. But until that happens, Danfung Dennis helps us to remember what our young soldiers are going through today to protect our freedom through the eyes of America's finest and bravest who put themselves in harm's way for all of us.",1328659200,,2709,4.414
4892857,5,B005TZFZD8,"After watching Denfung Dennis' ""Hell and Back Again"" one would be hard pressed to balk at the next massacre that takes place in Afghanistan either on our side or on theirs'.  The ambiance of utter frustration and futility which hangs over this film is so thick one could cut it with a knife, both on and off the battlefield.

Sgt. Nathan Harris spent time in Afghanistan and Dennis, without a word of blame, an answer and certainly not a balm for the viewer, films him while in combat and when he comes home after sustaining horrendous injuries.  Paralyzed for life, the commanding man we saw in Afghanistan has disappeared into a childlike, dependent, and at times suicidal individual.  The army (not surprisingly) hadn't developed any Wonder Drugs for the likes of grunts like Sgt Dennis and one of his first trips coming back home is to the local pharmacy to receive huge doses of Oxycontin and Dilaudid.  The scene in which he plays russian roulette with his empty gun is one I wouldn't watch for 1,000 dollars.

The effects of extreme posttraumatic stress disorder on the young man are almost crippling.  His wife, Ashley, is the other casualty of a senseless war.  She is sometimes afraid of her husband and not just for him.  The physical therapy he goes through is almost as brutal as the ""combat"" (kicking in people's doors) that we witness.

Harris' motivations behind why he went into the war are horrifying.  He told a recruiter ""I want to kill people,"" and the recruiter was jubilant.

If you can stomach it, this is important.  Our complacency and failure to look at the actual realities of these men's lives when they arrive ""home""--there is no home, as Harris finds out--is why these national atrocities continue.  Devastating.

4892858,2,B005TZFZD8,This movie was so frustrating. I felt like there were major plots that were totally ignored. It seemed like he had some PTSD which was not even addressed. I also wondered how he got off the pain meds since it did appear to be addicted. I was very uncomfortable with him playing with the guns. I don't see how a wife could just sit next to him 'playing' with guns. It just seems like the issue of mental health of our soldiers was completely glossed over yet again.,1328400000,4,464,4.284090909090909
4892859,5,B005TZFZD8,"This documentary isn't about a bomb disposal unit, like The Hurt Locker, buts it's still a great follow-up to that movie - except this is real.  Everything that is shown in this is real life footage - and there are certain short, very graphic scenes that may put off more squeemish viewers.  This film cuts back and forth between footage shot in Afghanistan and film from back home in the states.  The sergeant and his wife are the main characters, but you get to see some of the men he served with, both in action and after his injury when he's at the hospital.  It's an incredible look at what our military men go through.  Frankly, I don't think I've seen anything like it before.  There was a lot of film shot in Viet Nam, but it was filmed on old cameras with grainy film.  This is much more modern and clear - almost makes you feel like you're there with them.  I give this film the highest possible recommendation - an absolute must-see.",1328140800,2,944,4.385057471264368
4892860,5,B005TZFZD8,"This film tells the story of Sgt Nathan Harris's last deployment in Afghanistan and his return home after being seriously wounded there. What makes it extraordinary is, first of all, Sgt Harris and his wife's simple openness to Danfung Dennis, the filmmaker. They were close in Afghanistan and Mr. Dennis became privy to many intimate moments after the Sgt's return. Secondly, the film's technical quality is outstanding.  In the commentary session Mr. Dennis explains how he captured combat scenes on the run without jerkiness and people going in and out of focus but the clear, smooth, high definition footage is a joy to behold. Also the two intertwined stories the film tells I found riveting and meaningful. The film showed our soldiers trying to win the hearts and minds of Afghanistan people (with minimal success) while fighting a mostly unseen enemy and, after his return home, Sgt Harris and his wife's struggles to come to grips with his often intense pain and significantly reduced physical abilities.

The film constantly cuts between Afghanistan and the United States. Some of these cuts are amazingly good.  For instance the Sgt is in Wall-Mart looking at video games. We shift to a patrol in Afghanistan checking out a village and then to a video game where an area is being checking out.

And watch the film twice: once alone and secondly with Mr. Dennis's commentary.  The commentary explained quite a bit I had questions about and also gives the Harris's reactions to having been shown the film.",1328140800,2,1514,4.968379446640316
4892861,3,B005TZFZD8,"Now this is a reality show: the real thing, the tedium of war, the tedium of slow recovery at home. I understand that these are life-and-death situations; but accustomed to the usual Hollywood attention span, I find this movie moves a tad too slowly as entertainment, and even too slowly to convey the relatively small amount of information it contains: war is hell and soldiers return home with PTSD--not exactly new news to spread over an hour-and-a-half view of the life of a not too terribly interesting Marine.

The film helps me, however, to get a deeper appreciation of war and of the men who fight and suffer, and the immediacy of the footage in both Afghanistan and North Carolina delivers these realities in a way that a quick recitation of the facts could never do. I am not convinced that getting this taste of tedium makes for a good movie, or even an excellent documentary; but those who have the patience to sit through these ninety minutes will be forever changed, even if only in a small way.

The film's strength certainly does not lie in its story, which is weak; however, there is a message, intended or not, which is that war should not be entered into lightly--hardly original, but worth repeating. The context here is Afghanistan, and throughout the movie the official reasoning for the conflict is repeated several times, as Marines explain to the Afghanis why the U. S. is there and why the villagers have to endure the suffering of being in a war zone. The latter acknowledge that they do not want the Taliban to take over, but they clearly aren't too happy about our being there either. The film presents these arguments sincerely, without taking sides, but it was hard for me not to feel that the justification rang a bit hollow--even though I have for the most part been in favor of this particular war--it still causes me to ask the question, ""Is it worth it?""

The Blu-ray format contributed strongly to this viewer's appreciation of the film because this documentary's strong suit is how close it brings one into the life of this Marine; and the clarity of the video erases any fuzziness that might separate the viewer from the subject. I found it interesting that some of the segments, including battlefield footage, appear to have been transferred completely digitally to the Blu-ray. In order to be shown in most movie houses, the video would have had to have been transferred first to film; and I would have expected the completed film then to have been converted back to digital for the Blu-ray. Either the transfer to film and back again was extraordinarily transparent, or the producers took the trouble to re-edit the Blu-ray so as to eliminate film as an intermediate step (except for those segments in which film was probably the original source); and the result pays off in the immediacy to which I referred earlier.

I am glad that the videographer/producer included a bonus feature on how he used a DSLR camera/HD camcorder and very compact motion stabilization to provide such a close and clear look, even under fire, at the battlefield, where portability was an absolute requirement. He opted for manual focus and explains how that ended up being his main technical concern. As an amateur photographer and videographer myself, I enjoyed the bonus almost as much as the movie.

I see that this documentary has a lot of critical acclaim. To be frank, I don't think it deserves it, looking at it purely in terms of results. I have seen many a documentary, some of which one might expect to be as dull as dirt based on the subject or their academic origins, but which managed to tell a good story while educating and informing. Ideally, this film, dealing with inherently compelling material (the war in Afghanistan), should have done better; so I originally gave it only two stars; but I have been feeling guilty about that. The creator and director, Danfung Dennis, did, after all, risk his life making this; and it is certainly not a bad movie. Unfortunately, there is not an engaging story line, and it seemed very long, though only an hour and a half. It needed tighter editing, possibly cutting out as much as two-thirds. On the other hand, I am sure that the filmmaker and his editor cut a lot as it was, and who can blame him for wanting to retain such hard-won footage? In spite of its major faults, it provides a unique view of war and its effects, and is thus worth having.",1327622400,6,4427,4.699742268041237
4892862,4,B005TZFZD8,"This documentary was filmed by Danfung Dennis. Danfung is a photojournalist and was embedded with U.S.M.C., Company E, 2nd Battalion, in a 2009 assault on Taliban forces in southern Afghanistan. This is not the standard documentary; we see appropriately sanitized war footage along with life when returning home. The subject in this case was 25 yr. old Sergeant Nathan Harris who was wounded in his last mission before returning home.

There is combat footage along with the Marines social mission of working with the local population and winning their confidence. The populace knows the U.S presence will eventually leave and they fear the Taliban reprisals, so it is a thankless task for our marines. We get to watch these interactions as the occur in this documentary.

Danfung has taken the editing approach of  of taking the viewer from combat to home and back again seemed too work well. He does not do any interviews and lets the scenes speak for themselves, though he did edit the film so it is his view we are seeing. But it is a real view...though the war zone is worse than pictured as is what Sgt. Harris must have gone through too even reach his therapy and being at home with his wife. You can see the amount of drugs they use too aid in his therapy to reduce the time required in interaction with medical and counseling personal.

At least now with the new laws Sgt Harris had the choice too stay in the service and is getting better treatment than if he had left. But it is obvious in the documentary that he is dealing with combat fatigue, what we today call Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD.) And every returning soldier lies about on their exit forms when leaving the theater of operation so they can get home. (This procedure is not shown in the documentary.)

Staying in service with the support of his fellow marines, his loving wife and his desire to get back into the field will hopefully keep him motivated. The Sgt. represents the typical combat veteran returning home. Yet in his case we must add too his homing coming his traumatic injury. It was the same in most wars. Men change form what the see and do and realize, though dangerous, life for them is easier in a war zone. That is why you see so many volunteering for multiple tours of duty. The Sgt. is still young but a professional soldier and seems too be continuing to strive too perform his duties.

The documentary does not seem too have any political agenda, that I could see, and I like that. The camera is just a witness too what is transpiring. It brings too light what all these young men are going through and hopefully many will get too see this film. There is no glamor ...only duty.",1327622400,,2683,4.590814196242171

To Hell and Back Again gives you an inside look of what it is Like at War in Combat and the Hardships of Coming Home.  I served as a Grunt in the Iraq War and am 27 Years Old.

4892864,4,B005TZFZD8,"A stylish, intense documentary that manages to contrast the surrealism of patrolling an Afghan village that has changed little in four hundred years against shopping at big-box stores in American suburbia.  The narrative is straight-forward, it is created by the documentary subject and circumstance, not a voice-over narrative of the type you might get from Werner Herzog or Mike Moore.  Circumstances are such that the focus of the documentary, Sergeant Nathan Harris, is seriously wounded and struggles stateside to rehab and reintegrate.  Here the documentarian weaves cinema, utilizing flashbacks; passing car headlights and horns become tracer rounds and yelled commands, and kicking in doors in a video game sequence scene-transitions into kicking in real doors in Afghanistan.
Sergeant Harris is prescribed strong medications when he gets home, and sits around armed and mock-playing Russian roulette, everyone kinda kidding but kinda not, a dark, post-traumatic, opiated streak of rehabilitative reality that now affects tens of thousands.",1327363200,,1048,5.748387096774193
4892865,5,B005TZFZD8,"I saw this movie when it played at the Cincinnati Film Festival some 2-3 months ago and to say that this movie is haunting and stays with you long after the lights have come back on, is an understatement of the first order.

""Hell and Back Again"" (88 min.) brngs a complicated and stark look at the life of 25 yr. old Sargent Nathan Harris. The movie shifts back and forth between footage that embedded director Danfung Dennis shot while Harris was in Afghanistan, and then back to Harris' life after the war in his home town in North Carolina. I am not spoiling much of the ""plot"" when I say that Harris suffers a serious (ok, devastating) injury during his time in Afghanistan. This movie is intimate yet tough as nails at the same time. Apart from the emotional effect one goes through from watching this footage, one of the other things that really struck me while watching some of the scenes in Afghanistan is the utter absurdity of it all. When trying to explain for the umpteenth time something to the farmers and villagers in Afghanistan, the exasperated response more often than not from them was ""You're all the same! Please leave us alone! I wish the Taliban would also leave us alone! Why can't we simply live our lives?""

In all, this is quite the movie. Certainly one of the better documentaries I saw last year, and also one of the better Afghan/Iraqi war-related documentaries out there. Beware: this ain't a ""happy"" movie, and there is no ""happy ending"". Highly recommended!",1326931200,3,1491,4.643939393939394
8486597,5,B005TZFZD8,"Overall a great movie to watch whilst reflecting upon the reality of war and the perils of combat. As depicted, the fight never ends for those on the ground, in the reserves, and back at home. The mortal pain from the wound made a great transition to understand what the real deal is. We were especially interested in the depiction of the combat in comparison to the life back home. The combat encroached upon the lives of those that struggled to live, the scars of combat then followed those invaders home. As stated before, the movie was great and the sacrifices of the persons depicted within were even greater.",1486080000,,614,4.6422018348623855
8486598,5,B005TZFZD8,"The film was an honest glimpse into the daily lives of Nathan Harris & Ashley Harris.  Nathan was sent home after being seriously injured.  The couple faced many challenges together.  The filmmakers mixed scenes of the Harris' daily life in America with footage from Nathan's military service.

One of my favorite scenes was Nathan interacting with a Walmart greeter.  He was open, discussing with his injury in a matter-of-fact manner.  Although he's back home, Nathan is still fighting a battle, but this time it is to rehabilitate himself.  Ashley is loving and supportive in the film even when it's difficult.",1483142400,,613,5.07
