8491342,5,B0062OE4HI,"Amazing Series, I wish he had shown more of the documents from his private collection that validate the claims. I have followed many of his other works where he has shown the actually writings of the founding fathers. Sadly in this day and age where reason is trying to be silenced for this very one sided interpretation of history its refreshing to see a more transparent view of history. This particular series does cover a lot of the bible which I can understand why some would not appreciate it but sadly many believe the lie its not part of the history which that is pure fiction. So if you can put your opinion aside for a minute sit back and enjoy learning a part of history you may never get to hear about anywhere else.",1525824000,,728,4.4
8491343,1,B0062OE4HI,"As a former teacher, I found this about as accurate as a 2 a.m. Popeil infomercial.  The Fox News version of history -- inaccurate, Bible-slanted and total nonsense.  The Founding Fathers knew all too well that religion had to be kept OUT of government, and our country was founded on the belief that people should be free to worship as they choose.  That's not ""both kinds - country AND western!""; that's ALL religions, be they Protestant, Catholic or some other form of Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, Wiccan, atheist or the Church of the Purple People Eaters.  Freedom of worship -- true freedom of worship and respect for the choices of others -- is an amazing gift, one of the best we were given in this country.  One has only to look around the world and see the many, many battles being fought over religion to realize how blessed we are to have a country where we may peaceably worship as we choose.

Barton conveniently chooses to ignore this.

This kind of misrepresentation helps children not at all.  Do your kids a favor.  If you're homeschooling and you want to use documentaries as part of your instructional methods, for goodness' sake, use American Experience or something made by people who don't have a vested interest in pushing a false historical agenda.",1521244800,,1283,4.795454545454546

8491346,1,B0062OE4HI,Awful. David Barton isn't a trained historian. He's an evangelical quack seeking to overturn the true secular history of America's founding.,1517616000,4,140,5.714285714285714
8491347,5,B0062OE4HI,"David Barton's ""Demystifying the Judicial System"" is outstanding, particularly in 2017.  Great timely questions asked by various folks about government, politics, civic responsibility.  As Barton's commentator, Rick Green, says, ""I learned more in this episode than I did in 3 years of law school!""  And I learned about the Declaration of Independence and the resulting framework for our government, the Constitution.",1494288000,,417,5.80327868852459

8491351,5,B0062OE4HI,"Once you start learning the truth about our nation and our founding fathers you will become addicted! This is a fascinating series. If you buy this you will want to get the American Heritage Series and the American Heritage collection. There are some repeats in these series but worth it, there are things on each set that will be sure to enlighten and amaze you.
A great teaching tool for home schoolers and a great series to do a bible study fused with some american history at the same time!",1386720000,3,494,4.5
