8078291,5,B000AE8KX0,"Police TV is a collection of 29 episodes from 6 different police TV shows from the golden years of TV.  I paid $9.98 for my set and considering that you can pay $5 and higher for just 4 episodes of one of these shows, you cannot complain about the price. The reason why you can get so many episodes for such a low price is that all of these shows are in the public domain. The quality of the prints used in this collection vary, but overall you will get a fairly decent picture on your screen.

The really great thing about this collection is that it is not limited to the usual suspects, that is shows such as Dragnet & Peter Gunn that are quite easy to find and obtain. The collection also includes such harder to find shows as Burke's Law, Dick Tracy & Racket Squad.  Of special note is the presence of 8 episodes of The Man Behind the Badge a truly obscure,  1950's TV show that is very hard to find information on. As far as this writer is aware, this show was never on DVD until this collection.",1194912000,6,1001,4.170984455958549
8078292,4,B000AE8KX0,"""RACKET SQUAD"" was an early crime drama produced by Hal Roach Jr. It was twice nominated for a ""Best Mystery"" Emmy. The criminals pursued by this branch of law enforcement take advantage of a victim's confidence in them (thus: ""con"" men).

""DRAGNET"" was created, written, produced and directed by Jack Webb, from its late-1940s radio days through an 8 season TV run in the '50s. The show was revived in 1967 (with several co-star changes) and continued another three years.

Like the two above programs, THE MAN BEHIND THE BADGE was based on actual police case files. The show aired on the CBS network for a single season, then went into syndication for one more. Norman Rose was the original host; Charles Bickford taking over duties for year #2. The selections here are all from the second season.

Comic strip character DICK TRACY got his cinematic start in 1937, in a series of low-budget hour-long movies starring Ralph Byrd. Byrd would reprise the role with this TV series, from 1950 to '52.

With its famous Henry Mancini-composed soundtrack music, PETER GUNN was one of the most stylish shows on television. As created by Blake Edwards, Gunn was a ""cool"" jazz-loving dapper detective who frequented a waterfront club called ""Mother's."" His girlfriend (played by Lola Albright) was a singer there.

The guest cast of the lone example of BURKE'S LAW in this set includes one of Hitchcock's favorite actors (Homolka), TV Batman's bird-like nemesis (Meredith), and the son of a pioneering radio comedian (Wynn). Gene Barry portrayed Capt. Amos Burke in this series that was revived for a single season 30 years after it left the air in 1965.

8078293,4,B000AE8KX0,"Following in the footsteps of St. Clair Vision's 3-DVD set titled ""Western TV,"" comes another 3-disc set ""Police TV,"" comprised of episodes of mostly 1950s crime shows.  This is a really nice collection of some easy to find, as well as some rare police shows. Audio/visual quality is about average with the Peter Gunn episodes above average for these type of public domain releases. Here's the breakdown:

Disc 1

Dragnet - 8 episodes; Dragnet has been done to death on DVD, but this collection includes several episodes that have been harder to find on DVD.

Dick Tracy - 2 episodes; a very tough find on DVD, one of the episodes, ""BB Eyes,"" is making its debut on DVD.

Disc 2

Peter Gunn - 2 episodes; same two episodes that have appeared on other collections from Platinum and Diamond, but these are better looking than the other two.

The Man Behind the Badge - 8 episodes; as far as I know, this may be making its DVD debut on this collection and, as such, is the rarity on this set, along with Dick Tracy.

Disc 3

Burke's Law - 1 episode; the only hour long episode and the only show from the 1960s on this set; this same episode ""Who Killed Jason Shaw?"" has circulated on other PD collections.

Racket Squad - 8 episodes; there have been a few releases of this show and there is some duplication here from other discs, but still a harder-than-usual show to find on DVD.

The comparatively low price of this DVD set combined with a few genuinely rare television series make this a worthwhile addition for those who enjoy classic crime dramas on the small screen.",1127088000,28,1570,4.531914893617022
