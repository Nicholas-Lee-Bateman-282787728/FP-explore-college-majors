This is the best Christmas Gift to all skateboarders.  I have taken this video and helped myself bigtime.  Adrenaline Skate Park is now giving all the skaters that attend skateboard camp Skateboarding Explained.  It rocks!  It also destroys any other instructional video out there.  So if you want to improve or learn how to skateboard, take Skateboarding Explained and enjoy the BEST TRICK TIPS EVER.",1195430400,21,1056,9.303921568627452
2581063,5,B000FP2IQE,"Awesomely freakishly amazing! Dan breaks every trick down until it can't be broken down any more and goes through each tiny step in slow motion. SE cuts a lot of corners for you so you can learn quick. I learned 180 ollies within 3 days and I've been working on a kickflip around 2 months now and I'm so close to landing it, everyone else I talked to it took them 8 months to 2 years to get a kickflip. That's because they didn't have SE :)

Skateboarding is trial and error, but SE cuts out a lot of the little trial and errors (ex. foot placement, direction to kick the tail...you'll know what I mean when you watch it!) that would otherwise take 67 years to figure out.",1194393600,6,672,4.209302325581396
2581064,5,B000FP2IQE,"Skateboarding. Such a developing sport and lifestyle. Each year the populous of skateboarders grow. Could it be for the thrill, or perhaps the sheer technicality and accessibility of the sport? for any reason, Skateboarding is an exciting activity to be doing. For me, Skateboarding immersed me in a great active outlet in middle school. I also discovered music and art through various skate videos. The only problem for me, and many others who decide to take the challenge of skateboarding is its difficulty level. I remember when learning how to ride a board I would want to learn how to ollie, and follow crappy grainy pictures and short sentence instructions on how to do the trick on websites. I got slowly better but my friends were progressing a lot faster than me. I even got Tony Hawk Trick Tips (1,2 and 3) They helped a bit but I really did not see a vast improvement or feel in my skateboarding ability.
  Here I am as a college freshman, I decided to go back where I left off in 9th grade on skating. I guess it helps that I am much older now, but I started picking up my old tricks better and I got more style and ease over the board. I definitely was keen to improve again. I was surfing through youtube when I found someone recommending this video as a good instructional video, so I watched the sample 360 flip clip and was impressed how I quickly understood how to actually attempt the trick. I decided to order this video based on various testimonials, thinking it couldn't hurt my skating.
  Once I received the video, I was thoroughly impressed. I looked through the basic instructions on the ollie and just watching the video I understood how I could actually raise my ollie height to a few extra inches. Dan MacFarlane, the creator and instructor in this video really simplifies each specific trick and explains it in a very easy style any ages can follow. Each trick he teaches (from Ollie, Pop Shove Its (BS/FS), Kickflips, heelflips, 360 Flips, Board Slides) he stresses important key points each time. Watching him perform a trick in slow-mo, Its easy to copy and apply it to your skateboarding. I did not experience this ease of learning and applying watching other skateboarding instructional videos.
  Watching the video already after owning it for a week and half, I already increased my ollie height, improved my pop shove its and got clean frontside 180 ollies down and great popping kickflips and varial flips down.. His tips on the mini ramp are great too.
  Not only does Dan give you great trick tips (stressing the pre-requisites before each trick) He also teaches the fundamentals of skateboarding. How to push, how to figure out which stance a beginner is, how to turn properly. These tips will help any beginner to successfuly join the club. He teaches you how NOT to skate (mongo) which is essential because like many skateboarders, I look in disgust as many skaters around me push mongo. After these fundamental tips, he gives you 8 fundamentals that you can apply to experience level in skateboarding. I feel that these tips really help any skater and is something that makes Dan's video stand out even more.
 I recommend this video to all beginners, intermediate and pro skaters, it will make you skate the best you ever skated. I can't wait till his next installments.",1194220800,35,3314,4.709844559585492
2581065,5,B000FP2IQE,"This video is by far the BEST instructional video on the market. In my opinion, its better than Transworld's Show Me the Way. Yet furthermore, It makes you want to KEEP GOING and learn so much more than you thought you could with skateboarding. There is no turning back after watching this, Soon enough you will be checking back with this video to not only see how to do more tricks...but also perfect them, because Dan has an excellent technical and creative skills on the board.

You will start off by learning the correct stance, which not many videos address! They even tackle a main-beginners' problem--Mongo!

This video covers details you wouldn't think of, and shows the best tricks that are staples..as well as give you a starting point to create and innovate your own.

Remember, with practice the easier the harder the tricks will be.

CT Signing off, Buy the DVD--You WON'T be unsatisfied!",1192406400,9,901,4.7935483870967746
2581066,5,B000FP2IQE,"I got the DVD and I love it!

It's super comprehensible, no annoying sound effects or anything that would turn me off or discourage me... just skateboarding explained, pure and simple, nothing more or less. His voice is very calming, and it 'sticks' with you.

I spent all of last night on the basketball court, practising the basics. I feel so much better now, knowing the basics and knowing I am learning things the right way, because it's  so much harder to get rid of bad form.

The DVD has three parts, so no matter if you are a beginner like me, or been skateboarding for a couple of years... there is something you can learn from Dan!

Yeah I feel like Dan and I have bonded, I mean, I have never met him or spoken to him personally, but I have watched him, talked back at him the DVD, and listened to him so much, that I can almost hear him speak to me when I am out there trying to do 180's, tic tacs and manuals.

Also, he has a myspace account where you can ask him questions, leave comments and he actually takes the time to write back and give more tips!

I highly recomend this DVD!",1192320000,11,1106,4.164319248826291
2581067,5,B000FP2IQE,"From the start of this DVD, Dan MacFarlane gives you the basics of skateboarding in a easy to follow pace. I watched this with my 9yr. old son, who has been trying to learn various tricks on his own. After his first viewing of Skateboarding Explained, he immediately put on his helmet, ran outside, and worked on his Ollie. He easily copied what he saw on the DVD; since all of the tricks are shown in slow motion, and graphics appear onscreen, to guide the viewer where to look, while attempting the tricks. What was funny was my son asked me, for the first time, to get him portable DVD player, so he could watch the DVD outside and practice skateboarding. I may actually to purchase it for him, since this is the skateboarding DVD he truly feels will help him. I've already bought for my son two other DVDs, ""Zero To Hero"", and ""Tony Hawk's Trick Tips"", but they did not seem to be as detailed as Skateboarding Explained. Skateboarding Explained already has my son performing his Ollie higher and leveled off, and he is getting better at other tricks he has never tried before, because now he understands what he needs to do to nail the tricks. After purchasing the ""other two"" DVDs, I was not sure ""S.E."" was going to be any different, but since my son did not have a mentor to teach him the tricks in person, I wanted to give this DVD a chance, and it was worth it. Thanks Dan Macfarlane, you did a great job, my son certainly appreciates it too.",1191974400,20,1451,4.397769516728625
2581068,5,B000FP2IQE,"Dan has hit the nail on the head with this video. He has so much experience teaching people how to skate from working with Lake Owen that he was able to tranfer his knowledge to video very easily. His step by step instruction is incredibly easy to follow. If you can't learn tricks from this video, maybe you are in the wrong sport, as he breaks it down so clearly, anyone can do it. I know so many people who are anxiously awaiting skateboarding explained 2, to learn even more. If you are a beginner or intermdiate skater, this video will take you to the next level.",1190937600,10,568,4.317757009345795
2581069,5,B000FP2IQE,"I started skateboarding way back before they made instructional videos. The basics were always either self taught, friends teaching you, or other kids calling you names like ""poser"" or much too worse to metion forcing you to learn by the trial and error method which often resulted in a slow learning process. I eventualy became better and learned the tricks as they came along. After years of learning I became a good skater in my local scene.
I haven't rode a skateboard in years because I spend my days working or being a father. My kids recently became facinated with my old skateboards, so I wanted them to learn how to ride one. I bought Tony Hawk's Trick Tips thinking they could learn from my childhood hero, This didn't work/ My kids wanted to learn but couldn't stay focused, My wife said they weren't interested in it because ""they don't get it"". I found Skateboarding Explained and it was great. I found my kids to be responsive to the methods of teaching on this video. The tricks were expained in a way my kids could understand. and they seemed to listen more and pay attention to the video. They didn't lose interest. I wish there was a video called ""Cleaing Your Room Explained"" With the same instructor. Id buy that in a heartbeat!
I loved seeing my kids excited about something. I instantly had flashbacks the moment I walked through the door and found my kids practicing kick turns in front of the TV while watching the video. The first time I stood on a skateboard I was trying desperately to Tic-Tac and my kids were doing it on one of their first times actualy riding a skateboard. My kids were happy because they were accomplishing each trick after being taught on the video. My 6yo was learning fast while my 4yo was having taking a little longer, but the DVD navigates from each trick easily so I would skip back on whatever they didn't pull right away.
This video teaches Ollies, frontside & backside 180's, nollies, how to ride ramps and do street tricks(my favorites) and any flip trick that you or your kids want to know.
Skateboarding Explained is a great buy for kids wanting to learn how to skateboard. I highly recommend this video for kids who want to advance in skating and learn how to use tricks they already know and adapt them to the much more advanced tricks.
The how-to's are great because they tell how
 This video has shown me a lot by helping me understand how the tricks work even the ones I already know. I felt like a kid again riding my skateboard in the living room. My kids made me where a helmet like the guy in the video. and then they let me get on a skateboard. I started getting my old tricks back! I landed a Backside 180 kickflip for the first time in 9 years.  I felt like a hero to my kids, they were jumping up and dow cheering me on. I was suprised how well the video works. I was able to do the tricks again after relearning them by using this video. My kids were really suprised to see me doing the tricks. My wife looked so happy as she watched her son, daughter, and husband totally destroy our hardwood floors in our house. We were all having fun. This has been one of my best nights ever.

2581070,5,B000FP2IQE,"I have used a couple other instructional DVDs to learn skateboarding, but it was nothing like Skateboarding Explained. I had read a very good review of the video on Transworld Skateboarding magazine, so I bought the DVD and am very happy I did so. The teacher is a professional skateboarder and a coach as well. He explains every trick in detail and makes it very easy for any beginners and intermediates to learn faster. The images are very well done because it shows every step of the trick. I highly recommend Skateboarding Explained if you wish to learn how to skateboard.",1180915200,20,576,4.712871287128713

Dan is thorough, precise, and to the point.  The slow motion replays of the moves and techniques are well explained and easy to understand.  As a trick is performed, Dan walks you through all the movements, the placement of your feet, and all the fine details necessary to help you execute and nail the trick.  I have watched this video many times in order to perfect the tricks while I practice and it is an invaluable tool. Dan has got skateboarding instruction down to a science!

2581082,5,B000FP2IQE,"I am 30 and I did not know how to skate at all, and I had looked at many other instructions. This was the only video that showed me how to start out from the beginning and progressed me up to flip tricks, slides, and grinds in a clear and easy to follow way. If you want to learn and pay attention and actually go out and work on it in the order like I did, you will be skating well.

It shows you everything you need to know. It starts out showing you the parts of the board, each trick shows you where to put your feet, tells how to have your legs and upper body positioned, where to look, how to swing your upper body and arms, where to lean, where to slide and kick your feet, and the 8 principle part tells about visualizing your tricks and other techniques that all helped me more than any other video. Everything, I mean, everything is covered on how to do the tricks. Any age can understand it too. The slow motion with the instructions makes it easy to mimic.

2581084,5,B000FP2IQE,"After hours searching the internet and skate shops I landed on this video. My son is 10 and has been skating on his own for about 6 years.
Had a pretty decent ollie and functional on ramps and street, but had hit a wall of frustration on going further. This tape blasted that wall open for him.
After two viewings his ollies are higher and easier to attain. He's pumping well on the ramps with frontside and backside 180's and has finally achieved the grind he has so desperately wanted to do. All in less than a week. From a parent's point of view, I see him breaking bad habits and building solid fundamentals that will remove all limits as to how far he can go. I cannot for the life of me understand any negative reviews on this product. As a parent, the results speak for themselves.

2581085,2,B000FP2IQE,"Ok, let's start with the title: ""Skateboarding Explained""... One would think that this video explains techniques and tricks. Well it doesn't. This video is like washing machine instructions, it goes like ""step 1: do this, step 2: do this"" and never goes any deeper. I'm giving it 2 stars for the first part of the video, where it demonstrates the very basics where not much can go wrong and teaches a good approach to skateboarding for total beginners. If you're anything more than that, this video will not help you. when it goes into more advanced tricks it explaines NOTHING and will not help you land them, it's like a camera's ""quick start"" instruction manual, it very briefly describes each step of the trick without analyzing common mistakes and how to correct them. If it's your first time on a skateboard, get this video, but if you're looking for help to land anything more advanced than an ollie, then stay away from it. There are FAR better FREE videos on youtube.",1300060800,3,976,4.713450292397661

I had been searching for quality video intruction online for a while and I finally found one that works.  Dan McFarlane has a great style to teaching that is both entertaining and practical.  My son will watch the video then go outside to work on a particular trick, then come back in and re-watch the video to see how he is progessing.  It is like having a personal lesson on hand anytime.  This video has top quality production and sound it is so much better than trying to piece together videos online.  I would recommend this video for the beginner or the advanced skater.  The progression from basics to ""most wanted"" tricks is seamless and shows the skater how to progress naturally.  I highly recommend buying this video.",1298246400,2,811,4.583333333333333

Dan breaks down each trick in a clear, consistent, and precise manner. I wouldn't start my kid off with any other instructional video.

It's not mind-blowing, however: This is a no-frills instructional video that comes off a bit humorless and dry, and it's hard to keep people's attention without a personal touch. Also, the narration for parts of many tricks becomes redundant, and I found myself wishing Dan had started with names for different foot set up positions, e.g. ""the ollie position"", or ""the shove-it position"", or even ""the flame dragon position""--because there aren't already common names for the foot positions, the field is ripe!",1296950400,2,814,5.112781954887218

I was concerned that without some instruction they would either hurt themselves or quickly lose interest in their new hobby.  Skateboarding Explained shows them the fundamentals that they need to skate around confidently and to be able to progress to more complicated tricks.  The clear explanations and super slo-mo footage make the video easy to learn from, and my kids watch it over and over again, with great enthusiasm.  This DVD is a great study guide for every youngster starting out in skateboarding, it makes their first experiences much more successful and enjoyable.

2581089,5,B000FP2IQE,"I skateboarded back in the 70's with the advent of urethane wheels.  I always envied the guys who looked at home on their boards and could ride aggressively (like I did on my BMX), but I never got to that ""special place"" on a skateboard.

Now I'm 43 and have a 9 year old son and so my time is spent being good to him instead of skateboarding, biking and playing Space Invaders at the 7-11.  About a year ago at one of the many kids' b-day parties I now attend I saw a 9 year old girl skating a LOT better than the guys, some of them older than her by quite a few years.  Her father gave me Dan MacFarlane's card explaining that he was the reason that his daughter could skateboard so well and that he gave lessons here in the Houston area.  I finally called him after a long while and got some lessons from him for my son and now I wished I hadn't waited so long.  My son learned the fundamentals of how to control a skateboard IMMEDIATELY.  After only 3 lessons my son skated at a dramatically different level and with much more confidence and focus.

Well, it turns out Dan ALSO has a DVD, ""Skateboarding Explained"", which is aptly named.  Actually, it's the best selling instructional skateboarding DVD on the market and widely recognized as the best in terms of the quality of the presentation of the material.  Dan does an extraordinary job presenting the terminology, the mechanics and the physics of a trick and he does so by beginning with the most basic skills and building sequentially and logically on top of each of the previous skill sets and tricks.  Once he begins to explain a trick on the DVD he will already have explained the prerequisite skills necessary to pull it off.  I can't imagine a better way to teach skateboarding.

Between the slow motion film explanations, the graphic markers put on to the images and the precision instructions Dan leaves no doubt as to how to execute a trick.  If you can't do the trick after watching the DVD, you simply haven't worked hard enough.  The material could not be explained any more methodically and thoroughly.

If you're lucky enough to live in or near Houston don't miss the opportunity to take lessons from Dan Macfarlane himself.  My son's quantum leap in understanding has increased his enjoyment of skateboarding immeasurably and has removed the hesitation that comes from not being sure how to approach tricks.  Dan teaches him the proper technique and then it's up to my son to work at it until he gets it right.  If you can't take lessons from Dan MacFarlane himself, the DVD is the next best thing.  Oh right, and now that I've been watching the DVD with my son I'M skateboarding again and my learning curve is skyrocketing upward, also.  Just because you grow up doesn't mean you have to grow old.

Thanks, Dan!

2581090,5,B000FP2IQE,"I've been snowboarding for 20 years & teaching for 18,and as a staff trainer at my area, I have a pretty good feel for what constitutes good (and poor) instruction. My 10-year-old daughter started to skate this year after having snowboarded for three seasons, so when she had a hard time picking it up (the movement patterns and balance points aren't quite the same from one sport to the other at the beginning level), I began to look around for an instructional DVD. Most of the offerings out there are trick-laden action sequences, which are fine for advanced skaters, but not really appropriate for beginners.
  When I previewed this DVD, I knew right away that Dan MacFarlane had done a really superb job putting this together. It's intelligently broken down into several learning phases, and all of them do a stellar job of taking what is a very fast-paced sport & breaking it down into very easily understandable (and attainable) parts. Dan's focus on stance (SO very important in any board sport), all of the phases of a given movement/skill set, and constant reference to how to move the body through the exercise & where to direct your ""sight lines"" are very clearly explained without being tedious or condescending. Let's face it--never-ever instruction & learning can be pretty tediuos sometimes, and it's the challenge (and hallmark of) a good instructor to make the material ineresting and relevant. My daughter & I watched it end-to-end, and then took it out to the parking lot & then into the skate park. As she continues to progress, and run into plateaus (inevitable in any sport), we just pop it in the portable DVD player & review what she's haviing difficulty with.
  As the DVD progresses up through the various levels, there's a great re-cap of the skill-set that you should have in order to learn the skills in the next section, and I think that Dan also does a great job of mentioning what it is that you should have total ownership of before progressing on to the next thing. That's something I see a lot of in the snowboard world--people who try to tackle terrain & skills that they just don't have the foundation for. Let's be honest--you just don't know what you don't know, and unless someone tells you what it is you need, how can you learn what it is you need to progress to the next level? Again, just like in the lower skill levels, the intermediate/advanced material is covered with the same throughness as the other stuff, and the video sequences do a great job of showing what you need to know.
  As a 42-year-old coming into this sport as a never-ever, I'll be watching this over & over again (probably a lot more than my daughter will) as I begin my journey from newbie to novice and beyond. Thanks, Dan, for creating such a well-made instructuctional DVD. Like I said before, I've seen my share of good (and bad) instruction--this isn't good instruction; it's GREAT instruction, and I hope that the review & the DVD give you what you need to enter, progress in, and enjoy the sport, regardless of how old you are when you decide to helmet up & have at it. Money & time well spent--GO SKATE!!",1278892800,7,3130,4.650994575045208

I was skating for 3 years before this and have been kicking myself for not getting this sooner and pondering how good I would be now if I had. This video takes you from starting out, to basics, and then the most sought out tricks beginners and intermediate skaters will want to learn. I watched it over and over the first night I received it and the next day when I went skating I was thinking very differently and skating much better immediately. After reviewing it over a week my skills drastically improved. Any age skater can majorly benefit from owning and studying this video.

All of my tricks that I have learned, or have wanted to learn, have been on Skateboarding Explained.
  I was at the skatepark one day, and my mom sat down with this family, and they told us that the pro himself had taught thier kid, and they gave us his number, and we called him up. I took 6 lessons from him, and have learned so much.

I decided to begin my skateboarding renovations on my opposite ""switch"" foot and I can honestly say that thanks to this DVD I have completely relearned skating on my opposite foot. If anyone is skeptical of this product or anything like that just think about the kid who learned how to skate on his BAD foot, it felt worse than learning these tricks the first time! haha Please take my testimony and believe in not only this product and me, but believe in yourself that better skating IS possible.

I have been skating 2 years, but considering all the good things I heard about it, I got this to see if there's anything I could learn. Well, I learned dozens of things! Not just tricks, but the trick to the tricks like where to look, precisely where to place my feet, and where to kick the board, and a whole lot more. The slow motion really helped too. It helped me understand it in a way that I may never have thought of. These are the the most clear instructions I have seen, and I have seen a bunch of videos. It is a ""full package"" showing how to start out, and trick by trick builds up to the ""most wanted"" tricks a newer or even experienced skater will want to learn.

I was lucky to be one of those.
I then looked at it and was amazed at how much I improved!
He gives out clear steps on how it's done.
I had improved so much and astonished my friends.

I would fall and lift myself back up again and learn from my mistakes and then i would try again the next day. Always hopping for the best ofcourse. I was at the skatepark one day just doing what i usually do. While i was skating i noticed that almost every skater at the park had a sticker on the back of there board. It was the exact same sticker on every board i saw. I couldint help but wonder what the sticker was about. I walked up to a group of skaters and i asked them about the sticker. They seemed suprised that i asked. They started talking to me about this company called MENTALITY that came up with a skateboarding explained DVD that explains to u word for word how to skate. It really caught my attention. When i got back to my place that same day i got on to amazon and i typed in skateboarding explained. I was totally blown away to actually see a DVD pop up on the screen called ""Skateboarding Explained"" by Dan Mcfarlane. I now own this DVD and i would recomend it to anybody who skates or wants to skate. Cause this DVD has really turned my life around for the best.

My ambition was to learn how to Ollie, a skill I had never figured out as a kid, and this DVD helped! Through the slow-motion videos, and thorough clear explanations, I learned about the mechanics of the ollie, and was able to apply them on the street.

After watching this DVD, within four days my tricks more than doubled. I was trying to learn varial kickflips for about two years before I got this DVD. After watching this DVD I almost instantly got the trick down. I've always had trouble with friends trying to teach me new tricks by trying to show me, but the way the SE DVD breaks down every trick and explains them in detail, it's a lot easier than I expected.

I never really progressed as far as I wanted so I figured I would get the DVD as a ""brusher up"" for myself, and maybe something that would catch the eye of my son and/or stepdaughter. The video is really straight to the point, you can skip to whatever level you are at, and move up from there. For me it helped with relearning balance, foot stance and placement.

2581125,5,B000FP2IQE,"I am a keen but uncoordinated ""extreme"" sports addict...generally takes me a long time to build up the skills, and there's always a few hilarious incidents along the way.

I often find instructors are very poor at getting the point across to someone who needs to internalise and translate in their own way - for examlple I gave up ski lessons and found a few instructional books that worked for me...then it was just a case of working it.

Having skated as a youngster on a plastic board - and having the kids show interest recently, we went out and did our best, but I struggled to get the kids motivated over being scared.

As for myself, found the balance wasn't what it used to be! And thought i could take a few steps toward some ""tricks"" or skills as well (as opposed to just bombing down slopes when I was a kid). I was looking for a product that:
a) broke these skills down to the basics then built up on them
b) motivated the kids
c) explained at a level we all could understand

and this is it.

The way in which Dan takes you through the connected skills that build up to msatering skate park or street showoffs is great, and I found myself happily tic tacing and 180'ing first on the rubber mats in my lounge room and then with the kids (although they are still building up to riding confidence). I am yet to have the confidence to take it to the park, but I am sure this DVD will lead through that just as easily (and safely).

Even made me feel less guilty for early days spent as a mongo pusher...

Of course - watching Dan do the ""tricks"" Dad had just done, that both motivated the kids and raised their opinion of me!

Well thought out, well broken down into each individual step that builds up to a complete repertoire, worth having unless you are a guru (then you can still learn from this re breaking these steps down to teach your friends piece by piece).

My only criticism is that Dan goes through the same thing (the key important items) so often that he sounds a little bored - I can certainly understand that given how far back to the beginning he goes...

Outstanding.

8125191,5,B000FP2IQE,"Skateboarding Explained is a labour of love for legendary skater Dan Macfarlane and precisely his love for skateboarding that makes this instructional video so different than any others. MacFarlane teaches you how to go from Zero to Hero in the most didactic way possible. Even if you're an absolute beginner or an old schooler who's getting back on the board after a 20 year hiatus, the dos and don'ts of every trick are there on Skateboarding Explained. Easy to follow directions and techniques will get you thrashin' in no time. I absolutely recommend this DVD.",1482192000,,564,4.947368421052632

8125195,4,B000FP2IQE,"It is very thorough, detailed, repetitive, and the slow-mo is great. If you want to learn a trick right, you will appreciate the repetition, even though it is boring. My only complaint is that the narrator speaks in a monotone. I am starting out on a longboard, so this DVD doesn't apply right now. When I advance to a shortboard, this DVD will really come in handy.",1461542400,,366,4.477611940298507
8125196,5,B000FP2IQE,"As a none skate boarding father of a twelve year old daughter, I must admit that I cringed at the thought of my little girl skate boarding.  However, I was fortunate to meet Mr. Dan McFarlane about seven years ago. Long before my little girl new what a skateboard was. Who would have thought that seven years later this encounter would be a blessing. I knew back then that Dan was a boarder, and heard from many sources that he was good, but I had no interest. After a few years of not seeing him, mr. Farlane showed up at a store that we met at. I anxiously told him about my daughter and that I needed his help. He was excited to hear this and recommended his instructional DVD. Not only that, but he took the time to point me in the right direction of for as getting the proper skating equipment for her. To sum it up. This DVD was far more than I expected. The professional video quality, the audio, and the easiness to follow alone with him was a plus. He explains skating in a way that a beginner and a father would feel comfortable having his daughter go out and skate after watching it. My daughter enjoys it and has watch it three times, with constant pausing and note taking. Dan also took the time to take a photo with me after seeing him again after purchasing the generously priced DVD. Now my daughter believes that I actually met a professional skater. Looks like aim the cool dad now! Thanks, Dan.",1432425600,,1413,4.31203007518797
