8124077,5,B000FKP1AE,"For those interested in the Battle of the Atlantic, this DVD should be in their collection.  Originally an episode of The History Channel's ""Suicide Missions"" series, U-Boats features many interviews of former captains - most of whom passed away soon afterwards.  This is therefore an important archive of their experiences.  Unlike many programs on U-Boats, this one clearly explains that after May 1943, to set sea in one was to die.  Combat casualties were nearly seventy-five percent.  The program also discusses the many technologies which rendered U-Boats obsolete by that date.  The vaunted ""Elektroboots,"" the Types XXI and XXVII, are also reviewed.",1501804800,,657,5.392156862745098
8124078,4,B000FKP1AE,The stats on how many Germans served on U-boats who didn't return from service is scary.  The title to this DVD is appropriate.  You almost feel claustrophobic once you get a feeling for what life was like on the U-boats.,1231286400,2,221,4.5
