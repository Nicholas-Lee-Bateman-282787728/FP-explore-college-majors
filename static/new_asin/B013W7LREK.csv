8729013,5,B013W7LREK,"Watched Applesauce on Shudder and enjoyed it from beginning to the end. I've learned to never start a independent movie with over the top expectations. Applesauce has a hip/jazzy feel to it, two couples that live in NY city discuss the worst thing they have ever done over a dinner outing. Hidden secrets cause a lot of issues between the couples and friendships are destroyed. Sounds too serious? Well, NO the story line has a high level of comedic satire all over the movie. Best friends Ron and Les have a falling out and surprisingly Ron begins to find body parts pop up in his day to day life. Ron suspects Les, his wife and Les's wife but the body parts keep popping up everywhere he turns.

Comedy is dark comedy it is not for people that are sensitive to cursing, crude behavior, sex scenes and genitals. This is not for kids are prude over sensitive people.

However, it is a great movie to watch with friends , date night , late nights, movie nights.",1505174400,,960,4.48

8729015,3,B013W7LREK,"Bought it as a gift for someone who loved ""Happiness"" by the same director. But this is not as good. We didn't hate it, but probably not going to watch it again any time soon.",1481068800,,175,4.0285714285714285
8729016,2,B013W7LREK,"If the characters are utterly unlikable, why care about their life ? This is a contrived film,  with a transparent plot. The director tries to create suspense,with unworthy characters. Why care?  Applesauce has an unfortunate resemblance to the worst of Woody Allen films, without the humor or notable characterization.  I'm actually embarrassed to admit that I watched the entire film.

My  two cents,anyway.",1467158400,3,409,5.428571428571429

Dark comedy is my favorite type, and Applesauce is a 7 or maybe even an 8 in darkness on a black comedy scale of 1-10. It takes a few minutes to become acclimated to the indie vibe and to realize that some of the humor is subtle or even intellectual, but once you get there you're off to the races. The story builds around two middle-aged Big Apple couples who seem reasonably happy before they have dinner together and a question comes up: ""What's the worst thing you've ever done?"" Circumstances go from bad to worse, with severed body parts and eventually a death entering the equation.

Applesauce writer and director Onur Tukel also portrays husband #1 (Ron). The actors were impeccably cast. If like me you find NYC chix who wear glasses to be irresistible, then you'll be overjoyed by Trieste Kelly Dunn as wife #1 (Nicki) and Jennifer Prediger as wife #2 (Kate). Husband #2 (Les) is played by Max Casella, who has been in front of the camera since back to the Doogie Howser years. Numerous other characters (the actors also well chosen) further enrich the plot, but these four are the ones who drive the narrative.

Ron is a schoolteacher who likes to challenge his students with what many would view as contrarian if not radical ideas (possibly relating to his Turkish heritage, which in itself is the source of some humor when up against the Italian Les). Applesauce pokes fun at the four central characters (especially the husbands for being so childish) while also allowing us to laugh with them and not just at them. The instability of the marriages and the resultant chaos are far more cringe-worthy than the severed body parts.

4.5 stars, not quite 5 because Applesauce is sometimes too self-conscious (and perhaps even self-congratulatory), but if you like black humor and dislike happy endings, this is your cup of poison.",1450742400,2,1858,4.751552795031056
8729020,5,B013W7LREK,"SPOILER: In this very adult black-comedy, a radical high school teacher starts to receive human body parts in the mail, in his laundry and other unexpected places, leading him to believe that someone from his past is trying to get even after a frat-party went terribly wrong, by stalking and terrorizing him many years later.

Without a doubt this is one of the darkest and genuinely funny films I have seen since Todd Solondz's ""Happiness"". While the title has absolutely nothing to do with the movie, at least so it seems, ""Applesauce"" literally assaults the viewer with a barrage of elements, including very adult sexual themes, viciously profane language and some truly startling moments that create genuine cold chills.

I have seen very few films in my lifetime that succeeded in having me laughing out loud, while at other times cringing uncomfortably and being thoroughly creeped out. ""Applesauce"" had me doing all that ... and more. Get this movie and be prepared for a refreshingly original rollercoaster ride of out-of-control horror and comedy.",1449187200,,1056,5.098265895953757
8729021,3,B013W7LREK,"Applesauce,"" directed by Onur Tukel, concerns a married man who is severely tested after a string of twisted, mysterious and frightening events. Every Tuesday night, radio talk show host Stevie Bricks (Dylan Baker) invites his listeners to call in and share the worst thing theyve ever done. Tonight, high school teacher Ron Welz (Onur Tukel) tells his story. Soon after, someone starts sending him severed body parts. Ron becomes paranoid and then terrified. His life begins to unravel. His marriage begins to fall apart. He has no idea whos tormenting him. Is it his insolent high school student? His best friend? His own wife? In a city like New York, there are eight million suspects and each one could have a bone to pick with someone like Ron.

Tukels portrayal of a teacher quick to offer opinions and concoct viewpoints on the fly is amusing. He fancies himself an intellectual scholar, but lacks the required gravitas. Yet despite some sharp writing and a series of clever one-liners, Applesauce meanders off onto numerous tangents and the characters appear contrived as they banter and bicker among themselves, flippantly discussing serious topics. Tukel constructs his scenes with a comic punchline in mind rather than building them naturally. The movie is reminiscent of a Woody Allen comedy with its New York City location, eccentric characters, and humorous look at male-female relationships, but never really sparkles.

Special features on the unrated Blu-ray release include commentary with director Onur Tukel, deleted scenes, blooper reel, and theatrical trailer.",1447891200,3,1581,5.294820717131474
