1019471,5,630541470X,William Shatner explores the theory of the ancient astronauts as he meets & talks with serveral experts. This is a must for anyone interested in this subject. I remember watching this and many others on this subject as a child on TV and was & still am in awe. The possibility is real but are they really out there is the feeling you'll have after viewing this video.,977875200,6,366,4.397058823529412
1019472,5,630541470X,"This is a must for anyone with a love of the camp and bizarre - the documentary explores the theories covered in the books of erich von daniken i.e. that mankind has been visited and influenced by extra terrestrials for  many thousands of years. It seems to have originally been a german  production and has a fairly serious tone but when america released it they  decided to get Bill on board and film some additional scenes which are  priceless! See Bill in the worst wig he ever wore delivering some of his  best lines ever e.g.  ""think about it.....am I being prepared....are  you!"". Watch in awe as Bill interviews some serious fruitcakes from  the seventies that make some crazy predictions (that haven't come true!) -  This is a true hidden gem that you need to buy now and there are some  classic soundbytes for sampling (I used some in some cubase tune to great  effect)",962236800,5,879,4.606451612903226
7888817,4,630541470X,"This is a beautiful piece of 1970's Americana.  William Shatner narrates an Ancient Aliens ""documentary"".  You can almost hear him tell his agent ""This is Bill...If Leonard can do In Search Of, I can do this!"".  His hallmark overacting reaches epic proportions as he feigns interest and concern over the inane babble that the ""experts"" he interviews spout forth.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the video and audio quality are that of a home VHS that recorded it when broadcast over the open airwaves.",1455321600,,524,4.725274725274725
7888818,3,630541470X,"If you are into this type thing. This could of been a good movie, but turned out to be old news.",1371513600,,96,3.619047619047619
7888819,2,630541470X,William Shatner's narrative is not that impressive.  It seems a bit like he is showing off his knowledge too much or maybe he doesn't like doing this gig or something.  VHS quality doesn't help.  I like the subject matter but this one is not my favorite.,1360540800,,254,4.478260869565218
7888820,5,630541470X,I work night shift and can't always sleep during the day. This puts me out every time. Not to say it isn't interesting to watch. The 70's style soundtrack is what puts me to sleep.,1360454400,,180,4.171428571428572
7888821,3,630541470X,"This is essentially an alternate version of Chariots Of The Gods with William Shatner hosting (think Leonard Nimoy-style ""In Search Of..."" complete with mock sincerity).

I like it because of it's sheer cheesiness and unintentional camp humor.

If you laugh at Ancient Aliens and enjoy 70's docs than this is for you, otherwise I'd steer clear!",1356998400,,344,5.125
7888822,5,630541470X,This was a Christmas present for my husband and he loves it.  Received it quickly and in time for Christmas.,1356912000,,108,4.4
7888823,5,630541470X,"This should be in any fan of von Danikens collection,and it covers a lot of mysteries starting with giant humanoid tracks alongside dinosaur tracks in the same strata(100-million years plus old!)Crystal skulls are discussed,with William Shatner interviewing Mitchell-Hedges daughter(very rare footage!)Lots of great footage on location of little-seen sites such as Pohnpei and Baalbek,and several revealing conversations with various scientists and scholars,this is a classic video from the 1970s!",1342569600,3,497,6.217391304347826
7888824,3,630541470X,I like all the von Daniken work and this video features a very young William Shatner which makes the purchase price worth it for this fact alone! It's a bit staged and silly but still good. I am not disappointed at all.,1315008000,,219,4.238095238095238
7888825,5,630541470X,"This so rocks!!! something great to watch wilst eating thanksgiving leftovers.....The man is a legend, please amazon favor us with more hidden Shatner treasures, This in my opinion is cooler to watch the ""Chariots"". On a side note if Amazon could get the old Nimoy ""In search of"" series then they would rule the universe!!!! Or at least sell more cool vids.",1290729600,6,357,4.774193548387097
7888826,4,630541470X,"Technically, the dvd release seems to be about the same quality as the vhs version.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was dubbed from vhs.  There's a missing frame or two in the opening credits.
  I bicycled to the West 11th movie theater in Eugene, Oregon in 1978 or so to see this Shatner opus.  I'm still impressed with the opening shot at the Smithsonian Institute with pre-Star Trek The Motion Picture Shatner standing in front of the original Enterprise model in the Air and Space Museum.  In the days of no new Trek, this was a special treat.  The documentary film on Von Daniken's writings (hope I didn't mispell the name since I've had a Mike's hard lemonade at 3:00a.m.) is interesting throughout and Shatner brings credibility to the hosting chore.  He's continued to improve as an interviewer, as seen in Raw Nerve and Aftermath on the Biography Channel.",1285372800,8,863,4.706666666666667
