8105358,4,B000E3LCV4,"Marsha Pitt's Tapology is a great tap teaching video, a little for the beginner but very much so for the advanced student. Why do I say this when she only teaches 5 basic steps? Because she is actually teaching the way to use those basic steps as a performer! Something that you will deffinately use after you have tapped for a while. The best video for beginners is still Bonnie Franklin's ""I hate to exercise but I love to tap"" because of the way she is an excellent teacher of tap dancing for the beginner, but more than just the basic steps, but also how to put them together for the 3 traditiional standard routines of all time, time step, soft shoe, and waltz clog. BUT, Marsha Pitt puts the very basic steps together in a way that Gene Kelley would have danced them for very entertaining movies, a fast pace where the audience does not recognize those basic steps individually but thinks highly of the performance.",1310256000,3,921,4.520958083832335

It is very basic, but the intention is to teach you a few basics then let you be creative, which is just my style.  I would buy Bonnie Franklin, I hate to excercise, I love to tap, over this one.  Bonnie teaches more steps and is over twice the length of this one and they are the same price.  But if you want to see a more modern style than Bonnie this would be a nice addition.  I own both.  It is always good to have more than one source of learning.",1176076800,8,570,3.93859649122807
