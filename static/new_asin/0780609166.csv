7789363,5,0780609166,"Excellent set of 6 video tapes collecting the brilliant March of Time series which Time Life produced in the forties and fifties.  This set is called 'American Lifestyles' and contains the following tapes :

Show Business : The War Years 1939-1945 (4 episodes)

Show Business : The Post War Years 1946-1950 (5 episodes)

American Fashion and Leisure 1945-1950 (6 episodes)

America's Youth 1940-1950 (5 episodes)

The American Family : The War Years 1941-1945 (5 episodes)

The American Family : The Post War Years 1946-1948 (5 episodes)

If you are not familiar with March of Time, they are newsreels which were typically shown in movie theatres as a bonus to the movie.  They were especially popular during the war years, as most people did not have televisions and so could only follow the war through print or radio.  After the war, they continued making them, and branched off into more pleasant topics.  There is no better slice of life that I know of from this time.  The production values are high throughout, and the direction is surprisingly progressive, for what was a pretty repressed time in American History.  Episodes are not short - they are well developed at approximately 15 minutes each.  Wish they were on dvd, but the video and sound quality are pretty good anyway.

Hard to imagine anyone not enjoying these, but they will hold a special appeal to older folks and baby boomers.  Highly recommended.",1308787200,5,1420,4.9033613445378155
