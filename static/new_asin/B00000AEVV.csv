1198821,4,B00000AEVV,"I liked it overall. I've seen worse. It had me guessing who the killer was, which for me makes it a good movie. I'd recommend giving it a chance rather then ruling it out completely",1420588800,,181,4.2

1198827,1,B00000AEVV,"was ok with it it until about 53-58 minutes and the guy starts with ""I will put things up your butt"", or I will sadistically place you in a place where someone else will put something  in your butt. I realize, ""Thriller"" tab now means some guy is going to to put something up another guys butt. Long ago it was not like that.",1413676800,2,325,4.078125
1198828,2,B00000AEVV,"Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, serial killer... figured this was worth a shot, maybe even one of those found gems. Yeah... no. Clearly not a dime spent on how FBI agents operate, or even cops in general, leading to numerous howlers on procedures. Every character in the movie is eliminated well before the reveal, meaning the killer has to be someone the viewer has not seen - and there's only one possibility. Director Lee must think very little of viewers' thinking abilities. Madsen and Penn can do far better, but I can't fault them here. Poor direction, poor script, and a laughably bad depiction of police procedures. Give it a pass.",1410739200,,636,4.790909090909091
1198829,3,B00000AEVV,"TRAIL OF A SERIAL KILLER is a moody, sometimes incoherent, not always involving, thriller.  Directed by the ubiquitous Damian Lee, it stars Chris Penn (Sean's younger, but not littler, brother) as an FBI agent haunted by a serial killer who has yet to be captured.  After a four year hiatus (which is never really explained), the killer known as ALONE (Penn's character's name spelled backwards) strikes again, this time including a sexy psychiatrist in his schemes.  While I credit the scriptwriter for some intriguing red herrings, the identity of the serial killer is both predictable and rather disappointing.

Penn is no Sean Penn as an actor, that's for sure.  But he possesses an earnestness and conviction that makes his strange character appealing; Michael Madsen (ersatz Bruce Willis wannabe) is once again sleepy eyed and lethargic, and Chad McQueen is all but lost as one of the lovely doctor's patients.  Jennifer Dale is lacking in thespian skills and one wonders what a more accomplished actress could have done with the role.

The ending is way overboard and the resolution rather empty, but there are still some worthwhile moments in this movie.",1105056000,6,1162,5.08421052631579

1198845,1,B00000AEVV,"Where did the FBI agents watching EACH of the patients go?

Even an agoraphobic has to fill out forms and pay a doctor. Likely have to be visited first. VERY likely. In the presence of another.

Did Penn have a vest on or is he just impervious to being shot dead on at 10 feet away?

What was injected into him and why did the effect last 15 minutes?

I could go on for days. I liked Chris and i STILL like Madsen.  But this is awful.",1482969600,,434,3.942528735632184
