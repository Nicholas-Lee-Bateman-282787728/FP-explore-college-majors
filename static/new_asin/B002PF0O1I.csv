8376961,3,B002PF0O1I,"I think ""Eden"" must refer to a place that is quite pristine.  Otherwise, I would say Eden implies a lush place with lots of biodiversity.  That wouldn't quite capture the Arctic North.  This work shows Inuits, polar bears, walruses, seals, especially as they look for food.  It shows that Inuits still wear much fur from these animals.  Even with cabins and cable TV and Monopoly games, they still take resources that have always been in their environment.  A focus of this work is showing adults teaching hunting skills to their young, across species.  The narrator stated that both the polar bear and the walrus take two or three years to raise their young.  Global warming doesn't really come up here, thus the work may seem outdate and insufficiently pessimistic nowadays.  This work isn't as dull as the well-meaning POV doc called ""Arctic Son.""  Still, it may drag on for some viewers.  You could show it in a school science class, for sure.",1419811200,,947,4.783950617283951
