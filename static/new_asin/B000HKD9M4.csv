This is an excellent instruction DVD. Danny Gill does a great job presenting 6 well known pieces. The video is very clear so you can see the action of both hands.

I believe this DVD is targeted at Intermediate level guitarists. Danny goes through each piece a bar at a time. He plays each bar slowly explaining what fingers to use. The pace of the instruction was just right. He has an excellent presentation style. Each of the 6 pieces is covered thoroughly. The DVD runs for 1 hour and 45 minutes.

I did not give it 5 stars because of how the guitar tab is presented. The DVD cover states ""Tablature Included On-Screen For Every Piece."" I interpreted this as the tab will show on the screen during the lesson. This is not the case. The tab is available as a separate menu item which can only be printed one screen at a time. A screen print gives a very small image of the tab. I used a screen capture program to get a full sized image of the tab.

If you ever wanted to play some of the most popular classical guitar pieces this DVD is an excellent way to learn. In my mind ""Leyenda"" alone was worth the purchase price. Highly recommended.",1291248000,,1393,5.069868995633188
