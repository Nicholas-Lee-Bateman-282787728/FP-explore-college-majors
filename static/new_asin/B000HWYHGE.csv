8359327,1,B000HWYHGE,"I was hoping to read a review before I ordered this video because it's very pricey, but I ended up ordering it anyway.  Don't buy it.  The video and sound quality are terrible.  The dancing isn't great, not much of it.  The story is narrated and poor quality animated (clip art?) pictures go in between small snippets of dancing.  Sets are terrible. Music is a mix of cuts of classical music. I'm very sad I wasted the money.",1359676800,,425,4.397435897435898
