8670680,5,B00M8APVK4,"Great movie about pool. It is a little hokey, but still highly enjoyable. I wanted it to see some of the legends of pool during my generation. It was especially nice to see Richie Florence in the movie. We ""almost"" played in Grants Pass, Oregon circa 1965-66. His backers told him to leave the kid alone. I was the smart ass kid challenging him. Fortunately he let me off the hook or he would have tortured me. A nice trip down memory lane for anyone that knew any of these legendary pool players.",1426723200,4,497,4.354838709677419
