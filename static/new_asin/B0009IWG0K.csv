The DVD shows great color and hits most of the roadside attractions. Words and pictures...cannot be beat! If you haven't been to this area---get out of the office and into your car, your van, your motor-home or even your bicycle and move your hind-end right straight to this beautifully breathtaking scenery before it's too late. If you are a history buff or avocational archaeologist or a geology appreciator or a lover of all things natural you are going to LOVE the area this DVD so amply describes.",1346889600,,674,4.625
8061522,5,B0009IWG0K,"Contrary to Utah's Delta County Commission, there's plenty of natural beauty in Utah worth preserving, beyond what's already in national parks. (Sadly, the county folks believe that their commission votes trump federal law in trying to open roadless areas in places like Zion by their own fiat.)

Enough of a rant.

In Utah, getting there is indeed half the fun, especially if it's in southern Utah. Drivine Utah Highway 12 south then west from the west side of Capitol Reef National Park to Bryce Canyon National Park is definitely one of the best drives in America.

You'll never get every camera or camcorder shot on your own, and you don't have to with this DVD.

Just about any Finley-Holiday video will be worth your money. High-quality shooting, good cinematography, informative voice-overs and very fitting musical scoring all add up to make a great series.

Plus, videos in the Finley-Holiday series normally have bonus features, such as sidebar attractions in the area. And, they film in all seasons of the year, something you and I can't do on a single trip.

In other words, if you haven't gone to a particular park yet, Finley-Holiday will be the final thing to get you going. If you have, it's a great souvenir without having to lug a camcorder around yourself.",1136160000,3,1275,4.852534562211981
