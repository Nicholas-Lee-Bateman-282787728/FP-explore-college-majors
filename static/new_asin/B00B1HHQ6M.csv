8560816,5,B00B1HHQ6M,Geroge O'Brien B's were always well done and enjoyable but what a shame that Warner Brothers knew so little about these films that it misnamed actress Virginia Vale as Virginia Hale three times on the packaging!,1498003200,,211,4.888888888888889

8560818,5,B00B1HHQ6M,"Buy this set for MARSHAL OF MESA CITY.  It is, in my opinion, one of the all-time best B-westerns.  An excellent cast and a better than usual plot.  A youthful Henry Brandon (the future Chief Scar in THE SEARCHERS) does a fine turn as the hired gun who double-crosses Leon Ames who hired him to get rid of George O'Brien.  Mary Gordon, (Mrs. Hudson in the Basil Rathbone SHERLOCK HOLMES series) has a good role.

These three 1940 movies are at the end of O'Brien's series for RKO.  They have excellent film and sound quality.  However, when I first put this DVD into my older DVD/VHS combo unit, it said ""Incorrect disc"".  Later, I tried again and this time it worked.

LEGION OF THE LAWLESS is an average western for O'Brien, therefore better than average in comparison to many other
B-westerns.

TRIPLE JUSTICE has a fine cast of your old favorite villains and a pretty good story overall.  But, to me, the story has just too many coincidences that are just too pat.  And George keeps making so many misjudgments!  It's the old story of George being accused of bank robbery at the beginning of the movie and so often foiled in his efforts to clear himself until the movie ends.  The trio of girl singers is enjoyable.

Virginia Vale is ""the girl"" in all three of these movies but her name is misspelled Hale on the back cover of the case.",1480032000,2,1340,4.479338842975206
8560819,5,B00B1HHQ6M,"The westerns of actor George O'Brien (a John Ford stock company player nicknamed ""The Chest"" by female filmgoers in the 1930s and '40s) and director David Howard are every bit as good as the collaborations of James Stewart & Anthony Mann and Randolph Scott & Budd Boetticher. In other words, they are classics of the genre, excellent on every level. My favorite of the series is included in this set: ""The Marshal of Mesa City."" It's a B-plus western with Leon Ames as a corrupt sheriff using a gang of cutthroats to swindle the townsfolk and control the headstrong schoolteacher (frequent O'Brien co-star, the lovely and talented Virginia Vale). O'Brien's affable hero has charm, good humor and an old-fashioned code of honor that makes him truly enjoyable to watch. The sequence in which he catches gunslinger Henry Brandon (so memorable as ""Scar"" in Ford's classic,  ""The Searchers"") off-guard simply by treating him with respect and decency is just one of its great moments.  ""Marshal of Mesa City"" is one of three winners in this beautifully restored package! If you're a fan of shoot-'em-ups, this belongs in your collection. -- Uncle Mickey",1479945600,,1147,5.0

8560823,5,B00B1HHQ6M,5 Star b-Westerns watchable for adults and kids. O'Brien was a terrific Western star who should have made more of these but heroic WWII commitments interruped his career.,1419638400,4,170,5.107142857142857
8560824,5,B00B1HHQ6M,"George O'brien had a fine career in movies. He gained fame in John Ford's silent epic, The Iron Horse.  He also starred in one of the last great silent films, Sunrise, which was not a western. In the  30's he starred in some of the best low budget westerns made, for Fox and RKO. This set contains 3 good examples of his work. especially ""The Marshall of Mesa City."" The transfers are very good, and the films are enjoyable. His films were not just for ""front row"" kids but had qualities for adults. As usual, service from Amazon is the best.
