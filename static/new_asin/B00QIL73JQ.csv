8691424,5,B00QIL73JQ,"Classy, lovingly filmed adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Victorian classic novel. Memorable tragedy of a poor country girl's romances and sufferings after being told she is related to nobility. Well directed, subtle approach to Hardy's themes of rising and falling fortune, cruel fate, social status, and the clash of the natural and innocent, the pagan vestiges of rural life against the modernizing, intolerant, industrial world. Breathtaking photography, and atmospheric use of weather makes nearly the entire film looking like a rustic English painting. Nastassia Kinski is absolutely perfect as the title character, her large expressive eyes and red lips make her completely believable as a naive, yet defiant child of nature. Perhaps my favourite Gothic romance film adaptation. The 2008 BBC version is also recommended, as it tackles the dying rural culture and pagan and nature themes very directly. All versions of Far From The Madding Crowd (especially the 1967 film), and the 1981 movie of John Fowles' novel The French Lieutenant's Woman are also recommended. A beautiful tragedy -perfect for fans of Masterpiece Theater and Gothic romance novels. This Blu ray contains plenty of making-of documentaries and interviews.",1530403200,,1227,5.531914893617022
