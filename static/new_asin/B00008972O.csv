1829314,4,B00008972O,"Killing Me Softly is one of those movies in which you can only watch it once, but it holds a spot. Alice (Heather Graham) has a ordered life. She works for a company in which she makes discs for games. On one morning, she meets a total stranger Adam (Joseph Fiennes). For that split second, she falls in love. They go back to his place and fool around passionatly. The sex scenes, are pretty good for a direct video release. After that she lives with him, and one day, he asks her to marry him. They get married at his familys own church. They go hiking for their honeymoon (not very romatic).
After this happens, Alice gets letters from a person saying ""How fare will you let him go""? She begins to question if he really is a sweet man or a violent man. Clues begin to happen through out the movie. Killing me softly, is rated ""R"" for strong sexualtity and nudity, some violence, and brief language. Their is an UNRATED VERION in which that is the one I have bought. The only thing different between the two versions, and there is more nudity. People say this a Thriller. I think it is a Light Thriller. I would have given it 5 stars, but there wasn't enough thrills. Final Verdict 0-10
Story- 8
Sexuality/Nudity- 10
Thrills/Suspense- between 6 and 7

1829315,5,B00008972O,I'm so surprised so few people have heard about this film.  It is a nice relief from action and war films.  For me it was a great thriller coupled with well orchestrated sexual scenes ending with somewhat of a twist.  I would highly recommend it for those movie fans who can't resist a who did it movie and some sexual fantasy.,1049760000,15,327,4.327868852459017
1829316,5,B00008972O,"My vote is not based on the movie compared to the movie industry as a whole, It is based on the B movie industry. Which means the budget is low and the expectations are low too.
Heather Graham is great, beautiful, and very revealing so I highly recommend it to Her fans.
The plot is interesting and the acting in general is pretty good. Again you are buying a sexy movie not a blockbuster.",1049328000,14,389,4.27027027027027
1829317,4,B00008972O,"Wow! wow! wow! If I could this entire review would be filled with the word wow! Here is a movie I wasn't to sure about. I had heard so much bad word-of-mouth. But, I NEVER like to pay attention to public opinion concerning movies.
 ""Killing Me Softly"" is the American debut of Chen Kaige. One of my favorite modern filmmakers. And the movie stars Heather Graham, one of my favorite modern actresses. She has such an appealing presense onscreen. I find her so likeable in all the movies she's been in, even the ones I don't like. And often I feel that she's better than the movies she's appeared in. Movies like ""Austin Powers 2"", ""Say It Isn't So!"", & ""Commited"" I didn't like, but watch her in the Woody Allen-ish ""Sidewalks of New York"", ""From Hell"", and the Steve Martin comedy ""Bowfinger"". She is quite amusing.
 ""Killing Me Softly"" is about an American in London. She is in an secure relationship with a man who loves her very much and even plans on marrying her. But, one day as fate would have it, she meets Adam (Joseph Fiennes). And soon an instant attraction follows. But, it does deeper than that. An affair begins.
 Now does ""Killing Me Softly"" have loop holes? You bet! And plenty of them. The whole beginning of the movie may cause such confusion to some viewers they may not even want to finish watching it. For example, the way Alice and Adam meet is not handle well at all. The affair happens so quickly we are shocked! Hey, slow down there. And a scene dealing with marriage is campy and doesn't seem sincere. But, I gave the movie a chance and all of a sudden I was hooked. I managed to excuse all of it's faults. And when I just sat back and relaxed I found I enjoyed the picture.
 Now, I don't mean to lead people on that everyone will enjoy this movie. Because I know they won't. One of the main reasons I enjoy the film is due to my admiration for Kaige and Graham. And some Kaige fans might not even like this movie because they will feel that Kaige is out of his range here. You see, for those who don't know, Kaige usually makes historical period pieces. Films like ""The Emperor and the Assassin"", ""Temptress Moon"" and ""Farewell My Concubine"". But, like I said, I guess I was blinded. And true filmbuffs will say that this movie is trying to become the new Saturday late night soft core porn version of Hichcock's ""Suspicion"". It does play around with the same ideas. So, only if your a diehard fan of Kaige and you like Graham do I suggest seeing this movie. Others I'm afraid won't like it. Now, all I have to do is see the ""unrated version"".
 Bottom-line: Not one of Chen Kaige's best films, but an entertaining one nonetheless. Heather Graham as usually turns in a nice performance and the film does achieve some nice moments. Works mostly if your a fan of the star and the director.",1049155200,27,2813,4.4123314065510595
1829318,1,B00008972O,"I believe the word 'guff' was invented specifically to sum up this film. I felt like I was watching an episode of Hollyoaks Late, but with a lower production value.
It possesses the entertainment value of a sloth on sedatives, and is about as beleivable as Saddam Husseins good citizen award.",1044316800,13,292,4.745098039215686
1829319,2,B00008972O,"""Killing Me Softly"" is not that Roberta Flack song Hugh Grant sang on stage in ""About a Boy.""  It is the film version of thriller of the same name written by Nicci French (a pen name of husband-wife team Nicci Gerrard and Sean French).  But what is most attractive is not the origin of the film; it is the first English-speaking film by the critically acclaimed Chinese director Chen Kaige, known for his masterpieces like ""Farewell My Concubine"" and ""Yellow Earth.""  And this thriller set in modern London stars Heather Graham and Jeseph Fiennes (credits in that order), plus Natascha McElhone (""Ronin"") and special appearance of Ian Hart (the first ""Harry Potter"") .  So, you ask me, why should I give only two stars?  Wait a minute, please, but I tell you the story first.

Heather Graham is Alice, an American, living in London for 18 months and working as a web site designer there.  She has an English boyfriend (who watches football games on TV), but one morning on her way to office she meets Joseph Fiennes's world-famous mountain climber Adam when Alice accidentally touches his hand, waiting for the signal on the street.  She instantly falls in love with him madly; even in her office she cannot shake off his image; and finally she follows him, goes to his house, and just wants him.  All these things happen in about 5 hours of a day.

And they get married.  But soon Alice learns that she does not know anything about his past, not surprisingly.  Then, anonymous letters warning her about him start to come.  Then, Alice begins to suspect that Adam, behind his wild character, is trying to hide some horrible secret that might be connected with the terrible accident that happened on the mountain.  Or is that really an accident?

OK.  This is a thriller which uses a premise: ""Can you trust your husband?""  Yes, once Hitchcock did it (the title should remain unnamed, but you might remember that breathtaking car-running-by-the-cliff scene).  For the reasons below, ""Killing Me Softly"" never achieves that height.  The film is thrill-free, and is saddled with incredible plot and creaky dialogues.  I don't like to talk like this especially when I like Heather Graham very much, but before I write this review, I checked it on video, and sorry, but I cannot still change my mind.  (I am a Japanese, and was lucky to see the film earlier than many people in the world as the film was theatrically released here in Feb. 2002, one year before American release).  Yes, thrill is gone.

What happened?  Joseph Fiennes does his best, so does Heather Graham, but there is no chemistry between them that might make us believe in their love-turns-fear relation.  Furthermore, the director Chen Kaige is too intent on portraying the sex scenes of them, many of them describing ... how do you say in English ... a sort of kinky stuff.  (So, if you really want to see my point, see the unrated version.)  Besides, what can we audience do but giggle when we see usually great Fiennes holds a poor panting goldfish on his palm, to illustrate the lack of oxygen up among the high mountains?  Or when Heather is mugged in the street of London, robbed of her bag, and Fiennes chases the robber desperately, hits the guys's head against the telephone booth (breaking the glass), and beats the hapless criminal (but which?) to pulp?  And see what they would do after that (I keep that part secret for you).  In short, everything is too unbelievable, even by the standard of melodrama or potboiler.

There is, however, some good points about the film.  The photography is very beautiful, capturing the lively feelings of the streets of London, and it is no so-called ""postcard"" beauty.  British photographer Micheal Coulter is famous for his works like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" ""Notting Hill,"" and ""Sense and Sensibility"" and his London is strangely other-worldly feeling, I mean, totally different London.  The film is always stylish, and the soundtrack is by Patrick Doyle even though his music (good itself) tends to hammer as if to instruct us what to feel.

It is cruel to say this, I know, but ""Killing Me Softly"" is, considering the talent involved, a great disappointment.  The film may gain a cult status, and if you ask me whether I like it or not, I say I like it.  But will I recommend this to my friends?  No.

One last curious thing; one of the executive-producers is Ivan Reitman (""Evolution"" ""Twins"" and others).",1043712000,120,4429,4.74738219895288

The movie gave us less than half an hour of what we wanted (the soft-core porn) and the rest was a less-than-thrilling thriller. Heather Graham is way too cute and vapid to fill the lead role. She was very awkward during the love scenes. Joseph Fiennes, on the other hand, was smoldering. I've seen several of his movies. With the exception of Shakespeare In Love, most have been pretty bland rom coms. But, he was born to play a role like this. He is passionate and sexy, but also tender and loving even while exploring light bondage. His sheer grief when Alice leaves him caused me to feel more empathy for him than her, even despite his somewhat obsessive tendencies. With a stronger leading lady, the love story and passion may have been more believable. The end of the movie was pretty much a waste of time. Alice gets very worked-up over ""mysterious"" notes and phone calls she receives about her new husband. It was hardly as engrossing as the soundtrack would lead you to believe.

Heather Graham in particular is quite weak in her role.  Her very few facial expressions make her look more like a frowning kewpie doll rather than a woman tormented by passion for a man she fears.  Joseph Fiennes is better but for some reason he can't fully grasp the material either.

1829448,4,B00008972O,"Crazy, animal sex.

I received this from Amazon yesterday and watched it last night.  I already knew what I was getting into after reading about 'Killing Me Softly'. But, reviews from critics and viewers mean nothing in the end because, it all boils down to opinion. And everyone's got one.

My opinion:  I liked it.  Sometimes, we women just want to see some skin, too.  My motivation for buying this wasn't to see Heather Graham naked.  She could've been dressed the whole time as far as I'm concerned and it would make no difference. The main reason I got this can be summed up in three words:  Joseph Fiennes.  Naked.

Having been in a situation almost 90% like Adam and Alice, I 'got' the movie. The only difference was that we shared more than a cab ride and six words and I didn't marry him.

And, let's face it ladies, if Joseph or a man that looked like him opened the cab door with that dark, brooding, feral look, resistance would be pretty futile. If that's all he did the whole movie, I still would have been happy. One of my favorite scenes was the autoerotic asphyxiation with the silk scarves. Yeah, I thought it was hot. Maybe because I'm just slightly on this side of crazy? No. Not really. I think the the whole 'it's not normal, so it must be wrong' bit is pretty absurd.  As long as it's done safely and consensually, I don't see a problem.  But when a man is that passionate, surely there's anger just below the surface.  In fantasy, it does the job.  But, in real life, we know it almost never works out with a happy ending.  What a pity.

Adam Tallis, played by Joseph Fiennes, is a famous mountain climber with dark secrets in his past. He's controlling and somewhat sadistic but a very passionate and tortured individual. When he meets Alice, played by Heather Graham, the sparks fly. He only knows her first name and she knows nothing about him.  But that doesn't stop them from giving into that instant, sizzling chemistry. No, it's not love at first sight. I don't think it's possible.  Lust, however, is a whole different story.

Alice and Adam eventually get married when Alice starts receiving some disturbing notes about Adam. She starts getting suspicious and goes snooping in his locked cabinet and finds old love letters from Adele, who's been missing for 8 months. Then another woman, Michelle, accused him of rape some years back. It wasn't confirmed in the movie but if I had to go on Adam's anger, possessiveness and the need for power, I'm leaning towards a 'yes' on the rape.

One of Adam's darkest secrets, in my opinion, was his sister, Deborah. It wasn't the accusation of rape and murder that turned my stomach. It was the fact that Adam and Deborah had more than sibling rivalry going on between them when they were younger. That made her possessive of Adam, thinking that since they had shared the bed, she owned him always. Just another sick, twisted perversion.

Some downsides:  I didn't like the music.  When I saw the trailer on the 'Special Features', I wondered why they didn't use that music instead.  Being the Enigma Freak that I am, I would've loved to have heard some 'Mea Culpa', 'Sadeness' or even 'I Love you...I'll Kill You'. But, then again, I think Enigma fits with everything. The movie moved along too fast for my tastes.  I wanted more back story to Adam's life.  Why was he a sadist?  What made him want to do the things he did?  Why did he have trust issues?  What happened in his past to leave him so emotionally scarred?  Did the shared incest make his outlook on women turn negative? I'm willing to bet that it did.  I'd be willing to cut a sex scene or two--minus the silk scarf scene--if they had added 20 minutes extra to delve into the rape, murders and Adele and Adam's story. I understood enough from Alice that I needed no more into her life. I love a mysterious man, but when he's too mysterious, it's easy to get suspicious.  Adam just wanted Alice's trust.  But why?  What was he hiding?

I give an overall 4 stars because all in all, I wanted to see Fiennes in all his dark, brooding, grunting glory.  And because, sometimes, you just want to watch movies like this. Purely for erotic entertainment.

1829449,5,B00008972O,"I am puzzled by some of the very critical reviews here. I would not describe this as ""softcore"" erotica, but as a somewhat erotic thriller. Heather Graham is luminously beautiful, both when clothed and nude. The sex scenes are somewhat titillating, more so (I suppose) if you like to see the male controlling the woman while being a bit out of control himself (not my cup of tea). Being a heterosexual male, I find Ms. Graham's body to be absolutely stunning, and would never tire of seeing her nude. But there is plenty of tension here, in this thriller tale.

Killing Me Softly begins like any normal film, progresses into its plot slowly, and just when you think everything is Happily Ever After, the twists and suspense come in. I think Hitchcock would approve of the suspense & surprising twists in this movie. The acting is very good, and the story is very intriguing. The trailer sets it all up. The movie provides the fun. The music is by the always reliable Patrick Doyle. I recommend this movie.

She discovers some mysterious circumstances that are becoming increasingly disturbing to her. Adam is attentive but quite aloof. The climax presented a very interesting twist that left me wondering weather Adam was really sincere,trustworthy or needing therapy. On the other hand Alice may have been painting an unsettling picture by continuing to investigate in lieu of attempting to open conversations with Adam. Also Adam had a sister whom I suspected was not all she appeared to be.

Now, I'm really easy to please when it comes to movies. But lest anyone wonder why Heather Graham is a one-flick wonder, look no further than ""Killing Me Softly."" Her portrayal of the complex heroine created in the French novel (on which the movie was based) is downright wretched. In the book, Alice is complex -- torn, thoughtful and mature as she subtly comes to doubt Adam's character. In the film version, Graham putzes around looking embarrassingly gauche as she tries to mold Roller Girl into a semblance of something savvy. Instead, she ends up coming across as a giggly, histrionic goof with bad taste in clothes. Fiennes does a superb job with a stinker of a script, and this only acts as a foil to Graham's lack of ability to channel her own character. The sex scenes are just about as erotic as a ""Girls Gone Wild"" teaser, but not for lack of trying. As others have mentioned, there is absolutely zero chemistry between the leads.

The French novel had a different and more believable ending, and had the film stuck with the original plot, it would have been far more powerful. It is also a psychological thriller, which are incredibly difficult to translate into film unless you have really great actors and a dazzling script. ""Killing Me Softly"" could have been a much better film with some tweaking and a different female lead. What a shame -- and what a bore.",1291248000,,1517,4.639405204460966

She also impulsively marries this dark, intense man only to find out that all his girlfriends end up dead or missing. Is Adam a murderer?

I had a hard time feeling much sympathy for Alice, since she seems selfish and has no sense whatsoever. She likes Adam because he's dangerous and lives on the edge, but it's obvious that their relationship is based on lust, not love, and will burn itself out.

There is a ""twist"" at the end, but I've seen similar stuff in other thrillers, and it just lands with a thud. It's just goofy.

The only reason to see this is if you want to see Graham and Fiennes naked. But even the sex scenes feel staged and passionless.",1221177600,2,1295,4.502127659574468

This is one horrendous, misguided film that has some of the worst dialogue and bad performances from otherwise rather good and reasonably successful actors. That Joseph Fiennes and Natashsa McElhone worked in this is a travesty. That Heather Graham starred in it comes as a given!

Alice (Graham) is an American living in London already into a safe six-month comfortable relationship with a pretty nice guy. On her way to work,while pressing the crosswalk light, she touches hands with Adam (Fiennes) and all sense leaves the head and all blood rushes to the crotch....AND THAT IS WHERE THIS FILM STAYS!That McElhone ,as Adam's sister is a smarmy and seductive throw -in to this mess only serves to make things more laughable. That rough,kinky sex is thrown in just makes this all the more ridiculous, especially when Grahm is tied down,ready to ravaged by Fiennes, and she numbly states,""Adam,I have to pee"".(Are you getting the gist of this?)

Why 2 stars? Patrick Doyle composed a wonderful soundtrack,just as he always does! Take the soundtrack away and ONE STAR or lower!

There are two conclusions that I leave with:
1. Chen Kaige,returned to his homeland and took back his given name and made Chinese films.
2. Joseph Fiennes and Natasha McElhone both went on to play better roles more becoming of their true abilities They needed  a paycheck like anyone else!

1829499,4,B00008972O,"""Killing Me Softly"" is one of those movies that you can't help but like despite the uneven plot and silly twists that come with this kind of movie. Not made for serious film watchers and critics, this movie is more for the MTV generation and is in the same league of ""Wild Things"" and ""Cruel Intentions"".

However, as perverted as this may sound, this film easily features some of the best sex scenes ever to be captured in a commerical film. Heather Graham plays Alice. Alice is an American living in England who designs websites and CD roms for a living and lives with Jake. She loves Jake and feels comfortable around him, but overall she's not satisfied. Then in a few seconds her life changes. While crossing a street, she catches the eye of Adam (Joseph Fiennes) and before they've barely uttered a word they're at his apartment having passionate sex. Soon after, she leaves Jake and moves in with Adam and soon after that...She marries him. Everything's great for a while, until disturbing things begin to happen. She recieves letters, meets a woman who claims that Adam raped her, and finds letters from a lover of Adam's who has disappeared. If you have any knowledge of movies, you can pretty much see where this is going. Wife is scared of husband and tries to unravel whether her husband really is a murderer and is simply not satisfied with what she finds, so she delves deeper into the mystery only to discover something a bit more disturbing. Simply insert a couple different names and you have a story that (for the most part) has been told several times before. But, I hate to admit it but I did like this movie and it was worth the 96 minutes I spent watching it. While it's not a classic piece of cinema, it's entertaining.

A good script and interesting story is of course very important in any film, but the emotion of the performers must be felt for any of that to matter.  ""Killing Me Softly"" just didn't seem to have that push and pull from the cast.  I am a Heather Graham fan and I will say that she exuded a pleasant cuteness that can and will draw you in, if you let it.  I just never bought the love she supposedly felt for Joseph Fiennes.  I never bought that she was so bored with her life that a risky affair seemed necessary.  The affair begins so quickly and with so little buildup that she seems to be more of a wh*re than a lovestruck, bored woman.

1829516,5,B00008972O,"Perhaps I got wrapped up in the sex scenes, it was easy to do but I thought this was a first rate well done soft porn movie, perhaps the best I've seen. Killing Me Softly opens a sensuous window into the highly erotic coupling and de-coupling (literally and metaphorically) of two most attractive individuals. Though this movie failed to capture the imagination of most movie reviewers, it did capture mine!

Though there are many actors in this movie, it is centered on and revolves around the trinity of Adam, Alice and Deborah (Adam's sister). Alice is a normal girl with a live in boyfriend and a good eight to five job, that is until, on the way to work one morning, she runs into Adam.

Adam (Joseph Fiennes) and Alice (Heather Graham) meet at a crosswalk, while she's waiting to cross the street to work. Their eyes lock, Adam smiles and Alice is smitten. Within two minutes, after a taxi ride to Adam's home, with animalistic urgency, our lustful pair is energetically copulating on the living room floor. Is this a courtship made in heaven? I don't think so. Alice didn't even find out his name until the next day, when she went over to a book store across the street from where she works, where she had seen him in the previous day and found out he's the subject of a book, a famous a famous mountain climber, Adam Tallis.

After a couple of penetrating sexual-therapy sessions and after dumping her dumpy live in boyfriend, Alice returns for another encore and meets Adam's sister Deborah (Natascha McElhone), who looks suspiciously like a young Jane Seymour. After some pleasant enough girlie talk she sends Alice off the Adam's real house. It seems Adam was using her flat while she was out of town.

Soon the newly free Alice moves in with Adam and their romance blossoms and they are in love but then she gets what appears to be a crank letter and that gets her thinking, what does she know about Adam and then there's that padlocked closet in his bedroom.

After, Adam saves an overwhelmed and grateful Alice from a mugger, she agrees to get hitched but even after their marriage the letters keep coming and then she finds out that Adam's girlfriend was killed in a climbing accident. All of a sudden Alice is in a panic trying to find out everything she can about the man she's married to.

SUMMARY

One has to wonder whether this is a thriller with a wildly erotic undertone woven in or a pleasantly erotic film with a suspenseful base. I think of it as the latter. The film, at one hundred minutes, seems to move quite well with no flat spots and the actors appear to be well suited for their parts. Fiennes did an excellent job of portraying a serious, intense individual with a powerful personality. One could understand why the slightly nave, sensitive character of Alice would gravitate to the overpowering personality of Adam. Graham and McElhone also nailed their respective parts of Alice and the sister Deborah.

I also thought the director did a good job although to hear a lot of the critics, you think he failed miserably, in fact of the critics of moviedom only about twenty percent gave this movie a favorable rating overall.

CONCLUSION

Sorry I'm going to respectfully agree to disagree with the critics and reviewers. There is just too much passionate lusty sex and too much nudity to not consider this film Softcore and in comparison to the many other Softcore movies I've seen, this should be up for a Softcore Academy Award.

If you're wondering why you never saw this movie in the theater(I'm speaking to American readers), it's because after showing in theaters in Europe and elsewhere it was released directly on DVD in the states.",1117584000,67,3672,4.659969088098918
1829517,5,B00008972O,"Dramatic Thriller - contains nudity and some bondage/breath control.
DVD: Unrated version, DVD contains both Full-Screen & Wide-Screen.  Other than the film itself, the DVD also has a Special Features section which has the film's Trailer and some other MGM trailers.

The film stars Heather Graham (as Alice; License to Drive, Boogie Nights), Joseph Fiennes (as Adam; Elizabeth, Shakespeare in Love, The Merchant of Venice), and Natascha McElhone (as Deborah; Ronin, Solaris, Laurel Canyon, TV: Revelations).  The film is directed by Chen Kaige (Yellow Earth, Farewell My Concubine, Mo gik), and is based on the book by Nicci French.

The movie is about Alice and Adam falling in love, and a jealous sister.  Alice and Adam instantly fall in love, and Alice hurriedly leaves her current living together relationship to move in with Adam.  After a very quick courtship, they get married, but very quickly Alice begins to become suspicious about Adam's past, helped along by some comments by Adam's sister Deborah and some anonymous notes left for her.  Oh, and the movie is narrated by Alice and some man (it is later revealed what that narration is about).

The movie opens with Adam up on a snowy mountain climb and Alice living with a man and noting how boring her life has become in London.  Relatively quickly, Alice livens up her life when she bumps into Adam, and they both have an instant spark.  Alice continues into her work building and Adam continues to a bookstore.  That bookstore is selling Adam's new book, about his mountain climbing experiences that includes a death that occurred on his most recent climb. Conveniently, the bookstore was right outside Alice's office building.  Eventually Alice leaves the building, spots Adam, and they get into a taxi together to go to Adam's apartment for some mid-afternoon excitement.

Rather quickly Adam and Alice marry, and rather quickly it is revealed that Adam likes to tie up, and/or control the breathing of his partners, and Alice seems to like this type of activity.  Don't want to get too detailed, but Alice quickly becomes suspicious of Adam's past and future plans, and investigates some negative allegations made about Adam.

I believe that this was the director's first American film, after finding success over in Asia (I believe in China or maybe Hong Kong; he was born in Beijing China).  The film flopped at the box office, and was not well received by the critics.  Oddly enough, I quite enjoyed the film and after I had watched it the first time, tried to search out similar films, without luck.",1114992000,3,2573,4.946511627906977

There's a lot of fade-outs which get kind of annoying after a while, but the background music is great and suspenseful.  Of course this is not a serious movie; nor is it a world-class thriller.

1829522,4,B00008972O,"This film is quite gripping in many ways, but particularly so in one : it tricks us into believing something that is nothing but a preconceived idea. Love may be a very strong, sudden and even violent passion. It is shown in all its splendor and beauty. When love becomes passionate it can lead to extreme adventures, and in this film it does, though moderately for the audience not to be unsettled too much. Just enough for the audience to believe that this passion can lead the man, who is becoming suspicious and jealous, to dream of, and to have dreamed of and even performed, a crime or even several to prevent a woman, or maybe several, from going away, abandoning him. So why not another one. The present wife of this man galops into this avenue without even thinking or pondering the issue one single minute : after all it is nothing but the rewriting or the remake of Blue Beard. Panick and fear. And of course she runs into the arms of the real criminal, the one who has really eliminated so many women, out of jealousy of course. But the real end is more than ambiguous. Passion is transient and cannot last very long. Sooner or later it wears out and it does in this case, of course, after such a fright. So the ending is sad though we may feel relieved. Such men who inspire extreme and total love must be rejected and isolated. A sign that our world is not standing on its feet. But the suspense is quite well built if you just try to let yourself be taken along by the story and not to anticipate what may be coming, the end in other words.

You could actually see where the snow-blowers were blasting the little flakes of ""cotton balls?"" from behind the trees.  Some of the ""snow"" even got caught in the actors' hair, making them look like they were being attacked by dust bunnies.  It was ridiculous.  So, why didn't I give this 1 star?  Well, some of the individual acting was okay.  Just ""okay.""  And I appreciated the feeble attempt at a remake of the Hitchcock classic ""Suspicion.""  Other than that, this movie is thin, plastic, and cleverly targeted an obviously susceptible demographic: me.  Do not watch this film.",1076198400,135,1377,4.779661016949152
1829531,2,B00008972O,"Both actors didn't catch much of my attention. The story was the usual ""man tricks woman in"" story. I thought that you could guess most of the movie, so there wasn't much surprise. I haven't read Nicci French's book to tell how close this movie was to the expectation that the book might have given. The movie was ok but not particularly great.",1074729600,,344,4.476190476190476
1829532,2,B00008972O,"I hate being critical of this film because I love B movies, but this movie is bad.  Really bad.  Heather Graham is a beautiful woman, especially nude, but other than that this movie has nothing going for it.  The acting is terrible, the plot is terrible, and the nudity is nothing you can't get from Boogie Nights.  The only reason this movie gets two stars is becuase Heather Graham does great in the sex scenes despite the director failing to focus on her sensuality and just settling on getting her naked.",1073606400,6,508,4.549450549450549
1829543,1,B00008972O,"I really wanted to like this movie: I love the cast and location and I hadn't seen a really good ""erotic thriller"" in a long time.  In fact, I don't know if I've ever seen a truly great erotic thriller.  BASIC INSTINCT and other studio attempts come off as glossy, dense and pretentious and the late-night cable TV B-movies barely qualify as movies.
But I wasn't even sure WHAT I was watching at different points with KILLING ME SOFTLY.  I wanted to give it more stars just based on Joseph Fiennes and Natascha McElhorne, but I wouldn't want to mislead anyone that this was a good movie  Just because this time around it's beautiful people in a movie, we still need some characters here.
But by then, the mystery/thriller plot kicks in: has Graham rushed into a marriage with a sullen thrill-seeker or a heartless killer?  I'd pretty much figured out what was really going on so early on that, when the truth was revealed, I had to remember, ""Oh, that's right--I'd already figured it out.""
The hot ""passion"" between this couple cools to make way for the plot instead of becoming part of it.  What if Fiennes' sex gets riskier as Graham's suspicion grows?  The same irresponsible passion that got Graham into this mess now also clouds her ability to find out the truth.
I don't know how the novel read, but the characters fall into the grooves of the ""erotic thriller plotline.""
Maybe I'm asking too much.  I know this cast deserved better.
Most of it's so well filmed that you forget you're watching a storyline normally played out with titles like NIGHT EYES 4 on ""Skin-a-max"" at 2:00am.
The one positive thing I can definitely say about this movie: Heather Graham looks great naked.",1070409600,6,1684,4.646464646464646
1829544,2,B00008972O,"It's a pity that such a brilliant screenplay should've been thrown to such a thud ending.
The movie starts with an amazing pace, the cinematography plush with its Londonscapes, and each scene pregnant with that suspenseful tension (both sexual and otherwise) -- we can sense that behind those hyperactive bedsheets something is afoot as a mountaineer falls in passionate love with a citygirl web designer. They marry in a couple of days and bells are achiming, birds are afluttering etc etc, until the woman receives an anonymous note ""It was a mistake to marry him."" Everything in the film, up until the last 15 minutes is nail-biting (although much more has been bitten on the screen I may as well add.)
But then, we get treated to an abysmal gyp: the person behind the whole intrigue and suspense was THE most predictable one in the entire plot, for THE most predictable (and doozy) reason conceivable.
The voyeurism here borders almost on soft-porn, eye-in-the-hole viewers take note. The screenplay is something to use in film schools, marvellous. The cinematography is stupendous. But the writer should've been fired before he ruined it all.
2/5 material, 1 point each for Fiennes and Graham, who will definitely be on my watch-list from now on! But I hope they'll quickly scoot past this utter tripe of a B-grade film.",1069632000,7,1325,4.919642857142857

A perfect combo for the popcorn movie enthusiast: beautiful locations (vibrant London and the English countryside), beautiful clothing (Heather Graham and Joseph Fiennes are always in ultra chic duds!), and beautiful people in the buff. Chen Kaige has a wonderful visual style (see Yellow Earth, Farewell My Concubine, and his latest, Together among others). He understands the use of colors and landscapes. This film is definitely millions of miles away from his Chinese language films in content but his visual style is still present.

1829550,2,B00008972O,"Here's something you don't see every day: a laugh-out-loud murder mystery. Too bad the laughs are unintentional. This is one of those films that is so terrible that it's actually fun to watch. The big question is what are three talented actors (Joseph Fiennes, Heather Graham, and Natascha McElhone) doing in this overheated attempt at a ""stylish erotic thriller""? All three actors struggle admirably to inject some depth and passion into roles that are little more than transparent cliches, as they are forced miserably to utter lines of dialogue that seem to have been clipped at random from a screenplay-writing textbook. The actors probably agreed to make this film because, after reading the script, they thought it would be provocative and disturbing; unfortunately the result is simply embarrassing. I give this film two stars instead of one only out of respect for how hard these poor actors worked to salvage something from this pitiful mess. At times you can almost see them thinking ""What have I gotten myself into?"" ...",1053993600,7,1031,5.070588235294117

The dialogue must have been rescued from the waste basket of a B movie writer reject.  As for satisfying our prurient desires it doesn't rise to the occasion what with the high school amateur acting, ridiculous and predictable plot ... you get my drift.

1829552,2,B00008972O,"I enjoy a good suspense - but with this one, the focus and emphasis was on the sexual autobiography of a home girl planted in London, not a true suspense like ""Deceived"".  I was very disappointed in the acting, except for Joseph Fiennes, who was good, and the one who played her boyfriend in the beginning. Heather Graham, while she is visually stunning, (loved the clothes), was vapid, weak, and off,- there are too many scenes where the vulnerability in her character was not played out right. I would have preferred her depth and passion outside the sex scenes, (in which she put way too much contrived energy - it unbalanced the whole film.)  The city and apartment scenery was just right - I loved that.  I gravitated toward the scenes that were more understated, but yet packed some punch, like the cigarette snuffed out in the ashtray (someone is watching), the sihlouette in the darkness with cigarette smoke, the cat named Mr. Know It All.
