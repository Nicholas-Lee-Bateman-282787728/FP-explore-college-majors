3058742,1,B0011367V6,"They talk about parts/muscle groups one has never heard from.  I've gone through all 4 DVDs.

A waste of money!  If you have already taken theses classes to know what they are talking about, you are in the dark.

If you took a beginner class which teaches what all the terms are, then get this.  If you are unable to afford those VERY expensive classes, you will be watching it and feel like you're in a Calculus class.

I'm now stuck with this set.  Not happy.  I went back to the old fashioned gym in the apt building.

These are for the ADVANCED persons who've already taken the classes and can understand what they are talking about! Disappointing!",1265241600,5,652,4.4576271186440675
3058743,5,B0011367V6,"These DVDs are great for everyday use. The yoga hits all my problem areas (hamstrings, shoulders, back, hips) and the pilates gives you a good, tough, well-rounded core work-out. For an absolute 100% beginner, it may be a bit fast at first, but they offer alternatives, and you can always sit out of certain moves until you get the hang of it.",1248825600,12,343,4.548387096774194

8239979,5,B0011367V6,the best- i literally got cut using these videos,1504483200,,48,4.444444444444445
8239980,4,B0011367V6,"After using this video set for several years - and now having some others to compare it to - I finally feel ready to write a review.  I *really* wish this was still ""in print"" and more broadly available, because I really do think this is a great set and I've recommended it to others many times through the years.

What's great about it:
- It provides plenty of instruction, especially in the beginner levels (both yoga and Pilates), and there are three different people to watch for various levels of modifications you may need to do.  You can use the same video over and over, and as you improve, move to the more advanced versions and still feel that you're getting a good workout.
- The transitions are lovely - something I've really only come to appreciate watching other videos where they are clearly terrible.  You move gently between exercises, and your body is well-prepared, from both the warmup and the preparation for each exercise, to do the moves without injuring yourself.
- There is good attention in both the yoga and Pilates videos to the breathing aspect of both forms, which is an *imperative* to do either correctly.

I hesitate to give it 5 stars for just a couple reasons.  First, the voiceover is a bit ""new age-y"" - my shoulder isn't touching the ""Earth,"" it's touching the floor, thankyouverymuch.  That's more true in the yoga videos than the Pilates videos.  There are just a few flubs (e.g., in the intermediate Pilates video, they suggest you're about to start one exercise but you actually do another before going into that), but they're not that big of a deal.  For the record, even though I've been doing Pilates off and on for more than a decade I'm fairly new to yoga, and yet even after months of doing these videos, I couldn't even do the unmodified versions of the yoga exercises in the *beginner* video - I may never actually get to the Vinyasa yoga one.

The two Pilates videos though do move you nicely from learning to doing, and I found that once I felt I had ""mastered"" the intermediate workout, I could focus on doing the unmodified versions with more repetitions while the instructions I no longer needed were going on the background.  Ultimately, I got it down so well that I could do the routine without the video, averaging about 30 minutes each time, which was perfect.

I do highly recommend this series - if you can get your hands on it!",1456704000,,2389,4.582159624413146
8239981,5,B0011367V6,A great 4-disc set of Yoga and Pilates. I bought it because of positive costumer reviews and was not disappointed. I have some experience with Yoga but am new to Pilates. I recommend this to people who have had some experience with one or both exercises.,1361577600,2,254,4.543478260869565
8239982,3,B0011367V6,I wanted to try yoga and thought that this would be a good place to start. All and all it was alright,1360800000,,101,3.6363636363636362
8239983,3,B0011367V6,"I would recommend this for any beginner, but for me it was nothing new that I had not already learned.",1354492800,,102,4.15
8239984,5,B0011367V6,"Very nicely done. Starts out slowly and with simple modified moves and progresses to more challenging movements. The production is very simple, but professional. I'm very happy.",1351382400,,177,5.592592592592593
8239985,1,B0011367V6,"I had never done yoga before, but figured I'd try it because I hear a lot about it. I bought this because it also had the pilates, and I love pilates. However, it was a waste of money. I was bored with the yoga, and the pilates sucked. If your wanting to to do yoga or pilates, go with a different video...not this.",1336176000,,315,4.015873015873016
8239986,5,B0011367V6,"I have only done the two beginners dvds, but they were both great workouts. I highly recommend this product for beginners and more advanced yoga and pilates!",1332892800,,157,4.851851851851852
8239987,5,B0011367V6,"This set came packaged and brand new within two weeks of ordering. It provides great introductions to different levels of pilates and yoga, perfect for both those new to the exercises and those returning after time away!",1305676800,2,220,4.972972972972973
