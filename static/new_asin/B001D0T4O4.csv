In turn I also encounter their families and friends who are similarly trapped, either in addictions or struggling to emerge from terribly broken families and backgrounds.  As I watched this film tears came to my eyes as I saw so vividly portrayed both the struggles and addictions of broken families.  It was as if the people I work with had found voices to portray their ongoing tragedies, and in that there is dignity.  It is impossible to work with people at their worst without believing in their dignity, and despite all the brokenness portrayed in this film it was the dignity of the characters that held me and broke my heart at the same time.

After watching I was ready to give five stars right away to this apparently largely overlooked film, but then the credits rolled and I noticed its dedication to Lily Wheelwright, one of the two actresses.  What happened?  I was stunned to think that such a vibrant actress died so soon after the making of the film, but then the real tragedy hit home when I learned from news stories on the Internet that after a struggle with addiction she died herself of a drug overdose.  How very sad.

The news of her death unsurprisingly overshadowed the movie's release and I expect reduced its chance of a popular reception.  And yet, so very sadly, the movie and the real actress's death so completely portray the terrible plague of addiction and the families broken by it.  Unlike BREAKING BAD, the cast did not walk away from this tragedy unbroken.  This is not a 5 star feel good movie.  It is a 5 star depiction of so many people who are suffering so much today.  Even the somewhat scattered scenes of the movie seemed to me to reflect the scattering of families as they struggle to pull themselves together from such brokenness, like attempting to make a mirror whole after it has shattered.",1487030400,,1934,4.666666666666667
