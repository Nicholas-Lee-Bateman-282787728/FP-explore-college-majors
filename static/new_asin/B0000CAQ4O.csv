7998538,5,B0000CAQ4O,"I received the DVD, but not the book I thought I was suppose to get both.  The DVD is excellent and worth the money.",1392249600,,116,3.8333333333333335
7998539,1,B0000CAQ4O,"This is amongst the worst I've seen in any kind of instructional DVDs. When I tell friends or expert instructors about it, they have a problem with fathoming it; either they live in Norway or Chamonix in France.",1234224000,,211,4.578947368421052
7998540,3,B0000CAQ4O,"The videos by Harold Harb are good, but by no means are they the best. The main problems are that Harold's videos lack good photography and are often filled with fluff material as filler. Harold is clearly an expert skier and has revolutionized ski instruction by the introduction of new techniques, but his teaching on video does not do justice to his expertise. I think this is more the fault of poor decisions made in planning the photography and editing the material. The video is worth owning, but there are other video instruction resources that are superior to this one. By comparison, this video seems dated as if it was shot by a non-professional with home video equipment and not up to the standards that are possible with a good photographer and director and high quality video production facilities.",1162425600,,811,4.841726618705036
7998541,2,B0000CAQ4O,"Be warned this DVD focuses on a ""better"" technique, so doesn't necessarily reinforce conventional technique.  There's some good in it, but it's a little disappointing.

Also what we watched could hardly be considered ""Expert"".",1136160000,,226,5.617647058823529
7998542,5,B0000CAQ4O,"Harald's method shows you how to use balance and gravity to carve your way down the slopes.  It's completely different than what's taught at resort ski schools.  Those traditional methods are for tourists and lead you to dead end skills.

In the past, Harald's ski racing programs have created olympic medal winners.  He takes that experience and modifies it for recreational skiers.  It works!

The funny thing is, Harald's method is 10 times easier than the traditional method.  If you want to experience the beautiful feeling of carving and using balance, get this DVD.  It will re-invent the sport for you.",1099180800,10,610,4.97029702970297
7998543,2,B0000CAQ4O,"I wasn't very impressed with the video. I didn't read the book. Maybe the book should be used along with the video. Harald's explanations and demontrations are very fast. At least too fast for me. He starts the video with a reasonable structure, then the structure somehow dissapears. He cruised by on the bumps and powder sections.
As I said, maybe the book should fill in the gaps. If you only watch the video you need to be an ""expert"" skier to keep up. I do not recommend it for Beginners or Intermediates.
If you are a Beginner/ Intermediate I highly recommend Lito Tejada's Breakthrough series.",1019865600,5,600,4.669811320754717
7998544,5,B0000CAQ4O,"This is the best ski instruction video I have ever watched! Great action, music, and easy to follow instructions. Harb rules!",1014076800,4,125,5.0
