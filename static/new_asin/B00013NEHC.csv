1969238,4,B00013NEHC,I was really disapponted.  Even though the movie was made over 20 years ago it showed great promise being that the book was written by Michener.  The story left you hanging--wondering what happened.  The plot itself was very choppy and unclear what happended between the chacters.  I am sorry I started the movie - now I will have to read the book to find out what happened.,1324857600,,374,4.537313432835821

1969240,4,B00013NEHC,"The movie was good, I bought it because Harrison Ford was in it.  The ending just seems to leave you hanging.  It was more like they ran out of filming time and just tacked it onto the movie.",1245974400,,191,4.0
