143354,5,079283514X,"In my opinion, this is the best of the Lassie movies, although I had never heard of it before. Then I saw it on the movie channel one day and I had to get it. In contrast, many of the Lassie movies are so heartbreaking I can't bare to watch. But this movie has a perfect blend of adventure, enduring scenes and suspense. I don't know how they trained Lassie to do some of the scenes in this movie, it is incredible. There are also unusual and precious scenes including Indians. Usually, especially in westerns, we see Indians in a harsh light, but this movie has the most wonderful scenes with Indians. It is truly welcome to see that. Please don't hesitate to get this film. It is an unknown classic!",1380672000,,701,4.358778625954199
143355,5,079283514X,"I always enjoy Lassie, the plot is excellent I felt love,sadness,and felt uncomfortable with the part in the movie when the actor in the cabin ask the dog was he hungry,then he slammed the door on him,i felt such sorrow  not uncomfortable not to watch but it was so amazing how both lassise and the actor seemed so well acted, I cried. I never want to see anyone hungry or cold. I love how the bad guy is potrayed but hoped he would get reedeemed because, I felt such sorry for his growly greed and hatred. Much like how people act in real life with money or gold if they are filled with greed. If you like Lassie you will love this!!!!! movie",1370131200,3,643,4.227642276422764
143356,2,079283514X,"Extremely poor story and script with ridiculous, laughable dialogue.  We've even got stupid people falling off cliffs backwards without being pushed.  This is the only Lassie movie that never appeared in a New York Times review.  The terrible transfer is quite fitting!  Dreadful BOMB ... I gave it 2 stars for those who might appreciate the comic effect of a really bad Lassie film . . . Think Planet 9 From Outer Space",1351468800,2,420,4.712328767123288
143357,1,079283514X,"I haven't seen anything this bad since the Lone Ranger! Plot: greedy man kills prospector, Lassie kills greedy man. What's the point? There are plenty of other Lassie movies far better than this one.",1316131200,,199,4.882352941176471
143358,5,079283514X,Good quality release from Roan of the last M-G-M Lassie film.  No complaints.  Don't get any of the other low budget DVD's or you will be disappointed.,1273276800,2,151,4.555555555555555
143359,5,079283514X,"Why they do it, I don't know....but Amazon has reviews for different transfers of this movie combined. I have the Roan Group transfer, and let me say, it is a beautiful transfer. I can't imagine any of the major studios doing a better job.
This is a great movie to have, as Lassie's last movie before hitting the small screen. But it is more than just a typical ""Lassie"" movie...it is truly suspenseful and quite a pleasure to view.
Definitely a great addition to any DVD collection, especially anyone who enjoys westerns or animal movies!",1080777600,15,539,4.684210526315789
143360,2,079283514X,"Magnificent scenery, reminds me of my vacations out west with my parents, when I was young.  The video is of extremely poor quality, though.  Could be very distracting during certain parts of the movie.  If you are sensitive to video quality issues, you won't like it.  Otherwise, enjoy!",1069113600,5,287,4.916666666666667
143361,4,079283514X,"This DVD is a treat for Lassie fans both young and old. The scenery is spectacular, and the story line was well written. I would highly recommend this film to everyone.",992908800,8,168,4.451612903225806
143362,5,079283514X,"After getting tired of watching Babe (you know, the pig movie) with our 2 year old, I went looking for another animal movie.  I purchased this film after reading al ellefson's review.  He's absolutely right.
There are two  deaths in the film, but neither are very gruesome.  In the first, a man  falling off the side of a mountain is implied.  However, in the second a  fake body is seen falling down the side of a mountain from a very long  distance.  It might be disturbing to some children, but is incredibly mild  compared to most current films, even those supposedly made for children.
There are so many good values and lessons in this film, it's impossible  to mention them all.  I'm glad we found this movie.",955843200,10,715,4.543307086614173

143386,1,079283514X,"Taking candy from a baby is a popular metaphor about shameful crime. There is no ""Lassie"" as you or I know her, in this movie. This is a movie about another dog not even named Lassie, who is occasionally called that as a nickname the way Scots refer to young women. The dog is named Shep, a confusing enough name for a female dog. Makes me wonder if some dialog with ""Lassie"" was not dubbed in at a later time, as the title credits apparently were.

Basically they took a movie about another collie and passed it off as a Lassie story. This is shameful.",1421712000,,553,4.266666666666667

143388,4,079283514X,"I have to admit that this is my least favorite of the movies featuring the original Lassie, however that is not a terribly negative comment because the other films were so wonderful.

One of the problems plaguing this entry is the obvious downgrade of production values as compared to the earlier films.  For example, this one features a cast of competent to fair character actors but no headliners.  They move the story along but there is obviously no Academy Award acting material here.  Studio executives had concluded that the popularity of Lassie was in decline and chopped the budget for this film accordingly.  Afterward, the corporate bean counters also sold all of the rights to the Lassie name to Lassie's owner/trainer in order to write off a modest sum of money that they owed him.  Talk about penny smart and pound foolish!

Having said that, this is still a good, typical Lassie movie and that alone gives it value.  The story conveys a striking comparison between loyalty born of love and selfish greed.",1420588800,,1018,4.84393063583815
143389,3,079283514X,"Lassie - The Painted Hills, 1951 film

It begins with a call for Shep from her owner, he round rich ore in a mine. [Sudden riches!] Jon then goes into town, he asks for Frank. But he died last month, and Lin Taylor is his partner. He shows the ore! Should he file a claim right now? Lin says no, it would attract claim jumpers. Young Tommy cries over the death of his father Frank Blake. Jonathan gives Shep to Tommy. Merry Christmas!. But Shep is homesick so he returned home. Jonathan is sick in his cabin, and hungry. But he found a richer source of ore! Lin wants to return with equipment to work more efficiently (a sluice box). Work yields riches. The richest ore is worthless if you kill yourself getting it.

There is conflict over the contents in the saddle bag of Pilot Pete, an irregular preacher. He rides a mule. Does an increase in gold create dissension? Lin only gets 25%, Jonathan gets 50%. What will Lin do? Jonathan writes out a claim for Tommy to take back to town and file it in all their names. Tommy rides away, Shep follows. Lin lures Jonathan to the top of a mountain; he say she found rich quartz. But Jonathan falls down the mountain! Shep can do nothing to help. Lin shovels dirt. What is beneath that mound? Shep begins to dig, Lin chases him away. The next day Shep returns to the cabin for a meal. Is he hungry enough? Lin throws food to him, then Shep walks away. Is there a problem? Shep barks, he is in distress.

Two Native Americans find him and carry him into town. An antidote is given, will it work? Tommy will investigate the cause. A storm arises, lightning strikes. Lin breaks some rocks the next morning. Tommy returns and asks about Jonathan. Who whistled? Tommy follow Shep, they find Jonathans hat. Lin threatens Tommy, who gets away on his horse. Or does he? Lin carries Tommy back to the cabin. Lin has an excuse for what happened. Men arrive the next morning with the runaway horse. Pilot Pete prays over Jonathans grave. Lin says it was an accident. Tommy calls him a liar and shows where the gold is hidden. But theres little gold there. Shep barks at the cabin, Lin runs after her, shooting. Is Shep trapped on a cliff? Is there a reversal of fortune? [A frozen revolver won't work.] There is an ironic ending so justice is done. Tommy returns to find Shep for a happy ending. [No mention about the missing gold, it would belong to Martha Blake and her son Tommy.

This movie may be too serious for young children, it is more suited to an older audience. It has a warning about choosing a business partner. There is no mention as to how Frank Blake died and then how Lin became friendly with his widow. Was this edited out? The DVD tells how MGM hired Pal as a stunt double for a show collie. But Pal performed better and became the first of many collies to play the part. I remember the first popular Lassie movie was set in England during the Great Depression. Lassie became so popular many sequels were made during the 1940s. I wonder if this 68-minute version was from a longer version? Collies were bred as sheep dogs, they were less expensive than a man or boy to herd sheep. This is based on the novel Shep of the Painted Hills by Alexander Hull.",1414540800,,3205,4.381512605042017
143390,3,079283514X,"Parents Beware: Not Appropriate for Sensitive Kids!!!  Here's why: Lassie and the main characters' endearing qualities are just as good as ever and cause the audience to identify with them, but shortly into the movie the kindly grandfather figure is pushed to his death by his gold-obsessed partner. Lassie is then hurt and eventually poisoned by this villain. Our five year old began sobbing after the first incident and our seven year old decided not to go on after Lassie's endangerment, so we had to turn this off. We then had to fabricate an alternate ending of the boy saving Lassie, the old man being found unconscious and saved, and the villain going to jail. After reading the bio and finding out the real ending, we're glad we didn't let our young kids continue watching. This might be fine for older kids or kids used to sad/violent movies, but not what we were expecting with a G-rated Lassie flick. It's a fine 1950's gold rush movie for adults (although we only finished half of it).",1410480000,,997,4.6971428571428575

7792193,5,079283514X,"A few people have unfairly panned this film, stating that it's not a Lassie movie, or that the plot is flimsy and the dialogue lame. As a result of such comments, I held off purchasing the DVD for years. I'm so glad I gave it a chance, and can now see how wrong these negative comments are. First off, the Roan DVD is crisp and clear, with deep and vivid color, and good sound quality. I'd definitely pick up the Roan edition if I were you. Second, this is a Lassie movie. Period. The original collie that played Lassie in all the previous films, and who ultimately became Lassie for a generation of moviegoers, Pal, not only stars in this picture but is also featured prominently. In fact, the plot revolves around Pal's character, Shep. Okay, the dog's name is NOT Lassie, because this is a fairly faithful adaptation of the novel SHEP AND THE PAINTED HILLS. And ""a rose by any other name"" is just as sweet. Pal gives an incredible ""performance"", which (if you're a dog lover) will have you on the edge of your seat. It may even bring a tear. The plot is simple but remains relevant today: the depiction greed versus love, and the corrupting influence of sudden wealth. The characters are well-drawn. You'll love the good guys and hate the bad guy. I don't recommend this movie for small kids. It's actually too serious in its depiction of cruelty, but adult fans of Lassie won't be disappointed.",1470614400,,1398,4.529644268774703
