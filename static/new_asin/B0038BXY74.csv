8391219,4,B0038BXY74,"Cute French romantic comedy about to be ""re-made"" in Hollywood. For some reason, Australia is the only place on earth that issued this DVD with English subtitles. The French stubbornly refuse to add English subtitles to most of their DVDs, which deprives non-French speakers from enjoying French movies.
This comedy avoids the usual clichs and builds on two central characters who look like normal people, not like the typical ""movie star"" types of most films.",1298246400,,460,5.1466666666666665
