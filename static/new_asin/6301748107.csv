347659,5,6301748107,"Scarlet Street is better than The Woman in the Window. The nightmare vision is darker, more grotesquely detailed, more mean-spirited. And it doesn't have a compromised ending as does Woman.
Lang focuses his  attention on every hideous little detail of quiet desperation that compels  the characters to their tragic and inevitable fates. Thus, Robinson, a  humble small-time bookkeeper (who paints lurid streetscapes in the kitchen  (after he's done the dinner dishes) is trapped in a claustrophobic marriage  to a hulking harriden who thinks art is a waste of time and money. He  dreams of an escape through his art and the deceptively dishy Bennett.  Bennett and her fancy man, Duryea, both scheming sociopaths, have a very  different set of dreams. Everyone loses.",964224000,5,766,5.221311475409836
347660,4,6301748107,"Fritz Lang directed this American version of Renoir's LA CHIENNE; in the American setting it's a sordid, lowlife melodrama about illicit love, and it never takes root - it's one of Lang's best American movies.  This film was originally banned in New York State - that is, denied a license - as ""immoral, indecent, corrupt, and tending to incite crime"" - a judgement which seemed off the wall even in 1946!  Eddie Robinson is a frustrated, grey - haired cashier married to a nag (Rosalind Ivan); his only pleasure is in painting on Sundays.  He falls for a tart (Joan Bennett) and sets her up in a Greenwich Village apartment, on stolen money.  Bennett happens to be in love with a low-life lout (Dan Duryea), who beats her...........The script, by Dudley Nichols, is rather heavy-handed, and Lang's emphatic style pounds home the ironies and the murder-plot devices.  Robinson's paintings were actually done by John Decker.  There is a unique twist in this lurid little thriller; it was the first film to show the culprit unpunished for his crime (although he shows remorse).",958694400,7,1075,4.8791208791208796

Bennett and Robinson do workman-like, albeit uninspiring work; Dan Duryea makes ""a vicious and serpentine creature out of a cheap, chiseling tinhorn off the streets""

Bennett sums up Robinson perfectly: How can a man be so dumb?

347739,5,6301748107,"This is a classic, very bleak film - but a watchable one for its thoroughly professional performances, and - if this is your style of humor - its sadistic, cynical, almost nihilistic wit. It was made in 1945 and released in early '46 - but it's obvious from its opening moments that the film's action is supposed to take place more than a decade earlier.  Some film historians consider it the very first U.S. film of the so-called ""film noir""  genre.

Its director was Fritz Lang, and it is a kind of film version of Dreiser's naturalistic novel  ""An American Tragedy"" - except that Edward G. Robinson plays a character who - instead of being an attractive young leading man, is instead a hapless middle-aged married schnook at the end of his career as a lowly clerk - and who -through  no fault of his own but his Walter Mitty fantasy life and his naivete -  is stepped on like a bug by Fate.
There's humor in this film, but it is black humor. Robinson did not like doing this film and did not like the character he played; of course,  Edward G. Robinson made his name by playing tough, smart, aggressive, capable males.  In this film, he's totally clueless - a foolish man full of wish-fulfilling illusions as to his talent as a painter who's duped by a prostitute brilliantly played by Joan Bennett in an era when no prominent actress like Ms Bennett would ever risk their career by playing a woman who ""made her living on her back.""  But the career of Joan Bennett spans the history of Hollywood from the silent era to the '50's - so veteran, totally professional actress that she was, she was not daunted by the role she played.  Dan Duryea  almost walks away with the film playing the Bennett character's pimp - an ill fated character, as is often the case in films of the 40's that this handsome, smart actor was cast in.

It is only hinted in this movie that the Bennett character is a prostitute. We first meet her as she's arguing with her pimp under a streetlamp - a visual convention from paintings, illustrations and films; prostitutes were often shown posed under streetlamps.  Also, her pimp calls her ""lazy legs"" - suggesting the part of her attractive body she makes her living with - the selfsame body (and face) with which the Caspar Milquetoast character played by Robinson is smitten.

By today's standards, this film is slow to get going, but then the cleverly plotted, sordid storyline kicks in and carries the picture. The ending is of a downbeat variety - possibly one of the most pessimistic of any famous film of the 40's.

My only problem with this Amazon offering is the dismal quality of the print Amazon uses. There's a very watchable remastered version of this classic, deeply troubliing film that was issued by Kino Video in 2005 and which is available on Amazon.com ""Movies and TV."" as a DVD.  Amazon owes it to its Amazon Prime customers - and to the very inventive makers of this historically important film - to use a better quality print of it, perhaps the Kino remastered one.",1466467200,4,3015,4.565862708719852

347776,4,6301748107,"A very engaging noir film, with Edward G. Robinson playing against his usual tough-guy gangster image. He plays a schlubby, quiet hen-pecked husband who longs for someone who understands him, who is young, pretty, and exciting -- like his boss (who is apparently having an affair with a younger woman). Enter the happenstance meeting with a femme fatal, who suckers EG Robinson into giving her money, getting her an apartment, etc. She, in turn, is controlled by her creepy boyfriend, who recognizes EG Robinson as an easy mark, ripe for sucking dry. He pimps his girlfriend out, and she goes along with it. Eventually, things become clear (I won't go into details), and all three major characters are doomed. (Again, I won't give spoilers). No happy ending. Very moralistic ending, which is a bit too heavy-handed. Otherwise, I would give this film a 5 star rating. I was kept interested throughout the film, and it never dragged. It's quite an unusual film, not a typical noir-- probably because the main character transforms so drastically from good, to bad. But, his inner self always remains ""good"". EG Robinson plays a character that we sympathize with throughout, even when he does bad things. This is not typical in noir films at all.",1459382400,,1242,4.919047619047619

347853,4,6301748107,"Directed by Fritz Lang, ""Scarlet Street"" resulted in a scandal when it was released in 1945. Censors in New York State, Milwaukee, and Atlanta banned the film. The Atlanta censor explained: the censorship of the film was justified by ""the sordid life it portrayed, the treatment of illicit love, the failure of the characters to receive orthodox punishment from the police, and because the picture would tend to weaken a respect for the law,"" Scarlet Street was ""licentious, profane, obscure and contrary to the good order of the community."" (quotation from WIKI) It is always interesting to see responses from not-so-distant times that seem different from one's own. But even with the broad changes in standards, it is difficult to see a basis for the responses ""Scarlet Street"" engendered in some quarters.

This is a dark film noir which explores the slow build-up to wrongdoing and the resulting guilt. It features three famous actors: Edward G. Robinson as the main character Christopher Cross, Joan Bennett as Kitty Marsh, and Dan Duryea as Johnny Prince.  Cross is lonely aging man trapped in a loveless marriage to a shrewish wife. He has worked as a cashier for a large New York firm for 25 years and finds meaning in his life as an amateur painter. He chances upon a young woman, Kitty, being beaten on the street during a rainy night. He becomes enamored with her and wants to begin a relationship with this beautiful much-younger woman.  It develops that Kitty likely is a prostitute (this could not be stated explicitly in a 1945 film) and that her attacker was Johnny, her pimp and also, as Kitty hopes, her fianc. Kitty and Johnny believe Cross is a well-known artist, and they scheme together to entangle his emotions and to bilk him out of his money. Cross is hopelessly and foolishly in love. When he discovers that he is being duped, he kills Kitty with an ice pick and Johnny takes the fall and is sentenced to death. Cross deteriorates emotionally and mentally and is alone and plagued with guilt for the rest of his days.

There is no sex in the film which focuses on the deterioration through passion of a basically good but lonely man, and his subsequent  guilt. The film begins slowly but gradually picks up force. The acting tends to be stilted with the exception of Duryea's portrayal of the scheming, active and sinister Johnny. The film creates a strong feeling of unease as Cross is increasingly duped and meets his downfall. I liked the noir photography of the rainy, ""scarlet"" streets of New York and of the angular, modernist-style apartment which the gullible Cross rents for Kitty.

The film has received a mix of reviews and critical responses since its 1945 release. I thought it was a good if slow film noir which explores the darkness of human emotion and behavior.  The movie will appeal to admirers of film noir.

347890,4,6301748107,"Fritz Lang's Scarlet Street (1945) is one of the greatest film noirs and should be in every serious film collection. It is therefore deeply frustrating that there seems to be no 'official' release of it on DVD. The film ranks alongside Howard Hawks' The Big Sleep (1948) and Lang's own later The Big Heat (1953), but where those films are presented in pristine releases by Warner Brothers and Columbia, Scarlet Street appears only on independent (pirate?) labels. I avoided the Elstree Hill release as I know their treatment of classic films is shoddy to say the least and went for the version under review released by Odeon Entertainment in Sep. 2008. Although it is presented in the correct 4:3 aspect ratio (unlike all Elstree Hill releases that I have seen!), something seems to have gone wrong with the digital remastering. Tiny lines appear every time there is movement within a frame and big movements (those pans and zooms so important to Lang) produce distortion and lack of focus to a degree which ruins Milton R. Krasner's extraordinary photography and Lang's careful framing.

'Framing' is the ultimate watchword here in a film all about a meek and mild bank cashier (Chris Cross) obsessed with a wayward woman (Kitty - a prostitute?) who together with her pimp boyfriend (Johnny) proceed to frame him to extort all the money they can get. Cross is trapped (framed) in every way imaginable. First seen being presented with a watch, he is trapped within the time he has left to live (Lang constantly alludes to time passing throughout the picture with the clock being literally a 'destiny machine' driving Cross towards his doomed fate), then we see how he is trapped within a suffocating marriage, trapped by his job (notice the cage from which he is 'released' at the end of each day at work), and trapped by his own sexual inadequacy. He confesses to never having seen a woman's naked body and responds to sexual arousal with the violence of an infant confronted by his parents having sex in front of him. This 'castration anxiety' is just one of many Freudian strands to snake through the film. Note the phallic cigar of his boss lit just before he exits to have a date with a young girl. Then there is the character of Johnny the pimp who is presented as sex incarnate with his pin stripe suits and phallic hat spotted at key moments of the film. Lang encapsulates his evil sexuality with a dissolve from that character to the snake depicted in one of Cross's pictures. Most obvious of all the Freudian references is (after the 'primal scene' of seeing through a square window Kitty and Johnny kissing - Johnny's phallic hat at the bottom of the frame) the way Cross stabs Kitty with an ice pick, the thrusting mimicking the sex act itself. Cross's only escape is painting which Lang points out is just another way of 'framing' reality. He confesses to a 'lack of perspective' which again, is exactly what the film is all about. His painting makes the film an exploration of film-making itself with Cross as Lang's doppelganger. Just as Cross paints and frames, so does Lang with shot after shot of amazing compositions of circles within squares (especially the apartment Cross rents for Kitty, Cross's workplace and the bar where he talks with his wife's supposedly 'dead' husband - note the round circles surrounded by a square window behind their table) providing for an extraordinarily suffocating visual style. Cross is doomed the minute he stoops to help the maiden in distress and that is related with impeccable visual logic by Lang, the master architect. The main character's very name (Chris Cross) is a perfect metaphor for the way Lang suffocates him with his grid-like, criss-cross mise-en-scene so that at the very end he has lost all grip on his own identity. The final sequence of Cross as a hobo hobbling past the art dealer to be confronted by the 'self portrait' of Kitty which is sold for $10,000 he couldn't gain even if he wanted to, is one of cinema's most powerful statements of an individual crushed by the evils of the contemporary world - I find it extraordinarily moving.

It's often said that Lang made his best films in Germany and that he took a step backwards in Hollywood. I don't think this is strictly true. While he did have to sacrifice the absolute artistic control he enjoyed at Germany to the fussy producer-driven commercialism of Hollywood studios who certainly did interfere intolerably in much of his American work, there are films which seem to have escaped the various hacks. I'd single out You Only Live Once (1937), Woman in the Window (1944), The Big Heat (1953) and Scarlet Street as being pretty much as Lang wanted them to be. He is on record as saying he was happiest with Scarlet Street out of all his American output, and I'd put all four films on the same level of achievement as films such as Dr. Mabuse (1922), Die Nibelungen (1924) and Spione (1928). At the same time they are all significantly better than Metropolis (1926) - a film which to my mind is over-rated. M (1931) was his greatest achievement - there's no question about that, but the way Scarlet Street is shot (so different from Renoir's La Chienne (1931) by the way) shows it is so obviously the product of the same director. It is astonishing to me that in a world where we have umpteen editions of Hitchcock films to choose from, even the best of Lang remains hard to find in good transfers. To me Scarlet Street compares very well with the best of Hitchcock and deserves the very best presentation on DVD. This release, alas, is not it. I advise waiting for Universal to get their act together and release the film properly before purchasing.",1411430400,,5684,4.734611503531786

Produced by Walter Wanger and Fritz Lang. Written by Dudley Nichols, Screenplay and Georges de La Fouchardi&egrave;re, Story. Starring Edward G Robinson, Joan Bennett, Dan Duryea. Music by Hans Salter, Ernie Burnett (""Melancholy Baby""), cinematography by Milton Krasner, editing by Arthur Hilton. Distributed by Universal Pictures. Budget $m1.2, Box office $m2.9.

Scarlet Street is a film noir based on the French novel La Chienne (The Bitch) by Georges de La Fouchardi&egrave;re, previously dramatised on stage by Andr&eacute; Mouzy-&Eacute;on, and cinematically as La Chienne (1931) by Jean Renoir. Principal actors Edward G Robinson, Joan Bennett, and Dan Duryea, had earlier appeared together in The Woman in the Window (1944), also directed by Fritz Lang. The three were re-teamed for Scarlet Street. The film was later featured in an episode of Cinema Insomnia.

When the film was released, Bosley Crowther, The New York Times film critic, gave the film a mixed review, and wrote, ""But for those who are looking for drama of a firm and incisive sort, Scarlet Street is not likely to furnish a particularly rare experience. Dudley Nichols wrote the story from a French original, in which it might well have had a stinging and grisly vitality. In this presentation, however, it seems a sluggish and manufactured tale, emerging much more from sheer contrivance than from the passions of the characters involved. And the slight twist of tension which tightens around the principal character is lost in the middle of the picture when he is shelved for a dull stretch of plot.""

More recently, critic Dennis Schwartz wrote ""Scarlet Street is a bleak psychological film noir that has the same leading actors as his 1944 film The Woman in the Window. It sets a long-standing trend of a criminal not punished for his crime; this is the first Hollywood film where that happened...The Edward G. Robinson character is viewed as an ordinary man who is influenced by an evil couple who take advantage of his vulnerability and lead him down an amoral road where he eventually in a passionate moment loses his head and commits murder. Chris's imagination can no longer save him from his dreadful existence, and his complete downfall comes about as the talented artist loses track of reality and his dignity.""

So much of excerpts from Wikipedia. The kind of schmaltzy turn in Lang's films, when still in Europe, was attributed to his then scripting wife Thea von Harbou; from this and other films, it is clear that Lang himself also occasionally has a trend to the melodramatic. Better tough or tearsome?

184us - Scarlet Street (Fritz Lang, 1945, 103') -Teary - 28/9/2012",1348704000,,2704,5.09255079006772
347974,3,6301748107,"Disclaimer: The version of the film that I saw is included in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Mysteries-Collection/dp/B002ID098A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Mysteries Collection</a>.  As such, I cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of this Alpha Video release.  My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

It's strange to see Edward G. Robinson in the role of milquetoast, but that's exactly what you get in SCARLET STREET - at least for about the first ninety minutes.  Joan Bennett, on the other hand, is the tough dame she always was, save for her characteristically inexplicable poor choice in men.  As the out-of-work model Kitty, she tweaks and twists Robinson's mid-life crisis into knots of equal parts pleasure and dismay, reeling him in for the money she thinks he has, all at the behest of the true love of her life, the low-life con man Johnny (Dan Duryea), who esentially pimps her out for the easy cash.

But Fate steps in and deals these three characters a difficult hand - especially Robinson, with whom we at least understand and sympathise as he steals from his employer to pay for the whims of Bennett and, unknown to him, Duryea.  Sympathetic or not, it doesn't matter once he crosses that line - director Fritz Lang lays a heavy finger on the scales of justice, which then metes out a harsh reward for our three actors.  It's a cruel story, even a little sordid - it was banned in New York for indecency, though modern viewers are likely to be puzzled as to why.  Still, it holds to many of the bleaker conventions of Noir filmmaking, and Robinson's doomed little man reaches a dead end as soon as he steps onto Scarlet Street.

This is another story in a long line which seems to relish the twisting in the wind of its characters while Fate delays its final sentencing (Shakespeare made a killing at it - Sophocles before him).  Honestly though, these sorts of stories leave me feeling frustrated by their unfairness (I know - who ever said life was fair?).  It isn't so much the outcome, but that our sympathy is courted and won over, and those characters to whom we become attached are funneled into one critical, though usually justifiable, mis-step; from that moment, we vicariously watch as they are utterly destroyed.  It is as if the storyteller is taking great pleasure in assuring us that if Fate takes notice of us, we are sure to be dashed to pieces from that attention.

Well, if you like that sort of thing, SCARLET STREET's a pretty good example of it.  I like all the performances here, really they all come in top-notch.  Noir fans as well as those who appreciate classic tragedy should be quite pleased with Lang's version, and once again, if this is your bag, I feel it's recommendable.  Perhaps a little too bleak for me, though.

Once again, this PopFlix production contained on the Midnight Mystery Collection was entirely serviceable for me.  Presented in 1.33:1 and with a runtime of 103 minutes, the specifics seems to tally in general with the other versions out there, though undoubtedly the Kino&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blu-ray/dp/B006GVNHMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blu-ray</a>&nbsp;is the edition to get if your already a fan of the movie, or think you would be.

347977,4,6301748107,"Fritz Lang's 1945 film noir classic ""Scarlet Street"" may be banal with its golddigger storyline but once the grisly twist hits the viewer, you have no doubt that Lang (known for classics such as ""M"", ""Metropolis"", ""The Testament of Dr. Mabuse"") has successfully drawn the viewer in for something unpredictable and shocking.

It's no surprise that ""Scarlet Street"" was considered a bleak film noir that was banned in three cities, but nearly 70-years-later, one can marvel and perhaps be amused by how well-crafted this film was for its time.

""Scarlet Street"" is a film adaptation by Dudley Nichols (""Stagecoach"", ""Bringing Up Baby"", ""The Bells of St. Mary's"") of the French novel and play ""La Chienne"" by Georges de La Fouchardiere and Andre Mouezy-Eon.

Lang would also take his three stars from the 1944 film ""The Woman in the Window"", Edward G. Robinson (""Double Indemity"", ""Key Largo"", ""The Ten Commandments""), Joan Bennett (""Dark Shadows"", ""Father's Little Dividend"", ""Father of the Bride"") and Dan Duryea (""The Pride of the Yankees"", ""Peyton Place""), and cast them in ""Scarlet Street"".

While Fritz Lang was well-known for his films in Germany, it wasn't until decades later that many film historians and critics learned how much of an impact Lang would have in the emergence and the evolution of the film genre, film noir.

VIDEO:

""Scarlet Street"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1 aspect ratio).  Because Kino Lorber were able to obtain the video from the archives of the Library of Congress, what we have here is the best print available.  And naturally, with it being in HD, this is simply the definitive version of the film to own.

With that being said, it's important for those new to Kino Lorber to know that the company takes a hands free approach.  As restoration is quite laborious and very expensive, they present the film from the original master in HD.  So, what we have here is a film that does have its fair share of white specks (not too much that it would ruin your viewing pleasure) but in terms of picture quality, clarity is the keyword when watching this film on Blu-ray.

Black levels are deep, contrast in white and gray levels are great and compared to previous version of the film, there is no blurring effect nor the interlacing.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Scarlet Street"" is presented in uncompressed Linear PCM 2.0 monaural.  As mentioned with video, Kino Lorber takes a hands free approach when it comes to Blu-ray releases.  So, ""Scarlet Street"" does have its share of a few clicks and even some mild hissing.  But dialogue is clear and understandable.

There are no subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Scarlet Street"" comes with the following special features:

  Audio commentary - Featuring a audio commentary by David Kalat (author of The Strange Case of Dr. Mabuse)
  Photo Gallery - Featuring images of deleted scenes and artwork for the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Scarlet Street"" is a 1945 film which may have seem twisted, dark or grisly to movie fans during that time.

But it was also the beginning of a genre in cinema known as ""film noir"" that would later become appreciated by cinema fans.

What I enjoyed about this film is that at first glance, it seemed as if it was too banal.  A story about an old man named Christopher Cross who doesn't get the love and appreciation from his wife and wonders if men flock to younger women for fun and a exciting life.  Maybe it's what he needs because his life is absolutely dull.

And then you have the banal gold digger Kitty who is directed by her boyfriend Johnny to bilk as much money she can from him.

But of course, Fritz Lang is not your traditional Hollywood filmmaker.  Even when I first watched this film and even today, I still had this grin of awe of the clever writing he was able to pull off and literally pull the seat under movie watchers because it was nontraditional movie making.

But ""Scarlet Street"" was a fantastic film that I absolutely enjoyed!  But for those who are not erudites to Lang's work in Hollywood, let's just say that ""Scarlet Street"" is just the beginning to Lang's darker films.

During that era in time, Fritz Lang was well-known for his German films and in Hollywood, suffice to say, many film critics wondered why his films from the '40s to the '50s became darker and darker.  In fact, things would get even darker in the '50s with films such as ""The Big Heat"" and it correlated with Lang's pessimistic view towards the world and seeing how things worked in the move industry.

For Edward G. Robinson and Joan Bennett, the films they made with Fritz Lang would be in their peak as Robinson's career would be called into scrutiny a few years later as he was threatened with black listening as the government (via the House Un-American Activities Committee) was cracking down on communist sympathizers in Hollywood.

This would lead for nearly a decade of B-movie films for Robinson until Cecil B. DeMille would later cast him in the epic ""The Ten Commandments"" in 1956.

As for Joan Bennett, she has had a long career since the silent era but a few years after ""Scarlet Street"", her career would be slightly damaged when her husband Walter Wanger tried to kill her agent Jennings Lang, when Wanger suspected the two having an affair.

And as the careers of these three individuals would change after ""Scarlet Street"", the film still resonates strongly among fans of Fritz Lang.  And it is a wonderful choice for Kino Lorber to release on Blu-ray and one can hope that more of Lang's noir films will receive the HD treatment in the near future.

As for the Blu-ray release, as mentioned earlier, this is the definitive version to own of the film at this time.  Watching it on Blu-ray has more clarity and no more interlacing or blurring issues.  The film looks good, granted it could look better with restoration.  The audio commentary by David Kalat is very good and includes a lot of in-depth information that cineaste will enjoy listening to.

Overall, ""Scarlet Street"" is an enjoyable, darker noir film from Fritz Lang and one of the earlier films to help kick off the film noir genre.  Definitely recommended!",1336176000,5,6171,4.774528301886792

In the end, Renoir felt deeply manipulated and divorced her. In Renoir's hands, this is a black comedy.  In Fritz Lang's hands, it becomes a tense sexual thriller and the tale of the dark descent of a man who is completely destroyed by his erotic longing for a beautiful woman who never returns his love.

Edward G. Robinson plays a shy, henpecked married man who works as an unimportant bank cashier/clerk.  In his spare time, he loves to paint and in fact possesses an original vision in his naive paintings. His wife humiliates him and announces the art is worthless.

The film really begins when the Robinson character believes that he has saved a gorgeous woman from being beaten up by a man in the street.  (That man happens to be her pimp).  Unable to take his eyes off this woman,  he allows his sexual desire for her take complete control.  All his normal ethics of honesty are misused in his attempt to raise money.

Let's be fair. A woman as gorgeous as Joan Bennett could demand favors from her admirer, particularly when he is so emotionally vulnerable. Obviously, she just leads him along, takes his paintings, and discovers that there is a hot market for them.  But all along, she is really attracted to her pimp, who is handsome in a cheap sort of way, mean spirited, and cunning.

When the truth is discovered, needless to say, things get darker and darker.

Compared to other scratchy and dull versions which have appeared earlier on DVD copies, this Kino Classics Edition is a superb translation of the original film onto the disc.  The cinematography of dark and rainy streets and confining apartments creates an exterior landscape that matches Edward G. Robinson's sexually repressed character.

As a cinematic treatment of a man's psychological descent into hell, this is one of the best film noirs that I have ever seen.",1332028800,10,2161,4.818428184281843

My copy of the non-remastered Scarlet Street was a ""bargain"" at under a dollar, but when I received it and tested it on more than one player, I was completely stunned at the poor quality of the transfer by, in this case, the outfit Alpha Video.

It's great that many reviewers discuss the films' storylines and performances, although I think that the quality of the DVD transfer is just as important to explain to consumers.

348034,3,6301748107,"Personally, I like my femme fatales and round-heel gold-diggers wherever they may have come from down the social ladder to have a little pizzazz, a little class if you will. I definitely do not want them chewing bubble gum or Wrigleys' for that  matter, putting out their ruby-red lipstick-ringed cigarette butts on the good carpet, or leaving a pile of dishes in the sink (or on that same carpeted floor) when company calls. I'm funny that way but that's just my little thing because low-rent or not I know a girl has got to do what a girl has to do to survive in this wicked old world. And that is what the plot line of this 1940s crime noir, Scarlet Street centers on. As well as, of course, the old adage that we have been hearing about since we were in diapers, crime doesn't pay, although here with an odd twist.

As for the girl who has to do what a girl has to do part, Kitty (played by a low-rent life loving Joan Bennett), is in love. No big deal there except she is in love with a classic grifter, Johnny (played by caddish-aficionado Dan Duryea), who is ready to make that nice big score to put them on easy street. If he only had some kale, dough, moola or whatever you want to call it to grease the way. And that is where Christopher Cross(played in a somewhat stilted Walter-Mitty like way by Edawrd g. Robinson last seen breaking legs in the gangster classics of the 1930s, but I guess 1940s times were tough), a no dough guy with a big front but a real talent for painting, no not house- painting, painting, but high if primitive art. Already this looks like no where right?

Right, except old Cal makes the fatal mistake of helping Kitty out of a few jams and falling in love with her in the meantime. And our boy Johnny ever quick to see the main chance tells Ms. Kitty to string Chris along on the assumption that he has dough. Well Chris doesn't but he does have that artistic talent that Johnny (and Kitty) parley into their version of easy street, for a while. See Cal's primitive art takes off as the big new thing except he can't take credit for it because Johnny in his infinite wisdom has told the critics who are crazy for the stuff Kitty did the work. And Cal, foolish head-over heals in love, plays along with it. Plays along with it until he finally gets hip to the hard fact that Kitty is using him to keep her Johnny in clover. Then things turn ugly, as one would except when one has been played for the patsy.

But you have to be careful with the Walter Mittys of the world. When they turn you do not which way they might go. Cal goes for the heart, literally, and kills Kitty in a rage. Here is where the sweet, sweet for his part come in though, he sets up Johnny, Johnny whose whole life is aimed in this direction, for the fall. And brother he takes it, big time in the big house and the chair. And Cal? He gets his square guy mistreated revenge alright. Hey, you haven't been paying attention to the subtext of this genre. Crime does not pay. And although Cal is finished as an artist, finished as a rational man, he can find no salvation even when he tries to cop to the crime. So he is left to wander, babbling in the mean New York  streets waiting for his hellish end to come. See, there are a lot of ways to play the crime doesn't pay story. This one had a lot of holes in the plot that made it rather surreal in places (Chris's marriage situation, for one) and Robinson falls down as the meek inheritor of the earth but that is that.",1324684800,,3477,4.238310708898944
348035,5,6301748107,"""Scarlett Street"" is a 1945 film noir starring Edward G Robinson, Joan Bennett, and Dan Duryea billed as ""The Great Stars and Director of `Woman in the Window'"", a film they made a year earlier with Fritz Lang.

Film noir had its roots in German expressionism and films like ""The Blue Angel"" (1929) and ""M"" (1931) as well as American gangster films like ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" (1931) and ""Scarface"" (1932). Following WW 2, American films reached France where the audiences had a chance to watch several films together. When they saw ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941), ""Double Indemnity"" (1944), ""Laura"" (1944), ""Murder My Sweet"" (1944) and ""Window in the Window"" (1944), they coined the term ""film noir"" to refer to films that highlighted the seamy side of life and carried a cynical message.

The 1944 WITW film was not strictly film noir, and the ending was changed as the studio demanded a more positive conclusion. Joan Bennett used the influence of her then husband Walter Wanger to create a true film noir, and thus ""Scarlett Street"" was born.

The film stars Edward G Robinson (1893-1973) who gained fame as ""Little Caesar"" (1931) but who argued strongly to be permitted to play non-gangster roles, which he did in several subsequent films such as ""Five Star Final"" (1931), ""Tiger Shark"" (1932), and ""Kid Galahad"" (1937). By 1945 he was almost completely out of the gangster genre. Robinson does a good job in this film, but it's hardly among his best performances (see ""The Man with Two Faces"" for Robinson at his non-gangster best). What's interesting here is that Robinson plays a clerk whose real love is painting. In real life, Robinson was an actor whose real love was art.

Joan Bennett (1910-90) made more than 70 films and was nominated for an Emmy for her work on the TV series ""Dark Shadows"" (1966-71). She's best remembered for her role in this film and ""Scarlett Street"" and for the 1951 sex/shooting scandal involving her husband film producer Walter Wanger. She was the sister of actress Constance Bennett. As a blond, she played Harlow type roles in ""She Wanted a Millionaire"" (1932) and ""Me and My Gal"" (1932), but as a brunette, she made more serious films, like ""Trade Winds"" (1938), ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" (1939) and ""The Son of Monet Cristo"" (1940). I liked her best in ""Man Hunt"" (1941), the first of her films with Lang.

Dan Duryea (1907-68) was a marvelous character actor with a quick smile that barely hid a more sinister demeanor used to great effect in films like ""Criss Cross"" (1949), ""Winchester 73"" (1950) and ""Night Passage"" (1957). Director Fritz Lang used him in several films, including ""Ministry of Fear"" (1944) and ""Woman in the Window"" (1944).

Director Fritz Lang (1890-1976) was one of the fathers of film noir. More than anyone else he is responsible for popularizing the German school of expressionist film, with the ""Dr. Mabuse"" series (1922, 1933, 1960), ""Metropolis"" (1927), and ""M"" (1931). In 1934 he came to the US where he made such notable films as ""Fury"" (1936), ""The Return of Frank James"" (1940), ""Western Union"" (1940), and ""Hangman Also Die"" (1943). He followed  this film with ""Clash by Night"" (1952) and ""Rancho Notorious"" (1954). While he was never nominated for an Oscar, his work influenced the work of many directors, including Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock.

Dudley Nichols (1895-1960) wrote the screenplay. Nichols has the distinction of being the first person to refuse an Oscar, for his work on ""The Informer"" (1935). He would be nominated 3 more times (""The long Voyage Home"", ""Air Force"", ""The Tin Star"") but never won again. Among his notable films were ""The 3 Musketeers"" (1935), ""Stagecoach"" (1939), ""Gunga Din"" (1939), and ""Pinky"" (1949).

Milt Krasner (1904-88) provided the camerawork as he did in ""WITH"". He was nominated for an Oscar 6 times and won once - ""Three Coins in the Fountain"" (1954). He made more than 100 films. His other notable works include ""All About Eve"" (1950), ""The Dark Mirror"" (1946)"", ""House of Strangers"" and my favorite Krasner film - Fate is the Hunter"" (1965). The camerawork in this film is exceptional; up to some of Krasner's finest work.

Film noir flourished in the 40s, especially the mid 40s. 1944 film noir included ""Double Indemnity"", ""Laura"", ""Ministry of Fear"", ""Murder My Sweet"", ""To Have and Have Not"", ""Dark Waters"", and ""Phantom Lady"".

Bosley Crowther called it ""a sluggish and manufactured tale, emerging much more from sheer contrivance than from the passions of the characters involved"" and said Robinson ""performs monotonously"", and Bennett  ""is static and colorless"". He praised Duryea for ""making a vicious and serpentine creature out of a cheap, chiseling tinhorn off the streets."" But Variety was positive and said ""Two stars turn in top work to keep the interest high, and Dan Duryea's portrayal of the crafty and crooked opportunist whom Bennett loves is a standout in furthering the melodrama.""

The film was banned by the state of New York, and by cities like Milwaukee to Atlanta. Diana Corp (Lang, Bennet, and Wanger) successfully sued and a few minor changes were made and the film became a box office success thanks to all the publicity.

This is film noir at its best, and peculiarly, Fritz Lang film noir. Lang fans will notice the camera work, the reliance on chance (had Robinson not gone to the party, had it not been raining, had his friend not forgotten his own umbrella, had he not been walking just when Duryea and Bennet showed up, etc.), and the lure of young love.

See this film. It's a rare case when all the key elements of film noir are available in a single film.",1305590400,,5635,4.849115504682622

For some reason, I can handle depressing books much more than depressing movies, and, while Scarlet Street is probably one of the best noir gems, and a great piece of filmmaking, I think one viewing is enough for me. Nonetheless, I can appreciate the expert maneuvering within the film, the pace and mood, and the feeling it impresses upon its viewers. To get a viewer emotionally involved in a film is one of the greatest things a direct can accomplish, and Lang does that with this one because you feel genuinely for Edward G. Robinson's character Christopher Cross, who's about as snake bit for luck as Charlie Brown as he is strung along by Kitty and her boyfriend. Still, that being said, Fritz Lang's The Woman in the Window, featuring many of the same stars (Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett, Dan Duryea ), is equal in suspense and pacing and highly more enjoyable to view, maybe because it is Scarlet Street's antithesis in mood. Maybe The Woman in the Window is noir light, but it has such a lighter edge to it and didn't leave you feeling like you've had your spirit sucked out. Then, again maybe that's what the plan was; maybe Lang accomplished his goal. Maybe ""Scarlet Street"" was Lang's sly way of throwing a curve ball to viewers a year after making ""The Woman in the Window.""

The ending is right out of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment or a Shakespearean tragedy, with the murderer's conscience catching up with him, and him needing to deal with his inner being rather than outside forces. Rarely do I watch a film with so many despicable/weak-willed characters and a cynical, depressing ending and think back with admiration how it is created, but Scarlet Street somehow manages that. I can look back at Scarlet Street and really admire the way Fritz Lang crafted this film, which is almost like Noir 101, although the whole film has such a dark coldness to it.

As far as the film's transfer quality, it was marginal, but not bad enough to distract from the viewing experience.

I can respect this film's appreciation and the direction used without really liking the film itself. Scarlet Street is definitely one noir that is unforgettable in more ways than one.",1304726400,,2212,4.7376623376623375

348089,5,6301748107,"Chris Cross (Edward G. Robinson) has worked for his company for 25 years, and he is finally being rewarded for his hard work. After the extravagant party where he drinks and toasts with the bosses, Chris walks home late at night. He witnesses a beautiful girl (Joan Bennett) being hit by her boyfriend (Dan Duryea), but he thinks he was a stranger who was trying to rob her. Kitty plays along and asks him to buy her a drink.

The relationship is doomed from the start. Kitty thinks Chris is a wealthy artist, and her boyfriend persuades her to romance Chris for his money. Chris wants to make Kitty happy, so he begins stealing from his boss to rent a studio apartment for her, and for him to paint in. The boyfriend sells the paintings and says Kitty painted them, cheating Chris out of notoriety and cash.

Fritz Lang is an excellent noir director. The film oozes with seductive lighting and beautiful sets. Additionally, the paintings used for Cross' artworks are rather good and interesting. Their beauty adds to the beauty of the film. The common theme of ""Come to Me my Melancholy Baby"" is eerie and used masterfully.

Robinson, Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea), this is another tale of another middle-aged man getting mixed up with art and a young beauty and ending up involved in murder - but there the similarities largely end; whereas the earlier film is among the lightest and most broadly entertaining and humorous in the noir cycle, this film with many of the same creative personalities ends up one of the darkest and most despairing.

Christopher Cross (Robinson) is a bank teller, struggling to make ends meet and pushed around by a domineering wife (Rosalind Ivan) who he married for convenience - it's her apartment they live in.  He's dreamed of being a painter, and as the film opens he is being honored for his many years of service by his boss, who leaves the party early for a rendezvous with his mistress.  Cross invites a friend over to see his paintings, then wanders somewhat drunkenly homewards.  On the way, he spies a young woman being attacked by a man, and steps in to break it up.  The grateful young woman, Kitty March (Joan Bennett) allows Cross to take her home, and they stop for a drink at the bar under her building.  She's flirtatious with him, and he not used to these feelings ends up telling her that he paints, and not wanting to admit that he's a lowly teller, allows her to believe that he is a successful artist.  Warmed by drink and her attentions, he wants to join her in her apartment, but she shrugs him off....

Until, later on, her boyfriend, Johnny (Dan Duryea) has a different idea.  They both need money, and Kitty (whom Duryea refers to as ""Lazy Legs"") doesn't want to go back to modeling.  Johnny quickly hatches a plan to blackmail Chris, believing that he's a famous painter whose works sell for thousands.  Chris is only too willing to help out Kitty (with Johnny trying to stay in the background and pretending to be her roommate's boyfriend), going so far as to rent her an apartment of her own with money he's pilfered from his job - and with the secondary goal of having a place to paint for himself.  But soon the jig seems to be up, when Johnny finds out that Chris' paintings are worthless....or are they?

Lie piles on lie, as Chris' wife's dead husband comes back to blackmail him also - as Johnny concocts a plan to make Kitty out to be the real artist behind the suddenly popular primitives that Chris has painted, and as Chris continues to steal for a would-be mistress who has never loved him, and even at the end can only laugh at him, preferring the company of the brutal and lying Johnny and never realizing that Chris has any kind of strength in him at all, much less the strength to end their relationship as brutally as possible....

None of the main characters in Scarlet Street are admirable in the least - from the philandering bank president, to Chris' nasty wife Adele, always comparing him in the negative to the husband she thought dead (who in reality has no desire to return to her), to the lazy and foolish Kitty, the violent and deceitful Johnny, and the weak and rather dim and naive Chris, who in the end manages to escape the same terrible fates that some of the other characters have succumbed to - but suffers  a torment that is in some respects worse, and longer-lasting.  The final irony - his painting now known by the world, but attributed to someone else, is deliciously and coldly presented; the work lives on, but oh at what price, to all involved in its creation.  Perhaps a metaphor that it is often the sellers, and not the producers of the work, who are the beneficiaries of the profits and fame that accrue to them.

END OF SPOILERS

The whole cast is terrific - Robinson and Duryea excelling here albeit playing roles that were fairly typical for them, Bennett doing perhaps her most unpleasant and amoral femme fatale turn - and the photography and design manage to give the film a great New York feeling, despite the shot-in-studio Hollywood production; this is one of the best depictions of the relentless, get-ahead city life and the oppressiveness of the tenements from this period that I've seen, particularly in noir.  The Kino disc is short on extras but is unquestionably worth the price over the various public domain cheapo editions of the film, some of which are barely watchable.

348094,5,6301748107,"For me, one of the most interesting things about Fritz Lang's Hollywood film corpus is tracing the influence that German Expressionism had on it.  For example, the 1923 German film THE STREET maintained that once you left the safety of your own house, you were more susceptible to the malevolent elements of fate.  It was emphasized that the city streets are a dangerous, nightmarish place where a single misstep could very easily lead to ruin.

In Lang's THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW (1944) and SCARLET STREET (1945) this motif is fully realized.  In both films, it is Edward G. Robinson's character that, after a few drinks, strays out onto the street and into danger.  In SCARLET STREET, Christopher Cross (Robinson) leaves a party being given in his honor, and stumbles upon pimp Johnny Prince (Dan Duryea), who is striking his ""girlfriend"" Kitty March (Joan Bennett).

This second film may be the more cynical of the two, as Chris Cross was actually attempting to help Kitty when the trouble starts.  After spending some time drinking with Kitty at a local bar, Chris allows her to think that he is a big time painter who sells his artwork overseas.  When Johnny Prince gets wind of this, he has Kitty coerce Chris, taking advantage of Chris' natural attraction for Kitty.  And so the plot is set in motion, and the wheel of German Expressionist fate begins to turn.

SCARLET STREET is probably my favourite Fritz Lang film made in Hollywood.  Every aspect of the film is well done and the actors give memorable performances too.  A must-see for film noir buffs.

348127,5,6301748107,"Scarlet Street still sets a sort of standard for a mainstream Hollywood narrative film that also manages to be intelligent, literate and thematically rich. Director Fritz Lang actually reins in some of his more outrageous visual style to make a movie that focuses first-of-all on a great story, but then layers it with detail and meaning through such devices as set and costume design, as well as clever editing and innuendo. A film student could write an interesting paper on this film simply by examining the wallpaper alone, with florals regularly associated with the love of Christopher Cross (Edward G. Robinson) for Kitty (Joan Bennett) and jail-like bar patterns associated with Johnny (the super-annoying but perfectly-cast Dan Duryea, whose character in this film never shuts up). The use of costume is similarly rich. When Joan Bennett's Kitty first appears, in a clear plastic wrap and some very outrageous high heels, all sorts of dark undercurrents begin to churn within the viewer, as well as within Christopher Cross. Scarlet Street was surely an influence on everyone from David Lynch (see Cross' Lynchian apartment or the threatening but almost-fey quality of villainous Johnny) to Peter Greenaway (who certainly took the use of set design and costume as an extension of theme and character to an extreme in The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, as well as the concept of the sadistic, overtalkative villain). Lang also seems to anticipate some of the ways Antonioni would later express characters' inner states through settings and editing. And Lang accomplishes all this high-falutin' literary style, and even manages a social commentary on the high-brow New York art world, in a movie that also functions as pure popular, Hollywood-style entertainment.

Like Richard Widmark, Dan Duryea could play a weasel very effectively in one movie and then appear as equally effective in another as the good guy. Fritz Lang gives a very quirky edge to all the familiar character types appearing in this film. I saw a faded copy and was still blown away by it. I'm going to order the restored Kino print for my library dvd collection. Even if you don't care for film noir, but like old movies, please see this. Give it a chance to unfold and draw you into it.

Johnny gets wind of this and brainstorms an idea to get Katharine to try and get as much money as she can out of Chris since he has fallen for her.

348133,5,6301748107,"Actor Edward G. Robinson evokes many images: biblical figure, esteemed business executive, erudite professor, and perennial gangster.  In Fritz Lang's multi-layered noir classic Scarlet Street, Robinson convincingly portrays a meek, gulible store cashier who becomes intangled in a spider woman's alluring plot of deception.  Lang's film is filled with sexual themes that pushed the limits of Hollywood's protectionist Production Code.  The film's 1945 release date marked an immoral counterpoint to post WWII conventionality and American conservatism. Joan Bennett sizzles as the manipulative prostitute Kitty March.  Kitty willingly accepts the mental and physical abuse of her pimp played brilliantly by noir stalwart Dan Duryea.  But Kitty is no desperate fall girl, she has rationalized her relationship with Johnny as one enveloped in romantic love. To Kitty her ""marriage"" to Johnny is one that works because all couples that are deeply in love fight.  The only elements missing in Kitty's blissful world are respectful occupations, extended families, a home, children, and shared intimacy.  Lang's dark film purposely omits any hints of normalcy. Instead Kitty and Johnny's world is one characterized by street hustles, grifting, and deception.  Their meal ticket mark is Chris Cross (Edward G. Robinson) who washes dishes in an apron for a wife that still adores her first, late husband. Chris has spent 25 unnoticed years as a store cashier and only truely enjoys life when he paints on Sunday afternoons. That is until Chris meets Kitty.  Other reviewers have commented on the storyline, but a few scenes in this noir film are golden moments of the genre. When Kitty finally bursts Chris's naive bubble by shouting: "" I've been wanting to laugh in your face ever since I met you. You're old and ugly and I'm sick of you!"" murder becomes the only way for Chris to retain his manhood.  Chris has gotten away with murder not once, but twice. The innocent Johnny is sent to the electric chair for Kitty's murder and thus both of Chris's tormentors are gone.  Or are they really? Director Lang has weaved a complex picture that reveals many human weaknesses, vices, and temptations: embezzelment, infidelity, suicide, blackmail, prostitution, murder, injustice, and love are all present on this dark city canvass. This one is a must see and keeper for all noir enthusiasts.",1183507200,,2379,5.25065963060686

348166,5,6301748107,"The film Scarlet Street (1945), based on a novel by Georges de La Fouchardire, was produced and directed by Fritz Lang (Dr. Mabuse: The Gambler, M, The Big Heat), and stars Edward G. Robinson (Little Caesar, Double Indemnity, Key Largo), Joan Bennett (The Man in the Iron Mask, The Woman in the Window), and Dan Duryea (Criss Cross, The Flight of the Phoenix).  Also appearing is Margaret Lindsay (The House of the Seven Gables), Jess Barker (The Night Walker), Rosalind Ivan (Johnny Belinda), and Charles Kemper (Gallant Journey).

As the film begins we meet a character named Christopher Cross (Robinson), a timid and unassuming middle-aged man, who is celebrating his 25th anniversary as a cashier in a department store.  After the party winds down, a tipsy Chris gets turned around somewhere in Greenwich Village and comes across a woman taking the beating from a man, and rescues her, sort of...turns out the attacker, whose face we don't get to see, was fairly drunk and easily enough chased away.  Anyway, Chris is immediately taken with the woman, a wannabe actress named Katharine 'Kitty' March (Bennett), allowing her to believe he's a wealthy artist, rather than telling her the dismal truth (seems Chris fancies himself a painter, but it's more or less a hobby rather than a career option).  Here's where things get complicated...unbeknownst to Kitty Chris is lowly nine to fiver, married to a shrill harpy named Adele (Ivan), theirs being a marriage of convenience, and unbeknownst to Chris Kitty is involved with a real slick huckster named Johnny Prince (Duryea), the same guy who appeared to be attacking her on the street (turns out he was just trying to get some gambling money).  Anyway, Johnny, ever the schemer, believing Chris to be a man of means, convinces Kitty to schmooze him up a bit for some dough, which she does, but Chris, who's a real sap, hasn't the green, so he procures it from his skinflint wife.  Eventually Chris eventually comes clean to Kitty about the fact he's married and ends up setting her up in a posh pad, which allows not only for him to visit her, but also gives him a place to pursue his painting, something his wife thinks is a waste.  Through a series of circumstances involving Johnny trying to sell Chris' paintings (he and Kitty still believe Chris to be a famous artist), Chris' works actually gain some attention, resulting in Johnny talking Kitty into pretending she painted them, rather than Chris (this wasn't too difficult given Chris never signed his own works).  Anyway, as Kitty becomes famous Chris discovers the ruse (only Kitty's part, not her involvement with Johnny), and goes along with it, living vicariously through Kitty given the fact his work is garnering so much attention, but things turn sour once Chris learns of Kitty's involvement with Johnny along with how they've been playing him for a world class sucker...I won't say what happens but I will tell you a sharp implement is involved...

Of most all of the films I've watched recently, which is quite a few, this one had the most intricate storyline.  If you've read through the previous paragraph it may seem like I've related a lot, but in actuality I've only touched upon a small number of highlights.  There's so much more going on, in terms of both characters mentioned and those that weren't...everything about this feature worked for me, including the immaculate direction, the engaging writing, and the excellent performances.  One aspect I was unsure of early on was the character played by Edward G. Robinson in that it seemed so different than what I've come accustomed to with some of his other films I've seen as I'm more or less used to seeing him portray hardnosed gangster types, not spineless, easily manipulated saps.  Once I got past my own preconceived typecasting, though, it went down a lot easier, helped immeasurably by the fact Edward G. Robinson is probably one of the best actors to come out of the American cinema.  As far as the other performers, Joan Bennett played her part perfectly as she was able to maintain her character's pretense of decorum, at least enough for a lovesick sap to buy off on, but once her character's guard was down we saw her for what she really was, an opportunist who desperately sought the affections of another, even more opportunistic individual played by Dan Duryea, whose character was about as oily and charming (and misogynistic) as they come.  Seriously, this is the type of guy who could talk you out of your skin and be long gone before you realized what happened.  One of my favorite sequences from the film comes as Kitty relates to Johnny the fact Chris is married and given they way his mind works, he suggests maybe Kitty can pry some money from Chris if it were thought by him that somehow his wife might learn of his relationship (which was nonsexual, by the way) with Kitty.  Kitty replies about that being blackmail, to which Johnny states,

""It's only blackmail, baby, when you're dumb enough to get caught.""

As I said the direction is wonderful as there was never a time when I wasn't engrossed in the material, which flows at a steady pace.  One really interesting aspect for me was near the end, when Chris finally allows himself to realize his tragic folly, and reacts in a shocking, but not unexpected manner.  All in all this is probably one of the best film noir features I've seen in awhile, and I'd highly recommend it as an example of a truly unique and fascinating feature within the genre.

The fullscreen (1.33:1) picture on this Kino Video DVD release looks sharp and clean, and it is indicated on the DVD case that digital transfer was culled from the 35mm negative preserved by The Library of Congress.  There are a few, minor flaws, but they're barely noticeable.  The Dolby Digital audio comes across very well, matching the quality of the picture.  There are a couple of extras including an audio commentary track with author David Kalat and gallery containing images of promotional materials, deleted scenes, and some script excerpts.

By the way, it seems there are a few, different DVD releases of this floating about, but I can only speak towards the quality of the one released by Kino Video, which seemed the priciest of the bunch.  As far as the others, well, buyer beware...",1162512000,7,6326,4.815327793167128
348167,5,6301748107,"For so long dogged by unacceptable public domain DVD transfers, Kino has come up with a decent version of this masterpiece at last.

The relentless determinism and intellectual rigour of Fritz Lang's oppressively tragic universe does not give his viewers much cheer but his is a moving and valid vision nonetheless. Scarlet Street is possibly his bleakest film and is based on material that also inspired Jean Renoir's La Chienne (1931). I find this version the more compelling partly because the tight, closed worlds of American film noir crime dramas with their dark, cobbled streets devoid of many sources of light are perfectly attuned to Lang's sensibility; and partly because I love the leading actors-Edward G Robinson, Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea.

Robinson's finely-shaded acting (like Claude Rains he always gets it just right) is a tour de force: he captures to a tee the pathetic vulnerability of the retiring cashier Christopher Cross, who, hen-pecked by a shrewish wife (splendidly vicious Rosalind Ivan), nurses aspirations of escape into a retirement spent in amateur painting. In a chance encounter following his retirement dinner that could only have been engineered by the Fates and shot in Lang's most expressionistically oneiric style, he ""saves"" actress-cum-hooker Joan Bennett from a beating by ""boyfriend"" Dan Duryea (a whining pimp in a pin-stripe suit) and proceeds to develop a romantic obsession for her. Joan Bennett is a really class act as the sleazy, opportunistic femme fatale who trades on Robinson's delusions to gain entry to the lucrative art world by signing her name to his naive paintings.

As events pursue an inexorable path towards tragedy (in the truest classical sense of the term), Lang draws on arresting imagery from the art world to explore Robinson's middle-aged fantasies/delusions about his idee fixe (Bennett).This is complemented by Lang's precise chiaroscuro and stylized noir ambience to create an atmosphere of suffocating entrapment.

Paradoxically, the film combines these elements with some well-chosen domestic detail which is filmed with a naturalistic authenticity that is equally oppressive. It all adds up to a complex claustrophobic experience.

The final sequences are a descent into a hellish nightmare as Robinson, having literally gotten away with murder, is pursued by his conscience (the ""Furies"") and ends his days as a pitiful tramp on a park bench hearing voices in his head. For the audience it provides a catharsis worthy of its Greek models but it was incidentally a flagrant breach of the then-prevailing Hays code by the back door(with the wrong man being executed for the murder Robinson committed, and Robinson in a technical though not a moral sense, going unpunished for his crime).",1157068800,2,2766,5.291571753986332

348174,3,6301748107,"Edward G Robinson often played a tough guy, but he occasionally went in the opposite direction.  In this movie he played a wimp, a henpecked nebbish, who snapped.

There are a few turnarounds to look for.  The most obvious one is the moment when he snaps, when he changes from an abused wimp into a man who won't take any more abuse.  The change doesn't fit him though, leading him to act out of character and do something he lives to regret.

An almost comedic turnaround happens when we meet his wife's previous husband.  The shrewish and demanding wife always used that husband as a weapon to make poor Edward feel inferior, but when the prior husband suddenly appears in the flesh, not dead after all, he doesn't live up to his press clippings.

A striking turnaround occurs, in more ways than one, when Edward rescues a damsel in distress from a thief on the street who is pushing her around, only to find out later that his damsel in distress is in love with her attacker and thoroughly enjoys the distress he puts her through.

This femme fatale illustrates that many women feel sexual chemistry with confident, cocky men, not with nice, attentive guys who are eager to please.  It's actually course 101 in how to pick up a girl, minus the slapping.

In fact, next time you think of buying a book to teach you how to win the interest of a new girl, don't buy the book, just watch Scarlett Street.  Do what the villain does, and avoid doing or saying anything that Edward G Robinson says and does.  Be cocky and brash, self centered and demanding, and you have just improved your odds.

Girls may like wimps as friends, but being too attentive too soon makes you look needy and desperate, and places you in the ""friend"" category right off the bat.  Make her think she has to do her best to impress you, not the other way around.  Watch Dan Duryea giving a lesson in how to make girls fall for you.  Now you know why all the pretty girls went with gorillas in high school and ignored you.

The ending is a Hollywood ending.  The human conscience is more punishing than the law could ever be.  Somehow I doubt that.  I can't picture Saddam Hussein tormented about all the poor Kurds he hurt.  But this is Hollywood, not Iraq.

I could have accepted Robinson's torment as being unique to himself and therefore believable, but it is set up by someone's comment that this degree of remorse is to be expected.  Baloney.

Other reviews on this site indicate that the film was forced into showing all the remorse because it was necessary to punish Robinson for his crime, without sending him to prison.  I believe it.  I believe that the moviemakers felt compelled to do that.

It explains but doesn't excuse the unreality of the ending.  I could only buy that degree of remorse if they had set it up for me, as a very special case unique to this one character.  They didn't.",1140998400,,2873,4.481695568400771

Joan Bennett is deliciously fun as the nave Kitty and was probably never better.

Even when he discovers that Kitty has been selling his paintings and keeping the money, Kitty's charm wins him over and he forgives her easily.

Robinson was once again seduced and victimized by femme fatale Joan Bennett, only this time the nightmare was real. ""Scarlet Street"" is a haunting and incredibly bleak film noir and is unquestionably one of Fritz Lang's best movies. I've seen three previous versions of this classic on dvd, and everyone had an awful picture and sound quality. Now at last, Lang's masterpiece can be seen like never before, with an excellent restored print used for the Kino release. This dvd is a definite must for any fan of film noir!",1133136000,10,1997,4.752161383285302
348217,5,6301748107,"When a painfully humble cashier (Edward G.Robinson) saves a woman (Joan Bennett) from being beaten up by a man (Dan Duryea), he little knows what he's set himself up for. Kitty March (Bennett) is a streetwalker and Johnny Prince (Duryea) is her pimp-boyfriend. Chris Cross (Robinson) falls for her thinking she's single and a struggling ""actress"". She thinks Cross is a wealthy artist. Prince goads her into fleecing him but things get even more seriously complicated than that. Cross is poor and married to a harridan yet he allows himself to be manipulated and used by the sexy Kitty. Fine film produced and directed by Fritz Lang has great performances from the entire cast and a wonderful script. Sleazy story elements are made palatable and engrossing thanks to first class treatment. Robinson is excellent as Cross, an already broken man whose last chance at happiness is blown to smithereens by Bennett and Duryea. The DVD print from Kino is marvelous---sharp and clear. A must for lovers of classic films and a real collector's item. Enjoy.",1132963200,3,1048,4.994285714285715

This is, without question, the best quality edition available. (All other distributors offer variations of the same grainy, fuzzy, dupey-looking public-domain print that's been circulating for years.) SCARLET STREET is a remake of Jean Renoir's LA CHIENNE (THE BITCH), and it would have been great if Kino could have released both titles as a Double Feature.

More people know Woman In The Window and usually it is thought of as a better film, but I'll take Scarlet Street over Window anytime, as I feel it is a bit more harder edged and comes without the soft ending that Window has that leaves me a bit flat. Both great films, both are a must for noir fans, and both star Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett and one of my favorite bad guys, the very underrated Dan Duryea. Worth the 25.00 price of admission as I am sure if you are a noir lover, it will be one you watch many times over in the coming years.",1132531200,8,1031,4.26530612244898

That is excellent news for fans of Film Noir.  This is a very good to excellent movie (depending on your tastes), and it deserves much better than the shoddy treatment it has received on virtually all the other DVD releases of this title to date.  The cast is excellent, and features Edward G. Robinson, Dan Duryea, and Joan Bennett.

If you are considering buying Scarlet Street, then the Kino version is the only one to buy.

(Update: The image on the Kino DVD is amazingly sharp when compared to the other versions currently available, but there is one minor issue with the Kino release; there are some instances of ""combing,"" (visible scan lines or ""ghosting""), in the picture. To the untrained eye it isn't very noticeable, if at all.  There is no question that this, even with the minor combing issue, is still BY FAR the best release of this title ever on DVD.

348221,2,6301748107,"BUYERS BEWARE!!  Any video produced by Alpha is going to be questionable.  This DVD produced by this outfit is absolutely horrid.  The films jerks and there are points of black outs during scenes in various places.  It kept me from otherwise enjoying a fine example of 40's film noir.  The sound varies from clear to distortion at points as well.  This would have been a thoroughly enjoyable flicks if they had produced it from a restored master, such as the kind that TCM uses on their network.  The movie itself is replete with fine performances, most notably by Edward G. Robinson as a middle aged man trapped in an unhappy married who falls in love with a prostitute played by Joan Bennett.  Though I question credibility in his character....nobody could be so stupid as to be taken in by this woman unless he was so blinded by love and unhappiness that he failed to see how she was using him.  Its a true, haunting portrait of a sad, lonely, frustrated man who becomes Schizophrenic at the end.  It is truly a remarkable performance.  Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea (the prostitute and her pimp) are equally fine in their respective roles.  The film is a dark and moody piece but it certainly is in need of a decent film transfer.  The DVD here is horrendous.  If you can overlook this flaw, you may be able to at least enjoy watching this fine film.  Needless to say, other than scene selection, no other extras are included in Alpha's cheap product which is the reason I give this product (not the movie) 2 stars.",1124236800,3,1517,4.546125461254612
348222,3,6301748107,"Edward G. Robinson plays meek middle aged bank cashier and amateur painter Christopher Cross in Fritz Lang's somewhat disappointing ""Scarlet Street"".  Robinson, henpecked and mired in a loveless marriage of convenience with a harpy for a wife has a chance meeting with sultry streetwalker Kitty March played by Joan Bennett.  The plain looking Robinson fall head over heels with Bennett.  None too smart, she gets the impression that he's a wealthy and celebrated painter.  In cohoots with her boyfriend, the sleazy  Johnny Prince played by Dan Duryea they string him along siphoning him for money which helps set them up in a posh apartment.  Robinson is allowed to use the pad for an art studio where he also stores his paintings.

This bizarre relationship continues and Bennett and Duryea's demands for cash grow larger and Robinson resorts to stealing.  Duryea gets the idea to have Robinson's amateurish artwork appraised.  Amazingly an established art critic views several of his works an an outdoor Greenwich Village art exhibit and annoints the works as created by a genius.  When the scheming duo of Bennett and Duryea get wind of this unlikely bit of good fortune they set it up as if Bennett was actually the artist of the unsigned works.

Bennett gains celebrity status which is curiously all right with the lovestruck Robinson.  Things are going famously for Duryea and Bennett until in a fit of rage she tells off Robinson, revealing her true feelings.  Robinson goes beserk and kills her, framing Duryea for the murder.  Robinson gets away with the crime but his conscience gets the better of him.  He becomes a prisoner of his own mind wandering the streets as a mentally deluded drunken bum.

Lang's controversial film really didn't present much to make it anything special.  The acting was OK but Robinson was miscast in this role.  The fact that Robinson was in essence unpunished for his crime was against the censureship codes of moviemaking at the time and the film was banned at the box office.",1119571200,2,2018,4.937685459940653
348223,5,6301748107,"Director Fritz Lang makes ""Scarlet Street"" into a full-blown film noir in this 1945 adaptation of the French play ""La Chienne"", based on the novel by Georges de la Fouchardire. French director Jean Renoir made an earlier cinematic adaptation in 1931 that incorporated his signature social criticism. Lang's film is about individual personalities, how and why they interact, and to what consequence.

Christopher Cross (Edward G. Robinson) dreamed of being a great painter when he was a young man, but ended up being a cashier, profoundly lonely, and stuck in a loveless marriage to an insufferable wife. Painting still makes Chris happy, though, and he paints every Sunday to please himself. One evening he helps a young woman on the street and accompanies her to a nearby bar. Kitty (Joan Bennett) claims that she is an actress and feigns interest in Chris' artwork, and he is flattered by her attentions. Kitty's boyfriend Johnny (Dan Duryea), a slick con artist who will do anything to avoid work, suggests that she continue to flatter Chris and milk him for money. Chris rents Kitty an apartment where he can paint and be with her. And Johnny and Kitty sell some of his paintings, passing them off as Kitty's work. Oddly, Chris doesn't mind...until he discovers the true nature of Kitty and Johnny's relationship.

""Scarlet Street"" owes its success to the performances of Edward G. Robinson and Joan Bennett, as well as Fritz Lang's choice not to speak too well of anyone. Chris's plight is sympathetic. He's a talented man who has spent all of his life in a  monotonous job and his recent years being demeaned by a shrill wife. But at the same time, ""Scarlet Street"" mocks Chris for being so gullible and desperate that he falls for Kitty's barely disguised  seduction and her completely undisguised greed. Joan Bennett's trashy, sassy turn as Kitty is authentic and memorable. Kitty and Johnny are a couple of inherently lazy slobs in sharp contrast to Chris' diligence and refinement. As in all film noirs, everyone ultimately falls victim to his own flaws. ""Scarlet Street"" is a solid film noir with memorable characterizations from one of cinema's great directors.

My 5-star rating is for the movie, not the DVD. ""Scarlet Street"" is available on 2 DVDs as of this writing: A Gotham disc (2002) and as part of Questar's ""5 Film Noir Killer Classics"" 6-disc set (2004). Neither is a restored print of the film, but the discs are inexpensive. If you really need a quality transfer, wait until someone decides to restore this film.",1114992000,2,2537,4.9044289044289044

In that world he gives wings to his fantasy , and those dreams become his identity signal . The unhappiness and the loneliness are his real beloved friends . Suddenly this fantasy world will open widely when his alter ego is pulled into world of crime by Joan Bennet and his manipulative boyfriend Duyrea. He falls in love with Joan very soon he'll discover a shock revelation: the first husband of his wife is still alive , so he thinks at last the happiness knocked the door of his destiny but ...

Only the fertile imagination of Fritz Lang could give this melodramatic plot a touch of genius . Once more , we should remember that Lang was one of the greatest directors in the cinema story . Since he left Germany after finnishing The testament of Dr. Mabuse ; he decided to work in United States and he'll find out in the film noir the perfect vehicle to express the dark shadows and the haunting ghosts that will appear unavoidable in the mind .

And being Lang one of the most remarkable sons of the german expressionism , to face that challenge was perfectly adequate to his skills and abilities .

If you're a hard fan of the film noir ; you find in this genre that the hell is in your mind , the guilty has no ending and nobody deserves a bit of trust . The love , under these circunstances is unable of growing up and the road for the weakness , the evilness and the cruelty are clear to shine .

In my personal selection of unforgettable Lang's films' american stages, I find several that form part of the top list : Fury , You only live once ; The Woman in the window , Big heat and Clash by night.

348279,4,6301748107,"Poor Edward G. Robinson.  That is to say, poor Christopher Cross, the character Robinson plays in SCARLET STREET (presumably no relation to the 80's pop ""star"" of the same name, although that would explain a lot).  Chris is trapped in a loveless marriage to a woman who looks like Edith Bunker and acts like Archie.  He's a middle-aged bank-cashier who has gone through life having never truly been loved nor having loved anyone himself.  The one enjoyable thing he has in his life is his art, his paintings - which his totalitarian wife has banished to the bathroom, as she hates the smell of his paints.  So, when this poor, downtrodden, lonely man happens upon a young and beautiful woman, it's easy to see how he could be utterly manipulated by her.
At first, I thought I was going to be bored by this film.  It takes its time setting up the scenario and the various characters.  But once the plot gets cooking, I was completely engrossed.  I love a film that surprises me, and I simply could not guess where this story was going.  As one nears the end, surprise revelations and unexpected bombshells come exploding out like fireworks.  And every revelation was logical and consistent, but startling.  I made several mental predictions, and after I started getting all of them wrong, I just sat back and let the film overtake me.
Fritz Lang's direction makes this a darker film than even the screenplay probably anticipated.  There are several scenes that are still unsettling today.  The more experimental sequences near the end are quite haunting.  It's certainly not a feel-good movie; the only characters that aren't out and out despicable are merely pathetic.  I won't give away the ending, but it's enough to say that there is no ""...and they all lived happily ever after"".  People get what they deserve, and in SCARLET STREET, they deserve a hell of a lot of it.
The acting is quite good across the board, with a few notables.  Edward G. Robinson is, of course, great.  If that man ever gave a poor performance, then I have yet to see it.  Here, he is playing against type -- an apron-wearing, totally dominated, shell of a man.  He conveys a genuinely sad loneliness by his mere expressions as his confidence crumbles at every indignity and the way he desolately clings to any scrap of love he can find.  You'd completely forget this was the man who played tough gangster Johnny Rocco in KEY LARGO.  Dan Duryea is possibly laying it on a little thick as the sleazy, scheming boyfriend, but that sort of thing is what the role calls for.  Joan Bennett rounds out the cast as Kitty March, the woman who lets Cross fall in love with her, and then takes him for as much cash as she can.
The DVD released by Alpha Video has some flaws.  However, since it is the only one on the market at the moment, we're stuck with it.  The picture is decent, but not what I would call great.  There are a numerous scratches and the image is a little fuzzy.  On one or two occasions, the movie skips a few seconds ahead.  The sound quality I would describe as adequate, but muffled.  A few times, I had to rewind because I couldn't hear what the actors were saying.  It's not a wholly awful disc, but I wouldn't get your hopes up as to its overall quality.  Perhaps a better print of this film will show up on DVD; until then, we'll have this.  And this is quite a cheap disc, so it does have that advantage.",1053302400,46,3400,4.513911620294599

Sit back and allow yourself a good broody watch. The story is tragic. It pulls no punches. It's also pretty raw. Some scenes have double entendres that still shock a bit today. And the climactic scene saw the film banned in parts of the U.S. Not to mention irony out in force with twists of fate (more likes socks to the gut, some of them literal) that happen throughout the film. You might find yourself on a slippery slope wondering whom to root for and who to despise. None of the characters are perfect. All are fatally flawed. And all get their just desserts in some way or form, whether deserved or not.

Edward G. Robinson is brilliant in his role of beaten down lackey/unhappy husband/naive idealist. Dan Duryea is downright creepy as the man who pimps out our lovely leading lady Joan Bennett for his own mercenary gains. There is an easy flow between these three actors which accounts for genuine emotions and solid performances. The three had worked together previously in The Lady in the Window also directed by Lang, and are a terrific trio.

There are lessons to be learned amid the melodrama. The what goes around comes around karma aspect remains valid.
