8101430,5,B000CS448Y,This is definitely worth the money. It's great because you can get a good little workout when you really only have a few minutes to spare. I might do two or three 8 minute workouts for a single workout.,1371600000,,202,4.205128205128205
8101431,5,B000CS448Y,"For anyone who doesn't love exercise, this is for you!  You can change your body in the course of 16 minutes a day in about 2 months!  I am not joking.  I do one ab exercise each day with either an arm or leg/butt one for a total of 16 minutes each day.  Doesn't look like it would do much, but please trust me on this...IT DOES...You will feel it the next day.  I felt a difference in my body in about a month and in two months, my body looked amazing!!!  My back and shoulders defined.  I do not work with weights at all the first couple of months.  After that, I do up to 3 and 5 pound hand weights depending on the exercise.  I do not want to build bulk, just definition. I have yet to come across a better body workout that you don't have to invest hours in.  I can handle either 8 minutes to 16 minutes and no one will know you spent sooo little time!  I actually have a spare of this workout, just in case something happens to my other one!  You can work out when you travel as well....no equipment necessary!",1342483200,,1016,4.025
8101432,5,B000CS448Y,"This is a wonderful workout for the time-crunched.  As another review said, it's not the amount of time but the quality of the workout.  And I also hate long-winded workouts.  The timers on both sides of the screen allow me to know how much I've done and how much is left.  I mix this dvd w/other dvds, cardio, yoga, other pilates.  This is a tough workout, too!",1226880000,,362,4.343283582089552
8101433,4,B000CS448Y,"I guess I need to get past the SUPER terrible production quality, but it's a decent workout- I think I was expecting more out of it. Since it's only 8 minutes, there isn't enough time to explain all the moves- I could have used another 2 minutes to just explain what was going on.
All in all, it's okay, but I prefer the 10 minute series.",1205193600,,338,4.136363636363637
8101434,4,B000CS448Y,I have the 8 min abs and buns series also and love those.  This is perfect for me (and I'm sure many other single moms!).  I get the work-out I need and feel good after.  Hard to believe you can sweat in only 8 minutes but with this you can!,1142467200,7,241,3.78
8101435,5,B000CS448Y,"I've never tried Pilates in my life but being bored with the slow pace of yoga and not satisfied with formal cardio and strenght training, I needed something that bridges the two.

Don't let the 8 Minute title sway you away from this DVD. It's not the quantity but the quality of the exercises. This DVD does just that. I was sweating, burning (in a good way), and felt like I had a work out.

The best part is that on both sides of the screen you have timers counting down so you don't wonder when this will end. And let me tell you, the exercises can be torture but in a good way sometimes. You really feel everything working. After a week of using this along wth MTV Pilates: Mix I find my posture to be better, everything is tightning, and I have muscle definition. This is coming from a 200 lb. male who loathes the gym.

The DVD has three different intensity workouts: Beginner, Intermendiate, and Advanced.",1137542400,26,913,4.390532544378698
