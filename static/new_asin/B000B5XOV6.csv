2400641,4,B000B5XOV6,"""The Snow Fort"" contains two wintry episodes of the show and two that don't really have anything to do with this theme, but are still good fun. This show has excellent CGI animation, bright and interesting characters, and most noteably, at least three or four wonderfully composed songs and themes in every episode.

""The Snow Fort"" --- Uniqua and Tasha become Ski Patrollers and come upon a snow fort, believing that there may be people inside needing rescuing. What they don't know is that Mounties Pablo and Tyrone are inside and are setting traps, believing them to be invaders. A fun and comic episod.e

""The Yeti"" --- Uniqua, Tasho and Tyrone team up track a yeti (Pablo) --- but Tasha insists that there's no such thing. Teaches kids about listening to others and not fighting.

""Knights are Brave and Strong"" --- This was the series premiere. Queen Tasha has a message to send to King Austin and she assigns the task to Uniqua the Pink. This is a very adventurous episode that teaches about overcoming obstacles and believing in your abilities.

""Secret Mission"" --- The most fun of any of the episodes on here. Pablo, Tryone and Uniqua team up as secret agents. They dress up in secret agent gear, create secret agent themes and have secret agent gadgets. Viewers learn that secret agents must think quickly, have backup plans, and be resourceful. Good advice for life in general too!

Why have I given this four stars out of five? Well, one reason is that I'm a big believer that DVDs of all types should have nice special features. This DVD has trailers for releases, a couple of music videos and that's about it. Another reason is that I think they should have included a different episode than the premiere ""Knights Are Brave and Strong"" --- this episode is already available on another DVD. Finally, all of the episodes except this one are missing Austin --- for some reason he is simply left out.",1139011200,9,1911,4.709580838323354
2400642,5,B000B5XOV6,"This DVD contains four more wonderful adventures of Pablo (the blue penguin), Tyrone (the brown moose), Uniqua (the pink spotted female of indeterminate species), Tasha (the yellow hippo, and Austin (the purple kangaroo)

Each adventure takes place in the imaginations of the five friends who turn their shared backyard into different fantasy worlds, each episode full of song and dance numbers of various music genres.

This DVD has four episodes:

1. The Snow Fort: Pablo and Tyrone are brave and fearless Mounties, defending their snow fort and the treasure within.  Tasha and Uniqua are Ski Patrollers with a thermos full of hot chocolate, just looking for someone to rescue.  Mounties on duty! Ski Patrol to the rescue! An action packed adventure set to a Country music theme.

2. The Yeti: Four funky songs and a catchy cry of ""Yeti yeti yeti yeti!"" as the friends hunt the elusive hairy, smelly, raisin-eating Yeti.

3. Knights Are Brave and Strong: Uniqua the Pink battles the Moose of the Mist and the Guardian of the Gate to deliver an important message from Queen Tasha to King Austin. Big band swing and four new songs.

4. Secret Mission: Saving the best for last, secret agents Pablo, Tyrone and Uniqua negotiate the booby traps in a treasure museum to the beat of the tango and limbo.

Four more examples of why the Backyardigans belong in any kid's collection.

2400643,5,B000B5XOV6,"The backyardigans is the first time in a long time that I have wanted to go out and buy TV episodes on a DVD.

This show is a breath of refreshing air.  I love how they can turn their backyards into any great adventure with thier imagination.  Every episode not only introduces a new story BUT carries a specific music genre theme throughout.

My daughter has watched it many times since we bought it.

This DVD has 4 great episodes.

definate 5 stars and great addition to a preschoolers DVD library.",1135900800,2,501,4.450549450549451
2400644,5,B000B5XOV6,"I have a little brother who is 7, and severely disabled,(He's on a 9 month old level) Not much catches his eye, but one day when he was throwing a tantrum, I put it on nick jr,and noticed he stopped crying when he heard the sound of the  singing  Backyardigans. He couldn't stop looking at the colorful animation. This show is a lifesaver! It kept him entertained for the whole 30min. I'd heard about the show from a friend,who has a 1 yr old who loves the show, and she told me to try it out. I took her advice and my brother loved it! And as soon as I saw it on VHS, I bought it. He loves ""the snow fort"", but his favorite is ""the Yeti"", He laughs the whole time the penguin sings ""The Yeti Stomp"". I also  bought him ""It great to be a ghost"" DVD  for christmas. I recommend this for any little children, it works like a charm.[^_^]",1134777600,4,834,4.067073170731708
2400645,4,B000B5XOV6,"My 3-yr-old daughter loves the Backyardigans.  Both shows are very cute and have great music.  One thing to note is that in the ""YETI"" episode there is an avalanche and a large snowball rolls down after the kids.  My daughter started crying when this happened and thought they were going to be hurt.  It took her over a week to get past this and realize they're ok.  Other than that, both episodes are great.",1133740800,5,408,4.45945945945946
2400646,5,B000B5XOV6,"Nickelodeon's new smash hit the Backyardigans seems to appeal to all ages, from 2-year-olds to 11-year-olds, and even to adults.  The colorful animation, catchy songs, and exciting adventures, make up one of the best animated shows currently on television.  These 5 ""kids"" venture out into the backyard, only to end up on some incredible adventure, but they always manage to be back in the house for snacktime.

You get 4 backyard adventures on this DVD, and the first two, are snow themed.  They managed to conveniently release the first 2 Backyardigans DVD's of this show around Halloween and Christmas, but without having any one show set in the Halloween or Xmas theme.  That's fine, as they will get some serious play, long after the holidays are over.

The colorful characters look great against the snow backgrounds and just on visuals alone, should keep any kid glued to the set.  Never mind the catchy tunes, including the Yeti stomp, which is my kids' favorite.  There is only one thing on this DVD that might upset someone, and that is if your kid is an Austin fan.  He seems to be MIA for 3 out of the 4 episodes.  You are much better getting the first DVD of the Backyardigans if your child's favorite is Austin, as they won't see much of him here.

Overall, a must have for the Backyardigans fan.  If your child has never seen them, they will surely be hooked after one episode.  If you are looking for the best DVD Xmas gift to get someone, this is it!",1131753600,21,1467,4.574712643678161
2400647,5,B000B5XOV6,"This morning my 20-month-old woke up and said, ""Tomp, tomp!""  She was referring to ""The Yeti Stomp,"" one of the many fine songs available on the new Backyardigans collection ""The Snow Fort.""  So clearly she likes it, which is a relief because I was worrying that I was enjoying the show more than she was.

But why is it surprising that they've made a show that's as appealing to adults as to children?  Adults--parents, anyway--think kids are interesting.  Kids think other kids are interesting. Why shouldn't a show that presents kids in a fairly realistic way be interesting to both parents and kids?

Of course, by ""fairly realistic,"" I mean that they're portrayed as computer-animated anthropomorphic animals--a moose, a hippo, a penguin, a kangaroo and I guess a bug of some sort.  And I guess it's not particularly realistic that they break in to choreographed song and dance numbers at regular intervals, though it is fun.  I particularly like that the music from each episode is in a particular genre (i.e. Western swing, Big Band jazz), which may or may not have anything to do with the episode.

I also like how The Backyardigans are mapping out our collective fantasy world--all the things that are fun to imagine, suitable for the pre-K set anyway.  This collection includes Mounties, secret agents, knights and a Yeti.  I have to agree with my daughter that the Yeti is the best, but they're all pretty good.

By giving this five stars, I mean to say, ""Yes, you should buy this.  Definitely.  Yeah, go ahead.""",1131667200,16,1523,4.8076923076923075

2400681,5,B000B5XOV6,"My children have all of the Backyardigan's dvds and this is still one of their favorites. It follows the same format of the characters going to the backyard and coming up with an advanture. Their adventure varies by day (so do the characters) which holds the children's attention well. They have thought of everything....not sure how they come up with them all. They do whatever the daily adventure is and learn a leason and return to their backyards and go home for a ""healthy"" snack.

I have always enjoyed the story lines that they come up with and so do my children. I have always looked for educational shows for my kids to watch while I am busy doing another task. These dvds always keep their attention and give them ideas on what they can do with their playtime as well. I also like that they always have a healthy snack instead of ice cream and candy that probably would be what most kids would want.

I recommend this for any child 5 and under. My daughter is still six and enjoys them but it is designed I believe for preschool age children. I find that it is educational and definately worth the money.",1319328000,,1114,4.455882352941177
