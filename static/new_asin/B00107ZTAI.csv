8589585,4,B00107ZTAI,"This extremely eye-opening film is a semi-lighthearted, semi-humorous expose of Swiss culture and the Germanic subculture that runs it, amidst the nation's mix of Germanic, French, and Italian subcultures.  The two main characters are Swiss immigration officers, and the senior officer, named Bodmer, is extremely unsettling in his Torquemada-like manner of interrogating citizenship applicants and his constant use of all the most crude demographic stereotypes to characterize people.

On the other hand, his trainee partner, Fischer, while more relaxed in his approach to people, is also unsettling in how he seems at first to be using his power as an officer to intimidate a female applicant into a romantic relationship with him.  However, by the end of the film, when his improprieties with the woman are mercilessly exposed by Bodmer, he does the right thing as apparently he'd planned to do all along, and so that does redeem the film considerably.

All in all, this film is done very well for a 1978 production and everything is very believable, but the subject matter is still very creepy and disturbing as the stakes are so high here, and Swiss society seems so incredibly shallow and tense all around.

Oh, and one other thing:  Although this film is recorded in PAL format and will not play on DVD or Blu-Ray pleyers, it will play on computer DVD players for some reason.  And since that's the case, perhaps you can play it on your laptop while piping a video outfeed to your TV device, if you live in an NTSC format region like America.",1440028800,,1549,4.911877394636015
