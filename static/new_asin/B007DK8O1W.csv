8515050,4,B007DK8O1W,"Set in Victorian era London, an unhappily married man (Charles Laughton) falls in love with a young secretary (Ella Raines, HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO). When his bitter shrew of a wife (Rosalind Ivan, who ironically would play a similar role in Fritz Lang's SCARLET STREET the following year, refuses to give him a divorce and threatens to ruin him and the girl ..... he has no recourse but murder! Expertly directed by noir stylist Robert Siodmak (THE KILLERS), this is a wonderful thriller. The Victorian period setting allows Siodmak and cinematographer Paul Ivano (QUEEN KELLY) an opportunity to dispense an atmosphere rich in environment and tone. But it's Laughton's adroit performance, one of his very best, that's the film's backbone. Laughton's Philip Marshall is a decent man, not a murderer so one's empathy is entirely with him. The two murder victims in the film are vile, destructive persons whose death benefits those around them. The detective (Stanley Ridges) who pursues Laughton is only doing his job yet he comes across to a modern viewer as unappealing as LES MISERABLES's Javert dogged pursuit of Jean Valjean. The film is not without humor, the funeral scene has some wit to it. A jewel of a suspense film. The nicely applied score is by Frank Skinner (WRITTEN ON THE WIND). With Henry Daniell, Dean Harens and Molly Lamont.

The Llamentol DVD from Spain is a nice clean transfer in its appropriate 1.33 aspect ratio. The audio is in both English or Spanish with optional Spanish subtitles.",1331856000,,1511,4.972332015810276
