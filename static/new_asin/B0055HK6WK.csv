8458289,5,B0055HK6WK,"This series was broadcast on TV (and is still being broadcast in reruns) under the title of 'Mutant Planet'. For some reason it has been retitled 'Planet Evolution' for this DVD release, all the more strange because 'Mutant Planet Season 2' is available on DVD under that title. I reviewed this series under the 'Mutant Planet' title, so here's my review reprinted.

I have been disappointed in the lack of science in some of the programs on the Science Channel, so it's pleasant to record that this is the real deal.

The series focuses on bio-geography- where plants and animals live and how they came to be there. This is a fundamental plank in the theory of evolution and indeed is one of the factors Darwin observed which was most influential in developing his theory of evolution by natural selection. The series looks at some of the more unusual environments in the world and the fascinating plant and animal life and explains how and why life evolved the way it did in those regions.

Although the various subjects of research vary from well-known to barely believable, there is no non-scientific attempt to explain what is shown as the result of supernatural or extraterrestrial forces at work. Instead the programs skilfully lay out the path from millions of years ago to the present day. The picture is far from complete- the New Zealand show refers to it as a jigsaw puzzle and I would amplify that to a jigsaw puzzle with trillions of pieces in thousands of different rooms. Each piece found helps with the picture, but it will take a very long time to gather all the available pieces and put them together. Even then, some of the pieces have been lost forever and we have to reconstruct the picture by looking at what we have that relates to the lost bits and might tell us what was in them.

That we have learned so much in the short time that we have been studying this subject (it's 155 years since 'On The Origin Of Species' was published, a pinprick in geological time) is due to the amazing work of scientists in the field. Although there is little coverage of people in the series, those that are shown, be they geneticists, biologists, geologists, all contribute succinct and clear descriptions of what they are researching.

The predator/prey relationship is not shied away from, but the amount of graphic footage of killing is not large. I am personally happy about that and it does make the series one that can be shown to a younger audience.

The photography is beautiful, the locations are incredible, the narration is appropriately low-key and the information conveyed is absolutely fascinating. This is real science, of an importance to the future of human, animal and plant life that cannot be overstated, and yet so well-presented that it is absorbing even to the lay person.

This DVD release contains a couple of extra features, a program by Jeff Corwin and a documentary called 'Understanding Evolution'. Although the documentary was filmed this century, in 2001, it's interesting to see that it is already significantly out of date, such is the pace at which research is proceeding.

The value of this program, in both educational and entertainment terms, is immense. A wonderful experience.",1484438400,,3226,4.8209764918625675

8458292,5,B0055HK6WK,"This is a great series.  I had been looking for it under the name of the show that aired on television (Mutant Planet), but discovered it by accident under a different name for some reason.  This DVD has some additional shows as a bonus. Beautiful photography. Very informative.",1418428800,,278,4.770833333333333

8458294,4,B0055HK6WK,I purchased this for biology classes. The video quality is great. The content is awesome. But the sound goes loud to soft and back again. The students will just have to listen closely.,1376956800,2,184,4.606060606060606
8458295,5,B0055HK6WK,"This was a great investment for my classroom.  There are 8 episodes and they are all very interesting.  I bought it for the Galapagos episode but all of the others have been just as interesting. There is one about birds of New Zealand, the red kangaroos in Australia, anteaters in Brazil, chimpanzees and fish in Malawi, and they all show the animals now and how their traits are advantages to their environments.",1364860800,,413,4.722222222222222
8458296,5,B0055HK6WK,"I have been waiting for the ""mutant planet"" series to come out on dvd for almost a year now. Since the first time I saw ""Mutant Planet: Madagasca"" on the science channel (which is part of the discovery channel)I was hooked, everytime they played madagascar or one of the others:New Zealand, Austalia, Brazils Cerrado, Africas Rift Valley Lakes, Japan I couldn't wait and never wanted it to end. My 10 yr old daughters love it too! The naato goes through and explains the evolution of the animals and how they got to the continent in the 1t place then it explains the changes to there dna and how those changes became advantages and then thrived!!! My kids love how it explains how the lemurs started out as one species and now thee are over a hundrted diffrent species of lemurs I LOVE THIS SERIES, and so do my kids. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do.",1319414400,6,853,4.405063291139241
8458297,5,B0055HK6WK,"Nature endures far more than we realize and this series is spectacular!!  When I was watching this ""Mutant Planet"" series, I was also watching ""Great Migrations"".  Both of these are equally outstanding with different focuses.  I highly recommend watching these series one after another.  What Blue Planet started is finished in these newer expeditions.  Another series to check out is ""Nature's Amazing Events"".  Every time I tune in to my cable stations, these series hook me and pay off every time!!",1318809600,3,501,5.1234567901234565
