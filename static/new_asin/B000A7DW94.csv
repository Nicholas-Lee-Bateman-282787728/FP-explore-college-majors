8075557,5,B000A7DW94,I just love Charles Dickens stories especially the relatively recent versions BBC has produced. Rich quality and great productions! Wonderful!,1364256000,,142,6.15
8075558,4,B000A7DW94,"This DVD set features adaptations of three of Dickens' most popular books: David Copperfield, Oliver Twist, and Great Expectations.  They were shown a few years ago on PBS' Masterpiece Theatre.  Some of the fine actors include Daniel Radcliffe, Sam Smith, Ioan Gruffold, and Charlotte Rampling. They are (for the most part) faithful recreations of the original stories.

A possible good alternative to this item would be the Charles Dickens Collections 1 and 2, which contain more programs, but they are on the double-sided DVD's. Those sets are now greatly reduced in price and contain at least one of the dramas in this set (David Copperfield with Daniel Radcliffe). If you already purchased this set and want more adaptations, the dramas in the larger two sets are available separately.  However, this set has excellent quality DVD's with great sound and picture, which may be an advantage since some reviewers of the larger collections found the technology of the programs to be somewhat lacking in quality.

You will have to buy A Christmas Carol separately, but there are many movie versions of it available.  The dramas in this set are from  Dickens' three most appealing books besides the story of Scrooge.",1195516800,6,1214,5.0703517587939695
8075559,3,B000A7DW94,The TV scripts are not as well written as some movie versions of the past. This version of Great Expectations (for example) is too dark for my taste.,1167782400,,149,4.357142857142857
