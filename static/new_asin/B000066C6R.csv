1712595,5,B000066C6R,"It's volume 10, and we have a whole new opening and ending! And everyone's gone up a year in class!
First up, from the ""Dub Files"", is the capture of the Snow card, which blankets the town in a meter thick plus sheet of the white stuff! (This is good for the opening in which we learn that between the end of the last disc and the opening of this one five more cards, Arrow, Bubbles, Through, Wave, and Libra, were captured and taken by Sakura...but we never get to find out how! Cheat, Cheat, Cheat! Gyp, Gyp, Gyp! I wanna know what Libra does!!)
Next, an undubbed ep., in which Tomoyo-Chan is preparing for a big singing contest where she'll sing a song she wants to sing for Sakura anyway...only the Voice card likes her voice so much, she takes it! Can Sakura and Li get it back and seal the card before it's too late?!
Third up for this outing, another undubbed episode. Sakura and her class go to a strawberry field to pick some of the strawberries and make delicous sweets from them. But the shed set up for the cooking lesson gets sealed up, with Li, Sakura, Meilin, and Tomoyo trapped inside, by the Lock card! And only Ms. Mitsuki knows the right key to let them out!
Last up for perusal, another ep. that did make the dub, the battle of the Cloud card. Except...Sakura's got a high fever! How can she seal the card if she can't even focus her eyes! (Her temperature is taken in the Celsius scale at 38.4, which translates to 101.12 on the Fahrenheit scale! Go to bed, Sakura! For god sakes, go to bed!)
Well, this is it, sports fans! Only six more episodes and six more cards until the true Keroberos...and...Yue...

1712596,5,B000066C6R,"This latest installment of the Clow Card capturing saga starts to take on a new element as Sakura's dreams become clearer and Kero begins to worry about the near future for her. This Cover features Sakura in her yellow opening dress on a pretty mint green background. It alsos comes with a limited edition postcard.
The episodes are as follows:
*Sakura starts off the new school year with a birthday. Yukito gets her a present that gets lost in the freak blizzard that hits Tomoeda. Will she ever find the gift under the blanket of snow and manage to capture the Snow Card?
*Tomoyo has a big singing contest coming up! Unfortunately, the Voice Card decides to take her voice away. Tomoyo is left unable to speak with a hysterical Sakura desperate to hunt the card down. Will Sakura and Shaoran be able to capture the card in time?
*The class goes on a fun strawberry hunt. Sakura and others end up trapped with nowhere to go all thanks to the Lock card. How will they make it out?
*Sakura falls under the weather, as does the city of Tomoeda. Thick heavy clouds plague the town and Sakura doesn't have the strength to lift her wand. Can Li and Meilin handle the problem? Will Sakura get better? Did Touya just see his mom again?
This season has great episodes, and we will probably see a creditless opening as we did on volume 1. Until September. RELEASE!",1021766400,,1355,4.512195121951219

36# Sakura and the Snowy new school term

Sakura got a gift from Yukito which makes her very happy, however when the snow card comes she looses it but at the end she gets it back.

37# Sakura and Tomoyo's Lost Voice

MY MOST FAVORITE EPISODE!!!! Out of all 70 this one touched my heart!!! Tomoyo is entering the school chior, but a problem hit Her voice is gone! Kero tells Sakura taht the VOICE card stole it. Sakura goes to visit Tomoyo and she tells Tomoyo that she'll find a way to get Tomoyo's voice back. Sakura uses the song card and she gets Tomoyo's voice back. I was sitting there watching and I was truly crying! It was so upsetting yet it was so happy at the end.

38# Sakura's Fun Starwberry picking journey.

Sakura, Tomoyo and the rest of the classmates are going Strawberry picking, however Sakura, Tomoy, Meilin and Shaoran get locked in a buidling. It's the LOCK card. Sakura must use the Clow key to get out.

39# Sakura's Dizzy Fever day

Sakura wakes up feeling horrible with a fever, however the Cloud card is on the loose. If she doesn't seal it away the sity will be put in clouds!

  There all VERY good. The Tomoyo\Voice one is the best though. It's SOOO Touching!!!! Buy it! It's worth your money!!!!",1154995200,,1261,4.415584415584416
7962281,5,B000066C6R,"As usually Sakura gets her cards but there are some new things at the beginning of season two.  First, her brother is shown to care more about her and to be aware that something is different about her.  Second, Sharaon and Melin are starting to help Sakura not just compete with her.  Finally Yukito is showing some more than big-brother's-friend interest.  Remember this is another culture so if you find love interests between age group inappropriate, don't get this series.  Its also just interest -- nothing physical happens at all.",1077321600,3,536,4.911111111111111
7962282,5,B000066C6R,"Yet another wonderful volume! I love the episodes in this one. I LOVE them! Along with the catchy new theme song, the animation is great and so is the subtitling!
  Sakura starts a new school year with a new teacher...hmmmm, wonder who...then Tomoyo loses her voice right before her competion! Time to go strawberry pickin' with...hey! How'd Yukito get here?! Then Sakura's sick! But what about the Clow Card...
  I am seriously adicted to this series. I have been collecting these for a while and I'm delighted to relize each new episode is better than the last one. You can just sence the tension rising between Shaoran and Sakura...A great show exploding with cuteness! (Of course, I like cuteness but not everyone does...) Simply wonderful!",1030147200,2,744,4.928
7962283,5,B000066C6R,"This is probably the best they have released so far in the CCS series, it is so cute, cute, CUTE! My eyes were glazed over and I was practically drooling over the cuteness!! I've been collecting CCS and Marmalade Boy on and off, and if before I favored Marmalade Boy, now I favor Cardcaptor Sakura! It is so worth it to buy this DVD, the opening credits and ending theme songs are adorable! By goodness this even surpasses ""Totoro"" in the cute story-line meter!
If you have kids, buy it. If you don't buy it. Even if your like me, and in high school, by golly buy it! It's awesome clean structured art is even better than old shoujo favorites ""Sailor Moon"" and ""Revolutionary Girl Utena"" (at least in my opinion) and after seeing and having a few other subs of CCS I definetely suggest you'd buy it over the dubbed, which like they say, doesn't do any justice whatsoever to the anime... anyway now I must go, I've lost all intelligence to it's cuteness and need to read something so I don't suffocate from ""Cute"" noises and smiles...",1029715200,3,1033,4.470899470899471
