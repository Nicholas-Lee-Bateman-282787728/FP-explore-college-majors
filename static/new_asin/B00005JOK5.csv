C'mon Amazon!",1392854400,,348,4.104477611940299
7941806,5,B00005JOK5,This was my favorite show as a teen and I've been waiting for it to be available on DVD since DVD's of TV shows started being released. This show had both drama and humor and was one of the best on TV from '79 through '86. So many mediocre shows from the 70s and 80s have been released on DVD. I'm very frustrated that this is still not on DVD when so many lesser shows are. I had a huge crush on Gregory Harrison who played Gonzo and I would love to own ALL 7 seasons!,1374537600,2,469,3.8958333333333335

7941809,5,B00005JOK5,"I started watching ""Trapper John, MD"" on a cable channel after hearing about it from my parents. I'm 19, and my parents always liked older shows (since they were around when they came out) so I grew up with shows such as ""M*A*S*H"", ""The Honeymooners"", ""The Monkees"", Lucy, ""All in the Family"", etc. I found that they are much better than what is on today as I grew up.

Being a huge ""M*A*S*H"" fan I had high hopes that it would be good. And, of course ""Trapper"" did not disappoint. I watched it with my dad every night of famnet (Cox cable) at 7 and 8 pm.  When I was looking forward to it and started making it routine in my house, the channel took it off the air replacing it with some westerns that I had no interest in. I was upset because this is a decent show and the ground breaker of all medical shows that we know and love today like ""ER"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"". I still keep an eye and hope that it will return to tv one day.

I have seen advertisements for it on different websites that claim to have all the episodes in a box set and is in great condition, but I don't trust them enough to be sure it's true or just a scam. I do not want to find out.
Please Amazon find this show on DVD!!!!!",1330560000,10,1201,4.059071729957806

7941811,5,B00005JOK5,I watched the reruns on Cable for a few months until they took them off.  I'd like to purchase the entire Series on DVD.  I've seen some offers on line but don't know if they are for real and good quality... Please put them in a DVD box set.  Thanks.,1288483200,20,250,3.96
