There seems to be a lot of scruples among pirates in the story line and it sorry of takes me out of the story. I expect pirates to be a ruthless cutthroat murderous bunch and these ones are a bit too concerned with rules and regulations for my taste.  But I suppose then you would not have as much of a story.

6683164,5,B00NWKWA58,"Season one was good but season two was the absolute most perfect television EVER! Every single episode was a jaw-dropper - and my questions about all the characters (why they did the seemingly crazy stuff they did in season one) were answered. I can't wait for season three and am currently experiencing the most God-awful withdrawal.  It's unfortunate that Starz keeps such a tight reign on this show. It's killing viewership and recognition. So few know it exists. Because of it, legions of people who refuse to pay for premium cable or dvd's have only Amazon live-streaming to turn to (not enough, sorry) to see what a small but devoted following are so amped about. And they can only get season one. By the time season two's available the fuss will have died down - and that's sad. Worse, it's frustrating that Starz doesn't air Black Sails reruns during the show's off-season, after new Outlander episodes. If they did they could pick up SCORES of new and devoted viewers, since (thanks to the books) Outlander has such a huge following. What a misstep. I can't recommend this show enough and will order both season one and season two when season two (which is available on dvd in the U.K. from AmazonUK right now... What's THAT about?!) finally becomes available on dvd. There are a ton of people I want to loan the dvd's to. It's unfortunate that we, the fans, bear most of the responsibility for getting the word out about this awesome show. And I wonder if Starz does anything to bring the show to the attention of EMMY voters.... probably not.

Speaking of season two... Does anyone know the release date for this dvd set? I want it now. :)",1430006400,12,1650,4.647260273972603
6683165,5,B00NWKWA58,"The first series was a scorcher and the second is just as good - if not even better. Picking up where the second left off with no -one getting the Spanish gold and Captain Flint out of favour. John Silver is still making himself indispensible by teaching Machiavelli a thing or two in duplicity.

We also have the well realised Anne Bonny revealing she has a taste for lady flesh too (as was the case in real life). The story also does a simply excellent reveal to explain why Flint is there in the first place and I must say I was a bit taken aback - but in a really good way. The action is thumping too with realistic canon and musketry and the language is spot on. The ale flows like the blood too in a few places and Charles Vane mumbles his way into yet more high jinks.

This is just a sumptuous presentation and it has that brilliant knack of being absolutely addictive. I wish Amazon had put the whole series out at once and I could have taken a couple of days off work to really enjoy it.

As ever there are brilliant performances throughout but I still think that Toby Schmitz as the rakish Rackham is a pure scene stealer as is the beautiful Jessica Parker Kennedy as Max. This is just great fun entertainment with violence, sex, bawdiness (love that word) and naked lust and greed through out - all wrapped with a flapping Jolly Roger - can't get much better than that.",1429401600,35,1381,4.303846153846154
6683166,5,B00NWKWA58,"HOW TO UNDERSTAND THIS DARKER, GRITTIER PIRATE TALE, OR ASSESS IF ITS NOT FOR YOU

***WARNING TO THOSE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE SERIES*** This show has cinematic level production values, but also a great deal of adult content. This is the rum addled, opium hazed, violent and sexualized depiction one might expect of a more realistic (though still fantasy) pirate drama. It is understandable that it just won't fit everyones tastes. Please accept this attempt to explain the show so others can decide for themselves. There is a connection to the novel ""Treasure Island"" that is confusing people, but this IS NOT a children's tale. This program is also not all action for those hoping for sea battles in every episode. Those hoping for all action will find a substantial amount of focus on political struggle, drama, relationships and sub-plots.  This is precisely the strength for those who seek it, and a weakness for those who don't wish to spend the time.

INTRO: It is truly amazing that for such a dark topic as pirating, there has hardly been a show that avoids the normal clich&eacute;s and depicts a gritty life more like it would have been. We have always had these semi-sanitized versions meant for adventure telling and children's stories. Until now. This intricate tale borrows characters and places from Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island to form its structure and mythology, while starting 20 years earlier to set up the tale. Woven together with that is a few real characters based loosely on their actual history. From the opening credits featuring undulating strains of hurdy-gurdy music, camera panning over the intricate bone carved art piece shaped somewhat like the back of a sailing vessel - It is clear this is going to be a quality show with intricate plots and very dark undertones.

SEASON 2 (no spoilers): The first season laid a meticulous foundation of conflicts, personalities and mysteries.  Many characters now must atone and mitigate the fallout of dark deeds committed previously.  Season 2 picks up where it left off as Captain Flynt and John Silver seek ways out of the predicament that befell them and their crew.  All that groundwork laid in season one can flourish as we are given huge chunks of backstory illustrating how Flynt (once known as LT James McGraw) left the British Navy and ultimately became a pirate.  His close relationship with Lord Thomas Hamilton and his wife Miranda is given life.  This past, working with the brilliant Thomas Hamilton, will affect Captain Flynts actions as he finds himself in a position to fulfill Hamiltons work and realize a dream they once thought dead.  Meanwhile, a ruthless new pirate captain named Ned Low (a historical figure) arrives in Nassau and threatens the natural order.  He becomes a direct threat to Eleanor Guthrie.  Pretty much everyones allegiances will be put to the test.  Almost every faction has come into possession of a powerful weapon or bargaining chip.  The question is, who is willing to sacrifice the most and still maintain power.  Who will sacrifice everything for a dream.

OUTSTANDING CHARACTER & STORY DEVELOPMENT: The character development and complex storylines are part of what really enrich this story. Toby Stephens leads the cast as Captain Flint and displays the capability and charisma needed to inspire the support of a crew. He also projects the vulnerability of someone who knows that support can evaporate at any time. Eleanor Guthrie (Hannah New) is the foul mouthed but oddly cultivated woman who acts as fence (sells the stolen goods to more reputable markets on behalf of the pirates). Behind it all, she is the one that makes it all work and is one of the real powers. Clara Paget plays Anne Bonny (who was a real pirate), a kick butt female pirate with a somewhat assassin quality about her that's fascinating. The political winds that must be channeled to control each ship, or the island power structure itself, are legion. The complex interrelationships of characters are constantly shifting.  This is what really makes the story substantial and full of sub plots. In the end, they create an amazing cast of humanized and deeply fleshed characters that are also some of the nastiest people to have ever sailed... ""Under the Black"".

FINAL THOUGHTS: Like some other sensationalized shows on STARZ, this is not a family show. It is not literal history as it is a historical fantasy after all. However, the historical elements they bring in, the monumental detail on ships and sets, character development and plot structure all add great flesh to a skeleton of real pirate history and literary reference. The emphasis on the oddly democratic counter-culture of pirate life, which contrasts the practice of conscription (forced servitude on sailing ships), is a key to understanding the psychology of pirates of that day. They were partly rebelling against this sea culture and ill treatment in real navies (plus the outlawing of privateers that served during wartime). If you are not offended by its darker side, and you appreciate complex story and character development at a literary level, you may discover something special in this show.",1429401600,159,5176,5.012820512820513
6683167,5,B00NWKWA58,"I'll admit, the first season of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Sails/dp/B00E1LSX44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Sails</a>&nbsp;wasn't *must watch* television for me. It was entertaining enough, with a twisty plot and high production values, but I wasn't exactly salivating with anticipation each week. That all changed with season two - perhaps it's because the writers had finished setting up their characters, perhaps because they were ready to dive into the meat of their story, but this second season of ""Black Sails"" blows its first out of the water.

A mish-mash of historical figures (Charles Vane, Anne Bonny, Jack Rackham), characters from Robert Louis Stevenson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Treasure-Island/dp/0486275590/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Treasure Island</a>&nbsp;(Captain Flint, John Silver, Billy Bones) and completely original characters (Eleanor Guthrie) comprise the cast of ""Black Sails"", which is simultaneously a prequel to ""Treasure Island"", a bio-pic of the aforementioned historical figures, and a realistic depiction of the life and hardships of piracy.

They operate out of the island of Nassau, a place governed by the young Eleanor Guthrie (Hannah New) who provides information on the routes of merchant ships and acts as a fencing service for the stolen loot the pirate captains bring back to her. This mini-empire brings her power and wealth she could have never experienced as a properly-raised Englishwoman, and so it is imperative to her that she maintains her business at all costs.

In this endeavour she is joined by Captain Flint (Toby Stephens), a mysterious pirate captain who seems just as hell-bent on Nassau's future as Eleanor, for reasons that are just as personal, and who has concocted a plan that will ensure its survival against the looming British navy. This season delves further into Flint's backstory through a series of flashbacks that explore his past as a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy and his relationship with Thomas Hamilton and his wife Miranda, two idealists that back a controversial proposal to pardon the Nassau pirates and establish the island as an independent colony.

Whereas season one painted Flint as a megalomaniac who was hell-bent on his goals without any substantial motivation, this season reveals just why he fights so single-mindedly for Nassau, and what's at stake should his vision not come to pass.

But there are more than a few obstacles standing in the way of Flint and Eleanor's goals, and it's not simply the British fleet. Flint's greatest obstacle is his own crew, who lack the ability to consider the future beyond their next prize ship and who are more than capable of mutiny if they think they're being manipulated by their captain (which most of the time, they are). In his endeavour to bend the crew to his will, Flint finds unexpected help from John Silver (Luke Arnold), the self-serving opportunist who can see the long-term value of Flint's agenda, but who also embodies the pirate mentality of ""look out for yourself and take what you want.""

It's this tension between the need for unity and strength, and the inherent selfishness of piratical life that provides most of the show's plot. One of Flint's greatest enemies is Charles Vane (Zach McGowan), a man who cares for little beyond his own power (and his obsession with Eleanor) and regards Flint's background with deep suspicion - at least at first. Working parallel to Vane and Flint is Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny (Toby Schmitz and Clara Paget), the show's dark horses, who have their own schemes that might well jeopardise everything that Flint is fighting for.

The trick is that you can't help but root for Rackham and Bonny at the very same time you sympathise with what Flint is trying to achieve, and enjoy the ""spanner in the works"" quality of Vane and the masterful manipulative skills of John Silver. These days&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Thrones/dp/B00N59BJTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Thrones</a>&nbsp;is the show to namedrop whenever you want to highlight a story's capacity for intrigue, backstabbing, secret agendas, and two-faced double-dealing - but it neatly provides the perfect comparison for the twisty plots and merry-go-round of alliances and betrayals that make up ""Black Sails"".

Perhaps one of the show's strengths is that it doesn't try to whitewash the reality of piratical life. Unlike the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pirates-of-the-Caribbean/dp/B00005JM5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>&nbsp;franchise, in which ""good"" pirates are mostly interested in their own freedom, ""Black Sails"" portrays a subculture that is brutal, violent, crass and (most of the time) its own worst enemy. Most of the supporting cast is too short-sighted, greedy or uneducated to realize just what Flint and Eleanor are trying to achieve, and it can be an agonizing experience to see just how self-sabotaging the pirates are at times - or for that matter, just what lengths Flint and Eleanor are willing to go to ""for the greater good"". The show isn't interested in excusing or justifying their actions, just portraying them in a realistic manner (it's also comparable to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vikings/dp/B00CDTSFF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vikings</a>&nbsp;in that sense).

A part of this involves exploring some of the practicalities of piracy - for example, when a ship prepares to set sail to collect a treasure hoard, there is some consideration given to how much the gold will weigh, whether the ship can support the load, and where they're going to safely store it after retrieval. It all adds to the realism of the piece, and even gives you some food for thought regarding this particular way of life.

It's also a show that isn't afraid to make changes to the status quo. Characters grow and develop and change their minds over important issues, and everyone is in a very different place at the end of this season than they were at the beginning. This is exemplified no better than in Max (Jessica Parker Kennedy) who started the show as a prostitute and pawn, but who gets the final shot of this season in which her triumphant smile fills the screen - it's as clear an example as any of the way fortunes are continually changing for these characters.

Plenty of sword fights and sea battles, dark backstories and secret agendas, unexpected alliances and betrayals from surprising quarters - the show breathes new life into the pirate genre, and will hopefully maintain these high standards for its forthcoming third season.",1429142400,54,6791,5.589893100097182

6683182,2,B00NWKWA58,"I've tried to like this show - i really have. I typically enjoy historical drama/fiction (Sharpe, Vikings, Downton, Last Kingdom, etc.). And hey - pirates are cool right? So based on reviews i've read here on Amazon, as well as some favorable mentions by a YouTuber i respect, I actually subscribed to Starz through Amazon - just so that i could watch this show.

Well my wife and i have made it through a season and a half, and i'm ready to bail on it. The thing is, i just never feel psyched to watch it. But i kind of force myself to watch - in the hopes that it will become more engaging. But then it doesn't become more engaging - and the cycle repeats.

For me there are several problems with the show.

- First: I'm just not rooting for any of the characters. There's literally nobody i care about. Some are potentially interesting - but don't get enough screen time. Some characters are just straight up annoying - though they aren't intended to be. Overall - there's just too many characters - and none really shine.

- Second: This is a show that very clearly projects current-day societal values onto a historical time and place. A time and place that would have been very inconsistent with the norms of today. Some might say this show has a 'progressive' agenda.' I don't necessarily have a problem with that in itself. But in a historical drama - it feels inappropriate and it constantly destroys the suspension of disbelief - taking me out of the story.

- Third: I was really hoping there would be more cool pirate action. But realistic - not like Pirates of the Caribbean. The very first episode of Season 1 was quite promising. But then the story(ies) quickly became centered around personal power struggles - mostly in the port city of Nassau - where a huge portion of the of each episode actually takes place. That might not be terrible if i gave half a darn about any of the people involved. Every time, we return to Nassau for a scene, my heart sinks, and i feel like i'm just biding my time. And for me, most of the most-annoying characters are based in Nassau.

On the plus side, the production values are awesome. The show looks great and visually recreates the world it's portraying with expertise.

And it's got a cool theme song and opening credit sequence.

But i think i've sailed my last with 'Black Sails'.",1499472000,,2337,4.508274231678487

6683191,5,B00NWKWA58,"The fact that I am finally motivated enough to write a review for a program here on Amazon should be enough to let you know that this show is incredible.  I wanted to just write an immature, unhelpful, quick review that basically said ""This show rocks!"" because I want to hurry and return to the show.  But I feel that would not do justice to this program so I'll try to give a few substantive examples:
The characters are so in-depth and expertly crafted that I am constantly changing who my favorite character is and my opinion about who I would be happy seeing dead or achieving their goals.  One episode I could hate a character and hope they die and by the next episode I am cheering for them and hate anyone who gets in their way.
The women are incredibly sexy and the sex scenes actually add to the intrigue, suspense, and plot of the series.  They are actually more than just gratuitous nudity in many cases and well done.
The violence is realistic and makes you feel as if you are actually there.  It doesn't feel as if there is just overwhelming violence that gets boring and pointless.  The fighting scenes feel epic and important / relevant to the plot.  They build the characters and make the series feel more realistic.
The music and cinematography are professionally done.  At this point in the series, two opposing groups are on the verge of war and I don't know which group I want to win or lose.  It's very exciting and time well spent.",1494115200,,1454,4.456603773584906

The world building is great and each character is motivated well. The only thing I don't like is the ""twist"" in this season which I felt fell flat. I generally don't like twists in stories for that reason. I can usually see most coming a million miles a way and if I don't see them coming they tend to fail with me. however, besides that one issue, this has been my favorite cable show for the last two years.

Season 1 was pretty good, but it's Season 2 where Black Sails REALLY takes off..particularly with Captain Flint's backstory and how and why he became a pirate. Billy Bones,  Calico Jack Rackham, Anne Bonney, Charles Vane. and ESPECIALLY Captain Flint all really grew on me.

I already put in my order for Season 3. Can't wait for it to arrive already. As I've watched Ray Stevenson in ""Rome"" I can't wait for his performance as Blackbeard in Season 3.

Very binge watching worthy.  The opening title sequence alone is priceless...I always want to watch the title sequence in every episode..it really sets the mood and ambiance of ""Black Sails"" perfectly.",1478736000,,794,4.759124087591241

Season two is just as well written as season one with the stakes seemingly getting higher higher with various factions pitted against each other.

We begin to learn more about Flint's past and how it has turned him into that man that we see now. As I'm sure others have noted - don't expect historical accuracy though. By introducing the literary figures alongside the historical ones, the writers have given themselves license to write their own story - and they have done a superb job of that!",1471478400,,445,4.439024390243903

We are truly living in a golden age of television. Maybe it's because it's based on history, but this is the series we actually own and watch again and again for the glorious cinematography and production values, the acting talent, the intricate storytelling and strategy, the articulate and beautifully written dialogue, the ships and amazing battles, all the lush sets and costumes. For every viewing we even watch the entire opening credits for the gorgeous imagery and music by Bear McReary.

6683411,1,B00NWKWA58,"Lots of potential, but disappointing.
Good storytelling requires imagination and knowledge and this show fails.
The actors are boring or laughable, but for a minority.
Several ""Modern Millies"" which is laughable and ridiculous.
Today's Liberal Zombies are desperate to proselytize their faith! Much pushier than most evangelists.
Guaranteed insert of homosexuality to keep the Democrat Commissars satisfied and the sadsacks themselves from calling their lawyers for being ""left out"" or badmouthed.
Too many women running things for the same reason as listed above.
As history, ""true"" history is ignored and fantastic behaviors take place. Their ARE some watchable and believable docs on piracy available online. ANY of these are better than Black Sails.
Of course, the use of language to reflect changes over time is nigh impossible for any show based in the past but there should be some attempt made. This show has made some attempt, at least.
""Modern"" and conventional children and the younger folks that make up the target demographic have had their brains and souls vacated by their public school teachers and standard media so that the Democrat Social Engineering project can take over without any argument.
One thing that the demonic dictators, Hussein Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Harry Reid, Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, etc. rely on is media compliance and aggressive programming of the masses.
Remember the old line ""religion is the opiate of the masses""? There has never been a more fit application of this than to the modern Democrat and their religion of self-indulgence. Totally sold on feeling good at the expense of those who would rather do good.",1470182400,,1673,5.246268656716418

You can't even pay for the season anymore to stream it... so I'm very upset over that since I have cut the cord for the last 10 years and refuse to pay for cable / satellite tv services and never will.

6683462,5,B00NWKWA58,"GAME OF THRONES is a terrific series, but it is not the only ambitious, big-budget series that transports the viewer to another world.  BLACK SAILS also takes us to a place we're not familiar with.  In this case, it takes us back in time to the early 1700s in the Caribbean.  It is a raw, savage place where pirates call the shots & take whatever they please.  Civilization seems a world apart.  Of course, even civilization is not bereft of the darker parts of human nature.

The show mixes historical pirates with fictional characters.  In doing so, it does a superb job of laying out the character traits of these people who  lived 300yrs ago.  The casting is impeccable, but the one performance which stands-out is that of Zach McGowan as Captain Vane ~ a historical pirate.  McGowan has an impressive, commanding screen presence and is very believable as a ruthless pirate.  In short, he is one scary dude.  Want to see what happens when bullies challenge other bullies?  Watch this series!!

A difference between this season &  Season 1 is that the present season gives us the backstory of Captain Flint, who is the main character (a fictional pirate).  Like many pirates, he was a former officer in the British Navy.  While some may find this to be far-fetched, this is actually historically consistent.  A lot of pirates WERE former British officers who found themselves out-of-work after the war of Spanish succession.

There is no mystery as to who the audience of this series is.  If you have an interest in the history of piracy, then this series is for you.  If you even have a passing interest in the history of the New World, then this series is for you.  If you want to see Hannah New, then this series is for you.  If you want to see Hannah New strip down, then this series is for you.  If you want to see HUGE special effects & sea battles, then this series is for you.  Well, by now you get the idea!!",1468281600,,1920,4.511627906976744

6683500,5,B00NWKWA58,One of my favorite shows. Mixes the fictional charactars Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island with actual historic pirates of the era. Not for young childeren though. Very intelligent adult drama. If sex and violence offend you watch the Pirates of the Caribbean intead for your pirate fix. This show is gritty and fun for those of us that like that kind of thing. Just finished season three and went back to watch seasons one and two over again. Great show!!!,1465948800,,464,4.8125

6683503,5,B00NWKWA58,"It took me a long time in the first season to realize that this is the prequel to Treasure Island.  A tip off would have been greatly appreciated.  The names Captain Flint and (Long) John Silver finally soaked into my slow brain and a light went off.

Oh, and does all of that explicit skin in the sex scenes really add to the production quality and appreciation of the story?  I can go to the Internet to watch skin.  I am looking for a series with a (1) good story and sub plots (2) good actors (3) a few good unanticipated twists in the story.",1465776000,,546,4.161904761904762

Hmm, only reason you would be reading this review is that you watched the first season and either liked it or at least found it interesting enough that you are looking at viewing the second season.  In that case I would recommend you go right on ahead and do so.  It's more of the same with the addition of Blackbeard - who actually does a great job and is very interesting to watch.  The plot moves on forward with new twists that, lets face it while not at all historically anything and sometimes rather over the top and unlikely, are fun enough and did keep pulling me back for more.  This remains a beautifully shot show, with good characters, great music and just that pirate feel and ambience.

Sure the whole Homo-erotic thing has been going on since the beginning of time, you can allude to it, or have it as a means in which to develop a character. Hell the Greeks thought men where for fun and chicks where for babies... But when the writers start putting in scene after scene..yes Hollywood writers we ALL know that 90% of you are gay, yes I am so thrilled that you feel empowered, but to be honest your still vastly out numbered and always will be. We just aint that into you. ANY WAY Action is great, story line is not predictable and moves around and weaves an intricate web of characters that I both like and hate. Historical accuracy wise..its a joke at best. But who cares, it's fun.  I will not watch any more after this. it reminds me of contemporary Americans playing pirate in a 1700's time warp.",1461888000,,862,4.354037267080745

6683655,5,B00NWKWA58,"Oh, my! Things really heated up in Season 2. I fell in love with this show in season 1, but things really escalate in season 2. Elizabeth Guthrie goes from being on top of this mountain of men, to being scared and harassed by a new evil. Despite my first season character allegiances, I found myself shifting over to characters whom I hadn't liked at first. John Silver and Charles Vane were both characters who grew on me. Even Anne Bonny and Calico Jack became more dynamic as the season went on. I found myself liking Flint less and less, but my admiration for the writing, sets and actors grew by leaps and bounds this season.

6683670,5,B00NWKWA58,"I was anticipating this season in a big way and it did not disappoint at all. The main selling point is we get to see Captain Flint's British Navy back story, and I will not spoil it for anyone but, boy oh boy, it's a shocker in one HUGE way. Also, they actually kill off a semi-main character and we now see how John Silver loses that leg. As if you haven't already figured out (and it took me a while as i had read nothing about this going into watching Season 1) this whole story is a sort of sequel to Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island mixed with actual factual pirate history. Hence the characters' names correlate with the fictional and actual pirates of both worlds.

Anyway, the acting, storytelling, cinematography and sound (I still am amazed at the simple way they capture the sound of ropes straining in the wind as odd as that may sound to some of you)is beyond first-rate.

As far as the DVD extras go--superb. We get an episode-by-episode inside guide. We see how the ships' ""sets"" were built used in more detail than the Season 1 extra on this. The Nassau town life vs. open ocean pirate life is delved into. The High Seas fight scene choreographers steal the extras' show. Finally, there's a look at the historical influence on the series itself which makes you want to do a deep dive on the Internet and snag some books on the subject.

Cannot wait for Season 3 on DVD. Bring it on!",1458864000,,1407,4.424710424710424

I really hoped the second season would be better, but it is just as bad. It's hard to understand the story line because they continuously stop to have a graphic sex scene.

People suggested walking dead which got good reviews, but the whole zombie genre is over done and uninteresting if you ask me.  Insert black sails, I gotta say I wasn't expecting much but wow was I blown away. Now season 1 was good not great,  it was Def entertaining enough to keep me very interested but WOW season 2 blew me away.  You could tell they really increased the production value in season 2 and it paid off.  Lots of action, lots of twists, and great sub plots.  If you're not a fan after you watch all of season 2 then either you're dead or should turn the channel back to the Bachelorette",1456963200,2,730,4.141843971631205

6683737,5,B00NWKWA58,"Black Sails (seasons 1 and 2) Season 3 frorthcoming.
Since I was a wee lad, I have shared with many, a secret fantasy and fascination for a rogue life on the high seas.
Since the swashbuckling pictures of the 40s and 50s, Hollywood had not really given us a proper piracy film until the 2003 release of Curse of the Black Pearl with Johnny Depp. The quality of the cast and especially Depps brilliant rascal humor, temporarily satisfied most pirate fans, but frankly, serious authenticity was still lacking (skeletons coming to life?). The subsequent Pirates of the Caribbean sequels quickly degraded into Saturday-morning demographics stuff with slimy monsters and video-game special effectsall without the joy-stick. OK for kids I guess, but what about us?
The Starz series Black Sails has changed all that. It finally fulfills most, if not all of our cravings for more serious adult pirate fare.
Yes we have the base gratifications with gritty details and authenticity, exceptional photography, beautiful lush sets and locales, excellent sound effects and musical score, gorgeous ship battles, masterfully choreographed fights, shuddering scenes of bloody violence, and sexy, sweaty interludes. But we also have the higher brow elements with compelling characters, intriguing relationships, engaging storylines, and most importantly intelligent dialogue with stellar acting.
Especially for a TV series, Black Sails shines and effectively immerses you into its 18th century world. It is bad-ass pirate entertainment of the highest order and comes highly recommended.",1453766400,2,1568,5.5103734439834025

6683743,4,B00NWKWA58,Great season,1453593600,,12,5.5
6683744,5,B00NWKWA58,"Talk about edge of your seat drama. Black Sails season 2 is it! It's got a lot of characters who have multiple relationships and lots of history with each other, yet somehow none of it is confusing. Probably because it's the type of thing you lean in for and pay attention to every word, every nuance. Each episode ends on a cliff hanger, begging you to binge watch the whole thing.

WHAT IT'S ABOUT- The story is takes place during the Golden Age of Piracy in New Providence Island, Bahamas. It blends historical figures (Benjamin Hornigold, Jack Rackham, Anne Bonnie, etc) with some fictional ones (Captain Flint, John Silver) to create story lines that capture the spirit of pirate life. There is a LOT of murder, free love, paid love, thievery, back stabbing, and all the things you'd imagine pirates would be into. There is also a pirate's code, a desire for freedom and to be master and commander of your own life. It's complicated, yet surprisingly simple. It might sound like an action flick, and it is... however, there are a lot of human stories here as well that are so well done. It will grab you, if you can get past the language, nudity, sex, and bloodshed.

The acting is fine, fine, fine. Great cast. Great sets. It's an improvement over season one because it's more developed. You know who is who and what they care about, so the series just builds from there. It makes me want to throw off the bow line and make for the Caribbean. I look forward to season 3.",1453593600,,1476,4.52434456928839

You'll just have to rewind and watch again if you do either. If you do both while watching this saga you'll be watching it for, I don't know, maybe a long time and then half that? I can't wait till the 3rd Season. My only issue? Charles Vane is wearing shoulder pads. You can tell when he shows his back.

Not quite as many gruesome battle scenes however still very present in season 2. In my humble opinion this season was far more compelling than the first season. Still sex but not as much in you face as the last time. Still some homosexuality beware if that offends you. I have seen worse on another Starz tv series.  However, the pirates behavior is more realistic and certainly not Disney characters.  Season 2 left with an interesting twist. Season 3 should be awesome. Black Sails is a very adult pirate tale that is based on some real people. The show is getting better each season. Good production.

6683775,5,B00NWKWA58,"UPDATE: I finished watching Season 2 and it is by many degrees far better than Season 1. Season 2 is simply fantastic in every which way - the plots, the storylines, the depth of each of the characters. Season 2 also brings out the best acting in the characters. Superb show!! I have since watched Season 3 and liked it very much as well. I hope they make many more seasons. Season 2 is by far the best one so far.

I started watching the series after Season 2 was out. I finished Season 1 and am 3/4 through Season 2. Although Season 1 is slow, in Season 2 the show comes into itself in many ways. In Season 2 the plots get far more interesting and the characters get deeper and more complex. Although I don't care for the excessive nudity and wish they would cut it out, if you can ignore it and get past that, Season 2 is extremely enjoyable. The plots and the characters are becoming  more complex in Season 2 and the storylines are gripping. This show is turning out to be quite excellent and I hope it continues for many more seasons.

The sets are simply incredible and realistic as ever. Additionally, I find it refreshing to watch a more realistic and gritty depiction of pirates and pirate life after all the silly Disney romanticizing and watered down depictions of pirates. It is interesting to see the pirates' place and their reactions to the social and political issues of their day. Fascinating historical context in the background of the adventures and stories of people who may be fiction, but who just as likely could have been real. I enjoy historical fiction for this reason and Black Sails fits very well into the kinds of historical fiction that I enjoy. It is an all around great period piece, save for it's excessive nudity. This is not a family show, it is an adult show. And as an adult show, it is extremely interesting and entertaining.

In summary, with Season 2 Black Sails has grown into an excellent show and I hope it continues for a lot more seasons.",1450137600,,1985,4.460055096418733

It's interesting that almost all of the negative reviews reveal a political persuasion that is as usual intolerant. Many wanted more murder, mayhem, etc.  Most others objected to the sex and nudity of whatever persuasion. Unfortunately for the negative reviewers all the above is about real life and everything in the series happens in real life in one form or another and there really is no agenda other than that which is imagined; just showing people being people. Humans are a varied species as created by nature. Intolerance seems for the most part to be a learned behavior. It's also interesting that there never seems to be a review by LGBT posters or those with a progressive mindset about depraved Heterosexual behavior which is much more prevalent in movies.",1449878400,4,837,5.065217391304348

6683807,5,B00NWKWA58,"Move over Douglas Fairbanks, Errol Flynn, Tyrone Power and Johnny Depp, because Starz  BLACK SAILS is the best pirate movie (i.e. television series) ever made.

People familiar with the names of John Silver, Billy Bones and Captain Flint, know that BLACK SAILS is a prequel to Robert Louis Stevensons TREASURE ISLAND, set in 1715, decades before young Jim Hawkins entered the picture or was even born.  Yet, the gritty series also involves real pirates from history, like Anne Bonny and Charles Vane.

Toby Stephens plays Flint, the most feared pirate captain of his day, Tom Hopper is Billy Bones, a senior member of his unhappy crew, while Luke Arnold plays the crafty ships cook, John Silver, who has his own nefarious agenda.  By the end of the second season of BLACK SAILS, now available on Blu-ray and DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment, we even learn how Silver got his peg leg.

Much of the saga takes place on New Providence Island, a former British colony that is now lawless territory, controlled by several of the most ruthless pirates in history.  Eleanor Guthrie (Hannah New), daughter of the local smuggling kingpin, actually runs the lucrative fencing operation on her fathers behalf.

BLACK SAILS, The Complete Second Season, is filled with plenty of clandestine agreements, switched alliances and double crosses, as Flint and competing captains not only try to secure the cargo of a wrecked Spanish treasure ship containing a five million dollar bounty, but also recapture the fort guarding the entrance to New Providence that was taken by Vane at the end of the first season.

This season also involves an intriguing back-story that explains how Captain Flint became the most feared pirate captain of his day.

The handsomely mounted, colorful ten-episode series was filmed in South Africa and features a fine cast of talented players.  The narrative and action is totally engrossing and filled with truly surprising plot twists.

Viewers who are turned off by violence, excessive profanity and blatant nudity should avoid the series, but all others are in for a exciting ride.

Anchor Bay Entertainment is releasing the Starz original series onto in a 3-disc set.  The collection contains a five Behind the Scenes featurettes.

6683812,5,B00NWKWA58,OMFG I just finished watching S2 of Black Sails on Blu-ray after buying it just the other day when it came out. I Binge-watched it straight through and it was 100 times better then S1 and I loved S1 so without further ado here is my review. I will start with the story which was extremely well derived from the finale of S1. I will say this much without spoilers and that is that it takes place immediately after S1 with Flint stuck on the island and trying to get back home. I mean there are a ton of other story threads which I will not divulge lest I ruin some bit of the story but needless to say it's Excellent. I will now move onto the cinematography and sound which were both Superb. I honestly didn't think they could top S1 but I was so wrong and it was captured beautifully and it was nice to see different scenery. I will now move onto the acting which again is flawless. I mean every actor and actress brought there A game to the second season. The new actors all did extremely well and the villain was quite adept to terrify anyone and everyone. I will now move onto the action which again I didn't think could top S1 and yet again I was wrong. The action was unparalleled to any show I have seen of late being when the action did come to fruition. I mean it was brutal and visceral just like in S1 but amped up fifty fold. I mean I watch a ton of shows including GOT and The 100 and etc and those shows are all Phenomenal as well but the contrived setting and knowing that these characters existed in reality also makes it that much more plausible and scary so to speak. I will finish by saying that if you have not watched this show then you need to drop whatever show you're watching right now and watch this series. I mean the production value and acting and everything else involved in the making of this series is unprecedented. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed. I will finish with this and that is that S1 is light on the background story but S2 more then makes up for that with there flashback scenes which draw you even more into certain characters pasts and in turn help you care about them and also help you to relate to them in a manner of speaking. Thanks again for your time and I hope you enjoy this show. Take Care. I can't wait for S3 this coming January and then S4 afterwards.,1446595200,,2321,4.20627802690583

6683814,2,B00NWKWA58,"Is there any story in these times that Hollywood doesn't change to fit a progressive political and cultural agenda? The character of Ann Bonny in this series is as believable as putting Pee Wee Herman in the same role. The women portrayed are all tougher and smarter than the men, most are portrayed as lesbians, and they wind up heroes and with the gold. Every woman and african portrayed has integrity, they are all victims and  all overcome the white man in the end for good. The series was not true to the book nor to history and will basically serve as propaganda for young people ignorant of history.",1446163200,11,606,4.559633027522936
6683815,5,B00NWKWA58,"*I received a review copy of this series in exchange for an honest review

I don't think Ive ever stated this on my blog before, but Im a huge fan of all things pirate-related.  Not the campy, Hollywood-envisioned pirates (Im looking at you, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, even though I love those films, too), but real life, historically accurate marauders.  As such, when I heard the fine folks at Starz were airing a series based on realistic buccaneers, I knew I had to give it a look.  And I am so glad I didBLACK SAILS is an amazing series, and it is an absolute epic masterpiece.  With beautiful scenery and painstaking realism, this show is the perfect blend of lavish history and rowdy fiction.

Make no mistake:  this show does not have swashbuckling pretty-boys in loafers, swinging from the mast of a ship by ropes while dueling with a eye-oned bad guy.  No, this is a gritty, day-to-day glimpse at how a pirate crew could have (and probably did) live back then.  This stark realism is a big part of what makes this show so good.

BLACK SAILS is shot well and appears to have a high production budget.  As I mentioned above, the attention to detail is excellent.  No expense is spared when it comes to making each scene look authentic.  The sole discrepancy I could find in this regard is the clothing; I saw a couple of outfits I didn't think actually fit into the time period.  But Im not very well versed on clothing styles through the centuries, so I won't officially call this out.

The acting is superb, with Toby Stephens portraying the main character, Captain Flint.  Stephens has recently become one of my favorite actors, due in large part to this role.  I don't think anybody else could have played the part as well as he does.  Likewise, Zach McGowan does an excellent job as Flints rival, Captain Vane.  McGowan also owns this role, and no substitute could probably ever be found for him.  The rest of the cast does a fine job as well, with several notable names (I will not list them all here, as there are many).

The storyline in BLACK SAILS is intriguing and enthralling.  Each episode unleashes more drama and more intensity as the plot unfolds.  This is another positive for the show, and its another key component to my enjoyment.  I daresay this writing is some of the finest on television today.

Season two starts off with a bang, and the intensity never lets up.  It picks up immediately where season one leaves off, and the story continues on at a constant pace from there.  A couple of minor twists occur here and there, but nothing considerably crazy happens.  Thankfully, the writing continues to excel as the season progresses.

BLACK SAILS is a huge win for me, and I highly recommend this addictive historical fiction series to everyone.  Dont let the kids watch this, howeverit is rated Mature for good reason.  Theres a boatload of sex and profanity, which explains why the show is on Starz.  Nevertheless, its a heck of a show and a heck of a lot of fun.  Season two hits store shelves next Tuesday, so make a note.",1445990400,4,3056,4.569060773480663

6683912,4,B00NWKWA58,Great graphics and storyline. The only problem I have with the show is that they make Captain Flint (a fictional character from Treasure Island) a homosexual or bisexual. I fail to see the relevancy of adding this element to the show. Maybe to appeal to the LGBT? I don't have a problem with the LGBT community; I do have a problem with twisting a classic to fit their agenda. It is a confusing and unrealistic addition to the storyline.,1433030400,5,437,4.544303797468355

6683921,3,B00NWKWA58,This season was ok but thought the writing reflected trying to get a shock factor for ratings instead of following original idea.,1432857600,3,129,4.909090909090909
6683922,5,B00NWKWA58,"Whilst season one was good (to me anyway) it was quite clearly setting the scene and introducing the characters for us. Whilst watching it, I kept thinking, 'where's the open sea, the tall ships and pirates behaving like pirates' that was until near the end...then it was full steam ahead. Agreed, there is some nudity, but bear in mind that Black Sails is not a historical or educational program but it is based upon pirates and their lives, fictional lives that is. Also, it is made for entertainment, and it is not a Disney production like Pirates of the Caribbean. That said, the reproduction details of clothing, ships and weapons etc look very authentic.

Once you accept all of the above, then I'm sure that like me, you'll become a fan of the show. Don't get me wrong, I was a little hesitant with season one and wasn't sure where it was going but now that the characters have developed a little and Captain Flint has his ship, this has become a 'must watch'. The shipboard scenes are such that you can almost smell the salt of the Ocean and feel the ships hull lurching beneath you, whilst sailing through beautiful panoramas of the Caribbean.

Compared to previous Starz shows like the Spartacus series, the nudity, sex and buckets of flowing blood have been toned down slightly and maybe rightly so, but the intelligent story lines and twists have improved tenfold. With the introduction of Ray Stevenson (Rome's Titus Pullo)  in season 3, I really can't wait to see it. Easily a five star series.",1432857600,,1508,4.683018867924528

6683928,3,B00NWKWA58,"For the good and the bad, see MyD's 5-star review. This is about the ugly, so here's fair warning: those in charge of the thematic direction of the show have (in top agitprop form) disgraced and denigrated Captain Flint, scurrilously slighted Robert Louis Stevenson, and defamed the entire series. And this they managed to do in but two short sequences (XIII & XVII) imposed illegitimately upon the story (meaning any number of alternate reasons were and are readily available as more fitting explanations). One wonders then at the anachronistic Victorian-era substitution of an Oscar Wilde-esque biopic in lieu of naked breach of trust, repeated adulterous infidelity, and guilt. Does this clear up the tension in Flint's backstory or disfigure it to soft sell a manufactured ""scandal""? And why on earth is the only truly decent person created by the show forced, in hackneyed fashion, to be the poster boy for a pushy ideology? ""Know no shame"" is about as trite as it gets for a rationalization of violating one's own conscience. My only hope is that this negative review might prepare some happy few for the delusory Season 2, Episode 5 bait and switch. Given what amounts to a breach of code and treacherous subversion of decency, my ship has been sunk, I stand marooned on an island in shark-infested waters, and the vessel that attacked and robbed me without provocation sails away under the banner of a fruity, rainbow flag (no offense to rainbows). May the show never again raise colors but instead ever fly its namesake, the skull and crossbones.",1431820800,7,1555,4.938931297709924

It takes the viewer back to before Captain Flint was Captain Flint, and furthers the story of Long John Silver. And then of course one can't help but love the bad boy Charles Vane. I love how this show portrays the real historical characters and situations that actually existed and happened, and intertwines them with the fictional characters of Captain Flint and Long John Silver.

6683939,3,B00NWKWA58,"Spoiler Alert: I am about to tell you why I am givimg this 3 stars. And what parts of it got 2 stars deducted from the series.

1) Too much drama and discussion, not enough piracy.  After a while all the scheming, plotting, secret meetings, etc. make you think you're watching an old episode of 24.

2) Every main character is gay or bisexual. While I personally do not care what people do in real life, I find it incredibly lazy writing to randomly make the main characters LGBT. As if Captain Flint culdn't possibly just be a monster who enjoys killing, bloodletting, raping, pillaging,.. you know... Being a PIRATE?!? Oh no... He's suddenly bisexual and angry at being oppressed by an unfair society of 1700's London that he already TURNED HIS BACK ON!?! What??? How lazy have the writers gotten?

3) What's next another bisexual femal love triangle with Rackham, the whore, and the girl murderer Anne? Oh guess what lazy writing has prevailed again. Sounds a lot like Season 1's female lesbian love triangle with the women trading queen? Oh yeah. It is almost exactly the same.

4) It moves very slowly... Except that everything is SOOOOO URGENT. But then its not. And suddenly its ok for every move to take forever. As long as there's time for the endless drama (and lack of piracy or pirate like behavior) to go on FOREVER!",1431216000,18,1329,4.638297872340425

6683954,5,B00NWKWA58,"I just finished watching the Second Season of Black Sails and I loved it. It isn't without it's flaws--the flashbacks got to be a bit much for me in the first episodes, but by the last episode where we learn why Flint's (past) violence against a single powerful Lord occurred, it was worth it. That flashback was particularly well done, probably because it was short. The writing is witty, often darkly humorous--which I love--and the acting is superb. Many of these actors are theater trained and yet they say so much with micro-expressions that there isn't a moment when one doesn't believe them. Toby Stephens as Flint is outstanding, although I'd like to see him laugh a bit. Zach McGowan as Vane is totally believable in his strength and his vulnerability, a rough combination to pull off well, but he does it expertly. Luke Arnold as Silver is funny and smart and filled with the kind of charisma that makes the viewer want to root for him. Tom Hopper, who I don't recall ever seeing before, has a quiet strength that he brings to the character of Billy Bones that I never remember jumping from the pages of Treasure Island--Hopper's wonderful and so is the character the writers have created for him. I haven't seen Hannah New in anything before, but I'll be looking for her now. She doesn't steal every scene she's in, I bet she's too good an actress for that, but she does make a statement when she's there. I love her character and her mixed and varied motivations. I especially like the chemistry she has with Zach McGowan's, Captain Vane and hope to see more of it in Season Three. I wasn't bothered by the love Flint has for either of the people he chose to love. I understand that graphic love scenes bother some, I simple wasn't bothered by any of them in this show. I think Starz does this particularly well. The Spartacus Series is another fine example--God's of the Arena is my favorite of that series. I'm looking forward to Season Three of this series and am finding myself cheering on the Black Flag! If sex and love between same sex couples bothers you, there are scenes depicting that in this series, and although they are well done, perhaps you should choose something else to watch.",1430956800,6,2207,4.6183206106870225
