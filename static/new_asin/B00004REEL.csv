7920727,4,B00004REEL,"I first saw this program on cable in the late 90's and really enjoyed it. Got a copy of it on Amazon several years back to show it to my little brother when he started getting into magic.

This program does a good job of explaining the principles behind various magic tricks without actually revealing how it is done. So you have to do a little bit of thinking.

Hosted by Harry Anderson with appearances by Criss Angel and Lance Burton. Entertaining and informative to watch. Just wished they added some extras on the DVD. Great for fans of magic.",1227139200,4,548,4.47
7920728,5,B00004REEL,"When I bought this DVD, I wasn't sure it will be interesting. But after I saw it... I just love it. It presents how magicians create their magic tricks from the sicience point of view. It introduce you many great magicians and tells you about the strategies they use to fool people. I really recommend this!",1149379200,9,307,4.5
