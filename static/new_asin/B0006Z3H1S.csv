8044084,1,B0006Z3H1S,"I bought this DVD because of all the 5-star reviews I read on this product.

I felt deceived after I received this DVD and put it in the DVD player.
I was dissappointed by what was offered in this product.
First off, the length of the dvd is incredibly short and the content is very limited for the price paid.

Second of all, the content claims that it's ""developed to aid children in learning the building blocks of language"" and that it's ""Appropriate for infants through 'school age' children"".

My daughter got terribly bored of this DVD.  The DVD only seems to show a series of animated backdrops while the ""Alphabet Song"" is sung by a womans voice.  After the DVD has recycled itself for about 3 minutes, my daughter (who already knows The Alphabet Song by heart) looses interest and turns the TV off out of boredom.  My youngest daughter (18mo toddler) showed interest in the DVD at first.  However, after it starts recycling itself over and over again, after maybe 5-10 minutes, she looses interest too and goes back to playing with her other toys.

When I attempted to play the dvd during nap times or bedtimes, it seemed to stimulate both of my kids awake too much.  They didn't actually go to sleep till I turned it off and they had peace and quiet to fall asleep to.

The DVD flashes each letter of the alphabet (in upper-case only) on the screen along with the ""Alphabet Song"" which is nice as it can provide letter recognition this way, however, when the song reaches the letters, ""L-M-N-O-P"", these letters are flashed quickly and the singer sings them quickly so any child trying to recognize each letter of the alphabet, simply can't keep up.

In my opinion, this product, though it seems to teach letter recognition, it provides poor quality letter recognition skills..... so

If you want a product that will teach any 'quality' letter recognition skills to your child, then this product will probably not work for you.
If you want a product that will teach your child the ""Alphabet Song"" then this will be the perfect product for you.
If you want a product that teaches any 'phonics' skills, then this product WILL NOT work for you.
If you want a product that will occupy your baby or small child for a short while, then this product might work for you.",1251331200,,2273,4.599009900990099

OUR EXPERIENCE:
Our infant gave this DVD a rave applause into slumberland. Turning it on at bedtime, proved to be a true success. He sat there watching it quietly, and soon I found he was fast asleep. I laid him down, leaving the DVD play and he stayed fast asleep.

This DVD is meant to be played when a child is going to sleep, so it continues on after they have fallen fast asleep. The calm, repetition of the music, softly playing the ABC song, in the same tone, while the graphics subtly change from cows jumping over the moon, while the moon sings to you, to fish jumping in the water, as the sun sings to you, on to stars twinkling in the sky, while they sing to you. All are singing the same song, in the same tone and voice, and while they sing, the letters appear on the screen in the forefront.

It is a proven fact we can learn when hearing things in our sleep. It is also a proven fact that repetition is a great teacher. Combine the two, and you can see why this DVD has been such a hit. Now you can give your infant or child a head start on their learning, by using this tool, which they enjoy watching when awake, but can also learn with, when asleep.

This is not a short, 10 minute DVD. It is long play. This allows the level of sound after baby or child has fallen asleep, to remain constant, which helps they get to the deep sleep cycle sooner, and not be disturbed by other noises around them. It creates a whitenoise effect, which is soothing.

I highly recommend this DVD for those with infants and young children. If your child loves it 1/2 as much as my baby, you will be so glad you purchased it.",1133913600,2,2317,4.444444444444445
8044086,5,B0006Z3H1S,"This CD is perfect for soothing children while they learn.  The CD loops so I do not have to continuously repeat the programs, which is a great advantage.  Many times when I've checked on my infant son, he had fallen asleep, peacefully, to the cd.

An excellent buy!",1126569600,6,266,4.5
8044087,5,B0006Z3H1S,"Designed to be played while baby sleeps, this animated dvd of the Alphabet Song may help promote early letter recognition. Because repetition is a key factor in early learning, the video automatically replays itself.

Visual lullaby. Repetitious. Soothing. Circular movement of subjects make it a video mobile. Bright, contrasting colors are easy for infant eyes to focus on. . """,1124755200,4,379,5.316666666666666
8044088,5,B0006Z3H1S,My child just loved this dvd. It has a great calming effect on my child. The original are work is charming. The repetitiveness of the ABC's is a great learning tool also. I wish I had this when my two other children were little. I would recommend this dvd for anyone with a young child and it makes a great baby gift for newborns. I can't wait for the next nite lite dvd in the series to come out.,1122854400,,397,4.037974683544304
8044089,5,B0006Z3H1S,I loved this product.  It reinforces learning while providing a calming effect.  Another sleep product I have purchased is the Bell Blocker at [...] It helps prevent unwanted doorbells rings from waking my sleeping child during naps and in the evening.,1109635200,5,252,5.121951219512195
8044090,5,B0006Z3H1S,"This is GREAT, what a calming video.  My son loves to sing along with the video while he is just playing and I use it before he goes to bed to help calm him down.  He sings along with the video and he can recite the ABC's without skipping a beat!!!  The other thing I like is the motion is not so fast so they can really comprehend what is on the screen.  We love that it repeats because he is learning plus you don't have to constantly hit play over and over.",1107129600,5,460,3.913978494623656
8044091,5,B0006Z3H1S,"This DVD is such a hit! Our 5 year old, 4 year old and 3 month old  all love it! It is a very calming dvd to play at night but my kids watch it  during the day also and even in the car.  The soothing music and the ABC song are just wonderful. It recycles over and over so you don't have to keep pushing play. We have tried the Baby Einstein dvd's but our kids aren't interested in them. They are absolutely mezmorized by the Nitelite dvd and my husband and I love it because they are learning their ABC's while watching  it! We don't have to feel guilty putting on a DVD to get a minutes peace because they are learning the fundamentals of language while they are watching.",1106006400,7,673,4.075757575757576
