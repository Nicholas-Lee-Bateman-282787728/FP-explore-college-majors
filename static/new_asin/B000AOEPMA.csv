2390271,5,B000AOEPMA,"This Martha Stewart * CLASSIC THANKSGIVING DVD is just great, it is like having someone right there in the kitchen with you, so easy to follow it has Turkey ideas, decorating, crafts,desserts and more .I would recommend this dvd if you just love Thanksgiving ,the holidays and cooking.",1281139200,4,285,4.958333333333333
2390272,5,B000AOEPMA,"This book has been so helpful in planning and making holiday meals.  It can also be used for every day cooking, as well.  This book does not need to be set on a shelf only to be used once or twice a year.  Great book.",1243814400,,217,3.7777777777777777
2390273,1,B000AOEPMA,This had nothing I could use. The decorations were juvenile and the recipes could be obtained anywhere.,1197072000,,103,5.117647058823529
2390274,4,B000AOEPMA,Martha Stewart with a powerdrill! Haha! I doubt I would attempt to pull off half the stuff she does! She rocks!,1194652800,,111,4.333333333333333
2390275,5,B000AOEPMA,"I loved this DVD. I have made so many of the recipes. It is very user-friendly on the computer, as well.",1168560000,3,104,4.0
2390280,3,B000AOEPMA,"Not what I thought it was, but still informative",1420848000,,48,4.444444444444445
2390281,5,B000AOEPMA,"Once again Martha shows you how minuscule you should feel about your capabilities with regard to holiday entertaining. Despite an erudite air she masterfully conveys simple tips for complicated projects that you still love. Though she can irritate she often overcomes it with a genuine passion for perfection that can only serve as an example for people to get their sh*t together in their own lives, whether crafting a pot holder from homespun linen or simply remembering to balance one's checkbook.  Martha reminds you to be your very best.",1419379200,,542,5.089887640449438
2390282,5,B000AOEPMA,"This is not a bad dvd at all, especially for viewers who are looking for Thanksgiving cooking options. Martha and her guests show viewers how to roast a basic turkey, a blackened turkey and a boned turkey, as well as how to spit-roast a turkey on a grill and how to deep-fry a turkey, low-country style.  As much as we may like to believe the negative things we're heard about Martha, she's actually quite likable and is clearly in command of the techniques she demonstrates.  I would certainly pay more than they're asking for this video.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it.",1416787200,,580,4.5576923076923075
2390283,5,B000AOEPMA,"I have watched this over and over. You get great recipies, table decorating ideas, and a few crafts, all done in the Martha Stewart fashion of quality, and pleasantries. I hope she continues to put out more of these DVD's.",1413158400,,222,4.575

2390285,1,B000AOEPMA,"Why, Martha, Why? This is supposed to be classic martha stewart. It's more like classic crap. pass this up. Buy it for a dollar at Half-Priced books, sit there with your jaw open in amazement of how stupid it is, and then throw it away.",1390262400,,236,4.266666666666667
2390286,5,B000AOEPMA,"Love this Thanksgiving DVD.  You should know it's one of the three in the Holidays 2005 collection.  Give us more vintage DVDs, Martha!",1388880000,,135,4.826086956521739
2390287,4,B000AOEPMA,"I love Martha, I just do not like it when she has a guest, they seem to both want to talk at the same time. ""Confusing""!!",1388016000,,121,3.6923076923076925
2390288,4,B000AOEPMA,"It was a great set of ideas and how to's for cooking Thanksgiving dinner and decorating and I enjoyed it very much, but you could not print the recipes and because it's several years old you could not get some of the specific recipes at MarthaStewart.com.",1385596800,2,255,4.565217391304348
2390289,5,B000AOEPMA,"If you are willing to learn Martha Stewart has everything you need, books, dvd, magazines, t.v shows. I am a novice at the whole kitchen thing and I want to learn. Although I have been baking for sometime, I still need to learn how to cook (egad!) For me it's a scary process, not wanting to waste food, so I turned to Martha's videos and they have helped me so much. The program here is beautifully constructed showing you how to prepare a multitude of seasoned turkeys and different ways of cooking them. Also, the stuffings are diverse and enticing and Martha gives wonderful ways of decorating your table(s) for a holiday get together, from buffet style, rustic style to candelight. I have been so inspired i'm ready to host my own thanksgiving. Hopefully, soon... Enjoy!",1308528000,3,775,4.705882352941177

8078998,5,B000AOEPMA,"Never fail Martha. Enjoy her videos for holiday prep, can't go wrong. Good tips.",1507680000,,80,4.785714285714286
8078999,5,B000AOEPMA,"Easy to navigate and well thought out segments. Some will be duplicates because it is not possible to separate turkey, and stuffing, cooking tips.

What makes this series so good is this that is where Martha started out and where she excels so well. She not only describes her favorites and reveals her secrets; she also has guests with uniquely different ideas about the Thanksgiving meal.

Under Classic Thanksgiving we have:
Turkey five ways
Best Stuffings
Favorite Side Dishes
Special Deserts
Table Settings and Decorating
Kids Thanksgiving Crafts

Somehow she was able to miss my favorite cornbread stuffing. But we can't stuff everything on one DVD now can we. It is also interesting to see how easy Martha handles raw turkeys.

Under printouts the instructions are to view this material please place this disc into a computer with a DVD-Rom Drive and internet connection or go to [...] Both worked for me. I can not see how anyone can live today without a DVD-Rom.",1505174400,7,971,4.902439024390244
