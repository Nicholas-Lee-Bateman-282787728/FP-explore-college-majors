291608,5,630026968X,I can see why this movie is on the list of favorites.  It was very moving and showed the extreme emotions that love causes.  I would highly recommend it.,1043280000,8,153,4.241379310344827
291609,2,630026968X,"This is far and away the sexiest movie I have ever seen.  But all you folks who enjoy seeing great big breasts, forget it.  Also, if the sight of muscular, slender, not fat, women does not turn you on, forget it.  Ms Hemingway and Ms donnelly are both gorgeous ladies; Ms Donnelly has the most beautiful face I have ever seen.  Forget the story; there may never have been a story; it is about female pentathletes training for the 1980 Olympics, with the conflicts among the two ladies, their coach and the father of one of the ladies.  The movie has a happy ending--I think.  I won't worry about it.  The dialogue, a lot of the time, is as if the actors are making it up as they go along.  Sometimes it works.  By far the greatest fault is the mushmouth delivery of the players.  If the director had wanted desperately to guarantee that the audience not understand what the characters are saying, he could not have succeeded any better than he did.  Would the director recognize a consonant if he could have heard one in this movie?  The photography is magnificent: a lot of slow motion, long telephoto shots of the ladies in action on the field.  Also, some composite (Maybe that's what they could be called.) shots of one particular activity, in slow motion, switching from one athlete to the next to the next to the next ... as the activity proceeds.  Absolutely beautiful!  My rating, above, is not for me, necessarily; it is my estimate of what more nearly normal folks would rate it.  As for me, I will probably watch it another dozen times.  I may leave the sound off, but ...; oh well, maybe two dozen times more!",993427200,11,1621,4.477815699658703
291610,5,630026968X,"So, I'm having a party conversation with a lesbian friend and ""Personal Best"" comes up. She denounces it as a lousy portrayal of lesbianism. Yeah, I answer, but it is a great sports movie! And it is  too. Personal Best is not just a great sports movie, but is also a great  bildungsroman (""coming of age"" movie). In it the lead character,  Chris Cahill (Mariel Hemingway) is involved in a dysfunctional relationship  with her father who is a coach. We see little of her family life. The movie  revolves around her moving to a new family and getting new parents: Tory  Skinner (Patrice Donnelly) and Terry Tingloff (Scott Glenn, who is, you  guessed it, a coach). The problem is the tranference of parental relations  is confused from the very beginning by a sexual relation between Chris and  Tory. The waters are muddled even further when jealousy rears his head  between the ""parents,"" and between Tory and Chris who are set in  competition against each other by Tingloff. Through it all, Chris grows up  so that, when Tingloff comes on to her in a vulnerable situation, she  staves him off (unlike Tory in a earlier scene) and begins to develop her  own relationships and her own philosophy of competition. The moral of the  movie is: To be competitive you don't have to be better than everybody  else, just a little bit better than you were yesterday. You don't have to  kill the competition, you can love the competition, but always remember,  you are the competition.",961200000,45,1473,4.732283464566929
291642,3,630026968X,It's an interesting artifact from the early 80s.  Definitely pulls its punches in relation to the LGBT content.  Mariel Hemingway ends up sounding more whiny than is particularly attractive from the early 21st century perspective.,1473292800,,230,5.542857142857143

291674,4,630026968X,Mariel gives an honest and strong performance while opening a door into the world of athletes competing for a spot on the U.S. Olympic team. The movie is worthy of ownership I feel and I was very happy to be able to finally get it in HD. When the movie first came out it was considered very controversial because of the nudity and because being gay or lesbian was still shocking. The movie and subject are beautifully produced and reflect the attitudes of the time. You may find some of the camera angles a bit provocative so I think it may not be suitable for the very young. I like this movie enough to have looked for it for a long time. I recommend this movie.,1419465600,3,664,4.277777777777778

291679,5,630026968X,OK to be honest there really is not much to this movie but having said that I could watch a two hour film of Mariel Hemingway  reading a phone book and I'd still give it 5 stars. It's not a bad movie but as far as plot goes it's nothing you haven't seen before. As far as Mariel goes ...she looks spectacular,1399075200,,308,3.967741935483871

291712,2,630026968X,"Pretty lame movie, had read so much about it at the time thought I should have it. Very dated, some good film work but the story is tortured and weak. I really didn't want to see Hemingway nude, nor athletes smoking pot ( I don't think so!). Very much a period piece. The Lesbo scenes were laughable too.",1393891200,,304,4.258620689655173

291717,5,630026968X,"Excellent Movie about Female Athletes and sports in general. They sweat, they struggle, they fight, they have complicated relationships which can hurt their performances during competition and sometimes, they hook up. This is the most physical demanding movie I have ever seen and the performances are great. It was way ahead of its time.",1373414400,4,338,5.277777777777778
291718,3,630026968X,"Chris Cahill (Mariel Hemingway) is young and talented with a dream to qualify for the American track-and-field team and then go on to 1980 Olympic Games. When Chris begins training with her role model, Tory Skinner (Patrice Donnelly), she is motivated by Tory's drive to succeed.

As the women spend long hours together training, the sexual chemistry begins to grow and soon they become lovers. After Chris suffers an injury, their coach Terry (Scott Glenn) blames Tory for the accident. Luckily, Chris recovers form the injury in time for the Olympic tryouts, but this pits the lovers against each other for a coveted place on the Olympic team.

Robert Towne wrote, produced and directed this 1982 film that looks at the world of women's athletics and the challenges these athletes encounter. The US however, boycotted the Moscow Olympics for political reasons, leaving these Olympic hopefuls with only their own Personal Best performances as consolation.

Patrice Donnelly gained notoriety for her sensitive portrayal as lesbian athlete Tory Skinner in the film. As Donnelly was already a track star in her own right, she was uniquely familiar with the world of women's track-and-field. Mariel Hemingway reportedly trained an entire year in an effort to portray young bisexual athlete Chris Cahill with authenticity.

291719,3,630026968X,Set in the 70s. A story about athletes traing for the Moscow Olympic Games. It focuses on 2 women and their relationship,1360454400,,120,4.5
291720,5,630026968X,This is the start of her great career. The story is awesome. It's a young girl who learns about herself while budding into a young woman. It's a little slow to start but it builds up quickly.,1356652800,,191,4.1891891891891895
291721,2,630026968X,This was a stupid movie.  The acting wasn't very good and I did not care about the characters at all.,1346803200,,101,4.05
291732,5,630026968X,"I admit I am positively biased in favor of this movie. I saw it long ago when I was young and it impressed me alot in yonder days that now are long gone. Was it the nudity scenes? No, though there are enough of them to attract many an adolescent. Was it the relationship problems that connect and disconnect the personnage? Maybe. But sure it was the sports ethics that attracted me to this movie: the complicated interplay of mental and physical fitness, and how strongly psychology can impact on athletic achievements.

If you are not interested in any of these things the film might turn out a giant loss of time (130"") and a disappointment on top of it. If, however, you like Mariel Hemmingway or any other actor involved this might be a good opportunity to see them at quite a young age.

The digi quality was fairly well, satisfying my humble standards at least. The sound came out quite silent, but that might be a problem with my (European!) equipment.",1334016000,7,960,4.543352601156069
291733,5,630026968X,"This movie is a real movie about these sports with no Hollywood nonsense. Great acting. Kind of slow movie in the middle and at times hard to follow dialogue but then it finishes as a solid drama and was compelling too. Ok, that was fine is the coffee ready? I thought it was not going to rain today but oh well. Cool, yeah sounds good.",1333152000,,336,4.184615384615385
291734,3,630026968X,"For its time, this was probably quite a shocker and explored some territory that we were not used to seeing in film:  lesbians in a relationship and in the world of sports.

The two weak points for me were Hemingway, who was not such a great actress; and the fact that the movie seemed to drag on much longer than it needed to.  Otherwise, it is nicely shot and has a good core story.",1332720000,,384,4.162162162162162

291738,3,630026968X,"Bizarre title, I know, but this was a good movie, back before Mariel got implants, became a slut.  I saw it years ago, liked the overall content of the movie, the lesbian scenes, and the comic parts, (holding her boyfriends part while he pees to see what it is like to pee standing up) .... I enjoyed the frustrations, knowing how it related to the super competitiveness, in sports and the olympics.  At all costs ....  Good movie",1252886400,2,430,4.487179487179487
291739,3,630026968X,"When Personal Best came out in 1982, at about the same time as Chariots of Fire - another running movie - I loved it.  But seeing it again, it's lost something. Now, all I see is Mariel Hemingway whining and crying through the whole movie.  I think what caught me the first time was the great photography, Mariel's hot bod, and Scott Glenn's great lines about comparing coaching the women's team to Chuck Noll coaching the Pittsburgh Steelers.  All three are still great.  Just don't expect much else.",1227571200,4,501,4.659090909090909

291765,5,630026968X,"This is most definitely NOT lesbian cinema. Rather it is a touching love story between two people; one of whom happens to be a lesbian and the other (Hemmingway), who is bi. The writing, casting and direction of this movie are top-notch. The only negative is that it is rather anti-climactic due to the ridiculous boycott of the 1980 Olympics by the US government.",1195862400,4,364,4.703125
291766,5,630026968X,"I found myself watching ""Personal Best"" again after several years.  Robert Townde creates a movie of coming of age within the world of sports, focusing on the human bodies of women in training in a veritable and also erotic way.  The interweaving of the love affair with the rigors of sports and competition is superb.  Patrice Donnelly turns out to be the stronger actress, despite the fact that she is the sportswoman, not actress by trade.

The story about the women - which was incidental to the sports story - was good...but what the he11 was up with the man in the end with Hemingway's character??  And the peeing scene???  Please.

(I was one of the runners warming up during the track scenes and was also in the crowd) and even though I appreciated the good pay, knew it would suck just from watching it being filmed. Later at the ""premier"" I had to stifle my groans from all the bad acting. If you want to make a point about it being about lesbians that was ahead of the curve, fine, I just wish Hollywood would have picked a different subject matter and not have filmed it in Eugene.

291770,5,630026968X,"I liked the movie when I saw it in the early 80s because of the break through ""love"" scenes and the sports theme. Right now I'm listening to a late night talk show interview with Mariel Hemmingway! I was drawn to this site because I was looking for some info on Jodi Anderson who acts in the movie. I knew her because she worked out in my gym in the 1980s and also worked there. In reality the sports part could have been based on her. In 1980 when she was 22 she won both the pentathlon and the long jump in the Olympic trials for the boycotted Moscow games. She also represented the USA in the pentathlon in the 1984 LA Olympics but was injured and withdrew. Considering the fame (and money) that USA female track athletes achieved in 1984 and later, the boycott was a tragedy for her and the other athletes most of whom are relatively unknown.",1089849600,3,846,4.29375
291771,5,630026968X,"This film has EXACTLY the right ingredients for being one of the best Guy Flicks of all time.  First, the behind-the-scenes look at athletic training techniques is incomparable.  The preparation methods are highly educational, the stretching, the warm-ups, the cool-downs -- actually seeing these activities demonstrated is invaluable for aspiring athletes.  Also, the details about various events were intriguing -- setting the blocks for sprinting, determining one's ""pace"" for high-jumping, the muscular ballet employed for the shot put.  Watching Coach Scott Glenn (Urban Cowboy's ""Wes Hightower"") was inspirational, he obviously knew how to get the most from a team member.  And the work-outs themselves were marvelous, the long runs, the hill-climbs, the post-workout massages and other physical therapy, with particular attention to specific body areas -- all of this information is extremely important for any male athlete, and should probably be viewed several times, numerous times, again and again, in order to ensure full comprehension and complete appreciation.",1072137600,19,1074,5.772151898734177

I checked other films from Warners and the same problem with some of them (Crusin', The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, Shoot the Moon, O Lucky Man). There is something going wrong with some of Warner's pressed DVDs from 2006 to 2009. They need to put these out on Blu Ray - I feel really ripped off.",1516752000,,468,4.153846153846154
7808102,3,630026968X,"This is a film about track and field athletes Tory Skinner (Patrice Donnelly) and Chris Cahill (Mariel Hemingway) who first meet at the 1976 Olympic trials and become super close, move in together, and remain lovers for several years.  When a turn of events --and a jealous, conniving coach-- ends up tearing them apart.... they eventually end up as competitors for pentathlete spots at the 1980 Olympic trials.

It's actually a great storyline as far as the basic premise goes.  A very good sports story. They end up as the team who don't go to Moscow because the U.S. boycotts their involvement in the Olympics for political reasons (to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan)... so these athletes have nothing but their Personal Best to aim at.  Fascinating.

But as far as the love story goes... meh.  It might be made better than a lot our lgbt+ films, but it's one of those typical old stories where the bisexual (Chris) ends up with a man and the lesbian (Tory) is left to lick her wounds.  No thanks.  Even as a young queer who rarely saw gays in film, I said, eff that!!  And I'm sure that's the main reason I never bothered to watch it again for decades.  Having now watched it again by chance, it's better and worse than I remember.

Tory is an experienced athlete and a true blue lesbian.  Chris is an immature and whiny little girl whose been broken and controlled by her daddy all her life. Yes, Chris is referred to as a bisexual... but I think she's just a lost little girl who drifts from one anchor to another-- anyone who can control her heart and guide her to success.  She doesn't have a real mind of her own.  She's empty and annoying.  I thought she was beautiful for about 46 seconds... her voice and personality are just too obnoxious.  So Tory takes her under her wing.

The actress who plays Tory is a real-life track and field athlete and very believable in her role. Her emotional eyes say so much. Deep down she knows she's holding on to something that won't last.  I just find the relationship a sad one, for the most part.  Though I will give Chris props for finding her own mind in the end and finally thinking for herself.  She goes that extra mile for Tory in ways you don't expect.  Again... the story of them as athletes is a good one.  There's a feel-good ending and these two remain friends. But it still feels like it's enforcing that classic Hollywood rule that queers can't have their happily ever after.

Another thing I have to note is all the nudity and skin shots.  These constant close ups of legs, butts, arms to the point of distraction.  Seems awfully gratuitous, and for 1982, this was definitely some soft porn.  Just wasn't anything sexy to me.",1514160000,,2701,4.517525773195876

Instead, she dipped her feet in the waters of performance.  She is still a beautiful woman, she is also a fine actress.  Great to look at.  I just wish she would do more film.
Personal Best was an interesting movie, it gave a look at professional sports, and the Athlete's who give their all, a look at what goes on behind the professional games.",1483747200,,512,4.347368421052631
