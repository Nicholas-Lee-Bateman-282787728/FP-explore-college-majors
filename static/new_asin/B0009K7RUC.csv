8062612,2,B0009K7RUC,"Programs like this should be closed-captioned.  I had to rely mostly on just the pictures.  Seller did not put any postage on the package, so I had to pay it or send it back.  I should've chose the latter.  I'd like to see the entire Biography series on DVD in complete season format.  That would be great, PROVIDING THEY'RE CLOSE-CAPTIONED!",1513123200,,341,4.616666666666666

8062615,2,B0009K7RUC,I have not be pleased with any of the A&E videos that we have purchased. Our family used them in a study of Anceint History & there were way to many classical naked pictures for young children scattered through out the movie. Some of the speakers also did not seem to really know the God of which they spoke.,1405382400,,308,4.237288135593221

8062617,5,B0009K7RUC,"Hello Readers,

This DVD is very informative in all of our DNA (Gene Pool) and How Did We, the awesome species that we are, Evolve.
Pay very close attention to Adam and Eve and the Nephilim (look that work up in an old dictionary or Google it).  You'll be moved with your discovery.
In this DVD and, of course the Bible, you'll have to tools to 'Count Down' to your DNA/Gene Pool.
Prior and current excavations/diggings are revealing extremely supportive and subtantial evidence of the human's beginning that is in alignment of Bible and this DVD.
In closing, read Geneses chapter 6 in the Bible (Old Testament).  This will be another point of discovery for you.",1312675200,3,662,4.689655172413793

8062619,3,B0009K7RUC,I was expecting something else. I wanted he real story not the one they have in the bible now. Still was a good one time watch. I was good to show in our Humanities class for a debate.,1217289600,,184,3.8684210526315788
