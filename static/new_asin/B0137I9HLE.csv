7360762,5,B0137I9HLE,I loved this show as a kid and it did not disappoint.  The dogs are very funny and my grandkids loved it.  It definitely has a set pattern as all Hanna Barbera cartoons have but who cares.  Enjoy!,1441324800,3,196,4.105263157894737
7360763,5,B0137I9HLE,Remember watching as a kid on Saturday mornings!! Love that I have in my collection of dvds!!,1441152000,,93,4.529411764705882

7360765,5,B0137I9HLE,"I've been waiting for this one for years.  I too had Boomerang rips but this DVD release is definitely better.  As stated at the top, these are burned as ordered by Amazon but if that's what it takes to get some of these older shows released, then I'm good with that.

I had always enjoyed this show as a kid and am glad that I finally get to see it in higher quality.",1440806400,7,368,4.013698630136986
7360766,5,B0137I9HLE,About darn time w b put this out. Thank you.,1439510400,6,44,3.5
7360767,5,B0137I9HLE,Solid mysterious sleuth hanna barbera cartoon really enjoyed watching the clue club especially like woofer & wimper were very entertaining,1439510400,7,138,5.95
7360768,5,B0137I9HLE,The opening jingle and Woofer and Whimpers voices bring back the best memories!!  To bad the show was short lived.,1439337600,7,114,4.7
7360769,4,B0137I9HLE,"Another HB cartoon that I've had on DVD for years.  My copy is a rip from the Boomerang network with great 480 quality.  This set is the usual offering from the WB Archive.  It's remastered and looks excellent on my HDTV.  This set is not as polished like the previous sets though.  You will notice the dust and grain at times.  It's not distracting but it's noticeable.  Also you can notice the color difference from frame to frame.  Some colors are bright and some are not.  But's that's nitpicking.  It looks better than my burned copy on every level.  Clue Club is one of the clones of Scooby Doo that was produced in the mid 70's.  In the 70's you had quite a few clones of Scooby Doo to choose from.  And I love every single one of them.  IMO it is not a great toon but it's not a terrible one either.  This is one of the better clones of Scooby Doo.  I was too young to remember this toon as a child but I did get to see it as a teen on the USA Cartoon Express.  Dottie will make you laugh.  She is smart, clever and funny while she tries to find any excuse to be at the crime scene and help search for clues.  She is the team savior on many occasions.  Woofer and Wimper (team dogs) are funny as well.  Often they are the comic relief of the episodes.  If you enjoy Scooby Doo you might enjoy these.  The complete series is here.  16 episodes in total.  DVD-R on Demand disc with eight episodes on each disc.  Fun for boys and girls of all ages.  Happy Clue hunting!!!!

Update: Make sure you check your discs though.  A few episodes freeze and skip on disc 1.  You need to fix this WB Archive.",1439337600,20,1602,4.1237785016286646

7360777,5,B0137I9HLE,"Clue Club was definately ahead of its -time. Using home computers, wrist communicators, and video/ audio communication in early 70s gives a startling glimpse of today's world of Skype and bluetooth watches. Using this technology and their intellegence to piece the clues together, Clue Club solves incredible mysteries.",1473552000,,319,5.666666666666667

7360783,5,B0137I9HLE,"A cross between a typical Hanna Barbera Scooby Doo Meddling Kids adventure and a who-dun-it mystery (a ""Who-Scooby Doo-done-it"") with multiple suspects with motives behind a crime caper, (usually theft, robbery, and one pig-napping, and no murder), a team of smart kids even if D.D. and Pepper might turned Shaggy-scared at times, and a comedy team of verbose canine sidekicks in bragging Woofer (voice of Paul Winchell) and sleepy Whimper (Jim MacGeorge).

Larry (David Joliffe) was the brains of the Clue Club team, putting together the clues gathered by himself,  Woofer, Whimper,  D.D. (Bob Hastings) and Pepper (Patricia Stich) and research at home by resident computer expert (circa 1977) Dotty (Tara Talboy) and gathering all of the suspects in one room to explain the solution of the mystery and identifying the actual culprit while Sheriff Bagley (John Stephenson) provided the law enforcement authority to make the arrest.

A nice twist to the meddling kids mystery formula Hanna-Barbera is best known for in the 1970s.",1465171200,4,1029,5.2560975609756095
7360784,5,B0137I9HLE,Very excited to see that some of the cartoons from Hanna Barbera that were not as popular as Scooby doo are available.  There aren't any special features and the quality is not  great but I am enjoying watching a cartoon from my childhood.,1464739200,,239,4.534883720930233

7360793,5,B0137I9HLE,A great Hanna-Barbara classic mystery teen series I really enjoyed growing up watching reruns of all the good old cartoons that came before me and this is one of them maybe cartoon network should try and reboot some these shows......,1455840000,,233,4.85

7360795,4,B0137I9HLE,"I like this one it's diffrent then Scooby-doo .The Dogs makes you laugh a lot of times, one is smart and the other one is stupid but act that he is smarter than anyone else to solve the mystery. The Kids have not a big personality but if you saw Scooby-Doo you can see some things being the same way. To be honest this one has more laughs then ""Goober and the Ghostchasers""",1447113600,,373,4.123287671232877

8727086,5,B0137I9HLE,"It seems that slightly more effort went into this than most of the other manufacture on demand releases I have bought since there's an actual splash screen that lists the episodes instead of the generic screen like other Warner Archive releases.  The show itself is good but you do have to remember that this is before Scooby Doo so you won't find too many unmaskings here and although there are a few monsters they usually just show up for comedic effect.  The endings are more of the ""gather up the supects and explain how and who did it"" trope but it's not a bad thing.  The tech invented by the resident genius girl is dick Tracy/comic book style and she acts more like a csi than Velma.  The real comedians are the dogs who can't talk to humans but do talk to each other.  Overall the whole team seems to solve the mystery and the local Sheriff is present in every episode to cart the bad guys away.  Overall a good show and interesting to see how they developed the medling kids fourmula.",1510358400,2,994,4.404371584699454

8727088,5,B0137I9HLE,Clearly a Scooby-Doo ripoff; but not bad at all.,1504483200,,48,4.444444444444445
