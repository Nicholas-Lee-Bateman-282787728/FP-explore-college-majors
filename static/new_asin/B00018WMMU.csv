8008081,2,B00018WMMU,"Samourais has alot of problems. It starts off with pretty OK, the plot centers around an ancient demon using technology and magic to stay alive, but then everything goes KABLOOEY when the action moves to France.

  The movie is like a poorly made Frankenstien's Monster: it got up off of the operating table but comes apart at the seams shortly afterwards. Samourais has some decent fight scenes, but is filled with bad acting and silliness which reaches a critical mass towards the end of the movie.

 Send this one back, it needs more seasoning.",1098403200,2,547,4.776595744680851
8008082,1,B00018WMMU,"If you are so masochistic as to rent/buy/fail to smash this DVD the moment you spot it, then you get what you deserve. This movie is an excellent illustration of why France and Japan are so far apart on the globe ... and why they should remain that way indefinitely, without any cultural contact. Ever.",1097193600,,302,4.509090909090909
