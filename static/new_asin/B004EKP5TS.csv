4337898,5,B004EKP5TS,Good Sound & Video.  While these are all new musicans to APP (except Alan) the songs are true to original versions,1357689600,,114,4.428571428571429
4337899,5,B004EKP5TS,"I'm a huge Alan Parsons Project fan, and have been for many years. This is my first DVD...I enjoyed it, and really liked seeing my favorite band i person, per se'. Thank You.",1357344000,,174,4.303030303030303
4337900,3,B004EKP5TS,The music is very well executed but the lead singer is less than good. I recommend this dvd for the excellant guitar work and nostalgic value.,1320624000,2,142,4.5
4337901,4,B004EKP5TS,"Concert is very raw and not over produced as some others are.
Disappointed the audio quality isn't 5.1 or DTS.
The band has a huge songlist to draw from and mostly they have selected some good choices for this DVD.
Am sure all fans would be happy just to own this.",1301443200,3,264,4.196078431372549
4337902,5,B004EKP5TS,"This was truly an excellent concert.  The video wasn't bad, although I wish it had been re-mastered.  The sound was decent.  If you are a fan of Alan Parsons you will 100% enjoy this DVD",1458864000,,186,4.257142857142857
4337903,5,B004EKP5TS,Best one ive ever seen!!!!,1445817600,,26,4.4
4337904,5,B004EKP5TS,"I have to admit - this is not one of the best concert DVDs I have had a pleasure to own. However, this is a testament to the Talent. Yes, the talent with the capital ""T"". The video quality is not great but it is not really bad, either. The aspect ratio is 4:3, which makes the picture distorted when I play it, and believe me - I've exhausted all the options trying to configure my high-end Denon receiver and the high-end Denon blu-ray player. Despite all that, the combination of the music and the visual sends shiver down my spine and reminds me what and who made this music ageless.",1437436800,3,586,4.288288288288288
4337905,4,B004EKP5TS,Good stuff,1434240000,,10,4.5
4337906,5,B004EKP5TS,"Great live concert, one of the best, I can tell...a little bad quality video resolution (it could it be better) but overall an awesome performance, great songs, it deserves 5 stars...!",1428624000,2,184,4.967741935483871
4337907,5,B004EKP5TS,"The band played very well and PJ Olssen is a great overall choice for a lead vocalist. He has a lot of energy and does a great job. I saw a completely different line up when he played Yoshi's in Oakland California, but PJ Olssen was there. The video is clear and the sound is very good. The booklet has no real pictures, but it's a video, so there was little need for that. European audiences are appreciative and less yelling and whistling than the US crowd, which makes for a better video. The cardboard box packaging was a surprise, as was the fact the glue used to hold the disc in place failed before I got it. I didn't buy it for the package, so it doesn't take away from the great live show. It was well worth the price.",1418428800,3,727,4.163120567375887

4337911,3,B004EKP5TS,"Interesting to have a concert from Alan Parsons in my collection, I own more that 300 concerts of rock music",1407974400,,108,4.45
4337912,5,B004EKP5TS,Really enjoyed this DVD concert. The sound quality was superb and the concert visuals top class!,1406505600,,96,5.0625
4337913,3,B004EKP5TS,It's OK. I knew going in this was an old video. Still a tad disappointed in the quality of the image.,1404172800,,101,3.857142857142857
4337914,4,B004EKP5TS,"Very simple stage show, not a big production, so don't expect much in the way of trick lighting or effects. Musicianship and song line-up are excellent. Sound quality is good, but surprised it's only in stereo. This DVD would be much better if mixed in 5.1 or DTS surround. Would have given 5 stars if in surround sound.",1403308800,3,320,4.5344827586206895
4337915,2,B004EKP5TS,"If not because I really like Alan Parson's, this video does not work. Rather poor sound, poor quality, not dolby. The concert is rather dull.",1402099200,3,141,4.68
4337916,4,B004EKP5TS,"I've loved APP since the seventies and was excited to find this dvd by accident. The body of work is huge, so it's difficult not to hear some favorites not included in this recording. Sound quality is decent, not great, and it would've been better to have it available in blue-ray. All in all, it is worth buying, but not quite what I was hoping for.",1398816000,2,350,4.318181818181818
4337917,5,B004EKP5TS,The music these guys created after Peter Gabriel left is simply amazing. So glad I found these CD/DVD recordings. Excellent!,1388016000,,124,5.25
4337918,3,B004EKP5TS,"Probably because I was fortunate enough to see APP in Jacksonville, FL, earlier this year and it was one of the best concerts I'd ever seen. The concert on this DVD shows what APP looks like coming out of the studio (with their brand new singer) and trying to play live. The video quality is good for non-Blu Ray but the audio required a lot of mixing on my part to get a good sound, but I'm audio fixated. Bottom line, if you really like APP it's worth adding to your collection but nothing like I'd hoped.",1380844800,,507,4.237113402061856
4337919,4,B004EKP5TS,"Alan Parsons music has always leaned more towards relaxation than stimulation.  No surround sound, somewhat weak stereo, and very little stage presence but if you like Alan Parsons music there's nothing to dislike and every song is played well by very competent musicians, even though there's not much dynamic stage presence or WOW factor.",1373155200,2,339,5.277777777777778
4337920,5,B004EKP5TS,"Amazing collection of Alan Parsons music and performances.  Not as good as seeing him live, but it will do here in the desert.  :)",1367798400,,130,4.375
4337921,5,B004EKP5TS,"I was always a fan of The Alan Parson Project and Alan Parsons, for decades now, but became an even bigger fan when I saw them live for the first time a few years ago at the California State Fair--their music and performance was mesmerizing on a warm summer night outdoors, right in the middle of the fairgrounds on the main stage there.  While nothing beats seeing them live, this DVD is a nice reminder (and individual experience) that comes close to approximating that live experience.  Highly recommended.",1364688000,,509,4.7727272727272725

8427132,2,B004EKP5TS,"Contrary to the flagrantly irresponsible or misleading review elsewhere here, this DVD DOES NOT PLAY ON ALL NORTH AMERICAN REGION ONE DVD PLAYERS.

We inserted the DVD into our Panasonic DVD/VIDEO CD/CD PLAYER model DVD-RV31. The screen immediately went blank with a message in the center saying: ""THIS DISC CANNOT BE PLAYED. PLEASE INSERT A DIFFERENT DISC""

Yes our DVD player is not very new, even though it looks and works like it is. It does play ALL region 1 DVDs, we buy from all over the world, PERFECTLY.

Luckily, we have a lengthy HDMI cable running from my PC corner around to the rear of our big screen TV. So we could watch this DVD through the HDMI3 input on our TV.

WARNING: Do not buy this DVD unless you have a solution other than a simple vintage North American Region 1 DVD player, to play it on. Our ""like-new"" DVD player is from 2002.",1503792000,,856,4.467948717948718
