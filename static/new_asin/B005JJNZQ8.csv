8475798,3,B005JJNZQ8,"Plenty of films ask the question, ""Could a main character still love a person if they became deformed, got a mental disease, wasn't as rich as they said, lied about being married, etc.?""  Few films ask, ""Could you love a person if they were not the gender that you suspected?""  ""Crying Game"" asked that, but more people focused on ""the secret"" than on that larger discussion.  Well, here a man's girlfriend dies and he begins to think she was re-incarnated into a man.  In fact, the new man starts to think the theory can be true.  In the 1990s, I once read that an LGBT film festival meant to take place at a famous Korean university was closed down due to prejudiced people's reactions.  Thus, this was a brave film to be filmed abroad.  Then again, as far as I am concerned Koreans are very open to controversial topics if they didn't flinch at ""Oldboy.""  There's just something laudable about this film and I recommend it.",1395187200,,926,4.536144578313253
