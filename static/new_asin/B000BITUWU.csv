2420244,5,B000BITUWU,"You might not like the pimp/ho lifestyle but as a former working girl who had the ""game"" played on her at 18, what's shown in this movie is a way softer side of the life. My pimp wouldn't have thrown her out he would have beat her bloody, then may have sold her to another pimp or kept her and through beatings and brain washing turned her into a ""real"" ho! And the love he showed to his bottom bitch and the confidence he gave his snow flake is a gentler side of the game! And trying to become more than a pimp and taking his girls with him would be a dream come true for a real life ho! I've been out of the game for 30 years and doing a trick for a microphone wouldn't have made me bat an eye back in the day. If you want to complain you can say DJ was too soft but otherwise don't complain about something you never experienced and could never understand!",1517011200,,859,4.0

2420247,5,B000BITUWU,Pretty realistic movie. It shows the real life that people want to really live. Not the life they are living. Most of all. Dreams can come true if you are persistent enough. Really liked the ending. Would recommend this movie.,1516406400,,226,4.675

2420274,5,B000BITUWU,"I remembered this movie after seeing Taraji P. Henson killing it in Hidden Figures. There are so many incredible actors in this movie that are still around doing great things. You can boil it down to a fairly simplistic plot but the ride and seeing how music comes together (very relatable in my life) is incredible. He's gone far since this flick came out, but this is Terrance Howard to me.",1484611200,,392,4.535211267605634

2420276,4,B000BITUWU,"My real rating would be 3.5 stars. Terrance Howard really came with it in his acting and the storyline had very good character arcs. There was realism to the story. That said, the movie was kind of meaningless at the end. Not a disappointing end. Just underdeveloped. You got so deep into these characters and then you're left thinking... OK.  It was a lot of running for that particular ending... Not a bad movie at all though.  It's one of those you have to watch with an open mind and judge for yourself.  It did have the makings for a great movie.",1483833600,,551,4.382352941176471

2420301,5,B000BITUWU,"A tough, by moments unpleasant and shocking but still very good drama. I liked it a lot. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

DJay (Terrence Howard) is a pimp and small time drug dealer. He has a ""stable"" of three girls: Nola (Taryn Manning), the ""white bunny"", Shug (Taraji P. Henson), a shy gal, currently heavily pregnant and Lexus (Paula Jai Parker), who is loudmouthed and rebellious. DJay barely manages to break even and is quite obviously dissatisfied with his life. One day he meets succesively a keyboard for kids and an old friend from school, Key (Anthony Anderson), who has become a sound technician. That gives him an idea - he will make hip hop songs and get rich... And then the film really begins.

The main character is a mixture of pathetic and unpleasant, the three female characters live in misery and exploitation and as we all know the best laid plans frequently don't survive the first contact with reality, but somehow this film manages to stay optimistic. This is the story of a man and three (later two) women who try to change their lives to better and it is shown in a great way. I was quite impressed by the scenario, the actors (especially Taraji P. Henson) and, even if I don't really care much for rap, yes, even the music. The song ""It's hard out here for a pimp"" very deservedly received in 2006 the Oscar for Best Song.

Even if I cannot really sympathise with the main character, this film completely broke through my defenses in the anthology scene in which DJay prepares for the fight of his life, like a knight going to tornament. I also liked the humour, which is of greatest quality, even if frequently laced with obscenity. The last joke in the film really made my laugh out loud.

This film reminded me of ""The Wire"" and also ""Set it off"", even if it is less violent and less tragic. The quality of the direction is just amazing. Even if this kind of films is not my usual poison, I liked ""Hustle and flow"" a lot and I probably will keep the DVD. A recommended viewing.",1463529600,,2036,4.509485094850948

It took me a little bit to really like this movie because it started out so down and in the end it turned out to be a feel-good movie even though he went to jail. I really like the music in this even though i don't particularly go out of my way to listen to it.

2420393,5,B000BITUWU,"DJay,played by Terrence Howard, is a pimp and drug dealer who is dissatisfied with his life and wants to make a change in Hustle And Flow. After acquiring a keyboard and reacquainting himself with an old friend from school,Key, played by Anthony Anderson,who has become a sound technician. Then,he decides to try making hip hop songs. Key and sound-mixer friend,Shelby,played by DJ Qualls coordinates with DJay put together several songs.

The group experiences many setbacks throughout the creative process. DJay must hustle those around him in order to procure proper equipment and recording time, and Key's relationship with his wife becomes strained. At the end of the film, in a bit of irony, sees a duo of prison guards who have their own rap group asking DJay to listen to their demo, much as DJay had approached Skinny Black. After the guards request him to listen to the demo, he accepts their tape and responds with the following: ""You know what they say, everybody gotta have a dream,"" which was the slogan for the film.

Hustle And Flow was a great independent drama film. Terrence Howard was exceptional as DJay. The screenplay by Craig Brewer was also great in trying to tell a story of a man who sought change in his life. His direction by was crisp as well. Highly recommended for viewers who seek themes about the welfare of disenfranchised people particularly African- Americans. Highly recommended indeed.",1431302400,,1424,4.953974895397489

EMPIRE is a breath-taking show and it is all thanks to HUSTLE N FLOW, the introduction to a reality we ALL pretend isn't real. to some people this movie {as well as the series) is simply entertainment... exhilarating entertainment ... but to some of us (more people then we think) it is REALITY it is our struggle. we all talk about music openly but prostitution... believe it or not is just as common..... we may not discuss it in common areas but it happens all around us. watch the movie... join the empire fan club and get educated on reality because this movie and it's series is F********* REALISTIC, AS REAL AS IT COMES
immigration. slavery. prostitution. etc. we all ignore it but this movie isn't about any of that, it's about the come up... the struggle, the war. a war every human faces. the war of reaching our dreams.",1426118400,,1189,4.5607476635514015

I recommend a buy.  You can pick it up for about $5, which is what I paid
at a local record store.
There's more to Memphis than Elvis, blues or barbecue.
Secret: a hidden extra.  Go to extras menu, at the bottom of the first
extras screen, scroll down to ""main menu"" and hit the right arrow key
on your remote; you will say a gold chain ""D Jay"" on Mr. Howard.

2420494,5,B000BITUWU,"Let me say for starters that I am a 64 year old granny and English. So............ hmmm not the type of movie I normally watch, and to be honest I don't remember the reason why we watched it in the first place. I was expecting a story about exploitation and maybe violence and incomprehensible dialog and horrid music. What I got was a beautiful move. Very funny, moving and overall inspirational.

OK so we have the pimp giving his girls a line to get them doing what he wants. His overblown connections are mostly in his imagination and he knows this is his life and it is going nowhere. Neither him or his girls appear to have anything but a very basic education or infrastructure of support. He sees someone from the 'old days' doing well and decides to try it out for himself - except of course he has no skills and no idea how to begin. Together with his girls he invades the home, marraige and life of an old school friend and draws him in together with a member of his church. A few dozen egg boxes, a bit of bartering in the form of a sexual act for a mic, a drug bribe to noisy neighbors and they are ready to go.

This is where it gets really good. No, I mean it this is where it turns brilliant. One of his heavily pregnant girls has a fab voice and a grammy winning song emerges. I don't want this to be a spoiler so I am not going to give this away but by the end we were almost jumping up and down and laughing and not wanting it to end. It is a movie about belief in oneself, love (the kissing scene is totally beautiful), and emergence. The friend and his wife's relationship is improved, and the blond hooker truly finds the power within. The acting is wonderful from everyone involved. There is no graphic sex and there is not much violence. Yes there is exploitation but even that has a role in the outcome of this movie. I regularly use clips from this movie in my college classes. Give it a go and if you hate it I am sorry - you have to have an open mind and watch it all.

But that nagging feeling I had leaving the theater was the uncomfortable parallel between Brewer himself and his lead character DJay. In much the same manner that DJay shamelessly exploits the women around him, Brewer exploits DJay's seedy Memphis underworld of drugs, guns, rap, pimping and prison to create this strangely audience-pleasing concoction. DJay, unfortunately, is no one to be admired.

2420507,3,B000BITUWU,"I kind of verbally destroyed this film when it first came out.  I thought it was stupid and generic and very `MTV' like and just all around over-hyped, over-praised and definitely over-nominated (Howard beating out Russell Crowe for that Oscar nomination stung like a knife to the gut).

The thing was, I didn't hate it, I just didn't get it.

Years later (got these years just fly by) and I have grown slightly fonder of this film, especially Howard (I still feel that Crowe would have made a better nominee, but I'm not that upset anymore about Howard getting the attention).  The film, in my opinion, is still kind of silly in parts and rather unbelievable (and this film is trying to be believable, so points deducted there), but it has heart and soul where it counts and so I have come around to appreciate this film a little more for what it `does' bring to the table.

The film tells the story of a pimp named DJay.  Basically, when DJay hears about a local rapper coming back around town for the 4th, he gets it in his head that if he puts his heart and soul on a demo tape and gets it to the rapper then he could find himself reaching fame.

Yeah, that's not going to happen.

I applaud the film for not taking the easy Hollywood clich&eacute;s (ala happy endings) here, but in the process they almost played contradiction in some areas.  Their development of DJay, for example, feels uneven.  Even though he has flourishes of selfishness (like an exploitation of Nola) he is depicted as far too civil and likable to be taken seriously as a thug.  I mean, he just doesn't have the grit needed to sell this role.  Yes, I understand they didn't want to deliver a stereotype, and I'm all for that.  No one needs to see yet another pimp/tyrant, but they needed to integrate the personality flaws a little better.  Without really developing DJay's vicious side (sure, he's manipulative, but he's far too subtle and sympathetic to be honest) his more outlandish actions (that bathroom scene) come across as unbelievable.  It kind of reminds me of Denzel Washington's performance in `American Gangster'.

But, in Howard's case I blame the script.  You can see the nuance in his performance, and you can see that he is working hard to elevate the material (and he does for the most part), but the script didn't come up to meet him half way.

I also feel like the overall construction of the film felt rather generic.  There just isn't anything that special about this film when all is said and done, unless by special you mean Taraji P. Henson.

Okay, let's talk about that kind of special.

Henson doesn't have a lot of screen time, but when she is there, you know it.  As the pregnant and opinionated Shug, Henson dominates the screen with her persona, but what is even more impressive is the way she allows the bent up frustration and pain to surface in the most unexpected of ways.  As she sings to hook to DJay's song you can see this bellowing intensity (subtle yet overpowering) as she feels the pain and hurt strip away from her to uncover an unfamiliar feeling of accomplished glee.

She is happy for the first time in forever.

In fact, if I can praise any aspect of this film it would be the cast.  I mean, Howard, Henson, Manning, Anderson, Ludacris; they all really work hard to elevate the film, and they all manage to make an impression.  That SAG ensemble nomination was not a fluke.  It was well, well deserved.

In the end I have grown to like this movie, and I would watch it again and I encourage you to watch it if you haven't, and if you have and felt it was not worth your time, I urge you to give it another shot.  I give it an enthusiastic C+ (I like that word, enthusiastic) because, while it is still kind of MTVish, it delivers in some unexpected and unforgettable ways.",1267056000,,3799,4.487627365356623

2420509,5,B000BITUWU,"DJay, a streetwise Memphis hustler tries to find a voice and realize his long-buried dreams. Though DJay has always had a way with words, that gift has long been misused; this philosopher-hustler lives a dead-end life at the fringes of society. Anything more feels out of reach. Still, DJay wonders what happened to all the big dreams he had for his life. A chance encounter with an old friend, Key, a sound engineer who has always wanted to make it in the music business, spurs DJay: if he's ever going to make his mark, it has to happen now. This movie celebrates art, hope, and dreams, and you don't have to like hip-hop to appreciate the message or the way in which it is delivered.",1262736000,,686,4.496

2420512,4,B000BITUWU,"I would give this DVD five stars for the actors, and stunning performances. I selected Hustle and Flow to see Taraji P. Henson's performance, and she was great as Shug. Terrence Howard was phenomenal as  Djay. Anthony Anderson brings a lot of heart to his role, and DJ Squal added even more humor into the mix. I'm not sure about Tryn Manning. She fell short on complexity of character, though in the end, she does get to have her dopey say, though most of the credit would go to the film editors. I'll say her hair stylist and costumer did an excellent job..  A huge perk was Issac Hayes' appearance as Arnel.

Unfortunately, the character themes would be: Pimps are just doing what life sets down before them; prostitutes are ridiculous, ultimately have hearts of gold, and are still, at the end of the day, glam; tricks are the same old slobs that they always were; and gangsta rappers are gun totin' roustabouts. Nothing new, fresh or realistic here.

The script and direction of the film are ... interesting but didn't leave me with much viewer satisfaction. The action in Hustle and Flow was predictable, at best.

Don't get me wrong. Hustle and Flow is worth watching in spite of its flaws. In addition to the excellent acting, this film has great hair styles, costumes, locations, and cars to set the scene and the ambiance. The song `It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp/Whoop that Trick"" won the 2006 Oscar - Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures, Original Song, so there you have it.",1250553600,,1503,4.635338345864661
2420513,1,B000BITUWU,"The fact that this movie have such a high review is sort of scary; because it proves how stupid and ignorant a vast majority of people truly are. The main character is a Pimp who manipulates and mistreats everyone for his own interest.
To this pimp, a microphone is worth more than a young woman's integrity.
How in the world am I suppose to sympathize with that?  I had realized that the poorer and less educated people are, the worst and worst they take responsibility for themselves and their community and this movie is a classic example of it. I put up with a lot of crap lately from Hollywood, they threw stupid movies in my face like Hellboy, Kill Bill, Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift and the list goes on. But this pure garbage of a movie, I simply cannot and will not tolerate. Giving it one start was too much already, I wish I can give it .2 starts.

I think  ""cartoonish"" is the best adjective I can come up with.  ""Corny"" is about right...  I know a lot of people, whose opinions I respect, who like this movie - and I did find it entertaining - but I'd be really surprised to see anyone defending it a few years down the line.  The story, dialogue, acting: all pretty silly, but it is an entertaining ""party movie"" (once you realize that it's a cartoon).  My advice is to expect some light-hearted laughs (and maybe that was my misstep, expecting to take this movie seriously.)  Sorry to be mean, but I think the money's been made, etc.  Disclaimer: I don't get a few things that everyone seems to dig, like the band REM, for example.",1249689600,,890,4.378048780487805
2420515,1,B000BITUWU,"This film does has some creative juices. But its soul is dark. It celebrates evil. But not like ""Natural Born Killers"" or a Manson or crazy war movie. You sense a real determination to ""sell"" the idea of the pimp as a a normal, acceptable community member, and THAT is what is HORRIBLE, and ultimately SO INSULTING TO BLACKS.
A pimp - who is a predator of the soul, uses a woman to sell her sex, helping her to forsake her pride, self-respect and independence in order to seek approval (love) from the man within this sick pimp-prostitute syndrome. This portrays the pimp like the hero. To widen his aura of acceptability in this role, Jesus is brought in to be made irrelevant and spit on as well. Two church-goers are enamored by the pimp's music and are 'won over' without the slightest objection to what the pimp DOES in life. Maybe the church is run by Reverend Wright.

2420528,5,B000BITUWU,"Hustle & Flow, is a 2005 movie that caught a lot of attention at Sundance by winning the Audience Award and a closet full of other awards that topped off with Oscar nominations for lead actor Terrance Howard and a win for Three 6 Mafia for Best Original Song ""It's hard out here for a pimp""(it works in the film, trust me).  The film is the story of Djay, played by Howard, a low rent pimp and drug dealer in Memphis, Tennessee who is suffering from his own existence.  He lives with three women, one who is pregnant, another who is a stripper, and the other a girl he pimps out in the back alleys of Memphis.  His side duplex is crowded with the baby boy belonging to the stripper and no air conditioning.  While delivering some weed to local bar owner Arnel (Issac Hayes), he learns that local rapper turned super star, Skinny Black (Chris `Ludacris' Bridges) is coming in for a 4th of July party and Arnel wants Djay to supply him with the ""good"" weed for this party.  Djay begins to see parallels between his life and Skinny's and where their paths diverged, placing Skinny in the lap of luxury and Djay in the hood.  A chance meeting with an old high school classemate (Anthony Anderson) who is a local music producer and a drug addict that trades a child's keyboard for drugs, gives Djay the idea for a hustle to put on Skinny and hopefully break out of his current existence.

Hustle & Flow is about a world very few of us can imagine or want to live.  Terrance Howard's Djay is a lowly person who pimps women for $20 a trick and takes what he can off Lexus, the stripper (played masterfully by Paula Jai Parker).  Like Michael Cain's Carter, Howard's Djay doesn't let anything stop his hustle of Skinny.  He lies, uses Nola (Taryn Manning), his girl in the car, and violence to make his dream come true.  The level that this film works on is brilliant.  Every time you begin to root for Djay, he does a despicable act to make you hate him again and then they being to rebuild his reputation for you again, only to tear it down again.

Probably one of the best parts of the film is the use of Skinny Black.  Much like Orson Well's Harry Lime in The Third Man, Skinny is a mythical character, taking on whatever persona is given to him by characters and scenes in the film.  When he finally does appear, you half expect him to be glowing with angelic aura and ooze coolness.  Like Well's Harry Lime, Ludacris' Skinny isn't the man you think he is and ends up getting a comeuppance that will make you squirm.

Hustle is a rap song with back story.  It is a tough movie that makes no apologies for what it is or what it shows (though nothing is grotesque or gratuitous) to the audience.  Its sound track is amazing and Terrance Howard is a man on the move in Hollywood with his upcoming role in Marvel's Iron Man and his inspired performance in the Oscar surprise Crash.",1195084800,,2874,4.358348968105066

2420533,1,B000BITUWU,"I saw this on DVD (from the library, thank goodness). This is grossly overrated exploitation junk. Can't get with it!

This film expects the audience to have pity on Terrence Howard as a pimp named DJay who aspires to be a rapper. First of all, the character is about 35 years old, a bit old to start off as a rapper. Secondly, we see him doing things like (literally) throwing a prostitute AND HER BABY out of his house, forcing a teenage prostitute to have sex with an elderly music store owner to get a microphone he can't afford, and generally using and manipulating everyone around him.

Then he tries to get over by making such lovely, creative masterpieces of art as ""It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp"" and ""Whip That Trick"" which both of his prostitutes gleefully dance to the beat of their own destruction.

No thanks, y'all. 30 years ago, the ""blaxploitation"" trashterpiece films corrupted too many ignorant and guidance-deprived youths of that generation into thinking that it was cool to be a pimp or a drug dealer. Their children the gangster rappers have done enough damage in recent years without films like this to deceive the young and ignorant. The people who push trash like this are the REAL pimps and I have no love for this! Farmers, show this to your cows to produce more fertilizer!",1185667200,,1302,4.627705627705628

It was only a matter of time before a movie like this was made and I'm glad it was and I'm glad I gave it a chance.  One of the most moving parts of this film was when they asked the girl with the baby who was kind of just in the background to help sing a line over their beats.  Turns out she can not only sing but DJay sees something in her that convinces him to give up any other woman he might get from future fame for her.

2420538,5,B000BITUWU,"I was a little apprehensive about this film because I'm not keen on anything that either glamorizes or tries to legitimize anything as heinous or disgusting as pimping, but being a Terrence Howard fan and taking into account his best actor nomination, I put all pre-conceived notions aside and watched it.  The movie blew me away.  This is very much a universal film in that, ultimately, it's about our hopes and our need to create something extraordinary as a testament of our sojourn here.  Realizing that he is the same age as his father when he passed away, low level pimp and drug dealer DJay decides, with the help of an old school buddy, now gospel producer, to pursue his long-time ambition of becoming a rapper, following in the footsteps of local-guy-made-good Skinny Black (played by Ludacris).  What made this a very moving experience was that Craig Brewer didn't attempt to either praise nor condemn his characters but rather create wholly credible people, warts and all, that resonate within everyone because, in the end, it's about wanting to better yourself, to realize a dream, to achieve something extraordinary, to be respected and to leave your mark on the world, regardless of how insignificant it may seem to everyone else.  None of these characters may come across as necessarily likeable but dang if they aren't believable and it's due to that that their personal trials and misgivings impact the viewer.  The character of Nola was, for me, the living, heartbreaking embodiment of lost youth, desperation and wasted innocence; a person knowing they were meant for greater things but not knowing what that is and how to escape the drudgery of her existence and be part of something special.  We see how she practically glows with self-confidence when in her small way she contributes to DJay's dreams.  Terrence Howard delivers a nuanced, heartfelt and eloquent performance as DJay, with Taryn Manning as Nola, bringing a profound humanity to a country girl caught in her own life. Taraji Henson is perfect as Shug, a weary yet confident reflection of D Jay's dreams and Paula Jai Parker is equally impressive as Lexus, the walking manifestation of bitterness and resentment, throwing her vitriol in the face of everyone's hopes. Anthony Anderson and D.J. Qualls round out the cast, as long time buddy/producer and a skinny white boy with rhythm and dreams of his own to spare, respectively.",1167868800,,2414,4.987562189054726

2420541,5,B000BITUWU,"""Hustle and Flow"" - ostensibly about a small-time pimp in Memphis, Tennessee - is actually a brilliant dissection of and meditation on the creative process.  Be prepared to be delighted by this film.  Everything about it is top-notch, from Craig Brewer's off-the-charts-good script and direction, to Terrence Howard's award-winning and award-deserving acting, to the great music.  An added treat is seeing actors like Anthony Anderson and DJ Qualls - heretofore known for their appearances in broad comedies - shine in dramatic roles.  Anderson, in particular, is fantastic here.  As Brewer notes in the ""Making Of"" featurette, it's Anderson's role whose relative 'normalcy' is our tie to the film.  He's a believable and likable character.  We want to see him succeed.  It's also worth noting:  Chris Bridges (Ludicris) is a very good actor.  Some will say ""he's playing himself.""  I disagree.  The pivotal scene in the movie - the one where he and Howard's character meet - has good acting on both sides of the table.

The core of the movie is that we get to see - in amazingly rich detail - the process that leads to the creation of a couple of songs.  When you see the movie, you'll understand why ""Hard Out There For a Pimp"" won an Academy Award for Best Song.  It's because it's not simply part of a soundtrack.  Rather, the tale of its creation is the very soul of the film.

""Hustle"" is also one of those rare cases where the extras measure up to the movie itself.  Brewer's insights on what the movie is about and his life experiences that went into it are fascinating.  Co-producers Stephanie Allain and John Singleton's commentary on getting the movie made are equally compelling.",1164585600,,1691,4.829268292682927

Brewer did an excellent job with the soundtrack which featured memorable sounds of the present and future south sound. Terrence Howard is amazing and even raps his own tunes!

Let me get this straight, people really appreciated and LIKED a movie about a ""low budget"" pimp who was ""tricking"" a girl so that he could achieve his ""dream"" of being a ""rap star"". Now the actors did the best that they could with what they had, but it still only merits a .5 and I am STRETCHING the 1 star....really I am. Now back to the ""complicated"" plot....the girl he has been pimping (she sleeps with a loser at a pawn shop to get her pimp a microphone) ends up becoming a ""business woman"" (she sleeps with a disc jokey to have her imprisoned pimps music played on the air). There was a scene that I found to be very entertaining. One character staples fast food cup holders to the wall to make it sound proof so the pimp can have a STUDIO. Yeah..right. DUMB! There were so many dumb parts in this movie, I lost track of them all.

On top of being dumb, one of the actresses (the pregnant one who was standing by her ""pimp/man"" while he is in jail for beating up another ""rap star"" who dissed him...that's right..the plot becomes way complicated...and Dumber..wait is that a word) comes out of this whole experience thinking she can ""really sing"" in real life and sang it at the Oscars last year. And still...I am wondering what planet I am on, because they gave the stupid song an Oscar for best movie. Maybe I dreamed all that, or maybe I just don't know what a good movie is about!

Call me naive but is pimping still actually going on in Memphis, Tennessee in this day and time? And did Terrance Howard give Ludacris' character a cassette tape to listen to? Not a CD, a tape. I probably would have flushed it down the toilet too. And the hook to that song, ""You know it's hard out here for a pimp."" Ya think? With prostitution being illegal in the state of Tennessee and all. I found myself cringing and sliding down in my seat in the theatre when she began to sing because I was so embarrassed.

By the tight screenplay, the professional direction, and the phenomenal acting. It is not a film for children. It is not a film meant to portray ideal role models for children. It is a film meant to realistically depict the lives of people who live at the very bottom of America's socioeconomic ladder. If you find yourself unable to reserve judgment against people born into a life so vastly different than your own, you will probably not like this film. In order to appreciate it, you have to be able to see past the moral and ethical ambiguities of these characters.

So if anyone feels unsure whether they can handle the ugliness of this type of world, but still feels curious enough to see it, take a cue from the Anthropologists... When studying a culture vastly different than your own, make sure to leave the rights and wrongs of your society at home. Because once you impose the moral judgment and ethical standards of your world upon another's, you've sacrificed your objectivity. And by doing so, miss the very point of empathy.

American's love to feel sympthy these scumbags. That's the bottomline. It's nothing new. Back in the days of Ted Bundy crazy american women would send him letters saying how much they love him and stuff like that.

American's are still in this way of thinking. Being poor doesn't mean you can throw dignity, class, and human morals out the widow. Lots of people have been poor since the start of time.
it's apart of life... But for some reason, when blacks from the streets it's never their fault.

It's the system, white people, racism. blah blah blah

Blacks are never to be held with blame these days. If black men would be fathers to their children they'd probably see the ghetto's improve. From what I hear, very few black women are married... Which is one sign black men are having children and not supporting them.

This goes for any race... If a child grows up without a father he /she is ALOT more likely to commit crimes. Being that such a high percentage of black men end up in jail, it's obvious they can't do their job as a father... Which in turn leads their children to repeat the same process.

I don't mind saying it on record that I hold nothing but contempt for the men who live off the earnings of the women they exploit.

But I'm a huge fan of Terrence Howard and had heard that the movie had won the Audience Award at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival and was even Oscar nominated (for best actor in a leading role and best original song). As we all now know, Terrence lost out on the former to Philip Seymour Hoffman but ""It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp"" shocked many by taking the golden statuette.

I decided to buy the DVD in the end because the movie didn't screen in my area, as far as I was aware, and my local video store wasn't holding it.

Well, I'm pleased to say I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I'm really glad I bought it and look forward to watching it over and over again. I guess, as with the last movie I reviewed here, it just goes to show how a good script, good direction and good acting can make good art out of any story, infuse it with humanity and move us.

Yes, it's true, Djay is a pimp but he seems to be a pimp with heart. He not only takes care of his girls, he actually seems to care about them. They definitely care about him, especially the lovely Nola (played by Taryn Manning) who takes care of business when Djay finds himself behind bars, and ensures that his dream of becoming a successful rapper is kept alive and well. The story, probably from start to end was pretty predictable but thoroughly entertaining nevertheless. Howard brings complexity and magnetism to what could've been a cardboard cut-out role.

Good support from the always watchable Anthony Anderson and D.J. Qualls was mouth open wide astounding. I'd never even heard of him before this movie but will be looking out for him now.

And to round it all off the movie has a banging soundtrack. I may be a bit late but I'm definitely beginning to feel southern hip-hop. ""It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp"" deserved the Academy Award it won. The soundtrack CD is already on my wish list.

From that point he is head on into the life of a rap star.  No flash, no charisma, just good music.  I really like all the characters in this one.  The prostitutes are perfect for the roles, and I liked the white mixmaster.  He was funny in ""Road Trip"" and ""The New Guy"" and great here as well!

HUSTLE & FLOW is a quite simple (and even silly) story, but because it also ends up being a sweet one, I was willing to forgive its faults. Terrence Howard certainly did his homework preparing for his role; his Memphis patois and small-timer pimp demeanor seemed dead-on.

Where this film really excels is in its depiction of Southern poverty; the trashy neighborhoods, listless manner, and oppressive humidity (the characters almost always seem to be sweating) make the tableaus very convincing. So when HUSTLE & FLOW starts winding towards its not-very-realistic conclusion, the viewer can draws on the good will the film has built up to just let it slide... or flow.

2420556,5,B000BITUWU,"I have a taste for Ozzy, Aerosmith and Metallica's music. When some friends popped this movie into the DVD player, I rolled my eyes and groaned in silence. I wasn't really in the mood for a cookie-cutter 'hood' movie - you know the ones loaded with stereotype thugs, drive by shootings, flashy cars and plenty of bling. However, you learn from the first scene that DJay's character was not a 'cliche pimp'. As this movie progressed, I grew more impressed with the down to earth story of people just trying to pay the rent and...like everyone else...struggling to find a future. The acting was rich throughout and the unexpected drama that unfolds tears at your heart because of the hope and attachment you build with all of the supporting characters.

*** Spoiler Alert ***

My favorite scene was the look in Shug's eyes when she first heard her recorded voice, to me that was the instance when the dream became tangible. There were several other favorites to include Nola's understanding with DJay when she admits that she knows when she is being manipulated but sometimes she needs it, the 'soul kiss' (as the director calls it in the commentaries) that DJay gives to Shug before his bold move to promote his demo tape to Skinny Black and then the sinking feeling when DJay sees what Skinny ends up doing with his demo tape. The depth with which Terrence Howard showed DJay's character was tremendous. I'm not going to start playing 'crunk' at home just yet, but the movie definitely holds my respect. I have since bought the DVD for my own collection and have watched it again several times. Good choice for any music lover, regardless of your preference...and definitely don't judge a DVD by it's cover, it had me fooled at first. It was hard giving this one a 5, but a 4 didn't give it enough credit.",1149984000,,1805,4.655172413793103
2420557,3,B000BITUWU,"There is much that is good about Hustle & Flow.  First and foremost, it solidly establishes Terrence Howard as a matinee idol.  Not only does he have movie star good looks and an inherently soulful persona certain to build empathy, he's demonstrated an uncanny ability to submerge himself in a role and create characters from the inside out.  Compare performances in Crash, Lackawanna Blues, and Hustle & Flow for an idea of his range.  Better still, his excellent performance is surrounded by some terrific supporting players.  Taryn Manning is winning as Nola, Djay's ""franchise"" performer, and Anthony Anderson is credible as Key, his friend and producer.  Special mention must be made of Taraji P. Henson; her Shug is well realized, believable, and sympathetic. The pickin's get a little slimmer after that, although it's always nice to see Isaac Hayes being Isaac Hayes, which is no small accomplishment.

But good acting alone will not save a bad film, and the problems with Hustle & Flow stem from the story and primary character.  Djay is a pimp who aspires to rap stardom, in this respect the film is an inverted American dream saga of downward mobility since the only life form lower than a pimp, (excluding lawyers), is rap ""musician.""  Some see intelligence in Djay; I was more struck by his incompetence.  Indeed, when we meet him, he appears to be ""the pimp that couldn't slap straight.""  When one of his employees practically begs him to hit her all he can do is look inadequate.  His lyrics, (especially the unintentionally ironic - ""It's hard out there for a pimp"" - as if anyone would feel sympathy for this most parasitic of all beings), are unconvincing in addition to being ugly and vulgar.  This is perhaps the real problem with Hustle & Flow; the only route out of street life appears to be by glorifying it.

Rap outsiders will find the studio scenes instructional as they learn that the ""music,"" such as it is, is churned out by digital boxes crammed full of stored samples.  Thus, the skill level required to produce this dreck is just above zero, the machine does the work.  Though promising through the second act, riding on Howard's great performance, Hustle & Flow collapses in act three and falls on its face amidst a heap of gangsta rap cliches.  The miraculous transformation of Nola, from street ho to power-suit music promoter, is a piece of deus ex machina Hollywood nonsense that should make writer/director Craig Brewer deeply ashamed.  But then, the ho with the golden heart is a tried-and-true bit of preposterous mythology that's worked for a long time, Pretty Woman made some money from it.  Hustle & Flow is the best movie about rap ever made, I only wish that wasn't damning it with faint praise.",1149897600,,2740,4.816239316239316
2420558,5,B000BITUWU,"We all think we know about pimps.  They're bad guys.  Right?

Well, not exactly.

Hustle and Flow is one of those films that takes all our preconceived notions and turns them upside down.  No wonder Terrance Howard, who's cast as a Dijay, a Memphis small-time pimp. He and his women live in a run-down house in Memphis and he doesn't make big bucks or drive a nice car. Just like everyone else, he struggles to stay alive.  But he has a dream. He wants to be a rap singer.  At first I thought this would be a predictible story.  I was wrong.  And I must admire the screenwriter/director Craig Brewer for bringing this very real story to the screen, resulting in an Academy Award for the music and a nomination for best actor for Terrance Howard.

The cast of characters is great.  The three women in his life are very very real.  There's the pretty white girl who can't see a way out of her life, the pregnant woman who loves him and is full of fear, the sassy stripper with the young child who is angry all the time.  Their relationships with each other and with their pimp are complex and human.  And then there is his friend, Key, who's a churchgoer and whose wife works as a supervisor in a department store.  They lead a very middle class life.  But when Key starts to help Djay record a demo, his comfortable marriage is thrown into chaos. Rounding out the cast of people helping to produce the demo is a skinny white guy, DJ Qualls, who's an expert in the technical aspects of recording and who loves to get high all the time.

Finally the demo is ready and Djay tries to get a former acquaintance help him out.  The rap star Ludicrous is cast in this role which calls for him to be an actor as well as a musician.  How this all plays out is unexpected and violent.  The human drama almost spins out of control.

But because Djay is who he is, and because the people in his life are who they are, the ending does not end in what could have been a tragedy.

I loved this film.  It put me in Djay's world and I felt I was right there with them all in Memphis, living these characters' lives and experiencing their emotions.  This is defiantly movie to see.",1148774400,,2161,4.279012345679012

The story is about a pimp named DJ.  DJ is not a typical pimp who beats his girls and raps about it.  He does babysitting duty and tries to have philosophical discussions with them.  Of course he is not perfect, as we will see.  Two of his three girls are sweet, one is abrasive.  Nola is a shy country girl who suffers from low self-esteem and depression.  Shug (Sugar) is eight months pregnant by an unknown john.  DJ runs into Key (Anthony Anderson), an old high school friend.  They start to make a rap demo, to the dismay of Yevette, Key's wife.

We can see that this dream means everything to DJ and Key.  The fibres of their heart and soul are tied to this project.  How his little ""family"" becomes involved is great.  You end up holding your breath for all of these characters.  I cried twice; that is how moving the story is.  Don't waste another second - add this film to your collection.  One of the finest and most human stories I have ever seen.",1148256000,,1390,4.236641221374046
2420561,4,B000BITUWU,"Yes, this movie has some pretty glaring contrivances and a bit of melodrama, coincidence and improbability in its story, but it also has the moving and heartfelt performance of Terrence Howard that, for me, overrides whatever other deficiencies the film may have.  Howard is one of those actors who wears his heart and soul on his sleeve, and from what I've seen of how he imbues a character with depth both here and in a quite different role in Crash, I anticipate great things from him in the future.  He strikes me as a deeply honest man and actor.

So, even though a movie about a pimp trying to better himself through rap music might not have been high on my list of must-sees Terrence Howard made me care about the struggle of this particular pimp and his ""family"" and I even liked the music they produced, although hip-hop/rap would likewise not be high on my list of must-hears.

Any performance and film that takes me out of my pre-conceived notions earns my respect and gratitude. It was worth my time.",1147824000,,1012,4.574585635359116

I guess my southern California ears couldn't discern any sense from their extremely heavy ghetto Memphis accent. I also did not understand the society in which they lived. I am not familiar with the workings of pimp and ho commerce and infrastructure.

Despite these shortcomings, I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie. The thing I found surprising was that it was pretty funny. It was interesting to watch. D Jay's hos, Sug and the blonde one (I forgot her name) were surprisingly endearing and sweet.",1147564800,,645,4.657894736842105
2420563,3,B000BITUWU,"Terrance Howard earned a well-deserved Best Actor nomination for his strong performance in ""Hustle and Flow,"" a modern urban fairy tale about a two-bit drug dealer and pimp who dreams of making something better of his life.  ""D-Jay,"" a singer/songwriter who long ago gave up his ambition of hitting it big in the music business, barely ekes out a living selling dope and pimping cheap hookers in his rundown Memphis neighborhood.  Lately, he's been suffering from what he himself calls a ""mid life crisis,"" as the realization has begun to dawn on him that his life is going nowhere fast.  By chance, he runs into a high school acquaintance with some recording equipment who agrees to hook up with him and start cutting some records.  But will D-Jay be able to break into an industry that seems closed to all but a select few hardworking and lucky enough to break down the doors?

Although Howard hits all the right notes in his performance, the movie itself is never quite as good as he is in it.  As written and directed by Craig Brewer, the film lacks the authenticity and grit that a sturdier, more seasoned hand (a Spike Lee, for instance) might have brought to it.  The scenes often have an air of contrivance about them, as if Brewer didn't trust the audience to get the meaning without his spelling it all out for us.  The storyline often veers dangerously close to melodrama (as in D-Jay's encounter with a big star hip-hop artist) and the dialogue often has that overly explicit, self-revelatory quality that makes it sound forced, unconvincing and phony.  Moreover, with the exception of Howard, the acting is woefully uneven and even downright amateurish at times.  One admires what Brewer is trying to do in the film - providing a sort of upbeat antidote to all the downbeat urban black dramas we are always being subjected to these days - but ""Hustle and Flow"" never manages to convince us of its own authenticity.

Still, the movie is worth checking out for Howard's acting, which is indeed rich, varied and amazingly subtle at times, and for some nice moments of emotion and insight scattered along the way.",1146873600,,2122,4.739130434782608
2420564,5,B000BITUWU,"Before I start in on this review, I think I need to make a few things clear: 1) I don't watch MTV, and 2) I don't like rap music. Hopefully that will help put things in perspective for those who choose to read this because this isn't a tale about a rapper nor about music; it's the story of never giving up on one's dreams, a universal theme that takes on an entirely new scope in writer/director Craig Brewer's excellent film HUSTLE AND FLOW.

I didn't much care for BOYZ IN THE HOOD and I felt that 8-MILE was over-hyped, so I was hesitant to watch something with a similar sounding theme. But my worries were unfounded. Although what you've probably heard is true (""It's the story of a pimp and his whores""), chances are you're only getting a snapshot glimpse of this amazing character film by listening to such a basic definition.

Terrence Howard plays D'Jay the pimp, a good pimp, struggling to make ends meet by employing three women in his ""crib"". But a chance encounter with a music mixer whom he used to go to school with lifts his spirits and makes him feel as if he's having a mid-life crisis. D'Jay's attempts to cut his own music consume him, even to the point of using one of his employees' skills to obtain a $250 microphone (sparking off a rather heated exchange, I might add).

The fact that the story takes place in Memphis added a genuine sense of realism to the film, too (from the down-and-out neighborhoods and on-location shoots near bridges and underpasses).

The actors - without exception - reached deep down into themselves and pulled up some of the finest performances of 2005. Every single actor in the movie LIVED those roles. All of the Oscar nominated films in 2005 (although this one wasn't nominated for Best Picture) held a valid message, and I absolutely loved how different yet similar they were. GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, CAPOTE, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, CRASH and MUNICH all had amazing historical or cultural aspects littered throughout them, and HUSTLE AND FLOW is no exception; why it wasn't nominated in the Best Picture category ahead of MUNICH is a mystery to me, though.

Never giving up on your dreams (""By any means necessary"") is both the message of the film and of the film-makers. Watching the extra features on the DVD, I learned that the producers shopped around Hollywood for financial backing but couldn't find any. Year after year and studio after studio, they got turned down. So, in the spirit of ""let's go and do it ourselves"", they put their own money forward (a measly $8 million sunk into it from pre- to post-production).

If you haven't seen this movie just because of what you've heard, you're cheating yourself out of an excellent night of entertainment. Just remember, you don't have to be young to enjoy the themes talked about here. This is dreaming at its ugliest and its best. And I still don't like rap music, but I may be buying the music track to this film.",1145577600,,2927,4.619230769230769
2420565,5,B000BITUWU,"Hustle And Flow is a brilliant movie produced by John Singleton (Boys N The Hood), and starring Terrence Howard (Crash), Taryn Manning (A Lot Like Love), DJ Qualls (Road Trip), Anthony Anderson (Scary Movie 3), and rapper Ludacris (Crash).

Terrence Howard plays a down-on-his-luck and desperate mid-aged Memphis pimp Djay who wants a way out of his crooked life by becoming an aspiring rapper. He gets inspiration from his favorite girl Nora, played by Manning, and help to record a demo in his broken down home from another one of his girls, a pregnant woman with a soulful voice, and local sound mixers and technicians, played by Anderson and Qualls. He finds out that local rap star Skinny Black, played by real life rap star Ludacris, is coming to town so he sets up a plan to meet him, give him his demo tape, and make it to the big time.

Hustle And Flow succeeds in engaging the audience with its main character's dilemma. And it is, of course, the once secondary role playing, now A-list actor Terrence Howard who is the driving force behind one of the best movies of 2005.

The movie features an outstanding soundtrack, including the Oscar winning song Hard Out Here For A Pimp.

2420567,5,B000BITUWU,"I'm not much of a rap fan but I picked this one up on a lark after hearing some of the good things that have been said lately about Terrence Howard. I can honestly say it is one of the best movies I've seen in a while and I think Howard is on his way to becoming a top-tier Hollywood actor.

The story centers on a pimp and drug dealer named Djay, played by Howard. Djay is sleepwalking his way through life until fate taps him on the shoulder. He is given an old Casio keyboard for a dime bag of pot and he runs into an old buddy of his who is now a recording studio technician. The two things light a spark in Djay and he decides to take a shot at being a rapper. Using egg boxes to soundproof a room in his rundown house and using his whores for backup singers, Djay creates magic.

The movie manages to make a pimp into a sympathetic character, which is an accomplishment on its own right. But the movie isn't really about pimps any more than it's about whores or drug dealers. In fact, it's not even about black or white. The only two white characters in the movie are one of Djay's whores and a geeky keyboards guy and they are both shown in a fairly positive light. The movie is about realizing one's dreams and how the drive to do can bring meaning to even the most dismal situation.

My wife was apprehensive about my rave, but after watching the film with me, agreed - this is not a film full of gratuitous sex/violence/vulgarity. It goes far beyond the urban ""pimps & hos"" stereotype. This is a real-life, gritty, compelling story. Full of humor and compassion, there are moments of pure exhileration. You wind up rooting for all of these characters, cheering them on as they chase their dreams.

2420576,5,B000BITUWU,"Terrence Howard did wonders with this movie - Rap is not a subculture. It may be the only oral history of the african american community that will be available 50 years from now.

Will rap be like that - guess not but it will be like blue grass - it will talk about the struggles of a class within a society deeply divided by color.

Coming Through Slaughter  was a book written by Michael Ondaatje and this is almost the visual version of that book -

just with a more happy ending. I had the same feeling like I had when I was listening to music sitting in the floor of the preservation hall in New Orleans.

2420577,5,B000BITUWU,"In ""Hustle & Flow,"" Terrence Howard plays a pimp and pusher named Djay.  The fact Howard has been nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor gives you some indication that Djay is not your ordinary pimp and pusher.  There is not going to be an argument that Djay is a noble figure, but there is a certainly nobility is his desire to come up with a better life and he does have a certain rhetorical flair and even eloquence when he is not spouting the rap lyrics he has written down in his little notebook.  Howard's performance, which is as memorable as anything you have seen in the past year, is certainly a major part of what makes the character compelling, but writer-director Craig Brewer (""The Poor and the Hungry"") gets credit as well.

So, as our story begins Djay has come to the conclusion that there are better things to be in this world than a pimp.  Skinny Black (Ludacris), a big rap star, is coming back to his Memphis hood to visit where he got his start at a club run by Arnel (Isaac Hayes).  Djay thinks that all he has to do is put his demo tape in the hands of Skinny Black and that will be enough to make him a star.  But before that happens Djay has to make the demo tape.  So he gets his hands on a digital keyboard and works out some stuff to play for Key (Anthony Anderson), who usually records church music but knows Shelby (DJ Qualls), who knows enough about rap music to at least make that part sound good.  So Key staples cardboard egg containers to the walls of Djay's dining room to make a do-it-yourself soundproof recording studio, and try to see if Djay has any lyrics that could actually be played on the radio.  Fortunately Shug (Taraji P. Henson) the hooker comes up with the hook for the song, which becomes ""It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp.""  Whatever else happens tomorrow night at the Academy Awards, the performance of this nominated song is going to present some interesting problems, to say the least.

There is a key moment in ""Hustle & Flow"" when Djay discovers that the microphones are picking up the sound coming from a neighbor's house.  Djay has to go over and ask nicely for some consideration, which proves that he is willing to do whatever it takes to make his dream come true.  However, he proves the same thing when he needs to get his hands on some decent microphones and he uses Nola (Taryn Manning), as a human ATM, which she finds objectionable to his surprise.  For every step forward towards his dream there seems to be one backwards.  Is he making progress towards his dream or is everything a just a cruel illusion before his life bottoms out?

Despite the rampant political incorrectness and obscenity of his lyrics, the creation of Djay's rap song is compelling and dare I say infectious (if you find yourself standing up and waving your arm around while chanting ""Whomp that trick,"" do not be surprised).  The other big moment comes when Djay discovers that making the demo tape is only half the battle, because he still has to get it into the hands of Skinny Black.  The man has skills, but such things might not matter in the world he lives in, let alone the one he is trying to enter.  As Djay says in a sober moment of clarity, ""I'm here trying to squeeze a dollar out of a dime, and I ain't even got a cent man.""

""Hustle & Flow"" deserves to be remembered for more than Howard's performance and the Oscar nominated song with the dirtiest lyrics of all-time, but those will be the focal points.  The film is Howard's star turn and the situation is somewhat reminiscent of when Morgan Freeman was nominated for ""Street Smart,"" although it is hard to imagine Howard or anyone going to on a career that sees them playing the President and God as Freeman has done.  But Howard also has a strong performance in ""Crash"" under his belt this past year and has clearly moved up the Hollywood list and is going to stay there (Howard will not win tomorrow night, but in a year where three of the nominees are doing famous real people and the other's role is based on what he does not say, this is the standout performance).  The subject matter of this film will be enough to deter many from ever seeing it (to wit, my wife), but those who do will find it memorable.",1141430400,,4217,4.404639175257732
2420578,5,B000BITUWU,"Initially, I had little desire to watch this film at the theatre, because I am not a big fan of rap music. It's my curiosity to see if Terence Howard is really Oscar-worthy in this film, and I am truly captivated by his riveting performance. His portrayal of a down and out pimp aspired to become a rap musician is very convincing. This is a great film for him to show his most dramatic side and it's a good chance to allow him to do some rap singing. Got to love the theme song he performed in one of the climatic scenes. This film is straight-forward, and it's got heart and soul. The supporting players all contributed great performances to make this film more watchable. I was especially like Taryn Manning who played th hooker who had grown tired of turnig tricks and eventually helped Djay(Howard) launch his career.

2420579,5,B000BITUWU,"Sometimes you never really see an actor until the right roles bring him into focus. Terrence Howard has made 22 movies and a lot of TV (most notably the series ""Sparks""), but now in ""Crash"" and ""Hustle & Flow,"" he creates such clearly-seen characters in such different worlds that his range and depth becomes unmistakable.

In ""Crash,"" he was the successful Hollywood television director, humiliated when his wife is assaulted by a cop. In ""Hustle & Flow,"" he plays a Memphis pimp and drug dealer who yearns to make something of himself -- to become a rap artist. His quest for success is seen so clearly and with such sympathy by writer-director Craig Brewer that the movie transcends the crime genre and becomes powerful drama.

The movie's first achievement is to immerse us in the daily world of Djay, Howard's character. He is not a ""pimp"" and a ""drug dealer"" as those occupations have been simplified and dramatized in pop culture. He is a focused young man, intelligent, who in another world with other opportunities might have, who knows, gone to college and run for Congress. He can improvise at length on philosophical subjects, as he proves in an opening scene about -- well, about no less than the nature of man.

He has a childhood friend named Skinny Black (Ludacris), who has become a millionaire rap star. How close of a childhood friend is a good question; as nearly as I can tell, they went to different schools together. Skinny Black returns to the old neighborhood every Fourth of July for a sentimental reunion at the club where he got his start. The club owner (Isaac Hayes) is a friend of Djay's. The theory is, Djay will give his demo tape to Skinny Black, who will pull strings and make Djay a star.

But that's in the third act of the movie. The long second act, in some ways the heart of the film, involves Djay's attempts to meet his various business responsibilities while recording the demo. We get the ghetto version of renting the old barn and putting on a show. Djay picks up an ancient digital keyboard, and enlists Key (Anthony Anderson), a family man and churchgoer, to work with him on the music. Key knows Shelby (DJ Qualls), a white kid with musical skills. They staple cardboard egg containers to the walls to soundproof a recording studio, enlist a hooker named Shug (Taraji P. Henson) to sing backup, and make the recording.

What Djay cannot be expected to understand is that Skinny Black gets countless demos pressed warmly into his hands every day. He does not have the power in the music industry that Djay imagines. Discovering a talented newcomer might be professional suicide. And beyond that is the whole world-view Skinny Black has bought into: his cars, his bodyguards, his image as a menacing rapper. Djay's first approach to him is miscalculated and all wrong. The way he uses his instincts to try again is smart, and brave.

But ""Hustle & Flow"" is not limited to Djay's rags-to-riches dream, because it is not a formula film. Much more interesting are his day-to-day relationships. Nola (Taryn Manning), the white woman who gets the benefit of his theory of human life, is his most profitable hooker, even though she tells Djay how much she hates getting into the cars of strange men. Shug, who Djay gradually realizes he loves, is pregnant, probably not with Djay's child. Lexus (Paula Jai Parker) has an income as a stripper, which makes her more outspoken and independent.

Djay plays the pimp role and is effective enough, but his heart isn't in it. The dream of the demo record fills his mind -- and also obsesses Key and Shelby, to the dismay of Key's wife, who sees her churchgoing breadwinner spending his free time with a pimp (""What woman wouldn't be thrilled to have her man in a house full of whores?"").

What happens is that Djay's horizon expands as his imagination is challenged. It isn't really the hope of stardom that keeps him going. It isn't the dubious connection with Skinny Black that inspires him. What we see in the ""Hustle & Flow"" is rarely seen in the movies: the redemptive power of art. Djay is transformed when he finds something he loves doing and is getting better at. To create something out of your own mind and talent and see that it is good: That is a joy that makes the rest of his life seem shabby and transparent.

Terrence Howard modulates Djay with great love and consideration for the character. He never cheapens him, or condescends. He builds him inside-out. He is a pimp and a dealer because he is smart and has ambition, and that is how, in his world, with his background, he can find success. The film accumulates many subtle moments to show how his feelings for Shug develop, how he begins by giving her the kind of ""love"" pimps use as a control mechanism, and slowly realizes that another kind of love is growing.

Shug is played by Taraji P. Henson as so wounded, so vulnerable, so loyal, that we're astonished at the complex emotions developed by the story. Listen to her: ""Letting me sing on the demo made me feel real. I know, moving up, you gonna get real good people, so I want you to know, it meant the world to me."" What has transformed him has opened room for her transformation.

""Hustle & Flow"" shows, among other things, what a shallow music-video approach many films take to the inner city, and then what complexities and gifts bloom there. Every good actor has a season when he comes into his own, and this is Terrence Howard's time.",1141084800,,5451,4.644190871369295

I think D-Jay's development as a character is the strongest aspect of this film, and Howard's pitch-perfect acting makes D-Jay 3-dimensional.

The rest of the actors do a good job, particularly Anthony Anderson as his old acquaintance and current collaborator Key, and Taryn Manning as Nola, a brittle young prostitute searching for a purpose in life.  As for the story: just as it seems like it's going to become predictable, it surprises you.

My husband, who absolutely detests hip-hop and rap, had two of the main songs from this film stuck in his head after we finished watching it, which says something about the high quality of the music and the film itself.

He is a wonderful actor who I've loved in all his roles from Angel Eyes, Best Man, Crash, Lakawanna Blues and now Hustle and Flow.  He's done a fantastic job here - definately worthy of an Oscar.  Whilst I loved his acting and much of the rest of the cast, I didn't absolutely love the movie itself.  It was good, but too raw and gritty for my taste.  I liked the aspect of DJay (Howard) wanting a better life than what he had as a pimp, but as I mentioned, I thought it too raw for me.  For me, the second best part (from the acting) was the soundtrack.  There are some great songs here and I might check out the cd.  It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp is a fantastic song and I hope it gets the Oscar it's nominated for.

I don't particularly like rap, but I like the movies that rap has inspired about the down-and-out guy trying to cut a record. Terrence Howard (Four Brothers, Big Momma's House) stars a Djay, a pimp trying to get by selling Nola (Tarryn Manning, taking a big step from ""Crossroads"") and Lex (Paula Jai Parker) while supporting the pregnant Shug (Taraji P. Henson). Taking inspiration from a rapper named Skinny Black (Ludacris) who lived in the same town and made it big, Djay with the help of old friend

Key (Anthony Anderson) tries to cut a big record. You may remember a simalar story from movies such as ""8 Mile"" but writer/director Craig Brewer does it a bit different. The dialouge is inspired, the raps aren't that bad and Howard gives the character a vulnerability while keeping the necessary toughness. While, Howard's performance was acclaimed I wouldn't expect any Academy Award nominations being thrown at him even though he would deserve it. The end of the film was quite good, just when you think it's over for him sh*t happens. A-",1140566400,,1148,4.711442786069652

2420594,5,B000BITUWU,"""Hustle & Flow"" is a celebration of Southern hip-hop, specifically Memphis ""crunk"", by writer, director, and Memphis native Craig Brewer. DJay (Terrence Howard) is a philosophical pimp who hustles Nola (Taryn Manning) out of his car while his other lady Shug (Taraji B. Henson) is pregnant and out of commission. DJay is a consummate hustler whose way with words could sell anyone on anything, but he never had much ambition beyond his daily grind. A mid-life crisis changes that. DJay feels the pull of music and decides to start taking songwriting seriously. He convinces straight-laced Clyde (Anthony Anderson), nicknamed ""Key"", an audio engineer whom he knew in high school, to record his  demo. They set up a makeshift studio, and, with the help of astute musician Shelby (D.J. Qualls), they set out to make some music. Pretty soon everyone involved is hanging his or her dreams on DJay's music.

At first, ""Hustle & Flow"" looked to me like a stylish, grungy take on the poor man makes good theme -and it is, but not in the sense I had first thought. DJay isn't a guy who raps his way out of the urban ghetto. This is a Southern film with a strong regional identity in the tradition of ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" or ""Honkytonk Man"", except this is Memphis, not Nashville, and crunk, not country music. It thankfully lacks the unbridled optimism and saccharine quality of films like ""8 Mile"". ""Hustle & Flow"" is optimistic -adamant, in fact- about people's ability to express their culture and experience in great music, but not necessarily optimistic about people themselves. It's not a Cinderella story. But it's one of 2005's best films, because its characters are so full of life and its environment so vivid.

Terrence Howard is absolutely electrifying as DJay. He makes this lowlife pimp with an interesting mind but a cruel temper into a star. I couldn't take my eyes off of him. And the rest of the cast does no less. Even Yevette (Elise Neal), Clyde's proper bourgeois wife, jumps off the screen with her tales of job woes. ""Hustle & Flow"" doesn't condescend to her any more than it does to the hookers and hustlers. Nola and Shug are emotionally needy people who allow themselves to be pimped in exchange for affirmation of self-worth or assurance of dominance, respectively. These actresses embrace their roles without melodrama or angst. And ""Hustle & Flow"" resists the obvious temptation to make them weak.

""Hustle & Flow"" was shot in 23 days on digital video. Fortunately, it doesn't look like it. It looks like DV, but not shoddy DV. Kudos to cinematographer Amy Vincent for that. I see about 100 new films a year, and ""Hustle & Flow"" is one of few stand-outs from 2006. For one thing, it isn't something I've seen a hundred times before -although the trailer might lead you to think that it is. Craig Brewer has really captured the flavor of a particular place, time, and type of music. Terrence Howard deserves an Oscar nomination, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that he got one. I've rarely seen such a charismatic and electrifying transformation.

The DVD (Paramount 2006): Bonus features include 3 featurettes, footage of the movie premiere, promotional spots, and an audio commentary. ""Behind the Hustle"" (26 min) features interviews with writer/director Craig Brewer, producer Stephanie Allain, producer John Singleton, who funded the film, and the cast. They discuss characters, casting, and themes. ""Creatin' Crunk"" (13 min) is about the film's score, which features some of the original Stax players from the 1970s.  Composer Scott Bomar talks about the score and its influences. ""By Any Means Necessary"" (14 min) is about the struggles to get the film made. ""Memphis Hometown Premiere"" (5 min) includes interviews with the film's stars at the premiere and a declaration by Memphis' Mayor to make July 6, 2005 ""Hustle & Flow Day"". ""Promotional Spots"" (4 min) are 6 short spots in which the actors promote the film intercut with footage from the movie. In the audio commentary by writer/director Craig Brewer, Brewer provides scene-by-scene commentary about dialogue, characters, locations, filming in Memphis, and some technical details with an emphasis on his directing technique, the music, and the film's themes.

2420595,5,B000BITUWU,"I really didn't know what to expect from this movie. I hate the modern African American culture and I hate the glorification of violence and crime in the rap culture.

Which could be why I really liked this movie so much. I think it is one of the best dramas I've seen this year, with an excellent performance from Terrence Dashon Howard. Also Anthony Anderson proving that he is more than a source of cheap laughs. Anthony Anderson has actually really grown in stature as an actor. With his work in the 4th season of The Shield and now this, I am pretty comfortable in saying he is one of the better actors working in hollywood today.

Two things impressed me about Hustle & Flow. First was the setting. Normally when you think about a rag to riches story about a black pimp turned rapper, you get a pretty grotesque view of what the picture would be like. But the setting in this movie is kept realistic.

The pimping isn't easy, and the prostitution aspect is ugly. Nothing is glamorized. The hookers don't do it because they are nymphomaniacs, but because it feeds them. They don't stick to their pimp (Howard) because they are in love with him, but because he is a good business man.

The heart of this movie has Howard interacting with former high school budy, and now well adjusted family man, Anthony Anderson. Anderson has always dreamt about making it big, and when he first hears Howard's music we can tell that it isn't so impressive, but Anderson wants to believe. Not just because it carries the plot forward but because he wants to find some way of builidng on his dream.

The bulk of the movie shows us how music is painstakingly composed on a low budget. Egg trays are nailed to the walls to act as sound proof, verses are repated over and over till they are done right.

Overall it was a very good drama, and this is coming from someone who hates the rap culture.",1138320000,,1881,4.469387755102041
2420596,3,B000BITUWU,"Okay, so I want to say that if this movie hadn't been so hyped up I may have liked it more.  I thought it was decent for what it is, but oscar worthy it is not, all except a few supporting roles who seem to outshine the star whenever they're on screen.  Howard is an overrated entity, an actor with some star power that seems to be overhyped to the point that when you finally see him on screen your dissapointed because he just doesn't LIVE UP TO THE HYPE.  I hope he doesn't get the fifth slot at the oscars because his performance just isn't oscar material.  The movie as a whole carries a good value for us to see, that you don't have to stay where you are or feel that your place is confined to the life you live now...you can better yourself and you can rise above the prison you face.  DJay (Howard) is a pimp, hustler and drug dealer.  He has Nola (Manning in a great supporting role), his star ho and figuratize lil' sis and theres Shug (now here is the oscar worthy performance of the film...Taraji P. Henson shines here) pregnant and emotional and the light in DJays dark tunnel.  After meeting Key (Anderson), an old high school buddy he decides to try his hand at putting together a record.  With the help of Key and Shelby (DJ Quals who provides some laughs) he puts together a demo to show Skinny Black (Ludacris), the Memphis legend, once turning hits in his mothers laundry room and now rolling in the big leagues.  The film shows the fire in the eyes of those who want to be more than they are, and those that are wiling to fight to get where they need to be.  For a pimp who's shot down almost every step of the way DJay shows he has the fight to make it, but will he?  The film is decent, a good film that shows who you can be if you work hard at it...with some impressive suppoting roles and an impressive script.  My only complaint is all the hype...I sat down expecting an oscar winner and I got a popcorn muncher...Maybe it'll fair well at the MTV movie awards...It belongs there.  3 1/2 stars for me.",1138147200,,2025,4.228571428571429

2420602,4,B000BITUWU,"Surprisingly powerful performances dominate what is essentially a familiar story of a man who dreams of having a better existence than the one he has. What's revelatory is the atmosphere that director-screenwriter Craig Brewer paints in this bitingly realistic film focused on DJay, a Memphis pimp desperate to change his marginalized life and become a rapper to get out of the ghetto. He's obviously bright and articulate but morally bankrupt, as he makes a living selling the services of two women, the young but world-weary Nola and the embittered stripper Lexus, with a third prostitute at home, the self-defeating Shug, pregnant with his child. In the midst of a mid-life crisis, DJay reconnects with an old schoolmate, Key, who is now a sound engineer for a local church, who in turn, introduces DJay to Shelby, a white musician with his own beat machine. Together they cut a demo tape that DJay plans to give a local celebrity, hip-hop rapper Skinny Black, at a 4th of July party thrown by a mutual friend Arnel.

The film takes a while to gain its momentum, as Brewer establishes the gritty realism of his setting before moving the plot along. Credit Amy Vincent's verit-style cinematography, which makes us inhabit the ghetto setting without caution. Thanks mostly to Terrence Howard's searing portrayal of DJay, the story gains a palpable soul in his struggle to make it. Make no mistake in assuming the movie will be unrelentingly bleak and violent. It is, in certain ways, an idealistic film about finding one's destiny no matter how onerous the odds. Brewer is wise to keep his focus on the characters rather than the situation as the actors deliver the goods in unexpected ways. Comic actor Anthony Anderson is surprisingly subtle as Key, and along with Elise Neal's sharp turn as his high-strung, upwardly mobile wife Yevette, represents the black middle-class lifestyle with observational precision.

The three women who play the prostitutes leave vivid impressions - Paula Jai Parker powerfully shows the angry desperation of the aging Lexus; Taryn Manning combines the hick and huckster of Nola, the only one making DJay money; and in the film's most poignant performance, Taraji P. Henson brings heart and painful melancholy to Shug. When she discovers her vocal chops during a recording session or innocently brings in a lava lamp, Henson is heartbreakingly impressive. Ludacris makes his key moments count as the nihilistic Skinny Black. There are also some predictable plot turns that move the story toward clich, including a climax that teeters on melodrama and a somewhat far-fetched conclusion, but Brewer's original execution compensates. Above all else, it's Howard who makes the film resonate with a rich, multi-dimensional characterization. As he moves fluently back and forth between scarifying and tender, Howard makes DJay not heroic but real and painfully wanting of a better lot in life.

The DVD has several extras - Brewer's insightful commentary on an alternate audio track and three solid featurettes that lend insight to the production - ""Behind the Hustle"", which includes the cast members talking about their roles and showing their various auditions; ""By Any Means Necessary"", in which Brewer and producers John Singleton and Stephanie Allain talk about the struggles to get the film made; and ""Creatin' Crunk"", which showcases the various funk and rap stars called upon to create the memorable songs DJay and the others perform throughout the film.

A gangster, or a pimp as it is in this story, sees a chance to crawl out of the nowhere life he is seemingly trapped in and achieve some sort of redemption and/or trancendency through music.  It's easy to root for the nobody reaching for the brass ring against all odds in the dim hope of becoming recognized as a greater human being than anybody thought possible.  But most of these type of films fall flat due to poor writing and second-rate acting.  ""Hustle & Flow"" is a surprising exception.  The acting, all around, is often astonishing.  Terrence Howard leads the way with a dominating performance which reminded me of the fine work of Benicio Del Toro, where both actors completely lose themselves in the role and we all believe the character actually exists somewhere out there in the world.  The dialogue is superb, and with so many good actors drawn to this film, the words reach extremely high levels of literary sharpness.  The biggest surprise for me, however, was that I thoroughly enjoyed all the music throughout the movie.  I despise most Rap, but in ""Hustle & Flow"" the rapping is smooth and enveloped with soul, thus achieving much more depth of emotion in the final summation.  Once again, an independent film shows up all those over-hyped, over-budget Hollywood films that we are force-fed each year.

2420610,4,B000BITUWU,"Terrence Howard is one of those actors who seemingly can do anything.  No matter what the role he intelligently chooses to play he is always phenomenally fine (Crash, Ray, Lackawanna Blues, Their Eyes Were Watching God, Four Brothers, Hart's War, etc etc etc).  In HUSTLE & FLOW writer/director Craig Brewer has finally given him a vehicle that allows him more screen time and the opportunity to create a character that burns his image on our memory indelibly.

The story of a pimp and drug dealer in Memphis, stuck in the poverty level and rapidly drowning in mid-life crisis, who pulls himself into the stream of his need and dream to be something different, a rapper star, has been told before but never in the gritty realistic atmospheric way this film does.  One of the most telling sequences of both writing and acting is the opening scene of the film when Djay (Howard) quietly talks his philosophy to Nola (Taryn Manning), his primary prostitute, simply sitting in the front seat of his car, awaiting johns.  Howard makes this soliloquy pungent yet quiet and in the words we hear provide the outline for the story to follow.

While Terrence Howard's is towering, the supporting cast is superb also.  Anthony Anderson, DJ Qualls, Taraji P. Henson, Paula Jai Parker, Isaac Hayes, and Ludacris all offer genuine portraits of difficult characters.  The smarmy side of Memphis is well captured by cinematographer Amy Vincent.  This is  a fine film, a bit difficult to watch at times because of the bruises of poverty and the  depths to which people must descend at times to survive.  But the story is pungent and tough and Terrence Howard is a marvel to watch.  Grady Harp, January 06",1136937600,,1687,4.815972222222222
2420611,4,B000BITUWU,"Look for Terrence Howard to be the next ""biggest thing"" since sliced bread.  He excels at every role he's performed.  He has a keen eye for getting to the heart of the role and injecting little nuances that make the characters seem as if they might be someone you know.  Although the cast as a whole does a fine job, Howard stands out, as he always does, and gives a sterling performance.  I forsee great roles for im in the future.  The film has a gritty hard edge to it and plays out nicley without being phony.  Although Howard's character is a user and a player, it conveys the dream that all of us have.  Even a two bit hustler wants a better life, even though he might not know what constitutes a better life.  Hustle & Flow is a wonderful drama.  There's is even talk of an Oscar nomination for Howard.",1136851200,,809,4.269736842105263
2420612,5,B000BITUWU,"This is one of the most compelling films within the past two years. Dee Jay really grabs your heart and you feel for him the entire film. The side characters add humor and great subplots. Ludacris makes himself one of the best villains in urban theatre, you really want to see him battered and bruised by the end of this film. And it has a happy ending, which most people seem to think is cliche, but in fact has become just the opposite.",1135814400,,438,4.289156626506024

8087379,5,B000BITUWU,I loved this movie. Everyone can believe in hope. It seems that the main character was touched by the singer in the church and decided to revive a dream he had in his youth and in going after his dream he touched those around him. It's a great story set in an unexplored environment.,1519948800,,283,4.2592592592592595
8087380,1,B000BITUWU,I wouldn't have given this movie the pleasure of wasting anymore of my time but for the sake of other peoples time I hope I can at least help one person avoid my mistake. The fact that this movie was rated so high goes to show that humanity is doomed.,1518912000,,251,4.04

8087382,5,B000BITUWU,So well written. Enjoyed every minute...hell I think they had another 30 min at least in the post jail time aspect. Definitely worth the watch if you can relate to this culture or you just like the struggle aspect of it.,1517356800,,220,4.390243902439025
