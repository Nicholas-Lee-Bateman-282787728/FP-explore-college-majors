4172237,4,B003R0MEJA,For fans of the the 80's prime time soap this one was great!  Jane Wyman is fun to Watch as scheming Angela Channing.  A great whodunit runs throughout this season and it has a great not-to-be-missed cliffhanger finale!!!  Not quite at it's peak but getting there...can't wait for season three!

4172243,4,B003R0MEJA,"(2015-08-26 update:  OK.  So I've watched the first three seasons now, and admit that I am now hooked.  People didn't like my previous rating -- a 3 -- but to be fair, I wasn't familiar yet with the characters.  So I'm updating to a 4 because, well, ""Falcon Crest"" is a guilty pleasure.  And it's awesome to see Richard drink milk all the time, instead of just wine.  ""Ooh, I think you'll like this show.""  Gulp.)

My wife and I live about 20 minutes or so from the winery where this show was filmed, a winery that shall remain unnamed.  After all, from what I understand, the current owners of that winery want no association with this show, and can you blame them?  I sure don't.  So, from here on, I will call the winery ""FC,"" after Falcon Crest.

Anyways, we were just at FC today, making a wine pickup, and tasting some of their fabulous wines, with one of the nicest gals that works in the entire area.  She will remain anonymous as well, only because I don't want her name associated with this nonsense either.  But while this show is borderline terrible, the wines at FC are not; they are some of the most Bordeaux-like wines that you will ever drink in Napa.  If you know anything about Napa wines, they can be fruit bombs, although I do like quite a few of the Sauvignon and Fume Blancs here.  Most of the Chardonnays are undrinkable ""Butter Bandits,"" as Gary Vaynerchuck might groan.  Oh, sure, there are some very good Cabs here, I suppose.  But there are surely better red wines to be had, such as the Syrahs from Walla Walla, WA.  Yes, I'm not kidding; try some Cayuse, Reynvaan, or K (yes, ""K"" is the correct name, perhaps with an added ""Vintners"") sometime and you'll get onboard.  In a hurry.

And just like the fruit bombs from Napa, this show is an over-extracted mess as well.  I tell you, whoever was the writer for this show should have been fired faster than a one-handed grape picker.  I can't believe that it lasted a second season, or even longer than that.  But my wife and I just had to watch an episode or two of ""Falcon Crest"" after learning where it was filmed, and yes, we were as disappointed as Robert Parker after drinking a non-vintage BV.

But I will admit, I did get quite a few laughs.  The only soaps that I ever liked were ""Melrose Place"" (the original, not the reboot) and ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,"" only because at least those shows made fun of the genre, and themselves.  In contrast, ""Falcon Crest"" seemed to think that it was good, which it was not.  I'm only giving it a 3 today because of my laughs.  And there were many.

As an example, here is a line from Season 2, Episode 1:

""You think that you can wrestle Falcon Crest away from me?  I know what you did; I know that you had a part in the death of my father.  So sign here, giving me controlling interest of Falcon Crest.  Otherwise, I'll call the DA faster than you can say 'Lickety Split' and then you'll be in prison, and you'll lose your half of the whole shebang.  And good luck getting a glass of Cab in the Big House.""  (Ok, this wasn't verbatim; I took a few liberties.  But it's pretty close.)

Yeah, ouch.  With writing like that, maybe they should have just stuck to wine making.  But if you do enough peeking, you'll discover which winery this was filmed at, and you'll give their wines a chance.  And you won't use a spit bucket, unless you watch this show at the same time.",1425081600,,3394,4.349282296650718
4172244,4,B003R0MEJA,"The ever interesting series that provided us with Dallas-like entertainment through the 1980s. It does help if one has watched from the beginning, as it provides a sense of how characters have evolved and why a certain enmity exists between certain individuals. A growing cast and more intricate storyline builds upon each season, and is often bolstered by Angela Channing's (Jane Wyman) ambitions and desire to squash anyone who dares to defy her wishes.

4172266,4,B003R0MEJA,"I watched Season 1 and thought to myself: ""why as a child I liked this show?""  By the end of Season 1, they added Ana Alicia and with a romance I developed an interest in the show.

I ordered Season 2 last week and I am watching them now.  The DVDs do have chapters based upon the title of the episode and the DVDs are professionally produced; I am not sure what people are complaining about regarding chapters and quality.

Richard - he is the J.R. Ewing of the show; he hates everybody and everybody hates him; I pretty much skip any scenes related to Richard.  I guess what really makes me hate RIchard is that he is having an affair with Melissa for part of Season 2.

Lance - Fine as Hades and as dumb as a bag of rocks; none of his plans or schemes ever work.  Growing up Lance and Melissa were my favorite couple.  Now, I find Lance's laziness and stupidity repulsive.  For instance, Lance has been rich his whole life but doesn't even have any savings.  When Angela put him out one time, he had to go begging his mother for money.  Another time, he tries to beat up Cole and Cole kicks his butt.  Another time, he and Melissa try to blackmail Angela and they ended up looking like fools.  Lance is just stupid. The most upsetting scene was when Lance manhandled Melissa to get her from Cole.  It was indeed wrong of Melissa to stroke Cole's face, but Lance was wrong to throw her to the side.

Cole - too boring for words.  Julia said it best though: Melissa and Cole should have just gotten married when she discovered she was pregnant.  Cole was like a puppy on the show; cute and sweet but not that interesting.  The relationship between he and Linda Caproni is just pathetic and boring

Vickie - her hair is way too red; at 17 she dated a 50 year old professor and this season she is dating a 40 something year old married man.  Vickie has issues.  I am glad she left the show.

Chase - he is always involved in some cause; this season he insists on solving the Agretti murder to clear Cole.  In my view, the sheriff should have hired additional police force rather than keep Chase involved in the investigation for like 12 episodes

Emma - I understand she is mentally challenged but I just don't see her purpose on the show.  This season Richard has hired her to work at the NEW GLOBE.

Melissa - I don't know what is wrong with her.  Her whole focus in life is power and money.  She has power and money so I am not understanding why she acted so stupid for much of Season 2. Pregnant with Cole's baby; sex with Richard; stroking Cole's face while claiming she loves Lance; blackmailing Angela about the Agretti Vineyards and so forth.  Melissa promised to fulfil her father's promise of getting Falcon Crest; this makes no sense considering that the Agretti VIneyards are the equivalent of Falcon Crest.

Maggie - she was cast as the everyday womnan; she bores me but she is not so bad on the show; this season she has written a screen play about her life

Julia - her mother robbed her of her life so she turns into a criminal to try to escape her mother; she really becomes conniving in Season 3

Chao-Li - he has all of this advice but yet he is a butler; if he is sooo smart why doesn't Angela make him her business associate or something?",1374796800,2,3258,4.307565789473684

4172271,5,B003R0MEJA,"I was pleasantly surprised when I received the second season of Falcon Crest in DVD-R format.  I was expecting low quality DVD's, but I was happy to discover that the quality was quite good.  In my opinion, the second season was the best season of Falcon Crest.  It kept the viewer wanting to see more.  I remember when I watched it for the first time in 1982-83, I could not wait for the show to come on immediately after Dallas on Friday night.  The cliffhanger was one of the best,  if not the best, of all primetime soaps.  I was shocked to discover that one of the major characters was the murderer.  I liked the way the writers worked the reason for the murder into the storyline so seamlessly.  I also liked the way that Jacqueline was revealed to be the head of the cartel.  I even remembered some lines from the cliffhanger, such as when Melissa tells Angela that it must be a joke that she is offering to buy her grapes at a very low price and Angela replies, ""Do I look like I'm joking?"" with such a serious expression on her face, when Melissa tells Angela that she will wait to sell her grapes to Richard and Angela tells her that she will be ""the raisin queen of the Tuscany Valley"" if she waits for him to return, and when Julia states that ""this isn't a family, it's a snake pit""  at Vicki and Nick's reception.  These are memorable lines that are not common to today's shows.  I highly recommend that you purchase these DVD's.  You will be very pleased that you did.",1353888000,,1483,4.326086956521739
4172272,5,B003R0MEJA,a very good show to bad they cant make the rest of the seasons cause i would buy them all amazon is the only place where you can buy these classic shows.,1332806400,,153,3.8125
4172273,4,B003R0MEJA,"The first season was slow for me. It reminded me of the first season of Dynasty. Anyway Season 2 moved along pretty well and was interesting. The problem with it was there was so much going on that they dropped/delayed two of the plots. They created the shooting of Melissa's dad and the framing of Cole. Then they just kinda dropped it and moved on to other stuff. And they did the same about Cole being the father of Melissa's baby. It was a big deal at the end of Season 1--their relationship. The baby's father was still of interest at the beginning of season two. Then they just stated it as fact, hide the baby's father's identity, and let things ride. Strange. No father fighting to see his kid. No love story between them. Nothing. Weird. Anyway per most of my other comments on the tv shows of this era I  grew up watching this show off and on. I was not a devote viewer. But I remember as a kid seeing Chase and his famil y as the ""good"" family. And Angela as the ""mean"" one. Well I watch it now and see that it is just typical 70s/80s liberal vs conservative. Communism vs capitalism, even. Angela is family oriented and a good business woman who is hated for it. Chase is the tree hugging, illegal immigrant protecting, ""anti-business"" person. But what is so weird is as Chase is built up as the hero of the story he becomes more and more arrogant and bosy--he turns into Angela. Pounding fists on tables. Demanding of the police. Threatening. Making deals behind closed doors. Etc. But on a technical note one thing I could do without in these DVDs is the commercial breaks. They interrupt the show with the announcer saying ""Falcon Crest will return"" or whatever and then instead of seeing commercials you see the FC emblem and hear the announcer stated ""And now Falcon Crest"" or whatever. Why waste our time with that. But if that keeps the costs down so we can actually see the rest of the seasons then I'll deal with it.",1328140800,6,1937,4.42577030812325

However, I bought the first season on DVD on a whim after falling in love with such shows as Dallas and Knots Landing. I was blown away by virtually every aspect of the show. However, hiking up the prices on this second season's DVD set is simply unacceptable . . . production quality is reprehensible, and everything about this LOOKS, SOUNDS, and FEELS like it came from the eighties. Someone should have at least TRIED here, especially for what they're charging!  There is little that makes this DVD set worth owning accept that as a person who loved the first season, I wanted to know what came next. Honestly, I wish I hadn't bothered.

4172289,5,B003R0MEJA,"""Falcon Crest"" was one of the most popular night-time soap operas to ever air on network television. Like ""Peyton Place"", ""Dynasty"", and ""Knots Landing"" before it ""Falcon Crest"" told a continuing story week after week mesmerizing a nation into a fantasy world. In this instance that fantasy revolved around the rich and powerful Angela Channing who ran a winery near San Francisco, who was nearly as evil as J.R. Ewing, but who loved and protected her family at all costs. The series became the #8 rated series on primetime TV in the 1982-1983 season (thanks in no small part to ""Dallas"" being its lead-in as that show was #1), but the stories on ""Falcon Crest"" that year were exciting, involving, and at times nail-biting as most of the plot revolved around a murder. In the series' final season episode that aired on March 11, 1983 it was revealed that Angela's daughter, Julia, had committed the murder. In the final shot Julia (surrounded by family and friends) pulls out a gun as the camera pans away from the mansion and shots ring out. Just before the credits roll the scene cuts to a funeral as a coffin is lowered into the ground and viewers are left guessing all summer ""who died?"".

 This season features 22 uncut episodes, but there are no bonus features. With the culmination of the entire ""Dallas"" library of seasons now being made available for purchase hopefully Warner Brothers (""Dallas"" and ""Falcon Crest's"" owner) will release the remaining seasons of this wonderful soap.",1293062400,8,1491,4.8431372549019605
4172290,4,B003R0MEJA,I couldn't wait to tare into the second season when it finally arrived in my mailbox. I believe I watched the entire season within 3 days and cant wait for season 3. My only gripe was during the final episode with the coffin cliffhanger they changed or edited the original ending. When Julia fired her gun they panned to the mansion and it actually turned upside down with each shot that rang out thus giving it a more dramatic climatic effect. This was missing from the final episode and they should have left it the way it originally aired all those years ago. But Im glad I was able to see it again and keeping my fingers crossed that they will release season 3 and that the cost won't be 100 dollars. Geesh!,1292716800,5,711,4.353383458646617

I was shocked to see season 2 is only made on demand and is almost doubled what season one was. This is probably in my opinion the best season, if for nothing else because of Lana Turner's guest appearances and show downs with Jane Wyman. I think it is a shame as with other series on dvd that greed has krept again. If the manufacturers were not so greedy, they would realize they would get more sales at an affordable price. Many fans would buy this for Lana Turner alone. Shame on you for not caring for the Falcon Crest fans.",1292544000,15,648,4.192

I love that there's closed captions. And like on youtube, you could look through the episode and since Melissa has always been my favorite character, it's so easy to find her scenes. I wish there was more though, especially since Warner Bros sells Falcon Crest also. Why not release all the seasons? I have the rest of the seasons on VHS tapes but they aren't as clear. I don't understand Amazon Video completely though. I thought I could download a copy to another device. I have a Samsung tablet but I couldn't watch it on there plus you have to change the settings to allow 3rd party apps. Someone wrote not to do it because they got hacked that way. When I wrote to amazon, they told me to do the same things I had already done. It sounds like you have to have a Kindle Fire to watch it elsewhere.
