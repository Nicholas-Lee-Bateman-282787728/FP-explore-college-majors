315090,5,6301039009,"'The Sound of Fury' (a.k.a. 'Try and Get Me') surpasses those three classics of lynch-mob terror - Lang's 'Fury', Wellman's 'The Ox-Bow Incident' and Corman's 'The Intruder' - in its savage melodramatic power; its determination to galvanise its audience; its political integrity (the journalist who influences the mob is a civilised bourgeois cosy with the corrupt elite; with the anti-hero an ex-army prole in a near-Depression small-town, with an immigrant wife), its visual sense of America, its forgotten, anonymous small towns, its bowling alleys, petrol stations, caravan camps.  There is one extraordinary sequence, the equal of the bank robbery in 'Gun Crazy' (no higher praise, etc.): we watch a petrol station hold-up through the window behind the getaway driver, the camera held on Frank Lovejoy's nervy, sweaty face, the second drama playing out in miniature.  The seamless move from relentless film noir to complex, undogmatic social tract is invigorating.",1010361600,19,969,5.496644295302014
315091,5,6301039009,"Despite a catch-penny tile, ""Try and Get Me"" remains a truly frightening movie whose disturbing imagery lingers long after the voice-over reassurances subside. The director, Cy Endfield, was one of the lower profile victims of the Mc Carthy purges. Viewing this movie , it's easy to see why. Family man and returning vet Howard Tyler (played by the always low-key Frank Lovejoy) is recruited into a life of crime by no more than ordinary desires for the American Dream. Desperate and enemployed, he falls into the clutches of a swaggering stickup man superbly played by a preening Lloyd Bridges. (Notice how subtly Bridges bends Tyler to his will on their first meeting at the bowling alley.) Joining Bridges, Tyler finally gets the standing he desires, but the spiral he has entered dooms him and his family's share of America's promise. (Note that conspicuous among the lynch mob's vanguard are fraternity boys, true to the actual event on which the movie is based.)

Throughout, the lighting and photography effectively undermine the facile voice of reason which the producers probably felt obligated to include. Endfield may have wanted an anti-violence film, but the resulting visual landscape implies a world of endemic violence. A sense of powerlessness pervades the film, one that mere admonishments cannot overcome. As a result, the characters appear caught in some terrible metaphysical web from which there is no escape. Events march relentlessly on to a conclusion that remains one of the most harrowing in Hollywood history. This is film noir at its darkest and most frightening.

Something should be noted in passing about the compellingly exotic performance of Katherine Locke as Hazel the manicurist. Watch her facial expressions as this highly repressed plain-faced woman experiences yet one more rejection in what a paste-on smile shows to be a lifetime of rejections. Never has a blossom perched so precariously on a cheap hairdo conveyed as much lower-class longing as hers, while the car ride with a guilt-ridden Tyler could serve as tawdry inspiration for a dozen feminist tracts. What ever became of this unusual actress, I wonder.

That Endfield exiled himself to England and a conventional career with Stanley Baker, shows how much was lost among those purge victims whose disappearance, unlike many others, went generally unnoticed. Just a couple of years after the remarkable ""Try and Get Me"" (and Endfield's also provocative ""Underworld Story""), Hollywood began sanitizing the screen with the escapism of period spectacles, technicolor westerns, and full-cleavage sex goddesses. Indeed times had changed. As Endfield already knew, the studios had to fight the Cold War too. There would be no more thought-provoking Try and Get Me's.",991008000,39,2760,5.2681818181818185
315092,4,6301039009,"This film includes some classic noir story lines.  The protagonist (Frank Lovejoy) is drawn into a world of petty crime when his search for a blue collar job results in despair,confusion, and rejection.  Lovejoy's  conscious becomes embroiled in turmoil when the values and convictions of  an honest man fall short of providing security for his wife and son.  Lovejoy meets a two bit hood in a bowling alley who convinces him that the  workingmans' plight is a life filled with nothingness and unfulfilled  dreams.  They embark on a series of gas station robberies and enjoy the  excitement of quick cold cash.  Unbeknownest to his wife who thinks that he  is working the late shift at a factory, the family settles into a temporary  state of middle class bliss.  But this is short lived, an eventual murder  charge is brought aginst Lovejoy. The film then moves at a rapid pace,  where prosecutors, newsmen, women, and victims are woven into Lovejoy's  frozen conscious. Lloyd Bridges gives an indelible performance as the  maniacal street hood who justifies crime as a means to achieve a higher  class in an unforgiven society.  The acting, camera work, lighting, and,  editing  is superb as the two are held and trapped in a town jail where  ironically an angry mob seeks entrance and ultimate  revenge.  This film is  a must see for noir enthusiasts.  Critics argue that Richard Widmark's  performance in Kiss of Death transformed the criminal figure into a warped  and brutal character whose proclivity for violence was unrestrained.  Lloyd  Bridges's performance in Try and Get Me reaffirms this image, albeit, more  convincingly.",955152000,15,1636,5.037593984962406

Shortly after this picture he was blackballed in Hollywood for communist affiliations.  Lloyd Bridges as the bad guy is an astounding screen figure and a total revelation to someone only familiar with him as a caricature of himself in later comedies as I was going into this movie.  It suffers a bit from some obvious budgetary limitations but the improvised scene of mob violence that serves as the climax is powerful and in many ways ahead of its time.

Lead actor Lovejoy is capable enough (dullish enough) as a working class knob, but it is Bridges who suprises. He's an actor whom I usually find pretty unpersuasvie but here he plays a wonderfully scary -and funny-  thug ""with ambition.""  The actresses too, none of whom I know, are peculiar and interesting, and the photography of LA (?) streets and night lights is sharp and effective.

Though dated for todays audiences, the movie is a solid reminder that violence is a disease caused by moral and psychological breakdown. So states this movie. Jerry fits the bill. Bridgess character is an egotistic, psychologically disturbed man. Nor is mob violence an emotional answer for justice. The press is without a conscience, printing the first emotional headline that comes to mind, ignoring that a person is innocent until proven guilty. So some things haven't changed much since the 1950s. Highly recommend this film, though do not totally understand the title.",1426982400,4,622,5.1683168316831685

315393,5,6301039009,"Excellent piece of film-making. Some of the shots (particularly towards the end) are ahead of their time. I would love to see this treated to a DVD or Blu-ray release. The film is based on factual events that occurred in 1933, when two men were arrested in San Jose, California, for kidnapping and murdering Brooke Hart. The suspects confessed and were lynched by a mob of locals. The Fritz Lang-directed 1936 film ""Fury"" was about the same incident. (thanks wikipedia)

I don't know where ""Try and Get Me"" as a title came from; It was released as ""The Sound of Fury"". For that matter, I can't figure out where the title photo amazon is using came from, either.

Wonderful acting by a craazzzzy Lloyd Bridges. Frank Lovejoy turns in a pretty good portrayal of a conflicted and desperate man willing, albeit reluctantly, to do anything to provide for his family.",1411948800,,861,4.733333333333333

315397,2,6301039009,"I'm always surprised at the number of intelligent people who like to be preached to. 'Try and Get Me!' is a very trite, color-by-numbers polemic against the evils of a) mobs, b) trial by press, c) peer pressure, d) poverty and, perhaps, e) the psychological obstacles faced by soldiers returning home from war. If you are oblivious to one or more of these issues, or find them something other than a net negative for society, then watch this instructive film and be educated (for it is far too stiff, simplistic and proselytic to entertain much, even as B-grade noir). If, however, your values are intact going in, you will be bored, annoyed, or perhaps even insulted by director Cy Endfield and company's efforts to walk you step by step through the minefields of 'modern' morality, at the end of which it's clear you are expected to have been converted from philistine to enlightened citizen. TAGM was put out at a time (1950) when psychologists, social workers and public officials were grappling earnestly with ways best to handle WWII/Korean Conflict vets in crisis (some having turned to crime, a motif touched upon commonly in noir), to honor their service to our country by offering them special consideration rather than callously tossing them aside to be dealt with by the vagaries of the welfare, justice or penal systems-- a fine and noble endeavor which continues with only mixed success even today. The problem with TAGM is that it conflates the idea of providing for the emotionally wounded/marginalized G.I. (Frank Lovejoy's character, while he was in the military, never saw combat) with the old, failed, collectivist notion (coinciding with a renewed interest in Marxism among the academic and Hollywood elite, which led to the McCarthy era) of the state's being obligated to rescue criminals from their inner demons rather than punish them for their misdeeds, in the process wagging a finger at the American institutions of capitalism and democratic-majority rule as the root causes of villainy (most of the supporting players in TAGM, you'll see, are portrayed in caricature as hard-hearted vigilantes, ignorant sheep or money-driven slobs). Politics aside, if these themes had been approached more evenhandedly or artistically, as they have been in scores of socially conscious films before and since, TAGM might bring something livelier to the table than a schoolroom lecture. 2-plus stars for an energetic, menacing performance by Lloyd Bridges and a convincingly staged lynch scene.",1357344000,9,2506,5.15970515970516

Frank Lovejoy struggles to find work after WW2 and eventually meets a con-man and petty thief (Lloyd Bridges) who introduces him to a world of stick-ups, blackmail and eventually murder. Lovejoy is an everyman with a young son and wife who, not knowing he's become a criminal, thinks he's working the night shift at a local factory. Richard Carlson is the crusading newspaper reporter who sensationalizes the story of the murder and stirs up a tidal wave of emotion which crashes on an entire town when Carlson and Lovejoy are eventually captured and jailed. The descent into the black hole of crime is played out well and gives proof to the into on the old Philip Marlowe radio shows ...
