8031454,5,B0002SWIY6,"Fly Fishing Yellowstone Hatches is no longer a new DVD, but remains one of the best fly-fishing videos ever.  Well over an hour of real people, who happen to be experts on the area, fishing and explaining the fishing on rivers and lakes of the greater Yellowstone area.  Includes hatch information and is broken down by location and season.  This DVD is now hard to find, but is definitely worth obtaining.",1470268800,,406,4.690140845070423
8031455,5,B0002SWIY6,"If you plan on going to the Yellowstone area you will learn a ton from this video, and it will pump you up as well. Great footage.",1269475200,,130,3.8518518518518516
8031456,5,B0002SWIY6,"You don't NEED this video to fish the Yellowstone area, but it helps. It is especially useful for residents of the area who are able to fish here year round. It breaks down so many of our local hatches, including when to look for the bugs, how to fish a particular hatch, and what patterns are effective. If I'm fishing an area around Yellowstone that I am unfamiliar with anytime from March to November, I pop in this DVD, navigate to the appropriate chapter and watch it as I tie flies for the expedition. Highly recommended.",1221609600,,527,4.5
8031457,5,B0002SWIY6,"Thanks for this DVD,  we used it for our trip to West Yellowstone, and caught more fish then ever.  The information is all there on every river and lake in the area, as well as every hatch and how to fish them... it helps that one of the makers of the DVD won fly fisherman of the year.
