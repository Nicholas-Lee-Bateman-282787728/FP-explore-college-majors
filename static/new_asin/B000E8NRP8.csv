8107210,1,B000E8NRP8,"I must not have read the description closely enough because this is basically a collection of DVDs where they show the pages of a book and narrate.  Very disappointing.  My 3 year old had no interest what so ever in it (Why isn't the monkey moving?).  We have the actual books and cuddle up and read them, movies are a special treat...but not this one!",1273017600,,352,4.384615384615385
