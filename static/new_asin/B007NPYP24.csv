8519709,5,B007NPYP24,All three of these are great movies and the technical transfers are done well.  You cannot beat this collection for the price.,1423699200,,126,4.7272727272727275
8519710,5,B007NPYP24,"LA Confidential and Body Heat are both excellent, but The Player ranks as one of my very favorite films of all time- I've seen it at least 12 times, if not 19.  A wry and insightful inside view of Hollywood, it is tongue-in-cheek par excellence as it regards itself and mocks itself with charm and wit and humor.  It is a rare jewel! Tim Robbins is a wonder.",1407888000,2,358,4.25

8519712,5,B007NPYP24,"These thrilling ""neo-noir"" movies from the 1980s and 1990s reward repeated viewing -- for the acting of fine ensembles, the cleverly written dialog, the unforgettable characters, the twists and turns of suspenseful plots, and much more.

In Lawrence Kasdan's ""Body Heat,"" William Hurt has a tryst with Kathleen Turner, who makes a smashing screen debut. They meet in a steamy Florida bar and smolder until they erupt into a passionate affair that will not end well; it's both an homage to the 1944 classic ""Double Indemnity"" and an intense, engrossing story in its own right. (It contains the great line, ""You're not too smart, are you? I like that in a man."")

The complex, atmospheric ""L.A. Confidental,"" based on the James Ellroy novel, is set in 1950s Los Angeles, where corrupt cops and seamy starlets belie the glamour of Hollywood. It's not just a period piece but a gripping, character-driven drama that makes the most of its stellar cast: Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, and others.

Robert Altman does a mercilessly cynical take on Tinseltown in his production of Michael Tolkin's novel ""The Player."" The film is as much a comedy as a tragedy in which deadly ambition and hilarious desperation collide; Tim Robbins, as a murderous screenwriter, leads a marvelous cast that is complemented by cameos from dozens of major stars.

You get all three Blu-rays, featuring excellent picture and sound, in a compact case with multiple extras (featurettes, commentaries, deleted scenes, trailers, and so on) at a rock-bottom price. An excellent value!",1396137600,7,1589,5.123552123552123
8519713,5,B007NPYP24,Two of these (LA CONFIDENTIAL & BODY HEAT) are among my favorite films of all time. I highly recommend this DVD.,1389312000,,112,4.380952380952381
8519714,5,B007NPYP24,"Great performances by all the players.  Even though I've seen them before, I still enjoy the intrigue and the endings.",1382054400,,118,4.9
8519715,5,B007NPYP24,"I really bought this because I wanted a copy of ""L.A. Confidential"".  The other two movies are a bonus, and I like all the films.",1367193600,,129,4.16
8519716,5,B007NPYP24,"I checked out all three transfers and supplements.  Everything that's available on the single disc editions is included here.  Except for the CD Soundtrack for L.A. Confidential, which is included on that individual release.  Three solid films for film enthusiasts, fans, makers.  And the average movie lover will no doubt be thrilled at having these three discs (and they are 3 separate discs in the case) in their collection.  How can one not recommend this.  One can't not recommend this.",1366243200,10,491,5.075
8519717,4,B007NPYP24,"While the blu-ray film quality is not jaw-dropping, they are a big improvement over the regular DVD's.  All three are excellent film noir style movies.",1360454400,5,151,5.04
