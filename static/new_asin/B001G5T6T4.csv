MISSION ISTAANBUL, coming out in 2008, initially features international terrorism and the media as its centerpiece. Unfortunately, whatever topical relevance this film might've had is soon torpedoed by a plot preference towards brainless, implausible action sequences. So, actually, for undiscriminating action fans, well, you're in for a treat.

With the war on terrorism very much a global issue, the Istanbul-based news channel Al Johara (Al Jazeera, anyone?) is the network of choice to tune into. In fact, Al Johara, in certain circles, is referred to as the mouthpiece of terrorism. And with Al Johara branching out its operations to India, India's top television journalist, Vikas Sagar (Zayed Khan), is recruited by the controversial network and soon finds himself in Istanbul for a three-month orientation regimen.

But there's weird stuff going on at the Al Johara home offices. There's the creepy Hall of Martyrs, where pictures are put up to commemorate Al Johara reporters who perished in the line of duty. And there's the very curious 13th Floor, ostensibly the security headquarters for Al Johara but whose personnel come off as very sinister. A handprint scan is the only way to access the 13th Floor. Vikas gets the wind up when he learns there's more behind the death of a fellow reporter (Suniel Shetty). Then, a mysterious stranger sneaks up and warns him that his life is in danger. As Vikas begins digging for the truth, he soon finds that all trails lead back to Al Johara...

Meanwhile, the elusive terrorist Abu Nazir and his organization had before only targeted America, Israel, and their allies. But now he sets his eyes on India. It's not too long before Vikas gets his nose stuck into this bit of business. And, again, it's all tied into the secretive Al Johara, which, as we now can pretty much assume, is more than just a news channel.

So MISSION ISTAANBUL, after raising some pointed questions about how media is impacted by global terrorism, sells out as strictly an action thriller. And, I guess, judging it solely by its action thriller creds, it's pretty good. Its polished cinematography and quick-cut pseudo-MTV editing move it closer to this side of Hollywood. The amped-up energy and the ""cool"" posturing and attitude of everyone involved lend it that air of hipness. And, with plenty of explosions, bullets blazing, chase scenes, and fight sequences, the kids oughta eat this up. Heck, I bought into it.

Both the male leads got buffed up for this. I've never seen the rail-thin Zayed Khan so swoll. And, acting-wise, he's comparitively restrained in his journalist role (believe me, I've seen him overact before). And I'm actually more impressed with Vivek Oberoi here than in any other film I've seen him in. Sporting long hair, a beard, and new muscles, he's quite believable as the very capable Turkish commando Rizwan Khan. MISSION ISTAANBUL in large part is a buddy film, and these two play off well enough against each other.

At five minutes over two hours, MISSION ISTAANBUL is leaner than most Bollywood films. That's barely enough time to sneak in a love story, something Bollywood almost always insists on including. Shwetta Bharadwaj and Shriya Saran have tiny but meaty parts as, respectively, the deadly femme fatale Liza Lobo and Vikas's journalist ex-wife Anjali. But the movie's really not about them.

How over-the-top is the film? At one point, the film indulges in blatant product placement as Vikas and his two allies take time to down some Mountain Dew before they take on and clobber thirty goons. Don't be too surprised when Vikas displays massive fighting skills (that's a given for every hero in Bollywood). Speaking of over-the-top, I had a laugh-out-loud moment during the scene in which Vikas and Rizwan Khan figured out how to circumvent the handprint scan dilemma of the 13th Floor. And, depending on your political leanings, you might or might not get a kick out of the George Bush scene:

- Presidential Aide: ""It's the Turkey situation, sir""
- Pres. Bush: ""Turkey? Do we have some kind of shortage?""
- Presidential Aide: ""Not the bird, sir. The country.""

Yeah, it's a bit embarassing to learn how other countries view our Commander in Chief. But that scene cracked me up.

Bonus features include a 30-minute ""Making Of"" segment, enough of it in English so that it's worth checking out, if you're that into the film. As always with Bollywood dvds, there's an option for selective viewing of the film's musical numbers. I mention this only because I must've clicked on the catchy item number ""Nobody Like You"" a bunch of times, never mind that its inclusion came at a jarring moment in the film's continuity. ""Nobody Like You"" features a special appearance by Abhishek Bachchan, one of my favorite Bollywood actors.

This movie had a window of opportunity in which it had a chance to be relevant, before the testosterone got in the way. As it is, MISSION ISTAANBUL ends up being merely a popcorn flick, flash over substance. But, then again, when it's this flashy, it's hard not to get hooked.
