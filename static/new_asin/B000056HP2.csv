1397280,5,B000056HP2,"From the outside, Dex is large, messy, and almost totally unmotivated (he does teach pre-school part-time), yet because of his undeniable cuteness and completely perfected Taoism on Sex and Relationships, he is **completely irresistible** to women. Well, to all the women in the world, except one. Guess Who he falls in love with!
The opening credits of ThE TAO oF STeVE are displayed against the spines of philosophy books on a bookshelf, a reference to the many philosophies which have been honed and perfected by Dex, in his quest to become the most irresistible guy possible. His philosophies, culminating in 'The Tao of Steve,' (based on the belief that every ""truly cool guy"" in the world has been named Steve, most notably Steve McQueen) which instructs its 'disciples' (a couple of Dex's friends who follow Dex's thoughts mainly because he is so damn successful with the ladies, they all agree he must be doing something right!!) to follow three golden rules, basically The Rules but for Men. And the prize isn't marriage and a mortgage, it's Sex. I think the main rule was ""We pursue that... which retreats from us."" He will say that, do some cute mannerism, then say something like, ""Think about it."" Hilarious.
The first major scene reveals Dex at his best, and, as we'll see, his worst. He's having hot, stand-up sex against a row of library books.... but it's with his friend's wife! (they are having an affair). As the scene pans out, we see that this is taking place during a college reunion while the rest of his friends are outside in the courtyard, milling about, drinks in hand, sun beating down. And we see that there's a girl out there, playing the drums, temporarily unaware of Dex and his current, er, activity. And we'll come to find out that, given a bit of time, and a few tugs on Dex's heart-strings, this not completely unfamiliar woman has got a thing or two to teach our hero... that no book or self-obsessed philosophy could ever accomplish!! It's all uphill from there.... well, you'll see. He might have a chance at True Love!!
A lot of the comic force of the movie comes from this look into our habits, and the Garfield-esque slouch which has resulted from Dex having so many bad ones. He's a smart guy, and he does have a conscience -- he knows what he should or shouldn't do... he just can't help himself, and he has no motivation to change. If anything, all these adoring women and fun times have pushed him in the other direction. That is, until he meets Syd, the drummer-girl with the looks, the brains, and the attitude to stop 10 Dex's dead in their tracks. This woman will NOT be played, and she won't settle for a guy whose habits involve eating whipped cream straight from the can (and sharing some with the dog(!)), being habitually late to everything, flirting incessantly with anything in a skirt, and, especially, sleeping with the wife of one of his best friends.
So....will true love prevail, and give our Dex the kick in the pants he needs to change his life? To go for the girl, and not just the chase?? Watch this fabulous movie, and see for yourself! (Hint, what's missing in predictability and plot is SO MUCH MORE THAN MADE UP FOR by the natural, glowing presence of the actors, and the amazingly funny dialogue. The director deserves much praise for her ability to create a realistic atmosphere and a warm, familiar mood among her actors. Top notch independent film material, this one.)
This is one of the funniest, smartest, natural, giddy, hilarious, classic films I have ever seen! There are so many good lines, I can't even stand it. It was filmed in New Mexico (Santa Fe), and as such the mood is warm, sunny, and light, complete with sunny interiors, patio parties, motorcycles, and desert scenes. At the Seattle International Film Festival, this film had people rolling in the aisles laughing. Rent it, Buy it, whatever... just SEE THIS MOVIE!!
You might recognize its rising star, the cutest red-haired round guy I've ever seen, Donal Logue, from his new Fox sitcom, ""Grounded For Life."" In my opinion, his skills are somewhat wasted in that series, but no matter, I'm sure we'll be seeing more and more of him as time goes on. Enjoy!",984268800,12,4199,4.698778833107191
1397281,5,B000056HP2,"Dex is an obese thirty-two year old who has figured out how to ""get"" women. Lots of them. How? He emulates his heroes, all Steves: Steve, the million dollar bionic man; (there's another Steve, but I can't remember! Darn!); and Steve McQueen who tries to escape the Nazis on his German motorcycle. With this ammunition, women can't resist him. Except Syd, a pretty and pretty-annoyed alumni he meets at his college 10th reunion. Why can't Dex charm Syd, and to what lengths will Dex go to try to woo her?

1397282,5,B000056HP2,"Men and women and the romantic things that happen between them is often the topic of movies, but they don't usually contain references to Lao Tzu, Heidegger, and Groucho Marx.  Donal Logue plays overweight kindergarten teacher Dex who possesses some incredibly unique views on dating.  His philosophy or ""Tao"" is that of ""Steve"".  He operates under the belief that the coolest men in our culture have been named Steve, the pinnacle of them being Steve McQueen.  Sound crazy?  It is.  TAO OF STEVE has those characteristics that make movies like Swingers and Mallrats so appealing.  It takes a look at dating and sex in a way you may not have heard before.  It's funny and intelligent and a great first attempt at a feature film for newcomer Jenniphr Goodman.  A refreshing, intellectual, romantic-comedy in the middle of low-brow humor like American Pie.  Take a chance, you won't be dissapointed.",978825600,9,897,4.959731543624161
1397283,4,B000056HP2,"Donal Logue is marvelous as the fat slacker Dex, who has perfected a system for attracting women (it's based on obtaining the pefect cool attitude of Steve McQueen.)  He meets up with beautiful Greer Goodman, who resists Dex's advances because of a secret she's hiding.  Shrewdly written comedy makes Dex a charismatic guy who nevertheless falls victim to his own intelligence--he outsmarts himself by focusing on the chase, and not the women who are the objects of his pursuit.  Goodman is terrific as a woman who at first appears too good to be true but knows more than she lets on.  When I saw this at the theater the audience was laughing so hard we missed some of the dialogue.  Highly recommended--it gives hope about the ladies to us guys who aren't exactly George Clooney.",977443200,6,780,4.7481481481481485
1397284,5,B000056HP2,"You remember the story of the little engine that could, well here's a little film that could...  Could just become one of your favorites that is.  Now just because it won the hears of those who saw it at The Sundance Film Festival doesn't mean it will blow you away.  It won't.
There's nothing in the film that will take your breath away, there are no special effects,and no big mystery  is solved.  Seeing this movie will not, I will repeat. will not change you life or cure the common cold, or lead to world peace.
This film is a wonderfully witty, smart, clever, funny and warm film about the mysteries of men and women and relationships as seen through the eyes of Dex.  Dex, we first meet at his 10th Annual college reunion, was the Don Juan of the campus.  He was Elvis.  Now, however he's added 150 pounds, and  a large basketball of a stomach to the package.  Guess what?  He's still a pretty busy guy when it comes to women.  He's having an affair with the wife of one of his college chums, he flirts incessantly and he coaches his mostly younger room-mates about how to get lucky using the Tao of Steve.  This basically means if you act like you don't want to get lucky, you probably will get lucky.  You never see people like Steve McQueen working too hard to get a women to go to bed with them, do you?  Or as Dex says: ""Remember and never forget this: We pursue that, which retreats from us.""
Dex doesn't have much ambition.  In fact at one point he's accused of being a slacker and he shrugs it off saying: ""You know doing stuff is over-rated.""  He works part time as a teacher in a pre-school.  Since he's a big kid himself, he does a great job playing with, and teaching the pre-schoolers.  It soon becomes clear that Dex is  self-indulgent, brilliant and utterly ill-equipped to have a real relationship with a women.  He can impress them, he can tell them exactly what they want to hear, he can please them, but he can't actually relate to women, because of course, he doesn't do a good job of relating to himself.  He's not quite sure what he wants, or who he is.  He's tried to find out, by reading lots of Kirkegaard, and Lao-tzu and Heidegger and others, but he's not found his center or the peace he needs.
Enter Syd. -- set designer for an opera company that is performing Don Giovanni at the reknowned Sante-Fe New Mexico Opera House.  Syd is staying with Dex's good friends.  They first meet at the college re-union party, and it turns out Syd and Dex were in the same Philosophy class together in college, but Dex doesn't remember her.  Syd seems to remember Dex pretty well though.
Dex's motorcycle breaks down, and soon Syd and Dex are sharing a truck to get them to work.  There's an attraction.  Dex is attracted and Syd is slightly repelled - or is she?
The surprises in the Tao of Steve aren't with what happens, but in how we get there.  The journey is all that counts in this movie.  The film is quiet, and simple but incredibly smart.  You've not witnessed such a well written  screenplay in a long, long time.  In fact the film is so deceptively simple and easy-going, you might wonder why there aren't films like this being made all the time. What's the big deal?  It's a pleasant amiable little movie and. . . .
Then hopefully you'll be struck by how many times you chuckled at the clever lines, or the little nuances that actors brought to their roles, or how wonderfully paced, and quietly directed the film is.  Director Goodman, wrote the screenplay with Duncan North.  Her sister Greer Goodman plays Syd , the films leading lady.  She's perfect for the role.  So is Donal Logue who is wonderfully charismatic as the over-weight, selfish, cunning, but still likeable and charming, Dex.  Everything works seamlessly in this film - and then you realize what a rarity that really is.  It's a much better debut for Director and co-writer Jeniphr Goodman than say Sex Lies and Videotape was for Steven (Out of Sight, The Limey, Erin B.) Soderbergh.  The film is better than those whose footsteps it treads in, beginning with Blume in Love, Soup for One, and failures like Windy City or About Last Night (who's source material, David Mamet's Sexual Perversity in Chicago should have made a film as good as this one-but never has).  It is certainly not a film that tries to be a Moonstruck, Murphy's Romance, or even When Harry Met Sally.  It's comedy and cleverness comes from it's characters rhythms.  Even Woody Allen's Annie Hall wasn't as down to earth or naturally warm  as this film is.  You might even come to realize how the film isn't quite like anything you've seen before, making it an original in a genre you would think impossible to be original in (romantic comedy).
I suppose that might be considered a bad thing by some.  The film doesn't go too far to get attention, and it never gets cloying or overly-sentimental.  There's no last reel incurable disease which turns the tale into a tragedy either.  There are people who want their films to be roller-coaster rides, or give them some emotional tugs and make them cry.  This film is too smart to do that, and I appreciated that.  What's perhaps amazing is the fact the film-makers have made a film so simple and seemingly done so, so effortlessly, you really do wonder why films like this aren't being made on a regular basis.  The reason is, it's nearly impossible for everything to come together so seamlessly to create a film like this.
The little movie that could: The Tao of Steve.

 Prior to writing and filming 'The Tao of Steve', director Jenniphr Goodman returned to her childhood home in Santa Fe with her husband after graduating from NYU Film School. There she also lived with one Duncan North, a kindergarten teacher the film is based on. Goodman could not believe how North was able to seduce so many women, given the fact that he was overweight and did not fit the mold of a typical Lothario. She decided to create 'The Tao of Steve' based on North's life, including how he utilized Taoist philosophy and combined it with American pop culture's embrace of a trinity of 'machismo' TV characters including Steve Austin (The Six Million Dollar Man), Steve McGarrett (Hawaii Five-O) and, above all, the ultimate 'bad boy' actor, Steve McQueen.

Duncan North is dubbed 'Dex' in the film and is played by Donal Logue, an Irish actor who gained significant weight for the role. Logue is perfectly cast as the unlikely seducer of women and the philosophy his character imparts, is a textbook method for being successful with women. The best part of the film involves how he attempts to coach one of his slacker buddies, Dave, who is completely inept when it comes to finding a girlfriend. Dave believes that if he's simply a 'nice guy', women will be immediately drawn to him. Dex makes it clear that 'nice guys finish last' when it comes to seducing women. He introduces this three part plan of action with women (which Dave initially rejects): 1) suppress your desire to get her into bed; 2) be 'excellent' in her presence and 3) Just when things appear to be going good--retreat!

What's great about 'Dex' is that he first has developed a skill that many men would like to have (the art of seduction) but are unable to follow through on. Dex is so good at what he does, that he eventually has to reject a married woman who becomes infatuated with him. Unfortunately for Dex, the woman is married to his best friend, who ends up slugging him in the face when he finds out about his wife's infidelity.

Dex finally meets his match in Syd, a set designer who was one of Dex's conquests back in their college days. The fact that Dex can't even remember that he bedded Syd way back then, becomes a sore point in their relationship. Nonetheless, love conquers all after Dex realizes that a deeper relationship with a woman beats simply seducing them, ad infinitum.

'The Tao of Steve' is a rare example of an 'indie' film that works! The dialogue is on a high intellectual level (replete with literary references) and the plot is not only entertaining, but educational for clueless males. Greer Goodman, Jenniphr's sister, who plays Syd, is an excellent foil to the cad, Dex. Special mention must go to James 'Kimo' Wills, who plays the 'in the dark' Dave. Tao's ending is a bit sentimental and I wonder if Duncan North actually ended up with a 'love of his life', but you'll nonetheless be impressed with what first time feature director Jenniphr Goodman has done, fashioning a narrative that is both fanciful and decidedly true to life.",1417996800,,3096,4.702952029520295

Anyway, THE TAO OF STEVE makes me think of what I've heard about Marx Brothers comedies, where in an attempt to add socially redeeming value to the none-stop silliness, the movie studio insisted on a love story subplot.  THE TAO OF STEVE works as the most anti-love story about the boy-girl game but undermines its own premise by having protagonist Dexter, who teaches an unsophisticated friend to extinguish his desire from women because it's the only way for an average guy to get one, spend the whole film breaking his own rule by putting his heart on his sleeve for a woman who doesn't feel the same about him.  It's as if the original TAO OF STEVE script, just about Dexter schooling his buddy on winning girls with reverse psychology, was watered down by the producer to include a love story in order to appeal to female filmgoers.

I wonder if the creators of THE HANGOVER named that film's milquetoast character Stu in honor of THE TAO OF STEVE, as Dexter explains the opposite of a ""Steve,"" the ultimate cool guy, is a ""Stu.""

I hung in there even though THE TAO OF STEVE betrays its thesis, wondering if it would surprise me in the end.  While I won't blow what happens, I will say THE TAO OF STEVE offers enough of interest to make up for the opportunity it lets slip by.",1385769600,,1474,4.606870229007634

1397425,5,B000056HP2,"This is one of the funniest romantic comedies ever. It is a more authentic representation of the dynamics between men and women than the typical Hollywood farce. The male protagonist is Dex, an underachieving and overweight guy who lives his life by doing the absolute minimum required to get by. One of the great quotes from the movie is ""Doing stuff is overrated."" Dex lives his life by three simple rules i.e. the Tao of Steve or Dex's rules for picking up chicks:

1. Eliminate your desires.

2. Do something excellent in her presence, thereby proving your sexual worthiness.

3. Retreat, for as Heidegger said, ""We pursue that which retreats from us"".

Living with a group of guys they spends there time playing Frisbee golf. And throughout the movie Dex instructs Dave, one of his room mates in his house on how to get sex from a certain girl. The interaction in itself is hilarious because Dex is the all-knowing, almost guru like person, while Dave is a hapless, clueless guy who gets excited just at the thought of being with a girl who likes him.

For me the take away from this film is that being ourselves is sometimes not enough. We have to be our best selves. And in fact Taoism allows you to live in the moment - be in the moment and therefore bring out the best in yourself. And ultimately when you are happy with who you are - in love with yourself - love your own life as it is - that is the ultimate reality. To finish of as Lao Tzu said, ""If you desire nothing. You loose nothing.""",1174089600,5,1501,4.423913043478261

1397432,4,B000056HP2,"The Tao of Steve is about as unique a film as you'll find. In many ways, it is halfway to being a chick flick, but it offers far more than anything found within that hackneyed entertainment genre. The story of Dex, and the way in which a fat, ganja inhaling, going nowhere, loser of a man can be a pickup artist is one both endearing and strangely believable. Although, in actuality, he is a little over the top. I think for him to be a skilled Lothario he would need to be unattractive OR devoid of status, but definitely not both. With those two major strikes against him it is very unlikely that Dex's Tao, or way, to sexual enlightenment would ever come about. Yet there are a multitude of truths on display within this short celluloid adventure.

Do we actually ""pursue that which runs away?"" Well women certainly seem to. Dex captivates them by saying things like ""Whoa Speed Racer"" when they try to take off his clothes and ""I don't want to ruin the friendship"" in response to a college girl insinuating they were on a date. For many men though, it's cannot be the same way. Unreciprocated pursuit places you into the poor house or the mental hospital. It's tough to rationalize spending a fortune on a girl who's completely disinterested in you. Of course, the movie is not a condensed female psychology seminar.

1397433,4,B000056HP2,"I've seen Donal Logue in a number of things (I first saw him in the mid 90's on MTV as a greasy cab driver), most notably the first Blade (1998) film and the TV show `Grounded for Life' (which is actually pretty good, although I'm unsure if it is still on the air), and he's always been a hefty fellow, but seeing him in The Tao of Steve (2000) set me back a little as it looked like he really packed on the weight, complete with distended gut and all.  Was it for the film?  Or just perhaps something due to his particular lifestyle at the time?  I don't know, and I suppose it doesn't really matter, but what I do know is I liked this film, even if his character wasn't particularly likeable.  Co-written by Duncan North, Greer Goodman (who also has a starring role), and Jenniphr Goodman (who is also the director), the film stars, as I already mentioned, Donal Logue and Greer Goodman.  Also appearing is James 'Kimo' Wills (Buffalo Soldiers), Ayelet Kaznelson (Four Lane Highway), and David Aaron Baker (Kissing Jessica Stein).

First off I think it's important to mention there is no character in this film named `Steve'.  The main character is named Dex, and played by Logue.  Dex is an overweight, educated, intelligent, philosophizing, unattractive, part-time working lump of a human being with seemingly little ambition other than to get into women's pants.  To this regard, he has developed what he calls the `Tao of Steve', which consists of three main aspects when it comes to dealing with women.  As far as the `Steve' part, that relates to the  `coolness' exhibited by popular cultural icons that are named Steve, like Steve McQueen, Steve Austin (The Six Million Dollar Man), and Steve McGarrett, from the Hawaii 5-0 TV show...in other words, the epitome of coolness, for some at least...anyway, back to the three main aspects...the first is to eliminate all desire, especially for those who don't have the physical attributes of say, an Adonis...this entails not letting a woman know how much you want to nail her.  Apparently women can smell desperation, but if you show no interest in her, she may begin to wonder, being that she is really hot and way out of your league, why don't you want her?  All women have insecurities, and this seems a roundabout way to capitalize on them...the 2nd aspect, once you've eliminated desire, is to be excellent...not in general, but do something in front of the woman you want to get with to show her you have a quality worthy of her giving `it' up.  The 3rd and final aspect is to retreat...meaning, once you've hooked her, back off and let her come to you.  This gives her the assumption that she has the power and is dictating when the time for the horizontal shimmy is appropriate.  Using this simple philosophy, along with a whole lot of BS, Dex is able to score much more regularly despite his slovenly physical nature would normally allow for...and this is working well until he meets Syd (Goodman), a woman Dex begins to see as real, flesh and blood individual rather than just another possible conquest.

Okay, the character of Dex isn't particularly likeable to most of us, given his manipulative nature and seemingly superficial views on women and relationships in general, but he's still fun to watch.  There is an underlying theme throughout of Dex utilizing the inherent complexities (and insecurities) of women in order to bed them, which is dealt with under the justification that since Dex is not, or will never be, a pretty boy, he must find some other tactics to achieve his goals.  I don't think there are many of us who haven't employed any one of his theories at one time or another, the difference being Dex just happens to have developed and refined them to the point of actually being a workable system.  Most important is how it is applied to the particular individual (in this case Dex), and that individual having an understanding of his own capabilities and/or limitations.  The story is really nothing new, a somewhat slick BS artist set in his ways coming up against someone who draws forth feelings and desires that go further than what he is accustom to, and subsequently has difficulty in dealing with the revelation of his true, core being, that of someone who actually may be human, but the way the story is told is a little different than what I was used to...there's a realistic element involved, in that Logue isn't a Robert Downey Hollywood sort (Downey has done a number of roles like this), and the catalyst in the character of Syd is certainly beautiful, but not necessarily unobtainable.  She's also intelligent enough to perceive a certain amount of BS when presented to her, and Dex realizes this very soon after he delivers his standard attempts, to which he quickly admits thus to Syd, perhaps in an effort to say, `Yes, I am a despicable fellow, but not so much with you as you're so different than any of those I've encountered before.'  Dex doesn't really come off as an endearing sort throughout the film, but we do see sort of an `awakening', a self realization that life is not a series of simplistic encounters and a serious, complex relationship is something worth having and maintaining.  Did I mention this is a comedy?  Because it sounds, from my review, I am making this out to be something other than it is...overall I think this is a film comprised of a couple of different levels, one that works as a comedy, but also features the underlying aspects I mentioned above, both of which come together nicely at the end.

The anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) picture on this DVD comes through nicely, as does the Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo.  Special features include a commentary track from director Jenniphr Goodman, actress Greer Goodman, actor Donal Logue, and writer Duncan North, along with talent files and trailers for other films Logue has appeared in, including Jerry McGuire (1996), The Patriot (2000), and this film.

I think it catches so much of the dynamic of that late twenties to mid-thirties single crowd. College is over, sure the same tricks work on college girls and unhappy housewives but you've got to grow up eventually.

Such is the story of Dex and Sid. Dex can still reel in the college girls, but come on that's like shooting fish in a barrel. That smart 30 something is a different story. I'm not going to spoil anything here just check it out for yourself.

Some reviewers seem to think it was a movie about frisbee golf, I guess if you didn't get it then the movie was way to smart for you. Who cares how Dex threw the frisbee Stu, Rocky had terrible form in the ring and Mojo didn't play for the Texas State title in 88. Get over it, pretend for a minute you're an adult and try to understand the story.

Anyway, I think you'd be a fool not to watch this movie. In fact buy the movie, buy the soundtrack, embrace the Tao of Steve.

1397436,4,B000056HP2,"This film was obviously made by recent liberal arts graduates: it's chock full of references and quotations to Lao-Tzu, Buddha, Heidegger, Kierkegaard, and other philosophical heavies.

On one hand, it very deftly unfolds Taoism as applied to the realm of dating: the idea is that if guys didn't so blatantly lust after and work so hard plotting to seduce women, they'd bag a lot more of them.  Dex recommends that men step back from their overwhelming physical desires and just FLOW with the women they're with in the moment and WHAM before they know it, they'll be boinking like rabbits.

Contrary to the marketing-driven advice of mens' magazines like GQ, Details, Esquire, Men's Fitness, et. al. you DON'T need to look like Brad Pitt, have perfect looks, muscles, clothes, cologne, car, schlong, or anything else their advertisers are seling.  Of course these things don't hurt, but they're not ESSENTIAL.  It's all about smoothness, a.k.a. FLOW.

All the above is good and dandy, and the directors say they've gleaned this info off of a real-life less-than-handsome Cassanova named Duncan (forgot his last name) who does appear briefly in a cameo.  You find out all this when you watch the DVD again with the cast/director's commentary on---usually this bores me to tears but with this film it was well worth it, since you find out just how personal and intimate of a production this film really was, most of the cast is either related to each other or knew each other in real life beforehand in some way.  Plus Duncan speaks on the commentary track too.

Where the film finally gets pulled back into the dreary confines of ""conventional"" wisdom is at the end, when the male protagonist decides that he's finally met The One woman for whom he'll abdicate his effortless womanizing habits once and for all.  Why?  For no other apparent reason than necessity---because that's the only way she'll have him, and he really really really wants to be with her, so he'll bite the bullet and get on the wagon.

This retreat into cliche was the only disappointment in the movie.  It didn't have to be cliche---the same sort of philosophers that Dex used to inspire his womanizing genius could've easily been reinterpreted to inspire his cessation of womanizing.  So this last minute conversion, while certainly not as drawn out and cheesy as a major Hollywood production would've made it, is still a bit unsatisfying.

While the core of the movie revolves around the simplistic Taoist rules for getting women employed by the hero, Dex, and their apparent destruction at the hands of ""true love"" with heroine Syd, there is a curious twist that actually reinforces the Tao of Steve.
MAJOR SPOILER FOLLOWS.......
Consider the actions of Syd. She:
1) loses her desire for Dex. (10 years of loathing after their one night stand took their toll.)
2) shows her excellence in his precense (playing the drums, remember?)
and, then after an hour of screen time full of assorted machinations, she:
3) splits for New York!
So the _real_ message is that the Tao of Steve can not only work for overweight men, but for women as well.

So far it's worked for Dex, but when he runs into an old college acquaintance at a reunion, he may have finally found someone immune to the Tao of Steve.
Dex is played by Donal Logue, from the very funny sitcom GROUNDED FOR LIFE.  He's charismatic and likable despite flaws (who hasn't got them, after all?)  Much of the rest of the cast is composed of friends and family of the director/co-writer, which gives the movie a natural, unscripted feel.

It's a romantic comedy, but with the freshness that indie films seem so much more capable of than Hollywood productions.  It's light; it won't have you on the floor with laughter, nor will it touch you deeply, but it is a wholly enjoyable little film, and one which I would recommend.

1397441,5,B000056HP2,"The Tao of Steve is one of those rare movies that truthfully captures the essense of modern life, or in this case, modern single-guy life.  I could tell you every plot detail, every bit of dialog in this film, and I still couldn't ruin it.  It expresses and confirms many of those common, unspoken things that you knew were there all along.  Girls will watch the film in disbelieve, while their boyfriends are quietly taking notes.
The title doesn't refer to any one character in the movie, but rather the mystique of the quintiessential American Guy (aka, ""Steve"") who is cool and hip and gets all the girls without even trying.  Main character Dex is the embodyment of the Tao, as he has many, many beautiful girlfriends despite being rather portly, unkept, and a loser in professional life.  Sheer personality and cunning allow Dex to figure out women and win their affection (or specifically, to have sex with them).  The film's plot revolves around his (successful) struggle to win one non-responsive girl in particular (named Syd), and also explain to his guy friends how the master gets the job done.
The rules of the Tao of Steve are simple yet easily misunderstood, and the film does a great job of fleshing them out into something real and concrete.  Dex's ""conquest"" of Syd is especially fun to watch because it realistically twists and turns throughout the movie, and you'll appriciate the ""dorky guy"" character who, while watching from the sidelines, asks all the stupid ""what if"" questions you've ever wanted answered.
I was amused that the ending was so obviously sanitized for the ladies.  Basically, Dex falls in love and denounces the Tao, thus ""changing"" for his girl and giving us a ""happily-ever-after"" ending; girls in the audience might be tempted to believe that guys don't really embrace this womanizing, sexist view of life that basically disempowers them. Sadly, ladies, the Tao is very real and does not go away after true-love.  It also reminds me that the film's core essense can only be understood by guys.
Also, this ""clean"" ending isn't really needed, as the men in the film aren't all powerful, and the women aren't weak and clueless.  In fact, the movie's charm comes from its character and contradictions, how Dex sometimes talks too much, how heis sometimes completely transparent, how Syd is herself not a towering temple of womanhood, either.  Perhaps the Hollywood ending is there is remind us that a) the Tao can only get you so far, and b) there are somethings that the sexes will never understand about each other.",1034121600,12,2557,4.855172413793103

No offense Cruise or Crowe fans....

1397444,5,B000056HP2,"One of the great things about an enjoyable independent film is that because of the nature of the beast (budgetary restraints) you can usually expect that the things which make the film enjoyable are the basics : good dialogue, good acting, good direction. ""The Tao of Steve"" has all of these elements, in addition to a fabulous, under used setting in the earth and sky elements which dominate the city of Santa Fe, New Mexico.
Religious allusions are some of the most popular allusions in all of film and they are abundant in this one. Everything from Buddhism to Taoism to Nihlism to Catholicism is touched upon. It is all done with a degree of both cynicism and reverence. One of the most enjoyable aspects of the film is the intelligence of the writing. The script uses a group of well educated men in their early thirties to illustrate how concepts of ancient religions can be interspersed with ideas of pop culture and courtship in the twentieth century to create a way of life which leads one to the end they desire. Although this works for them for a time, eventually this idea is shown to lead one to what they believe they desire but to fulfill only the most basic of needs. The concept is eventually dismantled through character interaction and dialogue, some of the best examples of the two seen on film in recent years. Particularly impressive is the way the script has one character build up these ideas using the ideas of great writers, thinkers, and religious figures from the past while another character can strike them down with references which are just as literary and relevant. The most impressive part is that these intellectual debates never come off as pretentious, we never feel that the any of the characters are speaking over our heads. With all of the philosophical knowledge that is thrown at us Dex is still our everyman, Syd is still the girl we all had class with in college.
The setting is integral to the story, and the cinematography works to convey the philosohpies which are being addressed. In Santa Fe houses work themselves into the landscape, at the opera Dex's shirt blends him into the scenery, everything in the film blends together and it helps to convey that everything in the world is interelated, no matter how important we think we are we're all a part of the whole. This intergral lesson is what Dex must learn to achieve his goal, and it is conveyed perfectly throughout the film through the cinematography.
In reading the credits one can see the interelatedness of the people who produced this movie and the personal story that the screenwriter told through his script. Watching this film is like having your closest friends over for dinner, sharing your memories and stories of your current lives. The fact that it opens at a reunion is not an accident, and it carries that feeling of warmth, apprehension and coming home throughout. When I finished watching ""The Tao of Steve"" I wanted to hit rewind and watch the whole thing over again. It is rare that a film encapsulates a feeling of home and at the same time of such grand philosophical truths. But it is the familiarity of the characters which makes these truths and ideas easy to digest, and ""The Tao of Steve"" such a likeable, easy to watch, thought provoking film.
This film reminded me of ""Committed"" starring Heather Graham in some ways, with similar settings, similar mystical themes and a feeling of redemption at the end. I would say that ""The Tao of Steve"" is a better film though because it tells the story in a much more simple, straightforward manner. There is no place in this film for a viewer to get lost, but when given deeper thought, there are incredible areas set up for the viewer to explore.",1021075200,6,3721,4.691131498470948
1397445,4,B000056HP2,"A running time of under 90 minutes is perfect for this new take on the oft-played slacker meets love theme.  Dex's Tao, stripped of its multi-cultural philosophical trappings, is simple--don't look interested and when they fall don't get involved.  It is also, of course, bullbleep, which he naturally realizes just before the final credits roll.  In other words, nothing new or particularly surprising emerges as we watch the developing romance of Dex and Syd.  But, to throw my own philosophical shaggy dog into the mix, it is the journey not the end that matters and The Tao of Steve gives a good journey for your time. The dialogue is sharp, fast, and intelligent.  Real people do talk like this. For example, when Dex and Syd have to commute together because Dex's motorcycle gives up the ghost, Syd puts together a spreadsheet of their not too congruent schedules and Dex quips, ""How Marcia Brady of you."" The Goodmans capture Dex's household of slacker buddies and their life style perfectly.  Here I particularly liked the periodic trips to the roof to retrieve errant frisbees.  The views of the Santa Fe area, most often shot as distant backdrops to ongoing scenes, are spectacular.  Most important, perhaps, this movie is smart enough, unlike many other of the slacker genre (e.g. practically anything with Ethan Hawke or Christian Slater) not to take itself too seriously or claim to be more than what it is -- an fast-moving and witty entertainment.",1009843200,5,1462,4.938775510204081

His easy-going life includes joyful employment as a part-time teacher in a kindergarden, a cadre of admiring friends -- including a Tao trainee -- gorgeous country, and ample proof of just how well The Tao works in the collection of Dex-groupies. We should all have it so good, right? Well, not so fast. See, Dex is not the only smart one in this movie.
Director Jenniphr Goodman and her sister and co-star, Greer Goodman, who wrote the script between them, have plenty of intelligent things to say and show as well. From the earthy tones of Santa Fe to the witty repartee and bulls-eye casting, this is one terrific and smart romantic-comedy.
Oh, did I mention how much I liked the soundtrack? :o)",1005436800,3,931,4.717791411042945
1397449,4,B000056HP2,"Before I begin, I should probably acknowledge that all that I understand about women, dating,
relationships between men and women, and sex in general can comfortably be written on the the head
of a pin with room left over for a whole passel of angels to dance upon.  So my comments on a film
whose main concern is the ""Merry War"" (Orwell's felicitous phrase) between men and women should
be taken with an even larger grain of salt than usual.
At any rate, in a film which sisters Jenniphr and Greer Goodman based on a friend (co-writer Duncan
North), Donal Logue plays a slovenly, bong loving, philosophy major, who, now ten years out of
college, is a kindergarten-teaching sybarite, whose improbable continued success at bedding women,
including a friend's wife, makes him the philosopher king of his group of housemates and hangers-on.
As such he expounds upon his method for hooking up with babes, a series of shallow, though amusing,
maxims that he's dressed up as ""The Tao of Steve"".  Named for a group of ultracool guys from the
70s--Steve McGarrett (of Hawaii Five-O), Steve Austin (The Six Million Dollar Man), and the
ultimate Steve, Steve McQueen--the Tao boils down to three rules to follow when pursuing women :
  (1)  Eliminate your desire.  (Which basically suggests that you pretend you aren't trying to get
  your hood waxed.)
  (2)  Do something excellent in your target's presence.  (Typically this might include playing pool
  in a barroom setting, but in Dex's case consists of showing off intellectually and being good
  with the kids he teaches.)
  (3)  and, Retreat.  (Prior generations would have called this ""playing hard to get."")
God only knows, if even he does, what makes certain men successful with women, but one thing is
reasonably certain : it isn't the Tao of Steve.  Instead, as both the time that Dex put into developing his
theories and his obsession with sex tend to prove, it's really just a matter of effort and willingness.
Persistence, to the exclusion of pride and decency, and the acceptance, of whatever's offered, those are
the real keys.  Dex, though he is charming in a roguish kind of way (in what should by all rights be a
star-making turn by Logue), resembles the babe hounds we all know, or knew, in just that one way; for
all his talk of desirelessness and retreat, he works really hard at scamming babes, to the point where he
doesn't really have time for much else.
That is until he meets Syd, a pretty, blonde, stage set designer, at their 10th college reunion and she
proves maddeningly immune to his charms.  At one point when he starts pontificating about Don Juan,
she says  that he :
  ...slept with thousands of women because he was afraid that he would never be loved by one.
In his increasingly desperate pursuit of her, Dex pretty much ignores all of his own rules--his desire is
manifest; he humiliates himself on a camping trip and gets beaten up by the cuckolded husband; and he
is omnipresent--but still, inevitably, gets the girl.  Holding her however proves to be far more difficult,
particularly when she finds out about the Tao, and Dex is forced to choose between an adult
relationship with a woman he loves, or a continuation of his rather infantile existence.  You'll not have
difficulty guessing which he chooses.
All of this is exactly as predictable as it sounds in the retelling, but it somehow works.  The film has a
few things going for it.  First, the script is intelligent and frequently funny, not in a pretentious and
intellectual way, but in the manner of late night conversation around a beer tap.  It may not hold
together too well when exposed to the light of day, but it's amusing while it lasts.  Second, there's
Donal Logue.  Dex is so cretinous that it is impossible to like him all of the time, or even much of the
time, but Logue is so charming that it's equally hard to truly dislike him.  Lurking beneath the layers of
fat, the clouds of pot, the erudite facade, and the saccharine exterior, we sense there's a worthwhile
fellow trapped within his own immaturity and selfishness.  Third, the New Mexico setting and the
excellent soundtrack help to give the film a strong and unusual identity, a distinctness that the
somewhat overfamiliar story does not have.
Finally though, what makes the film stand out is something that probably shouldn't, that it requires its
main character to become a better person.  The blockbusterization of Hollywood--which has largely
substituted action and special effects for plot, dialogue, and character development--and the chicness of
the independent industry--which has elevated snappy dialogue and sensational plots over all else--and
the blanket of political correctness which has descended over both, have brought us to the point where
the rarest of all things in the movies is a traditional moral tale like this one.  How old-fashioned to
offer us a movie where a smart but smarmy ladies man is transformed by the love of a good woman--it
sounds more like a Rock Hudson/Doris Day vehicle than a Sundance entry, doesn't it?
One social phenomenon that you'd like to think started beforehand but which has at least accelerated
since the events of September 11th is the search for entertainment that's actually about something.  The
next time you're in the video store, and the concept of watching the latest explosion fest or inane
comedy is unimaginable, try to find The Tao of Steve, it's well worth your effort.

Perhaps I'm the first reviewer to notice, but I strongly suspect that this film is biographical.  Watching it for the first time with my then girlfriend, I was embarrassed that she should see it until I realized that no connection could be proven between myself and the main character, Dex: a lovably conceited, overweight berk who uses his superior intellect and twisted view of both Chinese and western philosophy to manipulate those around him until finding that the greater strength is in controlling oneself, embracing uncertainty, and living through love.  Some of the dialogue in the film is clunky, but no more so than real life.  Watch this movie on more than one level, or don't watch it at all.  This is strictly for the the thinking person, and probably more enjoyable to those with at least a passing knowledge of modern American pop culture, philosophy, and dating.  The movie gives one some things to think about, without shoving dogma down the viewer's throat.

1397451,3,B000056HP2,"I suspect the reason for the obese lothario was to fool the audience into overlooking the genericness and over-familiarity of the story.  The film is oddly anachronistic too.  It seems like a relic of the early to mid 90's era when films like ""Kicking and Screaming"", ""Slacker"", ""Singles"", ""Clerks"", etc. were being made.  Are there Gen-X'ers who still find literature and philosophy sexy?  It seems to me that Donal Logue's Dex, no matter how likeable he is, would be quite the Stu when put up against all the management and finance graduates with their SUVs and cell-phones.  However, the film is made with such enthusiasm and because it practically exudes goodwill, I allowed myself to be fooled and I found myself rooting for Dex.  There's not many memorable moments, or even highlights for that matter, in the film.  It's much like spending time with your dorky, goofy, slacker friends.  It's inconsequential fun in-between the important stuff you've got to deal with in real life.  Wait, I do remember one particular moment distinctly.  There was one unexpected moment in which real pathos struck me and I think Goodman would have been better off if she had aborted Dex's story and instead followed the snubbed waitress Dex once slept with but whose name he has long forgotten.

1397453,2,B000056HP2,"This movie was extraordinarily overrated. I looked forward to seeing it since last summer, since I had read a lot of positive reviews about the film, and since I like what little I have seen of Donal Logue (notably the excellent cab driver he used to play in MTV spots- his own brainchild, no less). Boy, was I disappointed.
I think self-described ""discriminating filmgoers"" and reviewers both tend to be wowed by films that lack action sequences and feature lots of dialogue and sharp one-liners. However, that alone does not make a great movie. For one, I had a lot of trouble believing that a guy like Dex was capable of spouting off the kind of philosophical gibberish that he did throughout the film. Secondly, even if you buy the premise that Dex is a thinking-man's stoner who is well-read and deep, you don't like him any more because of it. His spiels about bedding women and enlightenment were really, really boring, and would have sounded more genuine from a man half his age. And the cultish way in which Dex and his buddies followed the tenets repeated throughout the movie, as well as their allegiance to Steves, reminded me of that epidemic of ""Men's shows"" (like The Man Show, and that one hosted by Frank Zappa's son) that try to promulgate what is cool and macho. Another reviewer herein appropriately mentioned ""Swingers, "" which I also hated for many reasons, including its attempt to write the script for what was cool without worrying about any accompanying storyline, plot, or redeeming characters. ""Tao of Steve"" is like that- the story seems to have quickly originated from someone's ""Cool List,"" without form.
There were so many other things that were tough to swallow in this movie: There is no way that Syd would fall for Dex, even if you discount his obesity, his arrogance, his lying, his transparency, and the fact that he doesn't remember he slept with her in college. Her about-face which results in their ultimately hooking up came out of the blue, seemingly just because he expressed that he was falling for her. Also, Dex was obnoxious. A vastly overused tool of movies is to make a lug seem like a decent guy by showing him surrounded by kids (e.g., Happy, Texas; Billy Madison), and this film employs that device in spades. Dex's good-guy buddy was annoying, too, and yet he predictably followed Dex's code and got the girl.
The worst thing about this movie is the quoting it inevitably has engendered from the same knuckle-headed guys who knew (and repeated) every line of Swingers.",999129600,7,2521,4.77116704805492
1397454,4,B000056HP2,"There is more to this movie than ""indie"" cliches and ""boy gets girl"".  Dex is working straight out of Soren Kierkegaard's ""Seducer's Diary"": the ultimate story about the manipulation of human desire.  Kierkegaard is one of the greatest Western philosphers of the mid 1800's whose descriptions of irony and the transience of humnan love and relationships are still entirely relevant, providing amazing insight into thirtysomething culture.  Everything written about relationships since Kierkegaard (mid 1800's) has pretty much been a footnote.

1397456,1,B000056HP2,"OK, stop me if you've heard this before, because I sure have. The Tao of Steve is a film about an overeducated, overconfident and underachieving thirtysomething who, unsatisfied with the world of easy women and modern-day relationships, decides to pursue a girl, who - gasp - actually rejects his romantic pursuits at first, then gives in to his charm (?) and despite a few rough spots, they find love...or do they? Original, right? The mood says ""indie"" but the plot reads as if it was written by a college freshman in Creative Writing 101 after plagarizing his textbook for a story idea.
Unlike most romantic comedies in this vein where the hero is a lovable loser, the main character in this film is an actual loser - a loathsome jerk with few redeeming qualities. I would find it hard to believe that the audience can or would identify with the guy.  He reminded me a bit of the Star Trek-loving owner of the comic book shop in ""The Simpsons.""  The writer & director try to give the main character some of that indie film 'edginess' (see ""Swingers"") by having him quote one-liners about dating and modern-day relationships from Eastern philosophy, but they all come off as cliched and forced and are destined to be repeated in internet chat rooms and college campuses across America. Same with the fascination with 1970s lowbrow pop culture (OK, Steve McQueen was big in the 60s). C'mon, it was done almost 10 years before with the Brady Movie!

1397458,3,B000056HP2,"The Tao of Steve lies firmly in the movie tradition of ""irascible but lovable girl-scamming scamp grows up and falls in love"".  What sets it apart are its (flimsy) philosophical underpinnings, its unusual location (Santa Fe, which deserves a co-billing), and a hard-to-define ""freshness"" that characterizes the film, its leads, and its actors.
""Viewer from Brooklyn"" (below) pans the script and direction; and, indeed, both are clumsy.  However, ""viewer from Brooklyn"" recommends that Jenniphr Goodman (director) attend film school -- ironically, he is clearly not aware that she graduated, with honors, from New York University's Graduate Film School.
The main character, ""Dex"", is based strongly on the life and personality of the co-writer, Duncan North.  North is a graduate of St. John's College (of both Santa Fe and Annapolis), a very unusual liberal arts college whose curriculum is based entirely on the so-called ""Great Books"" canon.  (This reviewer is also an alum of the college.)
SJC is never referred to directly, which is a pity because some information about Dex's unusual education -- and the social milieu that he's a part of as a result -- might have better explained Dex's unusually erudite and philosophically oriented world-view.  Large ideas and significant quotes persist throughout the film (though almost always presented in a lighthearted manner), and there's no doubt that this will have an effect on how one views and enjoys this film.  For many, it will seem insufferably pretentious.
On the other hand, the college itself and its alumni might all be grateful for the lack of identification: Dex's erudition seems to be put exclusively to the task of cocktail-party (and poker party) chatter, intellectual sexual come-ons, and general puffery.  Furthermore, the erudition seems all-too-shallow, as if Dex's primary source was the Reader's Digest version of Mortimer Adler's ""Great Ideas"".  Whether this is representative of Duncan North himself, I don't know, but it certainly is not representative of the college or its alumni.
The fact remains, however, that ultimately Dex's only real charm is his unabashedly childish (and very Taoist) love of being a kindergarten teacher.  This part of Dex is perhaps the only evidence that there's a part of himself that is truly engaged with the world, that perhaps takes these great ideas earnestly and with good nature, and that there is, in the end, a reason for a woman to fall in love with him.
All in all, ""The Tao of Steve"" is itself a gem-in-the-rough.  It's a film of scattered pieces, some of which are attractive and valuable, others of which are fool's gold, (and still others of which are just plain old rocks).  Like Dex, the film has within itself something beautiful and important to reveal, and yet cannot truly do so because of a certain preoccupation with superficiality due to the imperatives of insecurity.

He certainly doesn't fit the ""romantic lead"" like Richard Gere, but he does stand out.  He's the type of guy us normal women would date seeing as Richard Gere would just be way out of our league.  The title of the movie is based on the way Dex ""gets"" women to go for him, and ""Steve"" is for all the cool Steves, the coolest being STeve McQueen.  He's trying to be cool, trying not to let these women know his ulterior motives or motive. This movie was very entertaining.  Despite The brooklyn reviewer's opinion, I thought the movie was well written.  It was like listening to any guy talk of his ways to get women whether it involves isms' or not.

1397460,5,B000056HP2,"This has got to be the best movie nobody has heard about. Dex and his friends have perfected what they call the ""Tao of Steve"" as a way of winning over one-night stands. They define every male basically as belonging to one of two categories:
1. Steve. These are the guys you emulate by showing up, being excellent in a girl's presence, and getting the heck out. The way Dex describes it to one of his friends, men can only wait five minutes before hitting on a woman. Women, on the other hand, can wait ten minutes. So Steves wait it out so they become the chased, rather than chasing women and looking like fools.
2. Stu. These are the fools. They come on way too strong to women. The only way they see action is through pressing a woman into it. No glory here. Dex names people like Gomer Pile as a-list Stus.
The movie then shows how although Dex's rules are awesome for the single guy on the prowl, the [...] games don't work when you want to be honest and true to a girl you really care about. Dex pleasently breaks all of his own rules and looks noble doing it!
The icing on this movie is that it is so incredibly true. If I were five years younger when I saw this movie, it probably would've changed my life. It also explains (somewhat) to my satisfaction why guys who have a girlfriend/fiancee/wife always seem to get hit on when they go out with their friends. It's because they don't give a rip about women, and that perplexes the fairer sex. Watch this movie, then admire your friends who are Steves and laugh at the Stus.",988156800,4,1533,4.307958477508651
