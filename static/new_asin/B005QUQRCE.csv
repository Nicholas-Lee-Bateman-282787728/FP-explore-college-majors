4860134,4,B005QUQRCE,"Having previously bought Jackies DVDs I also loved this one.
You can choose either upper, lower body or do both. In total about 40 minutes.
Sometimes the reps were a bit fast on the lower body, I found it difficult to keep up. But generally really felt the pyramid technique worked well to fatique the muscles and I really felt it the next day!",1323734400,3,344,4.390625
4860135,5,B005QUQRCE,"This workout is awesome! I like to think I'm in pretty good shape, but this DVD kicked my butt! I did both the upper and lower workouts yesterday and I am most definitely feeling it today. So sore but in a ""I did my body good"" kind of way.",1323648000,,239,3.8979591836734695
4860136,5,B005QUQRCE,"I've purchased 5 of Jackie's workout DVD's now, this one being the most recent.  I absolutely love the pyramid style she uses.  I want my heart rate to get up but I don't like all that jumping up and down and clicking my heels together in the air stuff.  Jackie's workouts get your heart rate up while strenghtening and toning your muscles using hand weights.  I feel worked by the end.  You should try this one.",1322956800,76,412,4.368421052631579
4860137,5,B005QUQRCE,"I have done Jackie's ""Xtreme"" DVDS and liked them, but this one is my favorite of her DVDs so far.  You get two workouts, an upper body and a lower body and abs workout.  The are both under 30 minutes, but wow do you get a workout.  Each exercise is done in a pyramid of reps all the way until you work up to 10 (which equals 55 reps total of each move).  I have never done a workout in a pyramid technique before, but I really like it.  You will definitely find muscles you never knew you had.  One thing that I really appreciate Jackie doing in these workouts is that before you start each pyramid, she describes and shows you what you will be doing, which eliminates the need to rewind to keep up.  I like that these workouts are short enough to do both together for a full body workout that will be under an hour or if you are crunched for time you can get one workout done in about 30 minutes or less and get a heck of a workout.  I really felt it the next day (and I workout almost everyday).  This is a definite regular addition to my routine now.  If you liked Jackie before you will LOVE this.  If you are new to her workouts or didn't love her in the past, this will change your mind and make you a fan.",1319068800,176,1213,4.0125

4860140,3,B005QUQRCE,"I would be cautious about doing this workout.  I think the pace of the exercises is too fast -causing you to not use your muscles to control the movements and also causing you to use poor form in the execution. I also didn't like how the exercises were paired together because I found that with one exercise (of the pair), I would be able to use a higher weight while the second exercise, the weight was too high.  There is no stop in between the exercises so you have to use the same weight for both.  What I did take away from this program was the concept of doing a pyramid exercise.  I think this would have been a better workout if the pace was slowed down so that you could switch weights if needed and also focused on your form and controlling the weights as you did the exercise (rather than using momentum to do the reps) and also giving you time to squeeze at the top.  I also think if this program were slowed down, you could do less sets of the pyramid but be just as effective because you are being forced to use your muscles during the execution of each rep.  I wouldn't recommend this video to anyone concerned with getting injured. I did like the exercises that were used in the video and can incorporate them in my own workout.  One thing I did was watch JW do the first rep of each pyramid and then stop the dvd so I could perform the exercises at my own pace -going slower and squeezing.  So while the exercises aren't bad, I think you should be cautious in following the execution of this program.",1464998400,4,1517,4.2613240418118465

4860150,5,B005QUQRCE,This workout from Jackie is great. The production value is good. You will really get a workout with this program. Jackie explains form and works out along with her assistants. I would consider myself intermediate level for working out. I love strength workouts and this has a lot of upper and lower body strength. It does keep your heart rate up. The one thing this could use is a little more cardio. I usually add a cardio minute in between sets. To increase intensity I upped the weights. It does slow me down a bit so I have to hit pause until I finish the pyramid. I really love this and use the DVD often. If you like Jillian MIchaels videos for intensity you will like Jackie.,1452988800,,682,4.377952755905512
4860151,5,B005QUQRCE,"I have not purchased this yet, but I probably will--I want to check out some of her other DVDs before I make my choice.  I work out 5 days/week doing cardio and weight-lifting.  I have done nearly every Jillian Michaels DVD out there, but I never feel like it's quite as good a workout as I get at the gym.  Also, Jillian tends to mix in things like martial arts and balance work that I'm not particularly a fan of.  This is the first Jackie Warner DVD I've tried, and I LOVED it.  I'm still sore 36 hours later.  Her methods are fairly straight-forward, but the results are fantastic.  She goes REALLY fast, so you have to work to keep up, but she does a demonstration before each move so you know what you're about to do.  I really enjoyed the systematic approach and the intensity.",1452297600,,784,4.321917808219178

4860166,4,B005QUQRCE,"Wow. This is a TOUGH workout.  If you are looking for a solid upper body routine in just 20 minutes -- the first segment of the routine is fabulous.  As others have said -- I find the second part of the routine (the lower body) to be light on the legs.  She has you doing shoulders with lower body -- and so its actually hard for me to use a higher weight.  And about 3 lower body sets...so I find my legs aren't tired but my shoulders ARE.  The ab routine is fabulous and highly recommended -- there are 3 sets there.

Anyhow.  I felt sore in my upper body for a few days after.  Amazing.  Not so sore in my legs but I still think its helping.  I wish there were maybe 2 more sets in the legs -- and I find some of Jackie's other videos to be better for legs.  This video is great if you want shoulder definition and nice toned arms.",1429833600,2,834,3.963855421686747

4860168,5,B005QUQRCE,I am a huge fan on Jackie Warner's home videos. So this dvd didn't disappoint. I like it because she uses basic exercise combinations that target and work multiple muscle groups.

4860173,3,B005QUQRCE,"This is my 5th Jackie Warner video and I am relatively happy to have it in my exercise video library. However, the quality of the production is not nearly as good as her other videos.  I find its shortcomings so distracting that I only use the video as a guide to tell me which routine is next, then I pause the dvd to complete the routine and fast forward to the next when I've finished that routine.

There are two segments, one upper and one lower body. Each segment is comprised of 6 routines, each routine has two movements, which are repeated in reverse pyramid structure, first one repetition of the two movements, than 2 repetitions of the two movements, and so on until you complete 1 through 10 reps of each of the two movements. Then on to the next routine. One drawback of this method is that some of the routines combine two movements that don't necessarily call for the same dumbbell weight. I find that I may need a lighter dumbbell for one movement than for the other. Another reviewer mentioned that it would make more sense to start with 10 reps and work down to 1. I think that's not a bad idea and I will give that a try.

The speed of the routines is sometimes rather fast which makes me feel that I'm not getting as much benefit as when I do the movements at a slightly slower, more controlled pace. Also, as others have noted, it bugs the heck out of me that she says after completing number 4 on the pyramid, ""halfway point, already??"". No Jackie, completing 10 reps is not halfway to 55. She does it on every routine!

Also annoying: it can be hard to watch the video while performing some of the movements and she doesn't always count the reps out loud. So I'm counting in my head to keep track of when to move to the next movement and then at some point Jackie decides to count out loud. But sometimes she counts backwards and sometimes forwards. I'll be counting 6, 5, 4... and while I'm saying 4, 3, 2, 1, Jack is saying 3, 4, 5, 6. Either count forward or count backward but don't switch back and forth.

Exercise caution (no pun intended) with the exercises that require you to bend at the waist. I'm not an expert but it feels to me like it's putting too much stress on the lower back. I've modified my stance to avoid lower back strain.

My impression is that the budget was tight on this and they didn't want to spend too much time in editing or production. In the upper body cool down/stretching routine, the first stretch on one arm is held twice as long as on the other side. That may sound like a nit, but if you do the routine I think you'll see what I mean. Don't they time how long they hold the stretch? It seems like it wouldn't have cost much more to pay more attention to the details and put out a better product.

The cost of the DVD is not a huge investment and I do the exercises so I guess I got my money's worth. But I'd rather that I could work out along with the video.",1426464000,2,2921,4.233393177737882

4860209,5,B005QUQRCE,"I have been doing all the Jillian dvds for a year.  I spin a few times a week.  Do yoga once a week.  Run a few times a week.  I'm in pretty decent shape.  Or so I thought....until I did this dvd.

Let me say this, I'm dealing with some knee pain and wanted a dvd without all the jumping/plyometric stuff Jillian does.  This dvd does have some squats, but I was able to modify them to avoid any knee pain. So in regards to the knee issues I'm having, this dvd is going to work well.

I started the pyramids with 8lb weights.  I can do this, I thought.  Then, 3rd pyramid in, I had to go to 5lbs weights.  Ouch.  Finally, at the last pyramid, I had to pause the dvd, go dig in my closet for the 3lb weights I haven't used in a year.  Yes, it was that hard.  Even with the 3lb weights, I was barely able to complete the pyramid.

I'm really happy with this workout.  There is definite room for me to grow and improve and get stronger.  If you are looking for a good strength workout, without all the jumping around, this one is for you!!",1393977600,2,1035,3.9950980392156863
4860210,5,B005QUQRCE,"I love this DVD. Love, love, love. I started using it 2 years ago when I got her book _This Is Why You're Fat_ and it still kicks my butt (just keep increasing your weights). The upper body routine is incredible. I started seeing definition in my arms after just a couple of weeks. The lower body routine is not as challenging, though, because you are working your shoulders at the same time, so you can't use enough weight to make your legs really burn. To fix this, I do a pyramid that combines the squats and deadlifts with a heavier weight, then one that combines the front and side raises with a lighter weight. The pyramid with sumo squat and shoulder press I can do with heavier weight, so I keep that one as is. The ab exercises are also great. When they get easy, do them holding a weight for more challenge. Overall, this DVD is by far the most effective I have tried.",1393977600,4,878,4.295180722891566
4860211,5,B005QUQRCE,"I really like this because it works you hard, but you don't realize how hard you're actually working.

I love Jackie's unique pyramid training system. It involves doing two moves in a row once and increasing the reps until you are doing each move ten times, then going to the next exercise. It makes me so tired. I love it! I also like the fact the workouts are short (around 30 minutes) yet since they are hard, I feel like I haven't wasted my time.

She uses what she calls the ""pyramid technique"" to due circuits.  She doesn't go to fast, she demos everything before you would begin coping her moves.  You will need either 3lb, 5lb, or 8 lb weights to do her routines.  I suggest the lighest weights the first few times you do her video just to work on your form first to avoid injury then step up the weights accordingly. The exercises are easy on the knees and the back if you have issues.  I modified a few of her routines and used a 35cm ball with a couple of the excerises and a chair to assist with some of the squat exercises since I do have some back problems.",1377388800,4,771,4.2534246575342465
4860223,4,B005QUQRCE,This DVD has 2 workouts...upper body and lower body. Upper body targets the arms and is really intense. I work out avidly and this really helped push through plateaus and I see a difference in arm muscle tone. The lower body still has a lot of shoulder and arm work..and i don't find the leg work at all challenging. The ab portion however is insanely killer!! I would recommend this only if you are looking for a video to really work your arms and abs.,1376524800,,453,4.341176470588235

4860227,5,B005QUQRCE,"I have been working out pretty regularly for a long time - probably 12-13 years now - and other than using the gym's treadmill all of my working out is done using DVDs at home.  I have a lot of them and consider myself an armchair expert on workout DVDs.  What I love about this one is that it is so different from anything I've ever done.

The pyramids are amazing - I don't get bored because there's a clear goal and I'm not doing any one thing for too long.  Even better, though, they can break you through a plateau like nothing else.  I work out pretty frequently and often worry that I never get sore so may not be making progress.  With this, that will never ever be a worry again.

All you need to do to keep moving forward with this single DVD is get increasingly heavier weights.  It's that simple.

This is new and different and will keep you coming back to challenge yourself again and again - and you'll look better and better every time.",1374451200,,951,4.238888888888889

4860229,4,B005QUQRCE,"I was feeling like I was in a workout routine slump and like I needed to try something new and different. This is my first Jackie Warner workout video. I consider myself to be at intermediate level of fitness when it comes to strength training and I do a variety of other workout videos regularly. The pyramid system is really cool and I started out by doing both the upper body and lower body workout back to back. I felt like I got a good workout but not a perfect work out. Here are my criticisms:

1. No matter what I could not keep up with Jackie's pace. This has never been a problem for me with other workout routines but something about the dynamic compound movements in this workout, I'm just doing them a touch slower than Jackie is guiding and normally this would not be a big deal but she counts down the reps and that is very confusing when I am a rep or two behind. I had to end up pausing the video here and there just because I was disoriented by doing my own count for the pyramid and listening to her count down.

2. Jackie doesn't give time to select different weights: I think ideally it would make sense to alternate more between lighter and heavier weights and her pace is so fast that there is no time to accommodate this. Again, I ended up having to pause the video and re-adjust my weights.

3. Lower Body routine was not super intense in fact she incorporates a lot of shoulders in the lower body routine and I feel like my shoulders were more challenged in this routine than any of the muscles in my legs. I did end up feeling sore in my inner thighs the next day so it wasn't a complete loss but I didn't feel like my glutes, quads and calves were intensely challenged.

4. Each workout is very short - this is both a pro and a con. I really feel like to get a solid workout you have to do both back to back.

Overall I am happy with this purchase because this was extremely affordable and it is something new and different for me to work with. It's not going to be a favorite routine but I think it will be cycled steadily through my workouts.",1373760000,3,2072,4.1959798994974875

The arm segment I have found on youtube and have done it on there before. But I do like it enough that I'm glad I own it. The 2nd part is legs and abs. There isn't a lot of leg work which for me is ok. It's about half legs and half abs. The ab pyramids are hard! I usually use Cindy Whitmarsh and Jillian Michaels dvd's.

4860235,4,B005QUQRCE,"I'm only giving it 4 stars because I don't like up-tempo music playing while I am stretching.  I've done the Firm videos in the past and also Jari Love's. I workout 5 to 7 days a week.  I bought Power Circuit Training by Jackie and really noticed a difference in my legs so I bought the 30 Day Fast Start for the upper body workout. I really like the upper body workout. I use those two videos for my weight training days and use Jillian's 30 Day Shred for my cardio days (alternating between level 2 and 3) with a day on the treadmill.  I really believe it is best to mix it up.  Your body adjusts after awhile and you quit getting the same results.

The upper body workout is chest and triceps and the lower body workout is legs and shoulders.  I don't like to work my shoulders with my legs because my legs can handle heavier weights than my shoulders and my shoulders are prone to injury.  At first I wasn't too happy about the lower body workout but now I just see it as a time to focus on upper body and give my lower body a break.  Over all it is a really good workout.  I always do both upper body and lower body workouts on this video.",1367280000,,1144,4.0941704035874436
4860236,5,B005QUQRCE,I read reviews about Jackie's DVDs and decided to purchase this one even though I have never had any luck in the past with at home workout DVDs.

After a while, since I have been doing other J. Warner DVDs, I realized I should give 30 day Fast Start another try, KEEPING UP WITH HER PACE, and upping the weights to 8 pounds. Well!! Guess what!? It totally did the trick, naturally. So, if you are like me and were not totally impressed at first, try that: go at Jackie's speed, and get heavier weights. You'll be sore for days, and sweaty as you are exercising, guaranteed,",1364688000,2,631,4.448275862068965

4860243,5,B005QUQRCE,"This is a great, tough, challenging DVD. I have three of her other workout DVDs and this is my new favorite. I love the pyramid workout method since I am not able to do any type of impact cardio. I used to do sit ups during the cardio intervals of her other workouts, but really wanted a workout that I could do in it's entirety. I read many of the reviews here before buying, and am thankful that I did, since I almost passed up on this DVD (thinking it would have jumping intervals that would make it a waste for me).
The only con to this DVD ( and it has nothing to do with the workout exercises): you cannot play the workout in its entirety without having to do the warm up portions 2x. That means that you do the warm up exercises before both the upper and lower body workouts, which is annoying when you are pressed for time.",1363219200,,831,4.135802469135802

I love the pyramid aspect and the fact that you can break up the DVD between upper body, lower body or total body workouts. This is pure strength!  Basically you are doing 55 reps of each move and each pyramid is a combination of two moves (back & triceps, chest & bicep, etc)for a total of 110 reps per pyramid, you will definitely feel this the next day!  Jackie makes sure to show you the move before the pyramid starts and also opens the DVD with weight recommendations, 3-8 lb weights for women and 10+ pound weights for men.  I actually usually use 8 lb weights when doing high-rep strength training but went ahead and took Jackie's advice and used my 10 lb weights, and I honestly could not finish the upper body circuit.  My muscles were too fatigued (which is the point!) so I may actually go down to 8 lbs next time just to make it through.

4860264,4,B005QUQRCE,"As other reviewers have said, the lower body workout is wimpy, but the arms workout is excellent. I was sore the next day after doing it with 10 lb weights, and I am never sore anymore doing any other of Jackie's or Jillian's workouts. Doing this on alternate days with Jillian Michael's killers buns and thighs is a great combination for strength, and then adding some ab/cardio routine on the third day is ideal. I find that it is not possible to train every muscle to exhaustion on a single day, it just becomes too time-consuming and tiring. On the other hand, if I do total body workouts every day I end up not challenging any of my muscle groups to exhaustion, which is necessary to get that great muscle tone. I love this workout because it's the only one I have (and I have a lot) that truly challenges arms alone and can be combined with several other workouts that focus on lower body, cardio and abs.",1351987200,,911,4.428571428571429

It seems to cover the basic muscle groups and gets our heart rates going. The intensity can be increased or decreased by varying the weight of the dumbbells you use. Our friend who is not in very good shape tried it without weights and could not finish each exercise, so based on that I would say that this workout is probably suited for folks who workout on a regular basis.",1346630400,,489,4.268817204301075
4860269,4,B005QUQRCE,"I enjoyed this workout. It was really great for arms - a real challenge for someone who isn't terribly new to exercise but isn't already ripped. The muscles Jackie told me should be tired were.

My only complaint would be that the section entitled ""Lower Body Workout"" was mostly for abs and shoulders. There were two intervals with squats and a move Jackie called ""the scissor,"" in which you laid on your back with your legs straight up in the air, then spread them and brought them back together. If the scissor has been done more slowly, it might have been a challenge but, as it was, I didn't really feel any effects from that particular exercise.

Use this DVD if you really want to work your arms and some abs. Look elsewhere if you're interested in working your bottom or legs.",1345161600,,784,4.514084507042254

I bought this DVD because Jackie knows her stuff. but this DVD didn't cut it for me. the pyramid workout is awesome in theory, however, combining large muscles with small muscles using the same weight didn't work. doing wide rows for the back requires a heavier weight than tricep kickbacks.  using a light weight won't work the back just as using a heavy weight compromises tricep kickback form. this is true when working legs and shoulders as well. so I guess this isn't a good DVD for me.",1340409600,12,617,4.54954954954955

4860272,5,B005QUQRCE,"Great workout when you are pressed for time. There are two workouts, one for the upper body and the other for the lower body. If you want to do both workouts, they last for about 40 minutes.  If you are accustomed to intermediate to advanced workouts, you may need to increase your weights on certain exercises to really feel the burn. I use 5-8 pound weights when I workout to this DVD and after more than 55 reps for each move, there are days when I have to power down to 3 pounds on the arm exercises to keep up! She calls it climbing up the ladder and chasing the burn, and boy does it burn after the halfway point on some exercises!  It contains a lot of reps and you should feel sore the next day if you use the right poundage. Although I'm 40+ I workout to Chalene Extreme, Turbo Fire (almost daily), P90X, Taebo, The Firm, Shaun T and have completed Insanity twice.  This workout does not compare to the intensity of those workouts, but it is an excellent strength training workout nonetheless. The workout is very easy to follow and great for beginners too.  Jackie hits all muscle groups, including the abs, and I do get my sweat on (especially when I increase the weights).  I enjoyed working out to this DVD and will definitely include it into my 6 day per week workout schedule.",1339200000,,1291,4.384937238493724

Each segment is a half hour and you really get a great workout in a very short amount of time. I did the lower body workout today and feel like I really worked my abs. You get so many reps in and that is what will help you reshape your body. The more reps, the more definition you will have.

Great purchase and I will be adding more of her workouts to my arsenal which includes Jeanette Jenkins and Jillian Michaels.",1337126400,2,653,4.352459016393443

4860279,4,B005QUQRCE,"I'm more an avid dvd buyer than doer, to be honest.  I'd seen a snippet of this and thought it looked doable, so I bought it.  I've done the upper body routine twice now, and the lower body section once.  I disagree with some previous reviews, in that I found both sections to be very intense (as another said, I was in arm agony for a good two days after first upper body workout), and found both sections to be (for me, anyway) quite an aerobic workout.  Jackie's pyramids move very quickly; I'm afraid this might keep me from using good form (I think it affects them on the dvd, too; towards the end of some exercises, the ladies are looking a little less than perfect).  I do like that the moves are uncomplicated, but wish the camera would catch the movements from more perspectives, more often.

This is probably a more advanced video than I should be using, but I admit, I do like that burn, and the achy muscles the day(s) after make me feel I'm accomplishing something!",1333497600,,978,4.405555555555556
4860280,4,B005QUQRCE,"I agree with most reviewers that this a great upper body strength training video. I am an intermediate/advanced exerciser, I have been doing other Jackie Warner videos, Jillian Michaels, and Shape workout DVDs for over 3 years and I was sore with this video the next day!

I like how each section of this video is around 24min long and if you do both the upper and lower body together, it gives you a complete workout. I do think that the lower body section is somewhat lacking, it's probably because it's combined with abs too. At times I feel the pace is a little fast. I don't recommend this video for beginners as you should be familiar with proper form and technique before conducting these moves.

For those who say this video isn't ""challenging"" enough, you probably need to increase your weights, especially when you say you are an avid exerciser. If you are continuously exercising then you are getting stronger and in order for any workout to be more challenging, heavier weights are needed.

Also, it's important to keep in mind this video focuses more on getting ""lean & ripped,"" strength, and not on cardio, but what's great is that with all the repetitions it gets your heart rate up!

In general, I really liked this video and the pyramid method of increasing a repetition. The time definitely seemed to fly by. It was a great addition to add to my other workout DVDS to keep my body from getting bored and changing up my routine, which increases exercise effectiveness. Great video!",1331683200,8,1498,4.684410646387833
4860281,5,B005QUQRCE,This is by far my favorite workout dvd by Jackie.  I wish she would make more similar to this one.  The pyramid training delivers great results!  Highly recommend this workout!!,1331596800,2,177,4.833333333333333
4860282,4,B005QUQRCE,"As a woman in my 40s I was mainly looking for a workout to help me tone up, and gain back muscle - especially in my arms. Which, after reading all the reviews, is why I bought this DVD.

Not having worked out for over a year, I was excited to start my first day - deciding to do both the upper and lower body workouts. The following two days came with some major muscle soreness, which made me very happy. My legs were killing me! I was an instant fan of Jackie's pyramid system.

But then as time went on, and I needed to increase my weights to ensure the effectiveness of my workouts, I found it difficult to keep up with her. She moves through the repetitions quite quickly, so heavier weights meant really pushing myself just to keep up. And unfortunately for me, meant injuring my left shoulder. Which set me back, made me lay low for a bit, to the point that now I feel like I'm back to square one.

So, while I like Jackie's manner and the fact she does the majority of the workout with me, my biggest complaint is the speed at which she performs each exercise. Which is not a problem with light weights, just not great once you want to step it up and actually progress!

UPDATE: AUGUST 11, 2014
I ditched this workout just over 2 years ago to start doing P90X (a workout that SAVED me and made fitness fun!) but now that I'm stronger I have decided to revisit Jackie's upper body workout for my arms, and what a pleasant surprise. I had forgotten what a great little workout this is. It's short but intense, and the key (I now realize) is don't even try keeping up. Seriously. I don't care how fit you are (unless you're looking for more of an aerobic workout) my original assessment still stands. This workout is way too fast. My advice is to go at your own pace, maintain good form, and focus on your own personal count. Keep the DVD volume low and only use Jackie as a guide for what exercise you are up to. If there's one thing I learned from Tony Horton (P90X), DON'T try and be a hero. It's about quality not quantity.

Another thing I want to address is the weights. Jackie suggests 5 & 8 pound weights to start out but if you want to keep up with her I'd highly recommend 3 & 5 pound instead. Or if you're like me and want more of a strength building workout (for muscle size and definition) then try 8 & 10 pound weights. I'm now in my 3rd week and using heavier weights has my arms screaming by the end of each workout - and I am by no means completing each pyramid. Results are beginning to show slowly but surely... but I'm old ;) If you're in your 20's or 30's I wouldn't be surprised if after 4-weeks you'll be dancing the happy jig!!

I can't deny this is a good workout, and effective system. It's especially great as an addition to any existing fitness routine. The biggest shame is Jackie doesn't actually tell you to take it slower if need be, and to not kill yourself trying to keep up with her - but I guess it's called the '30 DAY FAST START' for a reason! My only other concern is her warm-up is too short, especially if you plan to use heavier weights. I'd suggest several minutes of arm swings and stretches to loosen you up and warm up the joints before you hit play. But overall I give her upper body workout a big thumbs up! SO glad I never threw this DVD out.",1331510400,5,3296,4.199052132701421
4860283,3,B005QUQRCE,"This review is a guy's perspective on these workout routines.

At the start of the year I bought several workout DVDs to add a little variety to what is mostly a running routine. Of the three workout coaches (Jillian Michaels/Bob Harper/Jackie Warner) Jackie is certainly the weakest of the three by far.

This disc consists of two workout routines that are each 20 minutes long. While the routines may be moderately OK, they are rushed through in such a fashion that you don't have time for good form, just to get through the repetitions. How about slowing the routine down and stressing good form and a full range of motion?

On a difficulty scale, this is not a very tough workout and does not really hit very many muscle groups on the body. There are some bicep/tricep routines and a few leg/shoulder routines and some abs. That's it??

The most disappointing thing is that I can get a Jillian DVD with four separate routines on it that will hit every part of my body and that will leave me seriously sweating at the end, and the Jillian DVD is several dollars cheaper than this Jackie DVD! (This workout DVD was the most expensive of the three I bought and is the least useful)

My suggestion is to skip this DVD and to look for any of the recent Jillian DVDs such as 'Ripped in 30'.

UPDATE: Changed from 2.5 Stars to 3.5 Stars -  I found a setting on my (Sony) DVD Player that allows me to play the DVD workouts at 0.8X speed (a setting in between my default slow play mode and normal speed), which greatly helps these workouts by giving you the time to get in a full range of motion and proper form for each exercise routine. You don't get quite as much of a cardio burn as each full workout takes perhaps 4-5 minutes longer, but since this is more of a strength training DVD that part was not significant anyway. The flipside is that the slightly slower speed also allows me to use a slightly heavier weight since I am not throwing it around quite so quickly just to keep up, but now have the proper amount of time to go through the full range of motion, meaning I end up getting a harder workout as a result.",1331078400,10,2118,4.3604060913705585

I was excited to try Jackie's 30-Day Fast Start, thinking it would be even more challenging than her other videos and would push me to the next level.  While the workout is a different format and muscles are worked in a new way, I simply didn't feel as challenged.  I plan to try it next time with heavier weights.

4860290,5,B005QUQRCE,"I love Jackie's workouts because you don't have to be jumping around like crazy but she does make you sweat like crazy.  I have been using mostly this DVD and some other ones from Jackie and so far I have lost 10 pounds in one month.  Of course I have been eating healthy as well.  I like this pyramid concept because by the time you get to the top it's a little harder to do the exercise and you really feel your muscles and that's how you know it's really working.  For the first couple of days my muscles hurt but after a week it wasn't so bad anymore, my body got used to it.  It gets much easier to do the exercises if you commit to it.  The only problem I have with this DVD is that sometimes she seems to rush through some of the exercises, so I feel like they go a little head of me sometimes, but no big deal.  I also got another Jackie DVD for my mom, who has bad knees and can't be jumping around, and she enjoys the exercises because they are not bad on her knees.",1328832000,3,976,3.9743589743589745
4860291,4,B005QUQRCE,"As a huge workout buff (spend 25-30 hours/week in the gym), I am normally skeptical that any workout video will do much for me.  My skepticism was met with a giant punch in the face by Jackie's giant, muscle-bound arm.

This is a two-part video series, based on pyramid rep building.  Basically, you start with a low number of reps and work up to a high number of reps with each excercise while alternating something in between so muscle exhaustion won't happen as fast.  Each section (1) Arms (2) Legs & Abs  is approximately 24 minutes long.

In the first section, Jackie wows me again with her creativity.  Her arm excercises are truly challenging; be prepared with not just weights, but cans of soup to lift in case the reps are too much to bear.  These are excercises that despite years in a gym & plenty of exposure to personal training...i've never seen.

In the second section, her focus is about 85% on Abs, and 15% on legs.  Her ab pyramid is hard, although not as creative as her arms section. My only complaint with the video is that she didn't have many leg exercises that I felt were challenging.

Overall, if you're looking to bust out some shredded arms in no time, this is a great video.  Abs & leg-wise, I'm not so sure.  You will absolutely feel the burn, but, whether or not five variations on normal situps will get you where you want to be...is debatable.

I would definitely buy this video again if I ever lost it.  It's the perfect way to break a light sweat if you have 25-50 minutes to kill.",1328745600,10,1517,4.425992779783393

4860293,3,B005QUQRCE,"When I'd read through some of the reviews and saw these came out to be an average of 4.5 in ratings, I thought it would be a good idea to make the investment.  I am a fitness DVD junkie and have done some of the Jillian Michaels routines, but simply wanted to change it up a bit. Jackie is a highly renowned trainer and I couldn't wait to try this out, sadly I have to say I was disappointed.  I'll explain.

I have always had problem areas in the lower body area (you get the idea) and over time have grown to better appreciate the emphasis placed on the need to incorporate weights into a workout routine (getting older does that to you).  With this DVD, there are the two segments (upper body and lower body w/abs), and while I really appreciate a solid arms and back workout the greater need for me personally at this point is to work my lower body.  With this DVD, I used five pound weights on the lower body segment and while in the first half or so of that segment there were things like squats, dead lifts and sumo squats done in the pyramid-format (which was very new to me and I really enjoyed), the remaining time was spent on abs.  That said, I would have liked to have seen more emphasis on the legs and glutes and felt this was a missed opportunity.

Overall, a decent workout and I will try it out a few more times or find a way to place at least the upper body segment into my DVD rotation, but I can't say I was crazy about it simply because it didn't have enough of what I was looking for.  I would give this product four or even five stars for the upper body and arms, but only one star for the lower body if I could as I don't feel I got my money's worth for the amount of time spent focusing on anything other than abs.",1328659200,2,1740,4.097058823529411

4860295,4,B005QUQRCE,"I really enjoyed this workout and felt it the next day.  This has 2-20 minute workouts; one for upper body, one for lower body; each workout has 6 different pyramids.  As others have said, they move way too fast, so I found myself pausing the video so I could catch up, which is incredibly annoying.  Jackie says many times throughout the video that if you aren't feeling the burn, you should up your weights, which I did.  However, it is easy to see how you could move quickly through the pyramid as they do with the light weights that they are using.  Another gripe is the lower body-it has 3 moves that incorporate both legs and arms and the next 3 are abs, so the actual lower body portion is a bit lacking.  That being said, I actually did enjoy this workout, plan to keep it and add it into the rotation.",1327795200,,810,4.296052631578948
4860296,3,B005QUQRCE,"I dropped my gym membership awhile ago and have switched to exclusively at-home workouts, with Jackie's DVDs being my go-to choice at least 80% of the time.  As such, I was really looking forward to her latest release, to add some much-needed variety into my routines.

Ideally I would have given this item 3.5 stars, because while this is overall a great and really tough DVD, I have several quibbles:

As reviewer Beth Ott mentioned, the pyramid system is backwards.  I would rather start with 10 reps and work my way to 1: not only will that make the pyramid seem easier and faster mentally, but my form won't be falling to pieces by the end.  Also as Beth notes, Jackie's mention of ""you're halfway there!"" at 5 reps is misleading, as the actual halfway point is around when you've completed the 7 rep step.

As other reviewers have said, lower body work is quite lacking in this DVD.  You'll need to supplement.  The upper arms, meanwhile, require several moves in a row where you are leaning far forwards, which, I learned on Power Circuit Training, hurts my back.

Where is Jericho?  I've gotten used to having her and Madison in the back row.  Also missing along with Jericho are the modifications she demonstrated in the Time Saver and Abs DVDs.  I think every workout DVD should include modifications, especially Jackie's, since they are so great for ""growing"" with you as you become stronger.

Jackie's past habit of checking on her backups and talking about their form is largely absent -- she stays almost exclusively up front and doing the entire routine.  I found myself really missing the silly banter of past DVDs and that nice sense of camaraderie that it creates.

My heart rate was hardly elevated at all.  This definitely doesn't moonlight as cardio the way Time Saver Training does.

I know these are a lot of quibbles but overall Jackie's latest is valuable in its own right.  It steps on the toes of Power Circuit Training a bit, but I may find myself using the allegedly lower body routine on some days, as it actually works lower body, some upper body, and abs.  Feels almost like a total body routine.  The upper body routine, as other reviewers have noted, is insanely tough, and is something I look forward to mastering!  (Two days later, and my triceps are still weeping for mercy.)
I still think Jackie's Xtreme Time Saver training is her best one, as it really hits you almost everywhere, and incorporates weights yet REALLY gets your heart rate up.  I wish she would give us a sequel!",1327276800,55,2517,4.659863945578231
4860297,5,B005QUQRCE,This is my fourth Jackie Warner workout and probably my favorite.  I love the pyramid training system. I know from the small aches the next day that I've done something.

4860302,5,B005QUQRCE,"I have been searching for a simple but effective and strengthening weight workout focusing mainly on the upper body and abs: this one is exactly what I have been looking for.

Now, I really hate that awkward plyometrics jumping stuff that can be found in toning dvds, so I am happy that in this workout Jackie gets your heart rate up by simply using hand weights and classic exercises.

The video is shot in a warehouse and has the instructor plus two other ladies. The cuing and the camera work are impeccable.
The workout flows really well and the instructor is encouraging and motivating.

In this dvd Jackie introduces the pyramid concept: you start with one repetition of each exercise, then two, then three, until ten, which gives a total of 55 repetitions. The entire move is clearly explained before the beginning of each set, which is really helpful IMO.

The dvd has two separate workouts that you could do separately or combined. The two workouts are about 25 minutes each.

Workout  1 ""Upper body workout""
Workout 2  ""Lower body with abs workout""

I did the upper body workout with 2kg weights (ca. 4 lb) and believe me it is intense. I think the abs portion in workout 2 is also pretty good.

The lower body workout was less challenging, I agree with other reviewers, but personally I don't care.

If your trouble zone is your lower body then you might be disappointed with this dvd.
If you are really looking to work your upper body and you are short on time this is an excellent choise.",1327104000,5,1501,4.588014981273409
4860303,4,B005QUQRCE,"I love Jackie Warner videos and I have been doing them for a couple of years now.  I really like this video, but I can't give it 5 stars for the same reason someone else mentioned.  This dvd will give you an intense arm workout because not only is the upper body workout a killer, but Jackie incorporates a little arm work in the lower body portion as well, but the lower body workout itself is a little disappointing.  I have done legs on other Jackie dvd's that had me sore the next day, but this one didn't really  make me sore.  The lower body also incorporated ab work so instead of having six ""pyramids"" of legs like the arm workout had, it has 3 ""pyramids"" for legs and 3 for abs, which means less of a workout for the legs over all.  When I do the upper body, I am so fatigued I can barely get my arms up during the last pyramid and my arms are screaming the next day.  I would recommend alternating this with a little more intense leg work",1326931200,3,948,4.119565217391305

4860305,4,B005QUQRCE,"Going to keep this simple. What I love about this DVD:

1. Jackie has created several mini combos for the entire body, where she combines two moves that work different muscle groups together. You switch back and forth, first one move, then the second, and repeat. This allows you a brief rest between reps without having to stop. I love when trainers do this. Keeps the pace up, but doesn't kill your arms and legs, allowing me to actually finish the routine.

2. Jackie shows you the entire move before beginning each set. I love being able to watch the move first. That way, I don't feel like I have to play catch up as I scramble to learn a new move.

3. Simple, effective strengthening routine. No fancy, elaborate moves. What I love about Jackie is that she knows that form, continuous movement, and a large number of reps is what gets results, not difficult moves that people who are already in shape could pull off.

Love Jackie. Will always buy her DVDs.",1326672000,2,962,4.511494252873563

Instructor plus two ""backup dancers.""  Music is decent to give a beat and audible without being overpowering.  Camera work excellent.  Same warehouse backdrop which I like more than the studio look, actually.  Overall DVD production quality good as usual.  Does not have option for music only which I think every workout DVD should have (better yet music and cues only) but very few ever do.

Instructor and backup folk are non-annoying.  Instructor cues clearly, counts aloud a lot (major plus), gives a few tips on form.  Moves are simple but effective.  Probably the biggest con is that the moves transition fast and for some moves I like to use different level weights but still a minor con.

4860310,5,B005QUQRCE,"How do you build a power pyramid with Jackie?

It's actually easy.  It's like moving up the rungs of a ladder.  You just take it step by step.

You start with 1 rep on the first set, then add an additional rep per set, from set 1 to set 10.  So, set 1 has 1 rep.  Set 2 has 2 reps.  Set 3 has 3 reps.

Workout 1: Here in more detail are Jackie's six power pyramids.

Pyramid 1: Hammer push up and hammer curl
Set 1: Do 1 hammer push up and do 1 hammer curl.
Set 2: Do 2 hammer push ups and do 2 hammer curls.
Set 3: Do 3 hammer push ups and do 3 hammer curls.
Set 4: Do 4 hammer push ups and do 4 hammer curls.
Set 5: Do 5 hammer push ups and do 5 hammer curls.
Set 6: Do 6 hammer push ups and do 6 hammer curls.
Set 7: Do 7 hammer push ups and do 7 hammer curls.
Set 8: Do 8 hammer push ups and do 8 hammer curls.
Set 9: Do 9 hammer push ups and do 9 hammer curls.
Set 10: Do 10 hammer push ups and do 10 hammer curls.

All pyramids follow the same above pattern.

Rest for just a few seconds between each pyramid.

Pyramid 2: Chest press and biceps curl
Repeat the pyramid pattern from set 1 to set 10.
Do 1 chest press and do 1 biceps curl for set 1.
Do 2 chest presses and do 2 biceps curls for set 2.
Do 3 chest presses and do 3 biceps curls for set 3.
Continue the pattern & complete set 4 to set 10.

Rest.

Pyramid 3: Chest fly and outer curl
Repeat the pyramid pattern from set 1 to set 10.

Rest.

Pyramid 4: Row and headbanger
Repeat the pyramid pattern from set 1 to set 10.

Rest.

Pyramid 5: Wide row and kickback
Repeat the pyramid pattern from set 1 to set 10.

Rest.

Pyramid 6: Straight arm external rotation and straight arm kickback
Repeat the pyramid pattern from set 1 to set 10.

So, the above was the upper body workout, also known as Workout # 1.  Here's the time outline for the above workout.

Workout # 1

Total time (25:31) I loved the ""Upper body workout"" which really pumps up your arms.

Warm up & intro. (2:41)
Workout (20:10):  Pyramids 1 to 6 as detailed in the above paragraphs.
Cool down (2:40)

Besides the upper body workout, there's a second workout which is listed below.

Workout #2

Total time (24:36) ""Lower body with abs workout"" works legs and abs, and also the shoulders.  This really made my shoulders sore, because I used 10 pound dumbbells.

Warm up & intro. (2:19)
Cool down (3:17)

Workout (19:00)
Pyramid 1: Squat and front raise
Pyramid 2: Deadlift and lateral raise
Pyramid 3: Sumo squat and mititary press
Pyramid 4: Crunch and double crunch
Pyramid 5: Straight leg toe touch and scissors
Pyramid 6: Crab crunch and reach through

Finally, these two workouts may be combined into one longer workout which is the one I did.

Combined workout: Total time (48:30)

In general, weight may vary from 2 lbs for a very light weight for women up to 15 lbs for a heavier weight for men.  Jackie instructs and works with 2 other ladies.  The two workouts are about 25 minutes each.  As others have noted, the upper body workout is excellent.",1326153600,59,2987,4.0687285223367695

4860322,4,B005QUQRCE,"I gave this workout 4 stars because I really did enjoy it and will go back to it.  The pyramid, in case others are as mystified as I was, is basically Jackie taking 2 moves which are performed back to back and adding one rep each time one performs them until you get to 10 straight reps.  I think the upper body work out was very good. The lower body workout was very disappointing.  Jackie incorporated shoulder work with the lower body workout--at least for me, that limited how heavy of a dumbell I could use.  I would have used a heavier weight if I was just working out the lower body.  Also the segment for the lower body is very short. The ab section was the most challenging for me.  I think Jackie's Xtreme time saver workout is overall better but this is more interesting!",1325721600,2,782,4.321917808219178

I finished with 30 minutes of taebo cardio.  i still feel it.  after the workout, i couldn't lift my arms without shaking to take my shirt off to shower and still this morning, getting my son's lunch together was still painful.  i think by far, this is an awesome workout.... painful but amazing....  i like the fact that she guides you through the movement and the sets are not super close together or else you would be in a serious super set mess.  today is legs... i am nervous but excited to give it a shot.",1325721600,2,631,4.260504201680672
4860324,3,B005QUQRCE,"The pyramid idea isn't a bad one and really does work a muscle to failure.  The problem I had with this is that I think for a real pyramid, it should be done the opposite way.  You start out with the large number and work your way to the lower, just like a pyramid gets smaller.  This would help prevent the loss of good form as your muscles start to tire as well because you don't have to do as many at the end.  If I do this workout again, I think I will do it that way instead.  If you do both workouts, upper and lower, I think starting with the lower body and then doing the upper body is also the better way to go.  Also think she could of added some lower body to the upper body moves that would not have sacraficed form in order to get heart rates up, as even though my muscles were feeling it, my cardiovascular system was not.  The ideas here aren't bad, the set up just doesn't make it as effective as it could be.  As far as Jackie's instruction and motivation, it's not too bad.  She keeps it light even though you are working hard.  One annoying thing is once you hit count five she keeps saying you are halfway there, in reality we aren't, as the number of reps goes up with every number.  It isn't a bad workout and I felt it the next day, I just think she could have done some things differently so that this concept could really live up to it's full potential.",1325721600,3,1378,4.066666666666666
4860325,4,B005QUQRCE,I have other Jackie dvd's and this one is very similar to them. She does alot more with arms than she does with legs. It is a good dvd when you don't feel like jumping around but still want to get in a workout.,1325548800,8,210,3.7954545454545454
4860326,5,B005QUQRCE,"This workout is great, tough, but really good.  I am a daily exerciser and last year discovered Jackie Warner's dvds.  She is wonderful, motivating without that mean drill sergeant attitude, cheerful, without being over-the-top and innovative in her approach to exercise.  I regularly do the Power Circuit dvd and after having that in the weekly rotation was starting to get compliments on how toned my arms were.  Yeah!

This work out has two separate workouts that you could do separately or combined.  Each is about 23-25 minutes long. The basis is that you do two exercise for a total of 55 reps.  The first round you do one exercise, such as one push-up then a hammercurl, then two and two, three and three until you reach 10.  Sounds easier than it is especially if you are weaker in your upper body.

The upper body workout is broken down in six rounds:
pushups and hammer curls
chest presses and curls
flies and side curls
bent over rows and hand bangers (tri-ceps)
wide rows and kickbacks
straight side lifts and straight kickbacks

The upper body took about 23 minutes with a few minutes of a brief warm-up and cool-down.

The lower body workout is broken down in six rounds as well:

squats for quads and front raises
deadlifts and lateral raises
sumo squats and military presses
crunches and reverse crunches
raised leg crunches and scissors
crab curls and reach throughs

I may be sorry tomorrow that I hit both workouts but I find her workouts really addictive, which is saying something for someone who is not a big fan of weight workouts.  She makes it seem like it goes quickly, you get in and exhaust the muscle and move on.  I would definitely say this is an intermediate to an advanced work-out.

Overall, you will feel this one....allll over.  If you don't, like Jackie says, you better go out and buy heavier weights.  I did the workout with 4 lb. weights and I am feeling it, but when I get stronger, I will pick up another lb. to keep it challenging....but that might not be for a while.

I would definitely recommend this dvd and others by Jackie. She is a good trainer, with excellent form and cuing. If you want to push yourself, give this one a go.",1325376000,3,2176,4.576227390180879
4860327,3,B005QUQRCE,"Gave this DVD to my wife for Christmas, and here is her review....

I'm a fan of Jackie Warner and her DVDs, but this one seems to be poorly produced, and the instruction and moves go way too fast. I had to place the DVD on pause a few times to catch-up, and I was not going at a slow pace.  I completed the entire DVD, which you could tell was trying to fit into a 45 minute time-slot with its incomplete warm-ups, rushed sequences and choppy transitions.

The pyramid concept is great, but as usual, she tends to focus on the ""beautiful"" muscles being the shoulders, arms and chest. All great, but this workout could use more legs, hips and lower body work.

I will include this into my workout rotation, but if you are considering buying this for an overall toning and fat blast, I would suggest Jillian Michael's No More trouble Zones, or even Jackie Warner's other DVDs before getting this one.",1325030400,17,899,4.430303030303031
4860328,3,B005QUQRCE,"I was so looking forward to really loving this DVD as I have 2 other of her workout dvds which I LOVE. I do like the pyramid workout but got a better workout with the upper body routine over the lower body and abs routine. My wrists hurt a little during it, but I'm hoping that will improve. The lower body was less challenging, but good maybe for beginners. Unfortunately I did not enjoy doing the abs routine as my neck was hurting due to strain from the exercises. I am an avid fan of JW's Xtreme Timesaver Training and her Xtreme Crunchless Abs. I incorporate her workouts with P90X too.",1324598400,7,591,4.333333333333333

Out of all Jackie's DVD's her 30-minute time-saver full-body workout is the best. I started doing it a year ago and I am still beat after only 30 minutes. If you are short on time, get that DVD.

I'm a big fan of Jackie's other workouts but I think this one is my new favorite.  I had to switch to lighter weights for the last two pyramids in the upper body section because my muscles were so fatigued.  I look forward to the day when I can make it through the whole thing without having to go lighter.  I really like the exercise combinations she uses.  The workout flows really well and Jackie is encouraging and motivating as always.  I was sore in places I've never been sore before so I know this workout is effective.  I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a tough workout in a small amount of time.",1323907200,,752,4.20979020979021
4860331,5,B005QUQRCE,"This is a pretty tough and challenging workout that is aimed at an intermediate to advanced exerciser.  There are two approximately 25 minute workouts on this dvd, one targeting lower body/abs and one targeting upper body.  The theory of the pyramid is that you start with one rep of each exercise, then two, then three, until you climb the pyramid up to ten (for a total of 55 reps).  Each pyramid contains two exercises and there are three pyramids per body part targeted.  This dvd is aimed at toning, there is not really a cardio section.  The theory behind this is that you push your muscles to the point of fatigue/failure by challenging them in a way that they are not used to. This will force your muscles to adapt thus pushing for fast results.  The video is well cued and well produced.  The transitions between exercises are pretty quick and the reps are pretty quick.  The warm-up section is pretty minimal (approximately 2 minutes) and the cool down section is also only a few minutes.  The exercises chosen are mostly classics (but very effective classics) but are well put together.  This is a workout that will appeal to people who enjoy Jari Love, Bob Harper, Cathee, p90x, and Jillian Michaels workouts.  I enjoy strength training and I thought this workout flew by.

A breakdown of the routine.
Upper Body Routine
(chest and biceps)
1. pushups and hammer curls
2. Chest press to bicep curl
3. Fly to outer arm bicep curl
(Back and triceps)
4. upright row to head banger
5. wide row to tricep kick back
6. straight arm external rotation to straight arm kickback
Cool down

Lower Body/Abs- has some upper body/shoulder work
(quads, hamstrings, and anterior delts)
1. squat to anterior raise
2. deadlift to lateral raise
3. Sumo squats to military press
(abs)
4. crunch to reverse crunch
5. straight leg crunch/toe touch to scissor
6. crab crunches to reach through

I particularly love the lower body workout because it actually hits the entire body and is really effective for the abs and thighs and bum. It slims and tones you, and helps you work muscles you probably didn't even know you had. The upper body workout will absolutely improve your arms and upper body strength and appearance. Overall I love this DVD set and would recommend it to anyone in a hurry or not into gyms or looking for something effective but not ridiculously extensive. It's doable and challenging and if you aren't challenged, you can just increase your weights and then you will be!
I love this workout set. I've told lots of people about it. It helped create muscle definition on my body...quickly. I used it beyond the 30 days and keep going back to it.

1. Not a very good warm up on either work out, though the lower body work out has a more involved one.  I did not feel adequately warmed up for the upper body workout which is, by the way, quite intense.
2. Great encouragement from Jackie, could use a little more detail on form.  A lot of the exercises I knew how to do already--but I did find myself collapsing my upper back during the deadlifts and even allowing my knees to come over my toes in squats.  Also, could have used a little more instruction on the sumo squats.
3. Helpers have fantastic form and endurance, Jackie not so much!  Her form occasionally will suffer and she ""conveniently"" goes to check on form during the back and triceps section, not that I can blame her!
4. Don't be afraid to go for heavier weights.  This is a great program for building muscle and endurance.  The first day I did it, my chest was in absolute agony, but by the end I was blasting through with eight pound weights.
5. Great work out for arms, back, chest, shoulders and abs.  I saw some SERIOUS definition in all of these areas.  HOWEVER this is NOT a lower body work out.  That name is very misleading.  I can whip out 70 squats at any point in time--the lower body is NOT challenging except for maybe the sheer pace of it.  I lost a lot of definition in my legs over this month and a lot of my weight pooled in my hips and upper thighs (which it's won't to do anyways, being pear-shaped that I am).  The lack of cardio is also a huge weakness in this DVD.  I had chiseled biceps, but still fat sitting on top of the muscle.  Pairing this with a cardio work out would be ideal, but challenging considering that in total the DVD is about 50 minutes long and taxing.  I would also not call this a weight loss DVD--I did not lose weight doing this DVD, but I did tighten up considerably in my upper body and abs.
6. Speaking of taxing, it is--but not horribly so.  The abs section made me feel like I was going to get a cramp, but I was also encouraged to push through by Jackie.  This is not a Jillian Michaels DVD though--if you are in good shape, you will not be dumping sweat everywhere and panting.  You will get a good work out though.
Overall, I was pleased with this DVD, but I don't think it's stand alone.  It needs to be paired with a good cardio work out and it will be golden.  Jackie is fantastic though and I will definitely be checking out more of her DVDs.",1467763200,4,2675,4.234714003944773
