2675478,3,B000JLTR86,"I've loved Teen Titans from episode 1. The characters, the nicely paced fight scenes, the villians... Sure it had its lame moments (and moments when they tried too hard to be ""anime"") but overall it was a great action series! When I heard about this movie, I was excited by the previews. The fight scenes looked cool and there was a lot to laugh about as an anime fan from all the hidden references they put in (a robot that looks like Astro Boy, the gal style in Japan where they tan their bodies in put on white lipstick, etc etc etc). So I was pumped.

BUT... I hate to say this, I really do, but this movie was a huge disappointment for us older fans. Here's the basic, basic plot: The Titans get attacked by a strange multi-colored spandex wearing ninja. After interrogating him, they find out he came from, duh, Tokyo. So off they go. Once there, they discover a plot to take over Japan and I'm guessing the world as well. However, things get really nasty when Robin kills the ninja (don't worry mothers/fathers, it's not as bad as it sounds, but I won't say why because it's a ""surprise"" ) the Titans become Tokyo's most wanted.

This sounds cool, but it's really not. First of all, the pacing is bad. There are moments that made me want to turn the DVD off BADLY and watch SpongeBob or something. There are whole scenes that are suppose to be entertaining/funny/cute but they just slow the whole movie down. Also, fans of Robin/Starfire will get their fill, but the moments are cliche and not as cute/funny as their moments in the series. But..the ending will probably make up for all these awkward, long moments in the movie for most rabid R/S fans. Secondly, the (few) fight scenes aren't as great or exciting as the ones in the series. I mean, yes, there are a few good moments in these fights but I just wasn't on the edge of my seat. And when I mean moments, I mean moments. Finally, the writers were trying way too hard to jam in every anime sterotype in the movie. At first, us anime fans are like ""That guy looks like Zenigata from Lupin III!"" or ""Hey, a cat girl!"" But after seeing about 30 references to anime/stereotypes in ONE SCENE...it gets old fast.

All in all, this is a shockingly mediocore ""movie."" There have been pleads to buy this movie so that Warner Brothers will release more Teen Titans direct-to-DVD movies. But if they're all as useless as this one, I think I'll move on from Teen Titans, thanks. It's a shame, really, that Teen Titans' future hangs in the balance of how many people by THIS movie. You can see this movie had potential, but it just never lives up to it. The good thing about this DVD release is that, as usual, the animation is decent and the voice acting is top-notch, oh and the Titans sing during the credits. But if this is the last Titans, it could've been better.",1170720000,8,2822,4.423076923076923
2675479,4,B000JLTR86,"A sigh of relief for all you Titan fans out there, it's your favorite superhero team in their very first full-length movie where they all head off to the ""Land of the Rising Sun"".  (You know, Japan.  How appropriate...)  Endless sights aside, the Titans are on a mission to locate the enigmatic villain Brushogun and stop him once and for all.

I'd hate to do this but, let me tell you the top five things you may or may not know about the DVD movie (This depends on any of you seeing the movie when it made it's Cartoon Network premiere last September.):

5. In the ""special features"", amidst the bonus mini game: ""Robin's Underworld Challenge"", there's also supposed to be the Titans' ""Lost Episode"" that was originally released online from Post cereals.  I'm anxious to see that because it features a brand-new villain named Punk Rocket.

4. Some of the secondary characters and villains in the movie sound just like Kaz from ""Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi"".  Maybe because it's the same actor that plays him.  This principle goes the same to Numbuh 3's dad in ""Codename: Kids Next Door"".

3. Speaking of which, musical montages abound in this movie, but neither of them is a song by J-pop duo ""Puffy Ami Yumi"".  Darn.

2. Beast Boy sings a rather ""lopsided"" version of the ""Teen Titans"" theme song.  Seems to me like a translated version of the Japanese version of the song.  Either way, it's not at all bad, especially with the fact that ALL the Titans sing it during the credit roll.

1. We see Robin and Starfire - *GASP* - KISSING ?!?!  OK... I didn't expect that at first either.

I hope Cartoon Network is planning to rerun the movie again, because I can't wait that long (the beginning of February ?!?!) for the DVD release.",1163116800,28,1726,4.533980582524272

Season 5 (i.e., the last Teen Titans season) was quite something for it ended with a meaningful lesson; life goes on and we must learn to move along with it, however, the creators of this amazing show left many questions unanswered and this film is a much acceptable ending to the show. Each generation must watch this film because it has absolutely everything; comedy, action, suspense, and drama and not to mention the whole series does as well! The DVD came in excellent condition (new) and the animation looks awesome on screen (colors, clarity, etc.).

ROMANCE
This is my absolute fav film it kinda reminds me of my other fav film Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker where it had lots of Mystery and Drama in but in this film we get to see of the all the qualities for starters the Mystery means like who is this villain that the Titans r trying to catch, the comady means all the funny things each of the characters has to offer, the Drama means like what's going to happen to Robin.. The Team even, the Action brings us the best fighting scenes I have have ever seen and as for the Romance...

It's the moment that all Robin & Starfire fans have been waiting to see for so long the moment where Robin and Starfire finally admit their feelings for each other after 5 seasons 1 lost episode and the entire movie it's the moment where they FINALLY FINALLY KISS!

2675734,4,B000JLTR86,"I remember at the time of its debut, Teen Titans sort of represented the end of an era.  After an impeccable run of DC Comics/ Warner animated shows including Batman The Animated Series, Superman The Animated Series, Batman Beyond, Static Shock and Justice League, here came a show that didn't take itself too seriously and wasn't afraid to use creative license on the animated incarnations of the comic book source material.

Though the DC Animated Universe's unofficial president supreme, Bruce Timm, was involved as the show's producer and Glen Murakami came on for character design, it was made clear right from the get go that Teen Titans was not a part of the interconnected DCAU properties and nor would it ever crossover with then-airing Justice League Unlimited.

The series' creators initially stated that younger children were the intended audience for the series and this was manifest by a slightly super-deformed (large heads) style, complete with goofy anime-inspired characterizations to express emotions.

Naturally die hard comic fans were less than impressed and complaints poured in with a frequency that Executive Producer and Cartoon Network V.P. Sam Register was forced to step in and justify criticism regarding the style of the show: ""The main mission was making a good superhero show for kids. Now if the fanboys happen to like the Teen Titans also, that's great, but that was not our mission.""

When I first gave the show a go in season 1 (after being spoiled by the earlier shows above), I was quite disappointed and nearly gave up on the whole franchise.  Fortunately, as writer J. Torres would go on to confirm, the show's producers discovered TT was reaching a wider audience than initially anticipated and hence got into some darker story lines and introduced a lot more characters.  Truly by the third season the show had moved away from its juvenile antics and began stringing together some deep serials that were nearly DCAU quality!

So what does all this have to do with Trouble in Tokyo you ask?  Well for fans like me, who appreciated the depth of the show (and improved humor) as it progressed, this feature film represents the final farewell to the franchise.

The plot goes like this: The Teen Titans' hometown is attacked by a Japanese ninja named Saico-Tek. Under interrogation by Robin, Saico-Tek reveals the identity of the one who sent him: a mythical being called Brushogun. The ninja then escapes and the Titans decide to head to Tokyo to search for the one who sent the assassin.

After overcoming the language barrier and fighting a giant reptile of all things, the Titans meet Tokyo's own Super-normal Defense Force (the DNF) led by Commander Uehara Daizo. Daizo shows the Titans around the Tokyo Troopers headquarters, and when Robin questions him on Brushogun, he informs the Titans that he is nothing more than an urban legend.

Though encouraged to spend the remainder of their time in Tokyo as tourists, Robin refuses to call off the investigation.  When a second incarnation of Saico-Tek tries to eliminate Robin once and for all, plans of simply touring the city are scratched permanently.

Even though the film was created and released in 2006 (after the 5th and final season of the show ended), the ""feel"" of the material harkens back to the earlier days of the series for better or worse.  Part of this is likely due to the return of head writer David Slack after having left the series after the fourth season.

The plot structure is pretty decent, if not exactly the type of climactic sendoff one might expect for a show that went 5-seasons.  There is, at its core, a mystery element here of course but one that shouldn't be too difficult for viewers of most ages to puzzle out before the conclusion (although there are a few pretty cool elements in the reveal).

Pacing is fair if a bit meandering at times, feeling as though the 53-minute runtime required writers very accustomed to doing 22-minute slots to stretch things out a bit.  The DVD release contains a few bonus features worth mentioning, among these a slightly interactive video game that uses the DVD remote and an episode of the show that never aired (probably because of its 11-minute runtime).

In all, returning to the Teen Titans certainly revealed a mixed bag of emotions.  This is one of those franchises that really worked best when caught up in the rhythm of its silliness/ timing.  After taking a break to explore other properties, I found coming back into this film to be a bit rough around the edges.  There were certainly better gags in the series and richer story threads to be sure, but the vocal work and characterizations are all in tact here and while it would have been really cool if, as earlier rumors had suggested, they might have used this opportunity to close out the show by revealing the heroes' alter egos, I feel like the DVD was a worthy investment and like that it completes the Teen Titans series collection.",1313798400,8,4967,4.8451536643026

2675737,5,B000JLTR86,"For fans of the series, this movie is a must see. The Titans, taken from their usual city and set in Tokyo, have an adventure that's full of hijinks and laugh-out-loud moments. These are balanced with romance and serious points in the plot. If you're looking for action, I'd say that the action scenes in the movie are on par with the ones seen in the show. The animation is the same as the TV series and it feels like a very long, very enjoyable episode. I'm still having trouble dealing with the fact that the series is over (and without a Starfire arc!), so the fact that it feels so much like a good episode coupled with a good dose of Robin and Starfire is great. Fans of Robin and Starfire as a couple should definitely see this. :)",1306972800,,738,4.2785714285714285

There are much better episodes in the show, notably some of the multipart arcs, which made this feel average by comparison.  Also, they committed a cardinal filmmaking sin by cutting away in the middle of an action scene and resolving it off-camera with little to no explanation.  Considering that this DVD costs almost as much as an entire season of the show, it's hard to give it anything more than a lukewarm recommendation.",1301443200,2,519,4.808988764044944

2675763,3,B000JLTR86,"Trouble in Tokyo was released following the Season Finale and cancellation of the television series Teen Titans. It more or less wraps up the show and completes the character arcs of our young heroes.  The Teen Titans are thrown into action when a new dichromatic foe, Saico-Tek, attacks their tower.  After a brief interrogation and mysterious disappearance of the villain, the Titans follow their only clue to Japan in search of ""Brushogun"".  While most of the Titans are enjoying a ""vacation"", Robin utilizes his detective skills to uncover their mysterious opponent.  After battling a Godzilla like monster, it becomes clear that not everything is well in the streets of Tokyo.  Each Titan is attacked by a monster possessing similar powers to their own, Robin is framed for a crime, and the villain Brushogun is nowhere to be found.  Can Robin solve the mystery in time to save the Titans from Japanese prison, or death at the hands of these mysterious creatures?

Teen Titans succeeds because it knows exactly what it is and what its going for.  It's thoroughly a kids movie and knows better than to take itself too seriously.  We get some well choreographed fight scenes, (especially one surprisingly emotional scene with Robin), but there's also some cartoon humor and silly montages.  The artists definitely utilized the Tokyo setting.  I loved the anime references in art style, and there were some really hilarious genre mashup segments.  (The Godzilla attack was fantastic).
As far as plot and general interest, Teen Titans lacks what the other features have going for them.  It isn't nearly as serious or intriguing as the other films and most people probably wouldn't give Trouble in Tokyo a second thought.  Trouble in Tokyo is more like an 80 minute cartoon than a true movie.  But it also knows exactly what its going for and nails it spot on the head, and I am definitely rewarding that.  I'd rather watch a movie that knows what it wants and succeeds with flying colors than something like Invincible Iron Man that plans big but falls flat on its face.",1278720000,2,2071,4.891117478510028

2675765,3,B000JLTR86,"For me, the litmus test for DC animated movies is whether or not they rise above the DCAU cartoons you can watch on TV for free. In this case I can't be too hard on Trouble in Tokyo since it was actually released first on the Cartoon Network and only later sold as a DVD. With that being said TiT (oh dear) does not exceed the television cartoon and in many ways is inferior. The animation is exactly the same as the program and the story feels like an average cartoon padded out to 90 minutes. This is the main problem with the movie. It just has so much extraneous fluff that adds nothing to the main plot.

As the title would suggest the titans take an extended trip to Japan. Their goal is to track down a criminal who trashed the Titan Towers. I got a little lost but somehow they decide the mastermind behind the attacker is a mythical character named Brushogun. All the titans head off in their own direction and the plot just grinds to a halt. Cyborg gets in a fight with some chef's at an all you can eat sushi bar, Beast Boy is mobbed by young girls after singing karaoke while Raven just... kinda... flies around and then get attacked by some Japanese monsters or robots or something. Meanwhile Robin and Starfire start getting romantic. It just really dragged along. This padding REALLY eats up the movie time leaving the story bloated and dull.

For my money Batman: The Brave and The Bold (a series I absolutely love) is the most stylish DCAU cartoon ever to come out of Warner Brothers studio but in its heyday Teen Titans was probably top dog surviving a highly respectable five seasons. Unfortunately this movie just kind of sits there. It's in no way bad; it's just never rises beyond good. Kids are pretty sharp and I suspect that this is a DVD that will get watched once and then sit on a shelf collecting dust. If it shows up on Cartoon Network give it a watch but I wouldn't pay to own it.",1255046400,,1911,4.350140056022409

2675767,3,B000JLTR86,"After the final season of Teen Titans, this direct-to-dvd was released as the final Teen Titan adventure we'd ever see. The story goes a little something like this....A robot shows up in Jump City and blows up the Titans Tower. Robin is quite pissed about this but figures out that it was from Tokyo. So, the gang heads off to Tokyo in search of this robot. What they get is more than they bargained for. While it lacks the better polish of the TV episodes(in terms of storylines & content), it more than makes up for in humor. I couldn't stop laughing at some of the idiotic antics that went on onscreen. It was simply hilarious to me. The only extras we get are The Lost Episode and the dvd  game:Robin's Underworld Race Challenge. While it woulda been nice to have had more from its' creator, it was an okay addition to the dvd(although, in my opinion, wasn't anything special). There was selection of trailers as well as a trailer of the CGI TMNT movie.

Overall; I feel it could have been a whole lot better but, given what we were given, it was good. As far as purchasing it goes, rent it first and base your decision on that. Sadly, I went ahead and purchased it. Course, I'm happy with the purchase as I like the Titans.

2675793,5,B000JLTR86,"TEEN TITANS: TROUBLE IN TOKYO is the first and hopefully not the last direct to TV and DVD movie based on the cartoon series produced by Warner Bros. Animation. The cartoon series was based on the DC Comics superheroes that came out in the 1960s. At the time, the Teen Titans consisted of Robin, Kid Flash, and Aqualad. They were all sidekicks to major icons in the DC Comics universe.

Later, Wonder Girl was added to the roster. As the popularity of the Teen Titans grew, more superhero sidekicks were added in the membership. Speedy, the young archer who was partnered with Green Arrow, joined the team on a semi-regular basis. He was quickly followed by Hawk and Dove, two brothers who had mystical-based powers that augmented their real life abilities. (Hawk and Dove were also featured in an animated Justice League episode. Just goes to show that all of these characters have remained popular for almost 40 years.) Beast Boy, fresh from the Doom Patrol, joined them and brought a whole new level of levity to the series.

After while, as most series do, the Teen Titans comics folded. In the 1970s, white-hot comic writer Marv Wolfman wanted to take a shot at creating a new Teen Titans comic. When he did he brought Robin, Kid Flash, Wonder Girl, and Beast Boy into the new series and added three new characters: Cyborg, half-teen, half-machine; Starfire, alien warrior princess with amazing powers; and Raven, whose heritage as half-demon was hidden from the rest of the team for a while.

Wolfman's vision of the Teen Titans lasted for years and introduced several characters and key concepts that were later used in the animated series. Characters like Deathstroke the Terminator, Brother Blood, the H.I. V.E. and many others came out of that series and found their way into the cartoons.

Warner's decision to render the Teen Titans as more of an anime style for the younger viewers met with a lot of resistance and derision. Diehard fans wanted their heroes to be treated as ""real"" as Batman and Superman had been. The camp style of the Warner Bros. cartoon series took a little while to catch on, but it caught on in a big way.

It wasn't long before everyone loved the Teen Titans. Diehard fans just accept the fact that this was a Teen Titans they had not seen before and decided to enjoy the series anyway. Young viewers who had never seen the Teen Titans fell in love with them. A conscious decision was made to never show the young superheroes in their secret identities. They were superheroes all the time.

Not only that, with the anime-style in mind, they were slackers, video game junkies, and connoisseurs of pizza. The characters were drawn more liberally, and they were played for laughs. Beast Boy became a perennial favorite because of his antics and his ability to change into animals. Raven was the perpetual downer, the voice of doom and gloom. Starfire was an innocent (a far cry from the warrior princess she had been in Wolfman's series) and so naive it hurt.

After the series wrapped, Warner Bros. released TEEN TITANS: TROUBLE IN TOKYO and took the team to Japan for the first time. The movie opens with an exciting chase sequence that allows viewers to see the different vehicles the Teen Titans use while in pursuit. (Can we say, Toy Op?) And the action is just as wild as it ever was in the regular series.

But no visit to Tokyo -- especially a visit by the Teen Titans, because anything can happen to them -- is complete without a fight with a giant lizard rampaging the city. After hooking up with a local Tokyo superhero team, Robin and the others find themselves locked in mortal combat with ""Gorgo.""

Despite the confrontation, Robin quickly gets back to his original mission of finding Brushogun, the man they originally came to Tokyo to apprehend. He and Starfire fall into a romantic tangle that makes it hard on both of them. Robin feels that being a superhero crowds is life to the point that he can't be anything else -- not even a boyfriend.

Beast Boy tries to get in to see his favorite manga publisher, but the corporate offices are closed. While visiting the local bookstores, Raven discovers the legend of Brushogun. According to what she reads, Brushogun was a wizard who fell in love with the drawing of a woman he had made and tried to bring her to life. That kind of explains the creepy characters that now stalk the team.

The action remains fast and furious as Robin gets framed and chased by the police. Even though the movie is three times the length of a regular episode, it flies by. The story is chock full of action and plenty of visual treats as well as jokes. Of course, at the end of the movie the Teen Titans triumph and expose the bad guy. But there's a hint and a promise of the new budding romance between Robin and Starfire.

The movie is a must for fans of the animated series, and it's a good showcase for people who never seen the series. Now that the series is coming out in DVD sets, TEEN TITANS: TROUBLE IN TOKYO would be a good introduction.

Interestingly enough, another animated Teen Titans direct-to-DVD movie is also coming out soon. TEEN TITANS: THE JUDAS CONTRACT has been scripted by Marv Wolfman and Tom DeSanto. This is going to be a definite departure from the anime style and more in line with BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES. The story will be edgier and darker.",1185753600,8,5356,4.631190727081138

I dislike the menu. it has not scene selection! and the special material is pour. I would liked to watch storyboards and a making off... I'm a fan and that was a deception.

I didn't put a 1 star (about the menu) because it has a great game, it's the best game to dvd that I've ever seen. really! is very fun and looks like 3d scenery.",1181260800,,399,3.975

2675800,5,B000JLTR86,"I've loved everything about the Teen Titans series since episode 1, and I must say, this movie succeeded in living up to what made the show so enjoyable to watch. Trouble in Tokyo was exciting, funny, and all around a blast to watch. It's especially a must-have if you're a big Teen Titans fan!

I will admit that the plot was a bit Robin-heavy, though I get the feeling that was intended. Despite this, the amusing antics of the other Titans (specifically the loveable green joker, Beast Boy) in a strange new place make for a fun-filled adventure of a movie. Starfire and Robin also finally manage to sort through their feelings while in Tokyo; definitely not something to miss, especially if you've been a fan of these two.

The music was also beautifully done, and some of the art was especially captivating. The characters singing their own mangled version of the theme song in the ending credits was also quite a treat, and left me in stitches by the time it was done playing.

Overall, an enjoyable film that's definitely worth buying. Here's to hoping that the Titans get more Direct-to-Videos (or even better- more episodes)!",1170892800,32,1134,4.746192893401015

8151710,4,B000JLTR86,"This movie is a fun addition to the excellent Teen Titans series.  The entire series manages to be fun with plenty of drama thrown in the mix.  Too often teenage superheroes are depicted as being just as grim and gritty and serious and responsible as their adult peers.  However, that's nothing like what being a teenager is about.  The Teen Titan series and this movie allow the teen heroes to have fun, develop character, and somehow try to manage the hero roles that are expected of them (and, just as importantly, they expect of themselves).

Grab yourself a copy of this fun show!  Enjoy!",1518134400,,593,4.653846153846154

8151713,4,B000JLTR86,"Decent film. The animation quality is slightly higher than the TV series, but don't expect it to look like a theatrical film. The story is predictable, as the identity of the antagonist is kept a secret, but it is painfully obvious who it is.
In the TV series, the episodes would usually focus on one or two of the characters. For example, an episode may focus on Cyborg accepting his robotic body more like his previous human body. Trouble in Tokyo focuses on the relationship between Robin and Starfire. Beast Boy gets a decent amount of attention in the movie as the comic relief, but Cyborg and Raven have very little to do with the movie, especially Cyborg. It's a shame that the movie didn't resolve some of the unanswered questions left by Season 5.
The movie is entertaining, but it was disappointing as it could have been so much more.",1506988800,,844,4.596026490066225
