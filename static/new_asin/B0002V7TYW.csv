2123202,5,B0002V7TYW,"This is a great series on an old classic.  Great for the young and old fans of the X-men.  Mystique is given a new and suprisingly cunning spin matching the comic series.  Fans are sure to enjoy this new fresh look and vision.  Mystique, Magneto, the sentinel, and many others are brought to life with great skill and depth.  I can rattle on...If your an old fan, this is a series that desires a rent at the least.  Well worth having in the collection.",1102723200,6,452,4.321428571428571
2123203,5,B0002V7TYW,"this dvd has 5 great episodes including:

shadow dance

and day of reckoning parts one and two

buy this great dvd!",1099353600,25,140,4.44
2123204,3,B0002V7TYW,"I totally agree with all the comments made about this series being released as one whole season set.  I've loved the X-Men since I was a teenager, and I will continue to purchase these, but it is extremely frustrating to get them piece by piece.

Does anyone know what the title is for Season 2 Volume 1?  I can't seem to find it.  If so I would appreciate it if someone could send it to me at ceejazz1@cox.net.  Thank you.",1098835200,,423,4.2375
2123205,3,B0002V7TYW,I had it!  Why can't the whole season box set be released? I believe that there are millions of fans out there who were having the same thought as I do. It really sucks to have the release of the episodes bit by bit...,1094860800,9,218,3.9545454545454546
2123206,4,B0002V7TYW,"I just wanted to leave a comment saying I don't understand why they keep releasing this series like this.  It's a great show, I'd love to buy it all on DVD, but having to buy it 4 episodes at a time on individual DVD's is frustrating, especially since there is no description here of where we're at in the timeline.  What season is this DVD from?  What part of the season?  I'll have to do my own research because there's no description of it around here.

I know they must be doing it like this to appeal more to the allowance money audience, but I would like to see them continue to package entire seasons as they did with season 1.  Even if it's just 4 seperate boxes with some tape around it (pretty much what that season 1 collection was...) at least that would make it easier for me as a buyer.

How hard can it be to sell me something called ""X-Men Evolution: Season 2 (The Whole Thing)""?

So anyway, great show, season 1 extras on the DVD were awesome, but I could really go for some season-at-a-time packaging.",1094688000,41,1019,4.298429319371728
2123237,5,B0002V7TYW,Mystique's revenge is a fun filled movie! The X-men vs The Brother Hood is a great good vs evil theme!,1367280000,,102,4.15
2123238,3,B0002V7TYW,another gift item for friends kids: they like it: can keep them entertained and out of trouble for a while,1363996800,,106,4.35
2123239,5,B0002V7TYW,"As I've said in my other reviews for this show, X-Men: Evolution is not the best kids' show out there, but it's got some good qualities.  My favorite element in the series is the Kurt/Nightcrawler character; I also like the high school setting and the anime style of the drawings, as well as the different scenarios the writers come up with.

This disc contains my favorite episode from this series, where Kurt works up the courage to ask a girl to the upcoming school dance, only to angst about his ""freakish"" appearance that he keeps hidden with a holographic image inducer.  Turns out that not only does Amanda genuinely like him, but she already knows about both his real looks and his teleportation ability, a situation which only gets more interesting when monsters overrun the school - just at a time when a traumatized Kurt has sworn to never use his powers again.  Although Amanda shows up again in a couple of later episodes, it would have been really cool if her and Kurt's relationship had received more attention.

Anyway, this disc also contains a Beast-centric episode, the introduction of Wanda / Scarlet Witch, and the season finale, which I liked better than both the first and third finales.  Wolverine gets kidnapped, Gambit and Colossus and a couple of others show up to fight the X-Men, Pietro betrays the Brotherhood, the identities of the mutants are revealed to the general public, we finally find out what Mystique's been up to - all great stuff.  This disc is highly recommended to any fan of X-Men: Evolution.",1297555200,,1537,4.777358490566038
2123240,4,B0002V7TYW,A pretty good ending to the second season.  I enjoyed it much more than the end of season 1.  Not a bad buy for any Marvel or X-Men fans.,1258848000,,137,3.689655172413793
2123241,5,B0002V7TYW,"I missed several of these episodes when originally aired, and am glad to get them. Interesting build-up to a cliffhanger, though with some obvious padding.",1249430400,,155,5.24
2123242,3,B0002V7TYW,I agree season 2 needed to be in one set. for this reason i have not given it a 4 or 5. I have season 3 in one boxset its nicer than in multiples and there should be a season 4 out because when it was on tv I recorded it they had a few episodes with apokolips but i never got the final big battle. I don't think they showed the last one. Amazon can creat one if they wanted this is the only place I have found the season 1 boxset SO THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE A SEASON 2 THE SAME WAY.,1157068800,,485,3.5849056603773586
2123243,5,B0002V7TYW,"This is the 4th volume for season 2.  This is by far the best of the DVDs for the X-Men evolution series.  I loved them all, but this was the best.  There were some very creative plot twists and things start to get a bit more intense.  I loved what they did with Wanda, The Scarlet Witch.  If you are an X-Men fan, you won't be disappointed.",1129939200,4,341,4.029850746268656
2123244,5,B0002V7TYW,"I'd only watched one episode of this X-Men cartoon before. Coincedentally enough, it was actually the first episode on this DVD. I don't think I'd ever watched it all the way through, though.

Like many of the WB Kids titles, X-Men Evolution is released with just a handful (5 in this case) of episodes per DVD. Unlike most (and perhaps all) of the other WB Kids title, they're actually in sequence. Mystique's Revenge is actually Season 2, Volume 4. My understanding after watching the trailers on the DVD is that Season 1 and Season 2 have each been released in their entirity on 4 DVD's apiece.

I'm a little upset that I had never caught this toon before. I honestly knew very little about it before watching this DVD. It is an excellent series. They have definitely changed things around from the comic book and even from the movie. Wolverine, Storm and Beast seem to be the resident adults, while others including Cyclops and Jean Grey have been made teenagers. As corny as that sounds, it actually seems to work out quite well, at least in these five episodes.

I'm not going to go into too much detail regarding the plot of the actual episodes. Some were lighter than others, but they did an excellent job leading into the 2-part season finale. Which leads to whyI'm now irritated. I loved the cartoon, and it was to be continued. The next one can't come out soon enough.",1104537600,4,1379,4.597560975609756

8032617,5,B0002V7TYW,Again I am a major nerd - used to watch this show on KIDS WB on Saturday mornings with a big bowl of cereal and the box and jug of milk by my legs. LOL! Its toned down due to it was geared towards kids - only draw back: it wasn't all packaged together like S3 which was all one set and they STILL have not realeased S4 on DVD! I love X-Men anyways!,1386288000,,348,3.7162162162162162
