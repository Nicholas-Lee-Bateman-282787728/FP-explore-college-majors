4372941,5,B004GHARKQ,"This is probably one of the funniest shows I have ever seen, and a delightful psuedo-parody of Heroes. In the words of the character Nathan: ""In what kind of f***ed up world would this be allowed to happen?""
The young cast is superb and play seamless, believable characters. Cinematography alone is noteworthy, and of course the script is brilliant.
If you at all like British humour, sci-fi, or just good entertainment, you will enjoy this.",1299542400,19,441,4.8933333333333335
4372942,5,B004GHARKQ,I hope US TV networks learn something from this.  This show clearly proves how writing is more important than effects.  The script is amazing and the cast and director really know what they are doing.  The effects get better in season two but I love the show so much I don't care. what,1298419200,14,285,4.339622641509434
4372943,5,B004GHARKQ,"Misfits is a show about five people who are around the age of 20 who have powers due to a storm.
Now, I won't lie. There are a few ""graphic"" scenes (basically, ""sex scenes"", bloody scenes, etc).
However, the show is hilarious and will bring laughter to those who are tired of generic TV shows that are dull.",1297123200,,307,4.310344827586207
4372944,1,B004GHARKQ,"I first watched this show when I was over in the UK visiting and it was on TV, but I only got to see a few episodes unfortunately and I wanted to buy the entire series so I could watch it in its entirety but alas they only make it for the UK, and I'm hoping that they will make it for the USA very soon because otherwise I have no way of watching this show :(",1296432000,6,359,3.675324675324675
4372945,5,B004GHARKQ,this is now my favorite show I definitely recommend it. unfortunately the don't air it here so buy it. I promise you won't regret it,1295740800,11,132,4.32
8428723,5,B004GHARKQ,This was something I watched on-line and fell in love with. It is crude and quite rude at times but the humor wouldn't be as strong if they sensored it. The story is quite creative and wish (kind of) that it could happen in real life. Imagine gaining a superhero quality in a matter of seconds. Besides people with cool and fun powers of course some gain less amazing and sometimes evil abilities...well maybe it's all in how you use it. I am one to cheer for the underdogs so this show was right up my ally. I also got season 3 and like it but not to spoil but season 4 there is less...actually like none of the original cast so I enjoy it but not as much.  Keep in mind this is Region 2 dvd so if you don't have an all region dvd/blu ray player don't purchase...it can't be played in U.S. otherwise. At least not yet...,1361491200,,821,4.13125
8428724,5,B004GHARKQ,I would definitely recommend this series to anyone who loves drama comedy and fantasy. I adore Robert Sheehan a.k.a. Nathan Young. Fast shipping plus is even more enjoyable because I have a multi-region DVD player to play it in :),1340582400,,230,4.775
8428725,5,B004GHARKQ,"An incredibly well written television show! The cast are perfect and the script is even better. I feel a lot of people gave this show a miss because the idea of it sounds a bit poor, however, watch the opening scene of episode one and i guarantee you will be hooked.",1335225600,,266,4.235294117647059
8428726,5,B004GHARKQ,I love this show!!!! It is one of the funniest and well written shows I have seen in a long time. They could not have put together a better cast of character and I am hooked!!! If you have never seen the show you'll be hooked after the first episode. You can go to [...] to watch every episode. It's the only site that you can watch it on. I can't wait until next week for the new episode. Enjoy!!,1327363200,,397,3.975
8428727,4,B004GHARKQ,"First a comment re: one of my pet peeves.  There were two-1* reviews, neither of which had anything to do with the merits of the show! Why must people taint a show with bad reviews when their issue has nothing to do with the show itself?  If Amazon truly screens reviews, then the aforementioned types of reviews should be taken down.  Perhaps a second category should be created for critique that has absolutely nothing to do with content.

So mine is the first non-5* vote.  With that said I like this show very, very much and would have added a 1/2* if allowed.

The Editorial summation is basic, but accurate.  Misfits is dark, funny and often violent with vulgarity and as much nudity as is allowed on British TV.

Word of warning for those of us that don't speak the ""King's English"".  Even as a frequent watcher of UK programming, I still couldn't understand +-20% of what Kelly was saying due to her accent.  For those not accustomed to UK slang, a UK version of the Urban Dictionary will come in handy!",1325980800,,1011,4.5054945054945055
8428728,5,B004GHARKQ,"From the very first episode, I was hooked!  Misfits is fresh, different, daring & unpredictable.  I was a fan of the NBC series Heroes, so this is a great substitute for the superheros missing in my TV viewing pleasure.  It's a must see if you like something different!  Can't wait to see season 3!",1323734400,,298,4.462962962962963
8428729,5,B004GHARKQ,"When I first heard about this show I had some reservations on if I would like it or not. It sounded interesting enough about a group of young offenders getting special powers and having to deal with their new abilities. But I wasn't sure if the concept would hold my attention.

After watching the first two seasons (or series as they call them) I'm hooked. I can't thank my son enough for turning me on to the show and when season 3 becomes available on dvd I will surely purchase it.

Guess until then I'll just have to watch the show online.",1323216000,,544,4.323529411764706
8428730,5,B004GHARKQ,"I wish more shows were written this well! I know they air it on Hulu now, but I wanted the DVD's too.",1321920000,,101,3.6363636363636362
8428731,1,B004GHARKQ,"I got the DVDs a couple weeks after I ordered it which I expected. When I was watching the show, it said often ""Skipping over damanged area."" So to be frank I was very disappointed with this order because I barely got to see what was on the dvds.",1311552000,,246,4.040816326530612
8428732,5,B004GHARKQ,"This is a seriously awesome, amazingly funny and completely twisted series you have to see to believe.  Unlike Heroes it has a great first season (or series as they say in the UK) and keeps it up on it's 2nd.  The running gag is completely sick but actually makes sense for the story, and every character shines with personality mix with demented absurdity.  There is a love story that take that redefines the term ""opposites attract.""  These are not your comic book ""get your powers and want to save the world.""  It's more like ""Get your powers and have a drink or smoke a joint. . .and save yourself.""  The powers aren't original, but how they work and what those who use them do shock, surprise and will make you laugh until you drop.  If you haven't seen this series yet, you're missing a gem.  I highly recommend it.",1308873600,,821,4.4630872483221475
