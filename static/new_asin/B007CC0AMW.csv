I needed to learn some new strategies to cope with school, plus I have nieces and nephews and these tips will be invaluable for them as well.  I'll certainly be able to pass on what I have learned.

If you need one-on-one attention, definitely consider taking a study skills course at your local college, but if that's not feasible then this program is the next best thing.

Time management and taking tests have always been a challenge for me, and now I have better strategies to handle both.  I've bought a few books in past on this same topic, but seeing and hearing it on video is a much better option in my opinion.",1359331200,,724,4.406015037593985
8620629,5,B007CC0AMW,"Going back to school later in life was a challenge and remembering how to study was sometime I needed to relearn.  This product helped me quickly and efficiently.  I also have a child in junior high and here study habits are typical so I was looking for something that could help both of us.  I watched the first two dvd's and couldn't believe how many things I didn't know about studying.

It was easy for me to learn and implement these techniques but for my daughter this was more difficult, so I decided to chunk it down into small bites. We'd watch a section together, talk about what we would try (as we are both in school) then give it a week to try out a new trick or technique.  It was fun as we both shared experiences from the week.  I really wish professor Scott had a program for k-6 kids (he may, but I haven't found it yet) but for older learners this have been invaluable.",1355011200,,888,4.255952380952381
