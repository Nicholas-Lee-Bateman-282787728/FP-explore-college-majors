8099819,5,B000CNWNF0,"This is an outstanding series which looks in-depth at several subjects which tremendously affected the world in the 20th Century. Do not confuse this series, ABC News Presents The Century with Peter Jennings, with one that was broadcast on The History Channel called The Century: America's Time with Peter Jennings. They are two completely different series with completely different material. They're both excellent in their own right, and a must for any 20th Century history buff.",1476748800,,481,5.342105263157895
