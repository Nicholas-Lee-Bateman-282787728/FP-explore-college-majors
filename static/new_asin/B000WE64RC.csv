8222999,1,B000WE64RC,"This video was painful to watch, mono toned and too many gimmicks to MAKE the horse do what he wanted it to do. I think for a person who is just trying to learn this could end up bad for the horse or person trying to use the techniques.  I waited too long to watch it so I could no longer return it, I unfortunately ordered I and II and am now stuck with them.",1460332800,,360,3.8

8223001,2,B000WE64RC,"For a total of $30.00 I was very disappointed in this video, half of it was the tools and how to wrap the legs....sorry would not recommend!",1419638400,,140,4.222222222222222
8223002,5,B000WE64RC,"I was hooked after watching Trick Horse Training Fundamentals I, and Trick Horse Training Fundamentals II did not disappoint!!! I have horses with a wide variety of temperaments and personalities, and Allen's techniques work for all of them. If I can figure out how to post a picture with this review, I will put one up so you can see this DVD in action--I was able to teach my horse to lay down, sit and sit up. They love these tricks as much as I do!",1306022400,4,452,4.267441860465116
