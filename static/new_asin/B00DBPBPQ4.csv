5787341,1,B00DBPBPQ4,"Three brothers make a bet and can't pay up. They must raise $25,000 quickly which includes a slow motion bikini car wash. Danny Trejo does his typical 30 second shirtless cameo and is gone from the film serving no purpose than selling the film. The humor, if you could call it that, was crude. The film was a stupid cleavage fest filled with jokes and gags that didn't work at all. Just a bunch of people acting like fools.

5787342,4,B00DBPBPQ4,This film has a great cast but the comedy is all over the place.  Maybe that's why you have two directors listed on the box.  It has some hilarious moments if you can get through some of the bad ones.,1380758400,,200,3.975

Don't like that they made it seem that Danny Trejo was the star, when he was only in maybe 5mins of the movie.  This flick will give u some laughs, ""elbows up, side to side"".",1501545600,,284,3.982456140350877

that will give more than a few hard laughs  Some thing for you too hit the switches on your hydraulics for on your

8591315,3,B00DBPBPQ4,"Yes, this movie was crude, rude, slapstick, a bit stupid, and there was a lot of gratuitous cleavage it in. There was no blood and gore whatsoever.  However, Perhaps because I am not Latino, I didn't get as many of the jokes as I should have.  There were many funny parts, especially when one of the hapless brothers tries to participate in the car wash--but that's also where the gratuitous cleavage comes in--but not from the brother.  I loved at the poke at their Mom and her cooking as they rave about it, and they turn their backs and she dumps the rest of it out of a huge restaurant can. However, what really surprised me was how much it reminded me of the Marx Brothers and the Three stooges--more the latter which is not a bad thing. You had the bald brother, the one with hair and the good looking one. So this could be the Latino Version of Larry, Moe and Curley (or Curley Joe and Shemp) or you had Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Geppo (?). You wouldn't know these guys unless you were around in the 30's 40's 50''s and a bit in the 60's. The last one was the good-looking one but he didn't last long hence I am not sure of his name.  Anyway, I believe this movie would be good for much younger, perhaps Latino audiences who would appreciate the jokes and who like silliness you'd find in a movie like the old three stooges short films.  As for the ""Trejo"" factor, it was practically non-existent save for a cameo, but at least it was shirtless. (Yay!)",1398470400,,1460,4.333333333333333
