5471163,1,B00AQJANI4,"So, here we go again -- another screw up? I am fed up with incorrect or missing episodes. Another good reason to buy an all-regions dvd player & buy the UK versions.
Well, shall we see what the screw up is this time?? We shall only really and truly find out when this latest dvd is released. In the meantime, it might be a good idea to just keep quiet about the contents. I hate being lied to.",1362873600,,393,4.051282051282051
5471164,5,B00AQJANI4,"Hello Summer Winers,
Well I'm back to give you another hopefully correct listing of this '98 series contents.  I first should correct my '97 listing review where I listed the '97 contents.  My apologies to you and my mistake was believing and cutting and pasting the then listed '97 contents from the BBC America site.  I actually cut and pasted the then BBC America listing of the '97 release contents when I posted that review, it turns out they later changed the contents and instead included ""Extra Extra"" as the special in the '97 release rather than the ""Here Comes The Groom"" special which the website then listed as part of it's contents.  So NOW it looks like, according to the BBC America website episode list of contents, ""Here Comes The Groom"" will be on this new '98 series DVD set rather than the '97 set.  I wish they could get it straight on what the contents are.  My apologies for quoting the source, who I thought knew best.

I don't believe I need to extoll the virtues of this series again, it's one of the very best.  I only wish these releases by BBC America would make crystal clear exactly what the episode contents are, both on the package itself, when you get it in your hands and list correctly the episodes on their own website and here on Amazon too.  Here then is another quote from BBC America's website as to the contents of this new '98 season's release.  If this is wrong, blame BBC America, now to the quotation of the episode listing:

There Goes the Groom - After drinking too much at a friend's stag do, Foggy passes out and is whisked off to Blackpool by the amorous village post-mistress. The last we hear is that she mistakenly believes he has proposed to her, and we never find out if he managed to wriggle out of it. We see Foggy slumped unconscious in this episode, but he has no dialogue. This episode also introduces the new third man, Herbert Trulove a.k.a. Truly.

Beware of the Oglethorpe - The trio meet a world-weary old school chum, and resolve not to go the same way.

Tarzan of the Towpath - The trio attempt to relive an old childhood tradition of rolling down a hill instead of walking, but it wasn't as easy as they thought!

Truly and the Hole Truth - Truly is determined to get his name in the paper as a local philanthropist, even if he has to con his way in!

Oh Howard, We Should Get One of Those - Could Wesley's new invention help Compo get close to Nora Batty than ever before?

The Suit That Attracts Blondes - Glenda gives one of Barry's suits away to a jumble sale, because she thinks it may cause him to be unfaithful- it soon falls into Compo's hands.

The Only Diesel Powered Saxophone in Captivity - Barry buys a saxophone from Auntie Wainwright, but Glenda won't let him play it indoors, so he has to find somewhere to practise.

Perfection-Thy Name is Ridley - An elderly widower named Walter Ridley is moving back to the village after several years' absence. Compo and Howard are both tired of hearing the women praise his name, and when Compo learns that Nora is going to help clean his house, he is not pleased.

Nowhere Particular - Howard buys a van, with plans to turn it into a love nest for himself and Marina, even buying some furniture for it. But nothing stays secret long when the trio get involved.

From Audrey Nash to the Widow Dilhooley - Truly learns that his childhood sweetheart is returning to the village, and decides to recreate their youthful meetings.

Support Your Local Skydiver - Compo is suspicious when Nora receives a postcard from Tenerife, as he is convinced she has an admirer. He takes up skydiving in yet another misguided attempt to impress her.",1361750400,13,3656,4.500756429652042
5471165,5,B00AQJANI4,Last of the Summer Wine is the best of British comedy. I watched all of the 1998 episodes on PBS over the years but wanted a CD copy to watch these wonderfully funny programs again. The CDs I received are of very high quality video and audio.,1361491200,8,242,4.170212765957447
5471166,5,B00AQJANI4,"The ""Editorial Review"" is directly from the press release which indicates ""Foggy"" is involved.  This is not the case if the product listing is correct as the last episode with ""Foggy"" was in series 18 which aired in 1997.  The press release/Editorial Review describes Series 15 from 1993 which has already seen a release (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-of-the-Summer-Wine-Vintage-1993/dp/B009A68ESA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last of the Summer Wine: Vintage 1993</a>).

Series 19 from 1998 is the first full series (aka season) with Frank Thornton as ""Truly"".  There was no ""Christmas Special"" produced for the 1998 series.  This is one of the last series with Bill Owen as ""Compo"".  He would complete series 20 and 3 episodes in series 21 before passing.

Here are the episodes from 1998 - series 19:

S19/E1 - 4 January 1998 ""Beware of the Oglethorpe"": The trio meet a world-weary old school chum, and resolve not to go the same way.

S19/E2 - 11 January 1998 ""Tarzan of the Towpath"": The trio attempt to relive an old childhood tradition of rolling down a hill instead of walking, but it wasn't as easy as they thought!

S19/E3 - 18 January 1998 ""Truly and the Hole Truth"": Truly is determined to get his name in the paper as a local philanthropist, even if he has to con his way in!

S19/E4 - 25 January 1998 ""Oh Howard, We Should Get One of Those"": Could Wesley's new invention help Compo get close to Nora Batty than ever before?

S19/E5 - 1 February 1998 ""The Suit That Attracts Blondes"": Glenda gives one of Barry's suits away to a jumble sale, because she thinks it may cause him to be unfaithful- it soon falls into Compo's hands.

S19/E7 - 15 February 1998 ""Perfection - Thy Name is Ridley"": An elderly widower named Walter Ridley is moving back to the village after several years' absence. Compo and Howard are both tired of hearing the women praise his name, and when Compo learns that Nora is going to help clean his house, he is not pleased.

S19/E8 - 22 February 1998 ""Nowhere Particular"": Howard buys a van, with plans to turn it into a love nest for himself and Marina, even buying some furniture for it. But nothing stays secret long when the trio get involved.

S19/E9 - 1 March 1998 ""From Audrey Nash to the Widow Dilhooley"": Truly learns that his childhood sweetheart is returning to the village, and decides to recreate their youthful meetings.

S19/E10 - 8 March 1998 ""Support Your Local Skydiver"": Compo is suspicious when Nora receives a postcard from Tenerife, as he is convinced she has an admirer. He takes up skydiving in yet another misguided attempt to impress her.

This is a gentle program that's known for its positive portrayal of older people and family-friendly humour.  It *can* take a few episodes for it to grow on you as it moves rather slowly with its portrayal of a very laid back country lifestyle and antics of a trio of retirees.  Give it a few episodes and you'll be hooked!",1356652800,41,3165,4.825925925925926

5471179,4,B00AQJANI4,"There was change in the air in the 1998 season of ""Last of the Summer Wine""... the incomparable Foggy Dewhurst (Brian Wilde) departed once again from this show (Wilde was struck with shingles and bowed out for good despite a full recovery and living until 2008).  Now another Britcom vet steps into the shoes of the so-called ""third man"", Frank Thornton of ""Are You Being Served?"" fame is now Herbert ""Truly"" Truelove and would become the longest serving third man of Summer Wine's history.
The change of man brought a much needed shake-up to Summer Wine.  The show's early 90s years with Foggy suffered from too many formulaic plots (a criticism leveled at this show frequently as it went on and on and on).  Although there would always be a formulaic element to the show, the 1998 season sees episodes with a little more variety to them.  Clegg (Peter Sallis) and Compo (Bill Owen) remain just as mischievous and irrepressible and Truly is much more relaxed than Foggy, making for some delightfully funny situations.  Exploits here range from enjoying being towed down the river in a barge (by Compo no less!), a saxophone in an ostrich (yes you read that right!), a mobile bed, a tan suit that attracts blondes, and skydiving!  The three leads are just as good a trio as the best of the Foggy years and there seems to be a greater emphasis at fighting off the fact that they really are old men (especially in the first episode).
Time has not been kind to this amazing little program.  Summer Wine has faced indifference from it's own network and criticism by those who don't see the joyous humor created by Roy Clarke and the actors.  Still, there are some good years left and 1998 is definitely one of them!",1420070400,2,1711,4.642384105960265

5471203,5,B00AQJANI4,"This is another great DVD for Last of the Summer Wine.  I especially like the episode ""There Goes the Groom"" which is the transition from Foggy (Brian Wilde) to Truly (Frank Thornton).  It was very well done with the hope that Foggy would be able to come back, but didn't take away from the story that he was unable to and Truly stayed in the role.  My particular favorite in this series is "" Oh Howard, We Should Get One of Those"" when Compo finally gets Nora in bed with him.

I know the Dark Shadows drama was released as a complete series of more than 1,000 episodes.  I believe LOTSW has just over 300 episodes.

Being a little hard of hearing, I especially appreciate the subtitles options.  I have never figured out the ""closed captions"" feature of my TV or VCR player.  With the subtitles on the disc, I can click ""on"" and be able to understand every word.

8556402,5,B00AQJANI4,"Nothing compares with these much-loved old characters wandering the beautiful Yorkshire hills around Holmfirth.

As many years as I have been watching them, I must have seen each episode at least six or seven times, and always come back to Last of the Summer Wine for another viewing of all the many episodes (at least the ones that we can get currently in the US).

What starts as seeming somewhat slow becomes addictive as one begins to feel as though they know the characters.  I have felt a real sense of loss each time one of the actors has died, over the years.

I have lost all hope of seeing anything like this again in this life.  But, if you like this, you might very well like ""New Tricks,"" which is in a way, a mystery version of LotSW -- older, retired policemen form a unit to re-investigate cold cases, and with many shenanigans, they proceed to solve those old cases.",1485561600,,883,4.459627329192546
