7916965,5,B00003BE0O,"So you've seen a couple of the installments of the Record of the Lodoss War...  Wondering how the rest of it is; is it any good, does it get better, does ashram get his coveted scepter?  This series goes no where but  uphill.  Katsumi Hasegawa masterfully continues the series with a new  character introduction and  continued plot developments.  Holy City is one  of the better installments of the series, and the three episodes on this  tape go together well and work as a cohesive unit for plot continuation.  The animation continues to be top notch.",961545600,,553,4.726315789473684
7916966,4,B00003BE0O,"This volume continues the high quality of animation and story telling which has been a cornerstone of the Lodoss War series for many years.  I don't find this story as involving as the original, or even the beginning  of the Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, but it's still enjoyable.  We are  finally reintroduced to Etoh who we haven't seen the original series.  While in the original series, Etoh was never a central figure, here he  seems even more remote and serves little purpose other than to be able to  say he's in it.  As king of Valis, he is a poor successor to the strong and  noble King Fahn.  Given the legendary strength of the Kingdom of Valis,  it's clear he has neither the charisma nor the leadership ability of Fahn.  Spark seems to have finally found himself though.  He has finally found a  cause and purpose of his own, apart from his blind desire to be a knight of  Flame.  This may represent a turning point in the story and I am looking  forward to the next tape in the series.
This tape does not represent a  complete story, or even the beginning of a story.  If you're new to Lodoss,  start with the original series, or at least the first tape of this series.  Buying this tape would be like walking in in the middle of the movie.  If  you're already collecting this series, I can recommend this tape.",950572800,,1328,4.419087136929461
