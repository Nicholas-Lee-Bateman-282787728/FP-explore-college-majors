Fans of Genshiken will enjoy watching a fully formed storyline, from beginning to end, involving the characters of the anime/manga that our favorite otaku are obsessed with.

Each volume also includes a Genshiken OVA, which introduces Oguie Chika's character into the storyline. Also, for those who aren't familiar with this or the Genshiken series, this anime contains adult themes and, as such, is not recommended for children.",1208217600,3,1066,6.202702702702703
