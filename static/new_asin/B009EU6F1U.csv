5323049,5,B009EU6F1U,This movie is one of the best movies of the summer I have watched 3 times in 8 days very well made movie  I think the the ending could have been better but other then that I will buy it when it comes out,1346025600,4,203,3.6136363636363638
5323050,3,B009EU6F1U,"While Dax Shepard (writer, actor, co-director) didn't strike pay dirt with this romantic action comedy, he certainly put a smile on my face.  Shepard plays Charlie Bronson (nee Yul Perkins) who is in witness protection in a small northern California town.  He does strike gold, however, when he finds a loving relationship with Annie (real life mate Kristen Bell).  She is a professor at the local college but is about to lose her job due to budget cuts.

Her boss is played by a hilarious Kristin Chenoweth.  Given Annie's doctorate is in nonviolent conflict resolution (admit it, that's funny) her options are limited.  She finds a possible job in Los Angeles, but that means if she drags Charlie along, he will have to leave his protected status.  Of course he does and that's when the Keystone Kops chase begins.

One of his pursuers is an incompetent federal marshal (Tom Arnold) who is also a friend.  Another is Alex (a dreadlocked Bradley Cooper) who was Charlie/Yul's bank robbing partner.  He's accompanied by Yul's former girlfriend played by Joy Bryant who is also Shepard's lover on the TV show ""Parenthood.""  Then there's an old boyfriend (Michael Rosenbaum) of Annie's.  His gay brother is a county deputy sheriff looking for romance.

Bell and Shepard are great together as they take time to argue about the use of a disparaging word for homosexuals and whether Charlie's hot rod Lincoln Continental is an appropriate vehicle for the couple.  Besides Chenoweth, Cooper steals most of his scenes especially after he confronts Charlie.  Granted some of the jokes fall flat and some of the bits just seem to be added for length.  But overall this is a pleasant, sometimes vulgar road trippin' movie with some terrific stunt driving.

Warning:  You'll want to close your eyes when Charlie and Annie mistakenly walk in on a foursome of septuagenarians au naturale.",1345852800,,1875,4.955128205128205

5323060,5,B009EU6F1U,"I don't know why I love this movie.  Lots of plot holes, lots of ridiculous dialogue, and gratuitous gay humor.  Oh, I know why; because the Pro-Modded Lincoln is simply awesome and Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard have great chemistry.  Bradley Cooper with dreadlocks and wearing a track suit is just hilarious.  Some great jokes and fun chase scenes.  I don't know why I gave it five stars; it could have been so much better with some more inventive chase scenes, some cleaned up dialogue and plot holes, and a little more character development.  But that Lincoln doing donuts to Aerosmith's Sweet Emotion just made the movie awesome.",1495065600,,632,4.805555555555555
5323061,5,B009EU6F1U,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I found it fun and genuine. It's a good old fashioned comedy that keeps the laughs coming even after the fifth veiwing,1494374400,,151,4.62962962962963
5323062,3,B009EU6F1U,I watched this for one reason.  Kristen Bell.  She is one of my top six favorite actresses.  The movie is o.k.  but it wouldn't have been as good as if somebody else would have been in it.  She get's a job in L.A. and Dax Shepard who is her real life boyfriend and now husband takes her there.  He has a past that she doesn't know about.  And the closer they get to L.A. the more of the past she finds out him.  This movie tries to be a little bit like the Fast And The Furious or Gone In Sixty Seconds.  But the car chases and driving aren't really up to those.  It works okay as a an action comedy.  It's not something you want to watch and then turn around and watch too soon again.  Except for Kristen Bell.,1494288000,,711,3.9645390070921986

5323100,1,B009EU6F1U,picked this up at the local .99 cent store - the premium - blu / dvd / digital copy.  agenda driven propaganda - that has less to do with cars & action - & more to do with pushing an agenda.  the cars are fair at best ... & in no way make up for the films downsides.  also - uncalled for senior / obese nudity - that can't be 'unseen' - as well.  if I don't like a show - I'll donate it if it has redeeming value - NOT this one - it 's trash can filler - except for the empty 2 disc blu case.  recommendation:  AVOID!!,1471910400,,518,3.6636363636363636

5323114,2,B009EU6F1U,I had high hopes for this movie because I am a Dax Shepard fan.  But this movie is nothing to write home about.  You can tell the movie had an extremely low budget.  Most of the car chases are on back roads and what look like abandoned airfields or military bases.  And it will be obvious that Cadillac must have paid some money for product placement (you'll see why).  And you'll swear that Shepard just learned that cards and drift around tight turns because there are what seems like endless shots of just that.  So many it starts to get annoying.  It looks like something I would have made if someone gave me a fast car and told me to make a movie when I was 10!  The dialog scenes between Shepard and Bell are okay.  And Tom Arnold is funny.  But there are just too may shortcomings for this movie to be enjoyed.,1464825600,,817,4.246753246753247

5323152,5,B009EU6F1U,"Hilarious.  Everyone will find something to be offended by in this film.  For me, it was scene-stealer Kristin Chenowith's performance as a cynical counselor at a low-end college.  Still, the moments of ridiculous offense are balanced well with other characters who have a moral center.  This movie is heartwarming, hilarious, and high-speed.

The main characters are played by Kristen Bell, Dax Shephard and Bradley Cooper (who is adorable in dread locks, but really shows his acting chops here).  Tom Arnold has a minor, but important, role and delivers some of the best laughs in the movie.  This is not academy award material, although I think there should be separate categories for Drama and Comedy because it is a lot more difficult to make a really good comedy than a drama, but if you are in a laid-back mood and don't take it seriously, I think you will enjoy this very much.",1418947200,,689,4.669421487603306

5323296,4,B009EU6F1U,"I don't usually do movie reviews, but I had a few extra seconds and thought I'd give this one a shot. I remember seeing previews for this, and debated going to see it in theaters, but didn't. I was sorting through Netflix today and saw it on there, remembered it, and thought ""Hey, why not"". It was actually a decent film. It had a 2 million dollar budget, half of which was spent on music rights, so really the film had a 1 million dollar budget. And for 1 million, the cameras looked great, the cast was much more well known than I was expecting, and overall it was pretty good. Acting obviously didn't win any Oscars, but it was fairly decent. Shepard and Bell, being married in real life, had great chemistry and worked extremely well together. Bradley Cooper, while I love him to death, his character didn't have any real depth and almost seemed like a last minute add on that they decided to write into the story. The car stunts were pretty awesome, and I actually learned that because it was such a low budget film that Dax Shepard did most of his stunt work himself, so props to him for being a great driver.

The only real complaints I have was that the story felt pretty disjointed at times, and didn't feel like the people were making choices that they really would. Maybe they had to trim down some of footage or something? Either way it felt like it was missing a little something.. Like there were lots of random genres that were loosely tied together and while it worked, it felt like they could have done better with it.

Parents: I figure I'll start adding a parents section to those who care or are wondering. One of the things that it's rated R for is ""pervasive language"", and I didn't really think there was all that much. F bombs were dropped throughout the movie, but only in bursts. Ex: A character at one point runs his car into someone's lawn and onto some of their decorative pieces, and starts cursing and dropping the F word because he's mad. So stuff like that. The only real thing that grossed me out, but also made me laugh, was there are two points where the main characters walk into a motel room with a bunch of old people engaged in... activities. Full frontal male and female nudity it seen, but it is played for comedic effect, so you be the judge there. Really not much violence, probably the worst is a character gets hit in the face and gets a bloody nose, with blood running down his face. Overall not too bad, as the nudity is quick, maybe a 10 second scene each time.

All in all, it's definitely worth a watch once. Would I buy it? If it were in the $5 movie bin, or half off at $7.50. If it gets right down to it, it's got Kristen Bell in it. That in of itself deserves a watch ;)",1413504000,2,2726,4.309941520467836

5323320,3,B009EU6F1U,"Hit & Run is a wild ride that never should have worked, but surprisingly it does. The story doesn't appear to be deep or complicated, and just when you think they've come to the end, a whole other angle begins. The film is further helped by a large cast and a whole bunch of interesting cameos, that help take it to another level. Charlie Bronson (Dax Shepard) is happy living in a small town with his girlfriend, Annie (Kristen Bell), but things are about to change. When Annie gets offered a job in L.A., Bronson must decide whether or not to go with her, which also means leaving the safety of the witness protection program. When a jealous ex learns of the plan, he finds out who Charlie really is, and thanks to Facebook, connects with the men he's hiding from, making the trip to L.A. a dash for safety, across California. Dax Shepard is not an actor I find to be very funny, but this was the first time I've seen him play a character as deep as Charlie Bronson, and he was terrific. He is being perused by Bradley Cooper of all people, who I did not see as someone who could play the bad guy. His good looks and charming personality, don't exactly lead one to believe he'd be believable as a bad guy, and while he wasn't the toughest bad guy I've ever seen, he does more than an adequate job. Hit & Run isn't an award winning film, it may not even be all that memorable, but it is extremely entertaining and an edge of your seat thriller ride. The perfect film for those who want to just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.",1407024000,,1531,4.2827586206896555

The first scene, when I saw it, made me cringe and want to ""blow my groceries"", but the second scene I knew what to expect and found it somewhat comical.  The movie wanders all over the place and is not very believable, at least in my opinion.  I'm not a Tom Arnold fan at all, but this movie was perfect for him and he did a great job as a bumbling Marshall.  He was my favorite part of the movie.  Would I buy it for more than $5?  No way.

If you can't handle extreme obscentities, don't bother, because there is tons of gratituous cursing, but if you can, this is a great film with a sweet romantic element that'll leave you smiling. I'm a huge fan of Dax Shepard (currently on Parenthood) who co-wrote this movie.  And his wife Kristen Bell has been one of our favorite ""good girl"" actresses for years, so maybe we're a bit biased.

There are at least three crazy racing scenes and an insane road trip, then add Tom Arnold at his best. Throw Bradley Cooper (It's not just dog food!!!) into the mix, and this movie was great fun. Tons of action and minor brutality, but nothing so gross you get sickened by blood spills.

The unorthodox relationship between Dax (Yul or Charlie Bronson) and Kristen (Annie) is the cohesive heart of this feel-good film. It's a date night movie and got my wife in such a great mood, she cooked my favorite meal.

5323377,3,B009EU6F1U,"I watched Hit & Run on DVD and loved it.  It is a strange story with unusual and interesting characters.  I'm not really into cars but I liked the cars in the movie.  This movie is a self described chase movie which I don't usually watch but this one was interesting and fun.

I decided to buy the movie on Blu Ray because I thought the audio would be even better than on the DVD.  The audio was DTS Master Audio but I was really disappointed.  I thought that on DTS the engines would really roar and even shake my house a bit.  The sound in this movie didn't have the dynamic range I expected and wanted.  It was a missed opportunity by the people making this movie.  The one good thing was that the soundtrack (music) didn't overpower the dialogue because it was just as level as the rest of the audio.

I think that one of the crucial components in making any kind of action or chase movie today is stepping up the game with the audio.  Cars should have a deep throaty roar that shakes the house and can be felt in my chest, breaking glass should have a clear crisp tinkling and sometimes the source of sound should move from speaker to speaker to enhance the motion on the screen.  There should also be a lot of range in volume.  A quiet conversation can be quiet but when the action starts it should be loud enough to add to the excitement.  The soundtrack should be loud enough to add to the excitement and mood of the movie as well but not overpower the dialogue.  This movie at least did that well.

When I watched my first Blu Ray movie the crisp clear video was exactly what I expected.  The uncompressed audio, however, just blew me away.  I was amazed at the audio in the same way I was amazed by the clear video when I first watched a DVD after watching VHS all my life.  I gave this movie three stars because the audio in this movie didn't live up to its potential.  It would have added a lot to the movie if it had.",1378857600,,1930,4.178861788617886

It was more of a love story of a car aficionado than that of the main characters.

5323395,4,B009EU6F1U,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

In the world of film it's becoming increasingly apparent that a movie's title can make or break its success. You have the pop culture flicks like Transformers and Fast and Furious, the books-turned-movie franchises like Harry Potter and Twilight, everything else in between, and then you have Hit & Run. At first glance, nothing about the film is appealing: the title, the cover, the fact that Bradley Cooper is sporting dreadlocks. From the gate it already has so much going against it. So why was it so good? How is it possible that this film - which seemed destined to be a train wreck - managed to give me one of the funnest cinematic experiences I've had in months?

Well, to be honest, there's multiple reasons. There's the honest chemistry between the two leads, the carefree script, and the overall fun nature of the film. There was never a point in Hit & Run where I went, ""Ok, this is a bit much."" In other words, I never felt overwhelmed. You have the action-oriented side of the film and then you have the comedic side. What Dax Shepard did extremely well was find that balance between the two. It never felt like he favored one of these elements over the other and it always felt genuine. Hell, he was even able to throw in a bit of romance and social commentary for good measure. I mean, why not right?

Hit & Run follows the life of Charlie Bronson (Shepard), a man who was put into witness protection four years ago. He's currently living in Milton, California with his girlfriend Annie Bean (Kristen Bell), a professor at a local college. As we all know, you can't leave your area once you're put into witness protection. Unfortunately, Annie recently got offered an interview at the University of California for a job in the field she created herself. While hesitant at first, Charlie decides that she should go and that he would go with her. Things quickly get out of hand as Charlie and Annie are chased by Charlie's supervisor Randy (Tom Arnold), Annie's ex-boyfriend Gil (Michael Rosenbaum), and Charlie's ex-friend Alex (Cooper). All she wanted to do was go to her interview!

What surprised me most was all the social commentary scattered throughout the film. Whether it was society's insensitiveness towards certain words like ""f**"", how we constantly stereotype people, or our constant impulse to judge someone because of their past instead of looking at who they are now; I mean, they covered it all. What made it better was the fact that it all felt natural. It didn't feel like they threw it in at the last second because they wanted to make the movie seem more appealing to a greater audience. Everything seemed to work perfectly and nothing felt out of place. Major props to Shepard for that.

Also, the on-screen relationship between Charlie and Annie was very well written. While at times I felt Annie was being a bit annoying, especially when she found out the truth about Charlie, I loved that Charlie never got out of hand. He called her out on her being judgmental just like she called him out on being insensitive. Not only that, but the fact that Shepard and Bell are in a relationship in real life translates really well on screen. It helps breathe a certain purity to the characters' relationship which is something you don't see often. They're completely comfortable with each other which allows their relationship to feel authentic.

Finally, the casting in the film is extremely well done. Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard are great together and part of that has to do with their relationship in real life. Then you have Tom Arnold who was a riot in almost every scene he was in. Similarly, Bradley Cooper gave another great performance as Alex. I don't know what it is about him, but he seems to nail every performance he takes on. As the film reaches it's final twenty minutes or so you're greeted with a few familiar faces. Beau Bridges appears as Charlie's dad, Jason Bateman appears as a U.S. Marshal, and Sean Hayes appears as Sandy Osterman, the professor who interviews Annie. It's always nice to see Bateman in a film and I can't even remember the last time I saw Sean Hayes in something.

Overall Score: 8/10 - I must admit that I was not expecting to like this film as much as I did. It's smart, it's funny, and it's a fun ride from start to finish. It's one of those movies that doesn't try to achieve some big goal. It's there to entertain and that's exactly what it did. It does that all while giving you some great social commentary and a nice cast. Overall, Hit & Run is a very well-rounded movie that exceeded my expectations. Definitely recommend you check this out if you have the time.",1373414400,,4696,4.650602409638554

5323400,4,B009EU6F1U,"There are scenes in Hit & Run that are LMFAO funny, especially the moment with the old swingers. It was so unexpected and gave me a real good chuckle. The film strengths are in its characters and dialogue along with the chemistry of Kristin Bell & Dax Shephard.

I would also have loved to see this movie as a crime drama because of its plot and especially Bradley Cooper's Alex Dmitri. I thought his whole dog-loving criminal attitude was a breath of fresh air from the usual movie criminal personality.

That being said, my favorite character was Debbie, the MILF (at least she looks like one) that gets Annie the interview. She was great and hilarious. I also think Kristen Bell is an absolute star. Dax Shephard has a sort of commanding presence onscreen and and it's why I'd like to see him in something along the drama/thriller/psychological horror genre.

Some other notes: The scenery on the drive from Milton to LA was lovely and I thought it was a great idea by the moviemakers (you and your partner, I imagine) to film that one scene in the orange grove. Where were those road trip scenes? Central California Coast? Great scenery there.

My only criticism really is that I thought some of the violence was a little too violent for a comedy but that's just me. All in all, I thought it was a very funny & entertaining movie. I think the Shephard/Bell chemistry definitely comes across on screen and it'd be nice to see them in another movie together.",1371427200,,1460,4.6038461538461535

5323403,3,B009EU6F1U,"Dax Shepard writes, stars and co-directs (with David Palmer) in ""Hit and Run,"" a comedy about ""Charles Bronson"" living in a small town in California, with his girlfriend Annie Bean (Kristen Bell). ""Charles Bronson"" is shocked to hear that Annie, specializing in nonviolent conflict resolution, has a job interview for a department chair position in Los Angeles. But ""Charles Bronson"" - of course, this is not his real name - cannot go to Los Angeles, where he left his troubled past four years ago.

Well, in fact the film is nothing serious. Filled with quirky dialogue and eccentric characters, ""Hit and Run"" is an action comedy that leans towards comedy, or comedy of off-the-wall humor. Made on a budget of $2 million (half of which was reportedly spent to secure music rights), the action scenes of ""Hit and Run"" are modest at best.

As a comedy, however, this is really a mixed bag. The leading characters are likable, with charming Kristen Bell, but their storyline is predictable and forgettable. The antics are unpredictable and often funny, but random and repetitions. Cars are so cool, and so is the soundtrack music. Oh, and I almost forgot Bradley Cooper. He plays a role that is not very interesting.

""Hit and Run"" is a comedy, uneven in tone, with more creative ideas than its generic title suggests, but really in need of a better script.",1370476800,5,1355,4.831896551724138

5323406,4,B009EU6F1U,"Not too many movies around that have this kind of exuberance. This moves like a freight train but you might not want to get out of the way.

Here's the scoop. Yul Perkins (writer/director Dax Shepard) is in the witness protection program with Tom Arnold as his protector. His girlfriend Annie Bean (Kristen Bell) has received a once in a lifetime job offer in Los Angeles. Does Yul break cover for the girl he loves, and if he does, what are the consequences?

I found this entirely engaging. The set up is pretty basic, but, as in any good plot, the details are doled out slowly so the picture becomes more subtle and involved as things progress. Yul is a cool character. He is truly trying to turn his life around and his girl Annie is a big part of that. They have some very witty, Tarantino-esque conversations. They feel good together. The other characters are written well also. Brad Cooper, as Alex Dimitri, is a real card. Too many movies write their villains as shallow, and/or stupid tough guys. He's anything but. His dog food scene alone is worth the price of admission. About the weakest link here is Tom Arnold.  I like Tom Arnold. He plays a good second banana, but he is simply too inept to be a Federal Marshall. This is a crazy bunch of people with their own back stories, but the way all the factions come together is really cool and unexpected. Yes there's tension but these folks aren't just shooting at each other and threatening each other. They're having these really great conversations. The car chase scenes are directed really well. Car chases are such old news, it's always good to see some that rise above the fray.

This is a way fun movie. It's tense, funny, clever, well acted and well directed. Is it great art? No. But it delivers, in spades, what it sets out to deliver.",1369612800,2,1805,4.52760736196319

5323474,3,B009EU6F1U,"HIT AND RUN is an odd, but oddly entertaining movie.  Not exactly a comedy.  Not a drama.  Not quite an action film.  I guess it could best be summarized as a comedic action romance.

Dax Shepard plays Charles Bronson (not the movie star), a former bank robbery getaway driver who is currently in witness protection, currently living in small town California.  He's in a strong relationship with a community college teacher (Kristen Bell) and they seem blissfully happy.  Shepard is friendly with his hapless witness protection marshal (Tom Arnold, less annoying than usual), and other than the fact that Shepard doesn't seem to have an action job...all is well.

Things are turned upside down, though, when Bell is a) fired from her current gig and b) given the opportunity to get her dream job at a university in Los Angeles.  Shepard decides he's going to leave his safe environment and follow her to LA...and this triggers a series of unfortunate events culminating in numerous chase scenes, confrontations and misunderstandings.  Eventually, Shepard must confront those whom he betrayed, including his former partner in crime, the Adidas track suit wearing, dreadlocked Bradley Cooper.  Measured chaos ensues.

In some ways, this movie wants to be a breezy action comedy, light and fun.  But the script is also heavily focused on its dialogue, so it feels a little bit like a lightweight Tarantino film, with these scruffy characters being FAR TOO articulate.  Or, perhaps, it feels a little like an action film Woody Allen might have written.  And it tries a bit too hard to make Dax Shepard into a romantic figure.  He speaks poetically to Bell...he's Mr. Sensitive.  And the film was co-directed by Shepard...which to me means he didn't understand that he's not always convincing in this role.  There's no reason he can't be convincing as a romantic...but he's often filmed in dewy-eyed close-up.  He almost teeters into parody.  His character is interesting and unusual, but not always convincing.  I guess if I had to sum it up, it appears that Shepard wanted HIT AND RUN to be the vehicle that turned him into a star...and he misses the mark fairly widely.

Kristen Bell is pleasant enough, but I didn't feel her character was as well rounded.  And the frequent close-ups on her face, unfortunately, revealed the copious amounts of makeup she was wearing.  I mention this because I'm NEVER aware of this sort of thing...but her character is supposed to be ""Fresh-faced"" and thus, the heavy makeup was a bit jarring.  I admit, this is a really minor quibble...but for some reason, it stood out for me.

Cooper, though an unbelievable character in many ways, is perhaps the most purely amusing character.  He's ridiculous and dangerous.  The conception of his character is over-the-top, yet he downplays it and makes it as ""real"" as possible.

The movie is peppered with interesting cameos.  Kristen Chenoweth and Sean Hayes come across as bad caricatures.  Jason Bateman appears in a scene for no good reason.  David Koechner pops up.  Beau Bridges actually has a couple of nice moments.

There are chase scenes, but in general, they are not anything special.  (Although good laughs are to be had at the expense of Tom Arnold and the mini-van he drives.)  The scenery is lovely.  There are certainly scattered laughs to be had throughout, and the film was never dull.  But it's just too quirky in an uncontrolled way to really work.  I give it a VERY modest recommendation, because it does have a fair amount of imagination and originality.  But it can't quite shake the ""Dax Shepard vanity project"" vibe, and thus is less than satisfying.",1366329600,,3649,4.927750410509031

Amazon lists this as Action-Comedy (or possibly Comedy-Action). It is neither.

It is NOT funny (except for Tom Arnold launching a bowling ball through a mini-van and Beau Bridges punching a guy for and extended period but together that amounts to 1 minute of screen time. In fact there is a cameo by David Koechner...in a semi-serious role, ie not funny).

It has 4-5 car chases, each one about 5 minutes long. No serious car crashes, no big explosion. Near the end there is a car jump that is shown from like 10 different angles in slow-motion. None of it very exciting or compelling.

Then we have another admirer of Kristen who becomes maniacal in his obsession to protect her from her current boyfriend.

And normally a mix of the two would be fine, but in this case, it cant do either well.  The action is stupid and like the car chases goes in circles too many times.

I'm not saying Mr. Shepard would be bad at any ONE of these roles, but for a movie to work, you have to separate all those roles to provide a critical eye to what each of the other people have done.  A good director would have cut some of the things in the script, and would have re-imagined some of the scenes to make them work better.  The pro-gay rights themes that were jammed into this movie were done so with the subtlety of a sledge hammer.

This could have been a fairly decent movie with an objective director, producer, and writer, but when they are all the same person, there is no interplay between those roles, no one saying, ""We need to cut this part,"" or ""I've got a better way to do this scene.""

As for me, I thought it was pretty funny and cool. This was certainly not a movie written in typical Hollywood fashion, but if you've ever watched anything Dax has written and/or directed before and enjoyed it, you'll probably like this. There aren't really a lot of highs and lows. rather, it kind of meanders through an idea. In this case, the idea is that a relationship can survive quite a bit. I thought the acting was actually quite superior to previous efforts like ""Let's Go To Prison"" for example. I don't know. This isn't a movie that can be decided on by reading reviews in my opinion. You just gotta watch it and either like it or dont. It has that undefinable certain something that some people love and others hate. It does have some very recognizable people from Bradley Cooper to Tom Arnold, and of course Kristen Bell is no slouch either.

Ultimately, I really enjoyed it, but don't expect a fast paced script, even with all the chase scenes and what have you. this movie is really more about introspection with a humorous delivery.",1359158400,,1186,4.62085308056872

With the case of this movie it almost should not have mattered how bad the plot or writing, they are a great cast.

The problem is that Dax sheppard is terrible, not sure how he has a career, but he brings down all the actors in this movie who are very funny and talented.

The plot and writing are not great.

The biggest problem with the film was it didn't know what it wanted to be. The tone was all over the place. I feel if the film had had a better director to tighten up the hinges, we could've had an underrated comedy classic on our hands. But instead we have an entertaining, run of the mill action comedy.

The chemistry between Kristen Bell and Dax Shepherd is adorable.  Kristen Bell plays a classy, cute and very intelligent woman, and Dax Shepherd is the ""used to be a bad boy"" guy who just adores her for who she is.  Normally movies like that can seem so far fetched because you think what classy gorgeous woman would fall for a guy like that?  But in this movie it really works.  It's adorable.  Be advised, some people may be offended by some of the humor and the things they discuss.  Personally, I think that is partly what makes the movie work.

Pretty girl, goofy/loveable protagonist, silly/dumb sidekick, cast-off former boyfriend/jerk, and strangely moral and almost likeable villian, all of which should make for a good comedy, are thrown from stupid/ugly/mean/vulgar situation that all distract from the story and remind you how badly the scriptwriters and director can screw up even the best of situation comedies.  My opinion - don't waste your time or money.

I loved the idea of the plot, have liked most of the movies the other actors have been in, and think they provided most of the reason it held my attention, (or lack of due to circumstances).  For me it provided a constant, low key humor, which was a nice distraction and Chang of pace from my usual choice of drama's, foreign
Mystery, and action.
The main negative was the complete unrealistic approach to realty, but I guess that was the idea.  I could never buy into the witness p. program being handled in such a fashion, at the same time once I let go of what ""would be"", I enjoyed the complete impossibility of it all and just rode with it.

If nothing more than to grab a few laughs i'd say do yourself a favor and give this movie a quick view. Yes the jokes are immature, very tongue and cheek, but i find that stuff amusing and funny. I enjoy when a writer/producer inputs dialogue in a movie that you'd hear every day at work or around your buddies. Far too often to comedy movies try to hard to be funny and fall flat. This movie I found to be very ""real"" and i don't mean the premise, i mean the conversations and chaos that ensues with almost every scene. A quick example would be when Dax calls Kristen's ex-boyfriend a ""f**"" only to be confronted with great detest from Kristen after she realizes she used that word instead of something more ""appropriate."" Again, it's simple dialogue, but something i pretty hilarious. Definately no award winners here, but then again the movie doesnt try to be something that its not.

The only reason I ""rented"" the thing is Bradley Cooper, whose talent is wasted here. Even if I had looked up reviews beforehand, I would have gotten all these four-star reviews, giving me a false positive. OK, here's what I didn't like:
1. Shepard's unkempt, straggly hair
2. Bell's character has a PHD, yet she is dressed in jeans for a serious job interview
3. Tom Arnold plays a marshal, inept in every way. Tom, stop playing these demeaning roles. You actually have talent.
4. Contains a silly app which helps find a gay partner

5323754,4,B009EU6F1U,"While Dax Shepard (writer, actor, co-director) didn't strike pay dirt with this romantic action comedy, he certainly put a smile on my face. Shepard plays Charlie Bronson (nee Yul Perkins) who is in witness protection in a small northern California town. He does strike gold, however, when he finds a loving relationship with Annie (real life mate Kristen Bell).

She is a professor at the local college but is about to lose her job due to budget cuts. Her boss is played by a hilarious Kristin Chenoweth. Given Annie's doctorate is in nonviolent conflict resolution (admit it, that's funny) her options are limited. She finds a possible job in Los Angeles, but that means if she drags Charlie along, he will have to leave his protected status. Of course he does and that's when the Keystone Kops chase begins.

One of his pursuers is an incompetent federal marshal (Tom Arnold) who is also a friend. Another is Alex (a dreadlocked Bradley Cooper) who was Charlie/Yul's bank robbing partner. He's accompanied by Yul's former girlfriend played by Joy Bryant who also is Shepard's lover on the TV show ""Parenthood."" Then there's an old boyfriend (Michael Rosenbaum) of Annie's. His gay brother is a county deputy sheriff looking for romance.

Bell and Shepard are great together as they take time to argue about the use of slang term for gays and whether Charlie's hot rod Lincoln Continental is an appropriate vehicle for the couple. Besides Chenoweth, Cooper steals most of his scenes especially after he confronts Charlie. Granted some of the jokes fall flat and some of the bits just seem to be added for length but overall this is a pleasant, sometimes vulgar road trippin' movie with some terrific stunt driving.",1354406400,,1716,4.910344827586207
5323755,5,B009EU6F1U,"Billed as an action film - and it certainly has that element - it's at its core a touchy-feely romance comedy, with a very sweet, pro-human attitude. If you can, watch the first two minutes; if you like them, you'll like the movie as a whole. I'm in line for whatever Dax Shepard writes next.",1352592000,26,292,4.327272727272727
5323756,2,B009EU6F1U,"This movie wasn't what I expected. The first half of the movie is flat-out boring. Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell's love story felt awkward. Their lovey dovy dialog felt forced and was annoying. It wasn't until Bradley Cooper's character showed up that the movie became a little interesting. Yul Perkins is in witness protection because of this past. He has a new life and a new name; Charlie. He has a girlfriend named Annie that loves him, but she is offered a job in L.A. Charlie decides to take Annie to L.A., but they are soon stalked by Annie's ex boyfriend, Gil. Gil contacts Charlie's friend, Alex, who is wanting revenge and money that Charlie stole. I wouldn't recommend HIT & RUN!!!",1351900800,3,691,4.672131147540983
5323757,4,B009EU6F1U,"Charles (Dax Shepard), not his real name, is in the Witness Protection Program (WPP) in the sleepy little town of Milton. Randy (Tom Arnold) who is a fallen from grace, inept federal marshal is assigned to watch over him. Annie (Kristen Bell) is Charles' girlfriend. She knows he is in the Program, but not the details. Gil (Michael Rosenbaum) is Annie's ex-bf who is still in love with her.

When Annie gets offered a job in LA, Charles insists she go take it, and he opts to drive her himself in his 700 HP ""suicide doors"" Lincoln. They are chased by Gil, Randy, Gil's brother Terry (Jess Rowland) who is a gay policeman, and bad guy Alex (Bradley Cooper), the reason why Charles is in the WPP to begin with.

The film turns into ""Smokey and the Bandit"" with gun fire. The unorthodox relationship of the two stars is the heart of the film. Annie is an expert in solving non-violent conflict solutions and Charles is...well let's say he is trying.

The second half of the film digresses. I won't say it falls off a cliff, but it could have been done better in this romantic action/comedy.

Parental Guide: F-bombs, some really ugly nudity, male nudity.",1348876800,3,1153,4.58252427184466
5323758,5,B009EU6F1U,"Charlie is in a Witness Protection program, after he ratted out his gang members, who are all bank-robbers. His location is in California as he tries to keep a low profile. But then, he meets Annie, who is a professor and on the verge of losing her job. Charlie falls in love with Annie, and he follows her to L.A., where she seeks a new job. The drama begins as Charlie steps out of his Protective boundary,and all hell breaks loose as the chase begins. A former friend, also a marshal, and a member of his bank-robber gang go after Charlie at full-speed. Most of the scenes are very funny, and some laugh-out-loud entertainment, combined with romance. Superb acting performance, and just enough action. A great summer movie to enjoy. Highly recommended to all comedy lovers!",1346198400,4,776,4.713235294117647
5323759,4,B009EU6F1U,"Have you ever watched a movie in which all the characters sounded a little too erudite? Everyone in this goofy thing sounds as though he or she is a college-educated sociologist with a bit of new-age jargon thrown in. It was nice to hear, but I had to wonder if that was the intention of screenwriter Dax Shepard (""Brother's Justice"") or if he lacks the skill to write more varied and authentic dialogue.

This is a high-octane road race between a wide variety of muscle cars, custom-built race cars and one sturdy SUV, all because a former getaway driver (for bank robbers) who is in the Witness Protection Program, has promised to drive his sweetheart to a job interview 600 miles away, and nothing, not her ex-boyfriend, not his former gang members, not his dad, not a U.S. Marshall, nor his girlfriend's change of heart, can stop him.

We see:
  * Kristen Bell (""Big Miracle"") specializes in conflict resolution. She has a great job opportunity IF she can get to her Los Angeles interview in time. She thinks her boyfriend witnessed a crime.
  * Dax Shepard (""When in Rome"") admitted to his girlfriend he was in the Witness Protection Program, but he failed to mention that he was an accomplice in those crimes.
  * Bradley Cooper (""Limitless"") spent some painful time in jail because our hero ratted him out. Now he's mad! (But he loves dogs and doesn't want to see them fed inferior dog food.)
  * Joy Bryant (""Welcome Home, Roscoe Jenkins""), our hero's former girlfriend, is part of that bank-robbing gang, AND she's a pretty fair shot!
  * Beau Bridges (""The Descendants"") is our hero's father. The two of them used to race custom-built cars.
  * Tom Arnold (""Madea's Witness Protection"") is the U.S. Marshall determined to protect his witness. This character could give the U.S. Marshall Service a bad name!
  * John Duff (""The Game Plan"") is the body builder in the clichd tank top who buys cheap dog food for his pit bull.

In this R-rated comedy, expect constant profanity, some nudity, no blowie uppie stuff, a few gunshots and a LOT of vehicular mayhem. Expect a couple of surprise cameos at the end...and watch your Amazon.com DVD all the way through the credits.",1346198400,2,2178,4.71957671957672
