8166134,4,B000M32W6A,"Good instructional video. The demonstration was clear most of the time.  However, some moves that required close up of hands and wrist were filmed from far away and therefore left to the imagination of the viewer.

As far as the content, it would give it 3.5 to 4 stars.  There are some very doable techniques that can be very practical.  Yet there are some that's more unrealistic, requiring several steps to counter a very slow punch from the aggressor.  In reality, these latter moves just won't work because no one punches that slowly and then wait for you to take your time to counter.

I learned quite a few things.  It is most definitely worth watching, as long as you realize not all techniques are usable in a real fight.",1406678400,,730,4.569230769230769
