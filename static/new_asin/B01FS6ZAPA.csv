All the shows are very clear, packaging was very nice, as was the covers. Happy customer!!",1473379200,,261,3.943396226415094

8761451,1,B01FS6ZAPA,Fun fact this is a illegal Malaysia DVD. Got a show called Zero No Tsukaima from the same place. Horrible quality and screams bootleg. Only buy if you want to make fun of it:),1467849600,4,175,4.176470588235294
