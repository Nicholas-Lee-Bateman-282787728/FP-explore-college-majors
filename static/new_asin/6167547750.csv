The Silenced is a gorgeous film. The actors are lovely and really good at their jobs; the setting (a boarding school in the mountains above Seoul) is crazy creepy. And the story is... a little hard to follow. Maybe it's me. Maybe there are a couple of subtitles missing. As with nearly all k-horror, I did have a pretty good idea of what I had just watched when I got to the end. But the middle was a little confusing for me. Still, the mood was well-established, and I really want to watch this again.",1478304000,2,597,4.378378378378378
