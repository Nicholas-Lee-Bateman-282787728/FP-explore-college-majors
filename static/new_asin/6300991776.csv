7811337,1,6300991776,"Twenty-two year Randy Douglas (Christopher Parker) travels from New Hampshire to Hollywood to attain cinema stardom, and is met in the film capital by an old New England friend, David, who promptly introduces the artless youth to local night life, with which Randy seems only too eager to participate, although quickly becoming aware that fame as a movie star will be very difficult to achieve. This is, of course, a general theme utilized in countless motion pictures, but this production does not begin to satisfy fundamental requirements of continuity, instead developing into an exploitation affair, with virtually all shooting being done on and about Hollywood Boulevard as Randy is exposed to caricatures of Hollywood's common types, all depicted with jaundice in a work that lacks character development and motivation. The point that is apparently to be made is one offering irony, but the film is poorly scripted and directed with a result that insufficient sympathy or even interest is warranted for any of the characters, whose behaviour lack rationale and at times is ridiculous, as during a scene wherein police personnel engaged by a barricaded suspect situation allow untrained civilians to become directly involved. Scoring is provided in cookie cutter fashion by Tangerine Dream and the acting is, taken all in all, uninspired, although Tom Badal creates his part well as a narcotics dealer with whom Randy unwillingly becomes entangled; good work, also, is apparent from many of the crew in spite of a skimpy budget, but overmuch emphasis upon sleaze clearly lowers the worth of the picture.",1109635200,2,1608,5.236434108527132
