5622928,1,B00BINMAJ2,I ordered this movie based on the cover. I thought it would be a comedy for kids. Big mistake. It was slow and boring.,1437523200,,118,3.9583333333333335
5622929,5,B00BINMAJ2,"It was exceptional when I chose this DVD to give to friends who had similar issues with a young boy, who lost his Father.  There are several types of losses.  The most difficult is for an 11 year-old boy to have divorced parents, the Father granted custody, and then have to be sent back to live with his Mother who has remarried; he is in a Step-Family with a Step-Father.  Then, the reality hits that as a boy he will not live with his Father again, if ever.  Yes, this movie production, Redwood is fiction.  However, it provides true-to-life examples of how an 11 year-old grapples with real crisis by drifting into a world of make-believe - his own Narnia.  Nevertheless, with his make-believe victory in a Golf Classic Championship, this
boy returned to reality and acceptance within his Step-family, Step-Brother and rediscovers love in a Mother-and-Son relationship.  I was complimented for this DVD as a gift, because it helped Adults and the Young, to grasp that evil is irrational and life is not fair.  To move on to a better day does not require fault-finding, but just moving on with those who support recovery.  At the end of the movie, the Producer provided an excellent simile when the 11 year-old boy cut off his extraordinary long hair and took on a new appearance to show everyone he was moving on
and appreciated their acceptance.  This movie is a masterpiece in human relationships and an excellent gift for those in the struggles of life.",1430697600,5,1460,4.71259842519685
5622930,5,B00BINMAJ2,Great imaginitive story. Nice way for a boy to work out his internal struggles. Feel good movie,1405123200,,95,4.647058823529412
5622931,5,B00BINMAJ2,"A lovely illustration of a child's fantasy (golf) helping him deal with painful family issues.  His mother walked away (literally) from the family and his father was unable to cope with this loss or with his strong-willed son.  The boy is sent off to live with a related family whose man of the house is over-controlling and not exactly welcoming or affectionate.  The lad is now the youngest of three boys, a stressful situation for him to say the least.  His on-going golf fantasy is a crutch that keeps him on his feet, so to speak, until he gathers the strength to take his rightful place in his new family.",1397692800,2,611,4.527272727272727
5622932,5,B00BINMAJ2,"A WONDERFUL FILM FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY. A PRECOCIOUS 11-YEAR OLD WITH AN OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION HAS HIS LIFE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN WHEN HE IS FORCED TO LEAVE HIS HIPPY FATHER AND MOVE IN WITH HIS STRAIGHR LACED MOTHER. NOW HE MUST FIQURE OUT HOW TO FIT IN WITH HIS COLORFUL NEW FAMILY, ALL WHILE BEATING JACK NICKLAUS AT THE 1975 CHAMPIONSHIP.",1374969600,,340,4.590163934426229
5622933,5,B00BINMAJ2,"I enjoyed this film from the standpoint of watching a young boy face adversity and his parents splitting up, yet using a VERY active imagination to work past many of his troubles and adversaries. I would recommend ""Becoming Redwood"" for teens and older. It was a little different that what I had expected, but it IS a great flick!",1368489600,3,330,4.610169491525424
5622934,3,B00BINMAJ2,Very slow movie,1467676800,,15,4.333333333333333
5622935,2,B00BINMAJ2,"It was ok, a lot of slow parts.",1466726400,,31,3.0
5622936,1,B00BINMAJ2,Very odd movie.,1466467200,,15,4.333333333333333
5622937,1,B00BINMAJ2,Wasn't that good,1466208000,,16,4.666666666666667
5622938,3,B00BINMAJ2,"As the title says this movie is amazing but doesn't have enough stories to excite you. The transitions are very weak which could've been handled well with a bit more storytelling. The movie also fails to deliver a satisfying closure and just ends it with ""riding into the sunshine"" which was weak given the plot.  Even after that I think it deserves more than 3 stars but not 4. I did have to skip over some parts because they were plain boring and nothing was happening.
Spoiler ahead:
So many storylines could've been expanded.
The dad: What the hell was even with him? We see him crossing border which is later found in the movie that he was running from a crime. He is then beaten up and later is in prison. He has cut his hair too and I have no idea why or what.
The  step-dad: He was emotionless but somehow he becomes a good fella in the end. Something happened but it's not expanded upon.
The mom: The son meets with mom later and I expected the movie to go over how the mom is where she is but nada.
The grandpa relationship: Bit weird he just talks with redwood even at the end and suddenly he goes outside without anything developing

The bottomline: The movie had endless potentials. If only the editor had a clue.",1465862400,,1226,4.344978165938865
5622939,4,B00BINMAJ2,Good lesson.,1465257600,,12,5.5
5622940,4,B00BINMAJ2,Enjoyed the movie. Wasn't even distracted by the buttered popcorn and milkduds.,1464998400,,79,5.666666666666667

8569053,1,B00BINMAJ2,I spouse anyone can be a hairstylist in Hollywood.maybe a joke not sure. Hard to watch movie because of the fake hair on everyone.,1526688000,,130,4.458333333333333
8569054,3,B00BINMAJ2,good entertainment,1523318400,,18,8.5

8569056,1,B00BINMAJ2,"It looked and sounded like a nice movie, but I quit watching after 31 minutes. I couldn't stand watching the abusive step-father. The movie is rife with unlikable characters - a drug addict father, a mother who abandoned her son, and the bullying step-father. There isn't much plot, transitions are weak, and, as someone else said, it needed more storytelling to fill in the shading. Redwood and his imagination were the good part. It moved very slowly, which was another reason to quit before I wasted anymore time on it.",1480204800,,522,4.811111111111111
8569057,5,B00BINMAJ2,It's a pretty good movie about adjusting when life throws you lemons.  Good acting and many analogies about life. It is not a golf movie but focuses on adjusting as a kid to a new environment and making it work!,1478044800,,211,4.275
8569058,3,B00BINMAJ2,This was kind of a bland movie...,1470700800,,33,3.857142857142857
8569059,3,B00BINMAJ2,"I would probably have liked this movie better if the music had not been so loud during the times that someone was talking. I had to keep running the movie back to try and decipher what was being said. I was especially frustrated at the end when the little boy said something about ""they hardly ever talked any more""--I never did figure out who he was talking about because no matter how many times I ran the movie back, I could not hear who he was talking about. Very frustrating. If someone knows the answer to this, please post it to me in a comment--I would really like to know!

This movie was OK, but not great. I realized that at the beginning of the movie it was about the days of ""the flower child"" and free love, but still I was horrified later in the movie when the biological dad raised his child in a world of drugs. I could not really sympathize with the dad when he got busted, but I did feel sorry for the little boy. The life he was raised in was the only life that he knew. I guess that is one of the reasons he had to live in a world of fantasy, where he played Jack Nickles in the Master's Tournament--he needed something to give his life some meaning.

I won't say anything else about the movie because then I would have told you the whole story & why would you want to watch it if you knew everything that was going to happen?",1469664000,,1347,4.137404580152672
8569060,5,B00BINMAJ2,LOVED the ending!!!,1468800000,,19,5.666666666666667
8569061,2,B00BINMAJ2,It's ok.  I didn't  watch it to the end  I went to bed.  I don't plan on watching rest of the movie.  Let me know how it ends.,1468540800,,126,3.357142857142857
8569062,3,B00BINMAJ2,Very strange movie. I wouldn't recommend watching. Waste of time.,1467849600,,65,5.6
