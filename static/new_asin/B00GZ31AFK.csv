6125038,4,B00GZ31AFK,"Tom nails it with his story. He made the right decision at every turn - that's the triumph of this film, it shows the joy, the angst and ultimately the peace of a good choice. It's the first bike show my wife loved! The only reason I gave it four and not five stars was the quality of Tom's shooting - he was a total beginner, but that makes this project all the more remarkable. A story of one guy finding his way through the early day's of his life journey.",1388361600,4,459,4.054945054945055
6125039,5,B00GZ31AFK,"This is a wonderful film, full of life and thoroughly enjoyable. There's lots of interesting, rarely captured scenery from exotic locations. This story delivers on so many levels. It makes you want to have an epic adventure of your own. Highly recommended.",1386460800,3,256,5.119047619047619
6125040,5,B00GZ31AFK,Watch this movie. So inspiring.,1425340800,,31,5.4
6125041,3,B00GZ31AFK,"GREAT visuals......but wow, hour and a half of this guy complaining.....whew, it got tiresome. I thought I was gonna watch a movie about a guy adventuring on bike, and the experiences he has....not so much....its more about his internal complaints over and over, very little bike energy ironically.  coulda been epic......instead its alright........",1420675200,,349,5.584905660377358

6125043,5,B00GZ31AFK,"This video is partly the reason I am sat writing this from a tent, in the middle of Africa.

Enough said really, it's worth the few Bob and I'd be surprised if anyone didn't find it hugely inspiring.",1400284800,,199,4.2368421052631575
6125044,1,B00GZ31AFK,"Maybe it was overly edited; I don't know, but it was confusing (it wasn't clear how many times he had returned to Iran and for how long) and it was such a series of really stupid things to do: take a major road trip on a bike with basically no plan, no maps, bad gear that it was impossible to have any sympathy with the filmmaker and what he was apparently trying to do. THe departure of his companions was poorly explained and then didn't jive with the later explanation. And biking with a Muslin woman into Iran:  what were they thinking would happen when they got there?  Naievete. He and his now wife have what looks like a pretty dysfunctional relationship but, hey, if it works for them....",1397865600,,697,4.395348837209302
6125045,4,B00GZ31AFK,I found it to be a great movie about a persons cycling adventure not going the way he planned what so ever.,1395964800,,107,3.909090909090909
6125046,5,B00GZ31AFK,This is the type of adventure everyone needs to experience! Its a great story with wonderful filming :) The ending was just perfect.,1395100800,,132,4.782608695652174
6125047,5,B00GZ31AFK,"I loved this movie. If you have ever sat too long on a bicycle seat, even if only for a day, you should understand a little of what this guy went through. Add to this girl friend problems and you have the making of an epic journey. One small takeaway: with the current pervasiveness of English worldwide, a guy can find a girl friend almost anywhere.",1393804800,2,350,4.318181818181818
6125048,2,B00GZ31AFK,"What a pity. So much promise, incredible countries visited, yet this was at times an uncomfortably solipsistic, disjointed collection of footage with a confusing narrative and a narrator who didn't give much as much attention to the locals he met as he perhaps should have. Fantastic footage though.",1391731200,,299,5.25
6125049,5,B00GZ31AFK,"Janapar is both an adventure story and a love story.  You don't need to be a cyclist to enjoy it.
Tom sets off on a bicycle to cycle round the world!  He is a naive young man full of questions about the meaning of life.  In this amazing film his journey shows the physical hardships, mental torment and emotional traumas that he goes through.  The dedication to capturing the experience on film is commendable and the editing brings to life a wonderful story.  The sound track is superb adding much to the finished product.  A must see film.  Buy it now.",1391385600,3,554,4.425742574257426
8628839,5,B00GZ31AFK,"Absolutely brilliant.  Beautiful story line, wonderful heart warming unscripted emotional dialogue.  Incredible footage and even better editing.  I spent 14 months bike packing through some of the most remote corners of the globe and he's right: ""Do this trip.  You'll never be the same again.""",1528588800,,294,5.466666666666667
8628840,4,B00GZ31AFK,"One has to marvel at the challenges of cycling with that much stuff over dirt, gravel and whatever.  The plot could have been expanded, but otherwise it was an enjoyable movie.",1481846400,,176,4.67741935483871
8628841,2,B00GZ31AFK,"True story, except the description of the movie. Happy he found a wonderful person to be his life partner. But, essentially MANY have taken the long global bike ride described. The difference: this Brit is enterprising and has parlayed it into a franchise, Tom's Bike Ride. Throw in a little romance, though unscripted, is what sells this ""documentary"". Pleasant music but a poorly told story and poor continuity. What pulled me in? The romance angle and it is very sweet to see the wonderful women he made a connection with. But, if you want stories about years long biking journeys check out YouTube vids on bicycle touring, warm showers and the many journals and blogs available.",1478390400,,682,4.887931034482759
8628842,5,B00GZ31AFK,"A terrific documentary that proves great films don't need a big budget or fancy cameras. This is a really great accompaniment to the book, which I'd recommend reading first, but doing it the other way around could be just as enjoyable. The film does leave out large chunks of the story (particularly the first few months of Tom's trip), and there's a lot of great exposition and narrative that just wouldn't work in the form of a film, but shouldn't be missed in reading the book. Either way, a wonderful film and a great story. For what it's worth, I've gone on several extended bike trips (with more to come), but this isn't a film just for die-hard cycle tourists.",1473206400,,667,4.566666666666666
8628843,5,B00GZ31AFK,"This film has been on my list for a very long time to watch.  Today was the day.  I am glad I did.

Janapar is a wonderful amalgam.  It displays focus yet flexibility.  Focus yet compromise.  The pedestrian and the exotic.

Follow Tom as he bikes across the world, discovers himself and love.

A complete journey of life in one film",1449273600,,332,4.327868852459017

8628846,4,B00GZ31AFK,If you are a cyclist or someone who loves adventure this is a must see. Great editing work done as I was not bored at all during the viewing. I was inspired by the rawness of how he struggled between love and goal mindset of traveling the world on two wheels.,1439164800,,259,4.098039215686274
