8112564,4,B000EPPC9A,"I gave this 4 stars because of the deficiencies in We Were Soldiers Once and Young. I've read the book twice and it was written by the Journalist and the Commander of the Battle of the Ia Drang. The movie is sanitized and it leaves out the subsequent cover-up and it did not get casualty figures correct. Every soldier in that early battle was a casualty, 308 Americans died, 500 injured. They expected a rag-tag band of guerrillas and found 3,000 battle hardened soldiers of the North Vietnamese Army instead. If you want the full story, read the book based on the same name. A Bright Shing Lie is based on Neil Sheehan's book of the same name, and it is honest and looks at the Vietnam war through the life of a very important peson, John Paul Vann, possibly the only hero of the war. The deficiency is that Vann's time in Vietnam couldn't really be given the justice it deserves in a movie. The movie may entice you to read the book, then you will understand the war. The movie's great and the book is better.",1504483200,,1012,4.388297872340425
