3983478,4,B002T04NDE,"Season 1 of The Best Defense Show proved to be a very good and usefull addition to my library. This vendor delivered before required date, in very secure packaging, and the price was right.",1323648000,2,189,4.588235294117647
3983479,5,B002T04NDE,"If you are a gun owner and are concerned about actually using your firearm to protect yourself and others, this is for you.  Rob Pincus, Mike Janich and Michael Bane present information that is practical for the new gun-owner or someone who has been through many different tactical training courses.  The scenario way this skills are presented are nicely done and allow the viewer to think their way through the problem.  More importantly, if you don't have the money to spend hundreds of dollars on a course, the basic skills taught in this program are enough to help you when its needed.  I highly recommend this series.",1293494400,8,622,4.785046728971962

8379767,3,B002T04NDE,I am a big fan of the Best Defense series. The DVD is made once you order it with an apparent lack of quality control. Mine came with two identical episodes on the same disk minus the episode that should have been there even though the title of the missing episode is on the disk.,1474416000,,280,4.109090909090909
8379768,5,B002T04NDE,"This series offers reenactments of real life threatening situations with better and best case scenarios. Highlighting case histories, it shows how to safely use your gun when your life is threatened, but more importantly how to avoid the need to use it. If you don't own a gun, you may not be interested in this series.  However, watching a few episodes presenting how to avoid danger or shoot outs could be well worth your time if you and your family are ever confronted with a dangerous situation in the future.",1431216000,,513,4.7

8379771,4,B002T04NDE,"As a proponent of self defense this dvd offers realistic scenarios to think about as well as ideas for training to better handle those situations should they happen.

Wish Amazon carried ther full series of DVDs.",1392854400,2,212,4.888888888888889
8379772,4,B002T04NDE,"I enjoyed this first season of Best Defense.  I found the section on avoiding conflict especially helpful.  How hard it is to back down and deescalate when you truly believe you are in the right.  Being right is not worth my life or the life of another.

I would have liked more on the mechanics of shooting, especially grip.  Some sections seemed cut off.  There is one on a woman drawing from a purse but it is done in one take and nothing is shown about the purse or how she draws.  In another, an excellent shooter comes to the end of a magazine and reloads and fires an accurate shot in a split second.  Rob Pincus promises ""we'll get to that"" but it never happened.

Some of the information on a safe room showed a layout that few of us would have in our home.  And the interior door that they recommend would probably cost 2 grand once you get it cut to size, add 2 dead bolt locks, heavy duty strike plates and heavy duty hinges.

Overall a lot of great ideas about awareness, prevention and mindset.",1365897600,5,1008,4.28042328042328
8379773,5,B002T04NDE,"Best self defence DVD on Amazon for a wide range audience(wife,mom,first time gun owner....Pro shooters) The topics on this DVD are reviewed over and over agian. They will drill the point into your head so you will never forget.",1360972800,,228,4.871794871794871
8379774,5,B002T04NDE,"I really enjoy this show, but after buying this one, I can not find the other seasons. I would buy them all if available. Good common sense information for the prepardness minded person.",1354752000,3,186,4.666666666666667
