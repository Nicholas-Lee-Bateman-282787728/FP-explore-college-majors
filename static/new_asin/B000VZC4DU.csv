8220594,5,B000VZC4DU,"Drinking With Ian is a fun, anarchic, absurd variety talk-show mostly set in the cave-like 7th st. entry rock club in downtown Minneapolis.  Ian Rans himself is a rather likeable character who appears quite dapper compared to his surroundings.  yes, there is alot of drunken baffoonery.  But it is not the uneducated frat-boy type of drunken baffoonery.  More like the typical Minneapolis-indie-cynical-philosophy major-dropout-now working at a book store/bike shop type of drunken baffoonery.  People from Minneapolis will know what and who i'm talking about.

at any rate it's good fun.  and if you been to any of the first season's tapings, you may get to see yourself in the audience laughing, or yelling sarcastic comments at Ian.",1199836800,7,735,5.230769230769231
