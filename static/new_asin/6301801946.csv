369798,5,6301801946,"It may not be the best western, but there is something about the flavor of it.  It seems like you're really seeing a scene out in the old west.  I love the rough exterior and interior shots; everything covered in a thin veneer of dust and that includes the people.  Ty Power is always ""in the now"" in his pictures.  He's so believable in all his scenes.  Susan Hayward is again chewing up the set with her strong, angry woman act... and it works!  This is a get the folks together and pop some popcorn style movie; a movie made before westerns became bogged down in psychological morass.  Buy it just for fun!",1353283200,,609,4.336283185840708
369799,4,6301801946,"1951's RAWHIDE, directed by Henry Hathaway is a solid entry in the Western genre strong on character motivations and building suspense as outlaws hold citizens captive in a stagecoach station. What could have been a very claustrophobic film, which would have been in direct contrast to the Western genre, if not for Hathaway's approach to filming this tense script. He actually uses the claustrophobic  elements of the story for a powerful dramatic effect.

It has an exceptional cast including Tyrone Power, Susan Hayward, Dean Jagger, Jack Elam, Edgar Buchanan, Hugh Marlowe, Kenneth Tobey and George Tobias. Thomas Little and Stuart A. Reiss designed the primary sets with art designs by Lyle Wheeler and George W. Davis and great camera work by cinematographer Milton Krasner all essential to the central story. Composers Sol Kaplan and Lionel Newman turned in an interesting score.",1336953600,,886,5.276595744680851

369801,3,6301801946,"Rawhide, 1951 film

This story is set in the Southwest during the late 19th century when stagecoaches carried passengers and the mail across the desert. There is a station where each stagecoach gets fresh horses and the passengers get ten minutes to wolf down their food. But this stations was captured by four dangerous escaped prisoners. They will wait for the shipment of gold so they can rob it and escape across the state line. The characters of the people at that station, and the escaped prisoners, are shown by their conversation and actions. A stagecoach stops for food, their passengers suspect nothing. One man says the leader of the escaped prisoners looks familiar, but this is explained away. The gold shipment will pass through the next day.

Can the imprisoned couple dig their way to freedom? The woman's daughter is a complication. The drama builds tension from the time schedule. [""High Noon"".] Zimmerman, the leader of the prisoners advises Tom Owens ""never trust any man"". What will happen if two-year old Kelly climbs out from that hole in the wall? Will it create a crisis? There is added drama from the conflicts among the villains. Does Zimmerman follow his own advice, or turn his back on an ornery critter? The shooting begins, and this warns the oncoming stagecoach. The woman knows how to use a rifle. [You won't see this in modern films.] In the end the good guys survive, the villains do not.

The plot of this movie reminded me of ""The Petrified Forest"", but its different. Would a remote stagecoach station really be built in such a substantial manner? The best and classic westerns were made in the 1930s and early 1940s. Later films were concerned with interpersonal relationships rather than the real concerns of the late 19th century. You'll notice a smaller cast of characters as well. Was this due to political changes, or a declining audience for the movie theaters? Once they figured out how to lay railroad tracks across shifting sands the horse-drawn stagecoaches were no longer functional.",1302134400,2,2033,4.90406976744186

369803,5,6301801946,"Rawhide deserves not only a DVD release, but recognition as one of the greatest Westerns ever. Taut, masterful direction by the great Henry Hathaway, and excellent perfomances by everyone makes this a must have film for anyone who loves the Western genre.

Tyrone Power and Susan Hayward are trapped at a stage way station by a gang of desperate criminals. Surprises and tragedy unfold as Power, Hayward, and Hayward's baby try to survive and outwit the criminals.

There are scenes in this film that are so tense that even today's hardened, jaded moviegoers will appreciate. This was not a film with larger than life heroes or cardboard cutout villains, but real people well portrayed with great lines from a magnificent script.

This movie should be released on DVD immediately.",1144195200,14,780,5.0310077519379846
369804,5,6301801946,"A little-known western, and even under-rated by those who DO know it, ""Rawhide"" is a nail-biter from start to finish, an ultra-taut suspense film that really only happens to take place in the wild west but could take place anywhere, anytime. Literally in the middle of nowhere, an outpost for east- or westbound stagecoaches to stop and let passengers stretch and have a bite to eat becomes the scene of a life-or-death struggle between four desperate prison escapees and two strangers, one of them with a baby to look after.
Tyrone Power is an employee of the outpost, learning the ropes from old-timer Edgar Buchanan. A stagecoach comes through and two of the passengers, a young woman (Susan Hayward) and a toddler, are forced to stay because four men have escaped from a nearby prison and the stagecoach line isn't allowed to risk the lives of females or children on the road. Unfortunately their lives are at much greater risk here, as the convicts promptly ride up and seize the outpost, intending to hijack a shipment of gold coming through the next day. Buchanan is murdered outright by the gang's resident psychotic (played with fantastic gusto by perennial bad guy Jack Elam), leaving Power and Hayward to try and figure out a way to escape before the hammer falls on them, too. Hugh Marlowe, fresh from his brilliant turn as a playwright in ""All About Eve"", plays the leader of the outlaws with an intelligent menace, trying to hold his gang together while plotting the next move. During all this, the hostages naturally find time to fall in love. Susan Hayward has never been more beautiful than she is here, so it's not hard to see why.
A great little western, hard to find but well worth the search, with excellent performances all around, from one of the masters of trim-the-fat suspense yarns, Henry Hathaway.",1079481600,30,1825,4.796825396825397

Henry Hathaway directed  what may have been considered a standard Western at the time, but the film has since gained status as a cult favorite.  The best description of this thriller was what one author wrote - ""If Alfred Hitchcock had directed a Western, this would've been it.""  The black-and-white cinematography is gorgeous and I can't wait to see how it's transferred on Blu-ray.

369863,4,6301801946,"This movie has an absorbing plot, is crisply directed and features an outstanding cast. It is well worth the attention of any Western fan.

Director Hathaway keeps the tension building and creates several gripping plot turns that put the lives of the heroes in doubt if the outlaw gang find out what they're trying to do to get free. He and the cinematographer create a world of dust, set against a majestic mountain backdrop while making the interior action edgy and teetering close to violence.

The cast is exceptional, with Hayward stealing all her scenes from the other actors, although Power and Marlowe are good in their parts. Elam is deliciously over the top as a leering crazy and the performances of Jagger and Buchanan add nicely to the way the story is delivered.

The dry as dust last two lines of dialogue beautifully round off a well made, classy film.",1358208000,2,868,4.735099337748345

7815969,3,6301801946,"Not bad.  Least not terrible anyway.  But there's a much better similarly themed film I'd recommend with Randolpf Scott, titled ""The Tall T"", directed by Bud Boetticher based on a book by Elmore Leonard when he was predominantly writing Westerns and not making a lot of money at it. ""Hombre"" starring Paul Newman, with Richard Boone as the heavy was another Leonard creation with both films sharing strong similarities. I'd argue that if this film had used Boone in that capacity (Marlowe, albeit a good actor, comes off as too much of a twentieth century guy, so thus anachronistic here, and much of the reason the film suffers I think) where a guy like Boone in the roll would have pulled it off as a far more interesting bad guy.",1494979200,,732,4.623076923076923

7815977,2,6301801946,"Rawhide is a 1951 western

Tyrone Power (1914-58) was 20th Century Foxs challenge to MGMs Errol Flynn. He was doing bit parts when director Henry King cast him in
Lloyds of London (1936) which launched his career. From 1936 to 42 he cranked out a few films every year, some of them notable  Suez (1938), Jesse James (1939), The Mark of Zorro (1940), Blood and Sand (1941). He was never nominated for an Oscar, although his performance in Witness for the Prosecution (1957) certainly deserved one. Power once said  The secret of charm is bulls*** and his film roles were filmed with charm, but not so much here. Power, like Flynn, just didn't look good with a six gun strapped to his waist.

Beautiful Susan Hayward (1917-75) plays a head strong woman, a role she did well and often. She was nominated for an Oscar 5 times winning in 1959 for I Want to Live although personally I preferred Ill Cry Tomorrow (1956) and With a Song in my Heart (1953). There is no chemistry between Haywood and Power, but when you've got Hayward, who needs the chemistry?

Hugh Marlowe (1911-82) plays the bad guy, a role he rarely played in dozens of films like Twelve OClock High (1949), All About Eve (1950), or my favorite The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). Marlow is not convincing, and its good that he stayed with playing more noble characters.

Crazy eyed Jack Elam (1920-2003) plays a killer. Elam is best known for his villainous roles in westerns like Vera Cruz (1954), Wichita (1955), The Man From Laramie (1955), and Gunfight at OK Corral (1957). I enjoyed him best as Alamosa Bill in Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973). Later in life he turned to comedy and gave many memorable performances in films like The Apple Dumpling Gang (1979) and Cannonball Run (1981) and on TV. He described his career this way -""Who's Jack Elam? Get me Jack Elam! Get me a Jack Elam type. Get me a young Jack Elam. Who's Jack Elam?"" In this film you see Jack before he lost his eye. Hes just as crazy!

The film was directed by Henry Hathaway (1898-1985), a director who specialized in westerns from his earliest films - ""Heritage of the Desert"" (1932), ""Wild Horse Mesa"" (1932) - to his later films - ""Shootout"" (1971), ""5 Card Stud"" (1968), yet curiously enough his only nomination for an Oscar was for ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935), and his best known films are non-Westerns (e.g., ""Of Human Bondage"", ""Call Northside 777"", ""The Desert Fox""). He once said ""To be a good director you've got to be a bastard. I'm a bastard and I know it."" This is one of Hathaways weaker efforts. My favorite Hathaway western is The Sons of Katie Elder (1965).

1951 was a good year for films. The top grossing films were Quo Vadis, Alice in Wonderland, Show Boat, A Streetcar Named Desire, and David and Bathsheba. Oscars went to The Quiet Man (Director), High Noon (Actor), Come Back Little Sheba (Actress), The Greatest Show on Earth (Picture), and Viva Zapata (Supporting Actor).  Other notable releases that year included The African Queen,  The Day the Earth Stood Still, Murder Inc, and A Place in the Sun.

Given how many great westerns there are from this time period, don't waste your time with this one.",1465603200,2,3180,4.610619469026549
