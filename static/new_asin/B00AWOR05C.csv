5524494,5,B00AWOR05C,"A lovely film about the many ways the world has been ruined for animals and people by conservative right-wingers, republicons and others who are out for themselves and have no consideration for others, especially the animals of the world! I can recommend ""Delhi Safari"" for everyone who is concerned about the welfare of the planet and the good things which inhabit it!",1366848000,5,369,4.967741935483871
5524495,1,B00AWOR05C,"If you are a conservative, I would not waste your money on this movie. I was very disappointed that they protraied the conservative party in such a way.  I wish it could have been just a fun film for my daughter, but it was a complete agenda of the Liberal Left Wing of the goverment. It even included a famous quote from Charlton Heston.",1366761600,7,338,4.28125
5524526,1,B00AWOR05C,"I am blown away at the sheer stupidity and lack of production value in this movie.  Where can I start?  The Music - As soon as I heard the first song I knew it was all downhill from there.  Cobbled together pieces in a blatant failed attempt to create a disney-like theatrical musical performance.  Fail.  Next - the animation.  Guys, seriously.  How about having the character's mouths actually move with their voices.  I mean - how freaking lazy were your animators?  Watching this damn parrot speak as I write this and I think that this must have been produced with a trial version of whatever animation software they used to produce this less than stellar piece.  Did you have to reinstall it every 30 days to finish the movie?  When I rented this at redbox, the DVD was originally filthy - and required a thorough cleaning prior to even playing in my DVD player - and I now understand why!  Someone must have used this DVD as a coaster, which is about all that it is worth.",1382140800,5,978,4.463276836158192
5524527,5,B00AWOR05C,I haven't watched this movie but my grandson loves it because is a baby with mother animal. My daughter in law requested it and they are happy with it.  Price was good too.,1379548800,,172,4.212121212121212
5524528,3,B00AWOR05C,wasn't as good as I thought it would be. was a little slow moving. lost interest a few times with the movie,1377907200,,107,3.909090909090909
5524529,2,B00AWOR05C,well not what I was excepting.  again it was not very clear when I was ordering.  There were several Delhi Safari and it confused me...... I really wanted the English version.,1375142400,,175,4.612903225806452
5524530,5,B00AWOR05C,Intelligent story and great cast. Music was wonderful and well arranged. It's a change of pace from the usual animated movies.,1374364800,3,126,5.0476190476190474
5524531,4,B00AWOR05C,"My son Loves this movie and he is two and a half, I found it on Netflix, noticed all the actors doing the voices and love them so I put it on---I still haven't sat down and watched it entirely from beginning to end but I have played it many times and have seen most of it-IT is surprisingly violent-the Father gets shot-there are other guns involved one carried by a monkey-This movie tells the truth from the Animals perspective and the last few minutes says it all!  Give it a chance-it depicts real life-and like every Disney movie one of the parents is killed, Finding Nemo's Mother's death scene was pretty horrifying but the all survived it, no?  People need to relax and really think about exactly what message you want to send your kid.  I happen to like this message and hope my children feel the same way and NOT like Trump's kids out there killing elephants for the fun of it-that is Horrifying to me---I think this movie is great and it has fun songs throughout-good message-realistic way of telling it--maybe not for the really young ones but clearly they can handle it too...",1374019200,,1089,4.517766497461929
5524532,5,B00AWOR05C,"Chose this rating because it is graphically and musically interesting for all ages.  The message that people can work together to achieve a good relationship on this planet that we share is worth sharing with youngsters who will grow up with a better view of their fellow creatures.  If, as people believe, we are all God's creations, then we should treat each other as such.  Distressing that some will view this movie as an ""agenda"" -- how sad for them.  But how lucky for the rest of us that we can live together.",1372377600,,516,4.516129032258065
5524533,1,B00AWOR05C,"absolutely terrible, not for little kids. Do not waste your money or time.  very violent don't know what they were thinking.",1369958400,3,124,4.904761904761905
5524534,2,B00AWOR05C,"Big Hollywood voice actors? Check. Cute animals on front cover? Check.

You would think this looks like a cute kid friendly movie based on the blurb on the back cover and the artwork. Sadly this move is none of these things.

This is a Bollywood movie, so it's possible some things got lost in translation. What this movie has is a sad message of humanity killing off animals and their habitats. It also has a very violent monkey (not kid appropriate by any means). I do not mind movies with an enviomental message provided they are done in a way that doesn't involve characters resorting to name calling and threating to kill or hurt (the monkey tries many times to hurt or kill the equally annoying parrot,not to mention the killer hyenas and bees/wasps) other characters.

Yes an enviromental message is a good one, but this movie really did a horrible job at presenting it. This is most certaintly not for a young audience.",1369785600,3,927,4.640243902439025
5524535,1,B00AWOR05C,This movie is not for the little ones like you may think. It looks cute but is full of violence and bad taste. Kids pick up on words in the movie you really do not want them to use. Its not worth your time. Don't waste your money on this one.,1367539200,6,242,3.764705882352941
8558492,1,B00AWOR05C,DO NOT BUY THIS! NOT KID APPROPRIATE!,1463875200,,37,4.428571428571429
8558493,1,B00AWOR05C,This isn't a movie it is a political  rant about how people are destroying everything with Veggietales style songs and lessons in it.,1436659200,,133,4.782608695652174
8558494,1,B00AWOR05C,"Got this movie for my kids in the hopes it would simply be entertaining. It's often interesting for me to see how unrelenting certain points of view can be... and if that's what you're looking for, you won't be disappointed.
HUMANS BAD. The tipping point for me was when (spoiler alert) the animals found themselves in the middle of a Delhi roadway, causing a traffic jam/accident. Citizens immediately get out of their cars and start grabbing rocks to throw at the animals. Really?? If nothing else, this would be quite an indictment on the people of Delhi.
The bigger message being the very real issue of deforestation and removal of animal habitats. Yes - it is a problem, and it needs to be addressed -- but can there be tact? Yes.  See Rio 2 to see a little better method.
The animation sucks. The story is completely bias. The only saving grace is a few of the songs, which my kids got a kick out of.

Not recommended.",1434240000,,924,4.494047619047619
8558495,5,B00AWOR05C,Excellent movie!! Laugh out loud!,1433376000,,33,5.8
8558496,1,B00AWOR05C,This is absolute filth clothed as a children's movie. The name calling (stupid- which my children will repeat) made me raise an eyebrow. When a cartoon barely clothed woman appeared with panties visible through a skirt bent over is when I clicked if off. Beware parents! Not everything is suitable for children even if it appears that way.,1428019200,,339,4.862068965517241
8558497,1,B00AWOR05C,This is simply not a children's movie.,1427155200,,38,4.571428571428571

8558500,5,B00AWOR05C,"Looked for this movie in every store, and could not find it.
Grandson had seen it on Netflix at my house, and loved it,
but does not have Netflix at his house.
Amazon to the rescue... AGAIN.",1393545600,,190,4.162162162162162
8558501,1,B00AWOR05C,"This movie is absolutely horrifying.  Dead parents, gangster monkeys with hand guns threatening to shoot other characters left and right, bullies... you name it.  The story is awful as well.  I kept looking back to see who was in this movie because it's straight up weird production out of India, but alas there are several big stars in it, which fooled me into thinking it would be decent.  No one should watch this, let alone small children.",1391817600,5,443,4.714285714285714
