922710,1,6304748957,"OMG,after reading the other two reviews I just had to weigh in on this film. I saw this film last week and decided that it was probably not worth the time to review it. After reading braver souls than I, I now have the courage to put in my 1 star. My least favorite commandment among them all was ""Thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother.""A white woman and her husband give birth to twin black boys which grow up to learn that Arsenio Hall was their true father! Oh brother was that one stupid.

I,also, have got to say that this movie was by far the most nonsensical mumbo-jumbo that I have seen in a long time. What was the goal of this film? It left me stunned at how cheesy and low brow it was. I,too, agree that this film seemed to have no purpose. If there was one, then it was lost in translation. Unfortunately, I did pay $11 to see this. SHOW ME THE MONEY.",1186963200,8,868,4.105882352941176
922711,1,6304748957,"A group of us saw this at a Press screening last night. Reactions varied, but I can only speak for myself. YIKES...what a ridiculous waste of money,talent and time that someone spent to produce THE TEN.I wish I could tell you that it was funny,but I can't. I wish I could tell you that it was clever, but I can't do that either. I wish that I could tell you that actors such as Winona Ryder, Paul Rudd, Gretchen Mol did outstanding jobs at their craft....NOPE!
There  must be some inside joke that maybe the writers and producers were in on that I just didn't get!
The movie commences with a gigantic thud as Paul Rudd,who is the narrator of this mess,introduces each of the ten commandments,ten mini-skits that are designed to, I think, give us fresh and comical insight into each law. By the end of sketch one:THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME, I forced myself to stay in my seat despite several people vacating the theatre!.After #6,THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE,a lot of folks called it quits and left.(If any skit worked best, I thought, it was this one. The coveting takes place in an all-male prison where one man desires another man's B#tch.) Alas, it took to #10:THOU SHALT KEEP THE SABBATH DAY HOLY,in which men decide to ditch Sunday Church in order to meet together naked and groove to Roberta Flack. The whole film concludes with a curtain call rock song introducing the characters and actors. The song leaves us with the final words:""It's all about love."" END.ROLL CREDITS.

By the time we sat through the last credit, the screen went dark,the lights came up,we all looked at each other and remarked ""What was that?""If the point of this film was to poke fun at the commandments and be just plain goofy, then I am not sure that even the producers accomplished that! It is hard to believe that a movie could be THAT bad. Some people DID laugh, so I know that someone got SOMETHING from this film. I could only shrug and say ""Boy, am I glad I did not have to pay to see this one (though I had to drive 45 minutes up and back at $2.59 a gallon!!!) ONE STAR for a combined effort on commandments #6 and #10!

I would love to see anyone else's take on this film.",1186963200,6,2187,4.421836228287841
922712,1,6304748957,"I am a tad stupidier for having seen The Ten.

Film noir might be this movie's goal, instead it winds up being worse than your average YouTube video. On paper, the movie seems non-conformist and gutsy for going against the Church, etc. In reality, it is cheesy, and is not a parody of anything worthwhile.

There might be some who will notice more inside jokes than others, but overall, the entire movie is one big inside joke on the gullible audience. It's a shame too, because the cast is incredible. Sadly, the actors try the best to deliver their lines, but they have nothing to work with.

In the end, the only one sequence out of ten that is worth watching is the very first one. Featuring Adam Brody as a newly-made celebrity God and Winona Ryder as his fiance, the sequence is keen to pick up on our obsession with the media and celebrities.

Other sequences fall flat in the jokes, with one sequence focusing on being as vulgar as possible, but in Spanish. Additionally, the movie suffers from not having a unified theme and comes together haphazardly at the very end.

By the time the credits roll, you'll be delighted to get on with your life and forget you ever experienced this atrocity.",1186963200,7,1200,4.562790697674418

However, the jokes are lame and the ideas, while maybe having some potential, just never make it to the actually funny. I kept hoping for more, and kept getting let down.

The premise is Paul Rudd's character breaking the fourth wall and presenting stories of people or situations that have contravenes one of the Ten Commandments.  None of the situations presented was funny, with the notable exception of the hilarity that the Jewish character brought.

There are only two reasons, for which I give it two stars instead of one. The first one is the presence of three very attractive women: Famke Janssen, Jessica Alba and Winona Ryder. The second is that in this film there are two (and ONLY two) good jokes: the first one concerns the Second Coming of Jesus Christ (OK, it is VERY blasphemous, but even if I am a Christian, it made me laugh) and the second one is about Winona Ryder falling head over heels for a guy who really got wood...)))

If they couldn't make you laugh while watching a beloved 80's star mock-buck a wooden doll how could it possibly claim comedic status?  The other reviews are true- this movie is BORING. Some of the ""stories"" COULD HAVE BEEN FUNNY if the actors had been directed to act as though they knew they were being stupid and therefore give a wink to the ridiculousness that is this film and invite the viewers to play along. But the acting is done in as serious a manner as over-the-top parody acting can be. It really just leaves the poor souls who watch it saying WTF. I found myself going against THE TEN, saying Oh God, how many more are there, everytime a story ended and we came back to Paul to introduce us to the next commandment. If you weren't religiously inclined previous to this movie I will say it definitely leaves you praying- for it to be over.

I chuckled briefly a FEW times while watching Paul Rudd during his narrator bits...but only because I think he's sexy and I often wonder what's going on inside his twisted humorous mind.

Mostly I think this follows the tradition of most movies which have ""all star"" casts.  Too many famous names means the director is compensating for lack of good writing, plot or anything else that could be justifiably worth your time to watch.
All actors involved should be embarassed to have their names attached to this title. Afterward this left me hoping that the writers/directors have been permanently black-balled from ever touching recordable media again.",1306886400,3,1808,4.687697160883281

This cinematic cold sore is The Ten. It's an allegedly comedic collection of short stories ""based"" on each one of the Ten Commandments [tee hee].

Let's see, where to begin: IT'S NOT FUNNY. Not in the slightest. The stories have little or nothing to do with the particular Commandment to which it's linked...unless, of course, one can truly draw a line from the ""thou shall not covet thy neighbor's goods"" ruling and connect it to two guys in prison making the beast with two backs (get the kids out of the room). Here's a sample of the dialogue, an argument between The Ten's host/moderator (played by, alas, Paul Rudd) has with his wife (Famke Janssen) in front of gigantic approximations of those TWO STONE TABLETS Moses brought down from Mt. Lebanon or wherever:

Man: You know what, Gretchen? You know what you can do?
Wife: Don't say something you're gonna regret.
Man: Go...
Man: Fly...
Wife: I'm warning you, Jeff.
Man: A...
Wife: Don't you say it!
Man [earnestly]: Go fly a kite, Gretchen! Go fly a kite!

Get a load of this: A street sign reads, ""No Parking 8AM - 6PM Mon. thru Adultery."" One cop says amid a gathering of policemen, ""Maybe we should call the cops."" OY, what a hoot! Plus there's plenty of ham-fisted humor about butt-banging, size of the male member, California Gov. Ah-nuld, Mexican farmers, the Rapture, and a Mexican guy named ""Jesus"" who's really...the son of G*d! Golly, what guffaws!

Further, Jessica Alba proves once again how gosh-awful CUTE and yummy-hot she is while displaying minimal acting ability. Winona R pours herself into a scene where she's passionately French-kissing a ventriloquist's dummy. Oh the humanity! I actually felt sorry for her. I would rather eviscerate myself with a rusty lawnmower than sit through Ten again.

If there's somebody you wish to excise from your life, to cast him or her into the Abyss of the Formerly Known, give that special someone a DVD of The Ten.  Give this wretched excuse for a ""movie"" to a friend and make an instant enemy.",1268956800,5,2469,4.7146171693735495

You'll notice that people have a tendency to call it the worst movie they've ever seen, or rate it zero stars. The truth is the humor is so incredibly absurd that it won't appeal to everyone. If you go into it not wanting to like it, you probably won't.

I personally laughed the whole way. So has every audience I've seen it with.

I've seen and enjoyed ""Wet Hot American Summer,"" so I thought that this film from David Wain would deliver..nope. The final scene is an absurd musical recap of the disjointed sketches. The finale just didn't work. I thought for certain that this was originally a musical/play penned by the writers, and adapted unsuccessfully into a film--I wanted desperately to think that this was not the intended product.

923468,1,6304748957,"I have no idea what kind of audience this movie was made for.

It's called THE TEN because it is supposedly satirizing the Ten Commandments, but it's painfully obviously that not one single person responsible for this movie has even read the actual Ten Commandments, let alone anything else biblical.  At least the Monty Pyton guys did a little bit of research for their LIFE OF BRIAN.

Because of their lack of any comprehension of the commandments, they're incapable of producing a sketch remotely involving...let alone a sketch that's remotely funny.

So who are they trying to entertain?  An audience with any religious awareness is going to be put off by the language, crudity and general blasphemy gleefully on display here.  Any agnostics and athiests will be put off by both any religious references as well as the lack of any real comedy.

I feel bad for the people in this movie because I have this sick feeling that there will be a DVD player on Judgment Day...and THE TEN will be reviewed during the cast and crew's appearance in the dock.  Man, I hope I'm not next in line.

This movie was so terrible that I actually felt bad for hating those Broken Lizard losers and their awful movies.  That's a joke, by the way.  The Broken Lizard losers are still grotesquely horrible.

  I originally picked this up for a few dollars somewhere because I couldn't BELIEVE that I hadn't even HEARD of this movie with all of these great actors and actresses in it!  It ought to be HILARIOUS!  Then I watched it and found out WHY.
  I'm not saying that it doesn't have a single funny moment in it.  Almost any comedy, no matter bad, is likely to have at least one or two amusing scenes.  But it was so bad that it wasn't even worth the low price I paid for it.  I was extremely disappointed, and I am very forgiving of comedies.  I enjoy all kinds of humor, and will put up with a lot to get a few nuggets of laughter, but this just had FAR too few to offer.  I even gave it to my brother to see if it was really so bad or if it was just my imagination, and he couldn't even get half way through it.

What were these actors thinking being in this mediocre ""comedy""? They deserve a better movie.

The film seems to be impressed with how ""wacky"" it is. Ha, ha. Instead, it's just silly and stupid. We have two black 20 year olds born to a white couple who wonder about their paternity. The mother thinks it's Arnold Schwarzenegger and hires an actor (Oliver Platt) to pretend to be him. Then the mother realizes the boys' father is really Arsenio Hall. So the actor, who can't do an Arsenio impression, does Eddie Murphy. A woman (Winona Ryder) gets married after her other fiance falls out of a plane and get surgically stuck in the ground. Then she falls for a ventriloquist's dummie and has sex with it and leaves her husband for it. Another sketch is about a woman (Gretchen Mol) whose husband likes to hang out around the house with his other male friends naked rather than go to church. Another tale is a raunchy, offensive cartoon about a rhino who likes to gossip and whose lies lead to grisly deaths by sex.

Doesn't really make any sense, does it? What does any of this have to do with the Ten Commandments? Nothing, really. It's just unfunny nonsense instead of sharp, humorous satire.

None of the sketches based on each of the Ten Commandments were funny or coherent. The acting, the writing, direction, and production values were amateurous to the point of being like a cheap 70's tv movie-of-the-week. The most embarrassing segment is when Winona Ryder's character gets the hots for a ventriloquist's dummy and she steals it to have sex with it.  It was very painful to watch. Overall, a total waste of time.",1207267200,6,546,4.934782608695652
923645,1,6304748957,"First off, THE TEN ignores its own ""high concept."" This film has nothing to do with the Ten Commandments.  It doesn't satirize them or reference them in any substantive way.

For instance, in one of the ten skits, a man jumps from an airplane without a parachute. He survives, but must remain half-buried in the ground. So he becomes a celebrity.  This skit is supposed to depict Thou Shalt Not Worship Other Gods Before Me.

HOW does it relate to that commandment? Because he becomes a celebrity, and we worship celebrities?  It's a weak connection.

Another skit is about a newlywed woman (Winona Ryder) who falls in love with a ventriloquist dummy.  Which commandment is this?  The one about adultery or coveting your neighbor's wife?  No, this is supposed to illustrate Thou Shalt Not Steal, because Ryder steals the dummy at one point.

But that's NOT the gist of the skit.  It's just a minor plot point.  Again, this skit is unrelated in any meaningful way to its commandment.

Of course, one can forgive THE TEN for ignoring its own concept, were it funny.  It's not.

The comedy is all over the place, uncertain what mood or tone it wants.  One skit satirizes Woody Allen's relationship films.  Another resembles the FRITZ THE CAT cartoon.  Others are broad-based TV type skits.

THE TEN's skit comedy structure is similar to KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE, HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE, and MONTY PYTHON'S MEANING OF LIFE, except those films are (1) funnier, and (2) consistent in their comedic tone.

THE TEN is boring, its satirical targets very old, even by TV standards.

It's sad to see Winona Ryder slumming in this mess.  She's in some great films: GIRL INTERRUPTED, LOST SOULS, 1969, BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA, not to mention such excellent comedies as REALITY BITES.

Ryder has too many great films to list -- but most are from the 1980s and 1990s.  In THE TEN she just screeches maniacally, occupying under 10 minutes of screen time, portraying a woman who for no reason suddenly falls in love with a dummy.

This has been a mostly bad decade for Ryder, and THE TEN doesn't change that.

It's sad to see Liev Schreiber slumming in THE TEN.  Schreiber appeared in some of the finest indie films of the 1990s -- WALKING AND TALKING and THE DAYTRIPPERS -- a decade known for great indie films.

But lately Schreiber has appeared in that pointless and poor OMEN remake, and now this.  He just goes through the motions in THE TEN, almost as if he's embarrassed to be in this film, and just wants to get it over with.

A couple of the actors in TEN TEN are from RENO 911 -- except RENO 911 is much funnier.  And the actors do nothing to improve THE TEN with their presence.

They didn't. It just kept sliding downhill, and finally I gave up and took it back to the video store, two days early.

Folks who think that Wes Anderson is a brilliant, gifted genius might get off on this flick.  Like Anderson's ouvre, the humor is crude and overly-obvious, and the basic technique is to pile one joke on top of another, ad nauseum.  Meanwhile, all the attention is placed on the self-satisfied cleverness of the writers, and thus the actual directing is weak and actors are allowed to coast. Isn't it groovy and miraculous enough that they are vehicles for the brilliantly witty bon mots of the writer -- why should they have to act as well?

This film is about as subtle as a ton of bricks.  Dropped on your toes. From a great height, so your feet turn to jelly.  And they, your feet, hurt a lot.  And start oozing and festering.  And then all your friends start calling you Fester. And you start getting all these Addams Family jokes tossed at you until one day you go crazy and rob a bank.  (And did I mention, the jokes in this film are often written in about the same way as this paragraph, with about as much comedic effect -- close to nil -- and it keeps on going on and on and on and on and on and each sequence is at least as lame as the one before it?  It's like a student film on steroids, and that isn't funny either...)

Paul Rudd, who I think is a great comedic actor, serves as the postmodern, irony-laden, hipster's Rod Serling, introducing each of the ten segments... And, oh, what a stain on his resume!

I have to admit I didn't make it through to the end of The Ten (I did get through about 95% of it, but kept asking myself when it would get better?!) as it just never did get any better.

I wouldn't say it's awful, but like another reviewer of this item (read elsewhere), I have to ask those that are raving about how great this movie was just what they were seeing here that I wasn't?!

I saw some hints of humor, some glints and pieces of what might have been funny and entertaining, but most of what I saw was just weird and humorless, and many times trying too hard to be shocking and funny.

Paul Rudd can be funny.  I've seen him in other things and liked his work.  Jessica Alba can be, well anything she pleases in my book {yummmm}.  Famke Jansen can be almost anything she wants too.  So it's not like there is no talent here to work with.  It just seems that the talent was perhaps misused, and that things went in a completely different direction to wind up creating a final product that some people, but most people may miss the point of.  At a minimum, I'd have to say that if this is what passes for humor now, then perhaps the writers should stay on strike and bring on the scabs.  They couldn't do any worse.

Some of the one-liners alone will be worth the price of ordering it right now. David Wain and Ken Marino really push some boundaries here, and with a cast like this, the result is so special. Their ability to take things so far is truly unique, and I think it may go over a few people's heads. I don't understand why a film like this isn't given the publicity it needs to make the impact that it can.
Sometimes I feel the subtleties Wain uses in his directing are lost on viewers who only pick up on the more extreme gags. But if you can really hone in on all the different facets that make his style so unique, you'll begin to see just how many levels he's capable of working with to generate a film that stands up to any other comedy, classic or otherwise. There's something for everyone but you need to give the film your attention span and your imagination.

Incase David or Ken read these: the joke about the guy being stuck under the rocks being given a chance to become a star is so amazing. Also, digging a little deeper into Flack's collection (Greatest Hits - Track 2), so so wonderful. Thankyou for these types of jokes...I just can't find them anywhere else!

This is the kind of film that needs help from the people who love it, so if you love it, write another review telling everyone it's awesome. The world needs to the see The Ten!",1200182400,5,2424,4.166311300639659

And why doesn't Amazon allow ZERO stars????  The creative minds behind this have committed the ultimate sin -- it's just not funny.  The first Gretchen Mol bit had potential but that was rapidly exhausted.  The rest of this is truly awful.

I went into this movie only knowing that it was directed by the same gent who did the genius ""wet hot american summer.""  that was enough to get me to buy a ticket.  I do suggest this tactic--seeing the movie knowing as little as possible--as there is a lot hidden away in the details and one ought to be all bright and open to take it in.  have fun with it!

923818,5,6304748957,"I find the term ""genius"" to be overused to the point of meaninglessness, but after experiencing the comic extravagansa that is ""The Ten"" that is the term that begs to be used.

I've had in my life of watching movies only a handful of times where the lights come up afterward and I feel like I've had an out-of-body experience: laughing so hard I'm in tears, taken for a ride to comic heights as I was in the hands of these master filmmakers.

The film is divided into ten stories, loosely based on each of the Ten Commandments. This clever device serves perfectly, as every style fully explores its premise and style without overstaying its welcome, leaving you wanting just a little bit more, then we're onto the next. But the Ten Commandments theme informs all the stories, and various characters and jokes brilliantly overlap and reappear.

The movie is held together by the endlessly appealing Paul Rudd (""Knocked Up""), who plays a sort of MC, trying as he might to present the ten stories, only to be distracted by tumultuous personal life, involving his wife (Famke Janssen in a startling wonderful comic turn) and a younger woman (Jessica Alba, stealing scenes as the perky Liz Anne Blazer).

The interstitial segments with Mr. Rudd would alone be worth the price of admission, but there are dozens of scenes that will go down in our collective memories as classic moments in movie comedy, executed by a veritable who's who of top movie and comedy stars, including Adam Brody, Bobby Cannavale, Rob Corddry, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Ken Marino, A. D. Miles, Gretchen Mol, Oliver Platt, Paul Rudd, Winona Ryder, Liev Schreiber, Ron Silver, Jason Sudeikis, Justin Theroux, Joe Lo Truglio, Mather Zickel, Michael Ziegfeld and more. To explain more of the plot(s) would ruin the often surprising and shocking fun, so I shall restrain myself.

Kudos also to the fine craft of the film, from the expansive music score by Shudder to Think's Craig Wedren (of whom I've been a fan for a long time), and to the lush cinematography and production design. As a dessert of sorts, the movie ends with a rousing musical finale that rivals Stanley Donen in his prime.

Pound for pound, The Ten is the most satisfying, entertaining night I've spent at the movies all year -- and that's saying a lot in a year that brought us top entries from the Cohen Brothers, P. T. Anderson, among others. I'll say it here: The Ten beats them all. If it doesn't sweep the Oscars, then the fix is in.

Truly the only disapointment was that there wasn't more of The Ten when it was done. This is grandly rectified by the deluxe DVD release coming on January 15th. There's a hilarious commentary track by the filmmakers and Mr. Rudd, including a wry counterpoint from the director's very funny parents. Also a generous selection of entertaining and informative behind-the-scenes, interviews, outtakes, bloopers, and alternate cuts.

If you don't go out and buy The Ten on DVD the day it comes out (Jan 15), you're completely nuts and should have your head examined. It is without exageration, quite literally the best movie ever made.

Not to mention, there were TONS of big names (Jessica Alba, Paul Rudd, Winona Ryder, Adam Brody).

The Ten is not just funny, but is an anti-formula movie that recalls the absurdist humor of Monty Python, as well as of course Wet Hot American Summer.  I have read mixed reviews by critics in the press, and I think that just like Wet Hot, most critics have overlooked the originality and fresh humor of The Ten.  It is ironic that the critics, who are supposed to be more in the know about these things, actually could not appreciate this movie because it defies the conventions and formulas of studio comedies. If anything, it should be the critics that are on the front lines of recognizing originality.  But as with David Wain's Wet Hot American Summer, The Ten will become a comedy classic as viewers see and appreciate the movie on DVD.  My wife and I fist saw the film at Sundance, and then at several other festivals since, and we find ourselves quoting the film each and every day.  I get more jokes at every viewing, as they range from over the top slapstick to very  subtle.  Highly recommend this movie - you will not be disappointed!",1194393600,8,1211,4.518348623853211
923886,5,6304748957,"I was reluctant to go see The Ten because I heard that it was really raunchy.  But I was very surprised at how laugh out loud funny it was. The film is a loose interpretation of the ten commandments, but the stories are totally absurd and the relationship between the commandments and these stories is almost non existent.  Yes, the Though Shalt Not Steal scenes is about Winona Ryder stealing (a puppet).  But the scenes don't teach any moral lessons, they are only an excuse to tell wild and racy stories that are not only funny, but full of Director David Wain's weird imagination and style.  I am a big fan of Wain's Stella and The State stuff, and also his first feature, Wet Hot American Summer.  I'm also starting to watch his new webisodes on the net. Wain and his cowriter (Ken Marino, who also acts in the film) came up with some classic and dialogs throughout the movie, such as ""I did it as a goof"" (what the doctor says when he murders his patient) and ""That's what makes it rape"" during his prison scene with Rob Cordrey.  I also liked the fact that Winona Ryder was willing to make fun of her tabloid problems and her  kleptomania by being in the ""Thou Shalt Not Steal"" story.  She showed me that she has a good  sense of humor about it all. This is not a movie for everyone, but if you're into ""out there,"" absurd humor and are not afraid of being offended, this one's a killer.",1194307200,10,1394,4.351351351351352

He got himself an unbelievably funny cast, many from that first film, and pulled off a movie that is completely off the wall. Even though the film is nutty and fun, I found that by making fun of just about every type of person in our American society, it did open up my head a bit.  I think that this film is more than just really funny, with great, totally unexpected stories, but that it also shows us how weird and stupid we Americans can be. Each of the ten stories, that came from the ten commandments, was totally different and made us laugh like crazy.  Some were outrageous and some were just funny in a more ""normal"" way.  I took my uncle and aunt to see it and they were laughing at most of the gags too, but they missed a couple of them.

Rob Corddry was his would be lover, an easy going, loveable, inmate and male rapist. He was great but the scene was tough to watch at times. Most of the cast was great, especially Jessica Alba, Paul Rudd and Oliver Platt, who played a phony Arnold Schwarzenegger.  They were all playing roles that you wouldn't expect major actors to play.  That was fun to see.  I didn't really get into the animated scenes, but it looked like a lot of the younger people in the theater liked those scenes a lot.

This was not a typical comedy. And these stories were all coming from the Ten Commandments. My wife and I (and her friend) were shocked at first, then settled into this zany world where every story was totally different, but they were all kept together by the narrator, Paul Rudd, who had his own ridiculous story going on.

I know that sounds confusing but it's brilliant!  It's really a fun to watch film.  So much better than the tired comedies coming from the major studios. I saw ""The Ten"" in the theater a couple months ago and missed a bunch of the jokes because I couldn't hear them over the audience laughter.

923966,5,6304748957,"There are many mediocre films in the world. And then there are brilliant ones. Often the brilliant films are ones of which it is said ""Either you'll love it or you'll hate it."" This is said frequently of trademark filmmakers like Wes Anderson, Sofia Coppola, and Darren Aronofsky.

I hesitate to include David Wain in the class with the above, because he certainly doesn't subscribe himself to a league of serious artists. But his works (Stella, Wet Hot American Summer, The State, and The Ten) do have a trademark to them, a quite brilliant one. I've tried to give serious thought to what it is that makes his films work so well, and finally settled that it is a brilliant mix of the dedicated parody and the absurd non sequitur.

In his work we often see him take a cinematic staple and put it to the situational test. In ""The Ten"" we are given multiple treatments of a traditional story with a situational twist: a young man's values are put to the test when he becomes a Hollywood superstar; two sons wonder about their true father; lovers fall apart as one of them begins to fall for another. In the hands of filmmakers over time these stories have been given a genre treatment that has led to certain expectations. We expect the sweeping musical score, the intense close up, the slow motion, the emotional dialogue. In the hands of Wain the sequence is the same, but the situational elements are turned on their head. Specific story elements become non sequiturs, chosen under the criteria that they have as little to do with the cohesive theme as possible: the young man's fame comes from him being stuck in a hole in the ground; the sons are told their father is actually Arnold Schwarzeneggar, and instead of reuniting them they are introduced to a Schwarzeneggar impersonator; the lovers turn out to be two quite masculine prison inmates who end up arguing as if they were on a soap opera.

This abuse of genre is definitely Wain's strong point. It would be difficult, after becoming used to his style to trust him with something more sincerely emotional. In fact, the very vignette which works least in ""The Ten"" is the one where he is the least satirical and the most original - ""The Lying Rhino."" Though it is a brilliant animation, and absurd, it is the only one with a complete absence of any reference to make it relatable. However, within his trademark element Wain takes the most established cinematic traditions and lovingly butchers them to a point where an audience member can no longer even watch ""Law and Order"" or ""Oz"" without scoffing at sincerity of the characters.

Going to a place beyond the slapstick parody, Wain actually adopts the storytelling techniques of the genre, wedding it to a completely absurd reality taken as far as possible. There is no winking. There is no nudging. It is truly sincere. This results in humorous irony in its purest form, taking Wain's work to a place beyond comedy - closer to Dadaism - and yet more accessible than high art - given rapid fire jokes and an approachable premise.

That said, if you are unfamiliar with David Wain, you definitely have to come to The Ten with a complete absence of expectations. Appreciation comes only with acceptance.",1191628800,21,3213,4.699822380106572
