8010632,5,B0001DHSD8,Leslie Sansone is amazing. The yoga DVD is so fantastic. I use it almost every day to stretch out maintain flexibility. She guides you through each pose and explains what each is doing for your body!  The pilates DVD seems so easy but the workout is painful and effective!,1367020800,,272,4.551020408163265
8010633,5,B0001DHSD8,"Leslie Sansone is one of my favorite fitness instructors. She is cheerful, clear, and really talks you through everything. She is very encouraging. This 3 DVD system gives you exposure to yoga, abs, and pilates techniques for beginners. I was completely inexperienced to all of those things, yet through doing the videos and being coached through them by Leslie, I now have understanding of basic techniques and vocabulary and how to adjust them for a person who is just starting off. I particularily like the pilates dvd. This set is perfect for someone looking to get started and try, who might be intimidated otherwise.",1308614400,,622,4.990384615384615

8010637,5,B0001DHSD8,"This series is the easiest method of learning yoga, pilates and ab work with the balance ball.  I have thus far only done the Yoga and Pilates, but both are incredibly simple and surprisingly effective.  A good way to add variety to your workouts, esp. if you're already doing alot of Leslie's other workout programs.  I recommend this series and commend Leslie for doing a service to the fans who love her workouts-a little change here and there challenges the body and keeps the mind motivated and fresh.",1084752000,41,506,4.7272727272727275
