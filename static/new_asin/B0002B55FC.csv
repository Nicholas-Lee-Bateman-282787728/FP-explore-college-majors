2074288,4,B0002B55FC,"The name Herschell Gordon Lewis may not mean anything to you but to fans of horror and especially gore films Lewis rules. In a day and age when nearly every horror film being made features more gore than scares, few realize that at one time this wasn't seen on film. Lewis was the first to make it so and he started off with three films represented in this wonderful package from Image Entertainment, THE BLOOD TRILOGY.

The first film offered was Lewis first foray into this genre, BLOOD FEAST. The story revolves around a caterer in the Florida area who specializes in exotic themed parties named Fuad Ramses (Mal Arnold). There is a killer in the area that is taking select body parts off of his female victims and in no time flat we the viewers know that Fuad is behind it all. It seems that he continues to worship an Egyptian goddess and is in the midst of preparing a sacrificial feast to bring her back to Earth. A huge number of coincidental clues eventually lead the police to Fuad before he can complete his task.

So what makes this movie one that folks remember? Of course, the gore. Made in 1963 it was the first film to feature anything this over the top. Within the first 5 minutes we have a girl murdered in her bathtub and he leg hacked off. The glimpse of the exposed bone sticking out of the stump where her leg was before covered in the brightest red imaginable was astounding at the time. For some it would still be that way. Other gore scenes include a woman having her tongue ripped out (with some hilarious sound editing) and a brain removed on the beach. It was shocking enough that in some spots the movie was closed down and banned from being played. But not enough that it wasn't one of the most successful independent movies ever made and the beginning of a genre that Lewis became associated with.

The second film offered is Lewis favorite and one remade recently with Robert England of Freddy Krueger fame, TWO THOUSAND MANIACS. For a horror film there is more story here than most offer even if it might borrow just a tad from the classic musical BRIGADOON. Ever so many years a small Southern town is resurrected and the folks there lure in tourist and treat them special for their annual celebration. The problem is that these folks have been lured there for the South to take vengeance on the North for losing the Civil War. These folks intend to do nothing but torture and murder these ""guests"". Gore scenes here include an arm hacked off with an axe, a finger cut off with pruning sheers and a dunk tank device that drops a boulder on a guest tied to a platform beneath it. The best thing about this film was the actual story going on, the whole ghost town that appears only at select times. That's an intriguing idea and more original than most horror films being made today.

The last of the three films included in this package is COLOR ME BLOOD RED and perhaps my least favorite of the three. Here we have an artist who isn't the favorite of the critics in his town. One thing they note is his lack of the use of the color red. An accident leads him to use the blood of his girlfriend in one of the pictures he is painting which of course the critic can't say enough good things about. This leads him on a murderous rampage so he can have more ""paint"" to use in his paintings. Made in 1965 the theme here wasn't quite original since Roger Corman used a similar device in his film BUCKET OF BLOOD back in 1959. It is the weakest of the three films but still interesting.

The main thing to witness with these movies is that they were made in a time when these sorts of films weren't the norm. Lewis, who began shooting industrial films and then what were termed ""nudie cuties"" had decided he needed to make something different and you can certainly see that he did just that. The movies played across the countries in drive ins for years.

The violence is almost cartoonish in a way and the acting for the most part it terrible. But looking at it from the standpoint of someone shooting a film on their own terms without any involvement from major Hollywood studio involvement and it being so successful financially makes you take notice. This was guerilla film making in its earliest form. And the truth is that while some of the lighting is lacking at times and the budget for sets and more is infinitesimal, Lewis actually makes a pretty good looking film.

While these films may not be for everyone, for movie fans they will be something you will want to add to your collection because of their historical value. Horror fans will want to watch them to see what gore films were like in their earliest stage. And the curious will want to watch to see what all the talk was about. Don't focus on the negatives of the movies but put yourself in a theater seat back in 1963 and imagine the shock value that these films had at the time. Do that and you just might like THE BLOOD TRILOGY.

I will say that while not the greatest movies ever made the historical value of these films which began the gore used in films adds a start to the rating.",1332806400,,5083,4.411513859275053
2074289,5,B0002B55FC,"I just wanted to say, These movies are all great, and others like them. I must own about 150 movies of this type. A Lot of people that leave reviews for these types of movies always seem to use the words ""So bad They are Good"". I have never felt that way. To me these movies are so good because they ARE good! ""Something Weird Video Company"" is probably THE BEST distributor of this stuff. And they make the movies even more enjoyable with all their extras they add to the discs, stuff you probably just wouldn't see anywhere else. When you think of all the work the filmmakers of these movies put into creating them, because they did most of the work themselves, you begin to appreciate their efforts. I like that these movies are what they are. An art form within themselves. Nowadays they are extra fun cause you get to see all those old classic cars when they were all new. And the shots of old grocery items, or the shots of the old style gas stations. Fun is the best way to describe these movies. Great Stuff.",1329264000,,1016,4.324607329842932
2074290,4,B0002B55FC,"It would be easy to pass this up as being a package of movies that was put cheaply together for a quick buck if you didn't know better.  Don't make that assumption.

These are three examples of early gore from the pioneers of the genre, Herschell Gordon Lewis and David F. Friedman.  While not exactly Oscar-worthy, they have their place in cinema history.  The transfers on the Blu-ray discs aren't exactly reference quality, but they're fine for these films, and probably far better than they ever looked on drive-in screens.  In some scenes, you could argue they look TOO good.  The main audio tracks are PCM mono.

BLOOD FEAST - If you ever wondered where modern horror started, look no further than this cult classic.  A caterer puts together a feast using body parts of his victims.  Filmed on a budget of $24,500 (according to Friedman in the commentary), it is one of the most horribly acted movies you will ever see...yet there's something appealing about this film even today.  The gore, cheesy by today's standards, was like nothing ever seen before in its day.  The movie became a sensation at drive-in circuits around the country and birthed a segment of cinema that simply hadn't existed previously.

TWO THOUSAND MANIACS - After making names for themselves with ""Blood Feast"", Lewis and Friedman made ""Two Thousand Maniacs"" with triple the budget.  A small Southern town celebrates the anniversary of the Civil War by tricking some Northern tourists into town and killing them in various community events.  Most of the actual residents of the shooting location were all too happy to participate in filming, which made the movie look far bigger than it was.

COLOR ME BLOOD RED - A frustrated artist can't find his color...until his girlfriend accidentally cuts herself.  After creating his masterpiece with her blood, he needs more to continue painting.  You know where this is going.

Watch them all twice...once without the commentary, then once with.  Lewis and Friedman provide some great stories, especially if you're a fan of drive-ins and understand the history of exploitation cinema.  And don't miss the extras ""Follow That Skirt!"" (possibly the best thing on the disk) and a vintage short about cutting meat called ""Carving Magic!"".

For the asking price, this is an outstanding value.",1317600000,13,2310,4.97911227154047
2074291,5,B0002B55FC,"Blood Feast

Herschell Gordon Lewis made Horror history with 1963's BLOOD FEAST, widely considered to be the first ""gore"" film. In the years before the MPAA, filmmakers were only limited from showing excessive nudity on-screen. With no rules preventing anyone in the movie industry from depicting gratuitous violence or horrifying bodily dismemberment, H.G. Lewis and business partner David F. Friedman embarked on a series of films that exploited these loose regulations in an attempt to compete with the major studio releases in the drive-in circuit. The two did not ease in to this newly established genre with just a few missing limbs or a severed head, but (literally) covered the screen in blood and butchery from start to finish. This simply had never been done before, and even to this day, BLOOD FEAST continues to serve as one of the most shocking and gruesome films in the genre.

Mrs. Fremont is throwing a dinner party for her daughter's engagement, so in order to impress her guests, she has hired the exotic caterer Fuad Ramses to put on an extravagant feast! What she doesn't know is that Fuad has worked up a special menu made from bits and pieces of the missing girls from around town, which he will be serving as the main course in an Egyptian blood feast to appease the goddess Ishtar!

PSYCHO, this is not; Lewis' listless direction shows all of the style and finesse of an early stag film (another genre with which he was fondly familiar). BLOOD FEAST tastefully implies nothing, and instead plasters the screen in one lurid image after another, using as few camera set-ups and shots as possible for the minimal amount of coverage provided. Lewis and Friedman would tap Playboy playmate Connie Mason to star as the beautiful young bride-to-be, who would return for their follow-up 2000 MANIACS the next year. Mason, along with her fellow cast members, produce truly horrible performances, but the roles are so poorly acted and outrageously over-the-top that they give way to the highest level of camp. As if the subject matter was not forward enough, Lewis' editing clearly demonstrates his lack of concern with plotting or characterization, as the camera holds on the disfigured remains of Fuad's victims much longer than it ever does for any of the characters in the film.

Using gallons of red paint and nearly an entire butcher's shop of animal entrails, BLOOD FEAST offers everything from a beach full of splattered brains, to a torn out tongue, a hacked off leg, and more in eye-popping color film stock! While this may not seem like much, the method in which the murders are filmed and the absolutely absurd amount of bright-red blood make these moments as memorable as they are completely revolting.

Herschell Gordon Lewis, the ""Godfather of Gore,"" has left behind a bloody trail of influence in the wake of this seminal shocker. BLOOD FEAST has had a profound effect on countless young filmmakers, and will continue to live on in the annals of Horror for many years to come.
-----------------------------------

Two Thousand Maniacs

A conveniently placed detour sign on a remote country road lands a group of Northern vacationers right smack dab in the middle of Pleasant Valley's Centennial celebration. The jovial Mayor Buckman invites the newcomers to participate in each of the town's festivities, but what the visitors don't know is that they are being lead to the slaughter as part of the locals' bloody revenge for a Civil War defeat! Herschell Gordon Lewis' drive-in classic TWO THOUSAND MANIACS is a vast improvement over his first gorefest, BLOOD FEAST, complete with a highly imaginative plot and several of the most memorable executions in shock cinema. Of the many carnival games the travelers 'participate' in, the bloodiest include a spiked barrel roll, a four-way horse race, and a smashing game of Hit the Target! The outrageously over-the-top acting and absurd dialog only add to the film's campy charm, but Lewis' no-budget approach to filmmaking only produces the same flat results in terms of the actual production. Regardless, TWO THOUSAND MANIACS is the Godfather of Gore's greatest film, and an early milestone in the history of splatter pictures.
----------------------------

Color Me Blood Red

His third gore film in three years, COLOR ME BLOOD RED is the last of the three pictures that make up Herschell Gordon Lewis' original 'Blood Trilogy.' It is also the most sophisticated of any of his films, and one that is likely his most personal. It tells the tale of Adam Sorg, a struggling artist that only finds success after he begins painting in his victims' blood! The theme of the tortured artist is taken to absurd new heights (or lows, rather) in this gruesome black comedy. Lewis instills his frustrations with his own lack of critical acclaim through his preferred medium, while commenting on how his only means of receiving any recognition in film was to include more blood and gore. Surprisingly, COLOR is even more visceral than either of the other entries in the series, containing everything from the disemboweling of a model to a brain-splattering shotgun blast to the face. Gordon Oas-Heim also provides an intense performance as the lead, closing out the thrilling climax with a bang! While it rarely ranks as a favorite among fans, this truly is one of Lewis' better films.

2074292,4,B0002B55FC,"It wasn't that long ago that going to the movies was a different experience.  There were few multiplexes, and most theaters showed double features.  When you went to the movies, you had to clarify that it was a ""walk-in"" theater because drive-ins were a popular alternative.  It was a time when there were many low-budget movies produced by minor studios and making limited runs; these were a more charming version of the direct-to-video schlock that is made nowadays.  H.G. Lewis was pretty successful at these low budget movies, especially with horror:  Lewis was a pioneer in the field of gory movies, producing grisly movies decades before Jason, Freddy and Michael would make it standard film fare.

The so-called Blood Trilogy is actually three separate movies; the name was given in later years when they were released and shown as a set in theaters.  The first film is Blood Feast, the tale of a madman killing young women to prepare a cannibalistic feast in honor of Ishtar.  Lewis's formula is often the more blood, the better, but often the actual act of violence isn't really shown, only the result.  We see the villainous Fuad Ramses making his attack, and we see the dead body, but we rarely see the actual stabbing (or other act).  By many standards, this is a pretty awful movie:  the acting is amateurish and the writing and sets are not much better, but it (and its two companion movies) has an Ed-Woodish appeal to it:  it's in that so-bad-it's-good category that easily develops a cult following.  It is also pretty much the first truly bloody movie, so even if flawed, it is a breakthrough film.

Two Thousand Maniacs is the best movie in the set, the tale of an isolated Southern town that lures unsuspecting Yankees to participate in a special celebration, which turns out to be the anniversary of some Union atrocities.  Now, the residents are out to exact their own unique form of revenge against the North with murders taking place in a carnival-like atmosphere.

The final film is Color Me Blood Red, a take-off on House of Wax and Bucket of Blood with an artist achieving success through murder.  In this case, it is a painter who discovers the color he needs to achieve his vision can only be gotten through blood.  He apparently doesn't think of using animals (there wouldn't be much of a movie in this case).  Instead, he starts with his girlfriend and moves on to people who wander too close to his home.

All three movies are pretty short and come with entertaining commentaries by Lewis and his producer which make it clear that they knew these were never going to win any Oscars.  There are also trailers, a gallery of ads that show how these movies were promoted and a short subject on meat carving that features a very young Harvey Korman.  Thanks to the movie Juno - which shows a small clip from Lewis's The Wizard of Gore, it is likely that Lewis will get some renewed interest.  The Blood Trilogy set is a good way to be introduced to him with his first three horror flicks.",1213574400,4,3015,4.657844990548204

2074296,2,B0002B55FC,"I thought I might mention that the widescreen presentation on this Blu-Ray seems to be created artificially by cutting off the top and bottom of the picture.  This is most obvious in 2000 Maniacs and the proof is that HGL and DFF are discussing Connie Mason's duck-foot pose when she's in the police station - on the full frame DVD you can see her feet, but in this presentation they are invisible. Then you'll notice how close ups of faces frequently cut off the lower mouth and jaw, as when the mayor and other crazies are leering at the dismembered woman on the desk. It's very disconcerting. Also, notice how the audio commentary on 2000 Maniacs in this presentation is slowed down for some reason, so everyone sounds like they've been chugging cough syrup. I really think all of these films looked fine on their DVDs and they should be seen in full frame, not widescreen. On the positive side, it's cool that all three movies fit on one disc with their trailers and outtakes and such. I just don't see why anyone would prefer the false widescreen which offers only about 2/3 of the original picture and creates some jarring images that make it seem as if the camera operator was incompetent at framing a picture.

Also included is audio commentaries from H.G. Lewis, David Friedman and some guy who runs Something Weird Video in which are very fun to listen to. Normally, audio commentaries are boring, pretentious, and stupid but these guys are funny and honest and their stories are entertaining to listen to. Also there are a couple of short films, outtakes, trailers and photo galleries.

Movie Reviews: These movies are flat out entertaining. They are also exploitation so don't expect epics like Lord Of The Rings. Of course if you did expect it, you should be shot. These movies are the very first films to ever use gore EVER! Doesn't mean they are best gore films ever made (Dead Alive and Story Of Ricky are what I consider the best) but these films did what they suppose to do: ENTERTAIN!

What I like about this collection is that there are 3 commentary tracks(one for each movie); so after watching each movie, I can enjoy listening to the enlightening comments from Lewis and Friedman(Mr. Lewis definitely dominates all the commentary tracks and doesn't let anyone else get a word in edgewise).

The picture and sound quality for each movie is pretty damn good. And similar to most SWV releases, this set contains a good deal of special features including comment tracks, featurettes, trailers, etc. As a side note, the Blu-ray case feels rather cheap and flimsy. And also in my opinion the box-cover artwork seems a bit bland compared to Something Weird's older releases.

""Two Thousand Maniacs"" has a group of traveling strangers traveling to a myserious Southern town where it's folks are welcoming them but unknowingly them to the strangers, the townsfolks are cannibalistic killers.

He cuts his hands to rub it there yet yearns for more blood as he decides to kills people to use their blood for art.

All three movies were legendary as they are landmark exploitation movies from the legendary HG Lewis and were quite controversial for their graphic violence which made people back then sick yet seems laughable today.
