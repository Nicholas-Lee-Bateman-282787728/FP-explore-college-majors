6677968,5,B00NSHF41W,"The character limit will not allow me to say enough about 'Mardaani'. I absolutely loved this movie. If you liked ' Man on Fire' starring Denzel Washington, you'll love ' Mardaani'. Rani Mukerji played her role to perfection. Yash Raj did a great job of bringing awareness to a Horrific Reality, that is rarely brought to light.",1415664000,8,328,4.771929824561403

8679895,3,B00NSHF41W,"Rani, of course, but not much else. Women are almost all  good, all men are oppressors or corrupt or cry a lot. 16 ear old girls kick a man to death.  Not a serious attempt to look at a very, very, serious problem. Would have preferred to see Rani head an investigating team tracking these vermin down lawfully, instead of this mindless emotional drivel. This sort of thing doesn't empower young women in any way, and might indeed encourage them to confront bad men in hand to hand combat, resulting in their complete and immediate destruction.",1461974400,,544,4.65625
8679896,5,B00NSHF41W,"This is one very good dvd. I normally don't buy Indian film, but this one is hard hitting and gives a look into the underworld of child trafficking.",1447113600,,148,4.321428571428571
8679897,4,B00NSHF41W,"Mardaani is a film which spotlights the rising incidence of missing girls in India, a girl goes missing every 8 minutes - that is horrifying - perhaps even more is the fact that India is the leading hub of girl trafficking.
Mardaani tries to tackle this problem with the tale of Shivani Shivaji Roy, a cop who is a cross between Singham and Chulbul Pandey. She is roused to action when a girl that she had saved from the streets goes missing and leads her to unravel a sex trafficking ring in Delhi.

Director Pradeep Sarkar, coming off the twin debacles of Laaga Chunari Mein Daag and Lafangey Parindey after the high of Parineeta, hits all the right buttons this time around.

Rani is wise to choose a small film that gives her a women centric role that is full of action. I thought she was hamming in many scenes and the cursing was too forced. However this is her film and she dominates each frame.
Tahir Raj Bhasin as the pimp delivers a performance that is chilling in the initial stages but loses fizz towards the end. It seems that the writers saved the best for Rani.  Anil George as his henchman Vakil is the most effective. This film might not appeal to everyone but it is still a watch and time goes by very quickly as this film was under two hours.

Relase date: 22nd, August 2014.",1426032000,,1294,4.401673640167364

8679899,5,B00NSHF41W,Rani Mukherji is such a beautiful and versatile actress.  It's wonderful to see her owning this movie!,1424390400,,102,5.0
8679900,4,B00NSHF41W,"Mardaani is Rani Mukerji's clearing of throat and her nudge in your ribs, reminding you that she still holds it down as one of Indian cinema's finest actors. Mardaani (2014) is a gritty, hard-nosed crime thriller that showcases Rani in a gritty, hard-nosed role. She plays Shivani Shivaji Roy, the shrewd, unflappable Senior Officer assigned to Mumbai's Crime Branch, Unit 3. She comes across as a more restrained version of grandstanding supercops like Bajirao Singham, Chulbul Pandey, and Rowdy Rathore. And maybe the most gratifying thing is that Roy's gender doesn't have much to do with the story. Her sex isn't brought up. She's well respected by her underlings. It's with ease that she partakes in the squad's roughhouse camaraderie.

At home she cooks for her Bengali doctor husband (Jisshu Sengupta) and tends to her growing niece (Avneet Kaur). In fact, the plot's catalyst revolves around Shivani Roy's relentless search for her niece's orphaned friend (Priyanka Sharma) who one day vanished from her shelter home in the Andheri suburb. From there, Roy unearths a flesh peddling racket and tackles a string of underworld front men, even as she engages in snappy cat-and-mouse phone banter with the cool mastermind (Tahir Raj Bhasin) what's pulling strings behind the curtain.

Mardaani sustains a self-image as this important picture, and maybe so. It rips its cue from the newspaper headlines. It sheds light on a morbid trivia that India is the leading hot bed of human trafficking, of missing girls. Mardaani is competent as a crime drama but ranks below the classic likes of, say, Heat and Infernal Affairs and Gangs of Wasseypur. There's a dichotomy in play here in that while the movie mostly stays within the comfy confines of commercial cinema, it does take chances that Bollywood normally doesn't. There are unsettling moments to make you shift in discomfort. But the pace is good. The cinematography purposely stays away from the traditional bounty of vivid, vivid colors often found in Bollywood cinema. Mardaani looks polished yet gritty. It has a taut running time of under two hours. Credit Pradeep Sarkar for his uncluttered approach to directing, and maybe the absence of musical item numbers contributes to the narrative clarity.

Tahir Raj Bhasin matches up well as Rani's main adversary. Bhasin's Big Bad is cunning and savvy, contemporary and hip. He plays video games while issuing his criminal orders. A Breaking Bad poster graces his wall and maybe explains his American sobriquet. I like that his bluster is understated and, therefore, more slyly menacing. And, as mentioned, his back-and-forth on the mobile with Rani is a recurring highlight of the movie. It's Rani Mukerji who beautifully anchors the works. In her hands, the fearless Shivani Roy projects toughness and smarts and bullish dedication. She comes across as an authentic character. Even her liberal cursing comes off natural, as part of her DNA. It's amusing though when the sub-titles try to sugarcoat her swear words. Yo, she's clearly not saying ""Damn."" Anyway, I thought Rani's best scene happens when - and, uh, probably a ***SPOILER ALERT FOR THE REST OF THIS SENTENCE*** - she must deal with the aftermath of the crime lord's character assassination of her husband.

Rani had to train in Krav Maga, the no-frills Israeli street-fighting martial arts, and she makes gratifying use of the technique in her showdown with her nemesis.

It's a bit deflating when, post-intermission, the film reverts to type and ramps up the melodrama and the hokey dialogue. Still, dear whomever, Mardaani is worth your watch if you're craving something a bit off left field from Bollywood. It's a film that stretches its wings some. There's a whiff of Liam Neeson's Taken, if you're into that. It's a no-nonsense nudge that Rani Mukerji is still around and still very much capable of killing it in a relevant role. And if nothing else, I appreciate this movie for that one moment of nostalgic infusion when the strains of ""Kajra Re"" - my favorite item number ever - played over the raid sequence early on.

What I have are 2 discs. Disc 1 has the feature presentation in Anamorphic Widescreen and a choice of 5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Digital Sound with optional subtitles for English and Arabic. Disc 2 has these bonus features (in Hindi with smatterings of English):

- Making of the Film
- 10 Deleted Scenes
- Mardaani Anthem - Music Video
- Krav Maga videos - demo clips that demonstrate various defensive countermoves and strikes, with an introduction from Rani Mukerji
- Theatrical trailer & TV promos",1423958400,9,4586,5.0183968462549275
8679901,5,B00NSHF41W,"India awakens . . . FINALLY!!!!  A society that fails to value its women sets itself up for serious difficulties.  It contributes to male narcissism.  Narcissism is not a matter of self-love, but of deeper self-hatred covered over by a twisted, vicious veneer of entitlement feelings and rabidly self-indulgent behavior.  Men damaged by such ""spoiling"" can't ever get off on how much they've got, but rather they get off on how much what they have took away from or deprived others of.

  There seems to be displayed in this film a new attitude in India, one certain to rescue at least as many men as women.  I don't really know. but I can't help imagining that this movie must have been something of an event in India.  The point is not so much the heroine, who appears as some sort of mythical being.  But the ultimate smallness of the one-way minded (i.e., selfishly unidirectional), corrupt and criminal males in this movie (as well as their few female co-conspirators)-- and the transformational arc to empty nothingness they go through in the course of the drama-- THAT'S THE THING TO WATCH HERE !!!!

  I care more for the impact of this movie on the Indian masses than on any snobby, foppish, pseudointellectual movie cinema aficionados.  It really bothers me not to be hearing anything about the movie's impact in India.

  As a man who very much believes in manly man-ness, I found the ending quite satisfying, not because of the brutality heaped upon the villains, but because of the smallness the macho masculine bullying of women is ultimately exposed to be.  I also found it interesting that the movie told of the ultimate villain turning out wheelchair bound, a position from which he could have learned to show great personal strength:  however, since when do bullies ever show great personal strength (they only feed on the fears and weaknesses of others).
  I didn't expect the ending that finally came about, and I feared the movie would end up with just another depiction of women as stupid victims (what in the world so thrills certain men to see that), a depiction of women so typical in horror movies in America-- as one TV commercial for insurance says, ""Making wrong choices is to be expected in horror movies . . . .""

  If anybody knows, I would love to hear about the effect of this film in India-- particularly after the gang rape and assault incident in a public bus (which, I believe, might also have happened in Mumbai).  How dare they permit themselves such cowardly group bullying of a single woman.  It seems to have re-awakened a lot of men in India (who might once have been mere bystanders, or maybe even exploiters of female vulnerability) to their genuine manhood.  They rose up and demonstrated what the movie called ""public outrage,"" which the perpetrators though would never happen.

  Good for India, and for the storytelling this movie entails.  I hope there were lots of men manly enough to be involved with the making of this film, manly enough to have contributed as well to the concoction of this mythopoetic display of laudable righteous indignation.  It didn't pass me by that Roy (the detectives last name) is also the name of an Indian social and environmental female activist and writer, whose books I read with great pleasure.

  Incidentally, I saw this film on Netflix, and am now buying a couple of copies to share with graduate students in class and friends who might not have Netflix.  So I am a ""verified purchaser,"" just in case any readers might get the notion that I'm somehow connected to the movie in any way other than by my appreciation of it.",1423353600,,3611,4.730769230769231
8679902,3,B00NSHF41W,"There is almost no reason to recommend this flick because there is so little new here. There are just too few surprises.

Here's the scoop. Shivani Roy (Rani Merkerji) is a detective in a special police unit in Mumbai India. Her ""niece"" gets kidnapped and is being sold in a sex trafficking ring. Shivani will pull out all the stops to to rescue her.

First off, this is too much like ""Man on Fire."" But worse is the fact that the police work being done is no way near clever enough to engage a sophisticated audience. Even American TV has been better at this sort of thing. Then there's Shivani Roy herself. She's supposed to be tough, and she does slap a few people around, but she doesn't have the physical presence. Look at Emily Blunt in ""Edge of Tomorrow"" or Jennifer Garner in ""The Kingdom."" These women look like but-kickers. Shivani is too round and soft looking. They show her doing push-ups and chin-ups in one scene but I didn't believe it. And there is little fire in her. She's always so calm and loving it was difficult seeing her rising to the occasion.

The directing is hack level. The action scenes are clumsy and edited poorly. The final hand-to-hand fight scene is a joke. The cinematography showed the locations, but I didn't feel them. In ""Man on Fire"" I felt I was where they wanted me to be. The music score was overbearing and mixed way too loud. It really got on my nerves. But again, one of the worst things in this film is that some of the scenes you've seen before in other movies.

I've seen a handful of Bollywood flicks that were very good. It seems they're trying to get into this crime/action genre of film, but they must not have seen enough of them to know they are walking over old roads and bringing nothing new to the party. I'd give this a pass.",1423008000,,1786,4.403030303030303
