8347168,4,B001W80Z04,Great to be able to find a TV series that has moral values.  Even our 12 year old son is enjoying these.  After each episode we usually are able to have a great discussion about the storyline and message.,1365897600,2,204,4.205128205128205
8347169,4,B001W80Z04,"It is clean entertainment with a spiritual message.  Unfortunately, they deal with controversial issues but do not delineate a clear position.  It is still useful to be shown to a class and then direct the class in coming to a Bible-based postiion.  But it is diaappointing that the producers didn't take any definitive stands. The acting was good but not great.  I like it.  Maybe my expectations were unrealistic.",1363305600,,415,4.956521739130435
8347170,5,B001W80Z04,"I have only seen season 1, but the second is on its way. This show has a little bit of everything, love, purity, Godly messages behind each episode. The show is about these 6 people that work in a theater making christian plays (that the actors write themselves) and it deals with every day struggles, and how these actors react to the problems they encounter- on stage and outside of it.

I love the Christiano films, if you like the others, you will love this show too! I would much rather watch this than anything on TV.

All in all- I highly recommend :)",1346284800,3,558,4.355769230769231
8347171,3,B001W80Z04,"I want to give this 5 stars for the wonderful messages that are packed into each message.  Awesome!!  However, the one thing that bothered me about this dvd set is that the female actresses dress in such tight fitting clothing.  Granted, they don't show much skin, but their clothes are painted on.  They are beautiful girls.  They would look just as beautiful in more modest clothing.  I think that any man or teen boy watching this series will have a hard time concentrating on the wonderful messages of the series because they will be watching the female bodies.  I feel I can say this with great accuracy because I know that my attention was often pulled from the storyline due to the provocative images on the screen.",1312675200,7,722,4.637795275590551
8347172,5,B001W80Z04,"I have been a fan of this TV series since it began.  Very few programs on TV on any network (religious or otherwise) come up to the nature of this series.  The Gospel is regularly presented, as well as Biblical messages of hope and love in Jesus Christ, all through the humor and emotion of an entertaining and welcoming cast.  Season 2 is even better, and season 3 promises to be the most hard-hitting yet.

Most of the episodes are even suitable for use in small group bible studies - as the subject matter begs discussion.",1296518400,5,525,4.4375
