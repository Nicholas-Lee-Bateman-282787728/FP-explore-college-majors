He uses scientific evidence to support his information. You say he believes in some conspiracies as if that's a bad thing... There's many lies out there such as saying we came from a rock billions of years ago.. It's foolish to believe everything we're told without questioning it. This comment is simply misleading information from an evolutionist to make people not listen to Dr. Hovind. [...]
Beware of comments on Dr. Hovinds products. Many people like ""A fan"" keeps rating all of his things only two stars and saying the same thing.",1459728000,,664,4.9375
