Four exercises in gore for gore's sake, all on a single DVD.

CONTENTS:

JACK THE RIPPER GOES WEST-- What in the world is western character actor ""One-eyed"" Jack Elam doing in this stinkeroo? Elam's the mean, grungy, drunken sheriff of Mescal, who teams up with a big-city private eye to solve a string of prostitute murders, all in less than an hour!

LEGACY OF SATAN-- A devil-worshipping cult chooses a nubile babe as their new queen.

THE BRIDE-- Woman takes revenge on her cheating husband and his ex-girlfriend by turning their love nest into a toture chamber.

BLOOD SONG-- A really sick flick. An escaped mental patient's murderous spree ends in the pursuit of a handicapped girl. Yuck. Frankie Avalon as the killer (call this one: ""Blood Blanket Bingo"").

BRENTWOOD's 4-fers are nicely priced movie bundles. Video and sound quality of these digitally unrestored public domain films is generally fine. Discs are dual-side recorded.
