8466292,4,B005D5HG4A,"The video is less than 30 minutes long and takes a humorous look at dinosaurs. I used this video in a 7-8th grade Sunday school cration class.  The students thought the show was very funny and wanted me to get more videos like it.  It may not be PACKED with information, but it says a lot more than that dinosaurs and man were created on the same day. My students enjoyed it, and I thought it was time well spent.",1333324800,,413,4.15
8466293,1,B005D5HG4A,I have been teaching my Sunday School class about dinosaurs in Creation.  This movie is a joke.  It tries to be funny but is SOOOOOO corny that my primary kids didn't even think it was funny. All it teaches is that Dinosaurs were made the same day as man.  The rest is idiocy.  PLEASE don't waste your money.  I sure wish I hadn't.,1325462400,,331,4.190476190476191
