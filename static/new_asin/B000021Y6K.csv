1248970,5,B000021Y6K,"In the cold light of day, the plot of Irving Rapper's immortal classic is absolute tosh. Charlott Vale, a dowdy spinster (Bette Davis) is transformed into a classic beauty, falls in love with a married architect (Paul Henreid), and ends up in an arrangement of doubtful morality where she looks after his daughter Tina Durrance (Janis Wilson) full-time at her house while he goes back to his wife. Love remains unfulfilled, but at least Charlotte has found her mtier in life.

But to criticize this timeless classic, based on Olive Higgins Prouty's best-selling novel, is to overlook the panoply of memorable moments it contains, from Davis's first appearance coming down the staircase in a shapeless dress and glasses, to her showing her ivory carvings - for the first time - to Dr. Jaquith (Claude Rains), her arguments with her bitchy mother (Gladys Cooper), and her tenderness when dealing with equally insecure teenager Tina. Oh, and don't forget the memorable details of her love-affair with Jerry, from the stylish way he lights two cigarettes at once, then passes one on to her; to their night spent alone on a Brazilian mountain; their conversation by moonlight accompanied by Max Steiner's memorable theme; and the film's final line (""Oh, Jerry, don't let's ask for the moon. We have the stars"").

The film shows Davis at her very best as she changes chameleon-like from a put-upon daughter to a socialite with the aid of Orry-Kelly's wonderful costumes. Her hairstyles also change, as do her body- movements; at the film's beginning she clasps and unclasps her hands as she faithfully carries out her mother's wishes while trying to avoid another fit of hysterics. When she meets Jerry (Henreid) for the first time onboard ship, she resembles a wolf in sheep's clothing, as she fingers her fur wrap gingerly, in full knowledge that it does not belong to her. Contrast such hesitation with the confident way she disembarks from the Port of New York to meet her sister-in-law Lisa (Ilka Chase) and niece June (Bonita Granville) and astonishes both of them with her supreme self-possession.

The love-sequences between Davis and Henreid are truly memorable - not so much for their overblown dialogue, but because the two of them are so good at suggesting the passions that have overcome their reason and throw them together at any and every opportunity. Henreid generally played more introverted roles; this was one of the few occasions when he had the chance to let rip emotionally, and he grasps his opportunity with both hands.

The supporting cast of British migrs Rains and Cooper are equally memorable. Rains makes a thoroughly convincing job of the sympathetic psychiatrist, who likes Charlotte even when she breaks all the rules; and Cooper, her hard face staring stonily at her unwanted daughter, comes across as a thoroughly amoral woman who is more than willing to put on an act of feigning illness, so long as she remains the center of attention.

NOW VOYAGER is one of those movies you can watch again and again without tiring of it; its emotional force brings viewers to tears even though it is now over seventy years old.",1469664000,,3144,4.946969696969697

1249003,5,B000021Y6K,"I adore this film. What could have been a tired old ""ugly duckling"" trope with a fairy-tale ending ends up being a bittersweet, complex, but ultimately satisfying tale. While it's certainly a love story between Charlotte and Jerry, it's also a story about a long-abused woman finally gaining self-possession, confidence, and independence. She goes from a Victorian relic to a thoroughly modern powerhouse, and she is able to learn from her personal tragedies and become a good role model to others. It's a daring story for its time, and the cast is perfect. You want to just hug Paul Henreid the whole time, he's so sweet. Bette Davis is at her peak in this film - while she was always a great actress, the wavering she does between strength and vulnerability in this film is especially poignant. Claude Rains is also brilliant as the psychologist who gives Charlotte the gift of her own agency. Although by today's standards it might feel a little dated and overly proper, this film tells a timeless story of coming into one's own, even if they're a late bloomer. Highly, highly recommended.",1392163200,,1092,4.8449197860962565

1249020,5,B000021Y6K,"I love this film and always cringe whenever I google the title of the film and see a description that says it's a ""high grade soap opera"" and ""woman's picture"". In other words, it's a ""chick flick"" and therefore, not as worthy of respect as a ""male-dominated mainstream film."" I am so tired of this sexism. Why is a woman's journey from oppression to self-esteem and respect considered a ""soap opera"" whereas a young man's journey of self-discovery is called ""a classic film"" worthy of viewing by all? If the main character's name had been ""Charles Vale"" instead of Charlotte, it might be required reviewing in all Film 101 classes, like ""Citizen Kane"" is.

""Now Voyager"" is a classic, existential film about a woman who's saved from an oppressive and miserable existence (living with a domineering and soul-crushing mother) thanks to therapy and her own strong character. She recovers her sexuality, finds love with an unhappily married man (a surprisingly compassionate and open-minded portrayal of adultery, with none of the puritanical moralizing of 1940s cinema, and no demonization of her as ""the other woman""), and finally, redemption and purpose in her life by helping someone who suffers from similar issues like herself (her lover's daughter). In the end, she ends up still single but with head unbowed, ready to accept the unconventional life she has with Paul Henreid with no regret (""why ask for the moon? we have the stars"").

I find the ending of this movie incredibly moving. The film is not a downer but one full of optimism - that anyone who's been badly abused and mistreated can recover and thrive, thanks to therapy; that life and love is never necessarily one of happy endings, but is often bittersweet; that helping others is the way to ""pay it forward""; and that women value freedom and independence in relationships just as much as men.

To call it a ""soap opera"" is an insult. I find this one of the most inspiring and moving pictures ever made. It should be required viewing for MEN as well as women!",1373241600,8,2027,4.818965517241379

1249053,5,B000021Y6K,"I had never seen Now, Voyager all the way through and am glad I finally did! Bette Davis definitely deserves her place at the top of the acting pantheon along with fellow actresses Kate & Audrey Hepburn and Ingrid Bergman. Plus, no less than my generation's finest actress, Meryl Streep, is a big Davis fan. What I love about Bette is her absolute fearlessness--she's not afraid to tackle difficult parts--and she makes us believe in her character, no matter how improbable the plot. I do agree with a film critic some years ago that her Charlotte would have been better off with the wonderful Claude Rains' doctor than the rather weak Jerry character. I've also heard that Bette fell for Claude while filming this movie and wanted to have an affair, but he turned her down!

Charlotte says, ""I don't think so, Mother, I'm not afraid.""  She just blurts that out, naturally.  And the instantly realizes what she said, and the significance of it, and repeats it again, in astonishment that she's actually saying it, ""I'm not afraid, Mother!""  It was that at moment that she realized she could actually be her own person, that she wasn't going back to being dominated.

1249067,5,B000021Y6K,"""The untold want by life and land ne'er granted,
  Now, voyager, sail thou forth to seek and find.""

  ~""The Untold Want"" from Walt Whitman's ""Leaves of Grass""

It is perhaps one of Bette Davis' best films, one in which she reputedly became quite caught up in the role, playing an active part in the production decisions. Perhaps that is why the sets, costumes, and screenplay, as well as the flawless acting, raise ""Now, Voyager"" above the soap operatic level to a serious drama exploring the psychological implications of certain moral decisions. Although Bette could be convincing as a Southern Belle, playing New England spinster Charlotte Vale, a Daughter of the Pilgrims, suited her mannerisms and natural accent impeccably. However, it is Bette's ability to depict Charlotte's transformation from a weepy neurotic into a vibrant and enthusiastic life participant that makes the film so engaging.

""Now, Voyager,"" based on the novel by Olive Higgins Prouty, shows the fascination with psychiatry that would come to consume America, beginning in the 1920's, so that in some circles it became a pseudo-religion. When used in the proper context, as a tool for healing, not as a substitute for Divine grace, psychiatry can certainly help people with emotional and mental problems. Charlotte Vale, the heroine of ""Now, Voyager,"" is certainly put back on course by the compassionate Dr. Jaquith, whose firmness, wisdom and tough love counteract the emotional abuse leveled upon her by her mother. The film is, overall, a study in bad parenting and good parenting. Charlotte's healing is completed not by psychotherapy but by nurturing a disturbed child.

That is not to ignore the powerful love story which forms the basis of ""Now, Voyager."" While on a cruise to South America to recuperate from a nervous breakdown, Charlotte meets and falls in love with Jerry (Paul Henreid), an unhappily married man. They decide not to pursue the relationship so as not to break up Jerry's family and traumatize his children. Knowing that Jerry loves her from afar gives Charlotte courage, although the sorrow at not having him in her life intensifies, especially after her mother dies of a heart attack during a quarrel. Overwhelmed by guilt, Charlotte flees to Dr. Jaquith's sanatorium, where instead of having another breakdown, she finds Jerry's young daughter Tina, who is there for treatment. The mothering which Charlotte gives Tina is redemptive for both herself and the girl.

Later, when Charlotte and Jerry are reunited, she insists upon a platonic friendship, for the sake of Tina's fragile psyche. That is when Charlotte says the famous line: ""Oh, Jerry, don't let's ask for the moon... we have the stars."" It is fascinating that in a film which was actually quite worldly for its time, and did not purport to be religious, the needs of children are placed before adult passions. The adults find fulfillment not in seeking their own happiness, but in doing what is right for the youngsters, in spite of the personal sacrifice required. How different from the contemporary pursuit of pleasure in which our society drowns.",1227139200,2,3120,5.101960784313725
1249068,5,B000021Y6K,"I'm a big fan of ""old"" movies, I love this particular movie genre but I was never a fan of Bette Davis, that is, until I watched this film. I've since become an avid fan and collector and I've come to believe she was the finest actress of all time.  Isn't that what's so great about movies; that they often make profound impacts on our lives!  Well this movie made an impact on mine and I hope it does the same for yours.  And if you're looking for the next Davis film - try Watch on the Rhine.  Even hubby liked that one!",1218585600,,522,4.038834951456311
1249069,5,B000021Y6K,Bette plays an ugly spinster aunt who is under the constant hovering of her overbearing mother. She eventually suffers a nervous breakdown and goes off to be treated then takes a trip and meets a man. When she returns nobody can believe her transformation especially her controlling mother.,1195948800,,290,5.0625
1249070,5,B000021Y6K,"This is one of the truly classic Hollywood movies. There is so much that works in this Irving Rapper directed film: the Fred MacLean sets, the Orry-Kelly costumes, the superb score by Max Steiner, the cinematography by Sol Polito (he also filmed all those Warner musicals like ""Golddiggers of 1933"" and ""42nd Street"").

And the cast is marvelous from the stars to the bit players. The film is a modern ugly-duckling-turns-into-a-swan drama with enough of a twist to make it seem the kind of story that could happen today.

Bette Davis is the star, playing Charlotte Vale, the awkward spinster daughter in an extremely rich and Charles Addams-esquely weird band of Boston blue stockings. Gladys Cooper excels as Charlotte's selfish and manipulative mother, Mrs. Henry Windle Vale; she deserves the Golden Broomstick as one of the worst film mothers ever, up there with the conniving sinister Leopoldine Konstantin in ""Notorious"". Even the strongest personality would have a tough time not being psychologically scared by her machinations. Claude Rains is soothing as the wise and kindly Dr. Jaquith (what a contrast to HIS role in ""Notorious""!) and Paul Heinreid is every bit as convincing as complex leading man Jerry Durrance here as he is in his best known role in ""Casablanca"". Juvenile actress Janis Wilson is engaging as Jerry's daughter Tina.

Even so, durable character actress Mary Wickes (best known to younger viewers from her nun role in ""Sister Act"" and as TV's Father Dowling's housekeeper) gets some of the best bits as Nurse Dora Pickford.

The film has many memorable moments, chief among them, Charlotte's first step onto the gangplank and the film's perfect ending line--surely one of the five greatest in all Hollywood history.

1249071,5,B000021Y6K,"Look. I *love* ""Now Voyager.""

I don't love it as a guilty pleasure, or as camp, or as an example of filmmaking from the Golden Age of Hollywood. I don't love it as a soap opera or as example of the long lost genre, the theatrical-release, big budget, ""woman's picture.""

I love ""Now Voyager"" as a movie. ""Now Voyager""'s quality could stand comparison with any great film out there. If I walked into a mainstream release theater today and saw, ""Now Voyager"" I would consider myself as having spent my movie dollars wisely.

""Now Voyager"" is, simply, a great film.

Plot: Charlotte Vale (Bette Davis), the psychologically abused child of a sadistic iceberg of a wealthy, Boston Brahmin mother (Gladys Cooper), thanks to the intervention of a compassionate sister-in-law (Ilka Chase) is packed off to a posh asylum, where Dr. Jaquith (Claude Rains) restores her to well being.

Charlotte loses weight, loses her glasses, and receives tutoring in how to dress and carry herself. Superficially quite the glamor puss, she goes on a cruise and charms Jerry Durrance (Paul Henreid) an unhappily married architect.

Circumstance intervenes and Jerry and Charlotte enjoy a brief affair. As time goes on, they make some heart-wrenching decisions about how to handle their adulterous love; along the way, Charlotte, once an unloved daughter herself, forms an important bond with Tina, Jerry's daughter, whose mother does not love her.

The screen is full of women's bodies, women's voices, women's choices, and women's lives. There are old women -- Mrs. Vale, for example -- middle aged women, and young women. There are good and bad women in every class. For example, while Tina is the sweet but unnattractive and lost young woman, Bonita Granville, as June Vale, is a pretty, blonde, young b----. The scenes in which June, without censure from any quarter, uses her youth and prettiness to torment her pathetic spinster aunt are terrific, honest, and cruel.

The plot is built around the issues of which women's lives are built: their relationships with their mothers, or mother figures, both good and evil; how the world treats women based on how women look -- Charlotte is treated one way when she is unnattractive and quite differently when she learns to master her appearance -- even though she is the same person under the skin; women's competitions with, and support of, other women; what women do to survive economically and emotionally.

The scenes between Charlotte and Tina are stunning in their sensuality. Tina, the daughter-surrogate, and Charlotte, the mother-figure, cling to each other in bed at night, and while sleeping under the stars on a camping trip; Tina sobs tears that wet her face; Charlotte strokes Tina's hair, and Tina clings to Charlotte's bosom.

The simple message here is how incredibly important parenting is in the lives of both children and mothers, and how a person who has suffered -- Charlotte -- can often be a better person than those who have had it easier -- Mrs. Vale and June, and how having been handed a life that denies you love doesn't make it impossible for you to go out and find love on your own, to create your own family.

The scenes between Charlotte and her own mother, Mrs. Henry Windle Vale, are utterly brutal. Mrs. Vale is one of the most naked depictions of a child abusing mother ever committed to the screen. No, there are no graphic scenes of abuse, but the film never lets you believe that this woman is anything but a nightmare who damaged her child for life while the world let her get away with it because of her money.

Again, the abuse is not graphic, but it is made certain. In one brilliant scene, Charlotte has returned to her mother's house after being out in the world and, for the first time in her life, experiencing some affection, joy, and confidence.

Charlotte speaks in her new voice, a voice of self possession. But she is trying to be nice to her mother, and her voice quavers a bit, without losing its ground.

Charlotte is out of camera range; we hear her, but do not see her. Her mother's back is to the camera. She is motionless -- except for her bejeweled, claw-like hand, which taps rhythmically against a carved bed post. One thinks of a cat waiting to pounce. One realizes that all that is going through Mrs. Vale's head is, ""How do I destroy her this time?"" That motion alone renders the scene both chilling and telling.

Charlotte's love affair with Jerry Durrance is equally complex. This is no ""soap opera"" as some reviews here dismiss it as. Viewers are so caught up with Jerry's (Henreid's) trick of lighting two cigarettes at once that they miss the depth, power, and complexity of this relationship.

""Now Voyager"" gives us a terribly convincing portrait of two people who really love each other, and whose love is apparently doomed. Jerry is a superficially charming, nice guy whose unhappy marriage has given him reason to see beneath the surfaces of life; he's no rocket scientist, though, so he's not as smart as he could be. He is attracted to a superficially glamorous woman whose secret past as an ugly duckling and abused child gives her a hidden side. For both, society demands that they present a pleasant facade, but pain has caused them to develop in ways that many people never do. Their love is real.

Jerry is deep enough to be attracted, but not deep enough to realize, as soon as he might, how much his acting on his attraction could pontentially devastate Charlotte, a woman whose hold on her life is tenuous, at best.

Whether their love can ever be realized, or whether it would continue to grow outside of the confines of an adulterous affair begun on a cruise ship and consummated after the most outlandish interventions of fate on a mountain road, is a question viewers can still debate to this day. What is clear is that this love is real, and its stakes are terribly high. Charlotte's whole life hangs in the balance here, no less so than a Scorcese hero's life hangs in the balance given how he handles his weapon.

Oh, for the world where women's lives are taken seriously, and films like this would get their due for the works of art they are, and not jokily dismissed as ""camp.""

Bette Davis is stunning. She *is* Charlotte Vale. Paul Henreid is terrific as the ""nice guy"" with a suave exterior and an interior you'd never guess at if you judged him on his spotless suit and expertly creased fedora.

1249074,4,B000021Y6K,"Let's face it - this 1942 Warner Bros film classic is a hoot. Directed by journeyman studio veteran Irving Rapper, it's an unabashed, only-in-Hollywood soap opera with Bette Davis at the peak of her popularity as she evolves from a distraught, overweight spinster to a glamorous Boston society social maven in about ten minutes. Probably to Tom Cruise's horror, it's also a big valentine to the positive effects of psychoanalysis, a ""new"" science which must have been viewed with a great deal of skepticism at the time. Yet for all its plot contrivances - and there are quite a few - this is ultimately sublime entertainment thanks mainly to the stellar performances and the simple fact that the story is never dull.

The plot focuses on heiress Charlotte Vale, a walking disaster of sheltered neurosis in sensible shoes and a virtual slave to one of the most dominating mothers in screen history. Charlotte's concerned sister-in-law Lisa brings Dr. Jaquith to the Vale mansion where he convinces Charlotte to seek psychiatric treatment at a posh sanitarium. Although still insecure after she leaves on a life-altering pleasure cruise, she finds inevitable romance with architect Jerry Durrance, who of course is married to an unstable woman. Overcome with guilt and breaking an engagement to an available prospect, Charlotte returns to the sanitarium, where she meets troubled young Tina, who of course turns out to be Jerry's daughter. From this ultimate contrivance, plot threads get sewn together in short order, cigarettes lit under the moonlight and Davis coos her big line, ""Don't let's ask for the moon; we have the stars.""

In what amounts to a showcase for her versatility, Davis is superb in both before and after modes, even playing a romantic shipboard teenager with sincerity in a flashback sequence. Paul Henried plays Jerry with requisite Continental charm, but he is truly overmatched by Davis in their scenes together. Claude Rains fares better in the pivotal role of Dr. Jaquith providing his medical advice with convincing paternal authority and genuine warmth. Gladys Cooper - who would play the far warmer mother of Henry Higgins in ""My Fair Lady"" two decades later - portrays Charlotte's iron-willed mother in a sharply uncompromising manner befitting the intimidating stature she holds in the family. Broadway luminary Ilka Chase is fine in one of her few screen appearances as sympathetic Lisa, and Bonita Granville - grown-up since her sinister turn as the rumor-mongering child in  William Wyler's ""These Three"" seven years earlier - plays the bratty niece June with enthusiasm. The print condition on the DVD is excellent, though there are no other extras included.",1122681600,4,2693,5.157894736842105

1249076,5,B000021Y6K,"A great melodrama, a tearjerker about love and sacrifice that grabs you by the throat and won't let go. Bette Davis is Charlotte Vale, a supressed spinster who gets help from her psychiatrist (Claude Rains). Breaking out of her shell, she goes on a voyage to Brazil where she meets Jerry (Paul Henreid), who is married. They fall in love and then must part. Davis later becomes the surrogate mother to Jerry's daughter Tina, who is suffering from a lack of love just as Charlotte did as a girl. In a famous scene at the end, Davis and Henreid reconfirm their love and its continuation through Tina: ""Don't ask for the moon - we have the stars"" Davis tells him. Max Steiner's music score is lush and  designed to make the tears flow even more. At first, when the part about Tina begins, it seems like a tag-on for affect (the scene just before it with Davis on a train pleading for the absent Jerry when she needs him most seems like the logical conclusion to the picture), but it starts to grow on you, thanks to Rains's light touches at the right moments. It's a story of impossible, idealized love and the sacrifices attendant to that love - if it was an opera there'd be a double suicide. But it's moving and touching just the same. Davis was famous for this kind of role, and she is excellent. And Henreid and that famous bit of lighting two cigarettes at once - gotta love it.

  NOW, VOYAGER is full of that thick, gooey stuff of which impossible melodramas are made - the cruel parent, the ugly duckling child who must wrest herself out from under the suffocating maternal wing so she may blossom into a beautiful swan, etc., etc., etc.  Tear-jerking muck is a toxin to my system, and my thumb hung heavy over the `eject' button, ready to zap this one into oblivion.

1249099,5,B000021Y6K,"""Now, Voyager"" is, perhaps, the 'perfect' soap opera, an ""Ugly Duckling"" romantic drama offering full measures of heart and heartbreak, joy and unrequited yet spiritually satisfying love. It is my favorite Bette Davis film, as it exemplifies her classic '40s persona; initially fragile but ready to bloom, she, is, ultimately, a survivor who, facing her destiny, embraces it with courage and confidence.

It's hard to believe that Davis, Warner's biggest female star, had to fight for the role of Charlotte Vale, but Olive Higgins Prouty's best-selling novel was such a strong potential star vehicle that a wide array of actresses, from Irene Dunne to Ginger Rogers, campaigned for the part. Davis was undaunted, however, and after meetings with producer Hal Wallis, succeeded in winning him over, then pressured the studio into borrowing Paul Henreid from RKO, as her leading man. The potent chemistry between the pair is a highlight of the film; who can forget the scenes of his lighting two cigarettes in his mouth, then handing one to Bette?

As brilliant as her performance is (earning her an Oscar nomination), the rest of the cast is equally good. Headed by Oscar nominee Gladys Cooper, as her selfish, dominating mother, and Claude Rains, as the brilliant, yet down-to-earth psychiatrist who turns the frumpy Vale into a radiant beauty, the characters mesh together seamlessly. Two supporting characters deserve special attention; Janis Wilson, as Henreid's love-starved daughter, succeeds as a younger variation of Davis; and young Mary Wickes, great fun as a plain-speaking, wise nurse, unafraid of the Dowager mother.

This is a film to cherish, from director Irving Rapper's masterful use of voice-over 'thoughts' of Vale, to Max Steiner's famous, wildly romantic score.

Ladies, while ""Now, Voyager"" is, unabashedly, a 'Chick Flick', don't be surprised if the guy in your life becomes as big a fan of the film as you...Davis is the kind of heroine EVERYONE can cheer for!",1107907200,5,1984,5.210031347962382

And, of course, those famous lines!

However, NOW VOYAGER is a dramatically different ""woman's picture of the 1940s.""  It is more risque, more senitively acted (especially with its dynamite supporting cast)and carefully written.  It rises above soap opera melodrama and delivers a powerful message about choices we make...especially impressive when the messenger IS a woman of the 1940s.

1249101,5,B000021Y6K,"Starring Bette Davis, Paul Henreid and Claude Rains, ""Now, Voyager"" was for me a strangely liberating experience.  In its time the movie was known as a ""weepie,"" or a ""woman's movie.""  Such has our culture changed, however, that seeing it for the first time now made me, perhaps, see it differently from the way men might have seen it in 1942.  I found myself actively disliking all the men in the movie (and Bette's mother, who is much more like a tyrannical father than a mother) and identifying instead with Bette Davis.  The men in the movie want to take over the woman's voice.  They want to speak her innermost thoughts for her, not understanding how radically wrong they might be.  Paul Henreid, who is magnificent in a role that men in the 1940s and 1950s must have thought was one of an infinitely patient and suffering but noble husband (of another woman in the movie, not Bette), is on current viewing the most extreme kind of villain just because he's so damn smooth.  With sincere ""nobility"" at the end he says to Bette that she should be free to marry ""some man who will make you happy.""  Self-sacrifice on his part?  No, he thinks SHE is the one who will be undergoing self-sacrifice if she doesn't get married!  He says to her, when it is clear that he has made up his mind to go back to his wife and Bette will probably remain a spinster and bring up his daughter, ""No self-respecting man would allow such self-sacrifice as yours to go on indefinitely.""  And I'm sure that male viewers in past decades would think, ""yes, his greatest concern is indeed for her.""  But Bette isn't buying. In the movie she responds, ""That is the most conventional, pretentious, pious speech I ever heard in my life.  I simply don't know you.""

I understand why this unique film has been called one of the greatest, and most unexpected, movies ever to come out of Hollywood. Professor Cavell writes of the films he discusses in his book ""Contesting Tears"":  ""There is surely a sense of sacrifice in this group of films; they solicit our tears.  But is it that the women in them are sacrificing themselves to the sad necessities of a world they are forced to accept?  Or isn't it rather that the women are claiming the right to judge a world as second-rate that enforces this sacrifice; to refuse, transcend, its proposal of second-rate sadness?""",1099872000,7,2342,4.591346153846154

1249104,4,B000021Y6K,"'Now, Voyager' tells the story of hapless introvert Charlotte Vale (Bette Davis), her near-nervous breakdown machinated by her domineering Mother (Gladys Vale) and her subsequent recovery with the help of the dashing J.D. Durrance (Paul Henreid). Directed by Irving Rapper (Another Man's Poison), 'Now, Voyager' is another glorious slice of early forties melodrama, and a total Davis vehicle.
Not that that's a bad thing, actually. Her performance as Charlotte Vale is excellent, she's emotional and deep enough to be believable, and her private exchanges with JD and her Mother are excellent illustrations of the power of Ms. Davis as an actress. Henreid, too, is wonderful as the stiff and faithful JD, stern enough to cause Charlotte frustration yet likeable enough to generate sympathy from the audience.
The supporting cast are a credible bunch - Gladys Vale is an excellent Matriarch (where are the actresses of this calibre today?) and Ivisible Man Claude Rains is hugely charismatic as Dr. Jaquith, a Vermont-based psychologist who all-but saves Charlotte from herself. Comic relief is supplied in the shape of the always-entertaining Mary Wickes (the crotchety nun in the Sister Act movies) as Dora.
Direction is beautiful, with noir-esque interiors and excellent lighting techniques employed to best suggest the sense of Charlotte subsisting in a grim dictatorial household. Rapper's style is a strange contrast to the script, too - it's got a more organic flow about it than the sometimes-stilted dialogue. The score is provided by the genius Max Steiner and is, as one would expect from a man of this legendary reputation, exactly perfect for the tone of the piece.
DVD Quality is excellent, perhaps a little worn in places but on the whole, it's fantastic, and certainly better than a lot of other later DVD conversions. The extras are perfunctory (and indeed, as one reviewer pointed out below, half seem to be missing!) but they don;t make the picture.
On the whole, 'Now, Voyager' is definitely one for the fans. It seems to have established all of the trademark Davis moves (cigarette, EYES, clipped accent, constantly jiggling arm) and is very stilted in some scenes, approaching Camp (see Charlotte's exchanges with the dreadfully annoying Tina Durrance for proof of this!). While it is an endearing and oftentimes emotionally-involving story, one can't help but feel that it will win no new fans to the genre.
Still, if you're fan, you can't go wrong with this.",1076112000,2,2481,5.174129353233831
1249105,5,B000021Y6K,"There's nothing campy about ""Now,Voyager"", style or otherwise. Some people obviously don't understand the difference between classic and camp. This is a wonderful 40's film and one of Bette Davis' most memorable. Based on Olive Higgens Prouty's chronicles of the Bostonion Vale family, it tells of repressed spinster Charlotte Vale breaking free from the mother-from-hell (a marvelous Gladys Cooper) and emerging into an independant modern woman through the help of sympathetic psychiatrist Dr. Jacquith (Claude Rains). When a frustrating relationship with unhappily married Jerry Durrance (Paul Henreid) and the death of her mother (after a heated argument) almost derails her, she finds purpose and meaning in helping Durrance's emotionally disturbed and neglected daughter Tina (Janis Wilson---overacting just a tad). Henreid's cigarette lighting ceremony with Davis became film legend as did the splendid music score by Max Steiner. There's nothing campy about the screenplay by Casey Robinson either. In fact, it offers one of the loveliest lines ever heard on screen. Spoken by Davis, it's the closing line: ""Let's not ask for the moon...we have the stars."" What words could be more perfect while gazing up at a nightime sky with your lover? A top notch cast puts this over in divine style. Both Davis and Cooper were nominated for Oscars. Watch for Mary Wickes as Dora the nurse to Mrs. Vale. And please, don't view this lovely film as camp. It's a true classic and a vintage example of good filmmaking.

1249116,5,B000021Y6K,"What is it about this perennial soap opera which remains such a timeless diversion? While not a perfect film by any means, it nevertheless lingers in the psyche once seen. More than any other character in the film, Janis Wilson seems to be singled out for her rather annoying portrayal of Tina. The most mawkish scenes are those in which she and Davis interact together: i.e. ""This is Jerry's child I have in my arms"" et al. That aspect and the rather forced and unfunny humor from the Argentine cab driver are the film's two major drawbacks. But most of the film is splendid. The script is pretty true to the original Olive Higgins Prouty novel and the film benefits immensely from the inspired performances of Claude Rains and Gladys Cooper. Cooper has a genuine triumph in her playing of a frankly witch-from-hell shrike of a mother who dominates her spinster daughter unmercifully. After the film was released back in 1942 Davis herself received literally hundreds of letters from young women in the same predicament! Claude Rains is his usual brilliant self as the gently mocking, kind and benevolent Jacquith. His scenes with Davis in her bedroom upstairs are real and thought provoking. Ilka Chase is sophisticated but kindly concerned for Charlotte, who in turn appreciates Lisa's ""interference"". But this is Bette's picture ALL the way. From the moment we see her Oxfords coming down those stairs, we know we are in for a tour-de-force Davis performance. Originally Paul Henried's screen test horrified Davis, because his hair was slicked back with hair tonic and he was quite stiff in his acting technique (the producers thinking this was very Continental and European, apparently). Davis saw to it that his both appearance and acting were both more natural and softened somewhat. Cooper had the utmost admiration for Davis and confided that to those who would listen that she was a genius who could have done ""anything"". As June, Charlotte's cheeky neice, Bonita Granville is adequate and attractive. The beautiful score by Max Steiner is one of the most loved (and most famous) done for any picture anytime.

This movie offered Bette Davis every opportunity to display her dramatic range, and she took full advantage of the situation.  As Miss Charlotte Vale, the drab, myopic, overweight, sexually repressed ugly duckling daughter of a domineering Back Bay matriarch, Davis conveys the loneliness, anger and self-pity felt by someone in her situation. While on the verge of a nervous breakdown, Charlotte is rescued by a kindly psychiatrist, one Dr. Jacquith  (the great Claude Rains), who was informed of Charlotte's dilemma by her sophisticated but kind sister-in-law, Lisa.  Later, she is transformed into a swan - by comparison, anyway - who finds independence and defies  her monster of a domineering mother (magnificently played by Gladys Cooper).  A family friend, Renee bowed out of a South American cruise; Charlotte goes in her place.  During the cruise, Charlotte meets Jerry Durrance (Paul Henreid, in a polished, understated performance) an unhappily married man: romance ensues.  I remember watching this as a teen-ager and thought it was unbelievably phoney: it grows on the viewer with each viewing.  Memorable moments are many: Charlotte's bitchy neice (Bonita Granville) commenting on Aunt Charlotte's ravishing ""new"" dress -Mrs. Vale responding to her daughter's cheeky answers after taking her ""cure"" i.e. ""You know perfectly well what I meant. What PERSON sent the flowers?"" - Charlotte's dismissal of her unbearably priggish suitor (the wooden John Loder): ""Let's not linger over it"" -and the sometimes mawkish scenes with the seemingly purposely annoying - and, boy, did she succeed - Tina as played by the obnoxious & unpretty Janis Wilson. And then there's the weinie roast, where brother Lloyd states a that a certain fireplace has never been used: ""High time it was then, Lloyd!"" & upon her introduction to an admirer who jilted her years earlier - on why they ""never met before"": ""Well, the world's a small place, but Boston's a big one"".  A grand movie in every sense of the word, because it belongs entirely to LaDavis, that living acting school whose performances - brilliant as they are - always call attention to them.  That's why she was easy to imitate and ended up imitating herself: she was - for this reason - the quintessential movie actress, a point too many aspiring actors ignore at their peril.  The Max Steiner score, justifiably famous, effective and admired adds a lush background to the emotional turmoil on the screen.

1249120,5,B000021Y6K,"I have tried to concisely write a review several times for this wonderful movie and it always becomes far too long. In the world of Bette Davis movies, this ranks up there in the Excellent category with ""Mr Skeffington"". Perhaps there is something in the presence of Claude Rains? His first moment in the film is him tapping his pipe on one of Mrs Vale's ornate vases. There was something so natural and funny about it somehow that my interest was caught immediately. I don't know why.
Other good moments: The way Bette Davis as Charlotte Vale entered the picture. First there is a shot of her hands carving on a little box; then the butler calls her, and she furtively disposes of a few half-smoked cigarettes before we watch her sensibly shod feet moving down the stairs with slow, deliberate steps. Besides her shoes, all we can see is the hem of a highly unbecoming skirt. And all we can hear is Mother downstairs, speaking to Dr Jaquith about Charlotte.
And after Charlotte's sojourn at the sanitarium (which is neither surrounded by barbed wire nor filled with howling inmates, as Mother had threatened it would be) it is amazing to see the transformation that has taken place in her when you see her on the ship going on a pleasure cruise. Because she has taken the cabin of the relative lady's classy friend Rene Beauchamp, who cancelled her ticket at the last minute, the people on the ship all assume she is Miss Beauchamp, and treat her accordingly. Within five minutes the Man in Charge (who looks curiously similar to the Cowardly Lion) comes up to Charlotte with a man, an Ordinary American Tourist who is travelling alone, and the Man in Charge asks if they would be willing to share a carriage. Remembering her mother's negative attitudes towards Ordinary American Tourists, and Dr Jaquith's advice to mingle with people and get involved in the lives of others, Charlotte smiles and says she would be happy to accompany him. ""Splendid,"" says the Man in Charge. ""Splendid, splendid."" Somehow he sounds curiously similar to the Cowardly Lion as well.
Then in Rio, she and Jerry hire an ""English-spoking"" chauffeur to take them around the countryside. Unfortunately, about the only English this man can spoke is, ""Yes, Senhor, banana-trees!"" And Senhor Banana-Trees leaves the main road for a definitely less-travelled byway which snakes precariously over cliffs and clings to its mother-hill so closely that there is scarcely width enough to drive - much less turn around. I have been on roads such as these, and roads such as these have one other particular characteristic. There is never a guardrail. When they crash into a ditch trying to turn around, Senhor Banana-Trees exits the car first, frantically calling heavenward for help, a-weepin' and a-wailin' over the demise of his car. Jerry and Charlotte come out next, but their efforts to communicate with the dear Senhor are fruitless, and they are left behind to find a place to sleep in some rural Brasilian shack.
I thought Tina was a very sweet little girl, genuinely grateful for all that Charlotte was doing for her, and to see her so happy at the end was very nice. I also thought it was nice that Jerry stayed with his wife like a good husband should rather than divorce her and marry Charlotte. Mother was genuinely vicious - a villain in every sense of the word, her true character masked to the outside world by her social status, civility, and money. And Dr Jaquith was a very nice understanding doctor. Why can't there be characters like this in movies today? Why can't there be ACTORS like this in movies today? Oh well. To use one of the most corny parting shots ever - let's not reach for the moon we have the stars.

 Bette Davis takes on the role of Charlotte Vale, a repressed Back Bay-Boston spinster dominated by her overbearing mother.

1249123,4,B000021Y6K,"Filmmakers know that audiences respond to stories that deal with variations of the Cinderella theme, that beneath the surface of the ugly duckling lies the lovely goose.  Rarely has any movie so graphically charted the evolution of such a metamorphosis better than NOW VOYAGER.  This is really Bette Davis' movie.  She is the dramatic center around which swirls an able cast led by Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, and Gladys Cooper. The moment that Charlotte Vale (Davis) appears on screen as a hopelessly dressed dowdy of a crushed matron, the furtive look in an eye that clearly had the brashness knocked out long ago tells you all you need to know about her dress, her cracking voice, and her punching bag status.  Her mother, played with the arrogant sneer of a harridan black widow by Gladys Cooper, runs her family as much as with her threats to withhold money as with the coldness of her cutting remarks.  Charlotte's sister and niece are not deliberately cruel, but they fail to see the daily humbling of a woman who cries for help with no one to hear. Eventually though, someone does hear.  Claude Rains is the psychiatrist whom Charlotte's sister calls on with the proviso that the mother not reveal his identity.  He meets with Charlotte and can see within moments her distress.  The mother breaks her word by revealing to Charlotte the identity of the doctor who had first been introduced merely as a friend.  One of the most chilling scenes in any film about the gap between a normal maternal love for a child and the perversion that exists within the mother occurs when the matriarch hears the doctor say that Charlotte is nearing a mental collapse.  She blurts out that no one in the VALE family has ever had the temerity to have one.  His reply: 'You are seeing one now.' Charlotte's regeneration begins when she stays at a sanitarium run by the doctor who shows her that she does have a beauty that needs only the right environment to thrive.  And thrive Charlotte does, enough to go on a ship voyage to meet Jerry, an understanding married man with whom she ever so slowly falls in love.  On her return home, her sister and niece are pleasantly surprised to see the radiant confident creature that has blossomed.  The mother is not pleased and cares only to rip away Charlotte's new-found confidence and return her to her former state of despondency.  Charlotte fights back and the scenes in which she asserts her independence resonate with anyone who has a similar parent. But part of her growth of self is not simply for herself. Charlotte meets Jerry's daughter who is now suffering the same trauma that she herself so recently went through.  As Charlotte and Jerry's daughter interact, you can see that in the eyes of this young girl, Charlotte has grown enough to dole out the love that now exists in her own heart to another who needs that love more than anything else. Paul Henreid plays Jerry as a man who loves Charlotte enough to know that their relationship must be a secret.  He rages against a society that frowns on what they have, and if they can't have the moon, they must learn to be satisfied with the stars.
  NOW VOYAGER is pure soap, but its timeless message that love needs to be nurtured both for one's own sake as well as for those who matter is such a clear resonating call that the audience does not care, since learning to care about those on film helps them to care about those in real life too.",1025654400,2,3437,4.623355263157895
1249124,5,B000021Y6K,"NOW VOYAGER is one of Bette Davis' greatest screen vehicles.  It's a tender love story, taut psychological drama and inspiring tale of physical and spiritual transformation.  It runs neck-and-neck with DARK VICTORY as Davis' greatest performance.
Charlotte Vale (Bette Davis) is a lonely and repressed spinster living with her cold and domineering mother (Gladys Cooper).  Her kind sister-in-law (Ilka Chase), fearing that Charlotte is headed for a complete breakdown, sees no other option than to bring Dr Jaquith (Claude Rains) to the house to inspect the situation.  Jaquith takes Charlotte back to his secluded estate Cascades where she recovers.
When Charlotte travels abroad after her discharge, she meets the handsome but very-much married Jerry (Paul Henreid) and embarks on an affair.  Charlotte then returns home alone, but soon finds herself back in Jerry's life when his troubled daughter Tina ends up at Cascades during Charlotte's relapse.  Charlotte helps Tina recover and regain her life, and in turn, Tina helps Charlotte rediscover her romance with Jerry.

Now Voyager paints Davis as the comlpete package; they give her brains and an atitude of self assurance that just won't quit! But for one of the rare times in a film staring Davis. Davis' self assuredness is not the act of inner happiness but inner turmoil. After being denied true love in her younger days by an over protective mother Davis'grows sheltered and has a nervous breakdown only to be nutured by Claude Rains who turns Davis into an opulunet dame of society with a heart of gold or in other words her true self. With her new mindset Davis soon finds her self in love Paul Henreid but their love can not be Henreid is married and has a child who is in the same position Davis once found her self in. This is when the film flies. To see Davis turn in a magnificent portrait of an everyday woman turned mysterious lover is to watch one of the greatest performances on celluloid. The whole look of the film is mesmerizing it looks like a foggy dream as if Davis is still frumpy and unloved but living out a fantasy in her head with handsome men, amazing glamour (thanks to drop dead gowns by O. Kelly)and jewels. The last hour is hearbreaking as Davis turns into the parent that truly loves Henreid's daughter. The one bonds besides Davis' and Henreid's love that intertwines them.

1249137,4,B000021Y6K,"At a time when Hollywood paid more attention to its female audience and made films for them, this may be the best of the bunch.  A padded Bette Davis stars as Charlotte Vale, an overweight, unattractive spinster bullied by the mother who never wanted her.  On the verge of a nervous breakdown, her sister-in-law arranges for her to meet a psychiatrist played by Claude Rains, and after spending time at his ""hospital"", she emerges thinner, beautiful, and more prepared to face the world, a world which include Paul Henreid, a married man that she falls in love with while on a post-recovery cruise.  It's the kind of role an actress must love, and Davis plays it with restraint and class.  Rains is good as usual, and Henreid delivers one of his best performances.  The supporting cast is excellent, with Gladys Cooper pulling out all the stops as the tough mother and Mary Wickes bringing a gentle humour to her role as a nurse.  The musical score by Max Steiner is excellent, and of course, there are the famous moments of Henreid lighting two cigarettes at once, something that wouldn't work in today's movies, but is quite effective in this film.  With it's Ugly Duckling/Cinderella angle and it's sense of romance, this has to be the ultimate woman's picture.  It knows its audience and delivers.",1010188800,11,1301,4.776785714285714

At the beginning of the movie, you see this poor, pathetic girl who lives in her own shell and totally controlled by her mother (GLADYS COOPER as the perfect tyrant mother) and as the story goes along she gains confidence in herself  and she even helps the little girl  of the man she falls in love with (PAUL HENREID) to gain confidence in herself too. What I love about this movie is the fact that it sounds very real and true, it could have been sappy and overdramatic but its not, I was really touched by it and I cried a lot even if Im a guy (macho talk).

1249143,5,B000021Y6K,"I caught this film late one evening when BBC2 was doing a run on black and white classics.  All I can say is ""what a little gem of a movie.""  I am not normally the love story type of person, but this film made me reach for the Kleenex box on more than one occasion.  Bette Davis was superb as the repressed Charlotte Vale living with an overbearing mother, (Gladys Cooper at her nasty best) slowly being driven toward a nervous breakdown.  Enter a kindly psychiatrist Dr Jaquith (Claude Rains)who teaches the unhappy Charlotte that life is for living and sets her off on a voyage of self-discovery.  Charlotte falls in love of course, with the handsome Jerry Durrance (Paul Henreid) but he is unhappily married so all they can have is a gentle love affair that will surely break both their hearts.  However it is Charlotte's love for Jerry that enables her to defy her mother and make a life for herself outside of the family home.  Even though she and Jerry can't be together, Charlotte can help Jerry's trouble daughter Tina who has suffered the same fate as Charlotte, being a child her mother does not want.  There are many memorable scenes, everyone remembers Jerry lighting two cigarettes at the same time and the words ""Don't ask for the moon we have the stars"" but my favorite scene is Charlotte remembering her youth and a rare boat trip with her mother when she falls in love for the first time, and that love is reciprocated.  The young actor (I can't remember his name) who plays that brief love interest bought tears to my eyes, as did the innocent quality of Charlotte's love as her blossoming passion for this young man is crushed beneath her mother's cruel reign.  Now Voyager is one of those films you can watch again and again, and the soundtrack is equally as addictive.  I'm so glad this is film is now on DVD because I have practically worn out my tape watching it so many times.  Worth the Kleenex value alone if you want a real weepie to munch popcorn by.",1005523200,19,1978,4.509803921568627
1249144,5,B000021Y6K,"Well, having been born in the 1960s I can't really say for sure, but I'll bet that ""Now, Voyager"" went a long way towards making therapy more acceptable to the average American in the 1940s. Other 1940s movies dealing with mental illness include ""The Snake Pit"", ""Kings Row"", and ""Spellbound"" , and none of them paint a promising picture--the afflicted folks were shown as really screwed up!
But ""Now, Voyager"" is different. Charlotte Vale (Bette Davis) is having a nervous breakdown after years of her domineering mother's (Gladys Cooper) abuse. After the therapeutic interventions of Dr. Jasquith (pipe-smoking Claude Rains), Charlotte is better able to handle a new life with its many more complications, including a troubled love affair. If that doesn't give you hope, I don't know what else could!
This is one of Bette's most sympathetic roles; she imbues Charlotte with a vulnerability that is quite appealing as she bears her soul to Paul Henreid's Jerry, the married man with whom Charlotte falls in love on her recuperative cruise to South America.  I'll have to make a point to see more of Paul Henried, since he is a highly attractive actor, both physically and in manner. Jerry treats Charlotte with tenderness and any woman in her right or wrong mind would be hard pressed not to fall in love with him. She starts off with him somewhat standoffishly, but what we know that he doesn't is that she is tremendously insecure, even about her borrowed clothing. Then as his own natural kindness comes out, so she responds with gratitude and ultimately love.
One regret I've always had about ""Now, Voyager"", though, is that I've long wished Charlotte might have been united with Dr. Jasquith--but that's my partiality for Claude Rains showing again!

She so dominates the film that one might easily overlook the other wonderful performances.  Claude Rains is marvelous as the urbane, witty, and understanding psychiatrist; and Paul Henreid smolders wonderfully.  Moreover, viewer, please take note of the magnificent, almost overbearing, use of light and shadow in some of the most poignant scenes.  This is movie making at its best in the heyday of great stars and monopolizing studios.  What should become obvious to the viewer in a very short time is that this film moves and moves quickly.  Emotions are tossed back and forth as quickly as ping-pong balls in a lottery bubble.  It is the dialogue, however, that makes this film move.

Movies like this just aren't made anymore. Today this would star Julia Roberts and Kevin Costner and end in a happy mush. A true woman like Bette Davis knows what it's like to love and sacrifice.

It is an ""ugly duckling"" to ""beautiful swan"" tale--hardly a cutting edge  concept--but it works impressively here. Charlotte Vale (Bette Davis) seems  doomed to a life of dull spinsterhood under the thumb of her domineering  mother, the outstanding Gladys Cooper.  But a kindly psychiatrist comes  along (Claude Rains) who sees potential worth tapping under nervous  Charlotte's dumpy exterior.  And the transformation is filmed  superbly;Bette Davis never looked more glamorous.  The first shot of the  ""new"" Charlotte--now traveling under an assumed name on a cruise  ship--as she makes her entrance is a moment of monumental film making.  Aboard the cruise, Charlotte meets and falls in love with a married man  (Paul Henried), and she manages to stay connected to him through his  troubled daughter that she finds and helps at Cascade, the very institution  that helped bring forth the new Charlotte Vale.  There are moments of joy,  moments of humor, moments of sadness in this movie.  Max Steiner's score is  top notch, and Orry-Kelly's costumes could not be better. This film has  frequently been singled out as perhaps the best representation of the  trends in moviemaking in the 1940's.

1249161,4,B000021Y6K,"This is pure Bette Davis soap opera and one of her best. Bette's performance of Charlotte Vale is not as bitchy as her usual characterizations, but here she is allowed to go from ugly duckling to  glorious swan. And we do mean *really ugly.* Get aload of Bette's fake  eyebrows early in the film, designed to make her as ugly as Leonid  Breshnev. The device succeeds.
Davis' palpable onscreen chemistry with  Paul Henreid enhances the movie, which sometimes bogs down towards the  last. Many of the scenes with Jerry's daughter in Vermont are  superfluous.
All Bette Davis fans will love this film, and those who have  not appreciated Bette in the past will learn to love her in this role.
