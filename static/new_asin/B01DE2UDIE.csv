7711713,3,B01DE2UDIE,"This was a real unique take on the terms of what happens when long term dating affects us all, and when changes occur in our lives with the main character trying to deal with her father's death, and the changes happening in her professional and personal life. The film had a slow pace in the beginning with a lot of filler in between, but it ultimately got to it's destination once we are introduced to the main character's love interest and how it helps move her along in her season of change.

Love is something that many people wonder about and it is a challenging thing to understand, but Melan did his thing in trying to express how this affects people and the change it envelops when we try to move forward in our lives.",1481500800,,726,4.377777777777778

7711722,4,B01DE2UDIE,"I really enjoyed this film. It was an entertaining look at dating. This is a great date movie for couples. Mature adults should not date for years. That is ridiculous. Mature adults date for a year or less and then get married. Should any woman remain in a relationship with a man who refuses to propose?? The script made this film for me. The lead actors all performed well. I especially liked Denny and her new boyfriend. They really had chemistry. This is a mature, family film. Highly recommended.",1474761600,2,501,4.640449438202247
7711723,1,B01DE2UDIE,A very low budget film....couldn't connect with the characters.,1474588800,,63,6.111111111111111
7711724,3,B01DE2UDIE,It was okay. Not the best acting job but very predictable .,1473984000,,59,4.0

7711727,3,B01DE2UDIE,It was an okay movie. The movie had good looking actors playing non-believable roles.,1473897600,,85,5.142857142857143
7711728,3,B01DE2UDIE,Typical storyline.,1473724800,,18,8.5
7711729,1,B01DE2UDIE,"The story line was all over the place. The acting was atrocious. The soundtrack was horrible. So many things gone wrong here, for instance, giving CPR to a patient while she was propped up on pillows in a birthing bed, really? Was the married friend pregnant by her husband or her co-worker? Hell, I don't know, do you? Where were they going with the white woman who approached the Chicago boyfriend aggressively while the friend with the ex-boyfriend was visiting in D.C.? This movie was AWFUL. Bachlorette's Degree is the title, but it has nothing to do with the characters' situations, and for damned sure no one got any higher learning from what they've been through. Don't waste your time with this crap. Did I mention that it was AWFUL???",1473465600,4,744,4.730769230769231
7711730,5,B01DE2UDIE,Loved it!!,1473206400,,10,4.5
7711731,5,B01DE2UDIE,Enjoy the movie very much. It was funny and it had real life situations in it. Shows how emotions and things can change in time.,1473033600,,128,4.16

7711733,1,B01DE2UDIE,The characters don't make sense the story line seems to be all over the place. I'm not even sure how it got an overall 3.5 rating. The acting is beyond trash. The microphone is showing in one scene. The over acting to try to make something funny didn't pay off. The voices are horrible & the title of the movie has nothing at all to do with the movie. It is pointless watch full of nothing leading to nothing.,1472688000,3,409,4.189873417721519
7711734,1,B01DE2UDIE,Horrible acting,1472428800,,15,7.0
7711735,3,B01DE2UDIE,"Just an OK movie. The guy with the Barry White voice was a bit much, but I did want to see what was to become of the main character and her choice of men.",1472169600,,154,3.5588235294117645
7711736,4,B01DE2UDIE,"I enjoyed watching this movie Bachelorette's Degree. As I first started watching the movie I thought it was going to be just like some of the other movies I used to watch, but as the movie continued on I really found myself loving the story line.
Great job to the writer, producer, actors and actresses!",1472083200,,303,4.527272727272727

7711745,1,B01DE2UDIE,I love B-rated movies but unfortunately I was unable to last longer than 10 minutes. The lighting was terrible and it was a lot going on without a clear plot.,1470009600,,158,4.3
7711746,1,B01DE2UDIE,This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my black ass life.,1469750400,,71,3.5
7711747,2,B01DE2UDIE,"I wanted to really like it but they made it hard. Only a few characters were fully developed, it seems like the main character is getting played throughout the film, and it left me feeling as though the story wasn't complete. Also, how did we go from a newborn to a 2 year old in a matter of months? If you watch the entire movie you'll understand what I'm asking.",1469664000,,364,4.214285714285714

7711754,4,B01DE2UDIE,"not ""the other side of the story"" nor about bachelorettes, degreed or otherwise, albeit consistent with the heavy doses of religiosity included.  I'd never heard of cardiac arrest following childbirth.  But it was a nice story, well presented by the players, director, and photographers, worthy of a four star rating.",1467763200,,317,5.32

7711757,2,B01DE2UDIE,Homophobia in the first ten minutes of the film. I had to stop watching. The gay character was stereotypical and used as an excuse to explore why the lead character was single. Please do better.,1467417600,,194,4.571428571428571

8755621,3,B01DE2UDIE,"I'm all for black films and movies that explore the lives of young people sifting through love and marriage. The acting was believable for the most part. It wasn't a great movie, but it was okay.",1513382400,,195,4.444444444444445
8755622,1,B01DE2UDIE,"Barely got pass the trailer. Who writes these movies where they throw God in it for 30 seconds as if the characters are living a godly lifestyle? What blasphemous mockery. If you want to make a movie about fornication make a movie about fornication but don't have a part where someone is saying ""oh just pray about it and God will handle it"" You sleeping around outside of marriage!!! That's irresponsible spiritually first of all and God can't hear your prayers if you are unrepentant. They lost me with that foolishness. Be hot or cold but miss me with these lukewarm messages.",1501200000,,579,4.686274509803922

8755625,1,B01DE2UDIE,"Where do I start?  From the awful forced acting, to the funky 70s porno music playing in the background it just doesn't fit.  The movie's plot is all over the place.  Lighting is dreadful. I've seen better acting in high school plays. Save your time and watch something else. Anything else.",1494979200,,290,4.647058823529412

she had the baby. all i could say was ""oh no"". the 2nd cough i said nooooo!!!! that was
so unexpected and yet a good twist to her character. i cried with them too. my oldest
daughter of 2 is having a child and she is 2.5mo and this scared me so bad and hurt at the
same time. im glad Dennie went back to where her heart would be happy and that was the
perfect ending.",1485734400,,452,3.978021978021978
