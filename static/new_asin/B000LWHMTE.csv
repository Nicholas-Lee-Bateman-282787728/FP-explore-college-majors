8164728,4,B000LWHMTE,"I have reviewed several of these Golden Book videos and so this review might sound a lot like others of mine.  I love these sweet, classic stories - though the animation isn't state of the art - they are wonderful.  My grandkids are used to all the cable stations, so these really couldn't get interested in them.  I like them because I think kids are overstimulated these days and that all the good cartoons and tv is gone.  Almost all you can find on ""kid channels"" is princesses, super powers, magic and mystick junk, no values, kids with attitude problems toward their parents (because all parents on those shows are painted as lame and the kids roll their eyes at them), or whatever.  Who doesn't love the classic books ""Peter Rabbit,"" the Pokey Little Puppy, The Little Red Hen, etc?  These are wonderful stories that teach values and that had stood the test of time.  My favorite story on this particular video is ""Polly's Pet."" But they're all great.

We had planned to convert to DVD because.... VHS?....No can do VHS.

Each of the Little Golden Book Videos has 3 classic stories.  This one has Peter Rabbit, The Little Red Hen, and Polly's Pet.  All three are great stories.  My kids loved these growing up.  I'm 55.  I guess I'm way behind the times, but I just think good classics never go out of style.",1439942400,,1315,4.540425531914893
