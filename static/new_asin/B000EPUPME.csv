8112595,5,B000EPUPME,"I gave this 1 star because in the description it did not say that it was for Region 2 only.  Our Region is 1.  And because its not the correct Region we can not review this VHS.  I love Rowan Atkinson and sure it would of been excellent.  I was able to get a refund right away because when they viewed the description they to saw it was not rated a Region number.

After rating this product I discovered I had the wrong product.  This VHS is viewable in USA and is so funny.  So for inexpensive entertainment and a great laugh, do purchase this product.  So sorry for the mix up.",1434499200,,579,4.107142857142857
