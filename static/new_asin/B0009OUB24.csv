8064375,4,B0009OUB24,"The little ones seem to enjoy it.  Several different stories.  Nice color.  As an adult, it drives me crazy, but it makes the kids happy and that's what matters.",1362528000,,161,4.482758620689655
8064376,5,B0009OUB24,"I am so sad that Disney no longer makes Higgleytown Heroes or JoJo's Circus- both were such fun, imaginative shows.  The pre-k shows on Playhouse Disney are not as good as they used to be.  (We still love Handy Manny though!)

This DVD has 2 Christmas themed episodes from both JoJo and Higgleytown, and they are brilliant!  My son who is almost 4 is in love with them.  They are well done and have catchy original Christmas songs. This DVD is now part of our Christmas movie line-up that we MUST watch every year.  Totally worth the price.  As for the other shows on the DVD- we don't even bother with them.

If you are unfamiliar with Higgleytown Hereos, I suggest you get the the 2 remaining DVDs for your children (*ALL* episodes are available on itunes)- the characters are fun and the songs are great, and the animation looks nice, not at all cheap.",1292716800,,855,4.470967741935484
8064377,4,B0009OUB24,"I purchased this DVD for my 19 month old daughter a few weeks before Christmas.  It was a huge it and she's still requesting it now, 3 weeks after Christmas.  This DVD was a little pricey but totally worth it.  The story lines are sweet and the songs are very original.  A warning though...  They are likely to get stuck in your head and you will be singing them at work for days.  :o)  The only reason I did not give this item 5 stars is because there are two short movie clips in between JoJo and Higgly Town that do not hold my daughter's interest for very long.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend though.  JoJo is a new favorite in our house now.",1231632000,,662,4.149606299212598
8064378,1,B0009OUB24,"My children love this video. However, I will not let them watch it. I was very upset with the Higglytown Heroes episode. Twinkle sings about Christmas and that you can't have Christmas without your family around you. I caution all military families to not buy this video. It is hard enough to have to spend holidays without family members without having a cartoon sing about how miserable you are.",1209513600,2,397,4.768115942028985
8064379,5,B0009OUB24,"This movie is precious! I have 2 boys ages 3 and 5 and this is the second Christmas season they have watched it and they love it! It really will get you into the holiday spirit. The Jo Jo's Circus story is a nice reminder of giving during the holidays, and putting other's first. The Higglytown Hero's story has lots of snow and shows what goes on at the North Pole. The 2 songs Twinkle sings are really just beautiful. It also teaches that being with loved one's is the nicest part of Christmas. There are 2 Shanna's Show shorts, one about a ballerina, and the other about a postal worker. So these aren't exactly about Christmas, the rest of the movie sure is!",1165449600,3,662,4.346774193548387
8064380,2,B0009OUB24,"I knew this dvd would not be worth the price, but I was lured in by my 2 yr olds love of the Higglytown Heroes and JoJo.  There are only two actual episodes on the dvd, one Higglytown and one JoJo's Circus.  Then there are a couple other shorts that have no holiday theme whatsoever.  We have another Playhouse Disney holiday vhs from a few years ago and it was the same thing, one holiday episode and the rest not holiday at all.  While my kids and I love Playhouse Disney, you would be much better off recording the shows yourself.",1136678400,26,533,4.247524752475248
