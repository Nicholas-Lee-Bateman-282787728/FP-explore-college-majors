7952995,3,B00005RYLG,This was a rental and it was okay.  Not one of those movies that you want to watch more than once.,1394236800,,98,3.6666666666666665
7952996,1,B00005RYLG,"Thanks to Netflix(which for some reason keeps offering garbage)I saw this snoozefest,all the shock,schlock and violence couldn't keep my attention on it. The Killer is some blondefairy looking dude who looks more like an spoiled brat than some Violent sociopath,Only the Police and the beautiful yet kind of old and not in a cougar-y way gets the movie passing along. The car chase is semi-exciting,although Alfa-Romeo's are not exiciting cars;I've seen better Italian Cinema.",1343865600,,476,5.445945945945946
7952997,1,B00005RYLG,"""Beast With a Gun"" (also released as ""Mad Dog"", among numerous other titles) is a repulsive example of Italian cinema at its worst. This film stars the genuinely creepy Helmut Berger as ""Mad Dog,"" a career criminal who enjoys murder and mayhem just a little too much. He and some henchmen escape from prison and seek revenge on those who put him behind bars.

His chief foe is Police Inspector Santini whose own father (the judge who, coincidentally, sentenced Mad Dog) and sister eventually become hostages. The resulting hand-to-hand fight scene, which concludes the movie, is both bloody and gratuitous.

Technically the film is directed and photographed fairly well (excepting the credit sequence and some arty shots so popular in Italian cinema of the period), and the acting of the principals is above average for the genre. One interesting problem was in keeping the action in the final fight scene straight, as the director for some reason chose to dress both Mad Dog and the Not-So-Great-Santini nearly identically, which made for several confusing moments (or maybe I was just bored).

While I have seen many more poorly crafted films, the utter lack of morality and needless violence, especially toward women, made this painful to endure, and totally worthy of a single star.",1200182400,,1286,5.056603773584905

7952999,4,B00005RYLG,"He's mean! He's nasty! He's armed and extremely dangerous! His name is Nanni Vitali (Helmut Berger) and he's a one man death squad! Boiling over w/ revenge and bitterness over his time in prison, Nanni sets out to capture and destroy those who dared to convict and incarcerate him. Can he be stopped before he carries out his evil plan? Well, sort of. You see, Nanni is absolutely crazy and fearless. So, anyone in his way will be raped, murdered, or both. Watch this one long after the kids have gone to bed! Yikes!...",1147132800,3,519,4.531914893617022
7953000,5,B00005RYLG,"Helmut Berger plays a violent escaped convict out for sex and revenge.  He gets plenty of both in this stylish, fast-paced thriller.  Sure, the dubbing is fractured and flawed but it just adds to this movie's fun flamboyance!  I would love to have seen this in a 42nd street grindhouse theater back in the day.  They don't make tough, manly movies with fierce, rugged characters like this anymore...",1042761600,4,399,4.823529411764706
7953001,4,B00005RYLG,"Fast-paced Italian crime flick delivers the goods.  Psychopaths, guns, violence, cops, and naked womenserved up Italian exploitation style.  You couldn't ask for more. This movie is playing on a tv in a scene in Jackie Brown.",1039996800,4,225,5.222222222222222
