1011366,1,6305282218,"This is one of my favorite Argento movies, but a horrible blu-ray transfer.  Maybe the worst I've seen so far.  I popped in my special edition DVD just to make sure it wasn't my imagination, and the DVD looks fantastic.  I'm all for maintaining film grain, but based on a comparison with the DVD, it looks like the blu-ray artificially manufactured it (maybe it has something to do with going back to the original negative).  So if you have the Blue Underground 2-Disc Special Edition DVD, don't waste your money like I did.  Just stick with the DVD.  And if you don't have the DVD, I highly recommend it (if you're into Italian horror movies, that is...or Thomas Kretschmann).",1283299200,5,677,4.647058823529412
1011367,2,6305282218,"Argento peaked with ""Susperia"", but this film is still worth looking at, even if it's only for the first half.

One major question is why Argento kept casting his daughter in his later films? Maybe he thinks she is a brilliant actress. Maybe he enjoys filming her in the shower and being raped. Maybe (and this is my personal theory) he doesn't have to pay her as much. Whatever the reason, Asia is unconvincing in this role, and had a stronger actress been cast, the film might have held together better.

Asia is Anna, a police officer from Rome. Right off the bat there's a problem with this. Since it's unlikely Roman police academies recruit out of middle schools, Asia is way, way to young for this role. But, bless her heart, she does give the part her all and creates a likable, sympathetic character out of Anna. Anna is in Florence following up on a lead in a serial rapist case. While in the Uffuzi Gallery she is overcome with intense sensations and hallucinations known as Stendhal Syndrome, and Asia does do a good job in getting us to believe she is disoriented and amnesiatic for a time. She's then brutally raped by her quarry, returns to Rome for counseling, and then kidnapped and raped again by the monster Alfredo. Here is where Argento had a chance to really give the plot some meat, since Alfredo has fallen in a perverse sort of love with Anna, and exploring their relationship would have been interesting.

So....Anna escapes and we think it's the end, right? Uh, no. The movie proceeds to drag on while Anna starts wearing a blonde wig, dates a cute French research assistant and believes herself to be pursued by the presumed dead Alfredo. By the time we get to the pretty good finale, the movie has lost so much momentum that it's hard to work up any suspense anymore.

Still, there are some wonderful trademark Argento shots and angles that are worth watching. Otherwise, the story was too complex for Argento and so it falls flat. Asia tried to make a strong character out of Anna but she was too young and too inexperienced at the time to do so. Alfredo was played wonderfully and while he's on-screen is very scary. This film had so much potential.",1275436800,3,2180,4.582051282051282

Watching it on this disk was like seeing the film for the first time (not to mention how good it sounded).  I came here expecting to see praises for the release, but instead I mainly see complaints about how grainy it looked.

I couldn't remember seeing any excessive grain, so I put the disk in again and still didn't see any problems.  It was only when I moved 5 feet closer to the TV where I could see some grain, but even then it wasn't much and hardly enough to make the film unwatchable.  I read online that part of this grain problem might be from people having the sharpness turned up on their TVs.  Maybe someone who has complained about the gran could perhaps check this on their TV and see if the disk looks better with this turned off?

As long as Blue Underground continue to put out these high quality releases, I'll continue to double dip.  I would recommend for anyone who is scared off by the reported problems to at least rent the disk and decide for themselves.",1245801600,5,1123,4.41747572815534

1011373,4,6305282218,"This flick is not my favorite argento movie but that being said it's still a good movie.  This is more of a psychological thriller and that may not please some argento fans who want a straight forward giallo or murder mystery.  Asia argento is a excellent actress and she carries this movie as well.  The blu ray edition is a better edition than the standard one however the blu ray process really brings out the grainy style of filming.  The ""evil dead 2"" also is this grainy and it leads to a sparkle like effect that is only slightly distracting in some scenes.  Perhaps on future blu ray releases the producers can tone down the grain if a movie utilized it as a technique in filming.  Personally I have never been a fan of grainy filming it's not artistic it's just grainy.  But the picture is crystal clear and the movie has never looked better so it's a proud addition  to my horror collection.  If you enjoy murder mysteries with a psycholical theme you may enjoy this movie but if you want a straight forward murder mystery you might be more happy with 'the bird with the crystal plumage"" blu ray instead.",1236470400,2,1114,4.475247524752476

""The Stendhal Syndrome"" is a dark, brilliant, unnerving, and beautiful excursion into the mind of a policewoman who is brutally assaulted.  Clearly, this is one of Dario Argento's masterworks, aided by a haunting score by the talented Ennio Morricone.

Asia Argento, who plays the heroine, becomes unhinged by her violation.  She was not a well woman to begin with, suffering fom a syndrome named after the writer Stendhal that causes her to faint when she views certain works of art that overwhelm her.  Her sexual victimization pushes her over the brink of madness, and what ensues is sheer terror.  She experiences difficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality.  Her psychological predicament becomes all the more heinous when reality, in the guise of her assailant who continues to stalk her, becomes more horrifying than the chimeras conjured by her overheated imagination.

In its depiction of a woman's descent into madness, this film reminds me of Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion,"" but Dario Argento's film is richer and fuller, whereas Polanski's is claustrophobic.  ""The Stendhal Syndrome"" is Argento at the top of his game.

1011380,4,6305282218,"On watching the first half of this film you'd be forgiven for thinking it's one of those grisly 'rape n' murder' horrors we get all the time nowadays - except for the occasional dream sequence thrown in (sometimes done well but there is some pointless cgi here)
I was shocked by some of the films content as I'm more used to his earlier work (daft slashers with great art direction) and hadn't seen anything by Argento post-'terror at the opera'. However, It was worth sitting through

What struck me the most was how moving I found the second half of this film. You really care for the characters - even the seemingly insignificant support characters - and at the films climax (although totally predictable) I actually weeped like a little girl

That could just be me though

But seriously, Argento has actually gone up in my estimation - There are some truly original moments and themes explored that you won't get in any other genre horror movie - this is a surreal psycological thriller more than anything. Perhaps not as enjoyable as Suspira, Tenebrae or Profondo Rosso - but definitly worth a look if you want to see a different side to Argento's work",1207008000,2,1157,4.661764705882353
1011381,1,6305282218,"The Troma release is horrible, do not buy it. If you want a good release of this film, buy the Blue Undergroud disc...it is more than worth the extra money.

The picture and audio quality on the Troma disc is terrible, and the introduction by Lloyd Kaufman is one of the most annoying things I've ever seen. It's a shame that Troma ever got their hands on such a great film.",1205625600,,374,4.267605633802817
1011382,4,6305282218,"When it came to the 90s a lot of horror filmmakers who had their rise to fame in the 70s and 80s were for some reason unable to make the transition into the 90s. In general most filmmakers don't get better with age they get worse. Of course there are always exceptions. I believe Dario Argento was one of the exceptions, well sort of. I think the 90s started off well for him, Trauma was a much underrated movie in my opinion. While you can see he was starting to lose it just a bit, he still made a solid movie.

The Stendhal Syndrome continues that; it's a movie by a director who reached greatness and is still hanging on to that. This is one of those movies that really stands-out in Argento's career; for starters The Stendhal Syndrome is a lot darker than his previous movies. It has more in common with a 70s exploitation flick than it does what Argento is known for. Like I said The Stendhal Syndrome is a lot darker than Argento's past movies and even at times feels a lot more real. Dario Argento was a filmmaker who really knew how to create a sense of dread and doom and while it doesn't always work here for the most part it has that feel through out.

The Stendhal Syndrome as I stated really does stand-out; at times it's almost like a different filmmaker and that is actually a very good thing. Argento strays from his formula of past movies and makes a very solid and in my opinion a much underrated movie in his brilliant career. While he does stray in parts there are also flashes of what made Dario Argento one of the most Iconic horror filmmakers of all time. The Stendhal Syndrome is labeled a Giallo and while it does have those elements it strays from the typical conventions of what a Giallo is.

The screenplay by Dario Argento was overall rather solid. A lot of people tend to forget that he is actually a good writer. If you go back and view his early work such as The Bird with the Crystal Plumage and Deep Red they were very well written and while the only weakness in Argento as a filmmaker could possibly be seen as a writer he did manage to write some solid scripts. But really starting with Suspiria his scripts did start to lack. That isn't to say they were badly written, but they often lacked logic and it was Dario Argento the director that made those movies he did starting with Suspiria such brilliant horror movies.

Unlike some of his past movies, The Stendhal Syndrome is very character driven. While there are some murder scenes and some being very graphic the movie relies more on character moments rather than action and I think it was done rather well. Argento sort of took elements from his past movies, but mixed them up. By this time in his career I think that had to be done. He could have played it safe and done the typical Giallo, but I think that would have hurt the movie and suffered from the, been there, done that. In most Giallos it's about the murders and the investigation. But here in The Stendhal Syndrome the murders and investigation take a backseat and the primary focus is on Anna Manni played by Asia Argento.

Again even though I do think early in his career Argento was an excellent writer and than became a good writer his movies weren't really known for their characters. While he did create some interesting characters over his career when talking about his movies the characters often come last. But The Stendhal Syndrome is one movie where you'll probably mention the character of Anna Manni first.

On the visual side you know what to expect, while it's not Suspiria or Inferno, the movie still looks quite good from a visual side, but Argento seemed to tone down his normal style, which in this case I believe was a good thing. Argento just might be the best visual director to ever grace the silver screen. But in a movie like this I think Argento's visual style could possibly take away, so it was a wise move to downplay it. But there are many great visual moments; it's a Dario Argento film, but visually the movie is good, but it wasn't a movie to show off his visual style.

Don't go into The Stendhal Syndrome expecting the typical Argento movie; like I said this is quite different. There are a couple of murders, but they aren't the main star of the movie and actually there can be long stretches without one. The Stendhal Syndrome does move slowly in some areas, but I don't think it ever gets boring. I always say there is more to filmmaking than just story-telling. This is hard to explain without making Argento sound bad, but in general his movies weren't about story-telling at least as his career went on. But this time around he goes back to that and tells a story of Anna Manni who goes through some pretty horrific events and goes through this mental breakdown. It's all handled quite well and very believable.

Any fan of Italian horror knows that often enough the movies can sometimes be incoherent or slightly incoherent. Sometimes something will happen without an explanation or a plot twist that doesn't really seem to make a whole lot of sense. In the case of Argento, his movies can often be seen as a nightmare and I suppose it makes sense when things don't make sense. But The Stendhal Syndrome is very coherent and is as much a drama as it is a horror movie. The Stendhal Syndrome proves again Dario Argento can not only write, but tell a story.

The cast is pretty good led by Asia Argento. Most complaints is she looks to young to be a detective, while I guess that is true, I loved Asia in this movie and the way her character transforms from the first half of the movie to what she becomes in the 2nd half was believable and she does an excellent job at playing both. I just adore Asia Argento and despite some complaints I thought she was simply amazing. Thomas Kretschmann is pretty good as Alfredo Grossi the villain, but the movie wasn't really about him. I would have liked to have seen him have a little more screen time, but he does well in his role, which is quite pivotal to Asia's character. Marco Leonardi as Marco Longhi also delivers a good performance. All the cast members were pretty good actually and is probably one of the better acted movies done by Argento.

I also enjoyed how the movie changes in the 2nd half. It's sort of like 2 movies for the price of 1. The 2nd half the movie changes focus, but it doesn't feel out of place it actually works quite well. A lot of times when a movie changes focus in the 2nd half it barley works, but to Argento's credit he is able to mix it up and make everything work and work very well. The first half and the 2nd half both fit together, but the focus does change a bit.

In closing, The Stendhal Syndrome isn't a perfect movie there are some elements that come across as slightly silly, but as a whole the movie works very well and in my opinion this movie is much underrated by Argento fans. It was a slight change of pace and works well. After this though things would mostly go downhill for Dario Argento, but The Stendhal Syndrome, while not the best work in his career can stand proud next to his brilliant body of work.

Interestingly enough, 2004's The Card Player was originally meant to be a sequel, but when Asia Argento wasn't available it became its own movie. The lead character in The Card Player is named Anna Mari rather than Manni. Not sure how it would have worked, but interesting.",1202688000,7,7374,4.433948339483395
1011383,5,6305282218,"Lovely female police detective Anna Manni (Asia Argento) was having a fine day at the museum at some city in Italy, until she started getting weird hallucinations called ""Stendhal Syndrome"" which causes bizarre images when she sees works of art. She does go after a serial killer that goes around raping and murdering people, Anna must know more of the killer's instincts and moves if her Stendhal Syndrome doesn't get in the way.

Very artsy and gory psychological horror fantasy thriller from Italy's greatest horror master Dario Argento offers surreal imagery, gory violence especially the realistic razorblade to the lip sequence that will make you cringe, and a creepy score by Ennio Morricone. Dario's daughter Asia is truly gorgeous in this picture as the detective, the film does have scares and good focus on characterizations.

Watching this gorgeous new transfer and hearing it in dts, then comparing it to the previous release, I understood completely. This is one of Dario Argento's most divisive films, and I'll admit that for a long time, I didn't fully understand or appreciate it. The supplemental disc in this release, which includes an interview with the psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who wrote the book upon which the film is based and who consulted on the film, made everything perfectly clear for me. Her explanations of the syndrome and its effects helped me to understand what Anna does and why. It really was like watching a new film for me. Of course she'd do that, I thought. I was also pleased to see the film restored to its original running time.

1011437,4,6305282218,"Asia Argento is a cop on the trail of a rapist/serial killer who she follows from Rome to Florence.  Once in Florence she falls victim to the Stendhal Syndrome, a supposedly real psychological condition(it's described in detail on the second disc) that causes people to feel ill, become disoriented, hallucinate, faint or lose touch with reality when exposed to certain pieces of artwork or architecture.  While this condition may indeed exist, I doubt anybody experiences it to quite the degree Asia does in this film, as she is able to literally(in her mind) step into a painting and immerse herself in the environment the painting depicts.  These scenes showcase Dario's flair for visuals.  So, it's bad enough that she's got this Stendhal stuff to deal with, but at the same time, the killer has targeted her.  Like the killer in Argento's Opera, he becomes smitten with Asia, and isn't so much interested in killing her as he is taking her for his own perversions whenever he feels like it.  This sets off a series of events that leads Asia through a nightmarish adventure.  To give away more of the plot is to give away some of the twists.  This movie is kinda split amongst the Argento fanbase, with some on one side saying he'd lost his way and others saying it's one of the most underrated and misunderstood movies of his career.  Of course you'll have to see it for yourself to be the judge of where you stand.  Personally, I found it very enjoyable and disturbing.  Only two things really bugged me about it and they're not too big.  First off, the movie does drag a bit near the halfway mark more than it should.  Second, it's hard to build alot of sympathy for Asia's character because she's such an emotional basket case from the very beginning.  The whole film has her going through many psychological changes, freaking out, crying and doing irrational stuff at any given moment.  I realize that this is all part of the overall point, but we never see her ""normal"" to begin with, so it's kinda hard to identify with her on any level at all.  That's not to say Asia's performance is bad coz she actually plays it quite well(of course she's pretty much made a career out of playing women with psychological baggage of varying degrees).  Very well, actually.  A very interesting film any way you cut it, and a must for Argento fans.  This dvd from Blue Underground looks wonderful compared to that cruddy Troma disc we've had to suffer through for the last few years.  Disc 2 consists of various individual interviews totaling a little over an hour and a half with Dario and other crew members.  One interview is with the psychologist who Dario consulted about the Stendhal Syndrome.  This is the doctor who apparently is the world's authority on the syndrome and treats many patients at a hospital in Florence.  She also wrote the book on the subject.  This is an interesting little feature.  Supposedly 80% of the population suffers from this syndrome to some degree.  BS or not?  You decide.  Good movie though.",1188777600,4,3026,4.701520912547529
1011438,3,6305282218,"The Stendhal Syndrome is probably Dario Argento's most difficult and contradictory film. On one side it's a nasty little thriller about a serial rapist and killer with some unpleasant violence (albeit not as excessive as you might expect). And yet at the same time it does make a genuine effort to build a narrative around the psychological after-effects on one of his victims as she continually reinvents herself in an attempt to run away from the experience. Unfortunately, the fact that she's played by Asia Argento, an actress with more ferocity than subtlety doesn't help. Nor does the fact that the Stendhal Syndrome itself, a form of emotional overload and physical breakdown in the presence of great works of art somewhat similar to the Jerusalem Syndrome, isn't really explored. The bad cgi when it is doesn't help either. Still, it's much, much better than the likes of Argento's pitiful Phantom of the Opera or The Card Player, but it's not essential viewing by a long, long way.

The film has always had a checkered history on DVD - for all Lloyd Kaufman's boasts of releasing the uncut version, Troma's release was less than impressive and 74 seconds shorter than the Italian version (a couple of brief dialogue scenes trimmed by Argento himself) with a underwhelming transfer that offered only the English dub. The extras were a mixed bag too - three interviews with Dario Argento (one about Phantom of the Opera), a TV spot, stills gallery, interview with fx man Sergio Stivaletti and, for no discernible reason, Ruggero Deodato on Cannibal Holocaust and far too much Troma crap. Whereas the Italian PAL 2-disc DVD offered the dubbed American version and the very slightly longer subtitled Italian version on separate discs but was overcropped to 1.78:1 rather than the original 1.66:1 widescreen, Blue Underground offers the uncut film on the first disc with optional English or Italian soundtracks in 1.66:1 (the film reverts to subtitled Italian for the restored scenes) in a superb transfer supervised by cinematographer Giuseppe Rotuno that finally shows the film in it's true colors after years of grainy and washed-out transfers. There's also a good selection of substantial interviews on the second disc. Although the making of documentary on the Italian two-disc set hasn't been included, with separate interviews with Argento, special effects supervisor Sergio Stivaletti, assistant director Luigi Cozzi and production designer Massimo Antonello Geleng, there's no cause for complaint. Best of all is the fascinating interview with psychological consultant Graziella Magherini, who originally identified the syndrome in the unrelated non-fiction book that inspired the film.",1141516800,4,2699,5.276744186046511

But for those of you who don't mind venturing into the bizzare and beautiful world of foreign thriller films, go for it!  I doubt you'll be disappointed.",1126051200,,515,4.425531914893617
1011440,3,6305282218,"I've seen this movie only once, and only a couple of days ago, but details are becoming vaguer and vaguer in my mind.  This is never a good sign.  It was watchable, definitely, and it generated a very strong, surreal atmosphere throughout the first half, but it fails to go anywhere terribly interesting, and gets increasingly dull as the film goes along.  It's still worth seeing if you're a fan of Dario Argento, but if you aren't there are a helluva lot of others films you need to see first.

The film stars Asia Argento as a detective on the track of a serial rapist/murderer, who becomes the victim said criminal shortly after she is succumbs to the Stendhal Syndrome.(i.e. a strong physical reaction to a piece of art. Fainting is the symptom in her case)  There's not much of a plot-arc here, as after the setup it is just sort of a portrait of her life, as she takes a turn for the nutty after her experience, and is again victimized by the still at-large killer.  Much of the early film is quite compelling, as Asia lives in a world somewhere between reality in fantasy, where she walks in and out of paintings, accompanied by Ennio Morricone's repetitive and haunting score.  However, the more surreal aspects of the film are de-emphasized in the latter portions, and are, sadly, not replaced by increased plot development or action.  And, even the effective earlier portions tends to be less effective than his Dario's best work.  My problem with the second half is probably heightened by the fact that I stumbled across what happens at the end of the film before actually viewing it. However, this is true of most of the Argento films I've seen, and none of the others have faultered in the latter portions to nearly the same extent. Beyond this, the hints as to the conclusion of the film are so incredibly blatant that I suspect most viewers will have no difficulty figuring it out long before the ending, though I certainly couldn't say for certain.(I'm also perhaps a bit influenced some of the reviews I've read before hand, which said that it started pretty strong but got boring by the second half. But I kinda doubt this effected me too much.  There just isn't anything of interest going on in most of the second half of the film.)

Many people have talked about how disturbing the rape-scenes in this film are.  Personally I'm not affected by them much.  I guess this is because rape is, presumably, most disturbing and painful from a psychological standpoint, and I just can't connect that way.  But, lots of people are disturbed by them, so consider yourself warned.  This is a different sort of thriller than most of Argento's most famous work, so there is less of an emphasis on the horror set-piece.  What this comes down to is that there aren't any really effective horror or violence related scenes in the film.  Most horribly, they use some absolutely hideous computer animation for some gore and other visual effects.  If you can't afford decent CGI, don't use it, for God's sake!

The acting is a mixed bag, as usual.  Asia is acceptable, if not amazing, other than in the scenes where she is supposed to be 'tough' which she can't pull of at all.  The rapist is pretty good too, very creepy while still seeming more or less human.  No one else in the film is worthy of particular mention.

As many have said, the DVD does look rather crappy, though it isn't quite as bad as I'd imagined considering just how maligned it is.(It's not far off, however)  Still, if you're expecting something like the various Anchor Bay releases of Dario Argento's films your gonna be in for a nasty surprise.

Definitely subpar, but with enough effective aspects to make it worth checking out, it you're into this sort of stuff.",1101168000,27,3742,4.641881638846738
1011441,3,6305282218,"This certainly isn't one of Dario's classics, but the presence of Dario's daughter Asia in the central role, certainly raises the quality and interest of the film.  She is a solid actor and good fun to watch on screen.  Admittedly the plot is somewhat loose in parts, but this is typical of the Dario Argento style, and this movie certainly has the hallmarks of one of his films.  There is a fair degree of blood and guts but nothing too torturous to get worked up about.  I'd say it's about on par with most of his other efforts in this regard and perhaps a little less confronting.  As others have mentioned the quality of the film on this DVD is quite poor.  It looks very much like it was filmed on video rather than real film.  The colours are washed out and the image is grainy rather than sharp.  This is somewhat of an Achilles heel because Dario's movies draw much of their power from their vivid often somewhat surrealistic imagery.  When you are watching a diminished copy like this, you just don't notice the cinematography.  Hopefully, as others have said, a better copy is still to be released.",1096156800,5,1108,4.522613065326633

It also didn't feel like it was a FULL letterbox version as parts of the opening credits were cut off on the left and right edges.
One of the interviews was OK, but it was really an interview all about Argento's 'Phantom of the Opera'.  The other interviews were extremely cheesy as they weren't even done in person -- it was just Dario holding a microphone answering questions that were coming to him over the phone.
The movie is quite interesting and better than I expected.  It deserves a much better DVD than this extremely cheesy production from Troma, though.  Movie gets a 4/5, DVD gets a 1/5.",1080864000,5,891,4.469135802469136
1011443,5,6305282218,"CONTAINS ONE MINOR SPOILER
The Stendhal Syndrome was the second movie I saw by Dario Argento.  Since then I've become a huge fan of his work.  Many people find this multi-layered thriller to be one of his failures and I find that hard to believe.  Granted, it's more character driven than most of his movies tend to be and the movie's pace and athmosphere change dramatically in the second half.  Still, I found out that it's got a lot of his trademarks (having now viewed all his movies except Four flies on grey velvet, which I can't find anywhere).  It's stylish as hell,  with great use of artworks (as metaphors that is; the scene where Asia covers herself in paint had me wondering), the music score is excellent (by Ennio Morricone; not Goblin) and the violence is at times extreme (the rape scenes particularly, since you know Asia's father is directing them).
The real difference with this film considering Dario's other films is the psychological undertone.  I have watched this movie now three times and I'm always seeing something I didn't figure out the last time.  That's what great complex thrillers do, they always keep you wondering.  This is without a doubt Dario Argento's most complex film, it demands the audience pay attention to what's happening.  As far as psychological thrillers go, this one ranks high.",1073865600,10,1329,4.84070796460177

If the DVD weren't bad enough it's made even worse by having a horrible, embarrassing introduction and foolish, faux interviews with Troma president Lloyd Kaufman.  A good film is severely cheapened by a poor presentation.  A big, fat ZERO for the disc.

1011482,4,6305282218,"I am slightly embarrassed to admit that this is my first Dario Argento film. For anyone even remotely interested in horror movies, this admission is not an easy one. I don't really know why I waited so long to watch an Argento film; perhaps it is merely an oversight on my part. It certainly has nothing to do with an aversion to Italian horror cinema; I have seen several films by such notables as Lucio Fulci, Ruggero Deodato, and Umberto Lenzi but never anything from Dario. Argento's body of work is voluminous: he's been making films for over thirty years, with his best work appearing in the 1970s and early 1980s. I'll eventually watch ""Suspiria,"" ""Inferno,"" and ""Deep Red,"" but for my first Argento film I decided to view ""The Stendhal Syndrome,"" mainly because the plot sounded immensely intriguing even for a horror film. The additional factor of Asia Argento in the starring role of Anna Manni definitely didn't hurt, either. Asia is Dario's daughter, an actress whose star is rising with recent appearances in American big budget films.
""The Stendhal Syndrome,"" set in Italy, tells the story of police detective Anna Manni. Anna's latest case involves a serial rapist who with his last two victims added murder to his resume. Regrettably for Anna, this criminal has now set his sights on her. His first move against Manni entails luring her to a museum where she falls victim to an odd psychological malady called the Stendhal Syndrome. Named for the famous French writer Stendhal, this mental affliction causes the sufferer to undergo nausea, headaches, depression, and severe hallucinations when confronted with works of art. In Anna's case, the trip to the museum turns into nothing less than a bizarre interaction with a painting in which Anna perceives herself actually entering the picture for a quick dip in the ocean where see encounters a smoochy fish. Subsequent episodes include walking into a painting of a waterfall and entering a picture only to find herself at a murder scene. The rapist soon plays a cat and mouse game with Anna, driving her nearly mad with his attentions. The game wears Anna down, causing a rift with her policeman boyfriend and requiring periodic visits to a psychiatrist to work through the trauma she suffers at the hands of her adversary. Director Argento plays games with the viewer as well, concealing the implications of Anna's experiences with her stalker until the end of the film. ""The Stendhal Syndrome"" runs for a lengthy two hours, taking turns which are at times fascinating or boring.
The most basic problem with ""The Stendhal Syndrome"" is Argento's uneven pacing and a lack of plot coherency. All of the best effects appear in the first thirty minutes of the film, thereby letting the rest of the movie fall into a rather boring montage of scenes until again picking up steam in the last ten minutes. Don't get me wrong; I think this movie is worth watching, but I also feel it is worth watching only for a limited number of scenes. ""The Stendhal Syndrome"" just doesn't work as a coherent film. The plot is hazy at best, with Argento providing more questions than answers. I once read that Argento's plots often sink into a quagmire of confusion, and if this is so, maybe that explains what happened here. All I can say is that a few scenes possess incredibly great power, while the majority of the movie lags far behind. You get the sense you are watching a genius at work, but that he's a lazy genius who lacks the fortitude to carry a great idea to fruition.
Sergio Stivaletti did the special effects for ""The Stendhal Syndrome,"" and they are quite impressive. The scenes where Anna suffers through a Stendhal episode look good considering this movie probably didn't have a big budget. Moreover, many of the graphic effects produce cringe worthy moments that should warm the heart of any serious horror connoisseur. An interview on the DVD with Stivaletti discusses in depth the problems and successes of the effects work that occurred during the course of the movie. This was the first time Stivaletti ever used computer graphics, and he did a good job overall.
The biggest surprise with this DVD is its release by Troma films. Troma, if you're not aware, is a studio dedicated to producing the worst Z grade junk in film history. One thing Troma does know how to do, however, is release DVD's with lots of extras. There are interviews with Dario Argento here, along with an interview with ""Cannibal Holocaust"" director Ruggero Deodato (why? I don't know), a bunch of trailers for low-grade schlock like ""The Rowdy Girls,"" ""Teenage Catgirls in Heat,"" ""Killer Condom,"" and ""Terror Firmer,"" and yet another one of those Troma Intelligence Tests. Aren't all of these extras great? Maybe so, but Troma technicians botched the transfer of the film. ""The Stendhal Syndrome"" is awash in haze, murky shadows, and grain. In short, the movie doesn't look as good as it should. Troma knows better.
I won't let the uneven ""The Stendhal Syndrome"" get me down. All directors have their difficulties, and this film, while far from great, isn't bad either. Asia Argento does a fair job in the lead, although it's difficult to imagine her as a police officer. Be sure and pay attention when Asia dons a blonde wig. She looks so much like Traci Lords that it's scary. Good effects, good gore, a great if repetitive score by Ennio Morricone, and an occasionally interesting plot make ""The Stendhal Syndrome"" a must see for Italian horror fans.",1059350400,3,5491,4.842553191489362
1011483,4,6305282218,"Careful: this movie is not an easy one to watch. It's crude, violent, disturbing, sick, perverted, vicious. And yet fascinating, elegant, smart, exciting. Asia Argento gives her best here, and unfortunately you can not listen to her real voice, since she was dubbed (despite most people find her voice horrible). Kretschmann is revolting and yet convincing: great phisique du role and twisted minded. Argento brings us inside the Uffizi gallery with the usual elegance is renowned for. Florence has never been so ambiguous.
Troma could have helped this movie gain a five-star. But the video quality is scarce and all but clean and the audio track is forgettable. Good job with the extra features, with a commentary section by Sergio Stivaletti (special effects), an interview with Ruggero Deodato (Cannibal Ferox), Lloyd Kaufmann interviewing Argento and Dario being interviewed in Stockholm (find an easter egg!).

1011484,3,6305282218,"""The Stendhal Syndrome"" is Dario Argento's hardest movie to watch. The entire movie runs darker and deeper than his better work and leaves the viewers feeling a little, well... sick.
Asia Argento is beautiful but totally unbelievable as a cop on the track of a serial rapist. She's totally set up to be victimized and victimized she is. In brutal, graphic fashion. What makes these rape scenes even harder to watch is the knowledge that Dario Argento is directing his own daughter.
There are some nice visuals as Asia falls into a painting underwater to share a smooch with an odd-looking fish, and when she steps into a painting of a waterfall. In another scene, a nasty piece of graffiti rips itself from the wall. However, not enough is done with Asia's ""Stendhal Syndrome""; it just doesn't come as much into play as I would have liked.
The plot becomes convoluted and doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and while this is to be expected from an Argento film, it's a little more noticable seeing as how the movie plays more straightforward than his more stylish ventures (Suspiria, Deep Red, Tenebrae).
The Troma features are ok on the DVD, including an interview with Dario Argento about Italian horror and a bunch of Troma previews.  The picture is a little dark and grainy, making me wish for the crystal-clear clarity of DVD's like ""Suspira"".
""The Stendhal Syndrome"" is not one of Dario's best work, but it's worth seeing if you're a fan. Just be warned: it's not easy to watch.",1045353600,2,1484,4.707692307692308

While at the Uffizi Gallery, the paintings have a weird effect on her, she feels herself being immersed in one of them, and collapses.  However, the rapist assaults her, then rapes and kills another woman in front of her.  The incident leaves Anna traumatized, with feelings of self-despite, insecurity, and pent-up aggression.
The kindly psychologist assigned to her describes the title condition to her in describing what Stendhal (the pen-name of psychological novelist Marie-Henri Beyle) felt at an art musuem:  ""My feeling is so profound that is borders on pity.  All this speaks clearly to my soul.  Oh, if only I could forget it.""  Symptoms also include a cold sweat, nausea, anxiety, hallucinations, severe depression, and personality changes.
She returns to her home in Viterbo to recuperate from her ordeal, but the rapist tracks her down and assaults her once again.  Anna deals with him in a very brutal scene, but hey, he deserved it.  But has he really been defeated?  And will Anna become her old self?
The Stendhal Syndrome is different from Argento's usual fare in that there are no eerie glaring backwash of red, blue, or green, or horror gore.  And leave it to Dario Argento to subject his own daughter to some really nasty ordeals, even if it is only acted out.  Asia's pretty in a more natural way instead of the artificial movie bimbos are.  She's more a dazed, insecure victim here, but she can be tough.  Argento's method of exploring human psychology and concepts (be they architecture or alchemy in Inferno, insects in Phenomena, or witchcraft in Suspiria) carry on in this movie--here, he explores the power that art can have on people.  No, Goblin or Keith Emerson do not do the music here, but there's an ongoing haunting theme, with a female vocalist singing the notes.

A popular train of current thought seems to welcome Nohosonno as return to form since his last major triumph, OPERA. Apart from the fact that I think these two films are often overrated (they are still great films), this does a grave injustice to Stendhal. But then again, I also quite like Phantom of the Opera, must be the Asia factor! (rightly acknowledged by most as one of Argento's weaker efforts; however, given his pedigree, this is not as bad as it would for most).
The Troma release is unusual in that the voluminous extras tend to clash with the main feature. You can easily ignore these if they are not to your taste. I bought the special edition of Smow White (largely due to the Suspiria connection), and have still to watch any of the 7 hours (or whatever) of bonus materials.
The picture quality does seem quite washed out, but having not seen the French DVD or any projected version, I don't know how much of this is directorial intent. It fits quite nicely to the atmosphere of the film / Morricone's music.
I hope this film earns greater recognition as the years progress. It may also come to be seen to as the prologue to the new trinity of giallo that Argento is working on. His new film, I seem to remember reading somewhere, also involves Asia playing a policewoman.",1015459200,,1428,4.496153846153846

soon meanders into tedium and never manages to recover. Although initially disappointing Argento titles such as TRAUMA, for example, have blossomed with the passage of time, this film seems particularly resistant to reappraisal. Certain elements work extremely well, with Thomas Kretschman's forceful performance, Morricone's repetitive score and Asia Argento's hypnotic visit to the Uffizi Gallery being the major assets. Unfortunately, the film soon abandons it's one truly original idea - the ""Stendhal Syndrome"" itself - and heads in a more mundane killer vs. police direction. Of course, Argento tries to spice this up with abherrent psychology, grotesque sadism and narrative trickery, but the end result never approaches the high standard set by classics such DEEP RED or TENEBRAE. Scenes between Anna (Asia) and the police psychiatrist are interminably boring, whilst the less said about the unconvincing family relationships and romantic scenes, the better. Although this is my least favourite Argento film, it certainly didn't deserve the humiliation of being released by Troma! Lloyd Kaufmann's inane, ill-informed introduction claims the DVD contains the digitally re-mastered director's cut.

1011530,4,6305282218,"I have read so many reviews {mostly on other websites} saying that Dario Argento's films in the 90s are all disappointing compared to his past masterpieces. I totally disagree. I think Argento has yet to lose his touch. It's just after so many great horror/thriller/mystery movies, you tend to keep comparing all his movies to his earlier masterpieces. Even though The Stendahl Syndrome is not as great as Suspiria, Deep Red, Phenomena, etc., it's still alot better then the majority of thrillers out nowadays.
I will not get into the plot and story line because there are plenty of other reviews to go to for that. I just want to go into why I love this film. First off the story and plot {that I just chose to ignore in this review} is pretty original but still has common elements of other Argento films. Second, the scenes where Asia ""falls"" or ""walks"" into art are great and I wish there was more scenes like that. The rape and torture scenes are kinda hard to watch but they are not over the top {atleast not by Argento standards} and halfway through Asia gets to turn the tables for a bit. The movie switches between 2 or 3 different overall feels. At first, it's got paranoia and horror with Asia having constant encounters with the villian but then it changes to a more calm and healing feel and then switches back to fear before the last scenes fall into place.
The only things that really bothered me was Asia has a cop, she didn't quite bring in the feel that she was one. And this film has alot of similar elements to Argento's earlier film Tenebre. Either way I highly suggest this film to fans of psychologic thrillers but this is not a good film to experience Dario Argento for the first time if you have yet to witness any of his great early work.",1007596800,3,1764,4.464396284829721

It is ""giallo"" in style, however the plot points more to a psychological study, both of victim and of the psycho himself. Almost universally panned on it's release, it's a film that grows on you from each viewing. There are quite a few rapescenes in here that are truly harrowing, and they are to be commended for showing how degrading and brutal a rape can be. Also on the bonus side are some ravishing scenes from the Uffici-gallery, a nice (though not top) Morriconescore and an interesting character study from Kretschmann as the psycho. Asias performance is more of a mixed bag. Gritty and determined, yet vulnerable and on the verge of a nervous breakdown, she is sometimes impressive. However, she seldom convinces entirely, especially at being masculin. Other minuspoints are also: slow middlesection (the therapy sessions really go on forever), some embarrassing performances (could be the dubbing) and a few akward plot-turns.

After being brutalized by the madman and having her emotions and memory jumbled, she returns home to try and piece her fragile self back together. Stendhal Syndrome is haphazard mess, struggling to work, yet ultimately failing. Dario Argento presents a bleak film, negative because it lacks the Argento flourish, the stylized touch that made him famous. Aside from the occasional shot here and there, the film is outright flat, brutal, and clumsy. Truly, it is only the outright brutality that makes it interesting. Without that ugly touch to prod at and thicken the skin of the viewer, it is just a dud.
What this film reminded me of, in terms of a director slightly shifting in style, was Hitchcock's Frenzy. With Frenzy, Hitchcock directed more violent scenes, nudity, and stronger elements in general, and it is the same with Dario and the overt cruelties in present in Stendhal Syndrome. Gone are the expressionistic tones and otherworldliness that made his violence slick and dreamlike. Instead, Stendhal is just a mean debacle, bookended by a flawed beginning and end, but a good, entertaining middle.
The DVD itself is unforgivable. Troma delayed this for quite sometime, witch would lead one to believe they were taking great care with the film. It is perfectly obvious that they probably delayed the DVD only because of all the self-gratifying promos tacked onto it. The transfer is hideous, barely better than video, washed out color, grainy, and horrible contrast. The extra interviews (two with Dario, one with Sergio Stivaletti, and one, for some reason, with Ruggero Deodato?) are done on bad video with bad microphones, and cameramen, who neither know how to sit still, frame, or focus very well.

1011539,4,6305282218,"While not the roller coaster of non-stop virtuoso bravura camera work, wierd lighting, and non-stop murders as many of the films Argento made his  name on, The Stendhal Syndrome is nevertheless a very fine latter day film  by Italian horror/suspense maestro Argento.
The focus here is on Anna, a  police detective with Rome's anti-rape police unit, very well played by the  director's daughter Asia Argento.  Anna suffers from the title syndrome,  which causes those afflicted to literally lose themselves in works of art.  This leaves Anna vulnerable to the very serial killer/rapist she is working  to help catch.
Mr. Argento pulls absolutely no punches in depicting the  absolute horror of Anna's rape, and while the film's unflinching cruelty  may be hard for some people to watch, it is totally appropriate to the  subject matter--the fact that Dario Argento takes the issue of rape so  seriously in this film for me rules out any accusations of bad taste.
The  focus is very much on the character of Anna, of how both the Stendhal  Syndrome she suffers from and the experience of being raped and stalked  affect her character, and Asia Argento is a fascinating presence to watch  in the role.
Mr. Argento employs his considerable cinematic skill well in  this film, not overwhelming the story and character issues with excessive  stylistic flourishes, but nevertheless employing, with more restraint than  usual, some very stunning and brilliant camera work and scene staging in  the depiction of the both the experience of Anna's losing of herself in  great works of art, and in conveying the terror of her situation.  Many  breathtaking Italian works of art are featured in the film, and the Italian  locations are well used too.
If Anna were simply to turn out to be a  passive victim, though, there would not be much of a story, but to reveal  all that happens would be to spoil the experience of watching this film for  yourself.
Ennio Morricone did a fine job with the music score for the  film, and the quality of Troma's VHS tape, while not quite up to the  standards of Anchor Bay, is of surprisingly good quality.  There were a few  places near the middle of the film where the image flickered a bit for a  short time, but aside from this brief distraction, the picture and sound  quality are excellent.  While probably not quite the full original 1.66:1  aspect ratio, this VHS version is nevertheless moderately letterboxed, so  there obviously can't be much of the picture not on screen here.

The one star rating is not for the film itself, however, but for  the quality of this VHS release.

[La Sindrome di Stendhal]

(Italy - 1995)

Aspect ratio: 1.66:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital

Quite unlike anything Dario Argento has directed before, THE STENDHAL SYNDROME is a grimly realistic portrait of a female  police officer (Asia Argento, essentially miscast) whose encounters with a sadistic rapist/serial killer (Thomas Kretschmann) have devastating consequences. Though distinguished by some truly horrific violence, played straight by Argento with few of his trademark stylistic flourishes, the film is much too languid for its own good, wasting a lot of valuable time on an otherwise laudable attempt to depict the long-term consequences of a vicious sexual assault on the central character. Furthermore, the harsh  subject matter allows no room for levity, and the austere scenario is at odds with the sumptuous artwork that acts as a catalyst for the murderous proceedings. Asia's convulsive reactions to works of art (hence the ornate title) makes her a target for Kretschmann's psychopathic killer, allowing Argento to fill the screen with paintings, sculptures and beautiful objet d'art, which offsets the film's own lack of visual flair.

But there's a fierce intelligence underpinning the somewhat predictable scenario: When Asia de-emphasizes her femininity in response to the initial attack, only to re-establish her womanhood after a second assault in which she emerges the victor (or does she?), it becomes easier to forgive the painfully obvious surprises which clog up the final quarter. Only one scene recalls the best of Argento's work: A potential victim being stalked through a dimly lit room full of oversized marble statues, a brilliantly edited  sequence which suggests everything and reveals nothing. Overall, ""Stendhal"" may not be vintage Argento, but it's too clever and too unsettling to be easily dismissed, and it gets under the skin like no other horror film in recent memory. See it and make up your own mind.",963792000,17,1980,5.450980392156863
1011627,3,6305282218,"The fact that The Stendhal Syndrome, one of Dario Argento's best acted films, is released by Troma on DVD is misleading.  The packaging concentrates only on the most sensationalistic of the film's aspects (the  gore, Asia Argento's presence in the ""Sexiest Women"" list of a  major men's magazine).
And ever since Dario Argento has started aiming  for plotting and script (Trauma, The Phantom of the Opera) instead of the  random stream-of-consciousness imagery that marks his best works (Suspiria,  Tenebre, Inferno), his films have become shakier.  The Stendhal Syndrome  stands out among his '90s works thanks to a varied performance by Asia  Argento, who nails the complexities of the lead character's fears,  aggressions, sensuality, and the mix of strength and vulnerability that  makes her final fate all the more affecting.
The Stendhal Syndrome isn't  a great film, but it's certainly worth watching.  When it gets under Anna's  skin, such as during her pivotal moment of lashing back out at her  tormentor, it's powerfully visceral filmmaking.
This DVD edition offers  plenty of extras, though the lack of a commentary track is somewhat  disappointing, and (again) the packaging is quite hideous.  But judging  from the Argento interview included, perhaps it wasn't a bad idea not to  have Dario comment on the film, given his very thick and nearly  incomprehensible accent.  The DVD menus, however, should've been cleaned  up; they're very hard to read, and the chapter division isn't meticulous  enough.  Why bother breaking the film up into chapters if each chunk is a  good seven minutes long?",963273600,,1606,5.224409448818897

Although there is some slight graininess and very minor artifacting during the film, the image actually looks really Nice, especially considering  Troma put it out.  I was very relieved it looks as good as it does.  The  film itself is better on a second viewing and, although it's not amongst  Argento's best, it is definitely a superior thriller by the italian  maestro.  The excellent Ennio Morricone score is also a major plus.  And  Asia is quite effective as the young woman subject to the hallucinatory  nightmarish condition brought on by works of art.  A psycho rapist with a  razor-blade smile is killing women in Italy and Asia's art-visions lead her  into his clutches.  Yes, this is the film where Argento filmed his own  daughter's rape scene.  Extras on the disc include two interviews with  Dario (the Lloyd Kaufman one and another on the set of ""Phantom""  which is a lot more interesting) not to mention some ""hidden""  interview footage of Argento in Stockholm (accessed by hitting the  ""9"" to get the razor blade).  There's also an interview with  Sergio Stivaletti and for some reason, there's  an interview with Ruggero  Deodato who discusses ""Cannibal Holocaust"" (don't really know why  it's on this disc) The interview with Deodato has really bad translated  subtitles....he talks and talks, but the subtitles are really basic and  abbreviated.  Better than nothing, I suppose.  The film ""bios""  on Dario and Asia are simply filmographies (it amusingly lists ""Four  Patches on Grey Velvet"" instead of ""Flies""! ).

Due to the fact that where I live in the middle of nowhere New Hampshire and there are no video stores within a 25 mile radius, I'm disabled so if its not on Amazon, Netflix coma or hole a hugely have to buy it or rent it from Amazon. So back to my point is I actually really like this movie? I thought it was extremely inventive and interesting and considering Susperia is probably my favorite film by I cant. I had not known that prior to mother of tears that he and his daughter had worked together, so when I saw this in his filmography, I jumped on it and I also love. I don't know how to pronounce his last name but the man that plays alfredo I thought he played a very maniacal sadistic killer slash rapist that was so intriguing that although he was disgusting and repugnant. He was endearing at the same time. But I almost found this in some ways, reminded me of like the silence of the lambs on crack.

But in a different manner the only few things that I really did not like about the movie, especially if this is or is not one of the unrated slash extended versions, is that. The raping/necro scenes. Not that that is something that bothers me, but I just thought that. It went on to a point that you could have done them and do it in a way where it didn't have to be. Grow out in a psychological way, not in a visual way. Especially considering we know our gentle is a visionary of his deaths and its kill scenes and so on and so forth, but I just thought it went. Some of it. I really was impressed with his daughter and how asians acting was and the story of her psychological aspect of what her character went through after each victim and every time she ran into alfredo et cetera. But some of it.
