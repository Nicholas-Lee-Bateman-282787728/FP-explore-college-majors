1622549,1,B00005LMAO,"You know you're in trouble when they can't afford horses and the actors have to pull the carts!
As much as I like Eric Roberts, this movie sucked.  It was boring, the dialog was stilted, the fight coreography sloppy, and there was very little of Eric Roberts in it.  He's a fine actor, but he just couldn't carry this movie by himself and nobody else was helping.
You can watch this as a family movie, but it would probably bore the kids to death.
If it were possible to give a film no stars, this would be it! So save your money, and if you want to buy a really good Eric Roberts film, I suggest Nature of the Beast, with Lance Heinricksen (one of Eric's best bad guy rolls!)or Race Against Time (he actually plays the good guy in this one!).",1003708800,3,743,4.225352112676056

If anyone has seen By the sword you know what I'm talking about.
  The camera work goes from good to terrible. What is good about the film is that it can be watched with kids, it is very swashbuckling in nature, it has Eric Roberts and some of the characters are adoreable even though they are steryotyped.

Not this move though.  In this one, no one is even trying.  The production quality is basically like a high school play. The set design doesn't try to look real. The actor blocking is just whatever they came up with first. The actors are wooden. The dialogue is unimaginative.  The camera placement amateurish (that's an insult to amateurs).

The bad guys want the princess and her dowry while the King's Guards attempt to save her while very badly outnumbered. The swordplay is theater-style with the old rapier and ""main gauche"" technique popular between 1560-1660.  The costumes appear to be from the 1620s-1640s in style. I was once the only American member of the 20,000+ strong British ""Sealed Knot"" historical society, specifically in the King's Guard Regiment, Oxford Company, so I couldn't resist the title. Instead of Errol Flynn or blood and guts, what I watched was something different: pleasant, attractive, and likeable characters, good moral values, several good laughs, and an ending that really made me smile.

1622669,1,B00005LMAO,"To put in plain and simple, this movie really has nothing to do with anything in particular besides the unromantic romance between a kings guard and a princess. Our movie begins one fine day when the Queen approaches the Kings guard with the proposition of his help to ensure the safety of their daughter as she travels with her dowry to wed the Sicilian King. Things go awry when a very dumb group of bandits attack them, and force the group into a broken down house, that just happens to sit in the very middle of a huge field. Now the fact that the placing of this house is very convenient, for the band of desperate, dirty ruffians  led by Ron Perlman must rush into  the open glade to attack.

If this wasn't bad enough, we find that the good guys have a certain adventage, possessing a feat known as the ""Tigers Claw"" Which is supposed to be a deadly weapon. What it really is is sending three people rushing wildly out into the field and slaying as many people as possible. They only manage to achieve this successfully for the 'bad guys' happen to be insanely stupid. The sword play is also the worst I've ever seen. Stances are sloppy, there's virtually no talent displayed, and the fighting reminds me of the battles I used to fight against my brothers. Really bad and totally lacking in realistic proffesionalism.

Oh, back to the story. Well, the 'bad guys' die without managing to kill even one of the opposing party. If this wasn't enough to make us convinced this was definatly a scripted movie, the way the guard and princess fall in love is even dumber. A few yells, proffesions of hate, and five minutes later they are in love. I shake my head in unseen disgust.

Also don't be fooled, some have said this is a movie that gamers will love, they are wrong. We gamers are not so totally dumb that a movie such as this will have us jumping for joy. Arrgh......There still has to be a level of intelligence there for us to enjoy it.

On the whole, this is a movie that has bad acting, bad camera work and equally bad music. Besides which the costumes where a few centuries short of being truly Renaissance. From hooped skirts, to the men's almost 1700th century styles, this definatly cannot be considered influenced by the century they where trying to portray.

In conclusion, don't rent, and most definatly don't buy. See if some unlucky friend of your's happens to have it first.",1123459200,,2396,4.506912442396313
1622670,3,B00005LMAO,"Treachery, villainy, swordplay, noble secret love and a princess in peril: what more could the average ten year old would-be Musketeer ask for?

Set in the days of chivalry at sword point, ""The King's Guard"" is the tale of the ""last stand"" of a princess (Ashley Jones) being taken to a marriage that will save her father's throne and the young noble Guard (Trevor St. John) who secretly loves her, against the traitorous ex-Guard (Eric Roberts) who wants her and the greedy Lord (Ron Perlman) who wants her dowry.

This movie has nice costumes and I think that's where most of the money went. Ninety-nine percent of it takes place in one setting. There are no horses although the DVD cover shows a cavalry. The acting runs the spectrum from almost-painful-to-watch (Jones) to oh-good-someone-knows-what-they're-doing (Perlman, Roberts). The swordplay, although decently choreographed, is done too hesitantly by most of the actors to be truly exciting.

People who are into the Renaissance Fair, SCA (Society for Creative Anachronism) and LARP (Live Action Role Playing) scenes may be able to glean some inspiration from the costumes and sword play.

Although there is much fighting there is no blood or gore so this would be an excellent family movie for anyone with young children going through a swashbuckling phase.

There are some funny bloopers after the end credits.

With some editing to make the movie a little simpler and perhaps a narrator to pull things together, they should repackage this one and pitch it to Disney.  My son loved the swordplay and the goofy characters and couldn't stop laughing at them.
The only fun I got out of it was watching Ron Perlman, but then, I could listen to him read the Manhattan phone directory and never be bored.",1027209600,,424,4.4935064935064934
1622673,5,B00005LMAO,"You know, I do Renaissance Faires all over. . .I've done reenactments and I know history, so as far as ACCURACY goes, this movie is going to dissapoint.  HOWEVER . . ....it's NOT A DOCUMENTARY, you'll find that it is QUALITY entertainment with ALL the elements that make a wonderful story.  The Hero is young and attractive.  He and his ragtag bunch go up against insurmountable odds and win the day with cool heads and careful planning.  The villains are CLEARLY villains with no ambiguous motives, despite swordfight upon swordfight, there is no real 'violent' imagery (blood and gore).

1622674,5,B00005LMAO,"I've always loved movies with teh whole medieval-plot to it, and this one is acceptionally good! I loved the costumes, and they all were fantatsic actors ; the parts where the two men are fighting over the hat, and the other two men are acting for the princess, the lady, and her  escort, really brought some humorto the movie, the swordplay was fantastic. To those who're just worried about the costumes, who cares if they were victorian or somehting?! The actors were fantastic, and the costumes were good enough to fit the movie. I especially liked Katie(female soldier) the captain, the princess , and William(the soldier) but, i loved the whole cats & movie, I reccomend this video to anyone who just wants to watch a action/adventure type movie, with some humor in it.",1018569600,2,774,4.776119402985074
1622675,2,B00005LMAO,"OK we caught this film on the TV a couple weeks ago and it is sooo bad it is hysterical.
I've been doing historical costuming for years and the costumes were just wrong! While some were nice they were all such a hodge podge of different eras as to completely inacurate. It was as if they got all the historical and SCA/Fantasy reinactors they could find who had their own suits and made this movie. And the totaly riduculous dresses on the women that just look like they took a modern long velevet dress and put a VICTORIAN (1800's) hoop skirt on underneath it.
And as if that wasn't bad enough it was soo badly acted by some and not so bad by others so you would get caught up in the good part and then roll on the floor laughing at the bad!
Eric Roberts and Ron Perlman have a few brief scenes but it was soo bad.....
The only reason I give it two stars at all is because they have a bloopers real, a-la Jackie Chan movies, at the end that was just great! That would have made a better film than the film!",1014595200,4,1007,4.116751269035533

It was like a bad Xena mixed with a highschool film project.
