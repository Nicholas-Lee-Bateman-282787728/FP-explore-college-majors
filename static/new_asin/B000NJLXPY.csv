One regular theme in these Westerns is how a rich and important person in town is really crooked; and how a seemingly guilty person is really innocent. Was this a popular idea from the Great Depression where the failures of the Establishment caused the Great Depression? The recurrent use of this idea didn't hurt sales of movie tickets. There was no excessive use of actors, scenes may have been edited to limit the running time.",1506729600,,2727,4.351669941060904
