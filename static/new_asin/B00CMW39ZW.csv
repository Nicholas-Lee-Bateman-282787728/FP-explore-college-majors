8583622,5,B00CMW39ZW,Beck tells it like it is. I learned more about History from him in the last 6 years than I learned in 14 years of school. Ditto as far as Episode 1-Surveillance State,1393977600,,166,4.0606060606060606
8583623,4,B00CMW39ZW,The events in the world are important to me to understand how our government is handleing things.  I can't help but get the feeling that our government acts by impulse rather than calculated and informed methods.,1380931200,,212,4.888888888888889
8583624,5,B00CMW39ZW,"Love the ""For the Record"" DVD series. Glenn Beck at his best!
The sad thing is, once you come to realize what Glenn is revealing, it's depressing.",1377043200,,146,4.444444444444445
8583625,5,B00CMW39ZW,Glenn Beck writes a lot of truth about history and current events.  You can count on him being truthful which is an exception these days.  We no longer have truth from the media so this is refreshing.,1375228800,,200,4.378378378378378
8583626,5,B00CMW39ZW,"Once again the truth is here, check it out and also subscribe to the Blaze TV or at least listen to the radio show with Glenn Beck.",1372809600,3,131,3.888888888888889
8583627,5,B00CMW39ZW,"These two videos are for people who can really handle the truth about ""Big Brother"".
This is the real thing. The book 1984, has become a reality and Big Brother is on steroids.
I'm glad I bought both Episodes, #1 and # 2.",1372291200,4,221,4.162790697674419
8583628,5,B00CMW39ZW,"Once again Glenn and crew deliver an outstanding piece of journalism! This one was a tough one to watch. Both informative and heart-breaking. It amazes me how naive most Americans have become. We have let the Left vs Right game get in the way of our national security and one day it's going to catch up with us. The Muslim Brotherhood is evil to the core yet we can't say that out loud because it is not ""politically correct"". In this episode they play Muslim Brotherhood leaders IN THEIR OWN WORDS talking about the destruction of America and Israel, yet we continue to kow tow to these folks. Why? The second half is on the sex trade here in America. Something you almost never hear about from our so-called Main Steam Media. Perhaps one day more Americans will wake up to the evil that is happening right under our noses? Overall this is $14 very well spent. Outstanding journalism and brilliantly produced documentary!",1372204800,6,922,4.662576687116564
