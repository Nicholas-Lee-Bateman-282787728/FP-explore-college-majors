8494323,1,B0067EMI30,"Long out of print since shortly after it was released in Year 2000 as the inaugural volume of Wild East Productions' Spaghetti Western Collection, A Fistful of Trailers is a hard to find, much sought after collectible.  It truly does contain Coming Attractions reels for 36 of the best ever Euro Westerns and it's fun to watch in small doses.  Here's the problem: For some reason, the folks at Wild East chose to release A Fistful of Trailers in Standard Definition--that is to say this DVD is not ""Enhanced for Widescreen TVs"".  Yes, the trailers are presented in their original widescreen theatrical aspect ratios, but since they are not electronically formatted for High Definition (aka Anamorphic Widescreen) that means black bars appear on all four sides of the image when this DVD is displayed on a Widescreen TV.  Considering that it came out nearly 4 years after the introduction of anamorphic widescreen DVDs, this is inexcusable.

I paid a pretty penny for this DVD on eBay last week.  Needful collectible or not, it's just not worth it!  Please don't make the same mistake I did!!",1371427200,3,1091,4.864864864864865
