8364815,4,B00000F1LQ,"You can plainly see why this mini-series turned out as well as it did. Mike Robe and company really researched their subject extremely well. The costuming, weaponry, dialects,everything that had to do with the Little BigHorn battle(leading up to and aftermath) are quite accurate. This video shows how they wanted to make the story to be like it really was, and not just a thrown together Hollywood treatment of the event we've seen in most of the other versions. Kudos to all involved.",1011139200,11,486,4.867469879518072
