7991929,5,B00009MEII,You had me with Filmrise. Since it is baseball season I won't be watching many movies so I will have to limit my watching to Filmrise. I Like this story. I like the action and violence. I like the pursuit. I like the shooting and killing. I like the punching and kicking. I like the explosions.,1521849600,,294,4.267857142857143

7991933,2,B00009MEII,"Deron Malibu McBee was blessed with a body like Arnold Schwarzenegger, the good looks of Lorenzo Lamas, and a mullet so breathtaking it makes me fall to my knees, but his career as an action hero is predominantly limited to supporting roles and the odd vehicle like this. Disappointingly, this particular moment in the spotlight is not his finest. The Killing Zone is a bad movie that has a chance of attracting cheese-lovers, but if you're looking for good action and a satisfying story, this one probably won't deliver.

The story: An imprisoned convict (McBee,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat-Annihilation/dp/0780622057/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat: Annihilation</a>) is recruited from a chain gang to resume his quest of vengeance against a vicious drug lord raining terror upon Los Angeles (James Dalesandro,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/East-L-A-Warriors/dp/B000FGFBNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">East L.A. Warriors</a>).

The DVD cover bills cult actors Michael Easton and Wally K. Berns over McBee, when in fact they only play supporting and bit parts, respectively. Youd think the questionable marketing would stop there, but it turns out that Deron is hardly even the star of the picture. McBees character does not start actively seeking revenge until the final 30 minutes, up until which James Dalesandro holds center stage. His antics are mildly compelling, especially the part wherein hes briefly apprehended and jailed, but with the protagonist too busy having arm wrestling matches and showering with women to be proactive, it all feels rather unimportant.

The opening titles and relatively weak production values initially instilled the impression of a made-for-TV movie, but the film turns out to be much more amateurish than that. The screenplay is riddled with rough, elementary dialogue and an odd affinity for characters unrelated to the plot, like the bickering accident victims and the homeless man highlighted during the car chase. There are plenty of parts wherein the writing is so bad and the acting so hammy that itll make you laugh, but the fact that the story isn't nearly as enthusiastic as the people acting it out makes for very short-lived amusement.

The action content does not redeem the picture at any point. For the most part its a lot of shooting, a few explosions, and a modest helping of hand-to-hand fighting, but none of its very good. There are some surprises, like when the Dalesandro characters revealed to be a competent fighter in the middle of an assassination attempt, but a lack of genuine talent keeps this one from delivering anything but the barest of thrills. Altogether, its a movie best viewed as an experiment or after-hours exercise  that makes it easier to forgive, but not easier to enjoy. Forget about this one.",1453680000,,2889,5.60183066361556
7991934,5,B00009MEII,"I liked this movie a lot because of one actor-James Dalesandro.  He is a person to watch and would be awesome in Grimm, Hannibal, Justified, and Bates Motel.  He has nineteen movies out and I have enjoyed his performances, especially in ""The Return of the Living Dead, and East L.A. Warriors.""  He truly has the craft down pat.  He gets deep into the role and just takes you there - you become a part of what is happening through his superb acting skills.  Thanks James for another great film!  And kudos for being a part of a outstanding cult movie like ""Return of the Living Dead"" and the documentary ""More Brains.""",1409788800,,617,4.513513513513513

7991937,2,B00009MEII,"Those of you who remember the early nineties tv show called AMERICAN GLADIATORS may recognize Deron McBee, one of its star performers.  McBee, looking buffer than ever, plays a determined young man out to avenge the near-crippling of his uncle by a pair of Mexican drug lords.  The movie's action sequences are borrowed from countless other films, and only the film's sincere attempt to take itself serious keeps it from being a true bomb.  McBee has a tough swagger and is attempting to induce his audience to take him as a serious actor.  Since McBee hasn't really done a whole lot since, guess the audience didn't see things his way though!",1126742400,,643,4.7657657657657655
7991938,4,B00009MEII,"Very nice action film with a story. The fourth in the Fiscal de Hierro(The Iron Prosecuter) film series. This one has Mario Almada going up against (and for the last time?), his worst enemy (Ramona Pineda) whom he thought he had killed (in part 3).Now they are face to face in their Encuentro Final(Final Encounter).As Ramona escapes from a prison she returns to avenge all those who put her there, she sets a trap for her worst enemy to come after her (the iron prosecuter), who is now retired. Holding his now grown up son as bait to lure him towards her, this leading towards the final encounter. The Fiscal films have always shown how a man by the law and a woman whose defied it take their vengence on one another...now will this be the end?",1015286400,,746,4.452554744525547
