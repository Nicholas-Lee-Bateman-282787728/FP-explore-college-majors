A taxicab stops to let off the Bumstead family, they were on a vacation in the mountains. Alvin brings over jelly doughnuts. An insurance salesman wants the mailman for a customer. Dagwood is late (again) but catches a crowded bus. Will a man's jacket get stained? Will somebody pick up the wrong briefcase? [Believable?] Dagwood finds changes at the office. Dithers sold the business, guess who is the new owner? Mr. Radcliffe is very strict. Note Ollie's new attitude. Dagwood meets the new boss. Mr. Greenlee arrives, his drug company wants a new building on the outskirts of town. There is a mistake with the opened briefcase! Bumstead loses his office, Ollie has won. Back home he meets Alexander's teacher. She has ideas for Modern Education. Can they visit Dagwood's office? He tells Blondie what happened. Blondie has a plan to help Dagwood.

Blondie is late and rushes out the door. She meets the new mailman. Next its Mr. Radcliffe. Blondie shows her wisdom and impresses Radcliffe. [Home cooking for a bachelor. No comment on Radcliffe's personality.] Greenlee calls, the deal is on. They look at sites, they are unsuitable. But they see a suitable site (boys are playing baseball there). Can they buy that lot? ""Slugger"" will stay for dinner (until Dagwood sends him next door). Miss Geary arrives. Radcliffe talks about his business during dinner. Who is at the window? A telephone call from a lawyer says the lot is not for sale. [Did you get a hint here?] Miss Geary speaks to Radcliffe. What else can happen? The next day Dagwood is relocated at his office, nearer the door. The deal with Greenlee is off unless they can get that land. Dagwood plays a trick to get Radcliffe and Ollie out of the office. The schoolchildren visit Dagwood's office, then leave.

Radcliffe returns and blames Dagwood for the problems; he is fired. Blondie compares Radcliffe's actions unfavorably to Dithers. [No planning ahead?] Lawyer Payson calls Radcliffe to tell who bought the property! ""This is Clarence Oliver Mayberry."" Lawyer Payson explains the deal. Will Dagwood get his job and office back, plus a bonus? They all rush to Brewster Airport to catch Greenlee. Guess who else is there? Yes, there will be a happy ending for Dagwood and Blondie.

A change in ownership or management can present a crisis for some employees. Does flattering a new boss always work? This story has an important lesson beneath the comic overlay. Note how a wealthy individual's power can effect a business, and not always innocuously as in this movie.",1363564800,,2569,4.912442396313364
