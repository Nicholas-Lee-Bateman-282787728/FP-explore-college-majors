Also, you probably don't want to watch either or both of these unless you are a big Miike fan as even together Family and Family2 don't add up to a good story.

The problem with this movie specifically is that there is no internal logic driving the plot.  The movie is more like a series of random incidents that are related to one another only because the same actors are used throughout.  Odd random stuff is thrown in for no good reason, e.g. there is a scene where the protagonist takes his family out on their sea cruiser and are attacked by gun-wielding thugs on seado's.  After the assault the cruiser returns to dock to a couple of grim-faced yakuza awaiting them which elicits a comment from the majordomo that the two don't look happy and must have some bad news.  The next scene, however, makes no mention of this and indeed the issue is never raised again.  This is likely due to film editing and one suspects that a whole different movie was made than was released to the public. Based upon what we are given, it is likely that what was not shown wouldn't have improved the movie anyway for this is a deeply flawed movie.

What makes it worse is that Family2 (more so than Family) is rife with this sort of thing.  Describing it all would take pages.
The major problem is that the story is convoluted and grows more so throughout the movie.  Generously put the storyline is a bit ambitious, a more pragmatic view is that it is undisciplined and lacking in coherence.  It seems almost as though the script was meant to be a grand tapestry of interlocking narratives but there just wasn't enough time to develop them all so all went begging.

There is so much wrong with Family2 that it would take a review nearly as long as the movie to cover them.  Suffice it to say that this is not one of Miike's better efforts and it is bound to be a disappointment to just about everybody who watches it or them.  If you've read my review for Family, I apologize if it caused you to watch Family2.",1219795200,,2233,4.401459854014599
8149575,3,B000JBXP4I,"From the grand master of cool in contemporary cinema, Takashi Miike, comes this piece of doody that sits at the festering bottom of his catalogue with the likes of his other atrociously ailing creations: ""Silver"", ""Bodyguard Kiba"", and the first ""Family"".  Now understand, I consider the man to be the most inspiring, original, and no question the most productive filmmaker currently cranking out pictures today, but that's not to say that he's all sunshine and no rain- but what can you expect from a dude who has been involved in what, maybe 70 productions in his directorial tenure which started in the early nineties.  And here you have one of his severe misses, which he rarely puts out, but here it is.

""Family"" is a yakuza flick in which the plot is a muddled and weak and really isn't even worth mentioning.  The film is just a series of grave conversations between gangsters, peppered with intermittent trying-to-be-stylish shoot 'em ups, seemingly interjected for the sole purpose of adding some action.

It's been said that the director was also cinematographer on this particular project, which was originally one movie but somewhere along the lines split into two, and this shows where some of the shot composition is rather lacking and uninventive, whereas other scenes it's very pleasing and innovative.  But more so the latter than the former.  And being shot on cheap-looking digital doesn't add a lick to the visual appeal.

The opening scene of a smack-filled, beat-up, half-nude girl having a gangsters' dirty feet rubbed on her head kicks the movie off with a certain depraved bravado that actually piques some interest but it's just all for naught.

It's difficult to rip so hard on this picture because I'm such a foaming-at-the-mouth fanatic for Takashi Miike but that's not going to keep me from being real about how below mediocre this particular piece is.  Check out his ""Kikoku"" instead, not only one of his most personally accomplished masterpieces but one of the most phenomenal additions to modern filmmaking in recent years.

Oh yeah, I gave it the rating I did because in my mind it would be solidly planted somewhere in that nebulous place between two and three stars, so I just gave it the benefit of three stars out of respect to the man himself.",1184716800,,2283,4.88860103626943
