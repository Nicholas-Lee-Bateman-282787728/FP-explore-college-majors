8399088,5,B003KX4Q7M,Nice documentary of what it's like to go to that tournament in Arizona.,1437868800,,71,4.538461538461538
8399089,5,B003KX4Q7M,"Faded Glory is a movie for everyone. While it's main storyline has to do with a Baseball team, the themes, dreams, and real life experiences relate to all of us. As a 46 year old ex-jock who still ""laces"" them up, I loved the stories of heart ache and achievements, lost love, and sucessful romances, wild party boys, and strict regimen followers. The movie was able to combine comedy, laughter, sadness and even tragedy into a well organized film. This movie should hit a nerve in all of us, in one way or another.",1324339200,,515,4.48936170212766
8399090,5,B003KX4Q7M,"This documentary amply demonstrates that the competitive spirit still thrives even after skills have been diminished by age and injury, and, that it takes more than skill to win the game.  But, the deeper story is the relationship between Rick and his father.  It's a love letter from a son to his father.",1295913600,,305,4.735849056603773
8399091,5,B003KX4Q7M,"If you like middle aged men reminiscing about their glory days before they screwed up their lives - and want to see what the years do to a recreational baseball team, Rick Cohen's ""Faded Glory"" will work for you. Cohen assembles his aging Bad News Bears baseball team and tries to take them back to a championship. A charismatic, self-centered and irrepressible former actor, Cohen bulldozes arthritic joints, pulled muscles, and various addictions to a victory that almost could have been sponsored by AARP.  I was hurting just watching them, not to mention the in-need-of-much-therapy family dramas of all the men. Seriously, a not bad documentary about baseball, guys, and redemption. I'd watch it again and recommend it to others.",1295913600,,734,5.116666666666666
8399092,4,B003KX4Q7M,"This movie should serve as an inspiration for anyone who wants to believe they are never too old for ""x"". The stories from the collection of players is guaranteed to hit some nerve in the life of any viewer.",1295827200,,207,4.333333333333333
8399093,1,B003KX4Q7M,"Saw this at the Plaza Theatre in Atlanta.

Boring.  Horrible editing.  Shot with crappy camcorders.

I cannot imagine how anyone who isn't related to or sleeping with Rick Cohen
found this entertaining.",1288915200,,202,5.21875
8399094,5,B003KX4Q7M,"Great documentary film from the super-talented Rick Cohen.  Who doesn't want to go back and remember the ""good ole days""?  This is a wonderful film about the lives of a mismatched yet super-loyal baseball team that just wants the one last championship trophy.  Rick takes us on their journey filled with laughter, tears, failures, and triumph all expertly told in his voice.  It isn't just about baseball - it is about the players, their lives, and the paths they all walked on from the first pitch to the final inning.  Simply wonderful!",1282608000,,538,4.804347826086956
8399095,5,B003KX4Q7M,As a former athelete this film really spoke to me. The concept of trying to repair ones life through adult activities really hit home with me.,1282176000,,142,4.5
8399096,4,B003KX4Q7M,A great sports film about baseball... made by baseball players for baseball players and those who love them!  It's never too late and you are never too old to relive the glory days!,1281484800,2,181,4.484848484848484
