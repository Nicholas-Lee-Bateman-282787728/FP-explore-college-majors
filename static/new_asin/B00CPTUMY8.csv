5734413,5,B00CPTUMY8,I grew up watching these every Tuesday evening and this takes me back to a much simpler era but better quality television drama.,1391644800,4,128,4.608695652173913
5734414,5,B00CPTUMY8,"I purchased the 5th season of  Combat because I had thoroughly enjoyed the other seasons.  I have not been disappointed in any of  the Combat DVDs.  Combat along with many other shows of the 60s help make the ""Golden Age"" of television.",1391040000,3,236,4.5476190476190474
5734415,4,B00CPTUMY8,"I like more story content than embellishment of this series.  I don't really have a preference of b & w over color.  Season 5 dvds are very clear, the  color realistic and audio was crisp. The extra notes and commentary, etc. are very interesting and alert the viewer to watch for discrepancies the next time the discs are viewed; the bloopers and misses don't really take away from the story lines, rather they show how much attention or lack or attention was paid to details by producers. I like the fact that the episodes are self contained and not ongoing plot lines invloving regular cast members. You can select an individual story and not worry about what happened leading up to the episode.  Having a completely season in one box is preferable to having to deal with half season offerings. The big minus is lack of a definitive index of episodes on the box jacket or on the discs themselves.",1384128000,5,899,4.6
5734416,5,B00CPTUMY8,My dad really enjoyed watching Combat when it was on TV so he was thrilled be able to see them again.  The quality is great and the price was right!,1383350400,2,148,3.933333333333333
5734417,5,B00CPTUMY8,I love the shows and in color thank you! I was in the eighth grade and use to watch combat. I thought I seen all the shows but I guess I was wrong. I must of been to busy in school because I do not remember one show.,1380499200,2,216,3.5208333333333335
5734428,5,B00CPTUMY8,WONDERFUL! We got two of the series but I believe this is the one that is in color.  That's cool when you are used to watching Saunders and the Lt. in black and white and suddenly get to view the color version.  :),1421712000,,214,3.953488372093023

5734431,5,B00CPTUMY8,"This the first season for color, and Combat fans are split on whether they prefer this or b/w.  The disks are quality, but I agree with a previous review that noted that not having the episodes in broadcast order on the disks is weird, but not critical.  As for the season itself, it was the last season for the series and, as explained in the ""behind the scenes"" feature, some of the financial and operational happenings on the show start to show up.  Rick Jason and Vic Morrow both demanded significant raises for Season 5 ($10,000 per episode each was big money in mid-60's).  Apparently to save money, the two are rarely in the same episode, and the other original regulars -- Pierre Jalbert, Jack Hogan, Conlan Carter, Dick Peabody -- appearances become more sporadic, and William Bryant emerges as a new (and presumably cheaper) regular as Pvt. McCall.  They also moved a lot of shooting from the MGM lot to the CBS sound studios which -- in color -- starts to look chintzy, and also Franklin canyon, where they seem to end up in the same drainage ditch attacking the same building episode after episode.",1420070400,,1110,4.642857142857143

5734433,4,B00CPTUMY8,"Was very excited to receive Combat season five, received very quickly after ordering, packaged well and I have enjoyed the first few episodes, cant wait to see them all. The quality is excellent and to see the show in colour is a bonus. I can highly recommend these discs and Combat season five. I now have season one and Two and five so will order three and four.",1416096000,,364,4.367647058823529

5734436,5,B00CPTUMY8,"Combat Season 5 was the last season of the series from ABC and the only one in Color. Guest stars this season were, Bill Bixby, Claude Akins, Fernando Lamas(father of actor Lorenzo Lamas), Ted Knight, Fritz Weaver, Peter Haskell, Randy Boone, William Schallert, Mike Farrell, Robert Duvall, Ricardo Montalban, Telly Savalas, James MacArthur(of Hawaii 5-O), Tom Skerritt, Gavin McLeod, Dennis Hopper, Noah Beery(of Rockford Files), Claudine Longet, and William Campbell(of Star Trek). Combat shows WW2 in France from the infantry soldiers perspective. Combat shows war in a masculine, realistic, uncompromising, tough, graphic(for 1960s television), but also patriotic way, something that Hollywood would probably not be able to replicate today in our politically correct society. Most episodes are action packed and the addition of color gives this season the sense that you are watching a movie instead of a TV series. There are extra features: Audio Commentaries, Photo Galleries, and a couple of extras about the switch to Color.
The DVD packaging is not that good. Combat season 5 was originally split into  2 releases on DVD, Combat Season 5 Invasion 1 (4 DVDs) , and Combat Season 5 Invasion 2 (4 DVDs) in 2005 by Image Entertainment. In 2013 Image Entertainment Re-released Combat season 5 in one release titled Combat The Complete Fifth Season, with 8 DVDs. This release is exactly the same as the 2005 season 5 release, in fact Image Entertainment didn't bother renaming the individual DVDs, they still say Combat Season 5 Invasion 1 etc instead of The Complete Fifth Season on the menu screen. Also the episodes are not in Broadcast order and there is no episode guide. This is annoying as it wouldn't have cost Image very much to include this on the packaging. I had to create my on episode guide and print it out and fold it in half and tuck it in the inside front of the DVD case so I can keep track of the episodes I have watched. You can go to JoDavidsmeyer(dot)com/combat/episodes/episode_guide.html to get the episode guide. Jo Davidsmeyer wrote the book COMBAT! A Viewer's Companion to the WWII TV Series available on Amazon. They must have been in a hurry to repackage this and sell it and spend the bare minimum producing it. At least they used higher quality pressed DVDs as opposed to M.O.D. burned DVDs. The picture quality is good, not as good as the Mission Impossible TV series but still pretty good for an old Black & White TV series. Run time on these episodes is approximately 51 minutes as opposed to the approximately 47 minutes of the Black & White seasons.
Do not buy Combat Season 5 Invasion 1 (4 DVDs) , and Combat Season 5 Invasion 2 (4 DVDs) these are too expensive. Look for The Complete Fifth Season, The Complete Fourth Season etc on the outside DVD packaging as these are a lot cheaper than the split season, they will cost you about a third of the price of the original split season releases.",1404604800,4,2934,4.844621513944223

8584842,4,B00CPTUMY8,"Combat is a great show and love it . This was the final season in color and the weakest . They seem to have a New channel ( moved from ABC to CBS )and a new producer for this season . I rented this season from the library and glad I did . There's only a handful of episodes that are very good , they do seem to give Kirby and Little John more screen time in this season but none on Caje which is missed . They repackaged these seasons a few years ago which is good in one way , but no episode guide, so You don't know what's on each disc and also no CC either. In this season also they seem to film at different places than the past filming at State Parks  with more money in the budget as well , but times were changing with the Viet Nam war and the war on violence on TV , there's more dialogue than action  in this season . To Me Combat should had stayed in Black and White , it gave it that WW-2 feel that so many films did .Combat still is the longest running WW-2 series ever on TV and was the best .",1421712000,2,1006,3.7857142857142856
