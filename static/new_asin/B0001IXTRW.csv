8013197,1,B0001IXTRW,"Border Warz is such a terrible attempt at movie making that I have no idea how it ended up on DVD.  Shot entirely in Arizona, the film deals with a group of friends that find themselves in over their heads with a border crime boss.

The friends are bound together by Fabiola, a college student who captures the lives of her friends on camcorder as part of an ongoing project.  Fabiola is portrayed by the gorgeous Adrianne Bottrell, who makes her acting debut in this movie.  Which leads to my next point: About 90% of the cast in this movie had never appeared in film or television before.  The majority of the cast also hasn't appeared in any movies after this one, with the exception of Jon Proudstar.

Acting aside, this film serves as a how-to guide to bad movie making.  The cameras are constantly shaking, especially during driving and horseback scenes.  The audio quality is horrible, the voice dubbing is awful, and the lighting (or lack thereof) is terrible.  One scene involving a ""rave"" becomes laughable as the director inexplicably includes footage of a 60 year old grandmother hanging out at the club.

The only thing that even makes this movie tolerable, besides sexy Adrianne Bottrell and the decent screen presence of Jon Proudstar, is that the film is shot in some legitimately seedy looking border areas.  Aside from that, it's like a painfully bad home movie shot for Youtube.  It's only worth owning as an unintentional comedy.",1265760000,2,1449,4.775100401606426
