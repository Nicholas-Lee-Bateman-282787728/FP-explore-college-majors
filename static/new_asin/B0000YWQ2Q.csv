8004688,1,B0000YWQ2Q,This video was an abomination.  The video was absolutely worthless and the redhead was a huge loser and disappointment to the video. Her dancing:PATHETIC.  Poorly constructed and needs tons of work. SNOWMAN OUT,1293321600,,210,5.333333333333333

8004690,5,B0000YWQ2Q,"I work for a health communications company and received a review copy of this video in the course of doing research on childhood obesity. My coworkers and I thought the program was well-crafted but were uncertain about how well it would achieve it's goal of motivating kids to get moving. Luckily, I have a built-in focus group at home consisting of twin seven-year-old girls. Needless to say, they loved it. They must have watched the program at least 5 times over the course of a few days. They memorized the routines and even took notes on healthy snacks. When it was time for me to return the tape to it's rightful owner they asked me if there were any other episodes of the program available. As a parent I consider that a ringing endorsement.",1092182400,3,748,4.58955223880597
