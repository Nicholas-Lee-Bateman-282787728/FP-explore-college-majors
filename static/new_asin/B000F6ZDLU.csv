8118129,5,B000F6ZDLU,"When I considered ordering this DVD there were no reviews yet but I ordered it anyway, and I'm glad I did.  It is a very well done documentary, accurate and interesting.  The scenes showing Sledge himself are great.  I am a former Marine and I've studied USMC history for many years, and I only noticed one very minor mistake; at one point the narrator stated that Sledge's rank was never higher than PFC but later correctly says that he eventually made corporal.  Overall, an outstanding documentary that I highly recommend.",1473292800,4,525,4.8
