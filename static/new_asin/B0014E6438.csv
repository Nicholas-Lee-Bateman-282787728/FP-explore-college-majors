3131102,5,B0014E6438,"I have loved this series from the first episode I watched - which was actually the second ep of the first season.  I think the entire cast was very well put together, each one showing their strengths. I'd never say that it was great acting, but it was fun and a period piece with a little humor thrown into the drama that often occurred.  I really REALLY hope that this will be released soon. I bought the first season the day it came out and have been waiting eagerly for the rest of the series. What is taking so long???",1210032000,17,522,4.21
3131103,5,B0014E6438,"The Young Riders is must see TV.  On today's TV there is a lack of good clean!! family TV shows.  This series showed that you could have romance and adventure without the rated r scenes.

Please release the rest of the series soon!!!!",1209081600,16,234,4.395348837209302

3131106,5,B0014E6438,They really messed up by waiting so long to release season two.  This was a great show and I don't understand why it's taking them so long to release all the seasons on dvd.,1208131200,40,173,4.088235294117647
3131107,4,B0014E6438,"Do you remember Bonanza?  There would always be some new adventure with one or another (or a combination) of the main characters, but the basis of that show was characters that we grew to know and love.  Ben Cartwright could always be counted on (well, almost always) for his wisdom, foresight and compassion.  Hoss would give us a laugh, Little Joe would screw something up (again!) and Adam would shoot somebody or beat them up.

Similarly, The Young Riders is character-based.  Most shows that tend to move us and we grow attached to are.  Sure, there's lots of action, beautiful locations and great production values but if the people we see on the screen are flat, one-dimensional characters that we honestly couldn't care less about, we probably wouldn't develop any feeling for them.  For instance, Teaspoon (so marvellously portrayed by Anthony Zerbe) would seem, on the surface, to be pretty one-dimensional.  But, as time goes by and we learn more about him and his past, as he shows us what kind of person he is and see, to some extent, some of the events that shaped him into that person, we see that he is actually far more complex than can be seen by the naked eye.

Unfortunately, for some reason, SONY PICTURES HAS DECIDED THAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THE REST OF THIS SHOW!!!  We've been waiting years since Season One was released for the other two to appear.  PLEASE, SONY PICTURES!  WE WANT THIS!
How much longer?!",1208044800,62,1431,4.68
3131108,5,B0014E6438,This is a wonderful series & it is a shame to only release the first season.  Fans have been waiting for two years to have the 2nd and 3rd seasons released.  Please release seasons 2 & 3 of this GREAT series soon.,1207699200,52,213,4.0476190476190474

3131113,5,B0014E6438,"As others have said here these seasons of the Young Riders are missing episodes, the first disc of season 2 has 2 episodes missing. They are listed on the disc but not there to view. Do I care, yes and no, I got what I paid for, I read the reviews about the missing episodes and still decided to get the set. I got the complete series for under $24. Missing 4 episodes out of 3 seasons fairly good odds. If you just want to get caught up on a great show by the sets. Or you can hold out hoping that the people in charge will actually do a proper box set, there's a better chance that seaquest season 3 will be available in the USA even though you can get it in other countries. Someday I hope to figure out why overseas gets the American shows before we do.",1452297600,2,757,4.0198675496688745

3131118,4,B0014E6438,Every Sunday night at 8:30pm I was glued to the TV waiting for the next adventure in The Young Riders series. I do have a couple of episodes on VHS tape that I was able to record ( over 20 years ago) I was so excited when I was able to purchase the first season from Amazon and I had waited very un- patiently  since for the second and third season. Finally they have been released but why has the second season been cut from 22 episodes to 18???? If it is a music copyright issue why wasn't it addressed over 20 years ago????? Release the 22 episode edition and I'll throw my money at you until then I'll live in my young riders mind palace. Kylie,1449964800,,648,4.102362204724409

I knew that they didn't hire Rachel right away and there was a cranky lady before her. I also remembered that Noah just didn't appear out of nowhere. This is one of my favorite series so I was confused as to what happened. What sell the season 2 of the Young Riders without all the episodes, why not just wait and then sell it.

3131136,4,B0014E6438,I love this series so it was great to see it again. It's just a pity episode 1 is missing and 3 other episodes. But that's due to copyright issues. But I did find the missing episodes in parts 1-5 on YouTube,1435363200,,207,3.9523809523809526

3131138,2,B0014E6438,"What a bummer....This is a rating for the actual quality of the DVDs not Young Riders. The quality of these episodes are not taken off any original master. More like from a 2nd or 3rd generation source. They are low resolution and there is massive pixelation. They almost look like pirated copies from a VHS source. The sound is also muddy and in mono. This series was made in and broadcasted in full stereo sound. The now first out of print Season 1 box set from MGM is far superior to the quality of this set. Seriously, in the age of HD big screens and home theater, we get an image that looks like a cell phone transfer? The distributor needs a new quality control person. I'm assuming the last season is the same way so I'm going to skip even getting it.",1434067200,2,759,4.314685314685315

Since they removed the most important episode of this season(episode 1), those who didn't see it before are confused by suddenly meeting Noah and Rachel, who are introduced in Season 2 episode 1. I am glad that I have it, but now, I must wait for Amazon to get the COMPLETE season two before I can fully enjoy it.....In other words, more money out of my pocket.",1429660800,,496,4.522222222222222

Why would you spend your money on something if you are not getting the complete package. It is ridiculous and misleading. You wouldn't buy half a horse, half a car, or half a house. I paid the  same money for this partial box as I did a complete box. I was unaware that it had to say complete on it in order for it to be complete. Why offer it, unless you say that is not complete. Again why would you buy it if it wasn't complete. It is very misleading. You should state that it is not. But why sell it like that. IF you are buying the season you want the whole thing, not partial. It should all be there without the box having to say complete.",1413936000,5,744,4.027027027027027

3131164,5,B0014E6438,"Same review from season one: I still enjoy this show even if it is a little cheesy. It's not Walker Texas Ranger goofy but it's very ""expected."" It is a western so there is shooting but nothing so violent that I can't share it with my niece and nephew (9-7 years). Because it's a western, you can't tell that it's over 20 years old. The only problem with the box set is some episodes are missing. I believe it's due to licensing issues. If you aren't familiar with the show, it makes for choppy plot lines going from Season 1 to 2. I also noticed the order of the episodes played in a different order from what was listed on the box. Seems like they had an amateur proof these. But otherwise it's a solid set. I purchased Seasons 1-3 and I'm very happy with all. Kind of wish the show ran longer.

As a side note, the characters based on historical figures has inspired my young nephew to read more books on Wild Bill, William F. Cody, the Pony Express and life in the west. Can't complain about a show that inspires reading and education!",1410393600,,1039,4.301020408163265

3131167,5,B0014E6438,"Rider Coming! Two words that make my heart flutter like a teenage girl again! These riders were the men of my girlish fantasies. Imperfect and human, these heroes rode to my rescue weekly. Watching them now on DVD is like finding long lost friends. Hickok, brash and loyal, a man of action. Cody, a cocky yet lovable goof. Kid, whose Dudley-Do-Right attitude and devotion to his horse are even more alluring now than they were when I was a teen. Lou, strong and independent, a role model to look up to. Ike, earnest and sweet, with a truly sensitive soul. Buck, my favorite, dark, handsome and steadfast; his Kiowa side adding some mystery.  Noah, angry and cynical but with a good heart, always ready for fight. Teaspoon, a true sage, who is tough when he needs to be and gruffly sweet the rest of the time. These characters were so well defined and portrayed that they really seem to live. Watching today as a modern viewer the show is just as good as I remember it, or almost as good, as I am no longer a young cute thing who can imagine myself in all of the female roles! This is the romantic Old West. Men were men. Heroes were heroes. Is it a little bit sweet for today's jaded viewers? Maybe. But I for one am tired of abrasive shows full of profanity and gore, whose goal is to shock audiences. It's nice to  take a vacation to Sweetwater  in the 1860's with its epic scenery (filmed in Mescal, Arizona) for a moment, knowing I can return to modern day conveniences whenever I want. And it makes me happy to think that Teaspoon's boys will always be waiting anytime I want to visit. Riding off into the sunset with a ""Ride safe, son.""",1406937600,4,1642,4.394736842105263

Unfortunately, the reality is that a lot of it is over-acted, the shoot-out scenes specifically. It seems to be the same formula - bad guys threaten one of the riders or someone they care about, relevant rider gets into trouble, all the riders combine forces to overcome. Fairly boring, certainly not the riveting episodes I remember. I think it is best to leave the past in the past and remember the goods bits as being great!",1399852800,,555,4.616161616161616

3131182,4,B0014E6438,"MGM released Season 1 in 2007, I guess it didn't do too well...and never bothered with the final two seasons. TGG Direct (whoever they are) has finally released all three- in 1,3,2 order with 4 episodes missing from Season 2.
 The stories aren't bad, watching the DVD sets I can remember some details even 20 years later. If you like a western type story you'll want this set and will likely want sets 1 & 3 as well.
Go ahead and get it, no point in waiting any longer because we probably won't ever see Season 2 released with all 22 episodes included.
My recommendation; get the MGM release of Season 1 because it has better packaging, better sound quality (and closed captioning if you need it, TGG didn't bother with that) and much better chapter divisions to the episodes (if TGG even bothered they didn't put in as many- they help you to find a favored episode segment easier when they're present) even though it'll cost you more. For Seasons 2 & 3 you'll have to go with TGG, you'll do all right with what you'll get, they just didn't put the effort out on ""their"" editions.",1396483200,,1080,4.454545454545454

I love the series. Maybe it was just the time in my life but I enjoyed the mix of history (some fairly accurate, some a little off) and adventure stories in the show.

Pros:
Character interaction was good.
History was an added plus, When my children watched them with me, we got to go look up some of the references. What they don't teach in school any more......
Camera work was excellent.
The location was well chosen.
Music and sound effects were (mostly) appropriate and well timed.
Travis Fine being able to convey so much with no words.
The other actors (especially Gregg Rainwater) truly acting like they were trying to understand what the mute character of Ike was trying to convey and making it work.

Cons:
Some of the ""messages"" were too in-your-face, rather than an integrated part of the story.

If you like shows where the characters have each other's backs, have good intentions, try to make up for their mistakes, and have the courage to help out each other and other people, this is the perfect place to lose yourself in a world where the good guys mostly win.",1388188800,,1177,4.485981308411215

3131206,3,B0014E6438,"This is definitely a bare bones, no extras set; 4 discs (18 episodes) housed in 2 plastic dvd cases, each holding 2 discs (1 on each side), slipped inside a cardboard housing.  Each disc has a play all or a select episode option; each episode cannot be searched by chapter (there is only 1 skip available, between the main series weekly opening credits and the episode start itself); no episode info, other than title.  Each episode runs around 48 minutes which would indicate that, considering when it originally aired (1990-91), that these are the full, not syndicated episodes.  Sound is Dolby Digital Mono with no subtitles.  The quality of the 4x3 aspect picture is overall relatively poor, especially on a big screen.  Interior scenes are crisper and warmer of color; most exterior shots, especially those with skyline backdrops, look like a second generation vhs tape: very grainy and quite washed out, with very soft, not crisp images.  Dropouts and dirt on the transfer aren't noticeably distracting.  Of course there is a lot of complaining about the 4 missing episodes of this season 2 set, but Im just happy the rest are released; considering the probably low demand  for this set of dvds (in this era of downloads), along with the low price, it will not make the releasing studio much profit.",1386201600,3,1305,4.873303167420814

3131208,4,B0014E6438,"This particular set of season 2 is kind of odd. First, the packaging is an actual box, the lift the lid off the top kind of box. This just makes it a tad more complicated to get to the individual discs, but at least it's the same size as the regular DVD set boxes. Second thing is that four of the episodes aren't included, but they ARE available for free viewing on both Hulu and Netflix (as of November 2013) so why the exclusion on the DVDs?

Beyond those two points, the set is good. Very few playback hitches (which seem common in just about every DVD these days) and after a few episodes, I didn't even care that it was formatted for the pre-HD TV sets. The image quality is very low, but the show was made on film in the early 90s, so I can't complain. At least we finally have (most of) season two on DVD!!

She bought me the first season a few Christmas's ago and I watch them all the time. We have been waiting soooo long for the next seasons to come out.

Sure the characters are fictional, but they do a great job showing us what the pony express what like.  Three is bonding.  All these kids are messed up in some way and have to grow up fast, depending on each other, learning to live right.  What a great story!  There's hope that messed up people can be overcomers.  Four is wholesome reality.  Their lives were hard, no doubt about it, but the show is not overly graphic.  It's done in good taste.  With all the filthy crap on TV today, this show is really refreshing.  Please, please, please release the rest of the seasons or the entire show.  I bought season one, but if they released the entire show, I would buy it and then give season one away as a gift, so some young person could get a chance to see a wholesome show for once.",1237248000,5,952,4.299435028248587

3131264,5,B0014E6438,"I was 10 years old when The Young Riders hit the television airwaves for the first time.  Eighteen years later, I still remember specific scenes and moments from all three seasons because the characters were created so well.  Not only did the writers clearly take time to research (and, like any show of course, pick and choose what they wanted to present for entertainment's sake!) but the actors clearly built on their characters, grew into them, and with them.  (It helps, too, that so much of the cast was terribly attractive!)

While only season one is currently out on dvd, a web search will show that the fans of this serious are starving for seasons 2 and 3, for the character development, the fun, the camaraderie, and heck, just completing the sets they began when season 1 came out 2 years ago.  Will it be a blockbuster seller?  Perhaps not, but the fans have been wanting this for, literally, more than a decade, going on two, (1989- first airing, and it's 2008 as I write this 'review') so you know you have, at least, a solid fan-base!  (And you can't argue against the fact that far less worthy shows have been made into DVDs and sold just fine.)

The Season 1 DVDs have no extras, so we can only hope that Season 2 will improve on that (but, as the myriad of enthusiastic fans prove, we'll settle for just the DVDs.)",1214784000,12,1333,4.5020746887966805

3365604,4,B0014E6438,"Do you remember Bonanza?  There would always be some new adventure with one or another (or a combination) of the main characters, but the basis of that show was characters that we grew to know and love.  Ben Cartwright could always be counted on (well, almost always) for his wisdom, foresight and compassion.  Hoss would give us a laugh, Little Joe would screw something up (again!) and Adam would shoot somebody or beat them up.

Similarly, The Young Riders is character-based.  Most shows that tend to move us and we grow attached to are.  Sure, there's lots of action, beautiful locations and great production values but if the people we see on the screen are flat, one-dimensional characters that we honestly couldn't care less about, we probably wouldn't develop any feeling for them.  For instance, Teaspoon (so marvellously portrayed by Anthony Zerbe) would seem, on the surface, to be pretty one-dimensional.  But, as time goes by and we learn more about him and his past, as he shows us what kind of person he is and see, to some extent, some of the events that shaped him into that person, we see that he is actually far more complex than can be seen by the naked eye.

Unfortunately, for some reason, SONY PICTURES HAS DECIDED THAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THE REST OF THIS SHOW!!!  We've been waiting years since Season One was released for the other two to appear.  PLEASE, SONY PICTURES!  WE WANT THIS!

I got the complete series for under $24. Missing 4 episodes out of 3 seasons fairly good odds. If you just want to get caught up on a great show by the sets. Or you can hold out hoping that the people in charge will actually do a proper box set, there's a better chance that seaquest season 3 will be available in the USA even though you can get it in other countries.

I paid the  same money for this partial box as I did a complete box. I was unaware that it had to say complete on it in order for it to be complete. Why offer it, unless you say that is not complete.

3365661,5,B0014E6438,"Same review from season one: I still enjoy this show even if it is a little cheesy. It's not Walker Texas Ranger goofy but it's very ""expected."" It is a western so there is shooting but nothing so violent that I can't share it with my niece and nephew (9-7 years). Because it's a western, you can't tell that it's over 20 years old. The only problem with the box set is some episodes are missing. I believe it's due to licensing issues. If you aren't familiar with the show, it makes for choppy plot lines going from Season 1 to 2. I also noticed the order of the episodes played in a different order from what was listed on the box. Seems like they had an amateur proof these. But otherwise it's a solid set. I purchased Seasons 1-3 and I'm very happy with all. Kind of wish the show ran longer.

As a side note, the characters based on historical figures has inspired my young nephew to read more books on Wild Bill, William F. Cody, the Pony Express and life in the west. Can't complain about a show that inspires reading and education!",1410393600,,1039,4.301020408163265

3365664,5,B0014E6438,"Rider Coming! Two words that make my heart flutter like a teenage girl again! These riders were the men of my girlish fantasies. Imperfect and human, these heroes rode to my rescue weekly. Watching them now on DVD is like finding long lost friends. Hickok, brash and loyal, a man of action. Cody, a cocky yet lovable goof. Kid, whose Dudley-Do-Right attitude and devotion to his horse are even more alluring now than they were when I was a teen. Lou, strong and independent, a role model to look up to. Ike, earnest and sweet, with a truly sensitive soul. Buck, my favorite, dark, handsome and steadfast; his Kiowa side adding some mystery.  Noah, angry and cynical but with a good heart, always ready for fight. Teaspoon, a true sage, who is tough when he needs to be and gruffly sweet the rest of the time. These characters were so well defined and portrayed that they really seem to live. Watching today as a modern viewer the show is just as good as I remember it, or almost as good, as I am no longer a young cute thing who can imagine myself in all of the female roles! This is the romantic Old West. Men were men. Heroes were heroes. Is it a little bit sweet for today's jaded viewers? Maybe. But I for one am tired of abrasive shows full of profanity and gore, whose goal is to shock audiences. It's nice to  take a vacation to Sweetwater  in the 1860's with its epic scenery (filmed in Mescal, Arizona) for a moment, knowing I can return to modern day conveniences whenever I want. And it makes me happy to think that Teaspoon's boys will always be waiting anytime I want to visit. Riding off into the sunset with a ""Ride safe, son.""",1406937600,4,1642,4.394736842105263

 The stories aren't bad, watching the DVD sets I can remember some details even 20 years later. If you like a western type story you'll want this set and will likely want sets 1 & 3 as well.
Go ahead and get it, no point in waiting any longer because we probably won't ever see Season 2 released with all 22 episodes included.
My recommendation; get the MGM release of Season 1 because it has better packaging, better sound quality (and closed captioning if you need it, TGG didn't bother with that) and much better chapter divisions to the episodes (if TGG even bothered they didn't put in as many- they help you to find a favored episode segment easier when they're present) even though it'll cost you more.

I love the series. Maybe it was just the time in my life but I enjoyed the mix of history (some fairly accurate, some a little off) and adventure stories in the show.

Pros:
Character interaction was good.
History was an added plus, When my children watched them with me, we got to go look up some of the references. What they don't teach in school any more......
Camera work was excellent.
The location was well chosen.
Music and sound effects were (mostly) appropriate and well timed.
Travis Fine being able to convey so much with no words.
The other actors (especially Gregg Rainwater) truly acting like they were trying to understand what the mute character of Ike was trying to convey and making it work.

Cons:
Some of the ""messages"" were too in-your-face, rather than an integrated part of the story.

If you like shows where the characters have each other's backs, have good intentions, try to make up for their mistakes, and have the courage to help out each other and other people, this is the perfect place to lose yourself in a world where the good guys mostly win.",1388188800,,1177,4.485981308411215

Sound is Dolby Digital Mono with no subtitles.  The quality of the 4x3 aspect picture is overall relatively poor, especially on a big screen.  Interior scenes are crisper and warmer of color; most exterior shots, especially those with skyline backdrops, look like a second generation vhs tape: very grainy and quite washed out, with very soft, not crisp images.  Dropouts and dirt on the transfer aren't noticeably distracting.  Of course there is a lot of complaining about the 4 missing episodes of this season 2 set, but Im just happy the rest are released; considering the probably low demand  for this set of dvds (in this era of downloads), along with the low price, it will not make the releasing studio much profit.",1386201600,3,1305,4.873303167420814

Second thing is that four of the episodes aren't included, but they ARE available for free viewing on both Hulu and Netflix (as of November 2013) so why the exclusion on the DVDs?

Beyond those two points, the set is good. Very few playback hitches (which seem common in just about every DVD these days) and after a few episodes, I didn't even care that it was formatted for the pre-HD TV sets. The image quality is very low, but the show was made on film in the early 90s, so I can't complain. At least we finally have (most of) season two on DVD!!

All these kids are messed up in some way and have to grow up fast, depending on each other, learning to live right.  What a great story!  There's hope that messed up people can be overcomers.  Four is wholesome reality.  Their lives were hard, no doubt about it, but the show is not overly graphic.  It's done in good taste.  With all the filthy crap on TV today, this show is really refreshing.  Please, please, please release the rest of the seasons or the entire show.

3365761,5,B0014E6438,"I was 10 years old when The Young Riders hit the television airwaves for the first time.  Eighteen years later, I still remember specific scenes and moments from all three seasons because the characters were created so well.  Not only did the writers clearly take time to research (and, like any show of course, pick and choose what they wanted to present for entertainment's sake!) but the actors clearly built on their characters, grew into them, and with them.  (It helps, too, that so much of the cast was terribly attractive!)

While only season one is currently out on dvd, a web search will show that the fans of this serious are starving for seasons 2 and 3, for the character development, the fun, the camaraderie, and heck, just completing the sets they began when season 1 came out 2 years ago.  Will it be a blockbuster seller?  Perhaps not, but the fans have been wanting this for, literally, more than a decade, going on two, (1989- first airing, and it's 2008 as I write this 'review') so you know you have, at least, a solid fan-base!  (And you can't argue against the fact that far less worthy shows have been made into DVDs and sold just fine.)

The Season 1 DVDs have no extras, so we can only hope that Season 2 will improve on that (but, as the myriad of enthusiastic fans prove, we'll settle for just the DVDs.)",1214784000,12,1333,4.5020746887966805
