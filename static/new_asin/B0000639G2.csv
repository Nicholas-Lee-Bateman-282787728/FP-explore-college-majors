1690100,5,B0000639G2,"I highly recomend the Firm to anyone, who like me, has a hard time keeping weight off through regular methods (gyms, aroebics, running, etc). I was a member of the actual Firm gym in Columbia, SC about 10 years ago while in college so I know first hand how effective this workout is. I do not know how these tapes produce such beautiful results, but they do! You will sweat like you never have before and feel exausted, but after a while they get easier and your body looks amazing. There is no magic pill out there that will make you look and feel healthy. It takes hard work and determination and a workout program that is safe and done by people who understand the female bodyand metabolism(although men would get awsome results too if they could actually get through a workout!) And for those that have a difficult time understanding the Southern drawls, trust me, they are not that thick. The ladies on the videos are very relaxing and motivating to listen too and watch. Also, the music is a little cheesy but at least it is not loud and obnoxious. I am just greatful to have found them after being without for almost 10 years!",1020384000,15,1133,4.478260869565218
1690101,4,B0000639G2,"Let me preface this by saying this is my first ""The Firm"" workout.  I know they have many out there and have been producing them for years.
I ordered this DVD after seeing ""The Firm"" infomercial on TV.  I had NO IDEA how hard it would be!  I have been doing other aerobic DVDs at home, but I was exhausted after the warm-up and first set of excercises The Firm has put together.
I think hard-core fitness buffs will be able to get the most out of this.  It is going to take me awhile to learn their lingo and master their moves.  It was difficult for me to even keep pace with them.  But, if you are experienced with combining weights with cardio, this is a great DVD.
I gave it four stars because it is an awesome, kick-butt workout; it would be helpful to have a couple of scenes just for beginners.  It is very important (for beginners)to watch their ""fitness training program"" before you attempt the workout.
The music is a little cheesy and it is hard to get used to their South Carolina drawls, but overall, a fantastic workout!",1019606400,14,1034,4.3264248704663215
1690131,5,B0000639G2,"I bought this about six years back and didn't always stick to it in the beginning; partly because, I agree, getting the hang of all the coordination can be pretty difficult. But with the mix of cardio, toning, and dance movies, (and now that I've done all the segments so much that I know the routines by heart)... this is still my go to video when I wanna whittle my waistline and build my cardio back up....",1306022400,,409,4.324675324675325
1690132,5,B0000639G2,"I consider myself a high-intermediate to advanced exerciser. I workout 6 times a week and lift fairly heavy. This workout kicked my butt! I was a hot mess through the whole thing. I loved the plyos. I do think that about the time you would give up, they lower the intensity to a small dance step and light weight segment, so that you can keep on keeping on. The ab segment wasn't worth the time, in my opinion, and the stretch was kind of weird for me. However, I don't buy workout DVD's for the stretches and you can do your own afterwards. In summary: It was the hardest workout I've ever done, alot of high-impact, and it's certainly challenging. I look forward to working on it and watching my improvement.",1289520000,4,710,4.427480916030534
1690133,5,B0000639G2,"I recommend this for someone who is at intermediate level - my heart rate remained at around 110 to 130 (my max is 150) so this may be a bit slow if you're at advance, and a beginner may find the fast pace a bit overwhelming

I love that I can customize the workout. As many of Firm workouts, it has both aerobics and weight training. There are about 14 segments plus a quick ab workout and yoga, each segment lasts 3-5 min, so I'm never bored. Definitely get this if you're an intermediate

1690134,1,B0000639G2,"The only good thing about this video is it's comic relief.  It really, really reminded me of the parody of an 80's aerobics video that Drew Barrymore did on SNL.  I have and like the cardio sculpt series, and I picked this up for some variety.  The cover makes it look like it was produced post 2000, but the video itself is early 90's at best.

But maybe I'm just unappreciative because I'm not coordinated?  This was very dancy and most all of the instructors seemed like former Texas cheerleaders.

Really, really bad.",1258329600,,521,4.548387096774194
1690135,3,B0000639G2,"I am a bit of a latecomer to this older Firm video.  Even though the dated look of the mansion-style Firms tends to put me off, I decided to try this DVD because 1) it was supposed to be intermediate-to-advanced, and 2) it was billed as offering 50 full minutes of cardio, something that is surprisingly hard to find in a video.

This DVD was compiled from various segments of older Firm workouts.  As such, it has four different instructors:  Allie Strickland (now DelRio), Carissa Foster, Dale Brabham, and Jennifer Carman.  For the most part, the transitions between the different segments/instructors flow smoothly, with the exception of a few instances (as noted below).  I have provided the approximate times for each segment, the instructor, and a brief description of the exercises below.  Equipment for this workout includes one set of light dumbbells, a short/low step (the Firm Fanny Lifter or other), and an optional weighted ball.

4m, Allie: 3m w/u includes toe taps & full form squats, etc.; ends w/45 seconds of stretching
3m, Allie: short box work with weights includes straddles w/biceps & squats w/overhead presses
3m, Allie: ball aerobics is high impact with jogs and power jogs (i.e., high knees)
2.5m, Allie: plyometrics; includes little jumps out in & bunny hops
Abrupt transition!
2.5m, Carissa:  floor aerobics with squats, lunges, kick-ball-changes
2m, Carissa:  short box work includes climbs, repeater glutes, & jacks
2.5m, Carissa:  ""impact aerobics""--little hops on toes with various punching movements
2.5m, Dale:  4-limb work includes side-back-side, front-back lunges, kicks
2.5m, Dale:  floor aerobics w/sambas, pivots, kicks, & hi/lo jacks
2.5m, Dale:  ""low impact"" aerobics w/hop steps, v-steps, & skips
2m, Dale:  4-limb work includes marches w/triple steps & power jumps
2m, Jennifer:  sports drills with balls includes shuffles, running, plyos
4.5m, Jennifer:  low impact aerobics w/hamstring curls, v-steps, & plyos (a lot of TIFTTing!)
2.5m, Jennifer:  short box work with turn shuffles, press steps, glute lifts, & mambos
3.5m, Jennifer:  4-limb work includes toe taps w/upright rows & hamstring curls with biceps
3.5m, Jennifer:  high impact aerobics includes jogs, knee ups, &kicks (felt like cheerleading)
3m, Jennifer:  4-limb work w/sambas, side-step-side, squat & overhead press
2.5m, Jennifer:  short box work with knee repeaters & heel digs
Abrupt transition!
1.5m, Jennifer:  quick stretch using step
2.5m, Jennifer:  abs work on floor, including obliques and brief plank work
3.5m, Carissa:  final stretch, including yoga-like moves (e.g., bow pose)

Overall, my impressions of this workout were mixed.  Here's what I liked/didn't like:

THE GOOD
*As mentioned above, I liked having a long cardio workout of decent intensity.
*I enjoyed the varied, short segments, as you are constantly changing things up, so you never really get bored (or, if you do, like I did with Jen's long take-it-from-the-top segment, you'll soon be moving on).
*I liked the different equipment changes; again, this variety helped keep the workout fun and interesting to me.  I do have the Firm Fanny Lifter, so I was able to use the low portion of this for the step work, but you could substitute any type of low step or even modify the step work to do on the floor.  I also really enjoy incorporating my medicine ball, but again, you could substitute a small dumbbell or skip the ball altogether if desired.
*Although some other reviewers complained that the warm-up was too short, I actually liked this; I find that some Firm warm-ups drag on.  I prefer to warm-up quickly and move right into the workout!
*I like that for the most part, the cardio is athletic in style.
*I enjoy doing the plyometrics.  I think that the instructors did a nice job with these, as they aren't too overwhelming--i.e., there are usually little breaks between each plyo set, allowing you to catch your breath.
*Finally, the programmable option.  The DVD allows users to choose from amongst the 17 different chapters to customize their own workout.

THE BAD
*Although the total workout time is reported on the DVD case as 63 minutes, with 49 minutes of cardio, my actual recorded times were 58 total minutes, with only 46.5 minutes of cardio--a good workout, but not quite the 55-60 minutes that I was hoping for.
*As mentioned, the cardio portion of this workout was shorter than I had expected.  I would have preferred to leave out the abs segment entirely--after all, the title of the DVD is ""Super Cardio Mix.""  Give us more cardio!
*An ongoing issue that I have with The Firm is their overly choreographed arms movements--this was especially evident in Jen's one high impact segment, which made me feel like I should be on the sidelines of a football field. :(
*Although I liked the plyos, I didn't like all of the other high impact work, especially the high jogs, etc.; combined with the cheesy outfits and the overdone set, these moves made the workout feel even more dated to me (the actual release date for this workout is 1999, although the segments are taken from previously-released videos).  However, experienced exercisers like myself should find it fairly easy to modify the workout to suit their own tastes as I did.
*For the most part, the music really was not very good; the best I can say is that it sounded like upbeat elevator music.  One of Carissa's segments, which included some vocals, was a bit better.
*Finally, although this DVD is programmable, it is otherwise not very user-friendly.  The Main Menu does appear immediately when you start the DVD, but if you select ""Play Workout,"" you are forced to watch outdated Firm advertising that you can't skip or fast-forward through.

In summary, this workout was a bit of a disappointment, mainly because the cardio wasn't quite as long as I was hoping for.  However, I am keeping this video for now, as I did enjoy the variety of the different segments, and I think with the programmable feature, I can find a way to make this DVD work for me.",1254182400,11,6025,4.9969939879759515
1690136,5,B0000639G2,"Let me start off by saying I love this workout!  It is the toughest and highest calorie-burning cardio workout I own.

This video is a 60-minute, customizable cardio workout.  It was made in the late 90's, so the outfits and music are a bit dated - I find them to be entertaining.

The equipment used include a short step (6 inches), a weighted ball (2-3 lbs) and light dumbbells (3-5 lbs).  However, the step is used for less than half of the workout and you could perform all the moves without it, of course at a lower intensity.  I use a 3-5 lb dumbbell instead of a ball, and it works just fine.

The moves are pretty simple, though it may take a few times through the workout to get them all down.  A lot of the moves are very jumpy and there are A LOT of plyometric jumps (which I sometimes replace with marching depending on how my knees feel).  I don't usually do this workout more than once every week or two because 1) I have a lot of other workouts I like to cycle through and 2) It's tough on your legs.

That being said, the workout is customizable.  You can choose multiple segments (I think up to eight - I wish you could choose more at a time) and create a shorter workout.  This way, you can avoid segments that are too tough or pick just the tough ones :)  I find that when I do the workout all the way through (the full 60 minutes), the segments are nicely sequenced so that just when I feel I can't lunge and squat anymore, there's a lighter cardio segment, or after an intense jumping around cardio segment, there's a lighter dumbbell segment.

It's also nice to have four different instructors, each with their own style.  Allie starts off the workout, followed by Carissa (who does one of my favorite cardio segments), then Dale and lastly Jen.  By the time Jen has you doing plyometric jumps, my quads are just about fried.  There's some light ab work before the final cooldown, and a couple of the stretches are a little odd (like lying arching your back with your head on the floor - you have to be careful!).  After all the jumping around, I recommend adding a couple of good calf stretches to the end.

Overall, I definitely recommend this workout for anyone looking for a good intermediate-advanced cardio workout (especially because you can make it what you want with the customizable feature).",1242864000,3,2324,4.425882352941176
1690137,3,B0000639G2,"In my opinion, all Firm workouts are cheesy. Even though for the most part the actual exercises are not that bad, the instructors are super boring, monotonous and bland, especially in comparison to what else is available on the market. The music is often barely tolerable, but every once in while there is one that despite all of that works you hard and leaves you feeling good afterward. This one, I think is one of those. The variety is very good alternating between cardio without and cardio with weights (I wouldn't call this 'sculpting' though) burning calories at a pretty good rate (according to my heart rate monitor). The part that was definitely bad, was the stretching. In an early 80s kind of way the stretches are just rushed through, I had to ignore it and do my own. I noticed the poor quality of stretching in other Firm workouts also.",1216425600,,851,4.642384105960265
1690138,5,B0000639G2,"I love this DVD.  The workout is over 40 minutes long, longer than any of the newer Firm DVD's, plus you can pick which segments you want to workout with each time.  It is a great cardio workout that gets your whole body moving.  I started using this DVD and the Total Body Toner DVD 2 months ago, and along with changing my diet, I've lost 12 pounds, plus inches around my waist, hips and legs.",1205193600,2,395,4.171052631578948
1690139,5,B0000639G2,"I had this workout originally in VHS, and recently invested in the DVD. I'm not sorry I did. I always loved the music and the instructors in this one. It moves quickly. I can't do much high-impact, so I modify it- easy enough. It is a bit long, and a beginner would probably find this too hard and exhausting. But for intermediate exercisers and beyond, I think it's a really fun, effective cardio workout.",1184284800,3,406,4.5
1690140,5,B0000639G2,"I did this for the first time today.  I ordered it from one of the amazon marketplace sellers and received it within 3 days.  I got a good deal by buying used and it plays just fine.  What I like about this dvd is that you can fast forward the commercials they have in the front, which sometimes you can't do on other dvds.  The workout itself was pretty simple to follow.  I did mess up a few times, but I'm sure after a few workouts I wil have it down pat.  The music was fun and motivating.  I prefer the Firms from this era versus the newer Firms because the music was so much better then.  There were no high leg presses, which I think is a shame because the high leg presses would have made this a more complete workout.  I was going to buy Super Cardio as well, but having played the dvd, I think this has most of Super Cardio in it.",1177632000,,840,4.0120481927710845
1690160,5,B0000639G2,"This is another great cardio workout by the Firm.  This is a combination of both step and floor aerobics, but I would have to say there is more floor aerobics than step aerobics.  Actually, there is really only two segments (the first one and last one) in which I would truly categorize as ""step"" aerobics.  I would say the step is used for toning in the rest of the ""step"" segments (maybe only two others?). As with all Firm videos, I use 1 pound hand weights while doing the portions that don't require dumbbells. I find this not only gives you more of a workout, but gives you more definition in your arms.  I forward through the medicine ball parts (two of them) as I don't have a medicine ball and find that I still get a GREAT cardio workout in 45 minutes.  Great diversity with the instructors as well.",1172448000,3,809,4.366666666666666
1690161,5,B0000639G2,This is an older firm dvd but it is hard. I hate the music but the workout is good. I cannot get past the bad music and the people so  I don't do it much but you will sweat very early. You can also customize the dvd to go in the order you want it to go.,1170720000,,253,3.43859649122807
1690162,4,B0000639G2,"This dvd has an interesting concept - you can customize the workout.  The workout has 17 different sections - 1 warmup/stretch, 13 aerobic sections which include low impact, sculpt, step and impact,  1 cooldown, 1 ab& stabilizer, 1 yoga - led by 4 different instructors.  You can either do the complete workout or choose up to 8 segments (you can choose the same segment more than once) to customize your workout.

There isn't much choice for the warmup and cooldown/strech sections since there are only one of each of those, but there are a lot of choices for the aerobics sections.  I really liked a few of the aerobics choices (the shorthaired girl's ones,  the last one from the girl in light purple and a few of the ones from the girl in brown) and I disliked several also, so I really like the fact that I can choose to workout to only the ones I like.  I think that even though I didn't like several of the routines, it's good that they are since they might appeal to others who might not like the same style of exercise that I do.  I'd be interested in hearing which specific sections other reviewers liked.

I also like the fact that you can customize the aerobic part to be just a step workout, just an impact workout or a little of both.

Overall, not a bad choice for someone looking to buy a new exercise dvd.",1168992000,3,1322,4.381147540983607
1690163,5,B0000639G2,"This workout is really versitile. The workout consists of low-impact moves, step, high impact moves, four-limbed movements with light weights, a traditional stretch, a yoga style stretch and some ab work thrown in too.  If you want to do the whole thing, it's 63 minutes long (more power to ya!). What is really nifty about the DVD is that in the root menu, you can plan your workout, pick and choose what you would like to do out of the workout segments (There's 17 segments, and you can pick up to eight!). So, one day it could be warm up, heavy step, and yoga stretch; the next day four-limbed, hi/lo, abs and regular stretch. This thing is so versitile, a compilation with four FIRM leads. Not only that, it comes free with a trainer section, which is basically the FIRM ""Form Points"" video. This shows you how to and how not to execute different FIRM moves (Like lunges, dips, etc.)",1161907200,6,887,4.54375
1690164,4,B0000639G2,"Super Cardio is a long tough cardio workout with an assortment of cardio routines including step aerobics, hi-lo impact and 4 limb aerobics that the Firm is famous for. If you are to buy this video I would recommend getting the DVD as it is programmable and you can choose which segments you want.

This video contains a lot of high impact, especially plyo jumps which I personally don't care for. But don't let that deter you from buying this video, you can certainly modify the jumps by doing squats or marches in place of it. But there are some decent step routines and 4 limb routines using light weights that I find myself using most often. The choreography is fairly easy to pick up, one thing I have always appreciated from The Firm as I am a bit clumsy. And the higher impact routines are easily modifiable as previously mentioned. The programmable DVD allows you to choose 8 segments that you want to do which is a nice feature.  There is also some ab work tacked on to the end.

The music is great in this workout, some of the best that I have heard in a Firm video, very high energy which suits it well. 4 instructors lead this video and they all do a good job.  A good workout for those who enjoy The Firm videos.",1112486400,6,1225,4.336244541484716
1690165,3,B0000639G2,"I just got this DV and have used it twice, once all the way through (49 min. of cardio!) and once choosing selected segments. I found it annoying too, to have to go through all the info at the beginning, but found that I didn't have to when I went to choose each segment separately. I found it a bit difficult to determine how long each segment of cardio was, they don't list it in the menu, so I found myself watching the clock to see how long my work out was, subtracting the warm up and stretch then going back to add a couple of sessions to get at least 30 min of cardio. I would recommend, as another reviewer did, of doing a warm up on your own, as the menu only allows 8 segments to be chosen. I also agree about the stretch segment at the end, I found it to be of no real benefit, I ended up stretching on my own. All that said, I did feel that the cardio segments really packed it in, and that I got a good workout. I would caution anyone who doesn't like impact aerobics to steer clear, even the ""low"" impact is pretty jumpy. The other thing I noticed was that the segments using weights are fast paced and that I needed to switch to a lower weight to feel as though I was in control, my lighter strength weights were too heavy for cardio. Perhaps if the packaging were more informative I would have given it another star, they only include an advertisement for their ""fanny lifter"" in the insert, no program guide or explanation of segments. It could have been produced far better.",1111881600,3,1492,4.2020905923344944
1690166,5,B0000639G2,"I have 30+ exercise tapes and this is one of my favorites.  I like the ability to customize my workout and work on what I need to do that particular day.  I usually warm-up on my own and then pick 8 segments, return to the menu and pick another 5 and I get a 40 minute aerobic/scuplt workout.  Using this tape and returning to the custom menu, you can make your workout last from 20 minutes to 60 or longer.  I alternate between scuplt and box step to get a good hard allover workout.",1093564800,13,484,4.117021276595745
1690167,5,B0000639G2,"All the Firm videos are great! They never get boring for some reason!!! I think it's because they keep the instruction technical instead of saying cheesy things like other vids do. Plus they switch activities frequently, providing you with a FULL BODY workout EVERY time!! This video is great because it is super intense cardio and you feel proud when you have completed it!! At first I didn't like the music much, but now I don't mind it. The only bad part was the STRETCHES at the end and I'm surprised no one has mentioned it yet in the reviews. Some of the things they do look painful and dangerous in that segment as far as stretching goes!! (when you arch your back and come up on your head...ouch!) I always stop and stretch on my own with more conventional stretches when I do this DVD. Other than that this workout is challenging and fun. A vigorous workout for sure!!!",1079222400,6,878,4.49375
1690168,3,B0000639G2,"I bought the newest set of DVD's, Body Sculpting System 2, and love it.  It was my first exposure to The Firm and I saw results quickly.  I am a new mom for 2nd time and wanted to get back into shape quickly, The Firm is helping me get on my way.  However, I wanted to add in another cardio workout inbetween the strength training I do 3 days a week, so I bought this DVD.  There are some high impact routines that I will skip due to bad knees, the rest of the sections are ok but also include weights and lots of step work instead of just being cardio.  For me, it was very hard to go back to an earlier video in The Firm series - it seemed kind of cheesy and was not as well-polished as the new set, which was disappointing to me.  The ability to create your own workout is nice, but you have to re-select the choices every time.  Overall, I think there are better choices out there for a pure cardio workout, but if you like The Firm and what they include in their workouts, it's not bad.",1073433600,7,991,4.025510204081633
1690178,1,B0000639G2,"I absolutely hated this video. I have the original cardio sculpt, ab sculpt, and body sculpt 3 pack and the fanny lifter, and I LOVE that series (although I don't feel the ab sculpt is difficult enough). This video looked like it was produced in the mid-80's. I'm completely uncoordinated--that's why I do aerobics in the privacy of my own home--and could not follow this at all. This video is actually several routines on the same DVD. I didn't like any of the routines or the instructors (I wasn't sure if one of the instructors was actually a woman or a man in drag).

 Overall, I found the quality of this video extremely poor and outdated, especially when compared to the Firm DVDs that I already own. I even lent this video to a friend to see what she thought and she hated it, too. Now I'm afraid to buy other Firm DVDs--I don't want to waste another $20 on a video I'll watch once then throw away.",1071100800,3,905,4.380952380952381
1690179,3,B0000639G2,"I'm actually glad I didn't buy this DVD, as I had originally intended.  I borrowed it from a friend first.  This was my first taste of The Firm, as I am usually a gym brat.  I wanted a cardio workout I could do at home when I couldn't get to the gym.  I HATED this workout from the moment it started.  As others have commented, the music selection is horrible.  It does very much resemble elevator music, and besides being unmotivating, it is annoying.
Second, the steps aren't demonstrated and the instructors move very quickly.  It makes it difficult to catch on, and while, I'm sure if I did this workout frequently, I WOULD catch on, I became frustrated early in the workout.  Frustration tends to be a big factor in whether or not a workout will become a regular for me, so this workout was immediately shelved.
Third, you do need a step for this workout--the routine is almost all done on a step.  They suggest their Fanny Lifter (which is expensive), but I think any step will work.  I don't have a step and attempted to use a stool.  It didn't work and it was awkward.  You also need a medicine ball--something else which is expensive and I don't already own.  In short, why go purchase these things for a cardio workout when there are better videos on the market that require no extra equipment?
I know many people are big fans of The Firm, and I'm sure they have other great workout tapes out there.  This is not one of them.  I pulled it out again to give another try a few months after my first attempt.  I felt exactly the same way.  It requires a lot of extra equipment, the music and instructors are not motivating, and the steps are rather advanced.  Save yourself the money and look elsewhere for a good cardio DVD.",1068336000,4,1732,4.3930817610062896
1690180,4,B0000639G2,"This is by far the most challenging cardio workout I've ever done.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that if you are not that well coordinated, you will have trouble keeping up with it which presents an extra challenge on top of just trying to keep up period.  Also, the music is not really that appealing or motivating.  Still in all, if you want to feel really proud of yourself after finishing a workout,  this is the one to do.  Today was my first time and I feel so inspired.  I am determined to master this workout and there is no doubt that I will get quick and desirable results.",1068076800,,604,4.163793103448276
1690181,3,B0000639G2,"This is the first The Firm I have ever used and it is a good cardio/muscle workout, but I can't seem to get past the horrible music selection.  Sometimes it sounds like I'm watching ""The Neverending Story"" and others times I just want to mute it.  Also the women who lead this are hard to hear because of the music.  I wish it had a mute option where I could do away with the music and I wouldn't have such a problem with it.
They also don't teach you the steps or even preview them like in other exercise routines.  They just get up there and start out with no preparation.  Combine this with the low voices, and it's hard to keep up with the steps.",1064966400,3,650,4.126984126984127
1690182,5,B0000639G2,"I have added this video into my ""FIRM"" rotation and love to do it on the days I'm not doing strength training.  The mix of low impact, step, high impact and four limb aerobics along with the mix of four terrific instructors makes the time fly.  This is a tough routine and when it's over, I am sweating and proud to have completed it.  I have really noticed myself progressing with better form and more energy into the steps.  I am not ""dancy"" and have no problem following along.  Definitely a Calorie Burner!  I really wish the Firm would make more like this.",1059436800,12,561,4.398058252427185
1690183,4,B0000639G2,"This is the first THe Firm video I have purchased.  I do have other exercise cardio tapes and wanted some more variety.  I am pretty fit -- have no problems doing other tapes and cross-country ski a couple of hours a day 3 times a week.  The first time I tried to do this tape, I got completely confused by fast pace.  However, the nice thing about having it on DVD is you can break out the components through the Scene Index.  I recommend for beginners working on each component separately, and then string 3 or 4 together at a time per instructor.  Then once you've got them down you can do the whole thing sequentially.  Also, the DVD allows you to put 8 of your favorite together to make a workout specific to you.  One other tip -- I first did the routines without any weights, to get arm and feet movements down.  Then once I had the routine down I added weights back in.  Also, for step/fanny lifter, I bought a sturdy step stool at Wal-Mart for five dollars and it worked fine.  Having said all this, I will say this video is by far the most rigorous cardio I've ever done on video, and yields great results in least amount of time.  The instructors are appealing and give excellent cues, and music, though not entirely motivating, has a good beat and doesn't distract from understanding instructors cues.",1045180800,26,1313,4.425
1690184,3,B0000639G2,"This was my First Firm video after seeing that informercial on t.v.. True to it's word, I did see results after the 10 workouts, I saw results after my fifth work out! My arms and shoulder's were slimmer, my hips and butt thinner. I was happy, with my results. A great workout.
I have a pretty active history, I use to run trac, and went to the jym on a regular basis. I also own several workout tapes, from Denise Austin to the Crunch workouts. I will admit this is the only tape that I bought where I saw results so rapidly...
There is discouraging factors though, there's a part in it towards the end where you have to do these Knee and arm crossovers while you run in place? At any rate I found them very frustrating to do, they left my knees aching and feeling stress.
There are some segments in the tape that I don't feel are quite safe for your knees. I've never had this is problem before in running, or any other video tapes.
This is a VERY FAST paced tape, that will have you sweating.
And if you can get pass the frustration, of moving from segment to segment, and NOT hurting your knees or back.....
Well...then GREAT.
This is a great tape, a little too harsh on my knees though. And I always fastforward or skip the parts I feel I can do without...
Being since, I found such quick results, I've done some research and am going to buy and try more Firm Tapes...
Goodluck to you :)",1033344000,38,1392,4.2368421052631575
1690185,2,B0000639G2,"I think this DVD is the lowest I've ever rated anything on Amazon.  There are a number of reasons I'm returning this fitness workout, and why you should avoid it if you are looking for a good, not annoying, exercise program.
1.  The music is really icky-- kind of elevator-ish instrumental with a beat that doesn't say ""cardio workout"" to me but instead says ""musak at its *worst*.""  If you care about what the music the workout uses sounds like, very few of you will like this.
2.  The workout actually is a cleverly disguised step-workout.  If you're going to make a step workout, then label it as such! I was looking for something of a floor dance style cardio-- and nothing on the packaging led me to believe that this was step aerobics.  I have a step tape I love, but can't do it because of knee issues and nerve-damage in my foot.  So I actually scanned the packaging fairly carefully, and saw a picture and description that led me to believe this was a dance-type lower impact workout with weights (no problem).  After watching the DVD, I looked more carefully and saw it says that you have to have a special ""Fanny Lifter"" (which IS on the back, but wasn't shown in the images, and *wasn't* described as a step-- so until I saw it, I figured I could improvise whatever the Fanny Lifter was... I was wrong).
I did see a very tiny print disclaimer about people with ""weak knees"" or ""very out of shape"" being able to use a shorter platform.  I am in pretty good shape, but yes, weak knees is a big deal.  I actually think even if you don't have ""weak knees"" yet, this workout might make you have them if you do it for long.  I needed something with NO platform-- so if this is why you're looking at this instead of a Step workout, don't buy it.  The platform you need to buy for this video is actually quite high, also, so even if you're a step workout fan, make sure you are okay with a very high, unstable looking step.  It's more a footstool than anything else!  It also did not imply that this fanny lifter thing was a pretty much essential part of the workout-- used on almost every section I looked at.  It would be really complicated for you to modify the workout if you tried to do it without a step or ""fanny lifter.""
3.  I was annoyed with the fact that I could not fast forward through the DVD credits, intro material, and other 3-5 minutes worth of stuff at the start of the DVD.  It seemed like a LONG time to wait while I was standing there in my workout space.  The stuff at the beginning was ""locked out"" and you could not skip at all. If it was a video, I would just not rewind all the way so I could skip that part.  But with a DVD, you have to watch it every time.  When I am ready to work out, I'm sorry, but I don't really care who the photographer was.  It was a waste of my time.
I actually can't comment on the difficulty or lack thereof of the routine because I couldn't get past these issues, and instead put in another DVD (the one I mention below).  I am entirely too busy to spend that much time on something quite this annoying.
I understand that the Firm is supposed to provide a great workout for many people, and if this works for you, and you can skip all these issues, fine.  But if the above issues are things you too might find irritating, I suggest instead of this one, the Kathy Smith - Timesaver Cardio Fat Burner DVD (Amazon ASIN:  B00005QW4E).",1027987200,54,3391,4.254290171606864
1690186,5,B0000639G2,"This is a fantastic workout!  You sweat, you ache, but you don't lose interest.  The idea of being able to customize your workout is fantastic - if only more workout dvds would follow suit.  The tape does include a lot of jumping, which isn't so great for some apartment dwellers, but doesn't seem to hurt the knees too much.  And for those of us who don't want to shell out the [money] for a fanny lifter, may I suggest the Fisher Price Step Stool Potty.  It's a little loud to step on and not quite as high, but at [the price] it gets the job done.",1026864000,7,550,4.150943396226415
1690187,5,B0000639G2,This DVD is not for Beginners but great for those who are intermediate and advanced.  I really enjoyed it.  I started working out with Kathy Smith and Denise Alston but I needed a new environment that's when I turned to The Firm.  It is fun to customize your own exercises.  The exercise I really enjoy is the Power Jump/Run.  You can burn calories and tone your calves.  I rate this 5 stars plus.,1021939200,8,397,4.36986301369863

7959174,5,B0000639G2,"I have been working out with the firm since the very first vhs one (susan someone or another). I've found a few other instructors I enjoy as much or more than the firm, but there are still maybe 5 or 6 I keep in my regular rotation.  I saw this at the library and hadn't seen it before.  Although it's an older dvd, it is a solid cardio workout!  I'm not happy unless the workout makes me SWEAT and this one delivers.  The segments are just the right length in my opinion.  You keep thinking, I can do one more segment...I can do one more segment...until all of a sudden, you're done.  Which is surprising because it's a long dvd.  I like the switch up of instructors every few segments.  I definitely enjoyed it and will be buying it to put it in the regular rotation.  You do need a step for a few of the exercises.  The step they use is a shorter one than the butt lifter ones they sold maybe 10/15 years ago or so. So I can't do every step quite as quickly as they do, but it's fun to try to keep up. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",1381881600,,1051,4.058252427184466
7959175,5,B0000639G2,"I used to have the old Firm VHS tapes but unfortunately I had to get rid of them due to technology but it really hurt.  Now I'm noticing them on Amazon at cheap prices for the used ones, not the classics though like Susan Harris (wow those prices just keep going up!), so I got some and this one was a kicker!

I started thinking, since I did these a long time ago, that it was just going to be the standard Firm cardio set but not so, it just kept going from low to high impact to include using the steps and the ball.  I was sweating like a pig!  I did not realize it was a hour tape until I was done but I felt great!

There is nothing like the old Firm workouts, much better than the newer ones because they just have character and the mixes of personalities keep them interesting.  People may say they are outdated but honey exercise is NEVER outdated!  The old Firm workouts are the only ones that I find myself keeping up with because the sets are tough and they go by so fast and they are just fun to do!",1366761600,,1012,4.03
7959176,5,B0000639G2,"This a good, long, tough cardio workout from the Firm with a variety of cardio that includes low impact aerobics, hi impact aerobics/plyometrics, step aerobics, and their traditional four limb weighted aerobics. They also have a few segments using a medicine ball for sport inspired segments. You can vary the intensity by adjusting the higher impact moves to lower impact, as I did with the plyo moves and jumping jacks as those can be hard on my knees when done full form. The workout rotates through many segments and 4 different instructors, including Dale Brabham, Allie Strickland, and Jennifer Carman. The cardio portion is about 53 min with the w/u, then you do a very brief stretch, and this is where I have my only complaint: no c/d immediately after the cardio. You will probably want to do your own c/d or it might be a bit jarring to the cardiovascular system. Then comes abs on the floor, c/d and stretch. All total 60 min. You will work it and sweat with this one!",1365379200,,979,4.632183908045977
7959177,4,B0000639G2,"This video has some incredible cardio and definitely lives up to the ""super cardio"" part of the title. I'm pretty in shape, and I had to take a break in the middle of it. It is, however, difficult to follow. There are parts I basically say ""to heck with that"" and just hop around in ways that look similar, but I'd look like an idiot if anyone were watching. The other down side is the music is really outdated, and it feels like you're trapped in a bad 80s movie sometimes. Despite the drawbacks, it will leave you dripping in sweat and sore the next day, meaning it's worth the corny tunes and ""what the *#@!"" moments.",1358467200,,620,4.3076923076923075
7959178,4,B0000639G2,"I've had this workout for years now. This is supposed to be a crosstrainer to the ""Super Sculpting"" workout that is all weights and no cardio.

This workout clocks in about 49 minutes of cardio.

Pros-
All exercises are easy to follow
Music is decent and goes well with each segment
All Instructers are very good with cuing
All cardio is very effective
Not too many segments using the ""step box""-which is good, only has three parts where you use the stepping.
This Cardio workout can be used alone even if you do not own the other crosstrainer ""Super Sculpting"".
DVD is chaptered and lets you select certain segments.

Cons-
Some segments are a little repetitive
Some segments just didn't fit and should've been moved around in different sections
Ab section seemed too short for how long the cardio is
While most segments were short enough, sometimes it feels as if the whole workout just drags too long for some reason
The DVD chaptered version doesn't actually allow you to customize for the real time that the actual workout is (for example, there is 15 segments (1st instructor-Allie does 3 segments, 2nd Instructor-Carissa does 3 segments, Dale does 4 segments, and Jennifer does 5 segments-yet the dvd only lets you do only so many and not lets you select up to 15-which it should). And when customizing, some are paired with another so you might want to pick a certain one that doesn't have another, but you are forced to choose that one too (even if you didn't want to do that segment, but it won't let you).

The first segment is lead by Allie-she does Ball aerobics, and a step alternatiing bicep curls, followed by some power jumps. I like her part.

The 2nd segment is Carissa doing some squat kicks (using no weights), and some ""ball kicks"" which are fun, but I feel this part brings down the heartrate too fast. Then she does a more higher impact of jacks, then a short step box alternating legs which is good with some floor jacks. This one is also good, but again, the standing and alternating squats on the floor just seems to bring down the heartrate.

The 3rd segment is lead by Dale. I like this one, but I didn't like the bow and arrow cardio section..for some reason I always find myself fast forwarding that cardio part. Overall I do like her segment as the 4 limb dumbells are my favorite. She seems to have the most easy going moves in her segment, but still good cardio.

The 4th is by Jen. THIS is where the cardio REALLY kicks in. Only problem--I personally think she shouldve been put ""in between"" the other instructors. Why? Because her cardio was the most higher impact and a full 20 min!! I know the way the segments are for 1 instructor at a time, but being hers was the most higher impact, I feel she should've suddenly ""popped up"" with her moves in between to sort of ""balance out"" all the other cardio segments.

Overall a good solid cardio workout. It can seem long after awhile, but this will melt the fat off!

If you can only fit in a good 20-25 min of cardio, just fast forward or skip and do only Jen's segments!",1347408000,,3054,4.498194945848375
7959179,5,B0000639G2,"I started using this cardio DVD in 2000 and it was integral to losing my freshman 15.  It's a tough workout even for someone accustomed to aerobics, which is pretty hard to find in the aerobic DVD world.  I've used it frequently over the last 12 years and it continues to be a challenging aerobic workout that I do a couple times per week.

It's a nice mix of high intensity/high impact cardio, lower intensity/low impact cardio, a few moderate weight-bearing cardio routines (4-limb) and a few step routines and is customizable up to 8 scene selections.  Lots of the cardio segments include ""plyometrics"" or jump squats which really amp up the difficulty level.

The instructors are great, the workout is not boring. While it is challening even for experienced folks, it could easily accomodate less fit users as well - just don't do all the jump squats and moderate the movements a bit.",1333584000,,888,4.740259740259741
