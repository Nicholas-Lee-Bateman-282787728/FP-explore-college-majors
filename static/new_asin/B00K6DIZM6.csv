6403516,5,B00K6DIZM6,"After the somewhat disappointing companion Martha (whose character development is too frequently replaced by unrequited love), we get Donna back.  She originally appeared in ""The Runaway Bride"", and her cheeky no-nonsense independence is a wonderful addition to the show!  The banter and camaraderie between David Tennant and Catherine Tate is a joy to watch, and Donna is my favorite companion for the Tenth Doctor.  (My wife shares this opinion as well, so you know it's legit.)  ;-)

Series Four Part One is reasonably priced compared to the Complete Season Four, and it DOES contain the Christmas special ""Voyage of the Damned"", which is a must for anyone looking to collect the complete run.  Unfortunately, the halved Series starring Matt Smith (Series 5, 6, and 7) left off all of the special episodes... so beware!",1408665600,17,822,5.097014925373134
6403517,5,B00K6DIZM6,"Best series around! Doctor Who has truly snuck itself into my heart and it is there to stay. The stories, the characters, everything about this show will stay with you forever. <3 Personally my favorite companion used to be Rose. But then Donna Noble came about, took me a while to like her, with what her attitude and bitchy self, but once she won my heart, she had it for good! Donna and the Doctors chemistry goes beyond what he had with any of his other companions. She is simply the best! <3",1407110400,6,496,4.344086021505376

8656260,5,B00K6DIZM6,"fantastic series.  I thought series 3 and 5 would always be my favorites, but series 4 is right up there!  part 1 have not one episode that I do not love! partners and crime, smith and jones, & the eleventh hour are my favorite companion opening episodes, so for the series to open with partners in crime is awesome and a well done episode.  the fires of Pompeii is perfect, and so is planet of the ood and the voyage of the damned.  and (slight companion reveal spoiler) I am so happy they brought back Martha in the sontaran strategen and the doctor's daughter.  a great set of episodes!",1468627200,,589,4.36697247706422
8656261,5,B00K6DIZM6,It's a volcano day at in italy. Amazing is that the first three parter was very good but that when the sontarans knew that playing sport games is not in pressed buy it. Sontarans vs Rutan are in peace. The doctor Findlay found his daughter at that one planet of earth in the year 51st century.,1462320000,,293,4.25
