8164592,5,B000LVOVYY,"The footage in this DVD is amazing to see.  Very well done.  There are sections on dolphins, sea lions and seals, sharks, and whale sharks. There are also sections on specific places such as Belize, Indonisia, California and Papua New Guinea. I started out by watching the DVD with just the music just like the last reviewer, and switched to the commentary just to find out what a couple of fish were.  After hearing a few minutes of the commentary, I had to watch the whole DVD with the commentary.  Annie is so fascinating to listen to.  I learned alot from this DVD.

Well worth the money.",1262044800,,592,4.485981308411215
8164593,5,B000LVOVYY,"I am an avid scuba diver. I was thoroughly entertained by this video. I started by watching without the commentary but then switched to the commentary as I wanted to see if it mentioned where the diving was done. Although I know a lot about fish, behavior, etc. the commentary did teach me some new things. The video clarity was amazing. If you don't pick the commentary the music is pleasant. I found myself wanting more.",1212883200,2,422,4.565789473684211
