8551274,5,B00AG6Z8DM,"This set is amazing.  We signed up for local swing dance classes and got this DVD set to supplement what we learned.  We quickly realized that the class was far inferior to the DVD. They take their time to go over all the footwork for both the men and the women and then they gradually lead you into the movement with explanations.  It's the best dance instruction I've ever received.

Disc 1 covers basic timing and footwork, the sugar push, and the left and right side passes
Disc 2 covers various tucks and combination moves
Disc 3 covers all your basic whips.",1453939200,,563,4.490196078431373

8551276,5,B00AG6Z8DM,They really do it all in this DVD and take their time so beginners can really follow along.  They pace was a bit on the slow side of us but then again we already knew the basics of the dance but wanted to learn more from these pros.  They really go into some amazing pointers and style tips throughout the DVDs,1399680000,,310,4.065573770491803
