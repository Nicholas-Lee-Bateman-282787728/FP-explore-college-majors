I made the mistake of recently purchasing...""Master of the Flying Guillotine"".Their is many duplicator's(IMPOSTER's),but only one original and that's The ""Fatal Flying Guillotine"".If you have one more classic Martial Art's,movie to add to your collection...make it this one!",1368230400,2,374,5.818181818181818
