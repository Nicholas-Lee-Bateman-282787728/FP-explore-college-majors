387544,1,6301964306,"I thoroughly enjoyed the backdrop of Ancient Greece as it was portrayed in this movie. There were also neat little quirks in several of the early scenes like the Macedonian games of spear-throwing and boxing, as well as  the array of famous statues in Athens. Richard Burton brought to his  character of the King the predictable level of heavy drama and emotional  instability that he was famous for, and although quite overbearing at  times, he was nonetheless a master of his art and of the many problems of  this stupid film, none were directly attributable to him. For one, there  were way too many historical discrepencies in the plot, which would've been  more excusable only if there had been more plot to go around it all! Most  of the movie is dedicated to Alexander's young life and his conflicts with  his parents, while very little attention whatsoever is paid to his famous  eleven year conquest of Persia, Egypt, and India. In fact if I'm  remembering correctly -- for it has been some time since I last saw the  film -- almost the entire Indian campaign is summed up as we watch a red  line being drawn across a static map on the screen, while a voiceover  announces something like, ""and then Alexander moved through  India..."" The mass marriage at the end of the film was interesting for  me, but then Alexander raises his cup in toast and -- whammo! -- he falls  over, is taken to his deathbed, and that's that. A very disappointing  climax for any motion picture, let alone one about the greatest military  general of the ancient world. Alexander deserves to be honored by a  terrific film, but this is not the one.",954633600,9,1633,4.643356643356643
387545,2,6301964306,"The acting and set design of Alexander the Great are first rate.  Unfortunately, in an effort to compress the story into a 2 1/2 hour movie, the script takes great liberties with historical  accuracy.  The fact that the daughter of Darius is wrongly named Roxane is the least of the problems  with this movie.  Some of the most glaring problems occur when several  historical characters are rolled into one movie character.  The fate of the  Rhodian general Memnon is completely inaccurate.  The movie depicts a  written document by Darius falling into Alexander's hands.  This event is  based on ages-old propaganda most likely perpetuated by both Alexander and  his followers, meant to justify his claim to the Achaemenid throne.  The  epic quality of the Alexander story is completely lost as the movie jumps  from scene to scene in an effort to finish the movie in 2 1/2 hours.  Interestingly, the movie spends an inordinate amount of time developing the  character of the young Alexander in Macedonia.  Once he begins his military  campaigns, however, the movie unfolds quickly and unevenly.  I realize that  squeezing Alexander's life into one movie is difficult, but it would have  been better to leave out some details rather than  falsify them.  The movie  was made in the 1950s, and I am sure that more information on Alexander and  the Persians has come to light since then.  So we may forgive the  moviemakers for some of the inaccuracies in the movie.  It would have been  nice if more time had been spent developing the character of Darius.  For a  great historical narrative on Alexander which steers clear of the biased  Greek descriptions, read the superb biography 'Alexander of Macedon' by  Peter Green.",952905600,9,1722,4.943661971830986
387546,5,6301964306,"Great entertainment and historically correct, for the most part. Richard Burton plays a convincing Alexander. From the start, with the background on Alexander's youth and his relationship with his father Philip and mother  Olympias, the movie awesomely captures history. The battle scenes are  recreated very well. I especially liked the post-battle scene at Chaeronea  with the drunken Philip's singing echoing through the valley. Only minor  errors, such as Darius's daughter being called Roxanne (a Bactrian  princess) instead of Statira, can easily be overlooked. Alexander in fact,  married both women anyway. The Persians are also shown historically correct  for the most part, especially Darius' murder and the scene at Persepolis.  For an under two-hour movie, what you get is quite spectacular. Of course,  it would be difficult, if not impossible, to reduce to film everything in  Alexander's life.",951609600,32,908,5.562043795620438

387657,4,6301964306,"In this 2-hour & 16-minute, 1956, single, DVD-disc, is a portrayal of a historical human figure, that was taught by a conniving, superstitious, mother who actually thought..., that Alexander III was divine. A supposed demi-god (half human & half divine), whose thought to be father was Zeus, the head of the mythological Greek gods. In actuality, his mortal/earthly father was King Philip II of Macedonia - the fearsome, warrior Monarch, who - through countless battles, united the factions of Macedonia and Greece. And as heir apparent, ALEXANDER THE GREAT chose the destiny of the gods: A short life filled with glory rather than a long life filled with obscurity. After, the untimely murder of his father Phillip, a young Alexander places his feet on the course of destiny, never to look back. He avenges his father's murder and sets his sights on a seemingly, unconquerable Persia. But, just as a little boy named David knocked down a very large giant named Goliath, so too, did Alexander assail the Persian Empire. And against tremendous odds, actually won. This historical account is brought to the big-screen with the intensity that Alexander would have, approved of. A cinematic spectacle on a grand scale - ALEXANDER THE GREAT, is both educational and entertaining. Nina Kish",1422835200,2,1284,5.090047393364929

387707,4,6301964306,"Alexander the Great is easily one of the most fascinating historical figures.  Because of that, his life is something that has been the subject of portrayal many times over, whether it be film or book or theater.  Sadly, because of the epicness of his existence, despite his short lifespan, his story is a difficult one to tell.  Even with all the passion and good intentions, the finished product often feels stuffy and cold and not entirely convincing.  There are just so many aspects, so many points, and touching upon them all (which is what many filmmakers attempt to do) overwhelms, and not in a good way.

Yes, this is the stuff epics were made of, but maybe someone should try and scale it back a little.

This 1956 tale is, like most others, a grand depiction of Alexanders life, from birth to death, but there is something about Robert Rossens direction that makes this all feel more grounded and effective than the others have.  With nicely composed war sequences kept for special moments and not thrust in the forefront, we are given a nicely developed emotional journey of a man torn between his fleshly existence and his belief in his own deity.  Liberties were obviously taken, as with all films of this nature, and yet they never distract.  Burton, one of the greatest actors of any generation, feels slightly miscast at times, and the climax gets a little muddy, but Rossens obvious attachment to the material shows in the best possible ways, and Fredric March, completely unrecognizable under all that makeup, delivers a scene stealing performance that will leave you wanting more.  Its a beautiful film, with stunning cinematography and some lavish sets and costumes, and the earthy, emotional core makes this one of the better more inspired takes on this legacy.",1400544000,4,1782,4.870860927152318
387708,5,6301964306,Vastly superior to the more recent movie on Alexander.  Follows his life more thoroughly than most but with a sometimes overdramatic flair from actor Richard Burton.

387709,4,6301964306,"When I first watched this I was severely underwhelmed because of the battle scenes.  The battle recreations are a mosh pit of extras, that is two opposing forces clash with no sense of tactics or strategy on screen.  This is a big negative for this movie-a bio of one of the greatest tacticians in history.  So with that failing, it was many years between viewings for this movie.  My next viewing was a whim and I was suprised by the character development.  That part is soild.  Burton with his blonde hair is disconcerting but he does have the acting chops needed for a portrayal of the mecurial Alexander and when he delivers his last line, ""...to the strongest.""

Very revealing about how the philosophers leading cultures from Greek times have propagated and left us with a heavy burden of racism and sexism, .... anthropomorphism and ego-centrism of the propertied white men.",1374969600,,742,5.279661016949152
387715,2,6301964306,"I didn't understand this movie very well. Indeed, I got so lost that when it was over, I went to Wikipedia and read about the life of Alexander before I thought I could write this review properly. But I can tell you one thing which I did pick up from the movie, and which was confirmed by Wikipedia. This movie was a gay man's dream. All those healthy young specimens, very scantily clad, wrestling and doing all sorts of gymnastics! Oh, my! And in fact even Richard Burton, playing Alexander, was convincingly gay. (Forget that he later married Liz Taylor; he was an ACTOR, after all. He could be anything he wanted, anything the script called for.)

As mentioned, Richard Burton plays Alexander, and does a reasonably good job. I have not looked up the specifics, but he must have been pretty young at the time. Either he was not quite the actor he became later or the director wanted him to be enigmatic, because he shows very little emotion in his facial expressions. Fredric March plays Philip of Macedonia, his father, and Claire Bloom his ambitious and rather ruthless mother Olympias, with whom he had quite an enduring attachment. She said that a god was born when she gave birth to Alexander, and indeed both she and Philip had prophetic dreams about him. The soothsayers agreed, but then soothsayers generally knew which side of the bread was buttered.

The first we see Alexander as an adult, or nearly so, is the scene with all those buffed young men. Aristotle is his teacher, and it would not be too much to say that it was Aristotle who was really responsible for Alexander's greatness, in that it seems Alexander took his advice quite seriously.

When Philip goes off to conquer Greece, he leaves Alexander in charge as his regent in Macedonia. But it seems he did rather too good a job; Philip developed quite a jealousy of Alexander which caused some trouble. Just before Philip was killed, he ordered several of Alexander's closest companions into exile. However, he was killed by an angry young man on the steps of the temple before the exile was carried out. It seems Olympias hinted to the young man. Alexander overheard the conversation and did not approve, but later on the steps of the temple, Philip tells Alexander to go ahead of him, that he will walk alone. Since Alexander had already spotted the would-be assassin in the crowd, his agreement to walk ahead of Philip probably seemed like permission to the assassin. After Philip was dead, Alexander killed the assassin. To prove he had no part of it, or to shut him up before he could say anything about Olympias? Who knows?

Alexander had to conquer Greece all over again, because they rebelled, and then went on to conquer the Persian empire, which included Judea, Egypt and Mesopotamia, as well as the turf in between. While in Egypt, he founded Alexandria, later the seat of the Ptolemaic dynasty which ruled Egypt when Cleopatra ruled Marc Antony. (Burton revisited?)

Then he went on to India, but eventually drew back, as it was just too much for him. He left some of his men in control and returned over the desert. (Wasn't clear where he returned to, but it was green, not desert.)

In Persia, Alexander adopted Persian dress and customs, which made a lot of his Greek and Macedonian followers mad. He attempted to unite the two empires peacefully by marrying a Persian princess and also arranging a huge mass marriage like Sun Moon with his officers and Persian women. Not long after that, he got sick and died. On his deathbed, his officers asked him to whom he left his empire, and he answered, ""to the strongest.""

If you like lots of battle and all that, or if you are fond of ancient history, you will probably like this film. As I said above, I did not understand it very well, and never got so far as to sort out the names to go with the faces of most of the main characters. I give it only one star: Richard Burton [OK, 2.]",1337385600,,3922,4.602288984263233

387747,4,6301964306,"It was bold of Robert Rossen to attempt to make a 'thinking man's epic' four years before the term would creep into common usage with Spartacus and at a time when the popular image of the screen epic was either of Cecil B. De Mille's enjoyable excesses or undemanding star vehicles for the likes of Tony Curtis and Cornel Wilde. He certainly chose a big subject - the most successful conqueror of the classical era - so it's perhaps not too surprising that with only 136 minutes at his disposal to do the Macedonian leader's short but eventful life justice he fell short.

Focusing on Alexander's conflicts with his brash and vulgar father and his mother's plotting as he sets out to live a life worthy of a god, it's not nearly as talky as its reputation, although unfortunately some of the talk does bring out the ham in Richard Burton and Frederic March in particular. Yet it's a more focused and accessible telling of a man who determinedly set out to become a legend than Oliver Stone's flawed but ambitious fractured narrative half a century later, and many of the scenes are surprisingly memorable. It's never entirely successful, but it works well enough to keep your interest, and if history doesn't always get its due onscreen at least for once it's not because the director is aiming for the lowest common denominator but overreaching himself with a subject that's too big for just one film.

387749,3,6301964306,"For a film that has as many classic actors as it does, ALEXANDER THE GREAT still manages to misfire enough to cause the viewer to lose interest by midpoint.  Whenever a film goes off course like that, the fault is usually the director's.  In this case, Robert Rossen took a very big budget film and used it appallingly.  Rossem filmed ALEXANDER THE GREAT as if it were two unrelated movies.  The first half has Alexander (Richard Burton) in constant Oedipal conflict with his father Phillip (Frederick March).  March plays Phillip as a ruler more interested in protecting his realm from a son whom he considers to be only quasi-legitimate since his wife (Danielle Darrieux) was forced on him as part of a political alliance.  Phillip raises Alexander as one who is fit to command an army but not a nation.  For that, he dreams of choosing a wife with whom he may bear a son to rule after him.  Burton plays Alexander as one who owes fealty to his father but only at the cost of fealty to his destiny.  From the very moment of Alexander's birth, omens presage his latent divinity, all the while reinforcing in Phillip's mind that his son is a mixed blessing.  Alexander grows knowing that his future in irrevocably mixed with the Gods of Olympus.  By the time that Phillip is assassinated, Alexander is convinced that his destiny and Greece's destiny are the same thing.

The second half is a working out of Alexander's vision of world conquest.  The Gods of Olympus choose their entrants most carefully and Alexander deduces that it is only by humbling the Persian king Darius that he may assume the mantle of divinity.  The problem of the second half is a continuation of that of the first half.  For a film that chronicles the exploits of a world conquerer, ALEXANDER THE GREAT does not deliver the military dramatic goods. Whenever Alexander's forces face a foe, the entire filmed battle is more of a vignette than lively interpretation of blood and gore.  Historically, Alexander overcame fearsome odds at nearly every battle by means of tactical genius.  Here, he simply lines up his men and shouts at them ""Charge!""  The frequent discourses between March and Burton hold the first half more or less together, but there is nothing like that to do likewise in the second.  Alexander runs from one battle to another whose fiercest opposition comes not from any Persian but from malcontents in his own army who see him as a false god unwilling to take them back to Greece after a ten year hiatus in Asia conquering the known world.  Burton, as usual, holds up his end with his richly resonant voice though his physique seems a little too pretty-boy like for the role.  There is not a whiff of any homesexual subtext that is usually associated with any filmed version of Alexander's life.  ALEXANDER THE GREAT concludes as a film that is a sad misuse of what should have been a soul stirring spectacle of one who sought to rule a world when he could not first rule himself.",1251676800,,2974,4.667946257197697

He seemed to really get into his character and made him work for the time that he was in the film.

The battle scenes are anemic compared to what we're used to today and even for that time I think left a bit to be desired in that realm. The dialogue could be a bit silly in places and odd in some other parts.

I would say, and this had it going for it, it's no worse than the modern version of Alexander with Colin Farrell. To me it seems like Stone watched this movie and only updated it instead of revamping it.",1232582400,2,764,4.120805369127517

The direction, also by Robert Rossen, reminds me of the worse of the old Italian sword-and-sandals films with failed efforts to make a cast of tens seem larger and make cheap sets to look lived-in.

The history is mix of authentic and questionable, but the vital importance of military tactics has been reduced to simple brute force in cheaply staged battle scenes.

It seems a waste, since one is left with a feeling that with greater creative imagination and more dynamic direction this could have been an effective film. The look of it is heavily dated, with the costumes far too bright and clean-looking all the time, and the style is generally very theatrical. Nothing convinces: certainly not the battles; and the way the scenes are shot is mostly plain dull. It also seems to jump about in a jerky manner, especially in the later scenes: probably it had been heavily cut down by someone with minimal sense of pacing. It would be nice, some time, to see a film where someone had taken the trouble to deeply immerse himself in the way people truly lived, thought, spoke and interacted in Ancient Greece. I could never quite believe what I was seeing here. Nevertheless, there is something memorable about the movie, and I think it must simply be down to the presence, voice and look of Burton, in spite of his back-combed strawberry blond rug and fake tan. Every now and then you suspect that, given a director with a tauter, clearer vision and more drive, he might have produced an Alexander to match the legend. With new words and new music it could have been a great song. Strangely enough it has left me with a much stronger and longer-lasting impression than Stone's Alexander, which I watched a couple of months ago and can't remember anything about.",1135814400,3,1499,4.660377358490566

387800,4,6301964306,"One of the best things about this epic based on Alexander the Great is watching and listening to Richard Burton ply his magnificent craft. He was 29 at the time this film was made, and his resonant voice is remarkable, and one of the most unique sounds to be heard in the cinema. He is unfortunately wearing a strawberry blonde wig that has so much spray on it, it could be made of plastic, but otherwise makes a marvelous Alexander, in one of his rare appearances in an ""ancient costume epic"", others being ""The Robe"" and the infamous ""Cleopatra"".

Written, directed and produced by Robert Rossen, it has some excellent dialogue, overall fine acting, and of course, battle sequences with 1001 extras. There is also quite a bit of ""beefcake"", but not many who are ready for the bare chest exposure, including Burton, whose abs are almost absent, and many of the extras are flabby and rotund, and hard to imagine are warriors.
Shot on location in Spain, the cinematography by Robert Krasner, in typical '50s vibrant Technicolor, is wonderful. Claire Bloom is beautiful as Barsine, a dark and hairy, savage and quite unrecognizable Frederick March is terrific as Philip of Macedon, Harry Andrews is a good Darius, and Danielle Darrieux is Alexander's crafty mother. Others of note in the cast are Stanley Baker as Attalus, and Peter Cushing as Memnon.

Though flawed, this is a film that can be viewed repeatedly, for its well written scenes, Burton's acting, and a smattering of history as well, which is condensed and altered to fit the Hollywood format, but has some basis in truth; it is also fascinating to note that if one listens carefully, one will hear things reminiscent of recent news stories; history seems to be a wheel that is ever turning, and for the brief time that Alexander was in power, he would say ""The world is my domain, and my mission is to rule it and rebuild it"".

387813,4,6301964306,"With the recent Oliver Stone movie on Alexander just out, its always interesting to dive back and look at earlier versions of this subject.  One thing for sure, Colin Farrell cannot compare to Richard Burton!  Burton looks and acts the part, and is not all dolled up with dyed hair!  He has a commanding presence about him.  This film has a docu-drama quality to it, which may bore the average movie-goer, but at least there is a good effort to re-create the history of the time.

Here we get a stronger portrait of the tortured relationship between Alexander and his father, Philip II.  Frederic March is terrific in the role, and again, Val Kilmer loses out badly!  The qaulity of acting in this earlier movie far surpases the current epic on many levels.  Some may find this film a bit stiff, but at least it keeps close to its subject matter and never loses sight of it.  The same cannot be said of the recent Oliver Stone epic.

The production value for 1960 is pretty good, although perhaps not as impressive as the current version.  The battle scenes are brief, and not large scale.  Both movies fail to show the true origin of the Macedonian Phalanx system and how it would defeat the Persians. Here we see a brief version of the Battle of Cheronea in 336 BC which saw Philip and Alex defeat the last Greek resistence of Macedonia in the form of Athens and Thebes.  We get a small Granicus here, and no Issus.  Both Movies show Gaugamala (Arbela)and I would have to give the Oliver Stone movie more credit for showing this epic battle more impressively.

This older movie presents a striaght-forward portrait of Alexander.  There are no homo-erotic overtones which are popular today, and little deviation from the image we know of him.  The style of production is more standard and traditional.  Perhaps a little statuesque, some may find this film too stiff and boring, but it is a worthy companion to the current epic which seeks to wow its audience with special effects and visually imagery.  None of that here!  Burton gives a moody and convinving look at the great Macedonian, without having to show a lurid image.  Of course there are many views of Alexander to chose from, and one must decide which one suits their interests best.  If the more traditional view is sought then this movie should fit the bill nicely.",1101859200,22,2329,4.643031784841075
387814,2,6301964306,"Around 300 BC, Alexander The Great had conquered the known world. He was only 31.  It is said that he got a fever and died when he realized there were no worlds left to conquer.

At this writing, Oliver Stone's epic ""Alexander"" is getting a lot of UNWANTED attention due to its more than subtle hint of Alex's alleged bisexuality , so it's inevitable that similar themed digital editions will ride the publicity wave.

Black-listed director Robert Rossen's 1956 ALEXANDER THE GREAT (MGM) stars a mellifluous but somewhat effete (oops, maybe it was intentional) Richard Burton as the youthful world conqueror.

This widescreen transfer is not an epic with a cast of thousands in the tradition of ""Ben Hur,"" El Cid"" or even ""Spartacus."" But it does tell the major beats of Alexander's incredible story and tries to make it personal with enough of a psychological take to hold interest and not be pretentious.

Some of the locations are vast and the sets sometimes look like, well, sets.  Budget was obviously a concern as there are often only a smattring or extras when the scene demands thousands (except in a few cases when the local army served as extras).

The literate, thoughtful, screenplay hits the big beats of Alexander's incredible life but is sometimes a tad talky, and slow-moving.  The transfer looks and sounds great.  Frederick March and Claire Bloom costar.

Not a bad movie by any means, just not great.",1099785600,2,1419,4.850622406639004
387815,4,6301964306,"I have recently rented or purchased so-called ""remastered"" films on DVD and have frequently been very disappointed.  For instance, ""Pope Joan"" (1972) starring Liv Ullman, and ""Third Man On The Mountain"" (1959) starring James MacArthur.  Both are terrible film/disc transfers, with scratches, dirt and no color correction.  So, I shuddered to think what ""Alexander the Great"" would look like.  To my surprise, and enjoyment, the DVD transfer is very good, with excellent Surround sound.  The picture image (widescreen, 2:35.1) is free of dirt, scratches and distortion.

That said, the film is . . . well, what it is.  You can't go back and remake this particular version with this cast.  So, we're stuck with making the best tranfer we can with what we've got.

I heard that Burton disclaimed his performance because he so strongly disagreed with Robert Rossen's approach.  He was probably right.  You can see patches of a potentially good film, but Rossen's approach (plodding and episodic), with rough, patchy editing, destroys what vision he may have started with.  Characters come and go so frequently that it's hard to keep up without a playbill in your lap.  This is because Rossen told Alexander's ENTIRE life story, from birth to death. That's a lot of history, not to mention people,  to absorb in just over 2 hours.

Very good actors are given only limited screen time.  These seasoned character actors do the best with what they've got, but writer Rossen generally gives them only a thumb-nail sketch of their characters, people who are central to Alexander's life. I get the sense that this is the Reader's Digest version of a much longer movie.

Also, every scene feels exactly like the previous one.  Rossen's direction is simple, mechanical and workman-like.  Burton doesn't seem to ""grow"" into the role (but this, again, may be the result of choppy editing).  I am reminded that Burton's performance as Antony in ""Cleopatra"" (1963) was generally panned, but there was a situation where the director was forced by the studio to cut 2 1/2 hours, most of which turned out to be of Burton. Burton's REAL performance as Antony is lying around . . . somewhere.  It would be nice to see it.

The rssult (in ""Anexander"" as in ""Cleopatra"") is that Burton looks mechanical; he sounds the same at the end as he did in the beginning.  It is also true to say that Burton's acting style at this time was generally very much effected and way over-the-top.  (Look at the DVD of his Hamlet peformance on Broaway 8 years after ""Alexander).

Of course, we can vetch and vetch till Doombsday, but at least the DVD transfer is wholly satisfactory in preserving this interesting piece of movie history.",1099526400,12,2696,4.88546255506608
387816,4,6301964306,"I see that all other reviews where written before the Oct. 19th 04 release of this DVD, therefore referring to VHS only. I purchased and viewed this today, Oct. 27th. 04. It is not my intention to give this a detailed review as has been done at lenght eleswhere. Not my style anyway.
To write about Greek or Roman history/heros with all the factions and diverse warring rulers of those times is tedious at best. And a hard subject to put into a screenplay, to breathe the least. However this is a literate screenplay and all the players are mentioned, just a bit hard to follow unless you've read your Will Durant. Not just another popcorn flick.

No, I just want to say that if anyone is thinking of buying this DVD, I don't think you'd be disappointed, providing you love all the Hollywood epics of the 50's. If you do you may want this one too! Not the spectacle of Quo Vadis, Ben Hur, King of Kings or the pagentry of Cleopatra, but a worthy entry none the less. Matte paintings used in all aforementioned used here as well, but not as many. The Babalonian City is extraordinary and enough glass paintings to convey an epic, unlike the claustrophobic Spartacus. The sets are somewhat meger, like Spartacus, but what lacks there is made up for in the use of Technicolor and Cinemascope and the absolutely remarkable and stunning wardrobe. This is a terrific transfer and will look even better on your 16 x 9 HDTV! The 480 that DVD's put out look as though you might reach for that goblet on wine on the table.
Spain seems to double well for Greece and Persia and although the battles were not of the rousing kind, one over looks this as a trade off to the overall movie. This film also doesn't have that ''Hollywood touch'' of the others of the 50's and seems more adult for that reason {Barabbas 61' is another}.
So if you're looking for  another great but not Great 1950's epic just cut the Grodian Knot and ride out of the store on old Bucephalus!
Oh yes, I hope the up coming new release of Alexander, anticipated and welcomed, surpasses this version as there is nothing much better than a good movie, but this 1956 Richard Burton, Fredric March film may be above the mark in the end, as so many remakes or rehashed films can never come close the their predecessors, even with all of the CGI of today.

387817,2,6301964306,"Robert Rossen 1950's attempt at writing and directing a film on a character as intriguing and dynamic as Alexander The Great falls flat. The subject itself calls for only the most devoted and skilled masters of film which Rossen was not for purposes of this genre.

 Because Alexander The Great accomplished so much within only 13 of his 33 years of life, it is virtually impossible to make a good movie on that part alone in less than 3 hours. Richard Burton delivers a strong performance as Alexander but also seems too constrained; Butrton fails to deliver the youthful vigor of which Alexander had so much of. Not only was Alexander a king and conqueror, he was a military genius; a philosopher; a bold explorer; and, in his own mind anyway, a god amongst mortal men. Burton's performance often seems too grave and reserved and fails to reflect Alexander's dynamic personality.

 I did like the movie for its focus on Alexander's childhood but that also came short. Alexander's family in this film almost seems to be an excerpt from 'Leave It To Beaver' than the depiction of a pagan royal family that lived 2000 years ago. Although a military genius in his own right, Phillip was a debauche and drunkard whose bizzare sexual preferences shocked even his Greek neighbors. For example, after the battle of Charonea, Phillip II swaggered drunk around the corpses of the enemy and, lifting their heads as if seeking an audience, would yell for Demonsthenes (Athenian orator and staunch enemy of Phillip.) Olympias was a conspiring queen and pagan priestess whose incessant scheming were directed at both Alexander and/or Phillip at one point or another. The characters were poorly presented in this film.

 The movie doesn't really cover the campaign or its battles very well either. Looking at the movie, one barely gets any view as to how Alexander refined his father's tactics of the Macedonian phalanx to its peak; a military tactic unmatched until it came against the more fluid ones of the Roman legions almost 200 years later. The same is true as to Alexander's great siege of Tyre in which he built a mile-long jetti into the sea to connect with the City's gates; his hard fought geurilla campaign against Darius' renegade satraps; or his victories against Porus' elephants in India. There are also gross inaccuracies in the film in that Roxanne wasn't Darius III's daughter.

 Regardless of its flaws, this film is one hundred times better than Oliver Stone's new film on Alexander The Great: take my word for it. In the spirit of Phillip's last words of wisdom to his son, ""Viewers, ask for thyselves a greater movie, for that which Rossen and Stone leave you is too small for thee.""",1091145600,7,2694,4.841304347826087
387818,3,6301964306,"With films about Alexander the Great directed by Oliver Stone and Baz Luhrmann supposedly being released in 2004 and 2005 respectively, the 1956 film ""Alexander the Great"" from director Robert Rossen with Richard Burton in the title role is probably going to see renewed interest.  However, despite providing a realistic portrayal of a historical legend and being one of the most historically faithful films about the ancient world ever to be made, there is something missing from this would be epic.
""Alexander the Great"" was written, produced and directed by Rossen, who had won the Academy Award for ""All the King's Men"" (1949) and would be nominated gain for ""The Hustler"" (1961).  All three films have in common the realistic portrait of a complex psychological figure.  Burton plays Alexander as being both energetic and a visionary, with quicksilver changes in mood.  Alexander is both idealistic and practical, intelligent but hot-tempered, courageous but shrewd.  Although he conquers the Persian Empire while still basically a boy, this is a conqueror who suffers defeats and almost falls prey to becoming an Oriental potentate just like Darius (Harry Andrews), the Persian king he just conquered.  This is a man who can kill a friend in a moment of anger while drunk and weep over the body.
The more you know about the historical Alexander the more impressed you are by the film's fidelity to what appears in Plutarch.  Here is the Alexander who worshiped Achilles and loved Homer's ""Iliad,"" who was taught by Aristotle, cut the Gordian knot, destroyed Persepolis, and died a young man at Babylon.  The battles sequences, such as the battle at the river Granicus, run rather short, but are not all that bad.  The problem is that for all the complexity of Alexander's character and the intensity of Burton's performance, there is no real sense of mission or accomplishment to his conquering the known world.  We see what happened, but are curiously unaffected by the film's implicitly explanation for why he did it.
The rationale suggested by the film is found in Alexander's father, King Philip of Macedonia.  Played by Fredric March, Philip has a memorable scene after the battle of Chaeronea against the united city-states of Greece when he gets drunk and mocks the Athenian orator Demosthenes for having called him a barbarian.  When Philip is assassinated Alexander chases after the assassin and kills him, and even the most basic understanding of Freudian psychology tells us that the son will spend the rest of his life trying to impress his dead father.
In the end the explanation for conquering the world becomes the same as Sir Edmund Hillary's famous quote for why he climbed Mt. Everest.  To wit, ""Because it was there.""  When you are on top of the world, there is a certain logic to such a quip.  But when the subject is conquering the known world starting with a relatively small kingdom north of Greece, the same idea seems rather hollow.  Hopefully Stone and/or Luhrmann can come up with not only better explanations, but much better films.",1053129600,19,3066,4.982352941176471
387819,3,6301964306,"Someday, someone is going to make a great film about Alexander. Writer/director Robert Rossen took a crack at it in the mid-1950's, an era of epic films. The result was interesting but ultimately disappointing. Perhaps Rossen tried to squeeze too much into a standard running time. Some scenes, usually the historic ones, seem rushed and truncated while others, the fictionalised ones, seem superfluous. Visually, the film is quite good. In fact, it is one of those films where the stills are more impressive than the actual scenes.
But Rossen obviously wanted to make an ""intelligent"" epic. Some of the script and casting reflect that. The supporting cast has a number of respected British thesps -Claire Bloom, Harry Andrews, Peter Cushing, Michael Hordern, Stanley Baker. But there are also a lot of Italians whose dialogue is dubbed by those same two guys who did all the film dubbing in the 1950's. One can only wonder who chose Fredric March (hammy as ever) as Philip of Macedon or Danielle Darrieux (who apparently had only one facial expression) as his mischievous queen.
But the critical casting was Richard Burton as Alexander. He certainly looks the part, despite the blonde hair. But he frequently suffers from his career-long inability to adapt his stage-acting technique to the more intimate demands of cinema. Or maybe that's how he thought a wannabe god should behave. You sit there praying for him to lighten up - just a little.
For the rest, the many battle scenes tend to be confusing rather than spectacular, the uncertain pace suggests a lot of pre-release cuts were made, and the music not only sounds primitive but seems to have been recorded in somebody's basement. Still, the film is an interesting failure. But you end up admiring its ambitions more than its results.",1022716800,7,1793,4.98

Hot Toasty Rag, July 20, 2017

In the 1950s, it was a big craze in Hollywood to make biblical or otherwise ancient epics. You know the famous ones, and you have your favorites you watch every Easter. Chances are Alexander the Great is not one of them, and for good reason. Its terrible. Its as if Robert Rossen told his cast to overact during the dress rehearsal, and then he accidentally filmed it.

Richard Burton, donning a hilarious blond wig with poufy bangs, plays the title role. Fredric March and Claire Bloom play his parents, and each only wears one expression during their scenes. Claires says, I don't think that tuna sandwich agreed with me, and Freddys says, Did I walk on the wrong film set by mistake?

Alexander the Great is supposed to be a historical epic with lots of dramatic battle scenes, tension-filled romances, and family arguments. Every attempt is met with failure. Besides 1954s The Silver Chalice, Ive never seen a worse ancient epic. You really don't want to watch this one, even if its your favorite genre in the world. Its amazing Hollywood even tried to make another movie of that type after this disaster. Its amazing that Richard Burton had any form of career after 1956. But its not amazing that every other movie in the world will look good by comparison. Or, in the words of my mom, No wonder Ben-Hur was a big hit!",1500508800,,1384,4.617886178861789
