1048734,1,6305603804,"When I bought this video, I expected it to be great.  I love kickboxing, and I have been dancing since I was three.  (I am thirteen now.)
I am an advanced dancer, and the moves were nearly impossible.  This is not  because they were too difficult, but they only show you the move once, and  then go into ""hyperspeed.""  Also, the awkward camera angles were  horrible.  Half the time they showed C-Note when I was trying to master the  steps.
C-Note is a joke.  They talk about the ancient martial art forms  when it is obvious they have no clue what they're talking about.  And if I  hear those guys say, ""Y'all"" one more time, I'm chucking the tai  funk aerobics tape out the window.  That movement with my arm would give me  about the level of fitness I reached with C-Note.",954460800,4,775,4.352112676056338
1048735,2,6305603804,"I bought this workout because it was one of first dance-aerobic routines available on DVD. It looked fun and intense. From MTV, I expected something very up-to-date with good moves and better-than-average music.
It wasn't  as good as it looked. Strange camera angles make it difficult to learn the  moves. Often, the camera cuts away to an info screen and there's not enough  verbal instruction to keep up without any visual input.
Some of the  instructors were quite good, giving clear explanations of how to get the  most out of the steps they were teaching. However, many of the moves were  taught by CNote members who, while fun to watch, obviously didn't really  know what they were doing.
I would have expected the workout to be a bit  more intense than it was, but with practice it's probably possible to funk  up the moves enough to make it worthwhile. Overall, the DVD may be a  worthwhile investment for CNote fans, but probably not as a fitness tool.",951091200,19,961,4.700598802395209
1048736,1,6305603804,"I am 35 and found this video very frustrating.  The beginning is a good warm up with interesting Tai chi moves.  The dance part is all instruction on learning one routine, taking 20 minutes, then executing it only once.  I  was sweating very little.  The camera angle moves right when you really  need it, away from the dancers bodies , to thier faces.  I would not  recommend this video.  However my 7 year old liked watching the group  C-Note perform at the end.",951004800,7,464,4.481927710843373
1048737,5,6305603804,"I have been doing kickboxing for a long time and it can get very boring.  I did this video and it gave me new inspiration because it added the element of fun as well as being a good cardio workout.  Anyone can count 8  punches but add in a dance move (they are easy to follow) and you'll see  how much more fun it is.  I love the people in it too!  The trainer Heidi  has alot of great energy and the guys from cnote look like they are having  a blast.  I got a great workout once I got the routine and having all those  cool people to watch helped motivate me.  I also really liked the self  defense segment at the end. Unlike other videos like Tae Bo this one  actually shows you what the martial arts moves are supposed to do in real  life.  That makes so much more sense to me! I have ordered tons of workout  videos and this is my favorite.  Good Job Heidi,Cnote and dancers!",950918400,2,880,4.023255813953488
1048738,5,6305603804,"MTV's latest edition of the ""The Grind"" series is clearly their best.  The creative nature of adding yet another new twist (hunky boy band C Note) to work out and sing with MTV's hottest host/trainer Heidi  VanAmburgh is exciting and new.  VanAmburgh has an unbelievable repoir with  the boys from C Note combined with her gorgeous looks and funky dance moves  make this video a ""must see"".  This video is at times challenging  and not for the novice aerobics individual, but the self defense segment at  the end of the video is very good and practical for all.  MTV has really  picked a superstar in Heid VanAmburgh, she makes the whole video!",950400000,2,644,4.669642857142857
1048739,4,6305603804,I just got this video and the first day i did it i was so pumped- the ppl in the video are very encouraging and the dance moves are just fun- i wish they would do the routine more though-but other then that no complaints-  +C-NOTE is very good reason to excersise everyday!,949363200,,273,4.150943396226415
1048740,5,6305603804,This is a great workout video. If you love to dance its great for you. The beginning part is a little hard if your not used to it but after a while its very envigorating. Plus you have C-Note there to help you the whole  way. They are a great motivation. If you can't get motivated by them then  something is wrong with you. They are so hot. But this video is for a dancer  if you don't like dance of have trouble with choreography then check  another video out. Plus a song by C-Note at the end makes it all worth it.  Plus there is a self-defense section on the tape!,947894400,2,569,4.044642857142857
1048741,2,6305603804,"Although the Tai Funk Dance moves are fun to learn, this video is not what it promised.  Camera angles make it difficult to learn the dance moves for one thing.  Next, once you do manage to learn the routine, they only do the  whole routine three times before the video concludes.  Most exericse  videos, such as Tai Bo, teach the moves individually and then have a 20-30  minute routine encompassing all you've learned.  I didn't even work up a  sweat doing this workout.  Therefore, if your only interested in learning  some new dance moves, then purchas this video.  If you are actually wanting  to exercise, purchase Tai Bo.",947462400,42,628,4.712962962962963
7891759,5,6305603804,This workout came across my path many years ago. It is fun and gives you a ton of energy. The beginning is the hardest. Stretches every part of your body. The moves/positions are simple but VERY effective!,1369785600,,205,4.5675675675675675
7891760,4,6305603804,"Although some of the moves and dancers are kind of corny, this is actually a good workout for those who hate exercising but like to dance. This is the second Grind video I've done, so it was nice to find something a little different. There are several different sections - a Nei-Kung-based warmup, the dance workout, a cool down, a ""performance"" by C-Note (or C-list, as they should be called), and then a section that showcases self-defense moves to use in real-life situations. The workout itself is really excellent - you definitely get to work out each muscle! The only thing I found super annoying was the inclusion of C-Note in this video - not only did they yap incessantly during the workout and have an unnecessary performance, but they weren't really necessary for the making of this video.

Other issues: Occasionally, the screen will be blocked out with an informational tidbit in the middle of the workout, which can sometimes make it difficult to follow along to the dancers' new moves. There are also low-impact variations of the workouts, but you don't see the person doing the low-impact version for most of the workout (which kind of defeats the purpose, don't you think??).

If you like dancing and getting some easy cardio in, this is definitely a good way to get in shape. The self-defense tutorial seems a little too phony to take seriously, but you may learn something new. If you can ignore C-List and the silliness of the dancers, this workout just may be for you.",1294617600,,1489,4.745173745173745
7891761,3,6305603804,I think this is the worst Grind video ever made. I don't care for C-Note in it and I don't like the fact that Eric is not in this one as he is a great workout leader. It is also a boring video as it tends to drag on and on and then when it gets good if you have carpet some moves can be hard to do.  My advise is to skip this one and go for one of the other Grind videos.,1107820800,5,371,3.4166666666666665
7891762,3,6305603804,"That now is my main attraction to the tape because the instruction is so well-done it drags onnnnnnnn and onnnnnnnn... However it is an interesting, unique concept - the mixture of dance and gentle martial arts moves, but... there's too much talking and not enough moving. It takes forever to gain momentum then when you nail the sequence they move on to the next endlessly-long break-down of instruction. This tape does have a great *fun* engergy level, it's sexy, and if you like gazing at male 20-somethings in their resplendent, physical prime, it's hard to go wrong. In fact...even when I'm mentally critquing this tape's bad points, I'm praising the physical beauty that abounds. Men, men, men.
Some of the moves are very intriguing, challaging, and the concept is grand but the usefulness points are few and far between. You basically stand around and 'wait' in this one. If they would have grouped instruction from actual routines it would made all the difference in pace and satisfaction.
Buy it as either an innocent, sexual novelity or a tape to provide a very-occasional physical work-out diversion when you want to practice extreme patience or Disney's version of a high school gym atmosphere when the cheerleaders and jocks are at their best (said with a grin).",1037664000,10,1275,4.962616822429907
7891763,4,6305603804,"This video was kind of hard at first, but once I got the routine down, I absolutely loved it.  I love to dance and this workout was more like a dance than any exercise video I had ever done before.  Plus, I lost about 10 lbs., after about 4-5weeks of doing it 4 days a week. So, if you love to dance this one is definitely one for you!!!!",1007337600,6,338,3.8840579710144927
7891764,2,6305603804,The only thing I like about this video was the beginning warm up with Chi Kung.  That part was something to learn and use regularly.  The workout is just a group of people teaching us one section at a time of a dance routine which is kind of complicated.  After finally getting it down its not something you would want to do again.  I was really dissapointed with this video.,981676800,3,375,4.314285714285714
7891765,1,6305603804,"This video starts off with a tae chi warm up. Then has 20 minutes of dance  aerobics.  The tae Chi is all right, but they don't hold the positions  long enough to do you any good. I had to constently pause the tape in order  to get a good work out.  Which is not what I conserder fun. The instructor  is very good but the ""grind dancers"" look like they don't know  what they are doing during this part. To make matters worse it seems they  focuse on the poeple who are the worst at Tae chi. If your interested in  this aspect a purely Tae Chi work out video would be better.
The dance  aerobics made me feel as if I had two left feet. The steeps range from  moderately easy to moderately hard.  However, between each steep they stop  and walk for minute while they explain the next steep. Which is helpful the  first time you watch the video but gets very old very fast on subsequent  viewings.  In addition ""C-note"" and the aerobics instructor is  annoying.  They spend too much time playing up to the preteen age  ""HEY"" ""You GO GIRL"" crowd, to the point of making all  but the valley girls sick.  If your interested in either the dance  aerobics or the tae Chi there are much better places to spend your money  then this.",968889600,,1223,4.244541484716157
7891766,1,6305603804,"I bought this DVD because there were only 2 other exercise DVD's in existence at the time.  ""MTV"" seemed to imply a vigorous ""youthful"" workout.  I'm 47.  I didn't even work up a sweat.  The  first 30 minutes revealed routines lasting from 12-15 seconds, repeated  only twice.  The last 5 minutes consisted of four 40 second routines.  This  is not what I call aerobic exercise.  Save your money!  Shame, MTV!",957830400,2,409,4.7
7891767,5,6305603804,"This is a great workout. It got me pumped the first day I did it. I did it with a friend, It takes a while to learn the moves but if you sit down and watch it first then you'll have a pretty good idea. One of C-Note does the  low impact version so if you're a beginer or advanced exerciser it doesn't  matter. It's fun and energizing. Buy it.",957484800,2,342,3.8714285714285714
7891768,1,6305603804,"This is a terrible workout video unless you like to learn the moves and then do them on your own.  First of all the moves were hard to pick up because the camera is viewing at terrible angles and half the time an  information screen blocks out the whole picture.
I spent a lot of time  jogging in place or doing my own thing while C note stood around blabbing.  The program is very disjointed.  If you appreciate the fluidity of going  from move to move like Tae-Bo then you'll be bored out of your skull with  this video.
There are many better videos out there.  Don't bother with  this one.",954892800,4,592,4.261261261261262
