Sometimes you go in for a film with zero expectations and you come out pleasantly surprised, Lahore is one such film. Despite no big stars the film completely works thanks to its direction and acting and excelling in all its technical departments and most importantly for being a very good sports film.",1301270400,,527,5.285714285714286
