8320142,5,B001LX4BWS,"William Wallace is the greatest hero of Scotland, but there is relatively little known about him that can be called factual. After seeing the movie ""Brave Heart"" with Mel Gibson, I looked for more factual information, and I found that in the book ""William Wallace"" by James Mackay. These gave me a better foundation for the movie being reviewed, and it was much better than the portrayal by Mel Gibson, with regard to facts. Like John Wayne's ""The Alamo,"" Gibson's rendition is good entertainment, but it is short on factuality. One of the things both movies had in common was their portrayal of Wallace the man, and both came up short in this regard. That is, Wallace was a huge man about 6' 8"" tall, and both actors in the movies missed this mark by a large margin. Other than this it is was a pretty good movie.
