7980313,4,B000089783,"A snappy not too predictable actioner and despite its limited budget one of Moon Lee's better movies. I got the improved re-release World Video DVD which includes useful filmography lists and other trailers. It is passably dubbed and appears to be multi-regional. I live in the UK and have a Region 1-capable player but prefer to use an R2 standard player when possible, as is the case with this item.
Yuen Bun choreographs lots of exciting fights, one even before the title credits. A girl-on-girl battle between Moon Lee and assassin Fujimi Nadeki was one of my highlights, and I wished it could have been given more prominence (i.e. made longer) in place of one of the many ""rat-a-tat"" sequences, but it was good while it lasted.
Benny, the loose cannon, whom Lee and her partner (Wilson Lam) recruit for their special op is broodingly well played by Hugo Ng. A secretive character with a dark past, revealing a terrifying would-be rapist who then unexpectedly transforms into something else. Indeed most of the support characters are delineated clearly and decently acted, which is more than can be said for many bigger kung fu epics.
The makers also have the sense to show that Lee, skilled fighter though she is, has a petite kind of prettiness that makes her vulnerable. Sure, she often holds her own against burly guys through speed and agility but it is only realistic to expect that she sustains some wincing hard knocks (I always care about what is happening to the hero should it be a woman rather than if it is the usual he-man).
I noted from the IMDb site that Yukari Oshima and Sibelle Hu are somewhere down in the cast list. I failed to spot them and wonder how much of the original release has been cut. Despite that, still enjoyable.",1363996800,,1751,4.688311688311688
7980314,3,B000089783,"In 'Angel Force', Ah Mun(Moon Lee Choi Fung) portrays an HK cop who travels, with some black ops commandos, to Thailand to rescue a gweilo(Foreigner)bureaucrat from a drug kingpin. 'Angel Force' is flawed, forgettable, and nothing special. Also, too many of the music cues in the film sound like porno music. The jungle warfare scenes make this film feel like a poor man's Rambo. However, its decent performances and solid action(staged by Yuen Bun) help the film pack a good punch. Also, I, personally, enjoy watching the sweet, petite Moon Lee shooting and beating the crap out of men twice, or triple, her size. Well, on screen, at least. Now, on to World Video's DVD. The World Video DVD is pretty lackluster(as with most World Video DVD's): the 1:85 letterbox format is shown in a 1:33 full screen version, there's no theatrical trailer, no restoration, no subtitles, and a lame collection of video spots with cheesy techno music over them, etc. In the DVD's favor, it's watchable in Cantonese, Mandarin, or English(although, they're all labeled ""German"" for some odd reason), and the budget price is nice. 'Angel Force' may not appeal to all, but action junkies may enjoy it.",1094774400,6,1181,4.939698492462312
