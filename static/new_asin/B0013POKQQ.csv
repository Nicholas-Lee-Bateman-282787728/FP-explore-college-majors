8252513,5,B0013POKQQ,"No, its not really movies you watch every day. This is reality of real reality as in actual life. Short pieces stick together, non-stop action, chicks as we, men, like them--naked and half naked and the only thing missing is actual sex. I have impression that these are internet types movies and they are way of future unless you really disabled and not capable to think logically. Enjoy.",1325635200,,388,4.720588235294118
8252514,4,B0013POKQQ,the movie is good. There are a lot of sexy ladys in this movie. It has so good action in this movie.,1318291200,,100,3.590909090909091
8252515,1,B0013POKQQ,"Actiongirls: Soldiers of the Dead, Part 1 (Scotty Jx, 2007)

(In case you've been wondering for the last three years, (a) I pity you, and (b) from what I have been told, the sequel is actually Horrorbabe Part 1 rather than Soldiers of the Dead Part 2, which was never released. Now you know.)

I have seen some bad movies in my time. In fact, I seem to thrive on bad movies. (This probably comes from my liking to write really, really bad reviews of things.) And while I can't say that Actiongirls: Soldiers of the Dead Part 1 is the worst movie I've ever seen--in fact, it's not even the worst movie I've seen this month, it's far too technically competent for that--it is such a complete waste of celluloid that I find it difficult to believe that anyone, upon seeing the finished product, was willing to release it. I do realize this is (almost certainly) a self-released film, but wouldn't a director with as much experience as Scotty Jx have been embarrassed enough to at least try and beg someone to put together something even remotely resembling a script? What's worse, Internet horror and exploitation movie review sites have been reviewing this thing in terms only slightly calmer than orgasmic. I have no earthly idea what they saw, but it wasn't this movie. Or if it was, I want some of whatever they ingested before watching it.

I'm not even going to give this thing the dignity of attempting a plot synopsis. It has no plot whatsoever. There are a lot of relatively attractive and often naked Eastern European women (roughly half the dialogue is in what I assume is Russian, the other half in very heavily accented English) running around in knockoff Nazi uniforms and playing gladiator, and about halfway through the film there's some sort of silliness about zombies. Other than that, if you want to try and figure out a plot, you're on your own.

I long to give this movie zero stars, or maybe half a star, but I simply can't bring myself to do it, because Scotty Jx and his team are actually very good at what they do.  For a movie as low-budget as this obviously is, the camerawork and sound are top-notch, and the editing is perfect. Now if only they could come up with some material on which to use their talents, they might actually crank out, at the very least, a really good bad movie. This is not it. *",1277251200,,2327,4.5178147268408555
8252516,3,B0013POKQQ,"Poor Scotty JX. He's trying.

(Well, I can't have too much sympathy for him...look at the women whom he gets to work with. Jeeeeeez!)

This is the closest thing yet to an actual movie in the Actiongirls series. While all of the ""basic"" volumes tout themselves as movies, none of them really are. This one is...almost. It features voiceovers not found in Volumes 1 through 5 or in ""Water and Fitness"" that actually formulate a plot--sort of--and help move it along...to a degree.

The first half of this really does seem feature-film-like and actually is quite entertaining on its own two legs, hot naked women aside. After that, things get upended. I lost track of what was going on and never really caught back up.

Ordinarily for an Actiongirls release, this wouldn't be too bothersome. Nobody is watching this kind of thing for narrative flow and plot constructs. Except that ""Soldiers of the Dead Part 1"" features much, MUCH less exposure of female bodies than any other Actiongirls release. Gone are the contrived vignettes that feature actresses like Susanna Spears (who really is fantastic here, showing some actual acting chops) inexplicably stripping down to nothing before and after firing large-caliber machine guns. Scotty JX really was trying to make an actual movie, so the viewer needs a little more traditional plot to stay interested this time around.

""Soldiers of the Dead"" fits the bill for the first 45 minutes or so, then takes a weird left turn and never gets back on track. And it's a shame that the first half is the half with all of the nakedness. If anything, Scotty should have coupled the worst half of the story with the most nudity, not the other way around. You wouldn't miss much here if you turned it off after the midway point. Spears does have a nice shower scene in the last half but other than that, as stated by another reviewer, no nudity at all.

So the real question: Is this worth purchasing? Unless you're buying all of the Actiongirls releases, probably not. Worth watching once for Spears if for no other reason. And those who have seen the other Actiongirls ""movies"" might want to check this one out just to see how close that the director came to a real feature film. He even pulled off somewhat-seamless editing in the first half!",1240704000,4,2279,4.742424242424242
8252517,3,B0013POKQQ,Susanna Spears has the hottest rear end.  At the opening scene you will have no debate once you see it.  Too bad the scene with Miss Spears and the naked lesbian slavegirls don't take up the full 90 minutes.  If you want to see more of Susanna Spears...check out mcn nudes.,1236297600,4,273,4.313725490196078
8252518,4,B0013POKQQ,"When it comes to softcore movies, I rarely find that plot matters. Your in it for one thing, THE GIRLS! If it has a plot, you're lucky. There is plot to this but not worth following. Susana Spears is great! Kicking butt sans clothing. My only issue - the second half of the movie any kind of nudity is gone. Not what I'd have expected, but we'll have to see how Scotty JX does on the second movie.

If you are a fan of fully naked chicks this is one to own.",1234396800,4,457,3.967391304347826
