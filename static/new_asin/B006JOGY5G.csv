8499746,5,B006JOGY5G,"I LOVE this Kdrama. It's a story about a girl's journey to valuing herself. You can't value, respect, and love others until you can do the same for yourself. As for as the DVDs themselves, the English translations are very good. My only issue is that there is about a minute and a half preview of a Korean boy band group that is played before the menu page. You can't skip to the menu or fast forward. It's a little annoying but the drama is so good, it was worth it. I usually just leave the room, text a friend, etc so I don't have to watch it. Definitely get this drama! It is full of suspense and full of superb acting!",1348963200,3,623,4.114754098360656
