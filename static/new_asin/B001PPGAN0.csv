8334182,3,B001PPGAN0,"A convoluted murder mystery involving many suspects and three corpses (not counting the suicide).  The first victim is a skunk and ham actor (Paul Cavanagh as Wylie Thornton), he cheats on his wife with three actresses (and a lovelorn chimpanzee named Geraldine, more often referred to as the monk).  The second victim is the actor's wife.  The third victim is an abusive prop master.  Enter the captain of detectives, Martin Gallagher (Sam Hardy).  He's an idiot and spends the rest of the movie proving it.  At one point, he arrests everyone he suspects of the murder, any of the murders, all of the murders, once they start piling up.  Fortunately, he is accompanied by a much smarter detective (C. Aubrey Smith as Jim Hanvey).  There's also a wise-cracking reporter hanging around (Russell Hopton as Terry Mooney).  The murders are eventually solved but not without a lot of confusion.  Everything is wrapped up in haste at the last minute, making for an unsatisfactory conclusion.

I bought this movie primarily for C. Aubrey Smith, who does a fine job but he isn't in this film enough to make it worth watching again.
Barely adequate.",1431129600,,1140,4.885416666666667
8334183,2,B001PPGAN0,"Best think in the movie is the chimpanzee.  The rest is tired and over done.  One of the women that is killed, the movie ends and you still have no idea who killed her.  You're also left with the idea that the chimpanzee killed the prop man that took care of her. And why on earth the woman committed suicide doesn't make sense or fit the story line.  Not even a decent B movie. The mark of a good B movie is being able to at least make fun if it.  This is to muddled and confusing to even think of bothering with.",1405728000,,514,3.9514563106796117
8334184,3,B001PPGAN0,"Wylie Thornton (Paul Cavanagh) does some big time philandering. He has several women hooked including the chimpanzee. He puts out the standard story that he is going to leave his wife of whom he has never talked to in quite some time; all the time his wife is listening and snickering in the background.

It doesn't take us long to realize who's going to be shot. However the plot is more complex than you would suspect. An inept policeman Marty Gallagher (Sam Hardy) suspects everybody and as usual comes near to arresting everybody. Only Detective Jim Hanvey (C. Aubrey Smith) can glean the truth out of this complex situation. He must do so before reporter Terry Mooney (Russell Hopton) does some gleaning of his own.

It is a fun movie. However they do a lot of fumbling and make up obscure connections between people and events. Oh yes, I think C. Aubrey Smith must of been born old.",1402531200,,888,4.613924050632911
8334185,2,B001PPGAN0,"This movie seemed interesting because of C. Aubrey Smith, who always reminds me of an old walrus with his deep voice and large mustache. I had seen him in many old movies, such as in one of the THIN MAN movies. So I wanted to see him as the detective. Paul Cavanagh is also an actor who was in many 30's movies, such as KENNEL CLUB MURDER and some of the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes productions. But I was disappointed in the meandering plot which didn't make much sense and the dated humor. Oh, well. You can't win 'em all.",1381276800,,521,4.2727272727272725
8334186,4,B001PPGAN0,"The set up of the mystery is pretty conventional. An over-amorous leading man (Paul Cavanagh as Wylie Thornton) feels like he must mate with every woman between 18 and 35 who crosses his path. All the while he's telling each of them that she is the only one for him. In one case though Wylie over-achieves and actually marries one of the women (Natalie Moorhead as Alma). That is a mystery in itself since Wylie is quite the social climber yet when he marries he does so with his secretary, the two are not living together, and he treats her badly but expects her to keep their marriage a secret. Even stranger is she DOES keep their secret and continues on as his secretary! But Natalie Moorhead does shine in the part of the wife. She sleeps with Wylie when the urge hits her then ridicules him in the morning and demands extra spending money. Maybe that's why he seems to hate her so much - she's the only one of his women who seems to see him for the not so wily ham actor that he is.

When Wylie is shot at his birthday party after the lights go out, there are a multitude of suspects. Two detectives are brought in on the case - Martin Gallagher (Sam Hardy), a young detective, is in charge. His subordinate, Jim Hanvey (C. Aubrey Smith), is a much older man. The younger detective is always going off half cocked and jumping to conclusions, and the older detective is methodical and does not confront the younger detective about his careless methods. He just investigates in his own quiet way. In the end, when the younger detective thinks he has solved the crime, Hanvey lets him believe he is right and take the credit because it doesn't mean false arrest for anyone (I'll let you watch and see what I mean), plus, as Hanvey tells the actual killer, he would have done the same in their shoes. Thus the ending is definitely precode in that an actual killer goes unpunished.

The unexpected history lesson I was talking about is when one of the reporters is hounding the younger detective for information. When the younger detective tells the reporter something he thinks is ridiculous his retort is ""says Hitler!"". I guess a popular alternative phrase in 1933 would have been ""nuts to you"". In other words, in 1933 at least, Hitler was seen as just a buffoonish little man.

I'd recommend this as one of the better poverty row productions I've seen. It really is a showcase for C. Aubrey Smith, who usually played supporting roles in films at the bigger studios. Just don't expect much in the way of sets because these smaller studios didn't have the money for such niceties.",1369526400,2,2584,4.528907922912206
8334187,1,B001PPGAN0,Very poor movie. The color is awful and the sound is bad as well. Not one you will want to keep,1367193600,4,95,3.5714285714285716
8334188,2,B001PPGAN0,"Here's the deal, it is a bit choppy.  I can handle black and white.  That doesn't bother me.  This, however, is a rough copy.  It was cheap enough, but I'm afraid that in this case you get what you pay for.  If you really want to see this film, see if there is another version somewhere.",1353974400,5,287,4.053571428571429
8334189,4,B001PPGAN0,"Majestic Pictures Corporation presents ""CURTAIN AT EIGHT"" (1933) (62 min/B&W) -- Starring: Dorothy Mackaill, C. Aubrey Smith, Paul Cavanagh, Sam Hardy & Russell Hopton

Directed by E. Mason Hopper

A ""locked door"" murder mystery, Curtain at Eight, takes place at a Broadway theater, where a much-hated stage star Wylie Thornton (Paul Cavanaugh) is bumped off early in the proceedings. Crusty city detective Jim Hanvey (C. Aubrey Smith) and his dim-witted assistant Marty Gallagher (Sam Hardy) try to solve the crime before fast-talking reporter Terry Mooney (Russell Hopton) beats them to the punch.

The actor C. Aubrey Smith is one of my most favorite character actors from the past, with his stiff upper lip disposition.

Watch for an almost unrecognizable Walter Brennan as the Silent Detective.

Excellent light-hearted who-dun-it with loads of suspects to choose from -- much like Charlie Chan, Mr. Wong and Mr. Moto.

* Not a bad copy from Alpha Video, who at times has less than favorable product.

8334190,5,B001PPGAN0,"When the opening shot of a movie is of a ""cute"" pet monkey, one usually is right to groan at a probably ""jumping the shark"" misadventure.  In this instance, however, the monkey is as resourcefully charming as, say, Friday in the Edward Arnold ""blind detective"" series and at least as delightful as Asta ... with more plot advancing aptness and less antic preciousness.

The movie itself overflows with visual variety, pre-Code savvy, and a story with enough twists and glam suspects to merit more than one viewing.",1242259200,28,514,4.896551724137931
