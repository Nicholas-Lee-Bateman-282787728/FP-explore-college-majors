8600629,5,B00E3J9P6Y,"I REALLY WISH THIS WAS ON DVD! I was 13 when this was shown on ABC TV back in 1974. A very taunt thriller (Lloyd Bridges was chilling as the deranged German tank commander),but it also featured an astounding example of my favorite fighter plane from WWII,a shark mouthed P-40 Warhawk in desert camouflage! One of the BEST movies I've ever seen.",1463961600,3,344,4.564516129032258
8600630,5,B00E3J9P6Y,"Good war film from 1973 starring Lloyd Bridges, Doug McClure, Eric Braden, and Roy Thinnes. It tells the story of two American fighter pilots. When the first is shot down during an attack on a Nazi convoy ( Roy Thinnes) the second pilot (Doug McClure) lands his P-40 fighter plane an runs to his aid. As they make their way back to the plane, a Nazi Panzer Tank appears and begins shooting at them. They make it back to the plane and begin to taxi as the Panzer continues to shoot at them. Right before reaching take off speed, the Nazi Panzer makes a lucky shot, the shell detonating close enough to hole one of the planes' wings, rendering it unable to fly. This begins a cross country pursuit as the pilots try to out run the pursuing Panzer across the desert-driving their damaged P-40! Lloyd Bridges plays the deranged General Hans Pimler who is bent on revenge against McClure and Thinnes for the earlier attack on the convoy. The movie was produced by Harve Bennet, the man who produced the excellent Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan. The supporting cast includes Eric Braden (currently playing billionaire Victor Newman on the long running daytime soap The Young and the Restless) as  Stoeffer . A good, solid film that deserves to be released to DVD/Blu Ray.",1426723200,5,1265,4.597345132743363
