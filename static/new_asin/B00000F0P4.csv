As the programs got underway, one could tell that the ""stars"", Norm, Steve and Tom, were all pretty nervous about this  massive undertaking.  As the programs progressed and the house became  beautiful once more, their relief was almost palpable.  This project and  the resulting video doesn't seem as ""sawdusty"" and some of the  other ""get in, do the stuff and get out"" type.  The only thing I  didn't agree with was not really keeping the house ""historically  correct"" and the fact that most of the stuff they put in the house is  beyond any normal person's reach.  But other than that, I would leave a  smoke trail if anyone offered me the opportunity to live in that  ""house of dreams""",964569600,5,765,4.611940298507463
7906247,5,B00000F0P4,"My wife gave me the ""This Old House: A Dream House"" video series and I watched all 9 hours in one weekend. It is frustrating to watch This Old House on PBS and have to wait the whole season to see how the project  turns out, but not with this video!  They cover everything from demolition  to wallpaper.  A definite bargain.",943315200,14,324,4.262295081967213
