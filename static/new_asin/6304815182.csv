7879453,5,6304815182,"To me, this is the best performance of OD & TA.  Every song is great.  The choir is wonderful.  Their parts are on point.  The soloists are wonderful.  It is 100% OD & TA- no guest appearances.  A must-have for all gospel music fans.  All the songs, as I said, are great.  Some that stand out are ""He's Faithful,"" ""His Blood Washes Me,"" ""I've Gotta Reason,"" and ""Gotta Feelin'.""",989020800,,378,4.3768115942028984
