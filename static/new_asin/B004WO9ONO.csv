4488012,5,B004WO9ONO,"I found the stuff bout corn amazing.
The stuff about Xanthan gum, and corn DNA is fascinating. They don't go in to the tax subsisted they get.
I look forward to watching the rest of the series.",1353456000,,193,4.243243243243243
4488013,5,B004WO9ONO,"I found this video to be informative.  The narration and video are well done.  If you are curious of various uses of salt, you should check this out.  I hope Amazon will get more seasons of howstuffworks.",1350864000,,204,4.45945945945946

4488016,5,B004WO9ONO,"It u s an interesting,  yet informative show.  I just learned how important salt is to the film industry, and how many uses corn has.",1390262400,,133,4.28
4488017,5,B004WO9ONO,"Very interesting and engaging.  It is amazing to see the scale of production for these things we take for granted everyday. I especially enjoyed learning about the small growers in Columbia and elsewhere in south America  Best of all, I now have a few tips on how to better store and brew my morning coffee.",1389830400,,307,4.5636363636363635
4488018,5,B004WO9ONO,"After I retired, we cancelled Cable TV (too expensive). We now have an attic antenna and receive channels via airway.  I have slowly been building my DVD Library and I love programs such as ""How Stuff Works"".",1388620800,,208,4.621621621621622
4488019,4,B004WO9ONO,It was an okay video but very general. I was expecting a little more detail. It seemed more like a promo video.,1386460800,,111,4.090909090909091
4488020,4,B004WO9ONO,"Overall the series is pretty good but they sometimes try to stretch too far to fit the theme.  The summertime episode is a good example.  They credit summer in Egypt (flood season) with freeing people up to work on the pyramids.  Then they go on about what a feat it was considering they didn""t have the wheel.  Guess they missed the part about the chariots.  Maybe they weren't using the wheel in an engineering sense but it just sounded overly dramatic.

The more straightforward topics are a bit better, though i haven't seen all of them.",1383091200,,541,4.583333333333333

4488025,4,B004WO9ONO,"I enjoyed the episodes - they are informative and interesting.

4488027,5,B004WO9ONO,"If you think you know everything about your food and drink well think again. This documentary is factual and interesting. I liked it because it was segmented by product which gave me the ability to watch each segment at times convenient to me. It was very educational, enlightening, and well worth my time.",1370217600,2,306,4.7924528301886795
4488028,5,B004WO9ONO,This is really cool to show to the kids.  They need to know that the products that surround us take a ton of work and ingenuity to get to the shelves.,1369872000,,150,3.838709677419355
4488029,4,B004WO9ONO,"Very informative series.  It is amazing that we can sit on, eat with and consume as food or a drink, the same ingredient: CORN!  Wheat and coffee were also very interesting.  I like the mixture of serious and more frivolous data.",1368144000,,229,4.536585365853658
4488030,4,B004WO9ONO,I love this type of show. can you ever know too much? I do not think so. Discovery does a great job.,1366761600,,100,3.590909090909091

4488032,5,B004WO9ONO,This show was far more educational that I expected. I'm a home-brewer and this show just helped to reiterate why I love home brewing.,1364169600,,133,4.583333333333333

8445434,5,B004WO9ONO,"I really liked this show and was intending to watch more, but was really dismayed that you'd taken it off Amazon Prime! :(  I hope you'll consider adding it back in - very interesting and reminded me of another similar show, ""Modern Marvels.""",1395014400,,242,4.627906976744186
8445435,4,B004WO9ONO,The episodes regarding beer and coffee were the most interesting to me. They were pretty informative but not in a boring way,1395014400,,124,4.681818181818182
8445436,4,B004WO9ONO,"Watching good clean, entertaining, and educational programing like this show is refreshing. Aftering watching, you come away saying ""I didn't know that!""  I wish brodcasters would offer more good, clean, educational TV. These shows not only entertain us, but make our time in front of the TV...time well spent.
Big Moe",1394582400,,318,5.235294117647059
8445437,2,B004WO9ONO,"I'm usually not one to leave something half-watched, but I literally couldn't finish the show... I am generally interested in food, and I don't really have a specific complaint, but the show was just about 1/100th as interesting as they probably could have made it.  Overall, don't expect to take away much information.",1393891200,,319,5.018867924528302
8445438,5,B004WO9ONO,Well done! Very thorough and just hope they will cover more food and beverage as they develop the series further.,1393545600,,113,4.7
8445439,3,B004WO9ONO,This series are educational & fun to watch but what I disliked the most is the way most of the things are dramatically overemphasized. Sometimes the narration of certain stuff are presented as if it is sort of 'catastrophe'. Most viewers may not like such ways of presentation especially if they already know the topics other than that minor quibble this series is definitely worth watching.,1392508800,,391,4.9393939393939394
8445440,4,B004WO9ONO,Very interesting and relevant.  I am a huge fan of documentaries. This one gives great insight without being so technical that I got lost.,1392163200,,138,4.75
