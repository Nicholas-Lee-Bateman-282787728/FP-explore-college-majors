905705,1,6304660677,"No money, no money, no money! Blaxploitation at its lowest ebb. Production values are so bad that no one could afford lighting, retakes and (with the exception of Tony Burton from ""Rocky"") genuine actors. Highly recommended as a valuable teaching tool for Filmmaking 101 students.",1420761600,,280,5.2444444444444445

905708,3,6304660677,"Great addition to my collection, this genre of blaxploitation was a mainstay in the 70s. Others consider this type of film degrading, but I consider it the origins of a film noir that got a bad rap, but entertained a generation.",1370044800,6,228,4.585365853658536

Overall it just didn't do it for me.  But once again, if you are a collector i suggest you purchase it, Otherwise sit back and read a book.",1002844800,8,291,3.9655172413793105
905713,5,6304660677,"Leroy Jackson is one bad moutha!!!  He's wanted by the Mafia, the FBI, drug dealers, and many others!!!
Leroy Jackson was one of the first black toughguy characters.  Leroy does things his own way.  It's his way or the highway.
He's also loved by the ladies.  He has a way with street hookers.  They don't even make him pay!!!
Anyway, the script is great and the acting is top-notch.  Everyone's trying to keep Leroy down, but he refuses to stay down.  My favorite scene is where Leroy is jaywalking and a driver honks at him to get out of the way.  An incensed Leroy yells ""Kiss my black ***!""  Where did the writers come up with such dialogue?!!
Buy the Black Godfather.  It's a classic!",991872000,20,689,4.44
