8461385,3,B0058D5AJU,"These videos are marvellous for alleviating the boredom of indoor cycling. Whereas I could barely endure 10 minutes previously 50 minutes passes easily with the addition of beautiful scenery "" other riders"" and the incentive and challenge of making it to the top. However this DVD falls into the same trap of all games and electronic toys -  as regards the accompanying dialogue, stills ,introductions of the people in the film etc. and that is that once you have seen it once it becomes unbearably boring to see the same shots , hear the same conversation over and over. This is not natural and is equivalent to walking into a cafe and your friends say / do the same things in the same order every single time. Therefore you can really only watch it through once and then need to skip everything but the actual climb with just the music . Also because of the angle from which it is shot often gives the illusion you are going downhill when it is actually a very steep climb. Overall I would rather have a video with just the ride ,no talking , still shots -  nothing and I'm sure if they tried they could allow for a choice of soundtracks because that gets a bit samey too.",1522540800,,1174,4.430555555555555
8461386,5,B0058D5AJU,"I have many of titles by Global Rides. Of the many cycling videos series in my library, Global Rides seems to do it best. The group theme and great venues work. I've stayed away from climbing titles fearing long, low gear workouts.  I was pleasantly surprised by this title. The ride up Col de Columbiere was a great workout and the calories burned substantiate it. The view combined with the coaching kept me working hard right to the summit. The Tour de France messages on the road was really neat.....felt like throwing the water bottle over the cliff...I'm now looking at the other climbing titles by Global Rides.",1485043200,,618,4.722222222222222

8461388,5,B0058D5AJU,"Maybe my favourite of the France set, a great ride with challenges to test your tenacity.  I think the music is great and can't understand the negative comments elsewhere.  The videography is really good, you are so there, so absorbed in the surroundings which is great when there's snow on the ground outside.
The coaching choices are useful and provide you with more ways to ride the same road.  I work so hard with this DVD and the time just flies by.  I've ridden a lot in France and look forward to taking the bikes to this area at our next opportunity.
I tried this DVD out with my indoor cycling class and everyone just loved it, and when we got to the top and were cooling down, one member asked if we could do it again on her birthday - twice!!!!
Just brilliant! I look forward to trying out the Italy series which sit beside me as I write.
Good work Global Rides!
Thank you",1360627200,2,883,4.301204819277109
8461389,5,B0058D5AJU,"I own the Maui box set and recently rode TDF Climbing at a friend's house.  I feel this is an even tougher (better) workout than the Hawaii series that will surely keep your climbing legs in shape in the offseason.  Once again Global Ride delivers!  Multiple coaching options, excellent music and a bonus strength workout to finish it off.",1356480000,,339,4.711864406779661
8461390,5,B0058D5AJU,"I am a huge fan of Global Ride productions. I only use virtual cycling dvds, not being able to ride outside. This DVD has some serious climbing in it. Get ready to make those legs burn. Tom and Gene act as coaches for the riders in the video on one segment, while Fiona Ford provides the commentary as coach number 2. The commentary is so helpful in helping you know what to do and how to do it. The music is excellent and very motivating. I highly recommend any Global Ride production, and they just keep getting better. Next stop, Spain!",1356048000,,539,4.346534653465347
8461391,5,B0058D5AJU,"I have watched a number of the Global Ride Series - Hawaii and Italy and when I heard a climbing in France was coming out I was excited to see. I was not disappointed.

These guys just keep getting better with their DVDs. I loved the options of coaching, music and the new addition of commentary - what to focus on and how to improve. It is definitely a nice way of cycling. And not to forget the scenery - short of going to France for 3 sessions a week this is the next best thing. I loved the climbs and it always brings back visions of the Tour de France.

Overall a great DVD and I would recommend it.",1349049600,,605,4.033333333333333
8461392,1,B0058D5AJU,"I read about this DVD on Active.com.  I have used Cycling training DVDs from Chris Carmichael (CTS) in the past including Time Trial, Climbing & Race Simulation.  All were very good.  This Tour de France DVD was supposed to be a simulation of a TdF climb and the music was supposed to be excellent since the company that produced the DVD had special music contracts due to other parts of their business.  This DVD was a huge let down - the scenery is great but that was it.  There was no coaching - just two guys yammering on and on the entire time.  They were supposedly riding but there is no way they could talk the whole time and be climbing a Col and not out of breath.  The music was the least impressive of all.  Don't waste your money on this!!",1331337600,,752,4.246478873239437
