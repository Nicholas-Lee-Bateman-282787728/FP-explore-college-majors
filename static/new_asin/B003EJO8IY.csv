4114122,4,B003EJO8IY,"All three features are pretty good. They're accurately depicted, well-acted, and contain good footage. (I'm a stickler for accuracy of facts.) There is some graphic content, so this isn't something for children. If you're a true crime buff, or someone who's not squeamish, you'll be fascinated; I was, even though I already knew a great deal about all three cases. I'm extremely critical of films and books in the true crime genre, so it's very difficult to please me. All in all, not bad, not bad at all.",1334016000,,505,4.75
4114123,4,B003EJO8IY,"ECHO BRIDGE (aka Platinum Disc) really did this Triple Play DVD flipdisc justice. There's no on-screen watermarks and the dubs are very good. The first two here are well worth the price of admission.

SIX DEGREES OF HELTER SKELTER is a 90 minute documentary that takes us to the actual California crime scenes of the Charles Manson family, to the Spahn Ranch where Charlie was captured, plus many other locations. It includes autopsy reports and some rather bloody victim photos. Events unrelated to the Tate/LaBianca killings are covered, like Manson's hooking up with Dennis Wilson and a murder he may have committed himself. We also hear a recording of a Manson song.

Hollywood historian and host/narrator Scott Michaels seems nervous at the outset (his commentary is delivered a bit too fast) but he soon settles into a good pace as we explore material and events he's very familiar with. ""Six Degrees"" is an excellent show and I highly recommend it!

THE TED BUNDY STORY is based on crime author Ann Rule's breakthrough book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-STRANGER-BESIDE-ME/dp/1416559590/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE STRANGER BESIDE ME</a>. Rule and Bundy met and were co-workers at a Seattle Crisis Hotline. At the time he was already deep into a killing spree that may have amounted to either 36 or 136 victims. (When Bundy's Death Row appeals ran out he tried to bargain for time by offering to reveal the locations of bodies, but he was electrocuted as scheduled.)

According to this TV film's epilogue, the term ""serial killer"" was created to describe Ted Bundy.

THE BONEYARD is an episode of ""The Prosecutors, a TV documentary series with an unseen narrator who recounts California's Lake and Ng case. When Leonard Lake was apprehended after Charles Ng's shoplifting attempt was thwarted, he swallowed a cyanide capsule and died while in police custody.

Ng was a fugitive for a few years and after his arrest in Canada he used the legal system to delay U.S. extradition and the beginning of his trial for 12 murders. Prosecutors were eventually able to get a conviction on circumstantial evidence alone plus Ng's own ill-advised testimony.",1293667200,7,2205,5.285714285714286
4114124,4,B003EJO8IY,"For the reviewer who wrote ""Two Out of Three Ain't Bad"", indicating that the Ted Bundy ""The Stranger Beside Me"" was not on the disc, I, too, bought this disc at Wal*Mart for $5.00. It is a dual-sided disc and the Ted Bundy story is on the second side.  The quality of this story and the 2 other movies/documentaries are excellent and you can't beat the price.",1288224000,5,359,4.358208955223881
4114125,2,B003EJO8IY,"I purchased this DVD at Wal-Mart for $5 dollars -- not a bad price for 3 movies.

However, to clarify, THE TED BUNDY STORY is the only ""movie"" in the set. The other features are a 2-hour documentary on the Manson Family murders (VERY detailed and very entertaining), as well as a 2-hour segment of the A&E series, THE PROSECUTERS titled ""The Boneyard,"" which was nothing more than re-enactments of the actual case. I found this 3rd feature to be the least entertaining and most cumbersome to watch.

But overall, not bad for a $5 price tag.",1286668800,9,540,4.556701030927835
8395534,3,B003EJO8IY,"There are three films on here in chronicling horror and crimes of Charles Manson and his family in ""The Six Degrees of Helter Skelter;"" ""The Boneyard"" is about Leonard Lake/Charles Ng's crimes in Wilseyville, California; and the television movie, ""The Stranger Beside Me"" about Ted Bundy.

The first documentary is entitled ""Six Degrees of Helter Skelter"" concentrates more on the locations with regards and connections to Charles Manson and his family's crimes in August 1969. The narrator, Scott Michaels (founded findadeath.com), travels around Southern California especially in Los Angeles and in Death Valley. By seeing the locations today, I appreciate the documentary's effort in being different. There are no celebrity interviews. Dr. Ron Hale bought Jay Sebring's home in Los Angeles, California after he was murdered on Cielo Drive.

The second documentary is an episode ""The Boneyard"" from ""The Prosecutors"" series on television. There is a mixture of re-enactments, interviews and file footage with Charles Ng. The case of Leonard Lake and Charles Ng's crimes were unbelievably cruel, sadistic and merciless.

The final film on the flip side is entitled ""Ann Rule's The Stranger Beside Me,"" With Barbara Hersey (Ann Rule) who played the crime writer who befriended Ted Bundy in the early seventies. Ted and Ann were on the same suicide hotline number in Seattle, Washington. The film is decent account of the book. Ann reluctantly writes a book about her friendship with Ted Bundy and researching his history. Billy Campbell did a fine job as Ted Bundy.

The three films including two documentaries cover some of the most harrowing crimes in American history.  If you enjoyed reading about true crimes, this DVD is fine and adequate.",1488067200,,1745,5.262589928057554
