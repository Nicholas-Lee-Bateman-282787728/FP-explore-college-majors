8323801,3,B00005U12C,I hate to give this DVD one star.  I reviewed Saga 1 and unfortunately the same flaw is in Saga 2.  On disc number two of both Saga 1 & 2 the audio skips in and out on the English Dubbed track.  The issue has not been resolved.  I have made phone calls and sent emails to the company concerning these flaws.  I have recieved no response.  I would hesitate to recommend the third Saga. I loved this series and it deserves a better rating.  It is easy for me to forgive the flaw.  I prefer the Japanese dialouge anyway.  For those of you who like your anime in English beware!  (see review for  Zenki-Saga 1 DVD),1040428800,3,610,4.128205128205129
