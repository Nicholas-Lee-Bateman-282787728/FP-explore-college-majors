7904630,4,B000006QJ0,"At last! A presentation on Nero which shows his better side as well as the atrocities. Nero wasn't a good boy for most of his life, but he wasn't all bad or always bad, and this video includes his early career and better efforts. Using actual busts and statues shows that he wasn't the grossly fat, slavering monster so often depicted. This video also reminds us that while he certainly used the real estate made available by the Great Fire of July 64, he didn't start it as so much propaganda has claimed. Thanks to A and E for presenting a balanced view.",996019200,,556,4.407766990291262
