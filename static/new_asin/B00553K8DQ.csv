4571249,4,B00553K8DQ,"""The Breaking Point"" is a 1950 black and white Warner Brothers crime drama, the second film adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's 1937 novel ""To have and Have Not"". The 1944 version starred Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall and was directed by Howard Hawks. A third adaptation, ""The Gun Runners"", was made in 1958 by Don Siegel. The 1950 version is closer to the novel, though there are some notable differences.

FWIW - the novel takes place in Florida/Cuba, in the Depression, and the captain isn't married. This film takes place in California/Mexico, in the 50s, and the captain is married with children. The Bogart film took place in Martinique, France during World War 2.

The film stars ruggedly handsome John Garfield (1913-52) as the boat captain with financial troubles. The original ""method"" actor. Garfield made his screen debut in 1938 with the popular ""Four Daughters"" (directed by Michael Curtiz) for which he received his first Best Supporting Actor nomination (he got his second in 1947 for ""Body and Soul""), and ""They Made me a Criminal"" (1939) propelled him into the A list. He's best known for ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946). Blacklisted in the communist scare of the late 40s, his career was cut short, and he died in 1952 at age 39. He made only one film after this one.

Patricia Neal (1926-2010) plays the wise cracking companion of one of Garfield's clients. Neal won the Oscar for ""Hud"" (1963) and was nominated for ""The Subject was Roses"" (1968). She won two BAFTAs (""Hud"" and ""In Harm's Way"") and was nominated for an Emmy 3 times. I liked her best in ""A Face in the Crowd"" (1957) and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951).

Phyllis Thaxter (1921) plays Garfield's wife, a role not in the prior adaptation. Thaxter made more than 20 films before turning her attention to TV. Her most famous role was probably as Martha Kent in 1978s ""Superman"". She was an excellent actress and never better than in this film. Watch for an amazing sequence in which she transform herself into a Patricia Neal clone.

Chubby Wallace Ford (1898-1966) plays a shady lawyer. Ford appeared in over 100 films from 1930 to 1965, often as a comic foil. He did 5 films for John Ford including ""They Were Expendable"" (1945) and ""The Last Hurrah"" (1958). He was nominated for a Golden Laurel in 1965 for ""A Patch of Blue"", his last film.

Juano Hernandez (1896-1970) plays Garfield's partner (played by Walter Brennan in the 44 film). His film debut in ""Intruder in the Dust"" (1949) earned him a Golden Globe nomination. I liked him best in ""Young Man with a Horn"" (1950).

Look for Sherry Jackson (1942) as one of Garfield's daughters. Jackson went on to fame on TV's ""The Danny Thomas Show"" (1953-58).

William Campbell (1923-2011) plays a psycho gang member in his film debut. He made dozens of films but is probably best remembered for his many ""Star Trek"" appearances. And in an uncredited small part look for gang member John Doucette (1921-94)

The film's director Michael Curtiz (1886-1962) is best known for his 7 films with Errol Flynn. He was nominated for an Oscar for their first collaboration (""Captain Blood"", 1935), and received 2 more nominations for films with Jimmy Cagney - ""Angels with Dirty Faces""(1938) and ""Yankee Doddle Dandy"" (1941) - and one win for a film with Bogart (""Casablanca"", 1942), one of eight they made together. Curtiz had a sense of humor about himself - he once declared ""The next time I want an idiot to do this, I'll do it myself.""

1950 was a good year for films with Oscars for ""All About Eve"" (Picture, Director, Supporting Actor), ""Cyrano"" (Actor) and ""Born yesterday"" (Actress).  The top grossers included ""Cinderella"", ""King Solomon's Mines"", ""Annie Get Your Gun"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"". Other notable films released in 1950 were -  ""The Asphalt Jungle"", ""Cheaper by the Dozen"", ""The Glass Menagerie"", ""Rashomon"", ""The Third Man"", and ""Twelve O'Clock High"".

The NY Times said ""All of the character, color and cynicism of Mr. Hemingway's lean and hungry tale are wrapped up in this realistic picture, and John Garfield is tops in the principal role"".

The film is difficult to categorize. It is film noir in terms of the theme (a basically good guy gets caught up in a chain of events that quickly go south as a result of one bad decision) but the major film noir conventions (big city, cop/detective, night, rain) are absent. Garfield, of course, was comfortable with film noir as was Curtiz.

Bottom line - a good film noir and some excellent acting",1331337600,15,4504,4.808538163001294
4571250,5,B00553K8DQ,"This is a superb adaptation of Hemingway's To Have and Have Not.  John Garfield is fantastic as the dark, brooding Harry Morgan.  I saw this movie for the first time recently on TCM and had to buy it.  This is an underrated Garfield movie - he was such a great actor!",1318032000,12,267,4.196078431372549
4571251,4,B00553K8DQ,"This is a remake of TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT that supposedly from what I've read sticks closer to the Hemingway story. That movie was all about Bogart & Bacall. This is about something different. Garfield could play the strong but tormented guy like nobody's business, here we have most of the information needed in understanding just what's eating at this guy, wearing him down and making him afraid. ""A man alone hasn't got a chance,"" he keeps repeating. But Harry isn't alone. He's got a family that loves him, a plain but good woman he adores, and who adores him. A best friend who is his shipping mate, yet he still can't shake the feeling that somehow the universe is against him, working overtime. He's like a man in need of some spiritual guidance. Something is missing. On first viewing this plays like a well done yarn. On subsequent viewings however, this film begins to haunt. The characters and scenes play on a deeper, more meaningful level. The domestic scenes, usually the throwaway, boring parts of a story like this, become the rock and Garfield and Phylis Thaxter emit genuine emotion and affection for one another that is unusually realistic. Patricia Neal is the temptress here, and in an unusual move, we're not supposed to fall in love with her or maybe even like her, which is evident in how she's physically presented. Her haircut is ugly and she's basically unflatteringly lit and photographed. She too looks realistic: like a once beautiful creature who's been around the block too many times and is starting to look all used up.

Juano Hernandez rounds out the main players as Garfield's friend and shipmate. It was Garfield who insisted the character be a black man and had the relationship between the two beefed up. According to Garfield's daughter, the studio didn't like the idea and tried to talk him out of it, eventually giving up. This casting led to someone (director Michael Curtiz?)coming up with that final shot in the film that hits like a sucker punch to the gut, unexpected and unforgettable.

Watch this one a second time and see if you agree.",1311552000,40,2084,4.754143646408839

4571254,4,B00553K8DQ,"The Breaking Point,"" directed by Michael Curtiz,  is a thriller based on Ernest Hemingways To Have and Have Not. John Garfield stars as Harry Morgan, the honest charter-boat captain of the Sea Queen, who, facing tough times, takes on dangerous cargo to save his boat, support his family, and preserve his dignity. Along with best friend and first mate Wesley Park (Juano Hernandez), he takes a wealthy man named Hannagan (Ralph Dumke) and his sexy girl Lenora (Patricia Neal) on a week-long charter fishing cruise to Mexico. But in a small port town, Hannagan skips town by plane, leaving Lenora stranded behind.

With no money to buy fuel to get home, Harry takes the offer of a corrupt lawyer (Wallace Ford) to help his client smuggle eight Chinese illegals into the United States for $1,600. The desperate captain accepts the offer, even though if hes caught, it could mean a ten-year jail sentence. Once again, Harry is double crossed and must force his passengers to jump ship when the Coast Guard suddenly appears. As Harry makes a series of moral compromises, he endangers not only himself and a group of innocent individuals, but his marriage as well.

The more famous adaptation of the Hemingway story is 1944s To Have and Have Not, starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. The Breaking Point, made six years later, lacks the A-picture gloss, leaning more into film noir as it deals with a cast of characters trying to make the best of bad situations. Garfield was at the height of his popularity when he made the film and, even though studio heads weren't thrilled with his vocal left-leaning politics, he kept getting good roles. Juan Hernandez has a substantial role and plays it seriously, unlike Walter Brennan, who took on the part in the 44 version and served as comic relief. Hernandez gives the role and, by extension, the film itself a sense of quiet dignity.

Warner Brothers originally intended to give the film a big promotional push, but backed out when Garfields name turned up in Red Channels, a publication listing  often inaccurately  film personnel associated with communism. Though the film received good reviews, it quickly disappeared and Garfields contract for a second Warners picture was canceled by studio head Jack Warner. This is ironic, because Garfield became a star at Warners in 1938 after the release of Four Daughters, for which he received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.

Special features on the unrated Blu-ray release include a new interview with critic Alan K. Rode; actor and acting instructor Julie Garfield discussing her father, John Garfield; new video essay analyzing director Michael Curtizs methods; excerpts from a 1962 episode of Today showing contents of the Ernest Hemingway House in Key West, Florida; trailer; and a critical essay.",1502323200,5,2806,5.021505376344086

4571256,4,B00553K8DQ,"Not a great story. It rambles from the smuggling of Chinese illegals, through the risk of marital infidelity, to a heist from a racetrack by mobsters. The only connection is Garfield's struggle to keep his life together. His conviction that he's alone isn't about love. He's got a wife and two kids that are crazy about him. He could make a living in Salinas if he would only get practical, as his wife keeps reminding him. And if he wanted Patricia Neal, he could have her too. But he's miserable. He can't make a living as a boat captain without breaking the law, and he can't get his rocks off with Patricia without trashing his marriage. So he feels alone. A weak premise for a story. But there is magic in the film because of Garfield's burning and angst. Somehow he makes the film hang together on the basis of his alienation and his anger at life.",1468368000,3,854,4.445859872611465

4571260,5,B00553K8DQ,"As much as I love Howard Hawks and everything he did, you can't help but see how his penchant for comedy removed the real passion and heart of Hemingway's story when he made To Have and Have Not.

4571263,4,B00553K8DQ,"""The Breaking Point"" is a more faithful adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's novel, ""To Have and Have Not"", which is more familiar and renown due to the pairing of Bogart and Becall. Hemingway, himself, preferred the 1950 John Garfield film which was directed by Michael Curtiz. Garfield plays Harry Morgan who is a charter-boat skipper running off of the California coast. He was somewhat of a war hero but is now struggling to support his wife and 2 young daughters. Both the fishing business as well as his charter-boat are at an all-time low. Subsequently, he is forced to make some bad decisions to try to make some money to keep up with the payments on his boat. He is led astray by a slimy,unscrupulous lawyer Duncan, played by Wallace Ford. 1st, he attempts to smuggle some Chinese illegals into the U.S. and is caught by The Coast Guard, who then impound his boat. Sinking deeper into debt,Harry is then blackmailed by Duncan into chartering a group of thieves to deliver stolen racetrack receipts to an off-shore island. As one can imagine, with Harry's luck, this results in even worse situations. I don't want to be a spoiler, so I will leave the rest of the plot for you to savor. This film was Garfield's baby, and he is excellent in portraying the archetypical defeated noir figure. His vulnerability and capacity for suffering add to the quality of his portrayal. There is pervasive feeling of hopelessness and doom that increases as the film moves forward to it's conclusion. Along with the excellent performance by Garfield, sifnificant supporting roles are given by Juano Hernandez as his first mate, Phyllis Thaxter as his wife, Patricia Neal as his temptress, and Wallace Ford as the aforementioned crooked lawyer Duncan. The script by Ranald MacDougall, captures the prevalent feeling of doom, especially with lines like ""No sooner I get my head above water when somebody pushes me down again"", as voiced by Garfield. I first viewed this fine noir on TCM last year when it was hosted by Robert Osborne and was pleasantly surprised at how good the film is. At that time, it was not available on dvd. I was delighted to discover that it has since been included in the Warner Brothers Archive Collection. Since then, I have also discovered that Patricia Neal told Garfield's real life daughter Julie, that Hemingway, himself, considered the ""The Breaking Point"" to be the only film adaptation of his work that he liked. I also would like to mention that I have now viewed the film 4 times and it seems to only improve with each viewing. Especially significant is the final shot of the film, which I did not fully get on my 1st viewing. It is indeed very powerful. Garfield, who was blacklisted in the late 40's, and would not rat out before HUAC, sadly would be dead due to a chronically weak heart which could not withstand the pressure, just 2 years later in 1952 at age 39. The dvd tranfer is very good, and is full screen 4x3, 1.33:1. The running time is 97 minutes. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! SMRZ!!",1364947200,15,3013,4.740952380952381

4571268,4,B00553K8DQ,"""The Breaking Point"" is the most faithful cinematic adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's 1937 novel ""To Have and Have Not"". Though it never received as much attention as Howard Hawks' iconic wartime adaptation starring Bogie and Bacall, that film's considerable creative license allowed Ranald McDougal to take another crack at a script in 1950 that would reflect Hemingway's Depression era themes. John Garfield's career was waning at this point, and he would die of heart failure only 2 years after filming was completed on ""The Breaking Point"", but this was Garfield's baby and, according to his daughter, the film of which he was the most proud. Garfield was a de facto producer, who got his choice of director Michael Curtiz, cast, and input on the script.

Harry Morgan (John Garfield) captains a small fishing boat charter out of Newport, California, where he lives with wife Lucy (Phyllis Thaxter) and their two young daughters. But the fishing has not been great, nor the customers plentiful, so Harry continually struggles to pay the loan on his boat and support his family. A charter for a man named Hannagan (Ralph Dumke) and his comely companion Leona Charles (Patricia Neal), who want to go fishing in Mexico, promises to pay well. But Hannagan's weaknesses for liquor and gambling get the better of him. He strands Harry, first mate Wesley (Juano Hernandez), and Leona in Mexico. A sleazy lawyer (Wallace Ford) who handles quickie Mexican divorces and worse, tempts Harry with a job for big money and big risk.

John Garfield's tough-talking, unsentimental masculinity, his way of embodying ordinariness to the point of archetype, his soft spot for injustice and self-consciousness of his characters' faults, make him perfect for this role. It's easy to see why John Garfield was attracted to Harry Morgan. ""The Breaking Point"" is a solid thriller about a man battered by life's hardships who doesn't always do the right thing about it, though he certainly considers it. The film was all but forgotten for 60 years, because Warner Brothers chose not to promote it in 1950, allegedly because the studio became skittish when Garfield became the subject of HUAC inquiries. It fell unjustly into obscurity, which may have inspired some critics to overcompensate in the present.

Patricia Neal plays a wonderful bad girl in smooth, flirtatious Leona. I wish she had more to do. Wallace Ford is terrific as the sleazebag lawyer. You wonder how Duncan lived long enough to pester Harry. Phyllis Thaxter has been praised for her role as the strong, understanding wife, but I found her unaffecting. She simply emotes and throws her voice a few octaves higher when distressed or excited. She squeaks and overacts. Regardless, ""The Breaking Point"" struck me strongly as a film of the 1930s, not the 1940s or 1950s. ""The Breaking Point"" is being labeled ""film noir"" these days, but it is closer to proto-noir. It resembles the films of the 1930s in which a man is battered, not by an existential crisis over something he can't grasp, but by economic hardship or judicial injustice.

I felt that I was watching a 1930s film. Harry, Wesley, Lucy all give that impression. Leona does not necessarily, but her character is not in the book. It makes me wonder if audiences in 1950 had that feeling too. This is clearly Depression-era material. Ranald McDougal chose to remain faithful to Hemingway's Marxist undertones in an era when Freud was popular at the cinema, not Marx. Harry Morgan is a very good role for John Garfield, but I think it was always a film out of time. I'd call it proto-noir-after-the-fact crossed with romantic melodrama. Like the film for which Garfield is most famous, ""Body and Soul"" (1947), the actor was inspired by the world of his youth. In that case, he wanted to make a film about a Jewish boxing champion, inspired by Barney Ross.",1351036800,2,3858,4.949074074074074
4571269,4,B00553K8DQ,"Word on the street is that director Howard Hawks once made a bet with author Ernest Hemingway that he could make a good movie out of his worst novel... and that's how we got the all-time 1944 classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Have-and-Have-Not/dp/B000FFJYAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Have and Have Not</a>, which starred Bogie and Bacall. Except that the narrative onscreen severely departs from its source material. 1950's THE BREAKING POINT, the second of three films to adapt Hemingway's story, is the most faithful. It features a riveting performance by John Garfield in his penultimate film. But, in fact, the entire cast is rock solid.

Once upon a time, war hero Harry Morgan (Garfield) had the world in the palm of his hands. But that was a while ago. Nowadays, Harry Morgan is feeling the pinch of a bleak post-war era. He's hard-pressed to provide for his wife and two daughters. His creditors constantly nip at his heels. Life hadn't gone the way he'd thought. A struggling charter boat operator, Morgan finds himself stranded in Mexico when his client skips out on him without paying. An honorable man, he reluctantly takes on a smuggling job, and that was never going to end well.

This film falls somewhere on that list of overlooked but very good cinema. It's a gripping character study, enriched by pitch perfect performances and honest dialogue. It doles out human drama and psychological suspense. It's sort of not fair that John Garfield isn't as well remembered today - at least not in my neighborhood. Garfield, with his spare acting style and intensity and raw magnetism, established the blueprint for ensuing generations of method brooders like Brando and James Dean. He is mesmerizing and haunting as our conflicted protagonist, desperately broke and maybe feeling emasculated and not taking it too well. Harry Morgan loves his patient wife (Phyllis Thaxter, a June Allyson look-alike) and his adorable two kids. But he's drawn to Patricia Neal's marvelously slinky femme fatale, and, oboy, their scenes sizzle.

All manner of wicked temptation trap our guy in a corner. Money woes lure him once more into shady operations. In the end Harry Morgan is forced to settle accounts by way of a violent shootout on the high seas. It's a climactic sequence that's very reminiscent of KEY LARGO's third act. That's ironic, because KEY LARGO's ending supposedly borrows from this very same Hemingway novel. And maybe as a nod to the first film, Garfield does a fair job of aping Bogey's patented lip clench.

Director Michael Curtiz, as usual, is a pro's pro, occasionally veering away from those moments of everyday living to track Morgan's reluctant dallying in the underbelly. THE BREAKING POINT is ahead of its time in its honest depiction of minorities as intelligent, industrious people. It would've been so very easy to throw in a stereotype or two and, by so doing, cheapen the film's intent. Juano Hernandez exudes steadfast nobility as Morgan's first mate, and you can't tell me you didn't feel that twinge of heartbreak with how the film closes out with that final scene. At the opposite end of the spectrum, one has to credit Wallace Ford for his effectiveness as Duncan, the despicable, slimy middleman who negotiates Morgan's contracts with various underworld figures. Yeah, man, I cheered when he got what was comin' to him.

There's a third film which adapts the Hemingway story. Don Siegel directed - and Audie Murphy starred in -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gun-Runners/dp/B004ULEEZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gun Runners</a>&nbsp;in 1958.

4571270,5,B00553K8DQ,"This film is a corker. It has no reputation, as compared with Michael Curtiz's 'Casablanca', but it is right up there with it - and in some ways has stronger credentials. The character played by John Garfield is one in a long line of basically-decent but desperate risk-takers who peopled Hollywood films from the 1930s to the 1950s. Usually we can take them or leave them. But Garfield really gets us on his side - not by being particularly nice or smart, but because he so skilfully conveys the ex-GI character's craving for independence and self-respect, while retaining enough moral sense to want to find a better way out of his troubles than through the sewer. The story builds through several crescendos to a powerful climax, in which Curtiz's own moral sense leaves the viewer with a last, haunting image of loss and abandonment. Phyllis Thaxter is great as the long-suffering wife - who thankfully is not self-pitying - and Patricia Neal gives us an interesting femme fatale, though her place in the story is fairly marginal. I feel this version of Hemingway's story is superior to Bogart's 'To Have and Have Not', which is a good film, but lacks some of the complexities and ironies of 'The Breaking Point'. The location shooting provides a rich canvas for the play; the camerawork and editing are first class; and the supporting cast deliver in spades.",1337299200,15,1362,4.8247863247863245

I have not read To Have and Have Not by Hemingway, but I have seen the Howard Hawks version with screenplay by Faulkner and the two versions are very different................the Curtiz movie is set in post war Socal while the Hawks film is set in Martinique in WWII...the Hawks movie is basically Casablanca remade while the Curtiz film is so hard boiled, so gritty, so humanistic, and so realistic it is hard to believe these films came from the same source matierial.  Garfield gives the best performance I have ever seen by him....his anguish is so haunting it really troubled me.

Much of The Breaking Point was shot on location in sun light.....yet, the feeling of doom and dread prevails without the iconic film noir tropes of well defined shadows and pin point lighting. Of the many great things about this movie, the photography was the most impressive to me.  The entire cast is on point, and at home scenes with Garfield and his family are even more important than the more melodramatic scenes..... also a departure from more typical film noir.  Patricia Neal plays what you think will be a femme fatale, but her character arc is somewhat different.  She is magnificent in the role...............this performance is equal to those in A Face in the Crowd and The Day The Earth Stood Still.

I might be overstating it, but this may be equal to or better than the Curtiz noir masterpiece Mildred Pierce.....this is a must watch for fans of film noir.",1334016000,5,1487,4.74031007751938
