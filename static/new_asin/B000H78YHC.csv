Very memorable debut of Amanda Redman (""New Tricks."") Based on the novel by Frederic Raphael who wrote ""The Glittering Prizes"" and the screenplays for ""Two for the Road"" and ""Darling"" among others.",1439251200,,343,5.142857142857143
8137298,3,B000H78YHC,"After her husband Richard (Mark Eden) dies suddenly from a heart attack, his wife (Liv Ullmann) discovers he was having an affair. She confronts his mistress (Amanda Redman) but after the initial hurt and anger, they slowly form an attachment to each other as a way of keeping Richard alive. The film would seem to have everything going for it: one of the world's greatest actresses in Ullmann, directed by an award winning director Anthony Harvey (THE LION IN WINTER), shot by a master cinematographer Freddie Young (LAWRENCE OF ARABIA), a screenplay by an Oscar winning screenwriter Frederic Raphael (DARLING), a score by the great Georges Delerue (JULES AND JIM). So what went wrong? The film seems to think it's more profound than its mediocrity reveals. The film is past the halfway mark before it gets remotely interesting but by then its squandered whatever good will it might have built up. The rather trite dialogue defeats the great Ullmann but positively demolishes poor Redman who can do no better than a one dimensional performance. To the film's credit, its depiction of a Lesbian relationship between the wife and the mistress is treated without sensation and rather affectionately. Still, for all the talent involved, shouldn't we get more than just another love story? With Tim Pigott-Smith, Elizabeth Spriggs, David Markham and Ian McDiarmid.

The region 2 DVD from Simply Media is an adequate anamorphic wide screen (about 1.78) transfer.",1389744000,,1457,5.121848739495798
8137299,4,B000H78YHC,"Finally saw this rather obscure film and I found it quite good. Although it's no classic, it's a nice drama to lose yourself in. Liv Ullmann is fantastic and ravishingly beautiful as an insecure widower taking a liking to her late husbands mistress played with excellence by Amanda Redman. Well directed by ""The Lion in Winter's"" Anthony Harvey, excellently photographed by veteran cinematographer Freddie Young and containing and excellent score by Georges Delerue, there is a lot to love about this film. Liv Ullmann fans as well as just plain movie buffs should see this.",1373068800,,574,5.052631578947368
