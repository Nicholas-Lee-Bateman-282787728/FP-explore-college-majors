355306,1,6301763424,"Considering the many great films that have not made it on to DVD yet, that this boring and mind melting nonsense has made it is beyond belief.

Winner of the most boring historical ""action-adventure"" film set in Africa  award, with Sharon Stone taking the honors for worst actress is said category.

The Kings Solomons Mines film is actually pretty good, the equal to the Indiana Jones films.

Since I love the genre, and since I liked the first film, this may be most horrific sequel I have ever had the painful displeasure to witness.",1137110400,5,536,4.670212765957447
355307,2,6301763424,"The first movie being ofcourse 'King Solomon's Mines' (released two years before this one in 1985 - also starring Richard Chamberlain, Sharon Stone).

'Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold' is rather flat compared to the first one. the problem is that the 'Lost City of Gold' is missing the all around sense of fun that was present before and is simply not as clever in its sense of humor (although in the first half it did have its moments).

The second half of this movie (when they actually get to the 'Lost City of Gold') is simply awful.

And there is a completely cheesy and unnecessary scene in which Allan Quatermain shoots and kills a lion. In the first movie the 'lion scene' is realistic but delightful.

So, if you liked this one (hey, its possible) or if you didn't, try 'King Solomon's Mines'!!

peace out

355308,1,6301763424,"Don't be fool with the nice cover of the movie, this is not Indiana jones or something even near it. It's the wort archeological action movie ever made. It's awful, low budget with terrible actings. it's special features is as poor as the early 20s movies!

and the DVD, it's even worse than the movie. a single layer dvd, the picture quality is awful, not sharp, with very pale colors. it was better if they transfer it in black and white. I Did not watch it till the end cause I love my eyes.",1118534400,6,494,4.25531914893617
355309,3,6301763424,"Lost City of Gold starts out as a fun adventure just like the previous Quatermain movie King's Solomons Mines. It stays that way for a fun journey to the lost city but once they get there it becomes a Clift's Notes version of Haggard's novel without very much of the silly fun as the first film or the first half of this one. They should have taken longer to get to the lost city I guess. It's still worth seeing though and fans of King Solomon's Mines will love the first half. Those who haven't seen the first film will probably enjoy it since they won't compare it to the superior previous movie. Chamberlain, Stone, and Jones are all in good form and are extremely fun to watch in the first half of the film. After that they do their best but the lost city isn't much fun to hang around once it's been found. 3 and half stars for the good stuff.",1097107200,3,849,4.214723926380368
355310,3,6301763424,"This movie really only suffers in comparison to its entertaining and fun-loving predecessor KING SOLOMON'S MINES. Filmed back-to-back to save money on what the now defunct Cannon Company obviously thought would be a highly successful franchise. Whereas the first film features an incredible cast including the always amazing John Rhys-Davies and Herbert Lom and a fun, fast paced and amusing series of adventures, this follow-up can only offer us James Earl Jones as a major addition to series regulars Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone. In fact Jones steals every scene he appears in, wielding an axe with impressive power.

In this adventure, Allan Quaterman (Chamberlain) sets out across the jungle, with fiancee Jessie (Stone) in tow, in search of his lost brother who apparently has been successful in his search for the Lost City of Gold of the title.

Where this movie fails is that, in contrast to the first movie, the action sequences are uninspired, the comedy is dull to downright annoying and when Chamberlain and Company reach the city it becomes apparent that the only people in danger (his brother is doing fine thank you very much) is Quatermain and company who are tried for killing a sacred lion outside the city gates.

There is some attempt at an action filled climax as they face off with the dastardly wicked High Priest and a band of mercenaries, but it comes too little and too late to save a movie which has already lost its audience during a tired journey to the city.

I really wanted to like this movie. I saw and enjoyed 1985s KING SOLOMONS MINES in the movie theater and for years was curious as to what its sequel had to offer. The answer sadly is - not much. Given its low price completist's might like to pick it up as a companion piece to its superior prequel but for all others this is hard to recommend.",1091145600,5,1842,4.728971962616822
355311,1,6301763424,"I actually enjoyed King Solomon's Mines. Sure it was bad, but the funny sense of humor was a treat and the action was non-stop. The sequel Allan Quartermain and the Lost City of Gold lacks all this. It tries to capture the same humor as the first film but fails. Also the action is rather dull and unspactacular. I believe part of the problem was the low budget. King Solomon's Mines had a way bigger budget so they could afford the fun action scenes. Here there's not much budget to go around so the action was cut short. Overall a dismal sequel that is totally pointless.",1076112000,9,573,4.415094339622642
355312,2,6301763424,"despite what a lot of people may think about the 1985 version of ""king solomon's mines"" starring richard chamberlain and sharon stone, i thought it was a very good, and entertaining movie. definitely one deserving of a sequel.
but folks, let's face it, this is certainly no ""indiana jones and the temple of doom"".  ""Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold"" (and i apologize for listing it as ""allan QUARTERMAIN and the lost city of gold"" in my review of ""king solomon's mines"")is an almost pointless sequel that does not do justice to its predecessor. yes, it does have its good moments but they are few and far between.  the musical score is once again incredible, but not enough to carry the weight of the entire film.
if you are ever able to find a copy of this film, do not purchase it. i wouldn't even suggest renting it. you might sit through it once, though, if it comes on HBO, cinemax, or showtime, but those would be the only channels i would recommend watching it on. any other network would have to stretch the already ridiculous hour and forty minute film out to an absurd two and a half hours.  certainly too much time to spend watching a piece of cinematic rubbish like this.",982972800,2,1193,4.513888888888889

355453,2,6301763424,"I have to admit I expected better, with Chamberlain, Stone, and Jones.  Especially James Earl Jones' character is a disappointment given what a strong actor he is, and already was by then.  It must have pained a guy so smart and able to play such a stack of racist stereotypes as they put on his character.  Sharon Stone was young then and it occurs to me most of the stuff I've liked with her comes later, but she really isn't cut out to be the kind of female character that screams and runs to the arms of the leading man.  Her charcter isn't a complete wallflower in this film, but her later films where she shows more independence and strength are not foreshadowed in this.

The story, meanwhile, just makes no sense on so many levels.  Even with the suspense of disbelief that any movie like this requires (I love the Indiana Jones franchise--well, all but ToD), too many pieces of it don't work as magic or ancient technology or modern stuff looking like magic to the locals.  They just don't work, period.

Some good scenery, as the location shots were done in Zimbabwe which is a beautiful place.  But not quite worth the ridiculous story, I'm afraid.  Even as a lightweight action film for a Saturday, it doesn't cut it.",1458345600,,1229,4.520361990950226

355497,1,6301763424,"Independent Blu-ray Distributor OLIVE FILMS have decided to release this
average 80's Action adventure film on blu-ray for the first time with No new extras obviously
Allan Quatermain & the Lost city of Gold is the sequel to the action adventure classic King solomon's mines
the sequel is tolerable but the original is of course the best
King solomon's mines was Well Directed and well scripted with some Great acting from Richard chamberlain
and some Good acting from Sharon stone
the sequel was not, the script is average and so are the Acting performances in the film
King solomon's mines deserves a blu-ray release not the sequel

anyway Olive films have released the sequel on blu-ray, it's a terrible release in my opinion
the HD transfer in 2:39:1 widescreen is Good but not excellent but slightly better quality than the DVD release
Olive films probably just got the dvd transfer from the MGM dvd release and clean up the quality little bit i think
only little bit thou, they did not make a big effort with the Picture quality
does not say on the back cover what the Audio quality is like so the sound quality will not be 5.1 Master audio mix
more likely be a stereo mix only from the dvd release
and guess what no new extras of course i would've been surprised if there was
it would've been Great if there was new retrospect featurette
 with Director Gary nelson, Actors Richard chamberlain & sharon stone & James earl Jones who is still alive these days
to give an interview
but of course Olive films did not make the effort
some other Olive films blu-ray's are the same, no effort with the HD transfer no effort getting new extras
very very pathetic Olive films blu-ray versions are waste of money as far as i'm concerned
so if you have the dvd release of Allan Quatermain & lost city of Gold, keep it
this blu-ray release is pointless waste of money, Good quality if that HD transfer & no new extras no nothing
maybe 3 stars for the film, 1 star for this new blu-ray version",1427932800,4,1986,4.544692737430168

355552,2,6301763424,"Sometimes Cannon came across like Roger Corman with a slightly bigger budget.  Like Corman, Cannon had no gripes about making low budget ripoffs of big budget blockbusters.  We see that tradition carried on today by The Asylum.
  With Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, Cannon continues the Indiana Jones ripoffage that started with King Solomon's Mines two years prior.  That movie was quite campy, unapologetic and silly, but at least it had it's own bad movie entertainment value.  This sequel(shot at the same time as King Solomon's Mines) doesn't have that.  Sure, it tries here and there, but fails a lot more than it succeeds.
  As the title suggests, Quatermain is now on the search for the Lost City of Gold, not so much for riches, but to find his brother.  Along for the ride is Jesse(now his fiancee), axe wielding warrior Umslopogaas, and sleazy ""holy man"", Swarma.  After one of the shortest desert treks ever filmed, they find city, and Quatermain's brother is alive and well, living there with a group of folks who remind me of the Eloi from the Time Machine.  Naturally, the city is being ruled with an iron(or gold?) fist by an evil priest and his sexy, mute henchwoman(played by Elvira herself!).  Quatermain and friends lead the people in a revolt, and......aw, hell, you know who comes out the winner here.
  This could have been a fun movie, but it's rather boring and kinda painful to watch.  Sharon Stone returns in the hysterical, irritating Kate Capshaw role.  I never understood Hollywood's philosophy on the concept of the female lead that's constantly screaming, freaking out, whining, and dispatching enemies through clumsiness and stupidity.  This stereotypical female character showed up in so many movies in the 80s, and what seemed like every Jackie Chan movie in the 90s.  Was there a poll taken to see if audiences liked this sort of character?  Were the people demanding this kind of character?  Have you ever met one person that likes this sort of character???  But if that weren't bad enough, we now have Robert Donner as Swarma.  Swarma is another type of character nobody likes or asks for in their adventure films, yet we get him all the same.  Swarma is the cowardly weasel character that is supposed to be comic relief, yet instead of making you laugh(or even crack a smile), he makes you wish nothing but a horrible and painful death to remove him from the film.  Again, who asks for this kind of character?  Even after throwing his companions under the bus, he's never given the boot!  Robert Donner has always seemed  to land these kinds of parts.  Hey, it can be done well from time to time.  Look at Joe Pesci's character in the Lethal Weapon films for an example of how it can be done right.
  Then we have Richard Chamberlain returning as Quartermain.  You can't put too much blame on him because here he's basically a decent actor in a not so decent movie.
  Character actor Henry Silva, usually very reliable as a villain, is wasted.  Here he makes for one of the most uninteresting and least threatening villains you'll ever see.  Tis a shame.
  So, in a movie jam packed with unimpressive characters and performances stands the only person with any redeeming value, and that's James Earl Jones as the warrior, Umslopogaas(yes, I had to copy and paste that name because it wasn't worth the time or effort to memorize the spelling).  Umslopogaas(did it again) is the macho, brawny warrior who says little and wields a big axe.  It's a role totally beneath James' talents, and I've heard that Jones isn't exactly proud of having been in the film either.  Be that as it may, he's the most fun to watch, mainly because he's James Earl Jones, and James Earl Jones is just about one of the top ten coolest people on the planet.  James Earl Jones reading the ingredients off of a box of Lucky Charms over the phone would be entertaining-and certainly more entertaining than about 45 minutes of this film.
  Ultimately, this movie tried to capture what little thrill the first film provided and pretty much failed.  Rubber creatures, bad one liners, a lost city, a big battle, jungle hijinx, human sacrifice, a guy named Umslopogaas(had to do it one more time) .... it should have all worked somehow, but it just didn't.  It's schlocky, but just not the right kind of schlock to be entertaining.",1410652800,,4350,4.746328437917223

Competing Films look Like Gems: The movie is most interesting in that it highlights what a brilliant/difficult job was done on the 'I. Jones' films.  This movie even plays the music from this competing line of movies at many (and I add, inappropriate) points in the film.

Plot: The movie just does not make sense.  There is a big lead up to the finding the City of Gold.  (Spoiler Alert Coming...) and when they get there it looks like a smallish set of concrete white buildings, with very little gold anywhere.

Costuming: Sharon Stone wears brown leather pants for days/months hiking around the hot and wet jungle, including going through rivers, bizarre.

355638,2,6301763424,"Richard Chamberlain returns as Allan Quartermain in the sequel to King Solomon's Mine (1985), in Allan Quartermain and the Lost City of Gold (1987).  Sharon Stone also reprises her role as Jesse Huston, who is now Quartermain's fianc.  The couple put their wedding plans on hold, to set off on a mission to locate Quartermain's brother Robeson, who has been lost while bound for the mysterious Lost City of Gold.  Putting together an expedition party that includes Swarma (Robert Donner) a sniveling coward of a guide, and Umslopogaas (James Earl Jones) an axe wielding warrior, and his four followers, Quartermain heads off on his quest, taking with him what will prove to be a most valuable tool, a kind of body armor that provides protection against knives and spears.

After surviving the perils of the Walls of Jalpora, the party sets off down river, only to encounter some very unfriendly natives.  They should be wiped out, but somehow get past them, only to be sucked down into an underground cavern.  After facing some more B-movie hazards, the group emerges and arrives at a walled city, where Robeson Quartermain (Martin Rabbett) is living.  The city is ruled jointly by Queen Nylephta (Aileen Marson) who is fair and kind, and her sister Queen Sorais (Cassandra Peterson, Elvira Mistress of the Dark), who sides with Agon (Henry Silva, with an 80's metal band hairdo), an oppressive high priest,  who has taken control of the city's production of gold.  Agon seeks to punish Quartermain, but is temporarily rebuked when Quartermain's body armor protects him from his spear.

The greedy Swarma. accepts Agon's offer of gold in return for betraying Quartermain.  Things deteriorate quickly after Quartermain destroys the altar of sacrifice, a symbol of Agon's oppression.  Agon leaves the city to gather an army, and mounts an attack on the city.  The battle scenes aren't very convincing, or well done.  Matters go over the top, when Quartermain strikes a huge golden lion that stands at the top of the temple, unleashing some kind of force, that causes the gold to melt, and soak the enemy forces.  It is just complete and awful drivel.

Produced by the Cannon Group, Lost City of Gold, features some exotic locations, large sets, and tons of extras, but still has a B-movie look, with some pretty cheesy special effects, bad acting and terrible dialog.  The spirit of fun and adventure that was present in King Solomon's Mines, is missing, and the script does not provide the opportunity for much chemistry to develop between stars Stone and Chamberlain.  Quartermain's theme music, which pops ups anytime anything even semi exciting happens, gets to be a joke.  Things go into the crapper fast, once the party reaches the Lost City, and the action sequences, and fight scenes are not well done at all.  Unless you really liked the first movie, or are a big fan of the principal stars, you may want to pass on this one.",1262736000,2,2932,4.896761133603239

355640,3,6301763424,"Enjoyable adventure tale, obviously inspired by ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"".  ALLAN QUATERMAIN AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD (1986) was the sequel to 1985's surprise summer hit ""King Solomon's Mines"", again starring Richard Chamberlain as the gun-ho adventurer Quatermain with a fresh, young Sharon Stone as his spunky fiance Jessie.

The story finds Allan on the trail of his missing brother.  Along the way, Quatermain and Jessie stumble across the mythical lost city of Gold, ruled by a power-mad High Priest (a particularly hammy turn from Henry Silva); and two buxom princesses (Aileen Marson and Cassandra ""Elvira"" Peterson).

The special effects have dated horribly and the plot makes NO sense whatsover.  THE LOST CITY OF GOLD won't challenge your mind but it offers a solid 95 minutes of entertainment...remember it?

355643,1,6301763424,"""Half of Africa's been explored on rumor, hope, legend..."" ""And blood"" The same could be said of the film industry. The 'recupero,' as the Italian film industry dubbed it, was one of the most forlornly hopeful forms of film-making: offsetting part of the cost of the film you wanted to make by filming another on the cheap back-to-back with as many of the same cast, crew and locations as possible in the hope that at least one of them would be a hit even though just about the only recorded case of that ever happening was when Il Magnifico Straniero, shot back-to-back with Bullets Don't Argue to 'use up waste materials,' became a surprise hit after changing its title to Fistful of Dollars. Much loved by exploitation merchants, it was no surprise that Cannon films would adopt the practice, especially after their two back-to-back Missing in Action pictures proved surprisingly profitable. Having ripped off Rambo, Indiana Jones seemed the next obvious target, but their back-to-back sequel to 1985's King Solomon's Mines, one of their least unsuccessful films (well, it lost less than most of them), proved a disaster on every conceivable level. While H. Rider Haggard wrote enough unfilmed Allan Quatermain novels to keep a franchise running for a decade, Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold is one of those films that's so bad it's just bad, making you glad they called it a day after this one.

On paper it has everything you need for a somewhat average movie except enthusiasm and belief, as Haggard's Great White Hunter Allan Quatermain (Richard Chamberlain) postpones his wedding to a hyperactive and very loud Sharon Stone to find a lost city of gold in search of his missing brother (Freudians could probably read something into the fact that Quatermain's brother is played by Chamberlain's longtime companion Martin Rabbett), battling hostile tribes, booby traps and the elements en route and braving the most pathetic backprojection seen this side of the original Dr Who in a comically cranked-up log ride through an underground river. All of which happens in the least interesting way possible - this is the kind of film where they don't even try to hide the wires on the stunt performers and where the extras just look bored in the final battle. Even the score is just barely edited musical selections from an uncredited Jerry Goldsmith's score for the previous film (mostly just the crescendos) with the odd synth drumbeat linking them the sole audible contribution from credited composer Michael Linn.

There's not much gold on display in the lost city either, but then Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of White doesn't really have the same ring to it. Not that it's a city: it's obviously a Zimbabwean tourist hunting lodge that bought a job lot of white dressing gowns. You know it's a pretty screwed up place because one of its twin queens is played by Elvira and the evil high priest is Henry Silva in one of Diana Ross's old Afro wigs that's seen much better days (as indeed has he). At times it plays like a Who Can Be the Most Annoying competition, with Razzie-nominated Sharon Stone forfeiting her early lead to James Earl Jones' too-bored-to-bother warrior only for Mork and Mindy regular Robert Donner channelling Spike Milligan and Carry On Up the Khyber's Cardew Robinson at the top of his voice as an 'Indian' holy man to steal the prize. It's a surprise to see that it was shot in post-independence Zimbabwe since it has many of the hallmarks of the kind of film that used to shoot in apartheid South Africa - blacks are expendable children, Indians comic buffoons with silly voices, whites are the master race and everyone would stay happily in their place if it weren't for foreigners stirring up trouble.

Where the first film had the director of The Guns of Navarone and the original Cape Fear, J. Lee Thompson, to keep things professional enough, this has to settle for the director of The Black Hole, Gary Nelson (with 'additional scenes directed by Newt Arnold'), who is singularly unable to motivate his cast and crew. Chamberlain is barely making an effort here and clearly gives up near the end, though it's no surprise in a film that looks like only the rehearsals were shot, and only one take at that. The closest it comes to charm is when the real cold that Stone is obviously suffering in one scene is clearly caught by Chamberlain in the next. The biggest curiosity about the film is that most of the action in the trailer doesn't appear in the film at all despite looking rather less inept that what made the final cut, leaving the feeling of something that's been patched together in post over the weekend on an Ed Wood budget. If you ever wondered why Haggard's other Allan Quatermain novels have never been filmed, this utterly dire and nigh-unwatchable venture provides ample explanation.",1210982400,,4851,4.828125
355644,4,6301763424,"KING SOLOMON'S MINES and ALLAN QUATERMAIN AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD are typically over-shadowed by the bigger budget INDIANA JONES trilogy. There is good reason for that; the IJ movies are the apex of the action movie genre. However, that's not a good reason NOT to watch these two flicks.

The films detail the exploits of a hero named Allan Quatermain (Richard Chamberlain) and his girlfriend / fiancee Jessie (Sharon Stone). Together they make up a sort of Indiana Jones character as he is an adventureman while she is a scholar / philologist.

The two films lead them to exotic places where they must fend off natives as well as bad guys who are out to kill them. THE LOST CITY OF GOLD also features James Earl Jones as a friend of Allan's who joins them in their adventure.

The lost city of gold itself seems to be @ least loosely based on the mythical Eldorado which Voltaire made so famous in his CANDIDE.  I realize that Eldorado is South America while this city is supposedly in the middle of Africa, but the general legend is roughly the same.

If adventure movies are your thing, then these two belong on your shelf of DVDs. Yes, they are somewhat low budget and the monsters in them are not particularly convincing. And, yes, there are some aspects about the final battle that are a bit hokey.  However, that is not really the ""point."" These movies are FUN! The soundtracks are very good and we also get to see Sharon Stone in the prime of her beauty. What more could you ask for? Huh?",1182038400,2,1498,4.488970588235294

355646,2,6301763424,"Once upon a time somebody released a movie called Raiders of the Lost Ark, which did very well at the box office.  There was a scramble to cash in on its success, and so, some Hollywood types decided to re-make Rider Haggard's King Solomon's Mines with Richard Chamberlain and the relatively unknow Sharon Stone.  It wasn't a bad movie, but it was no masterpiece either.  As the making of the movie progressed, Miss Stone's garments kept shrinking in the wash.  The makers, realising that this might save the box office receipts decided to accelerate the trend, and, halfway through one scene her Bombay bloomers miraculously transformed themselves in to hot pants.

Subseqently, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was released and was a hit, to they released a sequel to King Solomon's Mines called Allan Quartermain and the Lost City of Gold, with the same cast as before, to cash in again.

Now you know that any movie with Lost City of Gold in the title is going to be a stinker, but will be saved by the continuing shrinking of Miss Stone's garments and the presence of bikini clad Amazons.  Unfortunately, two things went wrong.  One, Miss Stone's contract had a fully clothed clause in it and she remains overclad.  Two, they sent the bloke who does the flower arrangements out to hire the bikini clad Amazons and he returned with a lot of his similarly inclined male friends clad in white pajamas instead.  Result: insufficient crumpet!

They borrowed certain elements from Temple of Doom.  Sharon Stone screams more than Kate Capshaw.  There is a roller coaster ride through underground caverns, this time in a canoe instead of a mine cart.  There are hapless native slaves in a mine and a lava pit for the sacrifices.

Otherwise the movie is a throwback to an earlier era of B movie making.  In those old jungle movies, the blacks were in it to:

a.  Shout menacingly and throw spears,

b.  Provide the corpses, and.

c.  Provide the comedy relief, unless there was a monkey called Cheeta.

In this movie there are:

a. blacks who shout and throw spears,

b. five Ashari warriors who play the part of the five green bottles sitting on a wall (Somebody actually says: ""Oh, look!  We've lost another Ashari.""), and,

c. there is James Earle Jones providing the unintended comedy relief, in what is easily the worst performance of his otherwise distinguished career.  Tarzan isn't in this one so somebody has to substitute for the monkey and James got picked.

There is also a beautiful princess.  She is a goodie, so she is blonde.  She has an evil sister, who is, naturally, brunette.  So is the evil, if somewhat unkempt, high priest.  In old westerns you could tell who the goodies and the badies were by the colour of their hats, but this isn't a western, so we have to rely on hair colour.  There are no injuns either, so the blacks attack the fort.  Oops, I mean lost city.

Much of the middle of the movie ended on the cutting room floor to keep it short, so the climactic bit doesn't make much sense, but don't worry, you can watch the trailer and see the missing bits.  In fact, if you don't watch the trailer you won't see Dicky Chamberlain rescue the slaves or understand why the fort (sorry, city) is attacked.

In summary, this is a rather old fashioned jungle B movie.  It's not terribly good, but if you are supposed to be mowing the lawn, and it is raining, this will get you out of the housework and give you a laugh or two.  Some of the laughs will even be intentional.",1141430400,19,3497,4.577419354838709

However, this movie starts off promising, suddenly veers off into silly imitations of other  (and better) adventure movies, and finally, the writers throw caution to the winds and give us a Hollywood-musical-type ending so bizarre that you realize you've wasted your time. Disappointment? Another series called LOST comes to mind. Sharon Stone probably refuses to admit nowadays that she was in this movie, as she sets women characters back a hundred years with her giggling and screaming. She's supposed to be an archeologist? James Earl Jones plays the man with the axe (to cut through the jungle and the villains) - a waste of a good actor. Richard Chamberlain plays himself as always - a role that earned him a lot of money in his day. As to quality of video, the blu-ray edition is much more watchable than the DVD.
