8128559,5,B000G1TERS,Loved volume 2 although it was not as good as the first volume.  My 8 year old granddaughter was bored with this one but the 2 year old liked it.,1283472000,,145,3.8333333333333335
8128560,2,B000G1TERS,"This product leaves a lot to be desired. Too much English being spoken is my main gripe. I would like to know if these people have any experience teaching a language because there is no reason to give a small child TRANSLATION, which is what they do most of the time. ""Ni hao - that's how you say hello in Chinese"" is unnecessary to a small child, just show children greeting each other and the viewer in context and saying Ni hao. That's how YOU learned to say hello. Also they waste about 5-10% of the very short DVD with some really repetitive piano music with no talking at all. Sometimes they just shift the scene so you have no idea how it relates to anything. I could go on and on but it's true that kids will watch it, because they use colors, kids and a puppet - all things kids like. But it's way too sparse. It's too bad they wasted a great opportunity with such a below average product - BUT it's better than nothing and there's not much out there so if you have extra money just buy it. But people should stop saying this is a great product. Please.",1247356800,3,1062,4.21078431372549
8128561,5,B000G1TERS,"I am a Chinese American while my husband is Caucasian. Although we speak English at home, we really want our daughters to be able to speak Mandarin as well. The Bao Bei DVDs have been great and definitely a hit in our home. My almost 3 year old is always asking to watch Bao Bei and my 10 month old is fascinated by the colors and characters in the DVDs.

What's most fascinating is that my almost 3 year old now can name all the colors as well as count in Mandarin. If you are a parent and want your kids exposed to and learn Mandarin Chinese, definitely get all the Bao Bei DVD series!",1217289600,,587,4.104347826086957
8128562,5,B000G1TERS,My son loves watching this DVD over and over again.  I also watch the DVD with him and it's a great DVD for learning some basic Chinese.  It's a wonderful DVD to expose toddlers and young kids to Chinese.,1213833600,,204,4.205128205128205
8128563,5,B000G1TERS,"I bought this for our toddler, and really appreciate that it is simple and does not over-load kids with a mountain full of information they cannot possible absorb.  This DVD keeps it simple, colorful, and to the point, and gives children a chance to feel successful in their learning of Mandarin.  We've had a lot of fun with it!",1210982400,,329,4.559322033898305
8128564,5,B000G1TERS,"I bought all four DVDs for my 6moold son and I love them too! I am so excited to hear about the recent filming of the next 2 upcoming DVDs. So glad this company is doing these... I bought some ""other"" DVDs but nothing compares to the quality of yours!",1209427200,2,251,4.04
8128565,2,B000G1TERS,"The audio quality is pretty poor.  The background music is louder than some of the voices.  When learning a tonal language like Chinese, it is so important to hear the word very clearly. A simple vowel sound changes a word completely.  Also, they have small children repeating the words and small children, in any language, do not have the best pronunciation, so words could easily be learned wrong. Most of the video is older children or an adult talking, though.  As someone else mentioned, there is a lot of English in the video.  This is not at all an immersion method of learning. There is very little vocab taught.  The only reason I gave it a second star is because my 2 year old is REALLY into pandas and having a panda teach her anything, helps to her learn it.  If there were no panda, I'm not sure it would have kept her attention.  She repeats the Chinese just to talk to the panda. We got Learning Chinese and English Together off amazon.com and you learn SO much more, although it is not very entertaining.",1207612800,,1020,4.475675675675675
8128566,2,B000G1TERS,"I'm giving it 2 stars for several reasons:

1. Most of the DVD is in English, not Chinese.

2. As a native Mandarin speaker, I'm not that impressed with the quality of Chinese they teach. Some of the phrases they use are rather odd.

3. As the other reviewer pointed out, this DVD is rather empty of contents. The whole DVD teaches numbers 1 - 5 and three types of fruits: apple, banana and grapes.

I'd have gladly given it 1 star, except that it seems to keep my daughter entertained and she started saying 1-5 in Mandarin since she started watching it.",1183680000,2,555,4.359223300970874
8128567,5,B000G1TERS,"My 3 year old loves both dvds!  She keeps asking for Bao Bei!  I've heard her say things in Chinese around the house.  I know she's definitely learning, and she's having fun while she's doing it.  I don't expect her to be fluent in Chinese by watching a couple of dvds, but I think her pronunciation is quite good and this is a great introduction.  Hope they come out with more.

I thought my 5 year old would be too old for this dvd, but she loved it!  The colorful dvd really captures her attention.  She seems to really enjoy watching the panda.  There's the right amount of repetition of the words.  Seems like she's picking up some words!",1182384000,,643,4.3277310924369745
8128568,1,B000G1TERS,"We bought this for our two-year old to help her learn some Chinese before taking a trip to China to visit her relatives.  We were incredibly disappointed by the lack of content on the DVD.  During the entire 30 minute video, the viewer only learns about 10 Chinese words: the numbers one through five, and a few fruits.  Naturally, there's a lot of repetition in order to fill up that 30 minutes, so much so that by the end of the video my toddler was bored.  We haven't watched it again after that initial viewing.

Luckily, we had bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Play-Learn-CHINESE-with-Mei-Mei-Vol-2/dp/B000J3Q9SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Play & Learn CHINESE with Mei Mei Vol. 2</a>&nbsp;at the same time as this video, and our toddler liked that one much better.",1179446400,5,819,5.57258064516129
