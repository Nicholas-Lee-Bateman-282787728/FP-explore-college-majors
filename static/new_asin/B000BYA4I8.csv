2445574,5,B000BYA4I8,"I've can't wait. This is release is worth waiting for. This group are ""our"" friends. I call them our friends because this sitcom is somewhat equivalent to the show ""Friends"". Sinclair is Phoebe, Overton is Joey, Regine is Monica, Khadijah is Rachael, and Max is somewhat of a Sophia character or they can be compared to the ""Golden Girls"" Khadijah is Dorothy, Regine is Blanche, Sinclaire is Rose, and Max is Sophia which I already stated. The guys are just close male friends. Also the shows are in their correct order.",1134432000,7,520,4.725274725274725

Howevever, after reading the subject categories of the disc's, they do not seem to be in order.  I'd like to see from the very beginning in order. I see nothing about Sinclare even moving in with the girls.  Now it seems we'd have to float around from disc to disc to find the correct sequence of the storyline.  Maybe they can redo it and put it all in order.",1134345600,6,448,4.114942528735632
2445576,5,B000BYA4I8,"Like many other fans, I was totally infatuated with this show. I too have 2 VHS tapes that me and my sis repeatedly watch over and over and we still have the same laughs.

I requested Living Single to be available through Amazon a few months ago and can't believe its actually here. Well almost here, we've waited a decade already, so a couple more months won't hurt!

One of the best comedic shows that has been produced on television.",1132617600,4,436,4.4375

2445579,5,B000BYA4I8,"I'm so happy, one of my favorite shows is finally making it on DVD.....""we are Living Single, oh in the 90's kinda world, I'm glad I got my girl!"" I was just thinking to myself, man I wish Living Single was on dvd, and now it is! This was one of the greatest African-American shows on television! I loved each character!! For those who have never seen it, you must purchase this DVD and add to your collection!!!!!",1131321600,8,414,4.32051282051282
2445580,5,B000BYA4I8,"I have been waiting FOREVER for this series to be released on DVD, and had actually thought that it would never happen, because, well, African American shows don't get enough demand for the distributors to release them...(like the Showtime series - ""Soul Food""). This is by far the best comedic situation depicting African Americans.  My favorite characters are Kyle and Max, because those two are so hilarious around each other. Regine is something else with her biting wit and unrepentant style. Synclaire & Overton are a twisted match made in heaven. Khadijah adds some semblance of sanity on the show, but at the most appropriate times shows her lunacy is well hidden.  I love them all. I can't wait to get my copy, and I hope they are planning to release the subsequent seasons immediately.  But until then, TIVO has been my life savior. I really was sad when they cancelled the show, but now I'm estatic to know that it's been given new life.",1131321600,,948,4.733333333333333

2445733,5,B000BYA4I8,I love watching living single  and  bring back great memories of them Thursday nights  after martin and then new York undercover.  but after watch the entire series in its entirety  I know what the hold up is  and people  its not really sales its music  clearances  and  that what really keeping a lot of these shows from ever coming to dvd. the music labels  and artist. If the company gotta pay all this money to clear  music and then sales  tanks its  a waste of money  time  and hard work.but living do contain a lot of music and that why the rest of the seasons are not out  . It's rally a show how the music industy can dictate what can come out on dvd  cause if they don't approve or  the company don't wanna fork over the thousands or millions  cause of the sales profit it won't happen,1446854400,,794,4.201342281879195

Now my daughter absolutely LOVES this show. She's in the military so I ordered the first season for
her to take with her to Hawaii. She can't watch dish/cable shows or schedule DVR like the rest of us. She's relying on
laptops, kindles, ipads....etc..... Anyway, I know she'll be happy to have this but would love to have the whole
collection. Some of our favorite episodes are in later seasons.",1397174400,,552,4.642857142857143

Except for certain things that are dated (records, boom boxes, the lack of cell phones and iPods), the subjects, interactions, and adventures are pretty accessible today.  The actors and actresses all seem like they really liked each other in person (as is related in cast interviews for the extra on disc 4) which translated to their characters.  Their relationships seemed real and that also made for the show to be very entertaining.  The show also does not rely on sex humor to be funny (like many ""comedies"" today).  It is truly a situation comedy that relates to humorous incidents in the lives of young people.  A great show fit for the family to enjoy over and over.",1393286400,2,742,4.713178294573644

Needless to say, I was quite happy to find it and though I wasn't aware of the show when it was on air, you can see why more than ten years later people are clamoring for it.

As for future seasons, seemingly the only thing stopping that is because the producers can't get music rights for songs used in later seasons. Quite the bummer.",1364947200,,460,4.2272727272727275

well, for anyone who didn't get the chance to see the show back in the day: it's about 4 african-american women having busy lives, working and being friends.  i really like how the show didn't do any negative stereotypes of black women.  they were 4 professional women, with no kids and always busy.  they also have great times with their upstairs neighbors, kyle and overton.

back in the day, this and martin were my 2 fave shows to watch every week.  now, if yvette lee bowser [show creator] is reading this...we need the rest of the seasons on dvd!! season 1 had that classic burglary show that i hadn't seen for the longest time.  if you all loved watching the show when it was first on, the dvd is even better!! incl. an interview with all the cast [except queen latifah] on what they think of the show after all this time.  get it!! i still love watching living single and the dvds take you back down memory lane.",1357430400,,1094,4.376237623762377

""Living Single"" myself (pun intended), I felt that it was only right for me to relive my childhhood memories of watching Kadijah, Maxine, Sinclair and Regine. Queen Latifah was my role model in a sense back then and I related to Kadijah's character the most. I lived through the fantasy of someday meeting my Scooter. I could always appreciate Maxine's wit and independence, another character I looked forward to watching. Even watching the love unfold between Overton and Sinclair was awe inspiring.

The First Season of Living Single is everything I imagined and remembered. I am extremely upset that Seasons 2-5 are not available for sale. Warner Bros. claim that it was due to the poor sales of Season 1.....BOOOOOO!!!!!!

I need all of the seasons in my life right now. I want to see Overton and Sinclair get married, Kadijah leaving to move in with Scooter and Regine finally finding her man.

BONUS: I finally learned the mystery line with the them song. It is ""True Blue and Tight like glue."" Now this doesn't make any sense but this line is referenced in and episode on Disc 1 where Overton says the exact same line.",1342569600,,1158,4.751243781094527

2445985,5,B000BYA4I8,"I paid very little attention to this show during its initial run. But viewings on TV One have made me aware of how hilarious this comedy really was.
  With the talents of Queen Latifah, who sings the title song, as magazine editor, Khadijah James, Kim Coles as her child-like cousin, Synclaire, who came from Minnesota to help her run ""Flavor"" Magazine, Erica Alexander's high-powered attorney Maxine Shaw,Kim Fields as gold digger Regine Hunter, T.C. Carson as stock broker Kyle Barker, and John Henton as the staid and slow-talking but surprisingly profound handyman Overton Wakefield Jones, audiences enjoyed five seasons of glimpses into the lives of a group of African American singles sharing an apartment complex in New York, with occasional guest appearances from everyone from the legendary Eartha Kitt(whom Kyle escorts to a mayor-sponsored fundraiser ""to get the graffiti off of the animals in the Bronx Zoo"" as a favor to get her to invest with his firm) to wrapper Heavy D in between.
  We see the complex relationships these apartment dwellers have with each other,and with others, and the banter between Max and Kyle is reminiscent of Beatrice and Benedict in Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but much more wicked. The interactions between Synclaire and Overton are more amiable, and either way, it is easy to see who is destined for each other as the series progresses.
 At one point, Carson even wows us with his talent as a jazz vocalist. Two years after the series ended, he released an album entitled, ""Truth"".
 This lovely well-written comedy was a great showcase for many talented  Black actors. But the audiences can easily ignore the issues of race while watching it, and nearly two decades after its release, it can still have audiences rolling with laughter.",1301097600,,1791,5.0508474576271185

I thought it was funny then, but after watching it on dvd, I statred noticing certain things when I would try to watch it on t.v. the networks cut out certain lines (many of which are FUNNY!!). The audience laughter that you hear after a joke, is softer on the dvd and the timing is better. Also, sometimes the networks cut out the whole theme song but you get it here. It's a really funny show and I love that I can watch my favortie episodes over and over. It's a set of 4 discs. 1 and 3 are the funniest, in my opinion but really I enjoy the whole set.

I truly enjoyed watching LS when it was a regular series on TV.  In many ways it reminded me of the many ""single"" women I worked with in my past corporate experiences and, still growing strong. The punch lines were always on cue and the seriousness of certain issues were always handled with good taste. Case in point, when Regine required to have a breast reduction and her friends all rallied to her side and gave her strong support.  Living Single brings to the forefront what many African-American women have experienced in life and it helped me as a Latina woman to better understand them as well.

2446029,5,B000BYA4I8,"""Living single"" was a young,black,sort-of hip/hop,classy answer to ""Golden Girls"" (which was also a fave of mine). ""Living single"" had humor,zest,wit,and an urban sophistication vibe that you cant't help but to surround yourself with the characters. I just hope that they will release the other seasons ASAP. On certain cable stations, they are interrupted by commercials and sometimes even edited. No disrespect to the show ""Martin"", but they are putting those seasons on DVD very rapidly. I feel that it's because ""Living single"" had the crazy humor, but was also very Chic and made you think about serious things in everyday life; while martin was sort of bufoon-ish; sort of like 90's version of steppin fetchit or amos n' andy with a high-top fade. But anyway I recommend living single. Because in a 90's kind of world, you'll be glad you bought this DVD (in 2008). I also like the jazzy vibe of the theme song!!",1227225600,,917,4.884615384615385

In my opinion, Queen Latifiah, Kim Coles, Erika Alexander, Kim Fields, John Henton and T.C. Carson created a show that is pretty timeless. If was ""Friends"" before FRIENDS but better in my view! It not only made you laugh but it made you think about things deeper than that.

The only tragedy here is that it doesn't get the press that other black shows like Martin or The Cosby Show gets. Otherwise, there would be more than just this one season out. I hope one day they release all the seasons because otherwise you have to watch TVOne just to see the other episodes since they are starting to show on there.

The characters of Max, Kadijah,Regine,Sinclair,Overton and Kyle were very creative and original. I resent the comparison to shows like Friends because if anything, Friends took concepts from Living Single due to the fact that Friends aired after Living Single. Anyway the show Living Single was a great depiction of African Americans but furthermore a great depection of single life in the Big Apple. I wish the show aired longer than it did.

2446100,5,B000BYA4I8,"""Living Single"" is a sitcom about three women who reside together: Regine, Khadijah and Synclaire.  Add their friend Max, who is ever present in their home, and their neighbors Kyle and Overton, and you have a great formula for what was a very successful TV show!  Khadijah and Max are the most level headed of the bunch, often holding everything together.  Synclaire is the nave, sweet woman in the clan.  Regine is the superficial, man hungry one of the bunch.  Together they bring a heap amount of laughter!  Although the show is titled, ""Living Single"", between the four of them, a man was often present.

 Season One includes a lot of great episodes.  We see all throughout the season certain things: Regine will sometimes stop at nothing to gain the interest of a man, Overton has an undying crush on Synclaire, Max things she's the greatest lawyer alive, and Kyle's ego is as big as the day is long.  Although Khadijah has a very hard edge about herself, she manages to attract some men in season one.  In one episode, her friends feel neglected because she is spending much time with a man.  Khadijah is illustrated as very headstrong, intelligent and usually tries to avoid conflict.  Sometimes her friends would come to her trying to get her to gossip, and she would usually refuse.  Synclaire is illustrated as a real sweetheart throughout this season.  Sometimes, however, they made her say and do some things that made her look like a moron.  For example, some of the things she did at her job were just unorthodox like firing one of her coworkers when Khadijah put her in charge because she was sick.  But the love Overton has for Snyclair is undeniable.  He always looks out for her and makes sure everyone is treating her nicely.  Because he had his eye on her, he didn't want anyone else dating her, and sometimes he would go to extremes to prevent that.  In one episode, Synclaire goes out on a date with a doctor.  When Overton finds out about it, he goes to the restaurant where Snyclaire and her date are dining, and finds a way to get her date to leave, and Overton finishes the night with Synclaire, pure comedy!  Several times, we see Regine dating different men with prestige and good looks.  In episode one, she even dates a married man!  She stoops to some pretty low levels to appease the men in her life.

 I recommend this set of DVDs to anyone who is looking for some laughter.  I love watching the show because of the great personalities of the characters and the interaction between them.",1168473600,,2521,4.606741573033708

2446114,5,B000BYA4I8,"I've loved this show since its conception. I love each and every cast member because they all bring their own originality to the table. My favorite character was Khadijah James. She was the headstrong leader of the pack and frequently (and deservedly) referred to herself as ""Mother"". She was an incredible inspiration to me as I was coming into age as a young black female and I have always admired Queen Latifah ever since.

My second favorite is Max. She's the smooth talking, quick witted, hopelessly parasitic Lawyer and friend of the group. Whenever she and Kyle (the arrogant investment broker) are in the same room together, take cover because the insults start flying!

Next, who can forget Sinclaire, Khadijah's lovably feebleminded cousin from Minnesota. Her overzealous perkiness alone was enough to make you want to chuck rocks at her. And leave us not forget her equally doltish boyfriend, Overton. These two are a match made in sitcom heaven.

Last, but not least we have Regine (pronounced RAY-SCHJEEN). Infamously known for her pompous, narcissistic, gold-digging, man-chasing tendencies. She's the woman we all loved to hate.

Together, this cast makes up one of the best/funniest television shows I have ever had the good fortune to witness.

Not bad for a sitcom that was forced to compete with Friends. I won't get into all of that in this review...thats a different talk show...yet I digress.

Believe it or not they used to air this series in Australia. I used to rush home from school to make it just on time. I recorded all episodes which had aired in Sydney Australia (which was many years ago. I had 4 tapes in total and can now only find one.

To have this box set is unbelievable. I enoyed each episode better than the last and can watch them repeatedly.

I think the whole cast was perfect; inclduing Queen Latifah who was cast as Kadija. Her performance which was referred to as ""horrid"" in the previous review is harsh and obviously misguided. Oh well, everyone is entitled to their own opinion!!!

This show doesn't.  It's still as funny as hell.  Overton (the girls' handyman neighbour) steals the show every time (as does Max) and I love the banter between all the girls and the love/hate relationship between Max and Kyle.  They fight all the time and their quips are so funny.  It's full of fun and quirky characters and cute 'storylines' that will have you in stitches over and over.  There are times when it looks a little dated (like the episode where they went out to a club to go dancing and the now funny scene where Kyle has a brand new cell phone - a first back then), but it's got that cool 90's feel.  I love this and highly recommend it to all fans of 90's shows with lot's of laughs.  Look for a very young Terrence Howard in Hand That Robs The Cradle episode.",1143158400,6,956,4.2555555555555555

2446141,5,B000BYA4I8,"I loved this show when it was on the air (I didn't even know anything about Friends for years because LS was up against it).  I had a lot of the episodes taped, but I let a friend borrow them who has since moved away.  I thought I wouldn't get to see this brilliant comedy again.  The banter between Max and Kyle, the off-center comments by Synclair, the many wigs of Regine, the down-home wisdom of Overton, and the call-it-like-I-see-it-ness of Khadijah - smart, funny, sophisticated, and a great time!",1140566400,2,504,4.5777777777777775
2446142,5,B000BYA4I8,"My boys and I are so happy that it's out on DVD.  We can't wait till season 2 comes out, I plan on buying all of them!  I only wish that they would have a reunion show.",1140566400,3,168,3.5135135135135136
2446143,5,B000BYA4I8,"I never really got the chance to watch this show on TV during their premiere. Awesome collection. I'm sure, judging by the previous commentators, that the chronology of this first season set is off. I still don't know how the four girls became room buddies and the two fellas. But nonetheless, this is a great start up. Glad to have it in possession. Now I hope for the other seasons the executors arrange a better timeline for us folks who really never got to see this show. Other than this small annoyance, the DVD set is great! Love all the actors/actresses. They are all gems and funny as heck! : )",1140393600,2,602,4.4324324324324325
2446144,5,B000BYA4I8,I don't usually buy seasons 1 and 2 or 3 of some shows- because the characters and actors still need time to become confortable with the everything-but this show starts off PERFECT- a lot of the shows i thought was in the 3 and 4th season were in the 1st- and it gets better by season- simply awesome- if u thinking about buying it- GO AND GET IT- its WAAY worth it :),1140220800,4,368,4.054794520547945
2446145,4,B000BYA4I8,"I liked ""Living Single"" when it appeared on Fox in the '90s. Perhaps the biggest gamble and risk was of Fox putting it against NBC's ultra-popular sitcom ""Friends."" But Living managed to get strong audiences while Friends was always No. 1 or top 10. For that alone, Fox kept the show's integrity going without saying anything about the other network's competition. I'm really getting this DVD and future seasons' DVDs to really follow on Maxine's on-off relationship with her boyfriend played by TC. I didn't pay close attention to it during the show's run. Their relationship got stronger in the fourth and fifth seasons.  Queen Latifah, Kim Fields and the very funny Kim Coles were all good on the show and Erika Alexander was the best out of the four actors on that show with her Maxine character. Her Maxine character was the most believable.  Kim Fields' Regine was always changing her hairstyle on nearly every show.  Latifah really managed to translate well to TV after several rap albums. She has always been good at anything she does--TV, movies, music, daytime talk show that lasted 2 years and so forth. Some of this season's first shows from '93 are a little weak--some of the writing is a little silly, but the show's '94 episodes were better as well as the next four seasons. It's kind of similar to some of the characters on ""Friends"",the quirkiness and adult humor of some of them. Plus, they live in an apartment. I liked that they finally put it on DVD even though it's been on syndication on local stations and cable networks for a few years now. Don't wait no longer--get this DVD now and start laughing!",1139961600,4,1624,4.711267605633803
2446146,4,B000BYA4I8,I'm all for Living Single (my Tivo can show and prove) BUT... MARTIN is one of the ULTIMATE BEST COMEDY SHOW EVER! When Is it coming out on DVD? Does anyone have the information on this??? I hope something surfaces soon!,1139529600,2,220,4.390243902439025
2446147,3,B000BYA4I8,Im not gonna disrespect the show at all but if it wasn't for Martin this show wouldnt have lasted as long as it did the reason why they put it on on thursday at 830 for so many years is because martin Had unlimited ratings it proved its point after martin got cancled the show couldn't keep its strong edge it move to diffrent days time slots etc till finally it faulterd itself even new york undercover fell off after he got cancled it was the same method they(Fox Network) was tryin to do with the cedric the entrtainer show Playing it after the Berine Mac show to get smooth easy ratings didn't work for him though. BUT sorry ladies great wholesome friendly show and all but I just don't understand why theres not a dvd season set out for this man yet I think once martin goes to DVD it gonna sell just as much as the Chapelle shows success PEOPLE REQUEST MARTIN ON DVD NOW!,1139011200,4,877,4.25748502994012
2446157,5,B000BYA4I8,"Have always loved this show for its depiction of strong, intelligent, diverse, Black woman of the sort I've always known and loved, not the sort film/TV execs typically show us. Will get this DVD & share appropriate episodes with my two young daughters. But am most excited to get the episode wherein Kyle sings, ""My Funny Valentine"". BEST rendition EVER. Which episode/season WAS that? Toward the end, when Max goes to the fertility clinic? Other? Thx!",1138924800,2,453,4.973684210526316

It was truly a good show that was well written (unlike so many on today). The local radio station had the nerve to ask callers which show was better, ""Girlfriend"" or ""Living Single""...Pa-leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeze! ""Living Single"", hands down!!!!!!!!!!!

2446161,5,B000BYA4I8,"Back in the days when martin, living single and new york undercover put black people on network tv because it was real entertainment and tackled a lot of serious issues. To me this show was so phenomenal not only because of the fine sistas and brothas but because what it stand for. Queen Latifah(Dana Owens) Kim Fields(Tootie), Kim Coles(In Living Color), and Erika Alexander(The Crosby Show)will not also laugh your socks off but touch your hearts in this one of a kind tv show. On a scale from 1 to 10 I'd give it 20.",1138147200,2,520,4.484210526315789
