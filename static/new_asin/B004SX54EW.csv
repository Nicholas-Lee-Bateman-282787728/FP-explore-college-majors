8440294,5,B004SX54EW,"This Korean drama is a modern interpretation of the traditional folk musical, ""Legend of Choon Hyang."" Lee Mong Ryong is a sly troublemaker who moves into town after his father becomes the local police chief. In a very unpredictable way, he meets Sung Choon Hyang, a sassy, smart girl. Because of a huge misunderstanding, the two decide to get married. Though they bicker constantly, eventually they have real feeling of love for each other, but people keep trying to tear them apart. Lee Mong Ryong's first love shows up and a powerful CEO becomes obsessive with delightful Sung Choon Hyang.

This is a great, witty romantic comedy. The main couple make a great pair. There are a lot of laugh out loud moments, as well as heartfelt and even some serious action scenes. I suggest giving it a try. This drama is also called, ""Delightful Girl, Choon Hyang."" (Good English Subtitles.)",1384819200,,881,4.8344370860927155
8440295,4,B004SX54EW,"Delightful Girl/Sassy Girl Chun-Hyang was my very first K drama and it got me hooked into what is now my K drama obsession! lol So I wanted to get a physical copy to start off my collection. The dvd's themselves came in excellent condition, brand new no complaints. There are four CDs in the box and the shipping was good as well. The only thing that keeps it from being perfect is the subtitles do get misspelled sometimes or are wrong but it doesn't bother me to much since i practically know what they are saying. But for others that might be annoying. Overall if your a K drama fan this is certainly a must have.",1380758400,,616,4.318965517241379
8440296,5,B004SX54EW,"One of the best K-Drama and it's actually landed the no. 1 spot in my my k-drama collections. Both the lead stars have great chemistry and they played their role very well. The supporting casts added bonus to this drama, acting was great. I cried, I laughed and I fell in live with the story. I have watched it several times since I purchased this DVD the last 5 years. I never get tired of it. It's really worth buying and watching for so don't wait buy this now=).",1378166400,,466,4.247191011235955
