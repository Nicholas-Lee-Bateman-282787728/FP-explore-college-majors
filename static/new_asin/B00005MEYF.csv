7945312,4,B00005MEYF,"I got this based on a review in John Grant's ""Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Film Noir"" (which any student of film MUST read).

Grant liked the flick.

But he didn't/couldn't prepare me for what I saw.

The tale of a clerk who decides to become a private eye, and the tragedies that befall him, is unlike any film, noir, blanc, pastel, that you've ever seen.

As to my over all impression, see the headline.",1386979200,2,406,4.52054794520548
7945313,1,B00005MEYF,"As a big fan of independent films (which this is) I was all looking forward to this film.. it looked rather dark noir-ish and that's a genre I enjoy, when done well. As it turns out, however, this is the most dull and senseless movie I've seen in quite a while. There is no real mystery, per se. And the acting is atrocious. In a nutshell, the plot is basically this.. a woman sees her husband cheating on her and so calls a Detective. The P.I. falls in love with her because she's so ""naive"" and ""beautiful."" He finds out, eventually, that it's true that her husband cheated on her. He tells her, she moves in with him. They eat Mexican food together but don't do much talking. (her only line for almost 20 minutes is ""I don't want to talk."" She says it over and over again.) Eventually, she leaves the Detective and gets back together with her husband. We don't know why. We don't care why.
This is not a plot. This is a rough draft sketch of a plot. And this movie is a big bummer.",1020211200,5,984,4.211640211640212
