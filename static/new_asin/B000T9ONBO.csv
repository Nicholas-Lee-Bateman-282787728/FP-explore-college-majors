2895178,5,B000T9ONBO,"There are not enough DVD's on the market to expose the later day saints church, so comparing this series to others is very difficult. I feel the Mormon church had changed its book so often, they will just change it again to adapt to this DVD. God Makers exposes the Mormon church for what it is, a man made phony religion that has a very seedy beginning. No matter how much they change, good fruit cannot come from a bad tree. I would feel shocked so many people fall for this religion, but look at Catholicism and Islam.",1267315200,17,521,4.326530612244898

'Saints Alive in Christ' with Jeremiah

Films, is now on DVD but none is curre-

ntly being sold threw amazon, so I have

to place this review on the VHS side of

the products. Get this on either format

if you can, Mr. and Mrs. America. Try to

get anyone you know out of this cult. The

admissions of the Mormons in here are en-

ough to convince me of how brainwashed

they are.",1177545600,2,422,4.098765432098766

8208261,2,B000T9ONBO,"After reading the first God Makers and watching the first DVD, which expose Mormon theology and provide well documented  references from LDS literature and inspired works, I hoped to find other helpful details in this DVD.
Unfortunately, this video is just  gossip without any substance.
 The author also states that late Mormon prophet Gordon Hinckley was a homosexual.
This information, given without any substance, is irrelevant in order to learn about Mormon theology and what prophet Smith and his apostles did allegedly  under divine revelation.",1386374400,2,551,5.447058823529412
8208262,2,B000T9ONBO,This tape was so old and poor quality that I just watched a short period of it and became very bored. Was not that informative of the Mormon cult. Should be updated to today's church so that it would be more believable.,1372118400,,219,4.238095238095238
8208263,5,B000T9ONBO,This video by Jeremiah films is another classic that demonstrates the reality of devil worship seen in the Mormon church and the dangers for true Christian to be aware.,1365984000,,168,4.827586206896552
8208264,4,B000T9ONBO,"The original God Makers film was packed with so much information about the Mormon religion. I was expecting even more with part two. I was a bit disappointed, but perhaps my expectations were too high.",1363305600,3,201,4.771428571428571
8208265,3,B000T9ONBO,"The movie was alright but it only told me what I already knew about this peculiar  Cult. I thought that the film maker would have hammered them more. I am an Atheist so the Idea that is conveyed in this movie makes no sense to me, (that is) saying that there is a difference between any of these Sky God Cults. The God of the Old Testament  believes in Serial Murder, Child molestation and Rape. . The New Testament throws in with a guy that was so deluded that he believed that the Hideous Freak of the Old Testament was his Father and the Mormons get behind both of them. To round out the crew they introduce the imaginary Sky Gods brother or other son or something  that calls himself Moroni (actually it doesnt matter what old Peepstone Joe Smith called him because its all BS anyway).They are all Insane. Thats the message that I expected from this Movie. Maybe I should have made the movie myself JC",1356652800,,905,4.375
8208266,1,B000T9ONBO,"I was very disappointed in these DVD's. I found them to be a copy of an old DVD. I was expecting them to be updated.

I do not recommend these DVD's because there are others on the market that are up to date.",1309996800,3,208,3.8372093023255816
