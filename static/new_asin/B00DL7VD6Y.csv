8594276,4,B00DL7VD6Y,"This is really an enjoyable old time video. I think most of it was filmed in the 1950s and 1960s. However, it is longer in time than the 30 minutes shown here. There are actually 3 videos with a total time of 54 minutes. Big Trains Rolling is 25 minutes, Progress on Rails is 15 minutes, and Wheels of Steel is 13 minutes long. My copy on VHS had tracking problems and low sound volume, but that was a normal problem sometimes with VHS tapes.",1489190400,,442,4.211764705882353
