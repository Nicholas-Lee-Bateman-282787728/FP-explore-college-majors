8235604,5,B000ZJ2ZQI,This review pertains to the content and not the DVD. I ran a video store for the better half of the 90's and these were a decent renter out of the cult section. They were pretty funny and just pure sleazy fun! I never knew this was out until I found it out of print here. I hope it finds its way to a re-release again soon!,1228262400,,323,3.8358208955223883
