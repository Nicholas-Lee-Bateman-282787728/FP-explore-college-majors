8146157,4,B000ILZA10,"Rock Around the Clock, 1956 film

This story begins at a ballroom, the band plays a waltz. The big bands are breaking up. Look at the record sales. Two musicians plan to go to New York. [Are those automobiles product placements?] What do they do in small towns? They listen to Bill Haleys Comets! Rock and roll. [Note the clothes and hair styles.] Was this an education for viewers? Steve Hollis will manage the band; its his business. Can he sign the Comets and promote them? They show mid-town New York city. [$20,000 was a lot of money back in 1956.] We see a band playing a mambo. Will new music attract a paying audience? The Comets will play at the ritzy Mansfield School.

Then Freddy Bell and the Bell Boys perform. Later they hear Alan Freed on the radio. The Platters sing Only You. The Comets sing their hit song. [Note the cars in the background.] Miss Talbot offers a contract to Lisa. Theres a catch though. The Comets sing in San Francisco. There is a plan for a televised Rock and Roll Jamboree for financial success, and it will be televised from Hollywood California. The Platters sing The Great Pretender. The Comets play an instrumental. The saxophone player is active. Its a big hit. Lisa and Jimmy speak. We learn about Steve Harts past. The Comets sing their famous hit song. People join in dancing. And so it ends.

This movie is like a fossil from the past. I read that disdain in the Corporate Press for Rock n Roll was based on economics. Before RnR three record companies controlled 90% of the record business. New small companies profited from this new music so it took thirty companies to control 90% of the record business. This drop in market share and value affected powerful interests. I once read that many record companies in the 1960s could point to one manager as the man who turned down The Beatles. Novelty is desired by some, rejected by others.",1390867200,,1886,4.57396449704142

If not, it will not play in the US.  The source provided a full red fund, so no complaints from that perspective.",1347062400,,284,4.035714285714286

8146160,5,B000ILZA10,"I saw this film at least a dozen times when it came out in the fifties.  I was 15 then, I believe, and just starting to get a love for music that I wanted to consider ""mine"". Every single song that bacame popular was in it--along with the two great hits of the Platters, up to that time, ""Only You"" and ""The Great Pretender"". In my opinion, Bill Haley started it all--Little Richard was great,but Haley was there first.  Elvis was king, no doubt about it, but we danced to Bill Haley---the first one in the jukebox at a place near me had ""ABC Boogie""---very danceable tune---then ""See You Later, Alligator"", ""Razzle Dazzle"", and ""Rock-a-Beatin' Boogie"", ""Happy Baby""---Wow-----you could really dance to those tunes---my parents hated them, of course--as they hated Richard, Elvis and most of the others----they didn't even like Pat Boone----strange that the signature hit ""Rock Around the Clock"" was never popular (around my city anyway)--it was a bit too fast to dance to-----and believe me,jiving was the thing to do in the fifties.  I am so glad to have this movie in my DVD collection and heartily recommend it to any fan who really appreciates fifties rock 'n roll.",1167264000,15,1170,4.782178217821782
