8369905,1,B002GQ65U0,"I've bought ""your first real Dance Class No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3-
and have also payed the tax for Germany and shipping.
All the three DVD's are absolutly idendity - and there is no difference
between no. 1 and no. 2 and no. 3 - the context is always the same.!!!
I can' t believe it. So No. 2 and No. 3  can I throw away.
It's probably a mistake in producing ???
I'am very disapointed.... wasted so much money !!!",1271116800,,412,3.963855421686747
8369906,5,B002GQ65U0,This class is fun and easy to follow.  My daughter can't wait for her daily 'dance class' to begin.  Tanya and Louis McKay share their obvious LOVE of teaching with their young students.,1247184000,,186,4.606060606060606
