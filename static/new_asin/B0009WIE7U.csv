8068276,1,B0009WIE7U,"What did I just watch for two hours? Two children embark on a road trip to search for their father in Germany. It's a MacGuffin since we learn from the uncle that there is no father and that it was just a lie. The children refuse to believe it and continue on their quest. Along the way, they meet someone who helps them and someone who rapes the young girl in a terribly disturbing scene.

I read that the director was influenced by Orson Welles' long take at the beginning of Touch of Evil. Here, Angelopolous makes virtually every shot in the movie using the long take. Granted, it must've taken a great deal of time and patience to get every shot right, but after awhile, I stopped being impressed and started to wonder where this was going. A giant hand emerges from the water and is carted off by a helicoptor. A tree emerges out of the mist. It was unclear to me what any of this was supposed to mean. Would it have made any difference if a tree had emerged from the water and a giant hand had emerged out of the mist?

My conclusion? I thought this was a pretentious movie.",1511568000,,1081,4.2682926829268295
8068277,4,B0009WIE7U,"I seem to have the same reaction to each of Angelopoulos' films; flawed genius. But in each film, what feels flawed and what feels masterful is different.

Mild spoilers ahead...

In this story of a 12 year old girl and her younger brother on a fruitless journey for their non- existent father in Germany what works is the ultimate emotional impact of the piece (it left me in tears), and (as always) the sheer poetic power of some of Angelopoulos' images.

On the other hand, a key supporting character (the youthful actor Oresteis) is thinly written and exists basically as an overly-convenient plot point. Some of the dialogue and ideas feel heavy handed, and some images are lifted from other director's films. And the references to his own earlier film 'The Traveling Players' are an interesting, brave style choice, but also a bit distracting and intellectual. The young girl's acting is mostly terrific, but the young boy feels fake at times, which doesn't help.

There are scenes I'll never forget. Maybe the most disturbing (yet completely hidden) rape scene I've ever seen. But other scenes feel awkward or forced.

This is the kind of film that may grow on revisiting, and I certainly plan to see it again.

If possible, get your hands on the now out-of-print 'New Star' DVD.  The transfer was overseen by the director, and it blows away the New Yorker DVD.",1292630400,,1368,4.7957446808510635
8068278,5,B0009WIE7U,"There is a superlative scene in Theo Angelopoulos's 1988 film Landscape In The Mist (''''' '''' '''''' or Topio Stin Omichli) that is amongst the best filmic depictions of sexual abuse ever shown, and should be shown as a primer to Hollywood directors on how to be subtle and poetic, especially when dealing with such terminally PC topics. In it, the young ten or twelve year heroine of the film, Voula (Tania Palaiologou), who is on the run, in search of her nonexistent father (whom her never seen onscreen mother has told the children resides in Germany, even though she has no idea who their father/s is/are), with her five or six year old brother Alexandre (Michalis Zeke), has hitched a ride with a nameless truck driver (Vassilis Kolovos). After he tries to dump the kids off at a truck stop diner, but they follow him, he pulls over on the side of a road, as the boy sleeps. He tells her to get out of the truck, and then grabs her into the body of the truck, which is covered with a sheet, or tarp. Manifestly, he wants to sexually abuse her in some way. The camera never pans away from the back of the truck. We hear nothing, and after a minute or two, the young boy pops out of the truck cab and goes in search of his sister, calling her name. He runs out of frame, and a minute or two later the trucker gets out of the back of the truck. Now, the camera zooms in, slowly, to the truck, so that nothing but its back exists in the frame. Then, we see Voula slowly emerge from under the tarp. Her legs, then body. She looks shell-shocked, and her hands are bloodies. Whether this is from her hymen being broken, and feeling herself, or from an injury given to her by the trucker, or scratching him, we are not sure. The blood is not substantial, although likely too much for a broken hymen. Whether she was raped or merely fondled, we watch her face as she smears the blood on the side of the truck. This says far more than any graphic shot of the violence could, especially if quick cut in an MTV style. It also allows us to zoom in and feel her numbness and wonder at the blood.
  Yet, this is merely one of many bravura shots in this great, great film, which opens with a shot at a train station, then hits the credits. Angelopoulos is a master of the picaresque, stringing together a brilliantly unobtrusive yet powerful narrative through a series of realistic, yet utterly poetic, moments. He also trusts his audience to watch and get the little moments of insight he slips in and never condescends to them. He leaves much in the film unexplained. But, we can fill in the blanks, and even if my answer is a bit different from yours, the overall arc coheres. This tack is brilliantly illustrated in yet another scene, where the kids encounter a twentysomething motorcyclist who drives the family bus for a troupe of entertainers, The Traveling Players (a group that is a direct nod to Fellini's La Strada and Variety Lights, and was the titular subject of his 1975 film of that name). The way Angelopoulos films the group of old would be Vaudevilleans as they rehearse on a beach for a performance is a direct nod to Fellini in his 8.... This film has long been grouped with two other of Angelopoulos's films (Voyage To Cythera and Ulysses' Gaze) as a voyage trilogy, but it certainly stands alone, self-contained, as a great work of art. If the other two films are as powerful, Angelopoulos will have authored a trilogy that stands with the best that Bergman, Antonioni, Ozu, or Kieslowski have offered. Of course, detractors have claimed what they usually do about great films that depend upon a penetrating beyond the ordinary- that this and other films by Angelopoulos are slow and boring. But, given the depth this film covers, it is a film that could have gone on another hour and remained fascinating. Also, the film is filled with movement- emotional, material, or narrative, even if the frame stands still. Then, there is the mixture of the personal, political, mythic and sexual, so no critic worth their salt can claim the films are boring, unless they are simply wishing for Orestes to have crashed and burnt on his motorcycle.
  Landscape In The Mist is a truly great film and work of art, loaded with little moments (a cock that struts into a train station and is caught before the camera pans to the sleeping children) and those grand (as mentioned). It strives for a sort of an implicate order even as it specifies its claims to two individual children, and it is in the fluid melding of such high aims in such an easily achieved manner that Angelopoulos's greatness in this film is achieved. It is one of those films where, even without thinking, the perfection of its image and message succeeds in moving the viewer. Sit still, be moved, and watch. Landscape In The Mist is that great.",1221350400,4,4816,4.525832376578645
8068279,5,B0009WIE7U,"This ravishing, utterly dreamlike road fable by Greek master Angelopoulos features some of the most remarkable visual set pieces you will ever see: a wedding party half-buried in blinding white snow, a gargantuan hand rising from the ocean. Throughout, the director evinces a strong concern with Greek history and national identity, embodied in his young protagonists' fixation on their paternity and the down-and-out actors' moribund routines. Though Voula and Alexandre's quixotic journey through wintry landscapes and along muddy back roads is largely a somber, unhappy affair, the remarkable performances, mobile camerawork, and Angelopoulos's eye for the jarring epiphany make ""Mist"" a demanding but ultimately enthralling experience.",1183939200,2,739,5.981132075471698
8068280,5,B0009WIE7U,"If God makes silence, the children must reinvent the world and return it its lost majesty!

Two fulminating and devastating images support the film: in the beginning of the picture the sister tells the story of the Creation to his brother for him to sleep and the other, in the end when the brother after making the awful journey tells the same story to her sister, whom in this case is frightened. The elder sister writes in the letter to his father this eloquent statement: ""We don't know We are so tired that we don't know if we go forward or back, so we lose themselves...""

Let's talk the same Angelopoulos: ""We live in a culture which has inherited these myths and it's necessary to destroy them, lessen them to the human dimension. It's  an arrangement' s count with my natural heritage. I don't accept the fairy tales, the idea of the fate. I introduce the myth in the politic reality and that becomes history in a very different dimension. It's not an interpretation. I confer a dimension at the level of the man, due he is who makes the history, not the myth.""

Silence of God, understood as the silence of the own origins. Voula and Alexandros, two brothers who desperately undertake a journey in search of an impossible and unattainable father, conceived as father, memory, origin and history.

Once more, we assist to the main concernments of this superb filmmaker, the return to historical references. Germany is then, a simple reference pattern, it's the trip what it really maters, with all the painful implications, risks and hazardous consequences this fact brings with it. Like exiled angels, they suffer in silence in an indifferent world that does not care the death of a horse in the middle of the night.  And Orestes, the sole human being who really loves them, works out as the inspiring hero, who (casually ?) expresses the most pyramidal poetic moments of the movie.

The final sequence, (as a posthumous homage in Andrei Tarkovsky' s memory) when the midst vanishes is one of the most extraordinary dazzling moments in the whole history of the cinema. The countless poetic sequences are by themselves far enough to acquire this supreme masterpiece, but more important still; the way the director handles the filmic time transmuting into mythical time, with frozen human bodies when the snows falls, obligates us to rethink over and over the transcendental artistic importance of this giant film, that must be included among the best films ever made.

Extraordinary achievement. A must-have.

Because the poetry is timeless.",1167782400,5,2550,4.8842592592592595
8068281,5,B0009WIE7U,"I agree with a previous reviewer  that the transfer of the film on this DVD is an abomination.

The greek company NewStar is releasing (authorized  by Angelopoulos) excellent transfers of

his films, including Landscape in the Mist, with english subtitles.",1163462400,15,256,5.325
8068282,3,B0009WIE7U,"I have been waiting for years for this extraordinary, beautiful film to come out on DVD.  The film itself easily rates five stars, or more.  But, sadly, not this DVD.  The old New Yorker video was woefully inadequate.  Unfortunately, New Yorker seems to have done nothing more than transfer the video onto DVD.  The ratios are clearly off and the picture quality is very poor.  Even the subtitles are ugly.  There are no extras worth mentioning (scene selection, if you want to count that.) This is a travesty against one of the greatest cinematic artists of our time.  Criterion, are you listening???

Since there are no other available forms, by all means watch the DVD or the video.  Just be aware that you are not seeing the work as it was intended by the artist, Theo Angelopoulos--alas, better a poor copy than nothing at all.  But hopefully, when Artificial Eye in the UK finally gets around to bringing out their version, they will do more justice to the film.",1133395200,45,968,4.668639053254438
8068283,2,B0009WIE7U,"there is a part in this film where the characters find a strip of film in a trash can. one of the characters (orestes) holds this piece of film up to the light. the two children, alexander and voula, crowd around to see what's printed on the film.  ""don't you see, through the mist, the tree?"" orestes asks. the children cannot see anything, and orestes admits that he was joking. there is nothing printed on the film, just transparency.
that is a pretty good example of how i felt watching the movie. there is something about the film that makes you take notice, asks you to try to interpret the symbolism, strain to involve yourself in its landscape. but there's nothing there, you'd have to invent it. whoever thought that one could wring emotional poignancy out of antonioni's model of long, static takes, subverted plot expectations and inexpressive characters must be seriously disturbed. in antonioni, this format works because he is dealing with emptiness and emotional paucity, in the disconnection between individuals and classes. antonioni doesn't ask you to interpret this behavior, because human life and the natural world are too complex and spontaneous for complete understanding. we don't have an emotional attachment in the characters, but we are glad, because antonioni lets us observe them so clearly, and we come out with a great deal having been learned.
in this film, angelopoulos dares to ask us to try to bridge the gap, to really put in an emotional investment in these characters, although they are just as inexpressive and inscrutable as the characters in antonioni. if he had either played with this investment, and robbed the viewer of the satisfaction of the conclusion of their journey, making the film's ambiguity more intentional and clear, or if he had fully integrated us into their suffering, by giving these characters more to do than look at scenery and read unremarkable, ""poetic"" voiceovers, then the film could possibly have succeeded in its confines as a metaphysical, avant-garde road film. as it is, the film seems unintentionally ambiguous and underdeveloped. angelopoulos tries to distance us and integrate us at the same time, forcing us to take pity on these miserable children while not giving us any credible shred of their motivation. furthermore, he tries to involve us emotionally in this way by employing a grotesque and overbearing level of symbolism, which to some might seem like genius, but to me seems like a bit of a strain on the already rickety narrative. the last sequence, for example, visually plays on the dynamic of dark/light that has been a motif in the film. as the characters cross the border of germany, they move from black night to a misty, pure-white day. ""first there was darkness, then there was light"". this sequence emphatically insists on this type of bland binary division between innocence and guilt, childhood and maturity, good and evil. this is reflected in the integration of the symbolism: scenes of narrative, sudden intrusion of overbearing symbolic interlude, resumption of narrative as if nothing had happened. two types of scenes make up this film, making it as if the characters are not allowed to react to the world around them, just to ""play their part"", making the audience ""laugh...or cry"", as orestes describes his role. sure, but isn't possible to do both at the same time? (for example, the films of david lynch, kusturica's ""underground"", fellini, altman, imamura, and other filmmakers who can explore the middle grounds of desire, society, morality and politics).
what results is a film that might have resulted from a script written by antonioni, rewritten by fellini and then directed by bresson. in other words, it's a totally conflicted, overwrought film torn between two extreme poles of existence, with no comfortable middle ground that could engage us either as viewers or as interpreters. the symbolic nature of the work insists on interpretation, and it can draw you into to its complexity, but i don't think it offers any real, consistent emotional or political outlook (besides bleakness and despair, that is). skip this and watch ""spirit of the beehive"", the best film about children, politics, and family ever made.",1028505600,15,4230,5.060171919770774

8068285,5,B0009WIE7U,"It is hard to explain why I like this movie so much. I think the best way to describe it is that it speaks to my soul, more than any other movie. The film operates on many levels (see Robert Horton's excellent books on  Angelopoulos to explore further) such as Greek mythology, modern Greek  history, the issues of borders, innocence and growing up, male role models,  etc. However, the real power of the movie, I feel, lies in its ability to  transport you to a place where the hidden truths of life, those truths that  lie under the surface of our every day existence, are openly displayed and  heartbreakingly rendered on screen. I think many independent film fans,  especially in the US look for films that are realistic. This film is not  realistic in the traditional sense, but it arrives at the core of our  existence in a poetic way, and in a way that many people mistake for  pretentiousness, false symbolism, and unnecessary artiness. The movie  speaks volumes to me, and I hope it does to you too.",954460800,45,1008,4.575418994413408
