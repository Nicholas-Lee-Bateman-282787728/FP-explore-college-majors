8595023,4,B00DNJL1FS,"I have a region-free portable DVD player, but have not yet bought this Region 2 DVD. This movie, also know as Affair in the Snow, needs very badly to be released on U.S. format DVD (NTSC Region 1) with English and possibly other subtitles. It was briefly available on YouTube, with the English subtitles, but then was yanked. The love-triangle story is sufficiently interesting, but what is great is the black-and-white cinematography. It's almost as if, say, the cameraman was Ansel Adams.",1442793600,,490,4.987804878048781
