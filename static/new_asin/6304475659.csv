Hercules is constantly pursued by Zeus' wife Hera, a goddess with immense power that Hercules is able to outwit. She seeks revenge against Hercules for her husband's past sexual adventure. Zeus acts in this series as an immature but likeable human. His son Hercules is more mature.

 This film has several plot lines. Hercules is married and has children, but his wife is unsure that he will remain faithful. She hands him a coat - which, unbeknown to her, was sent by Hera. She thinks it will assure Hercules' love, but it is poisoned. The earth opens up in an area far from Hercules' home and emits fumes that kill many village inhabitants. The villagers try sacrifices, but they do not help. The villagers then send a beautiful girl to Hercules to seduce him to rush and help them. Hercules descends the hole to the world of the dead. His wife thinks that he died and falls off a cliff. Hercules wants to rescue her from the land of the dead. He needs to outwit the god of the dead to do so.",1296518400,2,1089,4.3861386138613865

They neglected ever releasing ""Circle of Fire"" and ""Hercules in the Under World"".  As  an added bonus for the DVD feature, I say they should put ""Mazo of the  Menatour""  I have VHS version but would love to have it on DVD.",948585600,3,332,4.360655737704918
