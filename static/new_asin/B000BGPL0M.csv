8086473,4,B000BGPL0M,"I agree with the first review of this DVD set that you should start with the other DVDs in this series because this DVD set is not for beginners.  I have the Homespun Acoustic Blues DVD set and Happy's Guitar Building Blocks set that includes lessons on bass runs, fingerpicking and barre chords. I highly recommend the Blocks set for beginner players. That being said, Happy does another great job teaching techniques such as bass runs, sliding chord shapes up and down the neck, fingerpicking techniques and other embellishments so that you aren't simply strumming these blues songs that basically have easy chords.  This set will help you get to the next level of acoustic blues, not for just the songs he selected, but in general.  It's another winner from Homespun.",1334275200,,770,4.862595419847328
8086474,5,B000BGPL0M,"This is one of Happy Traums older videos but I like Homespun tapes and already had the newer version so I fiqured what the heck. Great video not as informant as the newer ones but works great once you master them. If you like old blues, the true blues this is a great video to have. Blues players no that the older you get the less fancy you play, no more lightin riff just deep hearted pickin and this video has it. If you like the true blues then do yourself a favor and pick this up. You can always resell it if you don't like it but I don't think that will be the case",1289520000,,572,3.939655172413793
8086475,5,B000BGPL0M,"If you love acoustic blues, or if you are an acoustic guitarist who would LOVE to learn to play acoustic blues, this DVD is a valuable part of your lessons.

Wisely, Homespun has set for an entire course to bring you through months and months of lessons, via DVD, to teach you acoustic blues.  I love taking these courses because Homespun uses two images on the DVD, right and left hand, move very slowly, but also give you not only what a finished product could look like, but encourage you to explore and develop your own style.  Here is the course, from start to finish:

1.  Easy Steps to Blues Guitar DVD 1 and 2.

2.  The Blues Bag 2 DVD set (learning more songs!)

3.  Easy Steps to Blues Guitar Jamming DVD 1 and 2

4.  The Fingerpicking Blues of Mississippi John Hurt

(all these are here at Amazon)

This is a course of months of learning, depending upon what level you are at, but ends up at some high level guitar playing!  What is fun about The Blues Bag is that you can slowly learn a song, and then play it completely----but, if you are a more advanced player, there is SO much more you can do with it (as the DVDs show).

This is like a college syllabus of blues guitar 101 through graduation!  The first DVD introduced me to the blues on acoustic guitar, was easy to use, and a lot of fun.  DVD began the challenge.  Bag of Blues is like having the reward of applying what you've learned.

best advice:  get the entire course, A-Z, and enjoy!  I've not found a better production anywhere.",1180656000,11,1505,4.303571428571429
