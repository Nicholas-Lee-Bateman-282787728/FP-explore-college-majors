2143482,4,B0002Y4PPK,"I chose the opening lyrics to Duran Duran's ""Still Breathing"" for the title of this review because this film is about finding, defining and redefining family and home. This is a very complicated story of three people that love each other deeply but cannot cope emotionally with the love triangle the made their very love for each other possible.

What I love about this film is that it reaffirms the concept that family is not something you are necessarily born into. We choose our families and we choose where we call ""home"". Some families might not be traditional or conventional but they are 100% real and valid to those that have them. In the end, that's what really matters; what's real and valid to YOU.

Very sweet film and I highly recommend it.",1099785600,6,753,4.654135338345864
2143483,2,B0002Y4PPK,"This movie had potential but come on don't make Colin Farrell gay. I liked the senstive side but the kissing and fondling as an adult was a bit much. If you are a huge Colin Farrel fan don't watch this one. The movie would have been better if the friend was gay and Colin wasn't and the ending what a rip off, the girl leaves with the kid and doesn't come back. This wasn't one of the better Farrell moives.",1099785600,2,407,4.1
2143484,5,B0002Y4PPK,"I was so amazed that Colin Farrell could act in such a movie.  it was so moving, and he helped make the movie that much better.  What a touching story, so real and heartbreaking for him as a child to have so much loss, and experience such confusing times with his very best friend.  In the end it resulted in him becoming this wonderful loving, caring adult that you can't help but love.  I cried at the end for his character the most, with Clare and Rebecca gone, and Jonathon ailing, I cried for what would be his life afterwards...... A definite keeper.....",1099785600,3,560,4.407766990291262
2143485,5,B0002Y4PPK,"Something happened to me yesterday. Something I was surprised to experience for the second time in recent years. I saw this film, a film I had heard , but never really new the subject of. I was sitting there, in my living room, absorbed by the intense truth of A Home At The End Of The World.

  What pulled me in was not the plot or the gimmics used to draw the viewer in, this is not the case of this film, but the complexity, the humanity and the love that came out, that transcended the screen and reached my soul, my heart so profoundly that this morning I found myself walking around in my appartment still feeling the emotions, the attachment, the pain, the love and the lives of the three people  I came to know.

  The story, as most of you probably know by now, centers around three people (from the sixties through the eighties) and the relationship they form together, the complexity of their souls and their need for the other two. And that's what's so poignant here : their need, especially Bobby's need to feel that everyone around him is happy and well. Each one of these three need something from the other. It can be Bobby's fear of being alone, Clare's need for some sort of stability or Jonathan's need of being the most important person in someone's life.

  So when the end of this film comes and Bobby, Jonathan and Clare have all faced life changing obstacles, accidents, and quiet moments, a decision needs to be make by Bobby. A decision that is both easy and hurtful for him and Clare because she has to make her own decision and does not know the reason behind his response. So when the small layers of personality that were handed to us about these people throughout the film form this deeper moment than what it could have been in a lesser story,film, as a viewer you sort of become one of these people,  the fourth player.

  At least that is what happened to me. A sort of revelation of what cinema can still be in our contemporary time,an experience that matches only my viewing of Almost Famous. Less an explosive spectacle than a life changing, soul refining, mind stopping instant in which I discover new people. There are no life lessons in this film I feel, only human truths and revelations about specific individuals.",1099785600,14,2257,4.5
2143486,4,B0002Y4PPK,"I really enjoyed this film.  I am a true Colin fan and I thought he was great as Bobby.  Seems to me though, I remember reading a review of this film before it was released on DVD and swear it said Colin would appear in full frontal nudity.  The review said the sight of Colin so startled the audience (if you know what I mean?) that the scene was cut from the theatrical release but would be on the DVD.  I have pretty good eye sight but I didn't see it.  Something was missing.",1099699200,6,479,4.053191489361702
2143487,5,B0002Y4PPK,"""Home At the End of the World"" is a wonderfully made film released in 2004 starring Colin Farrell, Robin Wright Penn, Dallas Roberts, and Oscar winner Sissy Spacek.  This adaption from the novel of the same name by Michael Cunningham (who also wrote this screenplay) beautifully shares the friendship of three individuals Bobby, Jonathan, and Clare, two of whom were high school friends and later reunite.  The two shared a closeness like few other friendships.  As love blossoms between Bobby and Clare certain people, the three become family.  All three from different backgrounds strive for their needed family love.

These chain of events beautifully blend to one another.  Meanwhile, the emotional value remains within every character and every scene.  Cunningham, also author of ""The Hours"", clearly understands the inner human needs for everyday living.  The deep intents of the events carry themselves to further emotional stance as it explores the characters' painful pasts.  The sense of loss, sadness, and yearning are always expressed through their life journeys.  The intensity presents itself strongly, especially through events that threaten to break the bond.  Meanwhile, the designers wonderfully recreated the 1960's, the 1970's, and the 1980's through the backgrounds and the wardrobes.

The actors give strong performances, especially Farrell and Spacek.  Farrell breaks from his signature ""tough guy"" roles for a deep, dramatic film that proves him more as a serious actor.  His emotional value is expressed beautifully, namely through the crying scene.  Therefore, he proves himself as more than a sex symbol.  Words cannot express the highly talented Sissy Spacek.  As in every film in her thirty-year career, she continues to amaze.  All other actors offer their own emotional expression that adds to the passionate standpoint.

""Home At the End of the World"" is a great film that will keep audiences watching closely.  Due to the deep, numerous details in this film, many must watch this multiple times to fully understand.  Many will be glad afterwards.  Those wanting to explore more of Michael Cunningham's work should also watch ""The Hours"".",1099699200,4,2170,5.3579881656804735
2143488,4,B0002Y4PPK,"Here's another DVD I'll definitely be buying when it comes out later this year.  ""A Home at the end of the World"" is one of the most frustrating, yet also one of the most rewarding, films I've seen in a while.  Fright wigs aside, it does a masterful job of evoking the late `60s in America.  People have a habit of dying around 14-year-old Bobby Morrow: first his brother (in the film's most visually arresting scene), then his mother, and then his father.  This sets up a situation wherein Bobby must move in with the family of his best friend from school, Jonathan Glover.  When the two boys sleep together, even before Bobby moves in permanently, Jonathan puts the moves on him, and, wondrously, Bobby gets involved.  The two are inseparable until Jonathan's mother (played by the luminous Sissy Spacek) discovers them in a VW together and Jonathan pulls away from Bobby.  Jonathan ultimately moves to New York, but Bobby stays behind with the Glovers, until, eight years later, daddy Glover decides that it's time Bobby move out on his own.  Bobby follows Jonathan to New York, only to be rejected once again by his childhood friend, at which point he turns to Jonathan's roommate, the free-spirited Clare, for solace.  What follows is fairly predictable if you've seen any movies about gay relationships in the late seventies and early eighties, but the part that rings true is the self-destructive relationship between the male leads.  Jonathan wants no one but Bobby, but can't appreciate that he already has him.  Bobby wants Jonathan, but is willing to ""settle"" for a relationship with Clare, especially when it comes with the promise of a family and a child.  Jonathan throws himself into a promiscuous lifestyle and pays the price all movie homosexuals must pay for sleeping around.  But Bobby is still there.  And the question becomes, why?  Is Bobby fundamentally gay or bi or neuter?  Does it matter?  Bobby, as played by Colin Farrell, is infinitely vulnerable (his younger avatar, Eric Smith, seems much more of an adult than the childlike Farrell); Bobby just wants a family.  He loves the people who are willing to fill that void in his life.  These include Jonathan, Clare, their daughter, and the Glovers.  His pansexuality is a product of need.  I kind of like this concept.  Before Oscar Wilde, people for the most part had sex.  They didn't worry about labels, because the labels didn't exist.  Sodomy was a behavior disapproved of by the church, but the implication is that people engaged in it anyway.  So who were these sodomites?  They were probably people like Bobby, who were just looking for love.  It's the Jonathans of this world who need the labels, and it's the labels that lead to heartbreak.  Thanks are due to novelist and screenwriter Michael (""The Hours"") Cunningham for reminding us of this basic fact.  Further kudos are due to a soundtrack that includes Laura Nyro, Leonard Cohen, and Dusty Springfield.",1094947200,206,2945,4.869215291750503
2143499,4,B0002Y4PPK,"This is a beautifully-acted film telling a truly unique story, despite the somewhat scattered execution of the plot. Portrayals of bisexual men are woefully few and far between. On top of that, this film shows a believable--and, overall, positive--portrayal of a polyamorous relationship, even rarer in mainstream film. Colin Farrell and Sissy Spacek shine particularly brightly in roles unlike the ones they're usually given. The film would've been a clear five-star with just another few revisions to tighten up the script. The multiple temporal settings may have worked in the novel, but the adaptation should have tried to streamline these characters' histories a bit more.",1494720000,3,677,5.457142857142857

2143508,4,B0002Y4PPK,"This sweet film reminds one of Threesome (1994), in which two men (Josh Charles and Stephen Baldwin) find themselves in a roommate situation with one woman (Lara Flynn Boyle), and this trio becomes a single unit in love and sex. A Home at the End of the World arrives at that same juncture, though from totally different circumstance, originating with the long term love affair between two teen boys, Bobby and Jonathan (played later in life by Colin Farrell and Dallas Roberts), which extends into adulthood with the addition of Claire (Robin Wright), a love interest for both men, resulting in a daughter with two fathers. Jonathans amazingly understanding mother is played beautifully in every sense of the word by Sissy Spacek

I say sweet because the story is plausible and enjoyable all the way through, depicting human nature much as the world has come to accept it these days. Robin Wright is a delight, far from her current matter-of-fact incarnation as Claire Underwood, the nations First Lady in Netflix House of Cards.

2143527,4,B0002Y4PPK,"Colin Farrell plays Bobby who, at the age of 24, loses his virginity with Clare.  It is truly entertaining to watch (his?) sweet innocence acted out.  He's nervous and so cute!  I'd rather watch this over his amateur sex tape, which really just makes him appear to be just another guy or man.  (Maybe a professionally shot sex tape would have kept his ""star quality""!  For real!) Back to the movie . . .

The kissing, dancing, etc. between Bobby and Jonathan seem more affectionate than the same actions between paired men and women actors like in Tom Hank's ""Philadelphia"", in Russell Crowe's ""The Sum of Us"" and in ""Brokeback Mountain"". Maybe the element of ""it's just pretend"" that makes it seem more affectionate in a movie venue.

Bobby has such big heart that the end of the story is sad.  Bobby is a genuine good sole.  Bobby repays the help Jonathan extended to him when he had no where to live by taking care of his friend when Jonathan found himself at the end of the world.",1428883200,3,984,4.48314606741573

  ""This whole big beautiful noisy world and everything that can happen."" This is Bobby's (played by Colin Farrell) expression of what people should expect from life, and this movie delivers a big slice of that.  Others have described the plot in detail. I will only second the majority opinion that the writing, directing, and acting are all first rate. Some have criticized the movie for being slow moving. Basing a movie on the complex constellation of hopes, needs, fears, and situations that we all experience, and that change over years, just takes more time than an action-filled movie. All the actors do an outstanding job of expressing these feelings and do it without the ""drama"" that so often substitutes for nuanced acting.
  It has been some years since the movie was released (2007), and some of the early reviews sound a bit dated. Unconventional living arrangements are not especially rare in 2014, although finding three people that love each other so completely in such differing ways is rare.  It was probably always sure to become unstable.  The homosexual content of the movie is minimal and brief, and it is limited to what is needed to explain interpersonal relationships and how the movie ends. This movie will take you from bliss to despair and from hope to resignation more than once. The movie could have had an unconvincing happy-ever-after ending but chose reality. Bobby will find the only situation that he truly fears: being alone.  Beautifully made, understated, but true to life. You will want to watch this one more than once.",1419465600,2,1738,5.360294117647059

There are parts in this film that hurt very much due to my memories.  I think that is why I can identify so well with Collin's character.  A lot of this film was ""Deja Vue"" for me, especially.

2143594,5,B0002Y4PPK,"This movie made me think, laugh and cry over and over. I've had it for a couple of years now and pulled it out to watch again last night after a while of not seeing it. What a marvelous experience it is! Colin Farrell's character was interesting. He took on sort of a free spirit type thanks to his loving and open older brother who molds him in the beginning of the movie with his small role. Early on Bobby loses all of his family and has to live with a friend. What he learned from his brother he passes onto everyone else. There are a couple of scenes where he and his new found friend, Johnathan smoke weed as teenagers while listening to some awesome music. And speaking of the music it's pretty fantastic in this movie! Some of the tunes are older like the Laura Nyro ones but there are newer tunes from the 90s too such as the exclusive-to-the-soundtrack-tunes by singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik.

Bobby is really outgoing as a kid but he's a mixture of introvert and extrovert as an adult I found. He acts coy in many a scene but during the tender moments of dancing with another character like Johnathan or Johnathan's mother he comes to life. Johnathan's character is more to the shy and quiet side definitely in his childhood and I would say he's just kind of the private type as he grows older. There are a few secrets he tries to keep during this movie. I think this movie is ultimately about the bond of friendship and new beginnings. Bobby and Johnathan more or less share a close friendship throughout the entire movie, Johnathan's family move from the city to a more relaxed place in Phoenix to start over and Johnathan, Bobby and Clair, the interesting free bird in the story who is friends with Johnathan, move from New York City to a house in the country to raise her and Bobby's first and only child. Just for a heads up if you don't know by now this movie has a couple of gay-themed occurrences in it. I don't mind that and actually it was probably one of the reasons I decided to get the movie after my first watch. But I thought I'd warn you in case you're not keen on that type of stuff.

This is definitely a movie to experience though. It had me feeling all types of emotions throughout and I'm glad I can say that I own it.

2143598,5,B0002Y4PPK,"The most frustrating, exhilarating and disquieting gay film I have seen... so far.

Bobby is marked by death and ends up a young teenager with no family at all. He is adopted by the family of his best friend, Jonathan, with whom he had had some physical contact like most boys do. Their closeness can grow little by little but the two young men are so different that there is a chasm between their desire for mutual love.

Bobby remains with his adoptive family and becomes a baker. Jonathan moves to New York to study at first but on the wrong motivation actually. His main character is that of a shy person who runs away as soon as someone has the slightest ever glimpse on his deeper and private life he wants to keep a secret. He is phenomenally in love with Bobby but cannot admit it in public. He ran when his own mother discovered the two of them on the point of kissing and a little bit more in their car. The mother would not even have protested but Jonathan got scared.

When Bobby's adoptive family decides to move to Arizona in their older age Bobby asks Jonathan if he can join him in New York. Jonathan adores the idea and invites him over and there Bobby discovers Clare, the woman Jonathan is in love with and who is in love with him. Her only dream, after her divorce, is to get a child. So they start a mnage--trois and it could work well provided Jonathan accepted the idea of having a love relation with Bobby under Clare's accepting eye.

The rest will be your discovery as for the details.

But the film is very surprising and very sad in many ways. Clare will eventually leave with the daughter Rebecca one day insistently asking the father of the child if he wants to come along. He refuses to stay with the other man and finally realize, alone together, their life long love affair under no scrutinizing eye at all.

That's absolutely fascinating: the shyness, the modesty, the shame and the shamelessness, the desire and the fear, the need to escape and the attraction in that gay couple that could live their passion along with Clare but one of the two cannot relax enough to do that. It is sorrowful to see how the woman and mother of the child accepts without actually saying so to move away with the child to let the two men free to live there love. And we are definitely saddened by the fact that this gay love affair that everyone accepts cannot be lived through without the two men being deprived of their own child, the woman they both love and who loves them both.

Saddening and so beautiful for these two men to live in the dream and promise that one day the daughter will come back to inherit their beautiful house, their land and their business though that would be after an event they don't even identify but is highly probably death. For the meantime let them redecorate the girl's room for when she comes as an adult.

You can't even cry on such a film. It is pure torture of the heart, the mind and anything reasonable in you. And that's the beauty of it.

Thanx to the cast I never felt like taking a break while watching it. Robyn Wright and Dallas Roberts are great, Colin Farrell (although I am not so fond of him) delivers impressive performance as adult Bobby.

In fact, this is an entirely satisfying film with a great cast and moving story. It is probably the Colin Farrell's best role - it shows what a well-rounded and sincere actor he can be, rather than the Russell Crowe clone he sometimes threatens to become.  Dallas Roberts is an actor I didn't know before this film, but he bonds with Farrell beautifully.  Another actor I didn't know is Ryan Donowho, who I believe went on to score a part in
The O.C.  I also see that he is an inveterate musician, playing the drums and playing the bucket in Manhattan subways! Once upon a time! He has a really infectious part as (Colin Farrell's teenaged) elder brother before meeting an untimely end - he is an actor to watch.

2143623,5,B0002Y4PPK,"A Home At The End Of The World caught my attention and never let it go until the end. This film packs an emotional wallop and there's some mighty fine acting by a talented cast. The script doesn't lack much, either; and the casting was very well done. The cinematography shines especially bright in the upstate New York scenes and the choreography is very impressive. I especially like the character development that takes place over time.

When the action starts we meet nine year old Bobby Morrow (Andrew Chalmers) who clearly has a warm relationship with his older brother Carlton (Ryan Donowho). Unfortunately, Carlton is killed suddenly in a very tragic accident and thus begins the long chain of events that leave Bobby Morrow without parents or any siblings in this world. By the time Bobby is a teenager, he is essentially adopted by the family of his friend Jonathan Glover (Harris Allan). Jonathan has his eyes on Bobby; and Bobby seems to enjoy spending romantic time with Jonathan as well. Look also for a brilliant performance by Sissy Spacek as Jonathan's mother Alice.

After a few years, Jonathan heads to New York by himself. When Bobby (now played by Collin Farrell) turns twenty-four, he also moves to New York after Jonathan's father tells Bobby to spread his wings and fly. Twenty-four year old Jonathan (now played by Dallas Roberts) welcomes Bobby--and so does Jonathan's roommate and platonic girlfriend Clare (Robin Wright Penn).

It isn't long, however, before we see complications. Although Jonathan truly still loves Bobby deep down; Bobby falls in love with Clare and Clare feels the same way about Bobby. At this point the movie delves into the dynamics of a three way relationship with love at varying levels as a year or two more pass by. In addition, Jonathan isn't exactly ""saving himself"" for Bobby; he often spends time alone with other men he's just met.

When Clare is pregnant with Bobby's child, the threesome decides to buy a house in Woodstock, New York (they figure it won't be too much unlike Greenwich Village where they have been living) and soon Rebecca is born. All through this time we see more developments in Jonathan's family; and that adds to the richness of the picture.

Of course, from here the plot can go just about anywhere. What happens after they move to Woodstock? How will Clare, who loves the city a great deal, adjust to Woodstock in the countryside? What about Bobby and Jonathan--how does their relationship play out? And what happens after they open a small restaurant--will it be a success? Watch and find out!

The DVD has a bonus about the film featuring comments by director Michael Mayer and the principle actors in the cast. There's the theatrical trailer as well.

A Home At The End Of The World dares to explore subject matter that isn't exactly mainstream; but I admire their bravery and they pull this off in very good taste. This is also a sophisticated, honest look at the fluidity of human romantic preferences that can take place in life. It also showcases the story of three people searching for their own homes and families outside of the family into which they were born.

Well, after watching it last night I've come to believe that the critic's got it right.  There is just something very wrong with this movie; something I'm not sure I can really put my finger on, but it's something that drives me far away from the film.  One thing I can put my finger on is Colin Farrell's horrific performance.  I'll get to that in a minute.

The film revolves around Bobby Morrow who at a young age loses everything that would constitute a `home' in his eyes.  His brother dies in a strange accident, his mother dies and then his father passes away all by the time Bobby is in his early teens.  With everything falling apart around him he finds some sort of stability within a friendship with Jonathon Glover and his family.  Jonathan is, without question, interested in Bobby as much more than a friend, and Bobby isn't necessarily apposed to the idea.  After they are caught exploring their friendship by Jonathan's mother their friendship is strained.  We then see them again eight years later when Jonathan's parents are preparing to move leaving Bobby without a home once again.  He calls up Jonathan who had moved away some time ago and moves in with him.  Bobby begins an affair with Jonathan's roommate Clare much to Jonathan's disapproval and this causes many shifts within everyone relationship with one another.

The film could have had a unique feel to it but instead comes off overdone and tired.  Nothing new is really explored, and when anything `fresh' comes up across the horizon bad acting and or pure stupidity seem to muddle everything.

Dallas Roberts tries hard to breathe sympathy into Jonathan but he comes off whiny and spoiled, very unsympathetic indeed.  Robin Wright Penn comes off as just plain strange, intriguing but maybe to a fault.  I found myself contemplating her actions and in the end chalking them up to pure stupidity which left me cold towards her character. This leaves us Colin Farrell who plays Bobby as if he were mentally slow.  Watching him stare off into the distance is painful because his eyes look empty as apposed to full of wonderment.  I got no sense of this man aside from naivety.  His performance was torturous to watch, and I'm one who lauded his turn in `Alexander' so I'm far from a Farrell hater.  In fact, the only performance that I admired was that of Sissy Spacek who once again proves that she is a masterful actress who can even elevate the dullest of material.

In the end I was very unimpressed with `A Home at the End of the World'; a film I was hoping would grip me.  It has potential but in the end it squanders all potential and delivers a film that is nothing more than mediocre, maybe even less than that.",1200268800,,2861,4.588582677165355
2143642,4,B0002Y4PPK,"As implied by my review title, there are times I wish dialogue or direction had made some things clearer. The ending was somewhat confusing and I'd have appreciated more clarity re: how the Colin F. character felt about the Robin Wright Penn character.  And while I understand that part of this is about how the Colin F. character was written (a somewhat directionless drifter in need of love/family), there are times he could have shown more/the part might have been better-served by a more evocative actor. I sometimes found it hard to identify with the feelings of his lifelong friend, especially in the family scenes, the latter came across as rather a selfish brat. But there's much that's wonderful about this film, starting with the inclusion of unusual music, like one of the best of the era (the '70s), Laura Nyro, especially as used in the first scene with one of her songs - it's incredibly touching, funny, and surprising. Sissy Spacek's performance is marvellous. Wright Penn's character is somehow annoying (part of which is the hair) but the depiction of the early-mid-'80s Village (I was there) is mostly spot-on, as is the love letter to the Catskills, especially when, in a way, the Band is included!

2143660,2,B0002Y4PPK,"There is an old saying, if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all. But I feel compelled to critique this film, partly because I really liked what I think it was trying to say... Follow your heart, not what's necessarily popular, follow a Bohemian lifestyle if that what makes you happy. O.K.

This film instead comes across as one produced by a major corporation to get us all thinking about heading back home to the suburbs. Because really what it's saying is even if you have all the idealism in the world, it will only land you in a ghost of a town like Woodstock, N.Y., full of self doubt, and hypocritical trappings.

First of all the acting was not bad, I have no issues with the acting. In fact along with the other fine actors in this film, Colin Farrell should be angry. Their true abilities in developing characterization seem to be written, directed, and edited right out of this film. There is little or no subjective viewpoint from these characters lives. The viewer is left on the outside looking in, wondering where these characters are coming from, or what they are motivated by. This film forces us to assume everything in order to believe anything, without dramatizing or exemplifying why these characters feel the way they do. The effect is clear, as the screen-writer and director have apparently anesthetized these characters into poseurs and masked sterotypes; the only thing left to be certain, the only thing that can be derived, is that they truly do believe in hair color, haircuts, and one-night stands.

""A home at the end of the world,"" wants us to believe it's making a liberal statement, wants us to swallow the whole enchilida. By using home as a metaphor and a terminal disease to create sympathy for itself, what this film really does is lead us down the road with good intentions to a home decorated in bad taste.",1152057600,7,1858,4.658536585365853

2143663,4,B0002Y4PPK,"This is an enjoyable film, even if there is an atmosphere of quiet sadness that runs throughout the entire script from the early scenes of a 9 year old on LSD in a graveyard to the final scenes of a distant farmhouse in upstate New York.

This film has multiple strengths; (1) coherent themes about recovering from loss, the structure of family, and self-identity and abadonment of social structures to meet personal needs; (2) excellent characterization by a great cast; (3) wonderful ability to establish a time and place using clothes, expressions, but primarily with music.

Michael Cunningham, in both this work and in The Hours, teaches us lessons about the necessity of loss to human life and the need to recover from the losses and maybe even triumph, or at least not allow loss to defeat us. The character of Bobby, played by Colin Farrell, is such a character. He loses his beloved 19 year older brother, then his mother, and finally his father all before finishing high school. Yet, his need for intimacy, for family, allows him to integrate into the home of his best friend, Jonathan Glover, becoming a second child to the Glover family. Bobby retains the ability to recover from loss, converting the pain into joyful existence, even as he loses Claire and baby Rachel and faces the fact that he will even lose Jonathan to AIDS. In an early scene  he sits in a graveyard with his friend Jonathan, near the graves of his parents and older brother and tell Jonathan not be be disturbed because ""the dead are people too.""

A second theme to the film is the comparison of one character who decides to take on a gay identity, Jonathan, and become integrated into the gay life of NYC in the early 1980s, with another character, Bobby.  For Bobby, who is really beyond bi-sexual and might best be described as pan-sexual, sexuality becoming a path toward belonging, intimacy, and a way to meet dependency needs. Bobby does not define himself and thus is free to experience a range of relationships and emotions that strict self definition would restrict.

A third theme is that of constructed family or alternative family, where needs are met, rules and patterns are established, roles and responsibilities are distributed, and constant adjustments must be made since society does not define what is right or wrong. These families require lots of work, especially when three adults are in the relationship. In a unique plot twist, it is not the characters who are having the most heterosexual sex and who have a child who begin to edge out the gay character. It is the odd wander-lust of Claire that eventually breaks up the threesome.

Beyond these 3 themes, the characterization was superb. Colin Farrell did such a great job in Minority Report, that this was one of the reasons I bought this film.  Any male star who can hold his own in a film in which the male lead is Tom Cruise, has something going for him. He plays the sweetness and transparency and vulnerability of Bobby with childlike innocence and dependency. Robin Wright Penn and Dallas Roberts are both excellent but Sissy Spacek as Mrs. Alice Glover, Jonathan's mother, does a fantastic job of demonstrating how a character can abadone social roles and expectations to be genuine, to be a real person. It is her son Jonathan who is most uncomfortable with his mother smoking pot and discovering Bobby and Jonathan mutually masturbating.

Finally, the use of music by The Band, Jefferson Airplane, Dusty Springfield, Leonard Cohen, and Laura Nyro continually give the film a sense of time and place, helping us understand Jonathan's sexuality and his AIDS symptoms.

Excellent! You will be moved.",1146355200,11,3666,4.8512
2143664,4,B0002Y4PPK,"If you want to see how sweet and vulnerable, and what a fine actor, Colin Farrell really can be, just watch the scene where he confesses he's ""never done this before"" to Clare.

2143668,4,B0002Y4PPK,"This is a nice little film that comes out of left field.  It will appeal to you if you are something of a 'dreamer'.

The film opens with a series of scenes that are almost groaners. Situations develop, and you think, ""oh my God, they aren't going to do what I think they're going to do..."", and almost invariably they do exactly that.  A boy gives his 9 year old brother a tab of acid.  A few years later, Bobby, the younger boy, engages in homosexual masturbation with a friend. These scenes are a bit telegraphed, but still shocking. The only taboo that the film declined was an older woman/young boy relationship between Bobby and Sissy Spacek as the friend's mother.

The film as a whole presents a rather romanticized,""pie-in-the-sky"" view of the 1960's and 70's.  But the cast does a good job, and the film moves along quickly, providing a plot that is emotionally satisfying even as it challenges your notions of morality.

The character of Bobby ( played by Colin Farrell ) seems roughly analogous to Billy Crudup's character in the movie, ""Jesus' Son"", although that film is spiced by more humor and even more chaos.  Both Farrell and Crudup seem to be playing variations on the 'Fool of God' in characters that are preposterously innocent and/or stupid.

This movie also made me reflect on Paul Mazursky's ""Willie and Phil""--which also chronicled the 70's through the device of a menage a trois.

Surely one of the stars I give this film is dedicated to its use of Laura Nyro in the soundtrack--which definitely helped make me feel more predisposed toward judging it favorably!",1134691200,7,1588,4.741818181818182

When I first bought the movie, it was shortly after I read the book and I hated it.  I only watched the first hour then shut it off because much of the film is different than the actual story.  Though after I few months, I decided to watch the film again, and did not have the book as fresh in my mind, and I really enjoyed it.  There are still considerable flaws with the film.

While the movie began I was captivated by the bizarre suburban Cleveland neighborhood the screenplay delineated, and when the boys became teens and Bobby befriended the nerdy Jonathan in high school, well, for one thing you couldn't take your eyes off how bad little Bobby's wig was, but on the other they definitely had some sparks between them, and the scenes where the needle drops on the old Columbia LP of Laura Nyro and Labelle, broke my heart with nostalgia for a time that seems now so far away, perfectly recreated.  Sissy Spacek is better in this part than she has been for years, and for once she doesn't seem like ""Sissy Spacek.""  As Alice, the suburban, aproned baking mother, she resists all her own tics, or director Michael Mayer made her play against them.  Just the way she holds the laundry basket under one arm as she barges in on her son and Bobby smoking pot is a lesson in fine acting.  You can almost see the plastic basket clench up, like her heart.  It's a dexterous piece of writing, when Bobby offers Alice a hit of the joint, just because she has been so good to him, ignoring conventional proprieties and scandalizing Jonathan.  I was sitting there, watching the scene, thinking on the one hand, this would never happen-that it's some kind of gay magic realism-and on the other, torquing an imagined world in which the love we feel can be simply, easily expressed instead of all bottled up and perverted.

Colin Farrell is so magnetic and handsome, once Robin Wright cuts his hair, that you just can't believe he never had sex in his life till he met her in the East Village.  And what were all those handjobs under the sheets in Cleveland?  I guess you're supposed to think he was bisexual, or just good at heart and gave it away to whoever wanted it.  But at the same time, not promiscuous.  Only Jonathan is promiscuous in the movie, and he pays for it at the end by coming down with Kaposi's sarcoma.  The movie has it both ways, but the actors are so good we go both ways with them.

It doesn't make sense that, having so much fun together, the trio can't stay together forever.  I remember reading the book long ago and thinking that the tragedy was inevitable, but in the movie you want them to stay happy and disagree with the moviemakers' decision to split them up.",1127433600,7,2381,4.5174825174825175

What's refreshing about ""A Home at the End of the World"" is that it explores these issues in a decidedly nontraditional way, with quirky characters that form bonds much different from the conventional suburban household, but no less loving.

Written and adapted by the author of ""The Hours,"" Michael Cunningham, ""World"" centers on a romantic triangle between Bobby Morrow (Colin Farrell), his childhood friend Jonathan Glover (Dallas Roberts), and a free-spirited older woman named Clare (Robin Wright Penn).

The film could have gotten caught up in its storyline, but chooses instead to focus on the complexity of the relationships between the characters. That's why it works. The characters, each played with sincerity and depth of conviction, are so compelling that the film becomes like a character study in friendship, family and love. All of the actors in the film turn in exquisite performances. But, it's Farrell's astonishing portrayal of Bobby that stands out.

Similar to Charlise Theron's portrayal in ""Monster,"" though not as risky, Farrell breaks free from his stereotypical roles for this film. Nearly unrecognizable as the soft-spoken Bobby, Farrell proves he has more to offer audiences than his usual two-dimensional portrayals in films such as ""Phone Booth"" and ""S.W.A.T."" In fact, this film is all about breaking stereotypes. That is its appeal.

And now that Sissy Spacek has grown up into independent film, she is really shining. I did not want this film to end.  I wanted to know what happened after Robin Penn leaves.

2143712,4,B0002Y4PPK,"For the most part, I really liked this movie. Bobby is a terrific character: innocent, charming, open, needy and sexual. I also like the way all the relationships in this film are portrayed, because they're not at all black and white. All of the relationsihps between the main characters (Bobby and Jonathan, Bobby and Clare, Jonathan and Claire, even Bobby and Jonathan's mother) are an ambiguous combination of friendship, romance, sexual attraction and family. It was nice to see these kinds of ""gray"" relationships, which I've experienced often in my own life, on film.

My favorite part of the film was the first ""act"", which showed Bobby as a child, absorbing much of his identity from his older brother, and Bobby as a teenager, befriending Jonathan and slowly being adopted by his whole family. Somehow, I preferred the younger, teenage versions of the characters to the adult versions. It's not that the older actors didn't do a good job (in fact, seeing this film gave me a newfound respect for Collin Ferrell as an actor), it's just that I found the older version of Jonathan much less appealing. I was a little disappointed that Jonathan's character ended up being a sad cliche in so many ways ... a promiscuous gay man who winds up sick from AIDS. Since so many of the relationships and ideas in this film seemed so fresh, it was sad to see one of the main characters follow such a tired path.

Although I haven't read the book, I could sense from the film that there were important aspects of the plot and the characters' lives that had been cut out. Adding scenes may have made the film longer, but it probably would have improved it. Overall, however, this was an entertaining, endearing and almost great film.",1113177600,4,1726,4.730897009966777

I loved the book so much and I honestly wanted to like the film as well but I just couldn't. They left soooo much out that could have been some great scenes on film. I believe Michael Mayer was a wrong pick to direct. Something as intimate and mature as this should have been done by Peter Bogdonavich (The Last Picture Show), Steven Daldry (""The Hours"", another Cunningham adaptaion) or Todd Field (""In The Bedroom"").

The film often has the feeling of a sunday night TV movie on ABC or something. It is truely sad that this film had so much potential coming from an excellent source. In a better adaptaion we would have seen more from Johnathan and Bobby's childhood, more of Alice and Ned's life involving a miscarrage. Johnathan's ex-boyfriend'd death could have been great! Just plain more would have been enough. The character Bobby goes through some pretty hard things in the book but the film merely mentions them or suggests them. It's frustrating! The casting on the bright side was decent. Colin Farrell and Dallas Roberts give good solid preformances. Farrell's is truely understated. Sissy Spacek's role is excrutiatingly minimized but she's still good. Robin Wright Penn is--well I didn't like Robin Wright Penn. She looks good as Claire but doesn't give the qualities the real Claire has; miscast.

I think many from less then fortunate homes hope for such a home as portrayed in this film.  Touching, deep, with enough humor to keep us from getting too emotional, the story is about people, and family and caring for one another.  The film starts out briefly in the late 60's, and we spend a fair amount of time in the 70's getting to know the boys, Bobby and Jonathan, who in essense become brothers through circumstance, not through blood lines.  I would say about half the story line is set in the 1980's as we explore the dynamics of the adult relationships as they relate to the childhood one shared by the boys.  At times, especially early, the film loses momentum, though very briefly.  Don't leave for a drink or snack, as the film and the plots move quickly.  This is a film that could have used an extra 15 minutes.  I found the sound levels to be a tad low at times.

Sissy Spacek is nothing short of a miracle as Alice, especially in her penultimate scene, as she shares with Robin Wright Penn's no less remarkable Clare, her thoughts on life, love, marriage and family - and how no one truly is prepared for anything in life.

Dallas Roberts is terrific (and sometimes, appropriately annoying).

Colin Farrell brings an previously unforeseen innocence to Bobby that borders on the saintly or angelic.  His devotion to his friends and new family is complete and shows in a performance that is can only be described as rapturous.

Jonathan at a very early age figures out who he is and what he wants.  And what he wants is Bobby.  That is until Jonathan's mother catches the boys in a compromising position one night in the front seat of a car.  He pulls back from Bobby who doesn't understand why, and moves away leaving Bobby with his parents.  Jonathan goes off the school and makes a life for himself in New York. While Bobby stays behind and becomes a baker.

Claire, Jonathan's roommate and friend is deeply in love with Jonathan and even wants to have his baby.  But because of circumstances beyond her control Jonathan isn't on the same wave length she's on.  Claire turns to the open, vulnerable and virginal Bobby.  Whom she does fall in love with but for all the wrong reasons.

And then there is Bobby, who deeply loves Jonathan and Claire.  Bobby's sexuality is never clearly defined nor should it have to be.  For him labels simply don't exist.  To him love is love be it with a man or a woman.  His openness about himself and the vulnerability in which the character is played brings home the concept of non judgmental love.

I will not be redundant by going over the story line since it is well covered in the other reviews. The bottom line is it was a good movie that I enjoyed viewing and I am glad I added it to my collection. I would not consider it a comedy and the drama was not too heavy.

For those with more of an open mind and those who are able to view all the colors in the spectrum of life, this is a beautiful and emotionally moving film.

The movie uses three main characters to illustrate the complexity of love, loss and all the other sometimes puzzling aspects of human relationships. It's a vivid illustration of the confusing and complicated nature of genuine and unconditional love and all it's implications in a society obsessed with labels and categorization.

Dallas Roberts and Robin Penn give noteworthy acting performances and Sissy Spacek also gives a spectacular performance as an unconditionally loving mother. Colin Farrell, however, gives a superior performance, in his portrayal of a young man transformed by a series of great losses. His charismatic and seemingly innocent character does a great job at invoking both sympathy and frustration in some of the characters and the audience watching this movie.

The story spans a few decades from the late 60's to what seemed to be the early 80's and the soundtrack does a stellar job at setting the mood for the first two. A great job in casting was also done as both of the kids really looked like young versions of the adult actors.

The film's attempts to re-create different time periods are reasonably well-done, but sometimes distracting from the story, which is great and has many twists and turns.

Bobby, the central character, loses his family and is basically adopted by another family, whom he more than adopts as his own.

Bobby is, apparently, very much a child of the sixties, who defies easy labels like straight or gay.  I think it's fair to say he loves certain people whether they are male or female.  While it's a little confusing and frustrating at times (for the viewer as well as for the people Bobby loves,) his sense of wonder and optimism about the world is charming and disarming.  Although he seems, at times, child-like, he may just be exceptionally loving and caring and able to maintain deep attachments. The character is very attractive and likeable.

The story takes some turns toward the end that are not altogether well-supported or explained, but you can sometimes draw your own conclusions to greater satisfaction than when offered a simple, easy ending.

Sissy Spacek deserves her billing for this film; she positively shines and steals every scene she is in.

Robin Wright Penn is one of my favorite female actors so that's another plus for this movie.

I notice a pattern in my movie viewing.  I seem to watch many films in which the characters lead tortured lives.  Farrell's character watches as one by one his family members die.  Farrell moves in with neighbors and has a very close bond with his best friend.

Years later when things seem to have settled down, the torture begins again.  In a three way relationship of sorts, the characters kind of know the purpose of being together is simply not to be alone.

  Bobby Morrow has a family that is really messed up.  As a young boy, he hears and then sees his own relative have sex.  Not a good thing.  Then his relative tries to get him on a drug.  Not good.

The friendship is still there.  But Claire is about to throw a wrench into this friendship.  How will it all work out?

  For Colin Farrell to play this character, so different than himself, so different than any role he has played before (complete opposite of his role in ""Tigerland"") is so awesome.  A mindblower.

2143733,5,B0002Y4PPK,"A Home at the End of the World, written by Michael Cunningham and directed by Michael Mayer, is a poignant film about a cheerful, truly selfless and endearing boy who wants everyone to be happy. The film follows the life of Bobby Morrow from 1967 through 1982.

Growing up in Cleveland, Bobby (Andrew Chalmers) is impressionable, innocent, and admires his involved older brother, Carlton (Ryan Donowho). They have a close relationship even though there is a significant age difference. Carlton gives Bobby lessons in drug use and tells his pre-pubescent brother it's time he experiences the joys of sex. The most valuable lesson Carlton teaches him is that there is goodness in the world and there is nothing to fear. At the tender age of nine, Bobby witnesses Carlton's death, the result of a freak accident.

In high school, Bobby (Erik Smith) befriends shy, nerdy, Jonathan Glover (Harris Allan). He introduces Jonathan and his mother, Alice (Sissy Spacek), to their first experience with marijuana. Alice takes Bobby in when the motherless boy's father dies. It doesn't take long for the boys' friendship to take the next step. A pivotal moment in the film is the natural and realistic way Bobby and Jonathan experience their first mutual sexual experience. The subject remains taboo well into adulthood...they never really talk about their relationship. Bobby attributes their fooling around to ""just being kids"" and even a deep kiss means nothing more than love between brothers.

At another highpoint in the film, Alice realizes that her son is gay when she finds the boys in a compromising situation. She handles the discovery in a very open-minded and truly inspiring way for a mother in 1974.

As an adult, Bobby (Colin Farrell) is still a kid, living in a man's body. Bobby works as a baker and is still living with Jonathan's parents long after Jonathan (Dallas Roberts) relocates to New York. Alice and Ned (Matt Frewer) must move to Arizona because of Ned's failing health. Ned feels it's time for Bobby to be on his own. Bobby doesn't handle being alone very well and ends up moving to New York to live with Jonathan and his best friend, Clare (Robin Wright Penn).

The three friends become an unconventional family and have a child together. All seems ideal at their ""home at the end of the world."" Bobby opens up a caf, Jonathan works there, and Clare stays home to raise the baby-what could be better? They all love each other and care for one another on different levels. It's a complicated love triangle, but one you can't help care about.

The soundtrack, set and costume designs capture the mood at the height of the sexual revolution-hippies immersed in free love, drugs, Woodstock, and psychedelic times. The writer and director have done their homework and the film is believable. Also evident is the women's lib movement. Alice, a typical stay-at-home mom, witnesses Clare's freedom from conventional behavior: Clare, a free spirit and unwed mother, follows her heart, not societal constraints.

The entire cast of A Home at the End of the World gives noteworthy performances, particularly Colin Farrell who is wonderful at revealing the vulnerability and sweetness of Bobby. Dallas Roberts gives an outstanding performance as Jonathan, the openly gay man who looks for love in all the wrong places. Roberts is one of the highlights of the film. Academy award winning actress, Sissy Spacek, as Alice Glover is perfectly cast as Jonathan's mother.

Don't miss this five star nostalgic movie for its moving depiction of love, loss, and the beginnings of the change in societal and familial values during the hippie generation. I watched and enjoyed A Home at the End of the World three times and could easily watch it again. It's fun, but sad too. I warn you, A Home at the End of the World can be a tearjerker. For those of you who enjoy a good cry, don't miss this golden opportunity. It should be noted that this reviewer may be more emotional than most.",1105488000,3,3981,4.887407407407407
2143734,3,B0002Y4PPK,"This film is alternative and independent in every sense of the word.  I'm assuming it only got made because the author of the novel received success with his later novel ""The Hours"", and people in Hollywood assumed that movie goers were clamoring for more from this writer.

My patience was tried with this film.  I was impressed how the younger version of Colin Farrell does look quite similar to Colin, so that was a brilliant casting job.  Colin plays Bobby, a boy who experienced too much too young...with an older brother so strung out on drugs that he didn't care if Bobby walked in on him having sex with his girlfriend (Bobby must have been about ten years younger than his brother), and he introduces Bobby to drugs.  Later on, when Bobby becomes an orphan, he moves in with the family of his best friend, Jonathan and starts corrupting them with his care-free, drugged out casualness.

When Bobby meets up with Jonathan in their early twenties, in New York, he joins in on the strange relationship between Jonathan and Claire, who love each other, just not romantically.  They become a sort of alternative family, a polyamory menage a trois, each finding in the other two what no single person can fulfill in them.  Ultimately, the open and unconventional relationship doesn't work out (someone always gets jealous for being left out), and the one thing Bobby fears (being alone) is the very thing he will have to endure.

Robin Wright Penn gives a great performance as the unconventional Claire, who loves bright red hair and drawn on eyebrows.  This role could almost be an extension of her role in ""Forrest Gump"" as Jenny, with the similarity in being drawn to unconventional lifestyles.  She is the best thing about the film.  Colin Farrell is always an interesting actor to watch and he did a great job here as well.  The third star, I'd give for the cool song they play when Bobby moves to New York.  It has a cool beat to it and something I don't hear on the radio...so if the soundtrack has it, I'm buying it.  Music choice often makes a film...but unfortunately here, the other elements just don't add up to a movie I'd care to see again.  The best thing I can say for this film is that it's just one more case that polyamory relationships don't work.  Marriage was meant for two people only...three's always a crowd.",1104796800,3,2336,4.644768856447689
2143735,1,B0002Y4PPK,"I suppose its a little unfair to take shots at this ""little film"".  Sort of like taking short range shotgun blasts at roadkill.

Here goes anyway.

For starters, this thing has no dramatic tension, whatsoever.  There is no antagonist.  Without an antagonist, the film totally lacks drama.  Nope, these people (three of them, for the most part) just live their implausible, sad, little lives (from the late 60's to the early 80's).  And we're supposed to be interested.

Interested in what?  A mildly retarded bisexual named Bobby (played by Colin Farrell) whose emotional range makes Forrest Gump look like Brando?  How about his childhood friend, Jonathan, a more standard homosexual, who as an adult has frequent ""dates"" with strange men - with the apparent approval of his ""girlfriend"" Claire (played by Robin Wright)?  After Farrell's character moves in with the two of them in NYC, he knocks up Claire, and they start a ""family"".  How touching!

Claire makes hats.  Bobby bakes.  Jonathan, uh, sort of works in an office, looks important, and points at papers.

The men in this film are unabashedly lame.  They canoodle with one another.  They cry alot, and whine.  They're decidedly ambiguous about everything.  Claire, in the end, apparently figures out how pathetic Bobby and Jonathan really are, and bolts with the baby (good for her). There's no explaining why she leaves, however. It's not really clear why this washed-out looking hippie would have any problem with the current arrangement.  She just leaves with the baby one morning - to who knows where.  Bobby, however, intuitively knows she's not coming back (he's not a total dope).

Jonathan, for his part, has developed AIDS and, at the end of the movie, it looks like he's toast.  The nitwit Bobby, apparently, really will be left all alone in the end - the one thing he feared more than anything.

A morality tale?  Heavens NO!  To this film maker, all of the above is perfectly acceptable, and should even be considered a subset of ""normal"" by the rest of us.  Forget the kid born out of wedlock, the guy doomed to a painful, disease ridden, early 80's strain of AIDS, and the moron left holding the bag.

In fact, let's not even look at the painful stuff.  Let's just end the movie!  That's the idea.  Show a post-card shot of the neato house the three stooges bought in Woodstock (paid for conveniently by Claire's inheritance from an anonymous grandma), and roll the credits.

It's just another lifestyle.  It's ""all goodness"" (as the younger Bobby insipidly says to Jonathan's mom to implore her to smoke weed with him and Jonathan early in the film).

Suburban moms getting high.  Teenage boys making out with each other.  Pansexuality.  Anonymous sex between grown men. Children born out of wedlock.  Drug abuse.  AIDS.  No, moron boy, its not ""all goodness.""

Family really can be ""whatever you want it to be"" according the film's tagline.  Most folks, however, will be revolted at this simpering, sniveling, paean to 'alternate' lifestyles.  These people need counseling, not congratulations.  Their lives are a total, unmitigated disaster, and the film maker deliberately avoids looking at that part of it.  If he had had the courage to do so, the film would've been halfway interesting (and maybe not a total bomb).

Gutless.  Craven.  Unctuous.  Agonizing pacing.  Implausible plot.  Unbelievable characters.  This is a lousy Colin Farrell picture.

It's one of the best films I've seen in a long time.""  ""At Home at The End of The World"" has many great messages, including that it's a ""big, beautiful, noisy world out there."" And also that you can create your own family. Ryan Donowho does an impressive job with a small role as Bobby's older hippie brother, who tells him things like ""all the goodness of the world is out there for you"" and ""there's always more.""  I've always believed people in the sixties had it right, except for the hard drugs, and this film proves my point as most of the messages seem to come from that era.

Colin Farrell is excellent as Bobby, a boy who has been taught that the world is a good and beautiful place.  I've never seen him in a film before, but really enjoyed his subtle, underplayed character. I agree with other reviewers, though, that he fumbled with his acting in places. There are a few scenes with the baby where he seems forced and uncomfortable.

As Jonathan, Bobby's much more uptight best friend and lover, Dallas Roberts nails the part and is perfect. He is excellent at portraying his character's inner conflicts and issues.

I do agree with others on here that the teenage actors, however, did the best acting as Bobby and Jonathan.

Robin Wright Penn does a brilliant job as the artistic and zany Clare, a hat designer and trust fund baby. Some people have mentioned that she looks a decade older than the other characters, but if you really LISTEN to the dialogue, they make a big point of the fact that she is older and was at Woodstock, which could easily make her a decade older than the men.

Sissy Spacek is also incredibly good as a sixties mom who is caught between her desires for a more exciting life and to be a good wife and mother.

One thing my friend and I were confused about was the AIDS issue in the film. I haven't read the book so I don't know if it is made more clear in the story.  But in the film, the mark on Jonathan's hip looks more like a bruise than a sarcoma and near the end, Bobby comments that it looks like it is fading.

Some films haunt you and make you think about them for weeks after viewing them. This is one of those. ""A Home At The End Of The World"" has inspired me to read the novel and purchase the DVD.

Spoiler Alert****:  I did not find the ending as sad as some others did.

2143741,5,B0002Y4PPK,"This movie is amazing in many ways offering a showcase for the writing talent of Michael Cunningham (the writer of the original novel) as well as providing a solution for all of the lonely families that exist in the world today...make your own.

As a young boy Bobby Morrow (Andrew Chalmers) is exposed to the magical world of his older spaced-out brother and he learns that happiness can be found in the simplest of experiences. However a freak accident takes the brother's life and Bobby is left to mature in a world not always so welcoming. As a teenager Bobby (Erik Smith) befriends another boy, Jonathan Glover (Harris Allan), and they experiment with weed and sex forging a friendship/relationship that lasts for a lifetime. Bobby finds a new family in Jonathan's after his own mother and father eventually pass away. Lost and alone Bobby retains his innocence and openness managing to capture the admiration of everyone he encounters it seems. One of his strongest relationships happens with Mrs. Glover (Sissy Spacek) Jonathan's mother who teaches him to bake and provides him a direction in life. As an adult Bobby (Colin Farrell) works in a bakery and lives with the Glovers until they move to Arizona. This prompts Bobby to move to New York to live with Jonathan (Dallas Roberts) and his kooky artistic roommate/girlfriend Clare (Robin Wright Penn). From this crazy situation a family forms, crossing barriers and fine lines in order to incorporate the needs of three misunderstood and lonely people.

I can't say enough about how beautiful the message in the movie is. It is both complicated and simple in theory resulting in something incredibly profound. The question is raised about the rights and wrongs of relationships and how society perceives them finally offering a solution that can only be accepted by someone who has evolved beyond believing that society's norms are the only answer. Isn't it more important to experience true unconditional love rather than what most families pretend to feel in order to appear ""normal""? The acting in this film is extraordinary with Colin Farrell showing his true gifts to tremendous ability and playing the infectious Bobby to perfection. Robin Wright Penn is brilliant as always along with Dallas Roberts. And of course Sissy Spacek is seen here in an extraordinary light as a mother who cares more about her family than her own image. It is impossible to walk away from this film with a hardened heart and for anyone who has ever felt the stork dropped them on the wrong doorstep this movie inspires hope and shows that a family can form from the most surprising circumstances if you open up your heart and allow it to find a real home.",1103068800,5,2698,4.901531728665208
2143742,5,B0002Y4PPK,"I loved every minute of this movie. The storyline that this movie has is very interesting and extremely well executed from this viewer's point of view. I guess what I like the most is how well the characters intertwined with each other. Their emotions the physical as well psychological play a very important role in the development of their characters throughout the film. All of the actors in this incredible film did a superb job including the two young actors that played Bobby and Jonathan as kids growing up.

Colin Farrell is without a doubt one of the finest actors around. He is very convincing and he easily lets the viewer inside his character what he is feeling and how he is feeling it. Much has been said about Farrell's dashing good looks and bad boy image but all that aside the guy is a wonderful actor and he more than proves it in this movie.

Dallas Roberts the actor that plays the shy and sensitive Jonathan who at times is openly gay and other times not is equally convincing. He held his own next to Colin Farrell and did great job at it. I have never seen this actor before in anything but he can definately act and does a very good job of it. He had a hold of his character at all times and it showed in his flawless performance.

Robin Wright Penn was also terrific and created a wonderful character as the sometimes nutty and funny Claire. The woman which both Bobby and Jonathan fall in love with and take to bed the both of them at different times. Although she has done quite a few movies this is by far one of her best performances I feel.

Last but certainly not least is Academy Award winner Sissy Spacek. A veteran actress that plays Jonathan's mother. She did a great job like she always does and had me laughing at the scene where Bobby as a teenager ask her to smoke a joint with him and Jonathan. She decline at first but then decided to go for it and started coughing when she inhaled the smoke. I can say enough about this movie it is excellent. Some guys the real tough ones may think that this film is for sissies who get off on seeing two guys kiss each other as Bobby and Jonathan do in I think two scenes in the movie. It goes beyond the kiss and the cuddling in bed together it is much deeper than that I believe.

The kissing scenes in the movie between Bobby and Jonathan were actually very sincere and I did not find them offensive or gortesque in any way. They were needed to establish the relationship that the two actors playing the lead roles were having. I thought that Michael Mayer the director took special care in the way these scenes were played out and in the end they came off as a very important part to the plot of the movie. They were very innocent like and handled very well by both actors.

Take it from a guy who is straight, this film should be seen by everyone gay or straight it does not matter. This is a beautiful movie with excellent performances from the entire cast. I wish they would make more movies like this one as it left a profound effect on me and it will for you also if you see it I think. You have to be a dumb jerk not to like this movie, it has all of the ingredients of a fine motion picture. The scenery is beautiful too especially the scenes that were filmed in Canada really nice and cozy. Add to this a great soundtrack of 60's and 70's music (I love the music of those times). If you care to see a movie with heart with an excellent cast that bring out superb performances out of their characters you cannot miss A HOME AT THE END OF THE WORLD.",1102982400,4,3538,4.257440476190476
2143743,4,B0002Y4PPK,"At last, the Hollywood Badboy abandons his big-budget action/hetero roles and gave into this sentimental sexuality/family/relationship indie-film! I was surprised to see Colin Farrell willing to do love scene with a man and a woman in one movie, and I must say he's quite adorable playing a bisexual guy.

The script is well written by the author who also wrote The Hours, which also happens to deal with sexuality. It's a more charming story unlike the depression mood in The Hours. The only weakness is that the characters are not as strong and emotionally impacting here.

Colin Farrel plays an old-fashioned guy who adopted Sissy Spacek's family to be his ever since his parents died when he was a kid in the 70's. He got along with the family well and bonded with the son intimately. By the time he was in his late teens, he was having his first sexual experience with Spacek's son(Dallas Roberts) who would eventually move to the big city and become openly gay. Farrel stayed in the small town and worked as a baker, and he's rather unattractive in long hair.

One day he decided to go to the big city and try a new life and reconnect with Roberts. He met his roomate(Robin Wright Penn), who was a hair-dresser and looked fabulous in her ultra-funky hair that resembled Boy George or Cindy Lauper. They instantly clicked and gradually hit it off romantically, and lost his virginity to her. He now realized that he could go for a woman too, despite he had only had sex with Roberts. Penn gave Farrel a makeover and he looked smashy! Roberts was kind of jealous that they have become an item. Meanwhile, he's having casual sex like junk food, which ultimately infected him with HIV.

Farrel still loves Roberts, but he's in a relationship with Penn, and suddenly she's pregnant....

Sissy Spacek has limited screen time, but she had the most fun, because she gets to smoke pot with the boys and she's open-minded and eccentric mother.

Robin Wright Penn is great, she's flashy and it was touching when she realized that she was just a second best in Farrel's life, even a baby couldn't take up his entire heart.

Colin Farrel gives his most dramatic performance, and it's a joy to see him play the opposite of a rebel.

Dallas Roberts gives a scene-stealing performance. His role is very emotionally volatile, and he was powerful when he broke down into tears upon knowing that he was dying.",1102723200,3,2396,4.688095238095238
2143744,5,B0002Y4PPK,"I practically lost count trying to

come up with how many '80s/'90s gay/love/AIDS

dramas there are out there.  Of

course there is the recent HBO ""Angels in America"".

That is of course one of the better ones.

But I think this is still better, though I would like it to

have been longer. Think of it, how many movies do you see where

you think, on seeing the credits, ""is that all there is?""

I agree with some other reviewers

that the younger actors, playing Bobby and Jonathan

as teenagers, tend to upstage their older counterparts,

and we should have seen some kind of tension when the

two parted at around age seventeen.  One is left wondering

what Bobby (the Colin Farrell character) is doing between

age 17 and age 24, when he reconnects with Johnny. Yet while

at first it seems unsatisfying not to know what he is up to,

living with his adopted parents, maybe it makes sense after

all to leave it up to the imagination, and there are a lot

of ambiguous scenes when they do reconnect, where maybe it is

more effective that way.

Speaking of imagination, probably the worst '80s-'90s

gay/love/AIDS drama was of course ""Philadelphia""

where Tom Hanks chose to skip joining the estimable

company of actors who have shared ""on-screen"" kisses

or affectional exchanges with other men.  Farrell

is a little awkward, but that is part of his character

in this film too.  He has been criticized as miscast;

I don't agree.  He has just the right innocence and

ingenuousness that we see from his childhood early in

the film.

The first twenty minutes of this film are magical for anyone who

remembers what the '70s were like, and the rest of the film is not quite

at that level, but close, as we see how the choices the characters make

eventually resolve in a life-affirming story

of love and committment.

This movie is so good that I am sending copies to friends.

All the actors are great, not just the kids, but Sissy Spacek

as Johnny's mother, and Dallas Roberts as Johnny.  And I liked

the music too, though I don't typically enjoy it in dramas like this.",1102636800,5,2084,4.561307901907357
2143745,4,B0002Y4PPK,"There is nothing conventional about this story by Michael Cunningham, author of The Hours, who wrote this novel as well as the screenplay.  It is a mood piece that explores some very gentle and interesting relationships and covers the years from 1967 to 1982, a coming of age story of one particular young man and the culture around him.

We first meet Bobby Morrow when he is about 8 years old.  He adores his older brother who is tragically killed when he walks into a glass sliding door.  Bobby's mother dies soon after that and his father dies when he is a teenager.  About this time he meets Jonathan Glover in high school.  Jonathan is awkward and quiet and adores Bobby who teaches him to smoke pot.  Sissy Spacek is cast as Jonathan's mother and one of the most memorable scenes in the film is when she discovers the two boys smoking pot and they invite her to join them.  Jonathan shows signs of being gay and the two boys experiment a little bit in this area.

Bobby is so loved by Jonathan's family that he comes to live with them and is still living with them years later after Jonathan has long since got to moved to New York.  He is 24 years old before he leaves and meets up with Jonathan who, by now, is clearly gay and indulging in casual romantic relationships, which were so endemic at the time.  The two young men move in together even though it is clear that are just friends and that Bobby is not gay.  They also have a female roommate, Clare, played by Robin Wright Penn who is unconventional herself in the way she dyes her hair bright red or purple.

Bobby and Clare get together and soon she is pregnant.  She has inherited some money, which allows the three of them to buy a house in upstate New York where they plan on raising the child.  All goes well for a while, the baby girl is a delight, and the two men start a small restaurant in town.  But then tragedy strikes as the AIDS crisis touches their happy household.

There are deep and complex characterizations in this film.  The people are totally believable though.  And I found myself sharing their emotional roller coasters.  The ending is sad but inevitable but I do applaud the stellar performances and excellent screenplay.

This is not a film for everyone, but for film buffs like me I really got into the story and the people. Recommended.",1102118400,3,2331,4.4504716981132075
2143746,5,B0002Y4PPK,"I was going to wait until the film fully settled, but it has been over a week now, and I still think about it. There are a few points to note here.

First, this isn't really a ""political"" or ""statement"" type movie-not on its face at least. I found this beautifully crafted film more a statement on the reality of life in America, and how we all do the best that we can. Farrell's character represents to me the ideal, of what we should be like. Loving, forgiving, and free from all pretension.

Second, Farrell demonstrates that he truly is an amazing and powerful actor. The entire cast is very strong, but Farrell, being the ""movie-star"" really proves his talent.

Third, sex can simply be an expression of love. Yes, hard to imagine now-adays in the age of returning Victorianism, but perhaps humans can express love through sexual contact. I know, this is probably the most shocking concept of the movie to some.

In summation, I am very glad I purchased this dvd. I will rewatch it many times. The film is not without flaw, but is such a true piece of art and tremendous talent in the acting, direction, wonderful cinematography/filming, and it delivers the concept (not a new one) of a three-partner relationship to a new more grown-up and honest interpretation. Strongly recommended. This is the best film I have seen in 2004, and for quite a few years before as well.",1101945600,5,1375,4.622950819672131
2143747,2,B0002Y4PPK,"A Home at the End of the World is a beautiful story about the changing family structure in our society.  It is the story of friends, lovers, and life told in a way that is becoming more and more common in our world.  It is the simple story of Bobby and Jonathon and the tangled lives that they lead together.  Sadly, there is a downside to this story.  While I was completely enthralled with the charismatic story and the new direction of Hollywood boy-toy Farrell, there was still something missing from this film.  While I appreciated the social commentary about the possibility of a same-sex couple bringing up a child, it was the choice of director Michael Mayer to cast Robin Wright Penn, Dallas Roberts, Sissy Spacek, and Matt Frewer that considerably lost points in my film book.

Here we have an enchanting story.  A love story that has chosen to go in a very powerful direction that is normally not taken in a Hollywood film.  It will capture your imagination and your heart, but will leave you dreaming for more because the actors are not suitable for their roles.  Now, don't get me wrong.  Normally when I write these reviews I am discuss how poor the actors did in their roles and then I go into a rant about that, but instead with this film I just felt that the actors were miscast.  As I shrug my shoulders at this thought, I think back to the film and how some of the scenes that were to be important just didn't stand out because I couldn't see the actors actually playing the parts.  1980s Jonathon seemed like too much of a homosexual clich.  It felt like Mayer decided to forego any development of Jonathon's character to place scenes of him doing cliched homosexual things.  It is hard to explain, but I knew that Jonathon was gay, I didn't need to continually be reminded of it.  I wanted to see more depth, more power, and I don't think that Mayer or Dallas Roberts were willing to give it.  Spacek wandered through her part like a pro, adding nothing new yet never detracting from it.  I didn't realize Frewer was in this film until later on, man, it is great to see that guy.  Finally, there was Robin Wright Penn, whom, out of all of the characters, was the most miscast of them all.  Her zaniness and eclectic personality never truly came over the mountain.  She played her part, she was enjoyable to watch, but was nothing short of average.  Colin Farrell was the only actor worth watching in this film.  He impressed me with his pensive, quiet demeanor.  I just wish the others had seen him and followed suit.  I think that for this film to work we needed some better players in the roles.

As I look over these characters and the lack of pizzazz that the actors gave, I also begin to think of how they fit into the story.  Jonathon and Bobby are the major players in this romantic exploration, but what is Clare's role?  After watching this film I had to ask myself this question several times.  Why was she even in there?  Does she really keep Bobby and Jonathon together?  As horrible as this sounds, I basically saw her as a birthing tool to show how these two gay men would handing having a baby.  It felt like propaganda for audiences to show them that two men could handing a child just as well as the conventional family.  Perhaps I was mistaken, but I just couldn't see the path or direction of Robin's character.  When her climactic moment occurs, I just didn't care.  Her lack of excitement and moments of randomness just lessened the effect.  I didn't make sense to me...

Outside of a couple of poor shots by the cinematographer that just seemed to distract from the rest of the story, it ends visionary.  Not to give anything away, but I was expecting a larger finale.  This film reminded me of gym class.  Let me explain.  Remember in high school when you had the run the mile for Physical Fitness and there you were pushing your muscles to the limit, and as you turned your head you saw that other classmates were just walking the course.  A Home at the End of the World is those students walking the course.  It never really picks up much speed and never makes you gasp for air.  I felt as if this film was striding along expecting people to be surprised by the liberal nature of the film.  If this film was made years ago, I think it would surprise viewers, but with films like Angels in America currently winning awards and breaking boundaries, it needed to have something stronger.  Alas, it just was never there.

Overall, I wasn't happy with the characters or the final result.  I expected to be flabbergasted by the story, images, and social commentary by this film and instead it came closer to clich than shocking.  I don't think it is worth picking up unless you are that one die-hard Colin Ferrell fan.  He does a decent job in this film, but nothing else is worth writing home about.  A could-be powerful film that seems to be running at half speed (if running at all)!

I have read less flattering reviews of the film and the performances, but in my opinion this film glitters, and the performances are bang - on. Even the smallest supporting roles have been carefully cast and all of the Bobbys support and lay groundwork for Colin Farrell's adult Bobby. Colin is a revelation in this role. I had no idea he had such depth. He will steal your heart.

2143760,5,B0002Y4PPK,"""A Home at the End of the World"" is a good movie, simply put.  I was surprised actually because I didn't expect much from it.  Although it had Colin Farrell, who I think is a good young actor and Sissy Spacek, who is incredibly good at her craft, I wasn't pressed to see it.  Now that I have, I actually plan to buy a copy.  The story centers around two young men, Bobby (played with great vulnerability by Farrell) and his buddy, Jonathon, (played by Dallas Roberts).  The two become friends as boys, during a time when Bobby's life has seen one tragedy after another.  Bobby and Jonathon experiment sexually with each other and become lovers until Jonathon's mother (played by the wonderfully talented Sissy Spacek) discovers their burgeoning romance.  Freaked out by this, he tells Bobby they should stop and reveals to Bobby that as soon as possible he plans to leave their hometown for the big city.

  The story next picks up when the boys are young men.  Bobby is still living with his surrogate parents and Jonathon has moved on to a life in Cleveland.  When Jonathon's father decides to move to Arizona to help his declining health, Bobby must move to Cleveland and live with Jonathon and his colorful roommate Claire (played by Robin Wright Penn).  Claire and Bobby begin a romance as Jonathon seems to fall into one sexual encounter after another.  The relationship spells out trouble for the threesome as they try to deal with a very complicated love triangle that hinges on the sweet, innocent Bobby, who's biggest fear in life is being alone.  The three try to form a non-traditional family but in the end, Claire comes to have doubts about the situation pushing her to make a difficult decision.

  The actors give really good peformances (Robin Penn Wright is good as Claire) but it is Colin Farrell and Sissy Spacek that stand out.  Farrell gets to show a softer side to his macho/action image and Spacek is great as a loving mother, who finds herself in a situation of lonliness after the loss of her husband and once her two boys have begun their own lives.

2143765,1,B0002Y4PPK,"As with the Oscar-winning ""The Hours,"" this film is based on a novel by the Pulitzer Prize author, Michael Cunningham.  The author even adapted his book for the screenplay.  I haven't read ""A Home at the End of the World,"" but one thing became clear while watching the film adaptation - the novel covers far too much territory to be condensed into a 96 minute movie.

The basic plot concerns the relationship between Bobby Morrow (Colin Farrell) and Jonathan Glover (Dallas Roberts), a pair of misfit teens growing up in the 70s.  They experiment with drugs and their own sexuality.  When Bobby's father dies, he goes to live with Jonathan and his parents, played by Sissy Spacek and Matt Frewer.  Eventually they part ways when Jonathan moves to NYC, but they meet up again in the early 80s and form a family of sorts with Clare (Robin Wright Penn).  The basic theme of ""A Home at the End of the World"" is that you can find family in unusual places, embodied by the tagline, ""Family can be whatever you want it to be.""

Unfortunately, the plot is so abridged and disjointed, that not a single moment feels genuine or of real consequence.  At the end of each scene, I could almost hear the director scream ""Cut!  Now let's jump forward a year!""  Rather then trying to cover such a broad expanse (12 years), the script should have focused in more detail on shorter time periods, which would have allowed for more natural character development.  In addition, the film tries to hard to address ""Big Issues"" (AIDS, gay relationships),  when it would have worked better as a smaller character-driven film.  At the end of the film, I felt as though I knew absolutely nothing about these characters - a real waste of talent like Colin Farrell and Robin Wright Penn.  On the plus side, the movie does include some interesting and eclectic music.  However, even though I really wanted to like this movie, I find that I cannot recommend it.

DVD Extras: A behind-the-scenes documentary is the only extra.  Of note, ""A Home at the End of the World"" came and went from theaters fairly quickly, with most of its attention derived from a Colin Farrell nude scene that was cut when test audiences called it ""too distracting"" - leading to great speculation about his endowment.  Those scenes have not been reinstated for the DVD version, so audiences hoping for some titillation will be sadly disappointed!",1099958400,28,2390,4.715662650602409
2143766,5,B0002Y4PPK,"I had read the novel A Home at the End of the World quite some time ago and I loved it.  I think that Cunningham is a beautiful writer.  That said, the film version does condense the story and runs for a short 96 minutes.  While that is somewhat of a dissapointment, what they did capture in the film is still quite tender and moving.  The perfomances are first-rate (Sissy Spacek should see a Best Supporting Actress nod coming her way).  Farrel, Wright-Penn and Roberts are great. What is the definition of family? And, in the end, is any familty still really different from the rest? I dare you not to be moved by this film.",1099958400,8,627,4.370689655172414
2143767,1,B0002Y4PPK,"After reading and studying Cunningham's novel, my students and I were completely dissapointed by a text that does not have to do anything at all with the novel.  The curious thing is that Cunningham wrote the script for the film.  Not only it was low-budget, but incredibly choppy.  The text was used in a college course about friendship among males entitled ""Men in Friendship"" (a first-year seminar), and this movie was a real disaster.

To put it in simple words, the movie was like ""Will and Grace (with Jonathan being Jack) go to the movies"".

The absense of Erich, a crucial character in the novel, and the one who is dying of AIDS (Jonathan does not have the disease in the novel), was an enormous mistake.  The leifmotiv of the lake, where Bobby and Jonathan solidified their brotherhood (by the way, the only mutual [...] scene in the novel is the one inside the car), is also non-existent.  In the novel, the three characters, Bobby, Jonathan and Erich, go to the icy lake to ritualize their brotherhood and that's the end of the novel, not the ceremony with Jonathan's father ashes.

This is a text about friendship and there were never French kisses between Jonathan and Bobby.  The movie wants Bobby's character to come across as a bisexual character.  In the novel, his sexual orientation is not an issue, but his love for both Jonathan and Clare.  At the end, it's all about Bobby and Jonathan, and Bobby finally finding the brother he lost when he was a child, Carlton.  The two female characters, Clare and Alice, vanished from the text, making it a male narrative.

Sissy Spaceck as Alice is awful.  She does not even have a southern accent like in the novel and the movie tries to hint that there is some kind of sexual tension between her and Bobby.

The father was a stucky-built and rather handsome man, not a tall and thin guy like in the movie.  And Jonathan was not a dorky-looking child either.

At any rate, my students had a wonderful time laughing their heads off while watching a very dissapointing film based on a novel they really enjoyed.

The acting is mediocre (Clare and Jonathan being the worst), and Collin Ferrel does not show any talent at all in this movie.  He is just a cute guy, nothing else; just like Errol Flyn was handsome, but could not act for the life of him.  I don't understand why an actress of such caliber as Sissy Spaceck, worked in this movie.  Did she need the money?

After seeing ""The Hours"", an excellent adaptation of another of Cunningham's literary masterpieces, ""A Home at the End of the World"" was a terrible cinematic faux-pas.",1099958400,10,2595,4.620087336244541

So many books are difficult to adapt to the screen, usually because the book has complexity of some form which is difficult to translate. The Lord of the Rings movies are good examples, as none of them were truly GREAT until the extended release version was released (I'm assuming that will hold true for Return of the King, as it did for Fellowship and Two Towers). In this case it's the complexity of the characters emotions and the character arc of Bobby Marrow.

It's curious that so much time was spent on Bobby Marrow's childhood, and proportionately very little on his adult life - which was the heart and soul of the story. Never mind that far too many changes were made to the screenplay to cram the book into 96 minutes (major mistake, guys) - what's on film simply isn't very compelling. Why? We aren't given the amount of time to care about the characters, even though we've spent considerable time with them when they were younger. Adults are different from teenagers, and you can't just hop eight years ahead and skip briskly toward the ending bearing the assumption that the audience has become familiar with the characters as adults. The childhood and teenage experiences we were treated to should have served as a prelude of sorts to the characters adult lives. Instead, they treated all of those as part of a complete whole, and as a result, they failed.

Why did Bobby decide not to go with his own flesh and blood? And the woman that he loved? Sometimes it's okay for a film or story to leave the guesswork to us, but in an emotional drama such as this, it's inexcusable.

On a separate note, I thought that Erik Smith, who portrayed Bobby Marrow as a teenager, played him with superb confidence. I was very impressed with his performance.",1099872000,7,1792,4.6613924050632916

8034679,5,B0002Y4PPK,"This is a Five Star film all the way. A lady named Barbara moved from the building and discarded a bunch of DVDs. This was one of the ones I salvaged and I have to say after four years I'm truly glad I kept and finally saw the film. The writing was great and the acting was even better. I won't go into a review of the actual film because others have done that much better than I could. I will say this: For a kid to go through such trauma at so young of an age and to come out well-adjusted shows an inner strength. I can't imagine losing both of my parents within ten years' time and being able to function as an adult. I'd have been devastated.

The story takes place from 1967 on into 1983 I believe. All of the actors that were chosen to represent the characters at the various stages of their lives were spot on. The casting director did a remarkable job there. But my one quibble is this: When Bobby became an orphan where were all the rest of his family members? One could assume that his Dad would have had siblings who would have taken him in--either that or his Mom would have. Also, his inheritance is not discussed. I presume that he would have inherited the house and all of his parent's possessions which would have provided him a nice little nest egg. Unfortunately none of that is discussed in the film. Perhaps it is in the book. I'll have to see. Despite this I still recommend the movie. It hits on all cylinders. I'm the 171st person to review this great film.
