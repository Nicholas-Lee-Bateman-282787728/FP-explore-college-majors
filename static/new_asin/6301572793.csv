341898,3,6301572793,"There seem to have been a trend in the late 80's of movies about wealthy white men whose lives were just not quite what they had hoped. The worst of them was Blake Edward's ""That's Life"", but this one is a close second. Poor Jeff Bridges' marriage to gorgeous Farrah Fawcett breaks up. He then marries the luminous Alice Krige. He still isn't quite happy. Really, there should be a telethon!
It's not that the movie is bad: all of the main actors are great, and the plot isn't that bad. Even the actors who play the kids (Drew Barrymore, Lucas Haas, Mackauley Culkin) manage not to be moppets. But somehow I just couldn't seem to care that much. As another reviewer said, it's a rainy day movie; but it would have to be seriously rainy day.",1010275200,2,740,4.408759124087592

341900,3,6301572793,"Jeff Bridges and Alice Krige give a fair performance of the trials and tribulations of a couple starting over in marriage. I liked this cute tale of seeing how one marriage ended in divorce, the other in a death and finally the challenge of two individuals coming together.
  See Jeff as the whacko psychiatrist who will do any outrageous thing to win his girl. Witness him as he deals with his feelings of loss and his inept attempts at trying to fit in with his new wife and step-children.
  Alice does a fair portrayal as an obsessive mom. there are a few moments of zaniness snf light humor but for the most part you will ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ! Watch this on a rainy day when you're not in a serious mood and wish to enjoy the ups and down of a step-family forming.",973036800,5,761,4.375886524822695
7813598,5,6301572793,"A favorite and I was delighted to be able to purchase it on DVD, it was not available for a long time.  I cannot give a specific reason, I just like this film,  It is charming and characters are real, and the adults act ;like adults and there is honesty and make it a pleasant film.  If you get to see it , you will want it in your collection.",1476316800,,343,3.8714285714285714

7813600,5,6301572793,"Divorce and rediscovery.  Rebuilding your life once again.  Introspective film of new allrgiances and letting go of the past.  Jeff Bridges, Farrah-Fawcett, Alice Krige, MacCauley Culkin, Linda Lavin, David Dukes and Theodore Bikel excel.  Psychiatrist meets a pianist's widow.  Moves well and
is both touching and very real.  One of the best of it's kind ever made.",1426204800,,366,5.333333333333333
7813601,5,6301572793,"I ordered this DVD after viewing this movie on television.  If you love happy, romantic, family, interesting and sad all at the same time then this is definitely a movie for you.  I've watched it over and over, probably 100 times or more.  It's my own personal copy and shared with no one!  The cast is super and the dialogue is quick and snappy, also slow and easy at times...no bad language...and Alan Pakula is at his directorial best in developing this story line.  He pulls you into this story quickly and keeps you there, interested throughout...no boring parts just plain healthy entertainment.",1425513600,,601,4.796116504854369
7813602,5,6301572793,A LONG LOST GEM !  This is an excellent depiction of the trials & tribulations of life......the second time around.,1416960000,,115,4.75
7813603,5,6301572793,Is there anything that Jeff Bridges can't do? He is such a diverse actor it isn't even funny. And this was one of his classic examples of what he can do. Good story line of two separate families with their own classic issues to deal with. Jeff sort of jumps out of the kettle and into the frying pan in this one and is torn between his first marriage/wife who is played by the late Farrah Fawcett and his second marriage/wife who is played by the beautiful English actress Alice Krige. He has a lot of baggage he has to sort out if his second marriage is going to be successful or not. But this movie is definitely worth the watch and maybe even a 2nd time too. I feel there are really no dull moments in it. Great supporting cast and very well written as far as diologue is concerned. If I could give this movie 6 stars I certainly would. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.,1330128000,9,880,4.21301775147929
7813604,5,6301572793,"I loved watching this movie!!  Early Jeff Bridges and Farrah Fawcett in top form.  This is one of the Warner Archive movies and the clarity, sound and color on this cd were very good.",1310860800,2,183,4.352941176470588
7813605,5,6301572793,I first saw this movie many years ago but it still remains one of my all-time favorites. I have a tape of it and view it about once a year. I thought the acting was superb (now made more poignant following Farrah Fawcett's demise) and I found it heartwarming.  I think it's a much better film than it generally gets credit for.  I particularly enjoyed the little boy coming to terms with his dead father and the new man in his mother's life.,1245888000,,441,4.301204819277109
7813606,4,6301572793,"I thought about this movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/See-You-in-the-Morning-VHS/dp/6301572793/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">See You in the Morning [VHS</a>], one night while watching something about Farrah Fawcett on TV.  Typically, a flash of the film crosses my memory - and then I Google to find out which movie it was - followed by the old click of the Amazon pages.

And voila!  I had this old flick - from way back when - with another favorite star, Jeff Bridges.  There was no DVD version, but I decided to take a chance on the VHS.

As I watched the movie over again, I was reminded of why I enjoyed it so much back when.  Now it isn't one of those truly amazing flicks...but it is a ""feel-good"" tale of families - families that come together and then are torn apart - and the forces that connect and separate them.

Newly widowed and newly divorced individuals, portrayed by Alice Krige and Jeff Bridges, chart their course through their budding relationship, which leads to marriage too quickly - you see the red flags going up all over the place! - but they are lonely.  And they love each other.  Their blended families bring a host of problems, the least of which is a shoplifting teen daughter and a son who runs away when he learns that his mother and new stepfather have put the home on the market.  This is his father's house!  He protests and creates trouble, but eventually everything is sorted out.

Farrah Fawcett plays a beautiful, seductive ex-wife who makes a play for her ex-husband (Jeff Bridges' character) during her mother's final illness - when everyone is gathered together for a mournful goodbye.

Will the characters finally solve their issues, or will the past eventually eclipse the newly developing connections?

The movie was a little choppy in places, going back and forth too abruptly at times...but all in all, the images conveyed the angst of families in crisis and in flux.  Four stars.
