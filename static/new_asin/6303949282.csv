752448,5,6303949282,"Just bought, and watched, this concert on DVD. Even if it's getting quite old it's still great stuff. To me this is video reflects the best period of MCC's songwriting. The songs are great, the video is well shot, the  atmosphere is great, oh how I wished I ever get a chance to see MCC live.  Well, I guess she's never coming to Sweden so this concert will be playing  alot in my DVD-player.",932601600,2,392,4.27027027027027
752449,5,6303949282,I picked up this MCC video when it first came out and it quickly became one of my favorite concert videos. Mary Chapin-Carpenter is one of the most talented singer/songwriters of today and this proves it.  If you own  most(or all)of her cd's then you should own this video too.  Great stuff.,914803200,,291,4.5576923076923075
7858408,5,6303949282,"As a longtime Chapin fan, I love this concert b/c I used to sing Chapin's music on my Mickey Mouse guitar when I was little & I also used to watch this concert a lot when I was little.

MCC & her band are top-notch & give a stunning performance on this 1995 concert that was filmed at Wolf Trap in Vienna not to long after her ""Stones In The Road"" record came out late 1994.

Bottom line: This concert is so worth it!!! It's a must for any die-hard Chapin fan!!!",1393027200,,462,4.010869565217392
7858409,4,6303949282,"Love this concert and the interviews that accompany it.  Sad that my DVD won't play on my DVD player, but it will play on my computer.  This was not what I expected.  However, the concert is even better than expected.",1392681600,,217,4.375
7858410,1,6303949282,"This is not designed for dvd players in the U.S. Very disappointed. The ad should state this, but instead says, ""Region: Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only.)"" This is false advertising.",1389398400,,181,4.870967741935484
7858411,5,6303949282,"I bought this for my wife who is truly a devoted Mary Chapin fan.  I found this recording to be inspiring and soulfull.  If only I could write songs that spoke to the heart of so many.  Although this recording is 16 years old, it is definitely worth a listen!",1376956800,,259,4.14
7858412,1,6303949282,"I would have loved this because I love anything by Mary Chapin Carpenter.  However, it took me a while to find out it wasn't made for U.S. DVDs.  By this time we'd tried it on every DVD player of everyone we knew.  My son was the one who told clueless me. By the time I was ready to send it back, we were leaving on vacation for a week which put us past the date it could be returned.  So I've had to eat the cost and have a useless unheard DVD.",1372809600,2,445,3.8043478260869565
7858413,2,6303949282,"While the content with the always brilliant MCC was great, the disc only worked on the computer, not the DVD player! Tried it on two machines and the disc worked on neither.
BUMMER!",1368057600,,181,4.515151515151516
7858414,1,6303949282,Disappointed I never got a copy that would play.  I know I would have loved it had I been able to view it,1367798400,,105,3.5652173913043477
7858415,3,6303949282,"I have this on VHS and was thrilled to find it here on Amazon in DVD format. Once it arrived it sat on my desk for about a month. Finally got around to watching it last night and come to find out it's not compatible with any dvd player in my house. MAJOR bummer. The only way I can watch it is on my PC, and even then you have to turn the disc over to get the 2nd half of the concert. There was no warning ahead of time about it not playing on a US dvd player or having to turn it over to be able to have the full show. All in all, the concert, the performance are wonderful, the actual dvd construction, not so much.",1359936000,,617,3.7906976744186047
7858416,5,6303949282,This concert has Mary Chapin Carpenter at her best. She is at her peak and the setting is ideal. It is very nice to see her perform as she creates the wonderful sound. In this case the video only adds to the sound making it more special.,1109203200,2,237,4.0638297872340425
7858417,5,6303949282,"This captures Mary Chapin Carpenter at her best. In beautiful surroundings, MCC is relaxed and loose, laughing and telling stories and interacting with the audience. Watching her perform adds another layer of integrity to her music. There is a good selection of her music and the performance itself is a delight. Interspersed with the music are clips of behind the scenes preparation and interviews with other singers. I think MCC's greatest gift is her ability to connect with those who listen to her; this video makes it all the more evident.",961113600,16,544,4.989010989010989
