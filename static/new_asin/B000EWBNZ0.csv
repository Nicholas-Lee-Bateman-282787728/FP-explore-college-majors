8115035,3,B000EWBNZ0,"The film opens with a Jun Silver's (buxom Atsuko Sakuraba) family being killed after a Japanese Gunnar Hansen impersonator exits the house with a bloody chainsaw. This was pretty good stuff, but that was the last we saw of him.

Silver knows karate, coin tossing, ""wrastling"" FBI stuff, and how to take a shower. She is recruited into the Japanese Secret Service by a former lover to fight perverse criminals outside the law. Their cover will be woman's wrestling which allows them to travel the country without suspicion, although she only had the one fight before dominatrix Nancy finds her out. The bad guy fighting was haphazard as was Dart, Agent 004 who protects her to kill her.

The film appeared to be some kind of kinky soft porn. It included S&M action, hot wax, upskirts, spanking and urination. Silver wears black and silver spandex while fighting. The genitals are pixilated out, including the one being beaten. The kinky subject matter is more suited for hard core porn. You've been warned.

Sex and nudity. Thank you Atsuko.",1400198400,,1040,4.864406779661017
8115036,5,B000EWBNZ0,"Im a huge fan of Takashi Miike. This amazing director cranks out 3 or 4 movies a year. Some don't quite work, some are really good, and some are masterpieces. All are interesting, often perverted, sometimes deep and heartfelt, and usually different than anything youve seen before. His older work tends to be his best, but theres gold in his new stuff too. If you hate crazy stuff, if you hate perversion, if you hate BDSM, if you hate violence, if you hate wild journeys filled with imagination and daring, if you prefer milk and honey to top notch absinthe, then you won't enjoy most of his films. Too bad for you.

Silver is a little film that, oddly, ends just when you're really getting into it. The story is wild, the perversion is copious, and its a jolly good ride. Theres nothing else like it. Not his best, but its still tremendous fun. Ive watched it four times, and Ill certainly watch it again and again as the years roll by (I notice new things on every viewing). Since I cant give it 4.5 stars (which would be my preference), Ill go with the full 5 due to its over the top originality and peddle to the metal insanity.

His best stuff: the Dead or Alive trilogy (exciting and crazy), Zebraman 1 and 2 (wonderful), Gozu (surreal), Happiness of the Katakuris (delightful), Rainy Dog (profound and moving), Visitor Q (bizarre and perverse). In fact, you cant go wrong with any of his yakuza films (hes a true master of that genre).",1398643200,2,1443,4.5038167938931295
8115037,3,B000EWBNZ0,I heard that this was not that good of a Miike movie so I wanted to find out for myself. I thought it was not bad. It was not to easy following the story all the way through but it kept my interest. The end seems to let you believe that they were going to make another one that never happened. As a Miike movie goes they are all different and I would have to say the same here with Silver. I still liked it.,1335484800,,407,3.8
8115038,4,B000EWBNZ0,this was a good movie another one from takashi miike it was interesting it had just about all the things that takashi miike had in his other movie plus female wrestling which was interesting to see in a movie like this.,1213747200,,219,4.365853658536586
8115039,1,B000EWBNZ0,"It seems people have very strong feelings about the Japanese director Takashi Miike. I'm of the camp who believes he's brilliant, but after viewing this I'm beginning to have my doubts.

A female secret service member infiltrates a Lady's Pro Wrestling Team to try and bring down a woman who is using her womanly ways (and then some, if you know Miike) to gain power and corrupt government officials.

It has some interesting fight scenes that are kind of ninja-esque, but I almost cried the whole way through -- it's that* bad*. If you want to see Miike in full form, purchase Ichi the Killer which will establish you as a Miike lover or haterist. However, no matter how* much* you like* Miike, do not get withing seeing distance of this film. If I could unwatch one film, it would be this one. It's that* bad.",1177977600,2,811,4.5479452054794525
8115040,5,B000EWBNZ0,"I love Lilias and anything by her, but I'm going to have to give this tape to my mom or some other senior citizen:  the first half hour, she never even gets out of her chair.  ""Silver"" series must refer to silver  haired.  (I wish Lilias' producers would give better descriptions of the  contents of her many videos, and whom each one is aimed at!)  That said,  like any Lilias Yoga tape, you will feel good while doing it, and even  better afterwards.  This would be a good tape to have in nursing homes,  etc.  And Lilias is a darling.",948240000,71,537,4.27
