So when it became available on DVD, I felt lucky and very satisfied for the way that technology provided us nostalgians out here with alternatives to the old film-rolls, VHS cassettes, vinyl records and so forth. The fact that the DVD had the format of 4:3 and mono sound did not bother me at all than. But, still, last year a new 16:9 format version of the film on yet another DVD apparently became available. A jewel like this deserved to be bought again, I thought, so it could be given full ovation on the new LCD TV and then the extra picture area on the sides seemed tempting as well. So joyous I got hold of a new version and then it went in to the player at least. Quite right; extra material was there at the sides, but something did not add up ... It has been cut over and under!! So then; the 4:3 and the new (?) 16:9 versions have the same total square area, the same sound (fair enough, but sill) and just about the same color quality (the ""new"" 16:9 has got a vague red'ish blur).

This included glorifying rebellious subcultures, full frontal nudity, use of hard drugs, horrific violence, language which included the 'C' word, and Satanism. In 1974, it was so far past the outer edge that the industry shut the door on director Sandy Harbutt and he never made any other films - ever.

8253974,4,B00140PKDW,"Stone is pretty hilarious. It's like Easy Rider mashed up with a lazy police procedural. The vibe the movie has is just shockingly strange because of it. One minute it's an action movie before turning into a road movie, then a drama, then a pro-biker screw society film, a romance, and then doubling back again in no particular order.

The basic plot is that a biker gang has witnessed a crime and now they're being hunted down. In comes Stone. He's the lamest cop this side of the outback but he's the man on the case. He gets sent in undercover to help figure out why things are happening the way they are. It's really a flimsy excuse to just show biker culture after that. I say that cause there's multiple moments in Stone where it's clear they've forgotten the plot. it'd normally be a detriment but it ultimately plays into the narrative and creates a happy accident.

I've been dogging a little on the movie but it's cause like most things in the 70s it's fun to tease it. I enjoy the movie. It's well made, looks good, the performances work for the film, and I can't think of anything else similar to it. In the end, that's the best compliment.",1498867200,,1152,4.429245283018868

8253978,3,B00140PKDW,"The film takes place in Australia in the 1970's. Following a political assassination, the Grave Diggers bike club become targets, Stone (Ken Shorter) a cop joins the group in order to find the killer. They know he is a cop.

The film spends a lot of footage of guys riding bikes with a bad soundtrack. This production was directed, written, and starred Sandy Harbutt and has become a cult classic in his native Australia. It was been compared to ""Mad Max"" but I failed to see any significant similarity,  a comparison I would suggest was created by the promoters and blindly followed by fans.

I thought this was just another era biker's film, nothing special
