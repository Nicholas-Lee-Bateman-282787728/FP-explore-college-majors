7167595,1,B00XFIG2HO,"2 out of 3 do not have subtitles. The Mummy video has no subtitles, and the Llorona video says that it has Spanish subtitles, but it does not. I specifically looked online for the Llorona movie and every other copy that is being sold has subtitles, I am perplexed as to why this one does not have English subtitles and the Spanish subtitles that it says that is has are nonexistent. I teach Spanish - videos with no subtitles are useless to my students. I really hope that I can return these.",1453161600,5,492,4.358695652173913

8715844,4,B00XFIG2HO,"This set includes the first 3 films in the Leyenda series by Anima Estudios. Each film revolves around the famous monsters of Mexican lower mythology. I will say right off the back these films do not compare to the high quality animated classics youd see from Disney or Japans Studio Ghibli.  But it should be noted that Mexicos entrance into the animated film industry is fairly new. Where Japan and the US have a long and rich history of doing animated films. Which is a shame that Mexico took so long to start making animated films; considering Mexico has an amazing culture and very colorful history. So much inspiration for making great animated films. So with that, Anima Estudios has spear headed the effort to bring Mexico into the animated film industry. Starting the Leyenda de Nahaula, you can clearly tell this is the first film in the series. It has a good story, but the animation is not that good nor is the acting. The second film, LLorona, is leaps and bounds better than the first in all departments. And again you see this with the 3rd film, Los Momies, which improves even more. This dvd set makes a great gift for any Spanish speaking child or a gift for someone on Dia de los Muertos. Anima Estudios is quickly building their experience and quality with each emerging project. I look forward to future projects they produce, including their Netfilx series Legends.",1510704000,,1386,4.703703703703703

8715847,3,B00XFIG2HO,"These movies, which are in Spanish, are fun children movies which are always good for the kids but are not great in quality. There are other movies with higher quality in movie making and cartoon characters. The bright side of this is that these movies illustrate the legends and myths that older generations know and love.",1484092800,,323,4.785714285714286

8715849,4,B00XFIG2HO,"arrived super fast in 2 days!! i live in midwest and it came from California in 2 days!!! the only thing is I'm not sure if the dvd's are original because the quality of the print looks like it is a copy, the dvd's work great but still, i'm not sure if they are original the anima studios logo is not clear which it should be in my mind

i don't care about the subtitles they should be entertained and pay close attention to the spanish without the subtitles",1479340800,,458,4.146067415730337
