2879529,4,B000S2XD36,I LIKED THE REAL WIVES OF ORANGE COUNTY.THE SHOW WAS VERY ENTERTAINING. THE ONLY ONE I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE WAS LAURI SHE LOOKED LIKE A WRINKLED CAT WITH A HORRIBLE SURGEON AND TOO MUCH BOTOX. I AGREE WITH THE OTHER GUY SHE TREATED HER CHILDREN HORRIBLY EVEN THOUGH THEY CRIED OUT FOR HELP AND WHEN SHE HOOKED UP WITH GEORGE SHE STARTED TO ACT AS IF SHE WERE BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE. WAS I THE ONLY ONE WHO THOUGHT GEORGE SEEMED A LITTLE FRUITY YOU KNOW ON THE DOWNLOW?,1215561600,,469,4.280898876404494
2879530,5,B000S2XD36,"I love this series. You have Kimberly, who is down to earth and very caring and tugs at your heartstrings. Then you have Jo, the gold digging tramp that makes you want to slap her. It's got everything you want in a guilty pleasure. These women will frustrate you and make you want to stop watching but you can't!",1204243200,,312,4.305084745762712
2879531,5,B000S2XD36,I just kind of got on the RHWOC bandwagon and I love it.  I can't wait until the second season comes on dvd. I just thought hey they are rich they shouldn't really have real big problems.. NOT.. they have the same drama going on as the rest of us.. we may not have all the dough... :) but I still love them..,1203638400,4,308,3.888888888888889
2879532,5,B000S2XD36,"Worth the money and time spent watching.
I can not wait until season 2 is released",1202860800,3,82,4.1875
2879533,3,B000S2XD36,"I had only seen litte snipits of this on cable and it had looked reasonable so I bought this when it went on special.  I'm glad I got it on special because it's not worth a lot.  It's only average at best and I'm disappointed that it wasn't more interesting.  Even Laguna Beach is more interesting than this.
The women in here might call themselves the 'real' housewives, but let me tell you how FAKE they all are.  Botox, implants, bleached blonde hair.  They are all ditzy fake people who, for the most part, rely on their wealthy hard working husbands to keep them in the lifestyle they've become accustomed to.
If you are looking for entertainment, the only entertainment you'll get from this is laughing at their stupidity (one lady puts pink legwarmers on her horse and crystals on it's hoofs - puhleeze).  If this is the example they set for their kids, then it's no wonder that there are shows like Laguna Beach around.",1202428800,4,927,4.554216867469879
2879534,2,B000S2XD36,"Here's an alternative idea: choose some random people, say the reviewers here, give them  lot of money, houses, cars, etc., and follow them for a year. What do you think will happen to them? This would be much more interesting then looking at rich people and discussing what they should do and how. The show follows in steps of many others dealing with the same issue and the only reason for people to watch is that everyone wants to be there themselves.",1199404800,3,454,4.536585365853658
2879535,3,B000S2XD36,"What really makes me angry about this show are the kids! They live in multi-million dollar homes, have everything anyone could possibly want, totally funded by their parents.....except ambition, the most valuable asset they could give their children, not free BMWs!

Easy living kills all ambition in rich kids. Don't think so? Just look at the Ozzie Osbourne spawn! They have the funds and chance to become anything of value in life such as doctors and other high paying professions, but just become slugs and drones, parasites living off their parents well into their young adult years (Tamra are you listening? Kick the young bloodsucker OUT!)

And the women, OH, where to start.

 I did like Vikki, the insurance company owner, at least she works for her money, not marrying it. But in Season 2 her huge mouth which is constantly going started to grate real bad. We have dubbed her ""La Pie Hola Grande"" and every time I think of her I see the gaping, yapping mouth.

JO: A supposedly college degreed woman who can't quite read the instructions on the back of a fast food package, can't sing, wants to sing, but does not know music related terms, has no interest in learning. Her speaking voice peeled paint. I don't think she'd actually make it through the first round of American Idol. She stated on the show, she HATES responsibility. Does not want to raise her rich ex-boyfriend's kids, would rather spend, spend, spend than work, stay out all night, and pretty damned young to be such a serious boozer! She's no doubt searching for her next sugar daddy.

JEANA: A successful working lady with disasterously raised children! Her daughter seems like the only one with manners or ambition of any sort; her old sons are basically large toddlers who bad mouth their mom who just stands there and passively takes it; brutish kids who would rather spend a lifetime of partying and basically being stuck at a 16 y old mentality. I just shriveled up like a bug on a hot rock when she said she bought each kid a million dollar home! What did these parasitical kids do to DESERVE that!!! Talk about the age of entitlement!

TAMMY: A minor train-wreck, but a train wreck. Illegitimate child with boyfriend, one ambitionless bleached blond, tatooed daughter living with a scummy tatooed biker type who breeds pit bulls ( oh, yeah, Riverside, Calif area needs more of THOSE!)

TAMRA: I like her. She has worked for what she has, but parenting skills to oldest son the PITS! Oldest son is 21 going on 14. Homeless, jobless, ambitionless, living on the dole with parents, the hardest part of his day is figuring out what time to wake up. Step-dad Simon really stepped up to the plate and got him into a Mercedes Benz workshop going into sales. He sits at home whining that he has no job because ""opportunity hasn't come his way."" Kid, I have news, opportunity does not find YOU!! You find IT!!!!! Oh, what a hard thing life is for this poor boy! I applaud every nasty dig his step dad gives him for being a slug and drone (Drone: An adult male bee that lives in the hive, does nothing for its keep, while the rest of the hive goes out and makes livings every day.)
Tamra: Do the kid a favor immediately, give the kid a deadline to get ANY job, then kick his lazy a$$ out! You do him no favors and are crippling him. At least Burger King would teach him to get up and out of the house EVERY day. Yes, that's what a job is.

Tamra is married to  joyless Simon who must think smiling causes impotence. He gave her a $40,000 rolex for her 40th birthday. He sells Mercedes Benzes. Note to self do NOT buy a car from this dealership. He's either selling a lot of cars or they're over priced. He also says he can't sell a car unless he has sex every day. Gee the rest of us just have to go to work every day without sometimes. We still are able to do our jobs. What does he do when she's out of town? Guess he doesn't sell anything.

LAURI: Last and least. Nothing about this aging wannabee 27,  47 year old post menopausal woman is authentic! Fake blond hair, fake over done nose and lips, fake breasts. She's on the prowl for a rich husband. With her druggie son who is frantically trying to get her attention by constantly getting in trouble with the law. But mom's so blinded by dollar signs in her eyes, she doesn't seem to see the kid. And the  ambitiousless older daughter who can't even pick up the cat poop in the condo she's sponging off her mom with or even bother to make car payments.  Lauri comes with more baggage than LAX!!

I really wonder if boyfriend is serious about an engagement, or just wants to be on TV and once the series is over, engagement is over. Hurry Lauri, before he finds a younger blond thing with less baggage and gets away!!!! Three words for George: Pre-nup, pre-nup, pre-nup!

As Season 4 approaches here's some clues on what might happen:

Laurie and George's made in Heaven wedding turns into the Marriage from Hell. As it dissolves into a knockdown dragout through divorce court, Laurie has time to audition for the Batman sequel as The Joker, or at least as Mrs. J. She already has the face (attention Nancy Grace, better find out what really killed Heath. Sorry, couldn't resist.)

All of the slug kids are still sitting around waiting for someone to hand them a living.

SEASON 4:

New Golddiggers.

Gretchen: Likeable, pretty, not apologizing for being an obvious G.D. Has a rich sugar-daddy who is dying of cancer. She got him to take her to the jewelry stores before he went to die in the hospital. With all the publicity of the show, she'll find another daddy if this one does not get her to the church on time.

Lynne: Poster girl for WHITE CHICKS GET TOO MUCH SUN!! By the age of her kids, she's probably in her late 40's, looks 54. It won't be long until she's looking like a Kennedy matron, like, say Maria Shriver's mom who resembles a breathing mummy. And like the chubby cougar from last year who they dropped from the show, Lynne is extraordinarily BORING! I don't know why there wasn't someone else in Coto who could have spiced things up a little. I predict this is the LAST season. And that's not a bad thing.",1195603200,30,6154,4.490599820948971

It almost works and you almost get it till it falls.  Another fifty cents.  These shows are what the Brits call a 'lorry load' where they just dump whatever into the camera field and hope it's entertaining.  What you get, then, is some humour, some drama, a lot of bitching (the best part), some old-fashioned gossip, and even some PG13 sexiness.  The problem is that there IS a camera and it isn't invisible or hidden.  How sincerely happy, sad, funny, or sexy could YOU get with a lens recording it for the nation?  Yes, I thought so.

2879581,2,B000S2XD36,"This franchise is amazing. A group of women, either rich or living as though they are, get together and talk about each other, form cliques, bicker, fight and generally behave in the way that normal people do... when they're in junior high, that is. Status is everything to them- without it their lives would be meaningless. They gladly let cameras follow them around and see how shallow and foolish they are. As long as they are on TV, it's all good. The series reveals in all its ghastly detail the fact that it's possible to be wealthy and yet completely emptyheaded.

Why two stars instead of one? Because I have to give credit to whichever genius thought up the idea. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, each with equally vacuous participants and each eagerly followed every week by the viewing public. My wife, who is intelligent, well-read, empathetic (in fact everything these women are not) loves it. This might be the most successful cable franchise ever, and it's based on a bunch of bimbos whose lives are bounded by social 'occasions' and plastic surgery. They have now been immortalised on DVD, no doubt to their complete satisfaction.

The Real Housewives of Orange County is the one that started it all, but now it seems like there the most tame girls. It's a very good show to get into and I got addicted immediately after downloading the first FREE episode on iTunes. Watching this almost six years later shows that so much has changed!!!
I love all of them except Jeanna. In this season she was pretty chill but after awhile she got to me. Shane & Colton need to treat there mom better and Kara displays a good product mom created.
I really admire Lauri! She's such a strong girl and she is a girl that deserves everything. She is a total package; Brains, Looks, and a Great Attitude!
Jo to me is amazing!!! I really like her but most of the reasons why I like her is because I wish I was in her position...EVERYTHING IS TAKEN CARE OF! But I agree with her 100% on why she wanted out.
Kimberly to me is someone I would love to be my mom!! She is a very sweet girl with lots of intentions of making people happy. Her skin condition made me cry when she was looking back on how its affecting both her children and family.

OK, I confess, this series is peculiarly watchable, even enjoyable, but it's those things in spite of rather than because of the cast members, who are unpleasant to the last. Breasts so inflated with saline they surely require back braces to support them? Faces so immobile with injected toxins (""I'm always gonna look 32..."") that to watch one of them try to weep is to witness a statue begin to crumble? I'll take my future wrinkles any day!

Somewhere around episode five it pierced my brain to wonder how someone becomes like these monstrous women. They were once babies, innocent children, youngsters with hopes and dreams and (one presumes) personalities. Now they lack souls and just embody a limitless black hole of cosmetically-augmented avarice. I don't know if this series is shown around the world but if it is then no wonder so many people elsewhere have such a poor impression of Americans. Well, attention world, we're not all like this.
