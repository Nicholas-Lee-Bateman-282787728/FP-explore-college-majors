3883622,4,B002ACJ3GI,"I consider myself to be a somewhat active 45 year old youngin' : play golf every week, 2 mile walk everyday, yoga, some cardio.  That being said...  I couldn't get thru this video the first time!  Phew!  Made it the 2nd time with a couple of breathers.  Good total body workout.  The format is different due to the ""Made for TV"" set-up.  Great instruction from Gilad thru it all.
Very pleased with my puchase!",1308096000,4,409,4.445945945945946
3883623,5,B002ACJ3GI,"All Gilad DVDs are great, it targets defferent muscles all the time, if you are into fitness I really think Gilad's DVDs are the way to go, Thank you Gilad....",1305417600,,159,4.333333333333333
3883624,4,B002ACJ3GI,"I find Gilad to be tough but a fun instructor. This video stays true to his form. He is hard but he is motivational and you feel the results as your working out! He pushes you past your abilities which helps you push through to the next level. I enjoy Gilad and his workout style, as well as the beautiful beach in the background. Very motivational.",1287532800,3,349,4.303030303030303
3883625,1,B002ACJ3GI,very dissapointed with this dvd.  never worked up a sweat because he has taken his tv series and transferred it to dvd along with the breaks that he has on tv show for commericials. can never worked up sustained heartrate. if you have recorded his tv series you have all of this dvds,1280620800,,283,4.339622641509434
3883626,4,B002ACJ3GI,"I've worked out to Gilad's TV exercise programs for a long time, but was always bothered by the commercials.  This eliminates that, and devotes more time to the workout.  I think he's thorough and really keeps you pumped up.",1276819200,6,224,4.717948717948718
3883627,5,B002ACJ3GI,"Dvd came brand new as promised, no problems there.
Description of product is thorough and accurate, and very helpful in the decision to buy.
Gilad'a workouts are effective; you really feel like you got a great workout and at the same time, the exercises are doable. I've been using him for a year and I refuse to workout to anything else.
I picked this dvd because I wanted a longer workout, like the hour long ones on fitTV. This was exactly that, two different 40 minute routines to choose from, and the breakdown is exactly as stated in the product description.",1265673600,25,564,4.594059405940594
3883637,3,B002ACJ3GI,"These are straight off the TV, the breaks are right in between workouts, not really worth it.  Pretty disappointing compared to the other Gilad videos I have which do NOT have ""commercial"" breaks.",1447632000,5,196,4.9393939393939394
3883638,5,B002ACJ3GI,"What can I add to the many positive 5 star ratings? So just writing this review for anyone sitting middle of the fence. Wondering if the should/could start a workout. The time is now!  Gil's approach to working deeply into the muscles is how you get that sculpted look. Gil's workouts have always been very well thought out and choreographed in a way that works your muscles from every facet. The crew is very streamline in their routine and very strong and focused. Ms. K still looking good after all these years. (Darn it, just kidding) The scenery is always breathtaking as this is also very conducive to focusing your mind and enables you to concentrate on your form and completing the workout. There is never any jarring, herky jerky movements that are really detrimental to older ladies like myself lol. So don't hesitate. It's just takes some patience. You'll start to look forward to your workout.",1447372800,,905,4.764331210191083
3883639,5,B002ACJ3GI,"I bought all Gilads dvd's to get back into shape after recent surgery.  It's working extremely well.  Losing inches, getting firm, feeling stronger and losing weight.",1432166400,,166,5.346153846153846
3883640,5,B002ACJ3GI,Gilad truly gives you a total body workout and can be modified to whatever level you want. Own many other DVDs of his.,1428883200,,118,4.173913043478261
3883641,5,B002ACJ3GI,"Nice workouts that target different body parts. Does skip a bit during commercial breaks, so if he says to finish a set you'll either have to sacrifice the reps or pause to get them in. There is a good amount of cardio and strength with an encouraging leader and entertaining ""banter""",1423872000,,284,4.588235294117647
3883642,5,B002ACJ3GI,I really love Gilad and his workout routines.  It is just like it says.....Total Body Workout!  Only problem is that I have bad knees.  There are a LOT of exercises in both episodes that require knee bending.  More so in the first than the second.  I wish he had some tapes especially designed for people like myself but I have yet to come across any.  In the meantime I do what I can modifying the knee action to my comfort level.  I still feel like I get a good workout and enjoy them very much.,1423526400,,497,4.168421052631579
3883643,1,B002ACJ3GI,"this is so boring! I used to love Gilad workouts, but that was many years ago. THese are NOT timeless, and he has done NOTHING to update them, as I had hoped. Horribly boring! DOnt waste your money.",1381968000,,198,4.2368421052631575
3883644,5,B002ACJ3GI,I'm having a great workout experience with this cd. It has two  different workouts on it and I like to switch between the two,1381363200,,125,4.208333333333333
3883645,5,B002ACJ3GI,"I have almost all of Gilads workouts. A strong work out, he does a great job of making sure you are using great form and explaining the benefit to each work out. I'm a huge fan, I do Gilad every week!",1368230400,,200,3.902439024390244
3883646,5,B002ACJ3GI,"I watch Gilad on TV but my cable station no longer carries the show.
Having the tapes are perfect for my morning workouts.",1365033600,,122,4.3478260869565215
3883647,5,B002ACJ3GI,"I started working out with Gilad back when he was doing ""Bodies in Motion"" on ESPN, and then again with ""Total Body Sculpt"" on Fit TV. I still miss Fit TV very much...

But I'm glad I can still get a full workout from this DVD. Lots of variety and energy. I enjoyed this DVD so much that I just bought the other 2 Total Body Sculpt Plus DVDs so I will have more workouts to choose from.

Gilad is the real deal!",1360022400,,411,3.9397590361445785
3883648,5,B002ACJ3GI,I used to work out to Gilad and if Fit-TV hadn't ceased to exist I still would be so I bought this DVD and am thrilled with it. Gilad will kick your butt...in a good way!,1359763200,,170,3.75
3883649,3,B002ACJ3GI,"My wife has been using these DVDs on occasion to work out when she can't get to her regular classes.  She feels these disks are OK, but not really intense enough for her liking.  She uses these DVDs to provide an example, and then she improvises.",1358294400,,246,4.326086956521739
3883650,4,B002ACJ3GI,Product arrived on time.  I recommend this product because it's a good program.  I like that it's in segments but effective.  You can adjust your resistance level accordingly to your fitness level from 1 pound weights to 20 pound weights.  Gilad's cues keep you motivated.,1358121600,2,272,4.977777777777778
3883651,5,B002ACJ3GI,I like this DVD. It is a good workout  in many areas and keeps me very challenged. Has interest and variety. The pace is just right.,1355270400,,132,4.076923076923077

This two  are  working on the all body, and you see results",1347580800,,119,4.363636363636363
3883653,5,B002ACJ3GI,"I loved Gilad on FitTV and does not come on any longer, so loved the DVDs!  I have two different sets:  Gilad Total Body Sculpt Plus (Functional Fitness, Peak Performance, Cutting Edge)- which I like the best... and Ultimate Body Sculpt Series (Cuts & Curves, Power & Grace, Core & More).  They are wonderful as great way to get fit and reach all body parts with a mixture of aerobics, strength training, pilates, yoga, and can fit any fitness program.  Gilad has a great voice, and the team keeps you motivated and inspired!  The best fitness DVDs out there and they work!!!!",1345420800,2,576,4.607843137254902
3883654,4,B002ACJ3GI,"I was a bit disappointed that the cardio portion is just boxing moves, I guess I didn't see that in the product description.  Overall, a 4 out of 5.  If you like Gilad, this is more of the same",1345161600,2,193,3.923076923076923
3883655,4,B002ACJ3GI,"I own the entire 3 dvd set, and each one offers something different. I've had foot surgery, so some of the moves, such as lunges and static lunge where you raise and lower, are difficult for me. I did find that they are much more easily accomplished while wearing shoes. I did find it a bit irritating for the commercial break pitches, but as there are no commercials inserted, the workout is actually ramped up with no breaks (unless you stop the dvd to complete a set or take a break). I am drenched by the end of each show.

Gilad carefully instructs you in the proper form for each move. If you follow it, you won't hurt your knees. Since I began wearing shoes during this workout this dvd is no longer my least favorite of the three.

A wonderful side note: I began this series last January, and lost 7 inches around my waist by April, just 4 months later. I did choose to eat healthier, but did not adhere to any diet. I simply chose healthier foods, and applied myself to these intense exercise sessions. I am stronger, healthier, get hurt less easily and rarely strain muscles any more. At 50 years old, I thank Gilad for providing fitness sessions that work for me!",1335916800,10,1174,4.405529953917051
3883656,5,B002ACJ3GI,"I ordered this DVD because although others I was using were terrific, I knew them by heart and wasn't working as hard during the workouts.  This is an excellent overall, functional fitness workout - made my muscles work in ways they hadn't for a while.  A highly-recommended change of pace from other standard workouts.",1318464000,2,319,4.888888888888889

8359189,5,B002ACJ3GI,"I found Total Body Sculpt on TV when I was in college and Gilad's workouts helped me lose 50 pounds. I always go back to these workouts when I need to get muscle, alignment or balance back. Gilad is a genius. I have many of his fitness DVDS and I love them all, but the Total Body Scuplt series is my favorite! I love him. So silly but the very best motivator and really helps you understand proper form which is critical for any for of movement.",1501027200,,446,4.137931034482759
