1385824,5,B000050ILL,"After reading the otha dudes comment i was very skeptical in buying this movie,but when i saw it @ Sam Goody it was like my calling(I was drawn to the iLL looking cover). But wat the dude(Andrew Strawn i-man)failed to mention is that this is not only the greatest Venom film, but it will also go on every Shaw(Bros) fan's top 10. The movie is long, but the story is so captivating that you easily forget about the time.& to top things off the action in this film is incredible. Seeing the Flag of Iron in action is really a privilage. DOPE ENDING!!! Also the Wu(tang)named their 3rd albulm after this movie,After seeing the ""36th Chamber of Shaolin""im positive Wu-Tang has good taste in movies.

The only thing i can ask of this movie is MORE FLAG ACTION!(its only seen towards the end,but it is a great sight to see)",1253577600,,817,4.446666666666666
1385825,5,B000050ILL,"This is one of my favorite Venom Mob movies, it features the three opera trained Venoms Kuo Chui, Chaing Sheng and Lu Feng. Highlights include Kuo Chui battling his way through a string of asassins and the finale where he takes on Lu Feng. The Shawscope looks great especially in the long shots durring the flag battles where the action fills the screen.

The story does get a bit rediculous, and it runs on too long, but its on DVD so after you watch it once or twice you can jump to the best fights.

Tokyo Shock has done a great job on this disc. I noticed a cool feature I haven't seen a dvd before there is a subtitle track plays durring the english versions that translates the signs on screen. Inclues trailers for Black Magic 2, Ichi the Killer, Ten Tigers from Kwantung (original), Lone Wolf and Cub (tv series), the Flag or Iron trailer from the region 3 release and an original US tv trailer. Anamorphic widescreen, English subs, English mono track, Engish 5.1 track and Mandrin mono track.",1252972800,6,1001,4.4945054945054945
1385826,1,B000050ILL,"This version of Flag of Iron is cut by about 30 minutes.  Get the Celestial uncut version, this is a really good movie when you see the whole thing.",1171152000,,148,4.103448275862069
1385827,3,B000050ILL,"If 5 deadly venoms is a 5 of 5 star rating, this one is a three. Good fights, bad copy(bad tracking at times), voice dubbing was choppy at best. As far as Shaw scripts go this was weak. Good fights though !!",993168000,,207,3.9523809523809526
1385848,4,B000050ILL,"Four out of five might be a LEETLE excessive, but this is a good one. Its only real flaw is the not-so-tight scripting/pacing. Just past the halfway mark, it bogs down into a waist-deep mire - a battle of wits between the film's villains and protagonists, each waiting for the other's next move. And anticipating. And waiting. But then one of the best Venoms end fights saves it from disaster.

While it's easy to spot the slowest 25 minute stretch of the movie, several scenes throughout overstay their welcome. I'm used to Ni Kuang's scripts being a lot more streamlined, but this felt padded to its 2 hour runtime. A more typical 1.5 hours would have kept things moving briskly, so I have to wonder what director Chang Cheh and his crew were shooting for. Maybe a more ""serious"" movie? The intensity of the fights and the bizarre weapons (abacus of DOOM!) and uniforms, especially those of the Iron Flag Clan, give the action sequences a KID WITH THE GOLDEN ARM feel (with much tighter fight choreography), but the cat-and-mouse between Lu Feng and Kwok Choi keep things from having the same wildly fun atmosphere. Again, however, that end fight finishes things on a high note.

This is one of the three Shaws that I remember well from my childhood (along with 5 DEADLY VENOMS and KID WITH THE GOLDEN ARM - all Venoms flicks), although I saw it as SPEARMAN OF DEATH. It's great to see it in this restored version - just use the slow parts to talk with other members of the audience and maybe get some snaction. Drinks with little flags in them, too, maybe.

As always, Chiang Sheng rocks. You'll believe a boy can fly.",1384905600,2,1621,4.582758620689655
1385849,5,B000050ILL,In a word...Fantastic!!! One of the best Venom movies ever (period). The suspense of this flick was of the chain.,1377475200,,113,4.7
1385850,5,B000050ILL,shame on me for never having watched this movie before lol. i'm glad i did though. it's awesome. that is all.,1300233600,,109,4.238095238095238
1385851,3,B000050ILL,"I just saw this movie and I have to say I was disappointed. There is too much talking and very few action scenes dispersed in between ""the plot"". We all know that a Kung-Fu movie should be about..well, the King-Fu, and there is too little of it here. They tried too hard to explain a simple betrayal-revenge story, the details of which were obvious from the first 5 minutes. Seriously, I figured out who the villain of the story was in the first 5-10 minutes.

Whatever fighting scenes there are, are really good, as they always are with the ""Venom Mob"" guys (or half of them anyway), but I would have liked to see a lot more of them. Crippled Avengers, Kid with the Golden Arm, and Invincible Shaolin are much better movies of this genre.

The picture quality and sound are excellent. No problems there.

Bottom line, a decent 70's Hong Kong action movie, but definitely not great one, much less a classic. I would recommend a rental, it's not good enough to be in your Kung-Fu collection.",1291420800,2,990,4.5195530726256985
1385852,5,B000050ILL,Movie was clear didn't have to wait too long for the movie to come to my home. I'm looking forward to order my next kung-fu classic.,1286841600,,132,4.115384615384615
1385853,5,B000050ILL,"One of the best Chang Cheh revenge movies!  I really enjoyed the backstabbing, inventiveness, & plot twists of this movie.  Great performances by members of the Venom Mob.

The Tokyo Shock release is the way to go, for sure!",1276905600,,224,4.6923076923076925
1385854,4,B000050ILL,"This is, finally, the remastered real deal from Tokyo Shock; man, what a difference! Previously only had a taped from TV version, minus nearly 30 minutes of footage; then the widescreen NS version, again missing nearly 30 minutes of footage (grrr!) Also, only in an English dub (snarl!). I know plenty of fans like the dubbed version, and that's fine, but the voices on this dub suck royally. Plus, the translation for the dub is incoherent in spots, but I digress. This Tokyo Shock version is restored, uncut at 113 minutes, widescreen, subtitled AND has the lame English dub. Aside from the usual Tokyo Shock extras, look for the ""Easter Egg"" (the opening credit sequence from the U.S. ""The Spearman of Death"" version.)

Despite missing Lo Mang & Sun Chien, this has the core Venoms; Kuo Chui, Lu Feng, Wang Li, Chiang Sheng (who I read may have been a co-director on this one) & the underrated Yu Tai-Ping, sharing the spotlight with the ""White Robed Rambler"" Lung Tien-Sheng in a Chinese chivalry knight film. As usual with the Shaws & the maestro Chang Cheh; opulent, ornate sets; colorful costumes; great performances/ characters (the Ten Assassins) & awesome hard-hitting fu. The succession of fights Kuo has with the Assasins in the middle of the film are great, but that's just a warm-up for some amazing fu during the finale.  Unique and esoteric choice of weapon in the flag-draped spears (possibly been inspired by the end fight in Chang's own ""Life Gamble"".)  A must-buy, period.  Now, what's the deal with my favorite Venom picture, ""The Kid With the Golden Arm""?  DO NOT tease me with that December 29th release date!",1261612800,5,1632,4.835125448028674
1385855,5,B000050ILL,"For 113 minutes, it moves fast, and it survives more than a few plot contrivances (Lu Feng's character thinks he can buy off Kuo Chui's character with money and a house via ""winnings"" from gambling. What you talkin' 'bout, Lu?!). With only three ""Venoms"", however, the viewer is not cheated as plenty of other fine performers handily fill in the void. Go to others for plot details, though special mention of the opening sequence that goes from a brothel to a gambling house is a fine comedic moment that shows an influence from (of all people) the Three Stooges! Trust Brother Fang when he says this movie glistens (in red and black, mostly); another superior presentation by Tokyo Shock (and don't forget Celestial's jaw-dropping restoration)....Did I mention the ""easter egg""?",1254873600,,779,5.0
1385856,4,B000050ILL,"First off,
Dont buy Panmedia/Red Sun/Banzai/Yin Yang. Those are bootlegs. Before Dragon Dynasty, Image, or Media Blasters(Tokyo Shock), they would rip off the video from the IVL versions and add in the English dubs. Celestial Pictures are the owners of the Shaw Brothers titles and license their titles out to various companies. Now that I got that out of the way, the movie itself is one of my favorite Venoms films. If you liked Masked Avengers, you will probably like this. It's not breaking any new ground but there are cool villains introduced and the use of a flag as a weapon is unique. As always, the fight choreography is top notch in any Venoms films. The plot is basically anchored by a ""who killed my master"" motif, peppered with betrayal and revenge. The Media Blasters version is the best version of this movie to date. The subtitles are better than the IVL ones, there is an inclusion of the original English Dub for you illiterates, and the picture is progressive. This DVD lacks relevant extras.",1254614400,15,1012,4.755681818181818
1385857,5,B000050ILL,"This is a classic thats always been cut when it was made available in Dvd format. Finally this shaw brothers classic starring the venoms is restored to its original uncut form. Its been a long time in coming and I for one am estatic. This is definately my favorite in the venom series. The Iron Flag are an honorable and righteous clan, but once their master is murdered, foul play is suspected. Its up to Iron Panther and Iron Monkey to discover wether there is a traitor in the clan. Actions abound with beutifuly choreographed flag fighting. This ones a must if your a venom fan.",1254009600,,582,4.5

7929033,5,B000050ILL,"This is definitely a kung-fu theater must see! Lots of weapons, fighting, a good story of betrayal and revenge, good vs. evil, a little humor, and loyalty and brotherhood. I've watched a ton of these movies and although there are plenty of gems a lot of them fall flat when it comes to an overall total package. Thankfully, this one is definitely a must see!
