8554396,3,B00AMXSFWK,"There is a music video at the beginning of this movie that is over the top obscene. It's almost too much to watch. Its actually one of the reasons I gave this movie to my friend..And then he didn't want after seeing it. Ha. The movie wasn't bad, but not that great, and not worth me hanging onto because of said music video. I'd hate to die and someone find this in my collection and think wtf..lol. Thats saying a lot too because I do have some offensive weird stuff in my collection.",1429833600,,485,4.225806451612903
8554397,5,B00AMXSFWK,"This is not for the faint of heart, but the hate of fart will embrace it. Luis Bunuel and John Waters walk into a bar. Ouch!

Yes, expect the ridiculous. Cartoon violence. Sexist s***, we are all a misogynist. Evil Dead meets Evil Dead 2.

I don't know many people who like this film. The one I expected did. Everyone else questioned my judgment.

When the drinking water goes bad, society collapses. That is the kernel of truth here, taken to tasteless comedic extremes.

If you're offended by this, it's only because you've been conditioned to react a certain way.

Otherwise, this film experience is very liberating.",1427328000,,619,4.747663551401869

8554399,4,B00AMXSFWK,"I actually purchased THE TAINT before the film was signed over to Troma, snagged it for $5 and I would have easily paid twice that after seeing it. When this release was announced on Troma, I immediately put in my pre-order. I had to order the Blu-ray for this hilarious little indie production. Sure, I own 3 copies of this film now...it's just that fun.

THE TAINT is gory, offensive and laugh-out-loud funny. If your idea of entertainment is crude jokes, rubber genitals, exploding heads (see rubber genitals), more exploding heads, an amazing '80's style work-out montage, a wild face-ripping and an insane concept matched only by BLACK DYNAMITE's. Everything about this film is fun, from the gorgeous artwork to the impressive original synth score. This is what GOOD indie genre cinema is all about.",1372204800,5,804,4.955555555555556
8554400,5,B00AMXSFWK,"In recent years, the trend of grindhouse revivalism has spread like wildfire throughout the fringes of the film industry. It seems like, since the Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez anthology film ""Grindhouse"" brought the term, and the style, back into view, contemporary takes on the cheesy, over-the-top spectacle of the midnite-movie fare of the 1970s and 80s have begun popping up with an increased frequency. This new crop of grindhouse features differs from the old guard--low-budget limitations have been augmented by a deliberate tongue-in-cheek attitude, a knowing irony that deconstructs the style as it lovingly pays homage. Sometimes, this knowing irony falls flat, becoming too self-aware and too self-referential to be funny--but in the best cases, it only improves the film in question, adding a deep dimension of comedy to the surface, creating greater capacity for laughs and spectacle than even the heights of the style's original peak period.

The Taint, directed by Dan Nelson and Drew Bolduc and distributed by Troma Entertainment, is a great representation of when this type of film is done right. With a plot that lends itself to untold hilarious possibilities (it envisions a society in which men have turned into twisted, misogynistic barbarians by way of a taint in the water supply,) some very clever writing, deliberately over-the-top scenarios, and aesthetic sensibilities that update the exploitation-shockers of old without appearing trite or handed-down, The Taint is an incredibly solid seventy minutes of tight, campy fun. It has humor that's as dirty as it is clever, imagery that's as shocking as it is hysterical, practical effects that amaze with their ingenuity, and an atmosphere that stays fresh and original even while putting its influences on display. With appropriately-tasteless male nudity, and plenty of blood and guts on display, it's certainly not for the faint-of-heart, but for lovers of modern grindhouse reinventions along the lines of Hanger, Hobo With a Shotgun or Father's Day, it's definitely a treat to watch.

As is typical with Troma releases, the package is well put-together beyond just the feature itself. The package, which comes with both DVD and Blu-Ray copies of the film, is adorned with beautiful cover art, and makes a great shelf-piece for collectors. There are also plenty of special features to enjoy after the film is over, including some great deleted scenes, commentary tracks from the directors and the cast, behind-the-scenes photos, and several trailers. Everything is crisp and pleasing to look at, and while the sound in the main feature is occasionally inconsistent, it's better than one might expect for a low-budget film. Troma has spared no effort in putting this package together, and it absolutely shows. It may not appeal to most viewers out there, but if you're looking for some tasteless schlock that's surprisingly intelligent and extremely funny, The Taint comes highly recommended.",1372204800,5,2975,5.36830835117773
8554401,1,B00AMXSFWK,this movie is a Awesomely bad movie. It sucks SOOOOOO much that it's fall down funny. It's very over the top awful. So if you have a soft spot for the terrible side of movies get this because it could be the greatest piece of crap ever.,1365984000,3,236,4.042553191489362
8554402,5,B00AMXSFWK,"""The Taint"" is 70 minutes of pure unbridled, gory, reprehensible trash that also happens to be quite clever and a lot smarter than you might expect. When I first heard about this low budget independant Richmond, Virginia lensed film and checked out some positive reviews around the internet, one particular quote from the Fangoria.com review stated ""The Taint is exactly what happens when smart filmmakers intentionally make a stupid movie."" The basic plot involves an experimental penis enlargement drug that turns men into oversexed misogynistic maniacs is unleashed into the public water supply and all manners of depravity cut loose.

Considering how miniscule the budget was, it's actually made well from a craft standpoint with the over the top gore being quite hilarious and impressive in many spaces. As I mentioned at the ouset of this review, the run time is just barely over 70 minutes with end credits so the movie doesn't overstay its welcome at all. It's very obvious why Troma picked the film up for distribution due to the copius amounts of male nudity, gore, bodily fluids flying about and extremely warped and politically incorrect sense of humor that permeates every moment of the film. Women may find this movie to be unwatchable but should recognize it as well done satire that isn't meant to be taking at face value at all.

It's exploitation filmmaking at a highly enjoyable level that should prove to be a huge hit among brave cinephiles who like their cinematic trash  to be a complete assault on good taste and decency while also exhibiting a level of talent and craft that makes me very interested in what the filmmakers plan on doing next.

The blu-ray DVD combo pack from Troma presents the movie in excellent 1.78 anamorphic widescreen that is very clean and detailed particularly on the blu-ray edition. The audio is regular 2 channel lossy stereo but everything sounds fine. Extras include two commentary tracks, some deleted scenes, a behind the scenes slide show and the usual Troma trailers too.

Highly recommended!",1363737600,9,2051,5.002932551319648
8554403,5,B00AMXSFWK,The Taint is an independent film from Richmond Virginia made by Drew Bolduc and Dan Nelson and some of their friends and other actors. It's a hilarious horror comedy about a penis enlarger medicine that gets released into the water system. And if a male drinks the water he turns into a misogynistic  maniac trying to murder as many women as he can. One man Phil O Genny Hasn't yet drank the water and is the only one who has a chance of surviving the terrible condition of becoming a raging misogynistic person. This is an amazing cult feature with allot of funny scenes and allot of great gore  and I'm glad Troma bought it . It is one of my favorite movies of all time and it's a great horror movie.,1361145600,9,702,4.3106060606060606
