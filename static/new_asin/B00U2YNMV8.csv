8704109,5,B00U2YNMV8,"quite informative, I was expecting more of a movie type recoreding which it is not. It is more on the order of taking a class, but it was very informative. Worth buying.

8704113,3,B00U2YNMV8,Wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be. Maybe because I have heard most of this info before.,1446854400,2,100,4.315789473684211
8704114,5,B00U2YNMV8,"I thought this would fun to watch.  This DVD is some guy giving a lecture. There is a small amount of ancient history and a HUGE amount of speculation.  For entertainment, get a copy of Ancient Aliens or an old X-Files DVD.  Unless you are a true believer in UFO's, this is not for you.

I was disappointed with this DVD but, I'm not part of the target audience. The entertainment factor is low. Imagine being in a classroom and a professor of ufology is giving a lecture, that is this DVD.  If that is what you want, then this DVD deserves five stars.  If you want a fun si-fi movie to watch while having pizza and beer, one star.",1441584000,3,631,4.216666666666667
