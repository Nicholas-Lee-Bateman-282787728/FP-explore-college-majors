7949366,5,B00005PJ86,Might be a bias due to nostalgia but this was in the regular rotation for pre-session surf vids and lunch breaks back in the day. Good raw footage and a few laughs.,1297468800,,164,4.15625
7949367,5,B00005PJ86,"Ok, this is not an attempt to make you laugh, Idiot. Thats right Mcnamara. Ok, there might be a couple skinny guys in it. But they can all kick your pussy Arse. You are such a poser if you think your a ""surfer"". Is insulance your middle name? Real surf classic for all time.
P.S. Even those girls in the movie can woop you. ""Remember, if you mess with the bull, you get the horns"".",1228867200,,381,4.093333333333334
7949368,5,B00005PJ86,"This is one of my very favorite surf movies. Sure it's not Morning of the Earth, but it was released in 2001 and not in the 1970's. The skits are cool, it makes it feel like your in a drama class with part of the WCT, except it's actually cool fun.. even funny.

I really enjoy the surfing in it. I think it's about nice clean, good sized waves and smooth moves more than absolute ball tearing sections of hate and 720 judo airs.

Even in 2007 this is probably my favorite one to throw on and watch again, even after seeing it HEAPS of times. I've being trying to buy the cd soundtrack of it for 6 years now. So yeah, it's good.",1174953600,,628,4.056451612903226
7949369,1,B00005PJ86,"Taylor Steele is the most overrated director in the world of surfing.  Here's another example of his tired attempt to be 'cool' in the world of surfing.  I'm sure he has the right attitude to get along with all of those surfers, but he has no sense of art, story, direction, mood, music AND waves!  This was tough to sit through and I returned the DVD immediately!  Buyer beware.",1138492800,2,379,4.449275362318841
7949370,3,B00005PJ86,"This movie is not as bad as I thought it was going to be. ... I bought it ... because it contains the current surf stars like Rob Machado and Kelly Slater. I was expecting the sketches between the surfing to be really lame but I must say they're a lot better than I thought they'd be. They are actully entertaining (the first time you see them). In fact, two of them (mechanics with Chris Malloy, and the pizza delivery guy) were quite funny.
The surfing is ok, but it's your run-of-the-mill surf movie with adrenalin-pumping grunge music which I can't stand. I only own 4 surf movies so I actually longed for more artistic shots like water shots, etc. Especially annoying to me is the lack of any slow-motion shots.
It's still an ok movie to watch when it's flat and you're bored. But if you already own Hit and Run you might want to pass on this one, it's the same thing basically, they're both Taylor Steele movies with the same surfers.
Now if you want the best surf movie of the last 30 years, run to get a copy of September Sessions! Get the DVD which has extra footage and The Making Of. It might be a little pricey since it lasts only 26 minutes, but it's well worth it.",1020470400,3,1178,4.286995515695067
7949371,5,B00005PJ86,"it has all a surfer wants to see. taylor steele has put together the best surfers in the world , surfing great waves, and the movie also has a plot. it's a classic.",1006992000,3,164,4.0
