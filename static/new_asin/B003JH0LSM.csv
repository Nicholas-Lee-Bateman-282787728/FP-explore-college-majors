4129603,4,B003JH0LSM,"This is a great DVD. Jeff Loomis is an amazing musician. In this DVD he breaks down several solo's and some killer riffs as well. He plays them at full speed then slows it all down for us to understand exactly what is going on.
I am hoping you already know how to play because there is some advanced technical picking and fingering going on from time to time.
From his killer melodic sense to his brutal diminished attacks, anyone can learn something new here. Take little bits and pieces of what Jeff is teaching and add it to your own playing.

I gave this DVD a 4 star rating because I was really hoping he would have broke down at least one song from start to finish....so we could have a better understanding of how he builds a song but....he does get us pretty close.

If you are looking to improve your playing and want to add something new to your arsenal, buy this DVD....I did!",1292976000,9,887,4.3053892215568865

8398087,5,B003JH0LSM,"RICHNESS OF CONTENT
Jeff Loomis is one of those modern and progressive metal guitarists who can fly about the fingerboard with such ease that it makes us mortal musicians seem were in for some serious lessons, which we are.  This 41 lesson double DVD set urges a guitarist forward and to a different level, since you need some considerable chops in order to make best use of the applications and scale usage.
As the title indicates, the focus is on dissonant scales and arpeggios, which means there are some very dark and high-tension developments, which sound best when played quickly and fluidly.  Initially this is not the case as Loomis tackles more melodic concepts, such as the harmonic minor scale.  As with subsequent lessons, Loomis integrates the scale into actual compositions off his albums, including Shouting Fire at a Funeral, Psalm of Lydia, Jato Unit and This Sacrament.
Next Loomis considers the whole tone scale as you work scale patterns and then learn how he uses it in Opulent Maelstrom.  Tension then increases more with his diminished scale and arpeggio patterns as he sweeps, taps and riffs through general examples, but also select instrumentals off his albums to demonstrate how the ideas fit within the realm of composition.
Lesson concepts become more interesting as he applies various arpeggios from several of his recordings, while using effective examples of octaves, string skipping, modal climbing and minor runs.  He ends the lessons with ten thematic and complete lead lessons from nine of his compositions.

STYLE
Jeff Loomis is certainly a down-to-earth person and very seemingly humble.  This makes his teachings welcoming, as though you are sitting down with a friend who also happens to be a darn good guitarist.  Rock House Method appears to select their artists wisely, leaving behind the egomaniacs and focusing on solid lessons with people you want to get to know better, and Loomis fits the bill.  This DVD set also reflects what Rock House Method likes to do: learn theoretical concepts, but apply them within the context of a composition so that a lesson makes sense beyond mere memorization.  I find this creates an atmosphere of hey, I know how to play this scale, now all I have to do is make it interesting.  Certainly that takes some creativity, and Loomis does well to show how to alter patterns and syncopation to do just that.

OVERALL IMPRESSION
This definitely is an advanced DVD, since you need to build some good chops and finger coordination to make many of the dissonant patterns sounds fluid and logical to the ears.  That is nothing new.  It is one thing to throw in the occasional odd sounding note, to have it resolve to a more pleasant sounding note, and quite another to string along many of them before resolving effectively.  Jeff Loomis is a master at doing so and he makes it seem so easy, which helps to motivate lesser guitarists to start practicing in order to create that modern metal, high-tension, progressive sound in music composition.",1466726400,,3015,4.930830039525691

The DVD shows everything super slow then full speed. He shows how he applies the leads over backing tracks too. I learned so much from this program. The tablature book and support web site are icing on the cake and really make this an amazing program!",1321747200,7,425,4.756756756756757
