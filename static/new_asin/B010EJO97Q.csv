8722231,4,B010EJO97Q,"I just received this movie set in the mail yesterday, and I wanted to make sure that everybody knows about this... The front cover of this set states it includes the movie ""Trapped"", however, the back cover states it includes a movie called ""King Of Paper Chasin"". The back cover film was the one on the actual set, as that movie was on the DVD menu, alongside the actual content included. I'm unsure as to why this is the case, however, I'm not sure if there is the chance that they did produce this specific movie pack with the Trapped movie on it. Honestly, though, according to reviews on Amazon, alongside 2 other popular movie rating sites, King Of Paper Chasin' is actually a better movie than Trapped is. I also want to state in this review that if you buy this movie pack, be aware that there is brutal violence, excessive strong language and very strong sexual content included. Even just flipping through the chapters to check the video quality out (Because there are 4 movies on each disc, which there are 2 of) showcased it all. Strangely, there is a movie called ""The Genesis Code"" included on this action set, which is a faith based film. Yes, a faith based movie on an action movie pack. Which contains everything you would need to get pretty much an NC-17 rating from the rest of the entire set, except 'possibly' Storming Juno. This is all from just peeking at this set. A few small extras: The back cover is purple. And the discs are purple. But the front is supposedly red. Strange. I also like the music choices on the menu screens. And the visual quality is not great. But again, 4 movies onto a single disc. The bitrate seems higher on most of these movies compared to an Echo Bridge movie pack, however, compression seems to vary based on the movie. I know one of them was very compressed, and looked pixelated, but I forgot which. Some noise in dark areas is also present. Overall at first impressions, this is a good movie pack, if you want movies on the cheap, you can deal with compression, you can deal with the mature content available and you can bypass the manufacturer mistake. You do have Sean Bean, Dolph Lundgren and Lou Diamond Phillips available as your movie stars here, however, they're not in the higher rated movies on this set. In fact, Dolph Lundgren's movie is the lowest rated movie available in this movie pack. Regardless, I like this movie pack. The reasons I gave this 4 stars was because the misprint on the packaging (The movie is not what the front cover shows), the falsely advertised 5.1 surround sound (Which was expected to be a lie...), the ""More than expected"" mature content (Excessive strong language and strong sexual content) and the inclusion of a movie that should not be here, which is The Genesis Code. I will give my opinions on the movie pack in full, when I complete it's viewing. Thanks for reading this review, and I hope it influences your decision on whether or not you decide to purchase this set.",1515456000,2,2972,4.567415730337078
