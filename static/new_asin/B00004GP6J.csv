7920373,5,B00004GP6J,Great Video by Loretta. She is always a hoot. If you want a really good laugh make sure you get this one.,1403568000,,105,3.8181818181818183
7920374,4,B00004GP6J,"I purchased this video because its description said she helped people cope with stress through humor. I have a lot of stress in my life and began watching this video in the morning while getting ready for my day. She is truly enjoyable and addresses serious issues of stress and anger with gentle humor. She doesn't CURE stress, but she sure helps to alleviate it. She offers humor with a purpose. I would recommend any of her videos. They are all good.",1298851200,,453,4.536585365853658
7920375,5,B00004GP6J,"I have all 4 of Loretta's videos. They all make me feel good by laughing.  I play about 15 minutes of them in the Chronic Pain Support Group I  facilitate and we have a great time.  It seems people age 32 and younger  don't enjoy her as much as those of us in our 50's and older.  I find that  I can watch this tape at any point-beginning, middle near the end and it  doesn't matter--I get a great message every time. Keep On Keeping On! I  agree with her to stop Global Whining!",965001600,14,479,4.0212765957446805
7920376,4,B00004GP6J,"I totally enjoyed this video mainly because of the way in which she states the obvious!  People tend to get so caught up in the day to day problems that we forget to see the humor in life.  What she says may seem obvious to  some, but I for one need to be reminded to stop and smell the roses.  They  say laughter is the best medicine, so try it!  You just might feel better  for it.",953942400,9,383,3.896103896103896
7920377,2,B00004GP6J,"I just know about this because my mom is a fan.  I myself found her solutions to stress a little simplistic.  I don't need to get a video to tell me to not treat life so seriously.  I've been following her brilliant  ""revelations"" for years w/out any help.",951004800,4,256,4.270833333333333
