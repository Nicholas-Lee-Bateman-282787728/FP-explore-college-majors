8157967,5,B000KL655I,"A sobering yet grisly glimpse into the dark heart of post-colonial South Africa in the immediate wake of the dismantling of apartheid.

This film is not for the feint of heart, and is not recommended for younger viewers; however it is strongly recommended by this reviewer in general because it remains as poignant and relevant as ever even 4 decades after its original release--especially in this our ""enlightened"" modern age where forced diversity is hailed as the ultimate virtue for the historically homogenous peoples of the west.

The film is marked by a visceral intensity that many will find cringe-worthy.  But perhaps that is precisely what makes the film so powerful.  Its brutal honesty with the viewer candid enough to sit through it with an open mind unfettered by the shackles of political correctness or daunted by Marxist mantras begs the question in an age where mass immigration is promoted to suicidal extremes of what exactly we are importing into our lands--and lends a context to the poetic words of Kipling about ""lesser breeds without the law"" that somehow still endures the stigma of superficial pejoratives with strong sociopolitical implications commonly employed to derail open discussion of such issues before ever they can be endeavored.

If you find yourself troubled by all that you will read if you research this film further about how controversial it was even in the 60's, consider that it has been aptly pointed out before that it is only the smallest secrets that need protection.  For the big ones are protected by public incredulity.",1428969600,,1573,5.054054054054054
8157968,4,B000KL655I,"The Director's Cut of Africa Addio gives a first hand account of the birth of modern Africa as it moved away from colonial rule. I have written another review on the English version of the same film in wich I described the film as brutal yet beautiful.

The Director's cut runs about fifteen minutes longer and lingers over the horrors of war and the destruction of the African game reserves in more depth. There have been accusations leveled at the  directors that much of the violence in the film was staged for the benefit of the camera: these issues must be resolved by the individual viewers.

As hard as this film is to watch it is well wortn seeing. Jacopetti and Prosperi take the viewer down a road seldom traveled and the experience is eye opening. Blue Underground is to be commended for this release. It presents a little seen film in a great edition at will leave its audienec shocked and awed.",1340928000,,907,4.552147239263804
