541319,4,6303026982,"This was a funny film, Ranma and co. have to head to China when, true to series form, Akane is kidnapped, and once more by a guy named Kirin who wants to(what else?) marry her, so it's up to the usual gang(and thankfully, Ukyo's not with them, she only makes a brief appearance), along with their reluctant ally Laichi, who is ticked off at Happosai, because Kirin was supposed to marry her, but he mistook her for Akane, as well as her elephant, Jasmine, and save Akane from him!  There's a bit more humor than action in this one, and the fight scenes in the 2nd film are a bit better, but it's still worth at least checking out.  It also has one of the rare times Soun uses his infamous, ""Demon Head,"" form in the anime, plus also features a HUGE chase scene at the beginning with nearly every character to ever appear in the series, including Mikado, Asusa, Ryoga's dog, the Dojo Destroyer, Gosunkugi, Dr. Tofu, the Gambling King, the little pork and bean bun-headed guys that wanted the Dragon Whisker, the Ghost Cat Maomolin, and more!  I also think the end theme, ""It's Love,"" by Rabbit, is also pretty catchy!  Although people not familiar with the series may not know what's going on, if you're a Ranma fan, I recommend you check it out!",1077926400,2,1245,4.47136563876652
541320,5,6303026982,"I thought this movie was great!  BIG TROUBLE IN NEKONRON CHINA was a great movie for the Ranma  series and it was also very funny!
It starts out as a ""normal"" day in the neighborhood when panty thieving Master Happosai comes back for a ""visit"" to the Tendo dojo.  But he's not alone!  After years of searching for him, a young Chinese girl, Lai Chi and her elephant, Jasmin have followed him all the way back to Japan.  She's angry about a scroll that was given to her family and passed down many generations because it was said that the scroll brings luck to the holder of it.  After taking her hands off of it for a second, the prophecy comes true and a Prince comes to find and marry the one who holds the scroll, and by pure luck Akane has the scroll.  She gets kidnapped by Kirin and the 7 Lucky Gods Martial Artists and now it's a race to follow them to China and save Akane before she gets married to Kirin. It's up to Ranma, Ryoga, Mousse, Shampoo, Mr. Tendo, Mr. Saotome, Happosai and Kuno to save her and defeat the Seven Lucky Gods.
This is a great movie for the Ranma series.  It's very funny, the story is great and all of your favorite characters are in this one.  Along with a great soundtrack, BIG TROUBLE IN NEKONRON CHINA is a necessary component to any Ranma fan's collection.  Plus Lai Chi is hilarious.  She is really funny.  Happosai's ""usual antics"" are pretyt funny as well, like when Ryoga and Happosai get into it on the boat to China.  And of course, the Seven Lucky Gods weren't bad either.
Definitely check out this movie, it's very worth it and it's great for any Ranma collector.  Also check out the special OAV series and the second movie RANMA  NIHAO MY CONCUBINE.  I do warn you that if you aren't up to speed with the series, you might want to catch up a little and check out TV Series 1 and the ANYTHING GOES MARTIAL ARTS series otherwise some things might not make all that much sense.  Either way it goes, you'll enjoy this one.",1044403200,4,1966,4.313351498637602
541321,5,6303026982,"This movie was funny! I have seen four times and I still find it hillarious! There was not a lot of blood, but more than in the books. Ranma's voice sound way different in this than the other shows. You have to make sure to watch ALL of the vidoe at the end! You need to know the plot of the series before you start, or you'll be weirded out. If you don't want an obession that will take over your whole life, I suggest you stop now. Ranma Nibun No Ichi is the best thing around! I'm dying to go to Nerima, Tokyo to meet everyone! (Incase you haven't noticed I have I thing for Ryouga....)",1040774400,,589,4.042735042735043
541322,4,6303026982,"The only reason I am rating this a 4 is because the supporting characters that would do just about anything to beat Ranma, or make him look bad, or just enjoy the simple sight of watching him lose a fight, end up acting like his cheerleaders towards the end of the movie, and I am sorry but Mousse, Ryouga and a few others would *NOT* cheer for Ranma in a fight.
Anyway, the story has almost every main character ever introduced to the series in it, and quite a few that are new or seldom seen, and the additional bonus of a new character named Jasmine who hails from China and has a large grudge against Happosai, and a large elephant to back her up.
The story then moves to China as Ranma and the gang chase her abductors (yes *sigh* - Akane gets kidnapped again, by another idiot that wants to marry her).  These abductors happen to be VERY powerful, and very elusive martial artists from China, and the battle for Akane gets hot and heavy towards the end.
Overall I liked this Ranma 1/2 movie, even though it was a tad predictable.  But part of what makes Ranma 1/2 a winning formula is using the bits that work.  So you can't blame Takahasi and Viz for making the first Ranma 1/2 movie released in theaters a bit fomulaic.  The second movie is much better, if also a little cookie cutter.",1006560000,,1293,4.330578512396694
541323,5,6303026982,"This is the first theatrical release in the Ranma 1/2 series, featuring a high school boy who turns into a busty girl when doused with cold water, and back in hot water.
First, the movie. While not as good as the second one, it's still funny and gives one of the best minor characters, the lecherous martial-arts master Happosai, a chance to truly shine. Happosai's scheming leads to Akane (Ranma's reluctant fiancee) being kidnapped by a prince who wants to marry her, and the entire gang (plus Lychee, the bride originally intended for the prince, and her pet elephant Jasmine) have to set out for Nekonron, China to stop the wedding.
The DVD has a few extras, most notably a character gallery - they're strictly bare-bones, though, nothing particularly good or worthy of seeing twice (although this seems to be the case more often than not with anime). The video quality is as good as the animation can look on DVD (much better than the TV series), and the language tracks in English and Japanese are good. It helps that Viz Video is one of the few competent anime dubbers around.
If you're a Ranma fan, you should buy this - just don't expect worthwhile extras.",1001808000,3,1165,4.660194174757281
541324,5,6303026982,"I bought this DVD by mistake thinking it was a different Anime for my daughter. She is a BIG anime fan and was dissapointed at first that this was what she got given, but when she watched it the first time, she loved it! and so did I! It was jamed with a lot of humour and was a great Love triangle comedy! At first we were a little confused on why Ranma turns into Ranma-chan a female at first, but the DVD has extras, including the story line and character bio's. Now my daughter can't get enough of Ranma 1/2 and I have even decided to by the TV series Boxed sets now. So I would say this title is a must for all you ANIME lovers out there! A very imaginative and fun filled Anime! BUY IT TODAY FOLKS!",997315200,,704,4.0
541325,5,6303026982,"what a great movie, it has just about everything! romance, comedy, action, drama, (drama as in kirin finally putting down his chopsticks & rice bowl for akane) & of course you cant forget the pickles (dont ask just watch it)",997315200,,224,4.625
541326,5,6303026982,"This movie is awesome. I don't know why people say it's dull. Here's just a brief summary:16 year old Akane Tendo is swept off her feet by a prince named Kirin and her secret crush,Ranma Satome and company have to get her back. I reccomend you watch a few other videos of Ranma 1/2 to get the idea(because Ranma is actually half girl half boy!)I give this movie 5 stars because it had lot's of action and a good plot. It was really funny too. I don't know why some people think it deserves a NC-17 rating because I'd actually rate this movie PG or PG-13.  So go get this movie Anime fans for a healthy dose of Ranma 1/2!  Oh yeah,one disapointing thing is Ukyo is hardly in this movie!",995155200,,685,4.221374045801527
541327,5,6303026982,"A wonderful movie, a must see for all people who love ranma 1/2",971913600,,63,3.923076923076923
541358,4,6303026982,"This was a great deal of fun to watch! (No, I haven't gone mad, and no, Viz hasn't bought me off. And yes, I realize that I'm watching a dubbed  show!) What can I say? Everything that's made Ranma such a popular  long-running series is present in this package, and the folks over at Viz  did a pretty decent job of dubbing to boot. The story is not exactly  Academy material, but bear in mind that this show is aimed at kids. That  means that you should expect to see some very silly action, and as far as  movies go, it will be short. As so this is, on both counts. There is a lot  of slap stick and Saturday-morning cartoon-type humour, right from the very  opening scene. If you think that the martial arts action of Teenaged Mutant  Ninja Turtles is great, this show is right up your alley. And just so  you'll completely involved, there's even pretty decent opening and closing  themes to boot.
The animation is on par with higher-quality OAV's, but  what I really like about the Ranma series -- at least in this incarnation  -- are Nakajima Atsuko's character designs. Clean, simple and very, very  innocent. Plus the animators gave everyone some of the most expressive  anime eyes every to grace the screen. It's not that they're large by anime  standards, but these babies convey emotion in volumes. Fans of some of the  other characters, most notably Ryoga, Shampoo and Mousse will be  disappointed, as they get very minor supporting roles. And those who are  fans of Ukyo will be disappointed even further, as she gets what amounts to  a cameo, along with many others that appeared in the TV and OAV episodes.  But this story's pretty basic, and 74 minutes is far too short to try to  bring the whole crew in, so what we're left with is a fairly stock 'knight  in shining armour rescues damsel in distress' story. The writers kept  things quite simple, keeping the action very straight forward, punctuated  by regular one-line zingers.
I was most impressed with the English  scripting, since things seemed to flow quite seamlessly. (Unfortunately, I  don't have an original Japanese dialog version, so I can't rate how  accurate the translations might be.) Vocal cast was certainly acceptable;  in fact, I've come to like the dubbed voices for Nabiki, Shampoo and the  poetry-spouting Kuno. Give Ledoux & Co. credit, they did a very  credible job, especially when it came to the prose-spouting, go-shi  wielding twins, Daihokusai and Daikokusai. Their final line when Ranma  discovers their weakness had me laughing. It may seem like a very  formulaic/derivative movie, and it is (any fan of Bruce Lee movies will  immediately recognise the influence of 'Game of Death'), but the Ranma  formula seems most successful when things are kept pretty basic, and  concentrates on Akane and Ranma's relationship. This movie is the first,  and probably the best of the lot.",965779200,,2874,4.778004073319756
541359,5,6303026982,"I had never heard of Ranma, but there was a brief trailer at the end of one of my five-year old daughter's tapes and it caught her interest. Now  I'm hooked. This is without a doubt, the weirdest and best animated feature  I've ever seen! Yes, there are some marginally adult situations involving a  bizarre, bra-stealing old pervert, but the rest is pretty tame in that  respect. The complexity and originality is enough to make you watch it  again. Not in a day or a week, but as soon as it's finished! The action and  humor held the attention of my daughter, my parents and myself. This is  truly a wonderful experience. I HIGHLY recommend it.",965692800,,646,4.517241379310345
541360,3,6303026982,"This movie will likely be adored by dedicated Ranma 1/2 ""otaku"", but found merely interesting by ordinary ""fans"".
I found the movie pretty enjoyable, but found it lacking the cuteness of the TV and OAV  series. The movie starts with a quick role call of all the main characters,  and some of the minor ones. A good idea, but it wasn't cute at all since it  centered on Happosai. Several interesting new characters are later  introduced and put to good use with food references and fight scenes.  Things seemed to get better as the movie went along.  The ending was  predictable, but not-too-bad.
If you already have a Ranma 1/2 library,  you'll want to add this to your collection.  Other folks may want to rent  it first.",962323200,,722,4.6141732283464565
541361,5,6303026982,"I'm going to keep this short, you must know the show/comic before buying the DVD, but if you do know it buy this. It's great if you are a fan of Ranma.",959126400,,151,3.75
541362,4,6303026982,"The thrill alone of actually purchasing a Ranma 1/2 movie is worth the price. However, if you are expecting it to be faithful to the show, you may be dissapointed. I am a longtime Ranma fan and this may be one of the  dullest videos (however it still deserves 4 stars) in the series.
If this  is your first time experiencing Ranma, this movie is not a good thing to  start off with. Watch (or read) the series to understand all the wacky  events. Just because it seems weird, doesn't mean it isn't good. On the  contrary, weird things can always be excellent and interesting.
The story  is simple enough (too much for the Ranma 1/2 world). Akane is kidnapped  when a scroll is dropped into her hands. Kirin, the master of the scroll,  arrives to take her as his bride. Ranma and Ryoga do not take kindly to  this and along with the rest of the gang, and Lychee, who owns the scroll,  set off to Nekonron in China to confront Kirin.
As usual the dubbing  stinks (except for Shampoo), but the DVD soon fixes this problem by adding  te additional language (Japanese) and English subtitles. Not only this, but  there are other extra features: movie trailer, conceptual art, original  japanese ending, information on the story and characters. Either way it is  a great experience. I would rate the dubbed version 3 stars amd japanese  version 4 stars (so I rounded it up).",957312000,17,1367,4.540983606557377

This movie was a slight disopointment in the art region (the OAV series has gorgeous art while the film hasgood art). On a scale  of 1 to 10 for the laugh-factor, I give it an 8. It was really cute.

541364,2,6303026982,"This movie could give an excelent series a bad name. The first 15 minutes of the film will confuse the hell out of you if you know nothing about ranma.

The plot is half boy/girl (Ranma has a transformation curse hence  the tittle ranma 1/2) goes to rescue tempermental fiance. since first  impressions are lasting impressions please do not let this be your first  ranma tittle.

Tha animaton was good, but not great, it had those ugly theatrical spot for some reason on the DVD  even, but oh well, it seems more theatrical. The dub job is sweet, as  always, and the sub job is good, I guess. Not many extra features, but I  didn't buy it for the extra eatures, but for the movie itself. The DVD  could actually use alot of work, plus it  comes in a damn jewel case  instead of a regular DVD case. But at least it comes with a DVD sized box  to hold the jewel case.
