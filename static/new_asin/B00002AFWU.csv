1251645,4,B00002AFWU,"Step aerobics. Been there, done that. Tae Bo. Been there, done that.  I wanted a change in the usual workout.  I'm slim but I wanted to be toned up more (especially for fitness & for my modeling work).  I ordered the ""Fitness for Beginners"" box set.
First, I must say that all of these workout videos begin with a common warning you find on all videos:  they're not responsible for injuries. Even throughout the video, they tell you to GO AT YOUR OWN PACE.  This was especially important, because some of the more repetitive movements can be tough on your legs...but when I say ""tough"", it was challenging, but NOT painful for me.  Further, if you're looking to learn bellydancing moves per se, get the ""basic moves"" video, or even the boxed set.  The twins also offer videos that teach you how to do authentic bellydance routines.  However, if you are just starting bellydance but want to learn how to do routines, I would suggest you get the boxed set anyways. You learn the basics, you get familiar with the most common moves in the 4-video set (arm movements, ab strengtheners & techniques, hips, buns & thighs combinations, and basic moves that you need to know) and then move on.
Further, these videos are a BREATH OF FRESH AIR.  Not only do you feel sensual as you learn the moves, but you also realize that ""HEY! I CAN DANCE!!""  Further, Neena and Veena keep you interested with tips and ideas, while the music helps keep you upbeat and ready for more.
I strongly recommend this video to EVERY WOMAN who wants to tone up, get stronger and get more flexible--- all while being sensual and feeling feminine.  What could be better???",1024272000,2,1638,4.594501718213058
1251646,1,B00002AFWU,"I have to agree with the majority of reviewers.
This video was very boring, repetitive, and not terribly physically sound.
I felt very silly during the exercises where I had to keep my finger stuck to my forehead, and although I turned it off (and returned it to the store) after 15 minutes of hopping, I was still stuck with extremely sore calves.
Also, I don't see any reason to put the word ""Bellydancing"" on the front, because as I understand it, this is more based on Egyptian folk-dancing.
Come on, V & N! You can do better!",1020643200,,530,4.418367346938775
1251647,4,B00002AFWU,"This is an *exercise* video, you will NOT learn how to bellydance with this video.  The video focuses on fat burning, which involves getting the heart rate up (cardio-vascular exercise).  I am not a fan of aerobics, and found this video (and the boxed set) to be a good alternative to aerobics.  However, if you do love aerobics or complicated exercise routines, then this video is NOT for you.  This video includes a lot of hopping and jumping which may cause some strain on your ankles.  Use caution and always work-out at your own pace.  If you have weak ankles, then you probably should not buy this video.
I recommend this video to anyone looking for an alternative fitness routine.  It focuses on a few basic, simple hopping steps -- nothing complicated.  You will certainly work up a good sweat in a most enjoyable way.  I strongly suggest that you *save* yourself some money and buy the entire boxed set, it well worth the investment!!!  Each video provides an exercise routine targeting a different area of the body - butt, hips, abs, arms, etc.  And all videos include a segment of Neena/Veena dancing --which is great for choreogrpahy or costuming ideas.",1014163200,,1165,4.746268656716418
1251648,3,B00002AFWU,"I was a bit disappointed with this tape.  I will admit that I thought bellydancing was just rolling your stomach and shaking your hips.  I was expecting to learn how to roll my stomach and shake my hips so when I previewed my tape and saw Neena and Veena jumping around I got a little po'd.  However I do think with only slight variations but this tape is excellent for toning your calves aand good for getting your heart rate up.
I would not buy this tape if I havesome kind of knee problems this tape is great for cardio.  The tape is a bit repetitive since there is so much jumping about but if you are looking for a change in your workout then this is the tape for you.",999648000,,673,4.114503816793893
1251649,1,B00002AFWU,"I was very disappointed in this video, I have all the other Bidasha twin videos, but this one was very unimaginative.  They keep doing one step over and over ..... this video is not worth it .... try any of the other bellydance videos ... just skip this one",996278400,2,257,4.244897959183674
1251650,2,B00002AFWU,"I found this video to be too hard for beginners, aka someone who isn't in the best of shape.  My lungs could not keep up with the moves. Not only that, but it is also pretty boring.  I bought  bellydancing videos hoping to learn a few exotic moves from each one, but this one had none to speak of.  Its been sitting on my shelf for almost a year, but I love the other videos done by Neena and Veena.",993686400,,399,3.95
1251651,1,B00002AFWU,"This video features all of about three moves, and not even any simple combinations.  There is no motivation--the instructors don't even instruct--this is all done via voiceover.  Stretching is poor--areas that are worked out extensively in the aerobic portion aren't even stretched prior.  No focus or direction on form, either.  One section had you moving with your finger stuck to your forehead for about five minutes. Even if you're a beginner, I wouldn't bother.  I also own the Goddess Workout and, while it's a little cheesy, it's alot more fun--and I had never bellydanced before in my life!",988761600,4,598,5.061224489795919
1251652,3,B00002AFWU,"I have this video and use it as an alternative when either I don't have a lot of time, or I'm just looking for a little change from my normal routine.  These two sisters are obviously skilled dancers [as the small  performance clips at the end prove]. The workout on this video is fairly  simple, and what I like is I can do it barefoot. I can kick off my shoes  and dance along.  It does get the heart pumping and the 25 minute workout  breezes by fairly quickly.  On the down side, the beginning is slow. The  steps in the beginning are too simple and go on for too long.  I don't care  for the finger on the forehead move.  There is a long period where they  just do the same folkloric step with one finger on their forehead.  What  I do like about it is I can exercise using bellydance steps and listening  to middle eastern inspired music [not necessarily authentic].  I have been  dancing for over two years and although this isn't a tape that teaches  bellydance or its technique, it is a way to incorporate a little bit of  bellydance into a daily exercise routine.",951696000,2,1073,4.301507537688442

7915498,5,B00002AFWU,"I purchased this vidoe back in 2000 on a whim from Target.  I happen to have lost over 35 lbs with this same video as one of my main work outs. While this video may not train you to be a professional bellydancer, it WILL work you out in a fun and different way, and it's just 30 minutes.  I have done it many mornings before work.  Unfortunately, my VCR ate the tape, which lead me to amazon to re-buy the video, that should tell you how well it worked.",1301961600,,453,4.011111111111111
7915499,4,B00002AFWU,"This is a great tape if you're looking to burn fat- just like the title says.  There's not much actual bellydancing in it the way that most people think of belly dance, mostly because most people don't understand what belly dance IS.  The movements are more of an Egyptian/African tribal movements and you don't do much dancing but a lot of sort of jumping.  If you want to lose weight, this is great- if you do it daily you'll literally see your tummy melt away, the pounds will just fall off.  It's a little difficult at first -not difficult to execute but it definitely will tire you- but if you keep trying it's a GREAT workout.",1156982400,,632,4.422413793103448
7915500,4,B00002AFWU,"I can't ever finish the video.  Hopping around back and forth, and the superfast leg motions probably would not be good for a beginner or for someone who has knee/ankle problems.  Fun if you are actually able to execute the movements.",1139097600,,234,4.682926829268292
7915501,4,B00002AFWU,"I just bought this video 3 days ago and I have used it each day. I found myself working up a good sweat! The first time I did it I couldn't keep up but still tried my best. Today was my third time and I seem to be much better and already lost 1lb!
 I chose BELLYDANCE because I need to keep myself motivated while exercising. Veena and Neena sure motivate me! If your looking for a tape that gives you a fast good workout that is fairly simple this one is for you!! I enjoy it each time and haven't been bored at all! Probably better for beginnners like me! Enjoy!",1086825600,,564,4.035714285714286
7915502,1,B00002AFWU,"When I see the ""Bellydance"" in the title of something, I would expect to move my hips and dance.  That doesn't happen at all in this video.  It's all hopping on one foot, keep hopping, add an arm, switch foot, add an arm, keep hopping..... soooo boring!  Do not get this video if actually expect to learn how to or do bellydance!",1076976000,3,329,4.274193548387097
7915503,1,B00002AFWU,"I've owned over 100 fitness videos from time to time, I've taken bellydance and folk dance classes, and I've also had looooong spans of time where I don't work out and I'm back at 'beginner' level.
That said, this was without a doubt the dullest video I've ever seen, and that includes my tai chi and meditation tapes. When I read ""Egyptian folk dance,"" I was expecting something more fast-paced and with some variety. Not only is all the hopping on one leg repetitive, but even the music is, too. RELENTLESSLY so.
The trouble here is that exercisers - particularly beginners - won't follow routines that are boring for long. The other problem is that you're paying for a tape that basically has you doing moves you could easily do on your own and save yourself the money. (Put on dull music and hop on one leg till your leg hurts, now switch legs.)
This is the only tape I've seen by these two, but I can't say I'm motivated to spend any more money on their other tapes. I'm afraid to end up with more of the same.",1041465600,2,1015,4.375661375661376
7915504,3,B00002AFWU,"I really love the Veena and Neena Bellydance Fitness for Beginner tapes.  They're the only workout tapes that I really enjoy doing, and that don't make me feel like an out of shape loser.
That said, I don't really enjoy this particular tape all that much.  I find the moves to be too repetitive and not ""bellydance"" enough.  If you want a workout that is more challenging than the ""basic moves"" tape, but still retains the general feel, I suggest the ""slim down"" tape.  It still gets you sweating, but has more variety and flow.",1036972800,,528,4.526315789473684
7915505,5,B00002AFWU,"I own all of the twins tapes, I think that Fat Burning by far is the hardest, and it has the least amount of Belly Danceing.
However its Not supposeto teach you to dance its made for people who have already been studying and want to burn FAT.
Over the last 5 months I have lost 45 Pounds useing all of these twins tapes. Fat burning I only do on Wenesdays. I do the other ones the other days. My friend who has been doing the tapes w/ me evryday can not do Fat Burning because of her knees. If you have bad knees or hips you probaly will hurt really bad(not in a good way). There is alot of jumping. I still love the tape . Happy journeys",1030665600,,638,3.953488372093023
7915506,1,B00002AFWU,"This thirty minute tape contains mainly silly one-legged jumps that can kill your calfs and feet!  This is Veena and Neena's worst tape, in my opinion!  Bottom line: Leave this tape in the store!
If you want tapes by Veena and Neena, I highly recommend the Slim Down tape,and their parts tapes(Arms and Abs, Hips, Buns,and Thighs, etc.)  They give you more of a variety of fitness routines.",1024876800,,390,4.705882352941177
