8512344,5,B0078QHFWU,"This is my first review here on Amazon.  I really wanted to say some kind words about this fantastic DVD.  My daughter and I have been studying martial arts for about a year now and our school suits up and spars about 30 minutes a week.  We are lucky in that we all spar with each other regardless of rank, age, etc. so there is a good mix.  Before sparring, we may spend part or all of the pervious part of the class on techniques.  With some upcoming competitions I decided to add some sparring books and videos to my library.  This one caught my eye since it had real footage from actual competitions.  There are allot of techniques in there that my instructor had already been teaching but it was good to not only take a step back and see them done with a little more explanation but also see them done in a real tournament situation.  Seeing them in live action gives you a better perspective since you are seeing them in real time and with a real opponent.  This past weekend my 8 year old daughter competed in her first tournament.  She is a yellow belt.  We had learned the week before we would be sparring with Taekwondo fighters.  Her teacher gave her allot of strategies with dealing with fighters that mostly kick.  I also had my daughter review the DVD potions that specifically deal with kickers.  She took first place gold medal after defeating the final opponent who was 2 years old and 2 belt rankings higher.  I'm going to keep referring back to this DVD over the next few years as I progress. If you even learn one good technique from this DVD you got your price admission.",1334534400,,1592,4.385665529010239

If you train at one of those schools, this video will help you develop the skills you need to compete at open tournaments with traditional sparring -- tournaments, in other words, where you'll be able to test yourself against martial artists from other styles on a level playing field. The video explains my wholehearted endorsement of Ken Gullette's Martial Arts Tournament Point Sparring. It is a well presented, well structured, well thought-out, and eminently useful video for martial artists of all levels.",1329177600,,994,7.8053097345132745
