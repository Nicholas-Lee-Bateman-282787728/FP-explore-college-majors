7904839,3,B000006QH2,"This vhs is a pretty good video biography. Basically most of the tape is her friends being interviewed (including her 1st husband) still photographs of Marilyn, and short clips from her films, and even shorter clips of some of the rare footage that the press captured (like her and Jane Russell putting their hands and feet in cement to honor the sucess of ""Gentlemen prefer blondes"", her marriage to Joe DiMaggio, her announcing her divorce from DiMaggio, the announcement of her engagement to Arthur Miller, her coming out of the hospital after a miscarriage, her being released from the mental hospital, the infamous ""Happy Birthday Mr. President"" performance, etc.) and those clips were around 10-30 seconds at the most; I wish they would have been a lot longer! This is a SIMPLE biography to add to your collection, it does not reveal anything new & it doesn't go deep into her personal life. One of the best things about the tape is they included some footage from ""Somethings got to give"", Marilyn's last movie (but again, not enough!) Overall, its not the BEST Marilyn video biography, but it definitely wasn't a waste of time! I recommend renting it to see if you would like to purchase it!
