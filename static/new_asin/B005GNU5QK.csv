8471896,5,B005GNU5QK,"If youve ever flipped through channels and come across Whale Wars then youll instantly recognize Paul Watson and his current crew aboard the Sea Shepherd. This documentary goes back to the 1960s and 70s following the start of Greenpeace, as well as Pauls start as a nature and sea life conservationist /activist. People may think that Paul and others like him are just hippies with no regard for the law but it is in the absence of reinforcing international laws that Paul acts. Just as it is illegal for a human being to kill another human being, it is illegal to kill (must less continue killing) species that have been overhunted/ overfished and are close to extinction. Maybe 100 years ago certain cultures survived this way, but its no longer necessary and throwing whole eco-systems out of balance as well! (Not to mention once one species is extinct they just move onto the extermination of another).
The documentary is very informative, the transition between b-role, photographs, interviews and older movie clips is seamless and easy to follow. In particular, I really enjoyed getting to know Paul on a more personal level- how he feels about his work, his perspective on wildlife conservation, his approach to ending whaling  This is definitely worth a watch!",1384732800,,1269,4.957746478873239
