623296,1,630327630X,"If you like to watch dumb, cruel people abuse animals, this is the movie for you. Mob types fighting dogs for $. Travolta plays the dumbest (loser) character on the planet in this movie that does not deserve to be raising a child or a dog. The dog is the star of the movie and almost kills him/her self chasing the lead characters across the country. The dog is abused and abandoned by ""everyone"" but the little girl in this movie. After 1 1/2 hours of animal abuse it does have a happy ending, but just barely. I understand that this type of behavior exists in our society but I do not know why someone wants to put it on the big screen. This movie pissed me off. I just wanted the dog to kill everyone in the movie except the little girl and then the movie could be over.",1485043200,,773,4.16

We enjoy John Travolta but the cursing took away one star. It was overboard. As a good actor, I bet Travolta could have used lesser offensive words and gotten his point and anger across.

I confess ~ I only watched this movie because of the dog. I can see why most of the reviews were about the Doberman.
The movie itself is not that great. It was slow and predictable with so-so acting.

#2 - the girl/daughter
#3 - the dad/John Travolta
