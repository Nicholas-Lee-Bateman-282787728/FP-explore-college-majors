2007354,3,B0001K2OSU,"Well, this girl is amazing - love her tattoos.  As far as the instructional aspect goes - I wasn't too happy with the way they showed the moves.  A lot of times her whole body isn't in frame so it is a little confusing to catch how her feet are placed.  This is definitely instruction for the more advanced pole dancer.  I also thought that they could've shown more moves.",1130976000,18,372,4.271428571428571
8013447,5,B0001K2OSU,I don't care for how the moves were explain because im more of a visual learner.  This video had some great/impressive moves.  Im glad I bought it.  There is a little nudity in this video FYI but a great video to learn new moves/tricks,1425427200,,235,4.295454545454546
8013448,4,B0001K2OSU,"Pantera is amazing but this is NOT a beginner's DVD as my husband mistakenly thought after reading the title ""101"".",1329264000,,115,4.8
8013449,1,B0001K2OSU,"I have been taking Pole dance classes for 3 years and wanted a safe at home DVD to practice some pole Tricks.  This is not a ""101"" basic DVD!  The camera cuts out the dancers feet and hands so you cannot see how she is placing her feet for the moves.  I did purchase Dr. Amy's Pole Workout Volume 2 and was so happy with my purchase!! Only buy this DVD if you are a little more advanced and are familiar with the moves!!",1304035200,2,420,3.9761904761904763
8013450,4,B0001K2OSU,"this is a great video if your wanting to learn new pole tricks. it doesn't help you if you are wanting to learn how to get from move to move or transitioning from walking around the pole to getting to the trick.
i would say this video is for someone who has got the basic moves down. it was great help for me as it shows u step by step how to do the ticks. the pause and rewind was my friend during this video. they do take some time to learn unless you are already good with your basic tricks. i watched the whole movie before i started my work out to me that helped me pick up the moves a bit faster.
so this is not a first timer video. take some classes then buy this dvd!",1207872000,,675,3.8633093525179856
8013451,2,B0001K2OSU,"I'm surprised this is called POLE TRICKS 101 because the majority of tricks are very advanced. She's quite the amazing pole dancer, though I find her a bit scarey with those body tattoos, pierced nipples and platform stilettos. This is definitely not your pole dance as exercise DVD. (I would recommend the very thorough KT Coates 2 DVD's. Check her out at [...]). Still, Pantera is a pole phenomenon and I admire her athleticsm.
I like the red arrows that show you where to apply pressure to the pole but the shots are often cropped too close and you miss important details. Other key pieces of info are also missing (such as how to get into an advanced pose before an even more advanced pose). And she doesn't cover transitions at all. Maybe we're to assume that'll be covered in POLE TRICKS 201? If there is one, I don't think I'll buy it.",1196121600,11,842,4.509803921568627
8013452,4,B0001K2OSU,What a great thing to aspire to.  This video is HARD but very inspiring.  Be sure you are warmed up she gets right into it.  Great costumes ; ).,1181174400,,144,3.896551724137931
8013453,5,B0001K2OSU,"If your a real pole lover this ones for you. Pantera is awsome!! She takes it to the next level,so you might wanna STRETCH really good before watching!! Beginners may want to wait on this one!",1173916800,,192,4.361111111111111
8013454,2,B0001K2OSU,"I have been pole dancing for several years and perform many feature shows as a result. I bought this DVD because I was told that it was good for advanced pole dancers and thought it might give me something new to try.

The overall tricks are impressive and unique. But I have to admit that they do not always show you the most graceful or easiest way to get into position or carry out a move.

My two biggest issues with this DVD is that...

1. The camera is often focused dead center of the pole. There are MANY tricks that you can not see her feet or her complete grip. This annoyed me to no end. I can not understand how such a crucial issue could have been overlooked! You almost have to just guess where her feet are at times. So it makes trying to follow the instructions rather difficult.

2. They do not show ANY dismounts. They show you how to get into the tricks but they do not show you how to safely get out of them! Many of the tricks that are being shown on this video can not be dismounted in the same way they were mounted. I suppose they just expect the viewer to hang there and try to figure it out for themselves. ???

I would also like to add that the performance footage that they show at the beginning and end of the video are performed on a spinning pole, yet the instructional breakdowns are performed on a stationary pole. Holding your position and the amount of momentum needed to work on a spinning pole is COMPLETELY different then that of a stationary. They should have completely avoided any footage of the spinning pole as those tricks will not look the same on a stationary one.

All in all...it is always entertaining to see Pantera on the pole. So if you are a fan, definitely buy this DVD. But if you are looking to actually learn and perform these tricks for yourself....find another DVD or get a private teacher! Poletricks 101 is not worth the money.",1172275200,47,1888,4.304225352112676
8013455,5,B0001K2OSU,"This is a wonderful DVD if you are looking to learn tricks that are absolutely stunning.  Moves are more advanced and require pre-existing knowledge of what you are doing on the pole.  Even though there are a lot of advanced moves, even someone with intermediate experience can take a little something from Pantera.  Lots of wonderful moves to aspire to-afterall, practice makes perfect!",1160697600,,387,5.111111111111111
8013456,5,B0001K2OSU,"Worth the money even if you aren't advanced enough to do the tricks...Pantera is the best, hands down.",1159315200,,102,4.722222222222222
