8461429,5,B001T7O1TO,"A darkly hilarious 90's underground masterpiece; heavily informed by John Waters but with a punk-shit approach that's filtered through a uniquely Asian-American experience.

The best way to describe the story is that it's a very grotesque day in the life of a Japanese-American family, mainly focusing on the exploits of the drug-dealing son Kazumi and his girlfriend Eightball (although the rest of the family, brother Marvin, sister Holly, mom, dad, and grandpa all get plenty of attention). Their lives are intertwined and heading for an apocalyptic end.

It also has some of the best dialogue and delivery this side of Crispin Glover. Some memorable lines are Kazumi's ""College? Its a load of crap... straight out the donkeys ass! and Confucius say, Hospitals are for pussies.

A memorable scene is a phone conversation between Holly and her fellow cheerleader Muff, where all of the later's lines are reinforced with random electric guitar riffing. Oh yeah, there's also a character named Fagtoast. What's not to love?",1441411200,,1023,5.225609756097561
