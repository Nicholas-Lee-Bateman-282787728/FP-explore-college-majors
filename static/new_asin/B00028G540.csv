When released in the US, it was renamed ""Playgirl After Dark"", was slightly edited and ultimately released in black-n-white.  I would very much like to purchase this DVD, but won't do it until it's released in it's proper form...unedited and (at least) in color the way it was originally filmed.",1341187200,6,402,4.782608695652174
2068174,2,B00028G540,"The Koch video print is very poor quality, not even normal DVD level. Looks like SD off a TV channel. I doubt the Alpha version is any better, judging from dozens of their discs that I have seen. The movie is not a tenth as sexy as the still photos that were published in Playboy (in which you can see why they probably did opt to release it in B&W), and whenever the girls actually start to strip, the film abruptly cuts away. However, European films of this era were frequently censored for US release and this is probably an intact version of an American print. It's a cheap film, but interesting for the number of real talents seen early in their careers. If you want to see why Jayne Mansfield was provocative (in her non-studio films), better to get Promises, Promises, the stills for which got even Playboy in trouble (and the stills are mostly from the film, which isn't true in THTH).",1328054400,7,893,4.451219512195122

2068176,4,B00028G540,"ALPHA VIDEO is a provider of vintage programming that's often unavailable elsewhere. Alpha's prices are fair, but so is transfer quality of some of their offerings. None have undergone restoration, yet this product's rareness and reasonable cost make it a worthwhile purchase.

TOO HOT TO HANDLE is the story of a London nightclub owner who fights back when a local mobster leans on him for protection money. Here, Jayne Mansfield skillfully manages a deadly serious role (perhaps her very best work) and proves there was more to her than that ""dumb blonde"" image. For anyone interested in scenes of burlesque-type stripping, ""Too Hot"" is certain to please. (This film was originally in Eastmancolor but as of 9/09 was only available in b&w on DVD.)

SYNOPSIS--
Johnny Solo (Genn) won't be intimidated by Diamonds Dielli (Lawrence), nor will he listen to the advice of his exotic dancer girlfriend, headliner Midnight Franklin (Mansfield), who wants Johnny to quit the strip club business entirely in order to protect his own life.

NOTE: Watch for a pawnbroker cameo by Ian Fleming (not the author), who in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SILVER-BLAZE/dp/B000BD2R20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SILVER BLAZE</a>&nbsp;(1937) portrayed Dr. Watson opposite Arthur Wontner's Sherlock Holmes.

2068177,2,B00028G540,"Well made by the great Terence Young,with an interesting supporting cast, (including Christopher Lee and Barbara Windsor) But the film is just too
brittish for my taste,and the uninspired,boring script kills the film...
but,if you are at all interested in Jane Mansfield,then you,ll have to see this one.
Regarded by most chritics as a bad actress,she is here probably giving the most convinsing performance of her career.
She was always beutiful and charming,but here she is also a great actress!
To bad the movie does not deserve her.

2068179,5,B00028G540,"For years i was trying to get to see this film.

When I finally found it last year,i was pleasantly surprised.

Jayne offers a serious performance that i found very credible. Even her voice is lower in it's tone,and the numbers when she sings give us an idea of what her Las Vegas shows must have been like(she was the highest paid performer,at 35,000 $ a week !).God knows that Jayne was not offered many serious roles in her film career,but i would say that this one qualifies as a serious one.

The film is directed by Terence Young,and even if the production values are done with a small budget,it is well-paced,with a real story giving us a glimpse of the behind-the-scenes of a stripper in the late 50's.

The serious side of Jayne's performance made me think about her last movie,'Single Room Furnished',which made me sad.

Conclusion:Don't dismiss this film as a 'Bomb' or El-cheapo trashy film,it is not.

Trivia (found of Jayne's site):One of the reason why the film was shot in black and white,had to do  with how revealing one of Jayne's costume was(the one you see on the cover)",1149206400,38,1091,4.6217616580310885

Jayne had pretty good acting skills...most movies that I saw with her in it made her out to be the ""dumb blonde"" or the ""over jealous"" sex kitten...but she truly had talent...the story was a little sketchy and drawn out but interesting enough to see her acting and to see how far they would take sexy in those days on the silver screen!!!",1431648000,4,411,4.421052631578948

8023845,4,B00028G540,"Wow, I really enjoyed this movie. The story and cast are amazing. This little rarity oozes with 1960's atmosphere and it's well worth seeing.  I will agree that the video quality is only fair at best, it does look like a soft black and white TV print. However, this little ""British Sleeper"" is still incredibly entertaining. Jayne catches your attention from the opening frame as she is undeniably, incredibly, voluptuous and well suited to this type of role. I also admire Christopher Lee's body of work and he delivers a stellar performance in this film. I certainly hope a better quality version becomes available and gets a future release. The Alpha video version though flawed is still worth seeing.",1392681600,,704,4.915966386554622
