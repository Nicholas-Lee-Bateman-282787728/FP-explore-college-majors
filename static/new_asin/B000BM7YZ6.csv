8108958,2,B000BM7YZ6,"I could go all out and say that this DVD sucks if it hadn't been for Arlen Roth's attempt to take the time to explain in detail the technique of vibrato (Most videos move right past learning the art of that technique). The rest of the guys act like they were dragged into the studio after an all nighter to run off a few licks for the cameras to complete the ""Blues Masters"" line-up. The Lonnie Mack section was ridiculously short. Although I enjoyed seeing lessons by the original blues artists in this video, I would have much rather had the entire video been taught by either Ronny, Duke, Buddy or especially Arlen alone. This DVD is only 30mins and I have found many more in-depth videos that run at least 60-90 minutes that delve much deeper into technique and offer many more examples for the price or less.",1252540800,3,813,4.4630872483221475
