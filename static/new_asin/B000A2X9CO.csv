8073175,4,B000A2X9CO,I thought this one was ok and pretty easy to follow,1416182400,,51,3.727272727272727
8073176,5,B000A2X9CO,"There are only a few what I call Good Walking Weather days for outside walks; so even though I live in a fairly level area for outside walking I wasn't a regular walker until I found John Abdo's DVD.  It's great and even if you can't do a certain part (for me it's the lunges), you can just walk through that short part.  I always feel better on days that I walk and now that's almost every day.",1397347200,,395,4.051282051282051
8073177,5,B000A2X9CO,"I love this workout because it's easy to do - no complicated moves, but it really works all your muscles.  The arms and upper body are targeted quite a bit, with ninja punches and swim strokes.  The resistance exercises with the towel and the lunges are great also.  John Abdo is very qualified and seems to have given this workout a lot of thought to work the entire body.  Thanks, John!",1261872000,,388,4.422535211267606
8073178,2,B000A2X9CO,I have several of the Leslie Sansone walking tapes and think she's much better.  Maybe I am not the target audience but didn't inspire me very much. I think it is definitely for a beginner.,1178409600,2,189,4.4
8073179,5,B000A2X9CO,I totally love this work out!  The great thing about this tape is that you don't have to be coordinated to do it!!  It is only 30 min long which I really love!!  I like to think of John Abdo as my personal trainer.  Thanks John!!!,1164758400,,230,3.9347826086956523
8073180,5,B000A2X9CO,"I wear a heart rate meter when using this workout dvd and it gets my heart rate within target range.  Although John Abdo is an encouraging coach, for a change, I turned on the Celtic Sunday CD at the same time while working out to the dvd (with dvd sound on low) and surprisingly, the springy, lilting music synchronized with the workout most of the time.  It turned the workout into a ""Riverdance dancing experience"" with the video dancers seemingly dancing companionably as chorus; so now, I do that most of the time.

This workout is low impact with little space requirement as I use this video in our pied a terre apartment with limited floor space and with downstairs neighbors and I've had no complaints.",1153872000,5,710,4.619047619047619
