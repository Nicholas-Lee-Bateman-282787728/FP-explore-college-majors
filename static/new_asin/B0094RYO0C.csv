8536033,5,B0094RYO0C,"Initially produced when he was only 24, this is the series which launched Jamie Oliver's television career.

Filmed in a style which has become familiar thanks to reality TV, each episode is built around an outing or event with his friends or family which includes Jamie cooking for the group. We meet his workmates and friends, his family, and his girlfriend Jules (now his wife). We go along as he shops for ingredients at London's specialty shops and markets

Jamie explains and demonstrates how to prepare an amazing range of dishes from a variety of cuisines.  British roast lamb, Italian focaccia, Morrocan preserved lemons, and an Asian seafood noodle broth are just a few these recipes. He makes fresh pasta, rolls it out using a pasta machine, and creates raviolis using his own homemade filling. He creates a Thai style green curry.

Each episode ends with the meal being enjoyed against a background of agreeable soft rock music. I thoroughly enjoyed watching these shows and have since successfully prepared a number of the dishes presented. All three seasons of of Naked Chef are a great series and one I continue to enjoy returning to from time to time.",1375920000,,1167,4.878787878787879
