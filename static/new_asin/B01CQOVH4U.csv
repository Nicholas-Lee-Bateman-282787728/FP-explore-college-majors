8753845,5,B01CQOVH4U,"Absolutely fabulous! Hands Across The Table..Fred MacMurray and Carole kiss in a close up that is unmatched in cinema..all the other films are brilliant. It is as if, with Carole Lombard, these films were made in 2017.",1496966400,,218,4.918918918918919
8753846,5,B01CQOVH4U,"Of the four films in this collection, I already knew and liked My Man Godfrey, which I rate very highly.  From what I had read about True Confession, I expected little from it.  My focus here is on the two films from this collection that I consider the best.  My appreciation of Carole Lombard's film performances is that she was really a great comedienne. Because, in my view, her roles in these two films especially highlight her wonderful comedic skills, I really liked these two of the four.  While in True Confession she has been described as being a pathological liar, I think her role is so much more complex and more human than that.  I actually consider True Confession to be just as humorous and memorable as  My Man Godfrey.  In both she can be said to play what in the language of the era was termed a ""flighty female.""  In my mind, Lombard was indeed  -- in a comedic sense --  as skillful as Lucille Ball became when in her forties.  Perhaps if Lombard had lived beyond the age of 34  she would have come to have her own T.V. situation comedy show and would have been recognized as being on a par with, if not better than Lucy.",1495584000,,1141,4.355450236966824
