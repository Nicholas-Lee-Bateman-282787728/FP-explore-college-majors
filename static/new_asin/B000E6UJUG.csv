2963110,3,B000E6UJUG,"When the producers attempt to vacuum-pack, into one hour, the entire story of the first round of the war crime trials at Nuremberg (the trials themselves lasted very nearly a year), one has to expect that a fair amount of detail will be omitted.  However, this production skims the surface to such a degree that this program can be, at best, regarded as the most basic introduction to the trials.

Really, this program should have been given the subtitle ""Gring versus Jackson,"" because it is clear that the program focuses on the showdown between Hermann Gring and Robert Jackson as being the main event in the trial.  It is hard to argue that the jousts between these formidable adversaries doesn't make for compelling television.  However, so much else is left out that the great footage just isn't enough to salvage this effort.

For instance, one will not even be told the names of all of the defendants, why they were charged, and who got what sentences.  It does not address how three defendants actually managed to be acquitted (which was considered by some at the time a major embarrassment to the Allies --- some observers suggested that all verdicts should be ignored and all defendants be summarily executed).  It does not examine how Admirals Raeder & Dnitz managed to avoid execution while Generals Jodl & Keitel were hanged.  It does not examine the murky reality that many defendants of the subsequent trials received milder sentences than they might have had they been tried in the first round.

All of this is ignored, and the program wraps up tidily, with Gring's suicide, after one hour.  But it was far from a tidy affair, and some of the principals were left with mixed feelings as to whether or not justice was truly being served.  For a more in depth analysis of the trials, I would recommend Telford Taylor's ""The Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials,"" which will show you all that you are missing by watching this program.",1138579200,20,1943,4.7701492537313435

8221554,5,B000E6UJUG,"The series ""American Experience"" is excellent at presenting many varied subjects that should be of interest to all of us. This presentation of The Nuremberg Trials is a good overview of the purpose and demeanor of the trials. Much is left out due to time constraints; yet we get enough information to see what happened and why.

As a side treat we get to see many of the people of the time and the story is told mostly by their offspring. The narrator is Joe Morton He is an actor, known for ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (1991).
