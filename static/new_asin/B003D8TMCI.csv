8394722,3,B003D8TMCI,"it was part of the hammer tv series of tv movies, I was surprised at the quality of the video . usually the standard def tv from the 70's didn't transfer to tape that well some shots were slightly out of focus but that's what can happen when your tv upgrades the signal to 1080.
Iwish they would re release these films on dvd or several on one blu ray, it wouldn't be much to put it on disc they were mono standard def back then so they could just copy it to disc no editing needed.",1434499200,,482,3.979381443298969
