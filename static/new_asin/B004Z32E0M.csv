4505604,5,B004Z32E0M,"I've thoroughly enjoyed watching Borgen on Link TV (Ch. 375 on DirecTV and Ch. 9410 on Dish Network) since they began airing the series last October. For those who wish to see both seasons, they will be having a Borgen marathon starting Aug. 20th and lasting for 2 weeks (M-F, 2 episodes each night). For the schedule go to Link TV's website and search for ""Borgen"".",1344988800,8,366,4.5606060606060606
4505605,5,B004Z32E0M,"I very much enjoyed BORGEN which is not available commercially in Australia (It has not been shown on TV here either). I have recently become interested in Danish TV drama after I watched The Killing which was shown on Australia's SBS TV Channel. BORGEN is exquisitly done as it blends political intrigue with human daily life, I am looking forward to Series 2, 3 and.......

4505606,5,B004Z32E0M,"Considering Copenhagen is about the size of Kansas City metro, you gotta admire their ability to produce top notch dramas like this, involving very talented actors with lavish sets and production values.  I just saw both seasons from . . . well, I'll have to invoke the first rule of Fight Club here . . . and they're very much worth having.  I can't imagine why they haven't been picked up by someone for US TV, unless people just have such a strong aversion to subtitles.  The recent remake of ""Dragon Tattoo"" was completely pointless, the original extended TV version is far better.  Maybe we can't read??  Tak.",1334880000,10,614,4.648148148148148
4505607,5,B004Z32E0M,"After thoroughly enjoying the original Danish version of The Killing (Forbrydelsen), I thought I'd try another Danish series. Borgen (Government) is made by the same company DR (Danish Broadcasting Corporation) that produced The Killing. The series comprises ten x one hour long episodes which delve into the whole world of Danish government. The series encompasses the challenges which face Denmark's first female prime minister Birgitte Nyborg Christensen. Birgitte's homelife, the sacrifices made at home, her relationship with ministers in her coalition government, as well as typical defence, financial, media scandals all intertwine to provide hours of decent drama.
Having enjoyed Forbrydelsen's depiction of Copenhagen city coalition politics, this series features politics on a national level and we see the surprise result of the election, mishaps by rival Conservative and Labour parties, the secret world of Nyborg's spin doctor in addition to the TV1 broacaster which is always attempting to obtain political scoops.
On a par again with Forbrydelsen is the acting - superb! Sidse Babette Knudsen and Pilou Asbk shine as PM and spin doctor Kasper Juul. Familiar faces from Forbrydelsen pop up including Sren Malling (Meyer in Forbrydelsen) as TV1 editor Torben Friis and Bjarne Henriksen (Theis in Forbrydelsen) as defence minister Hans Christian Kongsmark.
Well written and directed, Borgen is a treat. Forbrydelsen fans should keep an eye on Birgitte's husband Philip Christensen played by Mikael Birkkjr. Birkkjr plays a major role in Forbrydelsen 2. Asbk also stars on Forbrydelsen 2.
This set with English subtitles also sells for less than $45 on any online Swedish DVD site.
Enjoy!",1313366400,24,1700,5.517241379310345
8449390,5,B004Z32E0M,Some of the best stuff on TV comes from Denmark. And then it gets remade here.,1429228800,,78,3.9375
8449391,5,B004Z32E0M,I can not wait to start series 2 and three. It is very well subtitled in English and hard to stop once you start into it. Bring on another series.,1397260800,,146,3.9
8449392,4,B004Z32E0M,"I liked Borgen, respected it, enjoyed it. But I didn't LOVE it, as opposed seemingly everyone in the universe (OK I found one Luke-warm review out of about 20 by major outlet writers - the rest were flat out raves). My wife loved it. My friends. So maybe I need to see it again? But 30 hours is a big investment in something that didn't blow me out of my chair.

It's about Danish politics, and the almost accidental rise of one woman - Brigitte Nyborg - a member of one of Denmark's 8 parties to the role of Prime Minister  after her less- pragmatic, better known male rivals self-destruct. It followers her, and those around her -- her team, the press, her political rivals -- as they try to stay balanced in the always choppy and morally confusing world of politics.

There's no question the show is extremely well acted. And the characters cover a wide range of jobs, temperaments, levels of honesty and ethics, while almost all remaining human beings (I do wish the leader of the far right party wasn't quite such a cartoon). The human problems the lead character faces as the pressure of high office takes its tolls on both her family and her ethics are believable and moving. And I loved that all the major characters are allowed to be flawed and make bad decisions while still being treated as decent people at heart.

Yet, for me there was something a bit too neat, a bit too old-school in the show's 'crisis of the week' approach, where almost every episode sometimes wildly complex political issues and situations manage to get resolved. While the personal issues are allowed to work in a more serialized way, evolving slowly over time, I don't love how the show pushes to close the book on a brand new political crisis almost every episode. It leads the show to need sudden convenient twists that can feel melodramatic at times, and sometimes makes our heroine just a little too perfect, a little too much smarter than everyone in the room for me to buy it.

None-the-less, a LOT is good in the show, and given it's near universal enthusiastic embrace (and the fact I certainly quite liked it, even if I didn't love it) I may just be forced to hang onto my blu-ray set, and one day give it another go.",1397260800,,2213,4.508728179551122
8449393,5,B004Z32E0M,"Highly recommend it!  A story of a woman at the top in government and her family. Plus, a story of a single newscaster (female) and lots of sub-plots.",1388707200,,150,4.357142857142857
8449394,5,B004Z32E0M,The best new political drama to come out in years. Smart  sharp writing.  Interesting how politics works in Denmark. Looking very much forward to season 2,1388620800,,154,4.884615384615385
8449395,4,B004Z32E0M,"What a fine piece of work...wish that the second and third season of this series were affordable and easily available in the USA.
The universality of power relations and personal dilemmas of a private life are skillfully bared. What is shown can happen in any society---the corruption, temptations towards authoritarian rule, the price individuals pay for conformity and dissent and the questionable triumphs of winners over losers.
This series stimulates much discussion, especially since the protagonist is a woman who has ultimately achieved control over her political destiny.",1381190400,,580,5.6022727272727275
8449396,5,B004Z32E0M,This show is  fabulous.  I have already seen season 2. Can't wait for season 3.  The acting is brilliant as well as the writing.  Amazing!!,1370131200,,139,4.44
8449397,5,B004Z32E0M,"Great political drama, plus you'll learn a lot about how parliamentary governments work.  This is the story of a fictional first female prime minister of Denmark.  The characters are completely believable and evolve convincingly over time.  Well written and well acted, 'Borgen' is a totally addicting series.",1366848000,,309,5.531914893617022
8449398,4,B004Z32E0M,"Oh, Denmark, oh, Denmark, how I love you, how I want to be in Copenhagen! Here we find Birgitte Nyborg, leader of the centre Moderate party, running for and becoming Prime Minister.  She is lovely, ambitious, brilliant, and honest. She has a wonderful home life, a husband who stays home with the kids. But, we all know, women can't have everything, and little by little things start to fall apart.

This is a classy tale of politics, before and after the general,election. Birgitte Nyborg, played by Sidse Babett Knuds becomes the country's first female prime minister. We meet spin doctors, ministers of various committees, political intrigue, scandals, love affairs. And everything that goes on in small towns. It seems as if Borgen is a small town. Nyborg's marriage suffers, her children act out as does her husband. What is she to do? We move along with her as she solves one problem after another. Many characters abound, and we come to love and hate some of them. The press and journalism are featured in all their glory. We see familiar faces from the Danish series, 'The Killing'. This is a glorious view of the Danish political scene.

The first ten episodes are spell bounding. I want to know more, thank goodness there are series two and three to come. The acting, the city, the politics are brilliant!

Highly Recommended. prisrob 01-12-13",1357948800,7,1353,4.8441558441558445
8449399,5,B004Z32E0M,"We really enjoyed the season series.  It takes some time to get to know the characters and for the overall theme of the series, (political power), to develop, but at the end of the first season, we were hooked.  I liked the quotes at the beginning of each episode and their relevancy.  Its heartbraking to see how the deals, schemes, and personal rivalries take their toll on each character.  There is no one who is bad in the series, and no violence, but the drama is real.

As usual, the scenery is beautiful, and the architecture is breathtaking.  We would like a blu ray of the second season as soon as possible.",1357516800,2,616,4.455357142857143
