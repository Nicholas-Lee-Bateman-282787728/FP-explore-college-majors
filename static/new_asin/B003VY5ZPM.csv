Wonderful",1379462400,,108,4.45
8407188,3,B003VY5ZPM,"I think the info in this is clear, well informed and well presented. However, I found it disappointing in that with the exception a few speed drawing examples this was essentially an animated slide talk with the same teaching strategies one would use learning from a book. Artists have been doing that for a long time so there is nothing wrong with it, but the reason I purchase DVDs, esp. the Gnomon DVDs is because watching the artists work and trying to draw along or mirror what they are doing is a much faster, efficient and more fun way to learn than something like ""here are some pictures and some basic info now practice drawing animal skeletons in different positions until you get good at it... next chapter"". For me, it is much better to be able to watch and draw along for a few skeletons before being sent off to do homework:) So while the info and simplification was great...cheaper animal anatomy books can give this to you. I make it clear that I value the knowledge and skill of the instructor and this is based on my personal learning preferences.",1366156800,4,1065,4.552083333333333
8407189,5,B003VY5ZPM,Marshall Vandruff is a master of his craft and it shows in this lesson on animal anatomy. You honestly can't find a better tutorial. He breaks down the drawing process into simplified views so that when you approach drawing an animal it won't feel so daunting. It is easy to follow and I can honestly say my animal and creature designs have improved immensely after watching this video!,1348185600,,386,4.6911764705882355
8407190,4,B003VY5ZPM,"Great video; all the bases are covered for understanding comparative animal structures; really clear use of a combination of hand drawing demos with animations. The soundtrack might put you to sleep, though.",1316563200,,207,5.5
