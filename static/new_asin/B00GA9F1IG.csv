8621580,1,B00GA9F1IG,"The studios of Argentina have been legendary in the quality of film coming out of there, but in this case their reputation is lessened considerably.

Really robotic acting (if you want to call it acting). It's as if a bunch of people got together and on the spur of the moment decided to make a film using really cheap Halloween props (African masks, lots of lit candles, really bad food colored fake blood) and some tiresomely old standby sacrifice to resurrect a dead person. In this case - who cares! Lots of illusions and memory flashbacks which are as cheap a filler as film making gets.

The memory of this movie is better left as dead.",1399075200,,642,4.525862068965517
8621581,1,B00GA9F1IG,"It's difficult to find ANY thing encouraging about this movie, so here it goes:
The movie starts with an idyllic scene of a middle aged couple..then there are 2 blood vomiting children...and the husband
of said couple dead in an empty pool...then getting up and diving into the pool, landing on his head again...
only to seeing him dying on his pillow on his bed...the survivors are all gathered speaking of said man...
only to find they are trapped in this house...which is a portal for the dead to return...or the living to be killed..
Only to find out that, their loving father, uncle, whatever has been molesting, sodomizing, and being quite an evil man...
that everyone would hate is being, ( By some satanic ritual), brought back from the dead, by the wife...only to be reunited with the homosexual son, who was really behind it, after all....
Confusing at best...not following any REAL PATH OF REALITY or train of thought in a plot.
My best intentions would be to offer to you...don't waste your money, or your time...The Director needs to go back to school and
find out what it is to make a VALID movie.",1398556800,,1111,4.644670050761421
8621582,3,B00GA9F1IG,"Ok this film is over the top gory and if you like this sort of thing you may enjoy the part it plays here.  Personally I don't like really gory films, but I could put up with it in this film because it is well made and has a good look to it and the special effects aren't so overdone as to destroy the human element.  Can't give away too much of even the basic plot without it being a spoiler, except to say a woman's husband dies unexpectantly in his sleep, so she brings together five of his friends who loved him to read them a special message that he requested they hear.  After that things go batty.  And bloody.  For all that I found the end somewhat predictable and that the ""sexual memories,"" shall we say, a bit disturbing, and also somewhat distracting from the main story, as it were.  This is also Spanish language with English subtitles only, so people frightened of subtitles will hate this movie.

Great Halloween party film -- just could have been a bit better.",1393718400,3,977,4.335164835164835
