3467129,5,B00006JE54,"This is one of the greatest science fiction movies that I have seen in a long time.  This is the stuff that cults are built upon.  You must have some intelligence though to enjoy it because there are some twists and turns that could through you off.  A person of low intelligence would probably not like this movie.  I lived through the early days of Star Trek on TV.  That is something that you can only experience once in a lifetime.  Though Lost on Mars is nothing like Star Trek, it really has its own style and is one of those movies that will draw you in and make you want more.  I'm pretty hyped up about this movie because this is the raw independent stuff that I like to see.  It has a great story line.  The photography is brilliant and the ending....well let's just say it blew me off my feet. I hope there will be sequel cause I will be looking for it.  I gave it five stars and I believe it deserves every one of them.",1054080000,8,931,4.122222222222222
3467130,5,B00006JE54,"My college friends and I watched this together and loved it.  We thought it was the best movie that we have seen for a long time.  We really loved Kelli Wilson, who played Giza.  She was cool.  We all gave it a thumbs up.  You need at least an average intelligence to understand this movie.  If you have one, you will like it.  If you don't, well, what can I say?",1053907200,5,363,4.028169014084507
3467137,2,B00006JE54,"The video is mostly of a good quality. The audio tends to vary from soft to loud depending on the scene. The plot isn't very good although the special effects are on par for a movie of this caliber. I would have liked to give this movie more stars but it doesn't rate more than 2. The Sci Fi movies of the 50s are way better than this movie.  In my humble opinion rent the movie if you want to, but do not buy it.",1399248000,,413,3.8588235294117648
3467138,1,B00006JE54,The premise of this film is good but the script and the acting are so bad that I can't even call this a B film. I could not even watch it all the way through which is unusual for me. Avoid at all cost even if it is free.,1396656000,,220,3.510204081632653
3467139,1,B00006JE54,"This is one of the worst, if not perhaps the worst sci-fi movie that I have ever seen! The acting, if you wish to call it that, was horrible, the set design would not impress a 5-year old kid and the dialog was just plain stupid. Don't waste your time with this piece of garbage!",1395360000,,279,4.090909090909091

3467141,1,B00006JE54,"I got suckered in by the two 5 star peoples rating. they surely must be friends or relatives to be this kind or is it blind.
Truly the worst acting I've ever seen. on the par of a grade school play performance. When I read the other 1 star reviews I was like really it can't be that bad after all 2 people gave it 5 stars,.nooo that was grandma and grandpa with their hearing aids and glasses off. Do not even waste a 1.99 on this you will be disappointed. it was not even bad funny, a true waste of time.",1391990400,3,505,3.9607843137254903
3467142,1,B00006JE54,Worst video I have seen in a long time.  Not even worth one star maybe a -2 star would be appropriate.,1378080000,,102,3.857142857142857
3467143,2,B00006JE54,"This was horrible.  I go for cheesy, but this was soooo bad...Not  one person could act. If you want a good laugh this is for you....",1373500800,2,133,4.076923076923077
3467144,1,B00006JE54,"Could not get past the ""feel"" of the movie being like someone took it on their cheap home video camera and got their friends to act on it.  Way below what is considered a ""B"" movie.",1358035200,7,181,4.027777777777778
3467145,1,B00006JE54,"Dumped out it was so bad. couple days later resumed. re-dumped. I have never in my life seen anything as pathetic. Some while back my brother converted our family's old super-8 films to VHS, and dubbed sound tracks of commentary and vocal 'interpretations' over. Much, much better production. This must have been generated as some sort of psychology 101 experiment, because nobody in their right minds could suffer thru more than 5 minutes of this absurdity. It's clearly in the ""make it stop... please, God, make it stop"" category. Still, it's better than anything I could do.",1357257600,5,577,4.958762886597938
3467146,1,B00006JE54,"I did not trust the naysayers who warned how bad this movie really is. Instead, I trusted in the glowing reviews that this was in fact a science-fiction movie worth seeing. I will be happy if I have not suffered a deep psychological trauma from viewing a small portion of this cinematic abortion. The acting is terrible and without emotion. The visual quality reminds of the camcorders that you could buy for a pre-schooler that recorded on a standard cassette tape. Awful does not even begin to describe this atrocity.",1355702400,2,519,4.777777777777778

3467148,1,B00006JE54,"Don't waste Your time or money. You can not be repaid enough to compensate You for what You'll lose watching this atrocity. Any high ratings given this mess must be from the individuals who will profit from the sale of this mind numbing media. Just as a final comment,to put the overall quality of this production to include acting into perspective it looked as though the space crafts crew seats safety harnesses were actually made from orange gift wrapping ribbon!",1329177600,10,466,4.8375
3467149,1,B00006JE54,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... and I like shlock! There is no actual acting anywhere in the film. It's as if the people hired to play parts are reading their lines off cue cards. Lines are delivered with almost no emotional content and what there is tends to be completely wrong.

The screenwriter needs to wake up and take a hard look around. Many of the actions taken in the film make no rational sense. While I completely understand the need for literary devices, they should at least have some grounding in the real world.

I have no idea why some reviewers gave this movie high marks. Perhaps they watched a different film. If I could have, I would've given this movie zero stars.",1299369600,14,705,4.415384615384616
3467150,5,B00006JE54,"Being a collage student at the university of wisconsin Parkside I have seen many science fiction movies, but this one is great! The story is intriguing, the astronauts travel back in time and crash on mars only to find an ancient civilization. It has romance and action and a crazy twist. I don't want to ruin it for any one. It is one of the best independent films I have seen in a long time. It is hard to find good directed independent films out there, everyone with a digital camera thinks they can make a movie and they cant. I see great things to come from Westfield Entertainment group. ~Brittany~",1273104000,4,604,4.45045045045045

3467152,5,B00006JE54,"I found this to be an excellent movie, the story is very good. I liked this movie because the story was so interesting. If you're expecting a lot of flashing lights and kiddy whistles then you might not like it; this movie is based mainly on what it might have been like before mars became a desolate lifeless planet. I enjoyed most of the actors and Giza was great. I would highly recommend this movie if you want a good story about science fiction to watch. Low budget yes, but that made it that much more interesting to watch. The later part of the movie was the best for me.",1273017600,5,578,4.263636363636364
3467153,4,B00006JE54,"As I watched Lost on Mars for the first time, I thought to myself that this is going to be a silly movie.  As it went on, and I started to understand the story a little better, I got quite involved.  The story really picks up once they crash on Mars and meet up with the Siperion Empire.  I've seen several science fiction movies about Mars.  The ones I have seen, were pretty boring because once they got to Mars, there was nothing really to do except walk around a pick up rocks.  Lost on Mars is nothing like that.  It has a story, action, romance and a lot of entertainment compared to watching astronauts pick up rocks while sand blows in their faces.  There were a couple of scenes that I could have definetly left behind.  But, overall, I enjoyed it.  Directed by Eric Shook  Actors: Kelli Wilson, Megan Glosser, David Long, Gretchen Maxwell.",1132790400,2,849,4.419354838709677
3467154,5,B00006JE54,"A great movie to watch. I enjoyed the whole concept that there was life on Mars at one time. I also thought it was very interesting that our society had the technology to travel back in time to visit. There are several Mars movies out circulating around for sale, but Lost on Mars is by far the best one I have seen to date.  Director Eric Shook brings back good, old fashioned movie making.  Kelli Wilson does an upbeat performance but she does not downplay any of the other notable actors or actresses.  David Long, Gretchen Maxwell and Megan Glosser provide their own story very well.  Shook also does a pleasant job within his role as a barbarian.  I also liked Julia Gommell, who played the head of the Siperion outpost.  She showed authority and a strong ability to act in any given situation.  We cannot forget one of her sidekicks, played by Brittany Wisovaty, who I think stood out with a very powerful and energetic performance.  Lost on Mars was good, clean entertainment and left me wanting to watch it again.",1128988800,6,1021,4.571428571428571
3467155,4,B00006JE54,"The mastermind behind this movie brings you one great tale about a trip to Mars.  It is told like no other.  I saw both ""Lost on Mars"" and the sequel ""Empire of Danger"".  I will be giving my comments on ""Empire of Danger"" later.  In my opinion, the best actors in the movie were David Long, John T. Oertling, Eric E. Shook and Meagan Glosser.  Kelli Wilson, one of the leads in this movie, did a so-so job.  I couldn't help thinking, though,  that I was watching one of the munchkins from ""The Wizard of Oz"".  It was just hard for me to believe that she was a great warrior when she is such a short person.  They should have stood her on a vegetable crate.  That would have made it more believable.  Other than that, I still give this movie a thumbs up.

Bad lighting, bad sound, bad editing, bad composition, bad coverage, bad acting, bad directing, bad special effects, bad (but ambitious) storyline, I don't even remember any of the score.

8279592,5,B00006JE54,"It's obviously a low-budget flick shot on a shoestring budget, but that's really part of the overall charm. The story is an intricate mix of space travel, time travel and rebellion. It's like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" meets ""Game Of Thrones"". The acting is certain subpar in a number of instances, but, on the plus side, Kelly Wilson is quite fetching in her role and an absolute tour-de-force performance is delivered by David Long. I wish they would have found a way to include him in the sequel, ""Empire of Danger"", but I hear that Long was too busy doing dinner theater in Branson to appear.

In short, this is one of those ""So bad, it's good"" movies that you watch with your friends on a humdrum Saturday night. So, turn off your minds, crack open some beers, relax and enjoy this movie.",1432166400,2,792,4.5

Many of the poor reviews are spot on: we were a bunch of college kids with no acting experience who did this solely to say we did it. All the props and costumes were handmade(the hard work of one dedicated woman on a budget, bless her), and the script was written by a guy who loved science fiction but had no talent. All in all, a truly homemade project done just for fun but not worth watching and in no way worth buying! My apologies to those whose money and time were wasted.... We didn't even know how bad it would be! Sincerely, Kelli Wilson, the original Giza",1407283200,2,687,4.134328358208955

I gave this a one star rating because they at least used a quality cell phone to shoot the film, maybe a Nokia 1020. As a warning I would say if a film doesn't have a trailer rent it. Then if you like it buy, however with this ""movie"" I would pay serious money to have it removed from Amazon's inventory.",1399248000,,408,3.9878048780487805
