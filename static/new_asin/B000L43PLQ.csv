8160247,4,B000L43PLQ,"A great buy for 20 bucks used! Bare boned releases with few extras except Forrest Gump, which is the 2 disc version. All of the films are 16 X 9 enhanced for widescreen EXCEPT Titanic! Very annoying!!",1173139200,11,200,4.4324324324324325
8160248,5,B000L43PLQ,"It's rare these days for the Oscar winner for Best Picture to be something that actually drew a sizable audience. This is a pretty good collection of seven more modern movies that did just that.

""The Godfather"", the oldest of the bunch (1972), holds up the best over time. In cinematography, casting, acting, and plot it is simply perfect. ""Terms of Endearment"" (1983) is a different kind of mother/daughter story than you usually see on screen - the kind where the mother holds the daughter in only ""medium esteem"". ""Forrest Gump"" (1994) just defies categorization. Forrest is a zen-like character with limited intelligence who manages to stumble into every major world event of his lifetime and come out on top. Even though it was adapted from a popular novel, on film it could have as easily bombed as it could have been the blockbuster it became. ""Braveheart"" (1995) is a great film about man's desire for freedom trumping everything else, even his desire to live.

1997's ""Titanic"" made the most money and won many Academy awards that year, but personally, I feel as time passes, it will probably be considered one of the cheesier films to win the Academy's highest honor. Director James Cameron's message of rich equals shallow and bored, poor equals fulfilled and happy just seems more and more simplistic and, quite frankly, sappy as I grow more accustomed to the film's tremendous special effects. 1999's ""American Beauty"", about the last year of life of a man in a dysfunctional family seemed OK when I first saw it, but you really have to have seen Alan Ball's series ""Six Feet Under"" to really get it. Ball writes the best dysfunctional characters since David Lynch. I thought ""Gladiator"" (2000) was indeed a great picture, and although Russell Crowe's Maximus comes to life to the point where some people actually believe he is a historical figure from the Roman Empire, I still think Tom Hanks was unfairly passed over for Best Actor in his tremendous performance in ""Castaway"".

These films don't really have any one theme in common, other than being a collection of seven of the better modern films to win the Academy's highest honors that also achieved blockbuster status. It really is a good value and I highly recommend it. All films included are the widescreen editions, but there are no extras worth mentioning except for the two-disc edition of Forrest Gump.",1170288000,7,2381,4.888613861386139
