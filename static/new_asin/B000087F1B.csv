7979551,4,B000087F1B,"Both are good, typical Roy Rogers westerns. Andy Devine is always fun. The Sons of the Pioneers sound terrific and there's plenty of action. The TruColor print is very good...not excellent, but for the money, it's fun entertainment.",1347148800,,232,5.131578947368421
7979552,5,B000087F1B,"VCI Entertainment and Republic Pictures present the first of a double feature...""Under California Stars"" (1948) (digitally remastered in Dolby), long running Roy Rogers series turned out in the early '40s...the story line is excellent with outstanding productions and hours worth of entertainment....here's the plot laid out for us as Roy completes his latest film he goes back to his ranch for a radio broadcast...Roy arrives only to find Cookie has hired many of his relatives who look very much like (Andy Devine stars and plays are the parts)...another relative Caroline the horse trainer (looks nothing like Cookie) is the love interest for Roy...now the plot thickens as a gang of men hired by Pop Sherman (leader-boss) are gathering herds of wild range horses...Roy puts a stop to hunting on his land...will Pop come up with a scheme to kidnap Trigger and ask for $100,000 ransom...can a small boy Ted and his dog Tramp help in setting a trap for the gang of kidnappers or his just being led astray...this is a suspenseful tale and as Roy and his ranch buddies go to rescue Trigger...can Little Ted keep a secret or will he come through with the information that Roy needs to get Trigger back...it's brilliantly filmed in Trucolor don't miss any of the thrilling adventures of Roy and Trigger down some Happy Trailers.

Under director William Witney with story Paul Gangelin, screenplay by Sloan Nibley and Paul Gangelin...the cast include Roy Rogers (Roy Rogers), Trigger (smartest horse in the movies), Jane Frazee (Caroline Bullfincher), Andy Devine (Cookie Bullfincher & Alf Bullfincher), George Lloyd (Pop Jordan), Bob Nolan (Bob), Pat Brady (Pat), Hugh Farr (Singer/Ranch hand), Doye O'Dell (Doye, Sons of the Pioneers), Wade Crosby (Lige McFarland), Michael Chapin (Ted Carver), House Peters Jr (Ed), Steve Clark (Sheriff), Joseph A. Garro (John the Banker), Paul Power (Movie Director Paul), John Wald (KTX Radio Announcer)...another Roy Rogers B-Western provided by Republic Pictures during their heyday in the early '40s.

The second feature on the double bill from VCI Entertainment and Republic Pictures is ""Bells of San Angelo"" (1947) (digitally remastered), filmed in Trucolor...in my humble opinion this is one of the best screenplays...the story line is a good one and the pace is steady and exciting...the head of the bad guys is Gridley who has a worthless mine and is bringing silver into the United States from Mexico...our hero Roy who just happens to be a Border Guard has been trying to find the secret entrance that Gridley has been using...can Roy figure out who's who and what goes where...can Lee Madison help Roy bring the villains to justice and not get into any trouble herself...never fear we've got Trigger on the job, will he prevail just like in past pictures...there are some wonderful songs ""Hot Lead,"" and ""I Like to Get Up Early in the Morning.""...leave it to Andy Devine as the sheriff to come up with loads of comedy...Roy was never in better voice.
