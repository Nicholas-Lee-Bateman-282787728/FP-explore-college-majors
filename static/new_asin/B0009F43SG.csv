The Heew Haw Shows were a Summer replacement Series for the Smother Brothers Comedy Hour, each week co-hosts Buck Owens and Roy Clark and the Cast of Comedians and Musicians would Welcome the Biggest Stars in Country Music to Performed their Songs and to deliver the One-Liners

Hee Haw Ranked in the Top 20 Nationwide. Every Episode is about 50 Minutes long in Full Color. I never get tired of watching Hee Haw and the old style of Country Music with the Original Instruments nothing like today, most Artists don't even use the Steel Guitar any more which by the way it goes back to 1922 and earlier. The Hee Haw Collection Episodes are Part of American Musical History and I love to be able to watch them and Collect Them! ...Thank You D.D.",1356307200,,2033,4.864161849710983
8059939,3,B0009F43SG,CD is what I expected - reruns of the old Hee Haw show.  This was useful for me in writing a script for an amateur production of Hee Haw.,1303776000,,137,3.7241379310344827
8059940,5,B0009F43SG,This was a real treat for me.  I am an avid fan of Waylon and Jessi so I will enjoy wathing this over and over and remember when we were all young and beautiful!!!,1249516800,,163,3.7941176470588234
8059941,5,B0009F43SG,"My friends and I often quarrel about which episode of hee haw was the best while on the Asschowder tour bus. I know we're not alone in doing this. Burns seems to think 485 was the best, J-abs is a huge fan of 265, Kroll loves 122 and I go with episode 72. I could not believe my luck when they put episode 72 out on DVD. This has everything that made Hee Haw an american classic. It had geetar playin, Roy Clark at his apex, some hicks, Waylon Jennings and slapstick shenanigans. The first time I saw episode 72 I spit 7-up at our dog and peed my pants. That's what happens when comedy is pure genius. Hee Haw was much more sophisticated than most people give it credit for. It's really just like Knight Rider without Hasslehoff or a talking car. You just sub in a fence and silliness. I was so influenced by episode 72 that I wrote a song called, ""Hee Haw 72 made me pee my pants"" that is now an Asschowder staple. It talks about the effect Hee Haw had on all of us as kids and teenagers. What guy on a date didn't get out his beta copies of Hee Haw to put his ladyfriend in the mood? Ladies love the Haw. Well, that and my javelin.

Anyway, if you want to get closer to Asschowderness, get episode 72. You'll thank me in three to six weeks.",1182297600,9,1242,4.090163934426229
