8372109,3,B002KLQ2YU,"This movie is dubbed in English.  The story is too simple, but the kung-fu choreography was well done.  Story is a guy comes to town in search of his friend in order to get a job and live.  He was broke with no shoes, but he had kung-fu.  His friend warned him not to show off his kung-fu in this town as it will only get him into trouble.  The company his friend worked in was a fabric weaving company, but there was a competitor who needed the same workers, so the competitor would use various trickeries to lure employees away including money and force.  To shield the company from losing their workers, they train their employees basic kung-fu.  So the new kid in town decided that he could be better used as a kung-fu master in the company and showed off his kung-fu that helped him rise with promotion after promotion.  Soon, he was able to have new shoes, new clothes, new home and his favorite, a new watch.  He was even offered a new girlfriend.  However, what goes up, must come down, so the competitor constantly challenged him until he lost it all with his life.  His friend then had to revenge for him even though his friend was very disappointed at how he just wanted more and more, and then lost it all.",1505779200,,1218,4.345132743362832
8372110,5,B002KLQ2YU,Shaw brothers. Are the best kung fu movie? In the world. I love everything by Shaw Brothers. I remember in Houston. Unsettling afternoon and morning. It was so nice movies.

8372111,4,B002KLQ2YU,"Named the Invincible One here in the US, Disciples of Shaolin follows the rise to power of a country bumpkin who happens to be a very capable kung fu artist (Fu Sheng) & its tragic consequences. Also in this film is Chi Kuan Chun who plays his friend who recommends him for a job at the textile mill. Slowly Fu Sheng moves up rapidly in the company, much against the urging of Chi Kuan Chun not to get involved in the company's power struggle with a rival business. The baddies in this one include Chiang Tao & Fung Hak On. Only 4 stars for me because it wasn't as action packed as your normal Chang Cheh fare.

Once again, Fu Sheng sells you on his role as the naive bumpkin which would cost him dearly. That too sours me on this film a bit. But his martial art skill is really at its tip top. Chi Kuan Chun, when forced into action, holds his own & then some. This is the movie that sent Fu Sheng's star skyrocketing & rightfully so. An absolute must for Fu Sheng fans as well as lovers of the kung fu genre.",1491955200,,1010,4.126903553299492
8372112,5,B002KLQ2YU,"I enjoyed this movie especially a young rising star like Fu Sheng during his era. Unfortunately, he died young at age 28 like in his movies. Rest in peace!!!",1488067200,,157,4.448275862068965
8372113,5,B002KLQ2YU,"One of the better entries from SB. Brothers are both expert fighters but the better brother refuses to capitalize on his skills, until family loyalties demand it. Good action sequences.",1485648000,,185,5.2
