7889003,5,6305435332,"I was so impressed by the contents of this video that I drove all the way to Redwood City in California, about 400 miles, to train with this teacher. It was worth it! I don't know why but you seldom hear about the really good  teachers, they don't seem to want, or be able to ""sell""  themselves. Mr. Oshiro might never have been heard of if this video had not  been made, yet he is one of the best instructors I have ever trained with,  and he has lived in California for years. Coming back to the video, I  bought it because my friend bought part 1 and I agreed to buy part 2 so we  could share. Subsequently we have both bought sets, and I also bought the  Yamanni Ryu staff video from the same author/production company. Unlike the  average martial arts video this is made in a studio with lots of camera  angles and really good lighting. You can see absolutely everything and they  go to great lengths to explain the details. They are also smart enough to  let the movements speak for themselves when the author is performing. The  soundtrack is superb-who would have thought of mixing classical Western  music with Okinawan karate-and the production values very high. The  author's wife, who is an internationally acclaimed traditional dancer  apparently, added a great deal of style to an already stylish production  with a performance that was enhanced with some very clever editing. Great  karate and a wonderfully well done production made this a memorable video  for me, and one that I watch constantly.",950400000,3,1513,4.645283018867924
7889004,4,6305435332,"As a student of Oshiro sensei, I am very happy that this video is being marketed outside of Dragon Times/Tsunami productions and receiving wide acceptance. The production is extremely professional and brings out the  mastery of Oshiro sensei. Uchinadi II also has a treat for Yamanni-ryu  kobudo practitioners in that it shows two sai katas in a way that only  Oshiro sensei could perform! I hope that in future productions Tsunami will  incorporate more bunkai oyo applications for viewers to appreciate the  power and grace of Oshiro sensei's karate.",946252800,,552,5.157303370786517
7889005,5,6305435332,"I am truly delighted with this video and all the other martial arts tapes produced by TSUNAMI. They provide such a wealth of instructive material that, as a karate instructor - in France - I find myself referring to them  constantly both for my own progress and also as teaching material for my  three weekly classes. I even use sections from tapes ( such as KOBUDO  dealing with weapons) not directly linked to my own style of karate and  incorporate them in my teaching. I  have even started to learn from the  tape UCHINADI the wonderful white crane kata so masterfully demonstrated by  a Japanese master. Throughout the series, the  photography is truly superb,  the explanations are crystal clear and the accompanying text and musical  background make these tapes compulsive and highly enjoyable viewing! I was  - until now - so accustomed to the ""average"" martial arts tapes  shot in a bare training room and with poor commentary that I was astounded  by the very high quality of the TSUNAMI tapes. I understand that more are  scheduled and I can't wait to buy them. I would not hesitate to recommend  the TSUNAMI tapes to martial arts instructors and  students alike and I  would definitely give these tapes top rating.
Ces vidos TSUNAMI sont  franchement remarquables. Elles offrent un contenu trs riche  tous les  niveaux pour ceux qui veulent amliorer et diversifier leurs techniques.  Filmes de manire vraiment professionnelle, elles sont aussi un plaisir  pour l'il et pour l'oreille. Je les regarde souvent,  la fois pour mieux  matriser les techniques mais aussi pour le plaisir. Je les recommande  vivement aux instructeurs et aux pratiquants de tout niveau. Elles ne  manqueront pas d'enrichir leur connaissance de la discipline qu'ils  pratiquent mais aussi des arts martiaux en gnral.",925171200,,1802,5.020338983050848
