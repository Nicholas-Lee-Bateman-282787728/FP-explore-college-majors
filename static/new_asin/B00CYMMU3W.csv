5752066,3,B00CYMMU3W,"I think I counted 4 new engines for parents to buy (2 are introduced solely to race around and are obviously just for marketing, which I understand but frustrates me). The usual narrator is replaced by a man that sounds a lot like Ringo Starr. He really makes me miss the old narrator's voice and story telling cadence.

The main point, however, is that my two boys loved the movie, as they love all Thomas shows and movies. They asked to watch it again the next day, the toddler equivalent of ""two thumbs up""! :)",1380240000,2,513,4.4
5752067,5,B00CYMMU3W,"My boys had been begging for this movie long before it was out (thanks to the new trains arriving on the shelves at the toy store this past summer).  We also picked up the book and read it over the summer several times.  When the DVD arrived they sat and enjoyed it all the way through.  I, however, completely missed Michael Brandon's voice as the narrator (they used the English narrator guy).  After listening to countless Thomas episodes and movies over the past 8 years (I have three boys spread out), I really appreciate Michael Brandon's storytelling and missed him on this DVD.  The train voices sounded the same though.

Enjoyable movie with some new engines to add to the collection to keep it fresh.  Don't look for new themes, an old engine gets a new chance at life (like Hiro) and gets stuck in a tunnel (like Thomas in Mysty Island), but at least the kids like it and it has a good message.",1380153600,3,905,4.448484848484848

5752070,5,B00CYMMU3W,My three and a half year old son loves it.  He has watched over and over now and still gets starry eyed over it.  It does have some funny moments and very much the true Thomas and Friends intake.,1379894400,,195,3.9743589743589745
5752071,5,B00CYMMU3W,"King of the Railway is an awesome movie with a few funny moments in it! If you ever saw the model series of Thomas the Tank Engine, you might recognize a moment when Toby mentions Henry (spoken from a true Thomas fan point of view). Overall, it is a great film and I recommend it to kids and Thomas fans (like my daughter).",1379721600,,323,4.142857142857143
5752072,5,B00CYMMU3W,"My son has been a fan of Thomas and Friends movies for over two and a half years now (he turned 4 in August).  Each one he has seen brings fun and good life lessons throughout.  This one is really no different.  The movie's description at the top should suffice for what this tale is about.

King of The Railway shares many similarities with the other Thomas and Friends movies (which doesn't hurt this most recent film).  Thomas is always learning an important lesson, while those around him witness some of the issues brought up by said lesson.  Gordon and Spencer debate about the ""fastest engine on Sodor."" Percy gets bashful and inquisitive on occasion.  James worries about his paint. Thomas tries to keep a secret that conflicts with making others happy.  Discovering/Seeing a 'new' engine that needs repairing.  All of these themes should be familiar if you've seen any of the previous movies, but nevertheless, play well into this new adaptation.  It's done in a way that doesn't quite seem 'old hat.'

The fresh spin on this particular film seems to be a nod towards the usefulness of the elderly.  Stephen, the 'new' broken down engine tells stories of long ago, when he was known as the ""Rocket,"" for his speed.  But because of the strength and speed of today's engines, he has been left behind for quite some time. The Earl of Sodor has a special job for Stephen, but doesn't want to reveal it until the time is right.  So the Earl entrusts Thomas to remain quiet about it until that time comes.  Thomas sees that Stephen really WANTS to be useful, but what use could an ""old, broken down engine"" be put to?  Since it's in his nature to please those around him, Thomas becomes conflicted about his promise to the Earl in wanting to tell Stephen about his intended purpose.  The viewer is also introduced to three other new engines: Conner, Kaitlyn, and Millie, all with small roles of their own.  The rest, you'll have to watch, since I intend to keep this spoiler-free.

As far as the quality of the DVD goes, I must admit that this movie is the best picture quality I've seen on a standard DVD.  My wife and I were going to get the Blu Ray version, but it wasn't in stock at the time, and my child had really wanted to watch this movie.  So we picked up the standard version and popped it in the player.  Crisp, bright colors, very little line blurring, and lots of detail filled the screen (with no letterboxing).  The audio is just as nice, blending the background, vocal, and music levels to their appropriate heights.  We found that we didn't have to play with the volume when the trains were talking.

Overall, I'd call this a perfect fit for anyone's Thomas Collection (even if some of it seems repetitive).  They visit locations from previous films, along with some cameos from those movies.  You might find that you'll get a kick out of it as much as your kids do.  Mine asked to watch it again the very next day.  Worth the price for the standard DVD, but if Blu Ray is your preference, go for it.  I think there is only a five dollar difference between the two.",1379462400,19,3086,4.508108108108108
5752073,5,B00CYMMU3W,"My five year old was a train lover practically since birth and it was love at first sight with him and the Thomas & Friends trains. As he's gotten older and his attention span longer, he seems less interested in the regular show that's just around ten minutes long. He has been anxiously awaiting the release of the next Thomas movie that he could really get into so it was a happy day when we got King of the Railway in the mail!

After seeing so many Thomas DVD's I am almost as familiar with them as Reed and I noticed some differences in this movie right away. Everything seems to be a bit more modern and updated from the music to the plot to the newly introduced characters. Thomas has been around for a long time so it's refreshing to see it updated every once in a while.

I really enjoyed watching this movie with my kids! I always like movies with a good plot and life lessons for my kids. Thomas and his Friends are great examples of working together and solving problems and this movie is no exception.

Paige was really into this movie too because of the ""royal"" theme since she in fact thinks she's royalty and the new trains included two new girl engines. We think it's about time some new ladies joined them! Paige has always been into the ""boy"" shows and toys and most of them only have a couple token girl characters so it's always nice when there's new ones she can enjoy as well.

In our house Thomas &  Friends: King of the Railway is the true royal event of the year!",1379289600,38,1489,4.284697508896797

This particular movie is a good one - the kids prefer it over many other (though not as good as 'Hero of the Rails') Thomas the Train videos.  Highly recommend this for those 2 to 4 or even 5 years old - especially the little boys who love or might love trains. Both my boy and girl enjoy these shows and it is great they can enjoy these shows together. The shows are wholesome and thankfully don't introduce any  immoral topics, any questionable topics or language, they stay away from political issues or underlying liberal messages, etc. I would say they are super G rated - you cant get much better than these if you are trying to raise moral chilren who will be a contribution to society.

Also nice little lesson in history (nothing ground-breaking, just nice).

5752570,4,B00CYMMU3W,"Having just read the stories again, I was pleased to see they incorporated the bridge from the main land, and that Henry no longer needs special coal.  I was disappointed in the voice change for Diesel -- if he pronounced the letter r the voice would be a close match.  I noticed Henry didn't have any speaking lines though.  Happy to see all main engines in the story, not just a scene or two.

The story is good, positive, interesting, and I can see potential for adding the characters to future stories.  The island has always had a ruined castle -- I have no problem that they built it up to match this story line.  When we watch the old stories we'll just see the old castle as what this one used to be.

I think the story is great for an experienced Thomas fan.  I get concerned when the scene change rate is really high compared to the older non-animated ones.  I have a feature on my TV to make the screen smaller, so I do that so this visual is not as overwhelming.  The Thomas movies, including this one aren't too bad, but a couple spots the scenes change too quickly for what I like for my toddler, but brief enough.",1380412800,4,1128,4.253521126760563

  As an adult fan, I'm holding HIT Entertainment's feet to the fire for this one.
  I gave it a two because their previous movies were PIXAR-like in production and QC; King of the Railways looked rushed.
  Most of the imagry was great, but there were too many items that QC missed in post-production.
  Their movies are supposed to be better than this; quality wise.
.
The good...
  The BEST lesson ever to be learned in Thomas and Friends happens at 25m:30s
  The texturing is amazing, except for the water
  The story is fun and enjoyable
  My twin boys light up when they hear Millie's voice; guess they will be suckers for ladies that speak with French accent.
.
The bad...
  The mouths of some of the characters ocasionally extend past their eyes; normally they shouldn't go any wider than the pupals.
  The Island of Sodor looks to be too close to the mainland; yes I know they are close, but not THAT close.
  The unused sections of railway are shiny and bright, not rusted and dull like in Hero of the Rails.
  The water looks like liquid mercury; it looked fantastic in Misty Island Rescue.
  Spencer is too shiny; so much so that you cannot read his name plate.
  Rheneas has been re-repainted back to his original red, from the yellow at the end of Blue Mountain Mistry
  They re-used an original song from Blue Mountain Mistry; all they did was change a few lines to make it fit into the story.

I like that we got to see a French engine for once. Connor and Caitlin are pointless to the story but are pretty alright. The Earl (Sir Robert Norramby) was very entertaining. I like the Gordon and Spencer subplot. I enjoyed the action as well. I'm glad Jack the front loader returned (but I hate his square face). Also Skarloey knows about the track to the old mine, but when Thomas was looking for him, Skarloey did not say anything.

Has a nice story/plot, introduces some new characters, there is comedy and mystery combined. Since seeing this, I have purchased some of the wooden train characters so kids can recreate some if the scenes on their train tables.",1486684800,,491,4.406593406593407
