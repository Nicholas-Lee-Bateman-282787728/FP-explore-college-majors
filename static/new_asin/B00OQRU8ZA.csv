8684591,5,B00OQRU8ZA,Great series.  Set exactly as described.  Arrived super fast!,1428969600,,61,5.666666666666667
8684592,5,B00OQRU8ZA,"I think Coppelion is very informative and creative anime that tackles the tough subject of nuclear energy. As the story continues, you see each individual character show signs of positive growth that is not usually seen in other anime. I hope in the future GoHands makes more Coppelion anime episodes that show Medical Crews interactions with other Coppelions and Dr. Coppelius.",1426636800,,378,5.213114754098361
8684593,5,B00OQRU8ZA,I was very surprised by this anime I bought it on a whim and it come out being something I completely enjoyed.  This show has a great sense of drama and has great emotional content that is conveyed better than I have seen in most other Anime. In this show you follow 3 genetically engineered young women on their mission to save survivors from a DMZ  caused by a geographic catastrophe.  This is their first interaction with natural humans and we see how these innocent creatures try and make sense out of the actions of the people they encounter.  This aspect was what really made me love this show. There is also a lot of really cool action and an awesome gas mask wearing division of rogue soldiers as villains for Coppelion to over come and finish their job so this is a very well rounded show that has a lot to offer some one looking for a socially conscious sci fi epic!,1423180800,9,876,4.355828220858895
8684594,5,B00OQRU8ZA,"Let me be up front on this anime. lets start with what it is not it is not:
Fan Service
harem
ecchi
henti
or anything like Highschool DXD, HOTD, Maken Ki, etc
What it is about is how the human race messed up tokyo so bad over corprate greed that there was a very tragic nuke incident that left the city uninhabitable. They evaced best they could and walled the city in. That time the govt made experimental clones with the ability to not be effected by the high level contamination in the city and trained in a special high school for thier duties to be done in that forsaken city. It centers around 3 girls who comprise a ""rescue team"" to find and evac or bring to a LZ any serviors that are found. They pretty much trained for everything but the actual part on ""how to emotionally deal"" with the actual job like loseing a victom. I do like this series it is a well played and thought out story. There is some over the top stuff but no fan service type of stuff at all. The only issue age wise viewing this is relateing to disaster sences some 13/14 YO will not have an issue with it younger ones may require alot of explaining",1421539200,14,1128,4.202764976958525
