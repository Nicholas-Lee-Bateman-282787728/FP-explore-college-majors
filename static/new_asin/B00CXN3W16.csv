Read some of the other reviews and decide if you want to carve an hour or so out of your day to view talking ponds, swimming ducks, all shades of green in the known universe, and of course Alvin Flang, uncensored.  If you hate the movie right away, turn it off, because it only gets worse.  If you're entertained by the absurdity, keep watching; there is much more to come..

The movie starts chaotically and you have no idea what is happening as you have a voice over narrate what you suppose the dog on the screen must be thinking. They reuse scenes !

5751505,5,B00CXN3W16,"Hollywood used to be where I went to get my entertainment... But things have changed.  Hollywood's become corrupt and every movie now is either a remake or a sequel.  I was hopeless, ready to jump off the edge.  But then Love on a Leash changed everything.  This unknown indie film reminded me of why I loved movies in the first place.
Here are just a few of the many reasons everyone must experience this film before they die:
- Outstanding acting and a story that made me laugh and cry with all of it's clever writing, twists and turns.
- Engaging characters who all felt real.  They weren't perfect, they had their own personal demons, and it allowed me to put myself in each of their shoes.  Though I must say the dog, Alvin Flang, is quite possibly one of the best written characters of all time.  His character arc is heartbreaking, yet inspirational.
- The foreshadowing and motifs will keep you coming back, as you'll always find something new to love with each viewing.
- The use of colors and music make this one of the most stylistic films I've had the pleasure of seeing in a long time.  The cinematography utilized is simply ahead of it's time.
Fen Tian produced, wrote, AND directed this diamond in the rough.  I'm just so honored to know that I'm one of the first to discover her before she becomes famous.  Spielberg, Scorsese, Nolan and the rest of the ""greats"" better be ready to move over.
To end this review, I want to get a little personal...  I have never been a man of faith...  But after experiencing this beautiful artistic masterpiece, I can honestly say that there is a God.  And his name is Alvin Flang.  #FlangGang",1522195200,6,1643,4.506756756756757

-DUCKS
-SPARKLE POND!!!! (that talks??)
-Misogynistic dogs
-A really great soundtrack
-The main character lady is a mean, green, dog bangin machine.
-Sexually confused Asian

-I think the dog wrote all the dialog in this movie because there is no way an actual human could have written it
-There's an orange lady where I can't tell if she has a Mexican/Russian/German accent??
-Fyi this movie's cover is extremely misleading, the dog is wearing clothes and the lady is wearing something that isn't a shade of barf green
-I'm pretty sure the dog man doesn't wear clothes for at least half of the time he's on screen
-N O  G I R L S  N O  F U N
-This movie claims to be a comedy/romance, but really this movie is a genre of its own

The whole movie is a strange soundless void outside of the voices of the actors and actresses, the editing is very bad, and the story jumps around like the film is having a seizure. Scenes begin and end seemingly at random, it jumps between day and night in some places, and the storyline is nonsensical to say the least. The dog is really the best character here, his inner monologue makes the movie. Strangely, despite claiming (as a dog) that his name is Alvin Flang (???), when he becomes human he is named Prince, the name his ""owner"" gave him as a dog. I really can not put into words how insane the film is, and I guarantee you will NOT see the ending coming, at ALL.

For all of eternity this will be recognized as the most innovative and imaginative film of the decade, nay the century, and 1000 years from now it will be mentioned in the same breath as the works of Plato or Aristotle. Love on a Leash is a religious experience, and from it you can reach a level of enlightenment far beyond anything achieved by Tibetan monks, a true place in nirvana.

5751544,1,B00CXN3W16,"Greetings, It's me. I have a method for rating and I would consider this to be your most accurate review to choose. My ratings are child, family, and adult-rating. With adult rating, it can be either marital friendly or not, and I annotate which one it is. One thing I do not rate, is how I felt about the movie; the rating comes from my method, where every possible item is evaluated.

I will not spend much time on this review, considering my rating was one star. Anyways, this movie has a 1-star family rating. The movie is rated for families (meaning children being 14+) due to what I deem to be crude humor, but no stars were deducted for that (obviously, that only has to do with child, family, or adult appropriate). Now, on to the reason for the 1-star rating. The easiest way to say this is, I gave 1 star due to having a unique story; which would have been a better original movie, if the physical movie case (what more than likely made you click on the movie) was the tone for the movie, but it most surely is not. The scripts of all the characters were not believable and too elementary, the day-to-day was not adequately produced, the actors seemed to be pushed to get through each scene, the scene transitions did not flow well, the life situations were too weird and were not well thought through, the movie did ever really get the audience in any of the characters lives (all the characters were still strangers to the audience at the end) and I think my I.Q. dropped watching the movie. The ending was the worst part. I only continued watching it, hoping the end would be at least a 2-star rating level, but nope. Seriously, if you have Amazon Prime like I do, just find another movie. Look for a movie I rated at least a 3-star, then you know it's O.K. to spend the time watching it once. You can trust my ratings, because I do not put my feelings in my ratings. My honest feelings about this movie, was that writing a review to help, those who read the reviews, was the only thing worth doing. No one comes to the reviews looking for opinions, you come for a movie analysis. Here it is: do not judge a movie by the cover.

5751553,4,B00CXN3W16,"It's hard rating bad movies that are entertaining to watch. Do you rate it low because its terrible or do you rate it high because you had fun watching it? Love on a Leash, in my opinion, has the potential to become a great bad movie. And like other reviewers, I thought the sound was broken at the start, but don't let that fool you. This is a test. A test to see if you have the GUTS to make it all the way through Or its my other theory, that they never received the licensing for the music and had to pull it all out. Its one or the other.

Without spoiling the movie, here's some selling points:
- Days turn into nights and back into days in a matter of seconds
- Dialog was written by an alien who took a course called How Humans Speak To Each Other 101, but dropped out after 2 days
- The dog is an a$$hole
- The movie completely disregards how time works
- There is a talking magic pool of water, who is also an a$$hole
- You will never know if the movie is a comedy, drama, science fiction or kids movie
- Her boss is a drunk rapist (I guess this rules out kids movie)
- GREEN!
- You will feel embarrassed for the dog (but don't, the dog probably had the most fun out of all the people involved in the film)
- The main characters mothers friend has a very interesting polish-chinese accent
- The main characters mothers friend storms into peoples homes in the middle of the night
- The main characters mothers friend is an a$$hole
- The ending will cause heated discussion (time travel? reverse aging? magic? black hole? schizophrenia? All valid and equally debatable)

Well, there you have it. If you have Prime you can watch it for the low low price of nothing. Personally, I bought a physical copy because I have a sneaky suspicion they won't make any more hard copies once they're out.

UPDATE - August 25, 2016:
After watching this movie on Prime, I purchased the DVD and wrote the review above. It sat on my shelf for awhile when one of my buddies wanted to watch a real stinker. I told him about this work of art and immediately he was sold. We tossed in the DVD and within seconds I noticed a huge discrepancy between the Prime and DVD versions. The intro... had music.

For those of you who have seen this clusterfudge on Prime will understand the significance of the intro now having music. Before my buddy could get a taste, I shot out of my chair and like Kurt Russell in Tombstone exclaimed, ""NO!"" I popped it out of my PS4, put it back in the DVD case and placed it back on my shelf. This was not the right time to experience something new. I apologized to my buddy for the inconvenience, wiped the sweat from my brow and prayed to the Lord Jesus Christ that the TRUE version of Love on a Leash was available to watch on Prime. I used to be an atheist, but God proved his existence when I saw it was there and still for the low low price of free.

I have yet to watch the DVD version, because I fear the consequences of seeing it with music. Will it destroy the original? Enhance it? Or will it become it's own special sort of hot mess that requires a completely different review? Who knows. But as of right now, there's only two left and I assure you, there won't be reprints. So buy it while it's steaming hot!",1460419200,24,3235,4.202898550724638

5751557,1,B00CXN3W16,I only gave one star as there was no spot for zero.  Dubbed in voices very annoying as well as some material.,1452902400,,109,3.9545454545454546
5751558,1,B00CXN3W16,"yuck 2x!! Dont let children watch this! SEX, etc.  warning!",1451001600,,59,4.9
5751559,1,B00CXN3W16,If I could I would give it zero star's. Very poorly made like a home video but even worse.,1449014400,3,90,3.789473684210526
5751560,5,B00CXN3W16,"This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen. That being said, I couldn't stop watching it. Not sure if they made a horrible movie on purpose but they nailed it!",1448409600,13,165,4.03030303030303
5751561,5,B00CXN3W16,Loved the movie,1447718400,2,15,4.333333333333333
5751562,1,B00CXN3W16,If I could give this less then one star I would.....the sound sucks ( didn't even kick in till about 1 minute into movie) ...the voice over sounds like someone just ad libbed the lines ....I could only handle it for about 5 minutes.  Cute premise but crappy editing and directing.,1446940800,,280,4.490196078431373
5751563,2,B00CXN3W16,Good story bad sound track dubbed without reverb or music. Pretty rough to watch! 15 mins was forever!,1442448000,,102,4.722222222222222
8587310,1,B00CXN3W16,I lasted three minutes the acting was awful and the dogs script and voice were idiotic!!!,1530835200,,89,4.625
8587311,1,B00CXN3W16,"I could not make it through the entire movie.  The acting is really bad, but not clever enough to make it the movie a satire.  It was a cute idea but executed horribly. I picked the movie based upon the reviews.  How the reviews could be that good I can only think that they were done by people either paid to write good reviews or related to the production.",1530662400,,358,4.159420289855072
8587312,5,B00CXN3W16,"I have watched through The Fault in Our Stars without shedding a single tear...this movie made me cry buckets. It is a truly beautiful love story of the century. I don't believe I ever knew the meaning of love until I invested 2 hours watching this very underrated movie.
P.S. Look for the motifs in the ducks...",1530403200,,312,4.491228070175438
8587313,5,B00CXN3W16,Anyone with a big brain will love this amazing film. It pushes the boundaries of what cinema could become. I will never look at movies the same.,1530144000,,144,4.37037037037037
8587314,3,B00CXN3W16,This was almost a good movie but too much drama and the end of the movie was stupid.,1530144000,,84,3.7222222222222223

8587316,1,B00CXN3W16,"One of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune of seeing. The absolute worst acting I've ever seen. The plot is ridiculous, and doesn't seem to move forward, and it looks like it was filmed on a cell phone.",1529107200,,212,4.325
8587317,1,B00CXN3W16,Don't know what to say. Watched the first 2 minutes. I really don't know what to say.,1529020800,,85,4.0588235294117645
8587318,1,B00CXN3W16,"Poor camera quality, bad acting, and jokes that just aren't funny. It's like watching a home movie while the camera man pretends that his voice is the dogs.....now imagine worse and you have wasted less time than if you would have watched this movie.",1528934400,,250,4.704545454545454
