5709566,4,B00CAT3T8Y,"If you are a fan of South Korean Cinema or even just a disaster film fan, ""The Tower"" is worth checking out. Since, for some reason, they are only releasing this film on dvd domestically, I will pass on this release and just order the South Korean blu-ray release (that does have English subtitles) just like I imported the South Korean blu-ray versions of ""A Werewolf Boy"", ""Deranged"", ""Helpless"", ""Bedevilled"" and ""Memories of Murder"". If you enjoyed ""Haeundae"", ""Sector 7"" and ""The Host"", then you will enjoy ""The Tower"". I wish some company would release the South Korean shocker ""Howling"" starring international superstar Song Kang Ho on blu-ray; in the U.S., Hong Kong or even native South Korea. For some reason, ""Howling"" is only available on blu-ray in Germany and with no English subtitles. :(",1372291200,,803,4.955555555555556
5709567,5,B00CAT3T8Y,"I wrote a review of this movie in conjunction with an imported all region DVD release, and I just want to say that if anyone thinks about buying this, you're in for a treat. I predict, that in the future, this will become a favorite seasonal movie, as the story takes place on Christmas Eve. Spectacular production values and effects, edge of your seat suspense, some funny moments and likable characters,all add up to give this disaster movie a cut above the rest. I saw this in a theatre back in December 2012, and I couldn't wait to tell everybody about it who, like myself, love a good disaster movie. So grab your invitation, take the elevator up to the top level in the beautiful Sky Tower, and, as Margo Channing said, ""Fasten your seatbelts-it's going to be a bumpy night !""",1370131200,11,782,4.514084507042254
5709568,5,B00CAT3T8Y,"From the trailer I am confident that this is a much long over due remake of the 1974, ""The Towering Inferno""...  I was 14 at the time and saw this movie several times.  I read both books from which the movie was based; ""The Tower"" and ""The Glass Inferno.""  Hollywood remakes movies and the countries of origin complain that the movies should not be remaid but released to American audiences as they were originally crafted...  Well Hollywood, I'm-a-thinking, that this remake will be far better than the original and I am so looking forward to seeing this movie...  ...can't we all just get along and enjoy the art of a well crafted movie...",1369612800,,641,4.6371681415929205
5709569,5,B00CAT3T8Y,"I was lucky to see this last December at a local cineplex, when I found out about it by mistake. (How many South Korean films are playing at your local cinema?) Being a disaster film junkie, I had to check this out - and boy, was it worth the effort! I had read that the director, Kim Ji-hoon, was inspired by Irwin Allen's 1974 TOWERING INFERNO, and that, as a middle school child, he wondered what it would be like to be trapped inside a blazing skyscraper. I believe Ji-hoon has made the film here, that Irwin Allen would have made, if he had access to the same technical resources back in the 1970's. All the elements are here - multiple characters, tremendous production values, incredible stunts and superb editing, all combine to place you as a guest, on Christmas Eve,in the beautiful Tower Sky - a steel and glass death trap, 120 stories above the bustling streets of Seoul, Korea! I CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS HIGHLY ENOUGH !",1369008000,13,929,4.535714285714286
5709570,5,B00CAT3T8Y,"This is a very compelling thriller, it's one of my favorite foreign films.  It has a lot of intense action combined with touching character driven moments, you might think this is just another tower disaster movie, but the execution is done very well and it really stands out from other movies that may be like it.  I first found this movie on Netflix a couple of years ago, and loved it, but after they took it off Netflix I had to buy the DVD.  Having it on disc is a lot better than when we watched it on Netflix, number one reason, it was in English!!  You get it in the original Korean and in English, we had to watch the Korean with subtitles the first few times and sometimes they went by so fast we only caught half the dialog, so it was nice to have the English, but at the same time it felt like something was missing.  You get some good special features like deleted scenes, and a behind the scenes feature.  I completely recommend this, especially to foreign film buffs and fans of quality disaster movies.",1458259200,,1018,4.331578947368421

5709572,5,B00CAT3T8Y,"I loved this movie!! It's very much like ""Towering Inferno,"" of course, but with a South Korean twist - and they definitely go the extra mile with the special effects in this movie! There was even a bit of SK politics involved, considering that the owner of the building is only concerned with saving the rich folks who live there, and couldn't care less about the staff or anyone who wasn't well-to-do - it was an interesting and informative side story. If you like disaster movies, then you will LOVE ""The Tower""!!",1455667200,,516,4.619565217391305

5709574,3,B00CAT3T8Y,"Movie is about 20 min too long, but still entertaining.  You don't really care about too many characters, but the special effects are the star here.  And  the plot is tight enough to keep you engaged.  It comes in Korean with English subtitles, but you can go to settings and change to English (dub).  It's been described as Die Hard meets the Towering Inferno, but it's really just a Korean Towering Inferno because there's no terrorism at all.  Just corporate big-wigs (clich...) who are greedy and don't care about safety.  Entertaining fire-fighting, though the final scene is a bit unbelievable that they could pull that off in 1 hour that normally takes weeks.",1435449600,,666,4.84070796460177

5709577,5,B00CAT3T8Y,"I have to agree with the other reviews that this move is excellent. I love disaster movies and foreign films. I doubt American audiences would be ready for a similar feature released here. I saw The Towering Inferno some time ago and there are some recognizable similarities. There are also similarities to the 9/11 disaster which may be intense for some, but I feel that it was well done.
Some are saying that the beginning is too long...it takes a half hour to introduce the ensemble cast of characters that typically make up disaster movies. I disagree that it's too long. We really have a chance to know who is involved. I have seen some movies that rush into the action without thorough introductions.
I do find that the beginning of the movie is very comedic, the switch into disaster mode is a change, even though some of the comedy continues through the film.
The good thing is that there are no overy graphic scenes, at least not for my taste.",1421625600,,952,4.573099415204679
5709578,1,B00CAT3T8Y,"I'm sure it would have been a great movie.  I viewed 7 minutes of ""Tower"" on Sunday (Dec 21)  due to the Sub-Titles (that were not advised of in the synopsis).  I e-mailed Amazon Customer Service to humbly ask for a $3.99 credit towards another streaming movie.  It is currently 13:52 hours, Wednesday 23.  I have experienced only quality service from Amazon, so I expect due to the Holiday, I will receive a reply possibly Friday.  I would like to view ""Tower"", but Sub-Titles were at a rapid rate.  It appeared to be a high budget ""Towering Inferno"" of the 2000's.",1419292800,,566,4.544554455445544

5709582,4,B00CAT3T8Y,"It's awesome now and then to step outside Hollywood and sample international cinema. Me, I'd been checking out South Korea's film portfolio and there are some seriously watchable stuff there. If westerners were wondering, yeah, son, the rest of the world is catching up fast with Hollywood's technical prowess. THE TOWER (original title: ""Ta-weo"") is a 2012 South Korean disaster film. It made serious bank in the Korean box office on the strength of its emotional beats and fine performances and its spectacular visual effects. C'mon, son, don't be scurred. Dip your toe in, get your foreign culture on.

It's Christmas Eve in Seoul, and if the city's movers and shakers had a say in it, it'll be one to remember in the holiday gala held annually in Tower Sky, the luxurious, 108-storied residential twin skyscrapers. Tower Sky is home to Seoul's most elite tenants (and the occasional Lottery winner). I could stagger you with specs about Sky Tower, how it houses 5700 residents in 1700 units, that the twin high-rises - called River View and City View - are linked by a bridge of glass at the 70th floor... but the truth of it is that all these fun facts soon won't mean bo diddly.

One enduring trope of disaster cinema is the soap opera bubble what floats within the chaos. Director Kim Ji Hoon observes that trope by rolling out stock characters that, fortunately, are breathed life by a fine, dedicated cast. In quick order we meet Lee Dae-ho (Kim Sang-kyung), head of Maintenance & Operation at the hotel and, also, single dad to a cute little girl. Dae-ho is making flirty overtures towards restaurant manager Miss Seo Yoon-hee (Son Ye-jin), but he's the shy, fumbly sort. Thank goodness for the life-threatening calamity. It tends to bring things to a head, including romantic intent.

Another major player is veteran firefighter Captain Kang Young-ki (Sol Kyung-gu), he whose shift ends in time for him to go home and usher in Christmas with his neglected wife. Yeah, sorry, date night's not gonna happen.

It's a sweeping cast. The rookie firefighter reporting for duty and getting hazed. The elderly cleaning woman desperate to pay her son's college tuition fee. The clownish cook seeking opportunity to propose to his lady love. The salt-of-the-earth guy who lucked into money and so lands a suite in Sky Tower. The posh neighbor who immediately tries to put him in his place as she goes looking for her runaway dog.

There are three jerkfaces in the story who fuel my anti-rooting interest, and I'll point out one. He's the ambitious building owner who barters basic safety for putting on a good holiday show for his upscale tenants and VIP guests. Earlier in the day, when Dae-ho brings to his attention a huge flaw with the sprinkler system, he's scolded and ordered to harness all resources in service of the night's festivities. Luckily this blatant disregard doesn't bite the owner in the a-HA HA HA! Man, it totally bites him in the ass. Oh, hubris, the downfall of us all.

THE TOWER isn't Korea's only stab at disaster cinema, obviously. I recommend 2013's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flu/dp/B00H4IR3JC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flu</a>&nbsp;(original title: ""Gamgi"") and even 2009's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tidal-Wave/dp/B00393SG1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tidal Wave</a>&nbsp;(original title: ""Haeundae""), even though it's not as well done. But back to THE TOWER, and how the VFX and editing crews did such a bang-up job of making scenes look authentic enough that you couldn't tell where reality stopped and CGI took over. Consider that out of the film's 3000 shots, 1700 were CGI rendered. People put in work, son! So many harrowing moments, and they're all given that stamp of reality. The film doesn't stint on action. My favorite sequence is probably the one where survivors must jump from a disintegrating room and down onto a shaky suspension platform outside the building, but then the support cables start giving way. Or maybe I like the elevator scene best? Or is it the fireman running along the wall and shattering the glass windows so as to allow an alternate pathway for the rampaging fire?

Director Kim Ji Hoon hasn't been shy about citing his inspiration as from producer Irwin Allen's 1974 opus&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Towering-Inferno-Special-Edition/dp/B000EHSVOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Towering Inferno (Special Edition)</a>. Or that he was deeply affected by the bravery of the firefighters when 9/ll went down. THE TOWER borrows bits from THE TOWERING INFERNO - ie: the hotel expert and the firefighter cooperating; the application of the reserve water tank. More tellingly, it's an homage to the firefighter. Hell, maybe it's an homage to hotel managers, too, because Dae-ho proves to be nearly as badass and courageous as Captain Kang. As in other disaster flicks, THE TOWER demonstrates that ordinary folks like you and me can become heroes. And flaws? Okay, the one thing that nagged at me is how many friggin' times can Dae-ho and his little kid have a weepy reunion? Never mind. See this movie.

The DVD's bonus stuff (with English sub-titles):

- Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:12:12 minutes)
- Making Of THE TOWER C.G. - focuses on the CGI process and use of miniature (00:11:02 minutes)
- Behind the Scene Takes (00:10:03 minutes)",1408492800,2,5448,5.303592120509849

5709585,4,B00CAT3T8Y,"I don't usually watch subtitled movies as I find them distracting. However, this movie I did watch as it caught my interest. It is the Towering Inferno on steroids.

5709587,3,B00CAT3T8Y,Familiar story line.  If you watched Korean movies before there is always a similar story link around cheap korean construction and something like a structure collapsing and the collateral damage it has on people's lives.,1395878400,,221,5.314285714285714
5709588,5,B00CAT3T8Y,"I was in high school when the Towering Inferno hit the big screens and it was awesome for its time.  However the Tower is not just another Towering Inferno want-to-be.  The Tower is its own movie like it or not, The Tower is a departure from the Irwin Allen classic.  The Tower has a different feel, a different sequence of events and the characters are extremely well developed.

Yes you will need to read english subtitles and they can go by extremely fast at times but that said The Tower is worth the effort.  The special effects are better than those in the Towering Inferno due to all the computer generated stuff that did not exist when Towering Inferno was made.  The fire scenes are realistic.  The firemen were painted as a very human caring bunch of guys who had each others backs.

The Tower had more than a few moments where it ripped tears out of me because; I loved the people and cared about their fate.  I tend to like Asian films and this is the best Korean film I have ever seen bar none.  I enjoyed The Tower in more ways than words can describe.  I want so bad to include spoilers that share highlights of the DVD with you but I am fighting the urge to.  The Tower is such a great movie that if I shared any part of it with you, it would truly spoil the movie.  The greatest joy I had was I knew nothing about the Tower before I saw it.  Everything was brand new as the story unfolded before me.  The Tower earned my five star rating and I would have given it a ten star rating if it were possible.  Yes The Tower is that good.

Oh ok one spoiler... I just had too and it is not a major plot point just something funny.  Every disaster movie has one funny scene in the midst of all the chaos and The Tower does not disappoint.  The building has caught fire.  People running everywhere and all heck has broken loose.  Of course there are those dumb people who insist on using the elevators during a fire emergency and you just KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO BE TOAST LITERALLY!  Unlike the Towering Inferno elevator load of crispy critters the Tower does it in a more subtle way.  The dumb people herd into the elevator, the doors close and the elevator makes its descent. Of course the elevator goes directly to the closed circuit on the fire floors no surprise.  Instead of the doors opening the people are killed first by indirect heat not open flames. The Tower lets you know death is coming first by indirect heat is first in the dialogue as a lady asks, ""Whats that smell!?""  Then the cemera gives a close up of a man lifting his shoe from a floor made so hot by fire that his shoes rubber plastic soles have melted into a sticky goo.  Shortly thereafter the elevator is bathed in heat then flames as the elevator and its unlucky inhabitants finally fall to their doom.

When will people learn, ""WHEN THERE IS A FIRE YOU NEVER USE ELEVATORS SINCE ON AUTOMATIC MODE THEY WILL LIKELY STOP AT THE FIRE FLOOR!""  So you see, signs saying in case of emergency DO NOT USE ELEVATORS use marked exit stairways instead exist for good safety related reasons. Also fire, heat and smoke are a deadly trio that together travel up elevator shafts as if they were giant chimneys roasting everything in their path. The best thing about movies like The Towering Inferno and The Tower is that it shows realistically and in graphic detail what happens when elevators are used during fire events. So hey watching The Tower is a good lesson in elevator related fire safety,",1395532800,2,3469,4.3697347893915754
5709589,5,B00CAT3T8Y,"This movie is absolutely one of the first tower of terror type films I've watched & not hated. This movie is a great blend of horror, drama, & suspense. I highly recommend this movie.",1395187200,,183,4.411764705882353
5709590,4,B00CAT3T8Y,"Ta-Weo (The Tower) (Ji-hoon Kim, 2012)

Of all the films I watched on the day I'm writing these reviews, which is four and a half, the clear, and quite surprising, winner was The Tower, the newest blockbuster from Ji-hoon Kim, whose Sector 7 I found really kind of underwhelming when I watched it six months ago. As it is easy to discern from the poster, The Tower is something of an homage to (it is not nearly close enough to be considered a remake) the classic 1974 disaster film The Towering Inferno, and so I turned it on hoping for a bit of mindless fluff to bleach my brain after the horrors that were The Shock Labyrinth and Zombie Hunter. And on one level that is exactly what I got, the sort of schadenfreude that is just oodles of fun to watch unfold on the screen. But Kim and co-writer Sang-don Kim (Once Upon a Time in Seoul) have a few tricks up their sleeves that turn this from a mindless, fun disaster film into something quite special.

Dae-ho (Memories of Murder's [...]) is one of the safety officers at a spiffy new high-rise in Seoul. Very high-profile, very untested, and as we get through the first half-hour of the movie, we find out there are more problems than initially suspected. But, of course, it's Christmas Eve, and there's a gala party planned on the 54th floor. One character even says, when Young-ki cautions that because of some problems with the sprinkler system they should install more fire extinguishers, why are you worried about fire extinguishers? You should be worried about party planning! Yes, folks, they might as well have called this building the Titanic, and sure enough, strong winds combined with building height cause problems with some helicopters they've hired for publicity purposes, one of them collides with the tower, and suddenly there are thousands of people either trapped or fleeing for their lives, including Dae-ho's daughter Ha-na ([...] in her first screen appearance) and Yoon-hee (Open City's [...]), whom Dae-ho is not-so-secretly in love with, and with whom Ha-na is trying to set him up. This story runs parallel to that of the brigade of firefighters called in to rescue the people trapped on the 54th floor (who include Ha-na and Yoon-he, along with a number of minor dignitaries and other such folks).

What really makes this movie work, better than the disaster movies of the seventies and, for that matter, better than any other disaster movie I've ever seen, is how well the romance, and subsequent thriller, subplot is written; it is easy to come to care for these three characters, and that makes the second half of the film so much more than a simple disaster picture. Sure, on every other level it's the same old thing you've seen dozens of times, though Kim recognizes, and plays on, the inherent comedy in the situation in a way that no seventies disaster movie did, at least not intentionally. The setup is a bit slow, but that's a minor stumbling block. One helluva good time, well worth seeking out. *** ",1394064000,,2993,4.727969348659004

5709592,5,B00CAT3T8Y,"It was cliched, it was corny, it was an idea we had seen before, it was Korean, AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT!  I have yet to see a single film from South Korea I have not enjoyed, and this one is now proudly added to that roster.
If you have seen ""The Towering Inferno"" then you know the basic plot of this movie.  It is Xmas Eve in Seoul, South Korea and the most luxurious residential/commercial towers in the city is throwing an unforgettable Christmas bash.  However due to incompetent construction, corrupt politicians, and misplaced priorities the party will quickly become a nightmare when two of the helicopters hired to drop synthesized snow onto the party crash into one another and then into the building itself.  People die - usually very dramatically - and like most of the classic American disaster flicks of the 70s and 80s it is normally the unnamed or cowardly characters.
That being said this is not just another clone of the old disaster films of our youth.  This film combines elements from ""Backdraft"", ""Die Hard"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""The Towering Inferno"" but actually does it well.  Just like Americans you get a real since that South Korean culture views firemen as superheroes (personal note - they are), and the scene at the climax between the Captain and the rookie firefighter WILL make you cry.
This is a great introduction to anyone curious about Korean cinema, especially those who are not sure about titles like ""Oldboy"" or ""I Saw the Devil"".  It is generally family friendly and generally gore and violence free.  I had a blast and think you will too.",1390780800,,1594,4.7086330935251794
5709593,3,B00CAT3T8Y,"I enjoyed this movie. Lots of action. But it does take way too long to get to the action. Also the action is not realistic. It's very over the top and there are too many silly moments that ruin it. The thing I hated the most though is how one man kicked a dog. And it was shown to be a good thing. The guy was not a bad guy. The dog's owner sucked, but the dog never did anything horrible. No barking or grabbing at people. So my main complaint is the small moment where the guy kicks a dog for no reason and nobody thinks there is anything wrong with this. Other than that it was a decent watch and could have been better if they didn't go over the top with it.",1388707200,,662,3.911111111111111

5709595,3,B00CAT3T8Y,"I am glad I watched this movie off Netflix.  This movie does have some cool special effects but overall the story sucks.  Furthermore,  I hate to point out the water pressure in the drain pipe could have easily killed all the survivors from a hydraulic stand point.  The length of the pipe, the speed of the flow, and the difference in elevation would have do them all in.  Old Boy is a much better movie than this The Towering Inferno wannabe.",1387756800,,444,4.432098765432099
5709596,4,B00CAT3T8Y,"Back in the 1970's every other film was a disaster movie and in many respects most were truly disastrous ('Piranha 2', `Jaws 3', and `Earthquake' to name a few) and then there were some good ones and `The Towering Inferno' was one of them that could survive more than one viewing as well as `The Poseidon Adventure'. This then is Koreas take on the classic tower on fire scenario.

We get all the scene setting, the single dad with the crush on new girlfriend, the devoted mum with ungrateful son, the working class lottery winner and selfish VIPs. Then we get to meet the fire crew led by a tough veteran and his loyal crew and the rookie that has only joined the team that day. Add to the mix a corner cutting building firm and make it all happen on Christmas Eve and you have the potential for one helluva movie. And yes it works there is sentimentality by the bucket load, excellent CGI, over acting a Pantomime Dame would kill for and unashamed attempts to get you to blub - I ruddy loved it.

This is not high brow, but it is packed with action, thrills, misery and heart rending stories that all go to make an excellent disaster film. And at 117 minute just flies by with more cliff hangers than a cliff hanger convention - probably. If you want to just be carried along by a plot then you could do a lot worse than this; in Korean with rather good sub titles and it's got two towers not just one like the original so double the fun.",1387584000,,1440,4.290441176470588
5709597,3,B00CAT3T8Y,"I can only recall ever seeing one 'disaster' movie. The genre just never appealed to me. After seeing this it seems I'd made the right decision in my life.

Here's the scoop. A luxury two tower high-rise is having a big shindig on Christmas Eve. Two of a small fleet of helicopters hired to spruce things up with snow machines crash the building and all hell breaks loose ans the inhabitants try to make it to safety.

This begins well enough. You're introduced to various people and circumstances you know will come into play. Some are sympathetic while others are not so. Then the two helicopters crash, the fire starts in the one tower and the movie spirals downward quickly. This is creepy at one level because it mirrors the twin towers of 911. The one tower is ""pulled"" and it looks wat too much like what Americans saw on the news as it comes down. They even show the dust engulfing the streets and a shot from across a body of water as only the one tower remains standing. This was uncomfortable to watch.

But then there is the idiocy of it all. This contains elements so stupid it boggles the mind. How about sprinkler system pipes that run through the outer walls and freeze in the cold months rendering them useless. And titanium firewall that impede the rescue attempts? Why do you need titanium anything in a high rise? I guess there are no building codes in South Korea. And the guys that are sent to set the explosives the ""pull"" the building pretty much just set the charges here there and everywhere. Guess all the time we spend in in this country just to pull old, decrepit buildings is all a ruse.

An odd element is that Christianity is at the root of much of what happens here. And it is at the center of some of the yuks in the movie. I really didn't know what to make of it.

The directing, editing, effects and music are all uneven but mostly bad. Koren movies have been amongst the best I've ever seen. Particularly their crime thrillers. It hurts to see them bungle it in such huge fashion here. Stay away.",1387324800,,2033,4.425133689839572
5709598,4,B00CAT3T8Y,The movie kept you wondering from start to finish who will stay alive. Awesome filming. Made you want to see the heros come out on top.,1386201600,,135,4.230769230769231
5709599,4,B00CAT3T8Y,"In scattershot fashion, a lot of characters are briefly introduced.  They're not around long enough though, to register as anything more than some stray individuals occupying space.  The space involved is a towering skyscraper dubbed Tower Sky.  The creepy side to this is that they are actually twin towers (connected with a skybridge), even though the cover of the DVD deceptively displays just the one tower.  No, this is not a movie about terrorists, the ""accident"" used in the story has to do with a helicopter crashing into one of the towers.  Even so, the similarities can't be avoided.  (I don't know why they thought they needed to use two towers for their story when one would have done the job just fine.)  At any rate, the destruction aspect of this movie is incredible, with fantastic special effects.  But you can see where they ""borrowed"" story elements from many other films.  It's the level of acting though, that keeps this from being truly exceptional.  Some of the characters are outlandish cartoons, flailing about like maniacs, lost to slapstick antics that feel decidedly out of place in what should be a serious disaster flick.  Then there are members of the cast so somber and grave you wonder if they took a left turn past Shakespeare only to end up alongside a few Stooges too many.

Ultimately, there are some fine moments (some heartrending), but only after a slow start.  As long as you can cringe your way past the many silly bits, you might find it worth a glance or two.  I'm keeping it for future viewings because the disaster part of it was brilliant.",1386201600,,1586,4.740875912408759

5709602,1,B00CAT3T8Y,However amazing the special effects the script must have the characters taking the situation seriously. Too many 'humorous' moments. They were distracting and cheapened the movie.,1381708800,,179,5.923076923076923
5709603,3,B00CAT3T8Y,"Pretty low brow remake of the US 70s disaster movie The Towering Inferno. It has some pretty spectacular special effects and action sequences. Unfortunately, like most of these Korean movies, the insistance on inserting inane comedy sketches ruins it.

Take a look at another Korean disaster movie that was released a couple years back ""Tidal Wave"". Awesome effects, atrocious comedic situations, while millions die!!

If you like to see excellent special effects of destruction, and people killed in brutal fashion, The Tower & Tidal Wave deliver. If you're looking for character development that makes the deaths of so many more emotional, go with classics like The Towering Inferno, The Poseidon Adventure and Earthquake.",1381104000,,724,5.398230088495575
5709604,4,B00CAT3T8Y,"This film appears to have the budget of a big Hollywood movie and some incredible stunts. I found it quite entertaining once the fire started and things started blowing up. It's a nice little adventure yarn about how people do and don't get out of a burning office tower with no reachable exits. The one thing that i didn't like was the overacting by the comic relief characters, including a bus boy who is trying to ask his girl friend to marry him amid all the destruction. His is a cringe worthy performance.",1378857600,6,511,4.505376344086022
5709605,3,B00CAT3T8Y,"Some film genre never dies. A 2012 Korean movie ""The Tower"" (""Ta-weo"") is a good example that proves the popularity of the genre of so-called disaster film. Directed by Ji-hoon Kim (""Sector 7""), the film follows the genre's template, with a collection of narrative threads and effect-ridden action sequences.

The story goes like this. On Christmas Eve a terrible accident happens at a 108-story Seoul residential high rise The Tower Sky. Occupants and staff trapped inside the building struggle to survive. Fire fighters attempt to rescue them. Characters, mostly likable ones, are played by an impressive ensemble cast, including Kyung-gu Sol, Ye-jin Son, Sang-kyung Kim and a veteran star Sung-kee Ahn.

This is more like a remake of ""The Towering Inferno"" made in 1974, with some of the memorable scenes from the disaster film classic updated for the modern audiences. The ""Tower Sky"" is a twin building that has a skybridge (like Petronas Towers in Malaysia). Those who have seen ""The Towering Inferno"" remember the breeches buoy scene, but here the same idea is used differently.

And of course, there are an elevator shaft and huge water tanks, too. The film's concept is far from original, but with the special effects that are surprisingly effective, ""The Tower"" is a pretty entertaining two-hour ride.",1377993600,8,1311,5.145539906103286
5709606,3,B00CAT3T8Y,"I didn't know it was in Japanese with English subtitles.  It made for a good laugh though and it was one of those ""Good Guys Win"" movies that made it worth it.",1376956800,,159,3.96875
5709607,5,B00CAT3T8Y,"This was a fantastic film.  I enjoy a good suspenseful movie that doesn't have needless violence and language. The filmmaker did a good job meeting those requirements.

5709608,5,B00CAT3T8Y,"About 40 years ago we were thrilled and amazed by what was considered the granddaddy of disaster movies, Irwin Allen's ""Towering Inferno"". Now the torch has been passed. (No pun intended.) ""The Tower"", a 2012 film from Korea, surpasses its predecessor in action, nail-biting suspense, human interest storylines, and special effects. Granted, back in 1974 there was little, if any, CGI to add to the spectacle. And by no means am I belittling Irwin Allen's masterpiece. But I was so enthralled by ""The Tower"" in so many ways, I must say it is, by far, the better film. Of course there are many similarities in both storylines. Though I do prefer ""The Tower"" version of how the fire starts. And I seemed to care more about the characters too. Maybe that's because I wasn't familiar with any of the actors in ""The Tower"", and I was able to relate to them as real people.  Unlike ""Inferno"" which was chock full of superstars. I wasn't watching a firefighter and architect, I was watching Steve McQueen and Paul Newman. There are more heart-stopping thrills in ""The Tower"" too. One involving a suspended scaffold, and another involving a glass connecting bridge. I did find a scene toward the end to be a little disturbing because it replicated visions from 9/11 a little too closely. ""The Tower"" is a movie I can't watch very often. Not because it isn't good, but because my nerves and emotions couldn't take it. This is one remarkable film. As for the dvd itself, the visuals are stunning with the 235:1 scope. And the surround sound is nothing short of superb. The disc offers both subtitled and dubbed versions. It offers some deleted scenes which really aren't missed in the final cut. It has a 'making of' short with the director and effects artists. (I tend to not watch such additions to maintain the magic of the film.) There is also a 'behind the scenes' feature with comments from some of the cast members.",1374105600,,1912,4.7074626865671645

THIS IS IN ENGLISH OR KOREAN. I WOULD REALLY TELL ANYONE IT IS WELL WORTH GETTING. IF YOU LOVE DISASTER MOVIES, THIS IS A MUST HAVE!! YES THERE ARE SCENES THAT REALLY REMINDED ME OF 911.
YOU WONT BE SORRY IF YOU GET THIS. THERE ARE VERY EMOTIONAL SCENES HERE.",1373673600,,437,4.093023255813954
5709610,5,B00CAT3T8Y,"I didn't rush to buy this but I have a fondness for Korean films so I finally got around to it. Wow! It was great.

Remember Towering Inferno? That was an overdone melodramatic film with cookie cutter characters. This was not at all like that. The first 32 minutes of the movie developed the characters and did so wonderfully. They were deep and believable (thought a few were a bit over the top). You really got a feel for them and maybe hated a couple, hoping they would go first.

What I found surprising was that the film-makers managed to keep several sub-plots going as well as injecting humor when you don't expect it. There would be a heart wrenching tragic event one moment and a belly laugh the next.

There was action, romance, tragedy, suspense, humor and great special effects.

Some aspects were taken from the twin towers on 9/11 (these were also twin towers) and that bothered me a little but didn't really detract from the film.

I highly recommend.",1373587200,,966,4.593023255813954

with this one, that there is no big american stars in it ...its mostly Korean.
The dubbing is good enough to enjoy.
They do like to make you feel happy and add a bit of comedy before the disaster.
The movie has more people and a bigger budget than the towering Inferno, so you
get more but bottom line its almost the same movie...and some of the stuff used
in the end was used by the Allen movie.

5709615,5,B00CAT3T8Y,"Completely by accident, I recently ran across - online, where else? - that last year a Korean version of 'The Towering Inferno' was a big hit in theaters.  I freaked out; 'The Poseidon Adventure' and 'The Towering Inferno' are two of my favorites since childhood, I own the Special Edition DVDs and could watch either one (especially 'Poseidon') over and over again.  Determined to see THE TOWER, I finally tracked down a copy.  Not the best subtitles (and that's an understatement), but really focusing (and backing the film up a few times) they were do-able ... and good GOD, did I love this film!

Tower Sky is a set of twin luxury highrise towers right in the heart of the big city (I'm assuming Seoul), connected by a bridge about halfway up.  It's Christmas Eve, and a swanky, huge White Party has been planned for the rich residents and various VIPs in the city ... and managing it all is Dae-ho, a single dad who wanted to spend Christmas Eve with his daughter Hana but has to cancel to watch over the events of the evening.  Yoon-hee, the beautiful manager of the food mall for the towers (and the woman Dae-ho has a crush on) agrees to keep an eye on Hana that evening, as her staff rushes around preparing top-quality food for the guests, and the festivities include several helicopters that fly around the building with huge snow-making machines so that the ritzy guests can experience a white Christmas.  When a horrible accident (I don't want to say what happens, I wasn't expecting it and it made my jaw drop) occurs, starting a raging fire in one of the towers, Dae-ho fights to get to Hana and Yoon-hee, as well as perform his job by trying to save those caught, like him, above the fire-laden floors.

The film takes a good half-hour just to set up the characters and story (much like another favorite of mine, 'Tidal Wave') - and from a handful of firefighters to those caught in the building, you really, REALLY care about these characters and want them to escape with their lives.  In no way a rip-off of 'The Towering Inferno' scene by scene, 'The Tower' has some great visual effects and drama, along with a few ""Holy Crap!"" surprises along the way to keep the tension tighter than Dolly Parton's bra.  Not to make light with that comment; the movie is AWESOME, and it comes out on DVD in the States on July 9th so I fully plan to get it asap and watch it again right away, with professional subtitles to make sure I didn't miss anything.  Exciting, action-filled, dramatic, and even with just the right comedic touches along the way, this one also goes to toward the top of my favorite films I've seen so far this year.

But it is very well done and never panders. Even though it is full of explosions and excitement, this movie is about the characters as all good Korean movies are. Sol Kyung-gu (Peppermant Candy, Oasis) is stellar as the brave yet world weary fire captain and Kim In-kwon stands out as the self important yet bumbling member of his crew. Everyone is good in this one and, even though the cast is large, you never get lost or confused as to who is who, even amidst all of the action and excitement. I will be watching this one over and over again.",1462924800,2,827,4.411764705882353
