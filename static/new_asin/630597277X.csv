7898611,5,630597277X,"I'd watch any film with Lili Taylor in a prominent role where she plays at least a semi-appealing character. Fortunately, she does so in this movie where she plays Ann, a bright young woman who goes on an emotional bender after being unceremoniously dumped by her boyfriend.

Fortunately, she connects with Don, played by Andrew McCarthy, who one of the other reviewers aptly describes as a rather sad and lonely man, who volunteers at a suicide hotline in order to get better insight into his own depression.

The movie doesn't have a lot of high drama or excitement in it and only the occasional laugh but somehow I kept on watching it to the end because I wanted to see if Ann and Don would wind up together or not ...

<spoilers>

Fortunately, they do, and I have to give the movie some serious kudos for making me think almost until the very end, this film, which is an Indie art-house flick to its very bones, would have a predictably sad ending.  I read Lili Taylor says this is her favorite film of her career, and it's not hard to see why.

For those who like Lili Taylor, I'd recommend the following films:

7898612,3,630597277X,"Writer/Director Isabel Coixet likes taking a big idea and applying it to a small canvas.  In My Life Without Me she succeeded splendidly.  The idea - (What would you do if you had only a few weeks left to live?) - is played out with almost Shaker-esque austerity in the lives of modest people who live glamourlessly in trailer parks and laundromats.  Things I Never Told You is stylistically similar - short vignettes of ordinary people bumbling through ordinary lives - but the big idea is less focused and consequently the film is more diffuse.  In essence it is - love is not - as we are taught - something that occurs with the aid of reason or logic, much less inevitability - but rather - an odd sequence of accidents that simply do not mesh because they are like ""pieces from different jig-saw puzzles.""  Everyone in this film wants to connect, and everyone misses the mark in one way or another.

Even art-house habitus understand that melancholic, poignant, almost plotless character studies such as these depend entirely on how one feels about the characters.  Fortunately the protagonist, Ann, is played exceptionally well by Lili Taylor.  No mean feat.  Ann is bright, self-absorbed, borderline suicidal, and trying to make sense of an affair that has ended abruptly.  Through an odd coincidence, the sort that haunts movies of this type, she meets Don - also drifting and unlucky in love.  Andrew McCarthy assumes the part of Don with total conviction, we see him forced through difficult transitions and he's always believable.  One of the reasons this movie succeeds is that we like these two, and hope that things work out for them - even though the basic premise of the movie is that such things never do.

Minor characters must reflect the themes challenging major characters, and they do here, with some very entertaining twists.  Debi Mazar very nearly steals every scene she's in as Diane, Seymour Cassell as Don's father speaks for all the film's characters when he openly asks for love and affection (in all the wrong places), and Alexis Arquette as Paul, vividly embodies longing for what one sees rather than for what is.

This idea of loving a projection of one's mind rather than the real deal is illustrated well in various ways.  Ann's coworker, played by the exquisite Leslie Mann, tells Ann that her boyfriend thinks she looks like Audrey Hepburn.  She intends to hold onto this boyfriend because he is the only one she's ever had who knows the difference between Audrey Hepburn and Katherine Hepburn.  Likewise, when the man who dumped Ann returns from Prague, he and Don, (recovering from being dumped by Ann who has now disappeared), discuss her at length.  Don ultimately feels pity for the man, concluding that he didn't really know her at all.  Coixet teases this idea of love's uncertainty like a loose tooth, and it's always quirky enough to be charming and authentic enough to sting a bit.

Perhaps not so fully formed and disciplined as My Life Without Me, but still, a lovely small painting of decent people who are only too familiar.",1198713600,,3075,4.807984790874524
7898613,4,630597277X,"With its offbeat take on relationships and preoccupation with videotape, this movie is something like what Atom Egoyan might have come up with if assigned to do a screwball comedy. It was actually made by Spanish director Isabel Coixet, but the setting is somewhere in North America. (It was filmed in northwest Oregon and in Spain.) The story involves an oddball group of people whose paths tend to cross in interesting and sometimes romantic ways. In the lead role, Lili Taylor (I Shot Andy Warhol, Girls Town) tones down her usual psychotic screen persona to being merely odd and quirky and actually endearing.",981504000,6,613,4.961165048543689
