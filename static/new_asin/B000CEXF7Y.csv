8104547,5,B000CEXF7Y,I use this DVD to teach and Ethics Class in a small college.  It generates great thought and conversation surrounding sexuality and ethics.  It's very entertaining and is very diverse.  It easily challenges stereotypes and assumptions in regards to marriage and intimacy.,1476662400,,271,5.404761904761905
8104548,5,B000CEXF7Y,"This movie examines the many the different possibilities we have today
when it comes to how we format our relationships. Interviews are taken
from people of varying types of relationship statuses as well as
varying ages. Some interviews seem to be with professionals and
researchers as well as average working class people. Whether or not
these are actual interviews or convincing actors is irrelevant. The
message it delivers is of the very essence of our American roots(I'm
making the assumption that you love freedom or more precisely liberty).

Love and Cheating is a realistic review of the many options open to
free adults within our borders. The timing and content of these
opinionated interviews does make the non monogamous lifestyle seem very
acceptable but it's that very broadening of the mind that I like about
this movie. It addresses possible reasons for monogamy and non monogamy
while giving both a sense of equal significance to the interviewee or
as the movie intends, you, the people of the audience.",1286582400,,1020,5.071428571428571
8104549,5,B000CEXF7Y,"This documentary is such an excellent resource.  All of my social sciences students really enjoyed the film.  They were also really impressed with the information that it presented--a very new perspective to sexual pre-dispositions in our society.  I use this film each semester.  Highly recommend it!!!  Very informative and entertaining.  The humor is not lost on the viewers.  I wish that everyone was required to watch this film at least once in their lives.  Maybe a better understanding of our human sexuality broad variance would relieve the ignorance that puts such unnecessary stressors into our relationships. My bet is that when you view this film you will say what all of my students say, ""Wow!!!  I had no idea.""",1231372800,2,725,5.025210084033613
