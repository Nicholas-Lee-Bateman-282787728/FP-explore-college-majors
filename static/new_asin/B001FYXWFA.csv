8303250,3,B001FYXWFA,"""Dolce calda Lisa"" (""Sweet Hot Lisa"") was an erotic film from 1980 by Adriano Tagliavia (under the pseudonym: Adriano Cesari). It featured a very sexy Claudia Rocchi as 'Lisa' a young housewife who gets bored with her dull and unexciting life, and begins to have some wild sexual-encounters. That about sums it up! This was your basic 70's/80's softcore (except for some hardcore scenes that were not inserts, involving Guia Lauri Filzi, Annj Goren and Maruska Ferretti. I will admit; the scenes between Annj Goren and Guia Lauri were pretty hot. I love the hairstyles of the women in the 70's: 'figa pelosa'). Some of our older and more avid fans will remember Guia Lauri Filzi, she was in dozens of erotic films (both softcore/hardcore), between the 70's and 80's. Sorry, I got a little too nostalgic! Anyway, Claudia Rocchi (she had a very lovely figure), retired from films after this one (she only appeared in 2, both in 1980), che peccato! Recommended for collectors and enthusiasts of nostalgic fare like this one. The DVD picture quality was excellent, the film has been completely restored and it really ran for 84 mins. PAL, Italian (no English subtitles), NR 84 mins. Grazie e buon divertimento.

Love and Peace,
