2755435,5,B000N3SU6K,It was such a joy to watch this funny teenage caper.  All of the acting done by these young actors is wonderfully rich.  The story line is completely engaging and you can't help but wonder how things will turn out for the young hero at each plot twist.  Well done!  Perfect for teens.,1182124800,5,284,4.30188679245283
2755436,5,B000N3SU6K,"The movie is a must-see for anyone who has ever been in high school and remembers those student council races. It's a film that makes you laugh from beginning to end, with the stereotypical, mean high school principal, unsuspecting teachers, and of course, your ""group"" of unforgettable friends. The film is clean and good for the whole family. The added bonus is great footage of the Island of Puerto Rico and a catchy musical score. I bought 10 copies for family and friends!",1181520000,26,477,4.759036144578313
2755437,5,B000N3SU6K,"Casi casi is a small budget movie that belongs to a very interesting and often unexplored movie genre: Latin-American teen flicks. But don`t be fool by the small budget or the teen flick parts. Although Casi casi was made by two first time directors, eight first time film actors in leading roles, and with only one digital camera, Casi casi comes through as a truly enjoyable film for young an old alike.

I recommend this movie mainly because it is a very well written story, something that unfortunately is seldom seen in Puerto Rican films. The narrative flows very naturally and very efficiently. The story captures the audience in its very first 15 minutes, making them totally forget that they are watching a digitally shot movie. Another important aspect of the story is that it departs considerably from the socio-political themes that heavily predominate in Puerto Rican cinema. Casi casi breaks new ground by being the first Puerto Rican movie in recent years to totally dismiss this in order to concentrate on an often forgotten demographic in the Puerto Rican entertainment business; 8 to 11 year olds, and preteens. It is, in essence, a very good family movie with a bit of adventure, a bit of action, a bit of comedy, a bit of romance, and lots of heart.

Although its sets and photographic value are generally average (the behind the scenes demonstrates why), the postproduction immediately raises eyebrows for its high quality. Casi casi is very probably the first Puerto Rican movie in a long long time to have its own classical score. Written by Peter Mills and performed by the New York repertory orchestra, the classical score fills many voids in the movie, making it the most notable part of the movie. I can say that without this score this would have been an immensely inferior production. The score is basically 50% of the movie. In addition to the score, Casi casi also pays homage to its tropical roots with its very own salsa score (done by Frankie Ruiz & Jerry Medina) that will surely stick to you for a while.

Almost all the main parts (excluding the adult characters) were first time teen actors. Except for some minor awkward moments with the main character's (Emilio's) tone of voice, the acting is very good. The acting in Casi casi can undoubtedly hold up to the professional actors from other Puerto Rican productions. In my opinion, there was nothing amateur in any of these kids' acting, except of course for the character of ngel. He sucked, he was horribly bad.

Finally, I also recommend this movie because it is a very good movie. Lots of meat in its bones. It is a fun movie. If you want to see an interesting foreign fun film for the whole family, then Casi casi is for you.",1179878400,29,2720,4.72

The story has a message, but it's not at all preachy.  The cast is great.  The typical student types are there -- the snobby conceited girl, the class clowns, the loyal friend, the all-around teenager, the mean school administrator and even the student who comes back because school was fun!  The setting is Puerto Rico and you can point out differences between American and PR high schools.  Highly recommended. I was a sub for a week and all the classes LOVED it!

2755466,3,B000N3SU6K,"The problem goes beyond a few instances of inappropriate language.

At least one of the characters cannot be understood a good deal of the time.  This is not an issue of ""too fast"".  When asked an educated, native Puerto Rican (who is a Spanish teacher) what he is saying, the answer was, ""this is not Spanish!"".

Much of the slang is not usable in terms of teaching it to the kids - it would be a waste of time to compile a list - a good deal of the slang appears to be indicative of only Puerto Rico - and at that, some expressions cannot be found in standard dictionaries.  This makes this vocabulary unusable for me in my classroom.

I cannot have my students compare their school to this one (cultural comparison), because a school like this one does not appear to exist.  From what I have learned, in Puerto Rico a person off the street CANNOT waltz into a high school and ""hang out"".  There are very strict limitations as to who can enter these establishments.

The subtitles are in English.  My classes are in Spanish.

It gets 3 stars because hey - it's funny.  I just cannot use it in the classroom for the purposes of advancing knowledge of the language or the culture, and that was the purpose of buying this film, and I believe many Spanish teachers buy it for that purpose as well.",1397260800,,1295,4.372384937238493

There is also quite a bit of sexually suggestive language, such as one character telling the other to ""Chupa"", (suck), and discussing their sexual frustrations.

Casi Casi is a little gem, particularly because it is a very well observed, unassuming and delightfully humorous story of things that in high school seem to be earth-shattering life experiences. First of all the topic is unusual for Latin American films, which seldom portray regular, unspoiled or untroubled teens who are not ground down by the terrible political, economic or social situations found in most Latin countries (which does not mean that such films aren't worthwhile). Secondly, it rings true, because the creators dealt honestly, sincerely and humorously with a topic that in other hands might have ended up as trite or a waste of time. The cast of first-time teenage actors is excellent, giving very natural, focused and comedic performances. The directors were also very adept at portraying their characters with warmth and humour and, in the process of not going into grand themes or being overly ambitious, they manage to achieve one of the best films to have come out of Puerto Rico in years, one that I am sure will be able to find broad audiences, while being totally true to the setting and cultural realities in which middle class Puerto Ricans live.

""Casi, Casi"" is a delightful film that captures the wacky misadventures of painfully self-conscious and joyfully social teenagers at a Puerto Rican high school.  The spirit of this film and its story connect with students drawing them into the language and culture without force.  Students actually care what happens to the characters.  Instead of showing students some ""weird"" different culture, it humanizes spanish-speakers, showing kids just like them, dealing with problems just like them, in a school just like theirs.

I loved the ""accento puertorriqueo"" and the inside view of life in a high school where they speak Spanish.  My students had great discussions comparing their own group of friends to those of Emilio and wondering what crazy things they would get themselves into just because they like a girl.",1235952000,19,1086,5.242774566473988
2755497,5,B000N3SU6K,"Watching this movie brought back so many memories of the one semester I spent attending a public school in Rio Piedras. So many of the school dynamics don't change from one generation to the next.
I show this movie to my 8th grade Spanish class as part of our end of the year celebration and they love it. The kids enjoy the premise, the slapstick, suspense and the occasional gross joke. My one concern for this age group was the use of the word ""bitch"" in the English subtitles but it's part of a scene that can be easily fastforwarded (no captions show this way)for the 'sake of time'.",1230249600,3,588,4.4036697247706424
2755498,4,B000N3SU6K,"I was hoping to show this to my high school students, but the language in the subtitles is awful.  I think the language is much worse than a typical US PG-13 movie so be aware this is not PG material.  (For schools, this can be a very touchy subject!)  It is a cute movie and IF I could show it to them or find some way to bleep out all the bad words in the subtitles, my students would really enjoy it.  As it is now, though, I'm the only one who is enjoying it.",1215129600,12,463,3.8421052631578947
2755499,3,B000N3SU6K,"Enjoyable and well made, but not very original or memorable, teen comedy from Puerto Rico.  The film seems more remarkable than it really is when compared to other mediocre Puerto Rican films and when you learn about the minimal budget and the filmmakers lack of experience, but the movie doesnt break any new ground (on the contrary) and, like most teen movies, has some very improbable moments.  Casi casi is just a well-acted (except for the tone of the main character's narration, which sounded effeminate at times), amusing and unpretentious teen movie.",1214265600,2,558,5.054347826086956
2755500,4,B000N3SU6K,My Spanish students liked this movie very much.  The slangs and the relationships among Puerto Rican high school students are very realistic.,1213574400,3,141,5.409090909090909
2755501,4,B000N3SU6K,"I think that if I was in the 12-15 range I would have rated this film a five. As an adult I am rating the storyline a three, however the film was edited so well and the photography shots were so great that I give it a five in that arena. It also have some laughs and if you are a US Puerto Rican you will learn words and sayings that you have never been exposed to before- a little strange but at the same time sort of instructive.",1211155200,2,431,3.853932584269663
2755502,5,B000N3SU6K,"Casi Casi is a great Puerto Rican film that will leave you longing for more.  I had never even heard of the movie before, but decided to take a chance on it and buy it. After all - I knew Marian Pabon's work from TV and other media, and I figured it would be a good way to support the Puerto Rican film industry. After watching the movie I can honestly say that it was very well done. The young actors impressed me with their ability to carry their characters in a superb way. The story line was great and the score was fantastic. This movie is a must see!",1210032000,2,556,4.054545454545455

This movie is 100% true to the Puerto Rican culture. If you are not Puerto Rican, you will still laugh and enjoy this great film. I'm looking forward to more from the Valles brothers!!",1202601600,3,328,4.222222222222222

2755505,5,B000N3SU6K,"A delightful picture made in Puerto Rico and in a league with many Hollywood productions, the writers/directors have managed to extract excellent preformances from the amateur teenage cast. Hollywood tends to use older actors in teenage roles who can look back at their adolescence and express what they felt objectively (Stockard Channing was 32 when she starred in Grease). Mssrs Valls managed to get these teenagers to show all their angst, sexual frustrations and romantic aspirations even though they may not even understand them now. There was a true sense of discipline and professionalism in all aspects of the production. Although this movie is in Spanish, the mostly Anglo audience reacted effusively to the situations and even to the spoken jokes--this mainly due to the excellent subtitle translation and timing. The mix of suspense and comedy was enhanced by the excellent musical score that made the action seem like a choreographed ballet. The character of the school Principal, played by Marian Pabn (who is the only professional actor in the cast), was perfectly executed with time-bomb constrained subtlety as she tried to take control of the students while repressing her own sexual frustrations. The Valles Brothers affectionately remember their heritage with a subtle allusion to their grandfather, the late Mario Pabn--TV producer/director, in the form of a gingerly placed photograph. I'm sure he is proud.",1183852800,61,1429,5.355555555555555
2755506,5,B000N3SU6K,"Casi Casi is a very enjoyable movie. It brings back all the memories and angst of high school. The characters are well developed and performed, from the stern principal, students and teachers down to the endearing janitor.
Emilio & Jacklynne, the would be sweet hearts, are surrounded by a cast of classmates and one delightful interloper. With out spoiling the story, I can say that all ends well with some surprizing twists. Of course there are many hi-jinx along the way. The musical score, by Peter Mills, is excellent as is the Latin music by Frankie Perez. Tony Valles & Jaime Valles have outdone themselves on their first movie. The Chicago Latino Film Festival, the Philadelphia Film Festival and the New York International Latino Film Festival agree. The subtitles are so very well done that the movie flows along effortlessly. So treat yourself to a fun movie!",1183075200,6,870,4.925170068027211
2755507,5,B000N3SU6K,"With the exception of Marian Pabon and the actor who plays the computer instructor, all the actors and the writer-director team of Jaime and Tony Valles are amateurs. Jaime and Tony have experience in theatre and opera -- they both sing -- but had never done a movie before. They got this idea of making a film with kids for kids, wrote it, bought or leased digital video equipment and started filming while learning from the manuals. The ressult is a charming family film, well written, well acted and well directed. In January it played in Puerto Rico -- the kids are Puerto Rican -- for 4 weeks, the first week in 13 theaters. HBO will play it in August I believe. I recommend it to everyone no matter the age. They'll have fun and will be amazed at what ""Emilio"" does to win the heart of the prettiest girl in the school and the debacle he causes while doing it.",1182816000,3,866,4.385093167701863
