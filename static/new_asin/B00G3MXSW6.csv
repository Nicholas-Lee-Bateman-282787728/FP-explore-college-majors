6056640,5,B00G3MXSW6,"I find it sad that any gay program on tv gets cancelled before it gets a chance,  This one could have found a following, if given a chance.",1402444800,2,139,3.9642857142857144
6056641,5,B00G3MXSW6,"This is the best gay webseries ever!. Why do alwyas TV shows are based on teenagers or young people? First time I saw this 4 friends together I thought, wow, it is like Sex and the city, but better. Facing the reality in which time catch everyone of us, this guys struggle to find love, comprehension, a place where to fit. And of course, they also struggle with this Peter Pan Syndrome all gay men use to have, we all do.
Besides, David Pevsner (Ross Character) is incredible, so expressive, such an amazing actor that shines on his own. Looking forward for more seasons.
I recommend this Show to everyone.",1399075200,2,607,4.527272727272727
6056642,5,B00G3MXSW6,"I bought this DVD and I LOVE the show.  And I was delighted to find one of my favorite comedy actors in the mix.  Playing the bitchy queen Nelson Bruce Hart was such a delight.  I have been a fan from afar of his appearances in other independent projects like ""The Trouble With Barry"".  Old Dogs and New Tricks is so well turned out it's like a mini version of Sex in the City.  There are some wonderful moments such as when David Pevsner accidently hooks up on line with his friend Curt Bonnem.  And of course Leon Acord (with a fabulous head of hair) leads the fun.  Acord's scenes with his chums and his nemisis played by Hart are hysterical. There is also an obvious and wonderful spoof of a Dynasty water fight that includes Olympian Greg Louganis along with Acord and Hart as well.  Two thumbs up!!",1396656000,4,804,4.348993288590604
6056643,2,B00G3MXSW6,"I can't believe the good reviews for this film.  I found it to be  terrible in every respect - from production values to plot, acting and character development.  I gave it two stars out of kindness.",1396656000,2,198,4.444444444444445
6056644,4,B00G3MXSW6,"When I first watched the pilot on this 2 season disc, I wasn't certain just how much I would like the show. But I found it very funny and very entertaining as well as poignant. There's everything from the gym bunny to the newly 50-year-old wondering if he still has a change at a life of happiness. There's the older actor whose day in the lime light has begun to fade and the well hung Brit-style pop musician with the very large member. It's fun and these guys as a group of men really seem to care for one another. There are some real surprises throughout this 2 season disc. I recommend it!",1393718400,3,594,4.265486725663717
6056645,5,B00G3MXSW6,This was so fun.  Acting was very good. The story is not very believable but what the heck it was so fun.  If you are looking for Tolstoy this is not your movie. But if you are interested in a fun comedy this is a good purchase.,1392940800,7,228,3.8297872340425534
6056646,1,B00G3MXSW6,"I'm over 50 myself, so I was excited to find a series for people like me. I hadn't seen it online, so the DVD was my first viewing.

What a disappointment! It may be relevant to aging gay men in West Hollywood, but to real aging gay men living real lives in the real world? No way.

It's the same old hard-driving, bitchy, super-competitive crap that comes spewing out of West Hollywood constantly. SOMEBODY finds that life appealing, but not me.

There's nothing new or entertaining here, just older characters living the same boring, driven, shallow lives that evidently are what's considered normal in that tiresome place.",1391731200,5,625,4.822429906542056
6056647,3,B00G3MXSW6,"This is an enjoyable farce about a group of middle-aged Gay guys toiling in the West Hollywood disctrict of Los Angeles. It has the feel of a full-feature film, but it was apparently released as an online TV series. The chapters run about 7 minutes each. Well, for the DVD release, they should have done what regular networks do with their series, and that is show it in one continuous whole, instead, you have to either sit through the End Credits every 7 minutes, or have the Remote handy so you can jump to the next chapter - a drag. And that's why I give it only 3 stars.",1390521600,9,575,4.284403669724771
6056648,5,B00G3MXSW6,I really like it. It was put together well. The actors were casted excellently. I wish it had last a little longer.,1388707200,3,115,4.2727272727272725
8620460,5,B00G3MXSW6,"Just a riotous film that is more trueful about West Hollywood than anybody wishes to admit!!  You may think that some of the scenes are little over the top, but honey don't even guess about it, for its all too true!!  Wish there was more!!  NJMJr!!!",1511568000,,249,4.369565217391305
8620461,5,B00G3MXSW6,Great fun. Sexy and real.,1476057600,,25,4.2

8620463,5,B00G3MXSW6,I loved watching scenes on you-tube.  had to order this from you.  There is one movie I want but have trouble finding,1448841600,,117,4.2727272727272725
8620464,1,B00G3MXSW6,"I thought that this was full of stereotypes and lacked any depth of character. I didn't care about any of the characters. I'm so bored with the same old story of wealthy, pissy queens. Yawn.",1438041600,,190,4.457142857142857
8620465,2,B00G3MXSW6,I think is clever and good acting. What I did not like is the format of the dvd...short episodes I got bored and stopped watching after the first disk.,1432425600,,151,4.241379310344827
8620466,5,B00G3MXSW6,"This crew of four gay friends trying to deal with middle age in Hollywood (the land of the perpetually young and beautiful) is delightful.  The writing is crisp funny and the acting started out a little forced but gets better over time.  The episodes are very short but get longer as they go.  This will set you up to crave season 3 which just finished, and FYI, season 4 is reported to be the last season and has yet to begin production.",1424649600,2,438,4.317073170731708
8620467,5,B00G3MXSW6,good,1418860800,,4,4.0
8620468,3,B00G3MXSW6,"Old Dogs & New Tricks was an online series that was awesome for what little it was.  I don't call this a series Old Dogs & New Tricks  was more like a lot of interesting and funny little skits.  The comedy was funny and hip but there just was not enough of it.  I can't fault anything about this little series except its tiny bite size episodes.  I give it 3 stars only because; I was left so hungry for more.  This guy knows how to portray the funniest aspects of gay life.  I woulds have loved 85 continuous minutes of this format without all the annoying breaks between the installments.

I hope the makers of Old Dogs & New Tricks don't take my three star rating to mean I hated it because; the concept and execution are five stars solid the lack of finished product is a true and honest buzz kill.",1413244800,2,802,4.196078431372549
8620469,4,B00G3MXSW6,Excellent series!  Especially liked the fact that it contained older gay characters! Life does not end at 40 or 50!,1412035200,2,115,4.75
