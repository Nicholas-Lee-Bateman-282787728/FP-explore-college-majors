When I look at it now I see the charming combination between Cinderella and Pigimallion that probably was so appealing to me back then as a romantic girl - but still, it is a nice story of nice people that I'd be glad even today to adopt and add to my family. And who needs more?",1260921600,3,385,3.948717948717949

3788288,4,B001T7O25M,"...who needs critics?  I don't own this DVD either, but most people who've watched the series would recognize the couple on the DVD cover as Dr. Enys and the doomed miner's wife he falls for. Yeah, it's a little weird not to have Ross & Demelza front and center, but get out your reading glasses and check out the cast members at the top of the cover if you need further reassurance-- This is the 'proper' Season 1 of Poldark, not a misbegotten sequel.

Sadly, there was a misbegotten sequel. Gladly, this isn't it.",1260144000,2,515,4.468085106382978

3788290,5,B001T7O25M,Count me in! I too have been waiting forever for this series to make its appearance. It's the kind of romantic swashbuckling entertainment they don't make any more.  Hooray!!! Can't wait for Series 2 to be announced.,1259539200,24,216,4.837837837837838

3788293,5,B001T7O25M,"As a habitual viewer of Masterpiece Theatre for its first twenty years, I find it shocking that one of its top five productions has taken so long to be made available on DVD in the U.S.  The series is a ""costume drama,"" set in the late 18th Century.  Ross Poldark, a captain in the British army, returns to his home in Cornwall after escaping from a prison camp following the American Revolution.  The original novel, by Winston Graham, was entitled ""The Renegade,"" and Ross is every bit that.  He finds that his father has died, his intended--hearing the report that he is MIA and presumed dead--has become engaged to Ross' cousin Francis.  The Poldarks are minor gentry, but Francis' side of the family has been more prosperous.  Ross soon discovers that the bad economic times has led his uncle (thinking he is the beneficiary of his late brother's estate) to make a verbal agreement to sell Ross' last economic asset, a coal mine, to a ""nouveau riches,"" conniving banker, Warleggan.  When Ross suddenly turns up alive, and Ross decides not to effect the sale, the stage is set for the rivalry that is one of the propulsive motifs of the series.  The entire series (and Poldark II) is a powerful commentary of life in late 18th Century Britain.

  The acting, story-line, scenery are all first-rate.  Robin Ellis is magnificent, as is Angahaard Rees as Demelza, the lower class raif who seduces Ross after the disappointment of Elizabeth (Jill Townsend), his former love, marrying Francis (wonderfully played by Clive Francis).  The scene-stealer though is Ross' no-account, lazy, boozing servant Jud Painter (Paul Curran).

  As seen in the U.S., each episode of roughly 50 minutes, had a ""cliffhanger"" ending.  The VHS tapes dispensed with this very effective format (and butchered the gorgeous opening and final credit theme music).  The British DVD set presented the series as two hour episodes.

  Only ""Upstairs, Downstairs,"" ""I, Claudius,"" ""Danger:UXB"" and ""Brideshead Revisited"" are in the same league as the two ""Poldark"" series.",1152921600,50,2041,5.0148809523809526
3788294,4,B001T7O25M,Love this series! I recognized all of the characters and realized that I must have seen some of it when it originally aired. I enjoyed the acting  although the character of Judd seems to be way over acted. The story seems to be much more detailed than the current version of Poldark so it isn't completely about Ross and Demelza although they are the main focus. It's a soap opera for sure! Lot's of fun set in beautiful countryside.,1486339200,,433,4.481012658227848

3788301,5,B001T7O25M,"I have loved this series since I first watched it on PBS back in the 1980's. I realize that it doesn't quite measure up to the high production values of the remake currently airing on PBS but in many ways I like it better. Some of the characterizations I prefer to the new series (Judy Geeson's Caroline Penvenen, Paul Curran's Jud Paynter, and Ralph Bates' George Warleggan to name a few). Also I think it gives more of an explanation as to the enmity between Ross Poldark and George Warleggan. Well worth viewing at least once.",1483401600,,529,4.520833333333333

3788305,5,B001T7O25M,"Before you purchase, please note, this is NOT the DVD of the remake of the series that's on TV now.  This is the original Poldark that aired on the PBS network as a two season series from 1975 to 1977.  This is Season 1.  I just reviewed Season 2 with the same warning to customers because a lot of reviewers had purchased it thinking it was the remake version.  It isn't.  The remake is out on DVD for Season 1, starring Aiden Turner as Ross Poldark.  The character in the original was played by Robin Ellis.

I saw this series when it first aired and thought it was excellent.  I'm hoping to get Season 2 if the price goes down a little.  Right now, it's over my budget.",1482019200,,672,4.1875

3788308,5,B001T7O25M,"I have been watching the new Masterpiece Theater production and have been disappointed.  It is much too choppy.  Jed and Prudie have been reduced to background only.  The new Demelza is not fiery enough.  Hugh Bedrogan pops in without any explanation of his character.  There is too much focus on Ross, Elizabeth, and Demelza.  The secondary characters from the books and original series are missing. My disappointment led to my checking out the original again.  Much, much better!  Many of the book's characters are here.  Love Jed and Prudie, Verity, Frances, Jenny, and so many more in the original.  Why mess with near perfection?  Please revisit the original Poldark.  And better yet, read the books.  They are wonderful!",1481846400,4,726,5.0508474576271185

It took a couple of episodes to get me engaged. I wasn't sure I liked the Robin Ellis Poldark as much as Aidan Turner's. But it wasn't long before I was just as invested in it as I am in the current series. Even though television  productions weren't as sophisticated as they are now, it is a plot that draws us in. Now I love (or hate) the original characters as much as I do the current ones. Definitely worth the watch if you are a Poldark fan.",1478563200,2,635,4.291666666666667

3788344,4,B001T7O25M,"Better than season 2 in most respects, and absolutely addictive. The character of Francis very interesting and well cast. George Warleggan still my favorite character -- weird, I know. Of course some episodes made me mad, but any good soap opera stirs up your emotions and gets you frustrated. If you didn't find stuff to criticize, you wouldn't have fun.  The show has everything you can want-- humor, pathos, drama, romance, family dynamics, lovely costumes, and gorgeous scenery. As for the "" acting"" complaints I see popping up in other reviews, I think if you really know anything about acting an older style of performing won't bother you. Aiden is not a better "" actor"" than Robin Ellis-- he's just more beefed up and doesn't remember to put on a shirt.
I have one minor complaint and one major one. The minor one is the casting of Dr Enys in the first season-- I happen to personally not like this actor as much and I found his performance to be greasy and patronizing.
The big problem is the horrible introduction of Demelza. It says a lot for the beautiful Angharad Rees that you still love Demelza after she's married to Ross--- the episodes concerning her role as a single woman in Ross's house were terrible. It's no surprise the author was offended when he saw them. Their romance had a nasty beginning. It didn't come across as a mistake that evolves into a beautiful love story. It just felt like a one night stand where the guy doesn't care and the girl doesn't have common sense. Demelza's character suffered from this-- she comes across as morally and mentally obtuse.
But after they get married she does evolve into the gracious spunky lady you love in Season 2. So don't worry and keep on watching.",1470960000,3,1719,4.654605263157895

3788374,2,B001T7O25M,"Where to begin.  In spite of the positive reviews I found this version extremely disappointing.  It followed the book poorly.  Demelza is portrayed as a thieving, combative street urchin completely unlike her portrayal in the book.  Her one true companion, the dog Garrick and the reason Ross befriended her, was missing from the film altogether.  Robin Ellis as Ross Poldark delivers his lines loudly as if the entire cast were hard of hearing.  The characters for the most part simply weren't believable.  It had more the feel of a stage play rather than a film.  On top of that, the video quality of the DVD was very poor.  I gave up after the first two episodes on disc 1.  The latest version of the story is better acted, more believable and follows the book very well.

3788387,1,B001T7O25M,"I think I remember watching the original series almost 40 years ago. but couldn't even remember for sure, and definitely didn't remember if I liked it. But I assumed since it was Masterpiece Theater, it must have been great TV for its time. Was I ever mistaken! Some of my objections may be to a terrible dubbing job, probably film or tape to digital, as many have commented. The color is faded and washed out, snowy and out of focus... just terrible overall visual quality. But the acting is awful and the plot veers wildly from the books and that's not bad dubbing. I **loved** the new 2015 version, so that makes the differences even more marked. The new series follows the books faithfully (at least the first 2 that were covered in the first season). Aiden Turner plays Ross as so tightly wound and always the region's black sheep and contemptuous of the local gentry class that he's thoroughly believable. Knowing that in real life he's a slightly goofy, happy-go-lucky Irishman makes his acting and immersion into the character even more impressive. And I have to admit, even at my age, that dark brooding persona was hot, hot, hot! Robin Ellis' original Ross doesn't come anywhere close - either to Turner's wonderful job this year or to the books' character. The acting among the other characters is just as disappointing. It reminded me of one of those 30's or 40's movies - the dialog is always rushed and characters step on each other's lines as if they're racing to finish the scene. There is nothing genuine or realistic about it. That's what this was like watching it. So far, I've labored through the first disc, 4 episodes to the point where Ross is breaking up with Elizabeth due to Demelza's out-of-wedlock pregnancy. (As I said, the plot veers wildly from the books) I also saw a clip of a future episode where the Rev Ossie Whitworth meets Morwenna after George has arranged their marriage. He is dressed in something resembling a Halloween costume - he looks like a clown!. In the books, he was written to be a bit of a dandy, far too concerned with his appearance and social connections for a minister. But the acting was soooo over-the-top and silly is was painful to watch. The whole production reminds me of amateur community theater. I doubt very much that I will watch the rest of the discs if this one was so disappointing. You'd spend your time better re-watching this year's version.",1442793600,,2414,4.682352941176471
3788388,2,B001T7O25M,"I do remember when this came out in the 70's and for the time it was great and I enjoyed it along with Dark Shadows. However, I tried watching it again all these years later....couldnt get past the 2nd episode. Poor cinamatography; felt like I was watching  a soap opera. Robin Ellis was fine but he lacked the fluid micro expressions so wonderfully mastered by Aiden Turner. The actress who played Elizabeth was awful and painful to watch. The way she was shot made her forehead look like a giant egg. So distracting. The actor who played Francis was equally bad. All in all the only thing going for the series was it's length which allowed for more character developement but that is about all. How anyone can say this was so much better than the 2015 version I am utterly at a loss. The acting in the new version is so much more fluid and real. The cinamatography...beautifully enchanting. I like my film experience to be immersive and the 2015 version does just that. For a brief time I am transported back to the 1780's and can feel the Cornish wind. The 70's version I feel like I am a spectator watching a poorly acted play with bad lighting.",1442620800,5,1149,4.4714285714285715

3788425,5,B001T7O25M,"Ross Poldark returns to Cornwall from fighting against the Americans in the Revolutionary War to find his father dead, economic conditions bad, the Wheal Leisure mine nearly exhausted, the familys residence in a ruinous condition, and his true love Elizabeth, who had thought him dead, engaged to his cousin, Francis.  And this triangle becomes a quadrangle, because Elizabeth is also the object of banker George Warleggans affections.  Tension between Poldark and the Warleggan family also arises from the fact that the Warleggans, although descendants of illiterate blacksmiths, often employ their considerable financial power against Poldark.  Francis sister Verity appears destined to become an old maid.  And Rosss servants, Jud and Prudie, have been raising chickens in the living room and sampling libations from the family wine cellar.  After rescuing what he believes is a young lad who is being beaten by an angry merchant, Ross discovers that the lad is actually a destitute teenage girl, Demelza.  Thus, as there are three men in Elizabeths life, there are two women in Rosss life.

The Poldark saga is based on the novels of Winston Graham  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winston-Graham-Poldark-Collection-3-Book-Set-Ross-Poldark-Demelza-Jeremy-Poldark/dp/1509801545/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winston Graham Poldark Collection 3-Book Set:  Ross Poldark, Demelza, Jeremy Poldark</a>, and subsequent volumes).  Graham spent many years in Cornwall and was evidently fascinated by its history.  From 1945 to 2002, he published 12 novels about the adventures of the Poldark family from 1783 to 1820.  Graham conducted extensive research in Cornish history.  And his books reflect his knowledge of mining, and local customs, notably the tradition of collective action in smuggling, rioting (the riot in episode 5 may have been inspired by an actual riot in Truro over corn prices), dealing with ship wrecks, and punishing informers.  In general, Grahams sympathies are with the common people, although he finds worthy and unworthy persons in all classes.

Several Poldark novels were brought to the screen in the 1970sthe first four volumes (1783 -1793) in Series I, and volumes 5  7 (1794  1799) in Series II.  Two decades later, an attempt was made to film the events in volume 8 (1810-1811), but this effort met a somewhat unfavorable receptionthose who had not seen Series I and II did not know the history of the Poldarks, and those who had seen the previous Series did not accept the changes in the cast.  A new Poldark series is currently being telecast in the U.S. by PBS.

The 1970s version was filmed in location in Cornwall.  In it we see filthy miners in dimly lit mines, and the gentry socializing and dancing in collars, frilly cuffs and powdered wigs.  The domestic scenes were filmed in Cornish houses and farms; the mine scenes in the Levant Mine, with filming guided by advice from the Camborne School of Mines.

The casting in Series I and II was extremely effective.  As Ross Poldark, Robin Ellis captures the heros courage, loyalties, strong emotions, impulsiveness, and occasional willingness to break the law.  He is more comfortable around the common people than around the gentry; and he informs an Anglican clergyman that North American Indians are often more Christian than we.  Angharad Rees was an excellent choice for the role of Demelza, who gradually transforms herself from an unwashed, uneducated, and undisciplined pickpocket into a lady.  But Demelza (who may be based on Grahams real life wife) is never entirely accepted by societyand her loyalties are to her people, who are poor, ignorant and rough, but at least they're honest.  Jill Townsend, with an improbable resume that includes a number of American television westerns, is effective as Elizabeth.  Even the minor characters, such as the dissolute neighbor Sir Hugh Bodrugan, the loquacious banker Pascoe, and the absent-minded solicitor Pearce, have distinctive personalities.  Especially noteworthy is Paul Curran, whose portrayal of Judfond of liquor but averse to work, missing various teeth, but never lacking explanations for delaying tasks, or assigning them to someone elsebrings a touch of levity to many scenes.

The newest version of Poldark features more imaginative filming techniques, especially panoramic shots and views of figures walking or riding along the horizon.  But its casting is more conventional, and the differences between the characters are less pronounced.  In particular, Eleanor Tomlinson is less credible than Angharad Rees as Demelzaa motherless waif who has been sleeping rough and stealing food to stay alive.  And Philip Davis performance as Jud lacks the antic humor that Paul Curran brought to this role in the earlier version.  But Heida Reed, as Elizabeth, bears a strong resemblance to Jill Townsend.  Casting is a matter of personal preferenceif you believe that some performances by members of the 1970s Poldark cast were over the top, you may be happier with the performances of the current cast.

3788465,3,B001T7O25M,"My wife and I watched the whole series and found it interesting enough but not nearly up to par with the other BBC productions we have enjoyed.  The lead female characters were annoying.  Elizabeth had as much appeal as a dead fish, virtually emotionless and bland. It seemed to me that this may have had as much to do with the actress playing the part as the role itself. The character Demelza was another story.  Basically she was a classic whiner and I got tired of her overacting quite early in the series.  How Poldark could find any redeeming qualities in these two is beyond me.  The rest of the cast was excellent.

Each episode ended with an attempt at a cliffhanger which really wasn't as intriguing as it hoped to be.  The whole series seemed more like a videotaped stage play than a smooth flowing production, like for instance ""Wives And Daughters"".",1344470400,,862,4.594771241830065

3788467,4,B001T7O25M,"Although the Poldark series will appear dated to younger people, it is a lesson in the value of good casting, straight forward and clear story telling and cinematography and the proper place of design and art direction.

In the 21st century, too many TV shows and movies obsess over the frills at the expense of fundamentals and many a project has gone down in flames as over art directed, over designed, over directed and over photographed failures. Give a director too much time and money and generally speaking they will waste it and it will only be a distraction.

One can only wonder what Scorcese's 'Gangs of New York' would have been like as a black and white, gritty small budget film as opposed to the Warner Bros. cartoon it turned out as. If they ever remake the Poldark series I can practically guarantee it will go down this 'bigger and better' path of needless extravagance and ultimate failure.

Not every scene needs to be dressed to the max nor shot at sunset and the budget and schedule of Poldark provided, wittingly or unwittingly, its own type of verisimilitude and authenticity beyond the grasp of film makers today - too much money and scope can be a bad thing and lead one astray. Let's face it: a bigger budget and more time would not have made Poldark 1 a better series. Even having the indoor scenes shot on video and the outdoor ones on film, something common in England at the time, doesn't even dent this wonderful series.

Considering this first series of Poldark is the equivalent of one season of a TV show, the evolution of the characters and story telling is astonishing as each few hours is more sure handed than the last. Poldark is one of the very best written and presented mini-series in the history of TV and should be presented in film school for any writer who longs for a big budget when in fact it is the fundamentals that make for good film and TV. There is something to be said for simply putting one's head down and apparently inconspicuously and artlessly presenting art and Poldark says it.",1316822400,4,2040,4.596153846153846
3788468,5,B001T7O25M,"It took me a while to warm to this show. At first, I found it stagey and old-fashioned; it seemed more like filmed theatre rather than TV per se, a few of the actors appeared to be ""projecting"" all the way to the outer stalls, and the action scenes were amateurish and even laughable.

By Episode Six or thereabouts, however, I was engrossed. Not by the plot, which is more or less routine fare and badly lacking in the twists and turns we expect from modern TV drama, but by the dialogue, which is not only unusually literate but has a directness and pungency I loved. I was constantly intrigued by what the characters would say and the continually interesting ways in which they said it. I also found the air of unostentatious stoicism refreshing; the characters habitually endure without complaint vicissitudes that would nowadays bring clamours for round-the-clock counselling sessions and candlelight vigils. The characters have personality; there are very few ""types"" and every time I thought I had them pegged they'd do something to surprise and intrigue me. And the acting also has its own stamp: it doesn't have the documentary-style realism of today but it has tang and bite. Even the bad acting is entertainingly so.

As I said, the plot isn't the thing. I get the impression the writers were bored with the basic story and this may explain the lack of suspense and the perfunctory resolution of most of the action. The climaxes just don't carry any bang to them and if your main interest is in What Happens you will probably be bored and exasperated. This series hinges not on its tale but on the little details of Cornish life at the end of the 18th Century - a ""World"" rather than a series of events and something to be savoured rather than to get overtly excited about. If you prefer to sip rather than gulp it will be for you.",1313712000,,1842,4.629969418960244

Fortunately I was able to purchase the series on DVD and wow!  Ross Poldark is one of the most fascinating fictional characters I've ever met.  Structurally, the story is a triangle love story and Ross's decision to bring Demelza into his life causes repercussions socially.  Until this series I was not familiar with the economy and history of Cornwall and the cinematography can only be described as ""loving.""
Do be warned, though.  The series is addictive.  I next had to find the second series and then went on to read all the books, as well as Graham's autobiography and his book on Cornwall.

I began reading the books just before I began college and brought the last few books with me and finished them before I began my school work!  The actors who I really never saw in anything again are so memorable in their roles and the show is true to the book with a little embellishment for visible drama instead of the internal tension easily communicated in books.

The great news is that the picture quality is excellent.  In fact the show was shot as all bbc shows were on film for the outdoors footage and video tape for the indoor footage. And unlike many shows from this period the show looks fantastic. The bbc managed to perserve this one unlike many shows from this era which were wiped from tape forever.  The acting is outstanding and the shows story is very engrossing based on some fine novels. It has two series out there adapting the books and this is why you need to watch both series.  another good fact is that unlike many shows from this era that there are no distortions in the remaining prints. Many shows from then will have these video defects as the bbc had to hunt down copies after they wiped many shows made from 1935-77, before people stopped them!  So thankfully this one was saved from erasure and will live on in this fine dvd. there are some defects in the film section but hardly a problem unlike lets say some bbc shows that are just destroyed basically.  Poldark has romance and struggle and period customes galore. Men can enjoy this as much as the ladies as the dashing poldark tries to do the right thing usually in a bad world.

Poldark is well acted, otherwise the it could not hold up and the good reputation the series has would not have come about. Robin Ellis was well cast, he's a likable character as are many of the other characters both good and bad! The character of Judd sometimes steals the show with his awful and charming actions.

I've ever seen. You will fall in love with the wild beauty of Cornwall, the deep characters and the lavish costumes.
Ross Poldark is a Captain returning from the war in America. Thought dead, he had escaped from a French prison with a slight limp and a large
(not unsexy) scar on his cheek. Ross returns to find his father dead, the family estate in ruins, no finances and his fiancee engaged to marry his cousin.
This just sets the stage for a wonderful complicated story with a true sense of history.
As the story unfolds you meet Demelza Carne a street urchin that Ross picks up in Truro and brings back to his home . This begins the love triangle that
plays out through out the entire series.
The quality of the DVD has been excellent. I have not watched them all yet, as I save them for special indulgent days(Daze).

From its historical significance just after the American Revolutionary War, to its character development, endless twists of plot, tight dialogue, fabulous costumes and scenery, good vs. evil, humor and pathos, and on and on, ""Poldark"" is tops.

Why Robin Ellis and Angharad Rees never did more to appeal to the American audience is a shame.  They are so convincing and so filled with positive chemistry on the TV screen.  We often hear about actors being ""type cast"" and that may be the problem. In any event, hats off for what you did with ""Poldark,"" because we've never seen a better dramatic series than this.

At this writing, my wife and I have almost finished viewing Series 1, and have found it to be every bit as good as when we first saw it, around 35 years ago.

He denied it.([...]) Winston Graham is also the author of a number of films including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie. Winston Graham personally picked Sean Connery to play the male lead in Marnie. That was before Sean became James Bond.

3788492,5,B001T7O25M,"Like many, I have been periodically checking for the last 15 years for ""Poldark"" to come to American DVD.  It finally came and I bought it as soon as I could!  An excellent and very compelling drama, well written, acted, directed and produced.  It's hard to watch just one episode ... and before long, it's done.  My only criticism is that it's not as visually sharp as what we are used to these days.  I'm guessing it's because the original was taped rather than filmed.  Too bad, for the sets and costumes are spectacular.  But the content brings it back up to 5 stars!",1269820800,3,571,4.4326923076923075
3788493,5,B001T7O25M,"Oh, how I've waited to see POLDARK again!  It's like meeting old friends again after a long, long separation.

Yes, the LOOK of the series will seem somewhat dated, but the visual quality of the DVD is high, particularly in the outdoor scenes.  (Cornwall is so photogenic.)

This historical drama has everything: romance, intrigue, comedy, and even swashbuckling action.  Ross Poldark (Robin Ellis) is an unusually enlightened man for one of his class and time. He is also a very complex hero, unable to rid himself of a youthful dream in the person of his first love Elizabeth (Jill Townsend).  Back from fighting for the British in the American Revolution, he returns to find Elizabeth engaged to his own cousin, his father dead and business affairs a mess. Then there is Demelza (the lovely and charming Angharad Rees) a young girl Ross rescues from poverty. Demelza, honest, fiery, loyal and goodhearted, offers Ross the chance at love and happiness withheld by the cold and haughty Elizabeth, though the foolish man of course continues to pine for his old flame.

Where would a story like this be without outstanding villains?  The Warleggans are of low birth but have great wealth.  The son George (played to perfection by the late Ralph Bates) envies and covets all that the Poldarks have.  The cool Machiavellian moves of the Warleggans contrast with the hot temper and emotional choices of Ross, which often threaten to undo him.  While the Warleggans are ruthless and uncaring about the lower classes, Ross sacrifices to help the poor miners and tenants who live on his land.  And then there are the conflicts within Ross' own family, which are colored by his unresolved feelings for Elizabeth and used by the Warleggans to their advantage.

All this takes place against a backdrop of societal revolution, both in England and abroad. The series goes to great pains to contrast the lifestyles of the rich with the poor, while showing the strengths and flaws of both worlds.  My favorite examples are a bizarre wake for one of the poor characters, an impromptu trial for someone who betrayed the villagers, and a particularly hedonistic party for the upper class characters.

Watch one episode, I guarantee you'll be hooked!",1269734400,9,2232,4.946380697050938
3788494,4,B001T7O25M,"I know this series well.  I saw it for the first time when it was broadcast on Masterpiece Theater back in the 70s, and then I videotaped it when it was re-broadcast in the early 80s.  I've watched it so many times that the tapes are worn out and I can recite the dialogue.  I was thrilled to find the series finally produced in DVD.  They are the real deal.  Unlike the boxed VHS sets, the episodes are reproduced in their entirety (some scenes in the VHS were cut down or deleted entirely).  The DVDs are pretty basic - the 16 episodes, subtitles (very handy for understanding some of that tricky Cornish dialogue) and standard playback options (individual episodes, continuous, or scene to scene).  The quality of the video is decent considering how long ago they were filmed but certainly nothing like today's high def productions.  The ""extras"" are not that special and for this reason the DVD earns only 4 stars instead of 5.  The actor filmographies and Cornwall feature are just text and not interactive.  Some actor interviews, Cornwall video, map of key film locations, etc., would have been nice additions.  Even without those, fans can enjoy well-produced episodes of Poldark.

3788496,5,B001T7O25M,"Get swept into the 18th century amidst the gentry & poor of a romantic saga from TV CLASSICS. The DVD series (originally BBC, PBS) was based on the 13-book Poldark series (1945-2002) by Winston Graham, explaining the saga length. Of course only a fraction of the books are included, but what a stellar delight the film version is--and its historical enchantment is timeless. It has been ranked among the all-time top-10 of Masterpiece Theatre, making it a ""masterpiece"" in itself.

There is suspense and drama in abundance throughout this 16-episode DVD version of ""POLDARK"". Many would call it romance due to the ongoing relationships involved in families. Others consider it primarily historical drama due to its period artistry in costuming, sets, and dialogue. Yes there is the temptation to also list it under documentary, because of the Cornwall location and the picturesque travelogue-like camera vistas constantly across the screen. Of course being the 1700s, post American Revolutionary War, it's a bit of time travel, very realistically done footage.

Ross Poldark (Robin Ellis) returns to Cornwall (extreme SW England) to rebuild a life on the Nampara estate. Lover Elizabeth (Jill Townsend) thinking Ross killed, is spoken for by Ross' cousin. Demelza (Angharad Rees) a street-wise rag-a-muffin offers to undress for a coin. Thus the saga begins. There are financial struggles, shipwreck, family situations, fights, smuggling, murders, fires, babies, dances, and all the assorted 18th century attributes of a saga. This DVD set covers only 2 generations, not counting babies born and lost.
___Favorite quote from this DVD set: ""It be a hard life, Captain. Thank God it do last no longer than a lifetime, or I couldn't live through it."" Jud.

With a series this significant, there are always comparisons. Adventures at ""Nampara"" remind me of Glenbogle in ""Monarch of the Glen."" Cross-class romance is also similar, as is the struggle of keeping the estate. But Scottish Highlands' Monarch had decades to learn from the success of rocky coastal Poldark, so we see which was the chicken and which the egg. A year earlier ""The Pallisers"" proved another great British political/family/sage hit. It is similar in character driven strength and accuracy to the details of the past, including scenery, costumes, and the like. Perhaps another later comparison would be with ""The Barchester Chronicles"", which like ""Pallisers"" was an Anthony Trollope book adoption. ""The Adams Chronicles"" is the American comparison to ""Poldark"", 18th century lives, history, and struggles among those who HAVE compared to those without. But it also followed the ""Poldark"" success, so this DVD is a leader in this grand sort of romantic historical saga miniseries which holds a full larder of suspense, mystery, adventure, triumph, and loss. [All comparison DVDs are highly recommended viewing. Search for them.]

821 min. of CLASSIC MASTERPIECE THEATRE AT ITS BRITISH FINEST.
Casting is fabulous which you will see in BONUS filmographies, as well as a DVD feature giving historical background for Cornwall, England.
SUBTITLES are provided, nice for learning names and spellings, or for the hearing needs, but the dialogue, although spoken with accents to we ""American colony"" folk, is quite understandable.

Excellent transfer to DVD. Only one problem...although this 16-episode series ends well, and concludes the series satisfactorily, another Series 2 was aired on TV.  After watching this set, the wait for ""Poldark Series 2"" will be bloody difficult.",1263772800,18,3540,5.346499102333932

3788500,5,B001T7O25M,"I challenge anyone to watch this series and not be moved, amused, intrigued, and glued to the screen. Faithful retellings of Winston Graham's unforgettable characters, coupled with a setting that makes me feel as though I am in Cornwall in reality, make this production of POLDARK an absolutely unmissable story. I chanced upon the series years ago (I wish PBS would rerun it) and had the forethought to tape some, but not all, of the episodes. The quality of my tapes, however, is not exceptional, and I've been hoping the DVD would come along.

Robin Ellis as Ross Poldark, Angharad Rees as Demelza, Jill Townsend as Elizabeth, Ralph Bates as Warleggan, and others make this fully-fledged epic of Cornish history and the people who made that history come alive in a story at once part soap opera, part action adventure, and all wonderful. Demelza is fiery, vulnerable, intense, steadfast in her love for Ross; Ross is headstrong, volatile, proud, but highly intelligent; Warleggan is everyone's imagined perfect villain, who actually had promise at one time but now is eaten away by jealousy. Jud Paynter, played with wicked, hilarious understanding by Paul Curran, was one of the most memorable side characters in the production; he has me laughing on the floor at nearly every appearance. The interweaving of all the lives in this tale - Ross, a member of landed gentry who has the odd trait many of the overlords don't - compassion for the working class - is so intricately done that it is hard to believe they aren't the actual characters. The accents are just right (it is almost worthy of a college course to try to unravel what Jud is saying sometimes) and the heartfelt performances by everyone in the cast are amazing. This series is at the top of my list of BBC productions, and instilled a need in me to absorb every book in the series as well (many times by now). I felt almost related to the people onscreen.

If you enjoy English period histories, superbly acted and staged, I cannot recommend anything higher than this series. I am looking forward to it coming on DVD. Even dated, it rings true and fresh. Now I want to go to Cornwall.",1261526400,83,2152,4.736
3788501,5,B001T7O25M,"This has always been my all-time BBC favorite series.  Winston Graham's characters are delightful and his knowledge of Cornwall and it's history is outstanding.

3788502,5,B001T7O25M,"Regarding the new release of Poldark, Series 1, I hope the visual quality is up to the original broadcast standard.  When on PBS, Poldark appeared to have been filmed on video tape, that is to say, very much like daytime soap shows, very clear and lifelike, given the TV definition quality of the time.
I own a complete set of DVDs Series 1 and 2, that was produced (legally licensed) by an Ebay seller.  The episodes are wonderful, but unfortunately, the visual quality is poor, as the DVDs were made by transferring VHS episodes to disc.
With this NEW distribution of Poldark Series 1, I am hoping the DVDs have been created as remastered from the original tapes (and possibly enhanced) so that the visual quality will be much higher.
For anyone not aware of Poldark, the series is indeed unique and is among the finest of shows ever brought to television. All I can say is that few small or large screen movies or series even approach it in its impact on one's memory.  A magnificent series, superb cast, great drama, youthful exuberance, deeply affecting, and characters so powerfully developed that one cannot forget them... Ever!
If there is one TV series that I would have liked to author or work on, it would be Poldark.

UPDATE:  December 23, 2009
I ordered this set directly from Acorn Media at a higher price; it arrived last evening. I'm very happy to report that the DVD picture quality is much better than that of the DVDs I'd purchased from the Ebay seller.  The picture is CLEAR and just as it was when first broadcast on PBS.

8340732,4,B001T7O25M,"This Poldark is the original  1970s mini series, which I actually saw on video tape about 20 years ago. At the time, I loved it. Seeing it again, after watching the new Poldark series, the bloom has come off the rose. It simply does not compare to the new Poldark series, as it looks almost amateurish due to the vast difference in production values and enhancements brought about by new technology. It also has more of a stage production feel to it, as does the acting, rather than that of a film.

Still, I enjoyed it a great deal, once I got over the lackluster production values and the graininess of the film. Having read all twelve of the Poldark books, only seven or eight of them had been published at the time that this series had been filmed. It is a reasonable adaptation, only slightly different from the new Poldark mini-series, which I find to be somewhat more faithful.

Nonetheless, it remains an engrossing family saga featuring the character of Ross Poldark, his wife Demelza, his first love, Elizabeth, and his sworn enemy, George Warleggan. Set in 18th Century Cornwall, it showcases the life of the gentry, as well as that of the villagers and the mining community in which they live.",1509062400,,1205,4.647887323943662
