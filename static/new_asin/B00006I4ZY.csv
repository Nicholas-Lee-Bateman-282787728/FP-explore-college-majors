8172453,3,B00006I4ZY,"There are seven 'public domain' episodes of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", and six of them are found in this set.  A larger number of episodes of ""The Bob Cummings Show"" (aka ""Love That Bob"") are commonly available but, again, only six are here for a total of 12 episodes on three DVDs.  All are presented in reasonably clear picture and sound, the video and audio quality perhaps  being improved by fitting just four 25-minute episodes  onto each  disc.  That said, these shows are in the public domain, so the quality varies, particularly in the Bob Cummings episodes, but all are acceptable.
  An issue I have with this set is that it is rather expensive for the relatively small number of shows included.  Each DVD is in a full-size case,  the three being packaged together in a slipcase.  While this is attractive and organized, it  occupies more shelf space than might be desirable, especially in large or growing collections.  This set was released a few years ago, before some of us had so many DVDs, and the packaging was rather normal for its time, but consumer needs have since changed.
  These are quality comedy shows, and well-presented for material of this type.  The programs and the transfers to DVD rate five stars, but the high price and somewhat outdated, inefficient packaging can tend to make this only a fair prospect today.",1318118400,2,1342,4.744588744588745
