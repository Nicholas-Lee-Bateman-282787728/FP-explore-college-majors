The Shows are Beautifully transferred to DVDs The Colors are very Clear, Bright and Colorful the Sound is very Strong and Powerful considering some of the Shows go back to 1969

The Hee Haw Shows were a Summer replacement Series for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. Each week co-hosts Buck Owens and Roy Clark and the Cast of Comedians and Musicians would Welcome the Biggest Stars in Country Music to Perform their Songs and help deliver the One-Liners

Episode 210 with Invited Guests, Kenny Rogers and Jana Jae and the Hee Haw Cast in Full Color and about 50 minutes in length. Time Life gives you one Episode per DVD and I think they should include at least two of them. Hee Haw ranked in the Top 20 Nationwide in 1971, I never get tired watching the Shows

I love the Old Style of Country Music with the Original Instruments nothing like today most Artists don't even use the Steel Guitar any more which by the way it goes back to 1922 and earlier. The Hee Haw Collection is Part of American Musical History and I Love to be able to watch all the Episodes and Collect Them! ..Thank You D.D.",1355616000,2,1226,4.415929203539823
