3466381,5,B001ARDC0W,"Watched a couple of shows on TV, very light hearted tele-comedy. A nice break from the drama of telenovelas. Glad they are coming out with the entire season. I pre-ordered and can't wait!!!

Amor Mo (""My Love"") is a Spanish-language comedy telecomedy, produced in Argentina by Telefe and for Mexico by Televisa. This romantic comedy features Abril Jurez and Marcos Sinclair, two singles who are forced to share an apartment in Buenos Aires even though they cannot stand each other. The show is also known as Loony Love[1] and My Sweet Love.",1213228800,,540,4.869565217391305

8279238,5,B001ARDC0W,"The DVD ""Amor Mio"" not only met my expectations but exceeded them. The quality of the video is excellent and the delivery was fast and the product arrived in excellent condition. I recommend this show for those people who enjoy romantic comedies; I must say that the DVD does not have subtitles and is entirely in Spanish.",1348963200,,322,4.666666666666667
8279239,5,B001ARDC0W,"vanessa guzman y raul araiza en una excelente comedia romantica, ya de por si solo ver a la diosa de vanessa es suficiente, aqui la vemos en una de sus mejores interpretaciones, reune gracia, belleza, talento y excelente muestra del humor femenino al no querer aceptar que esta enamorada de su  hermanastro, empieza  a verla y no podras dejarla....  eso me paso a mi, se las recomiendo ampliamente.  la calidad de video y audio es del 100%.",1315699200,,440,4.675324675324675
8279240,4,B001ARDC0W,"Amor Mio is a well done sitcom in spanish.  A nice change from the typical spanish telenovella.  It's clean and funny, frequently a bit crazy and sometimes romantic.  The relationship that grows between Marcos and Abril reminds me of the U.S. sitcom ""Mad About You"" while the quirky/zany supporting cast (Vera, Felipe, Santiago, etc.) reminds me of Seinfield.  I've thoroughly enjoyed the show.  I bought it to improve/practice my spanish.  For that purpose it is a bit hard to follow--they speak very fast!  But that is what i'm looking for.  Native speakers of course won't have any problem. :)  I was disappointed that it did not include spanish subtitles since they exist on the broadcast.  The set is 5 Dvds with 50 episodes, 30 minutes each.",1230336000,4,747,4.857142857142857
