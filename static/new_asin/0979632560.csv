7802220,5,0979632560,"For those who like relatively contemporary Irish comedians (i.e. circa 1997 or so), this is an awesome DVD.  It's not Irish comedy for people with the tourist's vision of Ireland expecting jokes about leprechauns and shillelaghs.  Just normal Irish folks doing some deadly comedy.  There are great bits in here from Dermot Morgan, Dylan Moran, Brendan O'Carroll, Kevin Gildea, Dara O'Briain and lots of other hilarious people.  My husband and I laughed our heads off the whole way through it.  Yes, it has lots of cursing, but if you've ever been to Ireland you'd know that that is quite common in everyday language, and you should be expecting it.  Love this DVD!",1214870400,4,664,4.883928571428571
7802221,1,0979632560,"This item was recommended by Amazon for those who were also interested in the irish comedian Hal Roach. (Hal Roach was an Irish comedian whose material is dated but funny, and is clean and very family friendly). I figured this dvd (Cream of Irish Comedy) would be comparable.

I found much of the language higly offensive and other material very irreverent. The ""F"" word is used throughout, and is heavily used in a 'Saprano's-like' skit of the Last Supper.

-Bottom line, I wouldn't take this dvd if you gave it away.",1201132800,4,518,4.681318681318682
