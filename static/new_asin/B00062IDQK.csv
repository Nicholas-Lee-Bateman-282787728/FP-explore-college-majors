8036888,5,B00062IDQK,"One of my favorite movies growing up! This movie still holds a place in my heart. The story is done in animation like Disney's Robin Hood (the people are foxes). The story is about David, his mother, his aunt, maid, and lady Agnience. David (Davy's) father died before he was born, and his mother marries the cruel Mr. Mourdstone because she wants him to have a father. The man sends Davy off to work is his cheese warehouse, where he kidnaps orphans to do free labor. The life is cruel however Davy's positive attitude and kind heart prevail! He falls in love with lady Agnience, and runs off with her to find help for his friends. Together they defeat the evil Mr. Murdstone and his partner Mr. Grienbe.

I admit the story line seems rather harsh and complex but it is done in such a way that makes it a true children's classic. The movie is full of beautiful songs, which children will go nuts over. Till this day I can remember all of them! The movie teaches the importance of reading, and a positive attitude. The characters of the maid, and Mr. McCobber always remind you that ""Something will always come up!"" so always keep your head up and if times are harsh use your imagination.

I recommend this for any child boy or girl, it will become one of their favorites!",1178064000,,1272,4.454935622317596
