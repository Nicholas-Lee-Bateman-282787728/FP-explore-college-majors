2383588,5,B000AABLCQ,"I think Cheaters has to be one of the most entertaining reality type shows on TV. The show really drags you in and gets your attention to stay tuned to see what will happen next between the two people in the realtionship with one another, with the help of the P.I. hired on the case. I'm looking forward to seeing the DVD and the episodes chosen. Should be good entertainment.",1130371200,,376,4.385714285714286
2383589,5,B000AABLCQ,"I think its great that Cheaters is coming out with a ""Best of Cheaters"" DVD. It should be even more entertaining and interesting to see the episodes that they picked out. I watch the show on television whenever I get a chance and I like the concept of the show. Sure it may be unfortunate for the people in the relationship on the show, but I can't help but watch it and see the outcome of what occurs when the spouse finds out the true story about thier partner and affair. Definetly a must show/DVD to at least check out.",1130371200,,523,4.24
2383590,5,B000AABLCQ,"I found the television show ""Cheaters"" to be quite entertaining and I'm glad it is coming out with a DVD of the best episodes. I like how the show is different from other reality-type shows out on television due to a private investigator uncovering hidden affairs for their spouse/partner to know the actual truth and for them to confront their partner.",1130371200,2,353,4.80327868852459
2383591,5,B000AABLCQ,"I think that Joey Greco needs to get control of his show it's not fair that he lets the women always put their hands on the men when they confront them on why they cheated, I get tired of seeing women slaping men, men should fight back. I do hate it that when your watching the show on WB the suspect idenity be withheld sometimes its not like their criminals. I watch the show every Saturday it's always in Dallas. What ever happen to Tommy Grand.",1129766400,3,448,4.22093023255814
2383592,5,B000AABLCQ,"It is so great that Cheaters is coming out into the DVD format. The 1st Cheaters on DVD had Tommy Habbeb (Tommy Grand on the show) showing what happened during the 1st and 2nd seasons of the show. At least it has the weekdays 1/2 hour episodes now airing in  which this case air sover on UPN. But anyway, get the best of Cheaters because it is a hit on TV and will stay on the show for years to come.",1129766400,2,400,3.9382716049382718
2383593,4,B000AABLCQ,The fourth video gave a recap of the most graphic scenes and episodes found in the other three. I would recommend it.,1392336000,,117,4.363636363636363
2383594,3,B000AABLCQ,The set was ok for the price.  It was uncensored but I thought you would still get to see faces that you couldn't see on TV.  I would buy it again though.  Good entertainment if you like this sort of thing.,1388102400,,206,3.975609756097561
2383595,5,B000AABLCQ,Great stuff! An absolute must have if you love the show.  Great price.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.,1385942400,,114,4.65
2383596,5,B000AABLCQ,"I love the show ""Cheaters"".  And getting to see it in all it's glory is icing on the cake.  From the back seat exploits to the shirt ripping cat fights.  It's all here to see.  Gotta get the next volume.",1379635200,,203,4.0
2383597,5,B000AABLCQ,I'm glad I bought it and plan to get more of this series seasons. People can be so hilarious in their real life.,1376524800,,112,3.9130434782608696
2383598,5,B000AABLCQ,no commercials good episodes sweet kisses and fierce fighting i bought this for my wife and we watched it while gettins stoned thx AMAZON,1360972800,,137,4.75
2383599,4,B000AABLCQ,The only thing that I did not like ABOUT this DVD was the fact that it had a lot of duplicate scenes that were on other Cheaters DVD. I would say about 90% of all were not fresh clips.,1314921600,3,184,3.7435897435897436
2383600,2,B000AABLCQ,Thought Rated X Unsensored,1301529600,,26,5.75
2383601,3,B000AABLCQ,"This show has a great concept... outing cheaters and humiliating them, however, the best parts are in the last few minutes of the segments. The set up is quite slow and boring, and I found myself fast forwarding qute a bit to the end. Also, the ""jerry springer"" type endings can be monotonous.",1251072000,,293,4.547169811320755
2383602,5,B000AABLCQ,"This is my favorite guily pleasure and it delivers in all its uncensored glory. This is a great study in sexual human behavior in infidelity and what people will say when they're busted. ""It's just a friend"" is the number one excuse after getting busted and just before the cheater is shown video proof of his/her misdeeds. I love the look on their faces. It's always the same deer caught in headlights look. For any ""Cheaters"" fan who wants to see what really happens(most of it as raw as they can get away with) and what's really bleeped out(some of it is clever profanities but most is everyone cussing at each other - which is still very funny) should run and purchase this volume and volume 2 which will be my next purchase.",1208563200,5,729,4.488721804511278
2383603,4,B000AABLCQ,very good show however it needed to have tommy habeeb's cheaters programs be uncensored as well.,1179187200,,96,5.0625
2383604,4,B000AABLCQ,"There's nothing like watching human nature in all it's baseness. In today's world

where we are oversaturated with reality tv, this show really sticks out. You can't beat

the reaction when someone is caught with their pants down. (Pun intended.) Having the show unedited

makes it worth the purchase. Maury and Jerry are passe next to Cheaters.",1163030400,3,345,5.017543859649122
2383605,2,B000AABLCQ,"My advice go rent it. I'm very disappointed with this dvd set. Yeah, you get to see full frontal nudity and penetration but then my interest started to go down. The remainder was just the cursing.  The last dvd is mostly repeats of Disk 1 and 3. The only thing different is Joey Grieco is hosting them. Cheaters chumped me. I'm so glad I renteD this.

SAVE YOUR MONEY!",1154390400,7,368,4.318840579710145
2383606,3,B000AABLCQ,"Essentially this is the tv version without bleeps or blurred out pictures. However there is a scene on the uncensored that still has blurred out picture. DVD #4 is essentially a replay of previous cases presented in the other DVDs. No special director's cut or extra footage. This DVD I consider to be  a waste of money has I didn't get any extra pictures or footage . I expected to have a directors cut or something special. Simply a compilation of same tv cases same presentation without bleeps and blurry pictures. If u need to purchase one I'm selling.

Final Ratings : not the best buy",1150329600,5,590,4.556603773584905
2383607,5,B000AABLCQ,"Cheaters no longer airs where I live and I am fuming.

It was takened off the air a few years back. That's why I'm

so thrilled it's available on dvd. For those who like reality tv or hate it this is a ""must see"".

Who knows, maybe you would see someone you know!",1137801600,2,263,3.9245283018867925
2383608,3,B000AABLCQ,"Wow, this is insane! Review after review imploring you to buy the DVD.

The show itself isn't that bad actually,  however,  whenever transfering tv shows that are based upon surprise and shock to dvd,  the whole essence of the show is lost.

After all,  how exiting is it watching the same partner get 'surprised' at being caught for the umpteenth time?

Anyway - for a change - don't bother buying the dvd - its a waste of cash.

Seriously.",1137628800,9,441,4.493670886075949
2383609,5,B000AABLCQ,"I don't know why people are saying these are fake reviews. For everyone who has seen cheaters you know how funny it is. Just hearing the way Joey talks cracks me up. From Joey's ""libations"" to the sound guy getting slammed on the hood of that car.

Anyway, what does it matter if some reviews are fake or not; you must have seen the show and like it if you are looking to buy it!",1132963200,6,379,4.053333333333334
2383610,1,B000AABLCQ,"Are you so desperate for business at Amazon that you have to write pathetic fake reviews of your own merchandise? Bad strategy... since I can't get an honest review here, I'll go elsewhere and probably end up buying it. Dummies.",1132358400,6,228,4.725
2383611,1,B000AABLCQ,Its soooo obvious that most of the reviews for this DVD are fake. I'm sure its quite entertaining and I like the show. but I am calling for a Boycot until the phony reviews are removed.,1132099200,5,185,4.166666666666667
2383612,5,B000AABLCQ,"Cheaters is without a doubt, the most underrated, underappreciated television show in the history of the medium. When it aired in Washington, DC, the station that carried it never advertised it and they changed it's timeslot every other week. You had to be an olympic athlete to keep up with it. Despite that, it remains one of the most entertaining shows, reality or otherwise.

Fans of the show will remember the insane, incredible cases preserved on this set. Who could forget Danielle, the girl who liked to be tied up while women dressed like construction workers had their way with her, all while ""God Bless America"" played in the background?

For the most part, we are treated to Joey Greco episodes. However, there are a few featuring original host Tommy Grand. Both are good hosts but for vastly different reasons.

2383613,5,B000AABLCQ,"My brother got me the ""Best of Cheaters"" DVD for my birthday because he knows I love reality shows and we watch it all the time together. I like the anticipation of the show to see what will happen at the end with the people in the relationship because its always something good, never a dull moment, especially with this dvd! If you haven't bought it yet, what are you waiting for?! Its so funny!",1130976000,2,397,4.306666666666667
2383614,5,B000AABLCQ,"If you think the show is the greatest thing ever, wait until you see the dvd! Its awesome and hilarious. I love the confronting part. There are some classic moments right there. My roomates and I watch it all the time. Man, did any of you see the episode where the host got stabbed on national television!? That was insane! There are some crazy people on that show, which makes me want to keep watching to see other outcomes of the show!",1130976000,2,437,4.341463414634147
2383615,5,B000AABLCQ,I'm so glad that the Best of Cheaters DVD came out. And the fact that it is uncensored is even better! Cheaters is one of my favorite reality shows so I had to buy it right away when I heard of it. The dvd contains priceless moments of the people on the show when they confront their loved ones. I can't even pick a favorite they are all great in their own way haha. A must have!,1130976000,3,379,3.935064935064935
2383616,5,B000AABLCQ,"The Best of Cheaters DVD has to be one of the most entertaining dvds I own. I love this show! Each of the different casted people on the show are different from the next, bringing in a different outcome of the show each time. You never know how people will react to situations, which keeps you wanting more. The dvd has some great footage for peoples amusement to check out. Its a must have for anyone who has or even hasn't seen the show. You won't be disappointed.",1130976000,,466,4.306818181818182
2383617,3,B000AABLCQ,"For the love of god, do you think Amazon shoppers were born yesterday?  Ignore all these fake reviews ...

Yes, ""Cheaters"" is the most lurid show not on HBO.  But give it credit: Before reality TV got huge, it took reality TV right to the edge.  From the time I saw it at a trade show in 2000, I knew it was going to be huge.  But I thought it'd be a flash in the pan ... the surprise is that it's held on in reruns for so long.",1130976000,13,428,3.764044943820225
2383618,5,B000AABLCQ,"I am a huge fan of reality tv but Cheaters is by far my favorite show but of its' intriguing and dramatic endings each episode.  I also love it because each episode is a new couple, a new situation and a new ending.  I just picked up the dvd set the other day and I love that it has the best episodes of the season.  The producers clearly wanted to get the best representation on the dvd set.  I also enjoyed the footage on the dvd that they can't show you on tv,  I mean when the host gets stabbed, what reality show gets better than that?",1130889600,,540,4.009345794392523

Since buying the set I haven't been able to  stop playing those ugly and gruesome confrontations, I even got my sister into Cheaters, now we can both watch all of the episodes together!",1130889600,,410,4.189873417721519

The suspense and anticipation of the dreaded confrontation is the best part of the show, and since it usually comes on late at night I always miss some great episodes.  Finally, a dvd set where I can watch all of the best footage even with some extras that they don't show you on tv.  It's reality tv, how can it ever get better than that?",1130889600,2,416,4.253164556962025

I can't help but be amused by the situations taking place between the couples. I always like seeing the different ways people go crazy towards the end of the show when they come face to face with the person they are in a relationship with.
