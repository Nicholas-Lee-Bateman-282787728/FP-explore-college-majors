8442770,5,B004V2FU26,Played by talented Actors like Dev Anand especially. I have known Simmi for a long time to be successful as the rest of the other two. It will be quite a cliff hanger with the happy ending for some as we cannot please all at the same time. But Mother Nature always has a surprise for others.,1476489600,,291,4.12280701754386
8442771,1,B004V2FU26,"B e w a r e . the shemaroo DVD (whose screenshot of the cover is featured here on the product page) does not have the . c o m p l e t e . film!

Shemaroo has released an incomplete version of the film ""Teen Devian"" on DVD. The climax is missing a very important sequence! In the original and complete film, a major part of the climax is in colour though the rest of the film is in black-and-white. During this sequence, the hero arrives at the 'solution' that's been evading him. This entire sequence, missing from the Shemaroo DVD, simply kills the story. Very unfortunate. Shame on Shemaroo. Shame-a-roo!

4 stars for the film. 1 star for the Shame-a-roo DVD.",1438128000,,661,4.32258064516129
8442772,4,B004V2FU26,"I saw Teen Devian in 1993 telecasted in Doordarshan on a Friday night, and could scarcely believe that such a remarkable film was ever made in Bollywood. It was mind blowing - a film with a ""modern"" storyline, superb music, three lovely ladies and my fave superstar Dev Anand. In this unusual storyline, Dev falls in love with three women - the simple Nanda, the ravishing Kalpana and the sophisticated Simi. They too are enamored with him and want to marry him. This puts Dev in a dilemma (which is the crux of the storyline)- whom to marry?. He consults a hypnotist who asks Dev to gaze into a crystal ball. Dev finds the answer and marries Nanda. Beautifully directed (most probably by Dev saheb himself & not by Amarjeet the official director) the B&W classic has evergreen music - some of SD Burman's (helped generously by RD Burman) best compositions. ""Uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth"" is the probably the most sexiest song ever composed in Hindi films. Credit should also be given to Majrooh Sultanpuri for penning the memorable lyrics Teen Devian is a breezy musical which completely suited the style of Dev Anand and he did full justice to the role. Unfortunately Teen Devian has never received the recognition & popularity it richly deserves.",1306281600,,1250,4.764976958525345
