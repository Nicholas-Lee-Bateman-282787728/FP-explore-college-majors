6470721,5,B00L5QX0S2,"This was by far the funniest, smartest new show of the year, giving anyone even slightly interested in the rapidly evolving technology that is rewriting social base codes an insider's view of ground zero for the IT explosion. Mike Judge, the man behind King of the Hill, Beavis and Butthead, and the film Office Space, which was his first 'at bat' for the Silicon Valley (or somewhere a lot like it) experience, once again draws on his own history in the computer industry, updated to encompass the strange transformation that has taken hold of the insular, asocial, and still overwhelmingly male community. Judge's unfailing eye for absurdity and hypocrisy makes the Facebook-Apple-Google era of Silicon Valley an easy target. The quasi-Hippie rhetoric about 'making the world a better place' that every young developer regurgitates is thanks to Steve Jobs; and like Steve Jobs, none of these kids give a crap about making the world a better place, unless it's 'World of Warcraft'.

The story revolves around Richard, played by Thomas Middleditch, who is just one of several young programmers looking to get rich while sharing a modest bungalow owned by an older programmer, who sold one of his many bad ideas for enough money to buy property in one of the most seller-friendly/buyer-desperate zip codes in the US. While Richard works at Hooli, a company that in a lot of ways resembles Apple, he and his fellow tenants (who can't afford to rent anywhere else), are all part of landlord Erlich Bachman's 'business incubator', doling out questionable wisdom and demanding 10% ownership of any of the various apps each one is personally creating.

Richard is developing an app that Erlich and his pals think is useless, a music-based program that lets musicians upload their songs and make sure they're not infringing on another musicians' copyright -- something no one involved in song-writing gives a s*** about anymore. When word leaks out that the data compression algorithm his app 'Pied Piper' is using is the most efficient yet devised, Richard is suddenly in a strange bidding war, with Hooli's Jobs-like CEO Gavin Belson offering to buy him out for 10 million dollars, while via cell-phone, Belson's arch-rival and fellow billionaire, Peter Gregory -- a college-hating weirdo genius -- offers Richard 200 000 dollars for 5% ownership of the company. A shell-shocked Richard has to choose immediately between a large pay-off that might be a tiny fraction of his creation's true worth, and making an enemy of his former boss while trying to turn his algorithm into a fully-functioning product that will survive the merciless competition long enough to reap the theoretical windfall.

Obviously, he chooses to do things the hard way, and soon Erlich (played to hilarious perfection by T.J. Miller) and the other residents of the incubator are recruited by 'Pied Piper'. The problems that assail them at every step are both funny and instructive. With the exception of Erlich, the personalities that make up most of the programming population are not leaders. The stereotypical uncoordinated Asperger-kid who is a math-genius, and a computer genius, but can barely pass Grade 10 English Lit (let alone carry on a natural conversation with a girl he's attracted to) -- those are the kids who drop out of college and move to Silicon Valley. Stereotypes exist for a reason, but there are exceptions, such as the devil-worshiping Guilfoyle, the only one of the group with a girlfriend, and of course Erlich, who sees himself as Richard's Steve Jobs-type frontman, employing his delusional self-confidence with something like brute force.

There are many lol moments in this season, a short, 8-episode season, and the cast is incredible. Sadly, Christopher Evans Welch, who played Peter Gregory with an inspired strangeness and a gift for idiosyncratic tics, died of lung cancer after filming episode five. He was not replaced for the final three episodes, and fortunately, his loss did not irreparably disrupt production (I didn't hear of his passing until after I had watched the first season; the story doesn't feel forced due to his absence, because he was playing the role of the ultimate misanthropic hermit plutocrat, with plans to escape to a robot-island). But the writing is the true star on Silicon Valley. Judge has put together a writer's room that is as good as it gets, and they provide an amazing cast made up of mostly comedic actors the material they need to make it their own; for a show about socially awkward nerds, it's amazing just how likable and yes, even charismatic, these characters/actors are. HBO has renewed Silicon Valley for a second season, praise Satan.",1405641600,31,4687,5.059508408796895

6470742,5,B00L5QX0S2,"Somehow, I totally missed this show for the last couple of years. Luckily, I found it on HBO GO this week. I'm at the end of Season Three after binging for a couple of days. I actually started it because of the connection with Mike Judge. I'm totally hooked.

This show is smart, snarky, and pokes fun at all the pretensions and self grandeur of both the established giants and kitchen start ups infesting Silicone Valley. At the same time this show gives a glimpse behind the scenes of the race for the next most popular app or user program. I fully respect the specific sort of intelligence that enables the coders to create useful things out of thin air - however, I have to wonder if there shouldn't be adult supervision for most of the culture. These kids just have no clue how the tangible world that the rest of live in actually works and that definitely explains some of the ridiculously over complicated software foisted on us. BTW - those click farms in India are real. . I love the show and will keep watching it.",1512777600,,1024,4.446808510638298

6470875,5,B00L5QX0S2,"Mike Judge has always been a very reliable talent when it comes to satirizing the workplace, but I have never really been a fan of his stuff. This, however, takes workplace satire to a brand new level, and setting it in what feels like the black box of the tech sector really gives it that ""insider baseball"" feel that makes this show really unique. It's definitely not laugh out loud comedy, at least not regularly, but the humor is almost always sharp and intelligent, and most of the characters are pretty endearing despite being total jerks to each other. It's good value for a great season, and a plus for this set is that you also get Digital HD copies (forward thinking and appropriate for a show like this!), so I've truly never really played the Blu-ray discs but I've had a great time watching it on my Apple TV.",1482192000,,822,4.486666666666666

6470944,3,B00L5QX0S2,"As someone who lives here, I find the real Silicon Valley has been steadily dissipated from an actual technical area for people in the physical sciences, to one dominated by programmers and pill-pushers, and the bankers who fund them; and so we have a show that glorifies what is actually an area now dominated by marketing gimmicks more than genuine technical break-through's.

The show ""Silicon Valley"" actually glosses over much of this seedy reality by pretending that there can be a start-up based on some profound data ""compression scheme"" that compresses both random data and the normal compression-amenable media.

Sorry - but, as wonderful as it sounds, this is a completely non-sensical and illogical technical premise.

In actuality, most programming start-ups in ""Silicon Valley"" today are marketing accomplishiments in e-business, not spectacular technical feats like the impossibly ambitious ""invention"" in this show.

Tech co's are notoriously male-dominated, however the dearth of women roles on this show contributes to the industry's image an one that excludes half the population. This is simply not the case, though I agree there's plenty of room for improvement. The collaboration between male and female scientists and engineers has a lot of dramatic and comedic potential! Too bad the show's creators (men!!) declined to show both sexes working side by side instead of the tired ""old boy"" cliche. Where're Sheryl Sanberg, Melissa Meyers and other strong female exec's? The oversight is embarrassing to me, and I'm a baby boomer.

6470971,5,B00L5QX0S2,"First, I don't even remember how I got into watching this show, even though it was about a week ago that I saw the first episode. I'm done with season 3 which happened to air a couple of days ago and I cannot wait for season 4. HBO hits another homerun with this show. Having HBO Go is worth the money to be able to watch and invest into shows like this.

I'm not writing a huge review because many people before me have more detailed reviews. In a nut shell, it's a show about a startup company going through trials and tribulations. That's it. No corny side love stories, no extra curricular activities that take away from the show's greatness, and best of all no filter. Plenty of raunchiness you would expect from an HBO show, but it's not too bad if you can handle adult language.

The cast is awesome, although I have a couple of issues. First being, the main character, Richard, is someone I could easily forget if he were replaced with someone else. I don't like how he acts, literally and figuratively. The token girl of the show, Monica, is also easily forgettable and she just seemed like she was put in there just to have a cute girl on the show, but thankfully she's not in every episode/scene. That's me nitpicking. Everyone else is awesome. I don't want to ruin the surprises, but you will not be disappointed with the cast of characters and their performances.

As far as the script goes, it helps to have a little computer knowledge but absolutely not necessary. If there's something you don't understand, pause it and hooli it. There's one episode I did not like and it was in season 3, but 27 out of 28 episodes that are awesome is definitely worth my time in watching this show. With so much to choose from it's hard to find a show you can connect with and this definitely connects with me.

I honestly think they could have ended the show in season 3, and I think they did, as they had an out to do so, but it seems there will be a season 4 but I haven't checked before writing this review.

In short, stop reading reviews and just watch the first couple of episodes.",1467072000,,2088,4.3573264781491

And the actor playing Peter Gregory (Christopher Evan Welch) is TERRIFYING in his oddness.

Being a Hollywood brat and a computer nerd since high school, and finally moving to ""just over the hill from SV"" I like to think that I have a solid grasp on how great this show is. It is like Betas (the failed Amazon show) but cooler, grittier, and darker. The main character is super annoying, but that is just acting brilliance. Great characters, great plot lines. It almost feels like a reality show. Very funny, crude, asinine, and spot-on ""what it is like to live in a start-up in a boomtown."" The ""extra characters"" (the Silicon Valley execs that come and go in this show) are so real I could almost name the people they were inspired by. This show is television done right. It feels enough like reality to be believable, but scripted enough to be highly entertaining.

Okay, so what is this show about? It is about a start-up, and all of the hell that entails. It is set in Silicon Valley, and so we have a huge cast of SV types that serve as the backdrop for our five main characters. It is a nice blend of episodic storyline meets soap-opera. There are entire seasons of continuity and cross-season continuity, but also ""flavor of the week"" storylines. Unlike Betas, this is not at all camp; it is brutal and hilarious. I have watched the first two seasons and I can't wait to see how this expands. If you watch the first three episodes you will have a fell of the series (tone and pace). The humor only gets better over time by the way, and you may end up liking characters later in the series you hate at first.",1454803200,,1547,4.368055555555555

Kudos for making the illegal alien (SPOILER ALERT) a white Canadian rather than the legal Pakistani immigrant. I was rolling on the floor after Dinesh nearly blew a gasket thinking he was the one accused of being illegal. Bonus points to the driverless car scene which is beyond hilarious and so spot-on. The ending of that episode was a dark comic delight.

The whole thing seems so spot on about how we imagine Silicon Valley to be. Also, the two power brokers in the series are written as over-the-top that they could go beyond parody but the fact they don't is a credit to the two actors playing the super eccentric venture capitalist Peter ""get me one of everything from this Burger King"" Gregory (Christopher Evan Welch) and the nutso power hungry tech exec Donald ""Jared"" Dunn (Zach Woods).

All bad jokes above aside.... This show is brilliant. With each episode, you will become more and more invested in each character and the company that they are trying to build.

There are some truly wonderful performances here from the actors who play Erlich, Richard, Peter Gregory, Gilfoyle and more. Richard is a great programmer, but throws up every time he gets nervous. Erlich has no programming skills but is a great presenter of information (as well as a great seducer of wives and girlfriends). This guy is hysterical.

I hate watching TV shows or movies that have developers and I just laugh/get annoyed with how everything they are saying is just flat out wrong.

6471200,4,B00L5QX0S2,"""Silicon Valley"" is a very funny show, with a fresh story line and cast of characters. Though ""Big Bang Theory"" has attempted to make nerds ""cool again"" for a few years now, I think ""Silicon Valley"" actually succeeds. Not only is the show very relevant to the current times of the booming tech industry, but the characters portrayed are the people we have seen in the tech media, some of who have become celebrities. The show dives into the lives of these soon-to-be-tech-millionaires and shows how modest the beginnings really are for these companies.  You get to watch the coder create something of value, turn it into a company, assemble his team, acquire funding, and struggle the many pitfalls of the industry. If you ever wanted to know how your favorite app came into existence, this show is a pretty good representation.  On top of the story, the humor is on point. Though lots of the jokes are sort of nerd and tech  insider things, the show does a great job of making everything relateable for a general audience.  If nothing else, TJ Miller will have you laughing out loud more than once.  Overall, a good watch with some real education value.",1444608000,2,1154,4.693069306930693

6471339,5,B00L5QX0S2,"Silicon Valley's first season was classic Mike Judge. He perfectly balanced hilarious low-brow humor (think South Park) with highlighting the absurdity of the Valley culture and the people who shape it. The story was tight and fast moving. One episode has an arc centered around sesame seeds that brilliantly, and humorously, illustrates how the minds of some geniuses work. The effort to find a company logo results in an episode I had to pause frequently because I was laughing so hard I was tearing up! The final episode of season 1 is an excellent culmination of the story capped off by a classic discussion regarding ""optimal tip-to-tip efficiency"" that again had me tearing up. This is as funny as anything the South Park guys have done.

The second season is almost finished, and it starts off OK, but a little off. Unfortunately Christopher Evan Welch, who plays the main characters' benefactor and main investor, died between seasons so I'm sure the story had to be reworked. The resulting season has been a disappointment. Where this show masterfully mixed crude humor with a fair knowledge of web and software development tech, not to mention Silicon Valley in general, they now have manufactured situations where the audience gets to see how inept the main characters can be despite their apparent expert skills. We see the former adviser to a billionaire CEO become an MBA punchline to old and tired jokes. The main investor is replaced by an over-the-top past his prime billionaire played as well a possible by Chris Diamantopoulos. Unfortunately, the character is little more than a walking plot device - and a bad one at that (""Oops, I set my bottle on your keyboard and deleted something important."" They really went there). Watching him stumble through the season leaves me wondering how he managed to keep any of his money for as long as 5-years. Finally, the plot holes get bigger and bigger as the season progresses. They have one episode left and the cliffhanger from the previous episode is so obviously not the problem they're making it out to be. At least not to anyone who remembers how season 1 ended.

This show has excellent comedic talent. It just seems like they've forgotten how best to use it. They were great in the first season. The second season seems like it was mostly phoned in.",1433808000,,2317,4.848484848484849

6471341,5,B00L5QX0S2,"We purchased this because we HAD to hear the commentary of Mike Judge.  And then we started watching the episodes with commentary, it was EVERYONE that was hilarious!  The show features stand up comics, so listening to every episode is like a being at a standup show ... or an improv show, since there are so many people speaking.  We haven't even watched the episodes yet, just the commentary.  But we will definitely watch the episodes (probably more than once).  It's definitely worth the purchase!!!

6471388,5,B00L5QX0S2,"Several months ago I discovered Betas, Amazon's original content series and was quickly drawn in to the story, characters, and theme.  After binge watching the show and completing all episodes within several days I was disappointed when I discovered that the series was canceled.  After showing several episodes to some friends one mentioned how it was very similar to Silicon Valley (I don't have cable so I don't keep up with newer HBO content as a general rule).  Naturally I decided to check it out and I have not been disappointed.

There are many obvious differences between the two shows, but there are also more similarities than I am willing to spend time to list.  It seems that Silicon Valley will be more than sufficient to fill the void for me left by the cancellation of Betas.  Silicon Valley is fast paced, witty, funny, and the characters have a lot of depth.  As many other reviewers have branded themselves, I am also on the software side of the tech industry so I can tag nearly all characters in this series to somebody I know personally.  Mike Judge has found another winning formula which I hope will remain interesting and relevant for many episodes and years to come.

6471401,5,B00L5QX0S2,"WHERE WOULD we be without our nerds? Still chipping away at walls in the Stone Age and communicating with landlines no doubt.

We've been laughing at their exploits  creating amazing tech, lurching into social situations  on CBSs Big Bang Theory for nine seasons. (Its been that long?) Now HBO stirs the pot with an eight-episode debut about another group, who stumble into the attention of mega-billion power nerds Gavin Belson (Matt Ross) and Peter Gregory (Christopher Evan Welch). Sadly, Welch passed away during filming from lung cancer. A veteran of shows like The Practice, Law & Order: Criminal Intent and Special Victims Unit, don't miss his final performance.

Peter and Gavin began as friends, working together until a seismic rift blew them apart. They battle for the algorithm created by Richard Hendricks, who lives with his pack in the Silicon Valley suburbs. Played by Thomas Middleditch and bearing a profound resemblance to a young Hugh Grant, Richard must choose between accepting a multi-million dollar payoff and selling his discovery or accepting financing to develop it himself.

You know hes going to pick Option B  development  or Silicon Valley would be a two-episode series. The first season covers how Richard gets his business underway, with the help of nerd-bean counter Jared (Zach Woods, The Office). The show entertains in a cagey, slow-burn way until we hit uncontrollable laughs, where brainy humor gives way to slapstick. Middleditch, Woods and co-stars T.J. Miller, Martin Starr and Kumail Nanjiani have experience in comedy and improv as exposed in the making-of feature. Miller is also a voice actor on DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon films and Disneys Big Hero 6.

Making Silicon Valley introduces creator/executive producer Mike Judge, who once worked and lived in Silicon Valley, the basis of his inspiration. The leads analyze their characters. Millers Erlich sold his company for a few million, buying a house he shares with other nerds for 10% of their earnings. (Theres a tour in The Hacker Hostel featurette.) Erlich is no smooth operator; hes got an ego that hurls him into any and every fray. Starrs Gilfoyle is a Satanist. Basically because he likes to party and have fun. Sin is a thing of beauty, Starr says. (His group is amazingly, hilariously banal.) Gilfoyles rival Dinesh (Nanjiani) slips into best friend category. Think of these two as the dark side of Big Bangs Wolowitz and Koothrappali. Amanda Crew plays Monica, Peters assistant and handler, representing the 2% of women in the tech world, Judge says.

In real life, they're all really similar to the characters they play, Middleditch says.

TechCrunch: Disrupt shows how the series was able to use the real mega-conference where startup companies showcase their ideas, hoping for funding. An episode gives us HumanHeater, where microwave technology is used to keep people warm. Self Surgeon is just what it sounds like. Both are dangerous; both may be genuine.

Each episode has a commentary featuring Judge and producer Alec Berg (both write for and direct Silicon Valley). Theyre sometimes joined by the cast. Production info blends with anecdotes. All note how real geeks quickly point out possible inaccuracies and solutions through Twitter. It is both curse and blessing.

This is an HBO production, so you can bet your gigabytes the 1080p AVC/MPEG-4 picture and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack are excellent.

Silicon Valley keeps us laughing at the nerds, but theres no doubt whos in charge or where the money goes. (Last laugh, right? The one that counts.)   Kay Reynolds",1429574400,,3600,5.12991452991453

6471480,4,B00L5QX0S2,"You hear about success stories all the time. Some random nerd comes up with a brilliant social media site, or service, or application, and soon he's so rich that every night he falls asleep in a hot tub fall of thousand-dollar bills and naked supermodels.

But it's not quite as easy as the success stories make it seem. ""Silicon Valley: Season 1"" explores the steps between ""A: Come up with cool idea"" and ""Z: PROFIT!!!!!!!!,"" following a gang of oddball computer nerds who may have the Next Big Thing... but have to deal with eccentric billionaires, rivals, obscene murals and Adderall-addled children along the way. Despite the looming threat of failure, this weird, foul-mouthed little comedy careens wildly through the planning stages of a world-changing new project.

By day, mild-mannered Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch) is a low-ranking code monkey at the megalithic company Hooli. But when he shows someone else his pet project, a music app called Pied Piper, Hooli discovers an algorithm that allows perfect searchable file compression. Hooli CEO Gavin Belson (Matt Ross) offers him a flat $10 million for the algorithm... but Richard shocks him by instead taking an offer from the eccentric billionaire Peter Gregory (Christopher Evan Welch), which may allow him to form his own company.

So Richard hires the wacky guys in the start-up ""incubator"" to help him turn Pied Piper into a viable product, including egotistical Erlich Bachman (T.J. Miller), stoner Satanist Gilfoyle (Martin Starr), put-upon Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani), and Belson's earnest ex-PA Jared (Zach Woods). His buddy Big Head (Josh Brener) ends up working for Hooli... or rather, NOT working.

But it's a lot more complicated and difficult than he expected -- not only do they have to iron out all the problems in the program, but they have to get the rights to the Pied Piper name, form a real business plan, and create a logo. What they actually get is an obscene mural, an Adderall-addled tween who wrecks the project, drunken appointments and money troubles. Worse: they have to get Pied Piper in working order by the time of TechCrunch Startup Battlefield. Even worse: Belson has been reverse-engineering the Pied Piper algorithm to create a sleeker, more profitable version of the same program.

At times, ""Silicon Valley: Season 1"" can be kind of heavy of the tech-jargon. I don't really know what makes computers work internally, and I don't really understand software design. So whenever the characters lapsed into technobabble, I lapsed into a stupor. That is the main problem with this entire season, which is otherwise gutsplittingly funny -- lots of raunchy humor (the mural on the garage door), social disasters and weird problems (Richard has to bribe neighborhood kids for Adderall).

Mike Judge has to be given credit: there is a genuine sense of suspense that hangs over this story. Richard is constantly reminded that not only are they the David to Hooli's Goliath, but that most start-up ideas are either not viable (a parking lot app that reminds you where you parked), or will end in failure because of business reasons. And in the final few episodes, it seems like Hooli is about to crush the less polished, less moneyed Pied Piper.

And yet somehow it's still incredibly funny. Every episode is packed with raunchy, F-bomb-riddled dialogue (the mathematical discussion about the fastest way to masturbate the audience), weird subplots (Ehrlich goes on a psychedelic spirit quest in a gas station bathroom) and plenty of glorious misunderstandings (Gilfoyle's suggestion that Dinesh sleep with his girlfriend). And the clever satire of major Internet companies and the billionaires who run them is absolutely hysterical (""If we can make your audio and video files smaller, we can make cancer smaller. And hunger. And... AIDS"").

Middleditch is the least charismatic actor in this, but it may be intentional -- Richard is brilliant but also kind of nondescript, weak and easily swayed, and it's only in the final episodes that he finally grows a spine and learns to shine. Miller is glorious as a manipulative jerk who does have an actual soft spot for the guys in his incubator, and is willing to get beaten up for the sake of Pied Piper. Starr, Nanjiani and Woods are all fun, colorful spots in the cast, each bringing a glorious vibe all their own... and the only dull spot is Amanda Crew as the token Smurfette, who seems to exist mainly as a love interest for Richard.

""Silicon Valley: Season 1"" is a natural outgrowth of Judge's classic ""Office Space"" -- only now the worker drones have a chance to be queen... well, king bees. Gloriously wild, funny and slightly hampered by technobabble.",1421884800,,4704,5.028241335044929

I am almost certain (based on a number of favorable factors) that a minimum of 5 seasons of Silicon Valley will be produced, so it is worth your time to become invested in these characters. By the end of the season, the Pied Piper team are still living together in Erlich's incubator and have only surmounted the first of many hurdles; it will be a long while before these characters are living in wealth and forced to cope with power struggles that will inevitably be the cause of much hilarity. Already though we can see that the very cute Monica (Amanda Crew) will become the love interest of the main protagonist, Richard. Silicon Valley is a comedy of substance (one wouldn't expect less from HBO).

My only complaint about the show: 8 episodes does not a season make.

T.J Miller is amazing as usual. Thomas Middleditch did an awesome performance in his more serious role here. Kumail (not even going to attempt last name) was so great and funny. He really nailed it. So happy with every episode. Its Hilarious. BUY.,1420416000,5,521,4.612903225806452

6471502,5,B00L5QX0S2,"At first glance Silicon Valley seemed a little off to me, but I stuck with it and by the end of the first season this show really grew on me.  The humor in Silicon Valley isn't for everyone and is a bit dry and awkward most of the times, which I love, but not everyone likes that kind of humor.  That being said it's also slightly geared towards those with interests in technology and geeky things in general, which is probably why I like this show the most.  The bottom line is that I highly recommend Silicon Valley if you like dry and awkward humor, but if not this show might not be for you, but even if you don't this show might be the exception.  I'm also looking forward to the blu-ray, because it has some good special features on it.

Hey, this show is different.  Most importantly, it's pretty funny.  Non-stop hilarity?  No.  But it does have its own comedic charm and timing that resembles a mix of The Office, The League, Californication, and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

Mike Judge has nailed the shadow to the person here in a way that is more direct than just about anything I've seen. The characters ring true, the settings are completely recognizable and the plots are not afraid to steer directly in to territory that fulminates with political incorrectness and the actual verities of life. In other words, great storytelling.",1411862400,5,667,5.3619047619047615

The last episode in season one I was watching in the gym on the treadmill and I actually had to stop and leave the gym floor because I was laughing so hard it was embarassing.  I cannot wait until more of this series is available. One thing I particularly liked was that all the characters were somewhat sterotypical of geeks, but with a great twist to make them all seem new and fresh.  Plus, I liked that the lead character who was the creator of their product, always seemed to want to do the right thing for his friends.  No greed or backstabbing here....at least in the first season! If you like this, look up ""The IT Crowd"" a British series which is also hysterical. I live in a family of computer professionals, so I always laugh because I either see a husband or son in something that is going on.",1410998400,,834,4.326923076923077

6471591,5,B00L5QX0S2,"Mike Judge fans rejoice - he's applied his wry social outlook to the tech arena with the same success as Idiocracy and Office Space but this time with an even more authentic setup. For anyone who's ever worked in tech companies, Silicon Valley lampoons the personalities, lifestyles and see-saw emotions that punctuate lives in the digital gold rush. It ruthlessly skewers the holier-than-thou sentiments, the business sharks that swim in the waters, and paints the industry as the Hollywood of tech, where you're either a billionaire or you're broke.

Clearly written by people who have witnessed the bizarrely of tech culture from the inside, Silicon Valley never substitutes preaching for comedy, and treads the fine line between dark sarcasm and cynicism that keeps the episodes buoyant. If Amazon's Betas was an optimistic but naive look at tech, Silicon Valley blows that out of the water with a much funnier, dark, wittier and frankly more believable peek into the same universe. It's great to see Mike Judge doing what he does best.",1408838400,3,1040,5.081871345029239

Far from glorifying SV, it takes aim, with razor like precision, at  the cultural dishonesty and unbridled greed  of Silicon Valley. At the same time, the show has us liking and rooting for the protagonists as the only 'sane' ones.(Kinda like Office Space!).
