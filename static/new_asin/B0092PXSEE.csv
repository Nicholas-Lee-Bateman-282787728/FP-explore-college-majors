This item viewed very well on a regular blu ray, no need for 3D player but also displayed awesome on my Sony 3D player! The movie also allows you to choose a setting to watch it without commentary..... Which makes a great screen saver. Well, imagine a 55-60 inch TV with excellent pictures/movies about coral reefs, fish wildlife, beautiful  scenes and music! So I've used this movie when showing a listing.

5243356,4,B0092PXSEE,"I think people who are passionate about diving like myself will enjoy this Blu-Ray.  The 3D is nothing spectacular, in fact there are only a few scenes where the 3D really stands out. With more lighting the 3D probably would have been a lot better. I've been into diving photography for several years and I feel they did not use enough lighting to make this video. One other thing that disappointed me was the locations they shot in.  Only the close up shots have the proper lighting to see the vibrant colors underwater. In my diving adventures around the world I always ask veteran divers where is the best diving they ever did, and the most common answer I hear is the Red Sea Egypt. There were only a few sea creatures in this DVD that I found different from other places I've dove and I guess I was expecting a lot more. Which leads me to believe they did not choose good dive sites for this video.

None the less I still enjoyed the video :)",1388707200,,947,4.338983050847458

5243362,1,B0092PXSEE,"I cannot believe this film is from the Peter Lord, maybe just someone else with the same name!
Unfortunately this film is not even worth the $10 cost.

While it is filmed using 3D technology the overall quality is amateur at best, such as:
No post color correction, so the images are mostly green and lack the true colors of the reef.
Improper or no color filters were used so the color spectrum is false, flat and lackluster.
When used, video lights are too close to the lens resulting in excessive and distracting backscatter.
The editing is silly, the same shots are repeated, scenes jump back and forth with little or no continuity to the script.
The script is like a student reading from a first year book on ichthyology.

The 3D effect is good BUT the video quality is poor; just like a regular DVD quality. In fact, I have seen some DVD with video quality better than this Blu-Ray title. Nothing on the front or back insert that says 'high definition video' but there is a logo for DTS-HD (high definition AUDIO). Disappointing video quality.

Because, I do respect nature and animals, I rate with 3 stars but in terms of the film itself and narration, let me tell you that is not very professional. It is a Little bit boring, the 3d efects are good, may be not super high quality but it is ok. If you watch other films like imax you can see the difference in terms of production.  The film nees more work to do before presenting on a Blu-ray. People, we are talking about something that it is so important, life in the ocean not toys. So, why you do not try harder to present something a Little bit more profesional, I mean, 3d efects are fine, but nature is so important, that means you do not have to try to make animals act like they need.  ocean creatures are so perfect, they not need a special work, just let them to act natrually.",1369267200,,871,4.087719298245614

But it is not an iMax move, so it lacks a bit in quality.  There are some video parts where the scenery is a bit blurry. It looks like something may have been left on the lens before they took the movie segments. But over all a nice movie worth to see and worth the money.",1367193600,,417,3.9058823529411764
5243372,3,B0092PXSEE,"Overall this movie isn't as bad as some of the reviews make it out to be. Yes, the narrator isn't very good and she pronounces ""school"" funny, but you can shut that off and just watch the film with the background music playing. There are many nice 3d shots in the film, some however are plagued with bad lighting or a smudge on the lens, and sometimes the image is a little out of focus. For the money this isn't a bad purchase, but for me, it's a movie I will only watch once.",1367193600,,477,4.085106382978723

5243378,1,B0092PXSEE,"Hi There--I just recently had a chance to play this blu-ray entitled Adventure Coral Reef 3D (Emphasis on the 3D) I bought this for the 3D effects. Long story short I have two blu-ray players both Oppo's one is a 3D player the other is just blu-ray. When I put the video in my 3D player everything looked fine because my Vizio 3D t.v came up with the message asking me if I wanted to switch to the 3D setting, which I did and nothing happened. No menu picture came up. No picture at all. I tried at least five times and got the same response every time. Then for the heck of it I put it in my regular blu-ray player and VOILA!! it played normally in 2D. Before submitting my disappointing experience with your video I put on another 3D movie just to make sure the problem wasn't the player and or my t.v, it's not either one. I have on The Pirates in 3D and it's playing normally. I am not going to send this back because it does play in my other machine, but I won't be buying any more universal play videos.

5243379,4,B0092PXSEE,"As a documentary, did good job of showing all the kinds of marine life at coral reef. Appreciated giving the names of everything plus a little added info at times. Other movies about coral reefs like IMAX Under The Sea and IMAX Ocean Wonderland only identified mostly larger marine life. Adventure Coral Reef lacked the polished narration of IMAX series however, and lacked the entertainment type narration. Close-ups of marine life was outstanding with lots of pop-out of screen sequences. At times water was a little murky, but added to 3D effect. Ocean Wonderland was much clearer water and a little better photo quality. Adventure Coral Reef 3D picture quality about same as Under The Sea. Music in Adventure Coral Reef was not intrusive which was a little loud at times in Ocean Wonderland.  Overall a good documentary but lacking much narration entertainment value.",1365206400,2,871,5.048611111111111
5243380,4,B0092PXSEE,"But not overly interesting.  We love watching 3-D, especially where marine life is involved.  We found this movie to be very slow and was mostly small fish.  We kept waiting for big fish and maybe a shark or two, but there were only dolphins at the end of the movie.  There was also very little about Egypt or the pyramids.  I almost gave it only a 3-star rating, but for the price, it's not bad.  And it is 3-D.  :)",1365120000,2,416,4.125

5243383,3,B0092PXSEE,"Good picture and 3D quality but not spectacular.  Much of the reefs look like they are environmentally stressed. The price was right.  But I shouldn't be too critical, there's not that much 3D available, something is better than nothing.",1364515200,,237,5.051282051282051
5243384,3,B0092PXSEE,"Probably not filmed with the best 3D equipment. Didn't pop out of the screen as I expected. The narration is not very pleasant since the voice is too high pitched. Oprah, Morgan freeman, David Attenborough have a smooth voice that makes the narration almost a background noise.

5243387,3,B0092PXSEE,"First off, Some complained it wasn't available in 2D, but all you have to do for 2D is put it in a regular BluRay player and it starts playing!  If you only have a BR 3D player the video doesn't seem to have a 2D option button.  Like some reviewers, I don't understand the one- and two-star reviews.  I'm neither a diver nor an underwater photographer, but I found the colors to be what I think would be seen under seawater, which isn't always clear.  Although this Under the Sea of Egypt video doesn't have excellent 3D (no in-your-face shots but the turtle toward the end was close), I found the 3D and color to be very good and fairly consistent throughout the video. I will watch this again, and think my grandchildren will enjoy it.  I do have to say I found the narrater annoying, but she can be turned off.  Heck, it was only a little over $10 for 50 minutes, folks (not the 39 to 40 minutes you usually get with much more expensive I-Max) - well worth it to me.  We have a 2012 Panasonic plasma 3D TV and did not have to make any adjustments - it was great as set for all my other wonderful 3D movies.",1363996800,,1109,4.178403755868545

5243391,1,B0092PXSEE,"This video is unbelievably pathetic.  The content is absolutely ordinary, mostly common fish, and the videography, if you can even call it that, is of the most amateurish kind.  Most of the footage shows little if any true colors because the light they used to film is pitifully underpowered.  If you like looking at blue-green fish against endless expanses of blue-green coral, this one's for you.  Oh, and the narrative content and the narrator are equally sophomoric.  Was this the project of a freshman in film school? One could take a GoPro camera and a $100 underwater light and produce something infinitely better.  IMAX or Discovery Channel-quality it is NOT!

Over saturated pictures, wrong colors, out of focus, shaky camera and the woman narrator is somewhat distant to the subject to say it least. The editing is very strange, start on a subject, cut to something else and then back to the subject.. It's really painful to see this film.  I have several hundreds of dives in nearly every corner of the Red Sea the last 10 years, and it deserves better than this!  Its 3D yes, but the milky water, strange camera angels and close-ups does not the diving industry of Egypt any good.. they need badly some good films to help them out these days!

5243394,2,B0092PXSEE,"So I pre-purchased this, and recently received it.  I was pretty disappointed.  As an avid diver and underwater photographer, here is what I found with this video:

1) The 3D was acceptable
2) The colors and lighting were terrible.  The majority of the movie seemed to be tremendously washed out.  Very few moments of vivid color.  Honestly, the lighting seemed to be tremendously unprofessional.
3) The subject material was pretty boring.  What was shown was very standard, every day fish that you see while diving.  For those that are not divers, this might not necessarily be an issue
4) Repetitiveness - In any nature documentary, subjects are generally introduced once, talked about, and the narrator moves on to the next subject.  In this DVD, there are MULTIPLE discussions about the same type of fish.  If you talk about a butterfly fish once, there is no need to introduce it again 15 minutes later... then again 10 minutes after that.  (I use this as an example, I don't remember if it was a butterflyfish.  But there are multiple instances in which things are reintroduced and talked about.  It seemed like they were trying to just make the video longer with filler).

I again watched IMAX Under the Sea last night, which is leaps and bounds better regarding quality.  While I did not HATE this video (hence no 1 star), I can honestly say I will not be watching it again.",1363132800,2,1382,4.7238493723849375

5243397,2,B0092PXSEE,"If you want to test your new 3D TV, like me, this will work.  But the voiceover was done by the girlfriend of the producer, not a talent.  She's probably a nice person.

5243398,2,B0092PXSEE,i own several 3d movies and i believe this is the worst. The narroration is poor and so is the picture quality.,1362614400,2,111,4.090909090909091
5243399,4,B0092PXSEE,"I would expect something with more vibrant colors since I love watching reef videos in 2D but realistically it shouldn't be because ocean waters are not as clear and pristine as our drinking water. So even with today's high-tech underwater cameras, it ain't gonna change the actual composition of the water. In this video, you will actually see the reefs as it is with real life 3D effects and that's spectacular. On the foreground are vibrant colors of a wide variety of reef creatures from the tiniest planktons to huge groupers. Yes, planktons meandering at your fingertips strikingly highly defined and well focused. Oh how I adore 3Ds!  I'm not so sure of the condition of the stony corals but at passing scenes, some of them look withering. :(  As backgrounds, they look terrible because of their dull colors so I wouldn't give this video 5 stars but it's still a great adventure without getting wet. It could be the location so I'll try to compare it with the other stony corals shot at Papua.",1362614400,4,1000,4.708571428571428

The English narrator clearly did not know what she was reading.  She mispronounced many key words and read meaningless text at other points.  There was no unifying theme, no educational content, and, worst of all, precious little entertainment content.  Also, I have a 3D TV and glasses.  There was nothing 3D about the video - period.  We made it 2/3 of the way through before we cut our losses and will probably never finish the entire viewing.

5243405,2,B0092PXSEE,"Cons: Focus issues in several scenes, glare, camera lens smudge, patchwork editing, beyond bad narration, not educational for most adults.

Pros:  Price, a few coral formations I haven't seen in other movies of this type, no environmental agenda.

I gave this movie 2 stars due to price, lack of an agenda, and a few memorable shots.  I give Amazon points off for allowing people to post reviews before the DVD was released.

Other reviews are spot on about the repeated mispronunciation of anemone (aneneme) and other narration issues.

It seemed like they ran out of content about 1/2 way through the movie and recycled material.

Tips to better enjoy the movie:
In the menu, red color means selected and it defaults to Deutsch.
Watch with music only, or better yet, play your favorite music for 52 minutes.  Although if you are like me, curiosity will likely win out and you'll listen to the ""narrator"" at least for awhile.

Side Notes:
I think the person who wrote the script has a pet peeve about the proper usage of shoals and schools.  The word shoal was used well over a dozen times, school once.  Could be the entire point of this film was to get people to look up the difference, as there was no other obvious story line.  The word anemone (aneneme) was also also used far too much. I suppose it could also be due to poor translation from another language as others have noted.

If the cover didn't say Egypt you would never know the reef existed there.  I would like to know more about the area and it's relationship to the reef.

About me:  I am a fan of all that is underwater, and own several other 3D titles in this genre.  I purchase 3D movies, stream 2D movies.  Elite Pro-60X5FD TV.",1362268800,3,1700,4.536184210526316
5243406,3,B0092PXSEE,"I have over 50 3d movies and documentaries and i've seen 1 star 3d's and this is not one of them. granted it's not IMAX UNDER THE SEA ( which is the best of them all) or IMAX DEEP SEA (second best) but it's not terrible. Though the negatives do outweigh the positives. CONS: Some scenes do have what appears to be smudge marks on the lens, it looks blurry and there is some glare now and then. Also 80% of this is just fish swimming around, there is a sea turtle that looks great and a few dolphins, so the content is a little boring. But the number 1 annoyance is the narration, believe everything you read from other reviews about it. from pronunciation, childlike tone, uninteresting comments, it's all true. The solution for this is to go into the settings and change to MUSIC ONLY setting, it's so much better. PROS: there are some really good 3d scenes, nothing really WOW (like IMAX UNDER THE SEA) but decent, the dolphin scenes look really good. Overall the majority of the picture quality is quite good. The music is fine. So in conclusion if you factor in the low price, and you watch this with MUSIC ONLY setting, I would have to recommend it. But if you can get only one underwater 3d definitely get IMAX UNDER THE SEA. Although this one is only a third the price of IMAX UNDER THE SEA. So you get what you pay for.",1362268800,26,1327,4.312
5243407,4,B0092PXSEE,"I recently purchased a 3-D TV (47"" LG LCD) and decided to get some 3-D content.

So far, I have seen the following BD disks: IMAX Under the Sea 3D, Avatar 3D, Harry Potter and the Deadly hallows part 2 3D, TRON Legacy 3D, Narnia 3 3D.

I have read the reviews of this item and, after watching this documentary decided to write this review to help other viewers interested in this documentary - as I always check reviews before purchasing a DVD. I will start by saying that I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND THE 1-STAR RATING of some viewers (I do respect their opinions though).

First the CONS: The female narrator seems to be translating literally a script written in another language (maybe german?), therefore it sounds ""strange"" when she uses some words as ""shoals"", but it is really a minor detail, the voice is good and the pronunciation is properly done, I do not think this is a major issue whatsoever. The musical score is not memorable but serviceable, and not in the league of some IMAX documentaries, and I have seen many as Antarctica, Alaska, Beavers, Deep Sea, Into the Deep, Africa The Serengeti, etc.

Now the PROS: The 3D works perfectly, no ghosting to be found WHATSOEVER.

The underwater views are really good and the documentary is fun and entertaining, very colorful and interesting. The images are really good in general with some of them being really outstanding. The price is really good for this kind of product of this quality. I want to make sure to readers, I do not benefit at all with my reviews, as I do not know, nor participate with any of the producing team of this documentary, but I think the previous reviews are really unfair to this item, I have seen many, and I mean many 1-Star rated dvds and this one, for sure, is not one of them, I can really recommend this documentary as a fun and very well produced underwater 3D BD.

I really wouldn't be surprised if these ""reviews"" were written in another language and translated into English using Google translate.

One review said, ""I did watch it and did it with my kids and we love this product."" Really? You ""did it with your kids""? Nice try.

From another 5 star review, ""About the film, there are many close records from strange animals. It contains real 3D effects."" I know buying reviews from Indian companies is cheap, but maybe you should spend a little more and use a company that employs people with a slightly better grasp on the English language.

I could go on and on making similar comments on literally EVERY 5 star review for this ""movie"", but I'll let you enjoy discovering the silliness on your own.

Now onto the movie. It seems like a bunch of idiots got together, bought a cheap 3d camera, took a vacation, filmed themselves scuba diving, and are trying to cash in on the lack of 3d content. Luckily I never opened my copy and will be returning it and avoiding all future movies by this company.

*edit* The fake reviews went and changed what I made fun of. Just go ahead and notice that only one of the five star reviews has a purchase of this movie verified by amazon. Buy at your own risk.

Of course we all had on our Active 3D glasses.  We've watched many other 3D movies on our setup and liked it very much (mostly kids movies like How To Train Your Dragon, and live concerts).  This particular disc has no 3D effect at all.  My Active 3D glasses (that automatically darken when they detect a 3D signal) didn't even darken.  The screen looked exactly the same with or without the glasses on; normally the 3D screen looks terrible if you are not wearing the glasses.  It's like the disc is labeled 3D but is actually just a regular Blu-Ray disc.  Very disappointing.  We watched about 20 minutes of it - it's an okay show if you want a 2D aquarium tour with some soothing music, but it is certainly not a stunning 3D under sea adventure.

Being a blu ray I had also hoped that it would have a 2D version as an option to play as background during gatherings or simply as a screen saver. This is a 3D ONLY disc.

The reader is exceptionally poor as is the sub par plot line. Have to say that there are better undersea videos like the very well done, 2D only, Reefscapes: Nature's Aquarium DVD. Loved Reefscapes and can't wait for them to try some 3D someday.

Except for animated content, good 3D content is just hard to find.

The cinematography is  very mediocre, and nothing to rave about, but the worst part is the narrator/ cheesy music.

Her voice is so irritating, I ended up muting the rest of the film. Very awkward writing, combined with the voice of your annoying kid sister, I really cannot comprehend why they chose to ruin the 3D footage. It really felt like this movie was created for the purpose of educating inner city 3rd/4th graders...(no offense.) Several obvious factual errors made this film even more frustrating....

I had to wait 3 months for this DVD to be released and I, again, was only able to get it to change to English on one of my DVD players. In fact, I couldn't actually choose English from the start menu...if I tried to choose English, it would just stop the disc. Anyway, I started it in Deutsch and then, from my DVD player sub-menu, I was able to choose English. FYI: The sub-menu response time for this DVD was very slow to acknowledge...you may have to have patience.

Okay, about the movie...The 3D effects are pretty good and I really do like nature and especially underwater experiences although the full scope of beauty and astonishment of the Egyptian waters are not really captured well here. Some of the videography is a bit off and the scenes move rather slowly without any real rhyme or reason. The narrative is basic with some interesting information. The last 10 minutes are probably the best of the entire movie. Overall, I would rate the actual movie about 3 stars.

5243418,2,B0092PXSEE,"I had high hopes for this feature and waited quite a while to get it. Unfortunately, I must completely agree with others who have already dinged this for its substandard video quality and editing.
  There are indeed smudges on the housing dome port or camera lens. Sometimes, there are also bubbles on the outside of the dome port as well- not an uncommon occurrence when filming underwater but which can easily be wiped off. The camcorder which was used badly clipped (burned out) highlights in many of the shots to such an extent that I'm amazed that they weren't embarrassed to use them in the final production. This is no small matter as this happened quite frequently. Many shots also appeared quite overexposed. There were however some very good clips as well. It's just a shame that they chose to use so many clips which should never have made it into the final production, because the good ones were quite effective.
  I've been shooting stills and video underwater for many years and  accept the fact that only a portion of what I shoot is really good. The bad stuff- of which there is a fair amount- gets discarded. That lesson seems to be lost on the people who made this title. Too bad!",1361836800,5,1198,4.605633802816901
