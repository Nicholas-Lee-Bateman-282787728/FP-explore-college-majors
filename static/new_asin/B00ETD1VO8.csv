yesterday, July 14, 2014, via UPS. It was wrapped very carefully and the usually UPS driver for my area delivered it right to my front door and put it in my hand. Excellent service from the Amazon.com merchant. Quick careful delivery long before it was due. I have terminal kidney cancer and severe terminal heart disease. UPS went out of their way to knock on my door and deliver it.
My husband and I watched this very sad and depressing biography of one of the ""greatest actors of all time"". Richard Burton was a man ahead of his time. In the biography you will find out that he grew up in abject poverty and in the worst of human conditions somewhere in Wales. He grew up in a large family and had many brothers and sisters. His mother died shortly after the birth of one of his last siblings. He had to learn to speak proper english from Wales and a producer took an active interest in him to teach him proper english. He was born with the innate ability for theatrical acting and film. He was an excellent theatrical Shakespearean actor and had a great love of the stage and Shakespear. His voice and mannerism made him totally unique and he had great range and acting ability both on stage and film. He also had severe emotional problems. Born in Pontrhydyfen, Wales of the United Kingdom, Nov. 10, 1925 and died at the age of 58, Aug. 5,1984 of: Cerebral haemorrhage. His first marriage was to Sybil Williams - 1949 to 1963 (then divorced her for Elizabeth Taylor -twice married her and divorced - 1964 to 1974; then 1975 to 1976), his last wife until his death was Sally Hay. His chilldren from his first marriage: Lisa, Jessica, Liza Todd, and Maria Burton. The biography shows that Richard did not particularly like parties; being around crowds of people; and left the film/acting industry for several years and inspired by Shakespearean threatrical training by his school master, Philip H. Burton, he excelled in school productions, his first being The Apple Cart. Richard Burton was probably one of greatest actors of all time, but, he was severely troubled and this biography showed it. I left feeling extremely depressed after watching it, altho, there were many interviews from his friends, family, children, Elizabeth Taylor and his wives. His eldest daughter, Lisa, appeared to be the most hateful towards Elizabeth Taylor. Richard felt guilty about the first divorce and leaving his children, one of which was mentally retarded. He had a very hard life and was a very philosophical, confused, and pensive person. Acting came second-nature to Richard Burton. He had 13 brothers and sisters. He was nominated several times for Oscars but never won. This was a well put together biography and is new, but, it is quite depressing. I hope you will at least appreciate it, it was well worth the 20.00. Thank you for reading my review of ""The World Of Richard Burton"". It also showed most of the films and threatrical performances he was in including ""Hamlet"" (threatrical proformance - then turned into film).  -  Mrs. Dione  L. WilliamsCrayton, July 14, 2014.
