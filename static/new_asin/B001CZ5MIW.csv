8290475,5,B001CZ5MIW,"This is a great throwback to my younger cartoon watching days. Especially the catchy theme song that even todays' kids know!!!!
Do not give bad reviews if it will not play on your Region 1 DVD player! That is unfair to the integrity of not only to the seller but the product quality and fun! BE Aware, these are Region 2 which it clearly states in the description!!",1503792000,,365,4.382352941176471

8290477,5,B001CZ5MIW,Why has this not been released in the USA? It was my favorite cartoon as a kid and it is pathetic that it has not been released in the USA! This show was very inspirational to me and helped motivate me to become a costume designer and make Superheroes and Villains. So there is no excuse why it should not be on my DVD shelf!,1404000000,,325,4.015384615384615
