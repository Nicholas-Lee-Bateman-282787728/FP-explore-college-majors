3774410,5,B001R8B5TO,"This second box set is at least as well done as the first, although the plot isn't quite as compelling as in Vol. 1. The end also seemed a little hasty, but that certainly wasn't enough to drag down such an incredible series...",1241395200,,227,4.3023255813953485
3774411,5,B001R8B5TO,"Just like the release of the first season, Death Note season 2 box set contains every episode of the show's final run.

Plot-wise, Death Note is just as strong with the best animation I've ever seen in anime (or any show for that matter). The story this time isn't as compelling as season 1 (Near is nowhere ""near"" as interesting as L and no one else is very likeable), but the show keeps you hooked and wraps things up in a very satisfying conclusion.

Instead of the extras posted just on individual discs, this DVD set comes with a bonus disc which contains the makings-of and interviews with the original Japanese cast and creaters. To me this gave the buyer an equally compelling reason to purchase this DVD set even though it's a few episodes shorter than first season. I can't say whether this set is still worth owning if you already have the individual volumes, but if you don't it's more than worth the $$$.

Like I said, if you're an anime buff and looking for something intriguing (and mature) this show is NOT TO BE MISSED!",1239840000,8,1036,4.5

Light's attempt to create and rule a world cleansed of evil using the notebook.

Soon after, the number of deaths of reported criminals catches the attention of the a mysterious detective known only as ""L"". L quickly learns that the serial killer, dubbed by the public as ""KIRA"" is located in Japan. L also concludes that Kira can kill people without laying a finger on them. Light realizes that L will be his greatest Enemy, and a game of psychological cat and mouse between the two begins.

Volume 2, Description:
THROUGH THE POWER OF THE DEATH NOTE, LIGHT YAGAMI IS CLOSE TO CREATING A WORLD IN WHICH HE HOLDS ULTIMATE AUTHORITY OVER RIGHT AND WRONG.

You will be glued to your seat from beginning to end awaiting to see if Light succeeds in creating a new world off his warped ideals. Second the finale is not a typical sell-out happy ending it is very dark and not afraid to make your jaw drop with its satisfyingly brilliant conclusion. I was a little disappointed to see that this is a ""dvd set"" not a ""box set"" meaning no bad ass box like the first half had. Also you can tell this was made a long time ago because they only put three episodes to a disc (while new tech allows us to have whole seasons be three disc long). So, when binge watching this I had a lot of getting of my ass to do changing disc. In the long run the complete series is about $30.

However, I found the conclusion of this series just as enjoyable as the start and would recommend this purchase to any anime fan. While it's different than your classic shonen, Death Note manages to stay true to the manga that keeps you guessing with every page.

3774439,5,B001R8B5TO,"Ah, Death Note. What a wild ride. Death Note is my favorite manga of all time, so of course I just impulsively bought the DVDs before watching the show. And I'm glad I did. While of course they made some small changes, this is a very good, very true adaptation of the manga. While its age shows a little since it was done before the days of wide-spread blu rays, the DVD quality is still very good, and they did some amazing artistic things with camera angles, lighting, and music (the music is unexpectedly epic. The OST for this show is top notch). The story is as phenomenal as it ever was. I honestly I don't think I could be more impressed with the anime adaptation for one of my favorite works of fiction. While I had a few ""aw, why did they change that line"" moments, the overall feel was still in tact and I was largely pleased. Do yourself a favor and give this show a try. It will not disappoint you, as a lover of the manga or someone entirely new to Death Note.",1412208000,,973,4.208556149732621
3774440,4,B001R8B5TO,"Light's memory along with Misa's have been wiped clean of the Death Note. The two possess absolutely no knowledge of ever using the killer notebook or its powers. In fact, they have completely forgotten how ""Kira"" kills. L still isn't convinced of their innocence, and he's keeping both of them under 24 hour surveillance with Light handcuffed to him, despite Light wanting to work the ""Kira"" case with him anyway. L and Light have come to believe there is in fact a third ""Kira"". The trail leads them to a business company called Yotsuba Corporation.-summary

Here goes the final season half of the Death Note anime series directed by Tetsuro Araki, which is based on the manga by Tsugumi Ohba. Araki did a great job following the manga and delivering a very solid finale. Even though there are slight differences later in the series, and there is a small decline in areas where the series excelled at previously. It never becomes incoherent or a chore to watch, because the series pretty much sticks to the things it has been doing well. To include, in the seventh volume, an event takes place which completely reshapes the story, and thus, new characters are injected into the fray.

The series still does an outstanding job when handling the music. There are a couple of new songs added to the BGM, and each of them stood out to me when enhancing the intensity and drama in very important scenes, as well as in character interactions. I mentioned once before that I didn't care for the opening and ending themes during the first half. My feelings still haven't really changed much because the new opening features a heavy metal song, that gives off a very awkward feel and it just doesn't fit the style of the anime at all, plus I plain just don't like it.

The ending theme on the other hand called Billy in Despair, which is performed by Maximum the Hormone is a very good song to me, and it goes down as one of my favorites, but I'm still out in limbo concerning how it fits with the personality of the series. The animation is a step down when compared to the first half, but it's kind of hard to notice. Many of the character designs and some of the artwork really aren't of the same quality, and at times the CG did come off a bit goofy looking to me. Despite the flaws, the visuals are still strong, with the camera work providing the necessary assist. There is also a small bit of fan service delivered via Misa Amane in some overly sexy outfits.

Although it started out as an excellent series, unfortunately the greatness didn't last. This second half pales in comparison to the beginning in almost every category. Almost everything that gave the series that very special feel appears to be toned down quite a bit. The characters that are later introduced really aren't developed that well, and come off a little bit more as filler characters and plot devices. The educated guesswork which worked to perfection in the beginning was reduced more to blind speculation on one occasion, that really didn't seem right and felt a bit too ridiculous. There were also some pacing issues, such as a majority of one episode used as a recap, along with forced character development on a new character. However, the series does manage to reclaim its greatness before the ending, and does deliver a very good ending in the process.

Death Note has its flaws, but it's still a great series and I can't really imagine anyone becoming bored at any time. The storytelling is very sharp for the most part and the characters are very memorable. I believe this series can even appeal to the casual anime fan. It's very easy to get into, and it doesn't make any attempt to intentionally put the viewers brain in knots. I highly recommend this one. Also I have to mention, don't come into this series expecting action galore. Blood and explosions is not what this series is about. It's mainly a character driven drama that can be dialogue heavy at times. There is very little brutal violence here.

To those who read the manga first, I recommend setting your expectations low or come into this completely ignoring the source material. The character and plot development is seriously lacking when compared to the manga in the second half. I can understand any fan of the manga who would feel cheated, but it still delivered from where I see it. I also recommend completely avoiding the Death Note: Re-Light series. It's completely worthless in every way imaginable. It's nothing more than a cheap tactic to cash in on the Death Note name.

Those who saw the series, yet are interested in the manga should do so because it's definitely worth checking out. However, to those who are only interested in seeing what was left out, then I recommend skipping most of the series and go straight to Volume 8. From that point on, it will feel like a totally different story. Also, visit the live action movies if your crave is still strong, or if you're not a fan of anime and manga. Death Note is an incredibly hyped series, but this is one of those rare occasions where the average otaku didn't cheat me. This final half contains volumes 6-9, episodes 21- 37, with a 415 minute runtime.

Pros: High in tension and suspense, music score, ending

Cons: Not as strong as the beginning, minor pacing issues",1411862400,,5285,4.643850267379679

3774455,5,B001R8B5TO,"A big improvement from the first version of season 2's box set which was badly designed. If you don't know what Im talking about the box sets are those bulky ones. I prefer this slim set because compared to the other bulky set you don't have to worry about holding it. If you were to take the bulk sets from a book shelf the first thing that'll happen is the set slipping out from the bottom and if you're not careful the set could break and possibly causing damage to the discs. Another thing I hate about the other set are the disc holders. They are clear plastic and they'll make you feel like you're gonna break the disc because they're tight (if you're familiar with special edition Harry Potter DVDs then you'll know what Im talking about). I honestly don't know what Viz Media were thinking. I wish they went with a slim design from the beginning or have thought out a better design for the older box sets.

On the set itself, like I said before this is a big improvement. It won't take much space on your bookshelf (its the same size as any regular single DVD case you may have) that contains 5 discs in all. 4 discs are the other half of the series (with English and Japanese dub and English subs) while disc 5 is a bonus disc with interviews from the Japanese cast and crew of the anime series. It also includes concept art from all the characters, props, and backgrounds used for the series. All discs have an image of each character that volume was meant for when Viz Media released the single DVDs while the 5th disc having an image that was used for the cover of the final DVD volume of the Japanese release (minor spoilers if you haven't finished the series in manga or anime format).

I cannot say enough how much I prefer this version of season 2's box set. I just wish Viz Media released a slim set for season 1, that would make things so much better for me. Get it while you can!",1397433600,,1898,4.298882681564246

The build up of Volume/Set 1 makes you think they're going to mirror, but Volume/Set 2 will surprise you.

Great writing, emotion, and art. It didn't end the way I wanted it to, but you can't fault the creators for not making a story end just for you.",1391472000,,457,4.252873563218391
3774464,5,B001R8B5TO,"At this point, there's virtually no point in going over the plot of this series, as this has been done so many times. I know, I know... this set has one of the most controversial episodes of the series included in it, and this has been discussed to death as well. For the purposes of this review, I'll focus mainly on the packaging and presentation of this set.

If you're OCD like me, the first thing you'll notice is that this set is different than the first volume sold on Amazon and other outlets. It's much thinner, and the discs fit into a plastic flip book as opposed to a cardboard slot for each. This may not be a huge issue for some, but I would have liked this set to match the one already in my collection.

Thankfully, the discs are the exact same as the individual volumes sold when the series first appeared on DVD. They're packed pretty nicely with extras, including selective episode commentaries by the English cast, a nine-part ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette continued from the previous set, and various artwork and animatic sequences. The one thing that bothers me is that Viz didn't even bother to put unique trailers onto each disc, instead choosing to recycle the same four over the whole volume. Whatever, who considers trailers ""special features"" anyway?

This set also includes a bonus disc that was previously unavailable (I think?), and it has a bunch of interviews with the Japanese creators and voice cast. It's actually pretty cool as well.

The episodes themselves look great, and each has the following set of features:
- Original Japanese Audio Track
- English Subtitles
- English Dub (which isn't totally unbearable...shocker!)

This set is great overall, and the series is a must-own for fans, especially since there is no indication we're getting a Blu-ray release anytime soon.",1390953600,,1815,4.80448717948718

3774471,5,B001R8B5TO,"Box set, episodes 21-37.  Single DVD box, five disc set, each disc has its own tray.

I love this series.  Hands down the best anime.  The English dub, IMHO, is the best.  Usually the dubs seem a little stiff, but for this series, not the case.  Each voice actor was the character.

The symbolism at the end was awesome.  Like set 1, I highly recommend this set, you won't regret the purchase.",1385510400,,393,4.361111111111111
3774472,5,B001R8B5TO,"So glad I bought this. The manga and anime are both great, this is a must buy for fans of either. A great ending to one of the best animes I've ever seen, and a whole disc with bonus content!",1382745600,,191,3.8
3774473,3,B001R8B5TO,"I didn't realize when I first ordered that the last 5 discs of the Deathnote series were in a DVD case instead of a box like the first 5.  The case arrived with all discs still in place, but it was designed to hold 4 of the 5 discs in a middle spindle, making the whole thing very easy to damage.  Sure enough, one of the four spindle holds was broken, allowing the bottommost post to move loosely in the case.  This runs the risk of the entire spindle falling out when the case is opened.  I have ordered a set of replacement cases (a pack of 5 cases, with each one holding up to 6 discs, with 4 of them held on the case walls).  I'm half tempted to demand that Amazon pay for the replacements, but I don't have any proof whether or not the damage was already done when Volume 2 arrived at Amazon's warehouse.  The problem can't be detected by moving the case around, only by opening it.  In the end, I have to blame the distributor, Viz Video, for putting the discs in a poorly-designed case in the first place.

Finally finished watching the series, so here's my comment on Set 2 (might be some spoilers):

As far as the story goes, the killings became extremely fast-paced and somewhat arbitrary as the series approached the end.  Maybe this was reflecting Light's growing insanity?  The very end was what I expected to happen, although sad as well.  I didn't like the character of Near at all, because he came across more like a younger version of ""L"", instead of having his own distinct personality.  He also seemed sadistic, which ""L"" had going on too, but not anywhere near as much.  I did appreciate the fact that the end precludes any sequels that continue the story beyond that point.  Too many second season or more anime shows out there already.",1381968000,,1758,4.3993808049535605

If you are looking at this, you've probably already seen the first part so you know what you are getting into. There is too much I would spoil by trying to summarize the plot on this set.

There is more violence in the second half than there is in the first, but it's still first and foremost a battle of wits.  And even though there's not that much action, the animators did an amazing job of making it beautifully cinematic; they were able to make the stroke of a pen feel like the slash of a knife--because in this universe, those basically amount to the same thing.",1367366400,2,738,4.676923076923077

You take one of the most well written and voiced acted anime from the first season and dampen the overall experience. Now I love this show and the guilty side of me is happy they made another season for us to have some closure but this season takes some great ideas and executes them poorly. If you've watched the first you must watch the second and I'd say that the first one is so good that this season can coast off the firsts accomplishments and still be great.,1358208000,,614,4.125

This DVD Box-Set is the second part of DN series. I think it's worth watching it because it entices the intellect of its audience. First, I didn't want to see it because I prefer doing other things than atching TV like a couch potato (that makes me sick!), but when I saw the first chapters, the intellectual battle between L and Light lured me into the series, and I ended watching it all. I highly recommed this anime to guys who would like to spend time watching anime, specially high school students will be attracted by this Todai environment (which is developed in the beginning of the series), and perhaps they'll look forward to enroll to a university like Todai (lol).

3774522,1,B001R8B5TO,"Alright, let me preface this review by saying that Death Note was actually the best anime I had ever seen, up until the episodes in this box set. I don't think colossal disappointment gives justice to how this show falls on its face. The back and forth between Light and L was nothing short of brilliant, every plot twist was more complicated and ingenious than the one before it, but then something goes terribly wrong.

**SPOILERS**

Once L is defeated in possibly one of the cheapest deaths I've seen, the show doesn't know which way to turn. They end up sending two new detectives, one of which is statistically smarter than L (Wtf?!!!) and about half his age (again... Wtf?!) So you're telling me that the worlds greatest detective, actually the worlds greatest THREE detectives, was surpassed in an instant by two children? Okay.... So why weren't they on the case to begin with if they were so superior to L? It doesn't help that Near is a carbon copy of L with white hair, he looks the same, he acts the same, he thinks the same, even so far as to mystically come up with EVERY detail L managed to attain in the case, without any assistance (except for his team that does nothing but awe at Nears presence before dying) in a few weeks, despite the fact that L spent an abundance of time with Light, where as Near had never even met him. Then we have the rest of the detective agency who were all specifically chosen because of their intellect, but suddenly they all become brain dead. For the entire first half of the show they are ONE clue away from catching Kira and putting him behind bars. Then, after L dies they choose Light to take over for him because he thinks like L and he's their best chance at catching him. Well, several years later and they have jack to show for it. If that wasn't a punch in the face that Light was at least connected to Kira, it was sure as hell grounds to kick him off the team and get a new leader, or hell even quit, but your telling me they just sat on their thumbs for all those years?!! Misa, who used to be an integral part of the story gets written off as well, she has no point whatsoever in the latter portion of the series, she's just at home cleaning all day hoping to make the perfect wife for Light. The only redeeming portion in the end for me at least was that Ryuk killed Light, not only was it satisfying since Ryuk told him he would do so since the very beginning, but also because Light was killed with a heart attack, meaning two things, he died the way he killed most of his victims, and to the public Kira is still out there, Light was just another evil person that Kira 'judged'. Other than that, this entire box set is garbage.",1335571200,4,2694,4.322134387351778

The music in this anime is awesome, The story is full of twist and turns and has some cool psychological layers in it that are enjoyable.

I was at the edge of my seat and could not wait for each episode.

This series both Vol 1& 2 will keep you coming back and asking for more.

This set is the concluding episodes to the series.

Both Vol 1 & 2 stories are written very well,  The animation for both Vol 1& 2 is done rather well, The voice acting even for the English dubbed was done rather well.

This story concludes with a person named ""N"" also hunting the person who is killing people and all the way to the fantastic conclusion I was at the edge of my seat.

And after all that time waiting to see what was gonna happen, waiting to see if that punk Light was gonne get caught and brought to justice, it was well worth it!  The climax was great!  DONT READ AHEAD IF YOU HAVENT SEEN THE SHOW YET.  At first I was disappointed when L died.  But Nir (spelling?) turned out to be a worthy successor.  I was really rooting for him to catch Kira.  Light is so clever and cunning throughout the series, it makes you like him at times as well.  But as the series goes on, you hate him more and more.  Hes such an arrogant punk and he has complete disregard for human life, even his own father and sister.  He thinks hes outsmarted everyone, but in the end he is defeated by Nir.  And another thing I love is that Matsuta (again, spelling?), who is the most wavering and undependable of the task force, is the one who reacts quickly and shoots Light in his hand when he makes the last attempt to write names on the paper!  It was just so great to see Light get what he deserved.  The only thing I would have liked to see, is what happens after the death of Kira.  How do people react to Kiras death?  Is it made known that Light Yagami was Kira?  Does crime skyrocket?  I guess we are left to speculate on those questions.  But this is by far my favorite anime series I've seen thus far!

The artwork on each dvd is unique and nice for the collectors. 4 of the dvds contain episodes and the 5th disc is a whole extras disc from the show and if you like the behind the scenes stuff this is for you.

For the current price it is a little high but still worth it because the dvds are not plain, the packaging is not cheap and the show is great

3774533,5,B001R8B5TO,"The second season of Death Note continues to follow the story of Light who happened to find a Death Note, which had been deliberately dropped by Ryuk, a Shinigami (Also known as a death god). The book has granted Light the power to kill others by writing their name inside while picturing their face (So people with the same name aren't effected). Light has used this book in season 1 to try and create a perfect world of which he intends to rule. It is with this intention that he refused Ryuk's offer to have Shinigami eyes. The eyes enable him to see the name and life span of anyone he sees. However the taking the eyes from Ryuk would shorten his own life span so he refuses. The killings he commits attracts the attention of a world famous detective called L. The public and police begin to call the mysterious killer Kira. A serious of marvelous twists and turns in the plot start from there keeping you enthralled and on the edge of your seat.

The second season has just as many twists and turns bringing new characters in who do Lights dirty work as the special task force assigned with catching Kira comes closer and closer to achieving their goal. Kira by this time has done much for his new regime and slowly the world leaders are backing down from fighting Kira. Kira himself has brought in new people who are completely devoted to his goals to help him on his quest. Two new characters are also introduced as L's protgs who will continue his work in the hopes of catching Kira.

The new season contains 17 episodes, which are just as well written with many, many plot twists. The episodes are as follows:

This is a darker anime series that I have particularly enjoyed. Fans of Claymore, Hellsing, Rin, Basilisk and Chrono Crusade should feel right at home with this anime. The music was wonderful and very fitting and I found the animation to be great! I would recommend this anime to anyone who enjoyed the anime listed above. For new comers this anime is not a funny or romantic type of anime. If you're looking for that than I would suggest looking elsewhere. But for seekers of a serious anime with serious characters and plots this is perfect. It does have some supernatural elements but it makes all the more better in my honest opinion.

3774541,2,B001R8B5TO,"The Deathnote started out as a great series, but this page is specifically for ""Box Set 2"", not Box set 1. Having said that, I'm amazed by the number of people on here who list this box set at 4 or 5 stars. Really? Really?! Do you want to rethink that? The premise of the show is very interesting, and the crux of the plot is the interesting cat and mouse routine between L and Light. This is where the show shines. And this is pretty much what Box Set 1 is about. Oh man, does this show tank in the 2nd half.

So here are the specific problems. SPOILER ALERT!! DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE SHOW. First of all, this may be the most confusing series of all time. It makes the intricacies and plot lines of LOST look simple by comparison. You can follow the twists and turns in the first half of the story. By the end of the series, it was practically impossible to follow. I mean, a second Kira? Interesting. Shinigami eyes...even more interesting! OK, apparently that wasn't enough. Lets add a third Kira to the mix, and then a fourth...and a fifth. Pretty soon everyone is getting in on the action. Eventually Lights Dad gets Shinigami eyes?! It just got ridiculous. The blase nature in which everyone on the task force finds out there are Gods of death, and it isn't even discussed at all. They could have had some interesting convos about the implications of such a huge revelation. But no mention. Secondly, the number of rules in the Deathnote are ridiculous. The premise of the show is smart if you can keep the deathnote down to a certain number of fairly logical rules. However, the rules really start to get confusing and ridiculous. The show really jumped the shark when Light is standin in the forest and relinquishes note to Ryuk, then tell him to give to Rem (why does Ryuk have to follow your orders?), and then Rem gives to him. And this did some kind of ""refresh"" or something? Just so confusing and dumb. You apparently can forgot all the things you've done by getting rid of the note, but apparently you can ""lend it"" to other people. And just for ""flavor"", they introduce 2 rules each episode between part 1 and 2 of the episode ( a total of 70+ rules for the deathnote?!). Even though many are not relevant to the plot, its overwhelming and confusing to see all of them listed. In addition, The shinigami aren't supposed to help their humans, but Ryuk practically bends over for Light. And at one point he outright lies about the Notebooks abilities to L, after L discovers the Notebook with the rest of his team. I felt bad for L, in that he never had a chance in this show. 2 Kiras working against him, plus 2 shinigami against him also? Ryuk doesn't like being watched by cameras (even though he is invisible and cant be seen), so he helps Light by telling him he is being watched and the locations of the cameras. Yes, that's quite ""neutral"" Ryuk. But the worst and weakest plot point was Ryuk lying to the face of L, regarding what its capable of. He had no obligation to lie on behalf of Light. One of the dumbest things in the show though was when Rem decides to die for Amane. I mean, you have actual Gods here, so you think if they ""love"" a person, it would be an interesting or noble character. Amane is an immature and evil moron. Shes ready to kill friends at a drop of a hat, an obsessed with Light. A totally week and insane character with no backbone. This is someone worth dying for. One shinigami (Gelus) already died for her, and now Rem considers her worth dying for?! Yeah right. Rem kills L, even though its Light who is clearly the evil guy and has threatened Amane already. Hey Rem...newsflash, not only is Amane not worth giving up your immortal life over...but the one guy who can probably stop Light, is the one you just killed. Don't you think by taking yourself out of the picture, that mr evil genius (Light), will now be able to kill Amane if he wants? And he already threatened her with that. How smart is that? And with a whole story that is based on a hero and nemesis, you would think that the finale should be the final showdown between the two. Nope. They kill off L midway, and replace him with two other detectives. By the way, speaking of detective work..L manages to close in on Kira in a matter of months, and then when Light takes over the role of L, 6 yrs later, they still haven't caught Kira. Hmm...i wonder why?! Light was so smart before. But now, with L out of the way, and Light taking over as the new L, the group cant find Kira. Hmm...what a coincidence! Worst detectives ever. The bottomline is that L was a very charming and interesting character and the strength of the entire series. The story never recovers after his cheap and poorly written death. The show had promise, but way to many problems.

The first 5 discs are an ""A"". The rest of the series is an ""F"". As a whole , sadly the series tanks because of convoluted plot and utter confusion of second half of the story. They could have had the story be a cat and mouse chase between L and Light all the way to the final episode, and maybe even had Rem end up helping L ( maybe even have Rem be a nemesis against Ryuk once he was no longer tied to Amane, after he made her ""forget"". Lots of possibilities with Rem, instead of making Rem become the dopey killer of L and then kill herself). And after all good people (L, and his entire task force, etc) that Light killed, they couldn't have come up with a better ending. How about (since apparently Ryuk can lie as to whats true and not in the Death note), you find out he lied about the part where you ""never go to heaven or hell"". How about the final scene is Light in hell, or some ohter type of ""Twilight Zone"" ending? The intelligence and ""out of the box"" thinking of the first half of this series, is totally lacking in the 2nd box set.",1262131200,5,5835,4.327853881278539

The pacing is uneven, after a vacuum is created with the death of these major characters. It picks up a bit, after Light is forced to match wits with two proteges of L: Near and Mellow. Each protege carries different characteristics of L's personality: Near is cold, calculating and logical; Mello is addicted to chocolate, a risk-taker, and willing to take any means necessary to solve the case. The ending for me was a good one, though not perfect. I was glad that Light got what was coming to him in the end.

What bothered me is that how everyone trusts Light. Women give into his every command (because of his charm and good looks), while others trust him because of his background. He's just pure evil.

Death Note came on the air when Bleach was taking a break to dub the Japanese version. I was upset when Bleach went off and didn't want anything to do with this new ""Death Note."" I decided to watch since there was nothing else on TV at 11pm on Saturdays. This show is very interesting, and disturbing in its own way. It makes you think whether killing bad people is a sin or a heroic deed.
This season starts out slow (after the time skip, which should've been the real start of this season) but then it gets back on track like season one. The end is interesting (but kind of obvious).

3774547,5,B001R8B5TO,"In a dreary grey Limbo realm, gruesome angels of death -- ""Shinigami"" -- each possess a notebook in which they pen the names of humans destined to die as a result. To alleviate his boredom, one of these grim reapers called Ryuk not-so-accidentally drops his notebook into the mortal world where it is randomly discovered by an exceptionally clever 17-year-old Japanese high school student named Light Yagami, who opens it to find inscribed the following rule:

""The human whose name is written in this notebook shall die.""

Light assumes that this must be someone's morbid prank but nonetheless takes the book home out of curiosity, soon testing it to confirm its lethal claim. He is initially horrified at the outcome but then decides he can secretly employ this fatal power to change the world ""for the better"" with the stroke of a pen.  Hundreds of reported criminals soon begin dying under eerily similar circumstances, executed from afar by Light's dark justice. The unnaturally synchronized nature of these deaths does not go unnoticed by authorities; they commence a hunt for this mystery killer, whom the media dubs ""Kira"". Along with a special Japanese police task force and the FBI, a reclusive master detective known only as ""L"" is enlisted in the investigation.

But Light's deadly design does indeed begin to effect a transformation in the world as intended. The terrifying threat of punishment by Kira's invisible hand soon acts to discourage sinful behaviour, with a merciless end awaiting all those who defy Kira's will: words written in Light's book are final.  Remaining unseen, Kira is feared by some, worshipped by others, and televangelists shortly spring up to preach in His name...

Sleuthing past the psychological thriller played at the story's surface, thematic parallels to the Judeo-Christian mythos reveal themselves explicitly enough in imagery of the show's opening sequence (first version). There's little symbolic subtlety in the name ""Light"": substituting with ""God"" wherever heard in lines from Ryuk or others lends a sharpened dual-meaning to ""the search for Kira"". (...Head toward the Light!)  One Biblical allusion taunts, ""L - do you know that gods of death love apples?"" referring to the Shinigami's comically depicted dietary fetish, but by proxy may simultaneously characterize the wrathful Gardener of Eden as an infantile apple-hoarder: ""We're dealing with an individual who has a very childish concept of right and wrong,"" observes L early on.

If a criminal is defined by the law maker, then the Death Note becomes an analog to the Bible -- a blacklisting book in which the sinner's damning epithet is framed by the author's prescribed Commandments. ""No matter what world [religion], the god of that world creates the rules,"" Light unapologetically muses in internal monologue. The storyline then indirectly raises the question, if a human really were somehow endowed with supernatural power and was to act in exactly the same vindictive capacity Biblically attributed to God, why is only the human surrogate deemed a despicably immoral character? (...The familiar ""God as a mass murderer"" analogy, re: global flooding and other Bible calamity.)

Loathesomely deceitful, Light Yagami doesn't even qualify as an anti-hero.  His remorseless, scheming betrayal of trust educed from a slain investigator's grieving fianc&eacute;e is utterly heartbreaking. His self-serving manipulation of two endlessly loyal girlfriends, both of whose lives he treats as disposable, elicits raw contempt. Along his slide to the Dark Side, he casually contemplates executing entire crowds of bystanders if necessary to protecting his identity: ""In the worst case, I may have to kill everyone there,"" he indifferently calculates of a busy shopping district.  When Ryuk suggests that Light's murderous social engineering masterplan will render Light alone the grandest practitioner of worldly evil -- a veritable death god -- Light's oblivious reply echoes the special pleading of religious apologists with a flat ontological declaration of his own alleged goodness: if 'might makes right', then surely the almighty can do no wrong. Maniacally egotistical, Light envisions himself not as a mass murderer but as the morally justified ""god of the new world"" despite behaving wickedly as a devil; Kira's most crazed admirers, meanwhile, openly regard him as God incarnate.

Featured at the front end of this Vol. 2 box set is the standout best episode of the series, ""Silence"". A scene crystalizing the title subject has 'L' standing solitary on a rainy skyscraper rooftop listening for the faint sound of... something elusively distant, flanked by dish antennae aimed toward the crying heavens which all seem likewise poised to listen intently. Under the downpour, L has difficulty hearing Light's summoning voice, while Light is unable to discern any distant sound... Is there a god in cosmic attendance, or only silence?

Later, there's an orchestral scene where Light decides to exercise no further restraint in creating his proclaimed ""perfect world"", executing an offensive multitude in a single ruthless penmanship performance from atop the nighted tower, as if divinely conducting the ""rotten""-apple world below.  In the aftermath of his savagely realized Judgement Day, the closing stretch of the series would then seem to offer that if God exists, He is the Devil (or else insane), to be ultimately defeated by reason (per Near's insistence) rather than violence.

I've shown this anime to several friends who happen to be Catholic. They sort of smirked at the first few episodes, dismissing the power-fantasy premise as mildly preposterous. ""Ah, so you agree it's absurd to imagine that an ominous supernatural entity would drop a Book filled with arbitrary damnation rules onto the Earth,"" I said, dropping a black leather-bound Bible in front of them -- it even has a cross on the cover, not unlike the ""DEATH + NOTE"" title screen. This was predictably answered with... Silence.

As far as the detective work of the main plot goes, there are some questionable moments where prophetic deductions by the young prodigy characters are managed from mere scraps of information, approaching uncomfortably close to clairvoyance; where rules for using the Death Note seem to multiply innumerably via intricate caveats for Light's exploiting convenience, surpassing even the Shinigamis' own expressed knowledge of their notebooks' functional capabilities; where this teenaged killer is able to spontaneously spin complex lies and then elaborates in voiceover mode on their far-reaching foolproof facets; where the stacking of suspicion seems too easily forgiven despite independent evidence repeatedly pointing to the same guilty conclusion; and where the otherwise meticulously composed serial killer seems to suddenly behave desperately out of character when cornered.

Regardless of those scattered quibbles, this remains the most logically exacting, intelligently scripted, philosophically weighty anime I've seen yet (perhaps cerebrally besting even ""Ghost In The Shell""), twisting with brilliant flashes of dagger-edged suspense, and also shines with spectacular English dubbing (outdoing the original Japanese), presented here in a darkly elegant DVD package that together with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Note-box-set-Vol-1/dp/B001CZJP0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Note box set Vol. 1</a>&nbsp;earns my most enthusiastic recommendation.

(Rated ""T+"" for older teens. Bloody violence and disturbing content. May provoke thinking.)

3774549,3,B001R8B5TO,"I really enjoyed the behind-the-scenes features on each disc of this set with the English voice cast, who were all very well cast.  There is an extra disc with the Japanese voice cast that I didn't watch because I wasn't interested, but FYI, it is there.

I had already read the manga series before watching the anime, so I am aware how great their source material was and was really curious to see what they would do with it.  I liked the use of color to demonstrate emotional intensity in Kira-related moments: Light is red, L is blue, etc.  Ryuk looked amazing in color, too.

*SPOILERS* Ninety-five percent of the time, the anime stays incredibly close to the manga, except for that weird foot-rubbing scene between L and Light in the pivotal episode in the first box set, ""Silence.""  So after staying so close to the original for the whole story, WHY did they totally ruin the ending, when the original version handed them a great ending on a plate?  The ending in the manga has jaw-dropping art, a final ""conversation"" between Ryuk and Light where Light finally has to face some real consequences, and a follow-up with the Kira task force and Kira's deluded followers.  There is a real, satisfying resolution.  In the anime, Near lets Light get away (?!), and he goes running off through the fading sunlight for some inexplicable reason.  Then we have to look at Misa again, and she is totally redundant by this point in the story.  And Ryuk just sort of explains a couple things in a voice-over.  This fell so flat compared to the manga.  At least they left in the line where Near tells Light he's not a god, just a crazy serial killer.  I'm very sick of anime series that are wrecked by bad endings.",1241913600,9,1707,4.554098360655738
3774550,5,B001R8B5TO,"I first caught ""DEATH NOTE"" on television via the Cartoon Network.  I've heard so many impressive things in regards to the storyline and also saw the series featured on NPR.  To get the critical acclaim it had received worldwide, I realized that this series must be special and had to check it out for myself.  Needless to say, I absolutely loved the series.

""DEATH NOTE"" is a 37-episode TV series that was created by Studio Madhouse and featured on Japanese television in 2006-2007 and featured in the US in 2007-2008.  The series has spawned a popular manga series, a novel, three live action films and has captured the attention of anime and non-anime fans worldwide.

The series focuses on the character of a very smart high school student named Light Yagami.  Bored with his life, he comes across the ""Death Note"" that has special instructions that if one was to write their names on the Death Note, the person would die.  They would die of a heart attack if there were no instructions on how the person is to die.  Or die the way the person possessing the Death Note wrote down.

The Death Note is from a Shinigami (death god) named Ryuk who seems to be bored in his own world and thus starts to enjoy how a person like Light starts to use the Death Note.

For Light (who goes by the name Kira), starts out using the Death Note by writing the names of criminals.  He starts to win supporters due to his ideology of creating a new world without these criminals.  But with so many deaths occurring, the police and the International community begin to fear this serial killer.  And along the way, Light is suspected by the police as a person of interest (a person who could be ""Kira"") and then Light starts to use his Death Note on those who are onto him.

Thus a mysterious detective named L is assigned to the case and the series becomes a compelling storyline of will L find a way to catch Light Yagami or will Light Yagami kill L first?  Two geniuses trying to outwit the other in a thrilling storyline that is so unique, I'm confident in saying that it's one of the most original anime to come out in the last decade.

The volume 2 box set features the second half of the series  (17 episodes, Episodes 21-37 on four discs plus a bonus disc featuring the Japanese content that were on the Japanese DVD releases via English subtitles).  The first half featured L suspecting Light Yagami to be Kira and his girlfriend Misa Amane to be the second L.

AUDIO & VIDEO:

""Death Note"" was a TV series and I found the animation to be quite cool as it showcased a dark, stylish feel to it.  Featuring a good dose of J-rock and style to it's overall presentation, Studio Madhouse did a wonderful job in this series and bringing out the illustrations of Takeshi Obata and the storyline of Tsugumi Ohba to television.  The dark atmosphere really is well displayed in this anime series.

But the most appealing part of this series is the awesome voice acting.  Being the Japanese language purist that I am, I watched the series with Japanese voice acting and it was done very well.  But I have to admit that I was really impressed by the English dub voice acting.

Brad Swaile as Light Yagami, Battlestar Galactica actor (Felix Gaeta) Alesandro Juliani, Brian Drummond as Ryuk and Shannon Chan-Kent as Misa did a tremendous job.  As did the other English voice actors.  A job well done!

JUDGMENT CALL:

I can't tell you how awesome this TV series is.  ""Death Note"" is truly special as it really show how power can corrupt but taking that cat versus mouse type of storyline of two geniuses trying to outwit each other.  Whereas I enjoyed the first half of the series as it focused on Kira vs. L, the second half seemed to go slower in pace with the filler-like episodes that dealt with the Yotsuba Group.  But it took a few episodes to establish Light Yagami working in the Kira Task Force, working together with L and eventually having to watch as Light would try and succeed in winning everyone's trust.  Once episode 25 came, immediately the series went on overdrive as we started to see Light Yagami in a different light.  A man who has been consumed with power and now feeling he is invincible.

That is until he meets his match with ""N"" (Near).  Different styles of handling the investigation, to watch this cat vs. mouse storyline to now shift between L and N became quite enjoyable and suspenseful.  Especially to see how far Light would go to achieve his goals and the people close to him that he would use (or kill) in the process.  There are literally so many twists and turns in this anime series that it really captures your attention and has you on the edge of your seat.

As for the DVD box set, I think it's just great that Viz Media chose to release these episodes of the series and sell them in two box sets for a great price!  I definitely like Viz Media/Shonen Jump Home Video really doing anime fans a great service by following a US TV Season Box Set style of pricing instead of selling the episodes as separate volumes.  You're definitely getting your bang for the buck.

I thought it was an awesome touch for VIZ to include the fifth disc of special features that focus several of the Japanese features including the numerous interstitials.  I was very happy to see many Japanese special features (English subtitled) included with this box set.

I did wonder if the ""Death Note Rewrite"" OAV would be included in the box set but the two hour episode (Vol. 1) of Rewrite focusing on Ryuk's perspective will be released in the US on June 16, 2009.  There is no announcement of when the second ""Rewrite"" OAV will be released in the US.

Overall, ""DEATH NOTE"" is a well-acted anime series (on both the Japanese and English side of things), cool characters, well-written and suspenseful episodes, stylish animation and a unique, compelling anime series that I highly recommend from beginning to end.  Another wonderful release!",1241913600,19,11901,4.6183206106870225

Overall Rating 4/5
A notebook falls from the sky and this if found by a bored, high school genius Light Yagami.  The rules written on the inside cover include the title of this review, ""The human whose name is written in this note shall die.""

It's a story about shinigami, death gods, and one student who believe's he's the best judge, jury, and executioner.  An amazing show that pits the clever and dangerous Light Yagami against the great and secretive detective ""L"".  For a show that has this much death, there really isn't many fights to speak of.  The battle of wit and cunning drive the show to a unique drama and intensity that really can't be missed.

This is set 2 of 2.  The total show has 39 episodes.  I cant say I know the exact episode but part way there is a major change.  Ignore what you may have read online.  The show completes at 39.  It's still a solid show after this major event and of course it doesn't conclude until the end...

Theme Songs 5/5
The 2nd opening & ending to this show are excellent kind of heavy/goth metal music.  Among the best opening and ending themes of any anime.

Ending 4/5
NO spoilers, this is set 2 of 2. The total end was solid enough. It's about what you expect or the opposite.  The end concluded what it should, nothing more and nothing less.",1502668800,,1435,4.378787878787879
