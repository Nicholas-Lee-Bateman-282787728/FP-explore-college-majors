8331799,5,B001P06K1C,"This is a good documentary of the man that stood for truth, peace, equality, and justice in America. He lost in the 1968 bid for the White House, and we have seen how much Americans have paid for denying Humphrey the presidency. From his childjhood until his death he was a man that loved justice for all. He believed that every American should dine at Liberty's Table. We see a noble man with noble and high ideals living the life that he taught.",1393632000,,447,4.397590361445783
8331800,5,B001P06K1C,"Broke, harrassed by anti-war demonstrators, Hubert Humphrey's 1968 campaign began so far behind Richard Nixon that he was given only 28 sure electoral votes (that included his home state of Minessota) on the Labor Day kickoff. Refusing to accept defeat, HHH made a brilliant choice with his VP nominee Ed Muskie (compare and contrast Spiro Agnew)and hit the trail determined to ignite what he called ""the politics of joy."" Despite a 15% deficit at the polls, his party torn asunder by street riots and Vietnam, and the defection of blue collar and Southern voters to George Wallace, Humphrey almost closed the gap in a heart-on-the sleeve race to the finishing line that was to fall short, in the words of Theodore H White, by a margin only slightly more visible than that by which Nixon himself had lost in 1960.

This film, a wonderful timepiece of the last campaign ever involving a New Deal Democrat, is an indication of the talent that Humphrey could call upon even as the Democrats were in meltdown. The trouble was he had almost no money to pay for television airtime. The film cleverly ""humanizes"" the voluble Humphrey while showing how exceptional were his gifts as a legislator,reformer, visionary and advocate of America's highest values. It did what all good promotions do - it got people talking about this remarkable man, moved hearts and minds and was part of a campaign that fell just short of the biggest upset since Truman overcame Dewey. The film shows Hubert the Ordinary Guy, shirt sleeves rolled up and helping the neighbourhood; plays up Hubert the Underdog (conceding the odds and his empty bank balance);then really gains altitude with Hubert the Warrior for Equality and Justice, Hubert as Mr Fixit (the Vice President in back of the bowling alley with Muskie unjamming the pins after a malfunction)and finally Humphrey the Man You Can Trust, with an appeal to back his peace credentials, using a live clip of Humphrey (called by many the greatest orator in America)pledging world peace as the cause of his presidential life. Probably the most discussed part of the film is the most affecting, when Hubert introduces his retarded grandchild Vicki, and talks about the importance of love as a key to learning and empathy.
Joe Neopolitan was one of the key wizkids behind the  Humphrey surge at the end of October, when this and other very powerful political advertisements finally got some prime time. He and campaign director Lawrence O'Brien were adamant that, had they been able to get the kind of air-time they wanted in the final few weeks of the campaign, Humphrey would have overtaken Nixon.
Even after all these decades, you can watch this fascinating film and see how it ""pushes buttons"" for the housewife demographic, the anti-war liberals and the working class vote. It is worth study by advertsing and political science students, appealing to the head and the heart and pitching their very human candidate to be a man of the people. It was an appeal that the winner could hardly have made.",1302566400,4,3026,4.896686159844054
