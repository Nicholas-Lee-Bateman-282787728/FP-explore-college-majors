2780765,5,B000NSIZFQ,"I have seen this video many, many times! This video and Marty Goetz himself is blessed by God. The transformation that happens in the audience is the same one you will experience. As a pianist and vocalist myself, I can attest to his mastery and ability to inspire and entertain his audience. This is relevant for both Christians, Jews, and Messianic Jews. This is an excellent way to reach people of Jewish heritage and Marty is amazing at tying Judiasm to Christianity in a way that embraces the viewer's Judiasm and convincingly shows them why they need the Jesus. I am buying the DVD because my VHS tape is old and our VHS player is now broken. I am excited to get it to share with with my friends and family and share with others! Enjoy!....",1345680000,3,746,4.492647058823529
2780766,5,B000NSIZFQ,"GIVE ADONAI A POWERFUL HALLELUJAH!! Marty Goetz's Psalm Enchanted Evening has touched my heart many times over the years. There are those who sing well and give a great performance. But this is not just a performance.
Marty is filled with the Ruach HaKodesh!!!!! Oh what a difference the Ruach makes!
You get a double blessing of extra songs on this DVD album which were not on the VHS version. They also give you a bonus CD of 5 original songs!! I give  this a five star WOW  Wonderful, Overwhelming, Worship!!!",1340928000,,512,4.615384615384615
2780767,5,B000NSIZFQ,"It was nearing chores time and we had to leave our friend's house soon, when they kept begging us to just watch a little bit of Marty's performance.  We agreed to watch (just for a few minutes) and we fell in love with Marty's singing almost instantly.  Mr. Goetz has a deep love for His Creator and you can feel his love in the songs he's written.  We now own our own copy of ""Psalm Enchanted Evening"" and we like to turn it on and just listen to it while we work in the kitchen.  If you love God and love peaceful, yet deep songs, you will love this!",1196294400,7,552,4.036697247706422
