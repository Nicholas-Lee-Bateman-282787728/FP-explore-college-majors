6402899,4,B00K58HQXG,"I now own all the Pop Physique DVDs. Insta Pop and Iconic Physique follow the same general format- arm work, then hips and thighs, glutes, abs, stretch. There's a good mix of new moves and variations on moves you may have done in the other dvds (eg: perform on the mat rather than standing).

Each work out runs about an hour and are lead by Sam, the instructor from prior videos, with two new girls.  If you've been turned off by the lingerie-like outfits worn in prior videos, the Insta Pop workout has the most extreme clothing of the two dvds.",1404604800,,547,4.405940594059406
6402900,5,B00K58HQXG,"I got hooked on the original Pop Physique DVD set a couple months before becoming pregnant with my second child.  My favorite was Pop physique ""hardcore"", led by Karyn.  I worked out to Pop physique ""hardcore"" and ""original butt"" DVDs throughout my pregnancy by modifying moves (no twisting, obviously no abdominal exercises, taking breaks etc).  I loved the exercises, and longed for a new set of DVDs to come out.  A few months after my second child was born, I spotted these DVDs on Amazon and ordered them immediately.  They arrived within 5 days.

I have worked out to both DVDs and love them so far!  They are not harder or easier than the first Pop physique DVD sets - the exercises are just different and organized in a way that makes it do-able.  By the way, I LOVE the music - it is fast and a bit electronic/techno-ish so that might be a problem for some but I can't exercise to slow boring music.  I like the graffiti background and the outfits because they are more my style.  I was a little apprehensive at first because both DVDs are led by Sam and she wasn't my favorite.  (The previous reviewer said it's a different Sam but it is the same Sam... she's got more makeup on this time).

Insta Pop - a good all-over body workout.  It's got the usual pop physique sections: warm-up, planks, arms, butt/thighs, and abdominals.  I am thrilled that the abdominal exercises in this DVD is broken up in ways that are not repetitive because that was one section I wasn't super happy with ""hardcore"" DVD.  All the exercises made me shake in a very good way.

Iconic Physique - it has more floor exercises than Insta Pop for butt and thighs, but it is still an all-over body workout.  Arm workouts in any of the Pop physique DVDs can't be beat, by the way.  Hands down the best way to target back of the arms (aka ""bat wings"").
I am planning on alternating Insta Pop, Iconic Physique, and Hardcore to get my pre-pregnancy body back!  I am pretty much at my pre-pregnancy weight, but I still have the frumpy ""mom"" shape at 5 months post-partum.  :(",1403654400,10,2052,4.46505376344086
6402901,5,B00K58HQXG,"Well, I waited for what seemed like forever for someone else to review this before buying. I checked it out on youtube and it just looked too young for me. I love the other Pop Physique workouts and do them regularly, but the new instructor was really young and the graffiti background just made it  look like they were going for a different demographic (I'm pushing 40). Anyway, I finally broke down and bought it last week and was thrilled with these new workouts. The instructor (a different Sam) was pleasant and informative. The workouts were familiar, but had some new moves incorporated in them. I even learned a new tip from the Insta Pop ab section that I can use in my Physique 57 and Ballet Physique workouts. These dvds are well worth buying and will be going into my weekly rotation.  If you like the other Pop Physique workouts, you won't be disappointed in these new ones.",1403568000,6,887,4.572327044025157
8655896,5,B00K58HQXG,"Two of the best barre-at-home DVDs you could find. I have all of their DVDs and I like them all. These two are definitely harder than Cardio Butt School and Original Butt, but I cannot compare them with Hardcore DVD. IMO, Iconic Physique is easier than Insta Pop since it includes floor exercises (fetal position outer glutes and bridge tilts and tucks) which does not really elevate the heart rate and therefore less punishing. Insta Pop has an excellent Abs segment that covers all Lotte Berk and beyond. I think Insta Abs might be the best  Lotte Berk Abs work I have encountered in a DVD - right up there with Lotte Berk Hip Hugger Abs Bonus - . Thigh work in these two DVDs are milder than that of Hardcore where you do a lethal series of lunges. What I like the most is that verbal cues are so on the spot and perfect. You do not really see the screen and can get into a pose as you listen to Sam's instructions. In that sense, these DVDs can compete with a live barre class, and actually Insta Pop is way harder than some of the studio Pure Barre classes I  attended. Pop Physique people really emphasize the fact that you should be sucking your muscle into bone and you start to realize that you go deeper in the position and it gets really challenging. I use the information I got from these DVDs in Pure Barre classes. If you are a beginner, these are not suitable for you as they are very fast paced and require some degree of flexibility. If you are looking for something that can replicate a real barre class, then order without hesitation. I hope Pop Physique produces more DVDs like these...",1447977600,,1606,4.385906040268456
8655897,5,B00K58HQXG,I worked out with the hardcore DVD all the time and wanted something different to avoid boredom. To be honest I didn't love the 2 other DVDs in the original set and only used hardcore so I was a bit nervous to buy these because I thought they might be more of the same. I don't think either of them are as challenging as hardcore which is fine.  Instapop is a lighter version of hardcore and less time. I like the different floor moves on iconic physique. I feel like the time passed pretty quickly doing these and no dread factor.,1429142400,3,531,4.257425742574258
8655898,3,B00K58HQXG,"While I did find these fun,I felt my age while doing them,as the Instructors were old enough to be my daughters! I am always on the hunt for great lower body workouts,as my thighs are my trouble spot. While I did enjoy these workouts,after doing Tonique and Tracy Anderson on a regular basis,I just didn't feel challenged by them. I'm a busy mom of 3 and at the age of 48,I find that my body doesn't respond as easily when it comes to getting in shape. I need to be challenged in order to see results. After Tonique,other lower body workouts just don't seem to cut it. And although these workouts were fun,I could not relate to the Instructors or their clothes!",1428710400,2,661,4.426229508196721
8655899,4,B00K58HQXG,"These workouts are insane. Insta Pop is by far one of the most challenging routines I have ever done. If you can manage to keep up with them without shaking until you die (or just do some modified moves like I do), you will undoubtedly see results fast. I do NOT recommend these for inexperienced exercisers, they are serious business. If you haven't done these types of barre/ballet/pilates fusion workouts before, prepare to be very sore until you build your tolerance. Conversely, if you love these types of workouts, this is an excellent and challenging option that you will love.",1424736000,,584,4.85
8655900,2,B00K58HQXG,"This is a difficult review to write. I own all 5 DVDs now and really like the workouts. They are highly effective and perfectly suited to my body type. The Insta Pop and Iconic Physique DVDs are slightly more advanced than the previous 3. But you should get them if you really enjoy a challenge. I am very glad I did. Mostly.

The reason for the 2 stars: There is a fundamental issue with the Insta Pop DVD. They have used a much darker background on this set. Which is fine to change things around but makes it really difficult to see. The floor is black, the mats are black and their leg warmers are black. So if you were planking or doing push-ups and trying to follow the DVD while you are low on the ground you can barely tell what's going on as all the black aspects just blend in. (Yes, I turned up the brightness of my screen all the way) As compared to the previous 3 DVDs where the lighter background and colourful clothing provided a much better contrast and the movements were easy to follow.

In conclusion, I absolutely love the Pop Physique workouts and they are a great way to get my Pop dose as I do not live in the US. But this time their effort to stay trendy has made the workout more painful and not in a good way.",1423958400,3,1235,4.184873949579832
8655901,5,B00K58HQXG,"Absolutely love these workouts. I've been doing them for a couple of weeks now and I can already see the changes in my body. Bought them on a whim after seeing someone recommend the classes (but sadly I live too far away to attend them). Really glad I did, can not recommend them enough. The workouts are still very challenging for me, but the results are really starting to show- especially in my butt and thighs. Insta Pop is my favorite out of the two, but they are both really great. I completed P90X and got GREAT results, but was looking for something more 'girly' and this fits the bill. Sam is a fantastic instructor too! Thinking of ordering a couple of the others just to mix it up more. Order them now, you won't regret it :)",1420588800,,736,4.340579710144928

My butt,  thighs,  core TRICEPS everything is tightening and sculpting in an amazing way.  I've always had issues with my butt and thighs getting a little too bulky from just doing conventional workouts.  Adding pop physique to the mix has been a very rewarding challenge.",1405468800,8,361,4.819672131147541
