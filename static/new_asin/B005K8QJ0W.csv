4715623,1,B005K8QJ0W,"This film was made on the cheap, don't buy it! My friend used to work for Inovisim/Reagal. It's just a man in a Spongebob costume running around with a kid in Hollywood. It's filled with unnecessary toilet humor and cheap gags, the reason Reagal went out of business was because they were threatened lawsuit over this. I repeat, DO. NOT .

4715636,2,B005K8QJ0W,"I purchased this movie for my kids, and it is a dark ass movie. First off, the Disc has a very demonic picture of SpongeBob depicted. When put in the DVD player the movie proceeded like normal and it was like a normal episode of Spongebob. However, no music played throughout the whole intro. When the intro was done playing there was a select screen. It was a pitch black screen with one option only, play movie. There was absolutely no color. The beginning started with Spongebob walking down the street but, there was something different, there were no other fish and the sky was pitch black. Spongebob arrived at his destination, the Krusty Krab where he began his job. No one showed up all day. Spongebob then got curious what was going on so he went to Mr. Krabs office only to find his safe broken into and a note on the table that read ""There is no escape"". A loud shriek occurred and the screen went black. When we restarted the movie, there was a graphic picture of SpongeBob depicted on screen with blood. It was at this point we decided to go to the park instead. Since then we have returned this movie to the seller. Would not reccomend.",1479945600,,1150,4.429245283018868

4715639,5,B005K8QJ0W,i got this movie after 2 years of waiting for it and i loved it. I thought the ending was really dark though because of how seth died and platen made a clone  of seth so no one would know about seths death,1479513600,,205,3.7674418604651163

I think it's very cute but it starts off with a bad reputation were nobody cares for spongebob. This kid is very lucky to go with SpongBob. My daughter has a crush on the kid on the front cover. Everytime she sees him, she licks the screen and moans.

4715690,1,B005K8QJ0W,"I found this at Salvation Army, I bought it knowing that it was really hard to find. But my question is, why is this hard to find? It's just a horrible movie with just a guy in a store bought Spongebob costume walking around with this random kid.",1454716800,,246,4.145833333333333
4715691,1,B005K8QJ0W,"The movie was terrible. If you've ever watched ""Cool Cat Saves the Kids"" then you can infer what this movie is. The story was bland and many of the so-called action scenes were atrocious. Here's a good tip: don't buy it and don't watch it.

At least, that's what I would say if I actually had the movie myself :)",1454112000,,312,4.2
4715692,2,B005K8QJ0W,"There's no real movie on the disc, just a 3 minute promo trailer for the film. I shows some decent flash animation of both SpongeBob and Seth, a kid who gets to spend the day with him. The trailer didn't really make clear what the film was about and just showed the two walking around Bikini Bottom. But once the trailer ends, it just loops. I don't think this DVD was recorded properly, as it was a DVD-R with no label on the disc. One thing worth noting was it said in the trailer, ""Written by SpongeBob creator Stephen Hillenburg"" so maybe this movie would be good, if ot wasn't just a stupid trailer. I bought this DVD from a flea-market back in 2013, but never watched it until today. I at first thought it was a bootleg, but no, it's real.",1451433600,,745,4.253521126760563
4715693,1,B005K8QJ0W,"A Day With SpongeBob Squarepants: The Movie is an Unauthorized Mockumentary about a boy who wins the change to meet with Spongebob. Even though I'm a big film goer I rarely watch Unauthorized documentaries, much like how I don't buy unofficial JLS calendars in the Howard Center, but as this had the word Spongebob in it, within a heartbeat I payed 10 + god knows how much shipping to get this DVD imported into the UK. But was it worth it? Not really.

If you' haven't seen cult film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cool-Cat-Saves-the-Kids/dp/B00SLXRAGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cool Cat Saves the Kids</a>, watch the trailer. Then imagine cool cat being replaced with Spongebob, and that's what you get. It's all live action, no animation at all, and I'm pretty sure one of the scenes where Spongebob was in Universal Studios was questionable (a security guard starts to walk to the camera but then it quickly cuts off, that obviously wasn't part of the film). It's really unprofessional.

Talking about unprofessional, let's talk about the DVD itself - it's awful. The label comes off so easily and the cover looks like it was photocopied. The case is fine though, and it's a strange transparent orange.

The only reason why I haven't rated the film 1 star is because Spongebob drops the F-Bomb to Plankton (who looks strangely similar to Warwick Davis) close to the end of the film and it's hilarious. The title of this review is the exact line he used.

Avoid this like the plague.",1449187200,3,1531,5.112
4715694,2,B005K8QJ0W,"its a pretty cheap knock off film, like those knock off versions of pixar films.

4715696,1,B005K8QJ0W,"I could tell pretty quick into the movie that this was basically like one of those Asylum knock off films made just to trick people into buying them. I doubt they even got the rights from Nick to make this. I was guessing this came out around the time the first spongebob movie did, shocked to look it up on here and see its from 2011,",1448409600,2,335,4.090909090909091

It's not great and looks cheaply made.

8476561,1,B005K8QJ0W,Dont buy this movie unless you are 13 and up and don't get scared easily because in this movie your gonna be seeing a lot of crazy stuff happening yea the beginning of the movie is awesome but once the murdering part comes on I don't think thats fit for spongebob because hes a kids show and this movie was probably made by mistake thats why amazon took it off I don't think you can buy it anymore but like I said don't watch this movie unless you don't get easily scared,1514160000,,471,4.130434782608695

8476563,5,B005K8QJ0W,"This movie was a masterpiece! Absolutely brilliant work of art! You can tell all of the heart went into creating this movie by how good it is! There were so many great parts in the film that I really can't express which one was the best. Spongebob does it again in this action packed thriller horror film. One gripe I have with the film is that halfway through the movie, there was a brief moment where I needed to turn the television set off. My children were very scared when Spongebobs clone became too violent and murdered Patrick and Mister Krabs. Was it really necessary for that part to be in the film? It is acceptable that Glowing Spongebob resurrected them after collecting all of the Dragon-Sponges, but the death didn't need to be so gruesome. Now my son, Albert, has nightmares quite often. But my other son, Albert 2.0, seems to enjoy watching it over and over again.",1503532800,,881,4.547169811320755

8476565,1,B005K8QJ0W,"Okay. I never saw this movie, but I am just reading the description. ""In this mockumentary, SpongeBob lives above ground like all Hollywood superstars!"" okay, spongebob is not a Hollywood superstar, and he is not even real (he is a fictional character voiced by Tom Kenny). ""Afraid that SpongeBob is becoming old news,"" HE IS ON NICKELOEON 24/7, he is NOT becoming old news! ""His boss holds a contest called spend a day with spongebob"" okay, you mean his agent. ""This makes SpongeBob the talk of the town, as thousands of kids enter to win!"" you mean he's the talk of the town because of how annoying he is because he is always on Nickelodeon? ""The lucky winner is Seth, who is ecstatic about his day with SpongeBob."" Obviously that is a reference to the creator of SpongeBob, Stephen Hillenburg. ""However, the day becomes a roller coaster ride, as things don't go as planned."" Wow, I am so exited (sarcasam)! This movie is FAKE!",1495843200,,929,4.670731707317073

8476567,1,B005K8QJ0W,This movie is a joke. It has a plot that's basically a ripoff of the first authorized film it starts off with a bunch of fart jokes and the comedy is really lame. Don't buy this film. Also it makes a bunch of bad link in park references. Which is already a bad band. Also sponge bob is played by Bruce Willis. This movie is so bad it makes space chimps look good. Also it brings back a bunch of 2012 jokes. Review by Sheen,1489622400,4,422,3.976470588235294
