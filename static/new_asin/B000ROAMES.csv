2871885,5,B000ROAMES,"Loved it. I'm a birthmom also that has a great reunion. Hopefully records would be opened in all states, it really makes a world of difference to our emotions, to have the ability to learn about our children and our birthparents.",1425945600,3,229,4.609756097560975
2871886,5,B000ROAMES,Quite a touching story. It was put together well. My husband has commented a few times about what a good story and how well it was told.,1424476800,2,136,4.074074074074074
2871887,2,B000ROAMES,"I've struggled with the appropriate wording on this review, but after sleeping on it for a couple days, the one thing that keeps coming to mind is simply: propaganda.

Hear me out:

1. I understand the people featured are extremely religious, however, everything is about God, 'His' plan, etc...

2. Everything is very clean. I am not looking for a sob story, but it's as if they chose to gloss over the undoubtedly complicated emotions likely felt on behalf of the biological parents. I can't imagine everything was always so smiley and rosy. The birth father eludes to it, but that's as much as we hear.

3. Neat, pretty package, complete with a bow. No loose ends. No strings. No messy entanglements. Nothing but God being great and living his will. As an adopted child who is very much pro-adoption and has had a positive experience, I still think this was just too coated in sugar to feel anything for anyone involved.

I love documentaries and have recently been interested in those that tackle adoption. Unfortunately, this is not one I'd recommend unless you're simply looking for a heavily sugarcoated, almost nauseating look at reunion. If you're considering it for research purposes, I'd really look at some of the middle of the road blogs and forums that aren't at one extreme or the other. Adoption is a heated issue and unfortunately, you'll often find either the horror stories or the so-sweet-lets-fill-10-cavities type of story telling with little in-between.",1424044800,12,1476,4.935483870967742
2871888,1,B000ROAMES,"I am all for adoption and what this woman did. HOWEVER, what I strongly disagree with is the way she speaks of her religion thoroughout. Making personal choices and learning from them is something all humans go through--no need to justify it any other way. No one is perfect and being a good person and doing what was best for her in any current situation is all you need to know. Telling everyone that it was 'gods plan' always through a forced smile seems dis-genuine----I wish she felt comfortable enough with herself to show true emotion and reach a much broader audience.",1422230400,4,576,4.6568627450980395
2871889,4,B000ROAMES,beautiful story of God's grace and perfect plan that plays out over the course of decades in these families lives. such an encouragement and blessing to watch and learn from.,1421193600,,174,4.833333333333333
2871890,4,B000ROAMES,"It has been over a decade since I watched 'Reunion' on TV (I was in my teens then), yet I'll always remember it, especially since I have 2 small kids now. I'm always extra careful (maybe even paranoid) about cords, strings, ribbons, or any other strangulation hazards! Every night I inspect my kids' room for hazards because of this movie. I never leave them alone with toys that have cords attached to them. Who knows, this movie might have saved my kids' lives. I hope I'll never have to live the nightmare of losing a child like the main character did.
As for the plot, it was heartbreaking, tear-jerking and moving, especially for parents. It will make you want to hug your kids more. It was not my favorite movie, but one worth watching if you have kids or plan to have them.",1245888000,2,780,4.461538461538462
2871951,5,B000ROAMES,It touched my heart.,1458000000,,20,4.25
2871952,5,B000ROAMES,I really enjoyed this true story.,1455840000,,33,4.666666666666667
2871953,5,B000ROAMES,"Thank you for sharing such a beautiful personal story...the outcome of this adoption story is so miraculous and amazing. I found it very real, honest, and moving. Highly recommend if you enjoy true personal stories of God working in the lives of His people.",1454716800,,257,4.863636363636363
2871954,5,B000ROAMES,"I'm a mom who adopted my daughter and my adoption was all ""God's  plan"". Unless you understand how Christians think and feel about their walk with God I assume it's hard for someone to understand this documentary. This WAS NOT a show on religion it's a documentary about people of faith brought together threw having faith in God directing their path. Christians do not lean on their on understanding, nor understanding of man... It's an understanding of their faith of a feeling of ""it's going to b ok, I'm right here with u."" Our faith is our comfort and when you are in tune with that things just work out. It's not always rosy but you know you will be ok threw HIS GRACE. I wish all of you felt it ... It's an awesome feeling. Again awesome documentary.",1454371200,2,757,4.446043165467626
2871955,5,B000ROAMES,"Loved story.
Sad heart breaking but such a wonderful mother.",1453507200,,60,5.1
2871956,5,B000ROAMES,"A heart touching movie. This story truly captures God's redemptive love. It shows how he takes our choices and what could make us look at life in despair and turn them into beautiful things. It's also humbling because it shows that no one is above mistakes or making choices we are not ready for. Nonetheless, that should not cause us to give up, not giving our wrong-turns to God. At the same time, no child is a mistake. God has a purpose for every single one.",1453420800,3,462,4.383720930232558
2871957,2,B000ROAMES,"As an adopted person who reunited with her parents as an adult, I did not think this was a realistic presentation of that process. One glaring problem with this story is that they chose to give up the child when they clearly had the means and family support to keep her. This is all glossed over as Gods plan. I had to turn it off when the mother says in front of the child she gave away that she didn't regret her decision. The film seems to be more for the purpose of giving a format for the mother to witness to the public than about adoption. Anyone who is looking for any insight about adoption or reunification would be wasting their time watching this.",1450051200,2,659,4.28
2871958,2,B000ROAMES,"I really wanted to like this film but the religious overtones were a bit much. Every other word was a religious reference. While I too believe in God, the subject seemed to deflect on her very real and very immature decisions by saying that her premarital sex, teenage pregnancy, and subsequent adoption of her out-of-wedlock child were all part of ""God's plan.""",1440028800,3,362,4.854838709677419
2871959,5,B000ROAMES,"This film is so great. It is conversational in approach, and family friendly without glossing over the real life issues. It talks through issues of abortion and adoption and whether to keep a baby or give it up; all without judgement or condemnation, and loads of sympathy and love. Well done.",1439596800,2,293,4.764705882352941
2871960,5,B000ROAMES,Tears! What a beautiful story... and what an amazing family!,1438992000,,60,5.1
2871981,5,B000ROAMES,"This is the story of Kim and Duane Copple, of Salem, Oregon. It is an emotional and ultimately heartwarming film documenting their reunion with the child they gave up for adoption. It gives hope to those in similar situations, which is not surprising, as Kim has spent her life giving hope to those who need it. This is a special film about special people who give selflessly to others because they know firsthand what it is to need grace.",1438905600,3,439,4.569620253164557
2871982,5,B000ROAMES,"This amazing film confronts the consequences of sinful choices and the triumphant grace of God to rewrite a life's storyline in a miraculous, unforgettable, and moving fashion. I highly recommend this well-shot and engaging story!",1437955200,4,230,5.6
2871983,1,B000ROAMES,Religious documentary disguised as an adoption story.,1437004800,3,53,6.714285714285714
2871984,5,B000ROAMES,"Good message, fine for the family to learn about life together and have discussions about the decisions made",1436745600,,108,5.055555555555555
2871985,4,B000ROAMES,Excellently made documentary which shares the story of a young couple getting pregnant and making the painful decision to place there baby for adoption. I don't want to spoil the rest so I will not say too much but I do highly recommend this documentary depicting a tale of a young couple not ready for a child and years later coming together and finding home within one another..... I highly recommend.,1436400000,,403,4.690140845070423
2871986,4,B000ROAMES,"I thought it was a true movie, but it turned out to be people telling their story instead of a movie.  It was good.",1436400000,,115,3.7916666666666665
2871987,5,B000ROAMES,Beautiful love story on so many levels. With all the sadness and evil in this world it was such a blessing to see how wonderful life is when we let God lead our way. I enjoyed every moment of this movie.,1436054400,4,203,3.975609756097561
2871988,3,B000ROAMES,"this is a well done documentary, but i am an adoptive mother, so that certainly informs my take on birth family reunions.  didja see the sad look on the adoptive mom's face at the end of this movie?  she was being gracious, but really, if you think Mom is a thankless job just try Adoptive Mom.  Go ahead and give a kid a lifetime of your love and hard work, and then be a sport while s/he goes and has a ""joyous reunion"" with her ""real"" family.",1435622400,2,445,4.091954022988506
2871989,2,B000ROAMES,"About ""Secret"", I was very disappointed with the script, it gives the impression that it is unfinished. The beginning is promising, with Thomas Gibson, we know that the film will turn to romance ... then of Thomas, and the film only fall in an abyss ... I've never seen a movie, suicide alone.",1429142400,,293,4.547169811320755
2871990,5,B000ROAMES,"A great, God honoring story that was well told. It's more documentary style but the interviews were well done. I enjoyed this film and would recommend it.",1427932800,,154,4.7407407407407405

8201850,4,B000ROAMES,"Very sweet, heartwarming story.  Though all of life's stories don't end so well, this one is encouraging and hopefully teach us to be more supportive, helpful and less judging of others as they face difficult times and decisions in their lives.",1486166400,,244,4.951219512195122

8201852,1,B000ROAMES,This is just religious propaganda. They gloss over everything and make everything appear as if it is all rainbows and sunshine. There is just absolutely no depth to this movie.,1477353600,,176,4.9
8201853,5,B000ROAMES,God is so good. Kim and Duane were blessed. Sarah Ann and her adoptive parents were so good to share their lives with Kim and Duane. In time God's promises came through because Kim and Duane were patient and prayerful.,1472688000,,218,4.475
8201854,5,B000ROAMES,This was a very interesting sincere story.  I found myself very drawn to each character in the family and their feelings as the story unfolded. Everyone was so respectful of each other's feelings. I am glad I watched it,1471564800,,219,4.615384615384615
