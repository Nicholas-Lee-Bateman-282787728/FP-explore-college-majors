7295886,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,Fantastic!,1464566400,,10,10.0
7295887,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,Beautiful 3D.  Well worth the cost and I got it faster than waiting months for the American version that was never stocked.  Too bad our own country where these movies are made can't give us the collections we want.  The UK is getting all the sales.,1461283200,26,249,4.369565217391305
7295888,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"I bought the UK region free release because the american 3d version seems to be permanently ""out of stock"". This works fine and the 3d looks great.",1460073600,24,147,4.481481481481482
7295889,2,B00ZX1Y7KU,Part two disk of Unexpected Journey failed to play on my Samsung 3D Blu ray. Part one worked. My player said the disk had a defect and check for scratches. Brand new and no scratches were present.,1459900800,6,196,4.324324324324325
7295890,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,Finally the extended box set for real. I have been sold others that claimed to be it.,1458864000,8,85,4.0588235294117645

7295892,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,I realized that this trilogy set was a good price because it was designed for other then US regions. That Does Not Matter!!!  All movies played beautifully and with all extras included. Very happy and satisfied with this purchase. Love my LOTRs and Hobbit movies (extended editions only of course). Dont let the region designation dissuad you from purchase. It works just fine here in the great US of A.,1530576000,,403,4.757142857142857
7295893,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"Just as expected worked perfectly, beautiful set.",1528502400,,49,6.142857142857143
7295894,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,if you like the hobbit you will love the extended edition. a must have seller shipped em out quick.,1528243200,,99,4.2631578947368425
7295895,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"Purchased this set recently. The EU 3D set, and was very happy with it. We watched it over a three night period and really enjoyed it. Even though we had seen most of it before on TV, it was much better in 3D. All 3D discs were good, no problems. Can't say anything about the regular Blu-Ray as we didn't watch those.",1528243200,,317,4.129032258064516
7295896,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,The extended editions of these movies are far superior than the theater versions.  I thought the theater versions were entertaining but generally mediocre.  There is so much more material in the extended editions that really bring the this trilogy closer in depth and quality to the LOTR trilogy.,1528243200,,296,5.145833333333333
7295897,4,B00ZX1Y7KU,"Delivery was on time and discs play in the United States just fine, but the digital copy redeem code is for UK only for some reason. So one star off for that. If it says ""Region Free"" then the digital copy should be for the world as well.",1527379200,,238,3.9791666666666665

7295901,4,B00ZX1Y7KU,The graphics seem to be sharper than other Blu-ray discs I own. Amazing!! My children purchased this for Mother's Day and I love it! Only sad about the digital code not good for US. We only have one player in the house and I wish I could watch in my room. Not that big of a deal....,1526342400,,282,3.9649122807017543

7295904,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,excellent,1525737600,,9,9.0
7295905,3,B00ZX1Y7KU,I already had the box set however we wanted the 3D version. It was ok and not nearly as good as I was hoping. Too bad it was not filmed with 3D in mind. If I would have known that the 3D experience wasn't too great then I would have just stuck with the normal Bluray.,1525651200,,267,3.7857142857142856
7295906,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,The extended versions of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are the only ones you should buy.  The amount of added scenes is huge.  Just make sure you have all day to watch them.,1525305600,,176,4.0
7295907,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,Daughter loves them. Of course she is a huge Hobbit fan!,1525219200,,56,4.181818181818182
7295908,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,Excellent package with a lot of good background material.  The quality is superb.  Shame that the movies aren't better,1524614400,,118,5.157894736842105
7295909,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"Great price, and region free.  If you're sour about not getting a digital copy with this I feel like you're missing the point of owning physical copies...",1524528000,,154,4.703703703703703
7295910,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,If you have a ps4 or a bluray player that will play discs from any region it's great.,1524355200,,85,3.7777777777777777

7295912,4,B00ZX1Y7KU,"If you read the book, youll probably hate this trilogy. If you havent, then hey not bad!

The movies are actually pretty good if you watch is as exactly that, another trilogy movie. If you watch expecting the Hobbit brought to screen word by word and play by play, youll definitely be disappointed",1522108800,,297,4.60377358490566
7295913,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,Who doesn't love the Hobbit. You can't wrong with this set of movies.,1522108800,,69,4.384615384615385
7295914,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"Love the trilogy, came in great condition, and its a must buy!",1521849600,,62,4.25
7295915,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,So very Awesome and fast shipping.,1521504000,,34,4.833333333333333
7295916,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings are my favorite films. The Extended Edition fills in all the blanks in the storylines. This is the way the Hobbit should be watched.  Love it.,1520640000,,179,4.264705882352941
7295917,2,B00ZX1Y7KU,I'm returning and trying again. Or may even wait and see if a US version comes out. The box was fine. But I was not expecting the cases to be bulky and hard to open and close. Plus every disc has 'For rental or resale' printed on it. Which is not what I wanted. Also wasn't expecting numbers on the discs. The picture in the listing was misleading. They should post more so people know what to expect. Didnt even try to play it.,1519689600,3,428,4.107142857142857
7295918,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"I've only watched the first movie and accompanying bonus features so far, but I'm thrilled with them so far. The boxed set is stunningly beautiful. I've received several comments on it from friends just walking past the shelf it's on. (It shares the space with the Extended Edition Lord of the Rings Trilogy boxed set.) The discs are beautifully labeled with original artwork at a time when publishers think BluRays only merit a few words stamped in black text.

Each movie, with accompanying variants (BluRay, DVD, 3D) and extras, is individually encased in an oversized plastic disc case. This isn't as nice as my Harry Potter Hogwart's Edition, which has the entire collection in one cohesive binding, but it's okay. The three cases are then enclosed in the hard board storage box featuring very nice foiled artwork.

Unfortunately, I don't have a 3D TV yet, so can't say anything about the quality of those discs.

I managed to catch these on sale at Christmas, but even at the current full price ($48) I think this is a great deal.

As for the UV copies being restricted to the UK, do a Google search for changing your IP country ID. With just a little computer skill you can add them to your collection. But, even without them I feel this set is worth the price.",1519344000,2,1268,4.647321428571429
7295919,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"If you have the 3D TV and Glasses:  Wow!

I hope they do this for LOTR!

So many hours of ""making of"".",1519171200,,102,3.5454545454545454
7295920,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"All three blu-rays and the 3d versions played perfectly on my Xbox One. The packaging is fine. 3 plastic cases inside a box with a magnetic closure, just like the packaging for the LoTR Extended Edition.  This was my first purchase from this particular seller and I am very satisfied with the product I received.",1518998400,,312,4.672727272727273
7295921,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"Was a birthday gift, and the receiver loved it",1518739200,,46,4.222222222222222
7295922,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,Awesome!!,1518307200,,9,9.0
7295923,4,B00ZX1Y7KU,What's not to like about the Hobbit. The only thing that I don't care for is the case. It's too flimsy.,1518220800,,103,3.9523809523809526
7295924,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"This is pretty much the best version of these movies available. The edition is from the UK, but it's region free, so it's certain that it will work on any Blu-Ray player. It certainly worked on mine.
It comes with the extended versions of all three films. Each film contains five discs. Two discs for the 3D version of the film, one disc for the regular Blu-Ray version of the film, and two discs with all the extras.
The cases for all three movies are big and fat, which I find nice. It just makes the set look all the more epic. And yes, it all comes with the nice box with the magnet to open it up, not the cheap, flimsy cardboard case that is currently looming around in the US.
The only problem I have is that, as far as I understand, the cases for all three movies are supposed to be black. However, mine are just regular blue Blu-Ray cases. I don't think this is the seller's fault, however, nor do I think that this might be a bootleg copy of the film. My guess is that Warner Bros is distributing in the UK two versions of this set. One with the black cases, and another one with the blue cases. I just happened to get the version with the blue cases. The black cases look much more stylish and elegant, but nevertheless, this is an excellent, beautiful set and I'm very happy with my purchase.",1518134400,,1303,4.236947791164659
7295925,1,B00ZX1Y7KU,Didn't read fine print.  No UV.  SUCKS.,1517961600,2,39,4.428571428571429
7295926,1,B00ZX1Y7KU,Ive purchased 2 different versions of the UK 3D film & neither one played smoothly on my 3D blu Ray player.  Theres a lot of skipping and blurring in both films Ive tried.  I will NOT buy another UK version after twice being disappointed (Star Wars & Hobbit).,1517443200,3,259,4.375
7295927,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,Love my 3-D Samsung and really enjoy the great 3d effects on this set.,1517184000,,70,4.071428571428571
7295928,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"I actually ended up ordering this region-free version of The Hobbit as a replacement when the domestic Extended Edition I ordered arrived damaged. As it happened, I didn't get around to returning the domestic version until after this one arrived, and I was able to compare both sets disc by disc. They are IDENTICAL. ALL the features included in the domestic Extended Edition are included here: The Extended Editions of the movies (both standard Blu-Ray and 3D), and every bonus feature. What you don't get -- contrary to what some reviews state -- are DVD versions. Also, there is an Ultraviolet code for the entire Extended Edition Hobbit trilogy but apparently it does not work domestically (though some reviewers suggest there are fixes for that).

I was a bit concerned about buying this international region-free version, but rest easy: In addition to not missing any domestic content, all discs played fine in my Samsung Blu-Ray player. The 3D is well-done and absolutely awesome -- I literally believe I got my money's worth out of my new 3D TV just watching these movies. Also, if you've been considering upgrading to a larger TV, this collection is a reason to do so.

If you have a 3D TV, THIS is the set to buy! You will not be disappointed!",1517011200,13,1253,4.7695852534562215
7295929,4,B00ZX1Y7KU,"Item arrived on time, well packaged, brand new and in perfect playing condition. Cases, both the carton box and the plastic cases were tricky to open and very fragile and easily cracks. Item was purchased inexpensively.",1516838400,,219,5.111111111111111

7295931,3,B00ZX1Y7KU,"Some damage to the inside plastic of the cases. Overall, the casing was in decent shape, and all the discs tested so far are working without issues",1516665600,,147,4.481481481481482
7295932,4,B00ZX1Y7KU,Had to return. My son already had this movie. No problem returning.,1516579200,,67,4.666666666666667
7295933,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,Really great price for this set! I don't have 3D capability so the fact it includes the films on regular blu-rays(as well as the special features being on regular blu-rays) and all for around $60 is a godsend.,1516579200,,209,4.526315789473684

7295938,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"Love the movies, came on time. Just remember there is no digital version with this for US customers. Why I've deducted a star",1515974400,,125,4.478260869565218
7295939,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,This movie is SO much better in 3D!! Shipping was fast and in premium quality.,1515888000,,78,4.266666666666667
7295940,1,B00ZX1Y7KU,I didn't bother opening it because the corners are banged up,1515024000,2,60,4.545454545454546
7295941,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"So glad that I bought this. I was a little worried about it because it says 3D, BUT it does in fact come with a 2D version as well!! YAY! It plays just fine in my PS4 and my Xbox One. Perfect for any collector. There is a quite a bit of added footage as well. My set arrived in perfect condition. I am very please with it.

Side note, because it a regional copy of the trilogy, the digital code doesn't work, but I am not even worried about that at all. I am very happy with this purchase.",1514505600,,489,3.89

7295944,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"This is the set you want. I was going to buy the US version at Target for 63.00 before tax, but when I went back it was amiss. I read other reviews and ordered this set and its gorgeous. Packaging compliments the LOTR set nicely. The 3D is truly where it shines, though. Ive never been a massive 3D fan, but it totally compliments The Hobbit giving it an even more whimsical and magical land. From snowflakes to hummingbirds you'll say wow to yourself. No problems playing any of the discs. Ive heard about the Ultravoilet code not working, but I could care less about that. Highly recommend.",1513123200,7,592,4.4907407407407405
7295945,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,Excellent price for 3D. A great movie too.,1512777600,,42,4.375

7295947,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,Thumbs up. Took days and days to watch all the extras.,1511827200,,54,4.0
7295948,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"This is the best box set you can get for the hobbit trilogy. A must buy if you are a hardcore fan of J.R.R Tolkin's work.

All blu-rays work really great and the clarity is awesome.

Everything from preproduction to filming to post production and music and interviews are all included on this box set, basically the entire journey of the making the hobbit movie, so much so that at times may get tired, so hold on and get something to eat, seriously.",1510531200,,450,4.409638554216867
7295949,3,B00ZX1Y7KU,Why do I have to live in the UK or the Republic of Ireland to redeem the digital copy? I thought we were now a global society.,1510358400,2,126,3.7037037037037037
7295950,1,B00ZX1Y7KU,Item appeared to have been used. The set was not in shrink wrap at all. There were dents on all corners of the box and remnants of something like a sticker on the front of the box. There were broken plastic pieces inside some of the movie cases. The push button on some of the disks was broken so the dvd could not be released and the latches on some of the dvd pages were broken so you the disk page would just fall out and not allow you to flip to the next disc. Not sure why a new product would be in a state of such disrepair.,1509840000,10,530,3.871559633027523
7295951,2,B00ZX1Y7KU,"love the movies and all the extras - but NewsFlash: you need a 3D tv - you can't just use your regular tv with glasses.  If I had known that, I would not have spent this much on the set.",1509580800,,186,3.65
7295952,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"Watching this again but in 3D was like ""Wow"". No words to describe.",1509235200,,67,4.230769230769231
7295953,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"Love THE HOBBIT.  Too bad it took three movies to tell the story.  Anyway, it's nice that all three extended cuts are available in one set.  The 3-D is good and video quality is great.  Thanks",1508803200,,192,4.25
7295954,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,Loved that I was able to score these at a great price even if they are for the UK. The work fine in my Bluray Player and most importantly I was able to redeem the digital copies here in the US.,1508371200,2,193,3.731707317073171

Watching these reminds of the LOTR craze in theaters. So good.",1506211200,,155,4.2
7295960,4,B00ZX1Y7KU,It was a good series and entertaining but not nearly as good as the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.,1505952000,,94,4.0
7295961,4,B00ZX1Y7KU,I am glad that this extended 3D edition is region free. It plays without any problem in my US PS3 and PS4.  The packaging is not so great. It is far inferior compared to Lord of the Rings blu-ray extended edition. One of the boxes in the package came with broken ledge and I have lose disc trays in the box. Not very happy about it but I can live with that.,1505865600,,357,3.9583333333333335
7295962,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,Loved it! Didn't realize this was 3D edition though so we have Blue-Ray with 3D disks instead of Blue-Ray with DVD disks,1505779200,,120,4.5

The only reservation I have about the audio of the movies.  Since I do not have a home theater setup, I cannot confirm if these movies have audio 5.1, 7.1 or if it's DTS capable.  Otherwise, they are great.",1504483200,,376,4.095890410958904
7295969,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,The movies are enjoyable.,1504396800,,25,5.5
7295970,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"This is a fantastic package. Extended versions of all three movies in standard and 3D. You also get lots of bonuses for a total package of 15 discs. The appendix discs are 7-12. The Lorf of The Rings trilogy includes appendix discs 1-6 so this nicely continues what was started there. Also, one reviewer mentioned the box for this collection does not match the box for the LOTR trilogy but it matches perfectly with the one I have.

The film itself of course was gorgeous, but as an actual reader of Tolkien, I have to say Peter Jackson took considerable (too many) liberties with the original story, which was plenty exciting as it way.

i was bit skeptical to purchase this because 1. did not really enjoy normal version of the hobbit compared to Lord of the ring trialogy.  2. it's $50.  3. it's not US version of the disc.

Well, after I popped the first movie into my bluray players, I thoroughly enjoyed them all and when I realized I finished all 3 movies.
3D effect was great and well worth $50.  No problem what so ever w/ US spec bluray players (I tried using my ps4 pro and new lg 4k bluray player) or tv.

7296039,4,B00ZX1Y7KU,"Overall excellent product for the low price tag. As a resident of the USA, I was hesitant to purchase this ""Region Free / UK"" version for over a year. Now, I wish that we'd purchased it sooner!

Pros:
All BluRay, 3-D, & DVDs functioned flawlessly in our Samsung 3-D BluRay, Region-specific player (USA).  Also works in XBox One players (not tested with 3-D).

Includes all three distinct Hobbit films (Extended Editions) in 2-D BluRay, 3-D BluRay and regular DVD format. Includes additional disc content.  Discs are stored in three separate oversized plastic cases that fit into a single, nicely designed & glossed box case.

Cons:
Digital download / UltraViolet code will NOT work for purchasers outside of the UK Region. This ""Region Free"" version is great for the discs *only* and not the digital version.  An error code will appear when the code is entered outside of the UK Region.

Overall storage box is functional and looks nice but does not match the Lord of The Rings Extended Edition box (the US version does match that set).

There are no additional inserts, booklets, or memorabilia with this set.

Overall:
Outstanding value for this set at half the price of the US version. Highly recommend this purchase. Little disappointing that US residents can't seem to acquire our own set-matching version at a reasonable price but this is a 100% functional substitute.",1480118400,106,1374,4.939130434782609

My other player said no disk when I tried to play them on my secondary blu-ray player on my other TV and same results no disk detected... The solution was very simple turn off the player with the disk in the drawer and turn it back on and disk detected. More of a meh than really important to me...

I wanted to get the US version which had the same style as the LOTR extended trilogy on Blu-Ray (gold packaging). Not the end of the world, but I got used to the song and dance that comes with new LOTR/Hobbit movies coming out and having multiple releases so I expressly waited to buy the version that I wanted.

The discs themselves work in my Blu-Ray. My TV does not immediately detect the 3D, but we're able to toggle it off/on with our model, so it's okay. I haven't checked to see if the Ultraviolet digital content works, but I'm going to guess that it won't since it's a European code. For the cost I would have paid to buy the US versions individually (or the time I would continue to wait to see if they release another trilogy), I would rather have this version.

This set includes Euro release PEGI rated Region free discs.  They work great on my US Xbox One.

Includes all 3 Hobbit movies extended edition in 2D Blu-ray, 3D Blu-ray and DVD.  Each movie is in its own oversized multi-disc plastic box, all encased in a nicely printed cardboard holding box.  The lid folds out to reveal a map of Middle-Earth.

Each movie also comes with a ton of extra features on separate DVDs - all the appendices they made.

The 3D is fantastic.  For the complaint that it only works with a 3D TV / setup, that's true for only the 3D discs, make sure you are using the 2D blu ray discs.

If you were looking for the full package, this is it!",1472428800,217,791,4.248322147651007
7296054,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"I love these 3D extendedmovies, but I write to warn you about the dangerous way that the 3D disks are stored which can lead to scratched disks.
There are two defects in the 3 plastic boxes holding the disks. The first is loose center hubs. The second is a poorly designed hinge which can scratch a disk which has come loose due to a loose center hub. I have had to resort to storing the 3D disks and commentary diisk in spare bluray boxes that only house 3 disks.",1471046400,14,463,4.213483146067416

8721083,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"Some people may not have liked the Hobbit films as much as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but I love any excuse to bring my mind back into Middle-Earth. This set exceeded expectations after I had a hard time finding the separate extended editions. It comes with pretty great packaging and plenty of appendices to explore, which is what I look for when I'm looking for my extended edition Tolkien based movies. If your a fan, put this in your cart and same day them asap. I promise you won't regret it. I loved this so much, I just bought I second to send to my best friend.",1531526400,,573,4.26605504587156

8721085,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"I'm not gone review the movie in details,as it's been done sufficiently. I'll just say that I find the Hobbit Trilogy awesome, and a must to watch, if you loved the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Here is what i think about buying this Extended Blu-Ray Edition:
This is a movie that is worth having in Blu-ray! In my opinion, it's a must! I made the mistake to buy the Dvd format, and the quality isn't there. For such movie, there's a need for the Blu-ray quality which gives you a super crisp image even in the dark scenes, and so much more pleasure with the beautiful sceneries. The sound is great also. As for the additional scenes coming with this edition; they are worth having. Just like having the extended edition of the Lord of The Rings; it's a treat!",1531353600,,757,4.375886524822695

8721088,5,B00ZX1Y7KU,"This edition is great. The one I got is as pictured, with a UK UV digital code. Ive only watched the first disc (3D) but have no reason to think any of them won't work in the US (watching on PS4).
As for the UV code, simply reach out to WB customer support by submitting an online ticket. They will have you provide some verification, but I got my US UV code within an hour or two. Not so hard. :-)",1530835200,3,398,3.925925925925926
