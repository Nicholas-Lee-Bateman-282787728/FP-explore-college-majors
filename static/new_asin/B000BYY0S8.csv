It is emotionally very complex, it explores love and passion at it's most extreme and its cinematography is breathtaking. The writing, production design, costumes and music are first rate. Terrific production values!
There are more memorable characters in this one two hour movie that in all the movies I have seen from the year 2001. Great cast! Keith Carradine is marvellous as Dan Scott. Young Mia Kirshner is fantastic! Other parts are wonderful too. There is not a single bad perfomance in this film.
This movie combines action, love, tragedy, drama and politics all in one. Funny, tragic and human you name it.
What makes this film really precious to me is that it brings to the surface the best feelings that we miss in our everyday life -love, sympathy and faith.
After watching this movie one feels really clansed and elevated. In one word it's a must - see movie!",1010707200,12,1071,4.732620320855615
8094553,5,B000BYY0S8,"This terrific new drama directed by Sasha Buravsky and written by Sasha Buravsky and Alex Kustanovich is about Dan Scott, a down and out American tap dancer, who goes to Estonia on the verge of World War II to revive his career and ends by fighting for his life. Aside from a passionate love story, which is the engine of this powerful picture, there are plot twists and turns that take us into the heart of political power struggle among three nations as well as one courageous human being's firght for survival. By the time the movie is over, you'll realize that you've experienced something rarely seen on the big (or small) screen. This movie is a winner! I strongly reccomend it!",1005177600,13,684,4.614754098360656
