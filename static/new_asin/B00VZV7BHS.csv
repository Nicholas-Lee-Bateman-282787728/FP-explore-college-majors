7114107,5,B00VZV7BHS,"This DVD is very relaxing, it is something special. You can choose the noise rain and thunder, this creates a tranquil atmosphere. Although thunder and rain are not exactly reassuring, the noise from the DVD spreads warmth and security. You directly want to take your book and your blanket and snuggle into it. There is also the possibility of seeing the fireplaces with fire crackle or with music (and rain or thunder). The nice thing is that you know that nothing can happen in this storm, because it's not real. You can also view this DVD normally (without storm noises). I enjoyed it very much. This is definitely an enrichment to my fireplace DVD collection.",1432512000,5,663,4.773913043478261

7114115,5,B00VZV7BHS,Super cool! Really soothing. The rain sounds are perfect!,1451433600,,57,5.444444444444445
7114116,5,B00VZV7BHS,"I have many of this company's fireplace DVDS and love the cozy feeling you get from hearing the sounds, but this one just became my favorite. There is nothing more relaxing than watching and listening to a fireplace crackling. Add the sound of thunder (which is not too loud), and it becomes even better for me. The photography is wonderful, the fire fills the screen, and the choice of sounds chosen was perfect. All I need with this is a good book and a comfortable chair to curl up in. Pure bliss! Great job!!",1433894400,7,512,4.457446808510638
7114117,5,B00VZV7BHS,"This DVD gives me a delightfully relaxed feeling.  I like the choice of different soundtracks  fire, music, thunder and rain  which enhance my enjoyment.  I also enjoy the wonderful crackling sound of the logs burning, and as the fire gradually diminishes I do not have to be concerned about replenishing the logs.

I play this disc for my own entertainment, and I also find it fun when entertaining guests  either at dinner or as we relax and chat over drinks and snacks.

These scenes have superb ambience making them very enjoyable.  Its lovely for me to sit back and experience a deep, restful time without having to think about going out and getting logs to feed the fire.

I find this disc great to play on a cold winters evening: I feel that it really warms me up while I read or listen to music.  One not to be missed!",1433808000,8,826,4.446666666666666
8711753,5,B00VZV7BHS,"Excellent. Each track can repeat over and over again which is wonderful. The look and the sounds are realistic and calming. Sound choices include fire and thunder, fire and rain, cracklings fire, and others. One cold night I plan to light some candles to accompany this as it
plays on the bedroom television. It will make for a cozy night indoors!",1516060800,,347,4.704918032786885
8711754,3,B00VZV7BHS,I expected a little more realism than I have so far experienced.  Haven't heard enough rain and thunder.,1498348800,,104,4.777777777777778
8711755,2,B00VZV7BHS,"You can find the same thing on YouTube for free. I don't know what I was expecting, really. I'm not thrilled with it. :-/",1487116800,,121,4.083333333333333
8711756,5,B00VZV7BHS,Love all the ambient collection dvds.  This is equally as awesome as the others I have purchased.,1485820800,,97,4.705882352941177
8711757,5,B00VZV7BHS,Great DVD.  Perfect for Christmas Eve.  Have it going often.  Even though there is no heat included...,1483833600,,102,4.882352941176471

8711759,3,B00VZV7BHS,"I also own HD Moods Fireplace.  In comparing, Fire DVD is a roaring fire and the viewer is very close to the fire.  HD Moods is pulled back to see the fireplace too and is not as ""roaring"" ( gentler?) . I'll be playing the HD Moods more. Not sure yet if I needed the rain and thunder but a nice option. You can choose to play ""fire"" only too on the disc.",1477612800,5,354,3.835616438356164
8711760,5,B00VZV7BHS,"There's one logset on this DVD I really like. It goes from a fire beginning, to raging, and slowly burns itself almost all the way out. The sound mix is perfect and important. I have another fireplace dvd where the sound is simply on a short loop and it's way overpowering and obvious that it's constantly repeating after a few minutes. The audio mix options of rain, thunder, just crackling, and/or very cool kinda new age-y music makes it a winner. Visually, it's excellent. Perfect for fall & winter.",1477353600,7,503,4.662921348314606
8711761,5,B00VZV7BHS,I really enjoy this DVD!! It will restart when it's over so it continues with out interrupted!!,1472256000,3,95,4.647058823529412
