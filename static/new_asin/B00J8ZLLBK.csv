8648814,3,B00J8ZLLBK,"This 1942 black and white film about the ex-thief now known as Boston Blackie is one of over a dozen films made of this private eye who is successful because he has many underworld people he can contact because of his early crimes and years in prison. In this film, he wants to delight his former friends in prison by bringing them a show. Two cops come along because they do not trust Blackie. During the show, one of the inmates knocks out the clown in the show and puts on his costume and uses it to escape. This inmate claims he was framed by two men and is innocent. He wants to get out so that he can kill the two men. The cops think Blackie planed and aided the escape. There is much humor in the show. It reminds me of the Keystone Cop films. Some viewers may think the film is too silly to be funny.",1497139200,,808,4.088050314465409
8648815,3,B00J8ZLLBK,"Chalk up ALIAS BOSTON BLACKIE (1942) as one more fun B-movie experience. It's the third in Columbia's string of fourteen pictures about an international safecracker turned crimesolver. It's a familiar plot in which a crime is perpetrated and Blackie is suspected and so must outsmart the coppers and solve the case to clear his name.

This time out, Blackie arranges for a troupe of entertainers to perform for his old pals behind bars, give 'em some holiday cheer, y'know. But Blackie and shady shenanigans go hand in hand, never mind that Blackie's earnest about keeping his nose clean. Maybe he should've paid closer attention to showgirl Eve Sanders (Adele Mara) who's all twitchy over her brother Joe (Larry Parks). Joe is an inmate in that same penitentiary and rarin' to break out of stir and plug the two punks what framed him. Oh, Joe, if only there was a distraction or, better yet, a visitor covered in clown make-up with which Joe can violently swap places. Cue the tumbling jester, Roggi McKay. You can guess what happens.

Of course the daring prison break implicates Boston Blackie, and so there he goes chasing after leads and playing cat-and-mouse games with his dear frienemy Inspector Faraday (Richard Lane).

The behind-the-scenes story is pretty interesting. Boston Blackie was created by Jack Boyle, a New York newspaperman who was an opium junkie and who ended up serving a prison term. Whilst locked away, Boyle wrote his first Boston Blackie story and, as they say, write what you know, Jack. So Blackie started out as a criminal and a drug addict. As Boyle went about piecing his life back together and kicking the habit, so, too, did Blackie in proseland.

I won't say that ALIAS BOSTON BLACKIE is the best of the bunch; it's as good as most other B-movie crime dramas. Oh, this one may flaunt more impersonations and more folks getting hogtied. And Blackie loses a scrap with a clown! Chester Morris is a pretty smooth operator with the swagger and the physique to pull off the dashing crimestopper role. Most of the comic beats are courtesy of Blackie's bumbly sidekick, ""Runt"" (George E. Stone), himself an ex-crook. Also, blink and you'll miss a cameo by future star Lloyd Bridges (he's the bus driver).",1450656000,,2234,4.8556430446194225
