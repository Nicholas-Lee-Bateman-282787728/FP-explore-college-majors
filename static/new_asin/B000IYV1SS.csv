2664298,5,B000IYV1SS,"Fantastic. The costumes and sound effects(buzzing rockets!) are part of what makes these old films so enjoyable. Best of all, the rockets, showering sparks and buzzing like bees, are just as I remember them from watching as a child. Forget about the dodgy science and hilarious storyline and just enjoy it.",1407456000,,306,5.019607843137255

 they make him more human and a more realistic character with a splash of sci-fi. I love it!",1405209600,2,176,4.0285714285714285
2664301,1,B000IYV1SS,"I ordered without realizing this was the EU version which is not compatible with the DVD it was purchased to run on .
I plan on having it converted which will cost more money, but it is for someone who is ill and has a passion for Flash Gordon from long ago.  I gather after two attempts to purchase the series this isn't going to be available any longer???",1405036800,2,357,4.173913043478261

8147803,4,B000IYV1SS,Problems with playing on regular players can be resolved by viewing it on your computers DVD drive. A cable connection to a flat screen TV makes it even better. Years ago I watched a complete region 4 series on my computer of a newer release that I accidentally purchased online that was PAL 4. One of the kids stuck it in my computers DVD drive and started playing it on my VCD video player program (a free downloads online). Turned out to be pleasant surprise that makes it possible to watch region restricted DVD's.,1451952000,2,518,4.5212765957446805
8147804,3,B000IYV1SS,"Buster Crabbe's Flash Gordon serials are terrific, and while the same can't honestly be said for Elstree Hill's DVD set, ASIN: B000IYV1SS, it contains some interesting editions of the ""classics"" especially for those who remember when they were run on television, starting in the 1950's.  But the four disc set from Image/Madacy, ASIN: B00A04YHI2 is preferable for completeness and transfer quality.

Elstree Hill's discs are ""all region"" but in PAL format, making them incompatible with most Region 1 players sold in North America.  They will work on ""all region"" players, but the second serial especially will have smoother motion if viewed in ""PAL"" video mode, at 25 frames per second since most of it had already been through a frame-rate conversion from the film.  As with television broadcasts in the UK, many chapters were transferred with the film run at 25 instead of 24 frames per second to avoid the ""telecine judder"" problem, though this raises the pitch of the sound 4%, slightly affecting the quality of voices.  A more-serious problem is that some chapters, mostly in the third serial are missing significant pieces likely due to editing of the source prints to fit a television schedule.  There are seven discs, all single-layer.  The packaging looks good and is efficient in storage space, but access to the discs is awkward because they are arranged two per ""page"" and overlap, and they are difficult to remove from the hubs.  But despite these issues, the alternate source prints are of interest and the first two serials were transferred fairly well.

The first serial is from earlier television prints, with the alternate title, ""Space Soldiers"" in the same style as the 1936 ""Flash Gordon"" original, noted as a ""Motion Pictures for Television"" release.  Later prints had more-generic titles headed ""King Features Presents"" and added narration to the chapter introductions.  All chapters are run 4% fast, and the ""next week"" titles are missing.  A couple short pieces were edited out of the first chapter, including the stock footage used to show ""chaos around the world,"" but the rest of the serial is reasonably complete.  The picture quality is decent, and while there is some distortion in the sound common to prints of this serial, it is no worse than in the Image/Madacy set.

""Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars"" from 1938 has the best picture quality of the three, with most chapters from prints as complete and otherwise similar to the ones in the Image/Madacy set, with the original serial title.  Unfortunately this means that Chapter Three has the same 70-second piece missing where a pursuing Martian Stratosled is shot down.  All but three chapters were transferred at the original speed with proper frame-rate conversion.  The exceptions that run 4% fast are Chapters Seven, Ten and Thirteen, the last of these from the television edition ""Space Soldiers' Trip to Mars"" in a later print with the chapter introduction narrated.  The sound throughout is too loud, adding a little distortion to a soundtrack that already had problems, but the dialogue remains clear enough.

Elstree Hill's transfer of the last serial is quite a mess.  Most of it is from the later ""King Features Presents"" television prints, renamed ""Space Soldiers Conquer the Universe"" and as was done with the these, generic ""The End"" titles replace the ""Next Week"" ones that had the chapter titles.  Despite the film being run at the ""PAL"" frame rate some jerky movement is apparent in the crowd scenes of the first chapter, possibly caused by other editing for television use.  Most of the chapters are significanly shorter than they would be by the 4% speed-up alone.  More than 20% is missing from Chapters Two, Three and Eleven, this last one lacking the set-up for the cliffhanger, where Emperor Ming demonstrates a security device, an electrified rug.  Picture quality is not very good on most of this serial, looking rather ""gray,"" somewhat unsharp and a little large for the screen.  Also, the sound in the left-channel goes away in several chapters, only an annoyance since the sound is monaural.  But in the middle of this fiasco, a surprise: Chapter Seven is from an old ""Motion Pictures for Television"" print, main title resembling the original of the 1940 serial, without the narration during the introduction.  The picture quality is better than the other chapters, and it is complete, aside from the 4% speed increase and lack of sound in the left channel.

For those who really need to have a ""PAL"" format edition of these serials, this release isn't too bad for the first two of them, and despite the faults I like having the chapters with the television titles available.  But for the more-usual purpose of watching the serials, the Image/Madacy set is a far better choice.",1445731200,,4787,4.993702770780857

However when played on a portable DVD player, the actors were timeless, I did not watch when I was growing up I was younger but I enjoyed the corny skids in the movies.",1416182400,,412,4.036585365853658
