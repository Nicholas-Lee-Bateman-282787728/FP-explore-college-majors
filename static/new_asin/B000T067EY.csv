8207140,5,B000T067EY,"Salvador Sanchez, with his almost 'fro and that stoic demeanor, knew how to put on a good show, and then he knew how to close the show. This DVD showcases two of his fights, first the water cooler classic versus Azumah Nelson, then the tough fifteen rounder with Patrick Ford.

When WBC featherweight champion Salvador Sanchez fought young up-and-comer Azumah Nelson, no one had a clue that ""the Professor"" would be this competitive and this full of fight. A virtual unknown outside of his native Ghana, Azumah Nelson was undefeated at 13-0 with 10 KOs, and on July 21, 1982, in Madison Square Garden, he shocked everyone by standing toe to toe with Sanchez and giving him all he could handle and then some. Nelson had no fear and sought to furiously trade leather with Sanchez, and he also mixed in a concerted body attack  He was the clear aggressor, with Sanchez counterpunching, poker face intact. Sanchez maintained his poise, but this was probably the closest to being out of sorts I've ever seen the young Mexican warrior.

Nelson connected enough and his punches were stinging enough that surely, somewhen in this, Sanchez must have gotten hurt or at least stunned. But, again demonstrating that mighty, mighty chin, Sanchez refused to show whenever he got rocked. And then in round seven, a Sanchez left hook would stagger Nelson into the ropes. Moments later another left hook would send him down. But the warrior from Ghana got up, and for him it was back to business as usual, Nelson on the attack and throwing punches in bunches, like he had a quota or something. But the Professor got wobbled again in the eight stanza, and I wonder what the scoring from the judges was on this very good scrap, because until the 15th round swung around, this was just about anyone's fight, with perhaps Sanchez's power carrying the argument in his favor. Still, there were heaps of spirited exchanges.

In the 15th round, Sanchez began to really tee off and Nelson's legs began to get all noodly. Then came an ungodly left hook from Sanchez, who would cap off his flurry with a sizzling left sort of uppercut which would crumble Nelson to the canvas with only seconds left in the bout. Azumah Nelson, whose right eye had closed up, simply couldn't see the left hooks coming. Moments later, the ref stepped in to wave it off.

The image quality is actually not bad for this fight, considering it took place almost three decades ago. What really blows is that the audio is horrible in terms of the fight commentary. The commentators' voices are mostly muffled as something seemed hinky with their microphones. Still, a classic fight.

Another guy who gave Sanchez all kinds of fits was the undefeated, rangy Guyanan, Patrick Ford. This rigorous fifteen rounder took place on September 13, 1980 in San Antonio, Texas, and this was the champion's third defense of his WBC belt and Sanchez riding high on having just dished out a repeat beatdown of Danny ""Little Red"" Lopez. But Mr. Ford wouldn't be a cakewalk. Howard Cosell - who called this fight - would quote famed trainer Angelo Dundee as having labeled Ford ""the hardest punching featherweight and lightweight he has seen presently fighting."" Ford, the taller combatant (a 5'10"" featherweight to Sanchez's 5'6"" and a half), utilized his reach and worked out of his long left jab and had Sanchez's nose bleeding by the third round.

Sanchez always was a patient cat, and he'd bide his time if he had to and would sooner or later break down his opponent. Against Ford, it wasn't until the later rounds that he really started landing his shots - his right hand lead was again key - and gradually the momentum irrevocably shifted his way. For most of the fight, the Guyanan's very good skills and ability to soak in Sanchez's punishment kept him near on pace with the champ. But, okay, you do notice, in the last three or four rounds, that Ford was backpedaling more and more, but still boxing and even occasionally still throwing shots, but the shots were getting more wild and looping. Sanchez would really dominate the final round, a punctuation to the split decision he would earn. And the previously undefeated Patrick Ford, who showed such promise? In retrospect it's unfortunate that his career ultimately didn't amount to much. His final boxing record: 21 fights, with 17 wins and 4 losses. Unmemorable.",1265932800,5,4357,4.785904255319149
