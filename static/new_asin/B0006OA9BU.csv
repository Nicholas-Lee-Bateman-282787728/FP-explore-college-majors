8041979,5,B0006OA9BU,Very good package.  Lots to learn here.  Wealth of on-line supplement.  You get way more than your money here.,1520467200,,110,4.684210526315789
8041980,4,B0006OA9BU,"Very good instructional DVD! Easy to learn from, highly recommended.",1474934400,,68,5.9
8041981,5,B0006OA9BU,"This is the one for intermediate players, perfect for those who have plateau problems and want to go from campfire good to garage band/songwriting good in a few weeks.  I was stuck at not bad for a year, then i bought this dvd, I've just started but already I've made more ground in a couple of weeks than I had in the last 6 months. Also, they have excellent customer support. When I'm ready for advanced instruction, Icons of Rock will be my first stop. There is one bad review on here and I smell a rat. My only complaint is not enough slow-mo. But I have hand issues from army and sports injuries so that's just me probably. A normal intermediate player with working hands would find this dvd right in the sweet spot between too easy and too advanced.",1276128000,2,755,4.3546099290780145
8041982,1,B0006OA9BU,"PLEASE CONSIDER THIS WARNING.
I bought this DVD hoping to learn from it. This is difficult because the volume of the vocal is so much lower than the volume of the guitar being played by the ""instructor"".

Those who can do, those who can't teach. BOTH SHOULD FIND A GOOD AUDIO VIDEO PERSON FOR RECORDINGS THEY PLAN TO SELL!!!

8041983,5,B0006OA9BU,"This is a great intro into playing lead guitar. It is easy to follow along with Greg. He explains different lead shapes and scales to keep you busy for a long time. I highly recomend this to anyone who wants to learn lead guitar. I'm not sure why someone would call it ""pure junk"". maybe because they have been playing for 30 years. If you want to play lead guitar this is the way to go.",1156723200,2,387,4.105263157894737
8041984,1,B0006OA9BU,"I have to admit, this is the worst guitar instructional video I have ever had the displeasure of viewing.  I am 41 and have been playing guitar for 30 years, and I occasionally buy instructional videos to get out of a rut. The instructor (Greg Douglass), albeit an OK guitarist 25 years ago, is almost lifeless and is unable to present the material.

The DVD shows a couple of crappy solos solely based on the minor pentatonic scale in a few positions.  To make matters worse, the instructor has come up with his nomenclature for lead patterns like Gminor position in A which is confusing as hell.

Bottom Line: pure crap.  I threw my DVD away, I would not wish this DVD on anyone.  I apologize for being so negative, but I hate getting duked on material off Amazon that has a great description and pretty cover.",1156291200,7,812,4.489795918367347
8041985,5,B0006OA9BU,"I have always wanted to play lead guitar and after purchasing this dvd and watching it, man it was hard to put down my les paul custom.",1143849600,5,135,4.037037037037037
8041986,5,B0006OA9BU,"This is the second DVD I have purchased by this company and I was very happy with both DVD's. They are not only easy to follow, but also come with access to their website where I could download lessons and chord charts. Greg Doulass was entertaining and knew what he was talking about. I will keep looking for more DVD's by this company.",1130284800,4,337,4.365079365079365
8041987,2,B0006OA9BU,"This is one of the best instructional videos I have bought--and I have bought a lot. Greg is skilled, but he shows you simple and slow ways of making each song sound great. His style is easy to follow and he makes it fun. I have improved very noticably since I started working with Greg on this DVD. I would recommend it to anyone. Greg rocks!",1119225600,2,343,4.212121212121212
