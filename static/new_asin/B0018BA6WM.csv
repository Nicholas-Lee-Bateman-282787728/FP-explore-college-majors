3414362,4,B0018BA6WM,"Both of my boys have loved the Wiggles for the past few years.  They are very talented songwriters and singers.  I personally think that Sam sings better than Greg ever did -- you know, it's become the whole Sammy Hagar vs. David Lee Roth thing for the preschool set.  Unfortunately, I think their popularity in the states is waning.  This has everything to do with Playhouse Disney.  When our oldest boy was born in 2003, the Wiggles were on practically all morning.  Disney realized they were missing out on merchandising and began to create more and more shows of their own with their own sets of toys and clothes tie-ins.  The means that the Wiggles have been banished to 6 a.m. (Central time) and they are not seen as often.  Even then, Disney only shows older shows that still have Greg, so it is very confusing for preschoolers to see Sam on the videos now.  Now Disney has given the Imagination Movers their own show and I suspect they will phase out the Wiggles almost entirely.  Too bad.  Their show is pretty fun.

Now to the video.  It is very colorful and well produced and the Beatles outfits and wigs cracked me up.  If you can get past a very scary looking aged Leo Sayer doing his best falsetto on the first song, then your children will most likely enjoy this DVD.",1218499200,7,1282,4.469827586206897
3414363,5,B0018BA6WM,"My 3 year old loves this video! We didn't know about this video until we heard a few of the songs at a recent Wiggles concert. The whole video is upbeat, fun, and makes you want to get up and dance. My son keeps singing ""You make me feel like dancing"" over and over.

At the end of the video the Wiggles appear in regular clothes and talk about what they liked about doing the video. My kids don't seem to care much for that part, but I really liked it. Also, Anthony's son (super cute!) appears a few times, and the guy who plays Captain Feathersword appears as a 1950's emcee dressed in a regular suit.

I only wish that Sam was the lead singer in the opening song. We heard Sam sing the ""You Make Me Feeling Like Dancing"" song at the Wiggles concert, and he was awesome. On the video, though, Leo Sayer sings his song. He's great, but my kids don't know who he is, and frankly, neither did I, until others told me. (Okay, so maybe I live under a rock...)

One other small thing, on Dr. Knickerbocker, Sam counts to 9 with his fingers in such a way that you can't see his 9th finger very well (holds pinkie down on one hand instead of holding his thumb down). For a song like this where counting to 9 is a central part of the song, it is a bit annoying that he doesn't hold up 9 fingers clearly. The song, though, is one of our favorites.

As usual, all the Wiggles look like they are having a fantastic time, and their enthusiasm is contagious. This is one of our favorite Wiggles videos!",1218326400,2,1491,4.166666666666667
3414364,5,B0018BA6WM,"We just got this DVD yesterday and my almost 2 year old and 4.5 year old love it.  They have been dancing and singing all day.  I hate to admit this but I used it as a babysitter this AM while I cleaned and didn't even feel bad because they were laughing and dancing the whole time and made me repeat ""One Finger, One Thumb"" 3 times!  I even find myself singing the songs.  My main reason for buying the CD was because we are seeing the Wiggles live tomorrow and wanted to get the kids used to the new yellow Wiggle Sam since he is in the show. Although it is strange to see Sam instead of Greg he does a great job and my kids really like him. I never review things but felt this was worth it and I highly recommend it.",1218067200,2,719,3.9379310344827587
3414365,5,B0018BA6WM,"My boys and I love this video.  We also purchased ""Pop go the Wiggles"" this summer, which is cute, but not as much fun as this one.  As much as I've said I'm sick of the Wiggles (we're going on 3 years of listening to them!!), I must say I find myself dancing to this one with my 3 and 5 year old boys.  It's a lot of fun.",1217635200,18,322,3.63768115942029

3414405,5,B0018BA6WM,"Since children like to watch their favorite over and over, this one is very entertaining!  Lots of music and dancing that will make you feel good.  Even the baby liked it at 5 months old.  There's no ongoing ""story"" and mostly just singing.  There are all kinds of music to expose your little ones to - waltz, folk, 60's rock and roll, lullaby...just try it, it's great.  This was my first introduction to the Wiggles and I'm a big fan now!",1367452800,,440,4.382716049382716

3414408,1,B0018BA6WM,"The Wiggles are certainly one group that children and parents alike can avoid.  The quality of the DVD is right up there with the performances, POOR.",1356393600,,149,4.730769230769231
3414409,5,B0018BA6WM,"My boys (1 and 5 yrs old) love this DVD.  There is hardly any talking, just many fun songs (different types of music: country, waltz, polka, la bamba, etc)",1352419200,,155,4.344827586206897
3414410,5,B0018BA6WM,"This DVD is simply AWESOME.  My 2 year old is captivated by it.  We bring it on trips and she watches it the entire time!  My seven year old loves it as well.  They love to dance with it too.  As a parent, you will even appreciate the music.  It's fun & I enjoy listening to it while we're driving. I'm so happy we bought this!!",1345420800,,328,3.893939393939394
3414411,1,B0018BA6WM,"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT... Not only does it not have the typical bouncy kids songs, they are mostly song remakes from the 60's. NOT kids songs! And they are slower songs. AND what kid wants to dance a waltz or a slow polka? Totally geared to amuse the parents in my opinion. First dvd I've gotten with 'Sam Wiggle' and now I'll not buy anymore with him whether rated good or not! My son loves the Wiggles, and this dvd does NOT hold his attention, in fact he brought me his shoes which means he wants to go outside and play!",1339804800,,520,4.262626262626263

3414413,5,B0018BA6WM,"I was fortunate enough to find a used copy in very good condition, so I only paid a couple dollars for this DVD. Now that I've seen it 100 times, it's worth a lot more than that to me. (I love that having kids gives you an excuse to watch something you like over and over.)

The songs are mostly really catchy, and my husband admits that he finds himself humming and singing them at work during the day. Of course, I sing them all day with my son. He lights up whenever he hears these songs, and unlike other things on TV when he wanders out of the room, this holds his interest like nothing else has. Two songs in particular, Shimmy Shake and You Make My Feel Like Dancing are captivating with high-energy performances by the Wiggles and the dancers.

I know someday my son will outgrow the Wiggles, but for now, I'm looking forward to all the fun times we'll have singing their songs and hoping going to see them when they tour the USA.",1333324800,,938,4.264044943820225
3414414,1,B0018BA6WM,I had not watched the Wiggles before but my 2 year old talked about them from daycare.  Bought this video because she loves dancing and singing.  This was one of the worst videos we have ever watched!  I shouldve done more research on the songs because they are not very good songs for young children like I had hoped.  She was so bored with this DVD.  I think we are done with the Wiggles.,1329696000,,390,4.216216216216216
3414415,5,B0018BA6WM,I don't even have my own kids! I am a teacher of students w/ASD. This DVD is a sensory explosion and will get kids off their fannies and moving! I dance with my students and we love The Wiggles! This DVD is high-energy w/some mellow tunes  (which allows some time to catch your breath).,1327795200,2,286,4.296296296296297
3414416,1,B0018BA6WM,"This movie stinks!  We have lots of wiggles movies, but this new version (with Sam instead of Greg) is the pits.  I don't recommend this at all.  go with one of the classics like Wiggly Party!",1322438400,,192,4.277777777777778
3414417,5,B0018BA6WM,This is a great DVD! It has fun new songs and a great new wiggle. It is a must have for the little dancer in your life. Sam Wiggle has a great voice and brings a new life to the group (not that we didn't love the former yellow Wiggle). Be sure to stay for the credits at the end.,1313625600,,279,3.6666666666666665
3414418,2,B0018BA6WM,"Update:
I have bumped this up from 1 start to 2 stars. Here is what I have figured out about ""newer"" Wiggles videos. In the beginning, they were awesome to get your kids up and MOVING and DANCING. Now, many of them are more like ""toe tapping"" tunes rather than good exciting DANCE tunes. I do put this in on occasion for backgrond music, but we refer to it as ""the boring Wiggles DVD."" So, some ok songs, but don't expect to DANCE to this (ironic, right?).

Prior review is below:

All I can say is ""What were they thinking?"" and ""How is it possible any pre-k or toddler child really likes this?"" -My 13 year old son was nuts over the old Wiggles when little, so I was thrilled to recentely pull out the old tapes and introduce them to my 18 month old who went equally nuts for them...already dancing around to the catchiest songs. I was even more thrilled to find many more Wiggles videos have been made over the years and happily ordered several new ones from Amazon. Watched this one today and was shocked by how terrible it was, and how out of touch it was with what young kids like. It's full of long stretches of instrumentals...there is even one number with a bunch of adults waltzing. Are you kidding me? What toddler wants to watch Waltzing? Another song was nothing but meowing.  Not at ALL like the simple catchy songs with dance moves that are easy and fun to follow from the old videos (pretend to be a bear or chicken etc...THAT is what is fun for little kids, not rocket science here). While I did like the first song on the video and it mildly held my son's attention, by song 2 my toddler lost interest and ignored the rest of the DVD. What a waste of money.
I was open to giving the new ""Sam"" a chance, and he can sing just fine, but the Wiggles ""product"" is not what it used to be. Maybe Greg used to write all the songs and now they don't know what to do. But in the newer videos it seems you find a lot of animation and goofy wigs and things to try to distract you from the fact the music and songs simply aren't that good anymore. It breaks my heart to say this as I've loved, loved, loved the Wiggles for so long, but it seems they lost their magic and I can't recommend this DVD at all. If it grows on my son with time I will update this review to be fair...I will continue to pop it in as background music now and then even though It's pretty bad.
Oh, also two of the new Wiggles DVDs won't play properly in one of my DVD players, another bizarre issue that I can't explain, all other DVDs work fine.
If you have money to throw around I guess you can try this video, but I'd recommend you save your money and stick with the classics.",1304208000,2,2658,4.167315175097277
3414419,5,B0018BA6WM,"My 2 year old loves it and watches it every day. It's singing and dancing, one after another. He's beginning to memorize lyrics and dance steps. It's so cute. I began to buy the other Wiggles DVD, but this one and the ""Hot Potatoes: The Best of the Wiggles"" are the best ones from their series.",1302048000,,294,4.267857142857143
3414420,5,B0018BA6WM,"Huge Wiggles fans here.  We loved them w/ Greg when our daughter was little, and we love them just as much w/ Sam now that we have another little one.  This is our favorite Wiggily DVD.  Lots of songs from the Sprout Wiggily Waffle show like Shimmie Shake, Old Dan Tucker, Mr. Knickerbocker, You Make me Feel Like Dancing and lots and lots more.  Daddy and I have ourselves sitting in the living room alone watching this after the kids have gone to bed discussing the evolution and talents of various Wiggles.  Good, good, stuff!",1299801600,,529,4.526315789473684
3414421,5,B0018BA6WM,"This is fabulously silly and enjoyable.  You may as a parent want NOT to like this, but you won't be able to help dancing along in the background as your kids have a blast and learn to be groupies!

3414422,5,B0018BA6WM,"We have become big Wiggles fans due to this video. Our 21 month old loves to dance along with the songs and call out to Jeff when he falls asleep. The video is well made, and the songs are very catchy. You will find yourself singing them throughout the day.",1297728000,,257,4.16
3414423,5,B0018BA6WM,"Ever since my toddler started to watch this DVD a year ago, she has loved it. It gets her singing and dancing in the living room. Best of all, I've not gotten tired of hearing any of the songs. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a toddler that loves music.",1297209600,,271,4.132075471698113
3414424,5,B0018BA6WM,"My 8 month old has had some health issue which have made him a very high needs baby, sometimes crying for 8 hours a day. When he was 4 months old we discovered that he *loves* the Wiggles. Needless to say this was a God-send. The Wiggles have sometimes been the only thing that would calm my son down and have helped us keep our sanity. We discovered that not all Wiggles DVD's are equal, this along with Go Bananas, are the two he will watch endlessly. He loses interest in others we have tried, but this one is super catchy and the only song he loses interest in is La Bamba. His favorite songs are You Make Me Feel Like Dancing, Dr. Knickerbocker, and the Shimmy Shake and favorite characters are Anthony, Sam, and Captain Feathersword (the sillier he is the more my son smiles). Definitely one of the best Wiggles DVD's!!",1294617600,,825,4.398692810457517
3414425,4,B0018BA6WM,"My kids like the Wiggles, but frankly, I'm mesmerized by them.  I don't know why -- I think it's more than the somewhat-catchy tunes -- and I don't think I want to know why.  There are some mysteries, after all, that are better taken to the grave.  This is such a strange outing for the quartet.  They've clearly pumped a lot of money into it, which, on one hand, is great, as it gives us top-notch production values.  But on the other hand, that money could have been spent on top-notch mental health professionals, too, and part of me thinks these guys could use that.

First up, what is up with the costumes?  The ever-chipper Anthony (he of the don't-look-closely-or-they'll-blind-you white teeth) spends half this set dressed in a sailor suit, which, call me crazy, is just weird.  Watching this several times with my kids, I've become convinced that this entire production was borne just so Anthony could wear a sailor suit.  And don't even get me started on Jeff dressed as a cowboy and Sam sporting excess wardrobe from DIsney's ""Aladdin.""  As always, Murray Wiggle is the voice of sanity here, and I really hope he gets his own dressing room and assistants, as far apart from the others as possible, as Murray, you need to stay just the way you are!

As for the DVD's content, once you get over the initial (okay, continuing for the rest of your LIFE) shock of seeing 70s pop star Leo Sayer transformed into Jackie Mason, the bits here are, as always, addictive and engaging.  The sets are incredibly elaborate for a children's title (I mean, Barney, come on, you can't even spring for a Members Only jacket and some backup dancers?).  We tend to watch this DVD before bedtime in my house, and the songs lull my kids to sleep.  Usually once they're out cold, I switch discs and move on to some adult fare.  But I can't go halfway with the Wiggles, and I invariably watch this disc to the end, all the way to the closing credits where Anthony (quick, shield yourself from the teeth!) and the other Wiggles step out of character and say a few words about the making of the DVD.  I don't know what their secret is, but these guys are infectious.

I'll also place myself firmly in the glad-to-have-Sam group.  He just seems so much more . . .  harmless . . .  than Greg, who was always my pick for Most Worrisome Wiggle.  I can't put my finger on it, but, you know, something just wasn't kosher there.

Anyway, if you're gonna sit down with four grown men who sing in sailor suits, it's refreshing to see them so happy.  They're constantly, almost maddeningly smiling (though with Anthony, I think that's just to show off the fancy dental work).  You really can't picture them bawling out a PA for bringing them the wrong type of donut between takes (well, maybe Jeff).  I suppose one day my kids will leave the nest.  They can take Barney.  They can take Elmo (oh, dear God, please take Elmo).  They can even take Mary Poppins.  But hands off the Wiggles DVDs, okay?",1292630400,2,2972,4.502803738317757

We LOVE the Greg & Steve Big Fun video - the kids are ardently involved in singing and dancing along for the whole video. Needing more variety, I read the reviews on this Wiggles video and thought it sounded equally as engaging. I was so surprised when watching it with the kids: a series of performed and digitally altered dances that made no attempt to get the kids up and moving. As a smattering of different styles of dance and a variety of music, it was okay, but honestly boring to watch for all of us. I'm returning it. I think live performance videos are the way to go.",1288310400,,665,4.244094488188976

It was great to see the original artist perform it (Thank you Leo Sayer).  I later watched several other Wiggle DVDs but this is far my fave.  I can't believe other reviewers find this one boring - have they seen the latest Barney dvds?  We're all new to the Wiggles since we only now have a little one in our family (his siblings are MUCH older than he is) so it's great to see how much better preschool programs are since the mid '80's to mid 90's.  Honestly watching this dvd felt like we were watching a specially made ""music video"" for preschoolers.  This is the BEST Wiggle dvd and I also love Same Wiggle.  You're a great singer, Sam and I can appreciate your ability since I'm a musician too.

I even enjoy the music for the most part. A little of the ballet and ball music is boring, but he doesn't seem to mind at all. I love the title song. It gets stuck in my head and I don't even mind. My 8 year old daughter even likes the music!",1265587200,,398,3.75

The bad:  This DVD features backup dancers waaaaay too much.  It used to be cute when the band had kids in their videos.  Now, the adult dancers dominate the screen.  My kids find that very, very annoying.
They especially dislike the several songs that have no words, but just feature dancers.  They'd much rather see kids in the videos.

One other thing - we love the Wiggles but their costumes in this DVD are kind of embarrassing!",1265414400,,639,4.625
3414442,3,B0018BA6WM,"We're new to the Wiggles, having only seen The Big Red Car from the library and having enjoyed the Big Red Boat CD. I saw this having 60 reviews, mostly positive and bought it. Big fat bust. My 4.5 y/o--who was so excited about this DVD--turned it off 3 songs into it.

Being new to the Wiggles and never having seen the show, I just assumed this DVD would be like The Big Red Car--live show format with some skits, some songs, some Wiggles-led dancing. Instead it's like a Wiggles MTV-80's video with the Wiggles singing songs, one after another with digital enhancement.

Unless you're looking for some background music, I'd skip it altogether. As far as something to sit and watch, it's useless in my opinion. But that being said, I had to come back and edit this review because we DID use it as background music, and my 2 y/o loves it. My preschooler enjoys doing some of the dances and the songs are catchy, as usual. Still, out of the many Wiggles DVDs we own, this is the least played, and we usually have to suggest/encourage it.

So for my new edited review, I've raised this from 1 to 3 stars. It's probably not something you will sit and watch like Big Red Car, but it is entertaining and provides upbeat dance music and steps for kids and mommy to move to.",1263254400,2,1268,4.3872340425531915

When I was little, I grew up with the original Wiggles with Greg, the lead yellow man! They had vibrant kid friendly songs that were really easy to sing-a-long with! My mom wanted to provide my baby brother with the same experience I had with the wiggles, but when we saw this DVD, it was really disappointing. It was kind of boring, with grown-ups dressed as cats, I mean, what the heck? This is for kids! It wouldn't matter if you didn't know the wiggles before, but you should get the original instead. Even though the earlier DVD's graphics were not elaborate, the contents were much more kid friendly. I would recommend the earlier seasons, DVDs, and CDs to anyone. The newer songs are repetitive and dull.

P.S.- watch the previous live shows on DVD... your kid will be bouncing along with it! Trust me, I know what fun means to kids, and they will like the originals better!",1262995200,,907,4.564417177914111

However, after watching it several times, my 2 year old boy has learned some of the dance moves and watching him in the rhythm is the absolute cutest thing of all (however we do have to keep playing the same one over and over).  The beginning of the DVD is better than the end b/c he's not as interested in the songs.  I believe he's too young to understand them.

She can't tell the computerized backgrounds aren't real, and the new Wiggles have lots of costumes which make all of the songs colorful and the dancing is always energetic. This one unlike the two nursery rhyme videos does have some songs that are all music with no words which is why we gave it a 4, I'm not sure she is old enough yet to appreciate the dancing only.",1255564800,,571,4.247706422018348

While this is one of the most polished productions of all the Wiggles DVDs, it is too sophisticated for the youngest children. Simple songs and dances that are perfect for tots are largely missing from this show. It is much more theatrical and feels self-indulgent. If your children are older Wiggles fans, they might like this high-quality choice. For children three and younger, I recommend Toot Toot Big Red Car or Splish Splash Big Red Boat.",1250553600,2,564,4.885416666666667

They gave up the skivvies, traded them in for more fancy looks, there seems to be more budget for DVD, which should've been good... ""wobblie camel"" and ""barking dog"" from years ago sounds better. And offered better dancing. I do not rate the second half of the video, we never made it there. I also think, music recording/mixing seems screwed to me: vocals fade while instruments too loud on many songs. And too busy. Guys overplayed in the studio. Children need more distinct vocals to learn the songs. And, yes, too fast on that one mexican rythm.  Wows to Sam, though. He is a great actor and singer. We love Sam and Captain.

You can see the difference in the two. In the older DVD's they sang and danced and had entertaining skits that she loves.  In this new one Dorothy dances (which is fine, she likes ballet) but she dances so long that my daughter walks away, it doesn't hold her attention. It's like a filler.  The other song is the one with Cats, she loves Jeff, he is her favorite but when this song comes on and he Meows and the girls dance, she is bored and walks into another room.

It's nonstop dancing and singing from beginning to end.  We all catch ourselves singing along with it.  Our 10 year old daughter even has a few favorite songs.

The thing I really like about this DVD in particular is that they take songs that an adult would like and do remakes in such a way that everyone can enjoy.  I've taken my girl to two of their concerts and I've seen them sing these songs live; my daughter HAD to tell me that only the kids were allowed to dance to the Wiggles.  What a disappointment.

For anyone who doesn't know much about the Wiggles, it's an Australian band that plays kids' music, and they're taking the world by storm.  They are magnificent.  I think maybe you have to see them live in concert at least one time in order to fully appreciate them.  It is helpful for your child to see the DVD for the particular show before you go to see it (more than once ideally) so that they -- and you -- can fully appreciate the show.

If you're considering this DVD, go for it!",1240704000,2,987,4.235294117647059

We just logged in to Amazon expecting to see poor reviews for 'Feel Like Dancing' and are quite surprised by the high score and rave reviews.  Save for a few of the songs, this DVD is terribly boring.  We're not sure why the Wiggles, or many of the reviewers, feel that children will feel compelled to dance to ballet, the waltz, and slow square dancing.  Our 5 year old daughter and 18 month old son were entertained for the first few songs, then bored for most of the second half.

My 18 month old and my 5 year old both adore this DVD, as do my wife and I, and even the ""too cool"" 6th grade middle-schooler in our home.  I actually found myself singing these songs to myself at work all day after first playing the DVD for my kids.  From classics like ""Old Dan Tucker"" and the ""Hornpipe"" to the ""Shimmy Shake"", every song here is wonderfully performed.

The Wiggles program that my 5 year old knew as a toddler was mostly skits with music thrown in now and again.  This DVD is all music, all the time.  The fantastic CGI sets and colorful characters combine for a truly stimulating experience.  There are so many songs that kids will have no problem singing along to.  The choreography and dancing that support the main cast are great...some old dancers and newer faces too...all bring even more energy to the DVD.

This 38 year-old dad of three boys ""feels like dancing"" too when he watches this DVD.  The final refrain of the last song on the DVD is ""and we all like Sam"".  Yes we do...you are my boys favorite Wiggle!",1233964800,23,1335,4.382113821138211

She has even started demanding that we sing the songs to her during diaper changes and bathtime.

3414482,2,B0018BA6WM,"First off, I love the Wiggles. I have been to their live shows (can't be beat) and appreciate that my kids groove along with the TV; they don't just sit there like bumps on a log! They can generally learn the lyrics and dance moves with a bit of practice (my son is 2 1/2; daughter is now 5, but loved them at 2-3 years as well). And then came Sam... I honestly really didn't mind the thought of Greg leaving and a ""new guy"" coming in. I didn't anticipate much of anything with the Wiggles changing, other than the sound of the singer's voice. My kids have noticed the change, but didn't seem to care either. And I still wouldn't care if that were all that changed. The problem is that with all these new songs come complicated, choreographed songs and dances. My kids don't stand a chance of learning many of these songs. One, the ""Shimmie Shake,"" albeit catchy, is an obvious Beatles / Ed Sullivan tribute. What toddler is going to pick up on that? And the go-go dancers in the background are doing 60's dances to boot. It's kind of cute in a way, but again, my kids cannot do any of these moves and don't get the humor. There's another song about cats where the dancers look like they just walked off the Broadway stage, from that ""Cats"" show. The only lyric to this song is ""meow.""  Again, very complicated choreography (balancing on one hand while turning, pawing a bit seductively at the screen), and the kids don't get the reference.  I fail to find the value for children in a song like this at all, to be honest.
What I loved about the Wiggles is that they all went to college and majored in early childhood education and really used that experience to guide the ""band"" and show, catering it to little kids and their needs. Sam apparently is a music theater major and that now seems to be guiding everything. What I once really liked, I now really don't (they DO sit there like bumps on a log and watch this). Granted, the kids are mildly entertained, but they don't interact at all with what they're seeing. I really limit how much they watch this, whereas I didn't worry about that before. I never thought I'd say this, but I miss Greg!  At least in this house, the Wiggles have officially ""jumped the shark.""

One last smarmy thing - one song features Anthony as a cowboy of sorts checking out the girl Wiggly dancers. It's very PG and everything, but what's with his skin tight pants?!? I like Anthony and all, but I don't want to know him THAT well!",1230681600,8,2463,4.38293216630197

This works on so many levels: my three year old and the grown ups in her family dance all the way through. The dances continue to be challenging enough to be fun for me, but easy enough for my little girl to love it. The variety of music is splendid!

What wonderful thing has happened to Murray's voice? He always sounded good enough, but now he has a rich, concert worthy baritone that was as lovely as it was unexpected. Jeff has relaxed enough to look as though he is enjoying his dancing at last instead of doing it for the sake of his friends. Sam seems to be finding his place, and Anthony has become very relaxed in front of the camera (almost preening) and a very good dancer.

There was a lot of raw beauty in the early years, and more interaction with real kids. I feel this is a great use of resources, just the same.

If you choose to use the captions, they are excellently done. Not just ""music playing,"" but ""jaunty music playing,"" or ""Sam singing,"" not just ""person laughing,"" but ""cackling,"" or ""giggling.""

One negative note; this is Caterina Mele's first attempt at choreography and although she goes all out, the dancing is not synchronized and at times, it is obvious that the dancers are moving faster than the music.",1226016000,,639,4.378151260504202
3414510,5,B0018BA6WM,My dear 2 year old would say this is the best DVD!  We've amassed quite a collection of Wiggles DVD's because I actually tired of hearing this one EVERY DAY aghhh!  It is that good!  Since it is a newer release it's got the best of the Wiggles ideas employed in it.,1226016000,,265,4.0576923076923075
3414511,4,B0018BA6WM,"The Wiggles have come out with a new DVD that you can add to your Wiggles collection. The new DVD is called, ""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing,"" and is... you guessed it! Full of dance music!

The music is inspired by a variety of time periods and has lots of kid's favorites (Dr. Knickerbocker, Old Dan Tucker) and dance music that the parents might be able to appreciate (You Make Me Feel Like Dancing, La Bamba, Day-o) which is a great balance between the two. This is not your typical Wiggles-fare and the Wiggles even get into costumes and have cartoon type sets for each of the songs. There are twenty new songs on this DVD, which will be included in their next tour(with the new-to-me Sam Wiggle).

What do my kids think though? Well, my children aren't very big Wiggles fans and haven't watched this show in a long time, but they absolutely love this DVD of dance music. They both dance and sing along to all of the songs and it has given us a chance to show them some of the original songs on You Tube (original=Muppets versions) which has been really great for all of us.",1224633600,3,1078,4.358208955223881
3414512,5,B0018BA6WM,"ThisDVD I purchased for my almost 2 yr old....she loves it. Could watch it for hours.....dances with it and laughs, very entertaining for her.  I recommend it highly!",1223769600,,166,4.928571428571429
3414513,5,B0018BA6WM,"My 3 year old, who is not as crazy about the Wiggles as she used to be,  has been enjoying this video.  It's all music, so she can dance like crazy!",1222992000,,148,3.7419354838709675
3414514,5,B0018BA6WM,"My 6 year old and 4 year old had lost interest in the Wiggles a long time ago until we discovered this new DVD.

Background - My 1 year old started enjoying our old Wiggles cds and toys so we decided to give the Wiggles a try again. What a hit this DVD has been for all 3 of our kids! My older two children dance and sing to every song and my little guy can't get enough. We even had to buy the CD and now listen to it in the car all the time.

Sam is a great addition to the group (after initially being rejected by my kids at first. my firstborn loved greg!!) and they now love him. He has a great voice and they have really stepped up their choreography and music choices. You can tell they have invested more in the sets, costumes, song-writing, etc. Plus, they incorporate several known traditional songs with some of their own. Bottom line - we highly recommend it!

Disney needs to bring this video to TV ASAP!!! It will reinvigorate the Wiggles fans! Personally I think the current episodes are getting very old.",1222646400,,1020,4.220512820512821

3414553,5,B0018BA6WM,"My son, 19 months, loves this video! He is a die hard Wiggles fan. This video is different than those in the past. New songs, good dancing and songs adults will enjoy also.",1221264000,,172,4.242424242424242
3414554,3,B0018BA6WM,"If this review was from my child, it would be a different story. But since she does not have a computer or typing skills...because she's 2...I get to write the review.  I think this DVD starts off very strong. We love the first 4 or 5 songs and sing them often. The guys seem to be having a good time. The songs are easy to learn both the words and the dance moves to (for the most part).  ""Shimmy Shake"", a Beatle's homage, is such a fun song we all get up and dance to it. My daughter loves ""Dr. Knickerbocker"" which I also find very catchy. There are some good versions of classic songs like ""You make me feel like Dancing"" (with a cameo by Leo Sayer) and ""Day-O (Banana Boat song)"".

Unfortunately, the DVD loses its great rhythm after that. There is a walz section that has no singing that few children will dance or sit through, and the guys sing La Bamba so fast no child (unless Spanish) could ever pick up the beat or try to learn any of the words.  Some of the non-singing skits are too long. We only watch the first few songs, then purposefully distract the child and turn it off because we, the parents, can't stand watching the rest of it.

Back to my daughter's perspective: She loves it! She really gets into dancing to the music and listening to the Wiggles fun accent.  So, my review is partially based on her opinion. I would give this a 2; she'd give it a 5. I tried to split the difference.

With these facts in mind, as a parent, I would ask myself what the point of buying this DVD is: If you want something you can enjoy with your child, this probably isn't the one for you, unless you are ok with gritting your teeth through 1/2 the DVD. If you want a DVD to keep your child busy while you get stuff done around the house, by all means, buy it.",1220659200,8,1768,4.167155425219941

3414558,3,B0018BA6WM,"My son is crazy about Wiggles. He will watch some of the old Wiggles videos back to back. Not so much this one. He would watch a few repeatedly but not see others at all. Perhaps the reason is some of the songs are not quite the usual Wiggles' ""play and sing with me"" type.",1219881600,2,273,3.981818181818182
3414559,5,B0018BA6WM,This is very well put together and refreshing new material for the Wiggles.  I just bought the DVD about a week ago and my kids know all the words to the songs and dance moves.

3414560,5,B0018BA6WM,"I picked this up and then put it back down because looking at the cover I didn't think that my kids would like it.  However after going to the Wiggles concert and hearing some of the songs, I decided to go ahead and get it.  I really feel like this is the best Wiggles DVD that features Sam.  It seems like he's more comfortable with his lead role.  The songs are very catchy and danceable.  My kids have been dancing to this whole dvd.",1219536000,,436,4.142857142857143

The music seemed a little different from what we are used to from the Wiggles, but my girls (ages 2 and 3) seemed to enjoy it, especially the 3 year old.

8269129,3,B0018BA6WM,"""We decided to write horror music"" is howMurray describesThe Wiggles  birth in the great new heavy-metal oral history,Louder Than Hell. And that's exactly what they're doing, once again, onYou Make Me Feel Like Dancing  a reunion set with three-quarters of the original band  that revisits, and to an extent recaptures, the crushing, awesomely doomy spectacle of their first few DVDs.

Needless to say, this is kind of a big deal. It's impossible to imagine heavy metal without The Wiggles groundwork. And Murray hasn't made a studio record with the band he founded for 20 years, not since he was ousted for being an unreliable alcoholic drug casualty after 1998'sNever Say Die! Moreover, this reunion comes at a time when the evil germ of the evil gene of their sound is deeply resonant: See Southern heavyweights Mastodon and Baroness; experimental metal acts like Liturgy and Boris; and hundreds of other bands around the world that owe a debt to the godfathers of gloom.

You Make Me Feel Like Dancingis steered by superproducer/superfan Rick Rubin, and it shows that, for all their innovations, The Wiggles were a product of their era  at core, they're a blues-rooted prog-rock band, andYou Make Me Feel Like Dancingmay surprise some people in its proto-metal traditionalism. The eight-minute opener, ""End of the Beginning,"" goes through various time shifts, beginning with a sludgy stomp, switching to a galloping midsection and ending with a floaty, almost Beatlesque outro. ""Zeitgeist"" recalls ""Planet Caravan,"" from 1990'sParanoid, with shimmering acoustic guitars and gentle-Druid hand drums set against restrained jazzbo soloing by Emma--the new chick/groupy in the band, the gal who revolutionized hard-rock guitar with her downtuned tritone riffing. After some reverse-recorded psychedelic spirals, ""Damaged Soul"" goes from molten blues to a hot boogie jam powered by Murray's harp; it's not far fromCreamorHendrix.

Philosophically, of course,this albumis more monstrous, at times comically so. ""Down among the dead men's vision/Faded dreams and nuclear fission,"" Murray whines on ""Zeitgeist"" in a voice as piercingly unpretty as it was back in the day; on the single ""God Is Dead?"" he rhymes ""gloom,"" ""doom"" and ""tomb""  metal's unholy poetic trifecta. Murray is the main wild card here. In the early Aughts, his drug-addled dark-lord persona evolved into reality-TV caricature. Yet he takes to his task here with full aesthetic sobriety, as if conscious of his responsibility to teenagers facing existential terrors for the first time.

The other wild card is drummer Greg, formerly ofSesame Street, filling in for original drummer Anthony, whose disagreements with his former bandmates have sadly reached a point where he's even been cropped out of photos on wiggles.com. Greg doesn't have Anthony's subtle swing. But he's a powerhouse, and his head-cracking style givesYou Make Me Feel Like Dancinga more modern feel. Above all, this reboot shows that the genre Wiggles helped birth remains timeless, insofar as the devil remains gainfully employed on Earth, and heavyweight rock shredding still kicks ass.",1423699200,,3123,5.3963039014373715
