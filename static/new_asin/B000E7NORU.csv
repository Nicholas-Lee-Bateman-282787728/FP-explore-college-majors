8106906,4,B000E7NORU,"This DVD has two movies that have been digitally remastered. The first film is titled 'I Beheld His Glory'. This is the story of Christ's final days as witnessed by the Roman Commander Cornelius. Roman centurion Cornelius, played by George Macready, is the first Christian convert witness to the final days of Jesus Christ. From the Last supper and the betrayal of Jesus to the Crucifiction and the Resurrection. This is a five star film.

The other side of the DVD has the movie 'Power of the Resurrection'. This family film shows the last days of Christ as seen through the eyes of Simon and Peter. We see Judas as he betrays Christ and how Peter even gets the sword he uses to cut off the centurions ear. This is a four star movie, which makes the whole DVD 4.5 stars. I preferred the first movie of the two.",1140480000,4,811,4.442953020134228
