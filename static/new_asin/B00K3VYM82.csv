8655739,5,B00K3VYM82,"Although the DVD is east-coastcentric, it does mention Seattle as one of Olmstead's project areas. Although we have nothing like Central Park, Olmsted made a lasting contribution here and is frequently cited when landscape architect vandals attempt to destroy parklands.  The DVD is fascinating, both about his park designs and the man himself. I'm contributing the DVD to a library so that others may learn about this remarkable man.",1482105600,,434,5.2898550724637685
8655740,5,B00K3VYM82,"In 1853 New York City had purchased the Central Park land, a rough, disgusting, filthy 778 acres for five million dollars to create a park and Olmsted was able to win the design competition, his first project ever and later in building and managing the Park in 1855. Central Park may not be a miracle but it is a masterpiece that Frederick Law Olmsted co-designed with his English partner among many other open spaces during his life time. What Frank Lloyd Wright was to Architecture, Fredrick Olmsted was to landscape architecture where his visions are still thriving and offering joy to millions of people in National Parks and open spaces all over US hundred years later. Brilliant and talented soul who believed in happiness but one who experienced friction with his partners and many tragedies in his personal life from losing his mother at age three to few of his children including the children of his brother when he married his sister-in-law. What Vanderbilt and Olmsted achieved in Baltimore Estate in North Carolina is something that no billionaire in this century or any other century can or will ever achieve in anywhere, inside US or outside US. Olmsted, a genius who understood and worked with geology just like Disney or Jobs who where designers who understood engineering and understood hiding the nasty mechanical parts of their creation. This is a man who truly experienced life, a great life of creations of spaces for joy before leaving planet earth at age 81. Well done documentary.",1403827200,6,1504,4.925196850393701
