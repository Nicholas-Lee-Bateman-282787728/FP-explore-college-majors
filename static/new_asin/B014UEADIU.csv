8731873,3,B014UEADIU,"This is a truly strange little movie. Ms. Chaplin plays a woman in her sixties or seventies, who for completely incomprehensible reasons, seems to be madly in love with a shallow,  ambisexual young woman who makes frequent demands for cash. Why the cultivated, sophisticated ""old lady,"" as the young ones call her, should be thus involved is a mystery that remains unresolved after much provocation right up to the end. But Ms. Chaplin is well worth watching, warts and all, and the music is excellent. The dancing is sexy and the location sufficiently exotic to warrant a look. But the film doesn't make much sense.",1454544000,2,616,4.866666666666666

8731875,5,B014UEADIU,"Laura Amelia Guzman and Israel Cardenas have worked and achieved one of their greatest films yet in Sand Dollars. Star Geraldine Chaplin shines as an older tourist in love with a local escort looking for a way out of the country and of her current lifestyle. With the help of her brother , Noeli seeks the comfort, as well as money, of older Frenchwomen tourist Anne. Anne falls in love with Noeli and after three years of her company is finally able to propose an escape for her, but when the time comes Noeli must choose between Anne and Yeremi. This film takes a dip into the life of the dynamic between locals and tourists in poverty-filled countries. The authors of the film did their research when they portrayed the crowd in this film set in Dominican Republic as a mixture of wealthy tourists with a hint of the poor locals looking for an upgrade opportunity and doing anything possible to get the chance.",1446422400,9,913,4.573170731707317
