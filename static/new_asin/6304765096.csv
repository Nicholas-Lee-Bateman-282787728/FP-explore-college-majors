936983,5,6304765096,"What can be said of Mitchell that hasn't been said already? Joe Don Baker lurches through this film, straining his belt buckle with his obscene girth and grinning drunkenly at the goings-on around him. I don't know if it was  the producer's intent to have the hero played as a rotgut-swilling slob,  but Baker's interpretation goes beyond the pail, becoming downright  disgusting. Lumbering around LA in a beer-soaked fog, bedecked in what  appear to be a clown's hand-me-downs, Mitchell is slow-witted, obnoxious,  and just plain gross. As for the movie, it plays like a reel of rejected  scenes from a knockoff of ""The Rockford Files"". Marvel at the  interminable scenes of Mitchell dozing on the job outside Martin Balsam's  house! Watch in amazement as Mitchell lies in his bed, besodden with filth  as he guzzles the 20th beer of the evening! Laugh joyously at the witty  repartee between Mitchell and his obvious intellectual superior: The Kid on  the Skateboard (whose skateboarding skills leave plenty to be desired, by  the way)! But, most of all, hold your lunch down as Mitchell befouls Linda  Evans in what has to be the most vile love scene ever filmed. See Linda  wipe crumbs from Mitchell's mouth! Watch Mitchell suavely hook a sixpack  with his pudgy toe! Gaze in awe and wonder at the baby oil placed  strategically on the nighttable! All this while Hoyt Axton mumbles  incoherently about our titular hero set to music that sounds like a  calliope played by an escaped mental patient. If you haven't ridden the  stomach elevator by this scene's end, you are a stronger sort than I!  Overall, see this movie (or the MST3K version)! I promise you will laugh  uproariously between spells of nausea. And, while watching, take the time  to enjoy a triple-decker sandwich and a Schlitz. That's what Mitchell would  do!",949276800,47,1829,4.905228758169935

937230,1,6304765096,"This is a review of the Reel enterprises version, not necessarily the Warner Archives version.. I know Amazon throws all of the reviews together, regardless of the version, which is not a good decision because it can confuse people.. As I write this, the ""Reel Enterprises"" version is available for Prime members to view for free, which if you do, it won't make you want to buy this version. Which, btw, is a DVD-R product manufactured on demand when you order..

For starters, there's an ""RE"" watermark in the right hand corner of the picture..I dunno about you, but if I purchase something, I expect a clean picture..I'm not buying a bootleg taped off cable type stuff..Like it was airing on TNT.. I know some budget labels were doing this (Watermarking), especially with public domain stuff, but it's not a selling point and it doesn't reflect something I want to intentionally purchase.

Next, the picture quality is atrocious. It looks to be in VHS EP or LP mode quality, and in extreme pan & scan - NOT full frame, but pan and scan.... Most people don't think there's a difference, but there is.. a 1.33 presentation of a film shot at 2.35:1 is pan & scan..it's the process used.. A full frame picture is when the film is originally shot at 1.33 and then matted to 1.77 or 1.85:1... When it's unmated, it's full frame...For example, when released in 1.33, ""Caddyshack"", is full frame"", ""The People Vs. Larry Flint"" is pan and scan (btw, worst case I've ever seen; especially in the hot tub scene - gave me a headache), I know some tech geeks will comment and want to say that's not the whole truth, but in layman's terms, it is.

The movie is also edited, it's not the uncut version...

And finally, I know a lot of companies now do this manufacture on demand DVD-R stuff, and it's inferior junk, and not worthy of anything over $5..and that's for a crystal clear copy.. Not $10 - $25.

The whole point of doing these so-called ""Archive Collections"" was to cut down on the over-head..When they record a DVD-R on demand, it costs next to nothing to record onto a 22 cent dvd-r and a horrible 55 cent Xerox'd cover in a 25 cent case.. not to mention that these on demand manufactured discs aren't worth a dime..Try taking one to a store to trade in..They are nothing more than bootlegs..most stores refuse to handle them.

So while the film is a decent watch and entry for the 70's action or grindhouse genre, this RE version is downright insulting and toxic.

4/30/2014 Update:
-----------------
I did end up buying the Warner Archives version and, while it's a dreaded DVD-R, it was still worth it. The movie is presented in it's original 2.35:1 aspect ratio and uncut, oh, and no watermark in the corner.. Not a classic, but a neat 70's flick.",1394928000,3,2750,4.588594704684318

Joe Don Baker pushes the Schlitz to the limit as a slobbish L.A. cop who plays by his own stubborn rules. The once-in-a-lifetime cast includes Linda Evans as a prostitute-turned-romantic interest, Harold J. Stone's Chico Marx-inspired mafioso, and Merlin Olsen as the all-purpose henchman. It's hard to believe Andrew V. McLaglen directed this ridiculous crime potboiler, but I'm glad he did.

After years of shoddy prints (not to mention the MST3K abridgment), ""Mitchell"" can finally be seen in all its R-rated widescreen glory. Bring a six-pack and enjoy the ride.",1386720000,,660,5.336538461538462
937271,3,6304765096,"This film's greatest contribution to entertainment was as fodder for the movie riffing show Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K). The film follows a detective who, by way of blundering oafishness and childlike naivete, manages to follow an investigative thread from a breaking and entering/ self defense shooting case, to a drug running/money laundering case involving the lawyer who's house the B&E occurred in. His investigative method is basically to eyeball the scene of a crime for a minute and then blatantly disregard the orders of his superior officers to follow up on the hunch he developed while doing so. The film never gives a strong enough justification for these constant acts of flagrant insubordination and leaves the viewer wondering why the heck this guy is still a detective, especially after the numerous extreme violations of people's rights. Another brilliant moment is when Mitchell directly approaches one of the suspects in the case, with no knowledge of the individual's actual involvement (he's simply been assigned to conduct surveillance on the guy), learns absolutely nothing as a result, and blows his cover too! This means nothing of course, because Mitchell will solve the case by pure manlines and the convenience of a moral righteousness that does not permit self doubt or evaluation. He even gets his own silly theme song while having sex, which MST3K ""nerds"" justifiably immortalized as the ridiculous garbage it is. Throughout this journey, Mitchell never really shows us that he has the mental capacity to actually accomplish the amazing feats of police investigation he is constantly pulling off.
Having said that, I can't bring myself to give this less than three stars. As ridiculously stupid as this movie is, it's still fun to watch. I mean, this guy is an idiot, but he keeps coming out on top! It's like Fletch, Mr. Bean, and Walker Texas Ranger all wrapped up in one guy. It's like watching the Cleveland Browns have a winning streak. You just have to root for the big dumb idiot. I must warn you though, if you have no tolerance for watching old cheesy movies, you're just going to think this sucks, and it really does deserve everything MST3K threw at it.",1385510400,5,2204,5.008174386920981

Secondly, Reel Enterprises have cut a lot in this film.
In the original version we can see how sexually active Miss Evans is, even to the point where she gives head.

While not a classic in the genre, Mitchell is a serviceable enough crime drama, with a decent story, and a pretty good cast.  The action sequences are well done, and include a couple of car chases, and a helicopter pursuing a boat.

Mitchell is working on two cases, one involves a wealthy lawyer named Deaney (John Saxon) who gunned down a burglar in his home, and then planted a weapon on the body, to make it appear to be self defense.  Aware that Mitchell suspects him of murder, Deaney tries to buy him off, and also sends a prostitute named Greta (Linda Evans) to Mitchell's apartment.  The cop has no problem with sleeping with her, and later carting her off to jail, for possession of drugs.

Mitchell's primary assignment is to observe James Arthur Cummings (Martin Balsam), a man with underworld ties who is suspected of being involved in the importation of a large shipment of drugs.  Eventually both Deaney and Cummings, make attempts to kill Mitchell, but the detective proves to be more plucky and resourceful that he might appear.  Andrew McLaglen is very capable directing action, and after meandering along the film finishes strongly with a gunfight followed by a terrific action sequence, featuring a helicopter chasing a boat out at sea, and then attacking it, using a metal tank as a wrecking ball.  Mitchell displays his fighting skills, wrapping up the case.

This is a straight ahead drama without a lot of mystery, as the bad guys are revealed at the start, and know that Mitchell is after them.  With his winning personality and aggressive style, it's not long before Mitchell is breaking and entering, shattering bones, shooting unarmed suspects, and going caveman, bashing in a man's head with a rock.

Detectives with quirky personalities are nothing new, but Mitchell is still an unusual guy.  He can be hard and tough, and also rather unsophisticated and crude.  He sometimes plays the fool, although he usually has some idea of what he is doing.  Although immune to monetary bribes, he's perfectly willing to enjoy Greta's charms, while remaining quite detached emotionally.  Mitchell is kind of a jerk, and has a cruel streak, but he also has the resourcefulness and drive to see things through to the end.  Joe Don Baker may occasionally play things a little too cute, but it's still a pretty interesting if uneven performance.

Given the story, the acting is not too bad.  John Saxon (Enter the Dragon]]) is good as a scheming crook, and Linda Evans (Big Valley, Dynasty TV series) brings some class to a rather thankless role.  Martin Balsam (Psycho,&nbsp;) is good as a scheming crook, and Linda Evans (Big Valley, Dynasty TV series) brings some class to a rather thankless role.  Martin Balsam (Psycho,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Anderson-Tapes/dp/B001CQONHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Anderson Tapes</a>) is fine, but someone younger and more capable of displaying ruthlessness and toughness, might have worked better.  In an early film appearance, football player turned actor Merlin Olsen (Father Murphy), is a little stiff, but not too bad as Cummings' bodyguard.

The film's country music influenced soundtrack, and Mitchell's theme, sung by Hoyt Axton, is very reminiscent of Mike Post's work on The Rockford Files (1974-80).  If you like 70's crime dramas with offbeat detectives, Mitchell is a decent watch.

937323,2,6304765096,"If you're reading this, odds are you've seen the MST3K version of the cruddy Joe Don Baker cop movie ""Mitchell."" This DVD is the uncut version, which includes about thirty minutes of scenes not in the MST3K version, as well as some alternate footage (find out what word Linda Evans REALLY wrote on Joe Don Baker's windshield). The uncut version has more scenes of Joe Don's oily, beefy body rolling around in bed with Linda Evans, a scene where Joe Don crushes a bad guy's hand in a car door, and, in the funniest scene in the whole movie, we find out what actually happened to John Saxon (dies in a fiery dune buggy accident). Buying this disc, I was kinda hoping that the plot would make more sense, but, Saxon death notwithstanding, the movie was still a muddled and confused mess. This disc should probably be recommended only to ""Mitchell"" completists (a very niche audience I must say).

The DVD from Brentwood presents ""Mitchell"" in a cropped 1.33:1 transfer. (Gosh, pan and scan? To think we're missing up to half of the film's sumptuous photography!). The print is faded and worn-out, and at one point, the Brentwood copywrite information actually appears on screen, so purists beware. The sound is particularly bad - much of Joe Don's deep, slurred dialogue is practically inaudible. There is a supremely ugly menu that has a big, distorted Joe Don Baker picture along with some funky '70s music. There are no extras, unsurprisingly. Bring on the Joe Don Baker commentary!

This release has some of the worst DVD box art known to man. The cover has perhaps the ugliest Joe Don Baker picture in the world, along with the priceless catchphrase (and I quote), ""A cop with a gun, a drink, and no friends."" Talk about a sales pitch, eh?",1119484800,49,1741,4.686274509803922

Fortunately, I was lucky enough to watch the MST3K version, and I was saved by a barrage of witty remarks by Joel Hodgson, Tom Servo, and Crow T. Robot.
Anyway, Joe Don Baker is arguably the star of this disgusting spectacle, featuring a 25 mph car chase and some of the ugliest outfits you've ever seen.  The fact that this was originally meant to be a serious movie makes me shudder.",1028073600,4,516,4.375

Joe Don Baker (actually an excellent character actor) is the star of this cinematic train wreck.  There is a very compelling reason to buy this un-MSTed ""Mitchell"", and even better reasons to avoid it.
First, if you're a shameless ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" fan (as I am), it's a perfect companion to arguably the Brains' bid for comic masterpiece.  The plot of the MST'ed version is completely incomprehensible (something about a super-secret spy...has a motorcycle...marooned in space...meets Hercules...or not).  While the unexpurgated version fills in a few details, the plot REMAINS completely incomprehensible, it's just that much more convoluted.  Still, you'll find out what happened to John Saxon (killed in a dune buggy accident - gotta see it to believe it), why Mitchell shot Edmundo Bocca in the leg(completely stupid but at least it's now within the story context), and some of the conversations will make marginally more sense (particularly with Linda Evans, who now has a name - Greta).  The *best* reason to see it is that apparently the Brains riffed the ""clean"" version, and this video is the ""R-rated"" Mitchell.  Like many films, the director shot a theatrical flavor and a release flavor, including some mildly rough language and additional violence.  It's not just looped; for example, in the MST version Linda Evans writes ""jerk"" in lipstick. In the R-rated version, she writes ""bastard"" instead. (...).
Unfortunately, as much as I like ""Mitchell"" as an abject example of astonishingly bad filmmaking, I cannot recommend its purchase in this format.  The tape is recorded in ""EP"" mode, which is completely inexcusable for a (...) film.  Secondly, the transfer is about as poor as I have ever seen, with numerous tracking errors, sound drops, and other flaws.  I expect poorly shot source material in a movie like this, but I will not tolerate poor mastering.  Finally, the clamshell is poorly constructed.  This movie will not last on the shelf very long before becoming completely unwatchable.  Caveat Emptor.

7878852,1,6304765096,"This is not a good movie.  That said, I enjoy this movie terribly mostly because of how bad it is.  If you enjoyed the MST3K episode, it's worth your time to see some of the missing scenes and other changes.  If you're looking for a good action crime comedy, you'd do better to look elsewhere.

The Good:
- The soundtrack is actually quite good.  It's certainly has a strong 70's vibe, but I found myself whistling and humming the music from this film for quite some time after I'd seen it.
- The acting (from the leads) is actually fairly good despite some rather odd casting and screenplay decisions.

The Bad:
- The screenplay.  This movie is so unnecessarily complicated.  Minimum of 3 watchings required to understand the connections between Walter Deanie, Mistretta, Arthur Cummings, and Mr Gilano.  Walter Deanie is completely unnecessary, everything that character does should have just been folded into Arthur Cummings.  Mr Gilano and Mistretta should have just been the same person to avoid yet another layer of needless complexity.
- The casting.  Joe Don Baker just isn't charismatic enough to work as a sort of ""every-man plays by his own rules"" cop in a lead role on his own.  This would have worked more as a buddy copy where he could play off a straight laced, by the book partner.
- The action.  The action scenes are usually either boring (torpid car chases) or completely unbelievable (vehicles exploding many times with very little prompting.
- The comedy.  This movie is not at all funny when it tries and is hilarious when it attempts to be serious.  Joe Don Baker yelling at children and busting his girlfriend/prostitute for pot simply don't work as comedy.",1523577600,,1681,4.788194444444445
