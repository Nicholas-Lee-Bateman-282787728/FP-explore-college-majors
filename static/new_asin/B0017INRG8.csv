3172817,3,B0017INRG8,"On the one hand the show was brilliant and funny.

On the other hand, it was a complete ripoff of Mike Allred's far superior comic ""Madman"". To my knowledge Allred was never given credit for ""inspiring"" the character or any kind of compensation.",1214352000,2,245,4.6976744186046515
3172818,4,B0017INRG8,"When Warner Bros. started up their own Saturday morning programming block in the form of the now-retired Kids' WB!, new shows were needed to fill up its schedule. One of those shows was ""Freakazoid!"", named for its zany titlular superhero. An example of this guy's wackiness is that, in the first episode, he draws a face on his right hand and calls it his new sidekick, then has it engage in a romantic relationship with his other hand. In a piece of irony, given the huge fandom it's gathered, fans of this show were reportedly hard to come by back when the show was originally airing. The show would eventually gain its cult status through its Cartoon Network reruns, but unfortunately for the fans, production on the series was now cancelled. ""Freakazoid!"" briefly reappeared on In2TV, during which Warner Home Video hinted that it was being considered for the DVD format, and now, about two years later, we're getting that in the form of this.

As with Tom Ruegger's other productions for WB Animation, I'm a big fan of the show, so you're probably wondering why I gave it four stars instead of five. Well, the answer lies in a problem I have that has suspiciously not been mentioned in any of the other reviews posted thus far. ""Freakazoid!"" only ran for 24 episodes, and as we've seen with some of their other DVD sets, Warner Home Video is clearly capable of putting that many episodes on one four-disc set. But for whatever reason, they decided to split this up over two seasonal sets. That doesn't make much sense to me, and it kinda puts the kibosh on a theory I'd been going with last year (that a ""Freakazoid!"" Complete Series set would be released alongside ""Animaniacs""' final volume). I'm told they're doing this in the hopes of generating a lower price tag, which would supposedly make it easier to sell more copies. But if this is how they're going to go with releasing this and ""The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries"", I may have reason to worry when they get around to releasing ""Histeria!"" Plus, since the second season had only 11 episodes, one can only wonder how they're going to handle that set.

But that doesn't bother me as much as an even bigger oddity on the set itself, in the form of the last episode on the first disc. That particular episode contains the segments ""The Cloud"" and ""Candle Jack"", both of which are already featured in episodes 10 and 2, respectively. In other words, this set is including one of those re-arranged filler episodes that Kids' WB! aired early on in the show's run (""Animaniacs"" and ""Histeria!"" had a few of these as well). The ""Pinky and the Brain"" sets didn't overcharge us for the same material by including the filler episodes compiled from segments originally featured on ""Animaniacs"", so why is ""Freakazoid!"" saddled with a similar problem?! Is it so that they can both parts of the two-part episode, ""The Chip"", right at the beginning of disc two? If so, I think it's a rather farfetched excuse. The adjacent ""Tiny Toon Adventures"" DVD set contains eight episodes per disc; therefore, WHV could've just as easily put both parts of ""The Chip"" at the end of disc one if they'd just gotten rid of that giant waste of disc space that is this stupid filler episode. Maybe then they wouldn't have had to make disc two a flipper disc. But no, instead they're giving us a 13-episode set incorrectly advertised as having 14 episodes and making us pay more money for it than we need to, which kinda dilutes the intent of this set being cheaper to buy. This is why I am going to preorder this set here instead of purchasing it at Best Buy.

That's right; despite those above-mentioned flaws, I'm still buying and recommending this set. ""Freakazoid!""'s probably the most popular of WB Animation's collaborations with Amblin Entertainment today, in spite of having a shorter run than its predecessors. And I have to admit, I subscribed to the show on In2TV's now-defunct Hi-Q Video service, but I didn't really watch it much there since I was busy focusing on the woefully-neglected ""Histeria!"" (which, along with ""Road Rovers"", also seriously needs to be released on DVD, in case anyone from Warner Home Video is reading this review). And since the AVI files of all the episodes would probably take up too much space on one's hard drive, this and the eventual second season set is pretty much the best route to go. Besides, in addition to the obligatory retrospective featurette, which will apparently be highlighting the original concept of the show (Freakazoid wasn't always planned to be the crazy guy we know), we're also getting audio commentaries on three episodes (I'm hoping we'll find out who Freakazette was supposed to be) and, unless I'm mistaken, actual TV promotional spots (something previously unheard of on DVDs of Kids' WB! shows). So yes, this DVD set is definitely a recommended purchase; just be sure you get it for a cheaper price like I'll be doing.",1211414400,8,4924,4.736596736596737

3172820,5,B0017INRG8,"There's no two ways about it: this show is brilliant.

From the parodies, through the many cultural references to the wordplay, it's a comic achievement of the highest order. It's eminently and thoroughly quotable - from the villains such as Longhorn (""Son, you're dumber than a bowl 'o mice!"") to Dexter's family (""Well, of course he's real to *you* dear, but that's because you're probably insane."") and questionable allies (""Muffins made entirely from dill weed!"").

I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am that this is FINALLY being released on DVD.  I never missed this show when it was on the WB.  In fact, I woke up early to watch it ... and I'm definitely not known for waking up much before 11 on the weekends!

If I had one more wish, though, it would be that this set would've contained the complete series because the show didn't even last that long.  Oh boy, oh boy ... I get to watch Fanboy to my little heart's content.  ""Sulu!  I'm walkin' with Sulu!""

3172822,5,B0017INRG8,"If you're a fan of the spontaneous humor of the Animaniacs, then you'll love this show. Dexter Douglas uses the power of cyberspace to become the superhero Freakazoid (this was in the early days of the internet, so it seemed like a mysterious thing at the time). Unfortunately, Freakazoid isn't your normal superhero. Yes, he has superpowers (the funniest being when he flies by stretching his arms out and making wind noises as he runs around). Yes, he has supervillains. But he's not Batman by any means! He's fun and frantic and full of humor.

Each episode usually had one skit running throughout the show, with tiny sketches built into it like little commercial breaks. One of the best was ""Frenching with Freakazoid"", in which he would teach a French phrase. Most of them wouldn't be something you'd use in a normal conversation however (""Who cut the cheese?""). The frenetic pace of the show keeps it from being boring, and I'm so glad to see it finally make it to disc.

Superman has Lex Luthor, Batman has the Joker, and Freakazoid has Mo-Ron (yep, just like it sounds). Like I said earlier, if you're a fan of Animaniacs and Pinky & The Brain, this show will be a perfect fit for you. Never boring!",1207958400,36,1207,4.635514018691588

3172832,4,B0017INRG8,"Freakazoid has some of the most unapologetic humor I have ever seen and it is easily it's greatest strength!
It's a blend of clever comedy wrapped in complete madness makes it stand out above many others as
a show well ahead of it's time. With little to no actual plot, Freakazoid skates the line of mind numbing,
but delivers hilarious and memorable moments with each episode. It's a show for anyone looking for something
very unique, a few good laughs, or just looking to relive some nostalgia. The only complaint I have about this
set in particular is that they re-use episodes on it. Only a few occasions I thought I had accidentally replayed
episodes I had already seen prior, only to find out they were on the discs twice. Not sure why they made that kind
of decision, but it's only a small gripe. It's still fantastic show that should be appreciated.",1402704000,,857,4.607843137254902

3172834,5,B0017INRG8,"If you're looking at this DVD you probably need no critiques from me on this series.
Freakazoid is a satire on the comic book and cartoon heroes from the mid 90's. It's face paced, loud and obnoxious, but incredibly witty. There's enough silliness and action to placate to the baser comedic sensibilities, but some esoteric comedy as well. Lots of references to Hollywood celebrities of old. It follows in the same vein of comedy as Pinky and the Brain, Tiny Toons, and The Animaniacs.

It's fun, it's haywire, it's Freakazoid.",1398902400,,527,4.855555555555555
3172835,3,B0017INRG8,"Like Captain Planet, Freakazoid has what I think is the second most memorable song to an animated show (Captain Planet being the first). While Freakazoid is not the best of the many, many animated superhero shows that were on TV, it is still a good one, and memorable. I recommend this to fans of animated superhero shows, but honestly, it's not great, or even excellent, but it is good, and well worth a look if you wanna see something different and fun for what it is.

3172836,4,B0017INRG8,"Was there ever any cartoon superhero more self-conscious of his own cartoony-ness than Freakazoid? While so many other comedians and cartoon characters spoof superheroes (usually portrayed as pathetic and incompetent), this brilliant series explodes the genre from within. There is a certain level of sophistication integrated into the comedy that keeps it from growing stale after multiple viewings. The only flaw in the first season is that there were two half episodes that were repeated in later shows- the creators probably just didn't have enough material ready at the time. But the two segments starring Lord Bravery (imagine Basil Fawlty as a superhero) are priceless. And watch out for Fan Boy!",1394668800,,703,5.342342342342342

3172838,5,B0017INRG8,"Pros:
 - It's Freakazoid!
 - Zany slapstick in the tradition of WB/Amblin.
 - a surreal weirdness.
 - gave us such classic characters as Lord Bravery, Toby Danger, the Lawn Gnomes, and Candle Jack (Dang!  He got me!).

Cons:
 - they haven't made any new episodes in nearly 15 years.
 - some of the shorts are repeated on multiple episodes.

This show is funny.

Originally conceived to be Amblin Studios answer to Batman, it even involved Bruce Timm doing character designs.  Unfortunately, he dropped out at the last minute, leaving Paul Rugg and John P. McCann with a bunch of designs but no idea what they were supposed to do with them.  But somehow, what they did was magical.

If you're a fan of the zany slapstick humor of Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain, give this show a shot.

If you're a fan of surreal humor like The Holy Grail, give this show a shot.

If you're a fan of superheroes, and want a good parody show, give this a shot.",1391385600,2,945,4.444444444444445

Season one is full of laughs that must be shared with the world.  The humor is quite sophisticated.  The jokes come fast and furious.

3172862,4,B0017INRG8,"The early to mid 1990's were the heyday of Warner Brothers television animation. After the success of ""Tiny Toons,"" ""Batman, the Animated Series,"" and ""Animaniacs,"" Steven Spielberg gave the green light to one more project. ""Freakazoid!"" was the result of Spielberg wanting something really off the wall. He got just that... and then some. Hey, they can't all be ""The Color Purple.""

Imagine Adam Sandler, Jim Carey, and Jerry Lewis in his prime running around in red underwear thwarting bad guys with Loony Tunes slapstick and topical parody, and you get the general idea of ""Freakazoid!"" It was a show so out there that even the WB network wasn't quite sure what to do with it. Too bad. They missed a golden opportunity to increase viewership with the advent of Scream-O-Vision. Why is Paul Harvey suddenly narrating the story? Why is Jack Valenti stopping the story to tell us about the movie rating system? (According to the audio commentary, kids just love Jack Valenti.) And just how many sidekicks will the F-Man go through in just the first season alone?

The transfer quality is excellent. A special feature gives some interesting background on the creative process behind the making of a quality animated TV program, but also shows us how ""Freakazoid"" was made, as well. The commentaries are fun and interesting. I've heard some quibbles about audio quality on these Warners shows, but like the announcer says, it's in stereo ""where available."" So, don't call us if you aren't getting stereo.

Time has passed since the F-man first hit the air. Topical gags might leave you a bit puzzled... well, more so than before. The DVD presents the first season as it aired, which means you get Candle Jack twice, a bit of downer. But you get the original ""We're Not Ready"" WB promos. Plus, check out the voice talents of Riccardo Montalban, Ed Asner, and Stan Freeberg. Plus, you get to see Sharon Stone perform Shakespeare. And she's actually good!

Don't buy this for the kids. They won't get it, and they'll tell you you're lame for watching it. Buy it for yourself, and bask in the glory that was, and still is, the weirdest superhero of all time. Floyd the Barber cuts his hair. Freakazoid! Freakazoid!

3172867,4,B0017INRG8,"Freakazoid was part of the animation revival of the mid 90's.  It was animation targeted to a slightly older audience, utilizing more complex animation techniques including many visual and textual homages to the entertainment that preceded it.  The one thing that Freakazoid does not have, in general, is a plot.  It is almost entirely a vehicle for interesting ideas, jokes, and parodies, with no attempt to weave them into a cohesive whole.

In many ways this is a good thing, unless the target audience are young children.  I believe that young children require a beginning, middle, and end.  Small children also emjoy simple themes and repetition.  Which is to say that Freakazaoid, like much of the animation of the mid 90's, is targeted more for what we now call tweens and older, and in this way it was far ahead of it's time.  There is nothing in the content inappropriate for small children, but I think that most simply will not get it.  This is a departure from much of what Amblin created at the time, so it is an interesting tidbit.

To the DVD itself.  The fourteen episodes are on one single sided dvd and one double sided DVD, so when the second DVD ends, flip it over.  There is some commentary, most of it very good, and nothing I heard should be objectionable to most parents.  The transfer seems to be of good quality.  The only issue is that the subtitles do not seem to run during the comentary.

Two minor negatives.  The first DVD starts with an anti-piracy advertisement which includes footage from the Wizard of Oz.  It begins with a shot of the Wizard, which was disconcerting to me.  I can't imagine what young kids would think of it.  Second, the packaging is made of a plastic does not seem to as tough as the regular DVD case.  Mine broke during shipment, and at some point small pieces of plastic broke off, so keep it away from the very young children.",1225584000,,1885,4.570149253731343
3172868,5,B0017INRG8,"In 1995 I was only nine and woke up diligently for my Saturday morning cartoons. Being something of an oddball kid from day one I took a fond interest in Steven Spielberg's work. ""Tiny Toons"", ""Animaniacs"", and ""Freakazoid"". His series' harken back to the original ""Looney-Tunes"" while being fresh, new, and hilarious no matter what your age. ""Freakazoid"" was probaly the greatest work of them all, a true 'diamond in the rough'.

I'll spare the commentary on the plot's basis and skip right on to the package itself. This two disc collection is completely stuffed full of greatness with commentaries, behind-the-scenes, and the original advertisement Promos (which I remember seeing as a kid). All in all they made sure to cram everything the fans of Freakazoid wanted. My only real issue with the whole set is that the second disc is a dual-sided DVD which is very prone to scratches. I've taken precautions to prevent it but I think that it was a gross oversight to keep costs down. Also be careful to check your DVD case when you get it. Shipping can sometimes dislodge the discs in this case as well as (in my case) break the teeth holding the second disc in place. Luckily there was no damage but keep that in mind.

My vote: If you liked ""Tiny-Toons"" or ""Animaniacs"" even in the slightest the complete first season of ""Freakazoid"" delivers everything that will have you rolling with laughter for hours. So, what're you waiting for, the Horn of Urgency? BUY IT!

3172870,4,B0017INRG8,"I'm finding it challenging to accurately ""star"" this review because I am frankly overjoyed to be able to own this gem of a show on DVD.

THE SHOW: First the good news:  The show is hilarious.  Rating the DVD on the episodes alone I'd give it a 5 of 5.  Some of the humor is decidedly childish, and alot of it relies on a knowledge of the events and culture of the mid-1990s, but when it hits it can be side-splittingly funny.  The extended lament on the loss of the aerial tram at Disneyland has made me laugh for over a decade.

The quality of the shows voice acting is consistently excellent, with inspiring performances by Ed Asner, Ricardo Montleban, David Warner, Paul Rugg and others.

The animation quality is on a par with quality Warner TV animation at the time.  It comes off as a hypbrid of the styles of Batman: The Animated Series and Animaniacs.

THE DVDs:  Now the bad news.  This is not a lovingly restored animated show.  In fact, compared to a number of other 2-D animated features I own on DVD the show looks downright awful.  Noise and artifacting are rampant throughout the discs.  It looks worse than a standard def television broadcast of the same material, which is truly a shame.

On a more positive note, the commentary on 3 episodes is very entertaining and the original promotional spots (which I don't remember ever seeing on TV at the time of the shows airing) are a hoot.

SUMMARY:  Great show, poor transfer, average special features.  I hope it says alot about the quality of the show itself that I will definitely still purchase Season 2 (a meager but rewarding 11 episodes) if/when it is released.

3172872,5,B0017INRG8,"Twice I experienced incontinence on this DVD set.  First time was when I saw it on the store shelf (How did this come out without my knowing it?) and again as I watched it.

If you were in middle or secondary school or even college in the 1990s, and awake when Freakazoid! was shown, you watched this.  The subreferences are almost on par with the original Warner Brothers cartoons (No flames on that, please, The Lobe is launched on the Alpha Omega bomb from Beneath the Planet of the Apes, Mark Hamill makes one of his earliest of many pokes at his Star Wars past in ""Fanboy,"" I win, you lose, PBBB!)

Come for the nostalgia, stay for the fact that this was up there with Ren and Stimpy as one of the best cartoons of the late twentieth century and the humor still holds up.

Now that I'm older I still think the show is amazing. It's got the most random humor that calls back to the likes of Monty Python and early SNL.
I really enjoyed the behind-the-scenes of making Freakazoid and now I understand the method to the madness that is Freakazoid.

3172877,4,B0017INRG8,"The DVD itself isn't worth mentioning.  If I were to rate this set on the merits of video quality and bonus content, it'd *maybe* rate a 3/5.  The quality of the video isn't the nice, remastered stuff.  This one, well, you'll see for yourself.  It's not terrible quality, but it's not much better than if you were watching the show back when it first aired.  The bonus content is about the same level - two little features and 3 episodes with commentaries (though I admit the commentaries were actually funny instead of the usual boring stuff).

In short, the four stars is mostly on the merits of the fact that this show finally made it to DVD.  Sure, it may have been Emmy-winning at one point, but no one remembers it.  People remember the Animaniacs and Tiny Toons, but this one has been lost in time, and it's not surprising considering the wackiness of the show.

Freakazoid is a fabulous cartoon, all sorts of crazy and zany.  However, you're probably already aware of that if you're buying this DVD.",1218067200,,1007,4.575418994413408
3172878,5,B0017INRG8,"When a teen computer nerd named Dexter Douglas, with the help of his cat, types in a strange combination of letters and symbols on his keyboard followed by the delete key, he is sucked into the internet only to return a zany blue superhero in a tight red suit! As Freakazoid, Dexter defends Washington, D.C. against a rather unique gallery of rogues that includes The Lobe, Cave Guy, Longhorn, Guitierrez, Candle Jack, Cobra Queen, and more! Freakazoid's madcap style is part Robin Williams, part The Creeper, part The Mask, and channels Jerry Lewis quite frequently. He's a lot like a fourth Warner, if that Warner were a superhero. As a human, Dexter's still quite a nobody, but as Freakazoid, he hangs with Police Sgt. Cosgrove, drives a cool car, and has one of the hottest girlfriends I've ever seen, Stephanie, AKA Steff. However, all this stuff is only a small portion of the show. Most of your average Freakazoid episode is nonsensical comedy bits/skits ala Monty Python's Flying Circus. It's a lot like ""Animaniacs"", only much crazier! The result is a show that at times is just as funny as anything on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim without having to resort to R-Rated humor (or does that stuff pass for PG13 now? I guess it's TV14 or some boloney rating like that).

This 2 disc set is a great example of what certain OTHER studios SHOULD be doing with their beloved animated shows. Here is a show that has a fairly small cult following, yet WB has seen fit to give it a Season One set release complete with a nice crop of extras. Meanwhile, a big studio like Disney (which I for the most part LOVE as an obsessive Disney fanatic) with hugely popular shows like DuckTales gives us barebones releases of only a few of their titles and sometimes doesn't continue beyond the first season or season and a half if they don't think sales are high enough, and just reflects very little respect or appreciation for the material or the fans in doing so. This ""Freakazoid"" set provides creator commentary for 3 episodes that is a joy to listen to and provides great insight into what is on the screen. In fact, you'll wish every episode, or at least your favorites (which are bound to be different for everyone) had a commentary track. The set also offers a look at some curious promos for the show that give little clue as to what it's about, and there's even a great making-of featurette! Where is all this stuff on the TaleSpin, Darkwing, or Gummi Bears sets, Disney? At the very least, you'd think DuckTales would have had something...

The Steven Spielberg produced comedy show (which originally was going to be a Timm/Dini superhero show that was more hero than comedy, in the vein of Batman's Creeper) offers up 14 episodes in this Season One set, which consists of one single-sided disc and a second, double-sided disc. The episodes are as follows:

1. Five Day Forecast / Dance of Doom / Handman (optional commentary): This first episode is an absolute fave of mine. I'd call it the funniest of Season One, largely due to some zany improv work by the voice actors. Love it! The disturbing Handman bit that never ends when it should is hilarious too!
2. Candle Jack / Toby Danger in Doomsday Bet / The Lobe (optional commentary): Candle Jack is another really hilarious one, a supernatural villain who steals kids from a summer camp simply because, ""He's a nut."" Toby Danger is an extreme spoof of the classic Johnny Quest series, and The Lobe introduces one of Freakazoid's best villains, voiced by the always wonderful David Warner!
3. Mo-Ron / Sewer Rescue / The Big Question / Legends Who Lunch: Mo-Ron is an extremely annoying alien visiting Earth. British hero Lord Bravery attempts to prove his prowess by doing a reluctant sewer rescue. Some aging superheroes chat up a storm while they have lunch.
4. And Fanboy is His Name / Lawn Gnomes: Chapter IV: Fun in the Sun / Frenching with Freakazoid: A character many like but I find too annoyingly stereotypical gets introduced here, supernerd Fanboy. Still a pretty funny story though. Lawn Gnomes is a humorous spoof on Disney's Gargoyles, and Frenching with Freakazoid is a French lesson with the hero himself.
5. Foamy the Freakadog / Office Visit / Ode to Leonard Nimoy / Emergency Broadcast System / Cnversational Nrwegian: Freakazoid introduces us to one of his favorite failed sidekicks, Foamy the Freakadog. Lord Bravery tries to deal with copyright issues in Office Visit, and one of then comes one of the less funny bits of the show, when Fanboy gives us his Ode to Leonard Nimoy. Lastly, Freakazoid does an emergency broadcast test and gives us some instruction in Norwegian.
6. The Cloud / Candle Jack: In a Hitchcock spoof, a strange cloud in the mountains turns people into clowns. This one is most enjoyable to me because of a very personal Disneyland-referencing running gag. The second story in this episode is just a repeat of the fun Candle Jack.
7. The Chip: Part I: The fabulous origin story of Freakazoid is finally told!
8. The Chip: Part II / Freakazoid is History!: The fabulous origin story of Freakazoid is finally finished! Then, Freak spoofs Quantum Leap and travels back in time to stop the attack on Pearl Harbor!
9. Hot Rods from Heck! / A Time for Evil: Dexter's family has a highway run-in with the villainous Longhorn, and then the Huntsman, a Charleton Heston-like hero, is disappointed to find that there is nothing for a superhero to do when crime takes a break.
10. Relax-O-Vision / Fatman and Boy Blubber / Limbo Lock-up / Terror Palace: An encounter with the Lobe is repeatedly interrupted by the show's new feature, Relax-O-Vision, we meet a new superhero team that doesn't seem to be much help, Freak is subjected to the punishment of Fanboy's Disney sci-fi knowledge in the Limbo Lock-Up, and the Hunstman gets disappointed yet again.
11. In Arms Way / The Cloud: A Christmas shopping scene is disrupted when Freak encounters Arms Akimbo (after a delightful meeting with The Lobe). Then, a holiday-themed musical interlude, followed by a repeat of The Cloud.
12. Next Time, Phone Ahead / Nerdator (optional commentary): Steph looks hotter than ever in the background of an E.T. spoof where Mo-Ron returns as Bo-Ron (maybe they're two different idiots who look the same). Then, Freakazoid must save the world's nerds from a villain out to get 'em.
13. House of Freakazoid / Sewer or Later: Another fave of mine due to the subject matter, Lon Tallbutt (a great caricature of Lon Chaney, Jr.) seeks Freakazoid's help to cure him of his werewolf problem, and then Freakazoid must deal with his distaste for poo-gas when he has to go into the sewer to catch Cobra Queen.
14. The Wrath of Guitierrez: Finally, Guitierrez, a villain from the two-part Chip origin story, returns to exact his revenge on Freakazoid! Guitierrez is voiced wonderfully again by Ricardo Montalban.

The funny thing about the 1995 WB animated series ""Freakazoid"", and probably its downfall, is that the humor was really for a much older audience than the early Saturday morning crowd which was exposed to it. A few slightly older audience members with a never dying interest in animated shows are probably the ones who make up the Freakazoid cult-following today; those of us out there buying this great set. And we all hope the second and final season comes to DVD soon too! If you ever enjoyed Animaniacs, Monty Python, the Marx Brothers, or anything wacky, weird, random, and hilarious, you need to give Freakazoid a try!",1217980800,7,7499,4.775038520801233
3172879,5,B0017INRG8,"Though this set dates from 1995, most every joke is as hilarious now as it was when the series first aired.

The only downside is this is only season one, and I really wish they would have included the 11 series two episodes and had made it a ""complete series"" set, as Freakazoid! was moved around so much not only were the S2 episodes hard to catch, WB never reran them after they canned the show.

Anyone who enjoyed the ""Hello, Dolly!"" references in Wall-E will not be able to contain themselves should the season two episode ""Dexter's Date"" ever be released.

In the mean time, be sure to pick up this set; not only will you be laughing hysterically throughout the 13 season one episodes, good sales will convince WB there are enough fans to release season two.",1217894400,2,765,4.489208633093525
3172880,4,B0017INRG8,"4/5 stars... if I'm a so called ""freakafan"" why only 4?  Well to be honest, the picture quality (as played through a Xbox 360 to a 26"" HD Vizio) was pretty bad. It wasn't the crip/cleaness I had expected from other animated titles I've watched... Ghost in the Shell, Gummi Bears., etc... It seems more like a TV copy than anything pulled from original files.

The other issue that bug/bothers me about the DVD set is the fact they don't seem to show season one as I remember season one airing, and after doing research it does seem they've changed how the shows aired.  Even adding a compilation episode created, i believe, after the show stopped airing... which is fine by me, but my problem with it is they added it so that you repeat the ""candle jack"" skit on the same disc.

But Even after that it's still the same Freakazoid goodness, and I still laugh like I always do when watching this crazy... amazingly self-aware show. It it still to this day one of my top 3 favorite animated shows. Very few cartoons made/make me laugh like Freakazoid does, and the money spent is sooo well worth it for the laughs!

3172881,5,B0017INRG8,"FREAKAZOID! Season One: Released July 29, 2008 by Warner Home Video.

A Typically Long DVD Review by Joe Torcivia.

Watching this set brings back pleasant memories of Saturday mornings with the now-defunct Kids WB and weekday evenings with the might-as-well-be-defunct Cartoon Network.

FREAKAZOID! is a wacky, manic superhero who protects, saves, and works for the betterment of mankind, unless (as his theme song goes) ""...something better's  on TV"".

Freakazoid! is also the most underappreciated, flat-out funniest animated series ever produced for Saturday morning TV.

If you enjoy WB's better known `90s hits ANIMANIACS and BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES, FREAKAZOID! is the perfect bridge between the two - with its expert melding of off-the-wall humor with superheroes and villains...  If you enjoy the abrupt, now-expected digressions and ""callbacks"" to earlier bits that is a hallmark of FAMILY GUY... You will love FREAKAZOID!

You will also love his cast of characters:  Good Guys include Police Sgt. Cosgrove (preformed in marvelous deadpan by the great Ed Asner), the prissy, ""John Cleese-like"" Lord Bravery, the ultra-intense Huntsman- who combines Charlton Heston with DC Comics' Green Arrow, Toby Danger - a dead-on parody of Hanna-Barbera's adventure cartoon JONNY QUEST, and the ""all-too-familiar-to-some of us"" Fanboy, appropriately voiced by ""Animal House's"" Stephen Furst.

And, oh those bad guys... The witty, urbane, loin cloth-clad brute Cave Guy, Candle Jack (a Jack Palance-like masked phantom that brings terror to the night), the half-man / half-steer Longhorn - more like half-Johnny Cash and half Mister Ed.  And special props for Ricardo Montalban as Armando Guitierrez, a portrayal so over the top that it would justly earn ""The Wrath (and admiration) of Khan""!

...And Best for Last: David Warner (the starkly serious Ra's Al Ghul on BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES) as The Lobe.  The Lobe, whose head consists of a big, squishy brain with facial features, is Freakazoid's most enduring enemy.

The key to defeating The Lobe lies as much in undermining his dignity as in thwarting his plans, as you will see when Freakazoid expertly toys with him in such mini-classics as ""Handman"" and ""The Lobe"".  Freakazoid and The Lobe may have the strangest hero/villain relationship in history of super-heroic fiction.  They find an odd sort of validation in each other.  They exchange Christmas gifts.  The Lobe abandons an evil plan just because Freakazoid rants about how stupid it is!  And, in the second season, we learn that there is little satisfaction in ""doing bad"" for The Lobe, unless he can get Freakazoid to chase him - and Freakazoid abandons a date rather than let his baddie-buddy down!  This is wonderful stuff, people!

Beyond the characters created for the show, there is an almost endless parade of guest players from reality and pop culture.  One short episode alone (""Freakazoid is History"") features President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, Barbara Streisand, Rush Limbaugh, Joan Rivers, Kate Smith, Sharon Stone, and Pinky and The Brain!

Other such luminaries range from late night talk show host Tom Snyder, to Princess Diana, and Pope John Paul II... yes, really!

The stories are first rate comedy and satire.  There's a wicked piece of work by famed writer Paul Dini on ""nerds"". And you will NEVER AGAIN hear the old ""Theme from a Summer Place"" (If you don't recognize the name, you'll know it when you hear it!) without thinking of  ""Relax-O-Vision"" - an anti-violence innovation foisted upon Freakazoid by a ""know-better"" Kids WB TV executive played by Ben Stein!.

Needless to say, this stuff sailed over the heads of the Sat AM kiddie crowd, and FREAKAZOID! left the air after two seasons.  But, if we're all good little Freak-A-Fans and buy this set, WHV might reward us with the Second Season.  There we'll see a regular role for Jonathan Harris of LOST IN SPACE (tributing his ""Doctor Smith"" character), an absolutely hysterical sequence where The Lobe performs a musical number from Hello Dolly, and witness Freakazoid, and fellow WB animated stars Wacko Warner, and The Brain argue with Executive Producer Steven Spielberg over who is Spielberg's favorite!

To the DVD set itself, yes it should have been ""The Complete Series"" as there were only 11 episodes in the Second Season!

But, in Warner's favor, they've improved the packaging over the type I've complained about in other reviews, where one disc of a two-disc set rests upon another.  With such packaging, you cannot handle or remove DISC TWO without first removing and handling DISC ONE.  There is always potential, however slight, for damage with packaging of this sort.  Here, they've put DISC ONE on a hinged holder and DISC TWO rests on the back, inside wall of the package.  An improvement, I'd say.

There is a ""phantom episode"" on DISC ONE, consisting of ""The Cloud"" and ""Candle Jack"", that must have been originally shown as such on Kids WB in 1995.  Both cartoons are elsewhere on the set... BUT, there is an alternate end credits sequence (that you may not even notice, unless you watch closely) with different gags hidden therein.  One of those gags relates specifically to ""Candle Jack"" - and is seen nowhere else in the series!  So, this is less of a ""cheat"" than it appears.

For a two-disc set, WHV is overly generous with the Extra Features.  Three episode commentaries with creators Paul Rugg, John P. Mc Cann, and Tom Ruegger, a number of original promos that predate the series to the point that there was still NO FOOTAGE OF FREAKAZOID! TO USE in these promos (!), and a very informative documentary on the genesis of FREAKAZOID! Hint: It didn't start out, as it ended up!

Anyone who has never seen FREAKAZOID!, or has not seen it recently, owes it to themselves to get this set!  Despite lacking the handful of second season shows, it receives my highest recommendation.",1217721600,,5914,5.059855521155831
3172882,4,B0017INRG8,"This show made me watch the credits. It made me video tape it to watch the credits. For embedding in the credits are often ""fake"" screens filled with in jokes, or references to the times ""Emmet Nerveend"" shows up. It was always funny.

Maybe the DVD show's sales will be compelling enough to allow for the show's character to be resurrected (like FUTURAMA) in a movie or new series.",1217635200,2,382,4.536231884057971

Now his wacky adventures are finally on a special 2-disc set (One of the discs is 2-sided !) capturing the complete first season with fourteen frenetic episodes !  With vile villains, stupid sidekicks, and lots of other weird stuff, you'd find it hard to believe this series has won an Emmy.

The bonus features are also too good to be true: There's a behind-the-scenes feature, promos, and even commentaries on some specific episodes !

3172887,5,B0017INRG8,"I have been waiting for YEARS for WB to release this show on DVD! The first time I became aware of it was when I was watching the TOMORROW show with Tom Snyder and they showed a clip from an episode (it was, as I recall, THE NERDINATOR or something, I don't recall - nerds all over the country were being electronically kidnapped by an alien that looked like the Predator) and Tom Snyder himself was one of the nerds kidnapped. In the cartoon, Snyder had the Pope as a guest and was prattling on about the nerds being kidnapped and went off into this left-field rant about his days as a DJ (""playing the hits and smackin' 'em down""). Snyder loved it, and so did I. ANY cartoon that would throw something like that into the plotline was one I absolutely HAD to see, and it didn't disappoint me. I became a faithful viewer from that moment on and taped as many of them as I could (this was before the days of recordable DVDs, mind). It was absolutely my favorite WB show and I loved it for all the reasons I love the old WB Looney Tunes - they appealed to both adults and kids and were not only funny, but intelligent. It was the first cartoon I'd seen EVER that actually included an Ed Wood reference! Along with that, the voice talent they got for the show - Ed Asner as Cosgrove, the Chief of Police, David Warner as The Lobe, Ricardo Montalban as Gutierrez (""I am NOT a weenie! YOUUUU are the weenie!"") Jonathan Harris as Professor Jones, Clive Revill, Stan Freberg... Man, I LOVED it!!!

Hidden sight gags, double entendres, and the complete and ridiculous lunacy that reminded those of us older folk who watched it, just what it was like to be a kid again. I always thought  the show had an innocence about it that exuded charm and still....never left an opportunity to drop a ""poo gas"" joke.

3172890,3,B0017INRG8,"Hmm, does no one think, like me, the main reason Freakazoid exists was the unexpected box office of Jim Carrey's The Mask?
Regardless, Freakazoid is a hoot, and way funnier than Jim Carrey. The parodies-within-parody - notably Toby Danger - are excellent. Sure it's mostly lowbrow, but throwaway lines from Ed Asner and other superb voice talent is worth listening closely for.
Long overdue.",1216166400,2,391,5.125
3172891,5,B0017INRG8,"For years I have been waiting for this. Now all the fans out there can trade in their grade Z video bootlegs and get a nice clear picture without the little station identification symbol in the corner.

Freakazoid was funny, taking a lot from the old Warner Cartoons (remember how Bugs Bunny would mix it up with real film stars of the day). A recent viewing shows him to be up to date, none of the humor seems to be dated.

Now the two bones to pick:

First Season 1? Why not both seasons in one set?

Some may allude to the Freakazoid Madman controversy. I cannot see it. While both characters have a vague resemblance,  one is a teen with a cartoon attitude, the other was a bit more surreal. I cannot find this too be a complete rip off as another reviewer stated. And even if it was (which it is not) the cartoons are of themselves some of the most enjoyable ones that Warner has put out in decades.

I think this set is worth the price and I will spend a weekend to rewatch it. The pefect gift for the comic geek on your list.",1215129600,4,1032,4.160804020100502
3407314,3,B0017INRG8,"On the one hand the show was brilliant and funny.

On the other hand, it was a complete ripoff of Mike Allred's far superior comic ""Madman"". To my knowledge Allred was never given credit for ""inspiring"" the character or any kind of compensation.",1214352000,2,245,4.6976744186046515
3407315,4,B0017INRG8,"When Warner Bros. started up their own Saturday morning programming block in the form of the now-retired Kids' WB!, new shows were needed to fill up its schedule. One of those shows was ""Freakazoid!"", named for its zany titlular superhero. An example of this guy's wackiness is that, in the first episode, he draws a face on his right hand and calls it his new sidekick, then has it engage in a romantic relationship with his other hand. In a piece of irony, given the huge fandom it's gathered, fans of this show were reportedly hard to come by back when the show was originally airing. The show would eventually gain its cult status through its Cartoon Network reruns, but unfortunately for the fans, production on the series was now cancelled. ""Freakazoid!"" briefly reappeared on In2TV, during which Warner Home Video hinted that it was being considered for the DVD format, and now, about two years later, we're getting that in the form of this.

As with Tom Ruegger's other productions for WB Animation, I'm a big fan of the show, so you're probably wondering why I gave it four stars instead of five. Well, the answer lies in a problem I have that has suspiciously not been mentioned in any of the other reviews posted thus far. ""Freakazoid!"" only ran for 24 episodes, and as we've seen with some of their other DVD sets, Warner Home Video is clearly capable of putting that many episodes on one four-disc set. But for whatever reason, they decided to split this up over two seasonal sets. That doesn't make much sense to me, and it kinda puts the kibosh on a theory I'd been going with last year (that a ""Freakazoid!"" Complete Series set would be released alongside ""Animaniacs""' final volume). I'm told they're doing this in the hopes of generating a lower price tag, which would supposedly make it easier to sell more copies. But if this is how they're going to go with releasing this and ""The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries"", I may have reason to worry when they get around to releasing ""Histeria!"" Plus, since the second season had only 11 episodes, one can only wonder how they're going to handle that set.

But that doesn't bother me as much as an even bigger oddity on the set itself, in the form of the last episode on the first disc. That particular episode contains the segments ""The Cloud"" and ""Candle Jack"", both of which are already featured in episodes 10 and 2, respectively. In other words, this set is including one of those re-arranged filler episodes that Kids' WB! aired early on in the show's run (""Animaniacs"" and ""Histeria!"" had a few of these as well). The ""Pinky and the Brain"" sets didn't overcharge us for the same material by including the filler episodes compiled from segments originally featured on ""Animaniacs"", so why is ""Freakazoid!"" saddled with a similar problem?! Is it so that they can both parts of the two-part episode, ""The Chip"", right at the beginning of disc two? If so, I think it's a rather farfetched excuse. The adjacent ""Tiny Toon Adventures"" DVD set contains eight episodes per disc; therefore, WHV could've just as easily put both parts of ""The Chip"" at the end of disc one if they'd just gotten rid of that giant waste of disc space that is this stupid filler episode. Maybe then they wouldn't have had to make disc two a flipper disc. But no, instead they're giving us a 13-episode set incorrectly advertised as having 14 episodes and making us pay more money for it than we need to, which kinda dilutes the intent of this set being cheaper to buy. This is why I am going to preorder this set here instead of purchasing it at Best Buy.

That's right; despite those above-mentioned flaws, I'm still buying and recommending this set. ""Freakazoid!""'s probably the most popular of WB Animation's collaborations with Amblin Entertainment today, in spite of having a shorter run than its predecessors. And I have to admit, I subscribed to the show on In2TV's now-defunct Hi-Q Video service, but I didn't really watch it much there since I was busy focusing on the woefully-neglected ""Histeria!"" (which, along with ""Road Rovers"", also seriously needs to be released on DVD, in case anyone from Warner Home Video is reading this review). And since the AVI files of all the episodes would probably take up too much space on one's hard drive, this and the eventual second season set is pretty much the best route to go. Besides, in addition to the obligatory retrospective featurette, which will apparently be highlighting the original concept of the show (Freakazoid wasn't always planned to be the crazy guy we know), we're also getting audio commentaries on three episodes (I'm hoping we'll find out who Freakazette was supposed to be) and, unless I'm mistaken, actual TV promotional spots (something previously unheard of on DVDs of Kids' WB! shows). So yes, this DVD set is definitely a recommended purchase; just be sure you get it for a cheaper price like I'll be doing.",1211414400,8,4924,4.736596736596737

From the parodies, through the many cultural references to the wordplay, it's a comic achievement of the highest order.

If I had one more wish, though, it would be that this set would've contained the complete series because the show didn't even last that long.  Oh boy, oh boy ... I get to watch Fanboy to my little heart's content.  ""Sulu!  I'm walkin' with Sulu!""

3407319,5,B0017INRG8,"If you're a fan of the spontaneous humor of the Animaniacs, then you'll love this show. Dexter Douglas uses the power of cyberspace to become the superhero Freakazoid (this was in the early days of the internet, so it seemed like a mysterious thing at the time). Unfortunately, Freakazoid isn't your normal superhero. Yes, he has superpowers (the funniest being when he flies by stretching his arms out and making wind noises as he runs around). Yes, he has supervillains. But he's not Batman by any means! He's fun and frantic and full of humor.

Each episode usually had one skit running throughout the show, with tiny sketches built into it like little commercial breaks. One of the best was ""Frenching with Freakazoid"", in which he would teach a French phrase. Most of them wouldn't be something you'd use in a normal conversation however (""Who cut the cheese?""). The frenetic pace of the show keeps it from being boring, and I'm so glad to see it finally make it to disc.

Superman has Lex Luthor, Batman has the Joker, and Freakazoid has Mo-Ron (yep, just like it sounds). Like I said earlier, if you're a fan of Animaniacs and Pinky & The Brain, this show will be a perfect fit for you. Never boring!",1207958400,36,1207,4.635514018691588

very unique, a few good laughs, or just looking to relive some nostalgia. The only complaint I have about this
set in particular is that they re-use episodes on it. Only a few occasions I thought I had accidentally replayed

The only flaw in the first season is that there were two half episodes that were repeated in later shows- the creators probably just didn't have enough material ready at the time.

 - It's Freakazoid!
 - Zany slapstick in the tradition of WB/Amblin.

 - gave us such classic characters as Lord Bravery, Toby Danger, the Lawn Gnomes, and Candle Jack (Dang!  He got me!).

Cons:
 - they haven't made any new episodes in nearly 15 years.
 - some of the shorts are repeated on multiple episodes.

This show is funny.

Originally conceived to be Amblin Studios answer to Batman, it even involved Bruce Timm doing character designs.  Unfortunately, he dropped out at the last minute, leaving Paul Rugg and John P.

If you're a fan of the zany slapstick humor of Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain, give this show a shot.

""Freakazoid!"" was the result of Spielberg wanting something really off the wall. He got just that... and then some. Hey, they can't all be ""The Color Purple.""

Imagine Adam Sandler, Jim Carey, and Jerry Lewis in his prime running around in red underwear thwarting bad guys with Loony Tunes slapstick and topical parody, and you get the general idea of ""Freakazoid!"" It was a show so out there that even the WB network wasn't quite sure what to do with it. Too bad. They missed a golden opportunity to increase viewership with the advent of Scream-O-Vision. Why is Paul Harvey suddenly narrating the story? Why is Jack Valenti stopping the story to tell us about the movie rating system? (According to the audio commentary, kids just love Jack Valenti.) And just how many sidekicks will the F-Man go through in just the first season alone?

The transfer quality is excellent. A special feature gives some interesting background on the creative process behind the making of a quality animated TV program, but also shows us how ""Freakazoid"" was made, as well. The commentaries are fun and interesting. I've heard some quibbles about audio quality on these Warners shows, but like the announcer says, it's in stereo ""where available."" So, don't call us if you aren't getting stereo.

Time has passed since the F-man first hit the air. Topical gags might leave you a bit puzzled... well, more so than before. The DVD presents the first season as it aired, which means you get Candle Jack twice, a bit of downer. But you get the original ""We're Not Ready"" WB promos. Plus, check out the voice talents of Riccardo Montalban, Ed Asner, and Stan Freeberg. Plus, you get to see Sharon Stone perform Shakespeare. And she's actually good!

Don't buy this for the kids. They won't get it, and they'll tell you you're lame for watching it. Buy it for yourself, and bask in the glory that was, and still is, the weirdest superhero of all time. Floyd the Barber cuts his hair. Freakazoid! Freakazoid!

3407364,4,B0017INRG8,"Freakazoid was part of the animation revival of the mid 90's.  It was animation targeted to a slightly older audience, utilizing more complex animation techniques including many visual and textual homages to the entertainment that preceded it.  The one thing that Freakazoid does not have, in general, is a plot.  It is almost entirely a vehicle for interesting ideas, jokes, and parodies, with no attempt to weave them into a cohesive whole.

In many ways this is a good thing, unless the target audience are young children.  I believe that young children require a beginning, middle, and end.  Small children also emjoy simple themes and repetition.  Which is to say that Freakazaoid, like much of the animation of the mid 90's, is targeted more for what we now call tweens and older, and in this way it was far ahead of it's time.  There is nothing in the content inappropriate for small children, but I think that most simply will not get it.  This is a departure from much of what Amblin created at the time, so it is an interesting tidbit.

To the DVD itself.  The fourteen episodes are on one single sided dvd and one double sided DVD, so when the second DVD ends, flip it over.  There is some commentary, most of it very good, and nothing I heard should be objectionable to most parents.  The transfer seems to be of good quality.  The only issue is that the subtitles do not seem to run during the comentary.

Two minor negatives.  The first DVD starts with an anti-piracy advertisement which includes footage from the Wizard of Oz.  It begins with a shot of the Wizard, which was disconcerting to me.  I can't imagine what young kids would think of it.  Second, the packaging is made of a plastic does not seem to as tough as the regular DVD case.  Mine broke during shipment, and at some point small pieces of plastic broke off, so keep it away from the very young children.",1225584000,,1885,4.570149253731343
3407365,5,B0017INRG8,"In 1995 I was only nine and woke up diligently for my Saturday morning cartoons. Being something of an oddball kid from day one I took a fond interest in Steven Spielberg's work. ""Tiny Toons"", ""Animaniacs"", and ""Freakazoid"". His series' harken back to the original ""Looney-Tunes"" while being fresh, new, and hilarious no matter what your age. ""Freakazoid"" was probaly the greatest work of them all, a true 'diamond in the rough'.

I'll spare the commentary on the plot's basis and skip right on to the package itself. This two disc collection is completely stuffed full of greatness with commentaries, behind-the-scenes, and the original advertisement Promos (which I remember seeing as a kid). All in all they made sure to cram everything the fans of Freakazoid wanted. My only real issue with the whole set is that the second disc is a dual-sided DVD which is very prone to scratches. I've taken precautions to prevent it but I think that it was a gross oversight to keep costs down. Also be careful to check your DVD case when you get it. Shipping can sometimes dislodge the discs in this case as well as (in my case) break the teeth holding the second disc in place. Luckily there was no damage but keep that in mind.

My vote: If you liked ""Tiny-Toons"" or ""Animaniacs"" even in the slightest the complete first season of ""Freakazoid"" delivers everything that will have you rolling with laughter for hours. So, what're you waiting for, the Horn of Urgency? BUY IT!

3407367,4,B0017INRG8,"I'm finding it challenging to accurately ""star"" this review because I am frankly overjoyed to be able to own this gem of a show on DVD.

THE SHOW: First the good news:  The show is hilarious.  Rating the DVD on the episodes alone I'd give it a 5 of 5.  Some of the humor is decidedly childish, and alot of it relies on a knowledge of the events and culture of the mid-1990s, but when it hits it can be side-splittingly funny.  The extended lament on the loss of the aerial tram at Disneyland has made me laugh for over a decade.

The quality of the shows voice acting is consistently excellent, with inspiring performances by Ed Asner, Ricardo Montleban, David Warner, Paul Rugg and others.

The animation quality is on a par with quality Warner TV animation at the time.  It comes off as a hypbrid of the styles of Batman: The Animated Series and Animaniacs.

THE DVDs:  Now the bad news.  This is not a lovingly restored animated show.  In fact, compared to a number of other 2-D animated features I own on DVD the show looks downright awful.  Noise and artifacting are rampant throughout the discs.  It looks worse than a standard def television broadcast of the same material, which is truly a shame.

On a more positive note, the commentary on 3 episodes is very entertaining and the original promotional spots (which I don't remember ever seeing on TV at the time of the shows airing) are a hoot.

SUMMARY:  Great show, poor transfer, average special features.  I hope it says alot about the quality of the show itself that I will definitely still purchase Season 2 (a meager but rewarding 11 episodes) if/when it is released.

The subreferences are almost on par with the original Warner Brothers cartoons (No flames on that, please, The Lobe is launched on the Alpha Omega bomb from Beneath the Planet of the Apes, Mark Hamill makes one of his earliest of many pokes at his Star Wars past in ""Fanboy,"" I win, you lose, PBBB!)

3407374,4,B0017INRG8,"The DVD itself isn't worth mentioning.  If I were to rate this set on the merits of video quality and bonus content, it'd *maybe* rate a 3/5.  The quality of the video isn't the nice, remastered stuff.  This one, well, you'll see for yourself.  It's not terrible quality, but it's not much better than if you were watching the show back when it first aired.  The bonus content is about the same level - two little features and 3 episodes with commentaries (though I admit the commentaries were actually funny instead of the usual boring stuff).

In short, the four stars is mostly on the merits of the fact that this show finally made it to DVD.  Sure, it may have been Emmy-winning at one point, but no one remembers it.  People remember the Animaniacs and Tiny Toons, but this one has been lost in time, and it's not surprising considering the wackiness of the show.

Freakazoid is a fabulous cartoon, all sorts of crazy and zany.  However, you're probably already aware of that if you're buying this DVD.",1218067200,,1007,4.575418994413408
3407375,5,B0017INRG8,"When a teen computer nerd named Dexter Douglas, with the help of his cat, types in a strange combination of letters and symbols on his keyboard followed by the delete key, he is sucked into the internet only to return a zany blue superhero in a tight red suit! As Freakazoid, Dexter defends Washington, D.C. against a rather unique gallery of rogues that includes The Lobe, Cave Guy, Longhorn, Guitierrez, Candle Jack, Cobra Queen, and more! Freakazoid's madcap style is part Robin Williams, part The Creeper, part The Mask, and channels Jerry Lewis quite frequently. He's a lot like a fourth Warner, if that Warner were a superhero. As a human, Dexter's still quite a nobody, but as Freakazoid, he hangs with Police Sgt. Cosgrove, drives a cool car, and has one of the hottest girlfriends I've ever seen, Stephanie, AKA Steff. However, all this stuff is only a small portion of the show. Most of your average Freakazoid episode is nonsensical comedy bits/skits ala Monty Python's Flying Circus. It's a lot like ""Animaniacs"", only much crazier! The result is a show that at times is just as funny as anything on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim without having to resort to R-Rated humor (or does that stuff pass for PG13 now? I guess it's TV14 or some boloney rating like that).

This 2 disc set is a great example of what certain OTHER studios SHOULD be doing with their beloved animated shows. Here is a show that has a fairly small cult following, yet WB has seen fit to give it a Season One set release complete with a nice crop of extras. Meanwhile, a big studio like Disney (which I for the most part LOVE as an obsessive Disney fanatic) with hugely popular shows like DuckTales gives us barebones releases of only a few of their titles and sometimes doesn't continue beyond the first season or season and a half if they don't think sales are high enough, and just reflects very little respect or appreciation for the material or the fans in doing so. This ""Freakazoid"" set provides creator commentary for 3 episodes that is a joy to listen to and provides great insight into what is on the screen. In fact, you'll wish every episode, or at least your favorites (which are bound to be different for everyone) had a commentary track. The set also offers a look at some curious promos for the show that give little clue as to what it's about, and there's even a great making-of featurette! Where is all this stuff on the TaleSpin, Darkwing, or Gummi Bears sets, Disney? At the very least, you'd think DuckTales would have had something...

The Steven Spielberg produced comedy show (which originally was going to be a Timm/Dini superhero show that was more hero than comedy, in the vein of Batman's Creeper) offers up 14 episodes in this Season One set, which consists of one single-sided disc and a second, double-sided disc. The episodes are as follows:

1. Five Day Forecast / Dance of Doom / Handman (optional commentary): This first episode is an absolute fave of mine. I'd call it the funniest of Season One, largely due to some zany improv work by the voice actors. Love it! The disturbing Handman bit that never ends when it should is hilarious too!
2. Candle Jack / Toby Danger in Doomsday Bet / The Lobe (optional commentary): Candle Jack is another really hilarious one, a supernatural villain who steals kids from a summer camp simply because, ""He's a nut."" Toby Danger is an extreme spoof of the classic Johnny Quest series, and The Lobe introduces one of Freakazoid's best villains, voiced by the always wonderful David Warner!
3. Mo-Ron / Sewer Rescue / The Big Question / Legends Who Lunch: Mo-Ron is an extremely annoying alien visiting Earth. British hero Lord Bravery attempts to prove his prowess by doing a reluctant sewer rescue. Some aging superheroes chat up a storm while they have lunch.
4. And Fanboy is His Name / Lawn Gnomes: Chapter IV: Fun in the Sun / Frenching with Freakazoid: A character many like but I find too annoyingly stereotypical gets introduced here, supernerd Fanboy. Still a pretty funny story though. Lawn Gnomes is a humorous spoof on Disney's Gargoyles, and Frenching with Freakazoid is a French lesson with the hero himself.
5. Foamy the Freakadog / Office Visit / Ode to Leonard Nimoy / Emergency Broadcast System / Cnversational Nrwegian: Freakazoid introduces us to one of his favorite failed sidekicks, Foamy the Freakadog. Lord Bravery tries to deal with copyright issues in Office Visit, and one of then comes one of the less funny bits of the show, when Fanboy gives us his Ode to Leonard Nimoy. Lastly, Freakazoid does an emergency broadcast test and gives us some instruction in Norwegian.
6. The Cloud / Candle Jack: In a Hitchcock spoof, a strange cloud in the mountains turns people into clowns. This one is most enjoyable to me because of a very personal Disneyland-referencing running gag. The second story in this episode is just a repeat of the fun Candle Jack.
7. The Chip: Part I: The fabulous origin story of Freakazoid is finally told!
8. The Chip: Part II / Freakazoid is History!: The fabulous origin story of Freakazoid is finally finished! Then, Freak spoofs Quantum Leap and travels back in time to stop the attack on Pearl Harbor!
9. Hot Rods from Heck! / A Time for Evil: Dexter's family has a highway run-in with the villainous Longhorn, and then the Huntsman, a Charleton Heston-like hero, is disappointed to find that there is nothing for a superhero to do when crime takes a break.
10. Relax-O-Vision / Fatman and Boy Blubber / Limbo Lock-up / Terror Palace: An encounter with the Lobe is repeatedly interrupted by the show's new feature, Relax-O-Vision, we meet a new superhero team that doesn't seem to be much help, Freak is subjected to the punishment of Fanboy's Disney sci-fi knowledge in the Limbo Lock-Up, and the Hunstman gets disappointed yet again.
11. In Arms Way / The Cloud: A Christmas shopping scene is disrupted when Freak encounters Arms Akimbo (after a delightful meeting with The Lobe). Then, a holiday-themed musical interlude, followed by a repeat of The Cloud.
12. Next Time, Phone Ahead / Nerdator (optional commentary): Steph looks hotter than ever in the background of an E.T. spoof where Mo-Ron returns as Bo-Ron (maybe they're two different idiots who look the same). Then, Freakazoid must save the world's nerds from a villain out to get 'em.
13. House of Freakazoid / Sewer or Later: Another fave of mine due to the subject matter, Lon Tallbutt (a great caricature of Lon Chaney, Jr.) seeks Freakazoid's help to cure him of his werewolf problem, and then Freakazoid must deal with his distaste for poo-gas when he has to go into the sewer to catch Cobra Queen.
14. The Wrath of Guitierrez: Finally, Guitierrez, a villain from the two-part Chip origin story, returns to exact his revenge on Freakazoid! Guitierrez is voiced wonderfully again by Ricardo Montalban.

The funny thing about the 1995 WB animated series ""Freakazoid"", and probably its downfall, is that the humor was really for a much older audience than the early Saturday morning crowd which was exposed to it. A few slightly older audience members with a never dying interest in animated shows are probably the ones who make up the Freakazoid cult-following today; those of us out there buying this great set. And we all hope the second and final season comes to DVD soon too! If you ever enjoyed Animaniacs, Monty Python, the Marx Brothers, or anything wacky, weird, random, and hilarious, you need to give Freakazoid a try!",1217980800,7,7499,4.775038520801233

The only downside is this is only season one, and I really wish they would have included the 11 series two episodes and had made it a ""complete series"" set, as Freakazoid! was moved around so much not only were the S2 episodes hard to catch, WB never reran them after they canned the show.

Anyone who enjoyed the ""Hello, Dolly!"" references in Wall-E will not be able to contain themselves should the season two episode ""Dexter's Date"" ever be released.

In the mean time, be sure to pick up this set; not only will you be laughing hysterically throughout the 13 season one episodes, good sales will convince WB there are enough fans to release season two.",1217894400,2,765,4.489208633093525

It wasn't the crip/cleaness I had expected from other animated titles I've watched... Ghost in the Shell, Gummi Bears., etc... It seems more like a TV copy than anything pulled from original files.

The other issue that bug/bothers me about the DVD set is the fact they don't seem to show season one as I remember season one airing, and after doing research it does seem they've changed how the shows aired.  Even adding a compilation episode created, i believe, after the show stopped airing... which is fine by me, but my problem with it is they added it so that you repeat the ""candle jack"" skit on the same disc.

But Even after that it's still the same Freakazoid goodness, and I still laugh like I always do when watching this crazy... amazingly self-aware show.

3407378,5,B0017INRG8,"FREAKAZOID! Season One: Released July 29, 2008 by Warner Home Video.

A Typically Long DVD Review by Joe Torcivia.

Watching this set brings back pleasant memories of Saturday mornings with the now-defunct Kids WB and weekday evenings with the might-as-well-be-defunct Cartoon Network.

FREAKAZOID! is a wacky, manic superhero who protects, saves, and works for the betterment of mankind, unless (as his theme song goes) ""...something better's  on TV"".

Freakazoid! is also the most underappreciated, flat-out funniest animated series ever produced for Saturday morning TV.

If you enjoy WB's better known `90s hits ANIMANIACS and BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES, FREAKAZOID! is the perfect bridge between the two - with its expert melding of off-the-wall humor with superheroes and villains...  If you enjoy the abrupt, now-expected digressions and ""callbacks"" to earlier bits that is a hallmark of FAMILY GUY... You will love FREAKAZOID!

You will also love his cast of characters:  Good Guys include Police Sgt. Cosgrove (preformed in marvelous deadpan by the great Ed Asner), the prissy, ""John Cleese-like"" Lord Bravery, the ultra-intense Huntsman- who combines Charlton Heston with DC Comics' Green Arrow, Toby Danger - a dead-on parody of Hanna-Barbera's adventure cartoon JONNY QUEST, and the ""all-too-familiar-to-some of us"" Fanboy, appropriately voiced by ""Animal House's"" Stephen Furst.

And, oh those bad guys... The witty, urbane, loin cloth-clad brute Cave Guy, Candle Jack (a Jack Palance-like masked phantom that brings terror to the night), the half-man / half-steer Longhorn - more like half-Johnny Cash and half Mister Ed.  And special props for Ricardo Montalban as Armando Guitierrez, a portrayal so over the top that it would justly earn ""The Wrath (and admiration) of Khan""!

...And Best for Last: David Warner (the starkly serious Ra's Al Ghul on BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES) as The Lobe.  The Lobe, whose head consists of a big, squishy brain with facial features, is Freakazoid's most enduring enemy.

The key to defeating The Lobe lies as much in undermining his dignity as in thwarting his plans, as you will see when Freakazoid expertly toys with him in such mini-classics as ""Handman"" and ""The Lobe"".  Freakazoid and The Lobe may have the strangest hero/villain relationship in history of super-heroic fiction.  They find an odd sort of validation in each other.  They exchange Christmas gifts.  The Lobe abandons an evil plan just because Freakazoid rants about how stupid it is!  And, in the second season, we learn that there is little satisfaction in ""doing bad"" for The Lobe, unless he can get Freakazoid to chase him - and Freakazoid abandons a date rather than let his baddie-buddy down!  This is wonderful stuff, people!

Beyond the characters created for the show, there is an almost endless parade of guest players from reality and pop culture.  One short episode alone (""Freakazoid is History"") features President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, Barbara Streisand, Rush Limbaugh, Joan Rivers, Kate Smith, Sharon Stone, and Pinky and The Brain!

Other such luminaries range from late night talk show host Tom Snyder, to Princess Diana, and Pope John Paul II... yes, really!

The stories are first rate comedy and satire.  There's a wicked piece of work by famed writer Paul Dini on ""nerds"". And you will NEVER AGAIN hear the old ""Theme from a Summer Place"" (If you don't recognize the name, you'll know it when you hear it!) without thinking of  ""Relax-O-Vision"" - an anti-violence innovation foisted upon Freakazoid by a ""know-better"" Kids WB TV executive played by Ben Stein!.

Needless to say, this stuff sailed over the heads of the Sat AM kiddie crowd, and FREAKAZOID! left the air after two seasons.  But, if we're all good little Freak-A-Fans and buy this set, WHV might reward us with the Second Season.  There we'll see a regular role for Jonathan Harris of LOST IN SPACE (tributing his ""Doctor Smith"" character), an absolutely hysterical sequence where The Lobe performs a musical number from Hello Dolly, and witness Freakazoid, and fellow WB animated stars Wacko Warner, and The Brain argue with Executive Producer Steven Spielberg over who is Spielberg's favorite!

To the DVD set itself, yes it should have been ""The Complete Series"" as there were only 11 episodes in the Second Season!

But, in Warner's favor, they've improved the packaging over the type I've complained about in other reviews, where one disc of a two-disc set rests upon another.  With such packaging, you cannot handle or remove DISC TWO without first removing and handling DISC ONE.  There is always potential, however slight, for damage with packaging of this sort.  Here, they've put DISC ONE on a hinged holder and DISC TWO rests on the back, inside wall of the package.  An improvement, I'd say.

There is a ""phantom episode"" on DISC ONE, consisting of ""The Cloud"" and ""Candle Jack"", that must have been originally shown as such on Kids WB in 1995.  Both cartoons are elsewhere on the set... BUT, there is an alternate end credits sequence (that you may not even notice, unless you watch closely) with different gags hidden therein.  One of those gags relates specifically to ""Candle Jack"" - and is seen nowhere else in the series!  So, this is less of a ""cheat"" than it appears.

For a two-disc set, WHV is overly generous with the Extra Features.  Three episode commentaries with creators Paul Rugg, John P. Mc Cann, and Tom Ruegger, a number of original promos that predate the series to the point that there was still NO FOOTAGE OF FREAKAZOID! TO USE in these promos (!), and a very informative documentary on the genesis of FREAKAZOID! Hint: It didn't start out, as it ended up!

Anyone who has never seen FREAKAZOID!, or has not seen it recently, owes it to themselves to get this set!  Despite lacking the handful of second season shows, it receives my highest recommendation.",1217721600,,5914,5.059855521155831

3407381,5,B0017INRG8,"It's almost unbelievable that this series finally made it to DVD. It was my favorite ""Spielberg series"" of the 90's (along with Tiny Toons). I never cared for Animaniacs or Pinky and the Brain.
But the Freak is definately not for everyone: only those with a sense of humor need apply. The comedy and action is non-stop, the dialogue is awesome and the animation is quite good. Hopefully it'll all sound and look even better on DVD.
But can anyone confirm if this release really has the Portuguese dubbing, as announced here on Amazon? I've read lots of reviews and no one seems to mention it, so maybe it was a typo on Amazon's part?",1217548800,,633,4.51304347826087
3407382,5,B0017INRG8,"Who doesn't love Freakazoid? This show cracked me up as a kid. It is my favorite above Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain AND Tiny Toons, although I'll be collecting them all. The voice acting talent in this show alone should be enough to get one to watch, especially with Ricardo Moltoban in the mix. Many jokes were ""low brow"", as one writer said, but many were also pop culture based, something I enjoy much more now.

Long live Steven Spielberg cartoons.",1217548800,,455,4.617283950617284

3407384,5,B0017INRG8,"I have been waiting for YEARS for WB to release this show on DVD! The first time I became aware of it was when I was watching the TOMORROW show with Tom Snyder and they showed a clip from an episode (it was, as I recall, THE NERDINATOR or something, I don't recall - nerds all over the country were being electronically kidnapped by an alien that looked like the Predator) and Tom Snyder himself was one of the nerds kidnapped. In the cartoon, Snyder had the Pope as a guest and was prattling on about the nerds being kidnapped and went off into this left-field rant about his days as a DJ (""playing the hits and smackin' 'em down""). Snyder loved it, and so did I. ANY cartoon that would throw something like that into the plotline was one I absolutely HAD to see, and it didn't disappoint me. I became a faithful viewer from that moment on and taped as many of them as I could (this was before the days of recordable DVDs, mind). It was absolutely my favorite WB show and I loved it for all the reasons I love the old WB Looney Tunes - they appealed to both adults and kids and were not only funny, but intelligent. It was the first cartoon I'd seen EVER that actually included an Ed Wood reference! Along with that, the voice talent they got for the show - Ed Asner as Cosgrove, the Chief of Police, David Warner as The Lobe, Ricardo Montalban as Gutierrez (""I am NOT a weenie! YOUUUU are the weenie!"") Jonathan Harris as Professor Jones, Clive Revill, Stan Freberg... Man, I LOVED it!!! This is a day-of-issue purchase if ever there was one!",1216857600,,1544,4.327586206896552
3407385,5,B0017INRG8,"Freakazoid! is one of those Saturday morning cartoons that never truly got the respect it deserved by the studio. It almost seemed to be too funny for its own good. Hidden sight gags, double entendres, and the complete and ridiculous lunacy that reminded those of us older folk who watched it, just what it was like to be a kid again. I always thought  the show had an innocence about it that exuded charm and still....never left an opportunity to drop a ""poo gas"" joke. Whether you're 12 or in your 90's, Freakazoid! makes one feel that special glee that puts a shine back in ones eyes not seen in todays new animations.  I will be getting this on the day it is released. So for those who want a fun escape, buy the DVD. For now, I'm off! FWOOOOOOOSH >>>>>>>>>",1216598400,,761,4.390070921985815
3407386,5,B0017INRG8,I almost cried when I saw this! My all-time favorite cartoon show is finally getting the release it deserves! I looked really really close to make sure it wasn't a bootleg hahah its real!! All I need now is the 2nd Season and Freakazoid! to come back on the air after the dam' TV big-wigs see the DVD sales skyrocket and realize they lost a kickash show long ago!!,1216425600,,364,4.2898550724637685
3407387,3,B0017INRG8,"Hmm, does no one think, like me, the main reason Freakazoid exists was the unexpected box office of Jim Carrey's The Mask?
Regardless, Freakazoid is a hoot, and way funnier than Jim Carrey. The parodies-within-parody - notably Toby Danger - are excellent. Sure it's mostly lowbrow, but throwaway lines from Ed Asner and other superb voice talent is worth listening closely for.
Long overdue.",1216166400,2,391,5.125
3407388,5,B0017INRG8,"For years I have been waiting for this. Now all the fans out there can trade in their grade Z video bootlegs and get a nice clear picture without the little station identification symbol in the corner.

Freakazoid was funny, taking a lot from the old Warner Cartoons (remember how Bugs Bunny would mix it up with real film stars of the day). A recent viewing shows him to be up to date, none of the humor seems to be dated.

Now the two bones to pick:

First Season 1? Why not both seasons in one set?

Some may allude to the Freakazoid Madman controversy. I cannot see it. While both characters have a vague resemblance,  one is a teen with a cartoon attitude, the other was a bit more surreal. I cannot find this too be a complete rip off as another reviewer stated. And even if it was (which it is not) the cartoons are of themselves some of the most enjoyable ones that Warner has put out in decades.

I think this set is worth the price and I will spend a weekend to rewatch it. The pefect gift for the comic geek on your list.",1215129600,4,1032,4.160804020100502
