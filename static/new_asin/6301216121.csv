317299,3,6301216121,"This is one of many East meets West love stories of the period, and was the second for William Holden in Hong Kong (he'd previously starred in ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing"" with Jennifer Jones).  In this  movie, not only is the relationship East meets West, it is also  May/December as Holden is much older than Nancy Kwan (her first film,  according to Internet Movie Database).  As it happens, Holden is a fine  enough actor to make the romance fairly believable, though credulity is  strained as there is another young woman chasing his affections, played by  Sylvia Syms.  Holden is less believable in the few action scenes.  The  basic plot is that William Holden is a restless American who leaves the rat  race to become a painter in Hong Kong (or was he already a painter? I  forget).  He rents a room (complete with a great view terrace), in a Hong  Kong brothel, and while searching for models, his attention is naturally  drawn by the stunning Nancy Kwan, a local prostitute.  Matters  are  complicated when he hangs around with the local British society, where his  work draws the impassioned attention of blonde beauty Sylvia Syms, who  happens to have clout in the art world and who instantly decides to  champion his work.  Of course, she finds the artist far more interesting  than his art, and therein hangs a tale.  What carries this movie is the  radiant beauty of the two leading ladies -- both Nancy Kwan and Sylvia Syms  are luminous.  The tension between the two women is very convincing as they  vie against each other for Holden's love.  Indeed, one wishes it could have  led to a catfight.  Alas, this was not to be, but catfight fans will be  pleased to know that Kwan does have a brief brawl with another Chinese  prostitute.  The Hong Kong background is lush and beautiful, and used to  great effect.  The story also has enough complexities and ethical  challenges to sustain interest.  Unfortunately, it is all too typical of  the roles given to Asian actresses -- Nancy Kwan plays a prostitute with  the proverbial heart of gold, and there is also the paternalistic  condescencion taken for granted in those days, with Holden portrayed as the  answer man and Nancy Kwan as the emotional woman he must get in line.  Thus, the movie has a fairly large list of flaws.  Despite this, it is a  well-crafted entertainment with many good points to balance its defecits.  No, there's nothing especially original here, but this type of story has  been successful many times, as it was more recently with ""Pretty  Woman.""  Definitely worth watching.",923097600,36,2573,4.7494305239179955

317536,5,6301216121,"William Holden love stories are wonderful. Bill's acting is superb. This is a Broadway play turned into a film. Thus, the dialogue is a bit choppy with planned laugh sections. Good Nancy Kwan is half-Chinese, or this film would be offensive to pure Chinese. A well told story, but not believable in 2016. Still, brings a tear to my romantic eye. Bill would have been better off with the white girl, even though she was also conniving, but in a better way. I love the 1960 Hong Kong scenery shots. It no longer exists in 2016. Other Bill Holden love stories in descending order of Bill's age: Network (some good dialogue, but main story boring), Breezy (touching, Clint Eastwood's first directorship), World of Suzie Wong, Sunset Boulevard (excellent, but had to compete with All About Eve in 1950). These are major love stories, unfamiliar with Bill's 1940's work. This besides Bill's terrific acting in dramas: Stalag 17, The Bridge on the River Kwai. Bill was a superb actor, great range. Nancy Kwan went on to star in another movie made from a musical, The Flower Drum Song. This Rogers and Hamerstein effort had some great songs. Chopsui, Don't Marry Me, I Enjoy Being a Girl. A short catalogue for Nancy, but these are wonderful performances.",1475366400,3,1247,4.804651162790698

317598,5,6301216121,"This movie is AMAZING. Think of a mash up between Breakfast at Tiffany's and Pretty Woman except it's in Hong Kong with a couple of plot twists. Nancy Kwan and William Holden shine in this dramatic story about Suzie Wong, a young woman who is essentially an ""escort"" and Robert Lomax, an American architect who's trying his hand at painting. Lomax meets Suzie while entering Hong Kong on the ferry, except she introduces herself with a different name, saying that she's a society girl. Later, he checks into a hotel and finds her hanging around at the bar downstairs. When he asks her to be his model, she agrees but soon they find themselves in love. This film is beautifully set on location in Hong Kong and introduces Nancy Kwan in her first motion picture.",1473811200,,760,4.637037037037037

317692,5,6301216121,"brilliant character study, done only as the old masters can do it.  photography is outstanding, really captures the feeling of being in Hong Kong, and without benefit of modern computer technology.  it is a pity that time restraints prevent the movie covering nearly half of the original novel.  Richard Mason is truly a master of character and plot development.  I wish more time in he movie could have been spent developing the characters of the other ""yum yum"" girls as did the novel.  Also, a large part of the original story was omitted in the movie, Those parts were not ""essential"" to the main theme but were very important to understanding the essence of the main characters.  Still, the movie captured barely enough of the characters, due to oscar level performances of William Holden and Nancy Kwan, for the audience to identify with them.  I would like to see a Kevin Costner style remake, about 3 1/2 or 4 hours long to do the novel justice.",1456617600,3,953,4.704819277108434
317763,5,6301216121,"This movie is so urnderrated as a 7.1 rating on IMDB. It takes us to beautiful and colorful Hong Kong and shares the story of two wonderful people who happen to fall in love. It's just not a ""chick-flick"" either. My husband loves this movie as much as I do. It's a classic film of the struggles many human beings face. Rent it or own it. It's a must see!!!",1456358400,4,356,4.1
317764,3,6301216121,"Although William Holden did such great acting, and the whole movie is so well done, I can't help but wonder why Mr. Lomax (William Holden) prefers the pursuit of the tumultuous bar prostitute as opposed to the beautiful socialite. I conclude this is Hollywood wonderment where pixies and unicorns enjoy life in an alternate universe and political correctness is favored over realism. Here we have third country bar sluts portrayed as sweet and somewhat innocent victims. Not that I didn't enjoy this movie but it's as far from reality as movies get. This is just my two cents worth and no doubt I open myself to many who like to troll on those who differ from majority.",1455062400,,669,4.726495726495727

William Holden is an American architect who wants to become a painter. He goes to Hong Kong to pursue his dream and gets in with Nancy Kwan as Suzie Wong. She is a prostitute, although we have to read between the lines. I was more interested in the city than the drama that ensued between Holden and Kwan.

Nancy Kwan, then a 20ish Eurasian beauty, is wonderful as Suzie Wong, William Holden holds up his end of the romance, and the supporting cast is excellent.  There are plenty of exterior shots of Hong Kong circa 1960, which is also interesting.  This won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it works very well for me.  After watching the film a number of times, I read the book upon which it's based.  It had more detail, of course, but it was surprising how well the film captured the story in the book.  One tidbit from the book - the character Wednesday Lu, was named that because all the girls had to go to the doctor for an STD check once a week - in her case, on Wednesday.",1438387200,6,842,4.251572327044025

317912,2,6301216121,"I had a fantasy love affair with Nancy Kwan when I saw ""The World of.."" when I was twelve or thirteen.  It was big, even if I cringe now at how little of China she personifies.  And, she's still very beautiful, and that was the point: the naturally superior beauty (read 'fragile') unable to evolve in a brutal and dangerous environment.  The handsome, fatherly Holden, a poster-child of the Protestant hero ilk  (without cowboy dress) arrives in exotic Hong Kong on a mission, or 'quest', if you like, to turn his virile force of nature (read ""Fountainhead"") into staking all his true grit on making a personal difference to do good.  Ok, let's just say, the movie hasn't aged well, and the script gives the characters no room to move out of the cardboard they are trapped in.  However, denying one's essential twelve year old love affairs is in a category of sin all its own.  Having read Kwan's biography on Wikipedia did convince me she's her own person, not just another pretty girl.  I could (an did) do much worse with my twelve-year-old love-life.",1432944000,,1055,4.664864864864865

It handled the subject of prostitution in a palatable way that not only let's you into their world, but also opens your heart to their plight of survival.  If you've never seen it...I think you will find it quite enjoyable.  Also seeing Hong Kong in that time period is quite removed from today.",1408406400,,477,4.3977272727272725

The story may be distasteful to some people, but a bit of humor helps. I had read the book ""The World of Suzie Wong"" and saw the stage play in San Francisco, all within a year or two of seeing the movie and all seemed to convey the story quite well.

318326,5,6301216121,"What the big screen was like and exactly what it's missing today.
Light-hearted, captivating and full blown eye candy of China in the 60's.  A simple love story that boldly crosses barriers, yet respects traditions. Mrs. Kwans' character, Suzie Wong though a prostitute, brings honor to a profession she's forced to do and her love for Robert Lomax (Played by William Holden) beams with devotion and loyalty. Lomax, marked the moment he arrived in China,  is destined to fall deeply for Ms. Wong. He was bitten & smitten before he ever left the boat!
William Holden and Nancy Kwan are fabulous.  Nominated for the golden globe of Best Actress, Mrs. Kwan may have lost, but the film will endure and delight for many years to come.  Enjoy!",1398729600,,737,4.7795275590551185

I had been to Hong Kong in 1972 and again this past month, so the comparisons to how I remembered the city in the 70s, how it looked in the movie and in 2014 were very intriguing.  The story line was true to life as I remembered it in the 70s and was well acted.  This movie has much to say about double standards and the lack of choices for the uneducated and poor.",1398643200,,437,4.0

A great purpose for color film.  The story is simple and as old as...the oldest profession, but warmly engaging.  Some of the themes in the film are understandably awkward and perhaps outdated, but with apologies to the ""Biggest Little Whorehouse in Texas"", who doesn't want to believe in a PG-rated brothel?  Don't let that get in your way as the movie will take you back to a gorgeous place in what seemed to be a simpler time.  I keep going back to revisit and enjoy...like the company of an old friend.",1397779200,4,676,4.575

318470,4,6301216121,"Yes, it's very good, and many have explained why, along with the ins and outs of cultural views at the time.  But I like that it goes deep enough to see both characters, and Kwan and Holden are terrific.  The script is daring for the times, but of course now we'd like it go further, much like The Americanization of Emily.  If you don't love classic film and have some interest in China, it won't grab you.  If you loved The Sand Pebbles, this will strike similar cross-cultural romance chords, but I'd call that a 5 and this a 4.",1388793600,,531,4.28

An abrupt end given the knowledge as to how the book carries on after the mudslide that kills Suzie's son. So this left me disappointed for up until the end. I was so pleased with how I could recall the story for it just flowed from page to page, until the abrupt end. I'll watch it once more before I return it to the library given the very fact that it took 4 months for me to get my hands on it, and there are yet others whom want to watch it behind me.

While I was in the U.S. Navy in the early 1960s The ship I was serving on, The U.S.S Lexington Aircraft Carrier, visited the port of Hong Kong. It was still under British rule at that time. The great photography of this movie reminds me of how it looked at that time. I visited Aberdeen where I took a ride on a small Junk (boat) out to one of the two floating restaurants.  It was very interesting because the lady rowing the boat used only one oar, which was positioned to extend out the back of the boat instead of over the side of the boat. She moved the oar back and forth like a fish's tail to propel the boat forward.

When he interacted with the banker who called him ""young man,"" I did a double take. Holden did a wonderful job in this film and his portrayal was compassionate and sympathetic, so his age didn't make his character any less believable. I was drawn right into the story.

since I was a child. Beautiful storyline, wonderful acting by William Holden and Nancy Kwan. Scene takes place in the poorest
part of Hong Kong where Nancy Kwan is a prostitute and William Holden is on leave from his job in the states as a architect wanting
to become an artist in Hong Kong China. He meets Nancy Kwan on a ferry in Hong Kong and she is pretending to be a aristocristic
person of some importance which she does throughout the movie (she has a terrible self-esteem problem) and William Holden
has a tight budget to live off of and rents a room for a month in a brothel hotel where he once again meets Suzie Wong. The Hotel
is loaded with U.S. Miltary Sailors, whom seem to be very familiar with Suzie Wong along with all of the other girls who are prostitutes
as well. Suzie Wong is uneducated, no family, has a child whom no one seems to know about, except the elderly lady who takes care
of her baby. Meanwhile, William Holden, hires Suzie Wong, as a model and paints many pictures of her. Eventually they fail inlove
and William Holden cannot handle her life as a prostitute. This is a tender love story altho you will have to see the movie as oppose
to someone telling you about it. It is very, very sad that as human beings we have to pretend to be something we are not in order to
be accepted in Society. The description that I have given about this movie does not sound very tasteful, but, what is more important
being loved and accepted for who and what you are or as we often do in this country try to become all that we can in order to become accepted. Watch this movie, and give your own synopsis. God Bless.  Mrs. D.L.WilliamsCrayton, Sept. 19,2013",1379376000,6,1802,4.354166666666667

It is about an artist, his work and his love life, filmed on location in the Hong Kong of 1960, which is an entire living canvas in itself, offering a long detailed tour of this teeming metropolis some 50 years ago. Even his hotel room is a work of art. One of William Holdens finest movies, Nancy Kwans best work and a good look at the seldom seen Michael Wilding, Elizabeths Taylors second husband. Be sure to look at the detail in Holdens hotel room  the dcor, the coloration, the lighting superb art direction. And the paintings will speak for themselves.

Nancy Kwan is a perfect fit and is just beautiful.  I have it on VHS and would love to have a restored DVD as the scenery of Hong Kong is so wonderful.  I just don't know if the DVD is actually restored or remastered. I was in Hong Kong a few years ago and we did a tour of the harbour. Not the same now as it was then but still very colorful. I thought it was so typical of a man that even though he has little money he takes her to a fancy restaurant for dinner where she is terribly uncomfortable just so he can show off to her. She would have been happy sharing a bowl of rice with him at a street vendor. I think that anyone would enjoy this movie.

In many ways it looks similar today, but with out the super skyscrapers now towering over the expanding Hong Kong waterfront. There also seemed to be more Wan Chai street action in the 50's than now, but I may be wrong on that one? However, the Star Ferry looks like the same boat I was on just two months ago? A fun trip down memory lane for sure.

I also really enjoyed the story and acting of Nancy Kwan and William Holder; they are a perfect match. What begins almost a comedy, with witty and amusing dialog between the stars, concludes over two hours later an intense happy-ending drama. This movie is a classic and ahead of its time; imagine, casting Asian women to play Asian women!!

318743,5,6301216121,"A love story.  A commentary on racial prejudice in 1960's Hong Kong.  A man and woman see each other, not by the color of their skin, nor by their socio-economic status, but as two people, who love and care for each other; of course, not without its struggles. I have seen this movie many, many, times, and I will view it again.

American architect Robert Lomax is an aspiring artist who relocates to Hong Kong for a year to see if he can make a living as a painter. On the Star Ferry en route to Hong Kong Island, he meets Mee Ling, a seemingly proper young woman of lofty social status.  Soon after, Robert seeks inexpensive rooming and crosses paths with Mee Ling, this time at the infamous Wan Chai district.  The rent is the right price, and only after astounding the proprietor by pre-paying the room for an entire month, does he discover what this place is, and the true identity of Mee Ling.  Mee Ling becomes his model for his art work, and he learns that her profession was forced upon her for survival, not choice, lending an understanding to all of the film's viewer's (hopefully) why Mee Ling pretends to be someone else, as her means of coping with life.

Robert and Mee Ling fall in love, but not without its travails and misunderstandings, including her many disappearances, which is to care for her secret child.  Like so many love stories, there is a rough part, and they break up, but when Robert realizes his mistake, he searches and finds his ""Susie Wong.""  The sequel to these films, ""The Flower Drum Song"" is well worth watching as well!

There are many interpretations of the dynamics of this movie:  How Caucasians looked ""down"" upon Asian women, viewing them as prostitutes....Of sleazy men wanting to get something on the side, using such women, women who often were thrown into a life of prostitution merely to survive.  These are all true....but in all of this, there is also Robert Lomax and Mee Ling that are above these disgusting people.  Here are two people that see each other as man and woman, caring so much for each other at the stories end.  How many of us wish for such a great love?",1337558400,,2123,4.523560209424084

So this DVD version provides me with a chance to be nostalgic. Glad to be able to re-savour the Hong Kong days in colour. It is just like today or yesterday. The Star Ferry boats are the same, after over 50 years. There are many Cantonese movies showing Hong Kong of the same period, but they are practically all b&w renditions. Nancy Kwan and William Holden are excellent in the movie. A happly ending too: that is what I usually favour in literary and artistic productions.",1316995200,2,610,4.359649122807017
318745,5,6301216121,"The  DVD came in undamaged thanks to Amazon.com.  I enjoyed the movie.  William Holden and Nancy Kwan were appropriately picked as the main characters.  Nancy Kwan was able to play three women in one person:  first, the proud aristocrat Chinese woman, second,the earthy prostitute and third,the caring mother of her son.  Nancy Kwan as Suzie Wong was charming and funny at times many times throughout the picture-she should have won an Oscar for her role.  For those who are offended by the mores and worldview associated with the book and movie, I will say 'each to their own', and please keep in mind that your beliefs that you think are so right and proper now will probably disdained by people of the future, so enjoy the film as it is.

Films like 'The World of Suzie Wong' and 'A Summer Place' are reflective of an era in Hollywood where Hollywood had to creatively produce fims that stimulated the romantic imagination while under considerable cultural restraint.  This is an era that frankly has been lost since the 1960s.  This movie is definitely a guilty pleasure.",1302220800,,1075,4.793478260869565

I know the era was a different time and place than now, but this movie has all of the elements to keep both men(Straight males too!) and women captivated and interested in the storyline, in spite of being a ""Romantic drama"" which are usually relegated to the label of being called a ""Chick Flick"". As a ex-US Navy Sailor who spent some time in Hong Kong almost 30 years ago, Alot of the Elements of ""Susie Wong"" were still evident by me, Especially in Kowloon. So for me personally, In-spite of the fact Hong Kong has changed and has been ""Cleaned up"", This movie is a revisit to those days for me in the US Navy as Well. Nancy Kwan and William Holden both do a fantastically believable job of Acting that today's actors sadly, don't seem to do very well.

But it is much more than that.  For its time, it was very daring--showing an interracial romance between a  western man pushing 40 and the proverbial hooker with a heart of gold.  And it does so by exposing the innermost souls of those two people and exposing the condescending, racial commentary of other westerners living in Hong Kong toward the Chinese.  Both William Holden and  Nancy Kwan are superb in their roles and Nancy Kwan shows just enough playful banter along with her romantic  and serious sides to keep us intrigued in her character.  It is a  good movie just to watch, or if you are interested in seeing how Hollywood movies used to be crafted back in time.  This movie is not to be missed.

Prostitutes wanting to brag that they have a steady customer who beats them because they are jealous of being around other men.  That's pretty warped.

And plus, why have William Holden in this film?  He says (in the film) that he's pushing 40, but even though he was in his early 40's, he looks like he was more like 60 years old.  Why did men grease up their hair like that?  It made him look even older than he was which was why it was a little uncomfortable to see him with the young and beautiful Nancy Kwan.

318816,5,6301216121,"""It'd be laughable if it weren't so filthy!"" rants one character in THE WORLD OF SUZIE WONG, but au contraire, this costly 1960 film is laughable BECAUSE it's so filthy. Refreshingly unlike many other Hollywood hooker sagas -- the kind where Elizabeth Taylor's paid cash to model gowns, or Audrey Hepburn gets $50 for the powder room -- Nancy Kwan seems to know she's playing a whore in Wong.

When penniless artist William Holden, who lives atop a sleazy Hong Kong brothel, spies Kwan in the building's pick-up bar, we're told she is the ""most popular girl -- got sex appeal!"" And how: her hot-cha dance routine still registers, decades after the fact, on the Bad Movie Bump 'n' Grind Allure-O-Meter. Holden asks Kwan to his room, but when he says, ""Can't pay much, but I'd like you to pose for me,"" she replies, ""Just sit? No, I lose face. My girlfriends will say, 'You go to gentleman's room and sit? You're slipping!'"" Since there's no story unless she changes her mind, Kwan instantly reconsiders, asking hopefully, ""Take clothes off?"" Curbing his artistic impulses for a moment, Holden takes Kwan off to dinner, during which the spunky prostitute admits hooking is ""dirty,"" but insists, ""I not dirty street girl. Inside, I still good."" To demonstrate this, she offers herself up as dessert--for free. When Holden rejects her, she starts picking up men out in the street. As she chirps, ""Hi, sailor!"" over and over with irresistable neediness in her voice, we can only wonder: How long will it take before Holden falls?

Quite a while, thanks to Kwan's trampy behavior. When Holden decks a gob who's called Kwan (accurately) ""a filthy little slut,"" she asks him, ""Do me a favor--let me tell my girlfriends you beat me up."" (He refuses, but Kwan does so anyway, eliciting this from another whore: ""You're very lucky!"") However, when Kwan starts a catfight because she thinks that Holden is flirting with another vixen, she's gone too far. ""I came her to paint,"" Holden snarls at her. ""I can't have you giving me your love on the days that you're free."" Conveniently, fellow tramp-hound Michael Wilding barges in with news he's split with his wife and wants to make Kwan his ""permanent girlfriend."" Kwan gives him the old ""I not dirty street girl"" line, adding, ""If I your regular girlfriend, I never go with another man."" And off she goes with him.

Respectable English art expert Sylvia Syms (this crazy film's craziest character, inasmuch as she views Holden as marriage material) starts posing for paintings in Kwan's stead -- at least til Kwan returns to show off her kept-woman wardrobe. ""Take that terrible dress off,"" Holden hollers. ""You look like a cheap European streetwalker."" (Helpfully, he rips the clothes off her -- in the name of the fashion police, mind you, not because he wants her looking like a cheap Eurasian streetwalker.

After Wilding's estranged wife samples what he's been learning in Kwan's bed, she wants him back pronto. Holden agrees to break this bad news, and when he does, hang on for Kwan's full meltdown -- a bizarre identity-crisis split that leads, as such things often do, to a happy ending. Suddenly taking on the personality of a demure virgin, Kwan once again cries, ""I not dirty street girl!"" and then says, ""I want to be like nice English girl for you. I go now."" She exits Holden's room, then bounds right back in, announcing, ""It's now tomorrow. You my first man. You believe?"" Strange? Yep, but not as strange as Holden's reply: ""I believe. And you're my first girl.""

OK, so they face a cruel, uncomprehending world. Sym's Brit dad asks Holden in alarm, ""You'd be happy to spend the end of your days with a little, old, Chinese wife?"" But aren't these the kind of problems that bind a couple together? Somewhere, they're living happily ever after together, right now.

As one does, I visited Victoria Peak, the bright lights of Nathan Road, and the beautiful and sparsely inhabited New Territories. And of course, I visited Wan Chai, albeit mainly to see if the World of Suzie Wong still existed. Whether it does or not is difficult to say.

Before I left - in my second Amazon misclick - I ordered the DVD of this story and not the novel. I had heard that the film was terrible, but I actually enjoyed it. In Hong Kong, I picked up the novel and, admittedly, enjoyed that, too. Although not exactly Emily Bronte, The World of Suzie Wong is entertaining in a pulp-fiction-slash-soap-opera sort of way. Chance encounters, preposterous coincidences, embroidered dialogue, and bad similes are all part and parcel of the Suzie saga, but it makes for light entertainment and a bit of escapism. Also, there are some very good desriptions of what Hong Kong was like in those days (the 1950s) - swarming with sailors, hookers, refugees from the mainland, and indifferent and corrupt officials. In the film-version, you get to see what Hong Kong looked like in the 1960s, as it was filmed on site. In fact, this movie is the first real look that Westerners got of the now-booming metropolis. Don't expect fireworks with either the novel or the DVD, but do expect to be whisked away to a bygone era for a pleasant little while.

318958,5,6301216121,"William Holden plays Robert Lomax, an American architect who takes a year off from work to pursue his dream of making it as an artist.  He moves to Hong Kong and sets up house in a cheap hotel plagued with prostitutes.  He uses one, Suzie Wong (played by Eurasian actress Nancy Kwong), as a model for his paintings and she soon falls in love with him.  To complicate matters, the daughter of a prominent HK-based British banker also falls for Lomax, and he ultimately must decide between Wong, to whom he seems more attracted but whose occupational background he finds troubling, and the more socially prominent Englishwoman.

Given that I knew what the basic story was about, I had low expectations for this film.  I just found it hard to imagine a character played by William Holden getting serious with a hooker; however, the film evolves in a way that makes it all believable. The viewer will sympathize with Suzie Wong's plight and will feel for both Lomax and Wong as they try to overcome the obstacles in their relationship.

Nancy Kwan (whose father was Chinese and whose mother was a British fashion model) was a sex symbol in the 1960s and, when you see her in this film, it is easy to understand why.",1153008000,7,1211,4.609302325581395

Filmed in that boundary between the eras of censorship and openness, this film seems at times to walk on eggshells. While the prostitutes aren't glamourized as they are in, say, PRETTY WOMAN, they are childish and harmless (in fact, many of the Chinese come across as child-like). Plus, there are some melodramatic moments which seem to be a bid for sympathy (eg, Gwennie's letter and the mysterious reason behind Suzie's disappearances). This is only enhanced by the man's implausible virtuousness ('if he can feel that way about them, so should we').

Still, the film manages some degree of honesty. And the location shooting is alive with color and alienness, including some authentic Hong Kong and British accents (altho, the too-careful substitution of ""Law-bet"" for ""Robert"" by the Chinese actors comes across as fake).

Making the most of the story are the actors. Holden is well cast, as are the British and Chinese supporting players. But, I wonder how watchable this movie would have been without Nancy Kwan in the title role. While she clearly has limits in her acting range (she was a trained dancer, not actor), she was a force of nature as well as a sublime beauty. So much so that the very capable Sylvia Syms was doomed to supporting role from the start.

(Paris When it Sizzles, with that cast..Audrey's first major flop, and it was witheld from release for years).

The one thing that causes this film to stand out today is the stark differences of the Hong Kong of 1960 and today. I do think William Holden may have been miscast in his role.

 After just a brief but emotional encounter on a Hong Kong ferry boat, Suzie Wong, played endearingly by Nancy Kwan, has left American traveler Robert Lomax(Holden) quite taken with her beauty and unique charms. He believes her to be the proper but spirited daughter of a rich man, and before he can get to know her she disappears off into the crowded streets. Robert, taking a year off from his career in architecture, wants to persue his love of painting. On a limited budget he takes a room in a not so upscale part of town, and finds himself a resident of a hotel that caters to the servicemen and prostitutes that frequent the bar next door.

 To his surprise (and perhaps delight), he discovers one of the working girls is none other then Suzie Wong. He hires her as his model, and she proceeds to turn his world upside down. What follows is a dramatic, but sweet and poignant story of culture clash and wonderful romance, as Robert tries to reconcile his growing fondness for Suzie, with the morals and bigotry of the world he comes from.

 Like Lomax, you will fall in love with the irresistible Suzie, and breathtaking Hong Kong. Suzie's pals Gwennie Lee(Jacqui Chan), Minnie Ho(Yvonne Shima), and Wednesday Lu(Lier Hwang), will also delight you and steal your heart with their own unique charms.

 For a little over 2 hours you will be taken into ""The World of Suzie Wong"", and you may not want to come back! It will provide you with enjoyment even after repeated viewings.

I am currently serving in Afghanistan and found this on DVD in the PX and purchased it.  After viewing it, I still think she was one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen.  I also came to appreciate the story line.  Though this movie would most likely be considered a ""chick flick"" by the younger soldiers I serve with, I consider it a great movie myself.  I appreciate the movie not having gratuitous sex.  That element itself is something I miss in the movies.  A good movie doesn't have to show them having sex, it just fades the scene out slowly.  Nancy Kwan demonstrated remarkable acting skills for someone in the first role.  This movie was considered racist by many Asians because it displayed that poor Chinese girls were prostitutes and attracted to American and European men for a way out.  What is racist about that?  I actually think it demonstrates a keen business sense of sorts as American and European men in Hong Kong were wealthy in comparison to Chinese men.  The movie demonstrated logic in this regards.",1104451200,13,1236,4.488789237668161

A candidate for close second would be ""The Quiet American"", which conveys a similarly tremendous cinematic atmosphere, but focuses a bit too much on politics for my liking.

Kwan and Holden work perfectly together and the other actors like Mr. Wilding also do a splendid job. The film was really shot in Hong Kong (unusual for the time) and makes for some very interesting historical footage, in fact if you're a white man travelling to places like Guangzhou or Shenzhen today, you will more often than not feel just like in a film set for this movie.

To summarize the plot: Hobby painter Robert (Lobat) Lomax travels to Hong Kong for a year to try himself as a professional artist. To this end he hires a girl from the sleazy nightclub nextdoor to his hotel, to pose as a model for his paintings. Professional and distant at first, their relationship quickly turns to understanding, affection and love. After lots of ups and downs, with many a tear-jerker placed in between, all taking place in a 1960s Hong Kong surrounding, Robert at the end proposes to her and they walk off into the sunset together.

319051,5,6301216121,"""The World of Suzie Wong"" would probably be made today with graphic sex, violence and more than a glimpse into the seedy side of prostitution. As it is we get this tale of an American artist (William Holden) who meets a Chinese prostitute (Kwan in her debut) on a Ferry with just the right of modesty and the focus on the characters. She proceeds to steal his heart and not his wallet. She tries to have him arrested when he returns her purse accusing him of stealing it. Set in Hong Kong during the 60's, we see a world long since past in a time when innocence still dominated most of the films made by Hollywood. This is by no means a toothless tale but one that lacks a sense of the reality that we would get today. In a sense, that's good because it allows the film to communicate the emotional distance and anguish of the characters. On the other hand, it also makes it might make it difficult for contemporary audiences to connect with the film. Regardless, it's a very good movie with strong performances from William Holden and Nancy Kwan (in her film debut).

 The transfer looks a bit grainy and gritty not at all as sharp as some of the older films that Paramount has released to DVD recently. The colors have faded a bit as well although it's unlikely that this film will get the attention or restoration it needs to recapture its former luster. There's the typical analog scars we might expect from a film that's been displayed, beaten up and bruised for such a long, long time but, on the whole, they are minimal. The mono sound is pretty good although flat at times without the any depth.

 This budget priced DVD has no extras although the film is presented in its original aspect ratio (i.e., widescreen) for the first time in a long, long time. It's a pity as Nancy Kwan is alive and well and probably could have provided an interesting commentary track. Additionally, a documentary looking at the making of a movie with a controversial theme might have benefited the DVD as well.

 Over all, ""World"" looks pretty decent although not quite as sharp, colorful or vivid as it could be. The presentation is fairly pedestrian and uninspired which is sad considering that this is a film classic.",1090713600,6,2208,4.535175879396985
319182,5,6301216121,"'The World Of Suzie Wong' the romanticized story of a Hong Kong prostitute and an American artist is for some, a simplistic racist view of Chinese, for others, a guilty pleasure. Yes, it is both of those things but it is even more. It is a fine and tender love story of two people from very different worlds who overcome pride and prejudice and embark upon a true human experience. Forty four years after its release this film along with 'Flower Drum Song' are being re-evaluated and embraced by the Chinese American community.  Why? Because beneath the surface of each film they share the common job of telling the story of their time and place with honesty and true humanity and in the case of Suzie Wong, the story is not such a happy one.
  At first we are presented in `Suzie Wong' a stereotypical view of happy little hookers in the Wan Chai district of Hong Kong. But as the story unfolds the veneer of this portrait cracks open to reveal through Suzie just how desperate the lives of these women are.  In a city of over three million crammed onto the island city it is a case of do what you must to survive. In Suzie's case she must compartmentalize her feeling into body, love, and soul and thus protect herself by pretending that she is the daughter of a rich merchant rather than a Wan Chai bargirl.  Though her relationship with Robert they both learn the meaning and cost of love in a world of narrow view and prejudice.
  The film is very adult and honest in dealing with the subject of the flesh trade and racism in 1960 must have been a bit shocking on several levels. This film must be credited with opening the door to telling more honest stories of Asian's with Asian actors in the major roles. After all, not too many years before we had Jennifer Jones playing a Eurasian in 'Love Is A Many Splendored Thing'. She did a fine job, but still she was miscast.  Here we have Nancy Kwan creating a memorable character, as it should be, by someone of Asian descent.
  Nancy Kwan is luminous in the role of Suzie. This was a star making turn for her and led to other good roles over the years. She is sexy, with a street-smart veneer that covers her open and trusting heart.  She rises to the many emotional challenges of Suzie and succeeds in carrying the viewer through the film as only an accomplished actress can. The camera falls in love with her, as does the reluctant Robert.
  William Holden is perfectly cast as the ""pushing forty"" American who has come to Hong Kong to pursue his dream of being an artist. He is a pro who give the role just the feeling of wonder and discovery it needs blended with a certain worldliness that it requires. Together, Kwan and Holden are an intoxicatingly romantic couple that share a chemistry on screen most films of this genre aspire to but few achieve.
  The supporting cast is filled out by standouts such as Jacqui Chan as Gwennie Lee, Andy Ho as Ah Tong, Michael Wilding as Ben Marlow and Sylvia Simms as Suzie's rival, Kay O'Neill.
  Geoffrey Unsworth also known for his work on 'Becket', '2001 A Space Odyssey' and 'Cabaret' stunningly photographed Hong Kong for the film. His use of light and color is unsurpassed in capturing the long gone look of the city in 1960. The art direction of John Box is superb. He is best known for his work with David Lean on 'Doctor Zhivago' and 'Lawrence of Arabia'.
  It is all expertly helmed by director Richard Quine who is also responsible for 'Bell, Book, and Candle', 'Strangers When We Meet' and the delightful 'How To Murder Your Wife'.
  Of special note are the stunningly beautiful paintings of Miss Kwan by artist Liz Moore. They are indeed wonderful and one wishes there had been an addition to the DVD of slides of this artist's painting for the film.
  'The World of Suzie Wong' is a film that holds both an important place in film history and the hearts film buffs and romantics around the globe. So on that rainy Saturday afternoon when you need a little romance, drama and travel to a far off land pop in this new DVD of 'Suzie Wong' and be carried away.",1088726400,116,4069,4.468918918918919
319183,5,6301216121,"Today there are many ""chick flicks,"" but The World of Suzie Wong is a ""romance for guys.""

There are two parallel themes in this film: 1) the ""Pygmalion"" theme, and 2) the enchantment of the East.  The Pygmalion theme (which includes Cinderella, My Fair Lady, and Pretty Woman) was old when George Bernard Shaw's play by this name first appeared in 1913. Pygmalion, in classical legend, was the king of Cyprus who fell in love with his own sculpture. Hence the theme of beginning with a raw material (in this case a woman of no great position or education) and to some degree transforming her into she whom you might adore.

Theme number two, the enchantment of the East, is magic stuff for those so smitten, which includes your humble correspondent. In this way, this wonderful story (novel and film) is understated. It is barely believable that Lomax's attraction to Suzie would start from nothing and grow so slowly to compelling strength. Lomax must be a man of Quixotic romantic notions or he would not be trying this alternative life style of professional painting. This mixture of desire and fascination is more likely to stormily seize a man's heart, but ""Robert meets Suzie-falls crazy in love-marries Suzie"" would make for a ten-minute film, and that just wouldn't do, would it?

Some object to this love theme carrying racist overtones, but in my view the reverse is true. The essence of the message is an absence of racism.  The very fact that in this type of romantic union the protagonists are of unequal social position means that the man is attracted to the woman because of her human qualities, not because of any advantage she can provide to him in terms of social status or wealth. In fact, a man who loves such a woman is often looked down upon socially, which is present in this story. The object of Robert Lomax's love is Suzie Wong for who she is as a woman and how she makes him feel, and he gladly, even cynically disregards the disparagements of those who do not approve.

It's also an interesting commentary on the film makers of this approximate vintage that when they wanted to tell the story of interracial romance they often seemed to think they had to attenuate the effect. Both Nancy Kwan and France Nguyen (in South Pacific), for example, were of mixed parentage, (but the female Asian love interests in The Sand Pebbles and Sayonara were not). And Jennifer Jones, while an Academy Award winning best actress, is from Tulsa, Oklahoma; Love Is A Many Splendored Thing really needed a genuine ""Eurasian."" As an added note, in Sayonara, Ricardo Montalban played the role of a Japanese man -- go figure.

Anyway, The World of Suzie Wong is so very romantic, and the themes explored here are enduring. I love the novel -- I love the film. I can't imagine anyone but William Holden playing Lomax (although William Shatner [believe it or not] played the stage role). This role belongs to Bill Holden.",1084752000,15,2927,4.716242661448141

Sex or starvation. Those mail order bride seekers and sex tourists to Asia should view this film before they go to the airport.

319189,5,6301216121,"This movie makes me proud to be Eurasian. Nancy Kwan is classically beautiful and 'The World of Suzy Wong' illustrates this at every opporunity. William Holden's sensitivity and mature demeanour make him a wonderful leading man. If you wish to be transported to a truly romantic era, then this is certainly the movie to see. I also recommend reading the novel on which the movie was based by Richard Mason. One cannot help but love it too.",955497600,9,439,4.714285714285714
319190,4,6301216121,"A very moving film, one can't but admire the skills of a very young Nancy Kwan in her role as Suzie Wong.  She steals every scene she is in, with her only competition being Hong Kong itself - seen here as it once was and will  never be again.  Bill Holden is adequate for the part (and one must credit  him for taking what must have been a rather daring role in 1960 for a  Hollywood leading man), but he just doesn't seem to have the level of  emotional believability that the story demands.  Also, when he refers to  himself in the film as ""pushing 40"" one almost has to laugh,  because it seems obvious that 40 had been left behind long ago.  For me,  having lived in Asia myself for several years, this film brought back many  almost forgotten emotions and calls to me to pitch the 9-5 world of work  and do something more fulfilling (as Bill Holden did).",955152000,3,859,4.260869565217392
319191,5,6301216121,"I think that some of the other reviews for this wonderful movie were the best anyone could hope to find, but I was a bit disappointed to find that nobody mentioned the fine job done by Michael Wilding! Although not one of  the main characters, he has a very important role as Ben. When Ben is meant  to bring comic relief, Wilding does it very effectively, and he is just as  good in the tense moments as well.  As for the rest of the movie, it's  great. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story, not to  mention a good love story.",944870400,,545,4.142857142857143
