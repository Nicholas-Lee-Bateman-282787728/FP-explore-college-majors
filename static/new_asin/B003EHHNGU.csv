8395505,3,B003EHHNGU,"It says on the cover of ""Squatterpunk"" that ""This is not a film by Khavn.""  At first this comes off as some sort of conceit on the part of the director, like ""A Spike Lee Joint,"" but after watching it I have to agree completely.  Whatever ""Squatterpunk"" is, it is most definitely not a film.

""Squatterpunk"" (""Iskwaterpangk,"" original title in the Philippines) is more of a video art project, a sort of feature-length music video juxtaposing black-and-white images of children at play in the slums of Manila over improvised punk music by Khavn's band The Brockas. Like the title says, the sensibilities of ""Squatterpunk"" are raw, punk art.  The band does not play smoothly, but tunes in between songs, and has moments of silence when the ambient street sounds of Manila are allowed to bleed through.

Filmed in a single day, ""Squatterpunk"" has no narrative to speak of, although there is a main character of sorts in Hapon, the mohawked kid on the cover who is sort of a mini gang-leader / instigator of his little tribe of kids.  The term ""gang-leader"" should not be taken in the wrong way though.  Hapon and his tribe are just typical kids, running around the streets playing, exploring abandoned structures and challenging each other leap into the nearby ocean from higher and higher vantages, collecting cans to trade for cash so they can buy ice cream.  They actually reminded me of myself and my friends growing up in the country, playing naked in the mud so we didn't ruin our clothes, being hosed off by our parents and then sent inside for treats.

The footage here is mainly hand-held digital video, and Khavn definitely has an eye for interesting images.  Everything starts out very basic, but as the film goes on he introduces some effects, playing with film speed and image overlapping.  Although everything is in black-and-white, he brings in some red effects towards the end.

Khavn says in his interview on the DVD that ""Squatterpunk"" is an edited together film from three separate video projects he did in the Manila, and that is ultimately where things went wrong for me.  It is just too long.  I can appreciate video art, and I love some good punk music, but I found it hard to sit through over an hour of pure image and music.  I was craving some structure, some narrative.  Interviews with some of the kids, maybe voice-overs talking about their lives, hopes, dreams, etc...would have gone a long way.

I can imagine this being amazing if Khavn's band was playing live with ""Squatterpunk"" running on a video screen in the background providing moving wallpaper.  But sitting in my living room watching the DVD on my TV I just couldn't sustain the interest.  Because The Brockas's lyrics are in un-subtitled Tagalog, I couldn't understand the words and I didn't know if the music was providing depth to the scenes or not.  Like to many of the images, the music just became noise in the background.

The DVD for ""Squatterpunk"" has a few alternate soundtracks to choose from, all variations of The Brockas.  There is a live version recorded from a club as well as a few others.",1277337600,6,3094,4.74392523364486
