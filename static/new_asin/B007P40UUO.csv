8520103,5,B007P40UUO,"Billy Fury, one of the first of the British rockers influenced by Elvis. John Lennon once hung around a studio to get his autograph. The plot is no ""King Creole'"" but its fun with a lot of good early rock n roll.",1418688000,,212,4.071428571428571
8520104,1,B007P40UUO,"The quality was terrible, My old VHS COPY was far better, I was going to buy the other Rock & Roll DVD's with Helen Shapiro, Bobby Vee Etc  , but after this I won't bother. Great Film but I wish they had remastered them .",1361577600,,221,3.911111111111111
8520105,5,B007P40UUO,"This movie has more of a plot than some of the other British pop musicals of the early 1960's and I really enjoyed it.  As others have mentioned, this movie gives a good insight into the early 1960's pre-Beatles UK pop (e.g. the London club scene at the time) as well as British cinema of that time.  First time I really got to see and hear Billy Fury perform, although I've heard about him before.  He was the first UK pop star from Liverpool, predating the Beatles by a few years.

Also fun to see other actors I've seen in other movies or TV shows like Jeremy Bulloch (e.g. Summer Holiday, also was Boba Fett in the original Star Wars movies), Monte Landis (e.g. Monkees TV show - he played the devil in one episode).  I just found out that the guy in the band with glasses was played by Ray Brooks (e.g. The Knack and How To Get It).  I also see that David Hemmings has an uncredited appearance.  I'll have to watch the DVD again.",1359417600,6,934,4.242937853107344
8520106,3,B007P40UUO,"Prior to the Beatles and the Stones et al conquering these shores Billy Fury and Cliff Richard ruled the roost in the Motherland.  This film is a document as to why Billy never transplanted his home appeal here.  He has marginal singing ability and the songs he warbles are the most disposable of pabulum.  The only thing worse is listening to the soft pop stylings of his co-stars, Bobby Vee and Helen Shapiro.  That said Billy and his mates are affable sorts and quite appealing when not singing.  The perfunctory plot involves Billy and the boys fogbound after missing a flight to Belgium for a music competition.  They hook up with an heiress who is trying to escape the clutches of her overprotective father to the arms of a playboy pop star.  Nothing earth shattering here but nothing disagreeable.  Director Michael Winner provides a little spark to the proceedings in his capturing the sights and sounds of the London club scene.  If I were to suggest this film to anyone, and it would be a marginal recommendation, it would be for those interested in the British pop scene pre-Fab Four.",1358985600,3,1095,4.721052631578948
8520107,5,B007P40UUO,I love oldie but goodies. The UK experianced their era as well. This has helped me to gain some insight into their music. Lots of fun to watch.,1354147200,3,143,4.142857142857143
8520108,5,B007P40UUO,"I really enjoyed this British 1962 pre-mersey rock and roll movie,I've seen all the Elvis rock and roll movies from the 60's and this was quite a refreshing change. I was never that familiar with the very talented Billy Fury who was very well known in the UK but little known and overlooked in the US.  He did a superb acting and singing job along with all the others. Very well worth watching!!",1347235200,3,395,4.410958904109589
