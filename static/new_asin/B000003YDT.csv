7903199,5,B000003YDT,"Beautiful music!  This is a classic black and white movie that was actually filmed in the United Kingdom (a.k.a. .British).  And it features the great pianist of the era, Paderewski, who ends up playing match maker via his rendition of the Moonlight Sonata.  The opening recital is captivating and there is even some subtle humor throughout the film.  There is one scene in which he plays his own composition, his Minuet. All in all, the movie is fairly clean and it is delightful to see Paderewski featured so prominently in it.  At times, the sound quality is poor.  And the picture a bit fuzzy.  I also thought the romance could have been nicer, but it all works out well in the end.  And it is such a treasure to both see and hear Paderewski perform some piano masterworks in this film.",1424044800,2,790,4.553191489361702
7903200,5,B000003YDT,I saw this movie on tv about 60 years ago; I remember it because a very young Charles Farrell (My Little Margie) was also in it.  I was also in the process of learning the Minuet in G.  This is like finding an old friend is still alive and not dead.  This is a true heirloom for a classical piano buff.,1382227200,2,302,3.918032786885246

7903202,5,B000003YDT,I never forgot this film after seeing it over 30 years ago.  Paderewski's magnificent playing just stayed in my head all these years.  I looked on Amazon to see if I could find it one day.  And there it was!  A great treasure for a great price!,1359590400,,244,4.127659574468085

7903204,4,B000003YDT,"Certainly is a very old film and quality is a bit sketchy, but priceless to see Paderewski himself at the keyboard as well as in a minor acting role. An enjoyable  watch for classical music lovers.",1291680000,2,197,4.472222222222222
7903205,5,B000003YDT,"I enjoyed this movie. I have not seen it since I was a little girl. My mother adored Classical music. She introduced me to this film on TV. Being able to see it again as an adult was pleasurable. I am so glad I added it to my collection. To see Paderewski, this brillant Musician, at the piano and here the music was wonderful. The movie is very old fashioned and because of this it has it's own charm. I only had one issue, at the begining, Paderewski is giving a concert and when they show his hands on the keyboard playing, the music it is out of sinc. Which was sad. I do not remember if the film was always this way.  I had no issues with the film's quality. Sound and picture quality were fine, considering how old this movie is.",1286150400,4,735,4.13986013986014
7903206,5,B000003YDT,"If you're looking for Paderewski in film, look no further! Sidebar: It was said that Paderewski became so used to hearing in his piano recital appearances in America the often ""mispronounced"" Pad-e-ROO'-ski for the correct Pad-e-REF'-ski that he just smiled while never correcting the mispronunciation and reportedly once commented ""Well, it could have been much worse were my surname the very often mangled surname of ""Chopin"" .""

Believe it or not, and the Pad-e-""ROO""-ski mispronunciation aside, I've heard everything for ""Chopin"" from [phonetically] ""Choppin"" as in the 'chopping' wood variety to ""Cho-PANE or PIN"" But then I get, ""Why do you Americans spell 'Rachmaninov' [sic -- UK, et al] as 'Rachmaninoff' ? Easy! That's the precise way the man himself wrote [cursive or printed form] and in fact signed his name when he lived in the USA, viz., ""Rachmaninoff"" and so ""his"" wishes for the transliterated Russian into English surname spelling of his own surname were and are followed.

Anyway, while the plot of the movie is rather off-beat and can bring on shades of Victor Borge and Fozzie-Bear doing the ""Moonlight Sonata"" routine with the ""Bust of Beethoven"" thing Zzzzzzz-wise and the viewer could easily anticipate the plot if not the entire script itself as it goes along, it doesn't detract from the playing including the beginning of the movie where an uninterrupted 21 minute recital by Paderewski shows him at his best.

Humor too as when Paderewski visits the orphanage for girls as a guest of the Baroness [Marie Tempest] and of course he is not known there so that the musical program arranged for the visit of the Baroness shows the orphanage director's wife, Margaret, having a bad case of the jitters at the piano and literally running away in tears before playing a note. The orphanage director then makes the anticipated plea complete with the hanky to the head thing, ""Margaret! Margaret, dear! Ohhh, I'm soooo sorry ... perhaps somebody here can play the piano?"" whereupon Paderewski speaks up and says, ""If it is not too difficult, perhaps I might .."" whereupon he steps to the piano and sees the score [with the appropriate camera zoom], ""Minuet in G"", which of course is his own piece [and not to be confused with other pieces by that same title] and duly bears his name on the score as the composer and he says with a twinkle in his eye, ""I think I can just about manage that.""

Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata"" acts as a sort of regeneration tonic to the movie heroine as she tries to figure out her true love sort of thing but, as I say, Paderewski is well represented as well as his well known personal charm. Naturally, the audio and film visuals are 1937 vintage so allowances must be made for the quality of same. Paderewski was well in his 70's when he appeared in this UK made production but at least there is a filmed record of his playing and well captivating personality. BTW, that clip of Paderewski playing Liszt [2nd Hungarian Rhapsody] that appears in the 1999 produced DVD, ""The Art of Piano"", is taken directly from the 1937 ""Moonlight Sonata"" movie.

7903207,2,B000003YDT,"This is undoubtedly one of the silliest (unintentionally) movies
I have ever seen.  Basically an excuse to see Paderewski in
action, but unfortunately accompanied by random acts of plot.
For some reason, never made clear, most of the action is set in
Sweden, which looks like a stage and a canvas backdrop.  A very
young Eric Portman plays a Portuguese!?  All players have
terribly English accents, and make no attempt to disguise them.
All of this looks even weirder than it sounds, and the music isn't even that great.  Good for a laugh, though.",1027209600,2,547,4.787234042553192
