8072229,5,B000A1L0DU,Saw this one when originally screened on television but couldn't remember what it was called. All I knew was that Charton Heston was featured. Now I have received a copy from Video Rarities. Not cheap but worth it. This riveting miniseries about a serial killer that manages to avoid capture over the period of decades while living in the fictional southern town of Delanor. Charlton Heston narrates the story at intervals as well as acting his role as a founding father of the town as he watches it grow unaware of the dark history of hidden graves and the young hitch hiking runaways that lay in them. The community has its other issues to add to the tension with racism. The title Chiefs relates to the different police chiefs appointed over the period with the last one a black man to add to the plot. A great ending to. I would rate this miniseries within the top half dozen ever produced.,1165276800,,894,4.559006211180124
8072230,5,B000A1L0DU,"I saw this series when it originally aired in 1983.  I do not understand why it is so overlooked.  It's absolutely FANTASTIC!  I have been dying for the DVD to come out.  Please, please get it in the US.  The story is incredible and the way it is woven into future generations goes beyond what is available on TV today. Anyone who gets the opportunity to view or purchase this DVD should jump at the chance.  You won't be disappointed.",1134259200,6,435,4.375

Studio People: Please, please, please release it on DVD for U.S. consumption. I'll save my detailed review for that time. Why, oh why must we wait?

Thank you!",1126396800,4,215,4.487179487179487
