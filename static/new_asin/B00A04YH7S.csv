5374459,4,B00A04YH7S,"I rented this movie for the actors--Bradley James, Rupert Graves, Noel Clarke--but I liked it for the actresses. This story of a young woman determined to use her gift for running track to get out of a dead-end neighborhood and do better than her family expects is squarely centered on the female characters and their ambitions, weaknesses, and strengths. It celebrates their athleticism without ever leering at their bodies, and the romance between the protagonist and her physiotherapist, played by handsome Bradley James, while charming, is not the point of the plot. The outcome is more gritty, less feel-good than I expected, but I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. More girl power movies like this one, please!",1366329600,3,728,4.975409836065574
5374460,5,B00A04YH7S,"Fast Girls is one of those rare movies that makes you go through a journey with the characters.  You feel their loses and you feel their victories.  The girls in this film will make you laugh, cry , and cheer.  The acting was superb and the story line was well written.  It's one of those movies you'll want to watch over and over again.",1365724800,,337,4.21875
5374461,5,B00A04YH7S,"This is a standard sports film done much in the way of Bend it Like Beckham. It features some really famous faces from some of the most popular shows in British television including Doctor Who, Merlin, Sherlock and Being Human. Lenora Crichlow and Lily James both shine as the leads but it's an ensemble cast so everyone gets their chance to show what they're made of. You'll be rooting for these Fast Girls all the way until the credits roll. It's a fun family film that is surprisingly inspiring and doesn't get lost in the drama of romance but is more about having a dream and having the guts to do whatever it takes to make it happen. It's nice to see another sports film that features female leads, especially when one of them is a WOC. And the fact that this film was released right before the summer Olympics in London last year makes it extra special. It might also give you that extra push you need to get up and become active like you planned to do in 2013 when you were picking New Year's resolutions.",1360108800,,1012,4.388297872340425
5374462,4,B00A04YH7S,"In the lead-up to the 2012 London Olympics, writer Noel Clarke, producer Damian Jones and director Regan Hall decided to capitalize on pre-event excitement by putting into gear their long-planned project of an all-girl relay team.  In the grand tradition of sporting movies, ""Fast Girls"" is a film that contains all the clichs of the genre, but still has enough energy and charm to be worth a look - especially for girls.

Bearing more than a few resemblances to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bend-It-Like-Beckham/dp/B001K90PCI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bend It Like Beckham</a>, the story centers around two female sprinters: lower-class Shania Andrews (Leonora Crichlow, best known as Annie from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Being-Human/dp/B003IMERF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Being Human</a>) and high-achieving Lisa Temple (Lily James, currently playing Rose on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downton-Abbey/dp/B0099Y2MYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downton Abbey</a>). Neither one gets much support from their families - Shania's aunt and sister could care less about her ambition, and Lisa's domineering father puts her under too much pressure. Unsurprisingly, the two become immediate rivals the moment they set eyes on each other, and the stage is thus set for the two of them to overcome their differences and complete alongside their fellow teammates Trix (Lorraine Burroughs) and Belle (Lashana Lynch) to bring home the gold.

Shania makes for a flawed, sympathetic and realistic lead (though you could make a drinking game out of the times she says ""innit"") whose problems derive not only from her background but also her own personal shortcomings. In her own words, she's not really a team player, and this comes to the fore when she and Lisa continue to botch up the all-important baton exchange in the 4x200 meter relay.

The key actresses went through a rigorous training and dieting regime in order to earn their washboard abs and athletic physiques, and are backed up by a solid (and familiar) supporting cast, including Phil Davies (Miles from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whitechapel/dp/B00266E6G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whitechapel</a>) as Shania's down-to-earth coach, Rupert Graves (Lestrade from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock/dp/B004132HZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock</a>) as Lisa's former-medal winning father, Bradley James (Prince Arthur from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin/dp/B001LF347E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin</a>) as the team's physiotherapist, and Noel Clarke (Mickey from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B0089AD8IO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>) as the team's long-suffering coach.

There are a ton of subplots at work - perhaps a few too many, and some of which end up getting abandoned along the way, but the film's strength is not simply in its all-female cast (with the men in supporting roles that never subsume the girls' ambitions and interests), but its ethnic diversity. Of the four leads, only one is white, and the promotional material surrounding the film claimed that this was the first British film to have a non-white actress in the lead role. Though I'm not sure how to verify this, Noel Clarke was pretty adamant about it in his interviews, and with recent surveys revealing that London is now one of the most racially diverse cities in the world, it's rewarding to see a film that reflects this.

At 90 minutes the film flies by, and though it has all the usual sporting clichs - including the essential training montage - it's heart is in the right place, it's family-friendly (no swearing, drugs, sex, violence or so forth) and it's a fantastic film to share with young girls, especially those harboring their own sporting ambitions. You'll especially love its best scene, in which the girls run into a bit of trouble at a night-club where they are harassed by some young thugs, only to slip off their high heels and sprint away into the night.

(Oh, but if you're wondering why the girls are competing in something called the World Athletics Championships instead of the more obvious choice of the Olympic Games, it's because the International Olympic Committee refused for there to be any affiliation with the film, resulting in the complete omission of any mention of the word. Why they passed up on a prime bit of publicity for the games is a mystery for the ages).",1358380800,5,4698,6.218461538461538

5374466,4,B00A04YH7S,"This is based in the track and field world. It's well cast and seeing Lily James in one of her pre-Cinderella roles is a treat.

I won't rehash the plot, since other reviewers have already done that. There's nothing groundbreaking here - you can pretty much guess what the outcome will be, but it's well cast and well acted - a true feelgood film. Very enjoyable.",1372118400,,389,4.416666666666667

I'm a marathoner, so I totally get the solo sport concept that is shown here as well as the team sport concept also shown here.  The battle to create a team for the Relay track event is very real and very captivating.
