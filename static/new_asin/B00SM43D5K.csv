8698884,4,B00SM43D5K,"This DVD from EuroArts based on Stravinskys folk tale of love and enchantment, features a combination of wonderful classical dancing coupled with more modern visual effects.  This production by dancers of the National Ballet of Canada and starring Greta Hodgkinson in the title role (she is stunning) and Aleksandar Antonijevec as Prince Ivan (and fantastic work does he do here!) is a treat to watch even though it is more than just the stereotypical ballet production.  Then again, the Kirov Orchestra is conducted by Valery Gergiev, and for this listener Mr. Gergiev always brings something extra to anything he is involved with.  Yes, Im in the I like Gergiev camp, so if you aren't then it may be that this production is not for you.

The visual effects, while initially unexpected, ended up being a positive part of the whole for me, and the dancing was wonderful to behold.  I found the somewhat minimalist sets to be particularly fitting, and the piece as a whole to be satisfying on both a physical and emotional level.  While seeing the production without the visual effects would have certainly been satisfactory (particularly owing to Mr. Gergievs contributions from the orchestra pit as well as the artistry of the dancers), I found the visual effects to be both pleasing and a worthwhile addition to the story being told.

The DVD itself is well produced, and the sound and visual quality are excellent..  This is a wonderful production of The Firebird, and if the piece is one that you favor, or Stravinskys music is of interest, then you owe it to yourself to see this particular performance.

You can see where I'm going with this. At 52 minutes this is short measure for a DVD, and especially for a $40 BluRay. I'd be the last to complain about the music itself, which is expertly conducted by Valery Gergiev, and sensitively played by the musicians of the Kirov Orchestra. It's only in stereo sound, though, and recorded by Philips in 2003. I'm no ballet expert, but I was impressed by some of the dancing, especially by Greta Hodginson, who plays the title role. Though many of the dancers are from the National Ballet of Canada, this an independent production, recorded for the CBC. But, as detailed by I. Giles and John Springer in the excellent review here on Amazon, this project was let down by a whole variety of problems that can be put in the category of `production values'. Besides the muffled, low-volume stereo rather than surround sound. there's the less than pristine picture quality, some occasionally iffy choreography, a set design which seems to feature trees made of empty toilet paper rolls, and truly horrible `special effects' which belong in a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 movie. These things grossly distort what I suspect might have been a very good experience in the theatre, with these dancers and this music. Definitely go for the other Gergiev set (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firebird-Rite-of-Spring-Blu-ray/dp/B00C6CASFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Firebird / Rite of Spring [Blu-ray</a>), which has better everything, and more of it.",1430870400,3,1690,5.286245353159852
8698886,1,B00SM43D5K,"This is a made-for-TV film utilising HD cameras but a stereo only Philips Classics recording of the music by Gergiev and the Kirov orchestra. The film is copyrighted 2003 by Rhombus media with the Euroarts copyright being 2015. (This review was written after considering the Blu-ray option and using the earlier UK release of the multi-region disc).

The soundtrack, when played at an enhanced playback level, delivers very good stereo and seems superior to the CD source so far as I remember it when it used to be part of my CD collection. That studio recording has now been replaced with the superior live recording that Gergiev later made with the VPO at Salzburg and in surround sound so direct comparisons are no longer possible unfortunately. The imaging is caught by the cameras with clear definition but is severely challenged by the limitations of the set and of the choreography.

The choreography is by James Kudelka and this is a highlighted feature on the front and back disc covers and actual disc so the total lack of any further information about the choreography within the booklet or on a disc menu is very frustrating. This is especially the case as there are some extra highlighted character parts which have nothing to do with the known story, the recognised synopsis or the previous well-known and established choreography by Michael Fokine.

Apart from those considerations, this production can only be described as an unusually minimalist production where the sole set appears to be a sparse forest setting of white papier-mch type tree skeletons surrounding the stage area and through which the Prince Ivan, the Firebird and Princess Vasila run and peer at each other. The Firebird herself flies through the air attired in a simple red dress with apparent flames following along behind accompanied by a swishing sound superimposed over the music whenever she appears or departs and this technical wizardry is described as having magical visual effects. The remaining characters are equally minimalistic in terms of dress with the villainous Kastchei, ferocious with black lipstick, having to resort to grimaces to frighten his followers and opponents. Scary he is not although described on the cover as unforgettable  unless it means unforgettably unconvincing perhaps!

In summary therefore, this simply will not do particularly when one considers the alternatives.

There is Gergiev and the same orchestra again, but this time live in full surround sound with greatly enhanced range and impact at the Mariinsky Theatre and widescreen. This is the Fokine choreography, with full and sumptuous scenery and costuming, excellent dancing with the full magical effects that one would expect of a fairy-tale. The disc comes with the rarely seen Rite of Spring ballet and comes as both Blu-ray and DVD.

There is also the Decca DVD entitled Return of the Firebird. Once more this is the Fokine choreography with full costuming and full surround sound. Although only available as a DVD and 4:3 screen there are no worries about the audio or visual quality. The couplings are the Petrushka and Scheherazade ballets, the latter set to an out of sequence version of the well-known Rimsky Korsakov music. These are made for TV films but still realistic ballets featuring the Bolshoi company and are completely convincing. The Petrushka is especially effective with wonderful traditional Russian costumes.

Beyond those two there is also a well-liked DVD only version, also of the Fokine choreography, on Opus Arte with the Royal Ballet and coupled with Les Noces. Any of these three alternatives are markedly superior to the new disc and are all true to the original concept as envisioned by Stravinsky and Fokine (1910) for Diaghiev's Ballets Russes. Fokine actually wrote the original choreography as the music was being written in time for the 1910 season and can reasonably be described as definitive as an overall concept. Other choreograpers would be wise to adhere to this basic concept at the very least while still finding alternative means of particular artistic expression.

I am sorry to report therefore, that this new (original copyright 2003) disc represents very poor value in terms of staging and costuming considerations, playing length and any supportive material. The dancing itself is adequate but faces an insurmountable problem of paucity of choreographic imagination which simply fails to deliver any of the requisites of a fairy-tale. This can only harm the reputations of Stravinsky, this particular ballet story and finally, the performers who simply cannot deliver on such meagre material.

A disappointing and uncompetitive disc and far below the satisfaction of alternatives

.

Comment from John Springer on UK site for a second opinion and further reference:

Couldn't agree with you more, Ian!
It appears the original was FILMED on ""HD Panavision Cameras"" in 2003, resulting in a lot of Motion Artifacts (Jerky Movements, not just when Panning Left or Right) due to the 2-3 Pulldown to put it on Video. I believe the Soundtrack is from a Philips CD, and is rather subdued. Worse than that, there is a Muffled Male Voice apparent from 12:01 to about 13:00, which is most annoying. (I don't think it was on the CD, but recorded with the footsteps etc of the Dancers) Even worse than that, it is NOT a Canadian National Ballet Production, but the CNB Dancers who appear in it seem to have put it together themselves. If your local Madame Soohih Dance School (where my Dear Wife learned Ballet, as a Teenager) had done it, you would applaud, but it has no place on The International Dance Scene!! I think Sophomoric and Amateurish would summarize it... However, judging by the 4 Atrocious Dance Productions shown in the Trailers on this BD, there may well be a Market for this type of Entertainment.
Best Wishes
p.s. Gergiev's Firebird/Rite of Spring BD would be my first choice, even though the Audio is a bit distorted in loud passages. The Ballerina who dances the Firebird is just brilliant! The Rite includes a fascinating Documentary about recreating the Original Production which caused Audience Riots in Paris ~100 Years ago!
