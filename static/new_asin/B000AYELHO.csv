I wouldn't bother writing this, but I really liked the film and I don't like to see things trashed so heavily by people who pretend to know but can not even make a difference between a video film and one shot on Kodak (35 mm) like MAYBE is. I also went to read the review in that magazine one of you suggested.  Before getting the film I researched the director, Bruno Pischiutta, and he is actually a very well known and internationally awarded film director/producer from 30 years.

Anyway, here is an extract from the review I read, ultimately, people should decide for themselves. ""While every conceivable `advantage' society can offer our young people is readily available to them, the sheer pace and complexity of their lives often preclude any real enjoyment of the mere process of becoming a young, responsible adult."" The candor shared among the film's characters is reflective of the way young people converse with one another, today; there are literally `no holds barred.' Pischiutta has captured that raw conversational tone in his screenplay. Our society is traveling at such a rapid pace, we have literally accelerated the maturation process for teens and young adults.

""...Maybe?"" applies the brakes a bit, and offers us a provocative, thoughtful glimpse into the truly complex issues these young adults must deal with everyday.""

One more thing, there are two particularly beautiful scenes in this film. One of them is when Ellen (the bulimic character) has dinner with her strict father and sister and she ends-up leaving the table in rush to throw-up from the pressure instilled on her by the father. The other scene is again involving Ellen and this is when you see her alone at home going through her daily routine of smoking, exercising and throwing-up one time after another. The tension and suffering of this one misunderstood person is a perfect picture of bulimia.",1138233600,,2014,4.9147058823529415
8080541,1,B000AYELHO,"... before camcorders, the cost of film stock and processing necessitated that filmmakers raise money (or at least have some of their own funds), which imposed a modicum of accountability as to what sort of ""films"" got produced.  Ostensibly, if you couldn't convince an investor or family member that your movie should be made, it generally didn't.  Unfortunately, with camcorders available now for just a few hundred bucks, all sorts of amatuers are trying to make ""films"" out of this home video medium.  Giving a rhesus monkey a scalpel does not qualify the simian to conduct brain surgery.  So why is it that every bozo with a camcorder suddenly think's they're qualified to create a filmed drama?",1137974400,,700,4.957264957264957
8080542,5,B000AYELHO,"I watched the film too and I think to it as a small jewel. It is the best representation and explanation of the disorder bulimia ever portrayed in a movie. It is not a movie for unsophisticated people; this is clearly one of the best independent films finally produced by Canadians. The television style that the director has purposely used accompanied by the acting of a group of extremely talented people - especially Christina Macris and Nelida Nin - are making for a unique combination. The author has reached the difficult goal to make art and entertainment using science and education as subjects.

The one limitation of the film is that it requires intelligent viewers who can understand the problem of today's young people as well as the art of filmmaking.

I also found a well written and compelling review of the film published in the premiere issue of Daria! magazine. This can be read on the magazine's web site at [...] - The review is titled ""Edgy and Timely, Bruno Pischiutta's ""...Maybe?"" Asks All the Hard Questions..."" (Page 36 to 39).",1136505600,2,1053,4.78021978021978
8080543,1,B000AYELHO,"This is absolutely, bar none, the worst movie I have ever seen.  The acting and directing is atrocious.  This is really a badly acted and directed film.  I wouldn't even call it directing.  A 2 year old could have done better.",1135728000,,226,4.439024390243903
