8308520,5,B001HBW2H0,"The most important jazz pianist playing today, in his Standards Trio format (less indulgent than some of his many solo recordings), but with the humming, the eccentric vocalizing, and the odd posturing & body language that are part of his intense involvement with the music. Having seen him live many times, all this doesn't bother me. But there are some--including several jazz critics--who are distracted and irritated by it. If curious about his work, a new listener might be better off just buying a CD or downloading one of his Standards Trio releases and listening to his music.
Having said this, his playing is astonishing--he is a genius, if a difficult one--and his uncanny interplay with Peacock on bass and DeJonette on drums borders on the psychic. Having played together for so many years, and all three being great jazz musicians in their prime, it's not a mystery. It's deeply satisfying to both hear and SEE the pleasure they take in their improvised conversations--an extra element that only comes through on video.
Note: to fully appreciate the music, you've got to go beyond TV speakers. This DVD deserves a good high-end sound system. The video quality is fine, but as another reviewer pointed out, the mike placement and overall recording is terrific. As you would expect with anything that ECM puts its stamp on.",1381622400,,1334,4.959821428571429
8308521,5,B001HBW2H0,"The interactions between these three individuals are magical and mesmerizing.  Clearly these are listening performers; responding to each other in every moment of each piece.  This is an escape into the present moment that is still heard in the recording.  Each concert starts hot.  There is no warm up or settling into the performance.  From the technical aspect the video quality of the second concert is far cleaner.  Artistically the vidographers create a unique and intimate experience of these concerts that one could never get live.  Though live is always the best musical experience, the videography here is an artwork in its own right.  Mic placement is superior in the second concert only in that it doesn't capture Jarrett's vocal expressions (which can be diatracting) as much.  If you are a Jarrett fan of any kind, a student learning to play in trios, a seasoned performer doing your listening homework or just looking for a great jazz experience, get this while you can!",1373846400,,985,4.993865030674846
8308522,5,B001HBW2H0,"I'm a late convert to Keith Jarrett's music.  I was turned off by the machine-like monotony of the best-selling Koln concert and was irritated by the pianist's antics--groaning and buzzing at a chord or a sequence he must have played five thousand times.  But his genius grows on you.  I started to connect when I heard Jarrett's Bach and Handel, and I was overwhelmed by The Melody at Night, With You.  This led to a series of purchases on CD and DVD that brought me to the film  under review.  It is simply magnificent.  Yes, the antics are still there; it's what Jarrett does.  But look past them for the sound, the technique, and the incredible, swinging beauty that emerges from this splendid trio.  Keith Jarrett has no equal at the jazz piano, and his overall talent must place him at or near the top of any list of great pianists anywhere, ever.

The DVD is well-filmed and the sound is excellent.  Still, here's a radical thought: Why not film a musical performance with only one or two cameras, to minimize the distractions.  There must be six or seven here.  Focus on the artist and his keyboard, ignoring the back of the drummer's head during a momentous piano solo.  Ah, just a dream.",1270684800,8,1197,4.55868544600939
