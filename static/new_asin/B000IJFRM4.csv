8145877,5,B000IJFRM4,Covers everything involving the game very thoroughly. Great for beginners to watch over. I used some of it for a golf class.,1361577600,,124,4.681818181818182
8145878,4,B000IJFRM4,"The Essentials of Golf is a great way to get started in understanding what golf is all about for beginners, and a great review for those that have been playing the game for a while. A very concise explanation on what's important about the game, not just swinging away, but learning proper etiquette on how a player must conduct himself/herself on a golf course. The basic ""Do's & Dont's"". I like the recommendations and example on how to improve the pace of play. ""Ready Golf"" makes sense and it's a great solution to slow play, but everyone in the group has to understand how it works and then participate. It makes a lot of sense.",1259020800,,632,4.504347826086956
8145879,5,B000IJFRM4,Was glad to find something that helped explain how to manage my way around a golf course.  I have learned most of my golf at a golf range hitting balls and taking lessons.  No one ever explained how to actually get around the course!  My comfort level on the course has increased dramatically.  Great dvd - highly recommended.,1215043200,,326,4.568965517241379
8145880,5,B000IJFRM4,"My job requires a lot of ""meetings"" out on the golf course, and as I am not an avid golfer (to say the least) this DVD was extraordinarily helpful in regards to etiquette on the course.  Though it may seem silly to some, I didn't even know I was supposed to be filling my divots!  I feel a lot more comfortable playing with the guys now, in addition to understanding their complaints about other players.  I already knew some of the information provided, so I was glad that the topics are broken down and I could just search for relevant information rather than sit through the entire hour.  I would definitely recommend this to beginners, but if you've been on a course lately it probably would benefit most golfers.",1161907200,2,717,4.534883720930233
