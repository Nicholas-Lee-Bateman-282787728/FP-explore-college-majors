8360742,5,B002B653EY,"Very much enjoyed this movie, and I agree with all the great reviews here. I'm writing to let people know that the Bonzai Media R1 DVD is very good, with good subtitles. The subs were a big concern of mine when ordering this, and I was extremely pleased with the quality. I love Masaharu Fukuyama, so this movie was especially a treat!",1426982400,,335,4.419354838709677
8360743,5,B002B653EY,"Suspect X is one of the best movies Ive seen this year, and one of the best mystery-dramas that Ive ever seen.

Its an adaptation of the 2007 TV series Galileo in which a female detective (Utsumi Kaoru) worked with a physicist (Yukawa Manabu, nicknamed ""Galileo"") to investigate strange phenomena such as teleportation and out-of-body experiences. The physicist always found a surprising natural explanation for the phenomena. He demonstrated his explanation at the end of each episode. It was like a hybrid of The X-Files and Mr. Wizard.

Movie versions of TV shows often lose focus because the writers cant handle a longer story and bigger budget. Suspect X avoids that problem and is as good as the best of the shows TV episodes.

The movie opens at the end of a previous case, with a scene that introduces the characters for anyone who didn't watch the TV show. In a brilliant bit of writing, the opening scenes flirtatious banter between the detective and Galileo provides the key to the entire mystery in the movie.

A woman is suspected of killing her abusive ex-husband, but she and her daughter have an iron-clad alibi. The alibi was arranged by her neighbor, a brilliant mathematician who was Galileos best friend in college  and who is just as smart as Galileo. Hes also secretly in love with the woman.

The mystery is irresistible but Galileo is emotionally conflicted about solving it. He admires his friend, and the woman seems like a good person who probably acted in self-defense. No spoilers, but Galileo finally solves the mystery by realizing how it depends on his friends work in mathematics.

If you don't mind subtitles, its a terrific movie.",1417392000,,1665,4.862190812720848
8360744,5,B002B653EY,"Its intelligence, suspense, and a phenomenal cast make the movie one of the best I've seen. It's a mystery thriller, but the emotion of the characters also wraps you up and makes whatever everyday worries you have seem trivial and unimportant. It's a movie that makes you cry at the same time you're trying to guess how the plot is going to unfold.

The plot is centered around a homicide, and the investigation that follows. You know who did it from the very beginning, and you are watching the cops trying to crack the case. I found myself hoping they don't. Neither side is the bad guy, and the movie is really about the intelligence of the players on both sides.

If you're on the fence about buying this, buy it.",1336089600,,717,4.465648854961832
8360745,5,B002B653EY,This dvd is so close to the book its uncanny. The book was great and riveting the dvd movie kept the essence of the book but some cruial stuu had to be omitted from the movie due to  constraints i guess but overall a great drama. The actors and actresses really portray there roles expertly. I wish more novels like this were made into movies. Thanks,1326067200,,350,4.303030303030303
8360746,5,B002B653EY,"I needed to see this movie after reading such an excellent book.  It is absolutely wonderful.  The movie does, of course, make a couple changes here and there to be more appropriate to the screen, but it is otherwise a very accurate rendition of an excellent book.  Excellent acting, direction, and story.  HIGHLY recommend.",1317081600,4,324,4.944444444444445
8360747,4,B002B653EY,"Saw this on a flight home from Japan last April. Have not seen many Japanese films, but like the style, story, and pace of this one. A little different than the Hollywood variety, but very much refreshingly so. One of our Japanese exchange students said she liked the novels and TV versions of this film. I thought that was a good sign since many of our (35) exchange students from Japan don't like Japanese films in favor of Hollywood. Overall a great cat and mouse mystery, a little over the top in acting here and there, but very enjoyable from the opening to the final credits. I would buy more films in this line if they are avaialble.",1269216000,3,640,4.432203389830509
8360748,4,B002B653EY,"I saw this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and enjoyed it so much that I purchased it as a gift for one of my children. It is sophisticated and intriguing. I'm not sure it would be as intriguing to a mathematician or physicist because I couldn't evaluate the proofs. But, it was well acted and well plotted.",1264809600,,315,4.3559322033898304
