The movie got everything... good screenplay, awesome direction, nice stunts ,a bit comedy, good quality animation, and ""No real Blood"" ... what else u need? The only flaw I found in the movie was the misplacement of songs... though all the songs were rocking ....bt they were not needed.",1304467200,,425,4.605263157894737
