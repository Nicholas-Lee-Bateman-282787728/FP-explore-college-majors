It is a wonderful romantic comedy and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes that genere.",1164153600,8,248,4.081632653061225

2414622,1,B000BDH6IU,"Very disappointed.  No place does it state dvd is not formatted for play in US.  I thought something was wrong with my dvd player.  Tried computer, a different dvd player, and no success.",1363564800,,187,4.606060606060606
2414623,5,B000BDH6IU,"The story line is great and all of the actors are fantastic in their own ways. All in all, worth a watch.",1361318400,,105,3.8181818181818183
2414624,5,B000BDH6IU,"This movies was so good I had to watch it again in 2 weeks. I didn't like the Boss lady at first with her 'sexual harrassment' that was never called that because she and her employee, Michael, was enjoying it each time it happened.

But the way the movie turned out was just fantastic.  Who would have ever believed that the Boss Lady and Michael, employee...Well, I'll have to let you fine out what else happens.

It is worth the money and you will smile, laugh, love it all. Tell others to buy this movie and many other Black movies to support our people. If we don't who will.

I am building a Black movie library for myself. I love my Black movies because I am tired of looking at White movies. I have them but there needs to be a change in my life. I want to see more of my
people in good, decent movies that don't have cursing, sex, nudity, bad language, nappy leaving a bad taste in my mouth.

There are a lot of Black decent movies out there, and you just have to look for them.  I search everywhere for them, read review and decide to buy.  I also buy black plays that I never got to see or even knew they were out there.

So lets keep buy Black movies and plays and support this media that is just beginning to thrive from us, no one else will but us.

Also buy Fire & Ice; Breakin' All The Rules; After All; Masquerade; Marrying Up (stage play); A Private Affair (BET). You wont' be sorry. Get them all from Amazon.

THIS IS AN ENJOYABLE AND LOVEABLE MOVIE.",1307318400,,1468,4.173758865248227
2414625,1,B000BDH6IU,The movie was very boring. Fair game didn't keep my attention. I thought the movie supposed to be slightly funny but i was wrong.,1295827200,,129,4.416666666666667
2414626,3,B000BDH6IU,This movie is not that great at all. It is a waste of money. It shows about office power and romance between a boss who is the female for a change and a male who is the employees. Both of them and all of the people in the office is so stupid and not even close to funny. Bid on it so that you can enjoy a few beers while watching it. It might blow your buzz however. And for me to say that makes it really really bad. (because I do not even drink).,1265500800,,448,3.7263157894736842
2414627,2,B000BDH6IU,"This could have been a great movie. Excellent plot ideas, an experienced cast, good cinematography. The direction though... Gina Torres is a good actress but for a moment I thought her horribly stillted performance was the sign of, ""Oh she's just starting out."" then I looked at the publishing date and realised that it was the director's fault. This had all the right elements to make a great romantic comedy but then the director dropped the ball and lost it down a sewer drain.
So many parts of this move did not mesh properly, the side plot ideas were good but attached to the movie like trying to add multiple wigs to an irish wolfhound. The twists and turns of the plot were either presented as so unexpected it was, ""Where did that come from and what was the point."" or so badly telegraphed as, ""Why are the characters surprised about this?""

Michael Whaley, either go back to film school for more practice in a less damaging environment or please don't direct again. Lots of experience as an actor does not a director make, particularly when you act in and direct your first movie outing.

Watch this move for an evening's light entertainment nothing more. If however you are a film student you should definitely watch this as an example of how micromanaging good talent will mess up your movie.",1197417600,2,1303,4.660869565217391
2414628,5,B000BDH6IU,"I like buying these types of movies (One's that are not highly promoted) because they usually have decent story lines. This wasn't a movie where the men were degrading the women or the women shaking their behinds all over the place.

It was a movie of black professionals who were finding their way in their professions and personal lives. A good date movie.",1168300800,12,358,4.682539682539683
2414629,1,B000BDH6IU,"I write this review as I struggle to make myself finish watching this movie.  I've talked myself out of stopping it about 3 or 4 times, but I'm no quitter I'm going to persevere until the end.  The story line is so disjointed and the characters are disappointingly one dimensional. I've watched some really good independent black films like Love, Sex and Eating the Bones or 30 to Life, but Fair Game so far has been a waste of my time.",1166832000,6,436,4.37037037037037
2414630,1,B000BDH6IU,"I try to support African American movies but when they put out garbage like this I have to let my displeasure be known.  The plot was stupid and there was absolutely no chemistry whatsover between the main characters.  Even the attempts at comedy were horrible.  There was nothing about the characters that made you want to invest in the characters or the storyline.  I just wanted the movie to be over with because I kept waiting for something to happen that would make me find some redeemable factor in this movie but nothing.  Bad actors, bad acting, bad directing, and terrible writing.",1165881600,4,590,4.745098039215686
