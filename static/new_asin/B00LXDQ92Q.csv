6509557,5,B00LXDQ92Q,Sexina is so funny and campy. Adam West was so much fun as the villain crime boss of Glitz Records and the movie pokes fun at boy bands. Lots of campy twists and turns with different plots. Great casting cause the actors were perfect for the parts they played and great directing by Erik Sharkey. He really bought out the actors campy side. Get your popcorn ready and have some fun watching Sexina with friends :),1416009600,9,413,4.447368421052632

8668804,5,B00LXDQ92Q,"The premise of the show was just something of interest to watch for me.  That is what got me to watch it to begin with, but what cept me watching was the story actually having substance, instead of just being eyecandy.  However, there is very little eyecandy involved except for skin tight leather and revealing dresses for the women in the show.

For example, by the actor and actress's script and acting there was supposed to be a real live bear in the park.  Budget issues must have forced them to go with a person in a bear halloween costume that was blatantly fake.

The premise of a phenomenally successful pop singer, living while hiding her secret life as a P.I. is novel, feel do I.  Typically it's always the 'poor' and 'downtrodden' who are the heros and heroines.  This time the Heroine makes the choice to use her own fantastic wealth to help others who have less.  That the show used Taylor Alison Swift as an anchor for believability I think is obvious.  She has often taken actions against mistakes of  the Music Industry.  However, naturally there are other artists who would but are unable to keep their career and way of life at the same time, such as she doe.

That Taylor seems to have control over her own intellectual property and thereby at least her part of Big Machine Records.  That allows her to do things that financially impact companies such as Apple, and thereby force their board members to actually listen instead of bloviate.

Yet, the Sexina character is only physically similar to Taylor in one way, hair color.  Everything else and their histories are different.  Perhaps they did this for legal reasons.

Thank you for sharing your time with reading this, and Force;  May you eternally ask the Goddess to alight your chosen path.",1469404800,2,1768,4.666666666666667
8668805,4,B00LXDQ92Q,"I bought this for one reason: Adam West.  Overall, I liked it for more than I should have.  The acting was mediocre at best, and the script swung wildly between hilariously inappropriate and the kind of terrible script a twelve year old would write.  The cinematography was better done than a cell phone on a stick, but it wasn't great.

But somehow it all pulled together and made for a fun watch.  I really enjoyed it.  Someone with an imdb account really needs to load up some quotes from this movie on there.",1466380800,,512,4.451612903225806
8668806,4,B00LXDQ92Q,"Anything with the title Sex and starring Adam West should inform you what you're getting into. This is a silly, comical, over the top modern B-movie instant classic. This has all the trademarks of a truly memorable Drive-In, late night, corny, spectacular romp of B-grade Heaven.

All one has to do is listen to the plot. A teen pop star named Sexina also just happens to be a private Detective that fights, thats right, evil inside the music world. Now lets add in a missing scientist that is being held against his will and made to create a Robot Boy Band, yes you read that right, its not a typo. The enemy is The Boss of Glitz records. If that don't turn you on to this, then nothing will, did I mention Batman is in this, the one and only Adam West.

If Roger Corman and Britney Spears had a love child it would be Sexina.

Lauren DAvella stars as your main character Sexina. This is only her second film, and her first starring role. She captures the silliness of the film. She is able to hold the attention of the viewer with the over the top reality that is the script. Dont go into to this movie wanting an Oscar Worthy film, go into this with your brains turned off, and ready to have fun. As I have stated also starring Adam West which is just the perfection one needs. West is West. He is Willy Wonkas golden ticket. Priceless as always.

Actress Annie Golden is also in this. She most recently is of Orange is the New Black fame. In reality Annies been acting for many years now. Starting in the 1970s. She is one of those actresses that never get the just due, she is truly a star, and should be recognized. Also starring Luis Jose Lopez. He to captures his part with total entertainment value. He too has been working for many years and in my viewpoint is an underrated actor. The whole cast of the film is great; each one just floors their characters with comical perfection.

Written and directed by actor, and director Erik Sharkey. This is his first feature length film. He has done some shorts and 2 documentaries. He is kind of a miscellaneous guru of film, actor, writer, director, producer, camera work and so on. To me he captured in Sexina, a film that true diehard lovers of comedy, b-movies, late night Drive-In flare, will want to watch over, and over. This is also a film to talk about and watch with a group that understands this type of comical B-movie entertainment. The characters are just awesomely crafted and the script is absolutely ridiculous in nature, and yet that is the brilliance of it.

Sexina is a wild, over the top, hoot of entertainment. Crazy plot, characters and conclusion. Just an ultimate good time of corniness. Enter this wanting to roll your eyes, giggle, laugh and you will be totally satisfied.

""Did I mention it has Ninja's"".

Overall:

Turn your brain off, and your funny bone up. A wild instant Cult film. Simple, silly, and B-tastic entertainment. This is for all those who love corny films. This is for those who have a great sense of humor, and if you don't this movie will give you one.",1462147200,,3741,4.528189910979228

8668808,3,B00LXDQ92Q,"The film opens with a smart opening soundtrack, reminiscent of a Bond film...""fighting crime and villainy to save the music industry."" Sexina (Lauren D'Avella) is a pop star whose hit album is ""I Did What Again?"" Clearly a Britney spoof. Also the high school is named ""Britney High."" The film is camp and the plot is inane. Adam West whose face we don't see until the end, plays the evil record label CEO who claims, ""All I care about is money and boy bands."" Sexina dons latex to do her crime fighting. The film spoofs pop culture and pop music, but I didn't have one good laugh, just a few smiles.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Adult talk. Football coach is gay as is Sexina's secretary which was part of the cheap humor.",1437523200,3,727,4.425373134328358
