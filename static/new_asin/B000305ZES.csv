8035618,5,B000305ZES,"I live in Philadelphia, so I get to see a lot of CZW shows, and I have to say that this is one of my favorites. CZW is an ultraviolent promotion that loves to use lighttubes, thumbtacks, barbed wire, and even weedwhackers as much as possible. Also they can exhibit some of the greatest high flying matches ever. This event was held in Delaware and was their first annual deathmatch tournament.

Matches-

Zandig vs Nate Hatred ( Light tube barbed wire flyer match)-

Stupid match, becuase Lobo and his boys broke it up. But it marks the return of Messiah. 2/10

(Non-tournament)The green phantom & Arsenal vs the Hardcore Ninjas- Some dudes from IWS put on an ok match. Nice Sit-out tiger piledriver at the end. 5/10

Necro Butcher vs Wifebeater(Falls Count Anywhere)- Pretty good match nice ending when Wifebeater Chokensteins Necro off the stage onto chairsVery stiff match. 7/10

Nick Gage vs ""Mr. Insanity"" Toby Klein(Barbed Wire boards and nail strips)- An ok match which marks the debut in CZW of Insanity. No real high spots in this one. 6/10

Sick Nick Mondo vs Homeless Jimmy (Falls Count Anywhere)- GREAT BUMP!! One of the Best matches of the night, only becuase at the end a great bump in which Mondo Assault Drivers Jimmy off of a truck onto light tube cabin and tables. 9/10

(Non-tournament)Backseat Boys vs Sonjay&Derick Frazier vs New Skool vs John Dahmer and Eric Tuttle- Pretty good match. (4/10)

(Non-tournament)Justice Pain vs Ruckus vs Nick Berk- Very good technical match. 6/10

Nick Gage vs Wifebeater(panes of glass match)- Great match because the pane of glass is so awesome. Great start to the match. 9/10

Final Match- Nick Mondo vs Wifebeater(200 light tubes match)- Best match of the night, so much blood, bucket of salt, and even the weedwhacker!!!!. 20/10",1105920000,3,1901,4.88785046728972
