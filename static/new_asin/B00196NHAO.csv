This will open your eyes - it's very well done.  Everyone should know what these aboriginal Americans suffered, even up to our more contemporary times!",1356393600,,337,5.109090909090909
3423690,5,B00196NHAO,I show this to my classes almost every semester when we talk about education and the many ways it has been used in the past. If you haven't seen this yet I highly encourage you to do so.,1351728000,5,186,3.9210526315789473
3423691,5,B00196NHAO,"This movie is a true story about 'The Land Of The Free', America and how the Indian people were treated when Europeans came to that land.  Real people tell their story how as children they were taken from their family and taught to be christian.  This is a similar stort to the abolriginal people of Australia.  Indiginous people world wide have received a rough deal.  Touching in its truth and honesty.
Another tale all need to watch and learn from.  Heartbraking in its honesty.",1333152000,,481,4.678571428571429
3423692,4,B00196NHAO,"This was an excellent documentary. I wish it could be shown to a wider European-American audience though. I haven't met one White person who knows about the boarding school system or the damage it did. In fact, I think a little more time could have been spent on just that in the documentary. This horrible system nearly extinguished the use of all of the Native languages. Today there are only 30 languages being spoken. Language is culture, and as soon as the language is stopped then so goes the culture. Then of course there is all of the child and spousal abuse and historical trauma, which is associated with this program. This was a devastating program and it is still impacting Native people today.
  Overall, the documentary did an excellent job of providing a history of the program. Gayle Ross also did an excellent job. The survivors presentations were the most poignant of all though. It is good to see survivors, especially for a non-Indian audience. They must learn that Native people continue to be abused today and programs like this could help them to understand this.",1289347200,9,1086,4.802139037433155
3423693,4,B00196NHAO,"Being a Native American myself, I have seen other documentaries
with more true to life stories. However, this documentary grab-bed me by the heart. It was a more mellow type and suggest peoples interested watch it. I would also like to suggest Amazon
make available the more true to life horrors these children and their families went through.",1260316800,10,343,4.931034482758621
3423694,5,B00196NHAO,"When I was in school quite sometime ago, our ""history"" did not include much at all about the Native Americans.  When I watched this, I was in total shock that this country could be so evil; not to mention the unspeakable abuse was to children.  People calling themsleves Christians and yet, treating other human beings so inhumanely.  We were no better than the Nazis and their atrocities.  This is definitely an eye-opener!",1249344000,12,424,4.847222222222222
3423695,5,B00196NHAO,"The Indian Boarding School experience is something rarely taught in our schools and yet it is a very important piece of US history. The systematic removal and brainwashing of Indian children in these schools has led to the historical trauma that still resonates through their families today. If we are to right the wrongs of the past, we must first acknowledge that they took place. ""Our Spirits Don't Speak English"" goes a long way to that end...",1244592000,10,447,4.818181818181818
3423696,5,B00196NHAO,"""Our Spirits Don't Speak English"" masterfully moves you from disbelief through outrage to resolve as it focuses the light of truth on one of darkest periods of cultural genocide in American history. The Indian Boarding School concept is a perfect example of good intentions gone awry and bad intentions gone amuck. Using interviews, photos, and old film clips, Gayle Ross gently but purposefully exposes the practice of assimilating indigenous children into a foreign white culture, and the devastating effects on these young people as well as on generations of Native Americans to follow. Some of the survivors' interviews are painful to witness, but you can't look away as you're drawn in by their raw courage -- to tell the truth, to relive the trauma, and to ultimately triumph over tragedy. It is a MUST SEE for all who are willing to stare America the Beautiful's ugly little secret in the face. The movie speaks to our spirits in a very clear language about accountability, forgiveness, and the need to move forward together.",1215648000,38,1032,5.005813953488372

8272150,5,B00196NHAO,"Forgetting, I would even go so far as to say historical error, is a crucial factor in the creation of a nation, which is why progress in historical studies often constitutes a danger for [the principle of] nationality (Renan 11). This famous statement, made in Ernest Renans 1882 essay What Is a Nation? illuminates the national consensus on the treatment of Native American people during the twentieth century: one of active forgetting. While European Americans tried to forget Native Americans, Native Americans were unable to forget the trauma of colonization, including boarding schools. In 2008, Rich-Heape Films, a Native American owned corporation, insisted on the importance of memory by producing a masterful documentary Our Spirits don't speak English: Indian Boarding School. With its ability to change the national consensus of forgetting by altering the hearts and minds of white viewers, this documentary is a remarkable achievement.

Told from the Native American perspective, the 80-minute film fulfills the double task of uncovering the dark history of the U.S. Government policy that so few people know about and giving voice to the countless Indian children forced through a system designed to strip them of their Native American culture, heritage and traditions (Our Spirits website). As Dr. Daniel Wildcat affirms at the beginning, this complicated story is one that Americans need to be told because most Americans have no idea at all about the boarding schools.

From the very beginning, the heart-wrenching tone of the film is set. It starts with a voiceover by the actor August Schellenberg, a Mohawk descent, as white text appears on a black screen to emphasize striking words and phrases. Quoting the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, he emphasizes the consequences of the boarding school policy, still omnipresent today:

 [] brutalizing them emotionally, psychologically, physically, and spiritually. So, many of the maladies suffered today in Indian country result from the failures of this agency. Poverty, ignorance and disease have been the product of this agencys work. Today, I stand before you as the leader of an institution that in the past has committed acts so terrible that they infect, diminish and destroy lives of Indian people decades later, generations later.

Although considered as a stain on the nation, these wrongs must be acknowledged if the healing is to begin. After the outstanding opening segment, Our Spirits don't speak English intertwines interviews with Native peoples who survived the boarding schools and some who had parents or grandparents who survived them, the narration by Gayle Ross, a Cherokee historian and storyteller, historical photographs, and contemporary stories that demonstrate the continuing destructive effects of the system.

The first Indian boarding school was established in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, in 1879. Kill the Indian, and save the Man was the mission statement of its founder, Captain Richard Henry Pratt. This mission statement became the general philosophy of boarding schools. Providing some historical perspective, the explanations of actual facts are completed by priceless personal stories. Delivering powerful emotions and anger, the first-person interviews are particularly compelling and touching. Statements like the following deepen the viewers understanding of the cultural genocide that occurred here not that long ago:

I want to tell you where I came from. A safe, warm, loving home. I was never hungry, I was never cold. My parents took good care of me. I was well-dressed, had all that I needed, I was loved. And I was taken from that and put in a cold institutional environment, made to strip. My identity was taken away. Who I was was gone.

Stripped of any sort of uniqueness and identity, American Indians had to endure the horrible brainwashing techniques used in the process of assimilation.

This admirable production distinguishes from other historical documentaries. Not only does it provide an overall history of the boarding schools system, but it also makes history come to life through the poignant accounts of the survivors of this assimilation process. Americans can no longer try to forget their dark history, or historical error as Renan would call it. In order for the healing process to start, the disturbing reality must ultimately be faced and acknowledged.

8272152,5,B00196NHAO,"When brought up in the United States school system, it's hard to imagine an America where treatment of a certain class of people was as bad as what we condemn genocidal dictators for doing to their on suppressed peoples.  But this film is a well made and clear example of what the established elite decided was the best thing for the Native Americans -- teach them how to forget who they are and make them good domestic servants for the elite.  One sad thing is many of the elite really were motivated by misplaced compassion for the Indians with this boarding school idea. They thought they were doing the best thing.  Sadder still is the reality, however, especially the abuse, and the lifelong ill effects.  Important window into the more recent sanctioned US government's ongoing attempt to extinguish this noble people.",1398211200,2,824,4.822695035460993
