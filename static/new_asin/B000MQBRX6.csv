8170805,5,B000MQBRX6,"I will lead with the fact that I love Mythbusters specials, particularly the ones involving sharks! The DVD is exactly what you would expect and a few extras. Overall a good show, but I kind of wish that these specials would just be included in the season sets. (Or that they would at least release the others on DVD!)",1342224000,,318,4.406779661016949
8170806,2,B000MQBRX6,"This DVD is definitely nothing to write home about, but then again, anyone who enjoys ""Mythbusters"" might like it.  My opinion is that these ""Mythbusters"" guys have too much free time (and money to go along with it).  And, as any shark-lover knows, if sharks do have a color preference it's ""yum-yum yellow.""  After watching it with the person I bought it for, I realized, ""hey, I have this DVD!""

What I REALLY have a problem with is the Discovery channel selling and packaging single DVDs as something new when it's already part of another boxed set that they're selling.  They make sure to omit that little ""tidbit"" from the product information.  For instance, Oceans of Fear, Fearless Fury, Shark Hunter (Frank Mundus) and Bull Shark:  World's Deadliest Shark, Shark Week 20th Anniversary (and others I can't remember offhand) -- are either ALL or segments of one of their other boxed sets .  They need to inform buyers about that -- talking about ripping off the public!!  My advice:  before buying a Discovery channel DVD, see what episodes are included and if they're not listed, go to Discovery's website as they list the contents of their DVDs.  Caveat emptor (let the buyer beware).",1335225600,2,1192,4.822660098522167
