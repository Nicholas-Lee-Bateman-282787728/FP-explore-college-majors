8389853,4,B0036BX5WK,"DVD is great for different options for countdowns, many to choose from. But as another reviewer noted the Audio is annoying. I tend to have to use it on mute and sometime miss when time is up. I wish they had tracks that did not have the ticking sound.",1289865600,,252,4.163265306122449
8389854,4,B0036BX5WK,"I really wanted something like this for my workouts (where I try to do as many circuits as I can within a certain amount of time, aka density training) and now it's here.  The numbers are nice and big and easy to see across the room.  You can't program a customized time or program intervals of varying times, but the DVD gives you a choice of ""popular"" times from 60 minutes to 30 seconds, and you can set it up from the menu to either count straight down and then go back to the menu, or loop the same time over and over.  (When looping, there's a lag of several seconds between loops; maybe that varies with DVD players, I don't know.)

My biggest complaint, really my only one, is the ""soundtrack"".  It consists of an annoying ticking noise, and when the time reaches zero, there's a sound like an explosion.  Teachers will probably want to mute the sound and just announce ""pencils down!"" when time is up, rather than force everyone to hear that ticking.  I wish there was an option for silence except for the alarm, and a choice of alarms would have been nice - a beep, a chime, etc.

For the price, though, I'm satisfied.  I know there are ipod apps and online timers, but I wanted something for the DVD player, so I know I'll use this often.",1276473600,3,1249,4.32618025751073
