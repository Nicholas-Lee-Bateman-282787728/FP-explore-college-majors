7999119,1,B0000CEB4R,"I purchased the ""We Sign"" videos named: Fun Time, Play Time and Animals.  They were perfect for my little ones' (12 to 24 Months) interest level and attention span.

I was excited to get the next set of ""We Sign"" videos named: Numbers, Colors and More Animals.  What a disappointment.  We Sign changed the format, the singer (really bad) and characters.  I thought they were terrible.  So much so - I sent them all back at my own expense!!",1176595200,,439,4.493670886075949
7999120,1,B0000CEB4R,"wish I could give this more stars but I just can't. This is the same company (same people in the video) as Say, Sing & Sign. This video is just too fast to really learn how to sign the songs. They try to break it down first but it's too fast to learn it. You'll have to do a lot of rewinding if you want to learn to sign along. As with the Say, Sing & Sign videos, the signer doesn't sing out loud the songs but instead she mouths the words to the songs. It's so annoying because sometimes the singing voices are kids or a man. It looks so stupid when she mouths those songs. The best children's signing videos, in my opinion, are Signing Time and My Baby Can Talk. Before buying We Sign More Animals I would suggest you see if your library has it first. I have written other reviews so please read them too.",1116374400,,808,4.05625
