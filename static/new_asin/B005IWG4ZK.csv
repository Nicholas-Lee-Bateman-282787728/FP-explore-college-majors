4710509,3,B005IWG4ZK,"I watched this movie in the deep hours of the night, on a flight from America to Australia. I believe that at the time it had not yet been released in the theatres.

As a child, I grew up about 50 miles from Snowtown. I also like true crime stories, so when I saw this on the airline movie line-up, I immediately started watching it. Nothing prepared me for how this movie impacted me. The words ""deeply disturbing"" don't even begin to describe this movie. From the eerie music, the bleakness of this poor Adelaide suburb, the dark and tortuous story - it was not a regular movie about a serial killer. It was an immersion, an assault to the senses, an experience that left me feeling as though I wanted to scrub it out of my brain - with a wire brush or whatever it took. No such luxury. Months later and I still feel violated.

I give this movie three stars, only because it was artfully done, to have evoked such strong feelings. I've watched many movies in my life, but none like the assault that was Snowtown. I would not recommend this movie to any friend.

I withheld two stars for having this in my head for the rest of my life - because I'll never forget it.",1336608000,5,1167,4.271493212669683
4710510,4,B005IWG4ZK,"Snowtown is based off of an actual serial killer in Australia (of which I know nothing about) where an abused family of boys go through a paternal figure transition, and the phrase ""out of the frying pan and into the fire"" applies here, but if you happen to not know anything about this story it's best I just leave it here.

Not since Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer have I seen such an intimate and disturbing look into a murderer's psyche. But what I found most interesting about Snowtown was how one of the characters just switches from 'lovable family man' to 'sadistic psychopath"" as if he had a switch in his mind. Another thing that was interesting was the neighborhood having dinner together and getting into a really heated discussion of just how severe the punishment for pedophiles should be (a discussion I'm sure everyone's been in before), and you really start to see the warning signs of how far one of the characters takes the conversation to.

Also another thing I liked about Snowtown was how claustrophobic the whole thing felt if you put yourself into the main character's shoes. Whenever I watch something like this I always think about what I would've done in that situation, but Snowtown just shows you how helpless some very unfortunate souls are, and it makes it all the more disturbing that the kid is basically forced to become a psychopath, nurture wins this one.

Snowtown is a disturbing and ugly film, yet you can't deny it's very well done in every regard. If you're interested in either the real life crime or want to see an intimate study on the pathology of a serial killer Snowtown will not disappoint. Everyone else who wants to watch Cars 3 instead should stay far far away.",1334361600,,1716,4.656765676567657
4710511,1,B005IWG4ZK,"I love watching non-traditional films and imports.  In a technical sense this was an excellent movie.  In a practical sense, it was painful to watch.  There were too many artistic transitions from scene to scene (i.e. landscape shots with thematic music).  The dialogue was hard to follow; often the actors were talking with food in their mouths.  To me this movie is a dramatic documentary without a narrator.  It's a very very slow-burn without a boom at the end.  Instead you'll get a quick summary of the resolution of the investigation into the murders.",1334361600,6,558,4.872340425531915
4710512,2,B005IWG4ZK,"I must say that I did not like this film.  While it had its moments of good acting and photography, it was long and boring.  The story is essentially about how sociopaths can influence others to become sociopaths at some level.  It may even influence reviewers such as the earlier review where the he states that he enjoys this type of film.  That mankind can attain such sickness as to perform acts of extreme cruelty to others is nothing new to the film industry and I viewed the film expecting some degree of unpleasantness.  My overall emotion was one of pity for most of the characters because of their lack of intelligence that left them unexpecting of their demise or unknowing of the happiness to which a better life might lead.  But I was also expecting something new or different in the presentation of the subjects.  Given the favorable reviews the film received, I was disappointed.

Furthermore, I do not need to be told by other reviewers what types of films I should watch just because I did not like a particular film.  That kind of ignorant and arrogant order was delivered by a reviewer who has no idea of who he is deciding to command the types of films to which he feels we must limit ourselves.",1333929600,9,1215,4.536697247706422
4710513,5,B005IWG4ZK,"This is a film by director Justin Curzel who, with Warp Pictures, had to get reporting restrictions lifted on the real life case that this film depicts, in order to screen his work. It is about the `Bodies in Barrels' murders that took place in South Australia between 1992 and 1999. In the film we start with a low rent family in Adelaide's suburbs, a place that is beyond bleak, full of slots, smokes and squalor.  The mother (Elizabeth Harvey) has three sons and an elder one (half brother) who comes in later. They have a `special uncle' who lives across the road, and whilst he seems to be interested in Elisabeth, he is actually abusing the young boys. She finds out and goes `ape' to coin an oft used vernacular.

Enter new guy John Bunting (Daniel Henshall) he appears as a knight in rusting armour and sets about ousting the paedophile. Now ensconced as a vigilante hero, he takes on the mantle of local moral guardian and enlists the help of others in his `work'. Jamie (Lucas Pittaway) is sixteen and has more troubles than most of that age, John decides he needs to `grow a pair' and thus he gets sucked into a world of violence, torture and murder.

This is a beautifully shot film and has been accused of being too arty, lingering shots, periods of no dialogue etc. However the seeming ordinariness of those moments is the perfect juxtaposition for the brutal things that are happening on screen. All of the actors are totally convincing, even the world ropiest transvestite and the guy with learning difficulties. The music is minimal but potent and we have a full grotesquery of supporting characters, plus scenes of kangaroo butchery which is pretty disturbing.

I was so gripped by this that I felt I had only been watching for about an hour when it had finished, when this is a two hour film. I then checked out the real case and it is actually worse than what the film depicts, which is probably a good thing. The film leaves it up to the viewer to judge the people and whilst you are clear who the guilty parties are, as things progress the clear lines of guilt and innocence get blurred to beyond recognition.

Once again Screen Australia has brought us an excellent film that whilst many will find disturbing still  makes a powerful statement and an engrossing film into the bargain. I can only recommend with the caveat that the violence is disturbing, but despite that is far from gratuitous, this is not `torture porn'. If you find this to your liking then `Animal Kingdom' will be one you might enjoy too.",1333152000,35,2532,4.59070796460177
4710514,5,B005IWG4ZK,"Yeah, this movie is definitely gonna rub some fur the wrong way.  I was pretty disgusted by it and would expect that most normal people would be.  Yet as the movie wound on I couldn't help but admire the ""acting"" that felt so seamlessly real.  It's one of the reasons the film gets under your skin so much - the people and locations come off so realistically.  Which of course makes everything else that happens all the more horrific.  I didn't even realize it was based on a true story until the end which again only increased my appreciation for the elements that made this picture so believable.

Bunting, in the tradition of Manson and Hitler, was the kind of psychopath that got others to help him.  The violence in the movie is not so much bloody as psychological - yes there is certainly blood (physical violence), and male rape scenes. Bunting himself starts off with a seemingly reasonable distaste for child molesters. Part of the disturbing nature of the film is that a part of you may not completely fault him his desiring of vigilante justice.  On the other hand, what starts as a certain amount of desire for revenge and distaste for criminals, turns simply to psycopathic blood lust and sadism.  It's interesting and harrowing to watch the shift from one to the other, and to watch the hapless victims in his life that willingly or unwillingly become a part of his madness.  One has to step away and realize that the work that went into this was the work of actors, screenwriters and a director - a depiction of what happened and not the actual events themselves - before one can realize what was accomplished here.  This is a very well-done movie - the shoe that fits is the shoe you don't notice.  And an actor you beleive is one you forget is an actor.  Snowtown is a no joy ride, but it doesn't bore either, and there's no doubt it is fine cinematic work.",1332115200,2,1874,4.508875739644971
4710515,2,B005IWG4ZK,"I thought the movie was going to be higher octane.  Really, it just meanders through two hours of Bah, Meh and boredom.  Im not too familiar with serial killer Bunting, although Ive heard of him.  The movie really tries to dig deep into the home lives and minds of the characters.  How true it is to actual events who knows and who cares I just wanted to see the killings and that was lacking.

I wish they had ended the film with the guys being caught and maybe showing some actual news reel footage of them being handcuffed and incarcerated for closure and authenticity, but instead they ended with subitltes.  What a Jip.  In the end, white trash families in Australia just don't do it for me.",1330473600,3,696,4.433070866141732
4710516,4,B005IWG4ZK,"This film is at times quite violent and anything but comfortable. Nevertheless, the serial killer story is presented here in a form not unconventional for this particular genre. Handheld camera work, with a lot of bitter cold cyan and blue tones, subtle editing and only sparse use of a soundtrack give it, despite the occasional hard to bear violence, a more artistic and intricate look at the manipulative nature of psychopaths.

John Henshall is absolutely magnificent as Australian mass murderer John Bunting. While entering the lives of a fatherless, impoverished family, he slowly manipulates one of the emotionally lost sons into becoming a confused and angry teenage accomplice. Henshall does so by portraying a charismatic father figure out of nowhere. With jokes, pranks and a fun personality that silently drifts into very calculated acts of torture and death, he did a great job fooling me with gentle smiles and supportive comments to the most desperate characters in need of support.

I have no problem putting it into the ranks of Harmony Corrine's ""Gummo"", Gus Van Sant's ""Paranoid Park"" and ""Elephant"", or Larry Clark's ""Kids"". That being a rank of artistic integrity, a bleak, modern interpretation of neo-realism. It wasn't easy to watch but I'm glad I saw it.",1330214400,,1279,5.144230769230769
4710517,5,B005IWG4ZK,"""Snowtown"" is a film adaptation of the South Australian Snowtown / Bodies in Barrels murders.

The narrative mainly follows the perspective of teenager James Spyridon Vlassakis (played by Aaron Viergever), who comes from a broken and abusive home.

Vlassakis and his mother are befriended by John Justin Bunting (played by Daniel Henshall) who at first appears friendly, but is a sadistic psychopath who maintains the trust of James Vlassakis, which contributes to James becoming an aid and witness to the spree of murders.

The mood of this film is continuously morose with murky cinematography that perpetuates an unhinged perspective, and the film music is disconcerting, which adds to the feeling of bleakness.

The narrative to this film may cause some viewers to feel disorientated by its at times unprompted flow of events, yet this allows the viewer to understand that Bunting and Robert Joe Wagner (played by Lucas Pittaway) are driven by views and emotions that are perplexing to those of rational mind.

Daniel Henshall's performance as Bunting displays ferocious energy with misplaced smiles, and looks of satisfaction as life departs from the bodies of tortured victims.

Viewers should take some caution before watching this film to ensure that they are prepared for a movie that might knock them off their seats with shock and uneasiness. However, it is the story of twelve brutal murders and the viewer is certainly taken there by this film.

There is nobody to root for.  For the first 90 minutes, you can't even really feel bad for the people that die.  But the fact that it can create such a sense of dread for two hours straight is a testament to the value of the movie.  It is two straight hours of unpleasantness with no sly winks to the audience to break the tension.  There was nothing that felt compromised or stylized in order to make the content easier to swallow.  It's quite an experience and is worth watching.",1477008000,3,665,4.365853658536586
4710522,3,B005IWG4ZK,"To start, if you're not accustomed to British films (in this case Australian), skip this - as they are much slower and many Americans aren't satisfied unless they have non-stop action. Movies like these are more cerebral - and less instant-gratification. But you'd be educating yourself to expose yourself beyond the typical American formula movie.

That said - this is a difficult movie to watch, although a decently well-made film. Being a true-story, it is hard to see how some live, and how easily some people can be convinced to do the unthinkable. Some of the scenes I literally had to turn away from. True horror - yet reality.

This film is truly a horror film about a serial killer and the psychological trauma he inflicts while manipulating and grooming his victims and helpers.

It is a very disturbing film that gives you a sideline view of what happens to people in these situations, the acting cinematography and sound design as well as editing perfectly reflects this horrible world and the crimes of this evil person.

4710545,5,B005IWG4ZK,"For me, the point of cinema is to be able to inhabit a completely different reality.  To have my beliefs or notions challenged, to be forced to meditate on things that are not easy to understand.  ""Snowtown"" manages to accomplish this end flawlessly.  This was a viewing experience that stayed with me for days after I watched it for the first time.  It was a film I had to refrain from attempting to talk about with my friends and family.  A bleak, unflinching portrait of hopelessness, ""Snowtown"" chronicles perfectly what can happen when a group of desperate victims encounter just the right kind of charismatic leader.

The word that comes to mind when watching this film is inevitable.  John Bunting manages to employ the perfect amount of insight into the lives and emotions of the people around him and turn them to serve his own ends.  While many reviewers have focused on Jamie being drawn down into the rabbit hole, the best example of this is with his mother, Elizabeth.  Here we have a single mother who is grappling with poverty, depression, and alcoholism, and then must confront the guilt of finding that the neighbor she trusted to watch her sons sexually abused them.  It is not hard to imagine John had no trouble turning her guilt and grief into raw anger at the men who are like those who abused her and who abused her boys.

Furthering the atmosphere that things simply could not have happened any other way, our main protagonist, Jamie, clearly has none of the tools necessary to go head to head with John Bunting.  Sensitive, withdrawn, and passive, we see him pushed to a breaking point where he becomes a barely conscious ghost whose only aim is to self medicate to the point that he can live with the things he must see and do.

Visually, ""Snowtown"" manages to make scenes that would be virtually unwatchable watchable simply with their consistent color design.  Heavily reliant on cyan filters, any blood appears almost like excrement.  There is also a highly effective use of insinuated action.  ""Snowtown"" does not have the aim of being a gore-fest, your imagination is lead to come to your own horrible conclusions.  This is masterful film making.  In a society where we like to have things rammed down our throats, it is easy to gloss over the fact that killers are still human beings that, in fact, spend the majority of their time doing mundane tasks like us: eating, watching television, bantering over coffee.  This is an immersive experience in which the normalcy helps to underline how these things actually look in real life.

Ultimately, how much you will appreciate this film will be determined by what you are hoping to get out of the experience.  While there are some scenes that are shocking, this isn't an easy exhibitionist film in the vein of the deplorable ""Girl Next Door,"" it is a character study of a community who has been abused and abuse each other over and over again.

4710565,1,B005IWG4ZK,"For those who don't know, shills are people who either because they're paid, or just have too much time on their hands, go out and give positive reviews to products which are horrid.

As I've watched a bit of True Crime films in my time (Docudramas more or less), I was actually drawn to watch this because there were reviews which said this movie was worth watching because of its great production, directing, sound, filming, etc... After about 30 minutes I realized I'd been suckered in by a shill.

The sound quality is so poor, you'll find yourself desperately trying to find the right audio, trying to actually hear what the actors are saying so you turn the volume up, only to have the scene switch quickly and have loud music BLASTED in your ears.  I would normally suggest you watch such films with CC, however, predictably, nobody has taken the time to do the CC, probably because they couldn't suffer through the entire film.

I can't say anything about the acting, either way, as the script was so poor, and the lines mumbled so badly (note: this is a reflection upon both the director and producer of the film, as when we see a professionally produced film, if the actor DID mumble a line badly, they will have to read the line again directly into the microphone so it can be edited in) I can't tell if I should blame the acting because the production value is so low, or tell if the actors did a great job at portraying vapid, vaguely creepy characters (though by the end of the film, it's clear EVERY character in it comes off as creepy).  Note, I'm not saying anything about the story, because frankly, without being able to hear the characters talk no matter HOW many times I adjusted the volume or tried to adjust for better mid range, etc.., I never really figured out what the story was supposed to be.  Some kid was sadly molested by a neighbor, then by his brother, and eventually people die. That's about all I can tell you for certain.

This is an utterly disturbing movie, though I can't tell if I found it so because I found the entire film disturbing, or if it was the director's obvious desire to shock you (it did accomplish this.  I'm shocked I'm even taking the time to write this) I found disturbing, or maybe it was just the fact this film somehow managed to get onto Amazon.  Whatever the reason, I've wasted almost 2 hours of my life on this, and it's the last 2 hours I will ever spend worrying about it.

Just know, before you watch this, you were warned you would LEGITIMATELY wish you could get those 2 hours back afterwards.  The positive reviews absolutely MUST be from people that have a financial interest in you paying to watch it.  Don't be fooled.",1388966400,4,2692,4.482617586912065

Im not sure what standards to apply to a film like this in evaluating whether its good or notbut it is undeniably effective at conveying the inhuman brutality and base sadism behind these murders. The performances (especially those of Daniel Henshall as Bunting and Lucas Pittaway as his psychological victim/accomplice) are masterfully creepy, and the story WILL haunt you.

This is a powerful, visceral movie. It will horrify you and make you want to make sure your children are safe at all times. I read several reviews before I began watching the film. One was particularly interesting. The reviewer basically stated that the choices made by one of the main characters, Jamie, made it impossible to empathise with him. I think the reviewer missed the mark. Jamie had no choices, none at all. It became abundantly clear from the start of the movie that before John Bunting even entered his life, his ability to choose was fairly nonexistent. The movie starts with with a beleagered, single mother of 4 in a poverty stricken neighborhood. We, as the viewers, have no idea whether she's a good mother or not, but we find out fairly early that she is not a good judge of men. All her children and, particularly, Jamie, are sexually abused by her boyfriend. That is the first real clue that Jamie's choices are limited. He goes on to suffer further abuse at the hands of his own flesh and blood. And then the advent of John Bunting into his life. Jamie apparently was 16 at that time and John Bunting was a very charismatic sociopath. He becomes a father figure in the life of a child who had no positive influences in his life. Whatever choices Jamie may have had were systematically destroyed by Bunting with tragic results. Watch this movie. It will be uncomfortable to watch and oh so sad, but it is a good movie. And it will make you want to hug your kids and do everything in your power to make absolutely, positively sure that they are safe from harm.",1378684800,3,1756,4.5251572327044025

The theme is horrific, though true and very disturbing on many levels.  I have strong personal views on anyone who touches a kid and have no issues with what happened to the monsters which were dealt with here and even felt that their murders were justified (though many would argue with me on that).  I drive myself and other's nuts when I watch a movie, cause I'm always talking to the screen, but this one... not one peep.  It's THAT intense. I watched it, then watched it again.

Both have already been mentioned.

1.) It's hard to understand what they are saying. Not sure if that's because of their accent or because the audio quality was really bad and it was hard to hear. Huh!? Whajasay?!

2.) I get that this isn't a horror movie, but if you're going to make us sit through 2 hours of it, at least show us some goshdarn blood and gore. I mean, that's why most of us are watching this movie. It's not because we want to see a comedy and get a few laughs, it's because we want barf bag-filling graphic murder scenes.

But for crissakes, leave animals out of this.  That scene 41 minutes in was an effective way to show us who these characters are but the rest of the movie didn't deliver. So when you're watching this movie and there's a dog on your sofa sitting next to you and you get to that scene and think that might be the time to turn it off, do yourself a favor and turn it off. You're really not missing anything after that point.  Go watch ""I Spit On Your Grave"" if you want to see it done right.",1377475200,7,1071,4.14975845410628

4710581,4,B005IWG4ZK,"Like ""Natural Born Killers"" this Australian flick explores the many different psychological facets of serial killing as it involves human relationships. Based on a true story coming out of South Australia in the nineties, this film looks at the role played by a charismatic, self-serving vigilante named John Bunting who inserted himself into a family living in a low-end suburb of Adelaide and proceeded to enlist its members in an effort to `clean up' the neighbourhood of its degenerates: druggies, pimps, perverts, and drifters. What is really chilling about this dreary movie is that the filmmaker tends to focus a lot on how Bunting, the psychopathic ringleader, disposes of his victims with such calm and deliberate dispatch. The family whom he has befriended are so taken up with their own victimization(the sons have been molested by a neighbour)that it fails to see his true motives. He is a hardwired, sadistic killer hell-bent on taking the law into his own hands and making unwitting people do his evil bidding. His ability to make others do his dirty work with relative ease is the most visceral part of this film. In demagogic fashion, Bunting creates a familial co-dependency in the community where people actually start believing that he will make life better for them even if they already know what he is really up to behing the scenes. It will take incredible courage for someone to step up and break this terrible cycle of fear, violence and murder. The cast-setting in this production adequately represents the criminal element in society that loves to bully, torture, and manipulate weak-willed people into submission.",1376092800,,1640,5.100371747211896

1.  The dialogue is performed in Australian Hillbilly.  The only two words I understood were ""mate"" and the f-bomb, both are which are used in almost every sentence.

2.  Characters wander in and out like busboys in a restaurant.  They come and go so quickly you never have any idea of their purpose, assuming there is one.

3.  Everyone is uniformly ugly, probably drug addicts scrounged up from the Outback.

4.  The only nudity is one hideous fat woman who stands facing the camera for what seems like forever.  Who knows why?  The only saving grace is that her x-rated part is hidden in rolls of blubber.

5.  The film looks like it was shot through the bottom of a hand held Coke bottle.  It's overexposed, underexposed, jittery and flat.

I suppose there are some sadistic scenes in the last hour, if that appeals to your interests.  I signed off early and went outside to watch the grass grow, it was infinitely more interesting than this,  mate",1371686400,8,1220,4.665094339622642

4710592,3,B005IWG4ZK,"Snowtown (Justin Kurzel, 2012)

Given that director Justin Kurzel and screenwriter Shaun Grant were both making their feature-film debuts, Snowtown is a very impressive piece of work, a biopic that straddles the line between exploitation and education successfully, seems to have stuck close to the actual story based on what I've read (other than making Jamie Vlassakis more sympathetic), and wrung fine performances out of a cast that seems to have been aggressively recruited from among the world of non-professional actors. There are things that could have been done to make the movie better, but what we got is well worth your time as long as you can stomach some of the more brutal scenes (and even at its worst, Kurzel kept the bloodflow relatively light on this one; it is far more In Cold Blood than it is Wolf Creek).

Plot: Jamie Vlassakis (Lucas Pittaway in his screen debut--as is everyone listed in the summary without a credit) is twelve years old as we open. He describes a recurring dream he has; this is not a mentally stable individual. His mother Elizabeth (Louise Harris)'s boyfriend, one night when babysitting, convinces the boys to undress and have pictures taken of them, which leaks out into the community. Elizabeth is angry and, desiring revenge, turns to local in-the-know guy Barry (The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce's Richard Green), who introduces her to virulent, angry, charismatic anti-pedophile John Bunting (Not Suitable for Children's Daniel Henshall). Bunting, with the help of his friend Robert (Aaron Viergever), Jamie, and a few others from the neighborhood, start a campaign aimed at driving the boyfriend out of the neighborhood. While this is occurring, Jamie starts bonding with John, who starts seeming like the father figure Jamie never had, and Robert. John hangs around, stirring up the natives, getting involved with Elizabeth, and further befriending Jamie. And when John's tactics turn more violent, up to and including murder, John offers Jamie the chance to finish off someone whose crimes hit very close to home indeed.

In a reversal from my usual complaint about movies like this, it's the first half of the movie that worked for me--the slow part that shows how John Bunting not only ingratiated himself into a family, but into an entire neighborhood, many of whom were more than willing to condone his activities as time went on. Shaun Grant's examination of Bunting's infiltration of lower-class society, while less fact-based than the latter half of the film, is persuasive and thoughtful. Once the movie tries to get down to brass tacks, it seems almost as if Kurzel is trying to court broadcast television; I'm amazed the film was given an R when submitted for rating in America given how non-explicit it is, save a scene or two. This certainly doesn't make it not worth watching, but don't go into it expecting nastiness. ***",1366070400,2,2896,5.041753653444676

watch this movie if:

2. you have something between your two ears that you can use to fill in the gaps. everything isn't spelled out and handed to you.

4710597,2,B005IWG4ZK,"The Snowtown Murders is quite possibly one of the darkest, bleakest films I've ever seen, and I've seen alot of dark films. It is directed by Justin Kurzel and takes place in a low-income Adelaide Suburb called Salisbury North. It focuses on thoroughly cruel and unlikable characters interacting with and getting killed by even more cruel and unlikable characters, with a few exceptions. I understand this was a true story, but I don't understand why this film, and indeed films like it are made, which focus endlessly on the darker, more brutal side of humanity and leave little hope for light and comfort, and is a large part of the problem of much of modern western society. It had very strong language and one particularly brutal scene that I found hard to watch. This film is incredible bleak and almost nightmarish in it's quality. Many people claim that there needs to be more films like this that focus on ""reality"" but as Terry Gilliam once said, ""the world is a million possible things"". I think that there need to be less films like this and more that focus on the brighter, benevolent, side of humanity, and our full potential. Reality can indeed be very joyful and beautiful. The Snowtown Murders focus on two characters, teenage Jamie and adult John and how their relationship quickly takes a very dark turn when John and a friend of his begin murdering other people brutally. It was never particularly good to begin with, with John, who seems at first very amiable and charismatic, helps Jamie and his brothers to harass a pedophile neighbor who took indecent pictures of them. If the film has one strong point, it's that they only depicted the brutal murder of one of the victims, Jamie's half-brother. Other than that, this was a terrible, often boring, film that did not need to be made.",1357862400,3,1805,4.751592356687898

If you read THAT book, which will show just how horrifically WORSE these crimes were, in what we call ""Real Life"", it will certainly serve to prepare you for this film, which I think is very well done, over-all, especially considering just how evil, and monstrously cruel, and truly malevolent, this seeming unending series of murders were, and still are.

I agree with some of the other Reviewers here when they state that the ""normalness"", and everyday sense, and grinding regularity, of the area that these murders took place in, is as perfect a backdrop for what happens herein; as a masterful painter using the ""broad strokes"" of his background, behind whatever the focus of the painting becomes, as this director, with his very capable cast and crew; manage to make a portrait of these people, and their lives. Incidentally, most of the filming of this movie actually takes place where the murders really occurred, the director does a MORE than creditable job of doing just this. It is revealed in the accompanying ""extras"" of this film, that the director himself hails from just this area of Australia himself. This film unfolds in ever more perverse, and at times, yes, in actual gore, and horror, as John Justice Bunting, and his henchmen, one of them being Jamie Vlassasakis, the son, and a half brother of murder victim Troy Youde, and the son of Elizabeth Harvey, who becomes Bunting's lover, begin their reign of terror, and murderous carnality, which is in and of itself, one of the worst instances of serial killings that has occurred on ANY continent, and at ANY time in human history. That it went on for more than a decade, and the sheer totality of the ""chosen victims"", and the seeming incredulous reasoning for just ""why"" each victim was chosen, is MORE macabre, more dumbfounding, than any ""normal"" human being can remotely try to imagine. That BOTH the murderers, and their victim's, come from the same impoverished, and dead-ended neighborhood, is central to both the book, as well as this particular movie. When the murders occur, and thank heaven's, only ONE of them shows the graphic details of just how ruthless this band of murderers really were, it also shows some insight into just why the murders were allowed to go on, and add up, on the tote board; while the police nary gave it any notice at all. When the details of just how, and when, and who, was involved in these gruesome murders finally comes to light, it is almost anti-climatic, but not really. Told largely from Jamie's perspective, it shows just how John Bunting, in his unassuming, but very real magnetism to the people in his orbit; influences, and then becomes a central character, not only to Jamie, himself, or his Mother Elizabeth, but to his fellow neighborhood ""buddies"" who share John Bunting's twisted, and wholly malevolent code of behavior, and justice. The actor's are right on target here, and ALL of them are, in my opinion, letter-perfect in their portrayals, especially the young man who plays Jamie, the woman who plays Elizabeth Harvey, who loses TWO of her sons via her relationship with Bunting, they both are spot-on in their economic, and realistic depiction of their real life characters. Then there is the enormously underplayed character of John Justice Bunting himself, and his friends, that are so creepily, and aptly displayed, that you feel like you just really met them, somehow. The movie is unrelenting in it's depiction of just how degrading, and seemingly effortlessly, one can end another human being's life, and not feel much of anything at all, except the desire to continue on. And it does.........

THIS IS A TRUE HORROR STORY!

4710603,5,B005IWG4ZK,"I was surprised by several aspects to this movie.
First, and foremost, were the quite credible performances by all the actors, especially to that majority of actors who were regional recruits with little or no acting experience. Those unblinking stares became unnerving quite quickly. Kudos to you for portraying such challenging roles; also, as evidenced by the number of people disgusted with how well the hatred was presented. In the actual trial many jurors had to recuse themselves because of the nature of the violence.
Second, for the ""based on a true story"" accuracy - not perfect, but far better than most movie reenactments of ""true stories"".
Third, for the cinematography, music, sound ambience, directing and script writing (especially the dialogue).
A theme that existed in the background throughout the movie, beyond the hatreds expressed  toward gays and the mentally challenged and others, was how highly correlated low educational levels are with sustaining and promoting hatred. Something that has been historically apparent in ethnic, religious and state sponsored killing.

I don't think any kangaroos were killed for the movie. Possibly left over from the culling process as a result of the 'roo overpopulation damaging the environment?",1349827200,5,1257,5.408163265306122

4710612,3,B005IWG4ZK,"This is not a horror movie. It's far more frightening, if considerably less entertaining. It's not a suspense thriller; its agonizing tension comes from the dread of witnessing the inevitable.

I don't know whether to envy or pity the reviewers who found this ""boring,"" ""slow"" and ""dull.""  Since ""Silence of the Lambs,"" we've become slowly inured to the titillating entertainment value of the serial killer. (The current nadir is the incredibly bland, implausible and desensitized TV show ""Criminal Minds."")

""Snowtown,"" by contrast, feels horribly real. Killings happen not in stylized torture chambers but in the same dreary, downtrodden homes the rest of the movie takes place in. Nearly unbroken, subtly handheld camera shots take us from social backyard bonfire to bagged and barrelled corpses, from front porch on a balmy day to kill zone, with a documentarian's unblinking eye... as if murder is one more mundane thread in the fabric of everyday life. For John Bunting, it probably was.

The scariest thing about Daniel Henshall's Bunting is his chipper, everyman banality. Bunting was no loner. He recruited at least 3 others to help carry out his killings. The complaints about numerous peripheral characters drifting in and out of the narrative unannounced are valid, but these interactions show us Bunting's disarming camaraderie, moving him out of a loner's hovel and squarely onto the throne at Jonestown or overseeing Manson's commune. The consensus Bunting cheerfully bullies out of neighborly, impromptu kitchen-table tribunals (we've all been at one) becomes, in his mind, the razor-thin justification needed to act on his obsessions... and to groom accomplices.

Jamie is also a unique character in films (and real-life cases) such as this. The movie successfully forces us into a struggle of conscience over Jamie. We condemn his choices throughout, and we valiantly resist the special pleading of the Rousseauist, 'product of his environment' case for social determinism that ""Snowtown"" could be construed as arguing. Only long after the film was over did I find myself conceding that Jamie is a special case. He's not a serial killer himself, for whom nature vs. nurture wouldn't matter... psychopaths will be psychopaths. There IS something about his personality, about his victimhood, which multiple abusers sense opportunity in and exploit. And we can't help but notice it too... alongside Bunting, creepily enough.

The film chooses to exclude the cruellest and most horrific details of the real-life killings, which I only learned about after googling it online later. I for one am very grateful NOT to have endured their portrayal in this film. The details we do get are excruciating enough. Their necessary dilution (if not, who could bear to watch?) is not just an act of mercy, but part of the film's strategy: all sensationalism has been methodically drained from this account, leaving us no other option but to bear witness to the awful potentiality of human impulse.  I appreciate why, but this approach bound me in a moral dilemma for days after seeing ""Snowtown:"" SHOULD the film, by soft-pedaling the truth, allow us to care more about Jamie?

I never once felt sorry for Jamie Vlassakis. You could argue the film never asks us to. But ""Snowtown"" never holds Jamie accountable for his weakness of character, either. It starkly observes, but never evaluates, his pitiable lack of resistance. At a key turning point, Jamie is asked: ""Do you like to get [raped]?"" For a split second we're not sure the incident in question was rape or not, so passive was Jamie's endurance of the assault. The question itself feels like an assignation from a new abuser, and it is... in far worse ways than Jamie can fathom at the time. Bunting is the vampire invited across the threshold. I found Jamie's complicity just as disturbing and haunting as Bunting's sociopathy... and somehow, against all my instincts, I can't quite call that complicity indefensible.

Is it the film's achievement or its failure that I can't put into words what Jamie is or does? To me, his choices ultimately don't wash. Never mind that they actually happened (although many aspects of the true-life case remain sealed, and for all we know Vlassakis is a psychopath himself). They weren't just atrocious choices, they were hideous actions. They ended innocent people's lives in horrible ways, people that Jamie knew, sometimes at Jamie's own hand. The plot may want us to buy into a classic tragic arc... to believe Jamie is struggling inside more than his behavior belies, right up until a point in the film when a perfect opportunity for escape, rescue and salvation is decided against and squandered. But contrary to the script's possible intentions, we begin protesting Jamie's decisions before he is even a witness, let alone an accessory. And our questions keep piling up.

Why, Jamie? The answers aren't to be found either in the unfilmable truth or the euphemized ""Snowtown""... and perhaps there are none. Consequently, I thought at first that perhaps it would have been best if this story was left unfilmed (or at least unwatched!). In the end, what redeemed ""Snowtown"" for me (if not its characters) is how it re-injects serial murder with all the senseless ugliness it deserves. It's a sobering antidote to absurd modern antiheroes like Hannibal Lecter, whom yuppie audiences (financially insulated from real-life violence) relish as the ultimate arbiter of manners; or Dexter, the equally ridiculous ""serial killer with a conscience.""

John Bunting doesn't have a conscience. That's why he's a serial killer.  For all his public rants of righteousness, he never killed for justice. Bunting is (like most of his kind) a sadist who tortured for pleasure and preyed on the weak. His ""moral code"" is a pathetic attempt to justify his compulsions in his own mind. John Bunting killed more innocent people than anyone else in Australian history. ""Snowtown's"" Bunting leaves many of his wounded victims alive... Jamie; Jamie's family; and now us, the audience.",1345766400,58,6062,5.143147208121827

I can only agree to several points which have been raised before, chiefly among them the at times incomprehensible accents, and the publisher of this BR deemed wise not to include subtitles. Bravo.

8475178,5,B005IWG4ZK,"""The Snowtown Murders"" is a brilliant piece of filmmaking. Although the acting in the film is superb, the stars of the film are the cinematography and the musical score. The movie is beautiful to watch, which is a term you wouldn't associate with a film about real life murderers, but it truly captures the disturbing environment in which the characters reside quite perfectly. The score is excellently haunting and bizarrely compelling enhancing the fear, tension and horror that follows. Both the cinematography and the score set the wonderfully eerie and disturbing tone of the film.

The acting is incredible by everyone involved. However, the two standout performances go to the lead characters. Lucas Pittaway (resembling a young Heath Ledger) plays Jamie Vlassakis, a quiet 16-year-old who lives with his mother (played by Louise Harris) and three brothers. Jamie has been the victim of sexual abuse by not only a neighbor but by his older brother Troy (played by Anthony Groves). Jamie suffers in silence and passively allows the abuse until he meets the charismatic John Bunting. John takes Jamie under his wings and steps into the father figure role. John has his own horrific personal agenda which involves murder and he influences Jamie to partake in the gruesome crimes.

John is played sinisterly by Daniel Henshall (from the chilling horror film The Babadook). Henshall transforms himself into the diabolical and unsympathetic murderer making his presence in every scene unnerving and chilling. You fear him every time he speaks and every time he stares with such menace. Pittaways performance is equally powerful in a different manner. He plays Jamie in a quiet sympathetic way. Although hes a monster in the making, you are allowed to experience the fear and trauma of the character as he slowly goes from an innocent young boy into an accomplice in murder. Its Pittaways performance, however, that allows you to see his struggle within him as he matures to killer.

It takes patience to truly enjoy this film as it is more about the transformation and influence of a young murderer than it is about gratuitous gore. The film, however, is chilling and disturbing in the way that it realistically portrays the characters hate and desires. Although there are some scenes of unsettling torture, the film relies heavily on buildup to effectively make the audience uneasy to the point where you won't even want to witness the crimes performed.

This is definitely a truly remarkable true crime film in every aspect, from the beautiful cinematography to the haunting score to the flawless directing to the incredible acting. It really brings an unfortunate horrific real life event to life on the screen.",1495497600,,2715,5.09438202247191
