8672893,5,B00MKI679I,"This is not ""The Century 19012000"" but instead the 50s documentary.  Too my knowledge there has never been a proper DVD release.  Instead it can only be found from DVD traders or web dealers who specialize in obscure television.

Long before the History channel turned documentaries into light fluff there was, ""The Twentieth Century"".  ""The Twentieth Century"" is built from three components.  A vast library of first hand footage of the events in question, strong narration by Walter Cronkite, and a stupendous orchestral soundtrack composed by George Antheil.

Stylistically the show leans towards another strong 50s documentary, ""Victory at Sea"", often letting the images speak for themselves accompanied only by the music.",1502236800,,726,5.4375
