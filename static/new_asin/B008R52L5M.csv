5178774,3,B008R52L5M,"As a avid fan of horror movies, this one intrigued me when I spotted it in redbox dispenser - thought, hmm, maybe a new version of Island of Dr. Moreau; after watching it thru to the end just now, it felt like two movies pieced together - the first part is the slow going buidup where 5 friends - 2 couples and unpaired guy decide to go on a yachting trip to some resort location, the second part the stranding of all on an uncharted island after boat runs aground on reef and the subsequent horrific discovery and chase sequence.  While the first part of the movie was rather blase with some emotional tension created by the handsome badboy trying to now remain faithful to his current girlfriend and the unattached male eyeing the other shapely female who was being lotioned up by her tubby goofy rich boyfriend, the second half actually turned into a fairly decent survivor chase sequence along the lines of Arnold S' ""Predator"" movie (sans the heavy artillery);  the lead female (Jewel S. aka Liz) actually came into her own in the second part; too bad there were so many inconsistencies and illogical actions/convenient discoveries throughout the movie  (i.e. from the very first encounter (shortly after they are washed ashore during the day), the creastures were active both day and night, so the title is misleading; lo and behold, there's a yellow rubber liferaft lying on the beach (assumed to have washed ashore from sunken sailboat), handy machete stuck next to our heroine at just the right time, use of same during last scene to axe the only radio that is her only realistic way to be rescued, etc);  in summary, if they had shortened the first part and allowed some of the other characters to live longer during the second, working together with Liz, it could have been a decent movie.",1356048000,5,1800,4.686708860759493
5178775,2,B008R52L5M,"this movie to me was not that great, a B movie,the only thing going for it was Kellan Lutz. I'm glad he's moved up to better movies.",1354492800,,132,3.925925925925926
5178776,2,B008R52L5M,"This creature feature follows the formula for films of its kind: a couple of rich twentysomethings find themselves stranded in an unknown area where bloodthirsty creatures await to pick them off one by one. I'm not a huge fan of these types of movies, so it was tough for me to really get into this one. Overall the film itself is put together well and played out nicely, but it doesn't do enough differently for me to get me to change my thoughts on the genre.

5178777,2,B008R52L5M,"Ironic this was about a shipwreck, because that's exactly how I would describe it as a movie. The title was rather misleading, especially since 'they' came during the day as well. The movie spent way too much time on weak romantic character development and not enough time on suspense or scares - unless you are frightened by rustling leaves and shaking branches. Without the usual formula of naked women, gore, or scares to hold your attention, not sure what the intended purpose of this B-movie was. The whole thing seemed rushed, and frankly, I was in a hurry for it to be over as well.  The premise and appearance of the creatures ripped off Predator. And only because I actually loved Predator, I gave it two stars instead of just one.",1349481600,,740,4.648854961832061
5178778,1,B008R52L5M,"Sorry, sux. It's not funny (although the creature-makeup looks like leftovers from ORCS), it's not scary (how can anybody compare it to DESCENT [like the German bluray-backcover does?) but it's boring... 5 not very likable 20-somethings are stranded on an remote island, there are noises in the trees... and halt-eaten carcasses. ok, reads like a dozen other shaky-cam snooze-fests from the last months. what sets it apart? nothing. don't buy, don't rent...dont even look at the cover while browsing at blockbuster's.",1338336000,,517,5.395061728395062
5178779,5,B008R52L5M,"Came across this fun little film by coincidence and was pleasantly surprised. And since I am the biggest KL fan, I had to see it.
I like that its not too scary although the monsters are very cool.

Fun popcorn entertainment, nothing incredible but different in a good way.",1322611200,6,272,4.551020408163265
5178780,3,B008R52L5M,"If you've seen ""The Lost Tribe"" some parts of ""After Dark They Come"" aka ""The Forgotten Ones"" are going to seem very familiar. That's because ""The Lost Tribe"" is a remake of ""After Dark They Come,"" made the same year by the same producers but with a rewritten script and a different cast. If you've seen both movies you have to wonder why that decision was made. They are not that different in terms of quality. If anything, ADTC boasts greater star power than TLT, although it's possible the producers didn't know that at the time. Kellan Lutz of Twilight fame is the actor featured on the DVD covers, but his character is not the lead. Jewel Staite (""Firefly"") is the lead in this version of the story, and she's really good here. Definitely better than the material. The story is about four friends out yachting (as you do) who wind up stranded on a mysterious island, where they encounter a pod of the missing link. Violence ensues. Someone in charge of sound effects deserves props for a lot of truly disturbing crunching and smacking noises. The monsters are athletes in suits, and work better when barely glimpsed. Luckily the filmmakers don't linger on shots of them for too long, at least not until closer to the end. That ending (minor spoiler) is just ambiguous enough to satisfy both happy ending fans and downer ending fans.",1424822400,,1337,4.669491525423729
5178781,3,B008R52L5M,I agree with the other reviewer who gave some background on the re-make.  I have seen this same movie with different actors.  The goo had a camouflage color in the other movie.  Jewel is a good actress.  This was very forgettable.  You aren't missing anything.,1417305600,,260,4.688888888888889
5178782,4,B008R52L5M,"Four stars simply because Jewel Staite is in it. Otherwise, not a stand out.",1408924800,2,76,4.5

5178784,4,B008R52L5M,"A group of young adults, yachting, land on a remote island inhabited by monstrous cannibals led by an alpha male cannibal. Movie is entertaining and I cared about what  happened to each character. The movie is fast-paced and the ending was a surprise.",1401408000,,251,4.837209302325581
5178785,4,B008R52L5M,"So it would appear in any movie like this the males are cannon fodder and the ""bad"" girl is too. Does a guy ever survive? Anyway, I did like this movie and here comes the huge BUT....they killed everyone off too quickly and left the one girl, played gamely by Jewel Staite, to try to get the raft stolen by the evil cannibal big monkey looking guys. Silly...yes it is and having her wander in the woods on this deserted island for 20 minutes looking helpless was annoying....fast forward thru that. Justin Baldoni...the alpha male is very good, I did enjoy him while he lived, Kellan Lutz and his sidekick also very good. Then the 2 why? characters. The giggly girl who broke up with Kellan and is dating fat and hideous chicken boy, good riddance to both of them. Standard fare but I was entertained. But really, someone goes missing and leaves a trail of blood....are you going to find them in the thick, dark and dangerous woods? Not me.",1399420800,,940,4.502923976608187
5178786,4,B008R52L5M,"So, the story is that this film was so disliked by the producers that they reshot it with an entirely different cast , probably setting a record for the shortest duration between original and remake.  That would make you think it must be one of the worst movies ever, but it wouldn't even make the bottom 1000 in just the DVD Delirium books. It's not that bad, despite a raggedy script, lapses in logic, and endlessly repeated visual tropes from other horror movies.  As always, Jewel Staite rises above the material so much it makes you wonder if her whole career isn't some kind of crime (except for Firefly and SG:Atlantis, which gave her something to work with).  She almost single-handedly makes the second half of the film (by far the better half) work.  The creatures are interesting, if owing a bit too much to Predator-like cosmetics.  The 10 minute making-of featurette is worth a view, as well.  Don't expect too much - it's just a popcorn movie - but I thought it was better than 99% of what Sci-Fi airs.  BTW, this was the original British title; the US title was supposed to be The Tribe, I think.
  The film is anamorphic widescreen but much of it is very dark (at night, in caves, etc);  I suspect that the smaller the screen, the worse it looks.  Okay in a home theater.",1398384000,2,1287,4.504310344827586
5178787,2,B008R52L5M,"This movie was a real disappointment and is basically a remake of a movie called ""The Lost tribe""  which was a disappointment as well. In my opinion don't waste your time and money!",1370995200,2,181,4.484848484848484
5178788,5,B008R52L5M,"This movie will someday be a cult classic! It is terrific. I loved the Indian guy on the radio and the scene where Jewel Staite farts, that was a lot of fun for me, you don't usually see stuff like that in these movies. I wasn't really watching it for all the logical consistencies that everyone else is talking about.  The blow up doll on the boat and the music by MAMS TAYLOR (woo hoo) was really the icing on the cake!",1362268800,,421,4.134146341463414
5178789,2,B008R52L5M,"wouldn't play in my DVD players, so I rented it out of Red-Box . this movie was
just plain horrible. no more to say. and the seller, you should be out of business,
you didn't even want to refund my money back once I sent that piece of s*** back

8529849,4,B008R52L5M,After reading the reviews I was afraid to waste $ on this but I have to say that I genuinely liked this movie!  It made me jump a few times.  It is not a big Hollywood blockbuster but it is definitely worth the couple of dollars to rent it.  I also recommend watching The Lost Tribe after this movie as they go together.,1526601600,,320,4.0476190476190474

8529853,3,B008R52L5M,"I liked this since it was different.  SO tired of cannibals, zombies, etc.  It was a unique creature that the average lot of stranded people had to match wits with.  Jewel Staite (FireFly, Serenity) was pretty good as the overall star.  Purchased the movie on special and did not regret it.  Have watched it several times now and still enjoy it.",1488326400,,345,4.590163934426229
