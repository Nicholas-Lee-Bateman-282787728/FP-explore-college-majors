2836901,5,B000QEIOTE,"My husband was skeptical when I got these, thinking they wouldn't appeal to him. We all were laughing and even played them back to back. Thanks for showing a ""mans man"" that a movie doesn't have to be nonstop action to be entertaining.",1420761600,,235,4.488372093023256

2836907,5,B000QEIOTE,"Ben Stiller's best films....him and De Niro  are magic together....one to be loved, and one dared to be a classic I promise.....one to be added to any collection.",1409184000,,162,4.785714285714286

2836910,5,B000QEIOTE,"I laugh over and over in this one! Great writing...and Robert De Nero is a great set up man...to Ben Stillers act! Wow! The talent in this cast makes others look weak....I don't always buy Blu-ray...so this is a great value. Even my wife enjoys this romantic ,""yarn"". You will too. The extra features are fun and easy to go through...you will love Jessica Alba! When you watch the second disc in this set. Lots of extra stuff...I never go through yet...enjoy this purchase! I did!",1382054400,,480,4.593023255813954
2836911,5,B000QEIOTE,I love this movie. Even better as a package so you can watch both. Very happy with this movie! I would reccomend to anyone.,1379808000,,123,4.166666666666667
2836912,5,B000QEIOTE,I had seen these movies but they were still funny as viewed on my TV.  I may watch them again.,1370217600,,94,3.7
2836913,5,B000QEIOTE,"Ben Stiller, along with a great cast, make this two-part movie set a must see for everyone.  Adult humor is involved and may not be suitable for children.  The laughs keep coming though.  Ben Stiller is trying to get into his new father-in-laws ""circle of trust"", but is really bad at it until Ben learns a secret about his future father-in-law.  Later, Ben has his own circle of trust, and his now father-in-law must earn his way in.",1356566400,,434,4.5256410256410255
2836914,4,B000QEIOTE,"I didn't like the 3rd part. So I was glad they had part one and two available as a combo. DVD's are average quality. For the price they are fine. Extra features might as well be non-existent, so don't expect much there. Worth the money.",1348704000,3,236,4.266666666666667
2836915,5,B000QEIOTE,It came on time and had never been opened (very well packaged) . both movies were there and it was for a great price.,1346803200,,117,3.9166666666666665
2836916,5,B000QEIOTE,Loved it! Awesome package and it was cheaper to buy them together than even just one alone! Funny funny funny! Must see!,1343174400,,120,4.5
2836917,4,B000QEIOTE,These movies are great and funny but it is a great deal for the two movies at a low great price.,1336348800,,96,3.619047619047619
2836918,5,B000QEIOTE,"Love that the DVD is a two in one pack. Nothing to complain about. It didn't skip or anything. It's just a dvd though, so ... I guess that's about all I have to say about it.",1336089600,,174,3.72972972972973
2836919,1,B000QEIOTE,"How films like these gain such a devoted following is, quite simply, unfathomable to me. Why talented, heralded actors like Dustin Hoffman and Robert DeNiro choose to make films like this is even more unfathomable - Ishtar was Citizen Kane compared to either of these excreble excuses for entertainment. I saw both of these on the recommendation of people I'm close to; it's clear that, though I love them both dearly, their taste in movies and mine are very, very different. I haven't laughed so little since I saw Camille Claudel - but that won't mean much to most of you. Oh, well.",1326240000,,584,4.679611650485437
2836920,5,B000QEIOTE,"came as described. nice packaging. The actors & actresses are great in these movies.

2836922,5,B000QEIOTE,Purchasing both videos this way was definitely cost effective.  Walmart wanted $9.00 for just the first movie. Plus I don't have to store two movie cases.,1295136000,,154,4.923076923076923
8195901,2,B000QEIOTE,"Meet the Parents was fine. Meet the Fockers was a lot of skips- the disc did not have visible scratches but it sure wasn't smooth viewing- a fit of stops and starts. Sure the price is great but I would rather pay more for a little quality control. I would be giving one star but since it was only one disc that had the problem, I upgraded to two stars.",1523923200,,352,4.042857142857143
8195902,5,B000QEIOTE,Two incredibly funny movies. Definitely laugh worthy.,1521244800,,53,6.714285714285714

8195908,5,B000QEIOTE,"the first two in this series, cheaper to buy together than buy just ""Meet the Fockers"" alone, so I'll give away ""Meet the Parents"" so someone else can enjoy it!",1461024000,,160,4.366666666666666
