8420508,4,B004AMNMYA,"Govinda is, like always, dependable. Carrying off the role with elan, he proves yet again that there's so much talent that needs to be tapped. However, he needs to experiment with new roles since he has been seen enacting the same stuff over the years. Raveena Tandon performs very well. Johny Lever is fantastic. Shakti Kapoor is just about okay. Kader Khan is competent once again.
On the whole, AKHIYON SE GOLI MAARE is an average fare all the way. However, its reasonable price may prove beneficial for its distributors.",1302220800,,524,4.833333333333333
