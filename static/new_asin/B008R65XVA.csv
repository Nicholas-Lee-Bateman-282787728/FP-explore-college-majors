5178878,4,B008R65XVA,The first one remains the best.  Happens most of the time I know but it doesn't mean it isn't true.  Dropped to four stars due to the second Death Race movie.,1486080000,,158,4.064516129032258

5178883,5,B008R65XVA,"This is another of those standard annoying double-pack releases, complete with hollow recycle logo thin, breakable amaray case. There's not much to say to this extent, but when it comes to the films, they are an absolute must-see. Both are the unrated editions, and there are no digital copies included. With that being said, they are definitely entertaining, and the performances by both Statham and Luke Goss are great. At the time of writing, this double feature is $7, but at time of purchase it was $6, which I would recommend for the price.",1473811200,,546,4.819148936170213

5178888,1,B008R65XVA,Great movie. I already had the DVD version but wanted the blu ray DVDs. The 1st one. The case was broken. Returned it. The 2nd one .... DEATH RACE 2 would not play. Very disappointed. Don't waste your time.,1455321600,,206,4.3076923076923075
5178889,5,B008R65XVA,"The order of this series is a little off. Death race 1 is set after the 3rd movie. 2 and 3 are direct sequels. I really enjoyed this series. It has a fast and furious meets prison break feel to the story. Jason Statham is as brilliant as ever. The supporting cast is interesting and the movie has a good flow to it. It doesn't feel like the story was sacrificed for more action. These movies can be watched in either order. 1,2,3 or 2,3,1.",1452297600,,439,4.176470588235294

5178892,3,B008R65XVA,I bought this set because I thought Jason Statham was in both movies but he was only in the first one. The movies were good but was still disappointed that it wasn't what I thought it was going to be.,1443484800,,200,4.025
5178893,5,B008R65XVA,Excellent aaaaaaaaaa,1442275200,,20,9.5
5178894,5,B008R65XVA,I had doubts about how great this series would be and I was very surprised how great they turned out to be.  Jason Statham is one of my favorite actors and he didn't disappoint.  Have never heard of Luke Goss but he was fantastic in his role.,1439856000,,242,4.127659574468085

5178903,5,B008R65XVA,these two shows are full of action pack scence that make the movies excellent to watch enjoy a good bowl of popcorn and a drink while you watch.,1398556800,,144,4.178571428571429
5178904,5,B008R65XVA,"Two under-rated but excellent action movies (that, BTW, have excellent soundtracks by Paul Haslinger (ex-Tangerine Dream) and Celldweller, respectively). Minimal extras but that's a-okay with me. For some reason the studios seem to think that people want to pay more for all kinds of ""extra content"", but not me: I just want the movie. This seems to work in my favor, as there are a number of really awesome blu ray compilations containing 2 or 3 or 4 movies that are selling for dirt cheap.

I know that lots of people roll their eyes at the very mention of Paul W.S. Anderson, but the production design, the soundtrack, the writing, and especially the cast (which includes Jason Statham, Joan Allen, Ian McShane, Luke Goss, Sean Bean, Fred Koehler, Danny Trejo, and Ving Rhames, who all turn in top-form performances) all come together in these movies. This is a must-have for anyone who likes action movies. And - unlike that dusty copy of _The Social Network_ that you bought because everyone convinced you it was so good - you *will* watch _Death Race_ more than once.",1381708800,4,1073,4.8

8529960,5,B008R65XVA,"This might BE a, standard, double-feature re-packaging in a ""shot-gun-recycle-logo"", thin, case. As usual, I put them in a BETTER
Amray case... with #3. ALL three're the unrated editions. Statham and Luke Goss are great... as are the supporting cast/crew.

This IS on the quality-level with FAST'n'FURIOUS 1-10, it's just THREE. Hope there's three more. MIGHT be hope... there WERE
S-I-X Three Stooges, right? I didn't notice any eye-pokes, and nobody dropped their soap... always a possibility in a prison-flick!

Great car chases, eh?",1494028800,,536,5.369047619047619
