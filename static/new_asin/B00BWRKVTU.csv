5679403,5,B00BWRKVTU,Great price at 2 for 1.  Enjoyable films that are great for the whole family.  Getting both for such a low price makes it even better.,1373760000,,134,4.115384615384615
5679404,5,B00BWRKVTU,Good entertainment. enjoyed all of the voices especially fr Guido Sarducci. I do not know his real name but enjoyed it tremendously.,1373587200,,132,5.045454545454546
5679405,5,B00BWRKVTU,"This is a very unique film from the Disney features canon. It was overshadowed by 'Shrek' back in 2001, and many fans of Disney animation gave a pass on it. However, it is a great popcorn adventure flick without all the songs, and it was good to see Disney be brave enough to try something different. I loved it, and I rank it up there as one of their most underrated films.",1373155200,,374,4.208333333333333
5679406,5,B00BWRKVTU,"The visuals are awesome , and even though the story might need a bit more polish because it is a bit preachy , it gives us nostalgia of when we saw old fashion adventure movies , love it.",1373155200,5,187,3.9473684210526314
5679407,4,B00BWRKVTU,I am so glad they finally came out with a Blu-ray with both of the two Atlantis movies my whole family enjoys the movie in my VHS tape was about to wear out it was shipped in a timely manner and Amazon adjusted the price downward because I had purchased it before was released I have bought several DVDs and Blu-ray's through Amazon it has all been easy and problem free in the prices are much less than they are in the store,1372636800,,425,4.132530120481928
5679408,5,B00BWRKVTU,I love that now you can have both movies in the same case for a great low price. My only wish is that they would stop stacking the dvds on top of each other in the case.,1372204800,,169,3.5945945945945947
5679409,4,B00BWRKVTU,"Disney makes me a very happy man by releasing ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" and ""Atlantis: Milo's Return"" on Blu-ray. The 3-Disc Special Edition includes both movies on a single Blu-ray and separately on regular DVDs. Recognized as Walt Disney Feature Animation's first science fiction film, it underperformed at the box office despite good word-of-mouth from audiences. An extended life on video and DVD has garnered it as one of Disney's most overlooked gems of a bygone era.

In ""Atlantis: The Lost World,"" historian Milo Thatch leads a crew of the world's greatest archaeologists and explorers in a search for the lost city of Atlantis. They travel through the depths of the dangerous sea aboard the submarine Ulysses. Only expecting to unearth ruins and artifacts, the team is astonished to find the ancient city still thriving with life.

This is one of my all-time favorite animated Disney features. It's a masterful blend of Jules Verne's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" is an adventure tale mixed with everything you could ever want in a fantasy film. There are elements of science fiction, mythology, and mystery all combined to form a highly exciting and entertaining tale.

Steampunk fans will find something to enjoy in the film, as well. All sorts of interesting advanced mechanical technology appear that shouldn't exist in the early 1900s. It has a ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" vibe to it as well, which isn't surprising since comic book artist Mike Mignola was one of the production designers for the movie.

The reformed crew from the first film returns to the ancient underwater city and recruit Milo and Kida to help them battle a sea monster in ""Atlantis: Milo's Return."" The two are eager to return to their world, but keep getting drawn into different adventures by eccentric Preston B. Moore. They find themselves going up against vicious coyote specters, a vengeful spirit, and a madman who believes he's the god Odin.

""Atlantis: Milo's Return"" suffers from being a compilation of the three episodes finished for a television series which was scrapped after the first movie didn't perform as well as Disney expected. They're interesting yarns somehow all connected to Atlantis. Ultimately, they fall short of living up to the greatness of their predecessor.

The animation for ""Atlantis: Milo's Return"" is way below that of ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire."" It resembles the Hanna-Barbera cartoons from the late 1990s / early 2000s, which isn't bad. It's just not what you expect from Disney. The different episodes reduce Milo, Atlantean Kida, and the rest of the rehabilitated mercenaries from the first movie to a sort of ""Scooby-Doo"" gang of mystery solvers.

Both films are presented in 1080p High Definition (2.35:1) and feature 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. While ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" shines brightly from its upgrade, ""Atlantis: Milo's Return"" suffers because more of its flaws are obvious thanks to the HD clarity. That's not to say it's not better to see it this way. Just don't expect the sequel to look as good as the original. The 5.1 surround sound will thrill home viewers with a barrage of great sound effects accompanied by James Newton Howard's powerful musical score in the original movie.

An adequate amount of special features can be found inside this release. Audio commentary is provided for ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" by Producer Don Hahn and directors Gary Trousdale, and Kirk Wise. An hour long documentary entitled ""The Making of 'Atlantis'"" is included. Two short featurettes, ""How to Speak Atlantean"" and ""Atlantis: Fact or Fiction?,"" are here as well. Deleted scenes for ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" are also featured. Three ""Atlantis: Lost Empire"" trailers round out the bonus material for the first film. The one extra for ""Atlantis: Milo's Return"" consists of a deleted scene.

Any fan of hand-drawn animation and Jules Verne will love the blend of science fiction, action, and fantasy you'll get from ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire."" It's definitely worthy of its title as a cult classic. ""Atlantis: Milo's Return"" is a nice added bonus to an already strong Disney Blu-ray premiere.",1372118400,43,4210,5.116448326055313
5679410,4,B00BWRKVTU,"But still a fine entry in the Disney canon! I will admit I am slightly biased as this was one of the few Disney movies I actually got to grow up with and also one of the few from childhood I saw in theaters originally. Really, the biggest issue is characterization. Audrey Ramirez has to be one of animated film's most annoying characters ever created. That aside, a great movie with a great message and several funny moments. This new Blu-ray release is most certainly up to the standards of Disney excellence consumers have come to expect. The surround sound is a phenom! I was quite frequently blown away with my tiny home theater system! Whether you're picking it up for the kiddies or for yourself or if you're just a Disney collector, this title will find an easy spot on your book shelf.",1371772800,,794,4.520833333333333
5679411,3,B00BWRKVTU,"Atlantis The Lost Empire was one of Disney's greatest movies. But part 2 Milo's Return? Oh my goodness, that movie is hideous. Not sure why they gave this film the green light. I am glad they brought back the voices of the supporting cast but the person playing Milo was AWFUL. Michael J Fox as Milo was much needed. It was not written well and even the animation was bad.",1371081600,9,372,4.328571428571428
5679412,3,B00BWRKVTU,"Atlantis is an interesting Disney movie aiming for a more mature direction with its darker themes and violence. But at the same time you still have the more childish elements, such as the character of Mole to counter-balance. It's a new direction and whilst the story is an old cliche of sorts it does have some good stuff. The animation is extremely well done, the characters (minus the incredibly obvious villains) are interesting with some good back-stories and sympathetic traits. Score-wise it's a mixed win. Some people hate this movie and state its one of Disney's weakest, considering what came before this and after, it's good, not great. So Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a good Disney flick with some stellar set pieces, good characters and eccentric performances. 7.5/10

The same cannot be said for the cheap knock-off sequel Milo's return. The animation is terrible and paper thin. It's not even a whole movie but more like three TV episodes mingled together to establish a run time with a vague theme of Atlantean artifacts somehow tying them together. Other Disney seqeuls are worse, much worse and offensive, Hunchback 2, Beauty and the Beast's midquels and so on but it's still not good. It's just a cheap movie made for some extra bucks and everything in it is significantly duller. It has some OK moments, mainly lying in brief moments in the first two, the third of the three being absolutely trite. 2/10

My advice is if you want Atlantis on blu-ray, just get the original and forget this atrocious sequel ever happened.",1364774400,33,1540,4.874045801526718
5679413,1,B00BWRKVTU,"Somehow I overlooked this Disney when it came out. Now I wish I had. It is the poorest story-wise and execution of any Disney opus. I will admit I did not finish it but was well into it and do not see how any further  wasted minutes could  redeem it. L Maltin gave it 3 stars and said it got a bum deal from theatrical release. I don't think so, and think maybe the paying audience was more discerning than we generally give credit. The quality of animation almost approaches the Saturday Morning cartoons yet is a slight cut above this low standard. The only thing going for it is the sound. Nice surround with explosions aplenty. The second movie is a direct to video and may be a masterpiece but I won't waste my time to find out.",1515974400,,733,4.266187050359712

5679415,5,B00BWRKVTU,"This movie to me is to be the most underrated movie of all times, but alas it didn't get the right propagenda and publicity. To me this movie is at the same level with the other Disney classics like: snow white and the seven dwarfs, Cinderella, sleeping beauty, the little mermaid...etc.",1506297600,,287,4.647058823529412

5679433,4,B00BWRKVTU,Some good humor and high quality visuals. The second movie is pretty boring.,1477008000,,76,4.923076923076923
5679434,5,B00BWRKVTU,"Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a wonderful family friendly movie. The Characters are unique, while not being overwhelming. The Movie has great values, some awesome lessons and some vague adult humor, with the Character ""Mole"". It teaches some great lessons about Culture, and how entire civilizations can be damaged or even wholly wiped out, because of the monetization of certain things. It is also one of the first times I can think that it gives a strong female leads. And for these reasons I give Atlantis the Lost Empire five stars.

However Atlantis: Milo's Return is not as great. Milo's Return came out during a time where Disney was making a lot Direct to Dvd Sequels to some of their Movies. Atlantis almost came out unharmed, because Milo's Return was intended to be a television series instead of the direct to dvd sequel that we got. The Animation quality plummeted, and the story is only vaguely coherent, barely put together, clearly in a rush to push this out onto the market. It is still though, a funny movie and if in a pinch to have your children just simply watch something, this will do.

I recommend this highly product. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",1476057600,,1178,4.741463414634146

When that horrible commander and his forces took it away, I was glad that Milo chose to go after him!

While not a hit at the box office, this shouldn't keep animation fans away as this is really a very solid film, but because the studio had a few commercial duds during this period, the studio decided to close its hand drawn department and make way for CGI. It's not for lack of invention that this one isn't remembered, but I guess the characters aren't all that memorable even is the story is.

The 3 disc Blu Ray combo is a bit misleading in that it is one Blu Ray disc and two DVD's. The good news is the Blu Ray transfer is flawless! It looks and sounds amazing.  There are a good amount of bonus features carried over from the previous 2 disc DVD release including a 2 hour making of the film feature and it also includes the sequel.

The bad news is we do lose quite a few bonus features from the 2 disc collector's DVD set  that was released a few years back which was loaded with great bonues. Depending on how much you like this film will determine if you want to upgrade and keep the DVD set for the bonus features or not.

5679494,4,B00BWRKVTU,"This is one of my favorite Disney movies, it is very different from the others. The story is great. However, Milos Return is one of the worst Disney movies as it is three tv show episodes mashed together, with terrible plots.

On a side note I was quite disappointed that the blu Ray did not come with a cardboard slipcover.

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good adventure.",1387238400,,388,4.450704225352113

I haven't watched ""The Return"" yet, but I understand it is a collection of made-for-TV-series episodes, loosely stitched into a sequel movie.",1380672000,,387,4.5

5679503,4,B00BWRKVTU,"Just like Milo, I've been fascinated by the tales of Atlantis since I was a child, so I felt like I had to see this. The first movie, we have an archeologist named Milo who is determined to prove that Atlantis exists. It feels a little like an Indiana Jones movie due to the archeology and fights you see throughout it. You get epic and touching moments, especially during the opening and ending of the movie. went in a different direction than past Disney movies because there isn't a single moment where the characters sing, but you do get very good music throughout the movie.

If you're wondering why I'm only giving the Blu-Ray set 4 out of 5 stars, the reason for this is because of the 2nd ""movie"" on it. The 2nd movie is made up of 3 different stories like the horrific Cinderella II is, and we all know how poorly that did. It was made only as an attempt for Disney to try making a TV series which this failed at.

If you do decide to buy the Blu-Ray, just watch the Lost Empire movie and skip the Milo's Return.

You do get some cool bonus features on this set such as Deleted Scenes, the Making of Atlantis, a 10-12 minute video that teaches you how to speak Atlantean, and a video that talks about if Atlantis is really fact or fiction.

Anyway, I'm glad I bought it, and I hope everyone else that buys it enjoys it as much as I do.",1377993600,4,1344,4.217898832684825

5679509,4,B00BWRKVTU,"I really enjoyed Atlantis, but Milo's Return is a definite straight to video sequel. The difference in the quality of the animation is striking. However, the transfers are pristine, the sound is well done, and the supplements are quite adequate. The four stars reflect the weakness of the sequel, otherwise, this would have been a five stars review.",1376524800,,349,5.0344827586206895
5679510,5,B00BWRKVTU,"Great film; the animation has its own style, some enjoy it, and others, seemingly a hefty sum, don't seem to grasp the loving care this film was given, in all aspects.

Oh well, we can cry another day. It would be truthful in saying that the movie at least ranks with Disney's better animation films, and is nowhere near as bad as some of the libel on this site. It is quite possibly no more disconnected than ALL of the so called Classics, and though it may not top something such as Aladdin or Lady and the Tramp, it's better than so many of the other films script wise. The cubist style animation in particular reminds me of a lovely comic book.

The creators brought aboard famed comic illustrator Mike Mignola as visual designer and consultant. The script and the comic book style fit together SO WELL in this film... I truly adore the jaggy edges and slightly disconnected elements as they are presented in the full painstaking package, Directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, (responsible for Beauty and the Beast and The Hunchback of Notre Dame) and from a story conceived by Tab Murphy of Hunchback fame. The entire experience is totally backed up by professionals, and should be acknowledged as four stars for that reason alone, in that they succeed in what they set out to do, and quite well compared to what Pixar and Ghibli present these days.

Atlantis is a journey where nothing gets in the way that cannot be solved, logically or not, but it leaves the viewer optimistic with wonder and not unjustly imbibed with gimmicks or nonsense. Atlantis is a sensational experience like Hunchback or Howl's Moving Castle, and though it is not quite to that level, it's close. Watching the movie in darkness and headphones provides ample testimony to my claim. Although many things are not realistic nor completely immersive, what Disney film is also not in the same vein? They all have a flaw or two. It is just nitpicking of the naysayers that would have it the other way....

I also must note that the enemies and other antagonists are quite fearsome even sinister, much more so than the majority of Disney's catalogue. I was very convinced of imminent danger in the first few chapters, going into the sea with the crustacean machine violently raging after the crew. The stereo effects and symphonic overlay are quite gorgeous during this sequence and many more throughout; the ending, the firefly sequence, and the descent all being memorable.

With nice headphones and an amp, you really appreciate what went into the sound design, and it is obvious that is was a process carefully looked over and appraised, because it stands among Disney's best.

I for one, appreciate quirky misunderstood characters like the Hunchback, and to make a point, that is the film I most compare this one too. Each is very much a masterpiece in its own right. And this is proven in the finale that is one of the most memorable in recent memory, if a little cliche, it has its parting shot up there in beauty with Pride Rock. Exhilarating, to say the least, if you have the imagination.

Also, the sardonic and sometimes sexual humor is quite natural and amusing... you might find yourself saying, 'Wow, didn't quite expect that out of this', and that is what it comes down to in the end: this movie is full of good surprises, and as one of the few traditional movies left I think we should applaud that aspect.

The Bluray is completely beautiful and worth your time. Comes with some extra episodes as sequels and a bunch of good info about the film and the process of its making. All the line art seems to be intact. Sharp as heck too. Huge upgrade from DVD.",1376006400,13,3651,4.649612403100775

8574791,4,B00BWRKVTU,"First i would like to say I bought this on sale for $9.96.  I have not watched the DVD parts of this, but I can say the first Atlantis movie and it's not so good sequel look just as good on Blu-ray as I remember them on VHS (it's been 10 or so years since I saw the VHS version of both movies, but I do remember they looked good even back then.)  The only reason why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the missed opportunity, which is Atlantis 2: Milo's Return.  The first movie is good, but the second is... well... a huge leap backwards in story, character, and background animation.

Either way I felt like I received a good deal on a movie that I haven't seen in a long time.

Also if you are in the Disney Movie Rewards club you will only get 150 points for this bundle instead of receiving 150 points per movie like what happens sometimes.",1518825600,3,853,4.053571428571429
