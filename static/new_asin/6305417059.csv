7889266,3,6305417059,"You have to be in the right frame of mind to get a chuckle out of ""The Three Stooges"" as advanced techniques have raised expectations, but if you can transport yourself back in time, some of the routines are still cute. ""Malice in the Palace"" is the best on this DVD. It's based on misunderstanding and inaccurate assumptions, like most Stooge pieces are.

""Disorder in the Court"" plays on another recurring Stooge theme, that of taking yourself and life too seriously. In the end the hapless baffoons save the day. It isn't as well written as ""Malice,"" but is still an interesting piece to look at in terms of representing  comedy of the era.",1113091200,5,643,4.631578947368421
7889267,5,6305417059,"disorder in the court is, in my opinion one of the great stooge shorts. Curly causes all kinds of havok when the judge tells him to take off his hat and lay his right hand on the Bible at the same time. Lary and Moe  playing tic tac oe on the back of a lawyer's shirt with chalk is not to be  missed. This is when the Three Stooges were original and unique, and you  can now wath it on DVD",962755200,,389,3.7777777777777777
