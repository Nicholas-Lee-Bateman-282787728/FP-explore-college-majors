136366,5,0792165039,"Again, It proves once again that the Academy Awards is biased and conservative. Both Anthony Minghella and Matt Damon deserve a Best Director and Best Actor award and also the Best Film award. But the Academy Awards  tried to avoid this film just because of its senstive, homosexual content.  Disappointing, isn't it?
It is a movie of perfection, the script, the  direction, the acting, the music, the costume design, the cinematography,  the production design are all of very high standard. I have watched it for  three times but still eager to watch it. I rate it 9.5 out of 10. Bravo!",957571200,6,587,4.772277227722772
136367,5,0792165039,"Let's get to the technical wizardry first.  This film has a ""look"" that sets it apart from every other film released in 1999.  The cinematography makes the locations, as well as the cast, look  picture-perfect.  I don't think there is any bad lighting, unnecessary  shadows, incomplete scenes, or choppy angles to be found in any frame of  this film.  A treat for the eyes is TTMR!
Gabriel Yared's score is  magnificent.  It is subtle yet ominous at the same time.  Reminiscent of  the best work of Herrmann, Yared never overpowers a scene.  The music  effectively supports every machination of the title character in his  efforts to fulfill his perceived ""destiny.""
As for the acting,  Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchet display the guiet elegance that has  garnered them award-winning aclaim.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman shows why he  is a actor to reckon with.  Jude Law is mesmerizing as the object of  Ripley's obsession.
And Matt Damon?  He took a gamble in taking the role  of this most sinister character.  He pulls it off, magnificently.  Ripley  is never one to which the audience will sympathize, but he will not be  condemned either.  Matt Damon as Ripley is like the Pied Piper.  He is  leading us, as well as the on-screen characters, down the path that HE  intends us to follow.
Thus, final praise should be heaped upon Anthony  Maghella for putting this excellent film together.  He is the artisan who  took Patricia Highsmith's literary classic, added his own touches, and made  a magnificent film.
Great is the Talented MR. MANGHELA!",957052800,6,1547,4.891050583657588
136368,5,0792165039,"This Movie is a masterpiece!. One of my Top 10 of All time. Matt Damon is excellent as Tom Ripley a poor man who wants to take over the Life of Dickie Greenleaf{ An Excellent Jude Law}.
The Supporting cast Was Also  Excellent! Gwetheyn Paltrow in an Oscar deserving performance is so  Wonderful. Cate Blanchett  is wonderful as well.
I have only 1 complaint  of TMR is the awful Singing by Matt Damon and Jude Law{ it was VERY  BAD! }  This was look over at the Oscars but this is  the Best movie Of  the Year.
Hats off to Anthony Mingalla for brining us a modern day  masterpiece!

136369,4,0792165039,"If self esteem were measured on a circular scale, Tom Ripley would be constantly flickering between zero and extreme arrogance. He is confident in his abilities as a deciever, but can't trust himself as a human  being.
  Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr. Ripley is a near  masterpiece. The first 30 minutes of this film are slow going, with the  beautiful scenery and an enigmatic performance by Jude Law just about  holding our attention. Then Minghella raises the stakes by introducing some  edgy homoerotic scenes that hieghten the dramatic tension, then the  shocking first murder takes place, and its at this point that the film  develops into a taught phsycological study of a man who ""would rather  be a fake somebody then a real nobody"". Much like Matt Damon's superb  and subtle central performance, this film is slow to reveal itself. I  haven't given away any spoilers here, this much is available from the  film's ads.
  The flaw in The Talented Mr. Riply is that the audience's  sympathy for the Tom is limited. His loneliness is never as compelling as  say Travis Bickle's was in Taxi Driver. The audience I saw it with seemed  to treat him more like a colorful sociopath then a damaged human being. But  thankfully Damon does give Ripley that necessary added dimension in two key  places. One is on the boat, the other is in the harrowing final scene. In  those scenes his pain is almost unbearable.
  The English Patient which  is perhaps the best romantic film of the 1990s is definitly a hard act to  follow. It is interesting that Mingella has chosen something completely  different this time. The result is a fascinating and gripping film, but its  also one that is easier to admire than to love.",956707200,6,1719,4.778156996587031

136371,5,0792165039,"Highsmith's characters are one-dimentional and flat.  Minghella brings forth new light and beauty into the world of Dickie Greenleaf and Tom Ripley.  Minghella adds new characters that make the plot more involved and  inspiring, while Highsmith's Ripley drags on without much plot.  Minghella  takes Highsmith's most engaging and wonderous character and makes it go,  while Highsmith's world of Ripley sat dead in the water.  (No pun intended)  This is one of the few cases where the movie is better than the book.  Make Ripley work for you, in the vivid and alive version of the story.",956188800,3,586,5.020833333333333

Well, change the word 'hilarious' to 'suspenseful' and thats basically the jist of the last half of this dreadful movie. Initially  the slow decent into evil is interesting and the cast holds up.  Unfortunately the plot is as manipulative as any hollywood junk and before  you know it you're being led through 2 hours of the ups and downs of  predictable murders and narrow escapes. There's not really much reason to  like anyone in this besides Phillip Seymour Hoffman's smarmy side  character.

Jude Law was nominated for an Oscar for his role in The Talented Mr. Ripley; Matt Damon was not. To this day, I think there was a mistake while submitting the for your consideration names to the Academy. Jude Law wasn't really given anything to do in the film, besides look incredibly handsome and emit an aura of appeal. Matt Damon, the title character, gave a tour-de-force performance deserving of a winthe only way to explain his lack of a nomination is if there was a mistake.

Matt Damon plays a very troubled young man who longs for attention, acceptance, and love. He doesnt feel those things when hes himself; the only way he feels complete and alive is when he pretends to be someone else. For example, he borrows a fancy dinner jacket and attends a party, someone mistakes him for a well-to-do Princeton graduate, and he transforms into the man hes thought to be. He enjoys his disguise and likes it infinitely better than his own skin. The subtleties Matt Damon brings to his performance are breathtaking. A lesser actor would have played the part differently, and the filmdespite Anthony Minghellas beautiful directing and Gabriel Yareds intense musicwould have felt a little cheap. Matt Damon truly becomes Mr. Ripley, just as convincingly as Mr. Ripley becomes other people. You can see every reason behind his behavior clearly on his face, and every hurt, shame, doubt, and fear is communicated delicately between him and the camera. Its an incredible performance.

A host of familiar faces join the supporting cast, including Cate Blanchett, James Rebhorn, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Philip Baker Hall, Jack Davenport, Celia Weston, and Gwyneth Paltrow, as Jude Laws girlfriend. Ive always felt Gwyneth to be exceptionally talented at blending into her roles. Shes just as convincing in Emma as she is in Shallow Hal, and in this film, she seems completely at home in her 1950s surroundings.

Depending on how dark you like your movies, you might hate The Talented Mr. Ripley or you might add it to your collection to watch on dark, spooky evenings. Ive seen it twice, because I love films with fantastic acting in them. Just be aware it isn't for the faint of heart, and there are some pretty upsetting scenes in it.

136385,3,0792165039,"If you have never seen this movie before, see it.  The cast delivers, the music elevates and frames scenes seamlessly, the background of Italian vistas only enrich the period in which it's all set, and the cinematography embraces and shakes its action skillfully.

The special features alone could warrant a purchase of this blu-ray -- including cast interviews, a 22-minute behind-the-scenes documentary, and ""making-of"" the soundtrack featurette.  The director commentary is among the most heartfelt and thorough I've ever heard.  Anthony Minghella discusses every aspect mentioned above and then some, and his low library whisper tone soothes and informs.

The only detractor is the film does tend to lose some plausibility and basic linear sense in subsequent viewings -- in my experience anyway.  I would never discourage anyone from seeing this film, but I don't think I ever need to see it again after revisiting it recently.",1509321600,,932,5.3061224489795915

136387,4,0792165039,"A small-scale imposter / con man, making the rounds in 1950s New York, gets caught up in something much greater than his usual scam and decides to let it ride, if just to see where he winds up. In this case the answer is Italy, gorgeous vestige of the old world with just a few hints of the modern one, where he's tasked with convincing a flippant trust funder to return from a perpetual, fortune-draining holiday. That mission quickly goes by the wayside, just as soon as he realizes how much easier life is in the lap of luxury, and he merely exacerbates said money-letting as the wealthy playboy's new wingman. When things take a turn for the messy, though, his welcome worn thin and nothing to show for it but bittersweet memories, a panicked string of responses sends the entire comfortable lifestyle into a tailspin. At its root, Ripley is an example of how fear and rejection can press a normally smart, affable person over the brink into monstrosity, a surprise considering the playful tone of the first act. Matt Damon, still fresh from his breakout in 1997's Good Will Hunting, shows great versatility in the leading role (essential for such a complicated character), smoothly masking that twitch in his eye from all but the viewing audience. It's one of those films where you'll feel wrong about your rooting interest, knowing all along that the guy absolutely does not deserve a happy ending, with the final moments serving as your comeuppance.",1507593600,2,1456,4.781746031746032

136406,5,0792165039,"Patricia Highsmith's novel was a daring highwire act that screenwriter and director Anthony Minghella dares not try to emulate, and perhaps, with the much more immediate medium of film, that was the right choice. The movie is ""inspired"" by Highsmith's book, but definitely not her book. Highsmith's Tom Ripley is a serial killer that the reader somehow manages to feel sorry for, given his lowly past and all consuming self-hatred, his desire to immolate himself and become someone else. To do this, he kills his friend Dickie Greenleaf, a handsome and wealthy but moody and jerkish young man who lives off his trust fund in Italy. He then takes over Dickie's identity.

In the movie, this is done on a boat (as it is in the book) but almost as an act of self-defense. Dickie, whom Ripley (who is a closeted homosexual at a time when it wasn't wise to be anything but closeted) has grown to love. When Dickie rejects him, and tells him he's going to marry Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) and leans over him with his fists in the air, Ripley commits a crime of passion, or even may have done it out of fear. In the book, it's calculated and planned, though still done as an act of rebellion after Dickie rejects him.

Minghella seemed to feel he couldn't have a protagonist with THAT much of a sociopathic nature, so made him a man who seems to utterly regret his impulsive act, even to the point of trying to help Dickie before Dickie begins to attack him. At the end, Ripley has to kill again, and again he's devastated by it. This is not Highsmith's character.

That said, if you can look at the movie not as an adaptation but a stand alone movie, it is a very good one, with excellent acting and luscious scenery. Matt Damon apparently got some bad reviews when this came out, but I don't know why. I found him the perfect Ripley - with his boyish innocent face and nervous demeanor, who would suspect him of murder? The Ripley of the book isn't suave, and neither is Damon. He should have gotten more credit for his performance.

Paltrow and Jude Law are fine as the patrician expats, with their pale skin, blonde hair, and money. Paltrow lends the right amount of the dorkishness of Highsmith's character, and adds her own suspicion. Law is Dickie as he is in the book - a charismatic charmer who can turn on you in an instant. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the lout overweight garish American pal Freddie Miles, who has his suspicions too, perfectly.",1492905600,7,2447,4.567198177676538

Who knows what other masterpieces he would have given us?  From the superb cast, script, scenery and cinematography, The Talented Mr. Ripley doesn't put a foot wrong.  Jude Law and Matt Damon are at their most handsome and magnetic, Gwyneth in one of her best roles as a beautiful but frustrated 1950s outsider who can sense something is 'off' but can't put a finger on it.  And Cate Blanchett who turns up at the wrong moment and robs Tom of his happy ending.  And then the gorgeous Italian setting.  I've watched this movie over and over.  The shot where the reflection of Tom's head in the grand piano as it separates into two people and he puts his glasses on, perfection.  And the ending, where the youthful innocence and self-delusion has hardened into someone who has become a true killer, and then the door slowly closes, leaving Tom Ripley in his dark basement.

136429,5,0792165039,"What I have taken away from this film after seeing it years ago and again on APrime, is that this reflection of the beauty and splendor of life has an undercurrent of sinister and sadness always lurking. That's reality in our world.

The cinematography is splendid and the absolute mystical allure of Italy (I've been and it really is THAT alluring, magical and overwhelming to all the senses) plays a huge part in this film as we are swept away in the adventure and romance of the era.  That's particularly for me why the sinister element is doubly troubling.  On its own merits, yes it's despicable sinister at its scariest.  But we  are carried away and lulled into a glorious fantasy and then...well you have to watch it to find out.

I think this stands out as a very smart thriller that definitely stands the test of time.  All the actors are accomplished, but Damon really shines brightly.

As for Italy, well she shines in this film and in the '50s jetset era, she was the ultimate ""cat's meow"" for America's wealthy class.  That layer of nostalgia is also an interesting part of the film.

If anything, you will undoubtedly be hankering to plan a trip to this magnificent spot on the planet. Ciao.",1486771200,5,1206,4.593457943925234

ALL the actors are spot-on in their parts , with Matt Damon especially appealing with a portrayal of a talented chameleon of a scam artist/con man who lies, fudges, and insinuates his way into situations that will  be to his advantage, no matter who else it hurts. Cate Blanchette has the role of Meredith, heir to a textile fortune, down and livid with Midwestern naivete. ,while Gyneth Paltrow, as Marge, a gadfly masquerading as a book writer, is just dumb enough to make it work. Jude Law fills things out as a wastrel son of a shipyard magnate., who is using the old man's money to ""do"" Italy in Grand Style. When Damon , as  Tom Ripley, gets a hold of this menagerie you can expect the for to fly and it does. Throw in rich photogrAphy  and scenery of coastal Italy and your in for a real treat.

The acting is so vivid:  Jude Law is mesmerizing, with Paltrow and Blanchett so effective in evoking that ""Park Avenue"" girlie personality of the late 50s.  Hoffman makes his early mark brilliantly, and Damon is surprising.  Uniformly strong support from Jack Davenport and others.  Jazz is wonderful too, as is the ambiance of the hypnotizing attraction of post-war Italy.  A great, stirring story not to be missed.",1474416000,,554,4.71875

He goes through so many emotions: awkward, self loathing, smug, joyous, and even mournful (and that's just part of it). It's a complex character to play, but Damon pulls it off. The story is simple, but tense, and as an emotional suspense-drama, it's a good one to see acted out. It's also a period piece, and has some lovely locations to gawp at (as well as lovely young men). You may feel a bit voyueristic watching, but really you should. Just sit back and enjoy it.",1474329600,4,661,4.253968253968254

136628,5,0792165039,"This was a great movie. My hubby and I have been on a Matt Damon kick lately and this finished that out nicely. The Talented Mr. Ripley is an interesting movie about a guy who hasn't really done anything too special and is recruited to go to Europe to bring back a man's daughter from the grips of her new love. The dad does not have any intention to let his daughter stay in Europe with the man as the dad sees the man as no good, and thinks his daughter deserves better. So, he buys Matt Damon a ticket and provides money to make his life pretty nice while he's over there. However, when Damon gets over there, he starts falling in love with a woman, and gets caught in his web of lies. Eventually, it comes down to man vs man, and when things go bad, Damon starts to take over his life.

136642,5,0792165039,"I first saw this movie when it came out several years ago because I was a huge Jude Law fan. I  watched it again last night,and it is even better, more nuanced and complex than I remembered. It's a beautiful, classy suspense film and psychological thriller. Matt Damon is  Ripley, a true villain,  who hides his sick, cunning dark side behind a facade of obsequiousness, awkwardness, naivet and  people pleasing. Damon is so good, playing a character consumed by jealousy and repressed lust, driven to murder and soul suicide. Jude Law created a seductive, complex human being in Dickie Greenleaf, heir to a fortune, spoiled, irresistible. Law is exceptionally talented and had a great knack for playing beautiful, seductive young men and I love watching him. I admire him, too, for not pursuing super stardom based on his looks. He' s really an actor's actor and I love him for that, too!  I had forgotten that PhilipSeymour Hoffman was in this movie, and appreciate even more now his huge talent. His ability to disappear into a role and his inventiveness was magical. Gwyneth Paltrow, CateBlanchett, Jack Davenport and James Rebhorn --all give award worthy performances.
Set in Italy, the photography and design, from sets to lighting to clothing, create a delicious, captivating, scary entertainment. Tthe violence is shocking, especially because you care about the victims.
This is a classic and I highly recommend it, even if you've seen it before. It's even better the second time around.",1474070400,2,1495,5.036437246963563

A glimpse into the lives of super-rich characters and the envious effect on the lead who is surprisingly invited into the excessive, exclusive world and he is reluctant to give it up.

As rarely happens, the movie is better than the book!

This is due to:

 multiple twists and details present in the movie but not in the novel;
 a superlative acting cast which is well directed, Matt Damon for instance never overdoing his various character impersonations;
 the varied and well-chosen musical score that truly supports the storyline;
 the wonderful settings in New York and Italy which successfully render the genus loci despite not being particularly original (5th Avenue overlooking Central Park, Piazza Navona in Rome, the Grand Canal in Venice, the Galleria Umberto 1 in Naples, etc.);
 the pertinent references to Italian culture which some may feel border on stereotypes but do manage to avoid major pitfalls;
 yes, even the costumes which are elegant and well adapted to the characters and their evolutions.

Tom Ripley (Damon) is paid by Jude Law's father to go to Italy and try to talk his playboy son to come home.  He goes, strikes up a close friendship with ""Dickie Greenleaf"" (Law) - actually he falls in love with him.  After too many hints Dickie insists Tom go back home.  A fight ensues and Dickie ends up missing.  Tom Ripley takes his place, living as Dickie Greenleaf.  But it is only a matter of time before he is caught.  Excellent, excellent film.

136804,2,0792165039,"I wouldnt exactly call The Talented Mr. Ripley all that talented.  Hes not so skilled at his sociopathy that you marvel at what he does.  He just seizes a moment when its presented to him and makes it more beneficial to him.  Though, in essence, he does get away with behavior that other films would not otherwise let him get away with, but its easy to see how his tendencies could bloom from a background of being a nobody and otherwise ignored.

Jude Law plays annoying spoiled-rich-boy Dickie, a character weve seen in hundreds of films and who always deserves whats coming to him, and Gwyneth Paltrow is, well, Gwyneth Paltrow as his girlfriend, Marge.  This film has been criticized for its pacing, and rightfully so.  You know that extra 18 minutes that surpasses the films two hours of run time?  Yeah, shaving that off would have probably been beneficial overall.  The movie definitely drags on for a better part of its middle.

I found it kind of funny that the film is about Matt Damon playing someone hes not, yet actors like Law and Cate Blanchett disguised their real accents to play Americans...in a film that takes place in Italy.  So the film is more about people who aren't playing themselves (save for Paltrow and Couplings Jack Davenport) than was quite possibly originally intended.

You can hear Laws accent peeking through at times, though Davenport is allowed to keep his - why?  Is the fact that hes British inconsequential to the material, and does it have to do with nothing more than Englands close geographical proximity to Italy?

[POTENTIAL SPOILERS HERE]

So back to my taking issue with how talented Ripley is - he doesnt plan to get away with murder so much as the odds just happen to luckily turn in his favor - and numerous times, too.  It seems almost silly that he turns to murder as a savior when his first brush with it was an accident - sort of.  Heck, was that even his first?  After all, we don't know much about his New York past and we never really find out.

Because we don't have a better understanding of Ripleys life of loserdom, its harder to comprehend his actions.  Sure, he was romanticized by the idea of Dickies privileged life, and he was obviously deeply hurt when Dickie told him how boring he could be, but didn't Dickies boredom with Ripley seem to come out of left field?  How did they go from being brothers and maybe even potential lovers to Dickie throwing him out like a used shoe?  Perhaps it traces back to Dickies spoiled attitude, but it felt more like a plot device that didn't quite fit.

Admittedly, I haven't seen too many of the late Philip Seymour Hoffmans films - in fact, I cant really remember seeing any - so this probably wasn't a great introduction.  From what Ive heard, he was an amazing actor, and his role here was rather small.  While some small roles steal the screen, this wasn't one of them.

Another late great, Roger Ebert, said of this film that Damon actually makes you want to root for him to get away with it, but I found the opposite was true.  I actually liked Damon a little less after watching this film, which I suppose means he did a great job with the role.",1413417600,3,3158,4.525573192239859
136805,2,0792165039,"Well...I watched this movie for the first time last week.  I don't get all the hype.  This movie is slow.  Now, I'm no stranger to slow movies, the ninth gate is one of my favorite movies of all time, but this was painful to watch.  It was predictable, and I just did not care about a signle character in the whole film.  Not one.  And with a cast like this that should be really hard to do.  Gwynneth Paltrow did a great job, but her character was just plain awful, and seemed to be a puppet of the plot.  She was blinded with love for dickey, and was so kind to Tom, until the very end when all of a sudden her ""woman's intuition"" took over?  She should have shown some sign in the beginning of the film that she felt something was off about tom.  Tom was not charming.  Tom was a shy weirdo.  There's literally very little reason these people should trust him.  Let alone the fact that dickeys father just randomly sends him to europe??  Are you serious??  So many plot holes, so many puppets of the plot with thin characters.  Not worth it.  There were literally two scenes in the entire film where I felt something real.

136818,4,0792165039,"Minghella has captured the lushness of decadent late 50s Italy,which takes up an hour of the opening movie,into which he injects the awkward,upwardly mobile Ripley(Damon) character,who ingratiates himself into the lifestyle of the idle rich. He gets there by fraudulence:a jacket borrowed,a pretence he knew Mr Greenleaf's son,Dickie(Law) at Princeton,to despairing father(Rebhourn), and a lie that he likes jazz. Alright for a lavatory attendant who likes to play the piano. He's there ostensibly to persuade Dickie to give up his life of sun,sex and jazz and return to New York. He's already lied on the liner coming over to socialite ,Meredith (Blanchett),that he's Dickie Greenleaf(playing it down).

After worming his way into the affections of Dickie and his girlfriend Marge(Paltrow),and being seduced by Dickie's lifestyle,and awakening bisexual feelings for Dickie, what truly dislodges him from La Dolce Vita is Dickie's friend Freddie(Hoffman),who loathes his poverty, arriviste pretensions and parasitism on Dickie's wealth. On top of this Dickie arrogantly wants to cast him off,calling him `boring' while they're together on the boat. The scene of shocking violence that follows then changes the whole tone of the film. From there he steals the rich playboy's identity,leading to scenes of thrilling tension when he has to play both Ripley and Greenleaf in the same scene,as at the theatre or in his hotel. Jude Law steals the early part of the movie,playing the charming hedonist with great energy. Also Hoffman dominates every scene he's in,picking holes in the social-climbing sociopath's growing unease and fears of displacement from his new found life of leisure.

Damon plays the creepy sociopath very well but alienates us from sympathizing with him. He is clever,quick-witted and reacts with great skill under pressure,but you feel the house of cards he is building will collapse any moment,as the need for love and security depart with more wealth and social graces, and as the plot thickens he is prepared to kill anybody who gets in his way,even those he likes like Peter or even Marge. Minghella attempts to probe the wounded psyche that the acts of violence stem from. However the grand scale of the sweeping visuals is punctured as the film goes on too long, the sub plots and smaller characters diminish the intensity of the excellent performances. Ripley is left dangling in a sea of mirrors.",1406764800,,2422,5.272020725388601

136824,2,0792165039,"The story line meanders and hardly ever makes any point. There is no suspense. Several concepts are introduced but never followed through. So Mr. Ripley is talented (he can imitate Dickie's father) but later this talent is never used anymore? Why?
The story was rewritten (why, I can't fathom because the original suspenseful thriller by Highsmith is excellent) and it does not seem to know just what to do with itself. Out of sheer blunder, Mr. Ripley stumbles from one murder to the next. The story become predictable which is the worst for what should be a suspenseful journey into a crime and its implications.

I really like Matt Demon and I guess the acting is okay, but boy, this version of the material cannot hold a candle to the much earlier French adaptation of the material:

136827,5,0792165039,"If Ripley wasn't so much of a frightened, self loathing personality you could almost see him transition to Bourne. Ripley's violent charactor evolves from fear of loosing his newly coveted identity where Bourne is simply trying to find his actual identity with rightious indignation and is violent, it would seem, because people are trying to kill him. Ripley and Bourne are both damaged people, although Ripley is a true psychopath or his psychopathology is triggered by the situation he finds himself in. We don't get to see enough about Bourne early on to understand the reasons for allowing himself to become a genetically manipulated killer.

Damon is excellent in both parts. I find Ripley to be very interesting charator which you can sort of love, much in the same way you might love Hannibal Lector. That is the way I see it anyway.",1398124800,2,841,4.881118881118881

Still, I think I would have liked it better if we had gotten more of Ripley's background in place of some of the plot twists. I was more interested in learning more about the character than in some aspects of the plot. Although this character is often described as a psychopath, he strikes me as more complex than that.

On the second viewing, I found Ripley's final scene with Meredith to not be very believable.

136853,5,0792165039,"A stellar cast, lush cinematography, a beautiful backdrop, and a painstakingly re-creation an of a time make this piece unforgettable. Matt Damon plays Ripley a sociopath seemingly without guile, but guile he has in spades. He is recruited by industrialist Herbert Greenleaf, played by the always good James Rebhorn, recruits him to retrieve his n'er do well son Dickie from Italy for one thousand dollars and expenses. This after Tom lies effortlessly about being Dickies friend at Princeton, see Tom covets their patrician lifestyle, and will do anything to get it.
Tom eagerly heads to the Italian coast first class on Cunard to stalk and stumble on Dickie and his girlfriend Marge. Tom is surprisingly forth coming about his goal at the behest of Dickies father. The gorgeous and fickle Dickie, played by Jude Law, and Tom are soon the best of friends and Tom falls for Dickie. Damon and Law create an erotic tension you can with a knife. Soon Dickie tires of Tom especially after meeting up with his old friend Freddie played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Tom doesn't take this lightly and finally kills Dickie and assumes his identity. This is where it becomes a fast paced thriller, and sets Tom off on a murderous spree were he gets everything he wants, but can't stop destroying. Another memorable character is bored socialite Meredith whom Tom courts played by the always excellent Cate Blanchett. she inhabits her roles so completely I was wondering where she would come in halfway through the movie. Never has a serial killer been so likable.",1390176000,2,1552,4.927480916030534
136854,4,0792165039,"Well, the cast is amazing.  No need to address any concerns over performances--they were all amazing.  Even the supporting characters are well-known professionals who nail their parts.

The settings are beautiful and seamlessly integrated into the scenes, shot in such a way that one is impressed with the place as one is engrossed in the tale.

The tale.  Here is where this movie blows so many other thrillers out of the water.  It twists and turns, altering relationships continually.  Ripley is a fascinating and scary person.  At once you admire him, pull for him, and are disturbed by him.  His odd proclivities grow as the story progresses, increasing the tension.  The lies add up.  The conflict rises.  Suspicions grow.

I am trying not to give away anything, because this movie is a worthwhile story.  Yes, it slows a bit at times.  But this only for one to observe the relationships and characterization going on.

This film has it all.  Suspense, violence, perversion, and social commentary.  Very well done.  Unexpectedly good.",1390089600,,1040,5.011764705882353
136855,4,0792165039,"I saw this film when it came out in theaters and liked it a whole lot....probably would have awarded it fives stars. I was interested to see how it would  hold up after this passage of time.  I was not disappointed although I probably was less impressed with it.

 It's a very well made film in many ways.  The story is fascinating, the scenery (sunny Italy) is wonderful to look at, and the actors are very, very good.  Matt Damon gave a tour de force performance as the talented but tortured Tom Ripley.  It's to his credit, too, that Tom is a not  an altogether unsympathetic character.  I remember hoping that he'd get away with his crimes when I watched it the first time.  This time I saw more of the pathos and sheer ugliness of the character.  Jude Law is perfect as the spoiled, rich kid who gets involved with Ripley.  Here again, I think the actor infused the character probably with more likability than the he deserved.  He is over-the-top charming and suntanned to a mellow golden hue that no one seemed able to resist.  Law keeps the character real, though, not descending into caricature; there are moments when he is genuinely sympathetic.  Philip Seymour Hoffman and Cate Blanchette are both brilliant, as always, in supporting roles.  Even Gwynneth Paltrow, not my favorite actress, does a creditable job..

In reading some of the less favorable reviews I see that the subject matter is disturbing to some people and I don't think that this is  a complaint that can be discounted as being merely ""Phillistine.""  There is something terrifying in Ripley and his actions and I sympathize with people who chose not to watch it.  I haven't read any of the novels on which the film is based although I saw a film based on Ripley in later life, starring John Malkovich, which gave a much more positive spin to the character.  This film gives us no clue about Ripley's psyche, how he got that way, other than to show him in a menial job, as a men's room attendant.  To my mind it doesn't adequately prepare us for the enormous rift in his character.  He seems like a nice, kid, maybe a little nerdy, but who plays the piano well....not unlike Good Will Hunting.  Maybe that's why the film has such impact---it's sheer shock value.  Obviously my point of view has changed in the years since the film came out.  I'm less impressed by brilliance and more in human decency.  I guess I've gotten old!",1389916800,,2406,4.573770491803279
136856,5,0792165039,"As a jazz pianist/vocalist and lover of film noir/suspense thrillers I was immediately drawn into this movie. Everything about it is perfect!!! In my top 5 movies!

First Matt Damon plays the complex character of Ripley, a classical pianist, closet homosexual and intellectual introvert from mediocre financial means that dreams of a better more elegant fashionable life and weaves a web of lies leading to murder and intrigue!

Jude Law, is so breathtakingly handsome, and plays his cockiness, womanizing arrogant, rebel character perfectly as Dickie Greenleaf.

The dynamic between Tom Ripley and Dickie is intriguing and intense.

I love this period piece because I'm a cool jazz fanatic, and I must say Matt does an admirable job singing Chet Baker's style rendition of My Funny Valentine.  The clothes are sexy and stunning throughout, and I love the international feel of this movie from NYC to the Italian Riviera.

All the characters are outstanding.  A modern day Hitchcock suspense with a jazzy cool score.  A great head trip.

Son of a shipping magnate is unknown to other rich layabouts?  Puhleaze!  Matt Damon is totally out of place and unconvincing but it is not his fault because the story and script suck big time and I have no clue, absolutely no clue why Minghella would even consider this plot good for a movie.  Every character is as thin as nail polish, again that is because there is nothing to build on, no complexity, no subtlety, no guile.  Total zero.

He's a monster, but we want him to get away with it.

136887,5,0792165039,"When people on the lower rungs of the social ladder see those on the upper rungs, they may wonder what do those people up there have that we don't? Are they really smarter? Do they have so much more talent? Or is it only that those in the upper circles get more opportunities while others have to climb there way up and try to prove themselves while those enjoying the benefits take it for granted? It might seem unfair. However, maybe there's a different way. What if someone pretended like he or she were already among the social elite? What if someone fabricated their education, their talents and their social standing to infiltrate the upper class which often seems barred to those in the lower classes? Would they possibly gain opportunities by simply pretending that they were already a member? Of course they would not only have to create a personal history but also master the etiquette of those on top.

This is what the young Tom Ripley sets out to do in his first episode of infiltrating the upper echelons through deceit and eventually crime. Matt Damon, in a tour-de-force performance, is a lowly hotel worker who manages to get into social gatherings of the upper-crust. He plays piano at a high-class event, substituting for someone who didn't want to take the gig. He even borrows a jacket with the Princeton Univesity logo. There he meets an older couple whose son went to Princeton. When the couple inquire if Ripley had met their son, he acts as if they were old friends. We learn that the son is living in Italy and that his father desperately wants him to return. He offers Ripley $1000 plus expenses if he'll go to Italy and bring him back his son.

In a short time, Ripley is in an Italian town replete with stone walkways and narrow streets. He finds Dickie Greenleaf, played by Jude Law in an equally stunning performance, living in a perpetual paradise with his girlfriend Marge (Gwentheth Paltro). Because he's independently wealthy, Dickie drinks and plays Jazz, and occasionally cheats on his girlfriend. all the while housed in a beautiful seaside apartment. Ripley befriends the couple, and they become a kind of strange three-some. The three get along almost like a little family, with Ripley and Dickie like brothers, and Marge acting both as the female lover of Dickie but also rather maternal towards the other two males. Another friend of Dickie's enters into the menage a trois, Freddie (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who suspects something isn't quite right with Tom Ripley. Dickie and Tom's friendship becomes strained when, at one point, Dickie also begins to question who Ripley really is and his motives.

A stunning completely character-driven story. The acting is absolutely first rate. The most impressive is the relationship between Damon and Law which is so believable you feel as if you're spying on real people rather than watching a movie. The actors create a mystical bond which is uncommon in film, reminiscent of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and like films. But here, there is a perfect blend of drama and suspense which makes Ripley one of the most interesting and original of films.",1385942400,2,3139,4.830855018587361

136931,5,0792165039,"I've seen a good number of thrillers, but this one tops the list. This is the creepiest film I have ever seen because it's so believable and I don't easily give a film 5 stars.

Matt Damon plays a character who is so awkward it hurts to watch him. I think the movie works because everyone knows what it feels like to be a perpetual outsider. Ripley is very talented. He is very funny and very clever. But he is never truly accepted, partly because it doesn't take long to realize there seems to be no real Mr Ripley. He doesn't know who he is, all he knows is what he wants. In this way he is a fundamentally selfish character who doesn't really care about anyone.

In the end Mr Ripley is thoroughly believable, as is everyone else in this film which is why it works so well and why this movie is so spooky, not because the plot twists the characters into unusual situations where they act unusually creepy, but because Mr Ripley himself is creepy beyond belief and the plot allows us to see the full extent of such a dark twisted man.

Matt Damon is awesome in this role and this I think was the first film I ever saw him in. When I  saw this film I understood why he's so respected as an actor; Mr Ripley is an incredibly complex and contradictory character and Damon does him so well that the character and the actor become one and same person. Subsequently all his other roles seemed to me to be very boring and dry, although I've not yet seen good will hunting. I am thinking of saving private ryan, greenzone & the bourne series. I think a typical hollywood hero role is a waste of Damon's talent.

There is so much going for this movie, the sound track is chilling, the settings are beautiful, the characters rub off on you. But all this brightness is out-shined by the very talented Mr Damon.",1377475200,8,1801,4.316568047337278

Matt Damon's Tom Ripley is more watchable than Wim Wenders' Ripley.

The pace may be slow in the beginning, but then, watch out; so much starts to unravel that before you know it, you're sitting on the edge of your seat!  When movies combine intense interpersonal drama, suspense, beauty beyond measure, and actors perfectly suited to the roles they play, you, indeed, have a winner. I've noticed the number of reviews which have preceded mine, and I believe many are interested in the movie for entertainment, mostly. The names, Gwenyth Paltrow, Jude Law, Matt Damon, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Kate Blanchette, are mesmerizing in themselves! The truth is, each one is a class act, but in combination, the energy and chemistry are over the top. Personally, I forgot I was simply watching a movie and gravitated, instead, to the pathos. Anything psychological that Patricia Highsmith creates like, ""Strangers on a Train"", have a psychological edge so fine and so subtle that I believe somewhere her passion was as much for psychoanalytic thought as for crime drama. Read her books and you will see what I mean. The movie is visually as stimulating as Highsmith's insights are intellectually satisfying.

136967,4,0792165039,"Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance as the buffoonish snob Freddie Miles outdoes Patricia Highsmith's original character. Instead of being beaten to death with a heavy ashtray, he is brained by a marble bust of Caesar Augustus (or someone like that). This is a death slightly more appropriate, and perhaps an improvement on the original.

Most of the other players are just adequate. You can't blame the actors, generally; it's a problem with the script. The East-50s bird-bar gay culture that Highsmith recalled from Manhattan of the late 1940s is completely written out, so you don't have the maybe-queer-maybe-not backstory of Thomas Ripley, which provided so much underpinning of the novel's action. Gwyneth Paltrow does a fair job with Marge, the rich boy's girlfriend. She is so bland, however, in both novel and movie, that the screenwriters give us an extra female character (Cate Blanchett) to balance out the cast.

Jude Law just misses as rich boy Dickie Greenleaf, the shipbuilding scion whom Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is supposed to spy on, and winds up murdering. Law doesn't ""read"" correctly as a wealthy young American expatriate who dabbles in painting. The screenwriters substitute a Jazz fixation for the art interest. This makes Dickie seem more like a rich hipster than the Hemingwayesque brute/aesthete that Highsmith created. Law's Dickie is sufficiently hateful, so we don't mind when he's murdered by Tom Ripley in a rowboat off the Cote d'Azur (as in the novel). But since the homosexual suspicions are removed from the script, Tom's immediate motivations for killing him are unclear.",1373068800,,1609,5.232558139534884

He is asked by shipping magnate Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) to go to Italy to persuade his wastrel playboy son Dickie (Jude Law) to come home. Actually, Ripley soon finds he enjoys the life-style too much, especially the company of Dickie's girl-friend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), and joins in with Dickie's activities. The smooth flowing of his new persona is disrupted by his meeting with a real heiress at the airport, Meredith Logue (Cate Blanchett), and a real friend of Dickie's from Princeton, Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman). To Meredith, Ripley has already passed himself off as Dickie Greenleaf. Then a local girl that Dickie has made pregnant drowns herself. For the rest of the movie Damon has sometimes to be `Dickie Greenleaf' for Meredith and others, and at other times himself, Tom Ripley, for Marge and Dickie. Eventually Ripley and Dickie fall out and Dickie is killed: Ripley tells Marge that he has simply gone off to other parts of Italy, but Marge never really believes him.

136979,1,0792165039,"I didn't care for the film.  It dragged on and on and in the end, Damon's character turned out to be a serial killer.  The film unexpectedly went from being enjoyable to dark.  Maybe I should have read other reviews of it...my expectations were completely wrong from what the film was about.",1370649600,2,291,4.5576923076923075
136980,4,0792165039,"IMDB Review:

Seeing this gorgeous tango between Damon and Law, I was never less than captivated and riveted. Minghella has fashioned something literate, powerful, seductive, charming, tragic, and beautiful. His casting is nearly perfect. Damon is unforgettable as an amoral but fascinating character whom we even sympathize with by film's end. Law is stunning as Dickie, the man whose life Ripley adores. Paltrow is good, though she is not given a whole lot to do. Blanchett is perfect in a small but pivotal role that only adds to her already impressive filmography. This is a near-masterpiece. Minghella's talent for visual opulence is second to none, and his work here should earn him a directing Oscar nod. The same goes for many others associated with this brilliant achievement. The ending is as unsuspected as it is inevitable, that is, sad and unsettling. In fact, the whole film underscores these emotions. Whereas Highsmith's original novel was cold and sometimes inert, the film makes Ripley much more of a living, breathing character, and as such, a great symbol of tragedy. It may be some time before I forget this intense experience. Certainly one that deserves multiple viewings. One of the best films of 1999. I think this may be one of the best pictures I have ever seen. Bravo everyone. A moving, rich knockout!",1370476800,2,1330,5.018099547511312

136983,4,0792165039,"This is an intriguing movie. It is both interesting and painful to watch the main character's slow slide from innocence to evil.  It is reminiscent of Macbeth, in that it all starts with a single idea, an event not triggered by the protagonist.  But one lie leads to another, and yet another.

Matt Damon gives an outstanding performance and is incredibly sympathetic, even later in the movie.  Jude Law is excellent as the rich young man living off his father's largesse and living for music.  Visually the movie is lovely.

Overall a fascinating movie.",1370390400,,554,4.840425531914893

136986,4,0792165039,"A clever and intriguing movie, well acted and directed (and beautifully filmed), but not your usual point of view. Novelist Patricia Highsmith, upon whose novels this is based, did not feel the villains in  books (or movies) necessarily had to get their comeuppance in the end, since they didn't always in real life either. So Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is a scoundrel, but an oddly likable one, and as the movie progresses, the viewer finds himself rooting for him - and Dickie, whom he impersonates, is a real crud, so one doesn't feel sorry for him as one might otherwise. This sort of reminded me of Dexter, where the usual values get all turned around, but it works. Probably not everyone's cup of tea, but I liked it a lot.",1369785600,2,726,4.584615384615384

136998,4,0792165039,"Not my favorite Matt Damon movie; however, it's a good suspenseful movie, albeit kind of creepy.  Ripley is a master at fooling people with whom he makes contact.  He is resourceful to the extent he can master a person's persona and, when the occasion calls for it, take their place to deceive another person completely with his role playing.

Trouble is Ripley has a temper that when discovered in his assumed roles or his sexual preferences he turns violent to the extent of murder.  Only one person (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) recognizes Ripley for what he really and realizes what he has done.

I won't reveal what happens when she confronts Ripley with the father of the man he murdered present.  It is sufficient to say the movie has a surprise and suspenseful ending.",1367020800,,774,4.7388059701492535

I didn't want this movie to end! It had me turning and tumbling at the scenes in which Mr. Ripley loses all sense of boundaries and the reality of his actions. The plot keeps you at the edge of your seat wondering what will become of Mr. Ripley and all his other persona's he ""hi-jacks"".

Don't hold your breath for that good ending.

Just as a lie requires another lie to cover up the previous lie, this movie shows that a murder requires another murder (and a third, implied, murder) to cover up the previous murder.  This is basically Cain and Able.  If I wanted to read/watch a story such as this, I'd read the Bible.

Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), by way of mistaken identity, is paid to go abroad and bring back home to America the son of a wealthy shipbuilder.  Jude Law plays Dickie Greenleaf the heir to a shipping fortune and his father wants him to stop wasting his life and come back to the family business.  Tom decides to take up the offer using his ""talents"" and the money from Dickie's father to insinuate himself into Dickie's life.  When they first meet, Dickie has some suspicions about Tom but they wind up bonding over their shared love of jazz, and along with Dickie's girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) the three enjoy a relaxing life in Rome.  Things are going great, especially for Tom who is living the life of his dreams.  They party, sail, and Tom ends up eventually living with Dickie and Marge. However, the relationship begins to take a turn by way of some strange behavior on Tom's part.  Dickie has already decided he is not going back home and he begins to tire of Tom and his constant presence.

Warning: lots of spoilers below. Do not read unless you're familiar in detail with the book and the two movies mentioned above.

Broadly and very roughly speaking, ludicrous as this may sound, it seems to me that Anthony Minghella's version is slightly closer to the book in terms of minor plot details, whereas Rene Clement's adaptation is much truer in terms of characters. But this is surely an oversimplification, for both movies could hardly have been more different; apart from the names of the main characters, I think all scenes they share are the two murders and Tom's having fun with Dickie's clothes in his room and in front of his mirror, and even here there are many small differences. Curiously, in both cases the director is also the author of the screenplay, though Rene Clement is actually a co-screenwriter. This is all for the better: adaptation of a novel for the screen is largely a matter of personal vision, and so is the final movie: if, then, the director and the screenwriter are the same man, or at least different sides of one man, we may expect an excellent collaboration between them.

I have to admit that Minghella's The Talented Mr Ripley has been growing on me recently. The first time I saw it, a good many years ago, I didn't like it at all. Later I was swept off my feet by Plein Soleil and I still think it is by far the better movie, but now I also have a great deal of admiration for Minghella's adaptation. I still don't like Matt Damon's horse face and I still think he is by way of being a miscast, but his performance is not without merit either. He has some haunting lines which he delivers in a memorable way:

'If I could just go back... if I could rub everything out... starting with myself.'

'I always thought it'd be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.'

Don't you just take the past and put it in a room in a basement and lock the door and never go in there? That's what I do. [...] And then you meet someone special and all you want to do is to toss them the key and say; open up, step inside, but you can't, because it's dark, There's demons and if anybody saw how ugly it is. I keep wanting to do that, fling the door open just let light in and clean everything out.

Well, whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful, it all makes sense, doesn't it, in your head. You never meet anybody that thinks they're a bad person.

Stirring lines. I don't remember any of them in the novel, so I guess Anthony Minghella should be given credit for them. And not a negligible one too. His adaptation also has few additional original touches that are delightful. The passion for music - jazz for Dickie, classical for Tom - is ever more convincing than the original painting in the novel. The scene in the opera house is one of the most dramatic and brilliantly done in the whole movie; the exceprt from Tchaikovsky's Evgeny Onegin is beautifully staged and deeply moving. Minghella also makes an excellent use of the rather sketchy in the novel Peter Smith-Kingsley and introduces Meredith who seems to be a completely original character but fits into the action to perfection. So is the episode with Silvana.

The fascinating thing about Minghella's version is that the character of Tom Ripley which Matt Damon has to recreate in the movie is vastly different than the one in the novel. He is certainly not the cold-blooded murderer calculating everything with frightening calmness; indeed the killing of Dickie is almost an accident, a kind of self-defence. This Tom Ripley is much more vulnerable and sensitive creature than the one in Patricia's book. He manages adroitly the deceiving game and he kills swiftly when he has to, as in the case of Freddie Miles, but he still seems to me a rather pathetic creature much more worthy of sympathy than of fear. The only drawback to the character as far as I am concerned are the hints about homosexuality. It is very briefly mentioned in the novel and it is entirely missing from Clement's version. Rightly so, since the sexual orientation has nothing to do with the most fascinating sides of Tom Ripley's character. Homosexual or not, such elements make him more human and thus more believable, perhaps, but certainly less compelling.

The endings of both movies are hugely different, yet both are in their own way chilling. The Talented Mr Ripley finishes with Murder No. 3, conveyed only by sound, and an ingenious shot showing the transformation of Matt Damon's profile from brightly lit to pitch dark and then closing a door until the whole screen turns black, certainly a stroke of genius on Minghella's side. The murderer gets away but I can't help feeling sorry for him. How long can he go on like this, knowing not who he really is, constantly threatened by the circumstances, with wrecked nerves and full of paranoid obsessions? Is the price too high for him? Will he get away next time? Is it worth it? Difficult questions.

By contrast, in the end of Plein Soleil Tom Ripley is caught by the police. This ending has been much disparaged, including by Patricia herself, as unnecessarily changed to satisfy the popular taste that the criminal must be punished and all that sort of thing. I don't see it that way. To begin with, Rene Clement's stratagem to get Tom caught and his directing the scene are nothing short of perfect. Who would have thought that, having apparently won everything, Tom would fall in the hands of police because of such tiny detail? The scene of his arrest is carefully prepared but the arrest itself is completely missing, substituted by a lovely picture of beach and sea. The sun is shining brightly but you feel cold inside - by ''you'' I mean of course I.

Now Tom Ripley in Plein Soleil is the Tom Ripley from The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia Highsmith, only considerably simplified for the screen of course. He doesn't kill Dickie almost by accident but after serious contemplation and with stunning decisiveness. It is not for nothing that the weapon is changed here - it is indeed a weapon, a big knife, instead of the oar used in the other movie and in the book as well. The performance of Alain Delon, absurdly young and even more absurdly beautiful at the time, is superb at all fronts, infinitely superior to anything Matt Damon is capable of; but, then again, as mentioned earlier, the latter has quite another fish to fry. But Delon conveys the ruthlessness and the especially the charm of Tom Ripley in a way that may well freeze one's blood. Pity that his amazing beauty often leads to gross underestimation of his acting skills, which are considerable indeed. Some of the most unforgettable scenes are Tom's training Dickie's signature or forging his passport and their conversations on the yacht immediately before the murder: all these plot details are strokes of genius, superbly acted and perceptively directed. Moreover such nuances add verisimilitude that is missing in Minghella's adaptation or Patricia's original; the presumption that Tom and Dickie are so much alike that one can use the passport of the other, even under the scrutiny of a police officer, is a trifle too fanciful to be believed by the demanding reader.

The main advantages of Minghella's movie are his absolutely gorgeous sets, both in San Remo and Rome (the former omitted in Clement's version) and especially the marvellous supporting cast. Gwyneth Paltrow is fine as the vacuous Marge, the looks she shots Tom when she realises the truth are unforgettable, and Jude Law gives a powerful performance as the flippant and gay Dickie Greenleaf, though his character is perhaps a trifle overdone in this respect. Philip Seymour Hoffman as the vulgar and bumptious Freddie Miles, Cate Blanchett as the silly, pretty and mentally unstable Meredith, and Jack Davenport as the handsome, homosexual and charming Peter Smith-Kingsley are all excellent; interestingly, the last two characters are missing from the other movie (and Meredith is missing from the book, for that matter). The only slight disappointment is James Rebhorn as Dickie's father and Philip Baker Hall as the detective, again both largely missing from Clement's version. Perhaps the most serious flaw in Minghella's screenplay (as well as in the book's plot) is indeed the episode with the detective. It is difficult to believe that such a smart guy, who has discovered so much from scratch, should really fail to see and find proof that it was exactly Tom Ripley who killed both Dickie Greenleaf and Freddie Miles (in defence of the book, the detective there strikes Tom as only ''moderately bright'', which he apparently is). But the sets are truly incomparable! The glittering glamour and the dolce vita that American expatriates led in Italy from the 1950s are captured to perfection.

This is what Plein Soleil most painfully misses: visual glamour. Not only is the San Remo episode skipped, but the sets in Rome and Naples are as drab as anything and the camera work is rather poor most of the time; perhaps one is unwise to expect more from a French movie released in 1960; those shaking shots of yacht scenes are vividly realistic, to be sure, but the Rome philandering of Tom and Dickie (here called Philip) are rather amateurishly done. That said, the only real disappointment among the cast is Billy Kearns as Freddie Miles; he is sufficiently arrogant, but not quite as tasteless as this particular Princeton graduate is expected to be. Marie Laforet is an excellent Marge - common and cute - and her quarrel with Philip makes his disappearance later much more plausible; the change of heart that Minghella and Highsmith try to make us believe Tom would use just does not carry conviction. After Alain Delon's magnificent performance, my personal Oscar for best actor goes to Maurice Ronet who is an outstanding Philip Greenleaf, way superior to Jude Law and indeed much more suitably presented in the screenplay, not as somebody determined not to go back, but as an eternally vacillating fellow not quite serious enough to make up his own mind, perhaps unconsciously seduced by the easy life in Southern Italy.

The only drawbacks in Clement's screenplay is the populist attraction of Tom to Marge: it has the same detrimental effect as the homosexuality in the Minghella's movie. It is entirely out of character, indeed it detracts from the character, and is rightly never mentioned in the book; Minghella's version makes only one short and insignificant mention of it (in that great scene when Tom was about to cut Marge's throat). Apart from that, it would perhaps have been nice if the first part of the movie - until the first murder - had been extended a little bit more, especially considering the great performance of Maurice Ronet.

At any rate, the two movies are so vastly different that both are well worth watching. Though they, I suspect, can make the book less compelling than it might otherwise be, Patricia Highsmith's novel remains a very enjoyable read. Despite occasional tedium and clumsiness, it has at least two major advantages over either of the movies: it gives a way deeper and more amazing insight into Tom Ripley's confused yet fascinating mind; and the plot is a great deal more complicated and suspenseful.",1307836800,3,11602,4.840221774193548

Pretty much everything and everyone here is top-notch. Damon's Ripley is rather more innocent at first than Highsmith's original, but it works with his gee-whiz looks and plays well against Law's spoiled rich boy. Law, Paltrow and Blanchett are both excellent and believable, as is Hoffman, whose range becomes ever more apparent. These are in fact five of the very best from their generation of actors, and writer/director Minghella gives them plenty to work with here. That he saw their talents clearly well before they'd started to peak only adds more lustre to his genius on display here.

Italy has rarely looked better; clearly Minghella hadn't had enough of la bella Italia after making The English Patient, and he sure knows how to set up a shot and use natural Mediterranean light to greatest effect. And you've got to give the guy credit: he picks the best books to make flicks of. His writing and directing does much justice to Highsmith's novel, and in the first viewing I've had of this since seeing it when it came out, I was never bored even after two hours. The homoerotic edge of the script and Damon's performance is just enough to provide some extra edge here, and makes the ending that much more chilling.

Some reviews here complain about that aspect, and wish they'd been forewarned that there were elements of gayness here, but it's hardly overwhelming and is key to the plot. Then again, if even hints of gayness offend you that much, being offended by this movie might be the least of your issues.

Overall, combining the gorgeous Italian locales (all shot in country) with an excellent plot and script, and adding some very fine acting, one ends up with a superior murder non-mystery worth watching for any number of reasons. Ripley is one of the best noir-type films of the past couple decades, and well worth watching for any fan of the genre, or these actors, or Italy, or just solid movie-making in general.

This will age far better than most films of its decade, count on that.",1268524800,,2020,4.743589743589744
137093,5,0792165039,"Perhaps because I had no preconceptions from reading the book, I thought this a terrific film.

Under the skilled direction of Anthony Minghella, Matt Damon (arguably) has turned in one of his best performances as the talented young psychopath of the title.  As the eternal outsider, he portrays the right amounts of nerdy ingenuousness, opportunism, and a plausibility that acts as a thin veneer for an underlying creepiness. Damon juggles the complexity of Ripley so expertly that he actually had me wincing on his behalf and half-hoping that he would get away with his machinations and find happiness, especially after discovering that the handsome Dicky Greenleaf (Jude Law) was not all that he seemed in the first place. The Misses Paltrow and Blanchett are convincing as post-preppies, and Anthony Seymour Hoffman oozes open menace that also causes one to root for Damon.

This is the third time that I have watched the DVD, and I shall very likely watch it again, partly because of Italy, and partly because of the complexity of the film which allows for new discoveries at every viewing.",1262649600,2,1428,5.0168776371308015
137094,1,0792165039,Was a good Damon movie back before he matured. His co=stars were pretty weak...yuppies in Italy. Time has made a difference in how you view the movie. I doubt if the fat guy ever made the big leagues????,1243555200,2,203,4.368421052631579
137095,4,0792165039,"Overall, this is intriguing drama-crime story with a lot of suspense and done so without a lot of violence. All the characters in this movie grab your attention. Combine that with good European scenery and involving storyline and you have a movie worth investigating.

I read somewhere that  this film also goes under the title, ""The Strange Mr. Ripley.""  How true.

****Spoilers****  The first hour sets up Matt Damon's character, ""Tom Ripley,"" to do what he eventually does:  kill someone and then imitate the rich kid off in Europe.

However, to be fair, his murder of friend ""Dickie Greenleaf"" (Jude Law) is almost made to look like self-defense. It's an odd scene in this odd movie. As the story unfolds, however, ""Ripley"" is shown to be a sick killer, hardly some innocent man caught in some self-defense predicament.

The second half of the film deals with Damon's character trying to get away with his scheme while other people slowly start to question who he is and what he's doing. Some people trust him; some don't. A few twists make the story even more interesting.

Gwyneth Paltrow is good in here as ""Marge Sherwood,"" someone who is ahead of the pack when it comes to uncovering the truth. Cate Blanchett is good, too, as usual, but her role was much smaller and one I'm not sure was all about.",1243555200,2,1308,4.701754385964913
137096,5,0792165039,"""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" was released in North America on Christmas Day, 1999 and became a boxoffice smash. Starring Oscar winner Matt Damon in the title role, the movie is about a man who entangles himself into the life of a rich shipping heir, Dicky, played superbly by Jude Law. Thomas Ripley goes to beautiful Italy, on the advice and expense of Dicky's dad, who wants Tom to bring his playboy son back to the U.S.. Once he gets there not only is Tom Ripley smitten by Dicky's extravagent lifestyle, but he is also smitten with Dicky himself. Once Tom realizes that Dicky will not give into his (Tom's) advances, he kills him. This is where the movie really takes off as Thomas takes over Dicky's life. The film is about stealing not only someone's identity, but their very own life.
 The acting is flawless, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Cate Blanchett, and Gwyneth Paltrow all deliver excellent supporting acting performances. Anthony Minghella, who directed the superb ""English Patient"", outdoes himself in this film. He should have received an Oscar for his directing, as not only does he bring out the best in his cast, but he brings out the best in his shooting locales. Filming on location is difficult for any director, but once you see the directorial work in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", you will understand that filming this piece of art was no easy task. When I watch this movie it is unlike any I have viewed, as I feel like I am actually in Italy. The scenic locations are exquisite and they add to the drama of this masterpiece of the cinema.
 The movie was nominated for five Oscars, sadly winning none, and the film was budgeted at forty million dollars. No expense was spared when making this work.
 The DVD contains a neat commentary by Minghella, and there is a neat documentary on the making of the film with the cast. The trailer is included and the film is in widescreen.
 This is definitely a five star movie!",1243123200,,1935,4.649122807017544
137097,4,0792165039,"This is one of those films that sends shivers down your spine. Matt Damon is a pretty good actor and seeing ""Jason Bourne,"" play this role and have such homo erotic and strange story tangents is just creepy.",1243036800,,207,4.473684210526316
137098,4,0792165039,"One advantage in having not is the motivation and desire it breeds to have. But to what cavernous depths may motivation and desire lower someone to fuel inherent megalomania? Would one lie, cheat or steal? The answer is innate. What of murder? I'll never tell.

The film, ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" explores such disturbing issues quite demonstratively and effectively. Tom Ripley's (Matt Damon) anguish, is not only to attain wealth and stature, but also the persona and very name attached to both. The opportunity obliges when an affluent New York shipping magnate hires Tom as an emissary to go to a quaint village in Italy and extract his eccentrically wayward son, Dickie Greenleaf, exceptionally played by Jude Law.

The mercenary plan suffers a miscarriage when Tom becomes enthralled by Dickie, siding with him against the elder Greenleaf's intent. Mayhem ensues as these two pseudo ""mates"" eventually discover that even when one tosses the perfect salad, no matter what the effort; the oil and vinegar dressing never mixes. The oil is non-polar and consistently rises to the top, while the vinegar is polar and remains at the bottom. Dickie is the oil and Tom is the vinegar.

Despite his crass rendition of ""My Funny Valentine,"" Matt Damon handles this complex title role with incredible precision; much like the spontaneous color transitions owned by a chameleon.  His arcane blend of lucidity, psychosis, and guile is pitch-perfect. While Gwyneth Paltrow's (Marge) effort as Dickie's forlorn and jilted girlfriend was yeoman-like, Cate Blanchett (Meredith Logue) and Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Freddie Miles) are both prolific in their diminutive roles.

As for Director Anthony Minghella, this film does not leap off the screen in full spectrum like his brilliant epic, ""The English Patient,"" yet he more than manages to purport dire substance to the main theme. In addition, Minghella exhumes colossal efforts from the adept ensemble cast. Under his masterful guidance and classic intuition, the cinematography reminds us of how sublime the southern tip of Italy is, and showcases the sheer elegance of the Mediterranean Coast. Scenes such as the ones where Tom is caught frolicking around in Dickie's clothes, and tears trickling down his face while taking in an opera, which parallels his actions are priceless.

One may not enjoy the dynamics of this sophisticated thriller, feeling that they may be too morally flawed. In order to smooth this doubt over a tad, Minghella himself in an interview stated, `the film is really about myself and how I imagined life in Italy.' He also said, 'it represents the worst of me.' If there is any truth to these statements, Anthony Minghella, though no longer amongst us, at least deserves a shot in the dark.",1242172800,,2761,5.138084632516704
137099,5,0792165039,"This is a beautifully crafted movie with fine acting, directing, cinematography, and an artful script. The Italian locations are beautiful and striking. In its own realm of cinema, it is a superb production.
 What interests me most, though, is how the film differs from Patricia Highsmith's fine novel. The film medium should not slavishly follow another art form, the novel, but should it veer so far off course as this one? We know that Highsmith was not too happy with film interpretations of her work, but we wonder how she would have reacted to this. She died in 1995; this came out in 1999.
Anthony Minghella, director and screenwriter, took considerable liberties with the source material. In the movie Tom commits three murders rather than the two in the novel. He is gayer in the movie while he is more closeted in the book. The character of Freddie (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is more sinister, nastier, and more important in the movie. Meredith, a key player in the movie, is non-existent, and Tom does not have a love affair with Peter Smyth Kingsley.
In the book Dickie paints rather than plays the saxophone. He has no local girlfriend whom he gets with child. In the book Marge has no accusation scene with Tom and is far more passive. In the movie Dickie's father cedes his son's inheritance to Tom; in the book Tom steals it by forging the son's signature. And so it goes.
Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf steals the movie while a toothy and bespectacled Damon, though he does a fine job, seems more a witness than participant in the first part of movie. Tom is always trying to ingratiate himself with Dickie while Dickie often shows his complete disdain for him, calling him spooky, creepy, and a leech. Tom openly admits to his idol that he forges, lies, and does impersonations. Later, of course, he becomes Dickie for a time. Tom reads too much sexual meaning into some of Dickie's actions.
The movie makes Tom more guilt-ridden than the book in which he jettisons his conscience. A memorable line by Tom from the movie: ""I'd always thought it'd be better to be a real somebody than a fake nobody.""",1241049600,4,2113,4.695417789757412

Ripley is an all-around waiter and men's room attendant, who has donned a Princeton University Blazer to play piano for the guests. He is asked by Greenleaf if he knows his son, Dickie, who also attended Princeton, Class of 1958. You can almost see the wheels turning in Ripley's head as he answers yes! Thus begins the diabolical career of Mr. Ripley who is hired on the spot to track down Dickie and persuade him to return to New York. His payment is $1,000.
Filmed in beautiful San Remo, Venice and the south of Italy, Ripley's arrival, his mimicry of voices and language, and his newly acquired appreciation of jazz wins over Dickie, played by Jude Law and his fiance, Marge, played by Gweneth Paltrow.

137103,4,0792165039,"Just in case you reach the end of THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY and wonder why you've become not just sympathetic but end up rooting for an amoral murderer: this story does an excellent job of leading you down the path to murder.

You begin by gaining sympathy for Matt Damon as Tom Ripley, an eager and personable enough guy who has a life of sad, grinding poverty.  Through a bit of timing and chutzpah, he finds himself enlisted to go to Europe and persuade a rich kid to come home.  The lazy world of the idle rich is a new lifestyle that Mr. Ripley doesn't want to let go of.

It helps us that we discover the people whom Ripley ""victimizes"" are crass, selfish people with dirty little secrets of their own.  Ripley may be a complete fraud in his charade as one of the rich kids partying around Europe--but at least he's doing more with his life than the people he encounters!

This is a wonderfully photographed, deeply textured film without the ""thriller"" conventions.  It doesn't move fast but does turn up the interest as Ripley goes further and further with is schemes.  The performances are all top-notch and the locations are stunning.  I just went to Venice for the first time last fall and I was still struck at how beautiful it looks in this film.

Suffice to say what this reviewer sees is an excellent piece of work by Law and Damon. augmented by a good supporting cast. Damon certainly gets more than he bargained for in trying to bring the fun loving, bi- sexual Law back to New York to see his reputable father. Damon becomes homosexuallly engaged with Law, a man who's already lost a drowned, pregnant mistress and is now engaged to  Paltrow.  All of Damon's tricks-imitations, false flattery, blatant lying-  go for naught as Law reveals that Damon is little more than a bore,a hanger onner with no depth. A fight breaks out and Damon kills Law, and later Law's friend from Princeton, who's able to see right through Damon. A  third murder is barely averted by chance and the police are closing in when Law's father arrives from New York with full evidence of his son's past guilt and odd behavior, thus setting Damon free with some of Law's inheritance.

137108,5,0792165039,"This film - like the others directed by the brilliant Anthony Minghella - manages yet again to crawl under one's skin of comfort, and creates brooding emotions of empathy and revolt.

Tom Ripley - like most of the others - is a very complex character: the idealist genius with the non-ideal background, yearning for more. As a simple lie pulls him into the world of the rich and glamorous, he finds himself trapped by the intoxication of this faux success, as he mentioned to his lover with tears streaming from his anguished face: it's better to be a fake somebody, than a real nobody. It eventually leads to murder upon murder, as Tom cannot escape his yearning for acknowledgement.

Matt Damon portays Mr. Ripley beautifully as he quietly 'dies' behind a mask of happiness. The supporting cast is excellent, and the boat-scene between Damon and Law being grippingly brilliant.

Yet again - choosing his old time favourite - Minghella chooses Gabriel Yared to score the film, and it finishes off 'Mr. Ripley' with emotional style.

Probably because I just saw the other ""Ripley"" film,RIPLEY'S GAME and felt rather blah about it is my most current response. Whatever it is, Matt Damon and Anthony Minghella's taught script and direction riveted me to the sofa. What a vacuum of a character Patricia Highsmith created in her 1955 novel. What I think is great about this adaptation is the way in which Damon presents Ripley as a ""master sponge"" who can soak up any personality around him and then discard the original host thus becoming less the original Ripley and more now a new creation. In one of the last lines of the film,Ripley turns to his friend/""lover"" and sobs,""Tell me something good about Tom Ripley."" Matt Damon's performance is what is good about Tom Ripley. I am glad that I have gone back to this film over the years.

* the protagonist should not be markedly stupider than the audience.  Anyone who wasn't yelling ""Get the hell out of Rome"" after Tom runs into Meredith is probably dumb enough to think this is a great movie;

137116,5,0792165039,"The movie is an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel by the same name. The story line follows Highsmith, but there are notable departures. I find the movie adaptation to be brilliant. It is a psychologically complex movie that continues to probe deeper and deeper into issues of identity and moral conscience right up until the closing scene. Seeing the movie for the first time one might have the feel that director/writer Anthony Minghella is walking one through a tour of a grand old castle where rooms and corridors upon up into more rooms and corridors even more intriguing than the first.

The film seems to divide into two movements. The first is the ""age of innocence"" for Tom Ripley. He is a boy with an opportunity and a hope for a better life: to escape his boring life of normalcy in New York for a life of beauty and taste. Where else, but Italy!??!

While in Italy he is charged with bringing playboy Dickie Greenleaf back home to his wealthy father in the States. Dickie, however, has no interest, and Tom quickly realizes this and chooses to cast in his lot with Dickie and become fast friends. But Dickie is too fickle for the ""brotherhood"" that Tom craves. Hence the tension leads up to a moment of dramatic tragedy that forever changes the course of Ripley's life and ushers in the second movement of the film.

There is now a turn towards suspense and intrigue as Tom uses his ""talents"" to gain a life of privilege and beauty. The narrative unfolds the suspense of Ripley trying to maintain multiple ""worlds"" and ""realities"" of deceit that Minghella describes as a myriad of ""spinning plates,"" and Matt Damon creates a character who skillfully holds all of these false realities together in a grand score that somehow makes sense to all the players despite the glaring inconsistencies that the audience can see.

Holding this labyrinth of duplicity together would not have been possible without an absolutely incredible cast of actors and characters who come in and out of Ripley's life at every turn. The classical scenery also provides a setting where Damon can create his character of complexity.

Ripley is desperate to escape the social and aesthetic ""basement"" of life, and for a while he seems to have succeeded. Yet despite his achievement he is left wondering whether he has not simply constructed another basement of moral and spiritual darkness. This is a character who begins a journey of discovering identity and finds himself trying to attain a new life through any means possible. But the events of Ripley's life play out like a tragedy and the grip of irony becomes tighter and tighter for Ripley as the road to his self discovery leads, as Minghella says, to ""the annihilation of self.""",1186099200,2,2727,4.8059701492537314

I'm giving the movie five stars because to me it was perfect until the very last scene, which felt incomplete and unfinished.  Jude Law more than holds his own against Matt Damon's subtle performance as Dickie Greenleaf, the wealthy dilettante that has the life that Matt Damon's Tom Ripley covets.  The film completely draws you in and you truly feel both Damon's desire and desperation and Law's utter contempt of both of those emotions.

Matt Damon portrays the mysterious Mr. Ripley, who, more or less, remains a mystery throughout the film. I was intrigued at how, when you first see him on screen, you are given the impression that he is nothing more than a shy, innocent, and intellectual young man who pretty much keeps to himself. However, this image is only visable for the first five minutes or so, and is virtually shattered once he accepts the offer to go to Italy in search of Mr. Greenleaf's son, Dickie. I was fascinated at how rapidly his personality altered, and suddenly I understood that he was rather odd, as he deceived Mr. Greenleaf in the first place by wearing a Princeton jacket and pretending that he knew Dickie.

As the film progresses and it becomes more apparent there is something deeply wrong with Damon, you almost begin to root for him to get away with his malicious acts. He is so effective as the quietly psychotic Ripley because his actions do not seem planned. He just kind of takes what is not his without reason.

The beauty of Rome, Venice, and Gwyneth Paltrow tends to hide the inner turmoil going on with Damon's character and Jude Law is oblivious to it most of the time. The madness builds slowly and Law, as the target of Damon's consuming desire, realizes it too late. Law has the looks and mannerisms of a 50's matinee idol which fits perfectly within the context of the film.

Some people have said The Talented Mr. Ripley is like a Hitchcock film for the 90's. I would have to agree. Damon's ability to portray a fully realized, human leach is amazing at times and the fact that I actually had some sympathy for him proves it. There are scenes of utter shock and dismay, but it is the drowning build to the inevitable murder and mayhem that grabs you.",1176508800,4,1985,4.533519553072626

He loves everything about Dickie's privileged lifestyle, but complications arise when an American socialite (Cate Blanchette) and a nosey pal (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) start to crowd Tom.

Anti-hero Tom Ripley is something of an innocent, while also being completely amoral.  He admits early on that he is a liar, forger, and impersonator, and those are some of his good qualities.  He commits an unspeakable act in a fit of passion, and finds himself buried deeper and deeper in a web of lies.  Matt Damon is convincing as Tom, but charismatic Jude Law steals the show as the spoiled golden boy, Dickie.  His American accent is just right and his scenes are the best in the movie.  Paltrow, Blanchette, and Hoffman give memorable performances, too.  The Italian locations are beautiful, and the intense script is full of twists and turns as Tom's dream of wealth is pursued, realized, and then threatened.  The story is complex, subtle, and shocking; I understand more with every viewing and like it more, too.  Highly recommended.",1161043200,4,1378,4.96943231441048
137125,5,0792165039,"And I believe him.

I sympathized with Tom, as I suspect most viewers do, despite his sociopathic nature. I was only sad about one of his murder victims - Peter. Some of the others become so cocky, sickeningly uppity, that you can't wait for them to get off the screen.  You want Tom to win. He is the underdog, after all, and people get tired of seeing the same sort of people (i.e. Dickie) win over and over again, especially if they don't make much of an effort. And Dickie is a prime example of someone who doesn't have to work but gets everything handed to him, and he doesn't even seem grateful for it. Spoiled. You know the type.

In a way, Tom reminds me of Vincent, Ethan Hawke's character from Gattaca. Both are very ambitious. Doing anything and everything to fit in with the ""upper class/superior society,"" desperately trying to cover their tracks, obsessed with getting all the details just right..because the consequences of being found out would be disastrous. Both are fascinating characters but Tom is the one that intrigues me the most. He's so cold with that sick, sly smile on his face - you can't help but wonder what he's plotting, what twisted images he's conjured up.

But Tom was a jealous, mad murderer, and Vincent was acting more out of revenge for society's prejudices against the genetically inferior.  One could say that Tom was acting out of revenge as well...revenge for having been born poor when he would rather be of the idle rich class, taking advantage of the best things in life. His self-esteem is so low that he has to pretend to be a dead person in order to feel fulfilled - and I don't think he'll ever be completely fulfilled. He'll always be looking over his shoulder, and a rich identity will not cure unhappiness and the void inside.

Italy was a beautiful setting for this movie, adding more culture and depth than many other places, I think. That particular aura of all things foreign helped set the mood to something alluring and dark..

Matt Damon's best film.",1156723200,12,2011,4.616246498599439
137126,5,0792165039,"This is one of the best thrillers in recent years.  The story centers on Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) who comes to Italy to befriend Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) and persuade him to come back to the U.S. (at the wishes of Greenleaf's father).  Soon, Ripley becomes immersed in Greenleaf's style and doesn't want to leave.  Identity swapping, lying, and murder ensue.

What's great about the movie is how you identify with Tom Ripley even as he does many evil things.  The story also highlights great truths about social class, gender, and identity.

The cast is exceptional--Matt Damon and Jude Law are the best.  And the look of the film is wonderful.  If you buy/rent the DVD, be sure to check out the commentary by director Anthony Minghella, which is like a film class.

137127,4,0792165039,"I have to start by saying I've never had such a physical reaction to a movie, like I had with this one!  As the film progressed, I found myself sweating profusely, my stomach in knots!  This is all due to the anticipation (or apprehention?) I felt waiting for Tom Ripley to be exposed as a fraud for impersonating his rich former-friend Dickie Greenleaf!  Just when you think Tom will finally fall flat on his face and be completely exposed as a criminal, he lands on his feet.  Either due to lots of luck or his own quick thinking! It's this anticipation/apprehension of waiting to see Ripley's ultimate humilation that had me in knots and sweating on pins and kneedles.

What an excellent actor Matt Damon is, conveying every emotion the sociopath Ripley felt.  From charming  and sweet, to hurt and vulnerable, to ammoral self-preservation.  Jude Law is perfect as spoiled, rich, party/playboy Dickie Greenleaf.  Gwyneth is like-wise perfection as his likeable, clueless girlfriend who ends up knowing more than anyone else (who's left living)!  Philip Seymour-Hoffman, as Dickie's sharp-as-a-tack, obnoxious pal steals the thunder from anyone else in a scene with him!  Hoffman's Freddie is an un-likable smarty who has Tom Ripley pegged from the second he lays eyes on him!  Freddie is street-wise old-money.  His kneedling, sarcastic comments directed at Tom had me watching those scenes over and over again.

The movie as a whole is excellent, but the ending didn't completely satisfy me.  Although I can just imagine what would happen next (to Meredith, who still thinks Tom is Dickie).  I've never read the book the film is based on, I'm tempted to do so.  Hopefully the book ties up some loose strings?",1152748800,2,1712,4.950877192982456
137128,5,0792165039,"Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), a talented but penniless young man, pretends to be a graduate of an elite school while playing piano at an upper-class garden party.  When he is asked to go to Italy to convince Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), the playboy son of a shipping magnate, to return to America, he sees an opportunity to taste the kind of high life that he has always dreamed of.  In Italy, he continues his pretense in order to ingratiate himself with Dickie and his fiancee, Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow).  He becomes infatuated with Dickie and his lifestyle; his desperation to continue this idyllic new life leads him to increasingly desperate measures, ultimately including murder and the complex juggling of identities.

One of the many pleasures of this excellent film is watching the evolution of Ripley's character.  In the beginning, he is likeable.  As his situation deteriorates, we see his horror and panic as he commits crimes he had never anticipated.  We also see his dawning belief, powerfully dramatized at the end, that he can never go back to a time of innocence; he can only go forward, which means maintaining his deception at all costs.  It's a tribute to Damon's performance.",1151798400,3,1191,4.92
137129,5,0792165039,"What makes `The Talented Mr. Ripley' stand apart from most other thrillers is that it's ultimately an extremely smart film.  Not only is the cast superb but the script is brilliant, and that is due to the amazing novel written by Patricia Highsmith in which the film was based.  Set during the 1950's, the film follows Tom Ripley (played with every bit of underlying menace by Matt Damon) as he enters a new life, a life he could only dream about having as his own.

The film starts with Tom, a con-artist, borrowing a Princeton jacket during a Manhattan garden party to play the piano for guests, and he inadvertently strikes up a conversation with an older gentleman who's seeking someone to retrieve his son from Italy.  He offers $1,000 and so Tom plays along, claiming to know this mans son and agrees to fetch his son from his debaucheries life.  Upon arriving in Italy Tom immediately becomes absorbed in the lifestyle this man, Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law in his finest hour), is living.  He attaches himself, to the point of annoyance, to both Dickie and his fiance Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow).  This attachment that borderlines obsession finally climaxes in Dickie claiming Tom should leave, go back to the states.

He's boring.

And with those words Tom kills the man he loves in a fit of rage, and in an attempt to cover it up he assumes the identity of the man he murdered and from that point on the film changes pace to that of a cat and mouse tail and Tom switches between playing a role and living a life.  To cover his tracks Tom tells Marge that Dickie was scared off by her pressure to commit himself in marriage and thus has fled the country.  She doesn't believe it for one minute and she starts to put pieces together, realizing that this man is not the kind hearted fellow he claims to be.  As Tom starts a relationship with a wealthy woman under the alias of Dickie Greenleaf, yet falls in and out of contact with Marge and fellow friends of Dickie who know Tom he has to keep changing his identity and forging letters and his voice in order to stay ahead of the game.

Brilliantly crafted, like a fine sculpture, each frame fits together beautifully and creates a piece of art like none other.  The acting is astonishing, most notably by the two male leads, Jude and Matt.  I will say that I am not a Matt Damon fan, and actually other than this film I feel he's a wasted talent, but here he exuberates every emotion that makes up this madman he embodies.  We feel every emotion that he needs and wants us to feel.  He is pitch-perfect.  Same with Law, who plays the playboy type brilliantly.  His constant growing annoyance with Tom is seen all over his face.  In scenes like when he walks in on Tom wearing his clothing or when Tom asks him if they could share a bath, Jude's face says more than his words ever could.

Gwyneth was another delight, as the confused and suspicious fiance of the deceased she plays the misunderstood yet defiantly insistent card brilliantly, convincing you that she's either 1) crazy or 2) right on the money.

Philip Seymour Hoffman and Kate Blanchett both have very small roles, but there roles are strong none the less, and they deliver each line effortlessly.  This was my first glimpse at Hoffman and I'm almost tempted to say he deserved that Oscar nod over Law only because he was PERFECT in the few moments he graced the screen.  My favorite scene in the film involves Hoffman's character catching Tom in the act of watching Marge and Dickie make love on their boat.  ""Tommy, Tommy, are you peeping Tommy?""  It's brilliant.

So I've praised this movie quite a bit and I hope that my review has helped convince you to 1) see this movie if you haven't already or 2) if you have seen it and can't decide whether or not to purchase it, maybe this review helped remind you how purchase worthy a film like this really is.  Kudos to everyone involved, from the brilliant acting already raved about to the wonderful direction Anthony Minghella took while making this exceptionally extraordinary film.

137130,5,0792165039,"There are some differences between this film and the Patricia Highsmith novel it is based on. Some major changes to plot have been made, yet the intricacy of the original is not lost...in fact the screenplay and direction succeeds in inducing a sense of almost visual dizziness at the complex double life that Ripley leads and which constantly comes within a hair's breadth of unravelling. While the strengths of the film medium are successfully exploited, its unsurprising that the shocking sense of identification with a cold blooded killer which an intimite novel can provide is somewhat missing here. In fact Mat Damon's Ripley here is less of a psychopath and more of a sad loser that somehow blunders his way into an orgy of murder. Still, the superb playing of the leads together with a truly outstanding film score might well succeed in leaving you with an unhealthily Highsmithian sense of sympathy for the devil.",1141948800,2,922,4.95483870967742
137131,5,0792165039,"There are some homosexual themes.  However, this is an unequivocal five star movie.

Outstanding in every respect.",1140825600,4,114,5.647058823529412
137132,5,0792165039,"The original source for the screenplay of The Talented Mr. Ripley comes from the American novelist Patricia Highsmith who is known for her psychological thrillers including her infamous Stranger on the Train, which Hitchcock brilliantly adapted in 1951.  Highsmith's upbringing was bordered with strained and difficult relationships, as her parents divorced shortly after her birth, she had a strong hatred towards her stepfather, and a love-hate bond with the mother.  Shy, withdrawn, and eccentric were some of the characteristics that followed her mysterious life style.  Yet, there were several rumors flowing around her that indicated that she was gay.  However, she remained single throughout her life while preferring the company of animals.  With this in mind and her early interest in psychology, it is easy to see how she can create a gentle, caring, and passionate psychopath such as Tom Ripley.

The first book that Highsmith wrote about Ripley was the Edgar Allan Poe Award winner The Talented Mr. Ripley, which was followed by an additional four adventures.  The first cinematic adaptation of this book came in 1960 through Plein Soleil directed by Ren Clment with Alain Delon cast as Tom Ripley.  Almost four decades later director Anthony Minghella returns to the first book of Ripley to which he applied the lengthy title The Mysterious Yearning Secretive Sad Lonely Troubled Confused Loving Musical Gifted Intelligent Beautiful Tender Sensitive Haunted Passionate Talented Mr. Ripley.  The many descriptive adjectives of the complete film title provide much for the audience to ponder about Tom Ripley's persona.  However, viewing of the film will answer some of these questions while it will certainly instigate additional bewilderment.  Yet, the concisely brief title The Talented Mr. Ripley offers equally much mystery, as its lengthy companion.

The opening montage opens with an ominously sounding lullaby that accompanies the sharply edged and fragmented imagery of Tom Ripley (Matt Damon).  His face emerges fractured similar to the reflection of a broken mirror, which symbolically might suggest a hint of Ripley's broken persona.  Simultaneously, the dawdling lullaby's agonizing lyric echoes in the background through the words:

""From the silence, from the night,

comes a distant lullaby.

Soul surrendering your soul,

the heart in you not whole.

For love, for love, walked out,

cast into the dark,

branded with a mark,

of shame of Cain.""

These poetic words bring about the notion of jealousy from Cain's slaying of his brother Abel, as God preferred Abel's sacrifice to his gift.  It also reflects upon the punishment God threw on Cain for killing his brother, as Cain was doomed to wander the earth for an eternity.  Analogously, it presents a strong indication of Ripley's meaningless and aimless existence, as he seeks something better that he finds in the Greenleaf family through maybe wealth, status, elegance, culture, love, belonging, and more.

Eventually, the opening montage bridges into reality through Ripley's flashback voice-over-narration explaining how he wished he could erase his actions of the past by not having borrowed a jacket.  This, as the final verse of the ill-omened lullaby pours out over an aristocratic audience on an extraordinarily blossoming terrace facing over the New York's Central Park.  The borrowed jacket that Ripley refers to has a Princeton crest on the chest, which Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) recognizes.  Assumingly, Mr. Greenleaf believes that Ripley is an alumnus of the prestigious Ivy League university where his son Dickey (Jude Law) also attended, while Ripley simply borrowed the jacket in order to fill in for an injured pianist.  An interesting notion emerges here, as the audience will undoubtedly assume that Matt Damon's character is Ripley, but for all that the audience is allowed to learn, Ripley might only be the assumed alter ego of the pianist whom he pretended to be at the party.  Thus, it is interesting to know that Ripley's true identity might never have been revealed in the beginning.

Instead, Ripley (if this is his true name) works as a bathroom attendant at the New York City Opera where he constantly faces the upper classes lavish wastefulness and their taste in the finer things of life.  After having worn the Princeton jacket, Ripley has an invitation to meet with the prosperous shipbuilder Mr. Greenleaf, which allows him a chance to reach the things he much desires.  It also brings him to Italy where he is supposed to convince Dickey to return home.  The trip leads Ripley into a completely new life style without responsibilities and a lot of squandering.  In Italy, he also meets Dickey's fiance Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow) and the lone traveler Meredith Logue (Cate Blanchett).  Everything seems far better than he expected, as he carefully manipulates his way into Dickey's world by becoming his confidant.  It comes to a point where the friendship begins to turn into sexual overtones, as Ripley refers to Dickey to look like Superman and in a later scene wants to join him in the bathtub.  Overtly, Minghella enhances the strong emotion within the scenes through carefully planed and symbolic mise-en-scene, which supports the homosexual atmosphere between the two men.  However, when Dickey meets up with an old friend, Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the honeymoon comes to an end, as Ripley no longer is the focal point of Dickey's existence.

Anxiety, emotional soreness, and rejection set Ripley in a new direction where his neediness surfaces along with his fear of loosing what he just has acquired.  Strong feelings lead him into sad and dismal thoughts rippling through his persona, as notions of jealously, aimlessness, and rootlessness emerge.  A rift becomes noticeable through their differences, as Ripley loves the old and traditional while Dickey embraces the fresh and invigorating.  Musically, it is especially obvious, as Ripley worships classical and opera when Dickey is a Jazz freak.  Yet, Ripley desires to mend the fracture between them in order to keep the life he has grown accustomed to, but Dickey has already made up his mind.  In a haze of passion and fear, the slash of an oar blended in blood ends their relationship, which urges Ripley to instinctively make a drastic change to hold onto his ambition of an affluent lifestyle.  It slowly turns into a nightmarish journey for Ripley, as he finds himself cornered and must play his cards well in order to find a way out.  However, complexity of his dilemma rises beyond his imagination, as past and present becomes too much involved with one another.

What makes the film even more intriguing is the intricate psychology of the villain Ripley, and much of this rests within Highsmith's rich writing.  However, Jude Law's Oscar nominated character also plays a strong roll into why Ripley appears naively, as Dickie's persona is far from innocent.  Dickie, a sociable smooth talker, appears to have no scruples, as an example, he intentionally seeks the attention of women for a bout in lustful activity without concern for his future wife.  In a way Dickie is a sociopath, as he is deceitful, reckless, and impulsive while also displaying complete indifference when hurting someone.  In a way both Ripley and Dickie are alike, yet they are very unlike.  Ripley has strong feelings for others while Dickie seems to miss them all together with the exception of those for himself.  Through these two characters, the audience meets a fascinating relationship between two men, which turns out to be a lethal affair.

In closing, The Talented Mr. Ripley presents a poignantly disturbing tale with a Hitchcockian atmosphere enhanced by its visual and aural elements.  Visually, the film applies mise-en-scene purposefully in order to elevate the message with the scene, but it also has an artistic component through the use of reflections in mirrors and the framing of each scene.  In combination with the outstanding cast, these visuals become even more potent, as the strong performances elevate the moment within the scenes.  The final scene portrays extraordinary strong visuals that will embed themselves in the long-term memory.  Yet, it is within the aural experience where the film might hide some of its true gems, as play with both jazz from the 1950s and classical music intentionally bring out the personalities of the characters.  It also augments the emotional situations such as when Ripley weeps in the Opera scene.  Ripley cries, because he relates to the main character in the duel scene from Eugene Onegin who is a fabrication of several fictitious heroes.  In addition, the film succeeds brilliantly in capturing the psychological shadows of Highsmith's fictitious villain while it might also suggest that some of her own persona might rest within our talented Mr. Ripley.",1140393600,5,8914,5.1988795518207285

Part of the problem with this well-written, well-directed, well-shot, well-cast and well-acted film, and the reason so many people hate it, seems to be that it contains not a single worthwhile or even moderately admirable or sympathetic  character. The story is vacuous and sick. It was just great when the shallow, selfish, useless Jude Law person, Dickie, got done in; and even better when the totally repellent Freddie collected his head. But we are asked to empathize with a text-book sociopath, who fits the clinical descriptions of the type to a T. The only real difference between Ripley, Freddie and Dickie is that Ripley is poor and the other two are rich. Empathizing with Ripley is like empathizing with Hitler --- no doubt he had reasons for what he did. The girls are both nice enough but basically wishy-washy social cyphers, the father is rigid, and the cops are either hopelessly stupid or hopelessly incompetent. The gay musician is creepy and wet beyond belief. Incidentally, the reason he has to be terminated, since one reviewer asked, is that Tom can't afford to have him blowing his cover with the second girl, whose name escapes me just now, and needs to masquerade as Greenleaf at least until the end of the voyage. Then he'll no doubt assume some new identity, since he thinks well on his feet. But it all adds up to more of a case-book study than an engaging drama, and a large proportion of viewers probably feel that they are just glad to be quit of the whole unedifying mess. Also, there is something about this icky tale that makes it easily forgettable. I watched it about 3 months ago, and when I came to watch it again I realised I'd forgotten everything about it: it invites mental erasure.

137146,5,0792165039,"This is as good as films come and a wonderful period piece of 1950s Europe.  Directed and writen by Anthony Minghella, the director of The English Patient and Cold Mountain, Mr. Ripley involves the exploits of Tom Ripley, played to chilling perfection by Matt Damon, who initally travels from his native Manhattan to Venice to retrieve Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), the spoiled son of a multi-millionaire.  Tom becomes enamored by Dickie's illustrious livestyle--and perhaps with Dickie as well--but when Dickie tires of Tom, Tom murders Dickie and passes himself off as the millionaire.

What makes this movie so wonderful--besides the incredable writing, beautiful cinematography, homoerotic relationship between Matt Damon and Jude Law, and the occasional shots of the two star's backsides--is the stellar cast.  Matt Damon is dead on as Tom Ripley.  He is boyish, charming, and fragile yet sinister and capible of anything.  Sociopaths haven't been played this well since Anthony Perkins in Psycho.  What makes Damon's performance more fun is how you never know everything about the character.  Is he gay? Is he straight? Is he bi? Is he even aware of what he is doing? Does he feel remorse? You never know.  The whole character is an act and an illusion who fools both the other characters and the audience.

 Jude Law also turns out a star-making performance as Dickie Greenleaf.  Jude's a charming man's man and a throwback to the leading men of the 50s and 60s, so he fits this role like a glove, and as we know now he can identify with the womanizing side of his character.  Nevertheless, Jude's charisma and charm make it easy to believe why Matt Damon's character would be so taken by him.

The rest of the cast--led by Gweneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, and Philip Seymour Hoffman--is amazing as well.  The Talented Mr. Ripley is a sexy, provocitive, superbly acted nail-biter.  Hitchcock would be proud to see a suspense film like this.",1133308800,8,1946,4.978328173374613

137151,4,0792165039,"Patricia Highsmith's first novel of the Tom Ripley series, (five novels in all) The Talented Mr. Ripley, created an anti-hero that no one had ever seen before. The novel and film presents the story through Ripley's eyes, and even though the man is capable of terrible acts, and commits these terrible crimes relentlessly to attain his own aims, we continue to maintain sympathy for the character; we want him to get away with it, and he usually does. Anyone who has read the novel will agree that Anthony Minghella's screenplay remained faithful to the original, veering off on only a few points, however managed to achieve the same tension, disturbance and suspense, also leaving the audience wondering, after Ripley's final hideous crime, what will this sociopath do next.

The film and novel introduces the beginnings of a sociopath's career. For all we know, killing Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) brutally in the boat was Ripley's first crime. In the film it is almost depicted as an accident, emotions out of control, perhaps self-defence, but Mr. Ripley never acts without a goal in mind, there's purpose in his actions. In this case, coming from a lowly status in society and finally tasting the good life, was something Tom Ripley discovered he couldn't do without, thus, similar to most sociopaths, will commit any act in order to achieve their particular ends, including murder.

One of the more enjoyable aspects of this film comes from Tom Ripley's efforts to become or assume the identity of the man he has murdered. The man's talent lies in his ability to impersonate just about anybody and an amazing skill to spin a tale on his feet - he's convincing liar. Identity is the central theme of this story, but also the way in which we can re-invent ourselves from being nothing to being someone. Even though Ripley has come from lowly beginnings, he is self educated, plays and appreciates opera and classical music and the finer things in life. He is a man of taste, but it is a learned taste, an acquired sensibility. In the film we see Ripley constantly reading Shakespeare, learning Italian, teaching himself about jazz, etc. He is continually improving himself, which of course is admirable, but at bottom, Ripley is just a thug. He's a paradox: we want to like the man, we want him to get away with everything he does, yet at the same time we are appalled at his methods. Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley was truly unique and Matt Damon wonderfully portrays the young version of this character in the film.

This is a beautifully shot film of southern and northern Italy accurately depicting the country in the late 1950's. Minghella ensured time and care was taken with every frame and this certainly shows throughout the picture. The soundtrack is also a work of art including wonderful classic pieces, opera and 50's jazz.

As an avid reader and re-reader of all the Ripley novels, this film only added to the story's appeal, and motivation to crack its covers once again.",1112745600,35,2990,4.845401174168297

Mid-century Italy is lensed so beautifully here you'll be calling a travel agent.  Bikes on narrow streets.  A flock of birds rising in a roomy town square.  Heaped fruit.  Boats leaning in the wind on the sun-kissed coast.

Matt Damon plays the lead character, Tom Ripley, a closeted gay man whose self-hatred has fueled a talent to mimic others, to become them even, to find the place where admiration crosses into imitation and then into immolation.  In short he destroys those he draws creepily close to.

Jude Law's Dickie barely tolerates Ripley-the-tagalong after Dickie's worried dad sends Tom to retrieve him from the coast of Italy where he's living on his looks and charisma, enjoying jazz and sailing on the family dole.  Tom quickly envies Dickie's life, which seems to pass with dreamlike ease and includes a blonde beautiful woman (Gwenyth Paltrow in a flawless performance).  Dickie does tolerate Tom despite his seeming mundanity, however, because he senses a powerful and flattering obsession directed at him.

The movie, suffused in Italian sunlight, eventually reveals frightening darkness in the psyches of BOTH its male leads.  If Tom is a Borderline Personality, then Dickie is at least Histrionic, incapable of maintaining interest in anyone or anything for very long; neither character, then, has a secure core identity.  Sex and death are always interesting, so the erotic scene of Tom and Dickie playing chess with the latter nude in a bathtub and the violent scene of confrontation on a rowboat give two fine actors a chance to plumb intense emotions, which they do with great skill and sensitivity.

Damon's Ripley mimicks speaking voices, signatures, identities, and in one chilling scene the soft expressive singing voice of jazz great Chet Baker.  By this sunny film's end, the darkness of a closing door incrementally fills the screen as we realize the full depths of the sociopathic nature of Tom Ripley, now on the run from the police.

Viewers will encounter great acting from the principals (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Matt Damon, Jude Law, & Gwenyth Paltrow) and great direction from Anthony Minghella--who inserts a darkening character study and an effective thriller about shifting identities into a sunny sensual Mediterranean setting and a swirl of golden age jazz.

At once disconcerting and stylish, ""Ripley"" isn't just a good movie but a masterwork.",1112486400,15,2493,5.19
137153,5,0792165039,"Sometimes you love a movie so much you almost can't put into words why.  ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is one of those films, something haunting, something that stays with the viewer long after the final credits roll.

Matt Damon plays Tom Ripley, a penniless young New Yorker who lives in squalor and works as a men's room attendant; playing piano provides his only real joy.  A gig as a substitute accompanist leads to an offer from shipping magnate Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn): for the princely sum of $1000, Tom heads off to Italy to try to corral the millionaire's renegade son Dickie (Jude Law) and persuade him to return home.

Once in Italy, however, Tom immediately falls under the spell of Dickie's ex-pat life of luxury and indolent pleasure.  Dickie has pretty much everything: looks, charm, money, nice clothes, gorgeous digs, a sailboat, pretty fiancee Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow), and a gaggle of admiring friends.  With a mix of guile and well-timed lies, Tom quickly ingratiates himself into the lives of Dickie and Marge, indulging in some light-hearted hedonism.  But there's a current of darkness just beneath the sunny dolce vita, both in Tom's and Dicke's personalities.  The tension between them escalates slowly but steadily, and the viewer knows that sooner or later, the powder keg is going to explode.

In the two ""Bourne"" films, Damon plays a professional killer who's stumbling back toward the light; in ""Ripley,"" he plays a fairly ordinary guy (a ""nobody,"" he calls himself) spiraling down into darkness: the journey, like a train wreck, is awful, but still somehow mesmerizing.  Given Ripley's backstory, it's easy to empathize with him despite his immorality, and as with Jason Bourne, the viewer ends up rooting for a morally ambiguous character.  Damon is simply aces here, bringing a lot of subtlety and depth to his insanely clever but deeply insecure character.  Ripley's extreme neediness fairly leaps off the screen: even more than desiring wealth and luxury, he yearns to be loved, accepted, and well-regarded by others, but given his devious machinations, that's pretty much never going to happen.

Damon has to be at the top of his game, because Jude Law gives him a run for the money at every turn.  If Dickie were merely a shallow cad, the movie wouldn't work half as well as it does: the character's appeal isn't that he's wealthy and gorgeous and sexy, it's that he's funny and charming and has a way of making everyone feel special.  But he's mercurial and fickle--in one of the film's most revealing scenes, Marge cautions Tom, ""The thing with Dickie--it's like the sun shines on you, and it's glorious.  Then he forgets you, and it's suddenly very cold.""  Every character wants Dickie in some way, they all crave his attention, and even when he's not around, everyone talks about him.  Like Damon, Law brings a lot of nuance to a character who isn't necessarily the nicest guy you'd ever meet, balancing a very fine line between desirable and despicable.

Paltrow is also terrific as the good-hearted Marge--the character lacks real complexity, but Paltrow nevertheless imbues her with a lot of warmth and sincerity.  Over the course of the film, her sunny ebullience begins to dim as she slowly realizes the extent of Ripley's evil, and Paltrow conveys Marge's confusion and anger and fear in a way that's never anything less than convincing.  Her wardrobe provides a wonderful indication of the character's mental state: as the light and joy are sucked out of Marge, she grows more groomed and coiffed and covered up, so that by her final scene, she's practically encased in armor, an apt emotional metaphor for the cold, empty shell she's become.

The supporting performances are likewise terrific.  Philip Seymour Hoffman delivers a knockout turn as Dickie's odious friend Freddie Miles, the only character who sees right through Ripley immediately.  Cate Blanchett is similarly strong as Meredith Logue, a well-meaning but vapid socialite who always seems to turn up at exactly the wrong moment--like Freddie, she constantly threatens to expose Ripley's duplicity.  Blanchett's performance is remarkable given Meredith's almost complete lack of dimension.  I particularly liked Jack Davenport's charming, humorous turn as Peter Smith-Kingsley, probably the most innocent of Ripley's victims.

In addition to a great story and stellar performances from its cast, Ripley boasts some of the nicest possible visuals.  Italy in the 1950s provides a sumptuous backdrop for the unfolding drama, from the splendors of Venice and Rome to sun-drenched beaches and postcard-pretty fishing villages.  Director Anthony Minghella employs some breathtaking imagery--the use of mirrors and reflections throughout the film is subtle and effective, and there's a shot of the Madonna rising from the sea that's used as masterful foreshadowing.  Also top-rate is the music--not only Gabriel Yared's creepy score, but the music that the characters listen to and perform, which brings added dimension to their feelings and personalities.

Rarely do the elements of film-making come together as beautifully as they do in this movie: it's by turns romantic, dramatic, funny, and suspenseful; the acting is top-rate; the visuals and music all support and enhance the characters and story.  While not gratuitously violent, it's not for the faint of heart, either: ""Ripley"" is dark and twisted and ambiguous, its conclusion deeply unsettling.  This isn't a film for viewers who like happy endings and pat resolutions.  But if you're looking for a film with real substance and no easy answers, I recommend ""Ripley"" without reservation.",1111536000,23,5668,5.178728070175438
137154,4,0792165039,"Three and a half, if only I could give that.

Matt Damon is positively sinister; psychologically conflicted and troubled, yes, but also sinister. Jude Law is cavalier, mocking, and spoiled (he's a little too good at this kind of role). Smaller, supporting roles here create the backdrop for the story and how things unravel for Damon's Tom Ripley. Cate Blanchett plays the small role of Meredith, to whom Ripley has passed himself off as Law's Dickie Greenleaf. Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as the sarcastic, suspicious and smarmy Freddy who does not quite trust Ripley, as he insinuates himself into Greenleaf's comfortable lifestyle. Greenleaf is so deeply ingrained in his own hedonistic lifestyle and lack of concern for others that he uses Ripley and does not think to see Ripley as a predator using him. Nor does Greenleaf's needy, simpering fiance Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) see Ripley as predatory at first.

The film is tastefully done, full of suspense and psychological tautness. Anthony Minghella delivers another excellent story coupled with amazing cinematography (almost distracting from the story it is so beautiful).",1110758400,6,1137,5.311111111111111
137165,5,0792165039,"Anthony Minghella's THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is a gorgeously filmed experience, bringing to life Patricia Highsmith's acclaimed novel.  Although it was Jude Law who got an Oscar nomination, the movie wouldn't work at all without the incredibly gifted Matt Damon.  Damon's Tom Ripley is a cornucopia of emotions, both likeable and despicable.  His desire to become Dickie is rooted in a miserable sense of self-loathing, and an opportunistic personality evidenced early on in his uncanny ability to imitate other people's voices and also their handwriting.  Law does a very good job as Dickie, showing us his shallow side, his awe with Ripley and eventually his jealousy and boredom.  Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Dickie's ""woman"" or plaything, and gets to show a great range in her emotional makeup.  Cate Blanchett is as always wonderful, but not given a whole lot to do; Jack Davenport who was so good in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" does a fine job as Peter, the one person who truly loves Tom, and suffers for this love.

THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is indeed a ""dark"" film, and one cannot condone Ripley's actions.  Damon is so good, however, that by the end of the movie, we have a sense of compassion for him, in spite of what he's done.  Handsomely capturing the mood of 1950's Italy, replete with a wonderful score and cinematography, THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is an exceptionally well done thriller.",1110672000,,1399,4.8940677966101696

Oh yeah, the movie. I was kidding up there. It is actually a pretty watchable movie about a reprehensible character who pursues then attempts to replace Dickie Greenleaf (our Mr Law). The character, Tom Ripley, who is played by Matt Damon, is an interesting study but the motivation for his behavior is not at all defined. This is in contrast to Dickie's motivations which are positively flayed in front of our eyes. Overall, the movie was a bit disturbing but marred by either the lack of details about Tom's motivations or the inability of Matt Damon to project whatever exposition there was. The sets were really well done as far as I can tell (never having travelled in Europe in the 50's). Very beautiful, very evocative. The acting is good throughout with a notable nods to Gwyneth Paltrow who excels in these kind of films and Jack Davenport as the sweet and loving Peter. The homoerotic content was a surprise to me but what do you expect, it's Jude Law after all. Oh, to dip MY fingers!!",1108166400,2,1159,4.599033816425121

137168,4,0792165039,"""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is a subtle and sometimes elegant thriller, of course, it helps that the movie has such a talented cast that includes Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Cate Blanchett and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, all of them carefully directed by Anthony Minghella.

The strongest points in this movie are the cast of course, and the story. The plot of this film revolves around Tom Ripley, a very clever guy whose specialty is to assume other people's identities. Soon we learn that Ripley has a lot of hidden talents and secrets, most of the time Ripley is using his intelligence to get away with his tricks and scams, but even though he is an elegant criminal, he is also a very disturbed man that once in a while allows his inner demons to dominate him.

""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is a showcase to Matt Damon (by the way, he is a better actor and chooses better roles than his untalented fella, Ben Affleck), but the rest of the cast is equally impressive. When the movie came out, we all knew that Gwyneth Paltrow was more than just a pretty blonde girl, she is a fine actress and this movie is another example of her acting talent. ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" also was the introduction of Jude Law to the big audiences, and the supporting cast includes talented people like Cate Blanchett and Phillip Seymour Hoffman.

The locations in this movie are beautiful, and the director Anthony Minghella and the cinematographer John Seale used the beautiful backgrounds to create beautiful visuals. ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is a clever film and its very interesting to see the story of these characters.",1104624000,2,1615,4.740213523131673
137169,1,0792165039,"Don't buy this movie.  If you've seen it, than remedy that problem by seeing Plein Soleil: Purple Noon (1960, directed by Rene Clement), the original Talented Mr. Ripley movie, and reading the book by Patricia Highsmith.

First of all, this version undermines the greatness of the original film.  Just on an asthetic (sp?) note, Seeing Matt Damon in the role of Tom after seeing Alain Delon in the same role is tragic.  Jude Law in the role of Dickie doesn't live up to Maurice Ronet's acting.  Law's Dickie is not nearly as commanding a personality.  He has no edge.  He isn't distant enough with Marge.  Where Ronet seems to be playing a cruel game with Marge, Law seems to actually love her.  There doesn't seem to be any good reason to kill Law, wheras Ronet comes off as a complete arse.  As for Tom, Damon's Tom is more needy and soppy than Delon's Tom.  Then there's still the fact that the likes of Damon was cast in a role once graced by a gorgeous actor.  Clement's Purple Noon is supensful and the cinematography is beautiful.  I found myself fast-forwarding through this version.

Secondly, the director of this version doesn't just not stick to the book, he destroys the book.  Highsmith's novel is excellent and it pains me to think that some people have seen this movie and think it's actually a representation of what they'd get if they read the book.  Clement's version doesn't exactly follow the book word for word either, but it sticks to the story (except for the end, keep in mind that this film was made in 1960)pretty well.  It's still a wonderful movie.  I usually hate film adaptations of books I like...
This director, Minghella, adds way too many things and scenes that have nothing to do with the original story or the original characters.  I also hate the way he's changed the characters, especially Tom.  To begin with, the Tom in this movie is a pianist who apparently went to Princeton... Princeton?  A pianist?!  This does not seem the sort of man you'd find in seedy bars, trying to avoid cops or the type who'd make money by forging signitures or defrauding the government.  The real Tom wouldn't bring Shakespeare with him to Italy either.  Minghella's Tom is too distinguished and cultured.  Also, I remember in one scene, Tom is hesitant to spend Greenleaf's money.  The ""real"" Tom wouldn't care.  The real Tom would love spending someone else's money!  The worst thing about this Tom is that he seems to develop a sort of love for Dickie.  When he kills Dickie, it's because they've gotten into a fight.  It seems like a crime of passion, not a premeditated act of murder for money.

Overall, this movie is a horrible remake of a fantastic book and a great movie.  I have to admit that I gave up after a while out of disgust, but I saw what I needed to see in order to write this review.

137170,5,0792165039,"When picking out films to see, I usually gravitate toward the ""small"" independent type of film usually avoiding the larger ""major"" productions.  Thus, I avoided ""the Talented Mr. Ripley"" up until recently.  My mistake!  ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is outstanding and has, to me, everything a movie should have to make it the ""complete film experience""-great script and direction, great acting, wonderful sound tract and beautiful cinematography.  This film has it all!
The acting, by all of the actors, is superb.  Matt Damon, as Tom Ripley is outstanding.  He portrays a very complicated character believably.  At no time are you aware that he is acting.  This character does things that are, indeed, despicable; however, due to the acting skills of Damon, I actually liked the guy and felt deep sympathy and empathy for him and for his desire to be someone else
 (I think we all have been there-at least I have-fortunately all of us don't do what Tom Ripley does, in the film, to achieve our wishes).  To me the last scene of the film is fantastic and heart breaking due to Matt Damon giving a gut wrenching performance--the character Tom has finally found someone to love, and has found someone that accepts him as himself but due to past deeds and the need to keep his past hidden, he has to kill the person that could have brought him love and happiness.  As usual, Jude Law, as the playboy and errant son Dickie, is awesome.  He plays a cad but due to his acting skills you, like this cad.  Gwenyth Platrow gives a ""knock-em dead"" performance, as Dickie's girlfriend starting out as a plastic rich ""air-head"" and ending up as the only one that really knows what has happened to Dickie when he has disappeared and becoming a completely different person because of that knowledge.  Her knock down drag out with the character Tom is great.  Cate Blanchett plays a socialite- debutante-type wonderfully.  The acting alone would have made ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" a great film; however, there is more!
The film has one of the best sound tracts that I've ever heard.  The sound tract makes use of Renaissance Church music, so-called ""Classical music"" ""cool"" jazz and one of my favorites I (if not my favorite) pop standards-""My Funny Valentine"" sung wonderfully by Matt Damon.  The sound tract is gorgeous!  What impressed me the most is that Matt Damon and Jude Law took the time to learn to really play the instruments that they were suppose to be playing in the film-Damon, the piano and Law the saxophone.  One of my favorite scenes is in the smoked filled American-jazz nightclub--fabulous.
The recreation of 1950-era Italy is great and it is shot beautifully.

But I have to say (with much regret) that in the long run this movie was a big dissapointment for me. The main reason being that I felt that after Tom Ripley had committed his first murder, there was no suspense left in the movie. There was no mystery involved, you know who the killer is, who is killed, and basically every important piece of information in the first half of the movie. Honestly, I found myself badly wanting to turn off the movie during the last forty-five minutes because I didn't care anymore what happened to the characters.

This is a good movie if you just like to watch actors act though. Matt Damon is incredible as Tom Ripley, and manages to truely understand the character, and Jude Law and Gwenneth Paltrow play wonderfully together as Dickie and Marge. But even that was not enough to make this movie a captivating thriller, or even give it some suspense.

137173,5,0792165039,"In the opening scene, Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), a nice, but awkward, young man accompanies a singer at a private recital and rubs shoulders with high society, some members of whom see his (borrowed) Princeton blazer and instantly ""adopt"" him.  Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn), a shipping magnate, soon hires him and sends him to Italy to locate his Princeton-educated son, Dickie, a playboy and wastrel who does not want to return to New York.  Though engaged to Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), a novelist, Dickie remains an independent spirit, and it is not long before he and Tom join forces at the financial expense of his father.

Tom's greed soon gets the better of him, however, and he finds himself playing far more complex roles, with murder and mayhem following in his wake.  Matt Damon is outstanding as Tom, playing him as an innocent and socially clumsy nerd who gradually gains polish and expensive tastes.  As Tom's ambition grows and he clearly loses his grip, he is so clever that the viewer is torn between wanting him to succeed and wanting him to fail.  Jude Law (nominated for an Oscar as Best Actor for this role) plays Dickie as a spoiled playboy who has never been required to obey limits, but his vulnerability is obvious and rather touching, and Law's performance is especially memorable.

Paltrow, the most emotionally mature of all the main characters, shows that she loves Dickie and believes that somehow she can tame him.  Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Freddie Miles, plays Dickie's malicious and arrogant friend as a somewhat older, but just as smarmy twit as he was in School Ties.  Cate Blanchett has a minor role in which she plays an heiress (and Gwyneth Paltrow look-alike), and though the role is small, Blanchett gives it the importance it deserves as a significant plot element.

Director Anthony Minghella, who also wrote the (Academy Award-nominated) screenplay from the novel by Patricia Highsmith, has superb control of pacing and suspense, never allowing Damon to appear as evil as he is and keeping the viewer (almost) on his side.  Cinematographer John Seale shows the Italian countryside of the 1950s to its most glorious advantage, with exterior and interior scenes along the coast and in Venice, Rome, and San Remo.  Filled with music, including opera and jazz, the film includes fine new (Academy Award-nominated) music by Gabriel Yared, and the stunning final scenes, so apt, leave the viewer breathless.

Anyone with an interest in Italy (or in jazz)  should enjoy this film;the photography is excellent and includes the Naples area,San Remo, Rome, and Venice. There are several scenes in jazz clubs with the 2 leads doing what would today be called karaoke.  In addition, the story is a challenging one about a sociopath with a brilliant criminal mind who  attempts to outfox his associates by assuming a dual identity.  Ripley ""believes in telling the truth whenever possible,""he tells his  new Italian friends right at the outset.  That truth is as follows:
he would ""rather be a fake somebody than a real nobody."" His talents include: ""forgery, lies, and impersonation.""  He uses them all after telling his associates straight out this is the way he behaves.  The result is a thriller/comedy that will keep you guessing. The viewer, like his victims, tends to succumb to Ripley's many charms and thus to empathize with him. He does not look like a criminal or a scoundrel. Dickie and his girlfriend Marge are the first victims, but there are others as the plot unfolds.  Ripley's first lie among many is that he was a classmate of Dickie's at Princeton. To this end, he learns as much as he can about jazz. He continues with this lie until he has befriended them.
 Eventually Ripley ends up killing people and then must cover his acts with alibis and quick thinking, assuming simultaneously the identity of both Dickie, his first victim, and himself--just as he said he would. He accuses Dickie of murdering Silvana, an Italian girl,another lie.  He also must hoodwink Marge, most notably,who was about to marry Dickie; the Italian police, by using Dickie's passport as a fake i.d. to rent an apartment, and a number of other relatively subordinate characters. Marge eventually catches on, but it is too late since Ripley has already gained Dickie's inheritance. I found this an entertaining and stylish thriller.

Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law looking more healthy and tanned than I've ever seen him) is a spoiled, indulgent brat who wants to drift through the rest of his life spending daddy's money.

Matt Damon leads an All-Hollywood Under-40 cast, including Jude Law, Ms. Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, and Phillip Seymore Hoffman (reprising his obnoxious spoiled brat from ""Scent of a Woman,"" with his arrogance on steroids) in one of his most convincing performances to date.
Set in the 1950's, ""Ripley"" perfectly captures the look and feel of the period through rich costumes and fabulous sets -- director Anthony Minghella uses the same voluptuous direction that he used to such great effect in ""The English Patient.""  But there are elements of subversion in the movie that match Ripley's subversive, evil soul -- the rise of jazz (""noise,"" as one character derisively calls it), characters who do nothing but spend their parents' fortunes, and homosexuality and adultery tearing at the rigid social fabric of the times all mirror Thomas Ripley's unnerving ability to manipulate the truth to his own ends.
Ripley is not content to be the best person he can be -- Ripley wants to be the best person that someone else could be.  In this case, it's Dickie Greenleaf (Law -- fiendishly handsome), heir to a shipping fortune and ladies' man extraordinaire.  Ripley is sent to Italy by the elder Greenleaf to retrieve his son, idling away on the beach with his girlfriend Marge (Paltrow).  Teaching himself jazz and inventing stories of schooldays at Princeton, Ripley soon charms his way into Dickie's house.
Ripley knows that the key to being a great liar is to tell the truth as much as possible and allow others to draw their own conclusions.  This takes great wit and timing, and Ripley pulls it off fabulously.  For a while, things could not be better, but soon the impulsive Dickie tires of the ever-present Ripley, whose attachment to Dickie goes beyond mere friendship into unsettling territories.  This leads to a horrifying boat trip where the two Ripley-proclaimed ""brothers"" speak truths that probably should have gone unsaid.
Ripley finds himself caught up in the world of his own making, and the lies he has spun threaten to ensnare him even as he uses them to break free from his former anonymous life.  Delicately balancing new lies and capitalizing on what is, to our modern eyes, a quaintly obsolete communications system (my God, they actually write letters!), Ripley eventually finds himself living the good life in a wonderfully decorated Roman penthouse.
As good a liar as Ripley is, he can't prevent some from figuring out his various lies and secrets.  And this is where the movie really gets dark -- Ripley is a man filled with rage, and that rage can lead to gruesome results.
Ripley is a man of considerable talents and appetites.  His hunger for acceptance and for love -- there is virtually nobody in the film whom Ripley does not seduce -- is exceeded only by his instinct for self-preservation.  Even Ripley is horrified by what he is capable of, and the climactic scene leaves no doubt that for all his talents, Ripley is not someone you ever want to meet.
""Ripley"" achieves a lot of its effect through implication, and the films most charged scenes, whether violent or sexual, are actually quite restrained in what is actually shown on-screen.  But like ""Pulp Fiction,"" the scenes are perhaps even more powerful for not showing exactly what happens, but by their implications.  In that sense, the entire movie is an implication, a set-up for future stories (there are other ""Ripley"" stories) involving our favorite murderous impersonator.  I hope that Hollywood can pull it together to make another installment with Damon as the lead -- he nails it.",1088380800,11,3672,4.957654723127036

137201,5,0792165039,"The Talented Mr.  Ripley begins with Tom Ripley playing piano among wealthy and privileged people.  It's a pattern that carries throughout the movie-  Tom wanting something he can't have by pretending to be something he's not.  Everything after that shows us Tom's life as it really is.  He's a nobody, someone forced onto the fringes of society by circumstances beyond his control.  He lives a life not of quiet desperation but smoldering desperation.  Through a series of events, Tom finds himself in a tense gamble that just keeps getting more and more tense.  The gamble is very interesting, but the real genius of the film lies in the way Tom and those around him are portrayed.  Tom is a sociopath but you begin to feel sympathy for him when he is contrasted against Dickie Greenleaf.  Dickie is played masterfully by Jude Law.  He's the popular kid in school.  The kid no one likes but everyone wants to be liked by.  He does thoughtless, irresponsible things to everyone around him.  Sure, you're supposed to feel sympathy and regret over his death, but you almost feel he had it coming.  Tom is the villain, sure, but he is also the kid in school that just wants to belong and be liked by someone.  He's someone that you sympathize with on a social level.  It's through these strange sympathies that the movie gains it's power.  Go out and buy it and watch it a few times.  It's money well spent.",1082419200,3,1405,4.615384615384615

Tom and Dickie live off Dickie's father's paycheck, and live a life Tom has never dreamed of.  Then Dickie says that this cant go on forever.  And Tom will do anything to keep it.
The performances or the best part of this movie.  Matt Damon is effective as nerdy, pale, Tom Ripley.  He takes an Oscar-worthy turn halfway when he turns into a creepy killer.  Gwyneth Paltrow is also Oscar-worthy as Dickie's girlfriend, but she is best in the 2nd half when she becomes suspicious of Tom.  Cate Blanchett has a small role as an aquaintance of Tom's, and she is flawless as usual.  But the best of them all is two-time Academy Award nominee Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf.  His obsessions move so quickly, and Law is right on the money.  He pulls off being a jerk really well, and introduces depth around the character so well.  He doesn't just say the lines and follow the expressions from the director, he becomes the character and he never falters.
The fun only increases in the second half, but i won't give it away!

Well, All that's true.  Jude Law and Gwyneth are as close to Greek gods as anyone on the screen in decades. But the thing that makes this movie so different than other, lesser mysteries is Matt Damon's Ripley.  He's living on the fringe of society and as events unfold, he falls out of 'normal space' and becomes a full-fledged sociopath.
It's the transformation which is so rare to see on film, and which is so heartbreaking, because we know Ripley wanted to fly right and is fully aware of his own downfall.  He's likeable even as a monster, and, like watching a car crash, I couldn't look away.
  The film was not unlike watching somebody bluff at poker and continue to win against mounting odds.  The chutzpa / cajones required to go down that path were either amazing or pathological - more likely the latter.
In the end he's forced to kill his male suitor and it becomes clear that there's no place left for him in normal society.  He's tainted.  I wanted him captured, not just because he was so dangerous but also because he was unhappily living a lie.

Anthony Minghella (""The English Patient"") suceeds in all levels and delivers an impressive adaptation of Patricia Highstmiths` novels. The direction is first rate, the cast magnificent, the locations and set designs appropriate, the photography sophisticated and Gabriel Yared`s soundtrack profound.
Matt Damon is perfectly cast as the complex, ambiguous and troubled Tom Ripley, as is Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf, his nemesis/ object of desire. Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman also shine here. This truly is an unpredictable, suspenseful and twisted movie, one that goes back and forth with precious attention to detail. The pacing is for the most part slow, it takes a while to develop but when it does the viewer becomes immersed in the absorbing storyline.
This is one of the best pictures about obssession, desire, identity and despair, showcasing Ripley`s oscilation between sanity and madness in a subtle, intelligent and deep way. Minghella also dares to explore his characters` ventures into homosexuality in a risky and tension-filled move that makes for some disturbing and surprising scenes. The ending is particularly powerful and unsettling.
""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is a rich, seductive, intricated and multi-layered cinematic experience, being both beautiful and sinister. It`s a strong and moving character-study and a slick, excellent piece of filmmaking. A must see.",1076544000,5,1474,5.584821428571429

I never liked Matt Damon too much but his portray of the not-so-cold-blooded killer Tom Ripley is convincing, although sometimes I do wonder maybe Jude Law could do an even better job playing this character. But surely there's nobody who could be a better Dickie than Jude Law, spoiled, self-centered yet lovable, he is as gorgeous as always.

Tom Ripley is a poor guy and one day meets wealthy Mr Greenleaf who thinks he is a classmate of his son (due to his borrowed jacked). Greenleaf puts money in Tom's pocket and sends him to Italy to fetch his carefree son. Tom befriended with Dickie (Jude Law)and his girlfriend Marge (Paltrow) and starts to have the time of his life. However, no lie lasts forever, and besides Dickie gets bored of people easily, so after a rough discussion and kind of love declaration Ripley murders the having-it -all Dickie. Was it jealousy, anger of unreturned feelings (yes Ripley is a homesexual, and he hints it from the start, he is so passionate about every beautiful thing but women) or the fear of returning back to his ordinary life? Then he takes Dickie's identity, and continues his enchanted life with some more crimes. He is really clever and calculating, he takes every little detail into account. So, he gets away with all murders and lies-well almost all since the end leaves a question
The plot and directing is very good, as well as the atmosphere. The small Italian village, the costumes and the gorgeus Jude Law alone can save any movie. It was the first time I saw him on screen and became a fan immediately-handsome with talent. I think he could be Ripley as well, he could be better one as he has more charm. Paltrow is lovely, so is Cate Blanchett but very underused-she was the starring in Elizabeth and had an oscar nomination, why she admitted such a small part is a mystery to me. Hoffman as Dickie's arrogant friend Freddie displays a super performance, as well. For me the only problem was Damon. He is a fine actor and playing well, but I don't think he has the charisma and energy  Ripley should display. He looks like more of a good student trying to cheat in exam rather than a jealous and wicked personna. But he was good in the murdering scene-his expression while hitting Dickie with the stone was marvellous. He could do better in earlier Tom Cruise type movies-a la The Firm.

137223,4,0792165039,"""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is about a young man named Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) who discovers, as a result of a fateful accident involving a jacket with the Princeton emblem upon it, that he can pass himself off as someone he is not.  Given that he is not much to begin with, this is a startling revelation.  His initial lie affords him an opportunity to travel to Europe on a mission to persuade a prodigal son, Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), to come home.  Living the good life with Dickie and his girl friend, Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow), Tom comes to the conclusion that he could be a better Greenleaf than Greenleaf himself.  After all, Dickie is cheating on Marge and wasting his time (and his father's money) on jazz clubs and living the decadent life in sunny Italy.  Meanwhile, Tom finds his talents for impersonation are becoming quite formidable and the only problem is that Dickie's friend Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is suspicious of a young man who wears Dickie's clothes, eats Dickie's food, and gets Dickie's parents to pay for it all.  Consequently the viewer is left with two compelling questions.  How far will Tom be able to go with his efforts and can be possibly get away with it?
I know of several people who objected to Ripley being portrayed as a homosexual, offended that this would be presented as his motive for the bad, bad things that he does.  However I see this element as being more ironic in terms of the character.  Keep in mind that the story is set in the 1950s, when what the conventional idea aobut what came out of the closet was not someone who was gay but a monster (and despite his natural charm, Tom Ripley is a monster).  This does not mean that gays are monsters and the suggestions of Ripley's homosexuality have nothing to do with the motivation for his crimes.  Instead it suggests another level of attraction to Greenleaf for Tom and the irony that he is aspiring to a life of a notorious womanizer when he is not overly interested in either Marge or Meredith Logue (Cate Blanchett).  This raises an interesting question: Is Tom trying to become Dickie Greenleaf because it is a life he desires above all others or because it is a life that he can assume because of his talents?
One of the strengths of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is how director Anthony Minghella makes us take Tom Ripley's perspective throughout the film.  Even if he is the bad guy in the film and not a person in whom we are likely to readily see ourselves, he is also the movie's protagonist.  Even though it might be against our better judgment part of us roots him on through his endeavors.  After all, if Dickie Greenleaf is not going to make anything worthwhile out of his life, Tom might be able to do better.  The result is a solid suspense film with which Minghella has invested some of the style of Italian cinema from the 1950s.  Final Note: I sure was glad I did not know that Patricia Highsmith had written a series of novels about Tom Ripley, of which this is the first, because that sort of gives some broad hints as to how this particular story is going to play out.",1059436800,2,3111,4.526785714285714
137224,4,0792165039,"Now, I am a person who generally judges a movie and a book independently of each other, as the screenwriter is generally only using the novel as an outline. (Unless the screenwriter is the author, in which case, no holds barred.)
But in this case, the above holds true -- the book is better, but this is a good movie. Once I divorced my memory of the book (which apparently only provided character names, setting, and very general plot) the movie went along quite nicely. Although, I must admit, I think that Jude Law would have made a better Ripley -- his acting seemed better suited for that role, and perhaps Damon should have been the carefree playboy.
Alas, the final murder in the movie is not in the novel -- so, if they are setting The Talented Mr. Ripley up for sequels, they will most likely not follow Highsmith's next novels, either.
A pity more wasn't done with Gwyneth Paltrow, who seemed almost at points more like a flat character out of 'Friends' than a movie-drama character. Alas, our Ripley gets away, for now -- will movie goers return to see the next installment?
The atmosphere of the drama was classic for the time-period of the novel.  The 1950s Italy, still recovering from the war and still catering in many respects to wealthy Americans at play fills the screen.  The posh airs of the almost-aristocracy, the world to which Ripley yearns to belong at any cost, come through with crisp realism.
The direction, art direction, costumes and general cinematography help this film to shine; the story, alas, is the part the drags, despite being based upon the sterling novel of Patricia Highsmith.  A little more allegiance to the novel, and perhaps some judicious minor editing would make this a truly classic film.

Into this dream world steps an intruder--a likeable con artist named Tom Ripley.  Matt Damon fills the role flawlessly.  He is charming, intelligent, deceitful, caring, conflicted, and ultimately . . . WOW what an ending!
Ripley wins the trust of a shipping tycoon, whose son is living a playboy existence in Italy.  This father has a minor role, yet plays it so convincingly.  He is a paragon of hard work, high expectations, and disappointment in a son who realizes he is rich enough to play rather than work.  So, he hires Ripley to go to Italy and convince him to return.
Thus Ripley enters the world of the son Dickie, his beautiful girl friend, and many other rich, beautiful people.  As he entangles himself into their lives there is suspense, intrigue, and throughout we wonder where Ripley is heading and who will suffer how in the wake of his ambition.
The acting is crisp, subdued, yet poignant.  The plot flows, and yet offers surprises along the way.  The ending is pure poetry.
Bottom-line:  This multi-layered drama is worth seeing several times.  In a sense, it revisits King Solomon's ancient quest to discover what is truly meaningful in life.

Freddy, especially, was wonderful and one of my favorite scenes was the one where he confronts Ripley in the ""out-of-the-way apartment.""

However, recently, I bought a copy of ""Plein soleil"" (VHS), a 1960 movie based upon the same Patricia Highsmith bestseller as ""The talented Mr. Ripley"". With French superstar Alain Delon cast as Tom Ripley, understanable that my expectations were high while standing with my nose against the glass doors of the shelf in the second hand shop. Furthermore, the presence of singer Marie Laforet in the movie seemed to be an interesting bonus. Well, the 1999/US-version of ""The talented Mr. Ripley"" beats the French 1960-version in almost every way: a far better casting (f.i. Matt Damon: ideal mix of angelic looks and weird behaviour), locations and interiors with far more style... But THE argument why the remake definetely beats the original is the way in which it gradually builds towards its climax. This is done so well and subtle (slowly but NOT too slowly), that -according to me- this is one of the best movies in its kind of the 1990's.",1038960000,,1482,4.79296875
137254,1,0792165039,"I can see how this would be a good novel or play.  As a movie, the pace was off.  It was bogged down in details.  The slow character development was tedious, leaving you to wonder when ANYTHING was going to happen.  From the point where Mr. Ripley kills Dickie Greenleaf, I watched in anticipation of seeing this vile person captured.  Instead, Ripley misleads some pretty dim characters.  He's not even a convincing liar.  He gets nervous and sweaty each time.  That he spent Dickie's money without remorse repulsed me more than anything else did.  I wondered when the film would end repeatedly.  It was sheer torture to spend so much time in the company of a loathsome con artist/serial killer.  I would never willingly watch this film again.  Matt Damon did an excellent job and I still can't stand to look at him to this day because of it.",1037491200,5,843,4.583892617449664
137268,4,0792165039,"The movie is `beautifully' ambiguous. It is beautiful, not in any metaphorical sense, but it actually looks `good', on the surface. Everything; right from the manner in which the starting credits are shown (especially the way the movie title is presented) to stunning camera angles, from some great vantage points. The movie is set somewhere in the midst of the late 50's; so every detail has been catered to, in order to create an aura of `those old days'. Most of the settings of the movie is based in Italy, and the visuals of the place is the stuff of heavens: the claustrophobic `tiled' roads, the `out -of -date' and `uncared for' vehicles, the enchantingly blue ocean, the `dreamy' houses with grand dcor, even the corpulent `ice - box', et al. It is the most aesthetically pleasing movie I have ever seen, or maybe I have been missing out on good - looking movies. This is as far as one of the aspects of the movie goes, and is a good reason to watch the flick.
A better reason to view this motion picture, goes as follows:
There is much more to this movie than meets the eye. The plot revolves around the trials and tribulations of a young, small - time con - man, Tom Ripley, who ventures into an unusual business of convincing a very rich and spoilt brat (`Dickie Greenleaf') of this humongous business magnate (`Herbert Greenleaf') to return to his father and stop being a worthless ... The movie actually begins when Ripley goes to Italy to confront Dickie, as entrusted by Herbert Greenleaf, lured by the promise of a reward of a thousand dollars; then, a lot of things begin to happen, which make up the movie.
The picture, basically, throws a light on the various facets of Ripley's persona. Ripley is presented as this very normal, lonely person. He is, however, quite talented. He plays the piano well, and has the unique ability to impersonate people, feign people's hand - writing, signature, etc.; and he uses these qualities to make a living. Lonely, insecure and lovelorn Mr. Ripley instantly finds a liking towards Dickie Greenleaf, when Greenleaf shows a brotherly affection towards him. ... Sexually confused, yet calm, Mr. Ripley also finds affinity towards other people: Marge Sherwood, Meredith Logue, and Peter Smith-Kingsley. Muffled, he is; also he is sensitive... A moving scene at the opera succeeds in Ripley, jerking a couple of teardrops..  Also, ...the last scene of the movie, shot brilliantly, with multiple images of Ripley crying, from aptly angled mirrors, which leaves the conclusion of the movie, upto the viewer, to decide. Ripley doesn't like who he is. He uses his feigning qualities in impersonating the rich kid, Dickie, himself, which he quite well succeeds in doing so. All in all, director Anthony Minghella has done a fantastic job in successfully portraying the less pleasing human sides, by using Matt Damon as a guinea -pig. Matt, too does an impressive job in displaying the lesser characteristics of human emotions, quite effectively.
The movie has a dark undercurrent and is, at times, also frightening: all this, in a very subtle sense. There is hardly any [bad] `orchestral' music at critical moments, telling the viewers, when to feel any kind of emotion, appropriate for the situation. The feel is quite stolid, adding an eerie effect to the movie. In fact, the movie has a lot of fantastic jazz music, all throughout its duration and adds its own charm to the feel of the movie.
An intelligent movie, if you don't prefer a `depressing' flick, watch it for the wonderful music and the masterful cinematography and choice of locations, and eventually, you will end up liking even the `depression' of it.",1035590400,,3666,4.84688995215311

What I will say is that if you don't like this film it must be because it isn't your SORT of film. Maybe you need car chases and your films to have no worrying homosexual themes running through them. I can see how Jock Quarterback from Kansas might have a problem with liking this film. It is anyway, a beautiful and disturbing two and a half hours.",1034035200,,481,4.239130434782608

137271,2,0792165039,"The Talented Mr. Ripley is the story of a young, gentleman psychopath set in 1958 in America and Europe.  Mr. Ripley, played by Matt Damon is a young man with a terribly negative and destructive self-image.  He tunes pianos at Princeton University for a living but wears a dress jacket with the Princeton logo on the pocket.  A captain of industry type sees him tuning a piano at a concert, assumes he went to Princeton and asks him if he knew his son, who went there.  Mr. Ripley pretends he did.  The wealthy man asks if Mr. Ripley would go to Europe and convince his playboy son to return.  He is going to pay him for this.  Mr. Ripley goes to Italy, finds the son and pretends to have known him at Princeton.  He becomes a parasite.  Mr. Ripley convinces the son to let him live in his house, go on vacations, with him, share his life, etc.  Mr. Ripley greatest desire is to live  just like the tycoon and the playboy.  In achieving his goal, the con man gradually morphs into a murder.  The shame of all this is that Mr. Ripley is a multiply talented man and through legitimate means could probably have achieved anything he wanted.
The cinematography is excellent.  There are brief, visually stimulating scenes of a street in New York's meat packing district and of Italian villages.  Both characters were into modern jazz.  The few Jazz club scenes and sounds were magnificent.  It's fun to see how the privileged and moneyed youth of the 1950's enjoyed themselves in Europe while we imagine ourselves doing the same.  Unfortunately, none of this could compensate for the story, which has no redeeming value or interest.  Don't waste your money on this one.",1026604800,3,1664,4.598639455782313
137272,3,0792165039,"The Talented Mr. Ripley reminded me of nothing quite so much as Ridley Scott's Hannibal. That in itself is no bad thing, for Hannibal is a terrific piece of cinema, and in any case The Talented Mr. Ripley predates Hannibal by a couple of years. It is certainly true that Hannibal borrows much from Mr. Ripley in terms of style - and for that matter, a number of the set pieces. The Opera scene; the coffee emporia, the perfume; the high-end dolce vita, counterpointed against the subject's grisly deeds - these hallmarks of Hannibal all flow thickly through Mr. Ripley.
Where Ridley Scott was canny, though, was in upgrading the experience from coach to first class - Hannibal's Florence is an altogether more sophisticated, more lushly shot, and better understood rendition of what is so alluring to outsiders about Italy than Ripley's equivalent. Minghella tends to punt for the familiar, picture postcard scenes, relying on obvious tourist locations (Spanish Steps, Trevisi Fountain etc) but for all that fails to capture Italy with anything like the same wit or erudition.
The films works very well fundamentally as a richly shot (if badly overlong) psychological thriller - in places it is as tense as to be almost un-watchable - but I'm not sure what it achieves at a more substantial level. In this regard, your two and a half hours are scantly rewarded. I had much the same reaction to The English Patient: Beautiful to look at, sweeping and epic; all very brooding and meaningful, but for what?
Minghella's picture has enough style and is well enough acted and directed to raise the expectation that something significant is afoot, but despite much promise, nothing (other than the thriller) materialises. For example, the Opera (and Ripley's reaction to it) seems to be building to a point of some weight, but the point is never ultimately made. Perhaps, I'll grant you, I just didn't get it - but on first viewing I was left creasing my brow. Similarly, the conclusion to the film, while carefully (painstakingly, almost) constructed, ends up being confusing and more than a little, well, inconclusive. Again, it was as if the film were on the way to the point, but never quite made it.
This isn't to say Minghella doesn't try: a number of figurative devices recur during the film, but mostly they are (or their execution is) clumsy: swinging, fractured mirrors, shadows and lighting dancing on faces, rippling (ha!) water fading in and out of focus, and an almost hammy explosion of disturbed pigeons every time Mr. Ripley crosses a square (Hannibal borrowed this device too, but put it to much eerier effect). All these clever cinematic devices add critically to the length of the picture, without adding to the sum total of its message.
These objections shouldn't detract from the fact that Mr. Ripley is a very clever, tense thriller. Jude Law turns in a terrific performance, and Gwyneth Paltrow gives an intelligent, understated, underrated portrayal of the long suffering cuckold. And while I can't bring myself to like Matt Damon, you have to admire his technical skill as an actor.",1025308800,3,3101,4.9311663479923515
137273,5,0792165039,"Here is the basic overview of the movie:
Tom Ripley [Damon] is a reserved and odd guy, who believes it's better to be a ""fake somebody than a real nobody"". He gets a perfect opportunity to prove his point, when a wealthy shipbuilder pays him to go to Italy and bring back his easygoing and ""playboy"" son, Dickie Greenleaf [Law]. Ripley tells Dickie that he was an old classmate of his at Princeton, but Dickie doesn't remember. Dickie and his girlfriend Marge [Paltrow] welcome Ripley into their lives, and Ripley is soon fascinated and drawn into Dickie's lifestyle..complete with jazz music, glamourous trips around Italy, and of course, the women, haha. The more that Ripley gets drawn into Dickie's lifestyle, the more he craves it..and the more that Dickie is ""creeped out"" by Tom Ripley. After a confrontation between Ripley and Dickie, Ripley's life is changed forever..leading to lies, impersonation, and even murder. This movie has so many crazy twists, almost any prediction about the ending could be true. You'll have to see it though to find out:)
This is one CRAZY movie. At first, I was really hesitant upon seeing it, because the length of it scared me [almost 3 hours long!], plus, one of my friends that saw it in the theatres told me that it wasn't all that good. But as some of my friends and I were watching movies one day at my house, I lost a bet so we had to end up watching this, haha. I'll admit, the first 15 minutes of this movie was BORING, I'm surprised I didn't fall asleep. But that's also how I am, I hate the introductions in movies, I like getting right to the point. I'm glad I stayed with this movie though, it was well worth the wait, even more so..
Plus, Matt Damon is one of my favorite actors..and after having watched this movie, I have another favorite actor..JUDE LAW! The casting is so awesome in this movie, every role was played well by each actor, and at times you forget that Matt Damon is well..Matt Damon because he portrays Tom Ripley so well. Oh, and the first nightclub scene where Jude Law & Matt Damon are onstage singing ""Tu Vuo' Fa L'Americano"" is classic!
I can't emphasize enough how suspensful this movie was..especially the last half of the movie. It's like it kept jerking you around..right when you think you've figured out what's going to happen, something new and unexpected happens in the plot. So the plot thickens, right?
It IS a long movie, but the time literally flies by while watching it. If you like suspense and unpredictable plot twists, then this movie is perfect for you!:)",1025136000,2,2550,4.631346578366446
137274,4,0792165039,"Well gosh.  So I just watched the movie.  Somehow even though it got a fair amount of press and most of my friends saw it, I never had before, and I'd never really picked up on the plot.  I remember I wanted to rent it one night but my boyfriend refused.  He'd seen it and he said he couldn't go through that again.  Now I see what he was talking about.  This is one of those films that just makes you smack your forehead over and over again in disbelief and horror.  I won't get deep into the plot; suffice it to say that Damon's Tom Ripley weaves rather a tangled web for himself and for all who are unfortunate enough to come into contact with him.  He is a consummate character study in duplicity.  To begin with, it's the 1950's, and he likes guys.  That'll teach you to lie.  He's sent to Italy to round up some loaded tycoon's spoiled brat son (""Dickie,"" played by Jude Law), and wouldn't you know it, he promptly falls for the brat and his romantic lifestyle.  This inevitably leads to serious trouble, since Dickie is manifestly heterosexual and hooked up with an even-more-mannered-and-posh-than-usual Gwyneth Paltrow.  As soon as he begins to suspect Ripley's secret crush, he turns on him and tries to get rid of him - but it's too late.  Hijinks ensue.
The reason this is such a difficult movie to watch is that Ripley's pathology makes it impossible to empathize with him at any point.  He does not redeem himself; he shows practically no real remorse for anything he does; and it is clear by the end of the movie that he will never stop of his own accord.  He proves himself incapable of the love he so desperately wants, because he has no conscience, no soul, no honor or virtue or character.  He thinks it better to be a ""pretend somebody than a real nobody"" - but in his case this amounts to far more than just the putting on of airs.  In his case his pretensions have subsumed his humanity - have made him inhuman.
The final, tragic scene really nails this home.  It's a great movie, perfectly effective, and I never want to see it again.",1024704000,5,2057,4.394179894179894

137276,4,0792165039,"I am not a huge fan of the Matt Damon-Ben Affleck-Gwyneth Paltrow triumvirate. Paltrow comes off as a ditz in most of her films, her entire repertoire consisting of a coy grin (like Julia Roberts). Affleck does not know how to act, as I have watched him bring down entire films like ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Reindeer Games."" He cowrote an Oscar winning script, he just cannot pick one to star in. Damon comes off best of the three. His Will Hunting was very good, and I think he has more acting talent in his toothy grin than Robert Redford does in his entire weathered body.
""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is Damon's film. He should get kudos for playing the kind of part (gay psycho) that most heart throbs whose careers are stalled on the WB would never even consider. This is a brave followup to ""Good Will Hunting.""
Damon is hired by a wealthy ship builder to go to Italy to retrieve his spoiled son (played by Jude Law). Law is partying it up with girlpal Paltrow and another rich expatriate Hoffman. Things go awry when Damon wants to be like Law so bad he murders him and assumes his identity, with former friends and police hot on his trail.
Anthony Minghella does a better job directing than scripting here. Sure, nice Italian scenery (not many directors could foul that up), but the moments of violence are still shocking, and the cinematography is perfect. His script, however, is bland. All of his ""society"" characters are bland. Ripley's motivations and obvious mental illness just never gel. I always got the sense that Damon was told to hold back, when in fact intelligent psychotic killers have been around on film for years. The movie should have been right at two hours, instead of the protracted ending on the boat (with literally a handful of shots where I expected the credits to roll). Cate Blanchett's character also defies logic, as her character pops up to complicate Ripley's life about three times too often.
Damon, and an oily Phillip Seymour Hoffman are excellent. Jude Law lets his accent slip a bit here and there, but is good. Paltrow plays a socialite extremely well, and all the beautiful people are surrounded by beautiful scenery. I recommend this film, especially over Minghella's leaden ""The English Patient.""
This was rated (R) for physical violence, some gore, profanity, some male nudity, some sexual content, some sexual references, and some adult situations.",1022630400,,2391,4.791767554479419

137298,5,0792165039,"I really liked The Talented Mr. Ripley, but it is only right to mention that opinions on it has been greatly divided. I thought it was one of the best movies of 1999, and the year's best thriller. The movie is as sleek as a panther and as polished as marble. Perhaps it is it's odd combination of the cold and calculating versus the warm and loving that puts some viewers off, because they are not given a paint by numbers picture of where to place their emotions.
Tom Ripley [Matt Damon] is a very bright young man. He is quite ambitious but has no money to make his dreams happen. One day he is hired to play piano at a posh New York wedding reception. A wealthy guest, Herbert Greenleaf [James Rebborn], is taken by Tom's charming manner and by the fact that Tom is wearing a Princeton blazer. Herbert incorrectly assumes Tom went to college there. In fact, the blazer is borrowed, but clever Tom plays along. Herbert soon offers him $1,000 to go to Italy to try to convince his playboy son, Dickie [Jude Law] to come home. Dickie did go to Princeton. Tom accepts. That was a large sum of money in 1958, the year the movie takes place.
As he gets off the boat in Italy, he meets Merideth Logue [Cate Blanchette], a wealthy, amiable American heiress with no particular ambitions, except, I assume, to marry. Since the rich stick together, especially in 1958, she is attracted to Tom, in part because she thinks is rich Dickie Greenleaf. She will play a pivotal role later in the picture. A few days later, Tom spots Dickie on the beach with the beautiful Marge Sherwood [Gwyneth Paltrow], his fiance. When he introduces himself, he says they were together at Princeton. Dickie, of course, doesn't recognize him. Tom certainly wasn't in Dickie's wealthy clique, but it's a big school. Soon Tom is very much a part of the couple's lives. Though Dickie always is suspicious of Tom's origins, he thinks he is a lot of fun. Tom let's slip the fact that he shares Dickie's passion for jazz, and they become fast friends. In truth, Tom, who likes classical music, boned up on jazz before he left New York. Dickie becomes more than just a friend to Tom, who is gay or at least bisexual. The first time I saw the movie, I assumed Dickie was, too, because of his mannerisms. The second time I came to believe he was much too pretty boy with a touch of narcissism who liked women. Still, all the guessing is part of the charming enigmatic quality of the film. I don't want to spoil the plot. I will say that when old classmate, Freddie Miles [Philip Seymour Hoffman] arrives, there's trouble brewing. The prissy, snobbish Freddie is not only suspicious of Tom, he doesn't like him at all. And when Tom's charm and good looks don't work, what is he to do?
You have to say, ""What a cast!"" The four leads are collectively perhaps the most honored young actors today. Damon, along with Ben Affleck, won the best screenplay Oscar for Good Will Hunting in 1998. Paltrow won Best Actress for Shakespeare in Love last year, while Blanchette at the same time was nominated for Elizabeth and should have won. Law got a Best Supporting Actor nomination for The Talented Mr. Ripley. The movie got six nominations, including one for director Anthony Minghella, who won in 1997 for The Talented Mr. Ripley.
Some of the criticism of the movie is understandable. Understatement is out of fashion in films today, and ambiguity is not tolerated. Tom Ripley's personality is deliberately ambiguous. Patricia Highsmith, who authored the book the movie is based on, wrote him that way fifty years ago. The film adds characters, and in the book, Marge isn't Dickie's fiance. She's just a friend who feels far more for him than he does for her. Still, in this case, the movie becomes great in its own right. Because most of it takes place in the tourist areas of Italy, some viewers forget that it's taking place forty years ago. They think the characters actions are odd, but I can assure you that they are authentic for that time period. It's too slow, almost cumbersome for some people. I didn't find it that way at all, but this is a matter of personal taste. Some felt the ending, which is different from the book, was vague. In real life, Highsmith went on to write several more Tom Ripley adventures, and the movie remains faithful to the author's aims. Finally, some viewers don't seem to understand Tom's motive. I can assure you that it's in the movie, but it's just one line near the end. ""I always thought it was better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody."" To me, for certain ambitious types, that's all the motive that's needed.",1016409600,3,4615,4.56144578313253
137299,4,0792165039,"""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is built upon a fascinating, but terribly flawed, premise: disguised in a Princeton jacket, Tom Ripley is asked by one Mr. Greenleaf to go to Italy and bring back his son Dickie (fascinating).  The speed with which Greenleaf trusts Ripley nearly breaks the sound barrier (flawed).  This uneven beginning is a microcosm of the rest of the film.
Essentially a story about taking over the persona of someone else, writer/director Anthony Minghella goes a tad overboard with his imagery.  Populated by more mirrors than you'd find in an average funhouse, ""Ripley"" never lets you forget that Tom and Dickie are two halves of the same whole, or, rather, that that is Tom's ultimate wish.  It's never more effectively and obviously expressed than in a scene on a train.  While Dickie is asleep, Tom uses the reflection in the window to ape the famous shot from Bergman's ""Persona"" where two faces seem to melt together as one (this is the second movie I've reviewed this week to copy this shot, the other being ""Mulholland Drive""; also, it's mocked in Woody Allen's ""Love and Death"").  Throw in the Saul Bass-ian fractured title sequence, and, yes Anthony, we see personality fragmented all over this picture.
But, just when you think Minghella's bag of tricks is plentiful but shallow, he composes a shot in the cover of a grand piano, after Ripley has made a particularly important decision.  He is seen in the piano's reflection, and when he walks away, the curve of the cover makes him seem to split in two.  It's subtlety and ingeniousness knocked me out.  See what I mean about the film's unevenness?  (Minghella further shows his thoughtfulness on the DVD's commentary track; he is learned, intelligent, witty, and thorough in allowing us some insight into his filmmaking choices)
The actor's are uniformly excellent.  Matt Damon, wearing ugly horn-rimmed glasses which I suspect are meant to play Clark Kent to his Superman's smile, gets Tom's social awkwardness just right, has a fun time showing off his gifts as a mimic, and doesn't shy away from the character's repressed (for the time being) homosexuality.  Damon, who's usually a very mannered actor, is so in many moments here too.  But he does let his hair down most of the time, going full-force in to Ripley's pathos.  Gwyneth Paltrow, luminous as usual, plays emotions that run the gamut from felicity to fear, with a touch of utopian ennui thrown in.  Philip Seymour Hoffman, who has a knack for stealing entire movies if he's given only a few scenes, steals the entire movie in only a few scenes.  Minghella gives Hoffman a grand entrance, driving a red Ferrari through a flock of bird, and Hoffman delivers the boorish gusto that makes the scene work so well.  Cate Blanchett, in what could have been a very unforgiving role (ignorant rich girl), milks melancholy from Meredith that's not in the script, and gives her some intelligence to boot.
Jude Law, who's made a living playing the ultimate object of both male and female desire, reaches the apex of his career here.  Dickie Greenleaf, the spoiled, Princeton-educated son of an American shipping magnate, has one true talent of his own: spending papa's dough in lush Italy.  Law, lithe and lovely, is a marvel when he's on screen, and even more so when he's not.  The movie sags during his absence, a point that's probably intentional.  We are made to desire Dickie as much as Tom does.  It's a tricky proposition for a film to make, to have so much of its momentum hinge on one character's presence.  And when Tom finally takes over Dickie's identity, making Dickie ultimately expendable, the film can't help but run out of steam.
The second half, in which the film downshifts swiftly to become a typical thriller, is not nearly as strong as the first, for just this reason.  Law is no longer around to brighten up the screen, and the film lags.  Add to that the clumsy bedroom-farce-minus-the-comedy antics of the characters (What would happen if Meredith, who thinks Tom is Dickie, and Marge, who knows Tom is Tom, meet in Tom's presence?  Well, let's run around like chickens with our heads cut off to make sure that doesn't happen!  Yeesh!) and you find yourself yearning for the end credits to come.  Thats not to say that the second half is devoid of merit.  Paltrow and Hoffman are particularly effective as they make concentric circles around Ripley, getting closer and closer to the truth.  Damon, for his part, manages to hold them off skillfully.  It's an intriguing chess game between these three actors.
But alas, the film overstays its welcome.  Too long by half an hour, I'd say, the film's themes become stale before the plot is brought to an unnatural conclusion.  On the whole though, mainly for its fervent first half and its gorgeous cinematography, I enjoyed the film terribly.",1015632000,9,4845,4.841019417475728

But all is not well in the playground of the rich, for Dickie is in turns as unpleasant and rude as he is debonair and charming, and soon he and his rich friends begin to tire of the financially inferior and all too clingy Tom, who has no intention of being cast adrift, for it is his belief that ""its better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody""...
The Talented Mr Ripley subtly portrays the hedonistic lifestyle of rich, young Americans in the 1950's. In the movie, Tom is less the casebook amoral psychopath of the novel and more a victim of class in his desire to be like the rich but cruel Dickie and Freddie. The film is, however, anything but simple and only about an hour in does the film become anything approaching an orthodox thriller. You are kept hooked throughout as we guess at Tom's motives..., which is at best ambiguous. We observe the mercurial Dickie toy with his affections, whilst Dickie's girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), aware of Dickie's weaknesses, looks on.
Although fans of the novel may be unhappy with the liberties taken with both the plot and the characters from Patricia Highsmiths novel, most people will agree that Anthony Minghella has done an excellent job in imaginatively and successfully bringing The Talented Mr Ripley to the big screen. Not only does he direct this excellent and very intelligent thriller with a sure and subtle touch but he perfectly captures the beauty of the mediteranean, as the movie moves from one spectacular venue to another; from San Remo to Naples, Rome, and Venice. It also stars a top notch and perfectly cast array of the worlds finest young actors, including Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting), Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare In Love), Jude Law (A.I.), as well as Philip Seymour Hoffman (Happiness) and Cate Blanchette (Elizabeth), all on top form. Damon's Ripley is an odd figure, his cumbersome awkwardness contrasting perfectly with Jude Law's cool and casual arrogance as Dickie Greenleaf, lolling around on his Riviera deck-chair as if the world owes him a living. And, although Matt Damon is truly outstanding, it is Jude Law's Oscar-nominated turn and Hoffman's brilliantly obnoxious performance as an ugly-rich American that come close to stealing the movie.
There are many unforgettable moments, in this beautifully crafted movie that Hitchcock would be proud of, as Tom struggles to maintain his dual identity. More dramatically satisfying than The English Patient, The Talented Mr Ripley is an intelligent film, carefully cast and immaculately performed. Highly recommended this for people who love suspense and prefer to watch movies that come with an IQ!!!",1012176000,3,3667,5.103161397670549
137302,5,0792165039,"Here's a film that I watched upon wakening one early morning, and it is truly an eye opener in more ways than one.

Matt Damon as the movie namesake, is sent to Italy by the father of a spoiled and wayward son,  Dickie (Jude Law) to bring him home.  Instead, Ripley becomes infatuated with Dickie upon their first meeting.  He charms with his uncanny imitations of Dickie's Dad,  mimickry being his talent.  He then insinuates himself and becomes part of a troika with Dickie and his fiance, played by Gwyneth Paltrow.  When the idolatry begins to pall, Ripley is rejected and trouble begins.

Part of what makes this special, is the most incredible European flavor throughout the film, and the mood  it creates.  The gorgeous countryside locale shot in Italy with all the wonderful statues, fountains, marble, gardens ect...is a treat for the eyes.  This film also showcases the talented Mr. Matt Damon in an outstanding portrayal of a sociopath who has crossed the line and gone too far to ever come back.

For a very interesting plot, a fine character study, and a video trip to beautiful Italy, you must see this film.  It's truly fascinating.",1011052800,2,1147,4.761421319796955
137303,5,0792165039,"The TMR moview is a masterpiece of suspense and a commentary of the ex-pat Lost Generation. This generation is the American young and wealthy crowd that seeks excitement and fun in each European city during a period when a buck was a buck in the early 50s. It is the time when Daddy's trust account could hide and erase sins and when thrills did not yet discover nose poweder, but skiing on the slopes and boating. Still true today, more so back then when the Net, data bases, and TV did not exist and did not flesh out the truth as readily.
Rather than rehash the plot, which has already been done on this board, I would like to offer this film as another commentary on the ""money is bad"" image, found in works such as Great Gatsby. The characters who have money in this movie, all have  dubious qualities; getting girls pregnant, trying to marry right, trying to party right,etc. That is acceptable as a moneyed crowd that does good would be too boring for a book or movie. However, the story takes the cliche rules and creates a knife with which to stab each character in the heart and punish them for their aimless lifestyle. But what a knife and so well done. Naturally, the ultimate act is murder and some may say, even true love lost. Now the story gets real interesting.
Will Mat be found out? Did the rich brats really need to trade a boring Park Avenue for this? In the end, the movie says that the idle rich are doomed. Meanwhile, one enjoys the great costumes, including the small hats, the beautiful landscapes, BCBG lifestyles, and the feeling that perhaps we wish we could have had this lifestyle.

Other reviewers have stated they cannot understand why he lies throughout the movie, seemingly, ""for no reason.""  I COMPLETELY understand his character.  I, too, lied to people ""for no reason"" - but in reality, I had a reason - I lied to get others to accept me and like me.  I feared that if they knew the truth, they would shun me.  That extreme fear of rejection caused many problems for me.  You find yourself telling bigger and more fantastic lies to cover the smaller ones.  You also find yourself lying when you don't really have the need to - because it's become so commonplace.  Tom Ripley needs to lie for these reasons and for another - he's killed a man he loves.  What happens after that is intriguing.  Gwyneth Paltrow isn't very good in this movie, but Jude Law - playing the quintessential rich jerk, Dickie (true to his name, I guess) - was great.  The ending, like ""American Beauty,"" is very shocking and extremely sad.  I intend to read the book very soon.",1009324800,3,1131,4.453658536585366
137305,4,0792165039,"I think most people would agree that MOST movies-made-from-books don't even come close to the books themselves. Orders of events are changed, minor characters are deleted, even entire sections of the plots are left out for ""artistic reasons"" (or simply because it costs too much to include them in the film). If you're lucky, you see the movie and THEN read the book; otherwise, you're left utterly disappointed.
Well, I read ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" before seeing it on video. And I was hesitant about seeing the movie, as the book was incredibly rich and very deep, especially in character development. I had huge doubts that the movie could do the book justice. But to my very pleasant surprise, they seemed to have pulled it off somehow.
This movie is actually almost as good as the book -- amazing!!
Matt Damon is absolutely superb as Tom Ripley. He looks like Tom, has his mannerisms, has his voice. Damon is SO successful at portraying Tom Ripley as Highsmith had written of his character in her book:  A conniving, pathetic psychopath, who disgusts you but also somehow manages to make you feel sorry for him in the process. A very tough role for any actor, but Damon was excellent.
Likewise, Jude Law is wonderful at portraying the likeable extrovert Dickie Greenleaf -- a rich kid who's lazing away in Italy on Daddy's money, but who still doesn't come across as a selfish snob. Gwyneth Paltrow does a good job as hesitant Marge, who lacks self-confidence and only wants Dickie to reciprocate the devotion she has for him. My only complaint about having Paltrow in this role is that I feel she is too pretty to play Marge, as in the book Marge is a bit more homely. But still, Paltrow gets Marge's personality down pat, which is most important.
The other thing that is pulled off nicely in the movie is the adaptation of the scenery and historical era of the book. The on-location scenes in Italy are breathtaking -- makes you want to be in Italy yourself! Before seeing the movie, I was afraid that the director had chosen to modernize the story, placing it in the latter 20th century. To my surprise he didn't, but instead stayed true to the story's place in the 1950s. This allowed the movie to have that ""old"" feel that the book also had.
Since the book focused on the characters primarily and the plot secondarily, this movie gets four stars from me. However, I can't give a fifth star because, unfortunately, the movie lacks some very important portions of the plot, which changes the tale a bit. And considering that the book was only 290 pages to begin with, I'm not sure why the moviemakers couldn't have fit as much in as possible.
All in all, this film did what most others in its catagory can't -- do justice to the novel upon which it is based. It's a good movie by itself, but of course, I still recommend the book.",1008633600,3,2840,4.601577909270217
137306,5,0792165039,"THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is one of those rare films that make you truly appreciate the fine art that moviemaking can be. By now, you who are reading this already know the basic story: Set in the 1950's, a young drifter from New York by the name of Tom Ripley (played to subtle but intense perfection by the talented Matt Damon) befriends, and insinuates himself into the lives of, rich spoiled Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) and his girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) in coastal Italy after being sent there by Dickie's rich industrialist father. Mr. Greenleaf merely wants his slacker son to come back to New York and take a managerial position in his company, but Tom has different plans which gradually become more and more revealed during the first half of the film. Dickie doesn't want to come back to the States, anyway; he's having far too much fun with his new friend Tom, who introduced himself as someone Dickie knew while at Princeton University. While Dickie never fully believed this story, Tom somehow intrigues him with his many abilities, such as with languages, and his quiet and irrespressible charm. The main benefit Tom provides Dickie with is male companionship, which becomes a source of shame to the promiscuously bisexual Dickie, who cheats on his would-be fiance` with members of both sexes. In the meantime, the fully homosexual Tom develops an obsessive crush on Dickie.  When Dickie begins to rebuff him, Tom learns quickly how to use his friend's philanderous ways to his own advantage. How he does this you may already know by now, but what makes THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY so engrossing is not merely the events that play out, but how each character's flaws play off of each other, and how the situation gradually snowballs to a conclusion that is as unavoidable as it is unpalatable.
The events of this story also involve intriguing supporting characters that are played by the always-uniquely-cast Philip Seymour Hoffman (who has built up his film career with impressive supporting roles in successful films such as TWISTER and BOOGIE NIGHTS to FLAWLESS, ALMOST FAMOUS, and now this film) and the always-appealing Cate Blanchett (as radiant here as she was in ELIZABETH). They help round out the flavor of the film as well as helping to create some of the more pivotal moments in it.
This film is an intensive period character study that presents a time and a place where urges were joyfully pursued but always hidden, and were never, ever discussed in public. Plus, the film's breathtaking scenes, which were shot on location in places like coastal Genoa, the ruins of ancient Rome, and the canals of Venice, provide a perfect backdrop for these characters and their decadent, not-quite-liberated lifestyles.
Anthony Minghella, who wrote and directed this movie, adapted Patricia Highsmith's novel far more successfully than he did THE ENGLISH PATIENT, which I found to be quite ponderous in certain areas. Although it didn't win nearly as many Oscars, THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY never gives you the feeling that it's straying off its central plot. However, you never feel like you know exactly what's going to come next during any given scene.  This movie is so well constructed that you just HAVE to stay with it to find out how it all turns out. When you do, you are rewarded with a conclusion that is both disturbing and real, and certainly does not feel contrived by any means. If only 'true stories' presented on film had as much of a mastery and understanding of human emotions; then we'd have more films that are as transfixing as this one is!

Wow! What a great movie!
Mr. Ripley's (Matt Damon's) talent is that he's a chameleon, shaping his story to fit in with the wealthy Dickie (Jude Law), a rich boy at play in Italy with his girlfriend (Gwyneth Paltrow). How Mr. Ripley manages to ingratiate himself and win friends and a lifestyle he should never have is fascinating to watch. And then, things take a riveting turn, and everything's very different. When does making up become covering up? When there's a murder involved, of course.
Excepting the murder, this film is a little reminiscent of ""All About Eve"" where unsuspecting nice people who have something enviable are putty in the hands of a master manipulator.

137341,5,0792165039,"It's interesting to compare director and screenwriter Anthony Minghella's interpretation with the source material, mystery novelist Patricia Highsmith's 1955 novel of the same name.  As such we were forced to identify with Highsmith's antihero, all the better to set us up for her ironic and daring ""resolution.""  Minghella has changed the ending, but without changing its spirit.  He has Ripley committing an additional murder while throwing in a character not in the novel, Cate Blanchett's Meredith Logue.  Miss Logue serves two purposes, one, she helps unravel the plot and two, she helps to objectify Tom Ripley's ambivalent sexual nature.

The simplistic question, is Ripley homosexual? is not answered in the Highsmith novel.  But, certain scenes aboard ship with the clearly gay Peter Smith-Kingsley, decides that Ripley is indeed gay.  Nonetheless the psychological heart of the story, that of a man who loathes himself so much that he can only love himself by assuming the identity of another man whom he admires, is left intact.  Minghella's script and direction remain true to the spirit and broad form of the novel, while improving on the dramatic quality of the story.  (I don't think most movie audiences would have the patience for Highsmith's more leisurely exposition.)

Some other changes by Minghella include making Dickie's passion jazz music instead of painting, and emphasizing the rich boy/poor boy dichotomy (somewhat reminiscent of the chasm in The Great Gatsby) by making Dickie a Princeton grad and Tom a piano-playing kid who had a menial job at the university.  In the book Dickie and Tom actually knew one another before Europe, while Minghella has Tom pretend that Dickie and he had previously met.  Also in the book Marge Sherwood's character is almost stupid.  In the movie she is intelligent and insightful.  Dickie loves her and they are to be married.  In the book she is just a girlfriend.

The success of this movie in large part is due to Minghella's ability to translate the novel to the screen, but also because of a very superior cast.  Matt Damon as the murderous Mr. Ripley is creepy and vulnerable and entirely believable.  Jude Law as the rich and spoiled, but likeable Dickie Greenleaf, is outstanding.  He is an actor of charisma and subtlety.  Gwyneth Paltrow does a good job in a somewhat limited role as Marge Sherwood.  Cate Blanchett, whom you may recall from her outstanding work in Elizabeth (1998) is particularly good as the straight-laced and somewhat inhibited Meredith Logue who has designs on Tom Ripley's morally corrupted heart (although she thinks he's Dickie Greenleaf).  She, more than anyone conveys the look and feel of the fifties.  And Phillip Seymour Hoffman, whom I recall from his small part as Lester Bangs, the cynical rock critic in Almost Famous (2000), is superb as Dickie's somewhat boorish friend, Freddie Miles.

In some ways this is better than the book.  (And in some ways it isn't, of course.)  Minghella, who brought Michael Ondaatje's difficult novel, The English Patient, to the screen, proves once again that he knows the difference between a novel and a screenplay and how to translate the one into the other without losing the essence of the original.  Incidentally, the spiffy line spoken by James Rebhorn as Dickie's father, Herbert Greenleaf, ""People say you can't choose your parents, but you know you can't choose your children either,"" is not in the book (nor in Bartlett's Quotations) and so I presume was penned by Minghella.

Another very good movie version of the Highsmith novel is the Hitchcock-like Plein Soleil (""Purple Noon"") released in 1960 from French director Rene Clement.",1004659200,2,3683,5.093333333333334
137342,5,0792165039,"The Talented Mr. Ripley: rated R, 2 hours and 15 minutes
 One of the years most anticipated movies, not surprisingly also turns out to be one of the years best. A true ensemble cast that is virtually flawless in performance defines The Talented Mr. Ripley.
When we first meet the films anti-hero (in the true meaning of the word), he is feigning his identity as a well-respected Princeton graduate in hope of impressing his audience at a piano recital. In actuality, Mr. Ripley is just your average Joe. As the movie progresses, the plot thickens. Ripley ultimately finds himself wandering around some of the most beautiful cities in Europe. These locations of paradise become the prime setting for murder.
Disturbingly twisted, The Talented Mr. Ripley stuns its viewers, leading them on a windy road of pleasure and pain, beauty and sheer ugliness. The movie grabs you by the throat, turns you upside down, and then leaves you hanging, desperate for more. Over two hours of filming is not enough to satisfy, when dealing with a movie of this caliber. The first hour and ten minutes of the movie illustrates Ripleys admiration for the wealthy, stylish, all-American Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law). They grow extremely close, and the movie portrays their relationship in an especially genuine manner. The two of them, and Dickies sweetheart, Gwyneth Paltrow, seem to do everything together. Fabulous shots of good-natured fun continue through this entire portion of the movieuntil without warning, things go awry. New characters enter the equation; wonderfully contrasted scenery creates the image of deception, reminding us that appearances often conceal the dark truths; and Tom Ripleys journey from real nobody to fake somebody is enthralling, as is the entire film.
Director and screenwriter Anthony Minghella does a brilliant job of perfecting each and every scene to shadow the films sinister plot. Everything about the movie is classy, especially the development of its characters and the actors behind them. The young, ostensibly, inexperienced actor, Matt Damon assumes the role of Tom Ripley, controversial star of the film. As soon as he steps into the shoes of the poor and pathetic Tom Ripley, it becomes obvious that Matt Damon is anything but nave and inexperienced. He brings the eccentric character to life with such vivid realism and flare that one can only observe with profound astonishment. Easily one of the most underrated actors, Damon proves his worth in Ripley and greatly deserves all credit that he receives for the movie. He ranks among some of the best in the industry. Tackling a role that could be so hazardous to the unblemished teen-idol image he has acquired makes him all the more commendable.
The entire cast of Ripley should be revered for their splendid efforts as well. Without Jude Laws awe-inspiring turn-in as Dickie, a major, irreplaceable piece of Tom would be missing. Nothing remotely negative can be said about Law or any of the other cast-members. Gwyneth Paltrow is great as always. However, lesser-known actor, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, is fantastic in his role as Freddie Miles, the arrogant, snotty pal of Dickie whom Tom competes with for Dickies attention. Hoffman pinned down the precise mannerisms of his character, contributing to his overall staggering performance. To put on the finishing touches, Cate Blanchett is also entwined into the story line. Her character, Meredith Randall is the subtle cause for much of the drama that takes place. Although she appears to be insignificant, she provides for many of the movies more interesting twists. The terrific, high-quality acting of Blanchett rounds out the movie in exactly the way it is meant to, only better.

Fashion designers update classic designs with modern fabics and in that way I think that Minghella's ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is an updated version of Highsmith's classic suspense book. I believe both shine in their own lights. The book, although engrossing and suspenseful, did lack some of the energy of the film and I believe it was held back by some of the conventions of the time it was written in. On the other hand, Minghella gave the book a particular spin by including magnetizing undertones that speak to the hidden desires many people have. Although Matt Damon's performance was at time static, I believe the life and exuberance both Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law brought the film carried the movie as a whole. In this movie, some of the things Highsmith told through some of her slower prose, Minghella embodied in characters such as Meredith Logue, Peter Smith-Kingsley, and a few others. No one can argue that Minghella was very ambitious in taking on Highsmith's work and giving it a 90s gloss and spin. Some of the issues raised in the movie I don't think Highsmith had the liberty to really deal with in depth due to their taboo nature. For those looking for an action packed super-thriller, this movie is not that.

The plot is amazingly different. You see the world through the eyes of the bad guy, which rarely done in Hollywood. What makes this so effective is you relate to the Tom Ripley, a murderer and lair. As a viewer you are drawn into him and his life and you want him to escape and you want in all reality evil to win. This movie is a mind trip that you won't soon forget.
The scenary in the film is breathtaking and gives you the true feeling of being in Italy in the 50s.
The acting is awesome and by far Damon's best work. He was overlooked in my eyes by the Oscars. He's performance moves the film, for there is not a scene he's not in. Paltrow gives a great performance as the only one who can see through Ripley. Jude Law who lights up the screen got a much deserved Oscar nod for his role as Dickie the man who Tom strives to be.

It's better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
My first impression of the movie was that it really dragged on. It seemed too long and moved too slowly for me. Or maybe I was just being impatient because I really wanted Mr. Ripley to get out of the country. But the more I think about the movie, the better I think it is with all its intricacies in character development.
Personally, I thought the greatest weakness in the film was the dialogue. Although they were some wonderful comparisons and motifs (the dark basement without a key), many of the encounters came off as too direct and too unnatural. The odd comments of Mr. Ripley (whether they were intentional or not) of 'You love me so why don't you marry me' and 'Can I get into the bathtub?' just seemed really strange. Mr. Ripley always seeme dto have some homosexual tendencies but I really couldn't figure it out. The movie was capable of being horribly confusing.
On the bright side, Jude Law and Matt Damon were brilliant :) Jude Law's character, Dickie Greenleaf was fairly simple. However, I'm reluctant to comment on Jude Law's performance since I'm extremely biaised on that matter :P As far as I'm concerned, I could absolutely see him as the carefree and inconsiderate person of Dickie Greenleaf. Matt Damon was equally brilliant in his role. And I absolutely loved the characterization of Mr. Ripley, the center of the story. I loved how he slowly becomes more and more obsessed with Dickie's lifestyle and how his crimes increase as his mental stability breaks down. The basement just gets darker and darker. The darker it gets, the harder it is to open.
The secondary characters were decent. I found that most of them provided comical relief. Gwyneth Paltrow (why does she spell her name so unconventionally) was a bit melodramatic I find but her character was breaking down as well so I'll forgive her :). But I've never been a big fan of Gwyneth so ignore me on that comment :P
As the title suggests, the movie centers around Mr. Ripley who is an intriguing and dynamic character. Despite the slow pace at times (relieved by a few comical characters), the movie provides decent entertainement and provokes plenty of food for thought :)",996364800,,2455,4.594533029612756

137378,1,0792165039,"Scroll down the list of other reviews, another guy understood this movie and actually liked it because it is homo-erotica.
The boat scene spelled it out so plainly- Ripley was on the bow, spread eagle, while Jude was delivering rhytmic thrusts from the motor, and the rhythm of the boat hitting the waves plainly spelled out THE NASTY. Anyone who doesn't get that scene doesn't understand movies, and should stick with watching Brady Bunch reruns.
The problem is that right at the point when it's clear that Ripley is gay, he kills the guy in self defense, maybe, since Ripley whacked the guy pretty good with an oar to start things. So the first boyfriend is dead, and rather than play dumb, Ripley assumes the boyfriend's identity, so as to be rich.
And then this awful claustrophobia descended upon me as this murderer went around evading capture. Then I ""got"" the movie- that the feeling of a homosexual who fears being ""outed"" is the same as a guy who could be captured and punished. How awful of a fear it must be to come close to being outed if you don't want to be outed. Fine, that's great, but then the movie continues on, and in his quest to not get caught, Ripley kills again, and again, and tries to kill Paltrow's character. Uh... this is not a goodguy anymore, you don't kill people so that your life can be more convenient, DUH!
The final scene, in which Ripley escapes Italy with his boyfriend, might be the last, but a gal sees Ripley, and oh-he ""HAS"" to lie to her. WTF?!? And as a result he ""HAS"" to kill his boyfriend. That transformed the movie from an artistic mainstream message of ""how horrible a fear, to be outed"" to downright ""people are tools, make them suffer"" erotica for a handful of people. Fine, but why spend all that money and talent making a movie that only appeals to a small segment of the population? Nobody from Idaho to Ohio will ""get"" the snuff-nature of this film. A handful of other people who like shiny things will claim to like the movie, which if they don't understand the strong homosexual foundation of the film, how can their opinion possibly be of merit?
The final insult to the intelligence is listening to the mindless director who claims that the movie could have been a musical with only a little bit of work (huh?) and his epipheny that he feels he did a successful job in keeping Ripley likeable, and the audience rooting for him, even after he has murdered. I guess this director doesn't appreciate the fact that murder is wrong, no people don't root for Ripley, and no the movie didn't come close to being a musical.
Remember Dirty Harry, and the psychotic badguy that Harry tried to catch? Talented Mr Ripley is like watching Dirty Harry throught the eyes of the badguy, like you're rooting for HIM.

137381,5,0792165039,"This movie is an incredible movie that twists, turns, and shows the depths of a tortured soul.  Matt Damon plays Tom Ripley, a man who is excellent at impersonating people.  He is sent to Italy to persuade the son of a rich man; who owns a shipbuilding business; to come back to America.  The plot quickly thickens as Ripley finds himself lusting after Dickie; the son who is played by Jude Law; and his lifestyle.  After Ripley kills Dickie, Ripley ends up assuming Dickie's life.  He is nearly caught several times, leading him to kill one of Dickie's friends and to run away with another man so they can live together.
Ripley's homosexuality is very strongly hinted at several times, but never stated as such.  This suggestion is a constant source of underlying tension and does much to enhance the mood of the movie.
Damon excelllently portrays Ripley, making the character believable, and actually; in my mind; somewhat worthy of pity and understanding.  The movie is somewhat amoral, with no clearcut evil characters.  Each character is shown in all their flaws and virtues.  Excellent viewing and well worth buying!",989193600,3,1122,4.894179894179894

Honestly, I didn't find Matt Damon's performances subtle -- I don't fault him as an actor, I just think the role wasn't really suited for him, not to mention there really wasn't anything compelling about the character to begin with.  Not only is the movie needlessly long, it is in fact painfully long.  The only reason I watched it to the end is because I figured -- ""ok it has to be over soon"" (this went on for at least an hour).

137384,4,0792165039,"Stunning visual beauty, lush settings, and a riveting tale of suspense, mystery and the unknown chambers of the human heart all combust in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" a film full of elegance and irresistible intensity that remains subtle and unforced. The plot is emotionally complex as the title character becomes vastly enamored with a new and inviting lifestyle, discovering hidden feelings for others, and finding out the lengths he is willing to go to in order to remain where he so longs to be. The movie brings all of these feelings into a stunning whirlwind of suspense and emotion that is hard to resist.
Tom Ripley's life is one big underachievement, his biggest societal involvement being his piano performances for social parties and events. His chance meeting with the owner of a shipbuilding company, by the name of Greenleaf, who offers him an exorbitant amount of money in exchange for his services, which involves venturing to Italy to retrieve his son, Dickie. All of these events are set in motion because of a simply Princeton jacket that Tom borrowed to wear to the party, bringing him to the attention of Greenleaf, who thinks that he and his son went to college together. Tom keeps his silence about the truth, because with this ticket to Italy, all of his dreams are realized, and he sees it as a way to expand his horizons and make something of his life.
His trip to Italy and his acquaintance with Dickie and his fianc&eacute;e, Marge, brings him into a totally new world, one where his friends seem to like him as much as he likes them. He feels wanted, needed, and enjoyed, so it comes as a shock to his dream when Dickie decides that he wants to move away from his home and somewhere else, with Marge, without Tom. Tom feels threatened because of this, and his overwhelming feelings lead him to unspeakable acts to keep his fantasy life intact while weaving his friends into a complex web of deceit and crime.
The movie is a showcase for some of the most beautiful places on Earth, setting the film in Italy. The grand expanse of the seaside town of Mangi is stunning and extremely scenic, while the events and everyday activities of the population all add to the time period of the film, giving it an added flavor and feel that is truly unique. The costumes, the jazz music, the way in which the people enjoy themselves is intensely joyful and exotic, and provides some of the best settings for a movie ever. Director Anthony Minghella, whose previous work includes the Oscar-winning ""The English Patient,"" has brought another visually intriguing and powerful story to the screen.
This concentration on the setting is perfectly matched by the complexity of the story, which unfolds like a brilliant novel. It should come as no surprise that the movie is based on a novel, of the same name, written by Patricia Highsmith. The movie captures everything the novel wished to convey: the feelings and events that shape Tom's life, the ways in which his character changes, and the interaction of the characters throughout the novel and how they change towards one another. Everything unfolds slowly, piece by piece, so that the audience has time to enjoy the breathtaking visual integrity as well as the story's mounting climax.
The character of Tom is the most important one of the ensemble, setting the tone for the entire movie. Most of the action going on in the film is connected to his crimes and lies, and while there are some loose ends left untied at the movie's final note, there is no doubt in our minds as to what kind of person Tom Ripley is, and the changes he has experienced. From the beginning of his friendship with Dickie and Marge, it is made abundantly clear that he feels accepted and loved in his relationship with them, and soon he finds himself wanting to spend every available moment with them. The fact that he feels threatened by their friendship with Freddy Miles further establishes the underlying sense of tension and unease, as Tom begins to become more emotionally unstable.
Tom is also portrayed as cunning and quite intelligence, the quiet character who turns into the villain that we don't know whether or not to feel sorry for. His crimes and the way in which he maneuvers through many situations of tension and possible downfall are stunning, adding to the subtle suspense that is always building, reaching new heights in certain scenes but never going over the mark. There is also a subplot of homoerotic charge in Tom's character, who shares many moments with Dickie and another male character that are just boiling over with sexual tension. This leads us to believe that the reasons for Tom's need for affection is because he is falling in love with Dickie, and that sort of creates a battle for the audience to try and decide whether he wants Dickie's love or his and Marge's friendship.
There is a stellar cast for this movie that is superbly crafted and brings intensity and originality to the subject matter. Matt Damon brings power and mystery to the character of Tom Ripley, evoking us to emotions and inner connections with his character while taking all of the action and plot onto his shoulders with ease. Jude Law is a convincing Dickie, who is the all-American playboy that cannot make up his mind about much of anything. His character is the kind of character who moves from place to place to try and escape his own life's problems. Gwyneth Paltrow is a knockout as Marge, who is smarter than she appears to be, while Cate Blanchett is Meredith Logue, the character that seems to pop up at the most inopportune moments of Tom's life.
""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" breaks all the barriers of thriller-making and takes on quite a challenge. It's a classy thriller that keeps in touch with its characters, while giving us a breathtaking view of a world gone by, as well as keeping a sense of underlying suspense that sets a very uneasy tone for the movie. I usually tend to look for lots of suspense and big thrills, which ""Ripley"" does not deliver, but found myself pleased with the way it unfolds and gives away some, but not all, of its secrets.",985737600,2,6117,4.728464419475656

137409,4,0792165039,"Well-done thriller which kept my attention. Tom Ripley seems naive and malleable but is actually amoral and ""annoying"", as Dickie Greenleaf observes before getting whacked with an oar. The theme of bored rich people and the casual way in which they indulge themselves with shopping, food, travel, and sex is given new life in this movie. I am perplexed, though, by Jude Law's Best Supporting Actor nomination for his portrayal of Dickie. Certainly he did a solid job with a fab American accent and smooth blonde good looks, but if anyone gave an Oscar-worthy performance in this film, it's Matt Damon. Is Tom gay and in love with Dickie? Is he on his way to a breakdown? Does he kill to keep his secrets from leaking out or does he enjoy it? Chameleon Damon (an actor I don't particularly like, even) keeps you guessing.
The ending was far from what another reviewer described as ""predictable."" I do agree that it could have been cut 30 minutes or so without losing punch.
Cate Blanchett was terrific as annoying, clueless, and ditsy Meredith. Gwyneth Paltrow (another performer of whom I am not a fan) does a credible job of portraying Marge, a carefree young woman at the beginning and an older and wiser one at the end. It seems to me that Meredith should have had some clue as to Ripley's true identity, and Marge not so gullible as to believe Dickie would break up with her long-distance and never talk to her again, when clearly they were about to get married. Though she sees through Ripley at the end, it's too late and for some reason, both Dickie's father and the hired private eye believe Ripley's incredible story.

137411,2,0792165039,"Unlike most critics and many people, I did not like Anthony Minguella's THE ENGLISH PATIENT. I admit that many of the visuals in that film were stunning. However, I was not at all impressed by the story and to be honest the acting wasn't all that great (Miramax has often won awards not because of talent or performance, but because they have an incredibly huge checkbook thanks to the Mouse). From the previews, I actually thought I might enjoy RIPLEY. The visuals looked once again stunning, the lead character was played by Matt Damon, and the story seemed to be interesting.

Well, I was really fooled by those previews. This movie dragged on forever. There really was no real drama or suspense. The only time the movie is really interesting is when Freddy (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman) confronts Tom Ripley about the missing appearance of a mutual friend. Other than that, the movie was dull and uneventful. I must admit that I did find myself rooting for Tom, but not because I liked his character. I was rooting for him because I disliked everyone else in the film even more. That's usually what happens when most of the characters in a film turn out to be sinister and evil themselves. Sin gives birth to indifference.

This film has an all star cast, but most of their talent is wasted because of the cardboard cut-out character choices they make. Also, this movie portrays itself as being suspenseful, there isn't anything suspenseful about this film. Ripley says at one point in the movie that ""I'd always thought it was better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody."" The makers of this movie took those words to heart because THE TALENTED MR.

Each Character is so well developed, I found myself Rooting for Everybody. There wasn't one character that I wanted fare to come to; even Ripley had me felling sorry for him. Matt Damon plays the part of Tom Ripley with such enthusiasm and Seasoned Skills, he proves he is the Naturally Brilliant Actor we Thought he'd be twenty years down the track. He is totally in the character at all times, and so believable it is Scary. He brings every thought and emotion to his face and he never once Over or Underplays Ripley, his Casting was Genius.
Gwyneth Paltrow gives the Performance of her Career as Marge, Dickie's Girlfriend. She plays her as Spirited, Happy and Full of Life for the First half, and as Bitter, Untrusting and Aged for the Finale. She Proves herself a real, wonderful actress, with all the Grace and beauty of Grace Kelly.
Alot of Critics and Audiences felt that Jude Law stole the show as Dickie Greenleaf, the man of Ripleys Obsession. As far as This Reviewer is Concerned, Matt Damon is the star all the way, though Jude plays a Good Second Fiddle. He Too gives the Performance of his Young Career.
PT Anderson favourites Philip Seymour Hoffman and Philip Baker Hall appear in the truly Magnolia... (an Intended Mistake) Magnificent Supporting Cast. They are Both Outshined by Cate Blanchett and Jack Davenport as two people caught in Ripleys Web of Deception.

137415,5,0792165039,"""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is an Hitchcockian and blood-curdling study of the psychopath and his victims. At the centre of this masterpiece, set in the exquisitely decadent scapes of Italy, is a titanic encounter between Ripley, the aforementioned psychopath protagonist and young Greenleaf, a consummate narcissist.
But perhaps the most intriguing portraits are those of the victims. Marge insists, in the face of the most callous and abusive behaviour, that there is something ""tender"" in Greenleaf Jr. When she confronts the beguiling monster, Ripley, she encounters the fate of all victims of psychopaths: disbelief, pity and ridicule. The truth is too horrible to contemplate, let alone comprehend. Psychopaths are inhuman in the most profound sense of this compounded word. Their emotions and conscience have been amputated and replaced by phantom imitations. But it is rare to pierce their meticulously crafted facade. They more often than not go on to great success and social acceptance while their detractors are relegated to the fringes of society. Both Meredith and Peter, who had the misfortune of falling in deep, unrequited love with Ripley, are punished. One by losing his life, the other by losing Ripley time and again, mysteriously, capriciously, cruelly.
Thus, ultimately, the film is an intricate study of the pernicious ways of psychopathology. Mental disorder is a venom not confined to its source. It spreads and affects its environment in a myriad surreptitiously subtle forms. It is a hydra, growing one hundred heads where one was severed. Its victims writhe and as abuse is piled upon trauma - they turn to stone, the mute witnesses of horror, the stalactites and stalagmites of pain untold and unrecountable. For their tormentors are often as talented as Mr. Ripley is and they are as helpless and as clueless as his victims are.

137436,5,0792165039,"When young Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is casually mistaken for being an alumnus of Princeton, he is sent on a mission to retrieve Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), the son of an influential New York tycoon, from his extended sojourn in Italy. The promise of cash in hand and the inscrutable allure of the Mediterranean immediately seduce Tom, who is struggling to pay his bills in various jobs. But Tom is not all he seems: multi-talented and gifted with a frightening ability to mimic other people's voices, he arrives in Italy, having carefully crafted a plan to ingratiate himself in the company of Dickie and his fiancee, Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow). In particular, Tom appeals to Dickie's ecstatic love of jazz. Together, they form a bond that is seemingly fraternal, yet incipiently homoerotic.
It would be a shame to ruin the film by going on with the admittedly thin plot. Suffice to say that the increasingly unwieldy relationship between Tom and Dickie quickly embroils Tom in a spiralling pattern of murder and lies. What is amazing is that Tom and Dickie's relationship resonates throughout 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' yet is never made explicit.
People will either love or hate this film. That's fine. One thing is certain: once 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' was denied by the Academy Awards, its subtle multiple layers were condemned to oblivion by the majority of filmgoers. Like Tom himself, this powerful, endlessly beguiling film is not all it seems: it's not an action movie. Nor is it a mystery thriller, for we always know who the killer is. The film derives momentum not from a cracking  narrative but from the complex poetic symbolism with which director Anthony Minghella imbues his tantalisingly lubricious images of the Italian coast. Just as the desert in Minghella's 'The English Patient' bespoke the sexual and emotional longing of its characters, Italy embodies the suppressed, turbulent raptures of this film's equally tortured characters. Italy is not all it seems, either: bodies are constantly being turned up, by land and by sea. More Sophocles than Hitchcock, the film charts the vagaries of Tom's Italian tour to what seems like his inevitable downfall.
Boasting a gorgeous jazz and orchestral score and wonderfully three-dimensional performances by Matt Damon, who plays Tom as an awkward youth constantly being surprised by the clamorings of his inner desires; Jude Law, who is astonishing as the petulant and intemperate Dickie; Gwyneth Paltrow, Philip Seymour Hoffman (as Tom's camp rival for Dickie's affections) and Cate Blanchett (as a spoilt, delightfully ditsy daughter of an American textiles-company owner), 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' makes you think long after you've left the theatre (or the lounge room). Above all, it's a film about identity: for as Tom discovers, no matter who you pretend to be, or say you are, you are nothing without a strong sense of self. Here's the final secret of 'The Talented Mr. Ripley': this modern tragedy is a modern classic.",982972800,3,2989,5.1

137438,3,0792165039,"Anthony Minghella the writer-director has done a slight rewrite on Patricia Highsmith's the Talented Mr. Ripley. The Ripley of Minghella is a nerd, not in the same league with Dickie, the young man young Ripley has been sent to persuade to come home. Dickie wants to become a jazz musician. He is having a high old time just laying about in sunny Italy. Tom Ripley likes what he sees. Dickie's father believes Tom went to Princeton with his son, though Tom went to no college at all and is simply a slightly classy looking waiter.
As I said, Minghella's Tom is at odds with Highsmith's Ripley. Highsmith's Ripley is as flamboyant as Dickie is. Highsmith's Ripley is as cute and obviously upper class as Dickie. Minghella's character, played by Mark Damon, can do no soft shoe that even comes close to what Dickie does. Highsmith's Ripley is brimming with a boffo confidence that is really quite close to blundering. Minghella's Ripley could put tape on the glasses Highsmith would not even let the character wear. Minghella has created such a reluctant dweeb that the Highsmith story is seriously undermined. The idea is for Tom Ripley to replace Dickie and live his life. Minghella's Tom Ripley cannot possibly replace the splendid and aristocratic Dickie played by Jude Law.
The film is far too long. Dickie's girlfriend, played by the beautiful Gwynneth Paltrow, sort of stands around and does very little. Kate Blanchett, as another heiress on the continent who mistakes Ripley's true identity, is a little better, but Minghella uses her character to make the Highsmith novel more complex than it need be.
At the end, moviegoers are left wondering why Ripley keeps putting himself through all these conniptions since further attempts at fooling people about who he is, only tempts fate. It also doesn't seem the sort of thing the halting character played by Damon would do. The minute this guy gets money in his bank account, he would count his lucky stars and stop fooling around.
The Talented Mr. Ripley is a classy looking film, almost as classy as the Director's earlier English Patient. But this story is not quite the vehicle for this kind of classic treatment. Minghella has toyed with the story and damaged it. He would have been better to just film the story as Patricia Highsmith wrote it.
We find Ripley aboard ship in a bedroom at the end, trying to figure out what his next move is. We know this Ripley would never have taken chances like this. Minghella has left his hero up a creek without a paddle, and even the audience can't really see a way out for him.

137439,3,0792165039,"I found THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY to truly be a mixed bag.  Whether intentially or unintentially, it was almost a case study in what used to be called (and still may be) a sociopathic personality.  Damon's character fits that mold in that he is able to commit murder without seeming to feel any pangs of conscience.
The movie also works as a bit of an expose of the life of the idle rich, or what we would call ""jet-setters.""  It also works as a showpiece of some of the more glorious scenery in Italy.
Where it fell down for me was in the reality area.  It doesn't seem possible that with the number of people Dickie knew that our ""talented"" protagonist could get away with the identity deception for any length of time.  I also couldn't get attached to any of the characters from an emotional standpoint.  There was no one there for me to really care about.
To summarize:
The positive side:  For me, it was good as a  psychological study, a life style portrayal, and included beautiful well photographed scenery,
The negative side: In my opinion, it was not so hot from the standpoint of a reality check and for emotional impact i.e., I really didn't care too much about any of the main characters.

Which leads me to believe that people don't pay enough attention to this movie... and it should also be watched more than once. I'll admit, the first time I saw RIPLEY I didn't like it that much. It was okay... but long and strange. But after seeing it a few more times, I wanted to own it and show it to everyone. Obviously, from the report above, people miss important things. Because everything people have stated WRONG about the move is unture. For example, the above questioning of why reporters weren't around and why police weren't wary... well, all that was in there. Just forgotten about because it's such a long movie. Have patience. Don't watch it on a night when you know you're not in the mood to think and take in everything. You really need to get into the mindset of the character - and understand why he does what he does. Otherwise you'll be like me the first time and think it wasn't worth the few hours.

As Anthony Minghella says in an interview on the DVD disc, Law is so incredibly charismatic and ravishing that only he could have played the fickle, mesmerizing,sensuous Dickie. The story is so far-fetched as to be completely unbelievable. Without giving away the plot, how was the Matt Damon character able to continue playing another character that long without being found out? Damon is completely miscast. He's too narrow and nerdy and withdrawn to ever attract the attention of some of the male characters. Gwynyth Paltrow has a throw-away role of the naive American girlfriend of Dicky's. At the end of the movie, everyone's upset with Dicky because he's a suspect in the murder of a close friend. Yet, no one, including the police, think it strange that he's not around to answer any questions. Didn't they have newspaper photographers back then to snap pictures of murder suspects. Does anyone think that even in that more innocent time, Ripley could have gotten away with murder so long and not been found out?

I didn't like this movie for two reasons. The gay card was used too fast and sends a odd message. Ripley's character is more complex  and making repressed homosexuality the motive for his actions is slow pitch. It's an easy solution and dumbs him down.  I'm not  comfortable with the message it sends of gays being psychotics and murderers. Oh well, that's Hollywood.
The acting was over the top.  It's too ham fisted and the actors were cast more for their star power instead of their actual acting ability. Oh well, that's Hollywood.

As for the film itself, I thought it was well-acted and well-written, and it is handled with a subtlety not typical of American film, which is typically in-your-face. The homoerotic angle was unexpected, but it didn't bother me, and it added an extra layer to the plot.
I enjoyed Damon's performance, but I think that Jude Law stole the show. Other killer performances were Cate Blanchett as the inconvenient woman who keeps popping up around Ripley, and Phillip Seymour-Hoffman as Freddy, the snotty friend of Dickie. I thought that Jack Davenport did a great job as Ripley's would-be boyfriend, and as the only person in the movie that treated Ripley like a person. Davenport is sexy, and I would like to see more of his movies.
When I first saw this movie, I didn't know it was based on a book....
I think the movie really showed how the rich treat the have-nots, and how they often become victims of their own snobbishness and shallowness.

It does a great job of dressing for the part:  solid acting, smashing location shooting, good period and class detail, lush art design and costumes.  Unfortunately, soggy pacing and editing do in the momentum.  The director does not use the camera or other techniques to make Matt Damon's Ripley character grow from recognizably nice and nave to full blown creepy enigmatic, like Hitchcock would have.  The Ripley character achieves what he wants too soon, so that too much time afterward is spent on what he does with what he has gained and will he get caught.  Plot points and characters introduced after that point lack urgency.

I had put off seeing this film for many months, and after seeing it finally, I wish I had put off seeing it for a lifetime. Everyone I had spoken to had glowing things to say about this film, and to be honest, I just don't get it. I thought it was a good film with stunning filmography and the warm, sunny Italian locales were a nice departure during this, a cold winter. I didn't read the book so, my next analysis might be slightly off base, but I thought the film was absolutely riveting until the second murder. If they had just left it at Dickie being killed, and either having Tom Ripley get away or get caught would have been better than what they came up with. The ending played out, as it were, seemed very forced and rushed by the director and writer. I could almost hear them thinking, ""Ok, he has killed Dickie....now what..."" The film had to end of course, but all of the great endings for this type of film have been used and the creative juices just ran out. Finally, and I surprised no one else has mentioned this, it seems inconceiveable that Tom Ripley being this calculating person that he is, would introduce himself to Meredith at the beginning of the film as Dickie Greenleaf. One has to come to the conclusion that without this chance meeting and utterly stupid move on Ripley's part, we would have no movie.

Cate Blanchett does well as a spoiled American rich girl who falls for Ripley.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman also gives a terrific supporting performance.
However, it's the cinematography that really elevates this film.  The Italian locales are sun-drenched and staggeringly beautiful.  The colors absolutely shine.

137474,4,0792165039,"Patricia Highsmith's classic suspense novel is gorgeously transposed onto the screen in this glossy, expertly-constructed Hollywood adaptation. The tale contains a mixture of themes: murder, the assumption of another man's identity, sexual lust and repressed homosexual leanings. Matt Damon is the villain of the piece, who manages to convince as both a harmless nobody eager to advance on the rungs of the social ladder, but who then sheds his chrysalis to emerge as a brutal and consummate murderer. Critics have objected that the film's major shortcoming was the miscasting of Damon in the title role -- (he looks far too inncocent, too ""good-school-boyish"" to carry much weight as Highsmith's sociopathic villain.) Perhaps Leonardo DiCaprio, whose features bear a touch of cruelty, might have been more suitable. Still, this objection is unjust as there are a few scenes (such as the horrifying murder in the boat with the oar) that prove that Damon, just for once, is capable of getting out of himself and acting against type. The greatest performance of the piece was Jude Law, however, while Gwynneth Paltrow just seems to sit around and look pretty. Generally recommended for buffs of the crime thriller, as the fifties backdrop seems to uncannily evoke some of the vintage suspensers of Hitchcock which also feature Mediterreanean settings -- (e.g. ""To Catch a Thief"", 1955). A glaring implausibility of the plot, though, was the way in which Ripley managed to pull off such an obvious confidence trick without being found out sooner.",977270400,,1543,5.2008032128514055

137477,2,0792165039,"The Talented Mr. Ripley (Anthony Minghella, 1999)

Anyone who goes into this thinking Anthony Minghella is god and can do no wrong isn't thinking too far past The English Patient (two words: Mr. Wonderful). Ripley suffers from many of the same shortcomings as Patient did, but it also has many of that film's strengths, as well, and it's backed by a classic mystery novel. So it can't be all bad, right?

Right. Unfortunately, it can't be as good as it should have been, given the considerable depth of talent herein.

Minghella should be counting one blessing, that his film doesn't have to stand up to the scrutiny of the earlier film based on this novel, Purple Noon (1960). So few people have seen it that Minghella was capable of starting fresh, with an extremely strong cast, a decent script, and a directorial hand that lends itself to the slow-moving and sumptuous. Large, sweeping landscapes and perfectly-blended colors were one of the thigns that made The English Patient such a delight to watch, and they do the same here. But the pace of Patient was slower and easier, as a drama should be compared to a mystery, and the Fiennes-Thomas tension was allowed to build and ebb. There's no real chemistry here between any of the characters, save towards the end, as Tom (Matt Damon) and Peter (Jack Davenport, last seen as the dashing male lead in the extremely underrated Ultraviolet) get to know one another better. We find ourselves wondering where the tension is supposed to be coming from, and ultimately, there isn't any; it just exists, and continues to exist perhaps long after it should, as Minghella spends forty-five minutes cleaning up loose ends. (To give credit where credit is due, however, the movie's final scene is masterful.) The characters are well-played, but they seem to be operating in separate vacuums.

Special mention should be given to one thing, however. The PR team did a fantastic job with this. The trailer for the film edited a key scene (""you're shivering, Marge..."") in such a way as to make it stupidly unwatchable, thus lowering the expectations of the filmgoers. So most people probably went into it thinking ""god, I hope the whole film isn't as bad as that scene.""

He therefore lets himself be mistaken for a friend of a rich man's son and be sponsored on a trip to Italy with the intention of convincing the son to return to America.
The son, Dickie Greenleaf, played by Jude Law, is living the high life in Italy and romantically involved with Gwyneth Paltrow.  When Tom Ripley enters their world, he is at first rejected and then embraced and a friendship between the two men develop.  Complications lead to murder and Tom Ripley assumes the identify of Dickie Greenleaf.
The director is Anthony Minghella, who directed The English Patient, and it is clear he loves lush scenes of Italy as well as the subtle physiological states of his characters.  There is more to this story than just the action of the plot. The tension revolves around whether or not Tom Ripley will be discovered and it held my interest throughout because of a well-crafted script and excellent timing.
Matt Damon does a good job, but not a great one, and needs props such as horn rimmed glasses and a worn corduroy jacket to compensate for the subtleties of characterization that this difficult role demands.  Gwyneth Paltrow is competent but never outstanding. However, Jude Law's role as Dickie Greenleaf is totally convincing;  while the other actors seem to be trying too hard, he comes across as the spoiled rich boy as if this was really who he is.

137483,2,0792165039,"Patricia Highsmith's novel, on which this film is based, is a tightly woven thriller, with no plot holes and a high level of suspense -- which is what makes it all the more inexcusable that the film's director,Anthony Minghella, chose to rework and replot the narrative until it alternates between the nonsensical and the preposterous. (For those who have never read the book : the Cate Blanchett character, Meredith, doesn't exist in the novel, and the composer with whom Ripley eventually takes up is mentioned (once) but is never seen. Whole episodes, such as the girl in Mongibello who drowns herself over Dickie, are Minghella's additions).Highsmith's Ripley is a consummate games-player right from the beginning, who would NEVER have allowed Mr. Greenleaf's chauffeur to pick him up at his dump of an apartment, thereby running the risk of exposing his story about being a success. My personal bete noire in this film is the murder of Dickie. Highsmith's character murders in cold blood, having already decided to steal his identity; Minghella's swings at him in anger; tries to apologize; then has to kill in self-defense, when Dickie lunges at him.(The scene immediately thereafter, where Ripley cradles Dickie in his arms, weeping over his foul deed, would surely have had Highsmith roaring obscenities).Also, when I saw the film in the theater, NO ONE could make head or tails of why Ripley kills his composer/lover at the end. Meredith is now the only person left who knows Ripley as Dickie; and it is clear that Ripley can't possibly go on pretending to be Dickie without being exposed, since Dickie is now universally believed to be dead. So why isn't Meredith the one he kills? This is especially pertinent since the film's theme (NOT Highsmith's), such as it is, is that Ripley is essentially nothing more than a Boy Who Wants To Be Loved; yet now he kills a first-rate man who genuinely loves him. I should add that the film's Italian location shooting is GORGEOUS, to the point that you will want to leave the theater and call your travel agent to book you on the next flight to Ischia (the stand-in for Mongibello). The cast is also splendid (with Philip Seymour Hoffman particularly good; the kind of officious bore that we have all met at parties, and who should probably be murdered just on general principle.)Unfortunately, in a thriller (as the master, Hitchcock, knew so well), it is the script that decides whether the whole business sinks or swims.

I didn't like the novel either (and it looks to me like the movie sorta slaughtered the novel and ruined it).
Reasons for the Rating: Male Nudity, blood'n'gore, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, language, terror and suspense, sexuality, certain sexual preference innuendos, murder, harsh violence, and a scene of suicide.
The Plot: Thomas Ripley (Matt Damen, ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"")is a noname childlike young man who has noone to love him or to take care of him, instead he has a WIERD POWER to forge writing and mimick voices.
He gets an offer to find someone he doesnt know but pretends to know and bring him back home, and when he goes the guy he finds tells him to stay for a while and live it up with him, because (IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE) he aint going home.
When it comes down to it Mr. Ripley wants everything this guy has including the guy. It gets even worse from there and ultimately leads to death and destruction, which is without a doubt what evil always leads to.

I mean why did he just take this guy in who he didn't even know and how he continued being best friends with him without even knowing who he really is. Also Phillip Seymour Hoffman is great again at what he does best. Really interesting supporting roles. I like him in small roles like this and Magnolia and Boogie Nights, but I can't stand him in entire movies like Flawless. He can annoy me after a while. Matt Damon was obviously good too, but the supporting is what makes the main character and story better.

137496,5,0792165039,"Patricia Highsmith's classic novel has been filmed once before as ""Plein Soleil"" but this has to be the definitive version.  It engages the viewer from the opening seconds as Matt Damon's title character impersonates a friend with an injured hand to the closing seconds when he...well you'd better see for yourself; I don't want to give away the plot like the otherwise excellent documentary on this DVD does.
The colours are warm and vibrant and beautifully evoke post war Italy, although it is more ""La Dolce Vita"" than ""The Bicycle Thief"".  The film is populated by beautiful people into which the talented Mr. Ripley appears and tries to join but when that proves to be out of his reach his actions take a darker turn. The style of direction is observational and a viewer may need to see the film more than once to get all the nuances in the plot; but there are few better reasons to buy a DVD than for repeated viewings.
I particularly liked the attention to detail especially the red glasses they drink out of while on the yacht; my parents bought  identical ones when they went on holiday in Italy in the early 1960's and I still have two of them.  But this attention is not fussy as in Merchant/Ivory productions and draws the viewer in to the film rather than distracts from it.
All the perfomances are superb but special credit is due to Jack Davenport as Peter; quite a change from the homophobic Miles he plaved in television's ""This Life"".
This is a great film in a feature packed DVD that belongs in any serious film lovers collection.",970963200,2,1549,4.601449275362318
137497,2,0792165039,"I can not imagine anyone giving that film five stars wholeheartedly and enjoying it from the first till the last minutes. Even the most appreciating reviewers sound as if they are still in the inner dialogue and let us hear only the speech of the film's advocate, leaving the other side's arguments to themselves.
First of all, the characters are miscast.  Evidently, Matt Damon is not made from The Leading Man stuff, no way. Watching him for 2 hours is a torture. Matt always looks himself - why he was chosen to play the films hyper-inventive chameleon is a mystery.
As for the pale frail Gwyneth I am tired of seeing her peddling her fake vulnerability and enthusiasm.
All in all, Matt and Gwyneth are not the persons I can or want to care about. And that ranslates to the characters they play.
Jude Law is lean, hadsome and energetic, no depth is required by the role he plays, and in a different ensemble his performance would have looked much more rewarding.
The rest is already voiced by the other reviewers: the actors fail to make the plot look veritable or engaging to the degree that could have made us turn our backs to reality, the pace is slow, the movie drags on, the postcards-of-Italy-came-to-life backgrounds look picturesque but towards the middle of the movie I was wishing for a program that would allow me to erase the annoying ""actors"" from the forefront and just enjoy the second hour as a National Geographic video.",970531200,9,1441,4.673228346456693
137498,3,0792165039,"The movie takes its sweet time in getting to the point. There's lush  scenery, but the story falters. Maybe this is because Damon is not that  belivable in his role. I would not buy it, but I would rent it for the  Italian landscape.",969235200,,233,4.25
137499,3,0792165039,"Set in the beauties of the Italian coast, ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is a suspenseful drama about lies, murder, deception, and one  man's desire to be somebody.  Accolades to the videographers, set  designers, and individual actors, but no such praise for the plot.
Under  the direction of Anthony Minghella, ""Mr. Ripley"" is one of the  most visually stimulating films of this year!  Matt Damon (Good Will  Hunting) is exceptional, as usual, playing the virtual nobody, Tom Ripley.  Propelled to the beautiful shores of Italy under false pretenses, Tom must  coaxe the tychoon son, Dickie (played by Jude Law) into coming back to  America from his seemingly endless vacation at daddy's expense.  The plot  thickens, however, as Tom weaves himself into Dickie's life and indeed  takes on Dickie's character.  Ripley quickly finds himself attempting to  right one lie after another.  My mother always said that lying was bad  because once you got started it was hard to remember what was true and what  was a lie...Tom is my mothers poster child!  Unfortunately, this very issue  is overplayed and its effect is lost.  Gwyneth Paltrow (Dickie's steady,  but not only lady) uses her beauty, wit, and poise to portray the perfect  lover/friend/about to be slashed vixen.  She quickly sees through Tom's  charade and is a threat to his unraveling, but never fear, Tom is extremely  talented after all.
The movie moves quickly, enraptures its viewers, but  leaves them feeling victimized.  Three murders, a dozen lies, and enough  turns to capsize any sea worthy craft later, The talented Mr. Ripley misses  the mark in overall performance.  The film is acted superbly, the scenes  are amazing, but the plot leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  3 1/2 stars!",969235200,6,1748,5.021052631578947

137501,5,0792165039,"In the early sixties, French star Alain Delon had already impersonated Tom  Ripley in the first version of Patricia Highsmith's novel. Directed by Ren  Clment, PLEIN SOLEIL (High sun) was interesting but Ren Clment was  obliged to hide the ambiguous side of Tom Ripley and focused his attention  on the machiavelic plan that Ripley imagined in order to commit the perfect  murder.
Forty years later, director Anthony Minghella can at last  translate into images the subtlety of Tom Ripley's character. In my  opinion, Matt Damon is OUTSTANDING as Ripley ; he could kill a dozen  persons and we would still find good reasons to forgive him. He is only a  victim of unfair circumstances.
The cinematography is also to be praised,  Anthony Minghella declining one by one the whole litany of the visual  symbols for the theme of the double. Great musical score and actors giving  excellent performances. Since the DVD also offers interviews, a commentary  and the usual trailer, you can without hesitation consider THE TALENTED MR.

137515,1,0792165039,"Okay, I just finished watching this movie, less than twenty minutes ago...  It gave me a serious headache, and the only suspense was when it would  end!!!
I selected this movie with such high expectations... The cast,  starring Matt Damon, Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow have all had very high  marks on their acting careers.  This will most definitely be one of those  movies that they will look back on years from now as 'one of the other  movies they starred in' as they would be nuts to claim this as one they are  proud of!
I guess I should have been tipped off by the director, Anthony  Minghella, who also directed 'The English Patient', which I considered a  very painful movie to watch.  That stated, I would have preferred to watch  a 'movie marathon' of the 'English Patient' for 24 hours than to watch this  movie once!
The movie starts with such great promise... The costuming  and the scenery are magnificent.  However, even the very start with the  `jacket incident' began to grate on me.  As someone who works in a job  where dishonesty could cost someone their life, Ripley's deception is not  something that I find humor in.  Then, at the pier in Italy, and so on down  the line, his willingness to lie (and for no apparent reason) got onto my  nerves.
Dickie Greenleaf, played by Jude Law, does an accurate job of  portraying the `typical' wealthy, young, irresponsible expatriate.  As a  former expat myself, (though not in the `wealthy' or `irresponsible'  categories!) who lived in Europe, I have met many people like those  portrayed in the movie, and can identify with them and they way they  behave.
Dickie's summation of Ripley while in the motorboat is entirely  accurate- `a leech'.  Here is a young man, who seemed to have such promise  early on in the movie, but with the more you watch, the more you learn that  he is a very troubled individual, a psychotic, repressed, burden on all  those with whom he comes in contact.
This movie very much reminded me  of  Dostoyevsky's book `Crime and Punishment', which drags you through the  mud of a criminal's consciousness and his guilt ridden mind. While has it's  merits as literature, and does have a redeeming ending, (much unlike this  movie) it is not the kind of book which most people would simply sit down  and read for `pleasure'.
Now you could have made a great movie about an  actually `talented' and honest Tom Ripley (by the way, I couldn't find any  talent which Mr. Ripley had a monopoly on in the movie, other than being a  psychopath...) who goes to Italy to bring back a wealthy New Yorker's wayward  son.  That would probably make a great movie, and the scenery would be just  as good!
Thinking of the scenery, if you want to watch this movie to see  the `quaint' Italian countryside, please do yourself a favor and buy a  ticket there!  I live in Japan and the cost of a flight to Italy would buy  a couple hundred copies of this movie, but would be worth it, in order to  avoid the pain of watching it!
Personally, I stopped the movie at about  two-thirds of the way through.  I could not stand to watch another minute  of it.  However, at the request of my wife, I did watch the last portion of  the movie, which really has even fewer redeeming qualities than the  beginning!
If you enjoy dark, very psychological movies which pause  and make you think about the depravity of a man's condition, or perhaps  enjoy sticking bamboo shoots under your fingernails, this is a movie for  you.  However, if you are looking for something to watch that may be  enlightening, or at least somewhat interesting, take my word for it and go  watch another movie.",968544000,3,3642,4.586583463338534

137518,4,0792165039,"Anthony Minghella's adaption of Patricia Highsmith's The Talented Mr Ripley satisfies on many levels. Highsmith's book provides a greater understanding of Tom Ripley's motives and passions but the film does also convey these through tight editing and studied scenes. The most obvious plus with Minghella's film is the cinematography. It would be hard to make the Amalfi Coast, Rome and Venice to look anything less than stunning. In the Talented Mr Ripley they look like sensual, sexy travel brochures.
Matt Damon carries the role of Tom Ripley with aplomb. He exudes concealed malice whilst carrying the burden of his hidden homosexuality and working class roots. Highsmith's novel was a critique of the false class system built on wealth and looks. The movie conveys this message admirably.
The supporting cast are also flawless. Jude Law is stunning as the spoilt and wilful Dickie, Gwynneth Paltrow proves she can act and takes the role of Margie through a variety of emotions from vulnerable socialite to revengeful lover. Australia's Cate Blanchett shines in a supporting role (not included in the novel). The film follows a fatalistic path and does not moralize. We do not hate Tom even though he lies, deceives and murders. He is the anti-hero and a victim of society's dictate that wealth and beauty are the ultimate prizes.

137520,1,0792165039,"I just can't even begin to comprehend all of the stellar reviews for this absolute rubbish of cinema.  It has no redeeming qualities at all.  I can, on the other hand, understand the negative ones.  Unfortunately, those  people are smart and choose not to express this disbelief of this slop in  so many words.  I, on the other hand, was so riveted by how God-awful this  movie was, I must tell you all about it.
The movie is about a fairly poor  off gentleman named Tom Ripley and his plight for something great in the  world.  Tom, played extremely dully by Matt Damon, seeks out fortune by  trying to convince a young spoiled brat (Jude Law) to obey his father's  wishes and come back home to America.  It helps that this request by the  father of the boy sends Tom to Italy and with his boss's money.  So Tom  gains the friendship of this wealthy boy and his beautiful young girlfriend  (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Let me try and express this so-called ""talent"" of Tom.  It is seducing rich people into giving them all their life.  Well, it works  and Tom ends up fooling people into  thinking that he is now Dickie.  This leads to a duller than dish water  game of bouncing around beautiful young millionariess (Cate Blanchett) and  Dickie's ex.
I really don't have the time nor the inoculation to try  and express more of boring storyline, but would just like to rant on the  acting of these big names.  The performances are so lackluster that you  become shocked that many of these names are well known.  Even Cate, whom I  really like in many movies, can't carry off her performance as a pampered  American princess type.  I could hardly tell if Gwen is playing yet another  Brit or just a snobby ""colonist"".  The only thing even worthy of being  called acting is the somewhat threateningly cleaver character played by  Philip Seymour Hoffman.  He might really be something big soon.  However,  one the reasons this film was so exclaimed was the big debut of Jude Law.  Personally, I don't get it.
There are two big questions to ask after  reading my review.  Why did so many people enjoy this film?  I have no idea  but I think it could be just the scenery but with a story so inspiring and  just plain not entertaining, you can't even be thrilled with the tourist  attraction angles.  Take the trip to Rome if you have to because it will be  worth it.  After that, why was this movie so praised by critics.  Personally, I feel they got paid.  Just kidding, but seriously I think it  was some kind of love affair/admiration for Law whom gave this movie such  buzz.  His performance isn't the best, but perhaps a far 2nd to the sly  Hoffman.  The same kind that there was for Damon a few years ago.  Better  stop listening to those critics all the time.
So I guess this ""next  biggest thing since Sliced Bread"" is very moldy and green.  I'm not  shocked.  Maybe there is hope.  Maybe I'm cynical and just didn't see the  magic.  Then again, I was watching with someone else and they agreed whole  heartdely.  Keep in mind this is the same man that brought us that little  cinematic gem ""The English Patient"" Almost an unfair comparison as to which  is worst, but this takes the cake.  At least there where a few good things  about that story.  So unless you like that kind of trite film making of  visual beauty over a good story and acting, this is one to get but I have a  fair idea that most people with any taste for a real chiller will be bored  to tears with this film.  I have seen B-movies that make this look very  bad.  At least there is a camp quality to those films while this one tries  to hard and just fails on all counts.  Where is Morgan Fairchild when you  need here?  I must recommed you avoid this and save yourself some pain.  There are two kinds of movies I remember.  Really great ones and awful  stinkers.

I was never once  bored while watching this movie and have watched it multiple times now. I  guess if you were looking for a pure action type thriller then this is the  wrong movie cause it is so much more than that. I found myself on the edge  of my seat after Tom killed Dickey and assumed his identity. I actually was  hoping nobody would find out that he did it cause i hated how Dickey was  his best friend at one time then all of a sudden didn't want to have  anything to do with him. Some people said in their review that Tom killed  Dickey because he wanted to use his identity for himself which isn't the  case. He wanted to be like him,yes, but what he wanted more was his  friendship. Dickie lost interest in him and actually was the one that  started the violence and caused his own death. Tom didn't want to kill him.  Tom hitting him in the face was caused by Dickie's harsh words and actions.  It was more of a reflex by Tom and he felt sympathy right after. Dickie sat  there in shock for a moment while bleeding on the side of his face and then  attacked Tom giving him no choice but to kill Dickie. Also someone said  that Tom should have left Rome once Meredeth showed up but i guess they  didn't understand Tom's obsession with Dickie's life and how he thought it  was better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.

137527,3,0792165039,"The movie centers around Tom Ripley, who is squeaking a living and then is  hired by shipping Magnate Mr. Greenleaf to go to Italy and bring back his  decadent son Dickie (who is played well by Jude Law).
With $1000 in his  pocket and con-artist mentality, Tom goes to 1950's Italy and finds Dickie  and his girlfriend Marge (played fetchingly by Paltrow).  He worms his way  into their life by emulating their blue-blood mannerisms and history, but  he is easily found out, and when Dickie finds out this fraud, becomes bored  with his needy tendancies and wants nothing more to do with him, Ripley  kills him in a rage, based mostly on his insecurities and Dickie's  rejection of him sexually.
Now the game begins where Ripley begins to  assume Greenleaf's identity, using his name to gain influence with and use  other blue bloods like Meredith (played with real human dignity by Cate  Blanchett, who Ripley uses then dumps).  However, the police are closing in  and the others in Dickie's circle of friends (like Freddie and Marge  herself) are beginning to suspect that Ripley has done something sinister  and is leading them around as well.
The acting is all first rate here,  from Jude Law playing Dickie who is shallow, yet likeable and has magnetic  charisma, to Matt Damon who starts off as this fresh, All American kid but  his dark side slowly takes over his personality and demeanor.  The  secondary characters played by Paltrow, Blanchett and Philip Seymour  Hoffman do an excellent job playing the people in the upper echelons of  society.
However, this movie is also boring and ponderous.  It seems to  take forever to get things started.  This movie could have been 10 minutes  shorter and would have tightened up everything.
Overall this movie is a  good movie rental but for my personal tastes, it is not worth buying.  However, if you are a Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow or Jude Law fan, this  movie may just be for you.

137528,5,0792165039,"I have not thoroughly read Patricia Highsmith's highly acclaimed novel,  but I can guarantee that even though this movie was an engrossing dive into  the machinations of an unintended criminal mind, it does not compare to the  impact of detail a book can create. This fact aside, I thought everyone in  this movie (with the exception of minor roles) was excellent, especially  Jude Law, even though he was only present for the first hour of the film.  The performances are well-crafted and aimed to discern themselves from  genuine and amiable personalities. Of course everyone in the tale is  despicable! If they were all decent human beings, it wouldn't be  interesting.
First off, we have Matt Damon in the title role, a young  gay man looking for his slot in life with a penchant for deception. You  find out soon enough that the name Tom Ripley is simply one of his many  aliases he uses to snake his way into beneficial situations. He assumes  many identities, becoming a doppleganger of sorts in a simplistic  environment where every move he makes, every word he says and every  appearance he manifests is utterly and undeniably credible and influential.  Men like this are frightening, and Ripley is a force to be reckoned with,  an impulsive and unrepentant being deriding our subsequently modern  society. Despite his unabashed approach to establishing valuable  connections, he is surprisingly withdrawn and extremely discontent with his  own image. His dynamic leaps into other people's existences are his escape  from that which he despises the most: himself.
The site of this story is  stationed mainly in fictional Mongibello, Italy, circa 1958. Minghella  recreates the most remote parts of Italy and transforms them into a rustic  and breathtaking environment, reminiscent of a time when it was more of a  paradise than a tourist attraction. Verdant blossoms and ivy-swabbed houses  and buildings create a dated and sophisticated look for the lavish set of  ""Ripley"", making it enjoyable to watch not only for its character  depth but also for the lush and picturesque scenery.
It all begins at an  outdoor party with our faithful fraud playing a piano, his back to the  camera, wearing a chic college sweater. Perusing and schmoozing among the  crowd is Herbert Greenleaf, a stoic and shady presence made of money and  power. He strikes up a conversation with the young man and notices his  sweater has a Princeton logo emblazoned on the front. This is the key that  unlocks the first of many doors for Ripley, a key that will send him to  Italy in search of Dickie Greenleaf, Herbert's obstinate and impetuous son.  In return for Tom's subjugation of Dickie are a $1000 prize and most  certainly a seat in Herbert's prestigious social circle. Tom readily agrees  and packs his bags, carefully studying Dickie's musical interests among  other things in the weeks before his departure. Upon arrival in Mongibello,  Tom puts on civil and amicable airs, introducing himself to Dickie and his  girlfriend Marge Sherwood, an aspiring novelist. The two of them are  enchanted by Tom's subtlety and good graces, inviting him to stay in their  luxurious domicile overlooking the deep blue ripple of the Mediterranean.  Tom watches them closely, acquiring Dickie's mannerisms and love for  adventure, accompanying him on many spontaneous outings. It becomes quite  clear in the time that they spend together that Tom is more than genial  towards Dickie, and the moment he tries to advance upon him romantically,  Dickie reciprocates with harsh rejection and stinging insults. Here comes  the plot twist, and from this point on, Tom is caught between his  established identity as an unassuming and demure individual and the  delicious taste of Dickie's enviable lifestyle.
In rating the  performances, Jude and Matt were my prime picks for most intriguing  performances, not only for their natural talent but also for the unwavering  commitment to the perfection of their characters. Jude is a formidable  presence on screen, playing the idyllic high-nosed snob in an iconoclast  society. Dickie is a man who lives for the moment, finding his ecstasy in  fleeting moments of inspiration, whether it be with instruments or lovers.  He's not a man of many redeeming qualities, but then again no one in this  film is except for maybe Marge, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. This is a  complete %180 from the female empowering roles she's had in the past, the  most notable being her Oscar-winning turn as the poetically inspired,  theatrically driven free spirit Viola de Lessups in ""Shakespeare In  Love"". She's unbelievably gullible as Marge, a bit pitiful in her  infinite kindness towards strangers and grudgingly accepting of Dickie's  flighty nature. I almost don't think the role was worthy of her time or  talent, but nonetheless, she did a good job. It's just a little hard for me  to believe that it took Marge that long to figure out Tom Ripley's twisted  game.
Who I really thought was outstanding was Philip Seymour Hoffman,  playing Dickie's pompous and uncouth acquaintance Freddie Miles. Philip has  played the role of the snot-nosed prep before, the first one I can think of  being George Willis Jr., the spoiled son of a wealthy businessman, a solid  member of the wealthiest clique attending a prestigious prep school. Of  course, Freddie is worse by far, caring nothing of what he says or does and  how it affects those around him. He is a boil on the butt of humanity,  purposely belittling others to define his own importance. You watch him,  you listen to him, and you immediately begin to detest him. Philip couldn't  have played it better! Cate Blanchett was mediocre as Meredith Logue, a  fellow spoiled rich kid from old money. Her character was merely a plot  device, someone who showed up just when things were working out for Tom.  She was a rubber band that snapped him into action when he least expected  it, forcing him to improvise. It was interesting to watch Tom fumble about  and think fast, but there are so many other actresses who could've played  the part equally or better.
My only qualm with this film is the length  that it takes to reach its climax. Clocking in at nearly 2.5 hours, you  wonder if all the him-hawing about is actually necessary. This film is  metaphorical in its essence, including the scene where Ripley is riding a  motorbike through a busy alley and is unnerved by guilty conscience as  Dickie's face appears in every reflection of glass and mirror he crosses.  It all ends with a lingering camera angle of Ripley sitting upon a bed, his  image reflected infinitely in the mirrored opening over before the doors  finaly close on him for the last time. Darkly poetic and allegorical,  Minghella lends that feathery touch to film that Highsmith's richly  textured prose was meant to convey. All in all, this is an enthralling  story with strong performances and exceptional cinematography. An  ""A"" in my book and a five-star rating for Amazon members  interested in an exquisite piece of filmmaking.",966816000,3,7061,4.979399141630902

The very  elegant and novel visual cinematic effects enhance the overall impact.  Jude Law has a very powerful presence, with Damon following in his tracks  (as an actor, and, literally - as Mr. Ripley, the character), and Paltrow  slipping into pitiful over-the-top dramatic oblivion towards the end of the  movie.

137532,4,0792165039,"I detested the sappy ""The English Patient"", but director Anthony Minghella has redeemed himself in  my eyes with the taunt and creepy  thriller, ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" Matt Damon is quite  effective,  I think, as the covetous Ripley, a man who has no identity or  personality of his own to speak of, and  is also a closeted homosexual. In  a case of mistaken identity (and blatant opportunism on his part)  Ripley  lucks into a job offered by the very rich Mr. Greenleaf to go to Italy and  retrieve his wayward  son, Dickie (effectively played by the gorgeous Jude  Law.) Dickie, however, plans to stay in country  and marry his handsome  girlfriend Marge Sherwood(Gwyneth Paltrow.) Dickie and his lifestyle is so  seductive, that  Ripley plans to inject himself permanently into it, rather  than return with the prodigal to the States,  with sinister and tragic  results. The Italian coastline is breathtaking. Matt Damon, Jude law, and  the  always watch able Philip Seymour Hoffman register well in their roles.  Gwyneth Paltrow has little to  do, but is perfectly cast as Dickie's  thoroughbred girlfriend. Lovely Cate Blanchett has a  small, but pivotal  roll. The ending of this movie is creepy and effective in the extreme, as  Ripley pays  for his sins in an extremely painful personal way (even as he  eludes the legal ramifications of his acts.)",966729600,,1360,4.973094170403588

137540,4,0792165039,"Having seen the earlier French film version - PURPLE NOON - of Patricia Highsmith's novel with Alain Delon perfectly cast as the poisonous Tom  Ripley, there was naturally a good deal of curiosity in seeing the latest  incarnation. In some ways the newer version exceeds the earlier one, in  that Minghella does better with the actors.  In terms of script and story,  though, PURPLE NOON is the more tightly written and directed, with a  tantalizingly satisfying - and indeed more shocking - resolution.  Where  the current version falters most, however, is in the conception (and  perhaps the casting) of the title role.  Matt Damon is a good actor, but he  is simply not right for this brand of character. Alain Delon's persona for  this role was perfectly apt, and his unsettling, spidery Tom Ripley is  exactly right: he conveyed something off-kilter and disturbing behind  Ripley's easy-going facade that left the viewer both uneasy and filled with  a kind of intrigued fascination as to what his next move would be. Damon's  naturally likable, college-boy persona is patently unsuited to enact the  sort of charming-but-dangerous-under-the-surface shrewdness.  When Damon  turns killer, he's puzzlingly unconvincing, and the motivations behind the  killings seem more dictated by the script rather than by the fundamental  nature of the character. In other words, he's not believable.  Damon has  demonstrated, as in his compelling portrayal of Will Hunting, that he can  play ""troubled and tortured"", but it's of a softer, more  vulnerable sort, and he's missing in the kind of coldly quirky, anything  goes-edginess of a role like Ripley. It has been suggested elsewhere that  Leonardo di Caprio might have been a suitable Ripley, and I agree; he has  the capability of playing exactly that feral, dangerous quality that Delon  possessed.
The two female leads, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett,  are excellent, surprisingly so. Actresses of today are never quite  believable, in both looks and portrayal, as women of another era. They  always seems to be slumming, and more often than not come across as  hopelessly contemporary - but Paltrow and Blanchett walk the walk and talk  the talk, and look fetchingly glamorous.
The real star of the picture  though, is Jude Law.  Maurice Ronet was OK as the earlier Greenleaf in  PURPLE NOON, but Law walks gaily off with THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY,  exhibiting an infectious joie de vivre, that, despite the character's  inherent skunkiness, is nevertheless captivating: this is someone you'd  want to party with, to share times of careless laughter, numerous toasts  and indulging with in endless roistering. Law is absolutely natural in the  rakish ease with which he plays his role; in fact he brings such a lift and  presence to the proceedings that when his character is bumped off, the air  is let out - poof - and the life is just sucked out of the movie, the fun  ends, and so we're stuck with the dull Mr. Ripley. Coincidentally (or  perhaps not), the story layout now begins to show inconsistencies, and the  series of events that lead to the climax is heavy on plot exposition,  unsatisfyingly so, and is lacking in the kind of edge-of-your-seat suspense  of the earlier film.  In PURPLE NOON, it was intriguing to watch the  unpredictable Ripley of Delon maneuver his way craftily around - you almost  wanted to see him succeed in his deception, so entertainingly did he play  his ""game.""  Damon's Ripley acts (or is made to act) as if scared  that his parents will catch him sneaking out of home in the middle of the  night: there's no cat-and-mouse vitality in his schemes to stay afloat and  out of trouble.  Despite the drawbacks, this movie is still a good  deal of fun, with great Meditteranean locales and cinematography, and most  especially is worth seeing for the star-making performance of Jude Law.",966124800,2,3874,5.0078740157480315
137541,3,0792165039,"This movie is a bit difficult to review because of some real highs and lows.  The plot seems a bit farfetched.  A father, meeting a young man who  claims to have known his son in college, pays him $1000 to go to Italy to  persuade the son to come back home.  (I kept wondering why the father  himself didn't go or why he didn't just cut off his allowance.)  Two of the  bright spots are the beautiful Italian scenery (really does make you want  to visit) and the acting of Jude Law, the spoiled, erratic son who is  wasting away his life in Italy.  He makes a rather sterotyptical character  seem complicated and sinister.  The pace of the movie is good and did keep  up my interest, wondering what these troubled young people were going to do  next.  Gwyneth Paltrow played Jude Law's love interest and seemed like a  doormat for his eccentric whims.  Matt Damon discovers that he likes Law's  and Paltrow's lifestyle and goes to any lengths to make sure that it  continues.  He attaches himself to them and learns the mannerisms and  habits of the idle rich.  When they tire of him, the action turns decidedly  dark.

137542,4,0792165039,"This movie is a remake of ""Purple Noon"", A French film made in the 1960s starring Alain Delon.  I frankly thought Matt Damon was going to  have trouble taking Delon's place.  However, writer-director Minghella  rewrote the script so that this version is very different from the first  one.  This version fit Matt Damon very well. The essentials are the same  for the two versions.  Tom Ripley (Damon) envies Dickie Greenleaf (Jude  Law) his privileged lifestyle and yearns to take his place.  He does so.  The whole story turns on these elements.  However, this version is a lot  more homoerotic than the first version.  In fact, the dynamic between Damon  and Law is so powerful that the two female leads, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate  Blanchett, drag behind in comparison.  I wish Jude Law's role could have  been much longer.  There is also more ambiguity in this version.  Does  Ripley (Damon) really wish to kill anyone?  I was never sure.  Damon even  somehow looks physically much better when playing his Dickie Greenleaf  imposter role than when he plays his real character, Tom Ripley.  How he  manages this feat, is beyond me.  There may have been too many characters  in this version which made the plot confusing at various points.  Jude Law  much deserved his Oscar nomination for playing Greenleaf and I hope this  movie opens up a lot more leading film roles for him.

137544,5,0792165039,"Every year, certain films are released that are completely misunderstood,  either by critics, or by the movie-going public and Anthony Minghella's  take on the Patricia Highsmith novel ""The Talented Mr Ripley""  falls into this category.
It was perceived as a suspense thriller, which  the trailer did nothing to dispel but it is so much more than that. It is a  thought provoking character study of a man so uncomfortable with his own  personality that he must try an inhabit that of another man, the  unfortunate Dickie Greenleaf. However to do so means a few murders and this  is where the film gets its marquee appeal. Matt Damon invests the role with  such subtlety that you are taken by surprise - no longer the apple-pie boy  of past films, here he is a sad character, and one which the audience feels  for, despite resorting to murder. It is a standout performance which  deserves far greater recognition. Jude Law confirms his status as the new  star in the sky (remember Joseph Fiennes?) and delivers his dark prey to  the willing Ripley. And Gwyneth Paltrow confirms her status as the new  Grace Kelly - so bright at the beginning of the film but by its end her  mood is much more sombre as she tries to expose Ripley. The rest of the  cast are uniformly excellent with Cate Blanchett adding to her CV with  another brilliant turn.
This is a superb movie and I advise anyone who  hasn't seen it to do so immediately. A thought-provoking supremely literate  and at times, bloody scary film.",965520000,26,1499,4.670498084291188

Anthony Minghella does a superb job of re-creating Italy in the  1950's - this is a beautifully stunning film that should only be viewed in  widescreen. The suspense begins about 45 minutes into the film, and just  keeps building.

137546,3,0792165039,"Many of the critics said that this movie was about a guy who wanted to stay in luxury and greed, so he became the talent who managed to get  through all the prosecution, invetigation and intrigues of his murder on  his wealthy ""friend"".
However, the movie was more than that.  The main stream lies more on the obsession of Matt Damon for Jude Law - the  obsession for  homosexual itimacy with this guy who turned out to be his  prey. In fact the story would have ended very early if Jude Law accepted  Matt's offer of being together when they were on the boat ride. However,  things didn't happened like that for it was required to have Jude Law  killed to put up a show for Matt.
Frankly, the second half of the movie  was pretty slow and over architectualled. Matt's relation of his new  ""lover"" and Gwyneth Paltrow were not developed well because Matt  was not able to control the show with his talent. This doesn't mean that he  did not act good, but the story line had made him somewhat deificient from  his potential acting. Probably the strong stealing effect of Jude Law in  the first part of the movie had also made the one-man-show of Matt too  heavy for the audiences. Gwyneth Paltrow was a bit wasted in the movie for  she could have done more than that. Her acting potential was not fully  exploited. Jude Law's character somewhat had a glimpse of shadow from his  roles in Wilde and Gatacca. Nonetheless, he is shining in the movie and  made it interesting.

137547,5,0792165039,"I was a fan of Patricia Highsmith's novel going into Anthony Minghella's film.  If you have ever read the book, you'll know there has been a great deal of change.  However, I was surprisingly pleased with Minghella's  version.  In fact, I've grown to love it more than the book.
It's a very  well made movie, from the haunting opening song by Sinead O'Connor to the  closing shot of a tormented Ripley.  The entire movie looks beautiful, with  cinematography by Minghella regular John Seale.  It is also a very musical  movie. Where Dickie was an artist in the book, he is now a jazz musician.  There are several nice scenes involving music that you'll enjoy if you are  a jazz fan.
What I adore most about Ripley is its story of a man who  desperatly wants to fit in.  Tom Ripley is a nobody in New York, he works  in an operahouse as a bathroom attendant.  He lives in a cruddy basement  apartment across from a butcher.  He cannot afford a piano, so he practises  on a paper keyboard.  One day, while subbing as an accompanist, Tom  stumbles onto an offer to go to Europe. Wealthy Mr. Greenleaf grants him a  mission to bring back his prodigal son.
When he arrives in Italy, he  realises he has the chance to become a somebody.  He is especially  enamoured with Dickie Greenleaf, who has a hypnotic effect on everyone he  meets.  What Tom doesn't particulary understand that Dickie is too  narcsistic to care about anyone other than himself.  Tom loses Dickie's  attention and is devasted.
...
Tom is a  character we root for, because he is the underdog.  He is not rich or  popular, truly deserving of a chance at something better.  A lot of people  describe this movie as disturbing, but only because of the level of  violence.  It disturbed me in the way it depicted a person trying to fight  their way of their station in life and failing. Ripley is basically a man  with good intentions who only wants to be liked.  He doesn't do anything  cold bloodily, he only [tries] to protect what little he has of his  character.  If Ripley can't be himself and succeed, what hope does any of  us have?",965174400,7,2100,4.5

Jude Law's character, Dickie, didn't really  captivate me. His character was inconsistent but maybe that is what he was  aiming for. I didn't feel the charisma the other characters felt for him.  He was basically conflicted over his bi-sexuality. He hated himself &  was a little off. I love Gwyenth Paltrow, but not in this movie. Her  character was necessary but she wasn't. The part was too light-weight. Any  actress could have played it. Actually Matt Damon as Tom Ripley did the  best job. He was not a psychopath as some reviewers have maintained. I  think his character resembled a much rarer & dangerous sociopath. It is  also much harder to play. The detectives were totally unbelivable as such  total morons.

137553,1,0792165039,"I saw this movie at the theater with a friend of mine, and then talked to my sister about it after she saw it for the first time, and we both come to  the same conclusion, with a slight difference in the wording.  I said, it  starts slow, finishes slow, and never picks up any speed in between.  My  sister put it more succintly, there's two and a half hours of my life I'll  never get back.
My main problem was that I didn't care about any of these  characters, or where the story was taking them.  Every single one of them  were self centered, egocentric blowhards, who if I had met in real life,  I'd like to kill too.  Maybe it wasn't even the characters, but the actors  themselves because they seemed to be sleepwalking through this picture, not  even really trying to give any kind of believable or interesting  performance.
The true problem is that the movie drags on and on, never  picking up any speed or invoking any kind of real feeling.  Once, the  hero/villian killed for the first time, I couldn't have cared less.  I  didn't like or dislike him any more than when the movie started, nor did I  care anything about the first man he kills. You just aren't made to care  about anyone in this movie, everyone, not just the main character, seems  amoral, and ill defined.
The moral of the movie: Become a leech, feed off  anyone and everyone for what you can get from them, and kill them when you  can no longer sponge off them, or they become a danger to you. Lovely,  isn't it?",964396800,17,1490,4.330909090909091

A bit overlong and the pace tends to drag at times but a handsome cast and high production values do more than pull it through. Matt Damon again shows us  his real acting talents, he creates a compelling Ripley but one can't help  but imagine other actors in the part. On the other hand, Jude Law is  perfect for the part of Dickey, he's an exciting and promising new talent.  Gwyneth Paltrow gives a sadly underrated performance, low-key but extremely  effective. Cate Blanchett and Phillip Seymour Hoffman are also great in  support. Anthony Minguella directs with a mix if low-key manipulation set  to picturesque backdrops that make for a satisfying experience.

His follow-up to ""The English Patient"", one of my favorite films ever made, is a stylish psychological thriller with  deserves the Hitchockian buzz it created.  It certainly deserved its Oscar  nomination as one of the best five films of 1999.
Matt Damon's  performance was superb as he showed his range.  This is not Good Will  Hunting.  He's an eery, disturbing character who transforms from beginning  to end in a very believable way.  He's not evil, and we practically  empathize with a man who commits multiple murders.
Some have complained  this is a boring movie, including my wife, but I think they were misled by  the advertisements preceding the film's release portraying it as a 90's  type of suspense/thriller.  It is a suspense/thriller, but more in the mode  of Hitchcock then today's films.  It is a character study, and a very  believable (and disturbing) one.",964310400,3,970,5.070063694267516

It's about about a character named Tom Ripley, played by Matt ""where's my partner Ben Affleck in this movie"" Damon. Ripley's  ""talent"" is to mimic and plagerize people. The whole movie didn't  show any signs of his motive what so ever. It didn't explain why Ripley was  impersonating someone from Dickie's (Jude Law) school, if he's really gay  or just playing the role, if he's murdered anyone before, what happens to  him later....It's just a mess of a story. Just imagine The Empire Strikes  Back, and not knowing Star Wars or Return of the Jedi! I kept waiting for  Dickie to come back, but he never did.

137557,5,0792165039,"Don't let the smiling faces of Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law on the cover fool you.  The Talented Mr. Ripley is a disturbing film.
And it's not a ""Silence-of-the-Lambs,"" ""what-if-this-really-happened""  kind of disturbing, either.  This story bothers us because the horrible  irony of the concluding scene is both unavoidable and hauntingly logical.  We have sympathized, even agreed, with Tom Ripley at each step in his  journey.  Unrequited envy, hopeless infatuation, and self-loathing are  too-common emotions, and although our consciences, unlike Ripley's, may  keep us from acting on them, his urges are our own.
We've known a Dickie  Greenleaf, a popular, talented go-getter who seems to have everything he  wants.  We've caught ourselves dressing, speaking, behaving like our idols.  We've felt that peculiar blend of lust, jealousy, and admiration that  makes us think thoughts we're ashamed of, start sentences we're embarrassed  to finish, and cling breathlessly to dreams of ""if only"" and  ""someday.""
There are moments in this film where Matt Damon and  Jude Law are the fiction--Tom Ripley and Dickie Greenleaf have such a REAL  relationship on-screen that we feel right along with Ripley the thrill of  sharing Dickie's laughter... the ache of admiring his beauty unnoticed...  the sting of his fickle rejection.  Paltrow, too, as the woman who has what  Ripley wants but wants what Ripley has, is spellbindingly real.  No one in  the film--including Ripley--ever seems completely to know what's going on,  and it's that sense of uncertainty perhaps that draws us so close to the  characters.
Just what is Mr. Ripley's talent?  Watch the film and see  what your answer is--my own answer hits a little too close to home.",964051200,9,1731,5.241758241758242

Hoffman and Cate  Blanchett. Gorgeous Locations. A very good story and a musical swing. If  you get the chance to watch the director's commentary on your DVD, I  strongly suggest you do so, because Minghella proves that he really knew  what he was doing. It's one of the most insightful commentaries I've ever  heard.  For some it might be hard to accept Ripley as the hero or see a  homoerotic Film at all, but it's sure worth it. And it's not about  Homsexuality, it's about being someone else - ""being a fake somebody  instead of a real nobody"". From the fantastic beginning, over the  murder of Dicky to the last shot of Tom reflecting in the mirrors:  Masterful.

It's great to see films that don't present such  black-and-white moral absolutism...it's a much more challenging experience.  As far as the rest of the film goes: the cinematography is stunning and may  make you call a travel agent. Not that I lived in Italy circa 1960 (or in  1960 at all), but Minghella really seems to get all of the period details  right, which greatly lends to the fantasy that this film exudes. The acting  is top-notch, with great performances by everyone involved, especially  Phillip Seymour Hoffman who makes mucho gravy out of a character with  little screen time, and the absoutely mesmerizing Jude Law as Dickie  Greenleaf. I understand that it's essential to the plot, but Law's presence  is so dazzling that when he leaves the film, it's just a little less  enjoyable to watch.

137562,5,0792165039,"""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is an intense look at how far someone can go to feel accepted, and ultimately not be accepted.  The story follows Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), a quiet musician, who has only accomplaished being  a bathroom attendent at an opera house, in 1950's New York.  Riley's class  gets altered when he is paid by wealthy Herbert Greenleaf, to bring his  son, spoiled, rich bratt Dickie (played to perfection by Jude Law) home.  When Tom becomes obsessed with the life style Dickie is living, he can't  pull away, and expresses his homo-erotic feelings to Dickie, who is cruelly  creeped out by Tom.  Things go haywire when Tom kills his obsession,  Dickie, and tries to assume Dickie's life, and the corse of the story  spirells into a masterful plot where the villian of the story is the  protagonist.  Anthony Minghella constructs a wonderful tapestry, of beauty,  luxory, hatered, and suspence with the Italian Riviera as it's background.  Gwyneth Paltrow plays Dickies girlfriend, who is confused by his  disappearence; Kate Blanchett plays tacky-rich-American-tourist Meredith  who thinks she is seduced by Ripley, who she believes is Dickie, and does a  convincingly wonderful job as well; and Phillip Seymore Hoffman plays  Dickie's best friend, spoiled, playboy Freddie.  What was so fascinating  about ""Ripley"" is that Minghella uses wonderful scenes and shots  to capture the stories suspence.  He also makes you feel sorry for Tom  Ripley, because he brings out the regection factor all of us have  experienced in some way.  While most of us would never kill in this  circomstance, we all know what its like to be treated cruelly by people we  thought were friends, but only really care about themselves.  That is the  bottom-line theme of the story.  DVD just enhances the enjoyment with all  the extra features. From storyboards, to the making-of documentary feature,  to Minghella's commentary of the movie, the DVD is worth every penny.  While many people hated the movie, I found it very interesting,  cinematographic, excellent, and very well done.",963360000,2,2077,5.116766467065868
137563,4,0792165039,"This is one of the most visually stunning films that I have seen in a while. Except for a brief opening segment set in New York, the remainder of the film takes place in Italy and Venice. Not since David Lean's  ""Summertime"" has a film been so beautifully presented. That said,  it does suffer from some flaws when it comes to plot and editing. First of  all, it is way too long and should have clocked in under 2 hours instead of  a meandering 2 hrs, 20 minutes. But the major flaw is the casting and  development of Ripley's character. Matt Damon is physically wrong for the  part, and while he does a commendable job, if you have read the book,  Damon's casting will gnaw at you. An actor such as Jack Davenport (who  plays Peter) would fit the character of Ripley better. The biggest downfall  of the film, however, is Ripley's character development. He simply doesn't  gel. In the book, Ripley is a cold and calculating man who cleverly plots  his actions - in the film, Ripley seems to fall accidentally into his  misdeeds. Tom Ripley would not hesitate to apologize for clobbering Dickie  with a boat paddle - he would do it until the deed was done.

For those of you who rate a movie based on how close it is to the novel, this may disappoint.  There are a number of areas where this movie goes far from the novel.  Many  of which actually make the story more believeable, some of which detract,  and then of course, the usual set of things which would take to long or be  impossible to explain in a movie.
As far as the movie taken only as  itself it was excellent.  It even manages to take a miss on the  cookie-cutter items of most modern american movie making (lots of sex  scenes, gore and things blowing up) while being very thrilling and  suspenseful.  And best of all they save you from one of the final scenes  which you don't want to ""see"" though you want to know what  happened in a clever way...

As far as the  actors, Matt Damon does an excelent job of playing Ripley, despite the fact  he's not quite right for the part.  Ripley strikes me as a very slim  scrawny yet tall fellow, Matt Damon just doesn't Look like Ripley  (especially from the description in the book).  Secondly, he doesn't look  much like Dickie whom he impersonates.
The actor playing Dickie was  truely excellent (his name escapes me).  He was the perfect flakey, spoiled  brat Dickie.
Gweneth Paltrow was at her usual.  Her character was a bit  more likeable in the movie than in the book.  She did an excellent job  playing the upper class ""writer"" adoring girlfriend.  It wasn't  much of a part for her considerable talents, but she played it well.

From the  beginning there are so many holes in this story of a man trying to live the  life of another, that it is almost impossible to understand the intent of  what you are watching. Was this movie supposed to be the insight into a  serial killer of the 1940's or 50's? How did Matt Damons charcter turn  homicidal so quickly? Jude Law was alright as the 1 dimensional charcter he  portrayed, but Oscar material? C'mon, he doesn't even live through half the  movie. The always good Phil Seymour Hoffman ( a favorite of director Paul  Thomas')I could see having to be offed, as he was an obstacle to Ripley.  But why kill Paul at the end? It served no purpose but to try to bring the  meandering movie to a close! It also made no sense when Ripley turned  homosexual almost overnite.

Were  we also watching a movie about a character searching for his sexual  identity as well as his purpose in life?

137577,3,0792165039,"In regards to movies as an art form, `The Talented Mister Ripley' easily scores five stars out of the possible five. However, if you watch movies for pure entertainment, this movie would barely scratch by with one.
  Ever since I started getting interested in film I have had frequent  debates about what makes a movie great. I guess it really comes down to a  combination of art form and raw entertainment. This movie has all the  elements a film needs to be a work of art; brilliant cinematography, an  equal in quality film score, a close to flawless script, and top notch  acting from an all-star cast. Instantly you are in the 50s and surrounded  by beautiful Italian landscape. Matt Damon, Gwineth Paltrow, and Judd Law  deliver their best performances to date, giving this Hitchkock-esc film a  chance to be one of the best thrillers of all time. Philip Seymour Hoffman  plays Dickie Greenleaf's spoiled friend Freddie Miles and proves again why  he is one of the rising stars in Hollywood. All of these elements combined  create a believable plot no matter how psychotic it turns.
  Reminiscent to the main characters of the movie `Very Bad  Things', Tom Ripley tries to cover up past events by killing anyone who  gets in his way. This was an entertaining string of events in the movie  `Very Bad Things', however it didn't work so well in this movie.  Many of  the others that wrote reviews about this flick have claimed that after each  killing they found themselves attached more to the plot and closer to the  edge of their seat. I, however, went in the opposite direction due to the  slow evolvement of the plot and the longevity of the film. Unfortunately  the lack in entertainment is why this movie is not one of the best  thrillers of all time.
  We are presented here with  an amazing idea for a film, an inferior person assuming the identity of  someone else to improve personal status. However the product of this  amazing idea is less than it's potential. If the answer to the question  what makes a movie great is that it must be equally entertaining as  artistic, then `The Talented Mister Ripley' ends up with a compromising  three stars out of five.",962409600,,2175,4.669312169312169

The music score is mesmerizing and assists  in seducing us into fallling in love with people who share their evil side  while masking their whole being beneath the facade of The Upper Class.

137579,5,0792165039,"In a time when most American films are either shoot 'em up CGI extravaganzas, or exercises slacker self pity, The Talented Mr. Ripley is a welcome return to an earlier, more elegant era.  This has been referred to  by some as the best Hitchcock movie that Hitchcock never made, and that  description is apt.  Hitchcock adopted another Patricia Highsmith novel  ""Strangers on a Train"", but, due to the censorship restrictions  of the 1950s, had to leave certain aspects of the novel unsaid.  Anthony  Minghella doesn't have to restrain himself in that regard.  He has  carefully made minor changes in tone from the novel, and made various  aspects of Ripley's character clearer than they were previously.  But he  wisely avoids being ""in your face"", keeping the movie's 1958  setting very believable.
The performances are all first rate here.  Matt  Damon further extends his versatility as the chameleon like Ripley.  Jack  Davenport, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett are also winning.  But the  two standout performances here are in supporting roles.  Jude Law's Dickie  Greenleaf is just the seductive but cold rich kid who can have anyone he  wants, usually does, and then tosses them aside.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman  is appropriately irritating as Dickie's best friend, who is wise to  Ripley's game from the start.
Cinematography and score are on a level we  seldom see in films anymore.
Paramount (working with Miramax) has done a  first-class job with every aspect of this DVD.  Minghella's commentary is  enlightening, as he explains why he chose certain cast members, how he came  to make various changes to Highsmith's story, and the difficulties of  shooting on location.  In addition to the two theatrical trailers, the  making of featurettes and behind the scenes extras are entertaining and  enlightening.

137582,3,0792165039,"If you add up all the various aspects of this film, it should have been terrific.  It had a hot and talented young cast, all of whom gave good to great performances.  It had wonderful locations, costumes, props and music.  It had an intriguing plot.  And yet by the end all I felt was  ennui.
This was a case of a director who couldn't induce the full  potential out of his various resources.  Anthony Minghella does a fine job  on the cinematography and choice of beautiful locations in Italy, but his  crafting of the story left it predictable and flaccid.  This was supposed  to be both a character study and a thriller.  It was inadequate on both  counts.
In a well made character study the viewer will come to understand  the motivations of the characters.  This film never delivers in this  regard.  The only character that was well developed was Dickie (Jude Law).  Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a mystery, just a hanger on.  Meredith (Cate  Blanchett) was nothing more than a plot device.  But the biggest reason it  came up short was because the motivation of Ripley (Matt Damon) was left  too ambiguous.  Was Ripley a cunning con man orchestrating a grand caper,  an inept interloper who bungled his way through a propitious opportunity, a  victim of circumstances, an unrequited gay lover who committed a crime of  passion and then needed to cover his trail?  Take your pick.  Minghella  doesn't tell the story in a way that makes this clear.
As a thriller, it  lacked surprise.  Every murder was telegraphed.  The private investigator  gives Ripley a pass at the end, obviating the need for Ripley to provide  some clever explanation for all the inconsistencies.  There was not a  single twist in the entire film.  It had all the intrigue of playing open  handed bridge.
For all the raves I've read about Matt Damon's  performance, I found it rather uneven.  Sometimes he came across as a  clever mastermind and at others a wounded puppy.  It seemed like he wasn't  really sure how to play the character.  Again, I put the responsibility for  this on Minghella.  I'd call it a generally good performance of a difficult  character, but not even close to his dynamism in `Good Will Hunting'.
This was a shining moment for Jude Law who gave a career performance as  Dickie.  He basically stole the show out from under Damon's nose.  He  endowed his character with exuberance, and a cavalier live-for-today  attitude that made him charismatic despite his callousness and  irresponsibility.  I enjoyed his performance in the unheralded `Music From  Another Room' but this one was even better.  If he keeps improving like  this, he will be a force to be reckoned with.
I rated this film a 6/10 on  the strength of Law's performance and the cinematography.  The telling of  the story fell flat and robbed this film of its real potential.",962236800,2,2840,4.755693581780538

137584,5,0792165039,"Oh, what a tangled web they weave! And the talented Tom Ripley has no problem morphing from one personality, one lie, one character to another.  Amoral he is and amoral he intends to stay.
In ""The Talented Mr.  Ripley,"" Matt Damon deserved his Oscar nomination as he chameleons  himself from one predicament (or one privileged setting) to another as  Hollywood chooses to adapt a real thriller.  Author Patricia Highsmith's  Mr. Ripley is far more graphic and her novels are far more intense--yes,  frightening--than this movie provides.  That said, however, credit is to be  given for this cinematic effort.  Damon, with this role, certainly provides  the evidence that he is more than a one-dimensional actor (and more than a  pretty face and body!).
Certainly Damon's portray of this  ""homocidal"" maniac is convincing and, as in any story where the  anti-hero is the pivotal character, naturally, some aspects of his  personality are palatable. He is at times most ingratiating, pleasant, and  when he suffers abuse from his host (Jude Law is Dickie Greenleaf), we can  feel sympathy.  His is a character that feels no boundaries--and certainly  no remorse--for his actions.  He moves from one dilemma to another with  such ease that even that is frightening. Director Anthony Minghella  (""The English Patient"") has the perfect backdrop for a  film--Italy.  Set in the late 50s, the film seems to capture all the  detail, the nuances, the atmosphere of that time, and quite convincingly.  Easily, Minghella could have made the film with more graphic violence  (after all, Patricia Highsmith didn't spend time in a Texas insane asylum  for nothing!), but the film, really, keeps the blood and gore to a minimum  (thankfully).
Gwyneth Paltrow comes through strongly as well (as  Greenleaf's finance) and with such disarming charm.  (It has always been a  pleasure to see her in a film.)
In ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,""  we have a film that certainly leaves one disturbed.  It is powerful--but  disturbing.

137587,5,0792165039,"The Talented Mr. Ripley, is a film that goes well beyond the reviewer's grasp. It is a film, rich in complexities, coupled with a technical brilliance that makes us stop in our tracks to be awed by its composition.  Its theme begins with a Jamesian plot (most closely resembling The  Ambassadors) then spins into film noir so breathlessly, so gracefully that  it takes our minds a bit to catch up.
The film begins with the  presentaton of Mr. Tom Rippley, a piano tuner an aspiring classical  musician and a a hotel attendant, who is able to initially deceive a  shipping tycoon into going to Europe to rescue his son,to bring him back to  the states. The only difference is age between Ripley and the character of  Lambert Stetson from The Ambassadors.
The parent trusts his son and  Ripley in not being caught up with those European influences that would  corrupt those pure American sensibilities. There are moments , in the first  movement of the film that shows us Ripley's authentic sensibility.
An  example is, when in his attendant uniform snecking to play measures of  Bach's Italien Concerto and being shooed away by an attentant immerses us  (as illustrated again a number of times throughout the film) into the  character of Ripley's essential softness and vulnerability. That this is  balanced by a clear, calculating razor sharp awareness of his surroundings  and his manipulatives ways in placing himself amid this ""old  wealth""; a closed social order that he is permitted to bask and  partake of. He is Clyde Griffith from An Americn Tragedy, but with a  stronger more aggresive way of handling that rather dim couple of Marsha  and Dickie. There are also comic echoes of Paul Pennypaker from Waugh's  Decline and Fall here that also lends credence to his  social aspirations,  a feeling of being comfortable with his deceptions, and never ultimately  having to pay the piper.",961891200,,1892,4.9113924050632916
137588,1,0792165039,"This movie, picturesquely set in a well depicted recreation of the Italy of the fifties, was an incredible desecration of the classic style of Hitchcock's film noir observations of the pure evilness of certain types of  psychopathic id.  I am recalling ""Strangers on a Train"" and  ""Shadow of a Doubt"".
I was really looking forward to seeing  Matt Damon portray the primary character, a non-entity who takes on the  personality of a Princeton reprobate (Jude Law, nominated for an Oscar for  best supporting actor) living in idle luxury off his ""allowance""  in Italy,  together with his fiance, played by Gwyenth Paltrow. Paltrow  seems to have studied Audrey Hepburn's breathy voice and mannerisms to  portray her role as the fifties style, pretty, but weak and overbred,  upperclass fiance. She does a good job, but the role is essentially minor.  That the role is minor is a typical deficit in this off balance  movie.
Jude Law, as the Princeton ""bad boy"", does a good job as  well, but he is not worthy of the nomination he got for supporting actor.  Why?  Because the script is perfectly awful and he is forced to play his  part within the major limitations of the script.  I liked seeing him tear  it up in a jazz dive but the charisma he is supposed to  have, and the  classy background he was supposed to be born to, was not conveyed clearly  enough to me.

His facial expressions run the gamut from  his usual teeth baring, ingenuous, open smile, to that half sneering, half  open smile he had in ""Good Will Hunting"".  How has he gotten so  far as an actor?  I am astounded that this movie got any good reviews at  all.  It was interminable, poorly written, and had only one thing going for  it:  the scenery of Italy lensed through a big pile of American movie  money.

137590,5,0792165039,"Being on the side of moviegoers that hated ""The English Patient"", I was not expecting much when I first saw this new film by director Anthony Mighella in theaters. But it is a disturbing, compelling  thriller that has been beautifully shot on location in Italy.
The acting  is outstanding - Jude Law received a much-deserved Supporting Actor  nomination for his role in this film. But Matt Damon, who is in every scene  as the tale is told entirely from his point of view, was clearly overlooked  for his subtle performance in the title role.
The bonus features on this  DVD include scene-specific commentary by Minghella, two theatrical  trailers, a collection of interesting interviews with the cast and the  director, two featurettes, and two music videos featuring clips from the  film. More than the usual, but nothing to write home about. But the 1.85:1  aspect ratio of the DVD does the beautiful cinematography and frame  composition justice. And that's actually what makes this disc a must-have.  But be warned that the layer transfer (when Freddy knocks and interrupts  Tom's piano playing) is noticeable and annoying, at least on the copy I  have.
I wish this film had done better in theaters, as the rest of the  ""Ripley"" books by Patricia Highsmith would have made for  excellent sequels. But it looks like this film will have to stand on its  own... and it does a brilliant job of doing just that.",961545600,2,1411,4.836820083682008
137591,5,0792165039,"Riffing as it does on the Cain and Abel story from the Bible, RIPLEY is a lyrical and melancholic study of a gifted lower-class boy (Damon)who trades own soul for that of a spoiled, narcissistic playboy (Law) in the course of  his coveting the sybaritic lifestyle enjoyed by the narcissist and his  vapid girlfriend (Paltrow).  The homosexual underpinnings are essentially  inconsequential, although they add some spice to the proceedings.  The true  pyschological study here is a focus on how covetousness leads to greed and  greed flips one so easily into the realm of sociopathy (one could venture  to say it's an astute comment on today's ""gimme everything""  America).  Jude Law's Dickie is a classic sociopath - charming, charismatic  - bouncing from one bright bauble to another, and sucking the blood out of  anyone on his way without remorse or consciousness. In the hands of Law, he  is fascinating, sexy, and despicable, and we root for his death at one  point when he tosses away Ripley's naive love like yesterday's tee shirt.  Damon deserved better reviews that he received: his Ripley is an opaque  being who is gradually formed as he masters more and more conflict in the  course of the film, and by the time he has found himself saddled with the  murderous soul of the man he loved, he's twice as fascinating as when the  film began.  Not an easy part to play as reconceived from Highsmith's novel  by director Minghella.  Seymour Hoffman's turn as a bully, Cate Blanchett's  utterly stellar presence as a devil-may-care socialite, Gabriel Yared's  heartbreaking score, and Minghella's swan song to the 'La Dolce Vita' years  all add up to a mesmerizing experience.  It's the kind of thriller Brian de  Palma wishes he could have summoned the talent to make, but never did.  Impregnated with many stunning visual motifs (statues, ominous neckties,  vulnerable necks), and drenched in Italian ambience, RIPLEY is the treat of  1999.  One wonders how it ever escaped the studios as intact as it did.  As  the final song over the end credits says, ""you don't  know what love  is, until you you know the meaning of the blues.""

The story, set in and around stunning Italian coastal hot spots, circa the 50s, remains fresh and infinitely  compelling; the main character, Tom Ripley, is that fascinating mix of  vulnerability and psychotic killer, much like Norman Bates in Psycho.  Matt  Damon does his best with this role; casting him I think was the film's one  half misstep -- Damon exudes such a glamour and self-possession that it is  difficult to wholly buy his insecurity, though adding more than a hint of  homosexuality does much to make him more believable. The other  performances, however, are riveting.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is perfection  as a smart, slick, obnoxious friend of Dickie's; Cate Blanchett, an added  character, is engrossing, funny and heartbreaking, too; Gwenyth Paltrow,  often overlooked in the reviews for this film, is spectacular in each and  every scene, conveying the privilege of her class and also her  near-desperate need for Dickie's love.  But Jude Law emerges as a superstar  in the movie -- he has the matinee-idol look of 50s stars, and does an  amazing job of creating Dickie Greenleaf, that kind of shiny, sexy person,  someone who has it all, with a cavalier indifference to those who love him  most.  The musical score is evocative and moving.  The opening credits, an  artistic risk, set up, with glossy, hynotic camera work, a film that will  often leave you breathless.

137594,3,0792165039,"THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is really a shame.  Here are all the elements of an engaging, literate thriller--decent performances, a remarkably disturbing and insightful story (thanks largely to Patricia Highsmith's  novel), a chillingly atmospheric score, and a well-realized sense of time  and place.  The trouble is, I didn't give a damn.  This movie is so poorly  paced, so slow and uninvolving, that watching it is like trying to slog  through a pond of molasses.
It doesn't help that Matt Damon is the wrong  choice for the elusive psychopath, Tom Ripley.  Damon isn't a bad actor,  just a miscast one, and while he nails the various impersonations Ripley  must perform and seamlessly switches between identities, he never really  fascinates or enthralls on-screen.  It also doesn't help that Jude Law, as  Dickie Greenleaf, completely upstages Damon in an Oscar-nominated  performance that's equal parts fire and ice.  The only character less  interesting than Ripley is Dickie's long-suffering fiancee, Marge, played  by a terribly dull Gwyneth Paltrow, who looks almost as bored by the story  as I was.
There are a few great, nail-biting scenes that expertly raise  the tension, including the murder sequences and a climactic confrontation  between Ripley and Marge.  If only the rest of this movie were as  rivetingly suspenseful.  The denouement takes about half an hour to  unravel--I soon lost count of the number of times I thought, ""Oh,  good, this is finally wrapping up"" before the script dashed my  expectations by plunging ahead with some new plot contrivance that would  require an extra ten minutes to play out.  Even at under two and a half  hours, this movie feels eons longer than an equally self-indulgent project  like...oh, say, TITANIC.  The truth is, RIPLEY is smarter, craftier, and  more psychologically plausible than TITANIC ever was.  It's not a better  film, though.  How sad is that?",961200000,6,1914,5.160655737704918
137595,3,0792165039,"Evidence of the Oscar-winning talent that constitutes director Anthony ""The English Patient"" Minghella's crew is splattered all over this sumptuous film. Once again, Minghella, aided immensely by his director of  photography, John Seale, showcases his gift for cinematically recreating  specific times and places with a painstaking exactitude of detail and an  unparalleled richness. As we follow Tom Ripley (played by an almost  emaciated Matt Damon) from his humdrum New York existence to the golden  beaches of 1950's Italy, we easily allow ourselves to be lost in  Minghella's stunning world of bronzed and beautiful Italian natives and the  fair-skinned American trust-fund-babies that saunter about their shores.  Minghella makes it very easy for us to understand how and why a young man  like Tom Ripley, who comes from a thankless blue-collar background, could  allow himself to be seduced by the idle ways of these idle rich. And,  indeed, it is during the first hour of The Talented Mr. Ripley that the  film is on its most sure footing. It is during this time that we are  introduced to a fascinating array of characters, ranging from the charming  and gorgeous Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), to his beautiful blonde-haired  socialite girlfriend Marge Sherwood, to the adorably aloof Meredith Logue  (Cate Blanchett), and, of course, to the spoiled and obnoxious Freddie  Miles (a minor role played deliciously by the excellent-as-usual Philip  Seymour Hoffman).
However, this film's fatal flaw is that it suddenly  shifts gears at the halfway point, and the story just as quickly loses  confidence in where it is supposed to go next. Indeed, it almost seems as  if Minghella devoted so much attention to setting up this incredible world  with its incredible characters that he had little energy left to devote to  the crux of Patricia Highsmith's novel, which concerns a poor young  outsider who violently subverts the well-to-do world that he discovers he  can never truly be a part of; but he does all of this (and this is  important, for it is where Minghella's interpretation fails) out of an  envious fury that the audience is supposed to be able to relate to, a fury  spawned by the deeper ills that come from class division and prejudice. In  other words, the audience is supposed to delight in Ripley's brutal  killings, even if we are simultaneously appalled by them. We are supposed  to be able to root for Tom Ripley, the underdog, much as we find ourselves  oddly rooting for the Patrick Bateman character in Mary Harron's American  Psycho precisely because we understand his fury at being stuck in the  uniquely American web of shallow consumerism, commercial brainwashing, and  material greed. Instead of developing Tom Ripley in a way that will allow  his modern audience to relate to his rash actions, Minghella makes the  mistake of trying to cater to a contemporary sensibility by making explicit  Ripley's homosexuality, which was only hinted at in Highsmith's novel.  Thus, much of the fascination with the character of Tom Ripley in the book  is lost in the movie, and we often find ourselves laughing at this pathetic  wretch with his silly lustful infatuation than sympathizing with  him.
Even on a structural level, the film's second half fails. Once  Ripley commits his first and most important murder, the languid but  alluring pace of the first half of the film suddenly gives way to a  dizzying flurry of jumbled events, with Ripley stumbling upon one sloppy  murder after another until the very end, when Minghella basically just cuts  the film short and decides to end it. Even those that greatly admire this  film must acknowledge the abruptness of its conclusion, which is meant to  be profound -- with Tom Ripley sitting alone, fresh off of another kill,  his fractured reflection bouncing off of a mirror and revealing his cracked  and empty soul -- but is really just a fancy end to a very sudden chain of  events that leaves the audience reeling and, ultimately,  unimpressed.
Still, Minghella's latest film is very much worth watching  if just as a showcase for his superb ability to transport his audience to  an intricately, lovingly fabricated world. And that alone is a commendable  achievement by any filmmaker.",961027200,18,4263,5.054676258992806

It is a deeply character driven psychological drama, with many twists.  The director  invites us to enter the head of Mr. Ripley (Matt Damon), who has some  psychological issues, he is not happy with who he is, so he pretends to be  someone else.  This is where the conflict begins, because it brings up some  serious problems and tension.  Mr. Ripley is one of the most well written  characters I have seen in a movie, period.  I have never seen such a deep  character.  Not to mention the beautiful scenery, cinematography, music and  editing that the movie has.  The wonderful acting just adds to this  disturbing and thought provoking treat.  The movie also teaches us not to  pretend and be who we are, because even though it is hard, a lie will stick  with you and be harder.  If you haven't seen this movie, give it a try,  it's most likely not what you expect.

137599,5,0792165039,"When I hear that Hollywood is doing a re-make of a French film, I cringe.  I have read the book and seen Rene Clement's fantastic film ""Purple Noon"" before, so my only consolation was that Anthony Minghella was the one who made a new version.  I am happy to say that his film turned out to be as interesting, if not more, as the French one.
ABOUT THE FILM ITSELF: Minghella took the story, changed it almost entirely, and created his own interpretation of Ripley.  Yet, he also managed not to destroy Patricia Highsmith's original story. The superficial suspence has been removed from Minghella's version: Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is less vicious and less determined in his plans.  Minghella revealed many psychological layers in Highsmith's story and added his own.  None of the changes he made spoil the story. For example, in the film Dickie Greenleaf plays sax, instead of being an aspiring painter. In both cases, he is not much of a talent.  But thanks to this change, we get to hear a lot of great jazz music that transports us into the 50's. Minghella also introduced some new characters into the story.
If you enjoy Minghella's films and/or psychologically challenging issues, then, you should watch this film.  If you wanted to see this film only because of its suspence angle, you could be disappointed. This film is not as suspenful as the French film or the book itself.
Matt Damon made a great appearance in this film. I am glad that he took the ""risk"" and accepted the role of Tom Ripley.  He turned out to be an excellent Ripley and showed himself as a worthy artist.  Jude Law should get a big credit for his Dickie Greenleaf.  His Dicki is much more complex and enticing than the one in the book and the ""Purple Noon"".  Law even managed American accent quite well.  I only regret that Gwyneth Paltrow's wardrobe and hammed up scenes took too much attention, whereas the true beauty and talent this time (as always) was Cate Blanchett.  Finally, since the film was shot in Italy, most scenes are breathtakingly beautiful and literally musical.
Well, enough said, let's go & watch the film!",960422400,6,2105,4.6875

I think that  he gave a great performance and with the help of Gwyneth Paltrow how can you go wrong. The cast in this movie is very  talented! Jude Law was a big but good surprise. The best part about this  movie other than the acting was that it was filmed in Italy and the  costumes were made very well.  Grade:B+,959817600,,398,4.116883116883117
137602,2,0792165039,"Readers of Patricia Highsmith will of course not recognize this latest incarnation of her creation, and that's not necessarily what's disappointing about it.  (Movies from novels are by definition an  ""adaption"".)  Heck, you can change the whole darn thing . . . as  long as you have something intelligent to add, a logical characterization  to create, or a style that's all your own.
Anthony Minghella's  *The  Talented Mr. Ripley*  has the style, but that's about all he contributed.  The movie  (as opposed to the book)  is about a disaffected young social  climber  (Matt Damon)  who falls in love with a wealthy young expatriate  named Dickie Greenleaf.  Ripley also falls in love with Greenleaf's  lifestyle . . . you can take it from there.  Needless to say, the  friendship goes sour, but Ripley still loves that lifestyle.  Early in the  movie, Minghella blithely sets up a couple of scenes where Ripley proves  himself a mimic -- this is supposed to satisfy us that Ripley will easily  impersonate the obviously soon-to-be-dead Dickie.  But, curiously, Ripley  doesn't act like Dickie:  he acts like himself, with better tailoring.  Whatever.
It's the problem of this movie as a whole:  no logic.  Minghella changes Highsmith's stone-cold sociopath into an overtly  homosexual sad sack who kills out of self-defense  (the movie encourages  you to put yourself in Ripley's shoes -- of COURSE you'd have to kill  So-and-So!).  In the second half, Ripley gets another boyfriend and they  live contentedly together.  Yes yes, but couldn't Ripley have done all this  back in New York, in the Village?  Was being a homosexual in Italy in the  50's really so much easier than in New York?  There's just no logic  here.
Speaking of Italy, there's too much of it.  The endless scenery . .  . enough already!  It bogs the movie down.  For how long can we stand  beautiful young Americans quaffing cocktails in the rosy-fingered glow of  the southern Italian coastline?  This is the  *Travel Channel*, not a  suspense thriller.  Late in the movie, when the police gets involved,  Minghella finally restrains himself and devotes himself to the story, but  it's too little, too late.
For praise, I single out the soundtrack.  Also, Cate Blanchett -- the only charming person in a movie supposedly full  of charming people.  *The Talented Mr. Ripley*  is worth a look, but  beware:  it's ultimately a burnished bore.",959644800,6,2412,4.974619289340102
137603,5,0792165039,"This is one of the best psychological thrillers I have ever seen.  The scenery is so picturesque and beautiful it is hard to pull your eyes away from it.  The acting is wonderful.  Jude Law and Gweneth Paltrow show off  their incredible acting abilities here and really make their characters  believable.  But, the best performance is that of Matt Damon, who plays the  role of Tom Ripley with such elegance and skill you feel like you are right  there with him; going through everything he goes through.  The plot is  complex and keeps you interested until the very end.  The suspense is  well-crafted and, in many scenes, leaves you breathless.  The murders are  few and far inbetween, but memorable because of their extremely graphic  nature.  They leave you uneasy until the next occurs.  Top-notch acting,  superb direction, and a very complex plot make ""The Talented Mr.  Ripley"" one of the best films of the year.

The only thing wrong with this  movie is that Matt Damon didn't get nominatd for Best Actor. He did a  marvellous job, as did Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law especially. An all-star  cast to die for!
Tom Ripley (Damon) has been sent to collect a young lady  (Paltrow) to take her back to her father in which Ripley works for. Instead  of taking her back, he stays with her and her husband, (Law) and Ripley  kindly befriends him and they become best buddies.

137605,4,0792165039,"""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is about a shy, insecure, young man named Tom Ripley who unexpectedly gets the chance to participate in the sweet life in Italy in the 1950's. This 'dolce vita' is made possible by  the father of Dickie Greenleave, who wants Ripley to travel to Italy to  persuade his son to return to America. But Tom Ripley enjoys the life in  Europe and the fact that he's no longer a nobody. Eventually he kills  Dickie and makes his identity his own.
This storyline sounds very  Hitchcockian and the film is definitly made in this tradition. There is the  typical theme of identity crisis (Tom Ripley also turns out to be gay) and  the finale is appropriately chilling. The cast members all deliver fine  performances. It's a pity that Jude Law received more critical kudos for  his work than Matt Damon. I think Damon's part is the more difficult  because his Tom Ripley is a more multi-facetted character than Law's Dickie  Greenleave. The beautiful cinematography by John Seale and Gabriel Yared's  fine music score are also worth mentioning.
There are some slow  stretches in the middle section, but all in all, director/writer Anthony  Minghella delivered a fine thriller that brings back the days of the  Hitchcock-thriller.",959126400,2,1244,4.913461538461538
137606,4,0792165039,"(warning: spoilers) This film started off very well; the beautiful, carefree Italian environment and its beautiful carefree ex-pat inhabitants were suitably enticing, allowing us to understand their appeal to Ripley.  At the same time, the film gradually develops Ripley's darker side - his  instability, his at-once childish and devious behaviour in the company of  the golden couple (Dickie and Marge), and ultimately his amorality.
 One  of the most telling scenes in the film is when local girl Silvana,  impregnated and abandoned by playboy Dickie, is found to have drowned  herself. We see Dickie's less glamorous side: in the way that he treated  her, and in his genuine though short-lived remorse for it. Yet more  chilling is Ripley offering to cover up for him, wanting only to preserve  the life of Dickie Greenleaf without scandal - he is not bothered about  Dickie's reprehensible behaviour or its consequences - this is merely an  opportunity to gain favour with (and power over) Dickie.
And the film  deals pretty well with the souring of the characters' relationships with  one another, the homoerotic tension, and the harrowing depiction of  Dickie's brutal death. Indeed, it also shows well the spiralling  consequences of Ripley's actions - except it lets them spiral on for way,  way too long. Many of the plot machinations and new characters introduced  in the second half were unnecessary and only slackened the tension and the  interest - a sharper, more ambiguous ending shortly after Dickie's death  would have made this film excellent, not just very good.
 As for the  acting: at first I was sceptical of Matt Damon, but once again he proves  himself a talented actor. He gives an understated, edgy performance as the  unstable Ripley; especially in the intense boat scene; and he shows both  the chameleon-like and the homosexul aspects of Ripley very well. Jude Law  lights up the screen at any given point in the film - his physically  beautiful (can anyone find a flaw with this guy's looks! ) and ruthlessly  charming Dickie offsets Ripley perfectly. Gwyneth Paltrow is good, less  self-conscious than she sometimes seems to be, Cate Blanchett and Jack  Davenport are solid in their supporting roles even in the more implausible  last part of the film. Philip Seymour Hoffman stands out, suitable sneery  but shrewd as Freddie. The film itself is pretty well-made, but could have  done with intensive editing in the second half - however, the  cinematography cannot be faulted, with the beautiful Iralian setting  soaking up the screen time as well as the beautiful people in the cast.
  Overall, this could be a great, glossy yet disturbing thriller, but is a  little over-indulgent.",958694400,,2715,5.086363636363636
137607,5,0792165039,"Anthony Minguella's follow up to ""The English Patient"" is a haunting, devious work that is reminiscent to most of Alfred Hitchcock's best movies. Although ""Mr. Ripley"" is a ""mainstream""  Hollywood work, it definitley does not play like it. In fact, this is the  reason I believe ""Mr. Ripley"" has been popular with critics and  film lovers but not so well recieved with your average movie fan.
Matt  Damon plays Tom Ripley. A poor man living in New York who is sent by a  millionaire ship-builder to recover his flamboyant son in beautiful Italy.  Ripley is, from the very beginning, a fake. A man who lies about virtually  everything and puts his master impersonation/forgery skills to good  use.
When he arrives in Italy he quickly finds the outlandish son played  superbly by Jude Law. He becomes friends with him and his girlfriend  (Gwyneth Paltrow) and before long is living out a fantasy life in  Italy.
It becomes apparent about half way through this movie that Tom  Ripley is a genuinly twisted man who is willing to do anything to keep his  auspicious position. This includes numerous murders, deception and total  cleverness.
The Talented Mr. Ripley is quite shocking in the sense that  the villain eventually prevails. There are some great suspense scenes along  the way and the acting is all first class. Damon turns in a spine tingling  performance that easily outshines his other great acting job in ""Good  Will Hunting."" In that film he played a kind of hooligan genius, in  ""Mr. Ripley"" he is an utterly sinister genius that is far more  affecting. Jude Law got an Oscar nomination for his performance. He's not  that good (he was better in Gattaca) but he still does a decent job as the  debonaire, spoiled brat. Paltrow is fine and Philip Seymour Hoffman turns  in another great (yet unnoticed) performance as a lethargic, pretensious  rich kid.
Minguella does a wonderful job of keeping the story moving.  ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" sometimes risks collapsing under its  own weight but Minguella knows what he is doing when holding the two and a  half hour film together.
""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is a  sinister masterpiece. It reaches back into the past with a very film-noir  approach which is both welcome and appreciated in the current sad-state of  Hollywood filmaking. Appreciate the film for what it is and don't be too  alarmed by the fact that the villain is the character that you are forced  to sympathize with. ""Mr. Ripley"" is different and should be  embraced for this, not condemned by people who want the usual Hollywood  formula movie. If you want to watch run of the mill Hollywood fluff, watch  the ""Cider House Rules."" If you want evil genius watch  ""Ripley.""",958608000,30,2697,4.837719298245614
137608,5,0792165039,"From the beginning of this tale, we are made aware of how seemingly innocuous acts can lead to horrific outcomes. In Mr. Ripley's case, one small decision led to another, and then another, and now he's done some  very bad things...and there is no end in sight.  Viewing this movie, I was  reminded of Moll Flanders who consistenly turns to the reader and says,  ""And Dear Reader, what would you do? ""
Maybe you wouldn't have  used another's jacket or told that first lie. Or maybe you would have. Or,  maybe you wouldn't have accepted the job from Dickie's father or, maybe you  would have. Or, maybe you wouldn't have told Dickie how you felt and seen  him grow cold, or, maybe you would have.
This alluring movie leads one to  care what happens to Mr. Ripley. His boyish charm and Dickie's perverse  ways make the viewer want Ripley to ""win"" their struggle. Soon,  you are caught up in his problems.  You want him to escape his tormentor,  the police, his past.
The movie is visually stunning. The only reason I  can suppose Hollywood gave it little notice at the Oscars this year (it  should have done as well as 'The English Patient') is because the film hits  too close to home. Sadly, most people do what is expedient and addresses  their immediate interests.  Ripley is the Everyman for our Age.",958348800,6,1302,4.562770562770563
137609,4,0792165039,"Truth may fall by the wayside in Anthony Minghella's adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel, but beauty-- particularly the odd aspects of America's class system that are based on beauty-- is everywhere. The film  itself is beautiful, taking in the nearly-naked Italians and Americans  littering the beaches, the smoky and sexy jazz clubs, and the spectacles of  Rome and Venice as a backdrop for the evil goings on (another reviewer has  aptly called the style ""travel-mag porn"").
Into this care-free  world of rich American expatriates in Italy comes the conniving Tom Ripley  (Matt Damon), looking nerdy and pale. Posing as a friend of rich boy Dickie  Greenleaf (Jude Law), he manages to insinuate himself into the lives of  Dickie and his fianc&eacute;e Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow, ever the Miramax Girl). The  fun and games quickly turn deadly, and soon Tom, an utterly amoral cad,  must stay one step ahead of the police, Marge, and Dickie's father,  shifting between identities and trying to keep a fragile structure of lies  from collapsing.
The movie's pacing actually improves on that of the  book. Patricia Highsmith's writing style can be sometimes awkward, and  Minghella has mostly done away with the worst of her excesses. However, the  movie is still not quite tight enough; 20 or 30 minutes could be safely  chopped from the film.
More problematic to Minghella's screenplay is his  making Tom overtly gay, shouting out what Highsmith knew she only needed to  hint at. Simply put, Tom is so incapable of love and so chameleonic that  making him gay and in love with Dickie is entirely wrong for his character.  Tom certainly loves Dickie's life, and would take advantage of any sexual  situation he could manipulate for his own ends, but Tom is so lacking in  moral structure that he should be beyond any kind of sexual definition. So,  minus one star for Minghella's bad misreading of Tom as a character.
But  this movie still earns its other four stars for its hard look at how the  U.S. classes its people not only into have and have-nots, but into the  charismatic and the drab. Dickie and Marge treat their wealth and  prettiness as birthrights, alternately accepting Tom's adoration and  treating him with casual, almost unknowing contempt.
And if the scenery  and themes weren't enough, the souped-up jazz soundtrack is marvelous, and  Jude Law and Matt Damon can actually sing. Just a terrific work by cast,  director, and cinematographers all around; if only Minghella as  screenwriter had reined himself in a bit, this would easily get five stars.",958348800,29,2571,5.004728132387707
