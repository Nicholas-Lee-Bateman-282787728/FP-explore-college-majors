8055292,1,B00081U7DG,"and they want their poorly produced borderline pedophilia style ""language program"" dubbed beta-max back.

as far as I can tell both the the Spanish and Portuguese part of the DVD feature the same strange journey on film, but only each side has different language dubbing. This film starts out with a pronunciation of the alphabet.... background image is two barely clothed preteens playing in beach surf..... from there the journey into strangeness and disgust grows deeper. As you watch you will be amazed at how cheap and faded the film quality is, how the colors fade in and out and the images randomly freeze on screen, how dated everything looks.... no you will not learn how to say cellphone, computer or internet because this thing was produced in 1983 and those things were not yet part of the social lexicon. The final straw of the absurd journey came when it just became a reel of young.... just about naked boys doing things they should have been doing in normal clothing. Learning to count numbers.... sure why not have it displayed by a boy counting on his fingers...... in his underwear....... WTF.

The people who released this onto DVD should be embarrassed and ashamed of themselves. This ""program"" was not worth the DVD it was burned on and should have stayed 30 years in the past where it belonged.",1397347200,,1317,4.771929824561403

This is a retread of what must have been one of the earlier filmed (VHS) language courses (as opposed to pure audio). Judging from the hairstyles (""big"") and clothing, and the objects used to illustrate vocabulary (cars, cassette tape player, old phone booths, etc) this must have been filmed in the early 1980s. On today's equipment, the colors are off and nothing seems to be in focus other than the text. The previous reviewer either is a shill for the company or had had no prior experience with language tapes. You will NOT be able to learn a language from these tapes, I guarantee.
My girlfriend will be travelling with me to Central America, so she checked this out from the public library, and we watched perhaps 2/3 or 3/4 of the Spanish part before we couldn't take any more. According to the DVD cover, you will learn to ""speak, read and write 1,000 words and phrases common in everyday situations...""  Hmm, 1000 words/phrases in 103 minutes: that is one new word every six seconds...
The previous reviewer claims these dated tapes are ""proven effective"" in the classroom. Given the total lack of any form of pedagogical organization, If anyone manages to learn from them, it is despite of their structure rather than because of it. Most verbs are only presented as infinitives, and for as long as we watched, there was no explanation of verb conjugation whatsoever. There is no repetition and no active involvement of the student (both are critical to learning a language), just a steady rush of new words and phrases, usually but not always grouped into categories (""fruits"", ""body parts"", ""smoking"", ""more body parts"", etc.), some clearly useful (if you actually learned them), some less obviously so (tugboat exiting the harbor; tumbling downhill). Actually, the choice of vocabulary seemed at times to have been dictated by what they could film rather than by what a tourist actually needs to learn. Words are illustrated by, usually, a young man pointing or miming or holding the object--except where they did not have a photo, and there is suddenly a black screen with subtext. And the constant focus on bare-torsoed, smiling boys quickly becomes a bit creepy (90% or so of the words are demonstrated by half-naked young men). This becomes decidely creepy when pubic hairs are visible, and when the word ""injection"" (a must for travellers, don't you agree?) is illustrated by the camera dwelling upon a hypodermic needle held up to a young man's naked buttocks.
There are lots of good language courses available on CD or DVD now, and even free over internet. Get one of those.",1340150400,2,2678,4.885714285714286
8055294,4,B00081U7DG,"There's a reason the language lessons for this series -- which includes German & Russian, Spanish & Portuguese, French & Italian, Japanese & Chinese, and Arabic, Hebrew & Yiddish -- look a little dated: They ARE. But that doesn't take away from their proven effectiveness in the classroom for an age range from older children to adults. The titles are a bit pricey, but they really will work to provide those new to a language with enough basics to get along as a tourist or a polite businessman or businesswoman. Those with a portable DVD player or laptop can brush up on their lessons before and during their trips.",1160352000,5,617,4.669724770642202
