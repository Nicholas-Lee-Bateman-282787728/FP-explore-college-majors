8025027,1,B0002A6CXW,"Not the movie for me. If you like sexist, degrading-to-women humor, you might like the film. But, the acting is dubbed into English, not badly, but it is truly hard to watch this film. I managed about 25 minutes. The 'battle of the sexes' is basically men standing around talking about how to cheat on their wives and then women talking about sexual escapades in separate scene. Filmed in the 1980's. I threw the video in the trash because I couldn't think of any other way to dispose of it that children might not get ahold of.

The film came in excellent condition and did seem to be new/in packaging. So, nothing against the distributor. Just the quality of the film.",1444521600,,670,4.537190082644628
8025028,4,B0002A6CXW,"Sort of a French-Canadian 'Big Chill', but smarter, if less emotional.

There really isn't a plot. For the first half of the film four upscale,
yuppie male friends (one gay) prepare a meal and talk about sex, while
their female counterparts do the same at a gym. The 2nd half is the two
groups sharing dinner, where the talk is more muted, but the personal
stakes much higher.

Probably over-hyped as a masterpiece when it first came out, now
it's often treated too harshly.

The acting is strong throughout, and the satiric point that all the
characters believe themselves self-knowing, but are really all living
in denial and delusion is perhaps a little obvious, but interesting in it's
effect and execution.",1300665600,,711,4.859504132231405
