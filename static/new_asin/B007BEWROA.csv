Sifu Gullette breaks down EACH MOVE in amazing detail and goes through moves 1 -38, covering all the body mechanics and silk reeling/spiraling.

The complete form is also shown in front and back views.

You will learn the Chen 38 Form from this DVD as long as you put the time in.

Best of luck!",1373068800,,399,4.28
