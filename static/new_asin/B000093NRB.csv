8324768,5,B000093NRB,"vankmajer's imagery, if taken literally, lies outside everyone's comfort zone. Slabs of dead meat dance, lovers fuse in passion or anger, the inanimate comes to life, and living people become stop-animation puppets. A political history creates a bizarre mix of autopsy, C-section, and ironic reference to wisdom springing from the brow of Jupiter. Childhood terrors take on form in ""Down to the Cellar;"" almost-familiar people and things combine in nightmare scenes where escape is impossible. ""Food"" offers macabre comments on consumption out of control.

This presents some of the finest in surreal imagery, carried by vankmajer's brilliant stop animation. Thought-provoking and beautifully executed, this extends the definition of what animation can be.
