In todays America that is a true rarity and its difficult to understand how we arrived here but for a segment of the population that relishes vengeance over success. Nonetheless, leadership consists of confidence in doing the proper thing, it consists of courage when an easy out presents itself, and it consists of selfless perseverance for a perceived greater good. Thats what this movie is about and its what American leadership presently lacks.",1526688000,,483,5.285714285714286

8155705,5,B000KDSJ64,"A very fine war movie of the type the British used to turn out in some quantity.  Limited special effects but outstanding actors, script and directing.  Besides, who needs elaborate special effects when you have an actual Lend-Lease four piper destroyer for your set?  The actual ship used in the movie to portray the fictional H.M.S. Ballentrae is the former U.S.S. Twiggs (commissioned in 1919) which was turned over to Britain in 1940 in the destroyers for bases swap which gave the British 50 old but badly needed destroyers known as four-pipers or flush-deckers.  The British renamed the ship the H.M.S. Leamington.  She was lent to the Soviet Union in 1944 and renamed the Zhguchi.  The ship was returned to the British in 1950 and used for this movie before scrapping in 1951.

Some of the events in this movie are loosely based on another lend-lease destroyer, the H.M.S. Campbelltown which took part in Operation Chariot, the actual raid on the German held port of St. Nazaire.  The Cambelltown was loaded with explosives, rammed into the dry dock gates and blown up.  The dry dock was not repaired until after the war.",1519516800,,1128,4.833333333333333

The story begins with a British crew assembling in USA in 1940 to take charge of an old American destroyer, USS ""Whittier"", which will become then HMS ""Ballantrae"". This transfer is the consequence of ""Destroyers for Bases Agreement"", a real-life event (signed on 2 September 1940). At 23 years of age USS ""Whittier"" is already an old and used ship, but as they say ""you don't look a gift horse in the mouth"" and in fact the British crew will nick name their new ship ""Gift Horse""...

What follows is the story of a hastily assembled group of very different people slowly overcoming all kind of difficulties under the leadership of a harsh and for a long time very disliked skipper, Lieutenant Commander Hugh A. Fraser (Trevor Howard) - before becoming finally a well integrated crew in charge of an efficient war machine. Then finally HMS ""Ballantrae"" will be ordered to participate in an extremely dangerous mission - the raid on Saint-Nazaire on 28 March 1942. And whatever the issue of the raid, she is not meant to return...

The story described in the first part of the film is inspired by real experiences of British crews which were hastily assembled in 1940 to man the 50 old American destroyers. One of them, HMS ""Campbeltown"" (ex-USS ""Buchanan"") was indeed used during the raid on Saint-Nazaire and those events are described in the second part of the film.

This black and white movie was not a superproduction, there is virtually no special effects and fighting scenes are not very spectacular - but it doesn't really hurt the film. The great strength of ""Gift Horse"" is the excellent scenario, very strong dialogs and very good acting of every person present on the screen. There is lots of humor in this film, particularly about the troubles which affect the ""Gift Horse"" during her shakedown and first war missions - at one moment HMS ""Ballantrae"" earns the dubious honor of being welcomed by the message ""Welcome to the Swiss Navy""...

Four actors are particularly important. Trevor Howard is simply amazing as the skipper of ""Gift Horse"". James Donald plays very well Lieutenant Jennings, the executive officer of HMS ""Ballantrae"", an ambitious dandy and a redoutable Don Juan, who will meet his ""fate"" before this film ends...))) Richard Attenborough is even better as ""Dripper"" Daniels, a simple sailor who before war was an union organiser and who therefore will be the principal trouble maker on board (Donald and Attenborough later also played together in the ""Great Escape""). Finally Bernard Lee, who much later was to become very famous as ""M"" in James Bond movies, plays a very likeable sailor, Able Seaman ""Stripey"" Wood

Bottom line, this is an excellent, very well made and well interpreted ""oldie but goldie"" war film. I loved it and I am definitely keeping my DVD for another viewing on day. Enjoy!",1357171200,5,2948,4.816205533596838

It's a pity modern movies aren't made like this.
Good acting and down to earth people make it believeable.
Enjoyed it.",1335830400,3,168,4.827586206896552
