4231360,5,B003YPI302,I love these videos!  They are a good workout with great Christian music too!  Would highly recommend them.  If you are just beginning to exercise take it easy at first as these are really great workouts but can make you a bit sore...lol,1368748800,8,237,4.465116279069767
4231361,5,B003YPI302,This is the second set of videos I have purchased..the first is now being used in an exercise class at my church.  I would use this seller again.  Shipping was fast and I received what I expected in great condition (new).,1353628800,,221,4.365853658536586
4231362,4,B003YPI302,"I've come to learn that it's hit or miss when you buy exercise dvd's from Amazon. My dvd's don't always work, bummer. This was a good, basic workout routine, which is great if you're not interested in fancy dance moves. I did get bored with it fairly quick though, and I tried a Leslie Sansone walking at home dvd, and I loved that! But these are good too!",1348272000,2,356,4.25
4231363,5,B003YPI302,You will get a great cardiovascular and muscular workout with these videos.  Christian music plays unobtrusively in the background.  You can move at a relative fast pace with the leader or with another gal who does low impact moves. She starts with some stretches then moves right into the workout--also finishes with some stretches--just enough at each end of the video.  The gals are appropriately dressed so if you have children--no worries!,1342310400,16,444,5.138888888888889
8409749,3,B003YPI302,"Thought the video quality was poor.  Kind of blurry.  It was a bit fast paced, more for older teens, and could use more explanation on how to do some of the steps.  Also, handled resistance bands were used for several of the exercises, but nowhere on the DVD case does it say that you should have one of these in order to do parts of the workout.  Fairly disappointing overall, especially considering the other good reviews.",1520035200,,424,4.5394736842105265

8409751,5,B003YPI302,Great Workout for students.,1461974400,,27,6.0
8409752,5,B003YPI302,"My teens and I work out and sweat, a lot, to these workouts. I don't have to worry about immodest exercise outfits or music with questionable lyrics.",1459123200,,149,4.555555555555555
8409753,5,B003YPI302,"I love this simple, easy to follow workout.",1458345600,,43,4.5
8409754,5,B003YPI302,"I bought this for myself and so far I've only done one out of the three workouts on this video, but I am very pleased with it!  My 7 year old and 6 year old regularly join me for parts of it, sometimes exercising and sometimes just watching.  I'm very happy that this is possible because the people on the video are dressed modestly, otherwise I probably would not want my children to watch it.",1455148800,,394,4.24
8409755,5,B003YPI302,I know this is meant for kids but I love it,1445385600,,43,3.0
8409756,5,B003YPI302,"I wasn't sure if this would be good or not, but for this price, I decided to give it a try. I must say, this is the best workout DVD I have ever seen. Ever!! And I've used a lot of exercise DVDs. The instructor is upbeat without being fake, the people are all modestly dressed, and the workout is challenging without being too difficult. I also like that there are three different episodes so we can vary our workout. I wasn't sure what to expect with it being market as Christian workouts, but it's not cheesy, or cheap as many christian based DVDs are. I love how the instructor gives a clear biblical message towards the end of the program, but it is not done in a silly way. It's wonderful. I really can't put in to words how much we love this DVD. My teens love using it three times a week. I see them healthier, happier and comfortable in their own skin. It's hard having teen girls and not having them question their bodies when they watch other workout DVDs. Most are scantily clad, and overly fake. This DVD is down to earth, honest, and comfortable. It's the best workout DVD I think I've ever seen. I hope they have more in this series.",1423699200,14,1147,4.290322580645161
8409757,5,B003YPI302,This is an excellent set of dvd workouts!!!!  Wonderful as well because she adds scripture into each one.  I would highly recommend these dvds!!!!  Thank you so much!!!,1403913600,6,168,4.928571428571429
8409758,3,B003YPI302,"I didn't sweat enough during this short DVD to give it 5 stars but it was effective.  Sometimes it tells you what is coming up so that you can get ready but not always.  Michelle cues well and has a pleasant personality.  The music and verses are awesome.  I am not a fan of using the tube on both feet because it felt kind of awkward but I liked all the other routines.  To step it up a notch in intensity, I add 1-3 lb dumbbells during the non-weight routines (songs 3,4,6, and 8) when she uses no weights.  I use 8 lb dumbbells during the toning parts.  I recommend this exercise DVD especially for days when you have less than 40 minutes to work-out.",1383696000,3,654,4.184
