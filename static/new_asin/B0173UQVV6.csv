7489297,4,B0173UQVV6,The blu ray version is great but a personal con is that the subtitles are yellow. I'm used to the white subtitles given on crunchyroll and the subtitles on the disc goes a bit too fast. If only they can just use the subtitles from crunchyroll that would be great. There was also the part where they called her Meow-mori instead of Miyamori which really annoyed me. I don't know where they got this translation but they should really change that cause Meow-mori just doesn't click.,1458950400,,480,4.593023255813954
7489298,4,B0173UQVV6,"I am a big fan of the series (I've watched it four or five times now on Crunchyroll) so of course I pre-ordered it, and just now finished my sixth runthrough. It's interesting to see the Sentai translations compared to Crunchyroll's.  At the start of Episode 1, for example, Taoru describes the first episode of ""Exodus"", the anime-within-an-anime as being a purification for the director, while the Sentai translation says it's a clean slate. The reference being to the director's previous disaster with an anime titled ""Jiggly Heaven"". In addition, Sentai provides translator's notes, explaining some of the in-jokes (and there are many).

The story is, of course, great. Five stars. It's about adults, solving adult problems. It's a primer on how anime is made. It's directed by my favorite director, Tsutomu Mizushima (of Girls und Panzer fame). So what's not to like, why only four stars? Well, the story is great, but the delivery leaves something to be desired.

First of all, it's subtitled only. I don't mind, but my wife (and other acquaintances who are not so much into anime) much prefers dubbed. Second, surprisingly, the video quality is not as good as the Chrunchyroll SD transmission. I paused both on my home television, and switched back and forth. The Blu-ray is noticeably fuzzier than the streamed version. It's not so bad as to be unwatchable -- in fact, it only detracts if you've seen the streamed version -- but it really is inexcusable, particularly for a product that costs  $60 for a one-disk program. Unfortunately, we are at the mercy of the marketing companies, and the only alternative is to not own a copy.

Season 2 is scheduled for release in May, 2016, and I'm going to pre-order that as well.",1455926400,8,1729,4.86734693877551
7489299,5,B0173UQVV6,"One of the best series I've seen recently. A great look into the anime industry and how it works, with a great mixture of humor and parody.",1455753600,2,139,4.185185185185185
7489300,5,B0173UQVV6,"Perhaps the best anime of the 2014-2015 season, Shirobako follows five young women as they attempt to break into the anime industry.  Most of the focus is on Miyamori Aoi, a rookie production assistant at ""Musashino Animation,"" a small studio facing an uncertain future.  Shirobako is a workplace comedy with a bunch of appealing characters all of whom love their work despite the hectic schedules they face.  For those who like to preview a show before purchase, it is also streamed at Crunchyroll.

Shirobako just won a number of awards at the AnimeSuki fan site including best television series of 2015.",1455235200,6,606,4.97029702970297
8738056,1,B0173UQVV6,Boring drivel. Got through 3 episodes and couldn't take it anymore.,1493337600,,67,5.181818181818182
8738057,5,B0173UQVV6,"Clarification: The Product Details says (twice!) that this disc is dubbed, but a close examination of the back of the box (or the reviews) shows it is not dubbed, only subbed.  Just know this before you order.",1492646400,,209,4.648648648648648
8738058,3,B0173UQVV6,"I really love the series, but that just made me more disappointed when this release didn't include the OVA or almost any of the special features or behind the scenes content.",1481241600,,174,4.645161290322581
8738059,3,B0173UQVV6,"Shirobako is an incredible anime-representation of real daily life in Japan, and the entire Far East in fact: overwhelming work hours where employees turn their work places into their real homes, where everything is about work and yet overall they make a terrible work. These people never worry about productivity or communication for a moment and as result end up wasting massive amount of time and resources. For instance, the starting episode shows Aoi delivering folders (a regular job of hers) that can be sent to emails from quick faxing machines.

The main character, Aoi Miyamori, is presented as an ever happily entry-level employee happy be eternally begging & thanking coworkers and higher levels to do their jobs. Some of the management real jobs rather seem to be anything else: Marukawa a cook with a hideous happy-free smile while some employees go though severe stress. Next is Okitsu, besides asking people to clean after themselves she offers help in one desperate moment and makes clear its only one time after one employee tries to stop her from helping for once under the strange claim that itd be overtime, after all those all-nighters from everybody else! (Its not paid anyways over there, normally) Some others superiors (like Kinoshita) only make matters even worse by endless nick picking, while piling fat after their eternal workloads and junk diet. And we thought only America was like this!

However, all of the above situations are great from Shirobakos creators perspective which only shows a cruel expectation of people and total blindness to reality, which may be typical beliefs in the Far East. And here the anime fans have not noticed or complained about this at all, which  doesn't mean you are capable of working and thinking like Aoi. Its easy for you to praise the anime from your cozy homes or schools, but youll have to become like Aoi one day and then you'll understand. This is the main reason why I gave three stars to this show instead of a single as my critics would make you expect: because Shirobako is a top lesson of what is expected in all jobs: total submission to their rules and bosses while making a wide smile all along.

PS:Japan and Americans (and Mexicans, Russians, etc, etc) say these are facts of life, so much for our cultural and racial differences. We are peoples who will never become truly advanced societies like Germany and its neighbors whose people have really wanted a better life and worked until reaching it, such as a 35 hours week, while keeping job safety, good incomes and still delivering good products, the best in the world in fact. European products are synonymous of luxury and best quality.",1479168000,,2676,4.874725274725274
8738060,5,B0173UQVV6,Love this series so much. It's a definite must watch if you enjoy the behind-the-scenes stuff to making anime.,1475366400,,110,4.842105263157895
8738061,5,B0173UQVV6,I love the Anime but it isn't dub :-(,1467244800,,37,3.2222222222222223
8738062,5,B0173UQVV6,"I love the anime, the story & characters, I've been waiting for it to be released and was quite excited when it was. My only complaint is that I have to wait for the second half.",1462579200,,178,3.9722222222222223
8738063,5,B0173UQVV6,"The animation is itself nice, as commented by other viewers. Some people complained about video quality, I noted no issue about that. Even it seems crushing 12 episodes on one disc, for a BD DL disc, it is still fine. The video is about 3.3GB per episode for 25 minutes, which translates to ~19Mbps, not very high, but above the streaming video quality for most website. (~1080P@8Mbps for most cases. Granted, streaming website can use more advanced/updated codec like X264, so there is less advantage. ) Also, considering animation is at 24fps, with large blocks of similar color, compression will not cause much artifact. If someone feels the video quality is worse, this may be player specific issues instead of video quality. (e.g. rendering settings )
The issue is that the caption, especially those overlaying Japanese ones are distracting. Granted, they have to add captions and subtitles due to copyright issues, but there are clearly better ways to do this, such as putting the caption above or below the original ones. Overlaying the caption using the same color made it very hard to read what is on the screen, especially if you know both languages used.",1461542400,2,1165,4.948979591836735
8738064,5,B0173UQVV6,"A must see series it's an Anime about the anime industry, wonderful animation and some great characters. You owe it too yourself to watch this series!",1461456000,,150,4.8076923076923075
8738065,4,B0173UQVV6,"A very nice slice of life set in the anime industry that follows five women who are just starting out on their careers. Unlike an earlier reviewer who thought it looked worse than on crunchyroll, there are no picture issues. What is an issue is not including the Exodus to Tomorrow episode as it was included on the Japanese Blu-Ray. Hopefully both this and the Airbats/Area 88 inspired 3rd Aerial Girls Squad episode will appear on the second Blu-Ray collection.",1458950400,,463,4.8
