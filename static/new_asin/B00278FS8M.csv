3862205,5,B00278FS8M,"I really like this new video by Leslie.  I have probably 30 of her different workouts.  This is one of my favorites.  It's an excellent workout, non-stop moving the whole time.",1250985600,,176,4.612903225806452
3862206,4,B00278FS8M,"I love Leslie Sansone, and I can't get enough of her 3 mile workouts because they're just about the right amount of time for me for a workout and I like to have a variety to choose from.

This latest release is a 43 minute walk that uses no props - no stretch bands or belt or weights - and features Leslie alone - with  no ""sisters""/friends/instructors.  This workout appears to have been filmed about the same time as the workout ""kit"" series that were released this spring and sold exclusively at Target.  Many will be happy to know that this workout is chaptered and you can opt to do the full workout or select an individual mile.  I kind of miss the flow of the unchaptered workouts, as these have a bit of a pause between where one ends and the next starts, but that's a small thing.

I liked the pace of the workout and I got mildly sweaty, which is always a good sign.  What is new is the workout clock, which counts down how many minutes/seconds you have left in that mile.  I liked it, although it made me a little too aware of the time.

All the standard steps are in the workout - marching, side steps, knee lifts, kicks and hamstring curls - nothing new, but that's fine, as part of the appeal of Leslie's workouts is that you don't have tricky footwork and, as she tells us, you can't do her workouts wrong!  One thing she frequently mentions that I fully recommend you heed is to stand up straight and be careful you don't tip back, particularly when kicking and doing knee lifts.  I think it's a natural tendency to lean back and if you do, you can make your back cranky.  Following her instructions may mean you're not kicking as high, but if you're standing up straight and pulling your belly button in, as she coaches, I think you get a better ab workout.

Some of Leslie's cue-ing was a bit delayed, particularly in the beginning, but if you've done any of her workouts in the past, you almost know what she's going to say or do - and even if this is your first, it's truly not a big deal.  I can't say this workout is necessarily any more of a belly reducing workout than any of her others, so the name is a bit of a misnomer, although we won't deduct points :) since she included the 10 minute optional ab workout, which was several sets of the exercise called ""bicycle"" done fairly slowly.

Overall, it was an enjoyable workout that moved quickly and worked up a bit of a sweat and will be nice to have in the rotation.",1249689600,23,2443,4.280434782608696
3862207,4,B00278FS8M,"This is a great video!

Pros:
-3 miles with the option to just do 1,2,3
-Belly work out at the end- however this is NOT integrated into the workout it's options which is a Pro in my opnion
-High energy, goes by SUPER quick
-Lots of great health tips about calorie burning, viseral fat, crunches etcs

Cons:
-While Leslie is chatting she often changes the moves without warning, usually she counts you down to the next move

Misc/You Choose:
-Walk clock in the corner counts you down for each mile, I DO NOT like this but some people like it better
-Leslie is the only one in the video, which typically I wouldn't mind but since she randomly changes moves it's a little difficult to follow

All in all great video, I'd give it 4.5 if I could- just can't bring myself to a perfect 5- Great investment though not upset I bought it at all! Happy Walking!",1249689600,3,850,4.360759493670886
3862208,5,B00278FS8M,"I have three other of Leslie's exercise DVDs and have found them all beneficial. With the help of the Momentum Plan through Weight Watchers I have lost 30 pounds and three dress sizes in the last six months and Leslie's exercise DVDs have been an important part of my progress. In my opinion, this is the best of Leslie's DVDs that I have tried. I like the continuous clock that lets you know how much time you have left to walk a mile - sometimes that's the encouragement you need to keep going. Also, I really enjoy the fact that this is a real one-on-one with Leslie - no other gals with her (even though I love you gals) I found them to be a distraction and this focusing by Leslie on the camera and talking to ""me"" really works. She seemed to provide more motivational and instructional information than in past exercise DVDs. The three miles flew by!! Hurray, Leslie. Keep up the good work.",1249603200,112,896,4.403614457831325
3862209,5,B00278FS8M,"Walk Your Belly Flat is another great walk aerobic workout from Leslie that, as with every other Leslie workout, does not disappoint me.  The walk is brisk and energizing, keeping the heart-rate elevated all the way through.

This IS a 3 MILE WALK. The floor work at the end is NOT part of the 3 mile walk, so this walk is NOT comparable to the Walk Your Way Thin: Belly, Buns, Thighs Slim Down (Target Exclusive) which does incorporate the fit cuff work within the 3 miles. No worries - you will get 3 miles of very high-energy, fast-paced power walking. If you still question whether you are getting 3 miles of walking, Leslie seems to have anticipated your question and there is a message that comes on the screen - takes up the whole screen like a brief commercial break - which says ""You just did 3 miles!""

I'll now concentrate on what is DIFFERENT about this 3 miler than other 3 miles & what gives it the title Walk Your BELLY Flat:

The Walk Clock: I love this new feature. I'm one of those people who hits the display on my DVD so I can see how much time is remaining. To me it makes the walk go by faster not slower. The time goes by the amount of time remaining in each individual mile, not the whole workout. If you are not one of those people who likes to see the time remaining, then I think you'll really be annoyed by the feature as you can't get rid of that clock and it's there throughout the entire walk.

How does this walk focus on your BELLY: This is really classic Leslie walking. Those who are looking for new combinations won't find it here. Besides the floor work at the end, the only other thing that FOCUSES on working your belly is the knee lifts. There does seem to be more knee lifts in this one then in other workouts. She does mostly the knee lifts with your legs apart...and lots of double and quadruple knee lifts. She also emphasizes that CALORIE BURN reduces belly fat. She says that it does more for you than crunches. So it's also really her commentary/terminology that focuses on the belly (think A Walk and a Talk series - Walk Down Your Blood Sugar & Heart Healthy Walk - She is focusing on an area that is so important for us to take care of and that it's more important to reduce your belly fat than to be a certain weight, etc.).

I can't think of anything else that makes this walk distinct from other walks. Of course they are all different to me but I'm trying to be critical for those who would like to know how this walk is very different from the others they own...

It does go by really fast! Although 5 Fat Burning Miles still wins as far as the workout that goes by the fastest (in my opinion). The walk is about 42 minutes long and that includes the warm-up & cool down. There is NO stretching...Leslie then goes right into the floor work. If you aren't doing the floor work then you will want to do your own stretching.....not a big deal for me as I sometimes do my own stretching anyway if I feel like doing more/less.

For those who love BOOSTED WALKING: There is a little bit of that in this walk. I'll say it gives you a taste of boosted walking. While she does just a little bit earlier in the walk, the longest boost is in the middle of the 3rd mile: 1 minute.

MILE MARKERS & MESSAGES: There are messages on the screen throughout this walk like many of the new walks. Messages that correlate to things Leslie is saying. There is also a message to tell you when you have walked half a mile, 1 mile, 1.5 miles, 2 miles, 2.5 miles, and 3 miles.",1248566400,509,3505,4.2507507507507505

There are no other walkers with Leslie so it feels like a private session with her. Leslie gained a lot of weight in this dvd, which surprised me, but I relate to her  better knowing she has experienced weight gain too.  Her endurance is still very strong.  This dvd does not use toning balls or the stretch bands.

The dvd  consists of 3 separate one mile walks, but the warm up is only on the first walk and the cool down is only on the third walk.  It has a full walk option that smoothly rolls through all three walks.  She has added some new, minor moves such as toe pointing. It has a one minute jog and a clock feature I like a lot.

There are some snafus, such as loss of music at a couple point and Leslie has to ask her technician to play the music. It's not as slick a dvd as some of her other productions.  But I really like this dvd.",1428537600,6,1058,4.014354066985646

So, I though no big deal.  It is fun and if you really put yourself into it, it is a great excersize.  The one mile is not so great, but if you are really out of shape - it is right for you.  The 2 mile version is the best all around and works up a good sweat.  The 3 mile with heavier weights is a very tough workout.

3862370,4,B00278FS8M,"I've tried a number of Leslie Sansone walking workouts and this is one of the best. It focuses mainly on low impact walking yet still manages to give you an amazing ab workout. This is a three-mile walk which is best done all at once.

During the first mile I didn't notice as much ab work but during the second mile I could really feel my abs working. The third mile has boosted walking (running) so that made it a bit more challenging. I liked that there was a short cool down at the end of the third mile.

There is also a nice floor workout which basically consists of bicycle crunches done multiple times with short breaks in between. Finally there is some stretching but nothing extreme. This workout is 49 minutes and will give you an excellent ab workout.

Unlike older workouts, Leslie Sansone is alone in her studio. The set is not quite as cheery as other sets so it is more dark and formal. But without other people to chat to Leslie stays more focused and gives you a better workout.

But I can do up to 1 hr. of any of the Sansone DVDs with no problem to my back or leg at all & get the greatest work out ever.

3862373,5,B00278FS8M,"I was a bit hesitant to order this DVD since I already own the Belly Blasting Walk DVD; however, I'm glad I did because this workout was completely different.  The walk does focus more on the core because of the extra knee-lifts (which are almost like standing crunches).  The floor session was a bit short, but I don't mind at all.

I also love the walk clock--I wish more of Leslie's workouts had this. I like being able to see exactly how much time I have left in the workout. Anyway, this is a great 3-mile walk & I totally recommend it.",1390521600,2,541,4.284313725490196

3862375,3,B00278FS8M,I own a number of Leslie's DVD's and this one is only getting 3 out of 5 stars due to...#1 the cuing is not consistent  #2 the walk lacks variety (including the stretching segment).  Having the option of a 1-3 mile walk is nice.  She has other 3 mile WALKS to choose from.  I would recommend looking into one of those before purchasing this one.,1383696000,,345,4.2615384615384615

3862378,5,B00278FS8M,"I am a seasoned Jillian Michaels DVD user, so I was expecting to use this as just another thing to keep me moving on my days off at home. Let me tell you that I was very surprised at how much this workout really makes you WORK!  It is absolutely fantastic, and is a workout that you can really build to meet your needs. If you need something low-key and easy, this workout can do that for you. If you want something harder, she gives you options to make it so.  Leslie reinforces throughout the workout that you can always go back to just walking in place if a move gets to be too much for you.  When it started to get too easy for me, I started adding in hand weights and ankle weights to make it more difficult.

This really is a workout for every fitness level.  You'll get out of it what you put into it.  In response to people who are saying they were disappointed at the limited floor work, the bicycle crunch she does at the end is just a demonstration of what you should be doing on your own after the walk if you want to.  If you listen to her during the workout, she tells you that a calorie burn to get the fat off the abdominal area is the first step to flat abs, then concentrate on crunches to sculpt.  If you are looking for more abdominal work, try 8 Minute Abs, which you can find the video for on Youtube or Vimeo.

5 stars for a great workout!!",1381795200,4,1363,4.074906367041199

Since I was about 50 lbs overweight and had joint problems, my Dr. approved with the stipulation that I check in with him as I progressed. The Intermediate one had a 1 and 2 mile walk that I built myself up to and was doing it with no problems. When I started on the Walk Your Belly Flat that speeded up my weight loss even more. I have now lost 46 lbs, and along with a Weight Watcher diet I am feeling better and am more mobile than I have been in years.

The age rang for our class is mid-50's to early 70's, so each person participates as much as possible while taking into account any transitory medical issues. This DVD keeps you on your feet and moving constantly while you exert as much or as little energy as you wish. You can certainly rev up on days when you are feeling especially energetic! No equipment is needed--not even the stretch band--yet Leslie has you do plenty of upper body and boosted walking exercises, all within an hour. Nice warmup and cool down walking sections, too.  Our only reservation about this one is that Sansone leads the moves by herself instead of with others in a class setting.

I do this at lunch time in my office or at home. You don't need a lot of space, and even if you don't feel like doing 3 miles just doing 1 mile a day is better than nothing.

3862438,5,B00278FS8M,"I love this video! I used to walk my dog almost every day 2-3 miles but the weather has gotten bad and too cold, so when I ordered this it arrived just in time.

I like how motivating Leslie is, and yes she talks alot but I like the chit chat and all the walking and talking puts me in a better mood.  Turn the volume down and play your own music if you don't want to hear her talking, people! lol

The leg lifts and kicks are beneficial to your abs and the bicycle exercises at the end are awesome. I try to do a few extra than what she does for even more benefit. Same for the leg lifts and I usually have so much energy by the third mile that I do more jogging (aka gentle jogging) than what she does and I put more emphasis into the side stepping. But that's just me. It's an easy video that I can do every day practically with no excuses not to walk. It has only been a week but I feel so much better already and lost 1/2 a pound in just four days.  It just goes to show that you don't have to buy some expensive $100 Insanity video series or Jillian Michaels (ugh) to look and feel great.  I feel like my abs are getting tighter already after just a week!
I can't wait to try more of her videos!

Latest edit:  EIGHT MONTHS LATER....I STILL use this video and out of four of her DVD's that I have tried now this is STILL my favorite.  I have lost 20 pounds since last October, went from 135 (give or take a few pounds) down to around 115 and maintaining.  I know that exercise is helping me maintain along with a healthy diet and I still use this video when I can! It's great! If I want a more intense workout, I just do her last 15 minutes (third mile) and add some extra running and even dance/aerobics.  I try to change it up.  But like she says don't let this replace your outdoor walks around the neighborhood - I walk my dogs most days when it's not rainy or hot out, but even during the summer months it's nice knowing that I have this video to go downstairs into my nice cool basement when it's 90 degrees outside and just do my thing and get my workout in.  I need my walks so that I feel refreshed and it's actually better for me than any antidepressant or energy drink out there LOL",1355270400,3,2199,4.018348623853211

There is also a short floor routine of bicycles for your tummy as well. It also has a walking clock with each mile, which is nice, I wish all of the dvds had that feature.

All in all it is not Leslie's most challenging dvd but it makes me sweat :)",1350086400,,382,3.7160493827160495

3862443,5,B00278FS8M,"Okay; here goes! I am now 63 yrs. old, with joint pains and overweight, so you can imagine my reluctance to try something like this! In the past I have owned a (stationary) bicycle, Gazelle, rowboat, treadmill and I ended up getting rid of them. When I visited a friend a few weeks back, we did ""Leslie Sansone's Walk your Belly Flat"" and I was so disgusted with myself because I couldn't even do half a mile and I was wheezing (I also have asthma). I realize however, that I have to do something because I'm getting older and it's getting more painful and difficult to even walk and I find it boring to just walk. Also, I live in New England; I find it difficult to walk all year round in this seasonal atmosphere. Watching the DVD, it looked so easy that I thought even I can do it. So I purchased it online at Amazon- it's cheap and free shipping so I thought it's not too painful to spend money on. I find Leslie's approach easy to follow, encouraging and I don't feel ""rushed"". It almost feels like she's talking to me, and identifies with me (even if I don't look like her at all!). Before I know it, I've done a mile and it felt good, plus I used my new ""Bloch Dance Sneakers"" and it helped a lot! I'm still working on my 2nd mile and of course there are stomach crunches after the 3 mile workout (you can skip anytime), but I am not in a hurry- as long as I'm doing the ""walking"" every other day. I would encourage doing the ""warm up"" that Leslie shows in the beginning, and if you can't continue on (to the 2nd and/or the 3rd mile), do the ""cool down"" at the end of the 3rd mile- fast forward the DVD to the last 4 mins, 12 seconds at the end of the 3rd mile to do the ""cool down"". No matter how tired I am, I look forward to Leslie Sansone's ""Walk at Home: Walk Your Belly Flat"" (every other day)! It's not much, but I can see and feel the difference already after 2 weeks!",1349481600,2,1883,4.105691056910569

3862445,5,B00278FS8M,This is the kind of exercise DVD I have been looking for. The workout is just walking and you put as much into it as you want to. Burns calories and the time goes so fast. I usually get 2 miles done before getting ready for work. I would recommend this DVD to anyone that is looking for a walking at home exercise with toning included.

I found this program quite useful and effective. I've lost upwards of 5 lbs. with light to moderate use over the last 3 weeks. I am now officially a senoir citizen and found that this program is an excellent way to achieve and maintain decent physical condition without leaving your house.

The first two miles are fine for me (I'm 65), but the 3rd mile is a little more than I want and pretty fast, so I do my own cool-down after mile 2. I could do mile 3 but I might be sorry; maybe someday. She does various different steps like leg lifts and side steps which are not difficult and vary the workout.  Also the arm motions add to the calorie burn and workout.  People can modify the workout (go slower) and build on that if it's too much in the beginning.  Any moving we do is good, right? She's pleasant to listen to.  I actually like ""Walk Away the Pounds"" 2-Mile Brisk Walk better, but this makes a nice change.",1337817600,,727,4.027777777777778

3862458,4,B00278FS8M,"Written for the fans:

If you like her, you'll love this DVD. It's three miles, she's on her own and the music is upbeat and loud enough to hear. Not as much variety as some of her 5 mile DVD, but good nonetheless. The music is familiar, but since it's not bad, I don't mind it.

For non-fans/newcomers:

If you are a workout freak, Leslie in general, may not be for you. If you learn the moves, then you can do it yourself at your pace, with your own music and be happy. If you don't like a lot of chit-chat, don't buy Leslie...she loves to talk and some may find it annoying. Now if you are just starting to workout, Leslie is wonderful. If you want something very basic that you can pump up later, then you'll like this DVD. I personally like it, because I can make the workout as hard or as lite as I want.

3862463,4,B00278FS8M,"I bought this workout of Leslie's last month because I wanted to tone up and lose five-to-eight more pounds after losing 35lbs. Five of those pounds I have gained back over the last couple months! Anyway, we had another Leslie DVD that I used to work out to, but it's packed away in storage in a different state.  Since my tummy is my major problem area and amazon.com had such a good price on this DVD, I bought it. I've started with two of the three miles, five days a week, and am working up to two and a half, then three miles. These are not easy miles! Lol. Each mile is more intense, and you're doing that on top of the miles you've already done. But it's great. There are no crazy moves, and you don't have to use anything (i.e. weights, stretch bands, exercise balls, etc.), no expensive machines, just you and whatever you're willing to put into it.
I want to buy one or two more of Leslie's DVD's to keep thing changed up and have ordered them from the library to see which ones I like. Of course, I'm on a waiting list, but that's okay, I'll keep working towards that third mile on Walk Your Belly Flat!
Now, I have to get my eating back on track. After a year of eating right and losing the weight I wanted to lose, I was finally in the best shape of my, albeit, young life (early 20's), but since a cross country move, it has been hard to maintain a healthy, calorie-counting lifestyle. I enjoy Leslie's encouragement in her routines, and the fact that she is a Christian is important in helping to preserve the right mindset for me.
I agree with other reviewers... I wish the backdrop and Leslie's clothes had been brighter like in some older DVD's. I thought I would like having just her, but you find that you miss the interest and stimulation of working out with a ""group"", like the ones that join her sometimes. And the walk clock is definitely cool! I think that should be an option to include on all of her workouts!! : )",1334448000,6,1941,4.30327868852459
3862464,4,B00278FS8M,"Ok, so my biggest complaint with this dvd is not really about the workout itself, but the atmosphere.  I am new to Leslie workouts.  I borrowed one from my mom that is in a large, well-lit room with others working out with her, and this is just her in a room with a big black sheet across the entire back wall, which just didn't feel as inviting for me.  While some may be distracted by her small talk with others she works out with, I found it made it more fun and made it go by faster.  The workout itself was ok, but I like the other ones that you can use stretchy bands or other things to help. I found myself using my own 3 pound weights, to add a bit more to the workout, and I definitely was still sweating.  I also like dvd's with more than 3 miles, because, while I do not do them all in one day (yet), I like the variety to choose from when I am just going to do a couple miles, so I can do different combinations of miles on different days.",1332806400,,951,3.9581151832460733

The first mile is somewhere between 14 and 15 minutes....second one is over 13 but not 14...and the last one is just about at 14 minutes.  Somehow that clock really helps in getting me through the miles.  This is definitely one of her best videos ever. :),1330128000,,409,4.413333333333333
3862471,5,B00278FS8M,This is the 3rd Leslie Sansone I have purchased and I enjoy each one of them. Her tapes are highly motivational and easy to follow. I've been doing them for 5 months now and not tired of them yet. Thanks much.,1329696000,,209,4.121951219512195
3862472,5,B00278FS8M,"I love this exercise DVD. It is not difficult to follow and do. The moves and the pace are simple and effective. I could actually feel it working immediately. I would definitely recommend it to anyone especially someone who is not in good physical shape and would like a kick start to toning the entire body. Also, I could feel my respiratory system clearing up and this was amazing.",1329436800,,383,4.565217391304348
3862473,5,B00278FS8M,This is the second Leslie Sansone walking DVD that I have purchased. It provides a great workout. It has enabled me to lose weight and feel great. You don't need any equipment other than a good pair of walking or fitness shoes. One of the things I like about this particular DVD is the countdown clock. I like being able to see how much time is left in my daily workout. The addition of belly crunches at the end of the workout is a nice plus. I would highly recommend this workout for anyone who wants to start working out at home.,1329436800,,532,4.2254901960784315
3862474,4,B00278FS8M,"Like many other reviewers here, I am a Leslie Sansone fan and have a number of her DVD's.  I bought this one because I liked the concept of a planned-out 3-mile workout, which is a good length for me as I work out daily and sometimes 5 miles is just too much.  This is classic Leslie, the moves are all there.  Nothing amiss on that front.

The two observations I'd share:
1. Leslie seems not herself in this video.  In my collection, I have both workouts where she is alone, and where she is with her freinds.  The fact that she is on her own in this one is not itself the issue - she just seems a little ""flat"" and distratced.  She is not as naturally energetic and perky in this video as she is in others.  At one point, her top keeps riding up from the hem and she keeps tugging it down repeatedly.  Distracting to her and to the viewer.  It doesn't make the workout terrible, just not as motivating as others because she is not really as engaged.

2.  This is actually a more challenging workout than many of her others, so it's good for a veteran ""walker"", but may be a little too much for a beginner.  I can see someone becoming discouraged if this is their first attempt to ""walk at home"".  So...if you're startng out, look to some of her other dvd's like the 5-mile walk.  If you are experienced and just want one more dvd to round out your Leslie collection and you don't really mind that she is not as engaged and upbeat here as she is in other workouts, this is a good choice.

3.  This is minor, but the DVD does not contain ""chapters"" that you can seek with your remote if you want to skip a section and go to another, say, the cooldown after doing 2 miles out of the 3.  Minor, but I rely on that function in some of her other productions.

The video gives me the impression that it was not as carefully produced as others she has done.  It feels a bit thrown together, but is an excellent workout nonetheless.",1329350400,4,1925,4.193460490463215
3862475,5,B00278FS8M,"I received this dvd and was only to use it for a couple of weeks before I had to rest my arm due to golfers elbow; however, I plan on getting back on schedule and return to this dvd.

I never beleived on any home workouts, until my Health Coach advised I try Leslie Sansone, this is the answer to my excuse why I can't walk on any given day. I love this one, Leslie Sansone, Work Your Belly Flat, I have been working on it for 2 week and I can see a change already, my pant are loose and my belly is a 1/2 inch smaller! I can get a better work out than walking outside, it works my entire body and it is so easy to follow and best of all I can really see a difference and I can do it!

So I purchased this and two other Leslie Sanone DVD's. I have been putting one on most days and have lost my extra three kilos and have gained excellent toning to my arms and legs.

So I found that in DVD format, and came upon this one for getting the Belly Flat!  SO far I really like doing it, it's not too hard to get through, she's alone so she's not having all of that silly, filler annoying conversation with her 'crew'..it's just Leslie, and she's encouraging and inspirational.  The walk timer on the screen is neat because I see it and think to myself 'I can do this!'",1326672000,2,512,4.368421052631579

3862482,5,B00278FS8M,"This was my first time using any of Leslie's 'walk away the pounds' dvds but had a few friends who used them with nice results and I must say after using this dvd I lost 1/2 inch off my arms(I use 1.5 lb handweights thru the whole walk) and 1/2 inch off each thigh...I was impressed and that's not mentioning any mileage waled off my midsection, lol. Like she says' it's your workout' and so I combined some of the moves from the walk away the pounds and sculpt your arms with this one (i actually prefer the ones with her alone, it's like walking with a good friend :-)
I don't get these for the music aspect of it so I also like the fact that when the volume is low (for the early morning workouts when the house is asleep) I can still hear her walking and talking me thru it. I did add the handweights and some additional movements to optimize this walk but like she says' it's your walk' so have fun and walk that belly flat!!",1323993600,,930,4.143646408839779
3862483,4,B00278FS8M,"I've been ""walking"" to this video for several weeks now.  I love the exercise.  It is just the right level to challenge me and hopefully help me get to a more advanced level.  But there is one thing I absolutely HATE about the video.  There is far too much inane and ridiculous talk.  It is unfortunate that this was produced without much forethought or planning.  That is obvious with all the fumbling around for the right words at the right time.  The routine is fine, the music is fin.  I want a version without all the talk!!  The music isn't loud enough, especially on mile 3.  Now that I have the routine down pat I just want the music and a countdown at each change.  Enough already!!!  It was tiresome the first 25 times.  Now it is driving me crazy!!  If I could find out what the songs are I'd dub the music over all the talk and make the video less distracting.  I'll keep doing the walk routine daily, but something's gotta give!!!!",1322956800,,944,4.344827586206897

I can walk with her everyday, anytime of the day, rain or shine. My sister loved it and bought it too. I plan to give it to a co-worker too.",1320278400,7,318,3.557142857142857
3862485,5,B00278FS8M,I really like this work out DVD by Leslie Sansone. This is my first DVD from this instructor and she does not disappoint! All of the moves target the core from a standing position. She says that crunches sculpt the abdominals while burning calories by walking shows your abdominals. Leslie is upbeat and motivating. To speed up results I do the DVD twice and add more bicycles at the end of each. I am so excited about this DVD. I am also using this DVD to train for a 5k so that I will have more endurance.,1318723200,,507,4.237113402061856

I recommend this to everyone.",1318118400,2,329,3.8529411764705883
3862487,5,B00278FS8M,Very enjoyable workout. Great having options you can choose what length of workout you want to do depending on how much time you have.,1316995200,,134,4.625
3862488,3,B00278FS8M,"I just rented this from Netflix a couple of days ago and have done it five times because I'm not really sure what I want to rate it.

This workout is geared towards abdominal work and for that reason seems to include more moves like knee lifts with the legs open and kicks than usual. It also gets your heart pumping which, as we all know, assists in shedding fat. I started using weighted gloves to try to enhance the workload. Leslie also seems a little chubbier on this video although it could just be her outfit.

The first mile is about 14:30, the second is around 13:15 and the last mile is about 14:00. In the third mile, she ""boosts"" the walking for about 60-70 seconds. The music is the same old stuff she's been using for who knows how many years. After the first mile, you'll need your remote because the music fades out and at some points is barely audible; especially with Leslie's gabbing.

Another important issue is that the length of the third ""mile"" is questionable. There are three faster songs but none of them are played to completion. The second song (the song she does the boost to) only plays for about 2:30 minutes if that. Then there's an up tempo song I recognize from her 5-mile fat-burning walk and that song is barely played for 2 minutes. When there's still 4:50 left in the mile, she goes into the ""cool down walk"" that is so slow, it's not even funny. Not only that but the entire 4:50 ""cool down walk"" is pretty much completely without cues as Leslie chatters on about how belly fat is bad for you and a bunch of other stuff she's said a million times in her other videos.

Leslie should try going all out and not slowing down until the miles are completed and then doing a 3-5 minute ""cool down walk."" People feel cheated when the last ""mile"" is either slower or shorter than the others but is still called a ""mile.""

The big problem is Leslie talking. Missed cues, getting out of step (even with arm movements), and even losing the beat a time or two are all things that are present in this workout.

Leslie talks so much that she even apparently forgets what she's already said. OK, Leslie, we get it...crunches don't shed abdominal fat. No need to say it in the first mile, twice in the second and again in the third. I've reached the conclusion that she either talks to keep people from getting bored and quitting at midpoint (because her workouts don't have the variety of say a Cathe Friedrich or Patrick Goudeau) or she's the type of person who just can't tolerate silence and has to fill her immediate environment with carbon dioxide at every minute.

Anyway, I'm split between a 3 and a 4 rating so I'll go with a 3. Leslie really has to learn how to manage her need to talk or at least learn to talk and maintain coordination at the same time.

Oh yeah, as a bonus, when she's about 4 minutes away from the end of the 2nd mile, she apparently has a semi wardrobe malfunction because she's pulling up her pants and then looks into the camera like the cat that ate the canary.",1313452800,6,3019,4.378571428571429

I think all her videos are helpful insofar as they are fairly low impact and she does a good job of leading you positively to do what she does to get through the workouts. My disappointment here, is simply I wish there was more along the lines of focusing on losing fat in, or toning your belly area - a very difficult area for myself and my wife. However, overall, as typical I do recommend this DVD - but just wish it would have been more focused on walking your ""belly flat.""",1309651200,2,567,4.3584905660377355

3862500,4,B00278FS8M,"I got this DVD on sale at Kmart 2 years ago. I have other Leslie Sansone Walk DVDs and videos and thought I would add to my collection. This workout goes fast, is medium intensity, and has a light stomach workout at the end. Leslie doesn't introduce many new steps, but the moving sidesteps and enhanced walking in one section add variety and intensity. The music is okay, but it gets the job done. Leslie is by herself in this video, which adds a nice change from her other high-intensity workouts. As always, she introduces the basic four steps of her workouts in the warmup and proceeds from there. The walk clock counts the minutes and seconds and helps you get through the video.

Leslie combines the stomach workout at the end with the stretching. She does four sets of bicycle crunches and a lying, whole-body stretch on the floor.

Overall, this is a good addition to a Walk DVD library and is great when you don't feel like doing high intensity, but need a little more than a 2-mile walk.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-at-Home-Walk-Your-Belly-Flat/dp/B00278FS8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home: Walk Your Belly Flat</a>",1298592000,,1211,5.302083333333333

You can choose to do 1,2, or 3 miles which I like. There are a lot of knee lifts which work the abs. The short belly workout at the end is a plus. It is not intended to be a full abs workout.

3862515,5,B00278FS8M,"I really enjoyed this video by Leslie Sansone she is a great motivator and very realistic. I have 3 other dvd's by her and I find this one is the best. First of all, I like that the music is up to date and I found that the music in the other dvds weren't really workout material.  Also, I like that she is by herself and that the set is simple and not over done like past videos. I had an issue in past dvd's when she walked with groups because they would make comments and it would be very distracting and throw me off sometimes. So it is great that in the full workout video she is by herself and she is very motivating.

As for the workout, she maintains her regular steps she always use such as: walking, kicking, side steps, heel lifts, and knee lifts, but she adds extra moves that she used in previous videos but it seems to be more apart of the workout then ever. The video features the whole workout or you can do the 1,2,or 3 miles separately.

I think this workout video is a great for any age or sex, Leslie demonstrates easy moves that anyone can do and she gives great motivation through out the video. Also, the music is great to listen to while walking and she always encourages you to do as much as you can and slow down if you need too. If you purchase this work out video you will not be disappointed.",1272412800,,1320,4.128404669260701
3862516,4,B00278FS8M,"I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone's in-home walking workouts so it was natural for me to see what she might have out that was new.  This offering, ""Walk Your Belly Flat"", was one of three I purchased recently to add some variety to my usual routine.  Based on a three mile walk, Leslie takes us through the classic four moves used during in-home walking, but adds an emphasis on tightening and concentrating on abs while walking.  She also shows us an exercise at the end that she claims is ""the only move you will ever need to sculpt your abs."" She explains that all the crunches in the world won't result in a flat belly if you don't burn off fat from your whole body. I found this a good workout and the bicycle style ab exercise at the end had an effect the next day in sore muscles, so it must have done something.  I have added this workout into my rotation at twice a week.  The entire workout from warm up to stretch takes just under an hour.  Leslie is her usual perky self, which I like, and I'm happy with this purchase.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in increasing their activity level with a low impact total body workout.",1272153600,2,1148,4.287037037037037

3862518,5,B00278FS8M,"I own several of Leslie Sansone's DVDs, and this is one of my favorites, for these reasons:

1. It's a good, sweaty, 3 mile workout, and takes about 50 minutes to complete.
2. It's just Leslie by herself, in a studio.
3. There is a ""walk clock"" that shows how much time is left in each mile. LOVE that feature, wish it was on all of her DVDs.
4. If I feel ambitious, I can repeat mile 2, and get about an hour long, four mile workout.
5. I have arthritis in my ankles and knees and provided I stretch properly after, I can do this DVD without being in pain when I'm done.
6. I have chronic Achilles tendinitis and this workout actually helps me keep my ankles ""lubricated"" (like Leslie says, ""Juice in the joints!"") and therefore I have fewer painful days when I use her DVD regularly (which for me means every other day).

The only thing I would change is to have more DVDs that feature Leslie by herself, also have the walk clock, and are 3 or 4 mile workouts.",1271116800,17,962,4.194594594594594

Seriously, I hate it.  This video however is easy, and often I just turn on my ipod and walk, walk, walk.  I guarantee that if you watch what you eat (I don't cook, so I do the Weight Watcher's meals) and do this video, you will get results!  Good luck!",1270598400,23,603,4.219298245614035

If you already have a dvd for the same area then you probably don't need to buy the dvd. I would however strongly recommend that you get it if you don't have any targeting the belly area.

I only walk at least 3 times a week and I have lost the wait and can finally see my abs again. Of course this didn't happen in a day you have to stick to it to really reap the benefits and as Leslie says watch those calories. Yes I eat fries, chicken,ice cream, chocolate and pizza but not every day nor in excessive amounts. This is a safe permanent way to lose weight once you stick to it.

The dvd has 3 miles each about 13mins long and quite effective. At the end of the 3rd mile there is a short abs exercise to really target the belly fat so buy it and try it.",1269993600,2,895,3.966666666666667

Also, she's alone on this one so she doesn't get too goofy and giggly like in the others.  But I like her and she's very encouraging.  The only drawback is I have a hard time hearing the music, and when I can hear it, it sounds very repetitive and so that becomes boring, even though it is high energy.

3862529,4,B00278FS8M,"I have a large collection of Leslie's workout DVD's and this one (and her 5-Mile Fat Burning Walk) are my two favorites so far.  I noticed immediate changes to my body once I started doing this workout.  The entire workout focuses on the ""core muscles"" and I really feel it all over during and afer the workouts.  I've lost 20 pounds and quite a few inches in just over 5 weeks by following a healthy food plan and working out w/ Leslie 5 to 7 days a week, and I've seen the numbers drop on the scale even more since incorporating this workout into my daily routine.

CONS:  There IS stretching at the end of this DVD, following the bicycle crunches she shows you at the end of the workout.  But the cons of this workout for me are this:  though each mile tells you when you've ended the mile, if I only want to do 2 miles, I have to fast-forward thru the third mile to get to the extra ab workout and stretches.  Seems like they would have set up a tab to foward to for that.  Also, the quality of the graphics isn't the best.  I keep looking at Leslie and wondering why she's having such a ""bad hair day"" (LOL) and why her upper arms look a little distorted.

PROS:  I enjoy this being a one-on-one workout w/ just Leslie and me.  While I sometimes enjoy the workouts w/ others, I actually prefer working out w/ just Leslie.  She's not so ""chatty"" as she is w/ the other gals, and I feel I have my own ""personal trainer"" who is focused on me and guiding me through my workout.  She's giving helpful info throughout the workout (i.e. reminding me to keep my core tight/belly pulled in, to reach as far as I can, to stretch out as far as I can, and general health and muscle info, etc.) that somehow pushes me to keep going and do the best I can do.  It's an intense workout that I feel throughout my body and I am seeing very positive ressults.  Also, she seems to know when I'm getting tired and about to give up and motivates me to keep going when I probably wouldn't have otherwise.  I've recommended this one to several friends.",1267574400,7,2033,4.22279792746114

""mile 1, mile 2, mile 3"" but in all actuality it's just the video that keeps playing. I had to stop it myself once mile 1 was completed. There was also no option to just go to the abs portion except to begin the program and fast forward through all three miles. Technology is too advanced for this type of laziness... she's not saving any money in the cost of video production by just lumping it all in together. I'll be bringing this one back.

3862533,5,B00278FS8M,"I have 5 other WATP DVD's with Leslie and this is by far my favorite one yet. First, I like the pace. It's a faster tempo than some of the other workouts and so it feels like I've really accomplished something. Also, Leslie is much better about letting the audience know what is coming next and then doing what she says she is going to do. On some of the other DVD's there are times when she says one thing and does another.

I love the workouts when Leslie is alone, like this one, because she gets so giggly and sappy when she has a group. She'll giggle a lot, call people love and doll. That's not for me, so this one is great. She has only one giggle episode with herself and when it happens, she admits she loves to giggle.

Leslie explains why this is a walk for belly fat. She explains that belly fat isn't burned just by floor crunches, that fat is burned by aerobic exercise, which is why this standing routine still burns belly fat. Without the walker even realizing it, he or she is working the abs through the standing crunches and ab rotation that are part of this workout. The short floor exercise at the end is just an add-on to an already great workout.

My only disappointment with this DVD is that the music is not loud enough. When I turn it up louder, Leslie still drowns out the beat sometimes. I like hearing the music so that I can keep up the pace without having to stare right at the TV.

3862540,5,B00278FS8M,"As someone with a large collection of fitness dvds, walking dvds can be either hit or miss. Some can be boring and redundant while others can bring in strangely complicated choreography for something called ""walking""...This hit the bullseye for energy and interest but it actually had a high caloric burn as well!

CALORIE BURN: I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily calorie burn. Because of this, it also enables me to compare the calorie burn of all my workouts as to how many calories they burn not only during the workout, but per minute. I mention this only so that you know what I say is based upon measurement rather than perceived exertion...while there is no plyometrics and joint straining moves like ""mountain climbers"", she combines more simple moves with hand movements at a pace fast enough to ensure your heart stays in the target zone and the calories are revved. I didn't feel as though I was worn out, working as hard as when I do my intense aerobics, yet I have to say this burned a LOT of calories in whatever time span you choose to do it. That made it quite impressive because, especially if you've had some days of strength training, this is not hard on your muscles or joints, yet achieves just what it should.

INSTRUCTOR: I couldn't put my finger on why I liked this instructor for the longest time and why she seemed different...I think the best analogy I can give is if you watch ""The Biggest Loser"" you see how the trainer Bob seems to not be ""acting"" for the camera or being anything but genuine, yet Jillian does. Often there seems to be some nervousness or ""over the top"" dialogue from trainers on dvds. Instead, this one seemed to be as though you were in a room with a friend who was showing you a routine she does. I can't quite put my finger on how to relay that...other than she seemed like she had done the routine a million times due to her comfort level, yet that she still loved it due to her energy. Often trainers fill up every empty second with words like ""that's it"" ""you've got it"" ""you remember this"" ""You are doing awesome"" etc...this one didn't seem to need to do that...she just spoke comfortably throughout with good reminders of how to do it right as well. Don't get me wrong, she still pushed you and encouraged you but didn't use the words just to fill an empty silence because of not thinking of anything else to say.

SET: They kinda went all out for this video...It looks like an upscale studio. 12 foot letters spell out ""walk"" on the back wall, motivational words flash across the screen, there is a big blow up of the instructor with someone on the left wall, you see REAL cars outside a window so you know it's not a set, a clock counts down how far you have walked and lets you know when you have hit a mile or two. Very different. I wondered if she has her own upscale studio and does these routines in this place.

MUSIC: Typically in workout dvds you have something made for the dvd that can be a little monotonous and all ""electronica"", but this was more like there was a dj putting on different tracks. Still background music, but it switched it up for interest and it kept it different and the pace of the music also increased as the pace of the steps did.

MOVES: When I say this it sounds so boring but I have little attentioin span when I work out, no matter how often I do it, and this is one of the few that kept it up the whole time so I'm trying to get the best wording when I say that it's easy choreography (and when I say ""choreography"" do not think you'll be tripped up once...you won't.) with moves that are all variations of walking...kick backs, knee lifts, grapevine, etc etc with arm movements. You WILL be able to follow her. So much so that she says ""We don't tell you which leg you need to start with. It makes no difference. They both get worked out anyway"" and then she'll say something like ""kick backs"" and it truly doesn't matter which leg you start with.  Her moves are made so that you don't have to rewind to figure out how to ""put the steps together"" or worry about keeping it. Yet it's a true workout. She has really taken the best of routines and made it easy for all to do but still garner great results.

WHAT YOU GET:
A warm up
A brisk 4-5 mph pace of moves that I found fun
Mile Markers in the video celebrate when you've hit your mile mark of choice and allow you to keep going til you do
Compound Muscle Movements ensure you hit more muscle groups than regular walking
Cool Down Walk
Stretch
bonus ""super sculpt the belly"" floor work

total running time:53 minutes

I think few dvds can take you from beginner to being someone who works out daily and still feel your needs but I think this one can and still keep your interest.

If it's your only dvd, I would suggest adding another into your mix with some strength training or a circuit that has a combo of cardio and strength training in order to tighten and tone, but this will offer easy to follow fat burning.

NEGATIVES: I wish that she had included more standing ab work rather than limiting it to a different section. This workout will help you lose ab fat and she discusses that often, but there are still some twisting moves that can be done while doing simple walking moves that could further tighten your core as well. This is a minor thing, but no dvd is perfect so I like to cover all bases that someone may look for.

CONCLUSION: A good solid workout for any level. Enjoyable, good energy, perfect easy to follow cueing, good calorie burn",1260576000,86,5507,4.3671875

3862550,3,B00278FS8M,"This walking workout DVD is OK, but I'm disappointed.  I have four other Leslie Sansone walking DVDs, and like those a lot.  But this new one has a couple big differences.

Leslie's other DVDs (at least the four others I have) all begin with a warm-up, and end with a cool-down, followed by a couple minutes of stretching.  She always emphasizes how important those parts of a workout are.  The actual miles are timed separately and are distinguishable by changes in music.

However, this new workout, which is supposed to be three miles in length, is set up this way: Each mile is just over 13 minutes long.  But the first mile starts with about four minutes of warming up, so you're not getting a true mile walk, since the remaining nine minutes are not done at a fast enough pace to equal one mile themselves.  The third mile is similarly set up, with the first nine or so minutes being ""the third mile,"" and the last four or so minutes being the cool-down period.  I feel cheated out of actual mile walking time.

Also, the other four DVDs I own all finish the workouts with a couple minutes of stretching.  But this new DVD goes directly to Leslie demonstrating the abs exercise, which is a good one.  But I think there should be stretching!

Finally, three of the four other DVDs of Leslie's that I own have her walking with a group of several people during most if not all of the workouts.  This new DVD has her by herself.  I happen to like the interaction between her and her follow walkers, and think when she is by herself, it's a little ""flat.""  But, other people may prefer her by herself because they find the talking to the other people to be distracting.

I will continue to use this DVD, since I really like to have a variety of Leslie's walking workouts - I can use them no matter what the weather, they're cheaper than joining a fitness club, and they're less stressful on my joints.  But I wish Leslie had included stretching and some other walkers, as well as three ""true"" miles, on this DVD.",1253577600,69,2013,4.438692098092643

I enjoy doing the walk more when she has her buddies walking along with her. I like to watch her interaction with the other walkers. But I did like the stomach exercise that was at the end of the walk.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walk-at-Home-Walk-Your-Belly-Flat/dp/B00278FS8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walk at Home-Walk Your Belly Flat</a>",1252800000,2,527,6.135135135135135

3862555,5,B00278FS8M,"I find Leslie's videos okay; however, they are great for my husband because he is not very rhythmic and has ADD.  He enjoys the repetition because if he does not get it the first time, he will get it the next.  To make it more enjoyable we exercise together, he does two 1 mile and I do the one mile, then 2 mile.  Instead of walking in place, we walk throughout the house and we do some of the moves while holding hands.  Since I have been into exercising since I was in high school (late 70s) and was I the Army for 10 years, I know how to make exercising enjoyable.

3862557,5,B00278FS8M,I enjoy doing all of Leslie's workouts and this one does not disappoint! With her up-beat personality and positive energy it is hard not to feel the same. As with all her video's Leslie provide's another great workout which definitely leaves me feeling tired but with a sense of accomplishment. Losing weight and staying fit definitely isn't easy (especially after 4 kids!) but Leslie provide's a great opportunity to fit in a daily walk and time to de-stress!,1251158400,,460,4.910256410256411
3862558,5,B00278FS8M,"This Leslie Sansone dvd is positively one of her best workouts to date. Leslie is featured totally on her own throughout this 3 mile workout.
Each mile can be done on their own or all 3 together. I recommened all 3 together, followed by her mat workout which consists of bicylce crunches. Don't be fooled by the simplicity of this mat workout. Although short, my abs were burning by the end.
After completing the full dvd, I had burned a total of 437 calories! Leslie is once again very motivational throughout this workout without going overboard,and also educates about posture,bones and muscles. I highly recommend this dvd as a supplement to any workout, or on it's own for a low intense workout.",1251072000,10,700,4.745901639344262

A friend of mine recommended this DVD because she used it to flatten her belly.

I ordered it the same day and received it August 16, 2016.  I began using it immediately doing my morning exercise routine 5 days a week.

I am motivated by Leslie Sansone because she looks like a normal size fit woman.  The exercises are practical and very effective.  She is a refreshing contrast to the skinny instructors that conduct a boot-camp style exercise regiment.

She is genuine, friendly, and engaging.

After the exercise, I feel invigorated and have that sense of accomplishment because I did the right thing by starting the day with expresso, prayer, and then a 3 mile work-out, combined with the stomach-toning exercise.

My waist has reduced by an inch.  But most importantly, my core feels strong and more toned.  I now wear a size smaller dress.
