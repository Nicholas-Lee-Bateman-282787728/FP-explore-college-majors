7919157,3,B00003L9KC,"This tape is okay. It contains the 3 cartoons:
Wacky Wabbit
A Corny Concerto
Falling Hare
Around 20-30 minutes.
The quality of the cartoons are pretty good. The Wacky Wabbit has slightly muffled sound but the picture is pretty good, A Corny Concerto has clear sound and good picture, and Falling Hare is slowed down a slight bit and the picture is about the same as The Wacky Wabbit.
Your average Public Domain tape.
3 out of 5 stars.",1234742400,,434,4.506329113924051
7919158,2,B00003L9KC,"These cartoons feature the old version of bugs bunny from the 1940s.

I gave it 2 stars since I don't like this incarnation of Bugs.

I don't know exactly when they transformed Bugs into the more familiar version which to me was his best incarnation.  Probably in the 1950s sometime.

7919159,1,B00003L9KC,This is pirate video (video of a video).  The quality is awful!! We sent ours back.  I had no idea I was ordering a pirate video.  Do not order this video!!,1023494400,7,156,3.967741935483871
7919160,1,B00003L9KC,"The quality [stinks].  The tape [stinks].  Generic label (as in black text, white label).  Static screen, color washout, not worth the price of the tape it was recorded on (and at SLP to boot).
If you buy this tape, you WILL regret it.
It is sacrilegious to record Bugs Bunny with such poor quality!
Man, I wish I read the reviews first....",1017360000,12,340,4.451612903225806
7919161,1,B00003L9KC,"The reproduction quality of these cartoons on this tape is atrocious.  You will do better recording your own off the TV.  I don't understand why Videomatic International Corp. bothers to record and package something this shoddy. Washed out, scratchy...simply terrible.  Too bad, cause there are a couple classic Bob Clampett WWII era toons on there.  There is also one with an embarrassing racial stereotype, that was redone later with Elmer Fudd scene for scene.  Of slight historical interest.  Anyway, save your money; you are warned, this tape stinks.  Wish someone had warned me.",1007078400,19,584,5.21505376344086
7919162,4,B00003L9KC,"There have been many directors who have watered down Bugs over the years into a bland wise cracker. This tape has the real Bugs. Hilarious stuff... not the Chuck Jones rehashed garbage. There is absolutly no Speedy, Foghorn, or Sylvester. None of the trash. Even Elmer is the classic thing, not the boring one most of us had been forced to watch on TV. Not one bad cartoon on this tape!
Let's face it, Robert McKimson and Chuck Jones have begun to ruin Bugs starting in 1951. These pre50s cartoons are the real gems. Real wise cracking, really funny, real Bugs.
I only give this one a 4 star because I've seen better quality on these same titles on television. Still, a must have for real cartoon enthusiasts.",983145600,10,709,4.546875
