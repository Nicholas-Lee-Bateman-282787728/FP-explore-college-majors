8313529,2,B001JQHT62,"This movie is based on a 1610 French novel which takes place in fifth-century Gaul. The story is about the title lovers, children of two feuding families, and at a festival, Celadon tries to hide the romance by pretending to be in love with another girl. Though it was for show, Astrea assumes Celadon's infidelity was genuine and tells him she never wants to see him again, though he threatens to drown himself...and jumps into the river to do so.

This causes distress to both the villagers, especially Astrea...but they are unaware that he had been rescued by three nymphs who take him to their castle. One nymph wants Celadon for himself, but another manages to smuggle him out and have him live in the forest, with her druid father coming to help him. But Celadon won't go home because Astrea ordered her not to see him. The rest of the movie revolves around getting Astrea and Celadon back together, which is much more time-consuming than it should be.

The movie is full of elements that hardly evoke what fifth-century Gaul must have been like, including a castle and garden that must have dated from at least a millennium later, overly-refined statuary and writing and such, and the discussions of love and religion have little relevance to the overall story. Worst of all, however, is that the two lovers could have gotten back together without having had to resort to all the rigmarole-hence my review title.",1490572800,,1419,4.764227642276423
8313530,3,B001JQHT62,"This was Eric Rohmers last movie, which he made in 2007 at 87 (he would die three years later). He decided to close his distinguished career by filming a famous French pastoral novel of the 1600s, considered unfilmable by those who have read it. Rohmer, who before becoming a director was a professor of French Literature, has always been one of the most literary of all directors. The action takes place in an anachronistic, fantastic Gaul among a rural community of shepherds. The silly, absurd plot (which is never played for laughs) has the shepherd Celadon fled the village after his love Astrea suspects him of making merry with another shepherdess during a party there. Astrea is led to believe that he drowned in the river while fleeing, and she mourns him madly, but he has actually been rescued by a community of nymphs, who live in a renaissance-style castle and whose leader is mad with Celadon and doesnt let him leave the place (in the film, every woman is madly in love with Celadon). One of the nymphs eventually gets the head druid involved (who sputters platitudes and new age like nonsense and is played by Serge Renko, who was the Soviet spy in Triple Agent - Rohmers previous, great film, sadly little known). Not very profound, and a bit of a gimmick, this bucolic, languid film is pleasant to watch. The young, little known beautiful actors, who always say their lines in perfectly enunciated French, help.",1385251200,2,1429,4.766129032258065
8313531,4,B001JQHT62,"Rohmer has long been known to take as subject in comedies,romances and moral tales the conflict between desire,the reality in which characters function,and the morality by which they live,setting up a dialectic of philosophical rumination. People talk about love,it's their thoughts rather than their actions he explores. Dialogue is filmed as a part of the landscape:""I show people who move and speak"".In The Romance of Astrea and Celadon,he retreats to the bucolic pastures of 5th century Gaul,the singing,dancing and loving of shepherds and shepherdesses,as `17thcentury people imagined them' from Honore D'Urfe's novel L'Astree, a fabulous tale of love, heartbreak and cross-dressing among young shepherds,nymphs and druids in fifth-century Gaul: of earthly rather than celestial values.

He seems to be stripping back the complexity and sophistication of civilization and working from a simpler palette. Rural life provides a model of a simpler,more wholesome way of life than court or city,the formalized rituals of courtly love. Idealized and engaging: dark, dusky-eyed Celadon (Andy Gillet) throws himself in the river when blond-tressed lover Astrea (Stphanie Crayencour) rejects his protestations of innocence of infidelity, butsurvives to receive a fundamental sentimental education, not least at the sensuous hands of a party of diaphanous nymphs. He is under a curse never to see her again. The paradoxes of life between heart and head,body and soul,sex and love play out. As he lives in the forest he is taught valuable lessons by a druid that he could get close to Astrea under disguise.

He secretly insinuates himself into her company disguised as a girl. Think of mid- period Shakespearian comedy romances like As You Like It. Celadon cannot disobey Astrea,how can he reunite with her in her remorse?You get tunics and smocks and classical speech. There is a clownish musician who argues with Lycidas,saying promiscuity is good,the other characters soon grow tired of him. When Celadon enters the bed-chamber with Astrea and other semi-clad maidens, we are reminded of Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in Some Like it Hot. Shot largely in the open air,with many a pert breast poking through or revealed thigh of those who sleep,its great how the pared-down pictorial mise-en-scene by-passes the confused clutter of modern film to deliver up the wisdom of a lifetime,with joy, serenity, passion and hope. Eros lives.",1376524800,,2428,5.403693931398417
8313532,5,B001JQHT62,"""Astrea and Celadon"" is as beautifully realised as anything Rohmer ever did in terms of the staging, the choreographing of the actors' movements in relation to each other, and their placement within natural landscapes; and it revels in the same sly, witty, touching and subtle complexities of attitude, of give-and-take between the characters that distinguished the best of this great director's films for over four decades. The final scene of reconciliation between the lovers, Celadon still disguised as a girl - indeed, wearing Astrea's dress - is not only deeply moving but deliriously erotic too!

Some further observations: (1) When the two women rescue the unconscious Celadon from the riverbank, both fall for him, but haughty Galatea wishes to ensnare him while Leonidas loves him selflessly and seeks only to free him. (2) Taking issue with Celadon's brother Lycidas and his idealised view of commitment and fidelity, Hylas the minstrel praises a promiscuous attitude to love, and his two ""groupies"" hang onto his arms, and his every word. Next time we see them, at the woodland shrine Celadon has created in honour of Astrea, the girls have clearly tired of him and keep their distance. (3) The speech made by Adamas the druid in the presence of the Roman god statues cleverly conflates elements of theology from four different periods: Ancient Rome, Medieval France, 17th century France (when the original romance was written) ... and the present day! (4) This radiant, understated film repays repeat viewings: all kinds of subtleties become apparent.",1322784000,2,1563,5.2023809523809526
8313533,5,B001JQHT62,"Eric Rohmer's announced last film, The Romance of Astrea and Cladon, is a costumed period piece based on a 1610 novel by Honor d'Urf that imagines what life was like in Fifth century Gaul. It is a work of sublime physical beauty and surprising eroticism that looks both backwards and forwards in time. While it appears to be a look back at a nave and outdated way of life, it may indeed be the opposite - Rohmer's final rebuke of the spiritual emptiness of the modern world, and a preview of a new world struggling to be born. This strange dichotomy is implied by the unusual preface in which a voice announces that the story had to be moved from the Forez plain, ""now disfigured by urban blight and conifer plantations, to another part of France whose scenery has retained its wild poetry and bucolic charm.""

Rohmer transports the viewer to a world of idyllic streams and forests where shepherds dress in the tunics of the Seventeenth century. Celadon (Andy Gillet), a young man of noble birth has chosen the simple life of a shepherd and is deeply in love with Astrea (Stephanie Crayencour), a shepherdess of more modest family lineage. Though the film in lesser hands might have seemed a bit silly, Rohmer's straightforward direction reveals an emotional truth often obscured by modern cinematic techniques of fast cuts, hand-held camerawork, and curse words that are supposed to enhance ""realism.

At a family gathering, Cladon pretends to be infatuated with Amynthe (Priscilla Galland) to mollify his and Astrea's parents who are bickering, but when Astrea sees him kiss the other woman, she is racked by jealousy and orders Celadon to stay away from her forever ""unless I bid you otherwise"". In despair, Cladon says ""I'll drown myself, at once"" and proceeds to jump into the river - at once, but is rescued before drowning by the nymph Galathea (Veronique Reymond) who brings him to her castle and, with the support of two other nymphs, nurses him back to health.

When Galathea discovers how attractive he is, however, she wants Cladon for her own pleasure and forbids him to leave the castle but, in the film's first instance of cross-dressing (a notorious Shakespearean plot device), he is smuggled out by another nymph, Leonide (Cecile Cassel) and hides out in the woods. Astrea believes Cladon to be dead and with some regret, forgives him and loves him more than ever, though Cladon refuses to see her out of respect for her word. He begins to rethink his position, however, after being visited by a druid priest (Serge Renko) who hatches a secret scheme to reunite the two lovers.

The Romance of Astrea and Cladon is filled with a lightness that is absent from Rohmer's more talky Six Moral Tales and later films in which the characters pontificate at length on the ins and outs of romantic love. His philosophical (and Catholic) bent surfaces, however, in a scene in which Hylas (Rodolphe Pauly), a jester, who is regarded with complete disdain by others, berates the follies of indiscriminate sexuality while Lycidas (Jocelyn Quivrin) promotes love as an ideal that merges two souls into one and the film's robust final sequence demonstrates the extremes one may go to for love.

In The Romance of Astrea and Cladon, Rohmer, now in his 87th year, promotes the ideals of commitment, the integrity of one's word, and the poetry of romantic love without its modern day clatter. While these ideals may not seem terribly exciting (one film critic wrote that, ""maybe humankind ditched romantic fidelity because it isn't exciting!""), they act to ground us in our noblest aspirations, to remind us of what it means to be human, a task that, in his six decades of filmmaking, Rohmer has exquisitely accomplished and which The Romance of Astrea and Cladon places a final exclamation point.",1234569600,19,3796,4.860896445131376
