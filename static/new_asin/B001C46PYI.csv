They look to be copied DVD formats, mostly grainy in picture quality and have numerous ""jumps"" in the film.  Like parts of the film are missing.  Its nice to have her serial type films and I enjoyed what there was, but I was let down by the film quality and won't purchase any others through Quality Information Publishers.  I feel they could have sold this much cheaper and warned the buyer of the low picture quality of the films.",1391731200,,508,4.260416666666667
