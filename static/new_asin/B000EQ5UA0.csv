It is unlike some DVDs of old movies that the pictures were blurry, grainy and fading and seems to be produced by Desert Island videos and Mr fat-W videos. I now avoid these two productions like I avoiding defects because there are defects.",1471305600,,409,4.774647887323944
8113261,5,B000EQ5UA0,"If you love euro crimes you'll dig it, you just can't take it to seriously. Fabio Testi is awesome as always & Hemmings is a great choice for the co star, it's kind of a different roll than we're used to. It's fun & for the price just go for it.",1457136000,,245,3.823529411764706
8113262,5,B000EQ5UA0,"Excellent 70's Euro crime film starring the iconic Fabio Testi as a cop going deep undercover to bust up an international heroin ring. A lot of great location shooting, and non-stop action. Testi also performs his own stunts, which are very impressive. This is a great grindhouse classic, filled with violence, sex, and explicit drug use, and a cast of truly off-the-wall characters, this one is sure to entertain. This transfer from Blue Underground is beautiful, although it would have been nice if they had included the Italian audio with subtitles. But that is a minor detail. Recommended, especially for fans of Fabio Testi; this is one of his best..",1452816000,,655,4.963636363636364
8113263,3,B000EQ5UA0,"For most of its running time Enzo G. Castellari's The Heroin Busters is an exercise in lazy plotting and almost arbitrary box ticking as it flatly trudges through the usual cops and drug runners clich&eacute;s, which wouldn't matter so much if the action scenes were better. Unfortunately despite a decent botched evidence room robbery, it's a film that's saving most of its ammunition for its grand finale. But when it comes, it's a grand enough finale for you to forgive a lot of the padding it took to get there, the final twenty minutes offering a prolonged chase through a subway construction site and the ruins around the Caracarla Opera that displays the kind of verve and imagination so much of the film had been lacking until then, and clearly influencing both Diva and Lethal Weapon 3 along the way. It's well worth waiting for.

David Hemmings' Interpol cop doesn't have much to do apart from make the odd bad tempered speech or copping a feel from an obliging girl on a motorcycle while Fabio Testi is his usual monolithic self as the new boy on the crime scene trying to work his way into the mob. If anything Joshua Sinclair's villain makes more of an impression if only by virtue of his untrustworthy pencil `tache, cigarette holder and English accent that makes you wonder if Terry Thomas is a role model to Italian drug lords. Surprisingly Goblin's score works against much of the picture, especially the opening sequence that clumsily moves between Hong Kong, Amsterdam and New York, and Massimo De Rita and Galliano Juso's script is often shoddily constructed in the first half but it does at least offer a couple of odd surrealist touches and a gratuitous lesbian scene to keep the audience's interest while you're waiting for the action to kick off. It's just a pity the wait wasn't a bit more interesting.

Blue Underground's NTSC DVD offers a decent widescreen transfer of the English language version with a rather unfocussed audio commentary by Enzo G. Castellari and the theatrical trailer as extras.",1351555200,2,2026,4.835734870317003
8113264,3,B000EQ5UA0,"Undercover narc and terminal fashion victim Fabio Testi takes on dope peddlers with the help of a surprisingly spry David Hemmings in this trashy, but kind of fun, outing.  Stick around for the final half hour, where seemingly every mode of transportation available to the filmmakers is employed in a wild chase.  Crack open a Peroni and goof on the poorly dubbed rest of it.",1282176000,2,375,4.753846153846154
8113265,4,B000EQ5UA0,"HEROIN BUSTERS, or translated literally from the Italian, ""The

Drug Avenue"" (la Via della Droga), is a fascinating,

action-packed movie, pulling all the stops for thrills and

action, not excluding plenty of  gun-shooting, in a race between

the criminal element and law enforcement. There's motorcycle,

airplane and car chases around Italy on land, foot and air.

The action is dubbed in English, in an extremely fluent,

understandable manner.

The success of this movie, is that it is outstanding in its

quality considering the ""technology"" that was at the director's

disposal at the time. Obviously, the Hollywood studios, with

100's of millions of USD greater budgets, and with technology 20

years newer than at the time the film was made, create products

these days that are measurably different. But are they really

that much better ? Some things never change, such as the human

species, emotion, and the cultural, economic and social aspects

of a country, whether it by Italy, USA, etc.

Having been filmed in Europe, in 1977, anyone with memories of

hat era, will judge as occasionally comical the immediately

recognizable FIAT vehicle models of the time, and others (such

as Citroen 2 Horse Power, FIAT, small compact Fords, etc.), the

presentation of outdoor and indoor cafes, pinball machines,

cobble stone roads, and overall landscape scenes from the

Italian countryside, that are almost identical to those found in

Spain, and Portugal.

The soundtrack is extremely well chosen, as well, with a few

repetitive riffs, reminiscent of the 70's heavy metal scene,

such as Yngwie Malmsteen's style or Black Sabbath, or Jean Luc

Ponty's more fusion jazz elements.

The opener is somewhat provocative to perhaps those residing

outside the major agglomerations, by depicting the red light

district major metropolises around the world, such as those of

Tokyo, Amsterdam, Thailand or Hong Kong, New York, London, and

from there, progresses to show a certain marginal element of

society. These are outside of the mainstream, consuming and

trafficking at times heroin, visibly. The marketing aspect is

also touched upon, by a character admitting that free drugs were

supplied to school kids to get them hooked from an early age

into the substances, not unlike major American and multinational

corporations give away free comic books, DVD's, breakfast cereal

with other propaganda, to impart in their minds a brand loyalty

that will pay off bigtime when the kids become breadwinners and

adults.

Considering the outstanding results the director obtained with

the budget and technology available in 1977, the cast can be

proud of the results, as it's cool enough for the DVD to be

pulled out a few times again, considering the extremely sharp

digital filming, stimulating story. As a bonus, there's a

director commentary in the extras.",1174521600,3,2873,5.222466960352423
8113266,3,B000EQ5UA0,"Heroin Busters is one of a few recent Enzo Castellari action flicks put out by Blue Underground...and it's not so hot.  It's not bad exactly, it's just kinda boring.  I watched it all the way through, and it has it's moments, but for the mostpart it's just kinda flat.  Italian action star/prettyboy Fabio Testi is an undercover cop in the middle of a sting in the international heroin underworld.  The immortal David Hemmings is his partner, and the only cop who knows that Testi's undercover.  The whole film is pretty much a step by step drug dealing sting with no real excitement or drama.  Like I said, it's not terrible, but you begin to wonder when something cool's gonna happen.  Things do pick up a bit in the last act when Testi's cover's blown and he's on the run from the dealers who want revenge, but by that time it's too little too late.  The film ends with probably the most boring plane chase ever put on film.  Testi's fun to watch as usual.  Hemmings is good, but ultimately his role is kinda...not pointless exactly, but he just doesn't really have much to do.  Castellari has definitely made better.  Street Law is a good example.",1151971200,8,1151,4.560975609756097
