When I finally received the DVD in the mail and put it in an error message displayed on the DVD player saying this DVD cannot be played in this region.

6993164,1,B00SV2R8WM,"If you buy this product, first read the fine print. This DVD only plays on European DVD players which plays in a different format that USA DVD players. And they will only let you return it if you don't open it. Now I have 4 seasons of Cougar Town that I can't watch and can't return. If you have an American DVD playerDO NOT ORDER THIS DVD!!!!!!",1463356800,2,345,4.164179104477612
6993165,5,B00SV2R8WM,"Hi,  So I ordered this season 4 knowing it's not your USA region DVD 1, thought that's OK, I've got a portable DVD player, region free.  DID  NOT PLAY !  Said  WRONG REGION  !!  OK, so then tried my Toshiba laptop, got the same response from the Toshiba DVD player.  But I am running WIN Vista on this laptop & also have a Power DVD software program installed.

  When I re-inserted Cougar Town 4 , & running Power DVD, it said it needed to change to region 2, said  ' OK ' ,  switched & then played OK !!!

 I think this fix will only work if you have an older laptop /desktop running WIN Vista / XP , & have a Power DVD CD disc.  The Power DVD copy I have will not work with WIN  7 , 8 , 10 etc.  Only the old versions of WIN that came with the vidieo cards back in the early 2000's, & they had a free Power DVD disc included.  Don't know if Power DVD is still around or not.

 Hope this helps some of you out there.

  I have watched a few episodes of Season 4,  GREAT  !!!",1463356800,4,976,3.803030303030303

First of all, the inside case was broken - but more importantly, I could not play this DVD in my player. So disappointed I don't know what to say.
