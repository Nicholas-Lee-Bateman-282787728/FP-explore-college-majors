1888746,5,B00009QG5Q,"This is, as always, a great addition to the ""Little House"" series and consistently delivers that same inspiring message of family, faith, and love. The basic storyline follows Charles Ingalls' struggle to cope with his mother's death and, even more so, the emotional decline in his father. Charles finally manages to bring him home to the family, hoping it will help. Indeed, spending time with everyone--especially little Laura--works wonders in rebuilding the man's spirit until Laura gets into an accident with her horse and blames her grandfather for it. Feeling guilty and disgusted with himself, Grandpa takes off without telling anyone, but in the end it is Laura who accepts her own mistake and takes up the struggle to bring him back.
Some fans may be disappointed with the way the episode ends, but it is still a wonderful story that makes you feel good and is worth the money.",1065139200,11,887,4.92

7992638,5,B00009QG5Q,"I am currently seventeen years old. Even as an older teenage boy, Little House on the Prairie is my favorite tv show. I cannot think of any shows or movies as fascinating as Little House on the Prairie. Journey in the Spring is one of those episodes I really like.

Yesterday I watched Journey in the Spring (both parts) with my family for Thanksgiving. I recommend this episode for Thanksgiving. It was fun. I agree completely that it was of course sad that Charles Ingalls' mother died. I think it made it even sadder that his father never let him know she was ill. I agree, it would have been better if they had a chance to visit his mother before she died (whose name was Laura like the main character of Little House).

I thought it was cute how Carrie liked having a turkey named Tom (tom is the name for a male turkey, just like 'rooster' is the name for a male chicken, and 'hen' is the name for female chickens and female turkeys). She did not know, though, that they were going to have *Tom* for supper on Thanksgiving. She thought they were going to *have* him for supper. I am glad in the end they brought Tom back to the turkey place and did not eat him for Thanksgiving.

I also thought it was sad that Laura's beloved horse Bunny died. Her grandfather promised he would heal Bunny (he had been making promises he would never keep), but Bunny was so badly infected she had to get shot by Charles, which broke Laura's heart. I agree completely her grandfather was wrong to make all those promises he would not keep, but how hateful of Laura to purposely break those beautiful flower pots which were on the porch of the sod house which her grandpa was staying in.

Grandpa felt so hurt he decided to flee from the Ingalls place and Laura decided afterward to search for him. Grandpa felt unneeded. In the end, though, Laura and Grandpa both truly forgive each other and make up.

As I said, this is a great episode. My favorite episodes are Back to School, Sweet Sixteen, and He Loves Me He Loves Me Not (from Season 6) and The Reincarnation of Nellie (from Season 8). I really wish those episodes were also available on separate DVDs. As a matter of fact, I wish every single Little House on the Prairie episode were available as individuals on DVD. I am glad I'll Be Waving As You Drive Away is available on DVD, another of my favorites. I really hope this continues.

I really enjoy Little House on the Prairie on Collector's Edition. It is nicer and more old-fashioned looking than Deluxe Remastered Edition. The only problems I find with Collector's Edition though is their missing scenes and no subtitles. If Collector's Editon only had subtitles and no deleted scenes, I would be totally satisfied.",1480032000,,2717,4.501014198782961

God is mentioned in nearly every episode and people are encouraged to have love, compassion and understanding of each other. You just can't find entertainment like this on DVD or TV anymore..  :-) If there were more than 5 stars to rate Little House on, I'd make it the BEST!!",1315008000,,378,4.7272727272727275
