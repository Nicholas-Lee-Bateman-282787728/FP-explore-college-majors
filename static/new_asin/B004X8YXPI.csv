8446539,5,B004X8YXPI,"This is perfect for both Japanese and English customers.  Everything on it and the menus is bilingual.  Dialogue and subtitles come in both languages.  You even get a Japanese booklet and separate English booklet.  Picture quality of course is perfect. The only thing you could complain about is that they didn't give the English dubs a 5.1 surround sound option, it can only do stereo while the Japanese dialogue gets both.  Lastly the packaging material does feel very paper like. Regardless, the style of the packaging is extremely elegant.",1455580800,,543,5.056179775280899
