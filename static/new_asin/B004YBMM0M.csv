4498672,5,B004YBMM0M,"The movie includes actors Joe Flannigan (Jason), Brooke White (Sally), and Phylicia Rashad (Dorothy) from The Cosby Show. Even before I watched the movie, I loved the concept of how sometimes our plans don't go according to our wishes, but that doesn't mean those plans can't turn out for the better.

Jason and Sally are living the good life. They are both on the fast track to success in their careers and they share a close and loving marriage.  What happens when Sally's best friend dies and Sally and Jason are named in the will to raise the four children? Add in to the plot the fact that the children were living with their parents doing Peace Corps work in Uganda. Yes, you guessed it - Jason's and Sally's lives will for sure be including a change of plans.

One of my favorite things about this movie is how, while we can make all the plans we want, God ultimately has the map of our lives. Sometimes in our pursuit of living our lives the way we want, we realize how much of a positive impact we can have on the lives of others if only we become reach out to others and put their needs first.  There are many great discussion questions in this movie, including Romans 8:28.

I loved this movie and it contains nothing objectionable. Parents will want to pause it a few times to discuss some of the issues; namely, the tragic death of the parents and how each child chose to cope with that loss. There was only one thing I wished could have been done differently in this movie: one of the boys gets into trouble twice - once for fighting and once for stealing Jason's car. There were no consequences for these actions. We spent some time with our own kids discussing with them that actions do have consequences and how fortunate the boy in the movie was not to have been seriously injured or worse in his decision to make a bad choice.

Other than that, I would highly recommend this movie and I applaud the filmakers for creating movies for the entire family. I have added it to my mom-approved movie listing on my wordpress blog.",1306195200,2,2041,4.429333333333333

4498675,5,B004YBMM0M,"This movie is an excellent choice for those who want to see a truly uplifting movie. The male and female leads handle what life
has dealt them in a responsible and compassionate way, but only after a lot of soul-searching about learning to take on a major
challenge that will greatly affect their current carefree lifestyle. I can't stress enough how wonderful this movie is.",1414368000,,375,4.7846153846153845

4498678,5,B004YBMM0M,"I would recommend that others people watch this movie, especially if they have adopted kids. I love anything that has Joe Flanigan he's one of my favoriite actors.",1402444800,,163,4.857142857142857
4498679,4,B004YBMM0M,heard about this DVD and am pleased I sent for it.  A pretty typical American TV movie but a delightful story.,1395619200,,110,4.238095238095238
4498680,4,B004YBMM0M,I watched it because Joe Flanigan and I enjoyed it. It's a great story of children whose parents died and needed a home. Their caretakers' quiet lives were turned upside by taking in 4 children.,1379116800,,194,4.571428571428571
4498681,5,B004YBMM0M,"I first saw Brooke White in a Hallmark movie called ""Banner 4th of July."" I loved this movie and when I found out that she starred in ""Change of Plans"" I ordered it and watched it. I wasn't surprised to find out that she did an excellent job portraying the roll. This was a very great movie.",1377820800,2,291,4.12280701754386
4498682,2,B004YBMM0M,"I only bought this movie because of Joe Flanagan, but not even his performance could bring this up to an average rating,  Sorry.",1372291200,,128,4.565217391304348
4498683,2,B004YBMM0M,"While the movie isn't very good (in all aspects, with very wooden acting by the adult leads, and some very awkward cinematography), it probably shouldn't be judged too harshly -- they clearly were not aiming for great art.  What really surprised me was the way in which the movie was a marketing vehicle.  They have Walmart products in the family kitchen, and make a shopping trip to a nearby Walmart.  At one point it was announced that the male lead had something to do with NASCAR, and it was obvious that meant a trip to a NASCAR event would take place before the movie was over.  I just had never seen a movie where the product placement was so blatantly and crudely done.",1368835200,4,677,4.479674796747967
4498684,3,B004YBMM0M,"I liked the idea of this movie (and I had no idea Wal-Mart was ever into making movies!) but it was really weak in a lot of places.  The actors were pretty good, especially the kids, but it was like they didn't really get much time to prepare or film, it felt kind of emotionless and rushed.  The sets were very detailed and actually looked lived in-- usually that's a downfall as they look too 'done'.  This could have been a really good movie with a little more...something.  It just missed the mark just a bit.  Was still okay.",1368662400,,530,4.313131313131313
4498685,4,B004YBMM0M,"The music CD that accompanies the movie is worth the price on its own, especially if you buy it used. Foot tapping songs with uplifting lyrics by really talented musicians. Literally every song could be an adult contemporary hit single. The movie is surprising in that Phylicia Rashad (Mrs Cosby on The Cosby Show) comes off as an amateur while Brooke White, a novice actor at least when it comes to TV/film dramas, does a fantastic job. For a couple that never considered having kids and says they don't know anything about how to raise them, the lead actors sure do a terrific job in this story. The movie won't contend for any Oscars, but it's completely family friendly and entertaining. If you want your kids to see what a really good marriage looks like, and how a healthy, happy marriage with kids can be really fulfilling and fun, show them this movie. So getting both the movie and music for this price, it really is a no brainer. Especially if you get the 3 disc combo used.",1358294400,,984,4.533707865168539
4498686,5,B004YBMM0M,"This story is a very heartfelt story.  It starts out with a couple that are enjoying being together and the way their lives are going.  A friend dies and leaves them four children in her will.  How they will respond to the children and what they do about their growing love for them is really what the movie is all about.  The children are great and really teach the adults a lesson in caring.  I think this is one of the very best movies to come along in a long time.  No swearing, no bad situations, not much violence, except the oldest boy gets picked on and teaches the quarterback a lesson (that's minor compared to other movies) and it's just a really nice story.  I am so happy I bought this and will enjoy seeing it again.  Good for children to watch.",1338940800,11,759,4.258741258741258
4498687,5,B004YBMM0M,"I saw this movie on cable and am ordering it on Blu-ray. Brooke White has fascinated me since I saw her on ""American Idol"" where I voted for her! She is wonderful in this film; hmm, can you call movies ""films"" even if they are shot on video?

I look forward to hearing Brooke sing on the bonus disk. Sorry, guys; she's married! Doesn't affect me; so am I . . . for 54 years now.

This is a warm, family oriented picture. I recommend it highly.",1337644800,4,443,4.080459770114943
4498688,4,B004YBMM0M,I have been a big fan of Brooke White since Season 7 of American Idol.  I bought this movie that stars Brooke.  Cute movie!,1332892800,,123,4.083333333333333
4498689,4,B004YBMM0M,"I have been a huge fan of Brooke White long before she hit American Idol. So naturally, the prospect of three unreleased songs was enough of a draw for me to buy this DVD/CD combo. Was it worth it? Totally. The only shocker, her great songs are not even the best tracks on the album.

Imagine if Brooke White hosted a holiday TV special with loads of musical guests - that is what this album feels like.

Michael Johns, Brooke's co-finalist from American Idol shows up twice on the album - first with a solo song that can not be found on his debut album (one of the highlights of this soundtrack), next he shows up as a co-writer on Brooke White's album closing anthem, Let Us Live As One. While Brooke has found a stellar partner in her new duo Jack and White (their Gemini and Winter EPs are amazing), I only hope she and Michael will collaborate again (they have a duet on his album that is spectacular).

I wasn't a huge fan of the movie Change of Plans, but it delivered what it promised: a clean, happy story that can be enjoyed by the entire family. The messages on each of the 12 songs are positive, uplifting and sunny - but they also have a bit more muscle than the movie. If you love the rise from the ashes heartbreak of Adele and Amy Winehouse lyrics, this is the polar opposite. In this world, love triumphs, fairy tale endings happen and the family bond remains strong.

The balance of the songs swing from winning country songs, to light as a feather folk pop and soulful One Republic-esque radio rock. You have to admire even the weakest links because the uplifting message is so strong. I will definitely be looking out for these artists in the years to come.

In the meantime - Jack and White - find those songs, you won't regret it.",1329696000,8,1752,4.361963190184049
4498690,5,B004YBMM0M,"This is a really good family movie, Brook White was an American Idol contestant & now has a good career going for her.  She did very well in this movie, Wal_Mart was for the longest time the only place to get it, we knew that soon Amazon would have it.  Thanks so much Amazon, we've been doing business with you for a long time.

4498691,5,B004YBMM0M,"Another Walmart Family Movie Night that's surprisely good and a great deal to boot with movie, lots of special features, and the the soundtrack included.

A free flying, excitement full, married without children, loving couple suddenly find themselves in charge of four orphans thrust on them from Uganda. The children are close knit, all from different cultures, but dealing with the loss of their parents. The question is whether their new guardians, now fostering them, will keep them and accept the drastic change in their lifestyle and careers or ship them to another family(s) for adoption.

Brooke White, from American Idol, plays the wife, a up and coming musical artist- she's super!  What a great voice, and she can act, too; Joe Flanigan stars as her aero-engineer/pilot; Phylicia Rashad the caring case worker- in the extras, she is hilarious even though her role in the film is serious.

It's all done in good fun and touching drama.  OK for the kids. There's no bad guys.  They do address the loss of the parents, but the movie's emphasis is on the meaning of family and love.

All the kids do a great job, and our children enjoyed watching their bios and exploits and all the music, put together by Randy Jackson, in the extras.

Great family fun.",1313280000,14,1262,4.810185185185185
4498692,5,B004YBMM0M,"A Change of Plans starring Joe Flanigan and Brooke White is a good movie.  Parts of this movie are predictable.  The story is not a new one.  The children are different.  These children are not the usual smart-alecky, bratty, selfish types that populate tv.  They come from different backgrounds and weren't raised on happy meals, ipods, ipads, etc.  This made them refreshing to watch.  The child actors did a very good job of bringing their characters to life.

Brooke White made her acting debut.  She did a wonderful job.  She and Joe came across as a real couple.  This waa a good role for Joe.  It gave him a chance to be more like himself.  Joe is married and has 3 sons.  His character's transition into becoming a parent was realistic.

This movie is not heavy drama or comedy.  It is a good blend of both.  Not too heavy and not too light.  Families can easily enjoy this movie.",1307059200,4,888,4.477987421383648
8448051,1,B004YBMM0M,"I love the movie and saw a version on line but neither the DVD nor Blu-ray will play on ANY of our three computers.  It has some strange copy protection in that not even AnyDVD could get around.  Then I tried HandBrake to try to rip to mp4 but it could not read either disc.  A total waste of money.  BTW, I have 800+ DVDs and Blu-rays and have never seen this particular problem.  I could not get a refund because I live overseas and it arrived long after the cut off.",1519171200,,469,4.054347826086956
