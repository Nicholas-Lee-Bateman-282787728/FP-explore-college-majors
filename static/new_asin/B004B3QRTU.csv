4313385,5,B004B3QRTU,Yogi has the most fascinating biography. Owns the most  World Series championship rings yet he is so humble. I'm buying more copies to give as gifts for my friends.,1422835200,,164,4.655172413793103
4313386,5,B004B3QRTU,"Watch this film about a real living baseball legend.  ""Legend"" is a term that is often used inappropriately these days.  It seems everyone with a uniform and a glove is a ""Legend,"" primarily because of the Commentators' ineloquence and seeming desire to turn every incident into a historical moment.  It's the nature of modern television, but I still cannot understand how a true legend like Yogi is remembered mainly for his comical observations rather than the fact that he enjoyed 21 (YES TWENTY ONE) World Series appearances as a player and manager and the fact that if he wanted to wear all of his rings, he'd need to include three toes (13 wins).  He had 15 All Star appearance and 3 AL MVP awards.  When we label an extremely well-paid but essentially unproven youth as a ""Legend,"" we cheapen the word...dilute it and render it an ineffective description.  Buy this movie about a real legend; you won't be disappointed.",1421971200,2,926,4.7924528301886795

8421499,5,B004B3QRTU,"Yogi Berra: In His Own Words was a great read. He was an icon.  Each and everyone of his quotes is true and factual, no matter how he said it.",1453766400,,142,3.7333333333333334
8421500,5,B004B3QRTU,"We recently lost one of the true good guys of baseball: Yogi Berra. While a fiery, ultra-competitive player on the field, he was at the same time laid-back and easy going. Everyone knows at least a couple ""Yogi-isms,"" malapropisms for which he was famous (e.g., It ain't over 'til it's over), but Casey Stengel referred to him as ""My assistant manager."" That's because of Yogi's ultra-keen baseball intellect. I once read a book that had an appendix outlining how well Yankee pitchers fared under Yogi's guidance, and how poorly those same pitchers did before and after--World Series perfect game pitcher Don Larson is a good example. That same book made a very strong argument for Yogi as the best baseball catcher in history. And Yogi was no slouch with a bat either. While famous for hitting balls out of the strike zone, his strike out rate was exceptionally low. Yogi Berra has a bit of a reputation in some circles for being a buffoon, but that reputation is undeserved. He said plenty of funny things--or just said things funny--but his was a wonderful baseball mind. This video will give anyone a greater appreciation for one of the best baseball players who ever lived. If you like baseball, you'll love this DVS.",1445817600,2,1222,4.796208530805687
