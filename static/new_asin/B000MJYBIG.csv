8225735,3,B000MJYBIG,It has some good info on marriage but you will need more detail dvd.,1410048000,,68,3.9285714285714284
8225736,2,B000MJYBIG,They spend very little time with the older couples. Most of the video is spent listening to young couple who barely know anything about the ups and downs of Marriage life... I've seen more substance on Daytime TV.,1226102400,,213,4.631578947368421
8225737,5,B000MJYBIG,"...makes the medicine go down. Great advice and fun. The big message - its all about remembering what you love about each other and not taking each other for granted. And both people being ""givers"" and not ""takers"". If you both think about the other person first, then you'll both be happy. Great DVD.",1210204800,,301,4.592592592592593
8225738,5,B000MJYBIG,"I am getting married in October.  And my fiance and I have been both experiencing a large amount of stress due to finances, family, jobs, etc.  We were fighting so much that we were questioning whether marriage was the right path to take.  This DVD was so insightful.  It makes you realize how trivial the arguments really are and to get back to the important thing...one another!!!",1206057600,,382,4.656716417910448
8225739,5,B000MJYBIG,Great advice! I hoped the advice of the older couples was going to give me some ideas for my marriage (and they did!!) but I liked hearing the young couples too. I know the ups and downs my girlfriends have gone through with their marriages but hearing these young couples who I don't even know saying the same things I would say was really helpful. That was what got my husband to watch. That there was a fireman talking about his marriage. And God Bless the older couples for sharing what they have done in their marriages.,1205884800,,525,4.422680412371134
8225740,5,B000MJYBIG,I brought this DVD based on the reviews. I got it because my fiancee and I have been getting in the kind of stupid arguments we never used to have. Like about what to spend money on and saving money. I didn't know what I was going to get but it was really helpful and even funny which I didn't expect. The young couples were so HONEST! And the advice from the older couples was the kind of things that seem so obvious and easy after you hear them. This dvd just helped us realize that every couple gets into these kinds of things and there are ways to handle the day to stuff that comes up.,1204329600,4,590,4.051282051282051
8225741,5,B000MJYBIG,"My husband and I were having marriage troubles.  It was getting to the point were we would go days without speaking because I hit the snooze alarm too many times. I never thought I would buy a DVD as a source of help for our troubles, but I took a gamble on this one. I was pleasantly surprised. I loved hearing the advice and stories from the couples that have been married for 50 years or more.  Not only did it make me feel better, it has also improved my marriage. I still have to wake up 3 hours earlier than my husband, but now we can talk about our troubles in a more proactive way.  There are so many heartfelt stories and useful strategies throughout the DVD that you will not be disappointed.",1202860800,,702,4.223880597014926
8225742,5,B000MJYBIG,Picking-out the perfect gift for your pals getting married is tough. This will make your job easier. Funny. Wise. Touching. My friends loved it.,1171411200,,144,5.041666666666667
8225743,5,B000MJYBIG,"I bought this DVD at my friend's recommendation and never intended to show it to my husband.  I learned so much about what is really important and essential in a successful marriage that I ended up showing it to my husband who thought it was as great as I did.  The best part is that it's fun, too.  We laughed and even got teary eyed and had fun while remembering what is most important in our lives together. I now think it makes the best engagement or marriage gift.",1171238400,2,469,4.247191011235955
