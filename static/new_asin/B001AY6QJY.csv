3473878,5,B001AY6QJY,"Blame the teachers.  Blame the administrators.  Blame the schools.  Blame the politicians.  Blame everyone except those truly responsible -- the parents and the students (particularly the former).  Only a handful of parents show up for parent-teacher conferences, yet hundreds show up for basketball and football games.  Teachers giving open book final exams.  Something tells me that the 2005 graduating class should have been far smaller than 200 students.  The narrator states, ""This historically black school continues to survive America's treatment of minority education.""  Blame America, too.  The narrator is obviously clueless.  Yet I highly recommend watching this documentary just to serve as an example of sickening excuse making.",1297382400,7,741,5.768518518518518
3473879,4,B001AY6QJY,"I sat down and watched this documentary with my 17 year old nephew.  He now resides with me in Columbia, Maryland (relocated from New York City) and I really wanted him to see and appreciate how fortunate he is to be receiving a  'magnet' quality High School education with an emphasis on family support of and participation in his personal development.  Many of the children shown in the film are very misguided and most of this is a direct result of the shape of the communities in which they reside; They have little say in how they are raised.  The strong children rise above the adversities and move forward in an upward mobile direction, others fall by the wayside.  So sad to watch, yet it is the reality.",1260576000,6,712,4.53125
3473880,5,B001AY6QJY,"I put this on with some hesitation that it might portray troubled public schools in an inaccurate light. It didn't. It was scarily accurate. From 2004-2008, I worked as a special education teacher for a program like Teach for America in Queens. This film conveys exactly what the experience was like for me. It doesn't paint an unrealistically happy picture, nor suggest any solutions to the problems plaguing America's ""failing"" schools. It just tells it like it is. I highly recommend.",1238803200,11,487,5.0246913580246915
3473881,5,B001AY6QJY,"Documentary sets it straight on the effects of the No Child Left Behind program on the inner-city school system; particularly in Baltimore, Maryland.  The documentary gives insight on how so many children slip through the cracks and fall short of life's goals and opportunities in a life that is so full of promises.",1230336000,4,316,4.962264150943396
3473882,5,B001AY6QJY,"I am an assist. Professor at a community college that teaches two introductory education courses.  I used this video as a capstone assignment for the first time this semester - at the end of the second course.  There is a triangulation between NCLB, administration and the student/teachers that takes place in this story. The students had to watch and review it followed by a writing assignment that covered specific open-ended topics.  On their own, they conducted a class discussion that brought out what they had learned in the second multicultural ed. course.  I had excellent results and was very pleased with the critical thinking and problem solving skills that they displayed. I encourage other teacher educators to use this in their classroom to assess student progress.  Be sure that you warn students of the language ahead of time, in the event that there are students that are offended by profanity.  They will still want to watch it, but are not taken off guard by the language.  This gives future teachers a real life experience situation from which they can start formulating their own ideas and viewpoints.",1229385600,7,1122,5.0
3473883,5,B001AY6QJY,"This dvd will make you say wow!!  I was not surprised by the students' responses and concerns about getting an education. I was born, raised, and still live in Murderland (Baltimore, Md).  The reactions and responses by the people in this video are not edited or staged, even though I wish they were.  This is, unfortunately, how life and education is viewed, not just at Douglass, but at a lot, if not all the city schools.  It's always darkest, before the dawn.  I feel bad for saying this, but in Baltimore, its dark, been dark, and the people are so used to the dark, that they have become immune. Not all, but most Baltimoreans would probably run from or doubt the light (the dawn), when it does eventually come.  Please see this documentary, that is all I have to say.",1219276800,4,774,4.492857142857143
3473884,5,B001AY6QJY,"I saw this one day while flipping thru the channels. After watching it I felt as if someone had followed me personally around with a camera at the schools where I worked. I live in New Orleans, but the issues in the school featured in this doc are the EXACT one I and other teachers faced. This is an awesome doc",1214784000,14,312,4.131147540983607
3473885,5,B001AY6QJY,"I watched this right now on HBO. Every parent should watch this documentary. Even if your own kids go to a good school, you SHOULD make it a point to watch this show. Most kids in this documentary, instead of helping us compete against our Chinese and Indian counterparts, are going to be at the mercy of our tethering welfare system.

This documentary spends no time debating the pros/cons of the No Child Left Behind policy. Rather, it focuses on the daily struggles at a one of the many schools that does not make the grade. Some of the scenes will, without a doubt, shock you; embarrass you and might make you want to reach into the your set and choke a couple of those kids.

To Alan and Susan Raymond ... can you please make a PG version of your documentary ? I am sure some parents would like to show this documentary  to their middle-school kids and teach them - how not to go wrong.",1214438400,9,891,4.323353293413174

3473887,3,B001AY6QJY,loved it learned more about the school system of yesterday and today.  Children need to watch this documentary.,1446422400,,111,5.166666666666667

3473889,5,B001AY6QJY,"Really blame the teacher?The kids have no respect. There were several kids who truly gave school their full priority. If parents are not involved and accountable their kids will mirror them. Letting kids graduate not based on merit but to satisfy ""quotas"" is the problem. These kids aren't 6 year olds but many act this way. Great documentary.
Liberals always blame someone but never want to solve the real problem.......accountability.",1445731200,2,436,5.242857142857143

3473892,4,B001AY6QJY,"The movie depicted certain American academic struggles.  Poverty.  There are whole generations of Americans that have been miseducated' and under-educated.  Look at the enthusiasm American and other nation feel toward their athletic heroes.  Our children get the message.  Their education should come with cheers and bravado from the adults, but there is little of that honest energy in the classroom.  Learning made openly fun, passionate and competitive like the debate team competition.  Where is the emotion-focused coach for the classwork?  Look how focused the children were to the athletic coach.  There is a lot we can learn from those team leaders.",1444176000,3,657,5.425742574257426

3473894,5,B001AY6QJY,"Great documentary.  Shows the true inside story of a high school with an (100%?) African-American student body and overwhelmed teachers. The program will destroy your liberal or conservative fantasies about how to fix these schools and bring home the nearly insoluble nature of the problem.  You may not like what the teachers do, but you can understand why they do it.",1441670400,,369,5.032786885245901
3473895,3,B001AY6QJY,Interesting and insightful but could have been edited better to make the information more cohesive and thus send a more powerful message.,1440633600,,137,5.2727272727272725

3473898,5,B001AY6QJY,"Great documentary! Every parent should watch and see the flaws in our educational system. This sheds light on how our teachers are expected to prepare our students, yet they do not have all the tools they need to make this happen.",1439078400,,230,4.634146341463414
3473899,5,B001AY6QJY,"These children are inferior.  It is not their fault but watching the movie, I found myself looking back on my suburban public school education of 1970-1973.  Even then, there were white students accosting me in the halls because I was answering too many questions in the 9th grade science class!  I realized then, that the public schools run at the level of the lower middle students.  The student's attitude problems are much worse than I saw in my public school days.  If you live in such a place as Baltimore, GET out of there if you care about your kids!",1438128000,2,558,4.54

3473902,5,B001AY6QJY,Must see for every future inner city teacher and politician who still believes that school funding should be based on the affluence of the neighborhood - richer schools get more funding and resources - schools in the inner city struggle for books and a way to reward dedicated teachers.,1437091200,,286,4.857142857142857

3473905,4,B001AY6QJY,"These filmmakers have made other excellent school documentaries, be sure to check them out.  This film raises a lot of questions.  Is No Child Left Behind really serving our nations urban schools?  I enjoyed the film, but it was required for the college class I am taking.  I will definitely watch it again.  There are NO special features.  I was disappointed there was no commentary track.",1341014400,,390,4.833333333333333

8280198,4,B001AY6QJY,"The public school system is not there to necessarily educate.
It's main job is to promote conformity ,not unlike the military.
Academics is at times,secondary.

When you see a school telling a student if you just show up,not do any academic school work,just show up ,you will graduate,that pretty much says it all.

This is nothing new and not necessarily a racial thing.

I had a schoolmate that showed me his report card back in 6th grade and all of the grades were failing.

Cut to graduation and there he was marching down the aisles in cap and gown two years ahead of me.

It's called social promotion.

Can't read write or 'rithmatic,but you get a diploma anyway?",1471219200,,669,4.627118644067797
8280199,5,B001AY6QJY,I'm a documentary buff and this one was as good as they come. I prefer documentaries like this one that mainly speak for themselves and let the cameras roll. I liked that we were shown the points of view of both students and staff as well.,1458604800,,239,4.217391304347826
8280200,4,B001AY6QJY,"Documentary is very well done. I taught in a Lis Angeles inner city school in the community of Watts and I could totally relate to the pressures of the admin, frustrations of the teachers, and the nonchalance of many students. This documentary was very transparent and did not sugar-coat the realities of meeting the often unrealistic benchmarks set by NCLB on schools with little support and minimal resources.",1453507200,,411,5.0588235294117645
8280201,5,B001AY6QJY,"If you think this is an anomaly, think again. Here is a first hand look at urban schools and education. Sadly a few years after filming one of the students will be dead.

As a follow-up, I looked to see how Douglass High was faring today, sadly it has been turned into a magnet school so no longer takes all children from the neighborhood.

This documentary really needs a ""where are they now"" of both students and staff.",1453248000,2,421,4.384615384615385
8280202,4,B001AY6QJY,"Very interesting, but TRUE account of our PATHETIC ATTITUDE of inner city youth",1450051200,2,79,5.153846153846154
8280203,5,B001AY6QJY,"I was surprised by this movie, it really looked at the culture, family's and neighborhoods around the children who are succeeding and those who are not as well as what the teachers, schools, administrators and government can and need to do rather then just looking at "" bad"" kids",1449100800,,279,4.714285714285714
