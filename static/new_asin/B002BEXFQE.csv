8361142,3,B002BEXFQE,"I'm being generous with 3 stars. Even by B-western standards, this one is just too much. The ridiculous chance meetings, Keene displaying his intellect by attempting to explain the rudimentary ""listening device"" to the sheriff, ""You put this thing near what you want to hear, then run this wire to this doohickey and...,"" as well as the predictable-as-sunrise monkey gags, but what totally ruined the movie was the ending. SPOILER ALERT*** (as if that were even possible) the girl's brother is dead for minutes, leaving her alone to fend for herself and Keene says, ""And always remember, keep smiling.""  No thanks Tom, I'll just keep passing by your films from now on.",1508889600,,668,4.964285714285714

8361145,4,B002BEXFQE,"I am a big Tom Keene fan, so I like this.  but it is really just an old oater.  But, it does have the Ed Wood TV pilot on it, which, for me, makes it double exciting.  If you like Tom or Ed, buy it.",1298764800,,198,3.3555555555555556
8361146,4,B002BEXFQE,"I bought this DVD being an Ed Wood fan, but also I love the old 50's westerns. Both of these films have your standard plot, so your not getting anything that new, but it's nice to look back on a simpler time.",1274659200,2,208,3.9761904761904763
8361147,5,B002BEXFQE,"I hope you have a bottle of Viagra handy. OK, I did not even watch Western Mail. I ain't all that into westerns in the first place, the only reason I bought the DVD was to watch Crossroad Avenger. And the only reason I wanted to watch Crossroad Avenger is because it was written and directed by Ed Wood VERY early in his career.

The plot was really stock, off the shelf stuff. Bad guy kills the sheriff and trys to frame the good guy. Good guy kills bad guy and is vindicated, ect, ect. Yawn. At least there was no damsel in distress, which would have REALLY been hackneyed. But then this was one of Wood's first film efforts, and probably played a part in landing him permanently on Poverty Row.

OK, there was some good to it. Starring notable cowboy actor Tom Keene, backed up by the omnipresent Lyle Talbot and Captain Marvel himself Tom Tyler, this short flick did have some starpower, even if they were getting a bit long in the tooth. And B-movie star Don Nagle began his long and unstoried association with Wood in this film. Wood himself even had a few seconds in front of the camera. The rest of the actors, to use the term loosely, were nobodies who could not act their way out of a paper bag.

Buy it if you are a real fan of Ed Wood and want to say you have seen it. Otherwise, unless you are a Tom Keene fan and want to see Western Mail, pass. I gave it 5 stars, but it really only deserves two, maybe three max.

P.S. Amazon has released The Sinster Urge on DVD-R burned to order. It sounds very Woodsian and is probably also worth a watch.",1260230400,3,1556,4.2114093959731544
