8715670,4,B00DFME13M,"This is excellent documentary on the aftermath of the 1957 crisis over racial integration in Little Rock, Arkansas. In the wake of the closing of the Little Rock public schools, a gallant band of local women joined forces against tremendous odds to fight for education in the Arkansas capital. The film has some excellent interviews with participants, many of whom are now deceased. Well worth a viewing.",1498521600,,404,5.044776119402985
