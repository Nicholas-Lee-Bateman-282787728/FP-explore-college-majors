8654428,5,B00JXBLJMK,"This is a fun, if a bit far fetched, romp telling the story of a friendship between Shinobu, a everything English / Blond obsessed Japanese Girl, and Alice, her everything Japanese obsessed Blond English Friend.  The fun comes from the two girls cultures mixing together and how they eventually drag their other friends into this situation.  For a native English speaker it's fun to hear the Japanese version of good English, it's almost eerie in it's perfection and sounds nothing like any of the natives of Britain that I've ever know. Still it's a good show with a lot of smiles and laughs to be had.  A second season is coming.",1413158400,16,631,4.666666666666667
