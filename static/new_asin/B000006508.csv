Fans of the castmembers (especially Billy Dee Williams, Michael Ironside and lead star Powers Boothe in a rare anti-hero/good guy role) as well as TV-to-big screen film producer/director Mimi Ledar (ER, The Peacemaker, Deep Impact, Pay It Forward) might be in for a treat and the film plays off as a uncanny type take on the Punisher comic book with a bit of the same tropes you find in every other 48 Hrs./Lethal Weapon type knock-off.

The music and atmosphere bring up memories of similar telefilms such as 1985's Badge of the Assassin and 1993's Father & Son (the Louis Gossett Jr. telefilm) as well as the popular PM Entertainment Group's Robert Patrick revenge film Zero Tolerance. While there is some sloppily edited slow-motion sequences, other out of place music and some much needed trimming in the second half of the film, this is an overall welcome movie to watch late at night before hitting the sack.

For the parental guidance crowd, there's some mild language, sensuality and brief gunfights at the end making it okay for the 15-year-old crowds at the very least being a TV movie that was likely aired later in the evening back in it's day.",1457740800,,1352,4.748936170212766
