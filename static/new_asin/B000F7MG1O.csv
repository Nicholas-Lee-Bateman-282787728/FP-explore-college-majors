2554494,5,B000F7MG1O,"Crochet Fashions in Motion exceeded my expectations.  I've been slowly building my knitting/crochet DVD collection and Crochet Fashions in Motion is definitely at the top.  You'll be amazed at how fast you pick up some of the more challenging projects.  I made a cropped cardigan and a pair of fingerless gloves in not time at all.  The Reference Guide in this DVD is invaluable because it has a complete library of abbreviations, terms, tools and more.  Whether you are a beginner or experienced, this DVD is a must have for anyone that loves to knit&crochet.  Go and buy this DVD now!",1158883200,6,586,4.752475247524752
2554495,5,B000F7MG1O,"The Crochet Fashions in Motion DVD is awesome!!

There are seven hip patterns with fabulous step-by-step instructions on how to make them. The stitches are shown so close and clear, it felt like I had a private tutor.

The barrel bag is so cool!! I made a few in different sizes with different yarns and everyone who sees them is so impressed I made them myself. I love the idea of using the barrel bag as a gift basket. Put a bottle of wine in it and you have a neat hostess gift. The fashion show on the DVD shows different variations of the patterns and it makes you feel like a designer.

There's an A-Z index that really rocks. Instead of going back and forth to menus and pages, this is a speedy way to go right to the section you want to see. It's all explained in detail in the Overview, Introduction section. I even liked the music for the fashion show! Excellent DVD and I know all of you crocheters out there will enjoy it.",1154563200,10,934,4.235955056179775

8118759,5,B000F7MG1O,What can I say...this dvd is great!!! It has everything you need to start crocheting as a beginner and challenging projects for experienced crocheters as well.
