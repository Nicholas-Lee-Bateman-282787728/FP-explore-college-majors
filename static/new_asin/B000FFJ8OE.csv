8121792,5,B000FFJ8OE,This was the final volume of the first season.  The interaction between the characters showed how much they had changed and how much they had stayed the same.  Yozak was still teasing everyone but his respect and belief in Yuri was obvious in his need to protect Yuri's feelings.  Wolfram started to grow up but still jumped to conclusions too quickly.  Gunter's more serious nature was shown and the power that he never uses was highlighted.  The biggest changes are the ones in Conrad and Yuri.  Yuri's decision to trust Conrad even though he has questions shows his inner strength and the ability to not blindly believe what other tell him.  Conrad's confession about Yuri's true strength and what it truly means proved that he had finally begun healing from the pain of Julia's death.  I am anxiously awaiting the second season that starts to be released in November.,1162598400,3,871,4.798657718120805
