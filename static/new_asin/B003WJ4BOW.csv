8407347,4,B003WJ4BOW,"I'd seen most of the footage ( and even own other titles with pretty much the same scenes).  But, as usual, there were little bits of info I hadn't heard before.  It's ok.",1312848000,3,171,4.151515151515151
8407348,5,B003WJ4BOW,"These are the first films that I have ever seen, and I have watched most all, that truly depict the horrors and unspeakable atrocities committed by man upon his fellow humans.  Unedited and not retouched, these films by the War Department are probably the most graphic and disturbing available for public release.  Fortunately the film has not be remastered and may have been unwatchable if they had, except for those truly sick in the head.  And yet there are those out there that still say the holocaust did not happen and those that wish the Final Solution had succeeded and will attempt it again.

Purchase this dvd and let others watch it with you, think about what you see, discuss it but never forget.",1304294400,9,708,4.685483870967742
8407349,5,B003WJ4BOW,"These historic films of what was found by the Allies when the Nazi Concentration camps were liberated is difficult and disturbing to watch, and yet every aduld should. This is a testament to all mankind how horrible things can get when evil tyranny is allowed to go unchecked, when a group is singled out as a target by a society in economic turmoil. Both Death Mills and Nazi Concentration camps so raw, unvarnished footage, the start scenes of the mass graves, the piles of shrunken corpses, the gas chambers. If difficult, it is also spellbinding in a very dark way, not unlike rubbernecking at a bad auto accident. It is a fascinating topic, how not very long ago a major industrial modern European country could revert so completely to the most barbaric crimes on such a large scale. Yet these films, as disturbing as they are, only hint at the unimaginable suffering and horror of millions. Let the truth and story, no matter how unpleasant be told so that we may learn.",1279929600,11,976,4.680232558139535
