7004826,2,B00TEC7H9M,"After two good seasons, this show goes off the deep end in absurdity leading to cheesiness.  There are 3 (really) good episodes here and some really bad ones.  Banshee has always been best when it is not going over-the-top on action (think season finale of Season 1 and last 2 episodes of Season 2) and instead focusing on one-on-one fights/battles.  If you like the over-the-top episodes in the previous seasons, you will like this season.  Unfortunately, I did not.",1430784000,10,467,4.8734177215189876

7004829,5,B00TEC7H9M,"The first two seasons of ""Banshee""  blew me away!

""Banshee"" is my favorite show on cable/television.

For those of you that don't know why, may I suggest you either (a) check it out online or (b) buy the DVD's
and become one of the legion of followers that enjoy (or obsess over) this show!

For those of you already in the legion (like me), the Third Season of Banshee has left me speechless!

I know I've said it before, but WHERE can this show go, next????

Seasons (1), (2) and (3) of this amazing show are most recommended!

Five Stars!

7004855,2,B00TEC7H9M,"There are spoilers here. I have no idea how this show got so many great reviews.  This is a typical show, like Sons of Anarchy, where the White characters are so much smarter, and tougher, than every minority that they are either working with or against.  I also hated the entire ""Job in captivity"", the aftermath, story line.  I find it strange, that so many people gave this show 5 stars, despite the incest between two main characters, when the age difference alone would have been bad enough. There is also the  many women getting beaten like they're men by men throughout the series. It's amazing, that Carrie was even able to have children, considering all the body blows she sustained.  I know you have to suspend belief when you watch television, but still it was just dumb that there were so many attractive, promiscuous, and lethal women under 35 in this one small town.  Even on Cinemax, that's a stretch.  The only women that didn't have all of those characteristics, were either Amish (with one exception) or Black Americans (of course, otherwise they'd have to explain their immunity to the Hood sexual magnetism).  What really sucked about this show was how selfish the character Hood was. Not only did he ruin Carrie's marriage (with her help), but every bad thing that happened to any of the good people or the town itself, was his fault.  It was funny, that Carrie's husband was such a bad ass, on the day he died, but there was no explanation for how he suddenly knew martial arts or was an expert marksman. I really didn't like Hood taking Deva (bad actress) out of jail, when her dad was trying to teach her a lesson Or Hood teaching her how to avoid getting caught when committing crimes.  Sure, he was the main character, but he was just such a useless individual, I got to the point where I really couldn't stand him. I was glad that there were fewer sex scenes in this season. Their frequency, and graphic depictions, made the other seasons hard to watch.",1487462400,,1980,4.599431818181818

7004864,5,B00TEC7H9M,"To put it bluntly, I was amazed!  Note that I do have cable TV but that I do not subscribe to the titty channels, so that the relatively infrequent nudity and just-below X-rated sex was a delightful surprise, as were the frequent F-bombs that occurred exactly when expected (as they would in a more or less real-life situation, depending on your personal experiences).  My partner was offended by the language (and the sex) so I had to watch this all alone but that didn't mean I enjoyed it any less.

You can get the plot anywhere (Wiki is a good place to start) so I'll not go into that.  What I will HIGHLY recommend is watching each season's BANSHEE ORIGINS set of clips so you can get a heads up on what you're about to see without having to figure it out piecemeal from the episodes themselves.  Note that this is absolutely necessary at the beginning of season four, where a lapse of 18-months has occurred.

The clips were scripted and shot separately from the episodes themselves, as explained by the producers on the commentary audio.  I had originally thought that they were outtakes or sections that were cut for time purposes but that was not the case.  THEY DO EXPLAIN A BUNCH OF STUFF!

I can say that each season opens with a whole new set of problems and a bunch of characters whom the writers were not afraid of killing off just to torment the survivors and shock the audience.

To save time and effort, this same review will be posted for seasons 2 through 4 (the last season of the series).",1483833600,,1510,4.478102189781022

7004884,5,B00TEC7H9M,"No complaints with the show itself.  This season features two brutally realistic fights and a number of interesting new characters.  My only complaint is that in the Episode 1 Commentary there are spoilers of two different deaths of characters later in the season.  There is even less reason to believe that people buying a series on DVD that comes from a premium cable show have seen the entire season on TV than shows from network TV.  I usually like to watch everything on a disc at one time, while the episodes are still fresh in my mind, so foretelling future plot points and character deaths in an early commentary is extremely annoying.  It's called drama people!  Let the story develop!  Since the season is only 10 episodes, the best way to watch it and the commentaries, is to watch all the episodes and then go back and watch the commentaries.  Yes, I do like the commentaries, but a comprehensive commentary discussing the specifics of the entire season goes on the last episode of a season, not the first.",1477008000,,1018,4.679775280898877

But when action comes it looks staged for 13 year-olds, with guns blazing from both hands, flying karate kicks, etc.  Physical altercation in drama requires a modicum of realism, or you veer into comic book land.

Also, Death scenes seem scripted from soap opera.  It seems as if the director and producers want to play to opposing groups: thinking folks, the blind action crowd, and on occasion the weepers.

Overall not bad but with indigestible parts.",1461715200,,532,5.1395348837209305

7005002,5,B00TEC7H9M,"++++Warning, there will be spoilers from the prior seasons, and hints, but no big giveaways from season 3 ++++++

This season of Banshee can be described by the old saying, the chickens coming home to roost.  It is really all about the consequences of Lucas's continued impersonation of the sheriff, and Lucas/Carrie/Job/Sugar's continued heists.  Both of those lead to major deaths during the season.  This season also brings the Cheyton Littlestone story arc to an end.  Not before he wreaks a ton of havoc.  The other big story arcs are for Kai Proctor and Rebecca.  She is becoming more and more of a bad guy, and he is balancing his life of crime with caring for his ailing mother.  Of course Kai and Lucas cross paths at times, and the show is definitely working toward a final showdown between the two.

There is also the introduction of a new character, an ex Neo Nazi named Bunker, whose past is following him, and while providing for a couple great moments this season is also setting up what looks to be a large story arc in the final season.  We also get more glimpses into Lucas's past, getting to see not only how he and Job first met, but we get to see the origin of a very young Lucas.  There is also a great episode that is kind of a ""what if"" showing what would have happened had the real Lucas Hood never died.

For those who get the discs, the show looks and sounds great on blu-ray.  For extras there are commentary tracks on many, but not all of the episodes.  If you listen to the commentaries I suggest watching the entire season first (if you did not already watch it when it aired) because they spoil two major deaths in the commentary to episode 1.  So if you are one that would get all upset about knowing someone dies ahead of time them wait to listen to those.  There are also a couple Banshee Origins episodes (just under an hour's worth of material) that used the flashback clips from the prior seasons along with new footage that was shot that led up to the moment Lucas was released from prison.  There are also deleted scenes, zoomed in features that break down different scenes throughout the season, and a feature on the Camp Genoa heist, and the subsequent raid in the season finale.  All in all, a ton of material for those who like going through the extras.

By now most know what the show is.  It is very violent (sometimes comically so), and has a lot of sex.  Although I think in seasons 2 and 3 the sex was toned down quite a bit from season 1.  There are very few bright line, good and evil characters.  Most of them straddle the line between good and bad, and is makes for a much better and more complex show.  While I do not think the season was as good as seasons 1 and 2, I do think it was done well enough to be one of the best Premium Cable shows, despite not having the widespread popularity of something like Game Of Thrones.  It continues to have great writing and acting, and it sets up what looks to be a good end to the story.",1459641600,7,2983,4.331531531531532

7005004,4,B00TEC7H9M,"The continuing fictional tale of the most violent and corrupt back-water town in the U.S - 'Banshee' where.
a former con has assumed the role of Sheriff in place of 'Lucas Hood' who had been killed
The assumed to be 'Lucas Hood' (Antony Starr) though in most cases does the right thing has a very unorthodox
method of administering justice.
By taking up the post 'Lucas' had upset 'Deputy Brock Lotus' (Matt Servitto) who had hoped the post would be his,
and finds 'Lucas's' method of dealing with things alien to his own understanding of procedure.
Initially 'Lucas' had come to town after spending 15 years in prison to find his once-lover and criminal accomplice
now living under a different name 'Carrie' (Ivana Milicevic) and married to 'Gordon Hopewell' (Rus Blackwell)
The two have a troubled teen daughter 'Deva' (Ryann Shane) who is in fact 'Lucas's' child in truth....
Wherever 'Lucas' is trouble always follows, out of town gangsters always seem to have issue with him, as does local
businessman/ gangster 'Kai Proctor' (Ulrich Thomsen) who has until 'Lucas' arrived on the scene had his own way
untroubled by the police department, alongside him his trusted and brutal assistant 'Clay Burton' (Matthew Rauch)
'Kai' has also decided to train-up his enthusiastic if but over confident niece 'Rebecca' (Lili Simmons) into the business.
Trouble also brews at the local Indian Reservation where 'Clayton Littlestone' (Geno Segers) has stirred up the potential
warriors to join him in the fight against their white neighbours, a fight that will bring personal tragedy to 'Lucas'
As if these goings-on wern't enough to handle, 'Lucas' has caught sight of an unusual amount of money held at the local
military base and enlists friend 'Job' (Hoon Lee) a computer-hacker of some renown, landlord and ex-fighter'Sugar Bates'
(Frankie Faison) and former accomplice 'Carrie' to attempt the risky heist......but will they be taking on more than they
can handle ?
Another exciting if but over-the-top 10 episode series with it's usual mix of graphic violence / torture sequences, scenes of an adult nature and a almost constant barrage of colourful language.
A series, again worthy of a viewing.

7005008,5,B00TEC7H9M,THEY KILLED DEPUTY HOTTIE!!! There were some bumps  in the road with this season but just when you though there wouldn't be any more OMG moments the spring several on you. The cliffhanger regarding Job has me on the edge of my chair. Here you have some characters on the edge. With Procter losing his mother you think that his Amish upbringing will gain more control over his actions only to have him pushed into a darker area. The change with Rebecca while not surprising will be an interesting storyline. I suspect that either by the end of this season or the beginning of Season 5 (if there is one) she'll feel her oats and will try to betray Procter. To me the most interesting sub plot is with Dava. Here is a person who has a good heart but is way too close to the flames for her own good. We shall see how things between Carrie and Hood will develop.,1436572800,3,857,4.290123456790123
