4246171,3,B0041LULM6,"I saw this film on an import DVD some time ago (it's actually from 2006, just now getting a U.S. release), and it's actually a pretty decent little thriller.

  Fans of Harvey Keitel and/or Norman Reedus will probably enjoy their performances here. Keitel is actually pretty creepy here.

 Film has a nice, noirish-type look and feel, and there are some genuinely tense moments. Story is about a young man whose wife was brutally murdered by a serial killer the cops never found. He is unable to get on with his life due to his obsession with finding the killer. His neighbor is a lonely, awkward young woman who wants to reach him, so she sets up a seemingly innocent cab driver to take the fall so the young guy can ""get on"" with his life, and be open to her. Naturally, things go way, way out of hand. All the characters are pretty unlikable, but the story certainly has some originality, and there are some good twists.

 Only a totally unbelievable final twist nearly ruins everything (just so the story can be tied up neatly at the end). All in all, a watchable, pulpy little indie thriller.

  The director, Manuel Pradal, has worked with Keitel before, on ""Ginostra"".",1289692800,7,1175,4.605769230769231
4246172,1,B0041LULM6,"The original movie is 103 minutes. (when converted to NTSC it should be 108 minutes approximately.
This edition is 98 minutes. So beware of this when ordering.
Its hard to understand why these films are cut. Are we really this immature?",1284249600,2,236,4.780487804878049

4246175,4,B0041LULM6,"Love the acting, not too keen on the story.  Why would a cabbie murder the fare he just drove home?  Kind of bad for business.  What the other characters do was interesting to watch, however, as the windower and his neighbor run their own agendas and the right things happen for the wrong reasons.  A psychological thriller.",1423440000,,324,4.631578947368421
4246176,5,B0041LULM6,Harvey keitel is one of my favorite actors for action movies.  This was a very action based movie with a lot of plot.  I enjoyed the movie til the very end.  Great!,1421539200,,164,4.0625

4246178,4,B0041LULM6,Nothing to write home about but worth a look. I enjoyed the film I watch any Harvey keitel movie and am becoming a Norman Reed us fan. Worth a look but not outstanding,1402012800,,167,4.090909090909091
4246179,3,B0041LULM6,"Wanted to see Reedus in roles outside of Walking Dead.  The story itself has holes that keep it from being really good.  What was the basis for Ashley's murder?  There must've been some motivation but it's never addressed.  It seems Vincent finds Alice mostly irritating but once the murder mystery is ""solved"" he just slips into a relationship with her.  It's like a switch flipped somewhere and it's not realistic. The attack on Roger and his subsequent return from that ordeal is somewhat unbelievable.  Roger's character is very vague. Is he crazy?  A recovering alcoholic? Both? Victim/Predator? Is Vincent aware of Alice's involvement in all of this? Interesting twist at the end but the holes int he plot make for a mediocre resolution. Alice is very unbalanced and Vincent doesn't seem like the type to fall for that kind of girl.  Acting overall is good, Keitel is great. Very slow first half, picks up later.",1400198400,,918,4.877419354838709

4246181,4,B0041LULM6,This is a dark and seamy crime drama. Set in the darker crevices New York city this yarn explores the behavior of some odd people who cross each others paths with some extreme consequences. Not to be seen if one is in a black mood.,1390521600,,231,4.155555555555556

4246184,5,B0041LULM6,I thought that the character Alice was deeply flawed....but than again we are all human & flawed. I lik Noramn Reedus & to tell you the truth that is why I bought this movie. It is worth it to see him. He looks sooo handsome and he is a great actor.,1373068800,,249,3.9019607843137254

4246187,2,B0041LULM6,Strange and more about the crazy obsessed girl than the actual story. Frames a guy for killing her neighbor's wife so that she can get his attention. Too many nude scenes between her and the crazy guy. Just weird.,1360108800,,213,4.487179487179487
4246188,4,B0041LULM6,I loved it. I love Norman Reedus and he is so good in this movie. I especially loved the ending.,1358294400,,96,3.85
4246189,4,B0041LULM6,"Harvey Keitel and Norman Reedus give great performances as they usually do and if you like them, you'll enjoy this movie. Reedus plays Vincent, who can't continue his life until he finds his wife's murderer. Keitel, a cabbie, is a victim who unwittingly becomes a part of Vincent's madness. The ""crime"" committed is a pretty good one in theory, but like most crimes it's not perfect. A Crime keeps you guessing, even if it moves kind of slow for a thriller.  Emanuelle Beart, who plays Vincent's new girlfriend Alice, annoys me to no end in this film - I don't know that she is SUPPOSED to or what. I've watched A Crime a few times and liked it better each time ... but again, I have to say, Beart's Alice is an unlikeable, shallow, conniving bitch who almost makes me want to stop watching yet there I am up to the end as if something will change. I mention this because her role is integral in this whole 'crime'. I still don't know if this is just good acting on her part or if I just personally find her/Alice despicable (LOL).",1321056000,17,1031,4.397905759162303
4246190,5,B0041LULM6,"A Crime is a fantastic movie and was well worth the buy. The delivery was prompt and everything was perfect, no dents, no breaks or cracks...flawless. Thanks for making my nights a little brighter viewing wise!",1301270400,4,210,4.861111111111111
4246191,4,B0041LULM6,"This crime story has a rather unbelievable, but nevertheless compelling premise. When a man's wife is killed by gunfire coming from what he glimpses as a passing taxi driver - the man finds it impossible to move on with his life. He dwells on the sheer inexplicability of the unsolved murder. Another young woman aspiring to have a relationship with the anguished man decides to shake him out of his entrenched grief by pinning the murder on someone - anyone. She picks a working cab driver at random and proceeds to frame him for the murder. In order to maneuver the driver into the appearance of guilt, she has to get close to him. And so starts a vaguely surreal, down-and-dirty romance with the cab driver.

Yes, this plot is resting on very shaky psychological ground and proceeds from one improbability to another. It also seems to be the product of an uneasy American-French collaboration. The action is supposed to be taking place in the U.S. and stars American actor Harvey Keitel, but I think I glimpsed the Eiffel Tower in the background as the cab driver and his new paramour are presumably skimming away from something like the Verrazano Bridge.

Despite these lapses, I found myself getting drawn into the off-beat atmosphere of this film. It has a certain French New Wave quality about it, featuring people wandering in the purple estrangement of urban settings. What's more, Harvey Keitel has a grungy masculine appeal that becomes more memorable the farther I move away from having viewed ""The Crime."" There's also the novelty of a boomerang playing a featured role in the film, ready to come back and hit you with any number of different morals to the story.",1299628800,,1676,4.795847750865052
4246192,4,B0041LULM6,"I rented this because I saw that Harvey Keitel is in it. I didn't think it was going to be very good but to my surprise, it was actually good.

  The movie starts out where a man's wife is grossly murdered. They never find the killer and he becomes obsessed with it, checking out almost with other relationships. He is neighbors with a beautiful woman who is in love with him. She tries taking him out and such but he is so obsessed with the murder of his wife that he ignores her. She thinks up of a plan to frame a cab driver (Harvey Keitel) for the murder so she can go out with the guy. And the story goes on from there......

 It is very original, it has a good twist in the ending",1292716800,,686,4.014705882352941

8413041,4,B0041LULM6,"Moody and convoluted film noir. Emmanuelle Beart does a seamless transition from being a Parisian high class actress  to a New York low life who speaks  perfect American English. What can't seem to be understood is why such a beautiful woman like her would be so in love with some guy who doesn't seem to offer her a thing. The mysteries of the heart?  I always thought film noir as a genre was more about cynicism and realism. What Beart does here for some guy she loves doesn't seem realistic just crazy romantic. This film,however, is not a light romance at all. You'd probably have to see it at least twice to get the plot nuances  and even then it might not really make any sense which is kind of a let down. The acting from everyone is superlative.",1465430400,,754,4.402877697841727
