Both movies are on the same side of a single disc, which is makes life a lot easier. These stories are cute, fun, and appropriate for the entire family.",1383609600,,267,4.469387755102041
8247814,5,B0012UEF8U,"I love these dvd. I am a Sabrina fan and wanted to have the movie, i found these bargain with thee 2 pack movie and I really glad I choose these over the single release of Sabrina.

Sabrina is off to Witch Academy and Sabrina has a secret that makes her fear she'll never be accepted at her new school... or in life. She's half-witch and half-mortal. Now, Sabrina has to prove to her teachers, classmates, family and most importantly, to herself that she belongs.

The Sabrina's voice was so adorable, I really love her voice.

The extras are only from the Groove Squad movie:
-Bloopers
-Pencil test, which show you how the movie is done all in pencil before adding color and sound effects
-Fun Facts with inspector Gadget, really interesting bits
-Previews, short previews of a lot of movies

The video quality is great, both movies are in the same side of the disc which is a dual layer dvd and there is spanish audio for both movies too.",1379376000,,940,4.47953216374269
