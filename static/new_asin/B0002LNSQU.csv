8028929,5,B0002LNSQU,"This is an older video with some scenes from Duckmen 5 and also from Mexico hunts.  I paid less than $5 delivered.  The video is about 45 minutes long.  Great video for my money.  I really enjoy watching some of these older videos when Jase was younger and had short hair.  Everybody else looks pretty much the same.  I think it was shot in 2000-2001.  As a side note, I have been watching Duck Dynasty religiously.  It's a great show if you like the Robertson clan.",1336348800,6,466,4.337209302325581
