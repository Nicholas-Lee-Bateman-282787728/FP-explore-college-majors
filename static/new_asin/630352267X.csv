683146,1,630352267X,"Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bomb is even worse than the movie that preceded it (Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine).  I'm not sure what is worse, the poorly dubbed dialog of the two foreign comedians or the portion where the characters are moving their lips but only music can be heard.  I appreciate good satire but this is humorless confusion in need of a script.  It is any wonder that another sequel was not made?",1127088000,,416,4.447368421052632
7850418,1,630352267X,"Don't let the names Vincent Price and Mario Bava draw you towards this film; it may very well be the worst film in the history of cinema. I seriously can't remember a more excruciating experience in front of the television. I went in thinking: AIP Beach Party/60's spy spoof/Vincent Price being goofy (i.e. Egghead). The bar for entertainment was set pretty low from the get-go and it couldn't even meet that low expectation level. All the filmmakers had to do was dish out something on par with your standard episodes of ""Get Smart"" or ""I Dream of Jeannie"" and they still failed miserably. The two Italian comedians featured in this film would be lynched for crimes against the art of humor in any just society.",1494288000,,712,4.704

7850421,4,630352267X,"One of many movies that Vincent  Price does a mixed of action, horror with comedy.  Here he is as a mad scienrist, to conquer the world. By creating lovely but deadly sophisticated robots ( today terms a android ) that looks , sounds, acts like real girls. But a deadly purpose. To tell you who, or why. Would spoil the basic plot.",1463961600,,331,4.32258064516129

7850424,1,630352267X,"Like Fellini on bad acid, how did this movie ever get made.  Don't get me wrong, I'm glad it did.  It's worth the price for the two doofus Italian Abbot and Costello comedy routine alone.  Just awful, and well worth the money for it.",1398038400,2,233,4.25
7850425,3,630352267X,"...is better than either of the two ""Dr. Goldfoot"" movies.

""Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine"" (1965) and ""Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs"" (1966) are spoofs of the early James Bond flicks and, to a lesser degree, the early 60's beach movies with Avalon & Funicello (mainly because Frankie stars in the first one and it shares the harmless, fun-spirited flare of the beach flicks). They're innocuous mid-60's slapstick comedies in the style of ""I Dream of Jeanie"", but extended to a full movie. Their main attraction can be found in their titles -- the 60's bikini-clad babes and Vincent price in the title role. Since I love both (and ""I Dream of Jeanie"") I figured I'd like these movies way more than I did, but I found them pretty forgettable, not to mention lame. Yes, I know, they're supposed to be lame, but there's good lame and bad lame and the two Dr. Goldfoot movies are mediocre lame, verging on bad.

The first movie takes place in San Francisco and the second one in Rome. These locations are highlights in addition to those already mentioned. These movies are also enjoyable as period-pieces as it's interesting to see the mid-60's styles, etc.

As far as the women go, I was a little disappointed with the first one in this respect; the second one is much better, not to mention it was directed by Mario Bava (which many insist is his worst film, lol).

At the end of the day, the Dr. Goldfoot movies are throwaway flicks, but they're worth catching for the highlights noted above, if you're in the right frame of mind.

The first movie runs 88 minutes and the second one 82 minutes.

7850427,1,630352267X,To those looking to buy this heed warning. This isn't a very good movie at all. Its just plain drab and not very entertaining. The first movie the bikini machine is great to watch. Its up to you but I wouldn't buy it. I returned mine and got my money back.,1378944000,2,256,4.03921568627451
