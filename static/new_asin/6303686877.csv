703112,5,6303686877,"I think this movie was extremely good. Great acting by Annabeth Gish and Jon Voight. Having this movie be Annabeth's first big screen. About a troubled father who got hurt in the war and abuses his oldest step-daughter. A compeling story of protecting yourself, and love, and betraying the people you love.",1026172800,3,306,4.903846153846154
703113,5,6303686877,Jon Voight is the stepfather with a drinking problem and a bad temper. Annabeth Gish plays his oldest stepdaughter who wants very much to be accepted by him. He is constantly badgering them about the A-bomb tests about to commence in the desert near Las Vegas. I just saw this movie on HBO.,988934400,,290,4.490566037735849
703114,4,6303686877,This is a very good movie about growing up in a disfunctional family. It shows that things can happen and that hope was not given up. Annabeth gish shows early on in her career that she will become a great actress. Also stars Ellen Barkin as her drunken down-on-luck aunt. Also see Radio Flyer.

703326,5,6303686877,"""Desert Bloom"" (1986) is an excellent and underrated coming-of-age drama about a semi-dysfunctional family living in Las Vegas in the early 50s. The military is conducting atomic bomb testing nearby. The story mostly focuses on 13 year-old Rose (Annabeth Gish) who struggles with her relationship with her stepfather, Jack (Jon Voight). Jack suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and alcoholism. Her mother, Lily (JoBeth Williams), is the pillar of the family that keeps them together and hopeful. When Lily's sexpot sister, Starr (Ellen Barkin), visits it's both a blessing and a curse.

The film grabbed my attention from the get-go, which is a good sign, and sustained it till the end. The first two acts are solid drama that build up to the more volatile final act.

Most families function satisfactorily from day to day with an undercurrent of some frustration or animosity, which leads to the occasional explosion of emotions. This is what we see in ""Desert Bloom,"" and it's a potent explosion.

The acting is stellar, by the way. Voight's one of the greatest actors in the history of cinema and he's just so believable here. Williams, Barkin and Gish as well.

Roger Ebert inexplicably complained that the film is about two many things, but I never got this feeling for a second. Yes, the story juggles quite a few issues -- coming-of-age, atomic bomb testing, mental disorders, child abuse, alcoholism and inappropriate relations -- but they all gel together in a cohesive whole.

With all these elements the film is rich with gems to mine. Here are three that I'd like to mention:

- The balding, pudgy neighbor who is boldly willing to stand up for Rose.

- The solid mother who keeps her composure at all times, until she catches wind of something sinister. At that point, watch out! (But notice what she does after the emotional explosion).

- The ending's emphasis on repentance, forgiveness and redemption. It's so effective it's a mite tear-inducing.

As far as the dramatic vibe goes, ""Desert Bloom"" is reminiscent of films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jacknife/dp/B0036U6YTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jacknife</a>"" (1989) and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Sky/dp/B0000542C5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Sky</a>"" (1991). It's on par with the former and better than the latter.

The film was shot in Vegas & Tucson and runs 105 minutes.

703327,4,6303686877,"I lived in Nevada during the period depicted in this movie.  I really enjoyed watching it.  If you were intrigued by Nevada in ""The Right Stuff,"" you ought to watch this picture and get another perspective.",1361404800,,206,4.694444444444445
703328,4,6303686877,"This is a sensitive girl's coming of age story during a difficult era.  The gender attitudes are only slightly exaggerated.  I like that the clothes, music, and decor are not oversaturated with the either the most tasteful or most tacky 1950 styles.  It has a heart and sympathy for even the most misguided characters.  WWII vets' fear about nuclear war spread like wildfire.",1342656000,,375,4.904761904761905
703329,4,6303686877,"I thought it was interesting how the movie seemed to show how, while ""proper"" America was trying to look like we have it all together, there is chaos and disintegration going on everywhere; I thought an especially telling scene for that depiction was when Rose was trying to run away, and the stepdad was sitting with his gun looking ready to break down, while proper, respectable-looking people were in the house, playing the piano and singing.
I told my husband that I could swear that the narrator was Christine Lahti; I finally found that that was true on the Internet Movie Database site; it was listed on her movie credits as an uncredited narrator for the movie Desert Bloom.",1291334400,3,682,4.739495798319328
703330,5,6303686877,"If you are a Jon Voight fan, this is a must-see movie. Having grownup in one of America's few functional families, I found it hard to relate to.  However I have watched it with others that were blown away by its mirror image of real life in an abusive household.

I appreciated the film for exercising restraint in the acting and not going over- the-top.  It could have been so easy to do.  This is due to the chemistry and fine acting of the cast.  Different people I watched it with have their favorites. For me, Voight really stands out which is incredible as the entire cast should have won awards.

Don't expect this movie to be light fare on a boring Saturday afternoon.  It will stick with you for awhile. The story builds like a slow burn and will leave some scars.

I hope you find my opinion helpful.

703331,5,6303686877,"A powerful and heartbreaking portrayal of what it is like to walk on egg shells in a household inhabited by an alcoholic husband and father.

The story deftly renders the awkward and secretive moral climate around alcohol, sex, and infidelity in post- WWII America. Unflinching in his lack of sensitivity, John Voight nonetheless succeeds in winning a kind of sad sympathy for his post-combat nightmares and his tortured reality. Jo Beth Williams, Annabeth Gish, and Ellen Barkin give outstandingly moving performances that could only be described as remarkable. John Garfield gives a subtle and important performance in a wonderful supporting roll.

This film was one of those sleepers that came out of left field, and knocked me down! It is a noteworthy American film, tragic, touching, and ultimately triumphant. It is truly unforgettable.",1201564800,3,842,5.323308270676692
703332,5,6303686877,Annabeth Gish gives a great performance as a young girl struggling to understand her life growing up in 1950's Las Vegas.  Her mother is trying to keep their family together through some pretty hard times.  The town is under constant threat of the A-Bomb.  Rose's (Gish) stepfather is an alcoholic struggling with the demons of war.  The story is great and I think many families with veterans can identify.,1175040000,6,406,4.840579710144928
703333,4,6303686877,"Set near Las Vegas in 1950, this is a coming-of-age movie about a 13-year-old girl as she tries to deal with the turbulence in her family in the form mainly of her alcoholic stepfather (Jon Voight). An aunt is living with them for 42 days in order to fulfill the residency requirement to get a quicky divorce. The girl catches Voight and the aunt in an embrace one day, and bolts out. Voight finds her near a nuclear test site. The story is quite intelligent and compelling. The movie has strong character development, though some of the conflict is still fuzzy and unresolved.",1111449600,,577,4.611650485436893
703334,5,6303686877,"Sensitively told coming-of-age film set against Las Vegas and the early years of atomic testing. Rose (Annabeth Gish) is thirteen and very much wants to connect with stepdad Jack (Jon Voight), an alcoholic WWII veteran still possessed by the demons of combat. Trouble is, she's operating on one track, while he's operating on two, such that just when they seem at last to converge, he goes off on a  delusionary binge. Movie is notable for the exceptionally fine performances of these two actors. Gish, tottering atop two gawky legs and peering out from  the cosmetic curse of horned-rim glasses, is the very real, aching embodiment of adolescent angst. Hers has to be one of the finest, least mannered renderings of teen-age yearning and self-doubt in many, many years, and made even me, a hardened old curmudgeon, feel  kindly toward the hopelessly pubescent. Voight's character is less sympathetic and more complex. Victimized by the evils of war and beset by alcohol and impotence, he's having trouble with his masculinity in a house full of women.  He wants to fulflill a positive role for his wife and stepdaughters, but the inner turmoil keeps erupting unpredictably. You want Jack and Rose to connect, to heal one another's emotional wounds, but circumstance is against them. Movie leaves off on suitably ambiguous note as atomic test parallels emotional family blowup. We know time will take care of Rose's problems, but what of Jack. Film is not so much about dysfunction as it is about  adolescence and the walking wounds of war, such that you'll remember the characters long after the various plot complications have subsided. What a fine piece of non-commercial movie making this is thanks to Sundance Productions and writer-director Eugene Corr. Their work along with that of the entire cast shows once again why ""the obscure little movie with something to say"" continues to be one of our finest film traditions.",1082937600,12,1926,5.044025157232705

7852790,5,6303686877,"Poignant and adroit story telling. A masterful coming of age story.....ostensibly for a young women, but her story is a metaphor for what is happening in the USA at the time.
There was a MAJOR shift to Right Wing, reactionary politics in my country at this time. Gone were the small, social benefits of the Roosevelt/New Deal/WW2 paradigm that had swept the country.
This movie ushered in the rule of Spying and Militarism that is still with us today. Capitalism backed by the most powerful military force The World has ever seen, had its birth at this time, and Desert Bloom tells this story. No longer would ""America"" be ...Than Land Of The Free And The Home Of The Brave.......it would be the land that would invade other lands with ITS Military, and force the weight of USA Capital and Armed Forces on the rest of The Globe.
This movie, tells THAT Story. Watch It...!!!!",1438387200,,874,4.645161290322581

7852792,5,6303686877,"This film won its fair share of critical acclaim.  Say (or think) what you want of critics, this film is well worth a view (Dare I say it? Probably more than one).  Jon  Voight at his best, but the entire cast shines.  Tackles a range of topics: nuclear weapons, post-traumatic stress syndrome, alcoholism, fidelity, racism, step-families, and -- for good measure -- the challenges of being both bright and female.  One of the better movies that is ""under the radar"" of many movie-goers.  Recommended.",1424476800,,501,4.904761904761905

7852794,5,6303686877,"Somehow missed this movie on first release. Just saw it recently. A superb little film with admirable chemistry among the cast: Voight, Williams, Barkin, and an enigmatically moving performance from Gish (as Rose), the awkward, coming-of-age stepdaughter. The story line's merits have been aptly detailed here by others, but a few notable vignettes from this viewer's perspective: 1) the chubby, balding, supportive neighbor who warns Voight's abusive stepfather that ""if I ever see another mark on Rose, I'm coming after you, and I don't care how many guns you've got""; 2) Rose and her stepfather discussing the merits of Duke Ellington as 'Mood Indigo' is being broadcast on the living room radio; 3) Rose (with cool sunglasses) and cohorts at a teenage party engaged in a sort of group line dance to some great jazz music blasting from the stereo. The pleasures of this film are too many to mention. A sleeper, not to be missed.",1405296000,,931,4.9743589743589745
