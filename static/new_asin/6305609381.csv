This did not subtract from the action, and their was plenty of action.  Would have added to the story had, at least  one of the good guys, been killed, in all those ten thousand rounds of bullets. Absolutely no romance in this movie at all. This was no Saving Private Ryan, nor was it meant to be. It was just a good ""brotherhood of soldiers"" movie with a maniac on the loose with a nuclear sub and ICBMs. This same plot seems to run a thread through all the Delta Force movies, yet they are all different and thusfar, all entertaining. If you want an emotional movie giant, watch Steele Magnolias. If you want historical significance, watch Schindler's List. If you want action, after action, shadowed by action, with a decent story line, Delta Force 2 is better than a lot that is out their.",1240099200,,966,4.415730337078652
