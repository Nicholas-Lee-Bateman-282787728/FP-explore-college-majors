8278195,5,B00176I93G,"I was reluctant to buy this item due to W. Manford's review which faulted the audio quality.  Now that I have played it, I must conclude that Manford's system was to blame.  This disk has some of the best-quality audio and video I have experienced in my collection of a dozen or so blu-ray operas.  The DTS-HD audio is first-rate; the orchestra and soloists can be heard clearly with excellent fidelity.

I particularly enjoyed Rene Jacobs' direction, which I believe brings us closer to Mozart's original vision.  In appearance, the production is spare, but effective in communicating the essence of the story.  I enjoyed all the soloists including the youthful Johannes Weisser in the title role.",1246147200,13,698,4.974137931034483
8278196,4,B00176I93G,"The female cast here is very strong with a powerful performance by Malin Brystrom as Donna Anna and a delightful performance of Zerlina by Sunhae Im.
To me the male singers were let down by Allessandro Guerzoni in the role of Commendatore whose voice lacked the the commanding authority needed in the role. After a hair raising scream by Malin Brystrom in the last act, the entrance of Alessandro down the aisle of the audience towards Don Giovanni was an anti climax and waving the red curtain to simulate Giovanni's descent into hell was unconvincing. The use of red strobe lighting was an obvious omission and made this last scene less dramatic than it should have been.
Apart from that this production is most enjoyable with great acting and singing accompanied by glorious orchestral accompliment. So, recommended but with the above caveat.",1245542400,2,845,4.957746478873239
8278197,5,B00176I93G,"This is very fine production of Don Giovanni by Rene Jacobs and Vincent Boussard!!! Did I like it? Yes! 100%!!!
Picture Quality and Sound Quality are very good as well.
Watched it on my Pioneer Elite Kuro PRO-111FD + PS3 + Pioneer Elite SC-07. Perfect!!!",1239494400,,254,4.666666666666667
8278198,3,B00176I93G,"The Opus Arts series has spoiled me.  Their blu-ray discs contain crisp photography and beautiful sound.  This Don Giovanni harmonia mundi production has neither clear photography nor quality sound.  The overture was recorded in etched sound, almost painful to the ears.  The arias were recorded at a distance, as though the viewer were seated many rows from the front. Sometimes the soloist could not be heard.

All being said, Vincent Boussard's direction was exceptional, the Ren Jacobs musical conducting  and the orchestra quite extraordinary,  the operatic performers accomplished and sang in concert. whether it be a duet, a trio or a quartet.  The round/oval scenery by Vincent Lemaire, though, was odd, to say the least.  It seems to be  in vogue to use scenery that fails to appear life-like, but somehow must be mounted on some type of movable turntable to be turned around several times.  Half of the time the audience was treated to a view of the back of the scenery.  Odd, indeed.",1221004800,20,994,4.957575757575758
