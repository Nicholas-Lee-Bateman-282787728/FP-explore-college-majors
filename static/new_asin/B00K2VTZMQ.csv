Personally my preference is for the old black & white movies, mostly.  But I stumbled across this one and right from the get go, I should have had a hanky.  It's so realistic it's like you're actually looking at people living their lives through a window.  That little boy should have been up for an Oscar.  He was so completely believable that it actually makes me feel bad that such a young child should even be doing this acting.  I had to google him and, apparently, the movie was made in 2009 and he is doing just fine (phew).  Anyway, as I said, this is definitely in my top 10 of all time favourite movies (and I have over 2,000 of them in my 'favourite' collection).",1502150400,,791,4.333333333333333
