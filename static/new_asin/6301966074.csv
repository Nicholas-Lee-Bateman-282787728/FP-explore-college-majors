383219,5,6301966074,"I bought this film about 3 months ago and I am in need of a new one... I was 6 when he died and I feel that I missed out on something great. This is a way to see Elvis out there knocking them dead and it gives those of us that were too young to see the magic of Elvis, as it was going on.
By the end of the film I was crying my eyes out... Elvis may have put on some pounds, but he still had the magic that captured many hearts...  When he wore that cape, I thought of him as the super hero of Rock...
As I watched it for the first time 3 months ago... I believe that Elvis spirit was there with me... I let the tears flow, but I had a warm feeling in my heart... He did touch me through this movie... MGM... Please put this on DVD, PLEASE????",1032825600,3,743,3.7025316455696204
383220,4,6301966074,"Presley's second documentary focusing on live performance during his ""Comeback"" era ('69 to '73), this one is full of life and Elvis' high energy. His great rapport with his fans is captured beautifully - the close-up of the spellbound ladies at the conclusion of ""You Gave Me A Mountain"" is incredible.
The earlier ""Elvis - That's The Way It Is"" centered on one event - his third Las Vegas engagement [not counting the 05-56 gig], capturing the behind the scenes events of a huge venue and a huge star. There is a heady nervousness to those proceedings, whereas with ""On Tour"" we get a more ""settled in"" entertainer - but still the perfectionist!
There are many magnificent moments, i.e., Elvis recording the very personal ""Seperate Ways"" (written by friend/song writer/bodyguard Red West); Elvis warming up on [the still unreleased] Kaye's ""Wandering"" [interestingly enough, the melody upon which ""I'll Never Fall In Love Again"" is based - the Tom Jones/Elvis number] with friend/Music Publishing Rep./Lighting Tech. Lamar Fike, et. al; Elvis singing the Gospel ""I, John"" backstage with the Sweet Inspirations. Until this '72 movie, I'm sure many were unaware of the real significance of non-Secular music was in his life.
A reviewer noted a decline in Presley's voice from the '70 documentary. Yes, it is clear that he did lose some control, some color; his vibrato was not as strong. But he seemed to gain range and power. The slight decline could be attributed to constant touring - the instrument was worn.
The '56 TV clip was a terrific segment, capturing the young, raw Rocker, still on the rise. Watching him sing and play live was a revelation back in '73 when I saw ""On Tour"" in the movies. At the time, it caused me to discount the '70s personae as overblown, overproduced, unfunky. Today, I can see that a 37 year old man ain't gonna tear it up every time, especially if the average age out there is also (probably) 37.
One final thought: I read that the producers of this film recorded something like two-hours of Elvis being interviewed for the narrative. Would that make a great CD release! M'boy, m'boy...",1011657600,7,2122,4.848484848484849
383221,4,6301966074,"What a difference two years can make in the life of a touring mega-star. Having recently purchased the excellent DVD of the 1970 Elvis - That's The Way It Is, I was unprepared for the drastically changed Elvis of this 1972 theatrical release. The changes are not just in his appearance, but more importantly in his vitality and vocal performance. In fact, the appearance aspect was the least of my concerns. True, he has put on weight since the earlier film, but so what? He still looks handsome at thirty-seven, and if there are telltale signs that his lifestyle is beginning to catch up with him, then this is hardly surprising after 16 years of relentless stardom. Far more worrying, however, is the decline in sheer vocal quality.

From the very first song (Johnny B. Goode), Elvis sounds tired and slurred. His voice is worn, and lacks the resonant beauty that it had just two years earlier. On many of the slower numbers (eg Separate Ways, Love Me Tender and Bridge Over Troubled Water), a distinct ""wobble"" has crept into his singing, making it difficult for him to sustain a smooth line in the quiet passages. (Compare these with, say, his 1970 recording of Twenty Days and Twenty Nights and the unevenness of his later singing is immediately noticeable.) The change is nowhere more evident than in his middle register. He is still able to belt out the notes in climactic moments - An American Trilogy is proof of that - but gone is the wonderfully rich baritonal quality and freshness of his earlier singing.

The decline seems to have set in from 1971 onwards. Up until then his voice had been magnificent, with 1969 and 1970 arguably his peak years. There would still be moments - even right up until the end - when he would regain much of his former vocal beauty, but overall I believe this documentary confirms an ominous decline that would continue with the 1973 Aloha from Hawaii concert.

Maybe the problem was simply tiredness and over-use of his vocal cords. If this was the case, then it's unlikely that those closest to him would have ever succeeded in reining him in. For as this video makes abundantly clear, Elvis loved touring, and his need to perform was a constant driving force.

And what a great performer he was! Vocal problems aside, this is a fascinating study of THE pop icon of the twentieth century. Far from being ""static"", as Leonard Maltin asserts, this is a fast-moving look at the hectic whirlwind of Elvis Presley's touring life. There are also reflective moments of quiet beauty, notably when Elvis rehearses gospel numbers with his troupe. Elvis' occasional narration also adds much to the film.

This is an honest, warts and all look at Elvis, and well worth your time.",1008201600,30,2712,4.725158562367865
383222,5,6301966074,"Fantastic footage.  Who would have ever thought that you could combine karate with music?  It sure looks good when executed by a black belt in Kenpo Karate, which Elvis was.  As is typical with many early 70's footage, there is a split screen effect occasionally.  That is, you can see different angles of Elvis all in one shot, or various band members, audience, etc all in one viewing.  This is great if you have a large screen TV or see it at the Drive in theater, like I did.  I would hope that when it is released on DVD, the split screen version will be dispensed, and available as an optional camera angle at the click of the remote.  If you ain't an Elvis fan, you are likely to be afterward, but I suggest seeing the other concert movie, Elvis-That's The Way It Is, first.",1005782400,,781,4.344827586206897
383223,4,6301966074,"This is one of my favorite movies. Nothing compares to Elvis on stage. No annoying interviews, no scripts just Elvis doing what he did best, Singing live. Looking forward to a possible re-release in 2002.",979516800,2,204,4.857142857142857
383224,5,6301966074,"Compare Elvis with just 2 years prior in Thats The Way It Is and you can  see what constant touring and the pressure's of being the no1. star has  taken. This film shows many aspects of the entertainment business, behind  the scenes, the live performance and best of all shows what Elvis did best,  performe live. It also gives a demostration of the pro side of Elvis, as in  arrive minutes before, go on stage, give them what they want to see and  leave the building immediatly, ber in mind this is 1972, its no surprise  people still buy his records and visit his home.

383225,4,6301966074,"Among the great tunes included here--Red West's ""Separate Ways"", ""Ready Teddy"" (from the Ed Sullivan show), ""Lead Me, Guide Me"", ""Bosom of Abraham"", ""I John"", 'Bridge Over  Troubled Water"", ""You Gave Me a Mountain"", and, of course,  the showstopping ""American Trilogy"". By this point, Elvis'  touring band--Burton, Tutt, et. al.--were a well-oiled machine. The look of  wonder on Elvis' face as he stands back to let J.D. Sumner and the Stamps  do their number ""Sweet, Sweet Spirit"" says it all. Incidentally,  I hear they're going to release the soundtrack album soon, some 28 years  after the fact...",960336000,4,602,5.144329896907217
383226,4,6301966074,"""Elvis On Tour"" (1972) is a revealing portrait of an artist in obvious decline. Compared to the excellent ""That's the Way It Is,"" the Presley seen ""On Tour"" looks like a different person  he's overweight, less enthusiastic and somewhat distant. Nevertheless, it's a fascinating film  because it shows a different side of Elvis. Among the highlights are Presley's gospel numbers with J.D. Sumner and the Stamps. The live segments, however, lack the spontaneity and energy that dominated ""That's the Way It Is."" As a result, ""Elvis On Tour"" succeeds primarily as a historic document rather than a concert showcase.",933206400,5,612,5.171717171717172

Since I am suffering from Spinal Cancer, movies and books are the only source of entertainment I have, so I get happy when I get an item from the wishlist, I was very pleased with this seller and would recommend buying from them, anytime.  This particular DVD was shot around 1972 when Elvis was in his prime after resurrecting his career following the 1968 Comeback Special, this video was shot just prior to the Aloha From Hawaii that was simulcast across the world, that concert being the very first one ever to having been done. Elvis was an amazing performer in his own right, folks this is what Music is, not the stuff we hear today, a full band, orchestra, and back up singers. A very highly recommended purchase.

of concert filming. very effective, covering every angle.  5 weeks of touring, 2 shows a night, a different city every
night.  I don't see how he did it.  He was there for the people and to please them.  Before every show Elvis reminded his
band that they have done this over and over but most of the fans this is their first show and that he wanted them feel it
was a fresh new show, every night. Elvis was so uptight from, believe it or not, stage fright because he was so focused
on being perfect and making sure every single person had the show of their lives.  Excellent footage, well supported by
his father.  You will not good wrong by this purchase and will enjoy watching this over and over. Elvis is the king and was

383937,5,6301966074,"Elvis in Jacksonville Florida, 1972... for 2 shows April 16 on a Sunday afternoon and evening! I actually saw him on the balcony of his suite Room 1010 on the Tenth floor in his bath robe throw his leg over the balcony railing saying he was gonna jump to his fans below.(too bad that didn't make the film) The women began fainting as Elvis just laughed waving as he went back into his suite. It was a great time to see Elvis on Tour! He looked his best and was on top of his game. The documentary shows Elvis backstage, traveling back and forth to each engagement. A real behind the scenes look at what it was like to be On Tour with the King! CRAZY!!! Shows Elvis reflecting as he was riding over the Main Street bridge in Jacksonville Fla. looking at the Gator Bowl where he was first rushed having his cloths torn off having to be rushed to the Baptist hospital to recover from exhaustion. Or looking at The Florida theater (which is still there having concert events with major performers) remembering when he was told by a local Judge not to move or he was going to jail! Reflecting on all these things while looking out the window, the film goes to one of his appearances on The Ed Sullivan show among others from back in the beginning of his career. Just a Great Film about a Great Performer and Martin Scorsese's first work in film. A real masterpiece on music history in America.... Something everyone should see at least once. This package represents what was going in music at the time just as Woodstock shows us what the late 60's was like with the music culture in America! .We see Elvis riding in his limousine on Adams street after his Sunday afternoon show in Jacksonville clowning around with his security team telling jokes and even singing with them unwinding after his performance as well as other cities on the tour where he had to meet city officials with keys to the city etc. with tremendous footage of Elvis performing on stage with Great narration by Elvis himself about his career. Just a great tell all film about Elvis On Tour! spring of 1972. Even if your not a fan, Buy it, you won't regret it....",1411948800,2,2128,4.458974358974359

384352,3,6301966074,"Back in the 1970's I first saw this movie, (or the movie this DVD was based on) during a tv late Saturday night showing. I think it was back in 1974. It was the start of me becoming an Elvis fan.  However this isn't really the movie I saw. WB took liberties with it beginning with the first song, Johnny B. Goode which they replaced with Don't Be Cruel a good song BTW but they shouldn't have changed it. They edited the car sequences where Elvis didn't know he was being filmed.  I know I remembered the origional correctly because a few years I bought the VHS and it was the way I remembered.  I'm not saying some changes shouldn't be made. I'm saying instead of taking things out put some concert footage in.  I understand they have tons of footage from the concert where he was wearing the pale blue outfit. and it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't have tons more of the dark blue and the white ones.  Why don't they take as and example what they did for That's The Way It Is. or Elvis Aloha From Hawaii or the 68 Comeback Special?  They did wonderful jobs on them and found the best footage of them for some real kick butt first class entertainment fit for such a great talent.  Get on the ball WB.

Elvis put so much into his music for all of us to enjoy and I have always appreciated each show was as if it was the first.  I believe his music will live on forever as his talent will not be surpassed.  Loved the Stamps singing ""Sweet, Sweet Spirit"" on this disc. A beautiful hymn! I  enjoyed it much as Elvis seemed to. Elvis has been an important part of my life since I was thirteen years old.  He seemed to be a very nice person with strong family values and showed respect for others always.

This DVD package is a great memento of those electric tour moments. The thrill of seeing/hearing Elvis LIVE is tough to top. To be fair, though, his concerts could have been longer (about an hour, and Elvis left the building), and could certainly have featured more of his own catalogue....I mean literally a hundred great Elvis originals could have been sung. This is not to say there's a bad performance of any of the material...but I never understood the prioritization of performing his take on chart toppers by Tony Joe White, 3 Dog Night, CCR, etc.. I mean, this IS ELVIS for heavens' sake! Shouldn't it be the other way around? Having said that, WHAT SOUND on this DVD! Far and away the best feature you get here. Superb! The picture is great, but not stunning...I'd say average for Blu Ray DVD's I've watched on my Sony Blu Ray player. The backstage footage and rehearsal footage are always a special keepsake. The ""book"" is cool too. Biggest disappointment is the lack of special features. Blu Ray purchasers are used to lavish special features or at least SOME. There are none, except scene selection. I imagine that anything ELViS could get complicated contractually to compile....but this package yearns for bonus interviews with James Burton, the Stamps, the Sweet Inspirations,.....etc.. Perhaps at a later date. This is a must-have Blu Ray book keepsake for Elvis fans who saw him on tour....or wish they could have. But, like those 70's concerts....could have been even better. One final comment on packaging...there's a full covering sticker (loosely attached) on the back of the case, masking what was originally printed on the back....to obviously comply with current contents vs.  what was originally listed. Kind of mysterious. I haven't removed the sticker to compare notes. If I do, I'll update this review.",1348617600,5,1969,4.930722891566265

I agree with many of them.  Where I want to comment is the production of the re-release.  Another reviewer made referrence to clips from this movie on You Tube.  I agree...where are all those clips?  It is clear that the people who produced, ""Elvis On Tour"" didn't put the same effort into it as those who produced the ""Elvis, That's The Way It Is"", ""Aloha From Hawaii"", and The ""68 Comeback"" re-release  As with those, so much more could have been done here, this could easily have been a two or three disc set.  Interviews, additional studios scenes, maybe even a full concert instead of just clips from the many Elvis did on this tour.  This was clearly a way to see how much money could be fleeced from Elvis fans around the world.  This kind of reminds me of when Hollywood decides to make a sequal to a movie and can't get the original cast together but does it anyway.  If you couldn't bring all the members together, don't do it.  With this film, if you weren't going put more effort into it, don't release it until you can.  I'm sure someone is planning to release this movie yet again in the future.  Maybe for the 40th anniversary (I have no confirmation of that).  If they are, do the fans a favor...do it right...PLEASE!  Elvis gave 100% of himself to his fans.  Follow his example next time.",1315612800,5,1469,4.417910447761194

Oh yeah, Full length concerts of this tour in it's entirty. But no. What do we get instead just the movie. We don't even get at least on how the film was made. Now i already know what EPE interprise is going to do next but out a 2 or 3 DVD box-set of the original 93 minute film and 2 or 3 concerts in full to get more money out of us. Well, they should have done that on this release or at least the blue ray version. When will they ever learn. Never, i guess. Elvis would have blown his top if he found out his fans we're being suckered into this crap of a such dvd release.

384619,4,6301966074,"I had this movie on vhs back in the say when they used to release the elvis collections. i believe it was like five movies per box. Anyway it's been forever since I've seen it as I sold my vhs collection to start buying dvds. The Blu Ray Transfer is great, it seems like they did the best they could with what they had. Though, I will add that it seems with Elvis material they tend to take better care of archival stuff than with others from that time frame. Only drawback with this dvd is that it has no extras. They could have thrown in say a look back on the film including the people who worked on it (who are still with us) commenting on it. But, oh well. It's still Elvis. Some have said that this isn't their favorite performance movie/dvd. I agree with that, however, if put into perspective this isn't really like a live concert. While you get some live performances, that look great on blu ray (I have not seen the recently released dvd version of this so I can't really say what the differences are between the two, I only have my VHS memories) Everything looks great, the sound is great. What I do like (and this is also why I buy special editions of Elvis cd's that include studio chatter/alternate versions) Is that you get a feel of what Elvis was like as a person. You get to see him briefly working in the studio (I always have wondered if they ever extensively recorded him live in the studio and if so if we'll ever see it on dvd) It's always nice to see behind the scenes stuff, as it always gives you a better glimpse into who the man was. Elvis is an Icon, almost a Myth, but it's in scenes that are showcased here, and in other releases that show Elvis the person, his shyness, his humbleness. Though I do wish they included some kind of extras, the book they included was really nice, the blu ray is set up as a book anyway. It's very nice overall, the packaging and pictures were a great add-on. Maybe that was to make up for the lack of dvd extras? I want to own all of elvis's movies. and as much of the other specials as I can. I already own the deluxed edition (3dvds) of the '68 Comeback Special. That I give five stars..totally packed with extras) So I would have bought this dvd regardless, but it's nice that at least with the feature presentation they took time to release a great product.

This issue of Elvis on Tour has been slightly altered from the original release, however be that as it may, if your are an Elvis fan this is a must for your collection. The split scgreen effect is fantastic as it shows many of the hugh range of the costumns Elvis wore. It also reveals the adoration of his fans, which I suspect in many instances, mine included, is still alive and well today.
The reproduction is good and one gets a real feel of the timelessness of a famous man who changed the course of music for the world. There were times during the movie when my tears flowed as the loneliness of a star shone through. Sometimes we forget that being on top can mean being very much alone, even though surrounded by a million adoring fans. In the sea of faces where were the loved ones, where was home?
The few flash backs to the early days lend credence to the fact the fame does not mean personal happiness.
The songs cover most of his lifes work with oldies and newies being intermixed. There are also a number of his favourite gospel songs. To the Presley Estate - Thank you for this release. We still love you Elvis.",1287100800,7,1196,4.32

384626,5,6301966074,"Elvis on Tour being released on DVD and Blu-ray is a dream finally realized by many fans.  We've waited so many years for this to happen.  I won't go into what's on the disc because you can already read that, but instead, I'll review my thoughts on the blu-ray disc.

I initially was going to purchase the regular DVD.  I didn't feel that blu-ray would make a difference in viewing quality.  This was my mindset because we have a blu-ray player and a projection screen TV and the picture quality was so-so, plus we never took advantage of HD on our TV.  We were nave, I know.  I didn't purchase this through Amazon, but instead Best Buy.  I went into Best Buy looking for the regular DVD.  They didn't have it, so I purchased the blu-ray instead.  Of course I watched it when I returned home and it looked like I expected...1970s-quality TV.  I wasn't disappointed, but I expected more from the blu-ray.

Our TV finally died and we replaced it with a Sharp Aquos&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sharp-AQUOS-LC46LE700UN-46-Inch-1080p-120-Hz-LED-HDTV/dp/B002BNMPCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sharp AQUOS LC46LE700UN 46-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LED HDTV</a>.  Oh man...the first thing I did was put Elvis on Tour in the blu-ray player.  I was absolutely blown away by the image quality.  The colors pop out, especially the blue jumpsuit.  It's like Elvis is in the room with you.  I can honestly say that this is the first time I've ever seen Elvis look so real.  It's a beautiful and wonderful thing.  I know what you're thinking...maybe it's just the new TV.  Yes, maybe it is, but I tried a regular DVD and while the quality is still good, it's not blu-ray good.  If you want to watch Elvis in the best possible way, choose the blu-ray over the standard DVD.  You will not be disappointed.

Just like it's predecessor, we learn zipp about Elvis Presley - just that he was a unqiue innovator in his field, had cosmic charisma, and was a true family man: his Father fills many frames in this movie. Maybe we *do* learn something of his personal crisis, as his wife and four year old daughter are conspicuous by their absence.

So, the ""extended Elvis family"", if you will, is magnificently presented here, in multi-frame and massive sound (back up singers, back up groups, huge orchestra, playing three chords, playing complex big ballads; mixing old-time rock and roll with present-day rock: gotta say, ""Burning Love"", his hit-to-be is better than *any* '50s classic - except for perhaps, ""A Big Hunk O' Love"". He doesn't expel much CO2 over them - the grandiose arrangements and ridiculous overproduction don't help).

What really floored me, 37 years later (I saw the film in New York City in 1973), was the genre overlapping. The absolute best sequence, ironically, is of ""Sweet, Sweet Spirit"", a number by the male Gospel group only, leads into the 1952, lowdown proto-rocker, ""Lawdy, Miss Clawdy"". So what? The same guys sing the tune!
The line from the song, ""ball every morning"", by 1972, surely did not relate to ballroom dancing, as it did in the '50s. Incredible. Bad taste? Maybe...but baby, that is rock and roll.

Perhaps I spoke too soon. We *do* learn something about EAP, in that strange non-selcular to secular jump. He broke down barriers to entertain the folks.",1281744000,,1660,4.814035087719298

384702,5,6301966074,"This blue-raye edition of Elvis On Tour, which has never been available even on a dvd format and has been pretty much kept under wraps by MGM for several decades, is quite a revelation both with regards to its superior sound and picture quality as well as showcasing a very robust and physical performance from Elvis himselfish. Superior camaera direction by noted cimematographer Lucien Ballaed, who also handled the same duties on Elvis Thats The Way It Is which came out two years before this Golden Globe winning documentary and featured his return to live performance in Las Vegas and was probably captured at the peek of his physicality as a performer and showed an amazingly goodlooking and charismatic vocalist who could pretty much out-sing anybody in the business this side of Roy Orbison or Charlie Rich, is one of the many talanted people who was involved in the making of this superior film.

Some fans will note that Elvis is not quite as tan or fit as in the previous documentary, and he would look and sound even better a year later in the Aloha From Hawaii concert special also highly recommended in its deluxe format though not yet available in Blue-ray format, still features amazingly great sound and majestic vocals by Presley. What this film does capture is the frantic excitment and thrill of the Elvis mystic as he powers through 15 concerts in 15 days while Elvis's own words serve as an occassional naration to the hysteria and raw excitment of his fandom.

Elvis uses and demonstrate his love for karate which he lets flow naturally, but forcefully through his various bodily gyrations timed perfectly to the rhythem of Ronnie Tutt's stellar drum work, especially during Polk Salad Annie and Proud Mary. Elvis' voice reaches new highs and crescendos on American Triology and his absolutely majestic version of Bridge Over Troubled Water.

The split screen photography, which I thought I might find annoying or distracting, really makes you feel like you are there live in the arena with the King. No less a figure than famed director Martin Scorsese over saw much of the montage technique that was used in several parts of the film. This is a superior concert film which captures Elvis in some surprising and intimate moments backstage with his backing singers doing what he really loved best, singing spirituals into the wee hours of the morning, not for money or acclaim, but because he needed to and wanted to!",1281225600,4,2440,4.860576923076923

384738,5,6301966074,"Could have been much better.

I own this film on all formats, VHS, Laser-Disc, VCD and bootleg DVD. I've waited long for a proper high-quality release of this great concert film.

The quality of the video is great compared to all previous releases. The transfer is sharp, hi-def and has great colors. It is a bit grainy and the print used for mastering does have some wear but overall appearance is fresh and new.

The audio quality is a big disappointment. DTS-HD? Common! Sure, you can take anything and convert it into DTS-HD but it won't make it high-quality. The audio quality is only slightly better than the Laser-Disc release. They didn't bother to go into RCA recordings and remaster, they simply used the original soundtrack and had some remastering done and a very basic mix into 5.1. Unfortunately no other audio option is offered other than the 5.1 DTS-HD, a 2 channel PCM would have been nice! The mix to 5.1 is very basic and offer Elvis only in the center channel (in singing too) along with the drums and rest of the instruments come from right and left. The result is a bit weird and I've enjoyed listening much more when setting my receiver to a stereo mode, then the sound came back to life and I got some good experience. Also, for some reason the gain is quite low, about 6db-10db less loud than most musical releases on Blu-Ray.

The movie is untouched. No editing, no extras footage, no nothing. The Blu-Ray also doesn't offer any additional material. No bonuses what so ever, not even the trailer.

One way the film was changed - a major disappointment - at the begining after Elvis' onologue (my daddy always said.......) instead of bursting into the great version of Johnny Be Good, you get a live version of ""don't be cruel"", most likely a ""rights"" issue.

The packaging is amazing, including a great color booklet.

For those of you who don't know the film and just want to know whether to get it or not - Get it! You get a raw footage of Elvis in the early 70's, lean and mean while touring around the US in large stadiums which gave the concerts a more raw and rockish feeling than his Vegas shows. You also get a glimpse behind stage of Elvis and his entourage.",1280880000,4,2193,4.5227272727272725

384742,2,6301966074,"Warner Bros has screwed Elvis fans again.  It has sort of become a tradition by this point.

In this newly released DVD/Blu-Ray release of ""Elvis On Tour"", Warner Bros has removed ""Johnny B. Goode"" from the opening credits and replaced it with a pathetically edited live version of ""Don't Be Cruel.""  Anyone who has seen the original opening credits knows that this decision was a huge misstep.  Not only did the opening credits set the tone for the entire film---it was obviously chosen to be the song to accompany the stunning opening footage.  It was an artistic choice made by the editors to marry these 2 elements together.  Now, in this first-ever-release of ""Elvis on Tour""---WB has decided to remove ""Johnny B. Goode"" and replace it with a below-par version of ""Don't Be Cruel.""  To make matters worse--the ""editing"" job to loop the track to fit the 2 minute credits is deplorable.  I would not be surprised if the loop was created by a 14 year old kid who just discovered ProTools.  It's an absolutely amateur hack job that leaves you speechless.  Their new Frankenstein opening insults the original credits and most of all it insults the fans.

There is absolutely no mention of this change anywhere.  Not in the description, nor in the press release announcing this project.  It was an underhanded move.  This only shows how little WB cares about their Elvis products or his fans--a group whose patience has been tested time and time again.  See these other instances:

That's The Way It Is Special Edition 2001 - instead of including a batch of bonus songs and special features---all plans were scrapped at the 11th hour.  This film had reels and reels of extra footage that was waiting to be seen and WB took that away from the fans.

That's The Way It Is (2007) Now they've re-released the film with both the ORIGINAL film and the re-edited film from 2001 on DVD.  This time they included a collection of bonus songs---but in the poorest quality imaginable.  Footage that looked like came from 5th generation VHS tapes with a mono soundtrack.  Just awful.

And of course on top of all this-we had to wait nearly 15 years for Elvis On Tour to get its own DVD release.  Much like the film ""That's The Way It Is"", it is very well documented (and bootlegged) that there are hours upon hours of additional footage available from ""Elvis On Tour.""  There are countless hours of concert footage, candid behind the scenes footage, reels of rehearsal footage and even a rare on camera interview with Elvis himself.  There is enough extra material that could have easily fit 3 additional discs, thereby creating a magnificent multi-DVD box set that would no doubt put Elvis in an extremely flattering light.

But we didn't get any of that---instead we get a bare-bones release with not a drop of special features.  But hey, we had won the war.  We were just happy to get the damn movie on DVD---finally!  It was a small victory amongst the fans.  We turned the other cheek on the lack of bonus footage--we just wanted the original film.  But we don't even get that.  They butcher the opening credits completely spoiling the film right from the beginning.
So what are fans to do?  We are screwed time and time again only so WB can milk more and more money out of us.  No doubt WB will re-release Elvis On Tour properly some years down the line.  But the fact that they could not even preserve the original film for us in its first ever DVD release is pathetic.

I have no idea what WB's plans are with the mounds of Elvis footage they have in their possession. The majority of Elvis fans who would actually pay to see this footage are not getting younger. Some of Elvis' best live footage is locked away with no real hope of ever being seen by anyone.  That is truly a shame.",1279670400,18,3777,4.600299401197605

Catch Presley back stage rehearsing, recording in the studio and entertaining thousands of fans across the country! There is something for everybody in this film.

I am so glad that i have this even though it's on VHS it is a great video and lots of great performances by Elvis. If you don't have this by all means get it before it goes away for good. I don't think this will ever be on DVD and if it is it may not be the same quality as it is on the VHS. Every Elvis collector should have this in your collection. To see all the cities and the excited fans waiting to see him in concert and for a time you forget that this is a video you are watching because you get caught up in the excitement of Elvis going on stage and 2001 Space Odessy is playing and you know he is about to appear. Buy it before it's to late to me it doesn't matter if it's on VHS i'm glad i purchased it for my collection before it no longer exist.

384822,4,6301966074,"We follow Elvis from city to city. He dons jumpsuits and gains weight. We see his increasing boredom. Elvis disintegrated after his divorce from Priscilla. Lyrics became morbid. Burning Love was the last big hit. His records were good until the end, but there was little recording the last two years. The film got the Golden Globe Award for Best Documentary. It is chaotic but worth it because it is candid Elvis. The quote from his father about guitar players not being worth a damn would not have come out a decade earlier. Elvis' songlist is filled with hits by other artists. His own Lawdy Miss Clawdy sounds as sexy today as it did in the beginning.",1203811200,2,654,4.598290598290598

And even though we could not help but to see his beautiful stage clothes and how great he wears them, and at times his sadness,  a more focus on his voice should be considered instead.  This is a great dvd and a must not only for Elvis fans but for anybody that likes good singing and music,all along he displayed a terrific and powerful voice plus the compliment of his backup singers and musicians did the rest for the total scenario.  Without a doubt the best entertainer that set foot on a stage ever.  A man that gave his voice and total soul on every performance.",1178928000,4,655,4.25
384825,4,6301966074,"There is a very good reason for this film not living up to That the Way It Is.  I am sure if you have seen this movie you have noticed that it is much more grainey and not as bright as TTWIS or other movies for that matter. This contributes a lot to the picture not being as well received.  The fact of the matter is that MGM in it's infinite wisdom chose to shoot the movie in 16 mm not 35 mm as most all movies.  This is a little known fact.  But all you have to do is watch for many of the stage segments and you can see the photographers crawling around the various stages with a relatively small camera in hand.  They may have done this for maneuverability sake but with significant loss in quality.  16 mm is a long way from 35 mm in all measuring points.  This may also be why they have not put it out on DVD as yet.  The movie is very grainy and this adds a subconscious negativity to the movie.  I was present at many of the concerts that were filmed for this movie.  The live shows were not grainy at all and they were very sharp and well lit and came across much better than the film.

Content of a movie is always affected by how it is presented.  Long live the King",1157760000,5,1178,3.9659574468085106
384826,5,6301966074,"To start, I won't labor through listing all of the music on the concert video.  Reviewer Alejandra Vernon did that nicely in her excellent Spotlight Review.

This is not my favorite Elvis concert video from a musical perspective - that would be ""The '68 Comeback Special"".  But this video belongs on your Elvis shelf because it reveals an Elvis that we have not seen in his earlier work.

Pensive, tired, still unselfishly giving of himself to his fans.  The thrill is gone and it has become work.  He has a constant trail of people following him, depending on him, and he has the burden of projecting that Elvis image continuously.

There is a lot of off stage footage, which shows him to be thoughtful of and genuinely generous with his fans.  He looks great for his age, but he is aging, and he seems sad.  It's interesting that his only apparent joy in life (at least in this on the road, tour environment) seems to be music, including especially the impromptu off stage stuff . . . singing to himself in the limo, jamming gospel backstage with the band members. He's very likeable (loved by millions, of course) and one is glad to see him find escape in some good thing that he enjoys.

The on-stage music is good but is lacking a bit of the fire of his younger years.  The stagework in the video is a montage from the series of stops on the tour.  Clearly some of the concerts are better than others.  At some he is a bit reserved and his famous stage posturing and movement is stilted and a parody of earlier times. He is HOT at a couple of them and, again, you can tell that he never stopped loving the music. The video brings it out clearly.  Quite remarkably, we also see that he is still dealing with stagefright.

Speaking of the music - It seems that in every concert video (by anyone), there is a standout performance.  In this one it's Elvis' imperfect but driving performance of ""Burning Love"".  He introduces it as a ""new song"", has to read the lyrics for much of it, and it is incomplete.  The lyrics are a variation on what will later become maybe his last great #1 Hit recording. He even seems a bit embarrassed by the ""silliness"" of the tune . . . but he WAILS it out like the Elvis Presley of 10 years earlier.

This video does a pretty good job of showing the phenomenon of Elvis at (or a bit past) his peak: truly bigger than life, unarrogant, flashy but unassuming as only he could be, weary, human, lovable.  I hope that God received him into the habitations that he loved to sing about.

Recommended - for Elvis fans, music lovers, and students of remarkable people.",1152230400,102,2593,4.416842105263158
384827,5,6301966074,"This is a great video of Elvis. Critics at the time who said he looked overweight in the film was somewhat of an exaggeration on their part. Although he isn't as thin as he was in previous years, he was still in great shape and he certainly fitted into his jumpsuits pretty well in 1972. See how sharp and lean he looked in his blue jumpsuit during his performance of See See Rider! But he is sad at times and looks hurt and adds this pretty well to his music which makes a viewer and listener admire his openness and feel for his pain. One scene that still breaks my heart is when he is in the limo and is talking and tries to be lively and attentive but then drifts off, stares outside the window, and puts his hand near his face as he suddenly looks very sad and enters some deep, penetrating thoughts. What a powerful moment to witness!

Elvis on Tour has a great version of See See Rider (probably Elvis' best version) and it is lively and Elvis' voice is full of power and intensity as he sings this version with great energy, arrogance and fervor. He shows just as much attitude and energy in the next number, the fan favorite Polk Salad Annie. The studio sessions are a must see as Elvis pours out his heart in gospel tunes and in the emotionally scarred song called Separate Ways which should have been a number one hit if he had the right people packaging and promoting his music back then.

He performed some of the concert songs in Elvis on Tour on stage in past years such as Proud Mary, Bridge Over Troubled Water, Big Hunk O' Love and Lawdy Miss Clawdy, but he is singing them with more power, emotion and freshness in Elvis on Tour. They seem to have a different feel to them as each song shows Elvis singing in a very emotional and dramatic way. He certainly was real and not some artificial star who promoted a fake product. This video shows Elvis and his music and how he expressed himself through song.

I love every song Elvis sang in this video because they show a different side of him each time and each performance is vocally and musically impressive. He shows he can sing anything and he challenges himself to hit notes and sing different styles that made him a truly unique legend. He makes you want to sing and have fun as well and to sing with feeling!

The band is soulful, rocking, and funky and the background singers are at their best especially during Sweet, Sweet Spirit. This band has to rank as one of the best rock and rhythm bands of all-time. Being on stage with them must have been very powerful for Elvis to experience as is evident in Elvis on Tour. He loves his band and his singers and this shows in some of the off-stage footage. He does not act superior to them, but shows he is a human being who loves being around people and enjoys having a good time even though he is personally going through hell.

The entire video is packed with incredible power and emotion. Elvis' hair is somewhat long and messy and not styled in some of the concert footage as it was before each show as can be seen in the footage of him as he is preparing to go on stage (the fans were becoming more obsessive and out of control at that time and some tried pulling his hair out so they could have a personal momento of him!) He is not tanned as he liked to be and as he would be in his Aloha special several months later and during the concerts Elvis is mostly flooded with intense spotlights and constant camera flashes (which he loved for drama purposes) so you don't get a true look at how great looking he was. He clearly is not wearing televison make-up. But who cares. He looks absolutely handsome and even substandard video technology used to film Elvis on Tour still shows Elvis as the best looking guy ever!

Although this review had mentioned the fact that Elvis looks sad and hurt, it should be noted that too much is spent analyzing Elvis' personal life when people should focus on his great music instead as some reviewers have pointed out. Some stories of his life have been blown way out of proportion especially by ""friends"" who betrayed him so it is a waste of time to focus on Elvis' personal life and problems when it is the music that matters and should be talked about and the music is what really matters in Elvis on Tour.

It would be great if they could come out with a big DVD edition, however. Complete concerts were filmed for Elvis on Tour so there are several hours of unseen footage that can be included on a future DVD edition of Elvis on Tour including the complete Gospel segment and the powerful version of American Trilogy that was included in the terrible This is Elvis movie released after his death. Unfortunately, Elvis Presley Enterprises does not own any of the rights to Elvis on Tour and the people who do refuse to comply to requests to release Elvis on Tour and its unreleased material on DVD. Therefore, it would be beneficial for fans and even non-fans to buy this rare video of Elvis in his prime and show the powers that be that there is a strong market for this great concert documentary that proves that Elvis was and still is the greatest singer and performer ever!",1122076800,13,5141,4.37696335078534
384923,3,6301966074,"Some of the previous reviews have already touched on what I would have to say so I'll keep this short.  ""Elvis on Tour"" is nowhere near as good as ""That's the Way It Is"".  The performances are weaker, the song selection (in my opinion) is poorer since he doesn't sing most of the great songs for which he is known, and the overall structure of the film lacks the coherence and polish of ""That's the Way It Is"".  And on a fairly superficial level, Elvis looks a lot better in ""That's the Way It Is""-tanned and leaner.  Tanned, anyway.  Better hair, too, for what that's worth.  True, those are superficial things but they do make a difference to one's sense of ""The King"".  I had seen ""That's the Way It Is"" awhile back and thought it was one of the best concert films I'd seen; I expected more of the same with ""Elvis on Tour"" but was sadly disappointed.  So if you give five stars to this movie, you'd have to go off the scale when rating ""That's the Way It Is"", such is the difference in these two movies.",1104537600,13,1007,4.2631578947368425
384924,5,6301966074,"Director Robert Abel and producer Pierre Adidge present a marvelous look at Elvis in this documentary, using concert, rehearsal and backstage footage, as well as clips from the early days of his career, and a montage of him kissing his co-stars while ""Love Me Tender"" is performed. Excellent use of split-screen techniques are used, and the cinematography is always interesting.
Elvis looks in great shape from the neck down, quite trim and with the athletic flexibility to do deep leg lunges, and delivering each song with enormous emotional and physical energy. His face shows much dissipation however, and tells another story; the feeling one gets from this film is of a desperately sad man, a hurting soul, putting a brave mask on for the world. There is also not even a flicker of ego...we see only a hard-working guy, with not a shred of arrogance. He wears his flashy clothes with grace, style and humility, and sings his heart out, and it's a beautiful thing to see.

His voice is occasionally wobbly (and the sound quality also has its variables), but for the most part he shines, particularly in the songs with a spiritual theme. ""Bosom of Abraham,"" ""I John,"" and especially ""American Trilogy"" and ""You Gave Me a Mountain"" are very moving, and terrific listening.
His band is wonderful, and his back-up singers, The Sweet Inspirations and J.D.Sumner and the Stamps Quartet, an added delight.

You don't have to be an Elvis fan to enjoy this film, but you're guaranteed to have a deeper appreciation of his talent, and understand why he was ""The King"" after seeing it.
This is one of the best music documentaries I've seen, up there with Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Waltz,"" who incidentally, is listed as Montage Supervisor in the credits of this film.
Total running time is 93 minutes.",1092700800,158,2535,4.964705882352941
384925,5,6301966074,"""Elvis On Tour"" captures a loose, energetic King on the road. It features dozens of innovative split screen shots of Elvis. Whether he's making a quip or showing off his karate moves, this is Elvis at his peak.
""Elvis On Tour"" is much looser than ""That's The Way It Is"". He does not seem nervous like he did on the previous tape, and he adds extra flare to the songs that he performed in the previous outing. Elvis's voice is in its greatest shape ever here. He delivers a powerful, intense vocal performance on ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", then gives a gentle reading of ""Funny How Time Slips Away"". The rockers are also extremely good. Elvis gives electrifying versions of ""A Big Hink O' Love"" and ""Lawdy, Miss Clawdy"", plus a good version of ""I Got A Woman"". Closing this magnificient video is a beatiful rendition of ""Can't Help Falling In Love"".
I do have one gripe however. On the ""Lost Performances"" video, there are several performances filmed for this video that should've have been included. These songs are a powerful ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"", ""I Can't Stop Loving You"", ""All Shook Up"", ""Release Me"", ""Teddy Bear""/""Don't Be Cruel"", and a stunningly beautiful ""How Great Thou Art"". However, this truly is a must - have. Elvis is truly at his finest hour, his last moment of glory before sinking into the pits of drugs and fatty food.",1075507200,9,1346,4.6835443037974684
384926,5,6301966074,"There are only three released videos filmed of Elvis ""live"" during performances. This is one of the three and the only one to show the King on tour. For that reason, it is to be treasured. But not only for this: it also shows Elvis performing his early seventies numbers, and his interaction with the audiences of that time. Every appearance by the King is moving, shows his character and his mischievous nature and most of all - shows every new generation of fans what it was like to see the one and only King of Rock n Roll perform. Why this is not on DVD baffles me. Although re-editing of the movie would make it tighter, the live performance segments make up for everything! Hey, MGM/Turner, whoever! please, do you have any plans for this to be on DVD ? Are there any more Elvis performances locked away in a vault that you could put on DVD ? Elvis fans all over the world are a growing force and would LOVE to see more of the real Elvis - trust me, these performances are nothing like the inane Elvis movies which are so readily available!

384928,1,6301966074,"Elvis achieves several classic performances in this video; highlights include ""An American Trilogy"" and ""Bridge over Troubled Water"" as well as informal gospel warmups and warmdowns such as ""I John"" and ""Lead Me, Guide Me."" But this tape should not be available to the public in its present form.
In spite of Elvis's greatness, the film is horrifyingly bad. The camera work and editing are amateurish at best, with several outrageous mistakes--most notably Elvis playing his guitar left-handedly because of accidental image mirroring. The sound may be the worst of any concert video ever legally released, with the sound coming in and going out as though the tape had been left in the sun, the piano completely indiscernable throughout the entire concert, and several of the other instruments frequently likewise indiscernable because of the extreme tape hiss. Finally, any sense of coherent direction is nonextistent, with irrelevant pseudo-documentary moments interrupting Elvis's performances.
BMG has taken over Colonel Tom Parker's job of insulting both the art of Elvis and the sensibilities of Elvis's fans. And this video may be the biggest insult yet. This video needs the same treatment as ""That's the Way It Is"" received; until that treatment comes, I will refuse to watch this video.",1042156800,13,1295,5.29126213592233
384929,5,6301966074,"This is a rare Elvis Presley movie with outtakes (in the end credits). And there are some Elvis Presley movies with no end credits like Jailhouse Rock and Love Me Tender. This movie is Elvis Presley's last movie (if you count this and Elvis That's the Way It Is). Unlike Elvis That's the Way It Is, Elvis Presley is in concert in the begining or about to take the stage. But there are still questions that I would like to know. Why does Elvis get a guitar in the beginning of this movie and one other time in this movie, but not play in less he is going to go into a guitar break? How can singers/actors stand have light in thier faces if the house lights are not up? And even they have the light in thier faces during the of thier performance.",1040169600,,744,4.173611111111111
384930,5,6301966074,"After the success of ""That's the Way It Is"" in 1970, Elvis took his successful Vegas comeback out on the road, and rose to even greater peaks as a performer in the 1971-72 period. Over the course of the two years, significant change in his voice, repertoire, and personal life had transformed him into a very different, though no less dynamic entertainer.

1972's ""Elvis on Tour"" captures The King's 15 city tour in the Spring of 1972, held up by fans as some of the greatest performances of his career, giving legendary concerts in cities such as San Antonio, Hampton Roads, Greensboro and Richmond. Throughout the tour, he was in strong voice (albeit not quite as controlled or focus as in 1970), and his energy level was at a record high. The TCB band had also really hit their stride, and they never sounded tighter than they did during this period.

The film is broken up in different segments from town to town, interspersed with backstage footage of Elvis jamming on gospel numbers, traveling from town to town, and working on new recordings. A certain sadness permeates some of these sequences, especially the shot of Elvis traveling to Florida, looking out the window with a distant, reflective look on his face. The recording of ""Separate Ways"" is also a poignant scene, as his  marriage to Priscilla was crumbling and the lyrics clearly hit home. He has changed greatly since 1970: his hair is longer, his attire is gaudier, his voice has a different edge to it, and he's a bit puffy and pale in the face. In many ways, we are seeing early signs of Elvis's inner demons beginning to make themselves evident, though he still had enough control to keep them from overwhelming his public presence.

Despite these entertaining diversions, the music is center stage in the film, and there are some absolutely stunning renditions captured here: ""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" ""An American Trilogy,"" and ""You Gave Me a Mountain"" are vocal tour de forces with great dramatic flare; a rough early go at ""Burning Love"" is a lot fun; ""A Big Hunk O' Love"" rocks like nobody's business and leaves the original in the dust, and ""Lawdy Miss Clawdy"" is a down and dirty blues / gospel hybrid that is maybe my single favorite Elvis performance of his career.

""Elvis on Tour"" is a terrific rockumentary, showcasing The King in the midst of his last truly consistent slate of great performances. The dvd contains no extras, but it's still nice to finally have it to add our collection.",1039910400,3,2477,4.751162790697674
384931,5,6301966074,"The only major difference in Elvis' appearance between this film and 'That's The Way It Is' is that he doesn't have a tan, and his hair is longer.  Elvis is NOT heavier, and even if he is, it couldn't be by more than 5 pounds.  He is very lean in this, with a small waistline and overall striking figure.  His voice is beautiful, and I love to hear how it matured and improved over the years.  In this film, his voice is smooth, rich, and powerful.  The way he sings ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" knocks the original version right off the map.  His energy during the song ""Polk Salad Annie"" is startling, this version being markedly faster than the 1970 version.  The Stamps are spotlighted singing the moving gospel song ""Sweet Sweet Spirit"" that can move you to tears, especially seeing Elvis standing aside and admiring one of his heroes, J.D. Sumner.  ""I Got a Woman"",""Lawdy Miss Clawdy"",""Burning Love""...this film has no shortage of rockers.  Also we get to go into the recording studio with Elvis while he records the song ""Separate Ways"", a poignant ballad about lost love clearly selected to mirror Elvis life while he was separated from Priscilla.  We get to go backstage with Elvis and see his human side, he says ""I've never gotten over what they call stage fright, I go through it every show"".  A long interview with Elvis was recorded to accompany some of the non musical moments, and we hear the man himself telling his story.  They flash back to 1956 and show some of Elvis' early TV appearances to great effect.  It was filmed in stereo, and plays just fine in Dolby surround.  It's energetic, exciting, and contains some great songs.  A must for any Elvis fan or fan of live concerts.",1033344000,19,1700,4.601328903654485
