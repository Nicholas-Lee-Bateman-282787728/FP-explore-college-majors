8145290,5,B000IFRRIU,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Heartwarming is about what (at least me, anyway) we're in desperate need of at this moment. Yes, it is possible to make a movie that every single person can watch. The cinematography was truly world-class, the score perfectly supports the various scenes and the acting from everyone in this film delivers on every note and at every level, especially newcomer, Dominique Joelle - I did a little research on this production and discovered that not only was this her (Ms. Joelle's) very first acting role, but that she had only a handful of days to learn Arabic (with the coaching and teaching of and by, Ms. Lama Hezayen, who also played Aaseamah's mother - unbelievable work - just astounding!) And I really did fall in love with all the characters, but I want to single out both Ms. Fontaine (who played ""Jodi"") and Mr. Mattey (who played ""Jake""), because I'd seen other work over the years by them both and this chemistry between the two of them on screen was electric, simply; electric!

I highly recommend ""Finding John Smith"" to anyone seeking a story that truthfully shows that the real prospect of - ""True love"" can transcend the convention and that anything is possible, especially once we let ourselves be open to the possibilities.

Brava and Bravo!",1469145600,,1289,4.828054298642534
8145291,5,B000IFRRIU,part of this movie was filmed in my home town. I was very happy to finally get to see the movie,1410307200,2,95,3.5714285714285716
8145292,1,B000IFRRIU,"Pretty much all of the people that made this movie never got paid. Including this reviewer...using a loophole in the tax credits, the program in Iowa got shut down and they never got theirs, I guess.  And now it's on amazon prime video, obviously making a few cents here and there, yet still seen none of it.",1356480000,3,308,4.4035087719298245
8145293,2,B000IFRRIU,Got this being a Kerouac fan. Very disappointing. Tries to be a Kerouac type tale but fails. You can see the plot twist coming from miles away and it is a poor one at that.,1266624000,,172,3.942857142857143
