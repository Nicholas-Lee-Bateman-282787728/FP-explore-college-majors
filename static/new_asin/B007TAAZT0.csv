8521735,1,B007TAAZT0,"A possession takes ahold of a crime lord and his various criminal and sexual escapades in this poor excuse for a voodoo themed dark comedy. The acting (which is primarily by the ""filmmakers"") tend to be rather sour, the story is about as life-filled as a coma and the music pops up randomly and neither serves the story nor suits it well. Definitely deserving on The Bottom 100 for Worst Indie Films of All Time list in the future.",1505088000,,431,4.468354430379747
8521736,5,B007TAAZT0,"For a low-budget exploitation flick, and this is definitely an exploitation flick, the plot is remarkably cogent. The acting, especially from the female leads, is much better than one would normally expect.",1496016000,,206,5.46875
8521737,1,B007TAAZT0,"In Dallas, crime boss Fleetwood Deville (Charles Buchanan) is opposed by another pimp Marc Mercedes (Martin Ezelle)...and the writing doesn't get any better. It seems a prostitute (Jayde Kelley) has changed Fleetwood's manhood into a snake for being a bad actor and unable to deliver his lines. Fleetwood employs Devay Devine (Heather McCormick) former prostitute and now a hit-man to kill a guy and capture the girl and bring her back. That is basically the plot, but we go through a maze to get there complete with boring flashbacks.

The acting was horrible. Charles Buchanan has been banished from films after his performance. Heather McCormick had trouble keeping a straight face. She at least knew this was cheesy. The dialogue was idiotic. The sound was uneven having hollow places. The picture had a hip-hop soundtrack that seemed out of place. And who shoots a voodoo film in Dallas when New Orleans is so close?

8521741,3,B007TAAZT0,"from Brain Damage films.

This Urban Thriller has some cool moments with women hit-men,voodoo prostitutes( see title) and many,many female deaths shown .

Reminds this reviewer of all those exploitation films from the south in the '80s-Drugs,Pimps, pimped-out cars and those accents...Cajun and French and News Yauks.

The main villian, And let us add the pimps are victims too ( `Bout time on that one...Quentin Tarantino missed that boat),Is truly MEAN ,Capital `M'.

The only law enforcement to be seen is corrupt and has an ANDREW DICE CLAY persona.",1337817600,,553,5.179775280898877
