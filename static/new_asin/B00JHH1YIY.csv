6357930,5,B00JHH1YIY,I LUV this movie. I was laughing at many parts & I was truly shocked & surprised at the turn of events. I don't think anyone will b disappointed who watches this movie. It'll make U laugh & maybe cry but it's definitely a great time! I just happen to know the person who wrote the film & directed it & I know how much work he put into having it come out perfectly. I can truly say he has a winner here. I'm very sure everyone will LUV this movie as much as I do!,1409097600,2,462,3.8229166666666665

6357932,5,B00JHH1YIY,"A genuinely great film that embodies what indie film should be. Solid performances throughout, a few well placed twists, comedy, blood, craziness, bikinis, an eye patch, booze and women. What's not to love? It also happens to be extremely well executed, shot and cut to perfection, well written and downright badass. I truly enjoy this film for everything it is and everything it stands for in the landscape of independent film.",1409011200,2,428,5.042253521126761
6357933,1,B00JHH1YIY,"After getting passed the lame dialogue in the beginning, I decided to give this movie a chance at getting better. Wrong. Actually, I got through as much as I could take.  What could have been cleverly plotted was overflowing with a maniacal....well, no spoilers. Suggest you not waste your money.",1410220800,3,296,4.92
6357934,5,B00JHH1YIY,"Picked this up not sure what to expect. Saw it won a few festival awards so i thought i'd give it a try, Very glad i did. Thought some of the dialogue and banter between the girls was laugh out loud funny. In the second half the comedy stops (mostly). Thought the acting was very good for a B movie. Not sure why it's getting some hateful reviews on here. It's not a Hollywood blockbuster, just a great little independent gem. And i am in no way associated with the making of this movie..just a horror fanatic who likes to find "" Diamonds in the rough"". If you liked this movie check out "" Found"" as well.",1410134400,2,605,4.17948717948718
6357935,1,B00JHH1YIY,"This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.  I have to admit that it was so very bad that fast forward was not good enough.  At some point I just had to turn the thing off.
There is nothing redeemable about this trash it is full of trite lines and bad action.  I don't see how it could have gotten any good reviews.",1410048000,4,326,3.8358208955223883
6357936,1,B00JHH1YIY,"Unwatchable. I'm pretty sure everyone who reviewed this movie was involved in the making it or friends of those people. There are only 11 reviews, most being over 1 star so its possible that a few friends of the director, actors, and producers reviewed their friends film in order to generate sales, as friends do. Thats all I could think about afer the first 5 minutes of this abomination, because I'm thinking there's no other way this film could've gotten even 2 stars. It's about as funny as a network TV sitcom.  I was waiting to hear a laugh track behind every ""joke"". Great one liners like ""this party blows donkey farts..."" salty sarcasm like ""I hate to be Captain Obvious..."" And buzzwords like ""Cyber Stalker"" and ""flower garden (used to describe someones virginity)"" are coming at you like bullets when messy, ill-placed music isn't. I wanted to be really detailed about this review because I feel like I just wasted money on something very unnecessary. I'm really angry at myself because something said, ""don't do it"", but I did it anyway. Don't be like me. Go get yourself a burger, a bag of chips, or a drink at your local bar. Or, put the money into a savings account. Just don't get this movie.",1409961600,21,1210,4.627906976744186
6357937,1,B00JHH1YIY,So pretty much one of the worst movies I've ever paid for on Amazon. Not even a 'B' movie. The first 10 minutes shoulda been a clue...,1409961600,6,134,4.0
6357938,4,B00JHH1YIY,"Every once in a while, Ill run across a low-budget film that blows me away.  These flicks are few and far between, but they usually contain a solid plot, good acting, and enjoyable special effects.  Its been a while since Ive run across one of these gems, but Im happy to report I found one today.  SANCTUARY: QUITE A CONUNDRUM is the latest addition to this small list.  It is a dark horror-comedy that is sure to become a cult classic.  And while its budget was minimal (IMDB estimates it was $200,000), the quality of the film is not.

This film sucked me in from the beginning and did not let go.  It clocks in around 82 minutes in length, but that time flies by.  The credits were rolling before I realized it.

SANCTUARY: QUITE A CONUNDRUM is shot well and looks good overall.  The sound quality is a bit lacking here and there (some of the dialogue is hard to hear at points), but that is the ONLY negative I have about the film.  The production team did an excellent job with the money they had available.

The acting is very good, with Sasha Ramos and Erin Cline portraying the main characters.  I really enjoyed the performances given by each, however I have to admit two other actors stole the stage:  Joe Coffey, who portrays Dutch, and Catherine Trail, who plays the Bible-thumping mom, Thelma.  These two give outstanding showings with their roles and do an amazing job of bringing their characters to life.

The special effects in SANCTUARY: QUITE A CONUNDRUM are good as well.  Theres no major gore to speak of, but there are some nice doses of bloodshed that look pretty realistic.

The story, however, is the real winner here.  What starts off as a simple, small party turns into a nightmarish evening of chaos and terror.  I will not go into detail about what happens, but I will say I didn't expect the events to play out like they do.

SANCTUARY: QUITE A CONUNDRUM is a definite win for me, and I highly recommend you check it out.  Remember, though:  its a low-budget film, so don't expect Oscar-winning performances or such.  Theres a lot of heart and soul in this film, however, so you should find it an enjoyable experience nonetheless.  The film is available now.",1409788800,,2189,4.537084398976982
6357939,1,B00JHH1YIY,"This is the WORSE movie ive seen, acting terrible 40 yr old women acting as if HS,College,the way they spoke what was the point behind this film cant believe people gave this 5 stars! Wish never bought this a waste of $& time had 2 keep fast forwarding so terrilble,actually wanted the bad guy finish them all off.

6357940,5,B00JHH1YIY,"Sets a new standard for quality in the horror genre. This is intellectual pop culture dissection wrapped in bloody clothes, an excellent pondering on human error. It's also funny as hell.",1409270400,,187,5.064516129032258
6357941,5,B00JHH1YIY,"Tits, booze, blood, laughs, booze, plot twists and a script thatd make Quentin Tarantino erect! Strap in! Sanctuary is seriously such a wild ride...and if you don't fall in love with Harris you just aren't human ;)",1409097600,4,214,4.8108108108108105

Some may find the film a bit shocking but films should have an effect on us regardless of what it may be. Not every tale has a happy ending. Creativity should never be left out of any story teller's box of tools. I hope you all enjoy this film as much as I enjoyed working on it. THANK YOU!",1409097600,2,413,3.9879518072289155

8650852,4,B00JHH1YIY,"While the execution wasn't always good, the script of this movie was wonderful! As a whole it's kind of meh; but there are some scenes I found psychologically disturbing. It is worth a watch just for the nuggets!",1456790400,,212,4.605263157894737
8650853,5,B00JHH1YIY,"This story is nothing short of amazing, and brilliant. At first ""Sactuary, Quite A Conundrum"" kicks off with clich over-hypes that I was sure were going to annoy me. However ten minutes into the witty banter between the two lead female characters I was hooked. The face-paced dialog, timing and delivery of the actresses is spot on. The characters are an updated Valley Girl persona that feels relevant to a contemporary setting. Plus them b*tches was funny as hell! ""Quite A Conundrum"" starts off as a light, campy satire that, when the scene turns sour, gets dark real fast.

 Phillips is as a modern day John Hughes. His ability to both blend a satirical comedic air with an equal air of terror, without dragging the story down, is amazing. The story gets tense, then light-ish, before getting even more tense. ""Quite A Conundrum"" just offers a superb story from start to finish. The special effects are the standard for a film driven more by high drama and basic action sequences. The kill scenes stay pretty equal to micro-budget level but come off, through great direction and cinematography, as high production value scenes. The blood and deaths are sudden, blunt force moments that catch you in the headlights of a horrific moment taking place before your eyes. Even then the ability of the cast to effortlessly sway between such dark material and the lighter humorous stuff is a show to the casts' talent.

The soundtrack is pretty stellar. A mix of thriller sound effects and contemporary tunes offer a mix of suspenseful tension and terror, balanced by almost MTV video quality atmospheric slow mo situations. There are small moments that seem a bit contrived but none that altar the entertainment value or overall energy of the film. But really there has to be, honestly the fact that based on Thomas L. Phillips writing style, it is nothing short of amazing that a lot of this film doesn't fail. ""Sactuary, Quite A Conundrum"" is a masterpiece and instant cult classic that everyone should see-not just horror and camp cinema fans!",1431475200,2,2043,4.864942528735632
8650854,2,B00JHH1YIY,"Spoiler alert ! This is a strange little movie. The dialogue stood out mostly to me, or should I say stood out like a sore thumb. The writers try to be glib and hip, not matching the rest of the movie. The movie goes off on wild tangents, one girl decides to turn lesbian apparently mid movie, we have an religious overprotective mother, a friend you invite turns out to be a psycho and a naked dead fat guy is floating around in your pool from the early onset of the movie, which makes all the other reactions so out of place. Our resident psycho gags and binds dead guys wife to a chair, and this seems to bother them more than his body in the pool or his junk they so often reference.  Floating through this is a young guy with a priapism which also adds into the distracting mix. The acting wasn't bad, just the dialogue made it sound like they were trying too hard. Give it a little credit for being somewhat original and attractive actresses and actors, but it was just uncomfortable to watch at times.",1427587200,2,1008,4.3052631578947365
8650855,3,B00JHH1YIY,"Dark comedy horror b-movie. No real scares, but definitely an interesting plot with a solid cast of actors. If you are a fan of dark comedy horror, I would absolutely recommend this one.",1416528000,2,186,4.666666666666667

8650858,5,B00JHH1YIY,"There are all sorts of darkness, but for my money one of the most painful and excruciating is that which can ooze out of the sexual affairs of the truly wicked. I remember the first time I watched Dangerous Liaisons I was simply floored. I didn't have words to describe the revolting yet treacly sweet thrill of watching people be so lustful and hateful toward one another all at the same time. Later my cousin told me that someone had described the movie as worms burrowing about in a wedge of fine French cheese.
This is a worms-in-cheese movie all the way. The behavior of the people in this movie is extreme, despicable, perverse, inconsiderate, borderline psychotic and, I suspect, not too different from what really goes on behind the bedroom doors in most of America. There's never been a less sympathetic crew of victims this side of V/H/S, and yet when they start getting attacked the script amazingly evokes not scorn for them but compassion. Nasty and powerful and very very complex, so that explains why all the simple minded haters out there giving this masterpiece just one star.
Haters. Poo.",1410480000,3,1106,4.765625
8650859,1,B00JHH1YIY,"This is the second film that I've watched from Midnight Releasing. The first (whose name I won't mention) was so bad that bleach could not have cleaned the scum it left on my eyes. While this one isn't quite as bad, it will reach the bottom of the barrel when it comes to horror films.

The problems are visible right from the start when we see an older, fat man with an eye patch in bed with a younger woman who doesn't seem the least bit interested in what is going on. So why is this a problem? I have no difficulty in having an older man and younger woman together. The problem is that there is no way that a guy who looks like this is going to find himself with an attractive young woman. To hear that he's married and this is an affair makes it even more unbelievable.

But that's not the only problem here. The other problem is that the woman in question is supposed to be a college age student living in her father's home. While this actress (I'll save to disgrace of naming her here) may be attractive enough there is no way that she qualifies for college age. A quick search online found the smallest of bios that didn't include her age. From the looks of things I'd say late twenties. Before anyone goes off about misogynistic tendencies and sexism I'm not slamming her for her appearance. I'm just saying no, she doesn't look 19 years old. Neither does the actress playing her best friend.

In any event she, her roommate and her sister plan on having a big party that night where she plans to hook up with her roommate's best friend, her sister might be having her first encounter with her boyfriend and her roommate will continue to jump her boyfriend each moment she can. Things seem to go along fine until the big, bald guy from the start of the movie shows up naked and kills himself, falling into the backyard pool. This being her father's house (and the man in question being a staff member of her father's law firm) they can't let the body remain or call the police.

As the saying goes, the best laid plans... Things go from bad to worse as the wife of the dead man storms in. The boyfriend disappears, leaving everyone behind to take care of the problem. The young sister's boyfriend gets completely wasted prior to the suicide and ends up walking around with in a perpetual state of excitement (think perfect add for Viagra). And then something happens that makes it even worse.

So is there anything good here? Well perhaps. Joe Coffy, who plays the intended hookup for the main character, turns in a decent performance. I would love to see him in something else other than this movie. Again, he looks far too old for the part. Between the receding hairline and the fact that he's 32 years old in real life, he should not be playing someone involved with a college age girl.

As a fan of horror films I can tell you that this one is not worth your time. Keep in mind this is from someone who can appreciate horror films that fall into the category of ""so bad they're good"". The bad acting, bad cinematography, bad story and more make this one to avoid.",1410393600,7,3076,4.387719298245614
