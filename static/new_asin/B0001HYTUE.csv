8047099,1,B0001HYTUE,I was so anxious to receive this DVD to help my U6 girls. It has never played. I tried two different DVD  players and even on a computer. I would be more upset if it didn't cost just .99,1447632000,,186,3.769230769230769
8047100,1,B0001HYTUE,"""Baby Soccer"" has very little instructional or entertainment value.  It's actually boring for young and old.  A person could take their video camera down to their local AYSO games/leagues and have a more entertaining and inspirational video than what ""Baby Soccer"" offers.",1244851200,,272,5.4523809523809526
8047101,5,B0001HYTUE,"I bought these DVDs for my nephews and they loved them.  My son, who is now 2, has been in love with these DVDs since 18 months.  We will be lucky if he doesn't wear the DVD out.  This is teh PERFECT child introduction to sports.  If your child is like mine and enjoys sports, he/she will love this DVD.  Our son has learned so much.  I know give one of these DVD in the Tiny Tots Sports series to every child we go to a party for.  We have received 100% positive feedback from the parents about how much thier child loves it and where could they get more.  The best part has been watching my son run and kick the soccer ball and telling us what he is doing.  He is picking up the basics about the sport while learning how to have fun!  Thank you Tiny Tots.. you give my husband and I a good 30 minutes of fun and education for our son every day!  I can't wait for spring so he can get outside and play again!",1202256000,2,909,3.9395604395604398
8047102,4,B0001HYTUE,"My kids (boy 3, girl 4) want to watch this all the time.  They love the travels of Sammy the soccer ball.  My wife says they ask kick the ball all the time.  We now have one broken lamp.  It's fun.  I played soccer in college...and this is a great way to get them started.",1086566400,4,272,3.8727272727272726
