As for this Godzilla film? It's junk. Weird story and has no essence like the Japanese films have to offer.  I doubt America will ever make a quality Godzilla film. Want to see a great modern day Godzilla film? Get Shin Godzilla.",1535241600,,397,4.739130434782608
8753716,5,B01CQ75NII,"Pacific rim was superb in the conflict between the human determination versus aliens and their conquest to acquire our resources.  Humans will never surrender.
Godzilla should have been filmed in less dark film technique  but highly enjoyable as alpha good guy monster vs bad guy monster.",1524441600,,288,5.239130434782608

8753720,5,B01CQ75NII,"This is a double feature featuring two very similar films in the classic genre of Toho giant monster movies like Godzilla or King Kong. In Pacific Rim, we get a Shogun Warriors or Power Rangers approach in that humanity is now tired of getting trashed by giant monsters so we decide the only logical thing. Let's build giant robots to fight back! OUT...STAND...ING special effects and CGI/graphics! This is not classic special effects by any means! EXCELLENT animation is an understatement. In Godzilla, we get a return to a Godzilla that more closely resembles the classic ones from around the 1990's and 80's(Godzilla vs Ghidorah, etc.) and not the abomination that looked more like a giant iguana. Scientists have unearthed strange objects that appear to be alive. Two objects break open to reveal two gigantic creatures from Earth's prehistoric past that start tearing cities apart worldwide! Suddenly, on radar in the distance, the readout shows a gigantic object over 400 feet tall moving towards the creatures at high speed through the oceans. Godzilla... has...returned. An all out dinosaur sized brawl for animal supremacy ensues! These movies contain a lot of action and thrills to satisfy the science fiction fan in all of us. Both are rated PG-13 for mass destruction and animal violence(not abuse). Enjoy!",1498694400,,1318,5.134883720930232
