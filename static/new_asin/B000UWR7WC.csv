8215347,5,B000UWR7WC,"After some historical background and interviews, this has the archival footage of the first Atlas launch.  The video quality is good.  The first test failure served to prove the concept of Bossart's ""steel balloon"" design, as the rocket undergoes enormous unplanned stress under power, and the air frame did not fail.",1340236800,,317,5.196078431372549
8215348,1,B000UWR7WC,I have purchased this DVD 3 times and each time a two minute video unrelated to the title has been packaged under the Atlas ICBM title. I have returned 2 DVD and I received very prompt service from Amazon with replacements and refunds. However I cannot review this DVD as I would like at this time until the problem is solved.,1239408000,,326,4.360655737704918
