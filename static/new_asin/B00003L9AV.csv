1331261,4,B00003L9AV,I Love this show so much I watch it on Bravo all time. Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepard are hilarious and such a good team. I wish that the audio commentary had included Cybill Shepard as well it would've felt complete  with all the whole team there. But this is a cute movie Bruce and Cybill  sizzle.,962064000,,300,4.245614035087719
1331262,4,B00003L9AV,"It was so much fun to watch a show that I fell in love with when I was 10yrs old.  The dialogue between Maddie and David was and still is inventive.  No other television show since, has compared to its witty and  lascivious humor that was so uniquely expressed by Cybill Shepherd and  Bruce Willis.  I was disappointed that Cybill Shepherd was not a part of  the commentary.  I enjoyed listening to Bruce Willis and Glenn Caron, but  Cybill is the other half of the show. Maybe on the next Moonlighting  release this will be rectified.  Still, it's a great coke and popcorn  movie.",955324800,2,581,4.490384615384615

1331264,1,B00003L9AV,"I was hoping for better, I love Moonlighting, but as usual a third party has handled the transfer. DVD is great if the encoding is done correctly, but once again on this DVD it has not. It is not good enough that any non  moving part of the picture ""freezes"" very noticibly constantly  throughout the DVD, I would rather watch the VHS copy. And I know this is  not only happening on TV Shows, some of the movies are just as bad. If we  the public, just accept this, nothing will be done and DVD`s will carry on  coming out at this poor level. I have shown this disc to many friends, some  of which couldn`t watch it all the way through because the constant  background moving/frozen/moving/frozen made them feel ill. 10/10 for Bruce  & Cybill, 1/10 for the transfer :(",952560000,19,768,4.397163120567376
1331265,4,B00003L9AV,"I had seen the black and white episode in the past and thought that this was it.  That one I would rate 5 stars and ""they"" had better put it on DVD soon because it was both hilarious and clever.  That may have  been the first episode of the regular series.  I bought this one for a  Valentine's Day present and we both laughed at a lot of it.  Of course,  that meant I had to buy a DVD player too because we didn't own one.  I've  been watching the series frequently on the satellite dish even though I  never had time to watch much of it when it originally aired.  I'm  definitely happy with the purchase.",950659200,2,606,4.085470085470085
1331266,4,B00003L9AV,"Fifteen years after I wanted to be David Addison and realized I could only watch David Addison, they release the Pilot on DVD. I want to be David again but my wife won't let me! Seriously- the highlight of the DVD, which  is not one of my favorite episodes (Atomic Shakespeare) is the audio  commentary with Glenn Caron and Bruce Willis. They share fond memories of  working on Moonlighting, and remind us how, culturally speaking, huge the  show was. They also comment on other episodes, guest stars, and make a list  of THEIR favorite episodes. And Bruce tells nice stories about the fourth  season! The only problem is the audio commentary disappears for a long time  during the last twenty minutes. I wanna know how they filmed all that stuff  on the clock!",950054400,,761,4.669172932330827

1331268,3,B00003L9AV,"Well, a bruce willis classic has been released on DVD. The whole Pilot has been remastered but I was disepointed that the sound was in MONO. Other than that, you can also choose the see some very rare Bruce Willis  Sreentests which he has a lot of hair on! and also a screentest with  another guy who odetioned for the role of ""David Addison"" who  I've never seen in my life! and Plus , it was great to hear Bruce Willis  and Glen Caron's thoughts about the pilot and the series in the audio  commentary. Defenatly for a Bruce Willis Or a ""Moonlighting"" fan  to add to their collection!",948844800,11,586,4.330275229357798
1331269,2,B00003L9AV,"Starting thinking about this old series , so ordered the pilot. Wow, how in the world did anyone ever think this was so good, it should be a series from this. I trust the series was better. Story was flimsy, stuff happened that made no sense and although beautifully dressed and stunning to look at, Shepard was just awful.  Lots of  old tv series out there worth a re visit...this is not one.",1364688000,,393,4.36986301369863
1331270,5,B00003L9AV,"I love David and Maddie! I just got it yesterday and watched it The first Thing I noticed this Movie is in stereo unlike the one included in the set is mono. This transfer isn't as bad as some people said Maybe on HD TVs and computers but it looks fine on older TV sets. The booklet that came with this movie should of been included with the Season one and two set since it has an empty folder where a booklet should of went.

1331271,4,B00003L9AV,I wanted to get this DVD cause I liked the show but when I noticed that the pilot by itself is more than the whole Season 1 I said forget it.  Some idiots on here are asking $41 for it new that is so crazy high I'm not even gonna comment on it.  I want to get just this episode for myself but its gonna have to come WAY down in price.  Under $10 at least.,1195948800,,355,3.6447368421052633
1331272,5,B00003L9AV,"SEASON TWO AND THREE STARTS WITH THE PILOT,SO WHY BY THE PILOT IF YOU DONT HAVE  TO????????",1138579200,6,91,4.352941176470588
1331273,5,B00003L9AV,"With the first two season of ""Moonlighting"" now out on DVD, the demand for just the pilot episode will be considerably less than before.  But there is still something special about our introduction to Dave and Maddie, especially since it is more fun to remember the beginning of the series than to recall how it all ended.  Written by Glen Gordon Caron and directed by Robert Butler, the ""Moonlighting"" pilot aired as a two-hour television movie on March 3, 1985 (in retrospect the ""in like a lion, out like a lamb"" idea certainly fits this show).  The chief charms here were both the amount of dialogue that Caron was cramming into the script and the sparks that were flying between the two stars.  Little did we know there would be much more of both in the future.  At this point we were simply excited by the idea that not having flies on you is a good thing and that if you are being questioned by the police bringing a pair of sunglasses or ordering pizza with your one phone call would be good things.

Maddie Hayes (Cybil Shepherd) is a famous ex-model known as the ""Blue Moon Girl,"" because of the ads she did for a shampoo.  When her accountant embezzles her fortune, Maddie has to sell off the few failing businesses she owned as tax write offs.  One of those is the City of Angels Detective Agency, run by David Addison (Bruce Willis), who wants to keep his job, his staff and his company car(s) (not necessarily in that order).  So he tries to talk Maddie into forming a partnership.  The only problem is that, at least at first, they cannot stand each other.  He thinks she is a ""blonde piece of fluff"" and she considers him a ""sissy fighter.""  So the question is can they make it through the pilot without falling in love with each other.  The catalyst becomes the case they stumbled on when a dying man produces a broken watch from his mouth and slips it onto Maddie's wrist before he drops dead, courtesy of a knife in the back.  Whether she wants to or not, Maddie Hayes is going to find out what it means to be a detective.

When I watched the pilot again for the first time in about a decade I kept thinking that there was something a little strange about it, but I simply dismissed such thoughts because like any pilot the actors are just starting to find their characters.  Then it suddenly dawned on me why the episode sounded strange but still looked great after twenty years: Dave and Maddie are talking to slow in this pilot.  At the time we were all marveling at how fast they talked on ""Moonlight,"" but they are not yet up to warp speed in this first effort.  This was also before the show become an example of postmodernism, primarily through its self-reflexivity, but even from the start you can see that this series is a dramedy.  Remember, this was a show that was being nominated for Emmys as a dramatic series while being considered a comedy by the Golden Globes.  Both, of course, were right.  Today the idea that ""Designing Women"" or ""Gilmore Girls"" are situation comedies even though they are hour-long programs is not a radical idea, but it sure was twenty years ago.

In terms of the supporting cast in the pilot, Allyce Beasley as Agnes DiPesto is only on the cusp of becoming endearing because besides answering the phone in rhyme and having a bucket fall on her head she is really just background in this one.  Among the guest stars the two who stand out are Dennis Lipscomb as Simon, whose slow and measured cadences stand out quite well in marked contrast to the speedy delivery of the two stars.  Plus he appreciates the finesse of the word ""duress.""  Then there is Jim McKrell as Dr. Spellner, Maddie's dinner date, who is wonderfully oblivious that his smooth condescension is not going over well with anybody, let alone Maddie.  For familiar faces the guy with the blond Mohawk, whose name is apparently Klaus Gunter, is Dennis Stewart from ""Grease,"" while Allistair, Simon's Man, is Brian Thompson, who goes on to be Luke and then the Judge on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (the television series, not the movie).  Die hard fans of the series are going to want the entire show on DVD, but for those who just want to remember how ""Moonlighting"" was such a breath of fresh air, this pilot episode certainly suffices.",1119052800,17,4259,4.533333333333333
1331274,4,B00003L9AV,There's no way I would pay more than $20 for this dvd.  I will wait to purchase this.

1331276,5,B00003L9AV,"I hope its true that Moonlighting is FINALLY coming to DVD. It seems every crappy show on TV is now out on DVD. I can't stand most of the garbage currently on TV. Moonlighting is one of the few shows that I used to never miss. Even when it went into reruns. Havent seen it in reruns in a few years now. I understand they have some great outtakes and im hoping they include every single piece of video they have in the DVD box sets. Moonlighting was laugh out loud funny and other than the clothes they wore, (which looking back now they probably laugh at) the jokes and the writing was not ""dated"" material and people will still find funny today.

I'll be one of the first in line to buy this box set when it finally comes out.",1110499200,4,727,4.156028368794326

1331279,5,B00003L9AV,This show was the best show ever created on tv. I'd love to see a reunion of it really soon. I love maddie & david & the sexuall tension they shared on the show. I especilly loved the banter. I know the scrip of every show by heart. I love the crazy banter. They were so so so cool. Maddie was & is so so so beautifull. David was so handsome back then when he had hair. If he wore a toupe he could still pull it off. I hope to see them back on together real sonn.

I like Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd, they make a great couple on tv.  This show is completely unpredictable and will make you laugh through every episode.  I think its probably my favorite television show ever.  I would pay any price for all the seasons on dvd.  I really hope that they decide to release this whold series on dvd as they seem to be doing with every other classic tv show out there.  This should have been the first one in my opinion.  If you like clever humor, exciting plots, and a great ongoing love story, this is the series for you.  Too bad you can only get the pilot!",1027555200,2,711,4.333333333333333

The plot a pretty model of shampoos(Sheperd) needs the help of a witty private eye(Willis) to discover the strange getaway of all her money.
What they discover is murder,kidnapping and a bunch of diamonds of great worth.
I haven't seen this pilot in my country when it was released on Tv.
I wonder for more episodes and the transfer of more in the next seasons of the show with the Dipesto couple.
Good transfer but they should include more episodes.",1022544000,,503,4.7272727272727275
1331282,5,B00003L9AV,"I think the pilot's great and the series is even better. The series builds on itself and taking episodes in isolation (like the VHS box set does) is the wrong approach.

1331284,4,B00003L9AV,"Watching the first episode of Moonlighting on DVD really did bring back the memories. The understated chemistry that was evident between Willis and Shepherd is here in abundance, even in this, the Pilot episode. All the elements that made Moonlighting what is was are also here - the rhyming Ms. Dipesto, the overlapping dialogue and the wonderful Moonlighting theme, which brings a lump to my throat every time I hear it. The DVD, while not significantly updating the quality of the actual episode itself, includes screen tests and an audio commentary which are great additions, showing that both Willis and Glenn Gordon Carron still have a genuine affection for the craft of the show that was Moonlighting.

1331287,5,B00003L9AV,"Due to my very limited English ability, without any interpretation or subtitles, I can't fully understand all the humor, still hilarious and  great fun. ( I've visit "" Moonlighting, on the web "" and ""  Blue Moon Banter "" to put all the details together, the Episode Guide,  plot summary, witty dialogue, etc. They did help a lot, thanks for the hard  endeavor. You people are so great ! ).
Time has prove it. ""  Moonlighting "" never aged after long 15 years, and it's new millennium  now. Glenn Gordon Caron must be the most humorous writer in Show Business.  Wish I can see more  drama related to him. And the spar/ love/ hate  relationship  between Cybill and Bruce, on and off screen, provide best  gossip, made me laugh out loud all the time. You must admit, Bruce took the  glamour from heroines in all of his films, Cybill is the only one who may  share the equal spotlight, 50-50, not overwhelmed by Bruce's maniacal star  quality. And Cybill wasn't even a comedienne before "" Moonlighting  "" ( I guess ? For I have no idea who she was before the show.  )
Though I enjoy, love and miss the show so much, only personal.  There's  barely no chance for it to be aired in my country again.  And I may say I  haven't seen Cybill for almost a decade. ( Except one TV- movie on HBO. )  We didn't even have "" Cybill Show "" here. What a country! I'm  miserable. Thank God, I found this DVD on Amazon, and it's great fun. It's  only a beginning, the "" Best "" has yet to come. Please release  more episodes, like "" Atomic  Shakespeare "", "" A Womb With A  View "", "" The Dream Sequence...."", "" Symphony in  Knocked Flat "".....and the final climax "" Lunar Eclipse "". I  anticipate them desperately. There's no other TV  shows or a movie in any  delicacy, similar, even feels like "" Moonlighting "". Bruce was  never more attractive than David Addison, and I'd love to see more Cybill.  Please any company release more Cybill's drama, on DVD format, I'll buy  them from Amazon. And do more comedies, please, Cybill. You've got talent  to make people laugh. ( I love "" Chances Are "" as well. )

1331288,5,B00003L9AV,"Moonlighting is an important series not only because it did so much for the lead actor's careers, but also because it was such a fantastic concept.  And for a few golden seasons, the promise of that concept delivered.  The  pilot episode is a perfect example of how the show could easily segue from  screwball comedy to crime drama and back again.  Bruce and Cybill are cute  and funny, especially when they're fighting each other, and for a while the  City of Angels becomes a playground of adventure and intrigue.",966816000,,515,4.719101123595506
