487306,5,6302641829,"After the success of ""A Southern Yankee"", it was just a no-brainer to set up another collaboration between star Red Skelton and comedy legend Buster Keaton (the latter working as a gagman at MGM). They bore some delicious fruit with ""The Yellow Cab Man"" (1950). Here, Red plays a goof who invents some wacky but effective ""safety"" devices, the latest of which is ""Elastiglass"", an unbreakable glass material. To help promote his inventions, he agrees to drive a Yellow Cab for awhile, resulting in a new career that's far from perfect. This was yet another comedy that's practically Red from start to finish. From the opening credits of a bandaged Red in the hospital (the cast is cleverly displayed ON a cast..get it?) to a wild climax on a model home on a turntable spinning out of control, it's one inspired comic moment after another. In between are some memorable bits: Red's first day driving the cab, which disasterously & hilariously piles one laugh on top of another; and a flashback in which Red reprises his ""mean widdle kid"" character, using his gifts as a pantomimist.
Naturally, there's a backdrop of menace as crooks--a lawyer & psychiatrist--try to steal the Elastiglass formula, and go as far as trying to frame Red for murder. I think the only flaw is that, for a comedy, it feels ""cluttered"", as if it needed to be simplified. Other than that, it's first rate in gags & story, and Red, as usual, gives 110%, so that's really what matters.
Definitely one to add to the Skelton collection!",1344124800,8,1506,4.751908396946565
487307,5,6302641829,"Skelton plays an inept inventor who, against all odds, comes up with a million dollar invention, elasti-glass. A sort of rubberized
flexible glass. He gets a job with the Yellow Cab Co with the aim of selling it to them and the car industry in general.
But he is sabotaged by some unsavory types who want to steal his invention. It`s a classic comedy romp full of excellent sight gags

SYNOPSIS--
Accident-prone inventor Red Pirdy (Skelton) is struck by a cab at a busy L.A. intersection. Red meets with company claims adjuster Ellen Goodrich (DeHaven) and is about to admit the accident was his own fault when interloping lawyer Martin Creavy (Arnold) tries to convince Red to sue for a large cash amount.

Red describes his new bendable glass to Ellen and Creavy; both express interest in it. Red decides to offer the formula to Ellen and Yellow Cab, but the attorney will stop at nothing to obtain the secret process. He blackmails a cab co. executive to sabotage Red's demonstration of the new Elastiglass by switching it for the breakable kind.

As a result of the botched demo, Ellen is demoted to the lost & found dept. Red takes a cab driver job, hoping for a second shot at selling his invention, but he still has the scheming attorney to contend with. Creavy and a confederate (Slezak) may even commit murder to gain control of the Elastiglass formula!

487347,1,6302641829,Red Skelton is a favorite comedian here but this movie did not do him justice.  A mediocre script and not funny jokes and stunts rendered it tedious to watch.  He did so much better with his own show and in supporting roles.  This reminds me a little too much of the three stooges humor and that is hard to deal with for some people.  The movie itself is grainy owing to its age which provides no incentive to enjoyment.,1389225600,,420,4.2784810126582276

7828341,3,6302641829,"There are some excellent old Red Skelton movies available;  alas, this is not one of them.

Many jokes fall flat, for example:  in one scene, Red turns off a lamp that Miss Goodrich (Gloria De Haven) had just turned on, explaining: ""You see that sends off a terrific amount of heat to the ceiling.  My sprinklers are adjusted to a very low set-off temperature.  The last time I turned that lamp on, my sofa got so wet, that every time I laid down to take a nap, I sort of drifted off to sleep. . . .""

Generally the sight gags are so-so and predictable.  In another scene, Red is about to throw a baseball at the windscreen of a mockup of a cab with the taxi company's president sitting behind the wheel.  You expect the windshield to break and the president to be angry - it does and he is - no surprise.

There is one sight gag, however, that pulls a switch on you.  The setup:  the hem of Miss Goodrich's dress gets caught between two counterrotating rollers . . . setting you up for an expectation that her dress is about to be ripped off, but that is not what happens - the gag's payoff is unexpected and silly. . . .
