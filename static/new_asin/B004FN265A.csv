8428041,5,B004FN265A,I watched this movie in a community college class years ago and have never forgotten it or how it made me feel. This movie made ne decide to pursue my education until I have the kind of career that will allow me to help these young women in India the same way the activists in the movie do. It is a real eye opener about what we take for granted in countries where human rights are more respected and education is available for mostly everyone.,1460937600,,444,4.235294117647059
