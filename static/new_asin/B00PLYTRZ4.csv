6817787,4,B00PLYTRZ4,It was good.,1431388800,,12,3.3333333333333335
6817788,2,B00PLYTRZ4,"The only reason I didn't give this a one star is because the mystery is good. Other than that, the constant arguing and fighting between the siblings made this not even worth watching. It's too bad, this really had potential.",1430784000,,225,4.65
6817789,5,B00PLYTRZ4,Great!,1430092800,,6,6.0
6817790,5,B00PLYTRZ4,"I don't know why this film is rated so poorly. It has a pretty intriguing storyline and will definitely keep the kids and adults
interested. Yes I've never been a fan of dubbing, But as far as family friendly flicks are concerned I am able to get around it.
Its pretty rare these days to find decent kids fare and I think this film is of a higher caliber than most. Production values are quite
high and some thought was put into the dialogue as well. I don't believe enough decent kids films are being made in America these days.
I think this has been the case for quite some time. Films like Candleshoe with jodie foster and other disney classics haven't been produced for nearly forty odd years/ Let's face it many cartoons or other kids films are nearly unwatchable from an adult standpoint.
Now that my kids aren't toddlers anymore, I have to search far and wide for fresh, original material. I am thankful the Europeans and some other countries are stepping up to the plate. Well done!",1428537600,7,990,4.5055555555555555
6817791,1,B00PLYTRZ4,"Horrible acting
Horrible costumes
Horrible plot

The voices are so far off from the movement of the mouths, it seemed like a REALLY BAD OLD CHINESE KUNG FU MOVIE.

You will never, ever get your wasted time back, even if you live forever.",1425600000,4,237,4.488372093023256
6817792,1,B00PLYTRZ4,"Story is good, but the English dub voiceover is so bad it's impossible to watch. English is not spoken that way neither by Americans, nor the British. Next time hire some American actors who can speak English the way it is spoken. Clearly some Germans who crammed in a few English lessons were hired to do the English voiceover. Would have been better to keep film in German and do English subtitles.",1425081600,2,400,4.569444444444445
6817806,5,B00PLYTRZ4,"I wonderful movie for the family, with a delightful mystery.",1481587200,,60,5.1
6817807,5,B00PLYTRZ4,"Lovingly adapted from a classic German childrens novel, this is a great film to be enjoyed by the whole family, about a seclusive young boy who struggles to unravel the death of his enigmatic girl cousin forty years ago. Mysterious, suspenseful, spooky, funny and sad, with wonderful actors, beautiful music and a tinge of nostalgia and melancholy which is very rarely found in movies of this kind. Do yourselve a favour and watch it with subtitles. Unforgettable!",1477267200,,464,5.038961038961039
6817808,5,B00PLYTRZ4,"I really enjoyed the mystery behind the house, and the uncle. It was a surprise ending. Good family movie.",1476230400,,106,4.631578947368421

6817812,1,B00PLYTRZ4,the timing of the video is off majorly sometimes it doesnt even match their mouths with what was said.. Terrible quality,1458345600,,120,4.761904761904762

6817817,4,B00PLYTRZ4,"Nicely done, cute story.  The voice over from the original German took getting used to, but the quality of the production made up for it.",1447027200,,137,4.48

6817819,4,B00PLYTRZ4,"I found this to be an engaging and captivating family movie that held my attention from beginning to end. I believe both preteens and adults will enjoy the suspense and mystery as Victor tries to piece together all the clues to the untimely death of a young girl forty years earlier. The plot quickly builds as Victor and his family moves into his uncle's house, and the boy begins to realize there is some mystery concealed within the house waiting to be solved, although no one will listen to or believe him. There actually is more than one mystery to be resolved, and you will find them a challenge to figure out before Victor does. The tension and suspense build throughout the story as the boy begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together and realizes he's not the only one looking for the answers. Yes, as other reviewers have already pointed out, the actors' voices are dubbed, but I did not find it badly done or to be a distraction at all as some have stated.",1441670400,6,971,4.46067415730337

6817822,3,B00PLYTRZ4,"The voiceover is terrible but my kids (12 & 10) still liked it. They enjoyed the mystery, the action and suspense and it wasn't too scary to keep them up at night. It was a clean family movie once you look past the mis-matched mouths/voices.",1433721600,,241,4.377777777777778
6817823,4,B00PLYTRZ4,"This is in German but the English voice over really isn't that bad. Pretty good movie especially considering the voice over. Even my 13 yr old enjoyed it. Slightly spooky for younger ones, but didn't seem to phase my 9 yr old boy even in the parts I thought might. Good family movie for all to enjoy",1433376000,5,299,4.2631578947368425
6817824,2,B00PLYTRZ4,"I really wish I had read the reviews before we downloaded this movie.  The trailer was so good, but we couldn't get through the first 30 minutes of the movie.  The dubbed voices were just too distracting.  Extremely disappointed!!",1433203200,,230,4.846153846153846

8688671,4,B00PLYTRZ4,"My daughter and I watched this movie together.  It is dubbed, from German to English, however the story is well done and she really enjoyed the movie.  If you don't mind the actors mouths being a little out of sync with the dialogue, then this is a great kid friendly movie with just the right amount of excitement!",1505088000,,315,4.413793103448276

8688675,4,B00PLYTRZ4,"Very cool movie. It is dubbed in English, but they did a pretty good job, and you do not have to try to read sub titles! A fun movie for grade school and middle school kids. It has a nice twisty plot, with mystery and surprises, and an ending we did not expect. ( Good ending, by the way. )
There are lots of clues so the viewer can try to solve the mystery themself, and along with Victor ( the hero boy ). Definitely worth the price, and one We will recommend to friends! Cheers !",1491436800,,482,3.979381443298969
