8604794,5,B000CDHRRE,"First time independent filmmakers Matt Brooks and Phil Thomas put forth a noble effort on Shadow Brook.  The writing and directing pair make do with the very small budget they have and produce a very watchable, entertaining, spooky, and sometimes humorous tale of supernatural occurences and the trail of murder that preceded them.  If anything is worth the view it would have to be the black and white flashback scenes that illustrate the bloody history of the serial killer known as, Robert Baker.  I highly reccommend this film for the indy movie lover and casual movie fan alike.",1180483200,,583,4.928571428571429
