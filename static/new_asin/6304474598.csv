7872718,5,6304474598,"This video, focusing on a group of crocodiles living in the Grumeti river where it is crossed by an annual wildebeest migration, provides a wealth of information about how crocodiles live, while still being enjoyable and entertaining.
This particular group of crocodiles, by virtue of the feast provided when the wildebeest migration passes through, grows to particularly large size.  They still start out small, though - so the video is able to capture the entire crocodile life cycle, from foot long insect eating babies to antelope munching giants weighing over a ton.
While there are plenty of shots of these startlingly quick predators using their huge jaws to eat, other parts of the lifecycle also get plenty of time.  For example, there's a segment on a crocodile nesting beach that not only shows how the crocodiles guard their eggs and care for their young - some of which become prey to other predators - but also shows how a range of other animals take advantage of the crocodiles' presence to provide a safer environment for their own nests.
I got this video as part of a set that I bought primarily for other videos about more popular mammals - but this one has become one of my favorites.  If you do have some of those other videos, it can be interesting to contrast the behavior of lions and other mammals with these reptilian predators.  And at the present price of less than [dollar amount], this video is an incredible bargain!",1062547200,3,1446,4.772
