7948505,3,B00005OA7Y,"A tuneful but forgotten score by Lloyd Weber.  Deserves revival and would be a good choice for smaller regional theatres.  The problem is that the DVD is in a format that cannot be played by most North American DVD players.  Fortunately my media viewer software supports a number of formats and I was able to watch it on my monitor.  How widely this option would be available, I do not know.",1464048000,,391,4.464788732394366
7948506,3,B00005OA7Y,"I'm a fan of the ""Jeeves & Wooster"" stories, but this musical never manages to reach their level of wit and hilarity. The film is extraordinarily dull - I found myself pausing the video and wandering off to do other things as my attention waned. Some of the songs are charming and, for ALW, unexpectedly lovely while others are just pointless exercises plot-decorating. The director has chosen to have the actors play caricatures rather than characters and that style, frankly, is best left to the holiday Pantomime, where it belongs.",1443052800,,534,4.944444444444445
7948507,5,B00005OA7Y,"I will come right out and confess that I'm not an Andrew Lloyd Webber fan. His music is too derivative and the productions too elaborate.

That being said, I love this little musical! I've loved Bertie Wooster and Jeeves ever since I discovered P.G. Wodehouse many years ago, and this production lives up to the sly humor and ridiculous situations that abound in the stories and novels about Jeeves and Wooster.

Jeeves in this case (Martin Jarvis) is perfectly cast in a non-singing, non-dancing role (except for a wee bit toward the end). His tone of voice, facial expressions and especially his grand gestures as he literally stage-manages the whole show give the viewer an exact picture of just who Jeeves is: as he puts it, a *deus ex machina*. What a brilliantly concise description of Jeeves!

Bertie (John Scherer) is a little more urbane and good-looking than I expect Bertie to be, but just as clueless and devoted to the Code of the Woosters as the Bertie of the written word. His voice is quite good, and his delivery excellent. He is the star of the show and is on stage almost every minute. I really wonder why this is the first time I've ever heard of this fine performer.

The supporting cast is also good, and they really brought this absurd condensation of several Jeeves/Wooster adventures to life.

I enjoyed all of the music, but my favorite is ""Travel Hopefully"". It exemplifies Bertie's optimistic and good-naturedly naive character and the stage business of the cobbled-together ""car"" is hilarious.

What puzzles me is the fact that this production, consisting of a cast from Pittsburgh and produced in Toronto is available only in Region 2 format. Go figure.",1401148800,2,1683,4.826388888888889
7948508,4,B00005OA7Y,"I saw this show in London and have produced it with teens and adults here in the States. How I wish it were available to watch multiple times in US format. The songs (Andrew Lloyd Webber) and script make for a delightful rendition of PG Wodehouse on stage, as Bertie Wooster reminisces about romantical mix-ups among our favorite characters: Bingo Little, Madeline Bassett, the Reverend Harold ""Stinker"" Pinker, Augustus Fink-Nottle and, of course - Jeeves, who saves the day as usual.

As with any adaptation of a beloved work of fiction, there will be the inevitable comparisons with one's own ideas of how the characters should be interpreted and I thought Jeeves was played without his genteel and genuine appreciation for Bertie in both the London stage production (1996) and this Canadian cast. But the gags, the production values, and the storyline are pure enjoyment.",1323648000,2,875,5.0344827586206895
7948509,4,B00005OA7Y,"BY JEEVES - this version - is a re-working (and to my way of thinking - an improvement) of the former musical version of the same material by Alan Ayckbourn and Andrew Lloyd Webber. It is an odd concept that seems to defy capture on DVD. The show is supposed to be being played in a local English Grange Hall or some such thing and what we (the audience in DVD-Land and the audience in the Grange Hall in the musical!) are watching is really a reenactment of events that may or may not have occurred or be occurring. The end result is that while the songs are really quite captivating and easily and readily accessible (as is the case in most of ALW's work) there is a constant ambiguation (heavens, what a word!) of the story that prevents it from becoming immediate to those who are watching - especialy those watching in DVD-Land. It is an odd DVD watching experience. I gave it 4-stars (hating the ""star"" system all the while) but must caution you that this is a dodgy experience all around. I am not certain it really works as a concept (the show-within-a-show thing that we have seen so often) and even when it does work - to a certain extent - it seems always to be operating at its own expense - to its own detriment. In the end I feel the CD of this show is a better experience than the DVD. Much better in fact! In your mind, you can imagine a much more effective staging! This staging simply does not work! Had I known this *I* would NOT have purchased this DVD and put the images in my brain in the first place. (Be careful what you put in your head - you'll never get it out again!)",1221091200,7,1595,4.232786885245901
