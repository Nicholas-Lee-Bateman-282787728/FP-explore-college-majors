8507603,5,6303491448,"No greater combination than ""The Winans"" and Vanessa Bell Armstrong!!  I purchased this because it has The Winans greatest hits ministered live, showing now Bishop Marvin Winans as not only an excellent gospel artist but an Awesome Man of God even back then.  It also includes a recording of the now dearly departed Ronald Winans singing ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me"" which is a song that you can find NO WHERE ELSE! If you love gospel music, and if you even ""like"" The Winans or Vanessa Bell Armstrong you will absolutely LOVE this recording!!  I watch it over and over again!!",1381449600,5,582,4.576923076923077
8507604,5,6303491448,"it so unfair that we here in south africa don't get the good stuff like this. I almost know everything about the WINANS and even their family history. What must we do to get the music videos. Our land just supply for the so called ""white population""  Isn't there some other way that this can be done????",1029801600,,303,4.315789473684211
8507605,4,6303491448,"The Winans at their finest. This video is a must for any Winans fan.  Tracks include : Perfect Love, Question Is, Always, Love is a Spirit, Medley, Millions, Everything You Touch, Very Real Way, I Want to be Ready, Sun Going Down ( only available on this video ), Tomarrow, Jesus/ Restoration,  Their harmonies are some of the most wonderful of all time. They show you how to praise the Lord , Winans style in this video praise experience.  Four stars because of sound quality. Good, But could have been done better(Recording Engineers fault).",984787200,7,543,4.75531914893617
