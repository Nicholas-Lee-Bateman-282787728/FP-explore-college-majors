You see all the ignorance, hatred, and prejudice of a  culture mired in an ideal from the Middle Ages that may not have been a guide for living, even then.  The rejection of modern day requirements will never ever allow this antiquated ideal to, but exist under force and duration, and will eventually doom it adherents to a complete nonexistence in the future dustbins of history.

8625171,1,B00GNTK85O,"When I read about this film, I thought to myself ""finally, here's a Lebanese movie that has some depth, that deals with real social issues."" It was the worst Lebanese movie I've seen :) The characters are non-believable: their acting is exaggerated, they way they talk is like in some elementary school play!  The Lebanese movie industry has been making some progress (sorry, not this one), and still has a way to go!  Check out movies by director Nadine Labaki; they're good!",1395360000,,476,4.7926829268292686
