Buy the tapes.  They display awesome, rawest of the raw talents and gifts. Off the heezee.",1054512000,,268,4.520833333333333
7973220,3,B00006SFP3,"This is street ball on tape -- it's basketball Matrix-style, where rules can be bended (you lose the ball in mid-dribble, catch it with the opposite hand, then are free to cross over or go between your opponent's legs in a move dubbed the ""Sauce 2K""), and where court warriors earn their street names (Main Event, formerly the Coming Attraction; Alimoe the Black Widow and High Octane among others) -- popularized by the AND1 shoe company in its MixTapes. So when AND1's Mixtape Vol. 5 became the first of the series to be actually sold and rented out on it's own, the sixth installment was guaranteed the commercial treatment. ESPN followed and documented the Vol. 6 tour in its Street Ball (Mountain Dew Code Red!) series, giving a teaser sample of the moves to expect.
That DVD had limitations as AND1 was sure to pick out which moves ESPN could and couldn't show, resulting in a DVD showing the same moves -- although who could get sick of Alimoe's over and around the head, bouncing back in the opposite direction, spinning Headache around, on a fast break move -- over and over.
AND1 Ball Access is ESPN Street Ball without the leash, the director's cut, if you will. You get to see just a bit more moves in extended takes of various stops on the tour. For example, as the team takes to Kentucky, a local with a Hot Sauce tattoo on his forearm (the ""Louisville Hot Sauce"" he declares), challenges AND1's Atlanta Hot Sauce one-on-one. Louisville gets mad schooled, as shown by ESPN, but the segement goes on a little longer in Ball Access.
There's also a lot more of the players messing around in the towns they visit, with a particularly funny trip to a New Orleans clothing store.
Consider this DVD ESPN's Street Ball with 15 percent more moves footage, and 20 percent more night-on-the-town footage, meaning I'd recommend it over Street Ball for having more moves on tape, while Street Ball does have it's own advantages (see my review).
Newcomers are better off finding the AND1 Vol. 1-4 collection DVD to understand and appreciate this offering; old-time street ball addicts can use it to hold over the time until we get to see the all the new ankle-breaking, through your legs, around your had moves and self-oop windmill jams Vol. 6 has to offer.",1053216000,11,2258,4.675879396984925
