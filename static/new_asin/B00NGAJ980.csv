6649327,5,B00NGAJ980,"This is a funny, moving, fabulous film of a play by Del Shores.",1417564800,,63,3.923076923076923
6649328,5,B00NGAJ980,"well, this is so funny.  Just a great video to watch with friends.  You will be rolling on the floor laughing.",1417219200,2,110,4.190476190476191
6649329,5,B00NGAJ980,"Very powerful.  As someone who has lived it, it hit a little too close to home. Well written, well acted.  Authentic and spot on.",1416441600,12,129,4.333333333333333
6649330,5,B00NGAJ980,"This film obviously isn't for everyone, although it should be! It is actually a play that has been filmed in cinematic style, very successfully, too. It is funny, sweet, touching, sad, and tells a story that so many young children have experienced, myself included. It really brings to the fore how the church teaches shame and guilt, and causes young people so much pain and pure torture, when the church should be teaching love and acceptance and tolerance and joy. The church taught me to be religious, but nothing about being spiritual, which is something I've had to learn on my own.
Not everyone will get this play/movie, but to those of us who have lived it, it is exceptional!",1416096000,16,684,4.708333333333333
6649331,5,B00NGAJ980,"I don't think I've ever experienced anything like ""South Baptist Sissies.""  Written and directed by Del Shores (of ""Sordid Lives"" fame), this wonderful experience takes the viewer on a ride that should have you talking for a long time to come.  It is the story of four male youths who all attend the Calvary Baptist Church in Dallas, TX.  The film is actually a live performance of the play, and I think that may have worked in favor of this production.

This movie may not be for everyone because religion is at its core.  Here, religion is skewered for all its hatred, double talk, and the constant stress put upon somebody who is ""different.""  The music (there are many, many Baptist hymns) also helps to portray many Sunday mornings just about everyone of us has spent (at one time or another).  The cast is superb.  Leslie Jordan (Beverly Leslie from ""Will and Grace"") plays Peanut.  He has a small monologue toward the end of this film that had me in tears because the words rang so true.  I will never forget the look on his face when he delivered it.

I can tell you there have been very few movies that have made me REALLY cry.  This one upset me so that I couldn't sleep last night, yet (at the core of it all) the movie does deliver hope.

I hope you can see this; I found it on PPV.  It was some of the best money I've ever spent.  If you have a gay son or daughter, I suggest you sit down with them, watch this movie, and have a long discussion.  The movie is not rated, but contains nudity, language, simulated sex, and sexual situations.  I HIGHLY recommend it.",1415491200,35,1576,4.360824742268041
6649332,5,B00NGAJ980,"The cast did an amazing job at being full-fledged characters. I found this movie to be truly touching, funny, tragically sad, and heartfelt. Expect to openly sob, if you have even the smallest heart, have ever felt the outsider, or been anguished by a dark message under the veil of religion. There is hope! There is acceptance! There is love!",1510704000,2,343,4.733333333333333

6649336,5,B00NGAJ980,"Absolutely love this movie! I grew up Southern Baptist with all of this BS and this was just beautifully done. I wish more people could watch a piece like this and understand, hate is the problem. Declining numbers in churches are because of this very thing. This is simply beautiful and I think everyone needs to see it! Thanks Leslie Jordan for reelin' me in with Sordid Lives, ""Southern Baptist Sissies"" did not disappoint!",1504137600,3,426,4.77027027027027
6649337,5,B00NGAJ980,"Heart gripping.  Growing up in the church, there is so much content that is relevant. Good for people to watch for an eye opening perspective.",1503100800,2,142,4.68
6649338,5,B00NGAJ980,"I thought ""Sordid Lives"" hit close to home, being raised in the rural countryside of West Texas, but this well written play strikes to the heart of those from here, raised in the church, then growing up attempting to navigate self-acceptance and acceptance from God, without going mad in the process.  The mixture of humor and drama was balanced while addressing a deep and long standing rift and turmoil between being who you are, and being accepted where you are, by a church that will never forgive nor accept.  Bravo.",1502668800,2,521,4.777777777777778
6649339,2,B00NGAJ980,"I'm a middle aged gay man, and raised in the South my entire life. I've been bullied, beaten, called every name under the sun, and I'm still here. Don't misunderstand me. I'm very sympathetic to anyone who's not treated humanely and equally, and if I see it, I don't tolerate it. Maybe it was because my parents never forced religion down our throats, and were pretty progressive compared to most in the little mountain town where I was born and raised. It wasn't the Church in my instance, that tried to beat me into submission.

I really wanted to love this movie/play, but lost interest fairly early on. Sordid Lives (which I know word for word, and love) pretty much covered all the bases and emotions of what it's like to be different or gay and just trying to get through each day without too much trouble in a close minded community.

The message is valid. Equality for all should be a given. If this movie moved you and made you feel better, then it's done its job. Personally, I feel almost as if this play is overkill.  Be thankful that in the 21st century there are many options for gay and troubled youth.  Many of us weren't afforded that kind of help until we were older and got out on our own and could afford it.

Sorry. I just wasn't a fan of this play.",1499904000,,1270,4.364406779661017

6649341,5,B00NGAJ980,"Amazing, Glorious, Amusing, Honest. The best film I have seen regarding religion and the LGBTQ community!! I am just astounded by this movie. The true grit and strength of the message is SO touching. I know each of these characters in my life. My sister and brother are gay, I am a supporter of anyone who seeks to be loved for who they are. I want those I love to be happy, however they find that happiness. William Belli is just superb!",1497830400,3,438,4.353658536585366

6649344,5,B00NGAJ980,This film is excellent. The cast of actors do a fantastic job. It's both funny and serious. Witty and sharp. I don't think you have to be a Southern Baptist to appreciate the religious context discussed. I was raised a Catholic and topics discussed were relatable.,1492819200,3,264,4.760869565217392

6649358,5,B00NGAJ980,"Whereas this movie was more of a play, it was very good. I rarely take time to write a review, however this movie really touched me.
I was raised strict Baptist which made coming out very difficult. This movie did a wonderful job showing the hate and judgement  that some Baptist show as well as the acceptance by others. I am a Christian and have finally come to terms with myself. I told my partner of 15 years that if wanted to know what coming out was like for me, just watch this movie.
It was truly moving.",1483920000,2,512,4.224489795918367

First off, Willam Belli is great! I can't imagine the team it took to get him into and out of drag as many times in each act that he had to switch.
But the story itself is what got me. In some ways it was my story, in others not so much.
I will say that if you're a tenderhearted person at all, be ready to be invested in the characters and the situations. And be ready to be touched at your core.
Wonderful actors, wonderful story, so very glad I finally got to see it.",1446422400,2,568,3.9478260869565216

Emerson is just a great actor and very cute. The whole cast was GREAT. The last scene brought tear to me. When cast sang LOVE is God it made me feel love and good.

The fact that it is a filmed play I did not care for, but was interesting.  Loved most of the actors, especially those with the Del Shores connection from Sordid Lives, however this is no Sordid Lives movie, by any stretch.  If this ever does make it to film, I hope it is period piece, because is too preachy to reflect today's world.  Not every gay man hated himself or was miserable, even in the 80s, as this story seems to  project. All and all it is just OK.  Watch Harvey Fierstein's ""Torch Song Tilogy"" and Del Shores' ""Sordid Lives"" the movie.  Two much better crafted films and stories in both humor and dramedy.",1443225600,,739,4.4222222222222225

6649411,5,B00NGAJ980,"""Souther Baptist Sissies"" was one of the funniest, saddest and moving films I've ever watched. You see, I'm a straight ally for GLBT rights and marriage equality, or as the Southern Baptists might say, ""one of those Godless supporters of homosexual abomination."" I'm allowed to say that because I was raised in a Southern Baptist church. From second grade until I graduated from high school, I was in church every Sunday morning, Sunday night and Wednesday night. I participated in Bible drills, sang in the choir, but I never fit the mold they tried to stuff me into. I read too much, asked too many questions, showed interest in science and in other religions, and worst of all, one of my best friends was gay. ""Southern Baptist Sissies""  gave me flashbacks to how my friend was treated by our church, how he felt fear and shame, how he tried desperately to ""be straight,"" and how he constantly battled depression and suicidal thoughts. Watching those scenes brought a flood of pain and tears, but thankfully, the movie ended with hope, and there was a lot of hilarity in the mix. Leslie Jordan and Dale Dickey were absolutely brilliant, making me laugh until my sides hurt. Emerson Collins was funny and adorable, and Newell Alexander's role as the Southern Baptist preacher was so well played, it was scary. After I rented this film on Amazon Instant Video, I knew I had to own it. I'm a big fan of ""Sordid Lives"" and Del Shores didn't disappoint.",1431993600,17,1451,4.71259842519685
6649412,4,B00NGAJ980,Great story. Leslie Jordan is BRILLIANT.,1431820800,,40,5.833333333333333
6649413,5,B00NGAJ980,"I find this video hilarious and fun to watch because I grew up in the same situation in Memphis TN and it is so realistic in dealing with all the hypocrites in the Baptist church I attended and some of the folks fit the spot right on!  Be it a preacher, Sunday school teacher, choir director or deacon.....one gets the message that all is not as they pretend it to be!  Strange things do happen!",1431129600,,395,4.253333333333333
6649414,5,B00NGAJ980,Wonderful movie.  It's strong language is realistic but limits its use.,1429228800,,71,5.454545454545454
6649415,5,B00NGAJ980,The funniest play I have seen in a long time.  Great cast wonderful message,1428969600,,75,4.357142857142857
6649416,5,B00NGAJ980,"This film should be required viewing by everyone, but I fear that those that need to see it the most, wouldn't ""get"" it. As a gay surviver of a fundamentalist Christian church, I had a very, very emotional reaction to this film.",1428710400,,228,4.4523809523809526
6649417,5,B00NGAJ980,"This hit me hard growing up gay in a  southern baptist church myself i felt every moment but it was also healing for me I now realize what it truly means to be a christian.
God sees what is in your heart and soul.
Great acting funny and you will laugh and cry and be the better for it.
Love the song Stained Glass Window it says so much i had buy it.
Buy this one it is truly worth it .",1428192000,,386,3.707317073170732

6649419,5,B00NGAJ980,Really enjoyed this film/play. Raised a lot of questions regarding sexuality and the church (Baptist).,1427241600,,102,5.866666666666666
6649420,5,B00NGAJ980,Classic and a must for anyone who grew up in the South or anyone interested in knowing what that was like.,1427241600,,106,4.095238095238095
6649421,5,B00NGAJ980,"If you grew up knowing you were gay in a place where you felt safe, loved and accepted you won't be knocked over by this film. If these attitudes seem extreme and unbelievable consider yourself fortunate. Those of us who have lived it are watching slacked jawed through eyes of amazement as though someone is telling our life's story.  It is so real it is a bit chilling.  We can see ourselves in a part of each character. I have watched back to back thinking I would quit acting like a teenage girl and get all the way through without a tear.  I haven't made it yet without at least one.  Save some money on therapy and hand a copy to the counselor saying this brings you up to date to about the 21st birthday.",1426723200,,711,4.2444444444444445
6649422,4,B00NGAJ980,"If you were raised Southern Baptist and if you or someone near and dear to you is gay, you'll love this movie.  The movie itself is of the staged play.  I wasn't expecting that but it was very good.  A bit campy and over the top in places, it's main point struck a nerve with me.  It reminded me too much of growing up gay in Oklahoma.  I wept all night after watching this due to the memories it conjured up.  So yeah, I really liked it but not because of the great acting, which it didn't have.",1426636800,2,496,4.010204081632653
6649423,1,B00NGAJ980,"Kinda hard to get into, its all over the place. I love Willam Belli and saw he was in this. Good effort on everyones part but I didn't enjoy it, stopped 30 minutes in, ill let my 6 days and 30 minutes expire.",1426636800,,208,3.86046511627907
6649424,5,B00NGAJ980,wonderful movie i really enjoyed it i have never laugh so much,1425686400,,62,4.25
6649425,3,B00NGAJ980,"Really pretty film if a play. I would rather the producer and director had created a storyline around the characters as they play out in real Southern Baptist Churches across the South and Texas. But I guess they didn't want to make another horror film. Good job guys, but next time give me a story I can sink
My teeth into. Leave the singing and dancing on Broadway.",1425600000,,367,4.411764705882353
6649426,5,B00NGAJ980,The movie was amazing. I live in Louisiana and from a Christian home and all the themes hit home for me. Especially about being afraid of the Rapture. I find myself struggling with deep scars regarding my self esteem and wanting to love myself. The south has produced a lot of self hating people. Hopefully through this movie we can began to talk about these things. I gave it five stars for depth and emotional correctness.,1425427200,,424,4.592105263157895
6649427,5,B00NGAJ980,"Absolute genius! I laughed and cried at the same time. This movie mirrored my life in ways that were precise, and at times painful and uncomfortable. So glad I watched this! Del Shores, you have an absolute masterpiece here. Thank you!",1425081600,,235,4.7560975609756095
6649428,5,B00NGAJ980,"This was well worth the time. It will resonate particularly well with southerners raised in the south. Each of the characters reminded me of people from my own past. The story isn't perfect, and like a lot of gay flicks dealing with religion, Southern Baptist Sissies attempts cover so much ground that a few topics/experiences don't get fleshed out as much as one might hope. However, the performances of the actors, in combination with the music and themes tackled, make this a powerful and inspiring piece of art.",1424995200,,516,4.875
6649429,5,B00NGAJ980,This is the first time I have written a review that I know of and it is because this movie is that powerful.  It is funny and sad and powerful all rolled up in one.,1424822400,,164,3.6857142857142855
6649430,5,B00NGAJ980,"For anyone that has grown up under the thumb of the Southern Baptist religion, this movie will be powerful.  For those who want to understand many of the pressures on gay men in that area, this is a very revealing insight.  Well acted and thoughtful.
My husband and I are both raised in Southern Baptist homes and are happy to have this demonstration of our community's struggle.",1424563200,,379,4.641791044776119
6649431,5,B00NGAJ980,"Don't know if this still the case, but the film certainly nailed my early Southern Baptist years.",1424563200,,97,4.764705882352941

6649434,5,B00NGAJ980,Great movie!! Hard to watch at times because it hits home for me. Glad to see a movie to help others understand the clash of religion and being gay in modern times.,1424131200,5,164,4.15625

6649439,3,B00NGAJ980,It was a great play...  I felt all if emotions in the play as well as religious prejudice.  Del Shores did a wonderful job composing a truthful script of homosexuality and how it relates to our society.,1423008000,,202,4.4324324324324325

6649448,5,B00NGAJ980,Love this movie because I grew up in a religion that despises homosexuality as very sinful too.  I could really identify with the gay characters and the pain they felt growing up in the Bible Belt. I am going to watch this movie again and again. Del Shores did a wonderful job on the script.,1420070400,2,291,4.290909090909091

6649451,5,B00NGAJ980,"Previous reviewers have said it well: this is a funny, sad, moving film, laced with tragedy and hope. A few judicious cuts could have been made to the otherwise finely-wrought script; performances were spot-on. Certainly, this is an incisive look into Southern Baptist religious fundamentalism and the conflict with the gay identity of some of its members.",1419811200,,356,5.2631578947368425

8677967,5,B00NGAJ980,"Exceptional. Moving. Funny. Sad. Tears. Laughter.  This movie is actually a play that was filmed.  Since I am a theatre buff with an interest in both LGBT issues and how they intersect with faith, it was a good match for my tastes.  So much heartbreak and pathos and some hope too.  Though the film was released in 2013 (the play premiered in 2000), it is just as relevant, maybe even more so, in 2018, with the state of our nation and world.

I'm sorry I left this sitting on my watchlist for so long.  I simply loved it.",1532131200,,522,4.275510204081633

I even knew the thoughts of ending it all. I failed in my attempt to end it all and I am so happy I did. Whenever I can, I try to tell those who are lonely that things will get better. They really do. The world itself is getting better. You can do things today that were unthinkable just fifty years ago. There will always be those few people who have hearts full of hate, but my experience has been that so many people are accepting. So many people love you and care for you. You are not alone.
