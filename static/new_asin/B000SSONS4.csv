8206616,4,B000SSONS4,"Vol. 10, 1942, Part 2. This episode has more of the local action and troop doings, and less of the larger campaigns.

Few major actions are named, except for the Romanian and German attack on Sebastopol.

There seems to be more footage in this program than in earlier episodes of prisoners clearing roads, and trucks hauling supplies.

There is quite the clothing drive for the troops. If it was staged for propaganda purposes, they sure filled up a lot of trains with clothing. 5 million pair of socks alone! I do not recall any support like this by the public for our boys in Vietnam.

The strength of this series is the portrayal of ever day soldier, airman, and sailor life. It is dressed up for the home crowd, but we still have this finely-filmed record of troops in everyday service.

There is no such record of German troops found elsewhere than die Deutsche Wochenshau. As ever, many well-filmed scenes of artillery crews firing their big guns. The scenes of U-boat activity include one that would later be dramatized in the 1981 film Das Boot.

The music ranges from sublime and appropriate, to over-the-top annoying band marches that drown out the narrator's voice.

To avoid the annoying English language track, set the audio to the German language with English subtitles, then start the program from Main Menu Scenes Reel 1 1942 Part 2. This also eliminates the first several minutes of annoying English language material.",1368576000,,1435,4.83265306122449
