3829401,3,B001XW7IIG,"Richard Jones (Kel Mitchell) is a sexual con artist. One night his manhood is stolen by a succubus. He has until midnight to find the missing item and have a Voodoo queen reattach it for him. But who has it?

The film runs through the gauntlet of former ex-one night stands. Richard is also hounded by the brother (Brooklyn McLinn) of one of the girls, a loan shark collector, and the MIB. The movie is mostly low brow humor with some good moments. I think if they had gone of a quirky ""Scott Pilgrim"" style, this would have been a hit. If you like African-American comedies like ""Budz House"" you might want to check this one out.

I'm a proud supporter of independent movies and I don't go hard on them the way I would a big budget film, as independent film projects just have cut corners and make it happen the best way they can, but I was expecting more. Kell was adorable and funny enough as usual but the story was flat. There were few laughs, it's obvious that it was shot with a cheaper quality camera, the acting was so so but we'll just blame that on the script. I couldn't really get into the film, halfway thru I just gave up. Don't be fooled by the girls on the cover either, if your watching this for gorgeous Dollicia Bryant she only shows up for 2 minutes if that. If you want to see Kells' better works try Ganked or Dance Fu. If your still curious, rent it maybe?",1349913600,,791,4.142857142857143
3829403,5,B001XW7IIG,"I found out about this movie through youtube. I purchased it because it relates to real life. A playboy who tricks women into sleeping with him by lying about what kind of job he has, and how much money he has (which he has neither of). Unfortunately, he ruins alot of the girls lives he played, so when payback comes in the form of taking his manhood, he has to learn the hard way of trying to get it back!!! Too bad this cant happen for real, but it was very enjoyable to see him suffer :), but at the same time, a really good lesson to learn from taking advantage of people.",1324425600,2,577,4.115044247787611
3829404,3,B001XW7IIG,"This young man Kel Mitchell has lost his mind,.. His characters keep you in mind of the Jim Carrey's, Robin Williams,Eddy Murphy or Damon Wayans.. This movie here could be his proposal to more charaters of status...",1258156800,,215,4.837837837837838
8347888,3,B001XW7IIG,"I watched this with ""M'Lady"" so we started it off with 0 stars  to see if the movie could work its way up. She gave it one star for the opening turd joke, I gave it one star for the original closing song and we both gave it another star because overall it was not a bad movie. Normally, I can't make it through these Redbox reject movies, but this one actually held my interest and made me laugh.",1526688000,,396,4.012658227848101
8347889,5,B001XW7IIG,"(I never right reviews for movies I watch via Amazon Video...but had to write one for this movie) Not sure why there are mediocre to bad reviews for this movie. I thought it was absolutely hilarious. Kel Mitchell is absolutely comical in this flick. The ""best buddy"" report between him and Paige Kennedy is spot on. Give this movie a chance and watch through to the end. There is a great plot twist and lesson to be learned. I loved it!!! If I could give it 6 stars I WOULD.",1514851200,,474,4.277777777777778

8347897,3,B001XW7IIG,Over all for a straight to DVDs movie I think this was pretty good. I enjoyed the movie and was able to watch it all the way through. The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 was the quality of the video was bad. There was times where it was blurry in some parts in the movie that was annoying.,1429574400,,295,3.774193548387097
