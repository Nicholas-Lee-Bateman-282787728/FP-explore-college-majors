8343840,5,B001UIFQWI,"Good Spanish-language, Mexican-made early '60s horror film.  Sequel to El Vampiro Sangriento (The Bloody Vampire).  A clutch of vampires, dormant for years, wake up to rattle the countryside.  It even has a king vampire that changes into a bat the size of a bald eagle.  The quality of the DVD is excellent.  The black-and-white photography is fine.  Unfortunately no dubbing or sub-titles.  Highly recommended for fans of the genre.",1400889600,2,433,5.188405797101449
8343841,5,B001UIFQWI,"If you're into traditional Gothic cinema (Universal, Hammer, Corman, Bava) , than this film is a must. Sequel to The Bloody Vampire, this film has a far stronger visual appeal and a sense of spiritual menace. The digital transfer is good but not on a par with Casa Negra remasters. Also, the pic is entirely in Spanish without subtitles. Regardless, fans of the Gothic are more interested in feeling than in dialogue analysis, and, in that sense, Invasion de los Vampiros is a rare gem. I's rank it just behind El Vampiro and Curse of the Crying Woman in my own 'best-of' list from that great age of Mexican Gothic, 1957-1964. Dig in and enjoy!",1389571200,8,644,4.608695652173913
