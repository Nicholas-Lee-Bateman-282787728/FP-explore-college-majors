4161893,5,B003O9VLKM,"This is a story of murdering the Australian journalists during an Indonesian annexation of newly proclaimed independent East Timor in 1975.

Good acting, high quality DVD, rich Timorese landscapes just highlight barbarity of pro-Indonesian murderers.

Well, any art work of any history documented bears some personal vision of creators and a reflection of own producers' feelings towards the past reality unfolded.",1276300800,5,414,5.770491803278689
8401501,4,B003O9VLKM,"A very moving story about a massacre and invasion that is little known in the west.  The story of an Australian journalist trying to uncover the truth about what was happening before and during the Indonesian invasion of East Timor is well acted, directed, and written.  They took a non-chronological/parallel approach to telling the story and by doing so the filmmakers made you feel like you were discovering the truth yourself.",1521936000,,430,5.042253521126761

8401503,5,B003O9VLKM,"I liked it very much. It is a strong story about a man who wants to find out the truth no matter what the costs will be. Mr. LaPaglia plays with passion. The other actors are good too.
I liked the rhythm of the movie. When I started to watch, I didn't want to stop till the end.
It is a little bit of thriller and a little bit of documentary. And the additional materials are very good.

If you would like find out history about Australian journalists who died while doing their job  just buy or rent BALIBO",1422576000,2,507,4.111111111111111
8401504,5,B003O9VLKM,"When the world looks the other way, who is responsible for an invasion of one country by another?  Balibo is the true story of the invasion of East Timor by Indonesia and 5 Australian/New Zealand news reporters who went missing during the war.

I'll admit the original reason I watched this movie is because I wanted to find out if Thomas Wright actually sounded the way in anything else as he does on the Bridge as the character Stephen.  For the record, he doesn't.

If this movie doesn't move you, something is wrong.  Far too often ""true stories"" or ""based on a true story"" are anything but that.  Here's a movie that not only had the audacity to show the truth but to show it in such a way as to humanize and bring the invasion to light.",1409443200,2,742,4.340579710144928
8401505,5,B003O9VLKM,"In 1975, during the height of the cold war.  Allies were valued more than how they behaved. Indonesia invaded east timor , which had just gotten independence from Portugal. it's easy to forget that most of the world was in colonial hands and some parts still were in the seventies. The Indonesians acted with complete savagery and because they were anticommunist , nothing was said or done. the cold war was indeed a very dark time in history. This story relates the horror of the invasion and the bravery of the Australian journalists who were slaughtered. Including John Eastman , a man who knew , what would happen if he didn't leave and  he stayed anyways. He was retired and went to look for the missing five Australian journalists and then  he stayed anyways. this is a true story with powerful acting from the cast. Anthony la paglia is excellent in this one  He really converys how Eastman , was a man who could have left and even never gone. he had after all fought in ww2, and was a journalist in many hellholes and wars.  He had earned his retirement. But instead he went to another warzone.  This is available on Netflix. and this dvd is region b so you need a all region player to watch this. THis should have been shown on hbo or somewhere because it's a excellent story of bravery and sacrifice. It was filmed in timor ,which is free now. the film looks great in hd. and there is a blu ray of it as well.",1387670400,2,1419,4.396946564885496
8401506,5,B003O9VLKM,"This is a gripping story from start to finish.  Based on the true story of 5 murdered Australian Journalists in East Timor, just days prior to the invasion by Indonesia in 1975.  The plot follows the fate of Roger East, a freelance Australian journalist (played by Anthony LaPaglia) who goes to Timor in search of the 5 missing journalists, and is caught up in the invasion.  Using Jill Joliffe's  book ""Cover-up"", director Robert Connolly has crafted an extraordinary film.  Shot entirely in East Timor (Timor Leste), the film uses many local first-time actors, and wonderfully recreates the journalists actual news footages, from their sitting in a hut at night interviewing the frighten villagers, who ask the question ""why does no one help us?"", to the news footage of their final days in Balibo painting the Australian flag on their hut in the hope that this would provide them with protection.
Unlike many western films made in developing countries....this is story-telling at it's best and has the rare feeling of true authenticity",1379030400,4,1038,5.046783625730995
8401507,5,B003O9VLKM,"This 2009 film centered on the murder of journalists trying to film and get word out on the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975 is gritty gripping beautifully scripted in what must be real life narratives of the Timorian survivors.  The Timorians and the journalists trying to help them believe that if they can get the story out the world will not allow this injustice, this take over of a newly free people (Timor was invaded only 9 days after its liberation from Portugals 400 year occupancy).  The film is done in a steely neutral  documentary style that holds the viewer as observer and victim in common with the journalists whose lives were lost and with the Timorians who completely understand what is about to happen to them.  This film should be in every junior high and high school library and incorporated into curriculum on world and U.S. history and the story of the U.N. and discussed along with the revelations of the U.S. role in allowing this.[...].  Owning our history, especially in teaching its truth to our children, we liberate their future.",1353801600,,1069,4.788043478260869
8401508,4,B003O9VLKM,"This is an excellent film of a true story: that of the rape of East Timor and the fatal ordeal that a group of Australian journalists went through to get the story out. It is so frightening and sad that I found it hard to watch. The story begins with a young government official, who contacts a freelance journalist he admires. The journalist is kind of a burnt out case, longing for an easier time of it and reluctant to pursue a story in the Indonesian jungle. The official cajoles him, entices him, and lays a guilt trip on him to come, which he eventually agrees to do.

The journalist is immediately struck with the potential of a story about a team of young idealists who disappeared 3 weeks before, when apparently Indonesian security forces began to take over the recently liberated Portuguese colony (in 1975). His concentrates on the plight of his compatriots enrages and disgusts the official, who wants him to cover the story from the point of view of the country that is being swallowed by violence and a new bid to own it as a colony. They go on a long, rough trek into the interior, get shot at, and meet a number of courageous rebels. Parallel to this investigation, they story of the journalists is shown as if happening at the same time. They are beautiful young men, full of ideals and potential, their lives just getting started, their talents only beginning to bloom.

While I do not wish to spoil the plot, the film rolls out with a relentless realism. The older journalist discovers what happened to them and is shocked at what he witnesses, including the murder before his eyes of a rebel who had become a friend. He then accepts his duty as a journalist to tell the entire story. It is believable and inspiring. It is also a true story. The young diplomat goes into exile, eventually winning the Nobel Peace Prize.

If you are interested in contemporary history, this is a must see film. I will share it with my children, who are becoming interested in world politics. The acting in this is very strong.",1322179200,,2028,4.550684931506849
8401509,5,B003O9VLKM,"Balibo casts real light on the brutal invasion of East Timor by Indonesia in 1975. The main focus of the movie narrative consists of resistance efforts by the East Timorese, and the cold blooded murder of five Australian based journalists in the village of Balibo. The five journalists consisted of two Australians, two Britons, and one New Zealander. Roger East, an Australian journalist, travels to East Timor to investigate the deaths of these men, and he uncovers the shocking truth. The tragedy doesn't end when East reports his findings. It is interesting how a book by Jill Jolliffe and this motion picture, has established deeper facts than government diplomatic efforts. The power of cinema is confirmed by this work.

8401510,5,B003O9VLKM,"This is the true story of `the Balibo five'; they were Australian journalists who were in East Timor in 1975 when the invasion by Indonesia took place. They went missing and a sixth journalist Roger East (played by Anthony Laplagia - `Without a Trace and `Summer of Sam') is persuaded to go to East Timor to work for the government as Head of media; in order to bring their plight to the attention of a complacent world.

Jose Ramos Horta is the man who persuades him (played by Oscar Isaac - `Che' and `Robin Hood'). Once they arrive East decides to find out what has happened to the journalists, whom he knew and were friends of his. His trek leads him to Balibo where he tries to uncover the truth.

The story begins in the present day with eye witnesses being questioned about these events. It then returns to December 1975. East Timor has just declared independence from its colonial master Portugal. In the supposed power vacuum, the Indonesians wasted no time, but decided to launch an aggressive invasion on an unprepared country. The world stood by and did nothing; the only outsiders that tried to get the truth to the wider world were these Australian journalists (actually one was British).

Director Robert Connolly has done an excellent job of presenting the story in such a way that has you hooked from the start and does not let up. The attention to period detail is excellent and the acting superb. This is based on the book `Cover Up' by Jill Jollife and I am sure she is very pleased with the result. This is an intense thriller with periodic action and quite explicit violence. It is a story that should have been told a long time ago, it is just good that at last it has seen the light of day.

With a run time of 106 minutes, this will stay with you a long time after. One of the best films I have seen in a long time and will probably draw comparisons to `The Killing Fields'. This however, stands as a film of excellence in its' own right and I can not recommend highly enough.",1306972800,4,2001,4.444141689373297
