8135474,4,B000CRR2U2,"The reviewer of 02/06/10 pretty much nailed things and I strongly endorse most of the views expressed in that essay, so let me just add some short comments which may or may not help matters. I'm a casual viewer of anime, but I'd have to say that this struck me as a decidedly above-average effort. The characters are well-drawn, and with one or two exceptions easily distinguished from one another. As noted by others, space combat here is not quick shooting at close quarters but rather a series of measured strategic responses from long range. Also appreciated is the fact that the plot truly does evolve in unexpected ways, making it a refreshing break from predictable story lines. The quality of the animation is good, as is the direction in general. All in all, it's so good that my only real criticism is that it's far too short -- much more might have been drawn out of this basic conception, and it's a bit of a shame that it wasn't. Still, if you can stand the disappointment of the series finally ending, you're likely to seriously enjoy this.",1358208000,,1054,4.611702127659575
8135475,4,B000CRR2U2,"I found this series interesting in terms of its use of space combat.  This is not a case where ships meet head on.  Combat is conducted millions of miles away, and you can only see your oponent through a telescope.  The characters had to develope well placed tactics against their foe.  This is not a show where the ""hero"" ship goes charging in and overwhelms the oponent.  It is quiet the opposite.

Overall, the story was good and I liked the various ship concepts and battle tactics.  The characters were also good in performing their role.  Obviously, this is a story for people who like to look at tatics instead of giant firefights.  In truth, I thought this show did a good representation of what a true space battle would be like.

If you're someone who prefers space battles with explosions, this show might turn you off.  But if you like a show where people try to out think each other to make that one good shot, this might be one for you.",1329782400,,950,4.433526011560693
8135476,3,B000CRR2U2,"The story started off okay, but the action was never taken to the level it should have been on.  For the number of casualties, there was hardly any depiction of actual wounds.  The space combat was great, for as long as it lasted between ships.",1310947200,,244,4.4
8135477,4,B000CRR2U2,"THIS MOVIES BOASTS SOME OF THE BEST SOUND I'VE EVER HEARD IN AN ANIME SERIES. LOVE THE STORY. HAS A STAR BLAZERS FEEL BUT BETTER. AWESOME BLEND OF ANIME AND CG. I REALLY LIKE THIS SERIES, ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE.",1266278400,,213,4.35
8135478,5,B000CRR2U2,"I found this while looking through an anime site, It looked interesting but I had never heard of it so I delved deeper.

The cover liner description was not greatly inspiring - Plot Summary: For the 73rd class of cadets of the Defence University of the small planet Kibi, a shakedown cruise on the fleet's new starship ""Amaterasu"" is a fitting lead-up to graduation. As they are returning to their home planet, however, they are shocked to hear news of a declaration of war by the aggressive Kingdom against Kibi. When their planetary government surrenders without a struggle, the cadets decide to launch their own war, aboard the ""Amaterasu"". To gain funding, they make a deal with a galactic news network - and find themselves the ""stars"" of their own ""reality show"". Unfortunately, this is the kind of reality show that can get you killed...

Well there it is the basics, my first thoughts were it was going to be like Tenamonya Voyagers or Nadesico, (I do like both of these by the way its the genre I am referring to) however it is much better than this suggests, there is good character and plot development, its not a comedy or romantic trist or a girly fest full of panty shots, though the cover full of girls may suggest this.

It is in fact a serious science fiction story, and had a genuinely evolving plot of war and political intrigue, there is also great character and relationship development, and not always ending ""happily ever after"" as the liner says ""you can get killed""! and this includes popular characters.

The lead characters are Sinon (battle tactician), Miyuri and Arei, supported by a number of other prominent characters on the Amaterasu. Other primary characters are Admiral Dul Elroy, Peter Spikes (the Networks program director) and Dita (the Networks on board reporter). All the primary characters are important to the plot and sub plot lines of the story. Sinon's character is pivotal and carries the story. As the battle tactician it is her abilities and ideas that ensure the survival of the Amaterasu and the crew, and so the story can continue.

The animation is good and well thought out, battles are not overly involved but again well thought out, The characters are well presented and stylish, and despite the ""short skirts"" its not a peep show in any way, just great looking women. The one nude shower scene is tasteful and not explicit. There is good detail in all the animation, the bridge, hulls and monitors for example are well defined not just blurs or simplex drawings.

The voice characters are all appropriate, and I think well chosen for their parts, this goes for both the Japanese and English speaking casts, (I have watched both versions).

The opening credits have an upbeat tune ""Radiance"" and is good, the closing credit song is by Motoko and called ""Chi Ni Kaeru"" or ""Return to Earth"", I love this and have followed it up on YouTube, a plaintive, haunting and powerful song. It fits splendidly with the final episode, (bring the tissues)

After episode 13 I was let down by the simple fact that that was the end.. No more!! Still it finished with plot completeness and viewer satisfaction.
Note: A re write of the last episode and this series could have had a long future as the cadets would have had to battle on against the Earth Alliance.. more great battle scenes, intrigues etc.. Just a thought.

As extras there are text less opening and closings scenes, some music videos, and various previews. The closing scenes of the last episode is also presented as text less, as the credits roll early in the last episode along with the closing theme song. Completion of the last episode goes direct to the DVD credits.

I give this all 5 stars, I fully recommend it and wonder why it is not mentioned in the same breath as other Anime Classics', perhaps one day it will be, it deserves to be.

PS. I did buy the complete series box set and it was worth every cent!
If you like this another good space Anime is Stellvia.. Check it out.

Cheers for now.",1265414400,5,4008,4.677556818181818
8135479,4,B000CRR2U2,"""Starship Operators"" is the story of the starship Amaterasu. On the maiden voyage, the military that the corps serves is dissolved when the ship's home world surrenders to the Henrietta Alliance. The brave crew members find themselves on a state of the art military craft without a sovereign planet to serve. The series shows how a crew of cadets presses on. In this respect, the premise calls to mind ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Blazers/dp/B00005QCWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Blazers</a>"" meets Star Trek's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Squad/dp/B00008KA58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Squad</a>. The series is a curious combination of two schools of storytelling. On one hand, this is a serious science-fiction drama. ""Starship Operators"" employs politics, military strategy, science and the psychology of combat. The series gives a compelling prediction of how the media may come to dominate interstellar life. The show offers a fascinating look at how technology may be advanced yet simultaneously familiar. On the other hand, this show is very teen friendly. Many of the character strands deal with gushy romances and interpersonal female relationships that will greatly appeal to high school girls. The voyeuristic shots of the female cadet's legs will appeal to the guys. While there are great combat scenes, much of the story is character driven. ""Starship Operators"" is in many respects a coming of age story. Some viewers will embrace one of these schools of storytelling and reject the other. To fully appreciate ""Starship Operators,"" the viewer will have to reconcile the teeny-bopper and sci-fi geek forces. While I personally lean towards the geek end of this spectrum, I am ultimately able to make peace with the dual ingredients. Every now and then, my skin will briefly crawl from one of the girly scenes, but as a whole, I appreciate both influences. The show takes time to appreciate. The episodes on the first disc introduce the setting, central conflict and characters. The brief second disc is filled with epic space battles. The third disc is packed with intrigue, betrayal and last moment plot twists. It wasn't until the final episode that I realized just how invested I had become in the characters and their cause. As I watched the tear-jerking finale, I couldn't believe that the all-too short series was actually at an end. When all is said and done, ""Starship Operators"" stands as one of the less appreciated yet more compelling anime experiences.",1227830400,2,2583,5.625641025641026

8135481,5,B000CRR2U2,A GREAT SHOW. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. BUY THIS ONE WITHOUT HESITATION. WELL WORTH THE MONEY & TIME.,1223683200,,95,5.0
8135482,4,B000CRR2U2,"This story seems pretty straightforward, a young group of starship trainees, returning from a training mission, suddenly discover their home world annexed by a hostile government. They decide to purchase the ship, and enter combat against that government's forces as a form of protest. In order to finance the ship's purchase, they decide to get a sponsor, an interstellar TV network, who then sends a journalist along with them, in order to document their activities. Sounds pretty straightforward, right? WRONG, there are far more sinister political forces at work here, and the repercussions of their seemingly independent action will cause ripples to spread across the galaxy... If you don't like stories with a complex subplot, don't watch this. The space battles are realistic, in the sense that they take place at immense distances, and the effects of using ships without artificial gravity is felt as well. Battles are slow, and carefully planned out, with both intended, and unexpected consequences. This is a thinking man's anime, with characters that are both simple and at the same time very complex. Be sure to pay attention, as sometimes even the smallest details become major plot points later on. At 13 episodes, it's almost too short, but the series works, because it portrays a seemingly small event that sets off a far larger one. Visually, its slightly better than average digimation, with the physics that are accurate and fairly realistic. The vocal cast delivers, as well, with almost all the lines delivered in a well fitted manner. The voices also match the characters, they sound like you think they should sound. The soundtrack is orchestral, as befits this genre. It is a lot to take in, and you almost need to catch your breath after watching it, but if the mood is right, you can watch it again.",1202601600,20,1825,5.006578947368421
