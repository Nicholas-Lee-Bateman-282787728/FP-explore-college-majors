I think the price is a little steep, but I can overlook it since the dance is so fun. We're planning on getting the other discs in the series.",1285200000,,263,3.888888888888889
8293093,5,B001DENNGK,"I purchased this video for my 11 year old son at the beginning of the summer, and mid summer he is asking for the next level. Two other breakdance-type videos have been too difficult, so I am happy that Robotic 101 has simple steps to follow so he found it fun and easy.  His review, ""It is really fun and easy to learn The Robot.  You can learn it quickly if you are flexible and good at stopping quickly.  It is taught very well.""",1280880000,,432,4.119047619047619
