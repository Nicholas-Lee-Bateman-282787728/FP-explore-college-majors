4706811,4,B005HVWVEU,Dvd box is nice with complete episodes in one package. Video quality is top notch and no parts were cropped to make t widescreen. Audio quality is good with 5.1 audio support.

4706812,1,B005HVWVEU,"It is a very lovely DVD. But I can't watch it in Belgium!
They could have shown on this site that they only sold DVDs for American DVD-players exclusively!
Now I'm stuck with a beautiful DVD that I can't even watch and for which I probably will have to pay again 5O euros for shipping to sell it in America because nobody will ever buy it here!
I'm very disappointed in Amazon and I will not buy anything again from this site.",1311811200,,426,4.2073170731707314
4706813,4,B005HVWVEU,"Romeo x Juliet is vaguely based on Shakespeare's play. We all know the story - Romeo and Juliet meet and fall in love, even though their families are sworn enemies against each other. While the story generally follows the original, there are some twists.

The story starts off with Juliet, a young girl who is forced to disguise herself as a boy for reasons unknown to her until her sixteenth birthday. During this time, she works as the city's Zorro, called the Red Whirlwind who saves the people from criminals. Right when the secrets of her past are revealed to her, she meets the love of her life, Romeo, and later both discover the truths behind their families' dark secrets.

I'm not going to spoil the rest of the tale, but the change of events from the first primitive are intriguing. I liked the way they made Juliet with a strong and brave personality and style instead of the weak and delicate nature of the original Juliet. The whole concept of the world being called Neo Verona floating on a cloud and being supported by a tree along with flying horses adds to the imaginative side of the plot.

Although I did not truly get ""into it"" it was still enjoyable to watch and it kept me interested enough to continue. The last few episodes were extremely intense even though I was slightly disappointed the way it ended. I found it annoying when they never stayed consistent with the language (i.e. switching back in forth between normal English and the Shakespearean English.) The drawing was beautiful and simple filled with color and vigor. The voices of the English dubbed were all right and the music was excellent.

All in all, great anime, I recommend it to anybody who is interested in this era of time or story, or anyone who just wants an incredible tragedy to watch.",1302220800,,1785,4.621451104100946
4706814,3,B005HVWVEU,"This was probably the best, and certainly one of the best, animes I have seen to date...all the way up until the end.

While it is nothing like the real Romeo & Juliet, this series is brilliant and fun all the same. The only similarities, in truth, between this and Shakespeare's work are the names...beyond that, this story of masked adventurers, daring capers, tyrannical princes and bloody coups resembles the original in no way. Which is not a criticism, merely an observation -- if you watch this expecting a true-to-the-play tale, you will be disappointed. Also, for Shakespeare aficionados, approach this with a sense of humor, or you may well be livid -- the flirty, flighty, silly, butt wagging, badgered momma's boy ""Willy"" Shakespeare who appears in this series is, without a doubt, hilarious...provided you can allow yourself to laugh at good-natured humor.

The main storyline is as follows: the current Prince murdered Juliet's family -- the ruling house of the Capulets -- to usurp the throne. Juliet, as heir to the Capulet line, must defeat her family's murderer, and reinstate the rule of the house of Capulet. That's the plan, at least...until the heir of the house of Capulet unknowingly meets the heir of the house of Montague...and what was straightforward becomes much less so.

The cast of characters is a superb blend of warriors, politicians, nobles, commoners, soldiers, prisoners, villains, cutthroats, traitors, and heroes. Very few of the characters are ""black and white"" -- from the worst to the best -- but all have their shades of gray that make them thrilling to watch. Romeo and Juliet's love story is perfect; the trials they face, the challenges they must overcome, the vows they must honor...it is all superb stuff.

So, why am I only giving this 3 stars, instead of the 5 that all of the above would indicate it deserves? Because of the plot device the authors used to conclude the tragedy. (Spoilers) The Goddess/Tree of Life must claim female Capulets to keep the floating continent on which the city of Neo Verona resides together...at least, that's what the malicious keeper of the tree says. Juliet is called to make this sacrifice. Romeo tries to save her by killing the wicked tree creature; he succeeds in killing her, but she kills him too. Juliet then -- as the continent begins to crumble -- gives her life to keep the goddess alive, and the goddess' wings (powered by Juliet's life) safely lower the continent onto the planet, beside its fellow continents. Aside from that being one of the worst and most irrelevant-to-the-story ways I can think of to end the story, the entire ""goddess/tree of life"" aspect could have been nixed in favor of keeping with the rest of the storyline. In fairness, the tree of life-plot had been hinted at a few times during the film...but it felt so out of place that one can't help but wonder if the author didn't combine two story ideas, thinking it would add a beautiful tragedy to his tree story to have the heroes be great lovers who die saving the world. I don't know if that's the case or not, but it really seemed like an absurd way to bring the story to its conclusion.

So, I give this 3/5 stars...fantastic, up until the ending...",1296518400,11,3223,4.789568345323741
4706815,5,B005HVWVEU,"I truly loved this anime. I accidentally stumbled upon it on Hulu.com and decided to order the DVD for my collection and to watch it again at a later date.
I was surprised though that Verona (Neo Verona in the anime) was a floating land mass! And to make it more interesting it was held up by the roots of two trees. But what would you expect from animes right? Now if you think this a surprise get ready for another one: a sword wielding Juliet (you go girl!). All this aside I loved the way they developed the attraction between Romeo and Juliet from beginning till end. I also loved that the English dubbed version incorporated Shakespearean dialogue for most of the anime. I think this was appropriate although I would agree with one review that noticed it didn't quite carry all the way to the end. I didn't watch this subbed so I can't comment on the Japanese voices. I think the English voice cast were well-suited for their roles. This is not a DVD for young ones due to tones of violence. I'm glad they weren't any ""overly intimate"" scenes between the two lovers unlike the one with Olivia Hussey where there was a bed scene. I think if the writers incorporated that in this anime it would kill that innocence and purity of their love. I loved the action scenes as well and since I've already posted spoilers I am not going to give away anymore. Well, maybe just one more: Tybalt's cute with his swords ;)",1295049600,,1414,4.421455938697318
4706816,5,B005HVWVEU,"absolutely amazing. This series is really worth the money, you won't regret it. But Warning, it will bewitch you, and it will broke your heart and still you will be in love with it... great anime series",1292716800,,202,4.486486486486487
4706817,5,B005HVWVEU,"I've always been a fan of the classic play of the same name, so I was excited that an anime adaption was in the works. But I never expected anything like this... I've been enjoying anime for many years, and I don't think any other series I've watched has moved and warmed my heart more than ""Romeo x Juliet.""

William Shakespear's classic tale of these two star crossed lovers is taken to a whole new level of excitement, action, suspence, and romance--all housed within a complete series box set. Romeo is a young noblemen and the son of the ruthless Prince Montegue who has brought the helpless and innocent people of Neo Verona to their knees. Juliet is the last surviving member of the slain Capulat family and Neo Verona's only hope for a brighter future. Although they are supposed to despise one another, these two young people simply cannot deny the strong love that they instantly share for each other upon their first meeting. But as they fight to keep their love alive against all odds, will they also be able to end the reign of the vicious tirant Prince Montegue?

This adaption is very loosly based on the play, so not everything is entirely by-the-book. But in the end, the moral of the story is still the same: that the power of true love is strong enough to overcome all obsticals, no matter what.

What more can I say, other than this is an amazing buy! But words really don't do this anime justice--You have to WATCH it. I highly reccomend this product. It may be a little pricey, but you will not regret it!",1287792000,,1527,4.505415162454874
4706818,5,B005HVWVEU,When starting this anime series I didn't know what to think. Did I buy another childish show? Were my hopes too high? Well no... and no... I fell in love with this anime within the first 4 episodes. The story doesn't unfold right away and the beginning of the series can seem quite annoying with a 'Carmen Sandiego' character as a hero figure. The basic love story is quite the same and the the similarities are what make this anime worth watching. The twists in the storyline are a plus and the fact that an assumed William S. himself is in the story as it is happening is amazing! I had bought this product without knowing what I was getting and I couldn't be more happy. I recommend this to anyone who loves a good classic such as anything written by Shakespeare or a story such as The Count of Monte Cristo (another great anime series).,1286755200,,840,4.391025641025641
4706849,5,B005HVWVEU,"I'm not a fan of most shojo series, but I absolutely loved Romeo X Juliet. This reimagining of the classic William Shakespeare play is a romance anime masterpiece. The changes from the original story are numerous and make for and interesting tale despite ultimately knowing the fate of our heroes. If you're looking for a romance series or simply love a mix of anime or Shakespeare I would recommend this series. Plus, as a S.A.V.E. series you can own it for under $20, an absolute steal.",1466899200,,488,4.686046511627907

4706852,5,B005HVWVEU,I love this anime.  I first found out about it when a friend told me I should check it out.  I was so into it that I watched it all in two days.  Upon searching on Amazon I found this DVD of it and decided to get it.  The DVD is good and its in both English and Japanese and both options offer the subtitles.  You just have to go to audio to select the options you want.  This DVD collection also includes some extra's which are pretty neat.  Most of the extra's are in English but that's OK because some of the extra's are just trailers for other Anime's.  One extra is a commentary for the last episode.  This is a commentary by the English actors and writers and such for the English dub version so naturally the commentary is in English.  One other extra is in Japanese because it goes through the making of the show and stuff so that extra has subtitles and there is no option to watch it in English.  I like the fact that the DVD contains both the anime in Japanese and the English dub of it.  I would say that's my favorite thing about it.  This anime is nothing like the actual play of Romeo and Juliet but themes are the same so that's why they say its based off the play.  Its loosely based though but I think its just as good maybe even better.  I encourage everyone especially anime lovers to check it out.  The only thing I kind of didn't like about it was the whole tree thing.  Yet at the same time I did like it for what it was because that brought in an interesting twist to it all.  I won't post any spoilers here so you'll have to watch the anime yourself to see what I mean by tree thing and then decide for yourself if you like it.  Overall though this anime is epic and has become an all time favorite of mine.,1461196800,2,1732,4.071005917159764

The whole series should have a tag line that says inspired by the play, based on that premise should still be a tragic love story. Totally different ending, still tragic, but reminded me of the tree in Avatar and the life force in Final Fantasy. The last 2 eps kind of totally rework a Shakespearean ending into something no longer resembling Romeo and Juliet, but a scifi, fantasy involving female Capulet's life force and trees.
Oh, wait, wasn't this supposed to be about Romeo and Juliet? Like so many promising animes that get you until you see the ending. Die hard fans of anime should otherwise enjoy it.",1391990400,2,774,4.49645390070922

The story is one of my favorite plots. I mean don't get me wrong I love Shakespeare and his version of the story, but this animated old world feel of romeo and juliet was awesome to watch. I  really liked how it was set in a floating sky so it was more of a mystical kind of story instead of the real world. It also had dragon horses which made it feel a bit more intense and royal especially in scenes that revolved around the Montagues.

I would definitely recommend this series for having an amazing plot other than just the star crossed lovers AND for being delivered to me in such good conditions for a used pack. *thumbs up*",1388707200,,879,4.220238095238095

This series is a fantasy. There are a few basic elements similar to the original tale, but the most of it is completely different. That's ok. This fantasy can stand alone as a great work. The characters, animation, and story are very well crafted and compelling. Just forget the name and enjoy it for what it is. It's a very touching story and it may bring a tear to your eye. I enjoyed it and I really hope you do too.",1350518400,,834,4.380645161290323
4706939,5,B005HVWVEU,I first fell in love with this show a few years back and wanted it instantly. The complete series at the time was way too expensive for my tastes and I put it off. Years later it's gone down in price and I bought it in a heartbeat. The storyline and fantasy aspect of this show won me over instantly and I love it more than the play itself. If you found Shakespeare boring just watch this anime and you'll find yourself with a peaked interest but never quite satisfied. The show is way better in my opinion than the play or any movies of it could be.,1349654400,,550,4.101851851851852
4706940,3,B005HVWVEU,"The first 9-10 episodes are incredible but as soon as the love story begin, some characteres loose what make them cool to watch. The ending was well handle but some people may loose interest between episode 13 and say 21 maybe. It still worth my time but was not as great as it could have been. I would have put 3 1/2 if that would have been possible here",1344643200,,355,4.159420289855072
4706941,4,B005HVWVEU,"In fantasy, but still, Romeo and Juliet.  Not entirely faithful either (read fantasy elements), but still, Romeo and Juliet.

Even 10 year olds know how Romeo and Juliet ends... right?  I mean, if you don't know the ending... don't look it up, and try to read a little more.

An interesting take on the Romeo and Juliet story, though the part with Romeo for about three episodes towards the middle-late part of the anime is a complete waste of time.  Romeo and Juliet is titled Romeo and Juliet for a very good reason.  It's about Romeo and Juliet, not Romeo just going off to the ass end of nowhere.",1337990400,,600,4.458715596330276
4706942,3,B005HVWVEU,"Okay, let's get this out of the way.  This is not a faithful adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, by any stretch of the imagination.  It's best to look at this story as its own separate entity rather than as anything related to the Shakespearean play.  If that's a deal breaker, then stop right here.

That said, as someone who can be very anal about that sort of thing, I found myself enjoying this series immensely.  The parallel characters (not just Romeo and Juliet, but other Shakespeare plays) were distracting at first, and at times I still found myself thinking that certain characters shouldn't be acting a certain way, but that thought became less common as the series went on and the story became its own thing.  In fact, if the names were changed, the story could stand on its own just fine.  It is a rather standard good vs. evil story and the way they deal with morality, revolutions, and conflict is rather Disney-esque.  But the characters are likeable and make you care about what's going on and what will happen to them.  I actually found myself caring about Romeo and Juliet more in this version than in the play (which given that the play had the much different message of ""idiots will always bring about not only their own downfall but that of those around them"", isn't too suprising).  I wish that the dub was a bit more consistent with the Shakespearean language, but the fact that they tried and were closer than the Japanese version (which is still beautiful) is definetely worth something.

I would have given the series four stars (with one star taken off for the standard plot), but then... I saw the ending.  There will be spoilers, so be warned while I bring up several points as to why the ending kind of ticked me off.

-The final two episodes could have been condensed to one, or if they must have another they could have filled it with explaining a few things (that's another thing, there's backstory/world-related things that are left unexplained, or not explained enough, like why the world is floating in the sky, who started that-the tree god or the Capulets, why only Capulets can be sacrificed, ect.).

-So Romeo stops Juliet's sacrifice, something that takes a good deal of the last two episodes.  Then he dies, and... Juliet sacrifices herself anyway.  Wow, way to waste episode time.  If they wanted Romeo to die, there's a simple solution: rewrite the part about only Capulets sacrificing themeselves, and say it needs to be a sacrifice made out of love.  Then once Juliet is dead, Romeo sacrifices himself to save that other tree (that's another thing, they brought up that there were two trees, but nothing came of it) so that he can be with Juliet.  The roots for the trees are intertwined, so that would've made for beautiful imagery too.  And the whole ""sacrifice made out of love"" would keep Prince Montague from maintaining the tree.

-I don't understand stopping Juliet's sacrifice.  She's doing it to save the world, and as she's going to the tree she's thinking about all the loved ones she will save.  I thought that was poignet, seeing her willingly going to her death to save those she cared for.  But then Romeo comes and tries to stop her, while the world is crumpling around them, and talks her out of it.  Congratulations, you've doomed not only yourselves, but all your dearests friends (friends who, need I remind you, put their lives on the line for you).  It actually made me really dislike Romeo, and Tybalt to an extent since he told Romeo of Juliet's sacrifice (but with Tybalt it was established that he wasn't as altruistic as Romeo).

-Making Ophelia suddenly some evil creature.  It just... was so weird.  Yes, she was a mysterious figure and we knew little about her, but it still felt like a dark twist for no other reason than to have a dark twist.

-In truth, everything involving the tree was weird to me.  I would've preferred it if it had ended right after the revolution was won, and Romeo and Juliet had died at the end (maybe Prince Montague actually does end up running Juliet through, but Romeo gets in the way and is run through as well) with none of the stuff with the tree in the show at all.  But if they really wanted to to the tree thing, there were much better ways to do it.

The ending is, unfortunately, what really drags this series down for me.  Would've been four stars but for it.",1336608000,5,4373,4.6
4706943,4,B005HVWVEU,"As an anime fan, my favorite shows are Cowboy Bebop, Baccano!, and Trigun, among many others.  Mainly, I like lots of great action and cool characters in my anime.  So I was rather surprised when I fell in love with Romeo X Juliet.  The first few episodes rank up there with the best episodes of any anime, anywhere.  The animation, story, and dialogue are wonderful.

Unfortunately, the quality drops somewhat in later episodes.  The animation isn't as lush, and the flowerly (but fun!) Shakespearean-style dialogue isn't as developed.  And the story definitely takes a turn for the weird.  Having said that, the series as a whole is still worthwhile, and what had potential to be an awesome A+ anime series merely turns out to be pretty darn good one, even with the later flaws.

I did purchase the S.A.V.E. edition of this title, which contains 4 discs in a clear plastic case with that ugly green S.A.V.E. banner on the side of the cover sheet.  But fear not!  The cover is reversible, so to get rid of the ugly green banner, just flip the cover insert.  You'll get the same front cover image, but without the green S.A.V.E. banner on the side.  The flipped back cover image is a simple episode listing.  The S.A.V.E. edition also contains all of the special features of the other editions of this title, including commentary for the final episode, a ""making of"" featurette, and multiple trailers.  All of which makes this cheaper S.A.V.E. edition a great buy.",1330214400,14,1464,4.7312252964426875
4706944,5,B005HVWVEU,It came in excellent condition and well packaged and everything Hopefully the show is good in the end cause I bought it as a gift.,1329436800,,130,4.24
4706945,5,B005HVWVEU,"I can't put my finger on exactly what enticed me to buy this sense I've never read Shakespeare or watched any Romeo and Juliet movies but what ever it was I'm glad I went with it.
Romeo x Juliet blew me away on just about every aspect I could think of, the story, the writing, voice acting, music, animation, you name it this show hit a home run. The whole environment they created within the original story was awesome and it made you think about what was going to happen without going over your head and made good use of the 24 episode format. All the characters are lovable or detestable (depending on which one) and the voices match up great, I especially liked Juliet because quite frankly she was just a badass. The music was a perfect match, disposing with the anime guitars and using more subtle tones and the action sequences were well done.
The SAVE set is exactly as advertised, super amazing vale edition, 17.99 is almost like stealing.
It all came together to form a unique creation that didn't need flashy gimmicks or over the top antics, but used excellent storytelling and character development and should have a place in any anime collection.",1328486400,,1159,4.603864734299517
4706946,5,B005HVWVEU,"I absolutely adore this show. I was interested in it once I heard there was an anime version of Romeo and Juliet, but be warned that the plot is extremely different from the original play. Frankly, I think the series could have held its own with different names for the characters and a different title. It was just that good.

Juliet was definitely my favorite thing about it. She's an extremely strong female lead, and I loved her. Yet I also loved Romeo. He's very gentle, kind and determined; almost her complete opposite. They balanced each other out very well really added to their chemistry. As a couple, they were completely natural and likable. I really loved them together- they brought me to tears many times.

I really adored the detailed plot. Without giving any spoilers, I thought that the pacing was amazing. The Montague's hunt for Juliet, the last Capulet, has created such a desperate situation in Neo Verona that I didn't think it could get any worse. It always did. The stakes were raised higher and higher and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The story was fantastic and well done- until the ending.

Really, the only downside to this show is the plot device used for the ending. It feels tacked on and does a total disservice to otherwise amazing plot, but I still have to give this show five stars because even though I didn't like the end, I truly adored series as a whole. I came up with much better endings that fit with the rest of the plot and I'm pretending the last two episodes never happened. Yet even with the bad ending, this is a show that I would encourage anyone to watch. This is a show you need to see. This is a show with brilliant plot development, likable supporting characters, lovable main characters, decent action and heart-wrenching romance. Get it now.

On pricing and packaging, this is the first time I have ever bought a S.A.V.E. edition and I am very impressed. I expected cheap packaging, but the case I got was made of firm plastic, with each of the 4 disks inside like pages of a book. It's really great for the price. I wouldn't have been able to buy the more expensive version so I'm very grateful for the S.A.V.E. edition allowing me to own this show at a reasonable price.

The opening theme is Inori, a version of You Raise Me Up that I think really fits the show. I thought that the first ending theme, Cyclone, was perfect for the series! That was such a good song. I didn't like that it changed to the second ending, Goodbye Yesterday.

All in all, I have to say that I am extremely happy with my purchase. Despite the ending, I enjoyed the journey this show took me on, and I will be rewatching it. I fell in love with their love. And so should you.",1328054400,22,2727,4.43313373253493

Watching this Show is addicting. Quite different from the original play by W.S. This show has a story of its own and is worth watching over and over again.",1327968000,2,348,3.9857142857142858
4706948,5,B005HVWVEU,"The producers or someone must have loved Josh Groben. His ""You Raise Me Up"" is very common in this series, and a fair amount of other music seems inspired by it. The story is loosely based upon the play by William Shakespeare, but is (IMO) more enjoyable. When reading a play or watching a reproduction - live or in a movie - I've never been particularly fond of any of Shakespeare's tragedies, Romeo and Juliet in particular. (His comedies tend to be more enjoyable, though.)

In this series, however, I have found a version I can wholeheartedly approve of. It's still a tragedy, but there's actually some purpose to it now. Romeo and Juliet have some prominent roles of their own in ""Neo Verona"", and not just as members of noble families that are at odds. You come to care about them not just for being star-crossed lovers, but because of who they are, as well. I've never felt that the play gave enough depth to them. Here's that missing depth.

I originally came across this series in a preview for another Anime, proceeded to watch it online, and loved it enough to buy it.

Basic Plot:

<Spoilers for the rest of this review>

At the very beginning, the Capulets are the ruling family in Neo Verona, which is ruled by a ""prince,"" not a king. The head of house Montague stages a coup, slaughtering every member of the family he can find, thus seizing the crown for himself. Juliet grows up as a fugitive without realizing it, as she blocks the memories of the tragedy, and doesn't remember her family name. She survives partially because her caretakers insist she dress and act as a boy named Odin. They intend to reveal her identity on her 16th birthday (iirc) and she is fed up with the long wait to understand all the rules and restrictions she must live under. She lives in a theater owned by one William Shakespeare, an eccentric noble who writes plays. She becomes the ""Red Whirlwind"" to stand up for an oppressed people living under a tyrannical head of state and his soldiers.

Romeo is the son of Prince Montague, and is betrothed against his will to the daughter of another noble. He and his Best friend Benvolio save the ""Red Whirlwind"" and a companion from some soldiers after they free the soldiers' prisoner - a young girl accused of being heir to the Capulet name. As time goes on, he starts to see more and more injustice in Neo Verona, and comes to see the Red Whirlwind is in the right, and his father is an oppressive tyrant to the people.

Shortly before her birthday when Juliet will learn who she is, one of the actresses who work for ""Willie"" presses ""Odin"" to go as a female companion to a Ball the actress has been invited to by a noble patron. Due to some confusion, the noble takes Juliet and leaves the actress behind. At the ball, Juliet meets Romeo, but doesn't realize who he is. Over time, she comes to love him, and then finds out who he is. Then, the truth is revealed about her identity, and she remembers her family's slaughter. She is torn between her new love for Romeo and her sense of duty to her family's loyal retainers, who demand of her to seek retribution against Montague. In the middle of this, her good friend, Doctor Uzuki, sacrifices himself as the ""Red Whirlwind"" to protect her and save a group of people who have been seized on suspicion of being the Red Whirlwind themselves. Then, the Capulets are routed by a group of Montague's guards, and she is taken into hiding, again, by a man known only as Tybalt. She is distraught, and wanders out of her hiding place, collapsing in front of the nunnery Romeo's mother has inhabited since the coup was staged by her husband. Romeo's mother takes her in, concealing her from Prince Montague, and sends for Romeo. When Juliet recovers physically, she and Romeo leave Neo Verona to seek a place they can live in peace, and they find a church in a forest where they exchange vows. His father, however, sends guards to seek his son, and when a nearby town is seized, Romeo and Juliet realize they have to go back.

They fight the guards and are captured and escorted back, where Juliet is promptly imprisoned and sentenced to execution. Romeo assists her retainers in rescuing her, and she goes to Mantua to hide again. Romeo is banished to a mine when he refuses to submit to his father. At the mine, he makes a friend, Petruchio, who subsequently dies of illness, and his actions towards Petruchio and his memory impress the other miners, who were sentenced to the mines for ""crimes against the state,"" such as stealing food for their families. The mine collapses and Romeo takes the miners and staff to the abandoned village he and Juliet found when they were looking for a place to live away from the conflict, when his father refuses his request to pardon the prisoners and return with them. They start to rebuild.

Juliet, meanwhile, is still in Mantua, where Willie has finished his latest play - her life story. At the opening performance, she appears as the Red Whirlwind, returned from the dead, to incite a revolution. She leads a force against Neo Verona, and when they capture the outer city, she is revealed by an enemy archer's arrow to be Juliet, heir of house Capulet. Then, when visiting her parents' grave, learns she will have to sacrifice herself to ""Escalus"", a divine tree that sustains the land, or the people will all die. Romeo comes back to Neo Verona, despite his father's commands to the contrary, to stand beside Juliet, hoping to get his father to abdicate, bringing a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

Romeo's father rejects the proposal and sends his soldiers out to burn Neo Verona. The nobility is disillusioned, and the soldiers start to realize what kind of monster they're serving, and surrender the inner city. Tybalt confronts Prince Montague, having disguised himself as a soldier, because he's learned of Escalus and how Juliet will sacrifice herself, and he wants to find a way to save her, and he thinks Montague may know a way. Also, a short while ago, it was revealed he is also Montague's son, Romeo's illegitimate half-brother. Romeo shows up to execute his father for betraying the people he is supposed to protect. Then Juliet shows up with her retainers. Tybalt and Romeo stand down, and just as it looks like there may be a peaceful resolution after all, Mercutio stabs Montague in the back. Romeo renounces his claim to the throne, Juliet's retainers start planning her coronation, and Tybalt stands in the background. Montague's body is laid out to prepare for burial, and when Romeo visits the body, Tybalt tells him about the sacrifice Juliet intends to make.

Back at the palace, Juliet has left her retainers to go to Escalus, and they are searching for her when Romeo returns to find her and keep her from killing herself. Escalus is dying, and earthquakes are becoming near constant, but he can't bear the thought of such a sacrifice. He finds her just before she reaches Escalus, and they fight. In the fight, they learn through how the other is fighting exactly what the other is feeling, and Juliet agrees to not go to Escalus, since neither wants to live in a world where the other doesn't exist. Then, Escalus drags Juliet away magically, and Romeo pursues. He ends up fighting Escalus' priestess, and Juliet's retainers show up and aid him. He manages to kill the priestess and save Juliet, but the priestess' last action mortally wounds him. He and Juliet say goodbye, then she tells her retainers to flee. She channels the last of Escalus' power to drop Neo Verona - which is revealed as a floating island - safely into the ocean below. She dies as a result, joining Romeo in death. Their friends survive, and Willie has his masterpiece.",1324771200,2,7708,4.63956043956044

I didn't see how you could put Romeo and Juliet into a mystical setting but somehow it works and really amazing thing is how they managed to interweave the Shakespeare references into the narrative.  Takes 4 or 5 episodes to really get going but stick with it you will not be disappointed.,1522195200,,511,4.368421052631579
8473864,5,B005HVWVEU,"I have always been deeply drawn to the idea of Romeo and Juliet: forbidden love, not being able to live without each other, and the idea that love could bring feuding families to reconciliation. This is, I feel, the best realization of those themes.

The fantasy elements work wonderfully with the main plot. Romeo x Juliet is both action-packed and thoughtful, with wonderful versions of these characters. Juliet is strong, both brave and well trained with a sword. But she also has a deep level of compassion that changes the course of the story several times. This is also her greatest strength, in my opinion. I love that she is able to be strong and capable without losing her kindness. Romeo is also a kind and compassionate leader. It takes him time to realize how his father's rule has hurt and deceived the kingdom, but once he does, Romeo is willing to do whatever he can to help his people. Even if it means putting his own life at risk.
