8658018,4,B00KE3B8OK,"great look at look on the streets amongst the common couples, everyday kind of people in faux romantic 1953 Italy whereby there was little cash afloat and less to be made. stark reality of tolls taken on big promises made by men to profess love to get sex then cop out when she becomes laden with child. a spineless sort of male cruses/rules over putting women in their place while they cavort boasting/bravado. romance tossed on it's rear as selfish needs as post war hang over has grip on survival in most base and bitter forms, 6 - 7 directors get their swats with the film bat in vignettes about the all and bad of it.",1425513600,4,622,4.370689655172414
