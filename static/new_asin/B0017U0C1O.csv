Drive Thru NZ has never disappointed me. The band of surfers in this film is very memorable and watching the group explore the coasts is just very cool. It's very documentary/home movie, not a plotted film, so don't ask too much from it. It's great in its simplicity.",1341878400,,413,4.447368421052632
8267279,3,B0017U0C1O,"This video is fun for being a glimpse at the New Zealand surf scene and some of the landscape of that country, and shows a ton of skilled wave-ripping by the Drive-Thru team; but the photography is lackluster, the music isn't great, and the camaraderie of the surfers while they're out of the water is occasionally amusing but usually boring as all hell.  This video would understandably & justifiably be an awesome souvenir & memento for any of the guys who were actually on this trip, but for the rest of us it often feels like watching someone else's family vacation slideshow.

For comparison to a surf-travel video with much higher standards in photographic quality, music soundtrack quality, editing quality, and even (I hate saying it but it's true) surfing quality, check out any of the Quiksilver ""Team Young Gun"" titles:
- ""Kelly Slater & the Young Guns""
- ""Young Guns II""
- ""Young Guns 3""",1257552000,,899,4.756410256410256
