8145329,4,B000IFSERS,I've seen this before and I am well aware of the events that happened that faithful Christmas Day.  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because the English on the Disk did not work.  It's a shame because I  know that I would have loved to have watched it.  The video quality was top notch.  Just so you know the audio languages that were available were French and German.,1451260800,5,383,4.191780821917808

8145332,4,B000IFSERS,"Just picked this up in Toys R Us. It's the original 50's cartoon
and my kids love it. Casper is only in one story though? They do show about a couple of minutes of another Casper episode and then just cut it off half way through. This is ridiculous and had my kids running in and saying "" Dad, Dad there's something wrong with the video "". Obviously no quality control.",1038960000,,369,4.211267605633803
8145333,4,B000IFSERS,"A nice collection of three Christmas themed Harveytoons for the cartoon fanatic on your Christmas list. This tape contains the very first Herman and Katnip cartoon ""Mice Meeting You"", Casper the Friendly Ghost in ""True Boo"", and Baby Huey in ""Jumping with Toy"". This tape also has a two minute clip from the Casper cartoon ""Ice Scream"". The only reason I gave this four stars is because of it's very puny length, and how the print of ""Jumping with Toy"" is very poor. Other than those two drawbacks, it's very well worth getting.",1007164800,,528,4.688172043010753
