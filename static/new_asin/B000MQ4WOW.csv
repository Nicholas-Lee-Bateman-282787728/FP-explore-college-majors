8170892,5,B000MQ4WOW,"This is a one-stop thrilling glance at a century of basketball, more than a history lesson of the 'lesser' sport of our day. This documentary should be on every basketball player's list of essentials. Not only do you see the likes of basketball greats we will never see the likes of again, but it also serves as a serious warning of its endangered status. It has noteworthy special features, but the momentary intrusion of censorship on Rick Barry's comments, the unnecessary inclusion of David Stern, the face of corporate handlers who show little ownership to the increasing violence and loose refereeing, anything to 'slow' the popularity and money flowing to the players. It is fitting that Ian Naismith, the protector of Naismith's essential moral core,who gets no package recognition for his honorable deed in setting Dr. Naismith's record for the DVD generation, stands across from a McDonald's restaurant where the game was first played. I took that moment as a dreadful warning to those who see the game as entertainment/money alone. Once this point gets lost, as the first 13 rules of the game did, the game may continue its twisted development for the TV palate into one unhealthy meal. To see coach Crittendon, to hear the collective wisdom from humble Bob Cousy and the late Red Auerbach, the sagely bits from Oscar Robertson only increases the value of this special sport documentary.",1245110400,2,1398,5.0042918454935625
