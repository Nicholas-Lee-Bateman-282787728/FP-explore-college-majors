3047835,5,B00104J3EO,"This was a wonderful documentary of the history of the band Tad and the Seattle music scene in the late 80's and early 90's along with being an insiders look at the beginnings and ending of the Sub-Pop explosion. You get to know Tad Doyle and Kurt Danielson a little bit along with other members of Tad. You get to kind of go for a ride through their career. It was a keen look into a ""real"" Rockers world. This was very well done and down to earth.
This was a wonderful piece of work.",1205971200,5,485,4.11578947368421

8237145,5,B00104J3EO,"TAD schooled us!! At least those of us that were tuned in to the Seattle mad scene when the 90's settled on that music soaked city and spawned what was labeled the Grudge thing. To me, it was just originality at its best and TAD was the heaviest metal on Earth. Yes, there was and remains the Melvins for heavy ... can't forget that. Even Thomas Doyle would have to tip his lid for them. But, TAD took the front stage at that time. Read my Melvins reviews for the rest on them.",1423872000,,477,4.139784946236559

8237147,5,B00104J3EO,"Awesome look into the band Tad and the person that is Tad Doyle from the inception of his early tracks to the band's final recordings. Interviews with Mark Arm of Mudhoney, Jack Endino (Reciprocal Studios in Seattle, also recorded Nirvana's ""Bleach""-era material), Kim Thayil of Soundgarden, Jon Poneman and Bruce Pavitt (of Sub-Pop) and many others! In-depth and informative with lots of Tad's music to mosh to! Also includes the videos! Pick up this DVD and enjoy!",1352419200,,466,5.064935064935065

8237149,5,B00104J3EO,"I loved TAD back in the day. TAD's music was (and still is) one of the pinnacles of hesher metal, in my opinion. Forget grunge, forget heavy metal, forget sludge, TAD kills them all.

I was excited to see this documentary, if only to bring back all those memories of the early 90s. As a history of the Seattle 90s grunge scene, it excels. As a history of TAD (and Tad Doyle the man) it excels even further, even though it's heartbreaking to watch Tad recount what could have been, if only TAD's fortune had been a little more favorable. There was setback after setback, dooming TAD to a footnote when they could have been on top of it all. The DVD is a sad thing to watch, if you're a fan.",1292284800,3,689,4.21969696969697
8237150,5,B00104J3EO,"Well being a fan of Tad for some time, this movie really gave me the fix I needed by this big lug of a man. Classic footage of the band interspersed with interviews by the man himself and his bassist Kurt. Well worth it even if you don't even know his music. It actually feels a bit like ""This is Spinal Tap""(unintentionally).",1220054400,5,326,4.274193548387097
