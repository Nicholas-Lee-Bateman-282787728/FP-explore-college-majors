4285621,5,B00480OCCU,"Some film images stay with you...forever.  The scenes where the sad clown allows himself to be slapped by other clowns - not once but dozens of times - represents a form of eternal punishment for the man's failure to keep his wife chaste from another  and his scientific discovery safe from a rival's theft.  Those episodes of slapping are quite disturbing. Unforgettable, actually.  It is a solid credit to Lon Chaney's superb acting that he makes the viewer internalize the pain....even though the rude crowd finds the repeated slapping laughably funny.

After some time has passed, the poor clown allows himself to love again, to hope again. He falls for a beautiful circus performer.  Alas, he is thwarted again by rivals...one of whom is the same person who stole his happiness before. But this time, the clown has a plan.",1288569600,9,827,4.871428571428571
4285622,5,B00480OCCU,"There is a lot beneath the surface of this silent movie that should resonate with us all.  Outwardly, it is the story of a man who allows his life's work to be stolen from him, enters a purgatory of a circus, and finally redeems himself.

Inwardly, perhaps from a Jungian perspective, it is the story of ultimate self betrayal, of being slapped by oneself, of denigrating and surrendering one's deepest value, and then of laughing at one's own pain.  Then the redemption of time, of suffering, of enacting or accepting what had one done -- by becoming a clown in the move or in real life -- until one begins to love a part of oneself again and is willing to protect it to the death.

Great performances all around.  Very powerful.",1446940800,,730,4.5
4285623,4,B00480OCCU,"This is the first movie entirely prepared and produced by MGM Studios. This is the story of scientist (Lon Chaney) who started a new life as a circus clown after his wife runs away with his patron-friend. Incidentally his friend also steals his discoveries and takes credit at the academic council. After Chaney joins the circus, he falls in love with a female performer (Norma Shearer). But the daredevil horseback rider of the circus, played by John Gilbert also falls in love with the same girl. Unfortunately, the father of Norma Shearer wants her to marry a wealthy baron, but she rejects the baron and declares love for Gilbert. Strange circumstances make the baron and the father of Norma Shearer killed by a lion.

The story is based on a Russian play staged on Broadway few years earlier by the Theater Guild. It was a risky choice for the studios debut since the story shows the killing of two human beings by a lion. However the film was highly profitable for MGM Studios in the freshman year, and it was critically hailed upon release. It was also the first film to feature Leo the Lion as the mascot of MGM.

The studio bosses Louis Mayer and Irving Thalberg, after careful consideration, assigned three major actors for this project; John Gilbert, Norma Shearer and Lon Chaney and assigned Swedish director Victor Seastrom to direct this film. Their strategy paid off and MGM went on to become one of the greatest studios in Hollywood.",1445472000,,1449,4.746031746031746
4285624,4,B00480OCCU,"great movie, and very unusual. The score is only so-so, not as fitting as authentic scoring. I shopped price from the vendor I chose through Amazon and I think I was sold a bootleg. The disc looks like a home-baked DVD off of someone's computer compared to a commercially distributed DVD and the insert card in the package looked like it was scanned and printed on a home printer.
I got the movie I wanted, and it plays perfectly, with good quality picture, the original 1924 film source taken into consideration.",1380672000,,513,4.648351648351649
4285625,3,B00480OCCU,"As a lover of silent movies, I'm thrilled to see this film, one of the all-time great silents, available on DVD. I was less thrilled to see it treated with so little respect. The print, though not horrible, needs much restoration. And Warner has slapped on a cheap, poorly edited, patchwork score that has little care for transitions and ranges from acceptable to downright irritating. The film is not even played at the correct speed, causing the actors' movements to be jerky. What a pity the original score is not included. The result is to severely diminish a highly artistic, moving, and often terrifying film. The fact that it is still fascinating shows just how powerful a film it is, and thus deserving of greater attention. My suggestion to Warner: at least slow the film down to the correct speed. Next time I watch it, I'll listen to my iPod.",1353283200,10,853,4.693333333333333
4285626,5,B00480OCCU,"Just some brief comments on this silent Lon Chaney classic...

He Who Gets Slapped (1924) has to be one of the creepiest if not the creepiest circus/clown themed movie I've ever seen.  The movie is silent, obviously in black and white, the white face clowns are plentiful and creepy, the circus is creepy, and the music is well suited to the imagery.  In my opinion, white face clowns are the creepiest clowns of all, and this movie has lots of them.  The story is intriguing and sad, but the creepiness complements the story and plot superbly.  Lon Chaney delivers arguably his greatest performance on screen.  This movie also stars Norma Shearer and John Gilbert, both of whom give good performances.

If you're a coulrophobic, watch this movie.  It'll make your coulrophobia go up ten notches and give you lots of nightmares (ha! ha!).  If you're not a coulrophobic, this is the movie of your most pleasant dreams and you'll be as happy as a pig in mud.",1352592000,8,956,4.676646706586826

4285628,1,B00480OCCU,"All my life I have loved silent films. I have seen as many as possible and have a large collection of them. This is a fine film, but Warner has done a disgraceful thing. It has released this film at 24fps speed when the film was shot at about 18fps. In most silent films the director may decide to shoot some scenes at a slower than normal rate for dramatic purposes, but those of us who love silent films know that in 1924, cameramen were still shooting at slower than the speeds that were standardized later for sound films - 24fps. Warner just released it at sound speed and at that speed provided a sound track for theater release. Looking at this release the film seems almost complete. It runs 72 minutes on the Warner DVD. The original time on release in 1924 was 95 minutes. That means the film was probably shot at 18-19fps, and using the 24fps speed Warner's DVD at over 30% too fast. I suggest that viewers watch the movement of Norma Shearer and John Gilbert in their bucolic love scene and see that they are moving much too rapidly. This film should be gauged for the correct speed by experts and then corrected and a new soundtrack produced. A considerable part of the Warner DVD's score is wonderfully creative, and personally I would like to see the best of it incorporated into the new score.",1331510400,48,1309,4.458333333333333
4285629,5,B00480OCCU,"He Who Gets Slapped (1924) is part of the 2011 Warner Archive Lon Chaney collection, and in this film Chaney gives one of his most natural, assured performances--in no small part due to director Victor Sjostrom,  who also directed Chaney, with Norma Shearer, in the following year's Tower Of  Lies (unfortunately, yet another lost film).  Victor Sjostrom is something of an icon.  He was a favorite director of stars Greta Garbo and Lillian Gish, and his masterpiece,The Phantom Carriage (1921), was a considerable influence on Ingmar Bergman.  After the coming of sound Sjostrom retired from directing to return to his first love of acting, but he still served as mentor to the young Bergman; Bergman repaid the favor by casting Sjostrom in the extraordinarily beautiful role of Dr. Isak Borg  for Wild Strawberries (1957, possibly Bergman's greatest film).

After seeing the films Sjostrom had made in Sweden, Producer Irving Thalberg  recruited Sjostrom to Hollywood.  He Who Gets Slapped was the first film the director made at MGM, and it proved to be a lucrative endeavor for all concerned.  Sjostrom was one of the few directors respected by both Louis B. Mayer and Thalberg.  He Who Gets Slapped is based off the 1914 play by Leonid Andreyev.  The resulting film looks, thinks and acts far more European than anything Hollywood studios had produced at that time.

It is a tale of degradation, humiliation, pathos, and sacrifice.  Thankfully, it is a film in which we do not find ourselves rooting for the Donald Trumps or Paris Hiltons of the world.  Chaney is the destitute but prolific scientist Paul Beaumont, so dedicated in his work that he, inevitably, is rendered the oblivious fool.  Beaumont's filthy rich patron is the Baron de Regnard (Marc McDermott).  Regnard has been helping himself to Beaumont's selfish wife Maria (Ruth King) and additionally plans to steal the fruit of Beaumont's scientific labors.

The world of Paul Beaumont comes crashing down when Regnard presents Beaumont's work, as his own, to the Academy.  Beaumont tries, in vain, to convince the Academy of the theft, but they take the side of the affluent Regnard as opposed to the unknown, poverty stricken Beaumont.  Beaumont is belittled  by his patron's betrayal, by the mocking laughter of the academy, by the discovery of his wife's infidelity, and, finally, by Regnard's humiliating slap to his face.  It is a slap which Beaumont now obsessively echoes in repetition every night.  On the road to the discovery of his Magnificat, Paul becomes `HE.'

The clown He Who Gets Slapped (HE) is soon the rage of the Paris circus.  Underneath HE's face paint is the former Paul Beaumont, who repeats that cruel moment of humiliation again and again and again, every night, in performance.  Audiences make a star of the clown who gets slapped one hundred times a night.  HE is in love with Consuelo (Norma Shearer- who soon became Mrs. Irving Thalberg), the beautiful bareback rider, but she is in love with Bezano (John Gilbert, the original inspiration for the doomed star of  A Star is Born ) which, of course, means unrequited love for HE.

HE expresses his love for Consuelo, who, in believing HE is joking, laughs at him.  HE takes the laugh, but HE cannot take the return of the Regnard, who has conspired with Consuelo's father, Count Mancini (Tully Marshall) to take Consuelo's hand in marriage.  To lift the lowly and scatter the elite calls for nothing less than Biblical justice, in the form of the animal kingdom.

Chaney's HE is one of his most masterful portrayals.  Chaney resembles a character straight out of a Flannery O' Connor narrative.  His pathetic desperation, dementia, humility, and redemptive dignity are fully intact.  Oddly, Chaney is best known for his roles in two Universal features, The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) and Phantom of the Opera (1925).  While Chaney's acting was indisputably superb in both of those epic films, the movies themselves are flawed by unimaginative directing, leaving one to wonder how much better they might have been if Chaney had been under the helm of a director like Sjostrom or Tod Browning.

He Who Gets Slapped is not without its flaws.  The intrusive vignettes focusing on the romance between Gilbert and Shearer (no doubt the result of producer Thalberg, who wanted to highlight the sex appeal of his soon to be wife and matinee idol Gilbert) are of considerably less interest than the main story.  Despite being saddled with THE Hollywood studio, Sjostrom's work here is innovative and often surreal, making him a superb collaborator for Chaney.  This makes the loss of their second collaboration, Tower of Lies (1925), all the more tragic.  Still, the official release of the long-buried He Who Gets Slapped is one of the most welcome of the year.

4285630,5,B00480OCCU,"This might be the best Lon Chaney film ever made. It strikes such an unusual tone. And the use of clown imagery is haunting and evocative of a time long gone. Chaney has many moments that can rip your heart out. His use of the clown smile creates utter tension between humor and pain conveying depths of torn emotion. Norma Shearer is also quite interesting in this film. And the circus imagery is beyond classic.

The only real quibble I have with this Warner Archive edition is that the soundtrack while not wholly inappropriate is a sort of mishmash of various styles. They need to commission a new score and get this a better release. The clarity of the film is great. There are occasional film glitches and spots that also are begging for a nice restoration. But I'm not complaining. I saw this with piano accompaniment in New York once and have been desperate to see it again. I'm grateful for this edition.",1311984000,14,913,4.567073170731708
4285631,5,B00480OCCU,"I am a long time fan of Lon Chaney Sr and welcome releases of films that have lain in vaults far too long. This is one that shows Chaney's skill at delievering the goods even behind heavy clown makeup. True, the story's dated but you watch this for Chaney, not the plot.
The soundtrack also isn't offensive, unlike their release of ""Mr. Wu"" which has a horrible, unlistenable soundtrack that has nothing to do with the film and ""composed"" by someone with no taste or talent whatsoever. If Warners is going to bring us more silents, someone needs to do a little work and look for the scores composed for these films and should be somewhere in the studio archives. The little bit of work won't take that much out of the profits.",1289865600,7,726,4.466165413533835
8418452,2,B00480OCCU,"(Warner Archives DVD) The video quality is just OK. The contrast is good, but the film is full of specks, streaks, some lines. The picture ""jumps up and dowm"" for much of the film, and some scenes ""jump"" to the next, as though the film skips. The modern soundtrack is too modern in places, not fit for a silent movie.

The movie itself is morbid, sad, unfunny and downright disturbing. The titles tell us and want us to believe that seeing a person (or clown in this case) get slapped is the most hilarious stunt ever. REALLY? I find it very unsettling. How this movie ranks high with critics is beyond me. They must be basing their praise on technical merit rather than entertainment value. Even though I don't appreciate the subject matter of the film, it doesn't deter from Lon Chaney's performance, which, maybe because he is one of the 20th century's greatest actors, makes the film believable ... and so depressing.",1526774400,,921,4.6503067484662575
8418453,1,B00480OCCU,"I share the disdain of some of the reviewers on here, i.e., that the soundtracks on the majority of these Lon Chaney WB Archives are stock scores scraped up from the bottom of the barrel - and just slapped on these discs with absolutely no regard to appropriateness or taste.

8418455,5,B00480OCCU,"An amazing silent film of a poor researcher whose wife abandoned him for a richer man - his own best friend who at the last minute stole credit for the poor man's years of research.  Somehow, he gave up any further research and ended up becoming a clown, of all things.  He found it deeply strange  that the circus audience got their greatest thrill when his act included someone slapping him.  This, of course, hit him hard in another way since it all seemed so representative of his life - getting a 'slap' in the face by his wife & his best friend, and then having his colleagues refuse to believe that it was he who had actually done the research and then began laughing at his claim.  A very symbolic film that isn't entirely devoid of justice.  If you watch the biographical film of Lon Chaney's life, you will learn of his own tragedies, one after another, and how it was he ended up playing heavily made-up monstrous types to keep his little son.  That film is called ""Man of 1,000 Faces,"" as he was often called.",1505347200,,1021,4.398936170212766

8418457,5,B00480OCCU,"I'm hardly a silent film buff--but I am a fan of Lon Chaney--and I have seen nearly all of his surviving features. Not being an expert on silents, I'm not sure if some of the comments here are on the mark--as far as the feature being projected too fast--but it didn't deter my enjoyment of the film. The score--to my ears--could have been better as well; but again, it didn't take away from another stellar Lon Chaney silent.

Unrequited love is prevalent in pretty much any Chaney film--or at least all that I've seen--and it helps in adding pathos to whatever characters Lon is playing. Here, in ""He,"" Lon is a wronged man who runs away to find solace in the circus life as a put upon clown & ends up getting a rather gruesome revenge on the man who wronged him & loses his life in the process. A very moving scene in the closing reels as we see Lon slip away--and I don't think I'm giving anything away with a movie this old.

At any rate--if you like Lon Chaney--then this is a must see feature of the silent era...

8418458,1,B00480OCCU,"Amen to the detailed speed criticism.  It is much too fast.  The present soundtrack is not the original.  It is so distractingly bad, I cannot watch this film with the sound on.  The score should be a simple piano or organ treatment, at times mimicking a creepy calliope.  It needs to convey something of what is happing onscreen.  For instance, when the orchestra is playing music for the horse act, the conductor is clearly beating in 3/4 time, and the present soundtrack is in duple time.  Other sections of the score sound like cheap travel film or Muzak, having nothing to do with the emotional  nature of the scene.  It is cobbled together and just plain wrong.  I ca't believe anyone got paid to create such rubbish.

The only reason I care to make this review, is the film is so fine, it deserves to be restored.  I would give the film five stars, the music and speed errors get zero stars.",1483142400,4,898,4.4753086419753085

Lon Chaney gives one of the greatest performances in cinema history here. Everything great about Chaney is on full display in this film. If you like Chaney and you like the device of the circus used as a dark metaphor for life then you will almost certainly like this film. And I would like to point out also that this film is based on a play/drama by the great early 20th century Russian writer, Leonid Andreyev. Andreyev remains largely unknown in the USA, but he stands in the ranks of the great Russian writers. This meeting of Chaney and Andreyev is a genuine treasure.

When I purchased it, it was to see Lon Chaney, the man of a thousand faces. But everyone in the cast is excellent, including beautiful Norma Shearer and charming John Gilbert. Produced by the incomparable Irving Thalberg, this silent film is a stunner; there are moments when your heart practically stops with pity.
