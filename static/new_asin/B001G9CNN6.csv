8304608,5,B001G9CNN6,"Generally speaking I was very pleased to have this DVD, inasmuch as this is the only DVD of this fantastic series available for American audiences.  That being said, I have to agree with others that the picture quality is rather dark and muddy.  But until a better example comes along (and I hope sometime it will) this will have to do.  At least I was able to satisfy a little of my Worzel Gummidge craving.",1405728000,,408,4.413333333333333
8304609,2,B001G9CNN6,I was greatly looking forward to watching this.  As far as I know it's the only WG available for the US market.  The transfer is somewhat muddy and it's so washed out it might as well be black and white.  Mr. Pertwee et al deserve better.,1387843200,,238,4.130434782608695
8304610,4,B001G9CNN6,"Worzel Gummidge (played by Doctor Who Jon Pertwee) is a great character.  It's about a scarecrow who keeps getting into mischief, and pines over Aunt Sally who won't give him the time of day unless she wants something.  This Christmas special is among the best episodes.  Too bad they haven't seen fit to release the whole series in the U.S.  You have to buy the import and play it on a multi-standard machine that plays PAL Region 2 (or get it from a satellite feed from a Canadian channel).  Unfortunately I found the picture quality of this DVD release to be poor, a 3rd generation conversion with washed out color.  I had to turn the color on my TV to maximum for it to appear normal.  So 5 stars for the program, 3 stars for the DVD quality, average of 4 stars.",1378339200,,766,4.352112676056338
