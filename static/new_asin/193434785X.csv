7801886,2,193434785X,"I've enjoyed reading Tom Muzila's work since the 80's in magazines and was excited to get this video series. That being said I am very disappointed with this video. It's a DVD copy of a VHS recording and the production is low which is disappointing.
The material is technique based that are not realistic against attacks that are the same old single stretched out type found in traditional dojo training.
The only reason for 2 stars is because I still admire Muzila's contributions to the arts and his service in the military.",1487462400,,526,4.728260869565218
