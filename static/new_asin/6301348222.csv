However, to see the coronation of the Queen who is likely to become the United Kingdom's longest reigning monarch be crowned and participate is quite something.  The pomp and pageantry is truly amazing.  Although The Queen was so young, as evident from the address that she gave during the evening of Coronation Day, she was ready to fulfill the duty that had come to her.

The British felt ashamed when King Edward VIII abdicated.  No king had ever abdicated the English thrown.  However, but for Edward's abdication, Her Majesty would likely not have ever been Queen. The UK would be a lot different today had King George VI, Queen Elizabeth (consort), and their daughter, Queen Elizabeth II (regnant) not been at the helm of the Royal Family.

When (if) Prince Charles becomes King, I doubt his coronation would be anything like that of his mother.  It would not be completely different, but I just don't think a coronation like the one in this film will ever happen again.",1293840000,2,1039,4.76536312849162
7811245,1,6301348222,I was very disappointed in the quality of this film.  I realise it is old but it didn't look like an original.  It looked like it was copied many many times and the price would have been good for a good original but way way too much for such poor quality film.  Sorry I bought it.,1220140800,2,280,3.9642857142857144

With the whole world watching, it must have been frightening for young Elizabeth, but she seemed quite composed throughout the whole affair. It was interesting to see who was in attendance as England had countries under her control who are now independent nations. Prince Charles was just a child and it was endearing to see him take in the ceremony and then come out onto the balcony where many years later he would kiss his new bride Princess Diana. Since Queen Elizabeth is now the longest ruling monarch in history, is in good health and not likely to step down any time soon, this video is a very interesting record of an event many of us have not experienced for ourselves.",1198454400,8,838,4.630872483221476
