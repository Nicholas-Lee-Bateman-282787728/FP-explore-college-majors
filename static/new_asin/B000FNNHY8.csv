8124828,4,B000FNNHY8,"The story, in part, is about two girls who are in love with each other.  The girls, hear over the radio that marriage is possible between same sex couples, and one of them desires to make wedding plans, while her partner is hesitant about doing so, and is content to let their relationship be that of roommates, until circumstances coming about causes her to change her mind.  The other part of the story is about a son in the family, who is gay, and desires to be with his father, who is also is gay, but as the story continues, circumstances prove otherwise.  The drama of the story is well laid out, and is interesting enough to keep the viewer preoccupied with the end result.",1418947200,,680,4.424
8124829,3,B000FNNHY8,"Movie wasn't as good as I expected but it came in a timely manner. Shipping was good, no complaints! Just the movie, scenes, and all that could've been a little more (hmm..) exciting?",1373068800,,183,4.575757575757576
8124830,5,B000FNNHY8,'Floored By Love' is a really great film. I totally loved the multi cultural presence of the hugely diverse cast. The story line and acting were well done as well. Kudos!,1339200000,,170,4.516129032258065
8124831,2,B000FNNHY8,"If you think marriage is the end-all-be-all, this brief adventure in amateur filmmaking does not provide enough reasons to explain its obsession with it. Being together as a couple for a long time and formally proving one's commitment to the other is the only argument given for wanting a contractual legal bonding. Any other pros, and absolutely no cons, of matrimony are considered. The story of a lesbian relationship, however, is soon hijacked by the coming-out saga of a teenage male and his relationship with his stepfather and visiting Gay biological father. For whatever reason, making a 50 minute movie about two Asian lesbians, their families and mixed cultures (one is Chinese, the other Japanese) was not good enough for the filmmaker.",1319155200,,747,5.131147540983607

8124833,5,B000FNNHY8,"Totally in love with this movie, it was sweet and relaxing and nice, well...did I mention it was sweet ^^?? Well, never mind. The movie actually tells two stories about gay and lesbian at the same time. A story was about 2 Asian lesbians who wanted to marry each others but they seem to have the problem with their parents (which is, well, the typical Asian parents who are seriously having problems with homosexual). Another story was about a teenager boy who has to decide whether or not he's going to stay with his mum and his kind step dad or going with his dad (who's gay). I won't tell anything more, watch it yourself, it worths it.",1209859200,3,639,4.423728813559322
