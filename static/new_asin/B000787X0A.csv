2204858,5,B000787X0A,"This production, which for a long time has not been released on DVD, finally introduced a definiative production of this opera.  Fanciulla del West, often maligned by critics, is a truly magical work when performed in the right idiom.  there is nothing subtle here, this is Spaghetti Western Opera, and has a similar effect, it is moving, simple and Compelling to the the part of all of us that enjoyed reading comics and watching Clint Eastwood.  in addition Puccini obviously lavished real care on the score, which comes at the audience in waves.  Emotion erupts in the orchestra, starting with general sentiment and bursting forth in melodramatic swings.  This is best evidenced in Rance's ""Minne Dalla mia Casa"" which starts with the Brass, playing simple open chords, the very heart of Rance's melancholy, growing to passionate ardor, and then sinking right back again, representing Rances unfufilled passion.

  The singers here are near perfect, (the cast recorded the Opera in 1978 wonderfully)

  Milnes is a menacing rance, he is brooding, and oozes Machismo and roughness.  He looks just as you would imagine Jack Rance.  Although this production takes place after his vocal surgery, which began a long decline in his singing, he sounds perfect here.  The bit of extra strain and darker tone adds to the charachter and is not bothersome enough to ruin the line of the music.

  Domingo, sings the same Ramirez which is recorded 3 times on DVD.  It is a subtle, well acted and vocally declamatory.  The role suits his ringing, baritonal voice well.  Watch him dance with Minnie, he is truly in love.  He steals the shows in the final act, where his aria brings down the house.

  Barbara Daniels, real completes the show.  She can truly handle the heft of Minnie, her voice is the complete ideal. Her top is blooming and glorious.  As if this weren't satisfying enough, she also looks a hot minnie.  Her portrayal is concentrated and, occasionaly, frighteningly intense.

  Special mention should be made for Anthony Laciura who portrays Nick.  Laciura has been the met's premiere Comprimaro for many years, and this shows why.  Not only does his voice have bloom and projection, but he creates a character, (something that almost no charachter-tenors can do)  From his hillarious hygene issues to his honest care of minnie, he adds credibility to the drama.",1127606400,50,2368,4.974424552429667
2204859,5,B000787X0A,"What a wonderful production. Finally available on dvd.  It surpasses both the Covent Garden and the La Scala productions. Barbara Daniels is wonderful as Minni, expressing an innocence and a vulnerability that makes her performance believable. Domingo is great as always.  (What an actor) And Milnes portrayal is dark and menacing and sexy! The best production out there!!!",1126310400,17,373,5.413793103448276
2204860,5,B000787X0A,"The producer and director of this show is Giancarlo del Monaco, the son of the great tenor Mario del Monaco. The production is conservative and stunning Leonard Slatkin conducts the Met orchestra. He is very successful in producing big drama and drive, but he pays much attention to the many fine details in Puccini's expert and advanced orchestration. The Met male chorus is excellent and gives some magical moments, like their humming in the final duet of the first act.

The title role is sung by American soprano Barbara Daniels. She has a huge and beautiful voice, without any sign of shrillness or stridency. She is a terrific Minnie both in singing and acting. Placido Domingo gives a master performance of the bandit Dick Johnson. He recorded the role four times. From the musical point of view, his best recording is the studio DG recording from 1978. But Domingo is a great stage performer and actor. He is especially convincing in the portrayal of the vulnerable side of this figure. Baritone Sherril Milnes sings the villain, sheriff Jack Rance. In the seventies and early eighties he was one of the leading baritones in the world. In the early nineties his voice lost something of its power, but is still impressive in comparison to many of his younger colleagues. Like Domingo he is using his long stage experience and is an especially mean and cynical villain.

Met singers do beautifully the many minor roles. Kim Josephson is an excellent Sonora. Dwayne Croft, one of the leading Met baritones today, sings Larkens, which is a very small role.

There are three DVD versions of this opera. All feature Placido Domingo. The La scala 1991 production that is conducted by Lorin Maazel is very good, but the timbre of Mara Zampieri in the title role will not be to everyone's taste, and Juan Pons as the sheriff is not as cruel and nasty like Sherril Milnes. The 1983 Covent Garden production that is conducted by Nello Santi is wonderful too. But Carol Neblett, another impressive American soprano, sings well, but hers acting is a little wooden in comparison to Barbara Daniels.

So the new DG DVD is currently my first choice for this opera on DVD. I highly recommend it even to those who are not especially Puccini's fans. There is little of the sentimentality that dominates works like La Boheme or Madama Butterfly. Nobody dies in this opera; actually, there is a happy ending... And this opera really must be seen, not just heard: it is an impressive and effective stage experience and music drama",1124841600,65,2516,4.803695150115473
2204891,5,B000787X0A,"In contrast to ""Tosca,"" where pretty much everyone is dead by the end of the final act, no one dies in ""Fanciulla.""  I'm puzzled why it's not more popular.  The music is ravishing;  surely the orchestra is as important as any singer(s) in this opera's impact.  In this case, everyone is great.  Barbara Daniel's acting is superb and her singing is gorgeous.  Domingo is no kid, but who cares?  What a great voice.  Really, the whole cast is wonderful, including the singer who plays Jake Wallace.
I've watched this video dozens of times and never tire of it.  (By the way, my dvd does not have the technical problems that others have experienced.)
I have to say that I find the other dvd productions of ""Fanciulla"" seriously inferior to this one...all sorts of problems like bad acting and uneven singing.",1265846400,2,805,4.692857142857143
2204892,5,B000787X0A,"Five stars for the production alone. This is an excellent production. Great singers, interesting scenery, with all the superlative elements of a Met performance. And the opera itself is a refreshing departure from the sweetly sentimental music usually favored by Puccini.
For once his female lead is not a fragile, vulnerable victim, but a strong woman who knows how to control the tough men desiring her.

One star only for the merchandise. I suffered the same fate as most people:first DVD stopped in middle of second act. Return accepted, and, what do you know, second DVD stops at the same spot. The DVD player alerts: ""DAMAGED SECTION"".

I thought I was a sole victim of chance. But no way. Everybody's in the same boat.
Really astonishing that both Deutsche Grammophon and Amazon as well are happy to sell known damaged goods. Probably unwilling to face the costs of recalling the flawed DVDs and replace them with a new one.

I wonder whether this could be ground for some kind of class action from all of us, naive suckers. We spend huge amounts of money to get these disks, and it is unacceptable that we should receive DVDs that are not good new merchandise, fit to play without any production bugs.
Both sellers must think that we are defenseless and that they can take advantage of us to get rid of their damaged inventory.
This is  utterly disgraceful, and a breach of the trust that consumers have in the honesty of the manufacturer and the retailer.

2204893,5,B000787X0A,"I rate the production and the opera 5 stars!  The DVD is defective as others have reported and hangs up in the middle of Act II, so the  product itself gets a big fat ZERO. I was able to repeatedly hit fast-forward and jump past the freeze, but  DAMN it!  I don't understand why Amazon continues to sell this item and can't manage to put pressure on Universal Music Group (which now owns Deutsche Grammophon and Decca) to make a corrective production run.  Enough people have reported defective DVDs of this and also ""Ernani"" from the same company that you would think large sellers could amass some power on behalf of consumers!!  Come on!  The only reason I'm keeping this DVD is that I know it's almost impossible to get it replaced easily, as the entire production run produced faulty discs--and it appears to be hell to get anything out of Deutsche Grammophon directly.

It irritates the crap out of me because I love, love, love this opera and particularly this production, in which Sherrill Milnes bestrides the earth as an obsessive and rather noble, menacing and cynical but not villainous lawman.  The best of the best, even if he's not at his vocal peak, he brings out the character's vulnerability while not allowing him any charm.  Nobody else has managed this.  Domingo lacks a little stamina by his Act III aria, ""Chel'a mi creda"" (he grunts off some phrase ends) but still has the richness, legato and ring he had in earlier performances of this role--he may have been tired the night of this performance, is all.  But his characterization is flawless.  And so is Barbara Daniels' Minnie.  Her persona is sunny and warm with the edge she needs to cheat at cards, fend off Rance's advances and play schoolmarm to a bunch of miners.  The chorus is splendid (Anthony Laciura reliable as always), individualized, and characterful, and effort has been made to get them moving and milling about in small groups rather than standing around or moving in large blocs.  Small roles, especially the guy singing Jake Wallace, are very well taken.  The costuming and production atmosphere is unmatched--it looks like a bar in a gold rush mining town, people don't look all scrubbed like they just opened the costume box this morning; and the scena at Minnie's little shack leaves room on the giant Met stage for the snowy mountain scene just outside, where we actually get to SEE Milnes track down and shoot Domingo.  Only production complaint:  Act I is rather dimly lit because it's supposed to be twilight, but all the brown and sepia tone to the set and costuming absorbs most of the lighting, so the singers are a bit under-lit.  But the whole thing just looks and sounds so right.

But ARRGHHH this defective disc!  Here's hoping UMG finally generates another production run of La Fanciulla and Ernani.",1251849600,9,2811,4.752577319587629
2204894,4,B000787X0A,"Incredible sets and direction.  Georgous to watch and hear.  Even the live horses were beautiful animals instead of the usually common ones.  I only gave 4 stars because Daniels is vocally wobbly and frequently off key and way too chubby.  She could have been costumed to minimize the latter.  But her acting is excellent.  Milnes despite his notorious pasaggio problems is by far the best Rance.  He gives so much depth and humanity to the character that others portray just as a dandy.  Domingo I find adequate, but not exciting (as I usually find him).  I saw Corelli live as Johnson 45 years ago and no tenor comes remotely close to him.  I've only seen one dvd with compramarios as delightful as these and I have many fanciulla dvds.

I've even had non opera people like this one!!",1246492800,,786,4.6231884057971016
2204895,5,B000787X0A,fancula with daniels is one of the best productions on dvd.  it is at the top of my list for performance.  visually the camera work is exceptional.truely a feather in the met's cap.,1203984000,3,181,4.454545454545454
2204896,5,B000787X0A,"I first bought this disc from Amazon, that copy froze at the one hour twenty minute mark, and on more than one DVD player. I then tried purchasing a copy from one of the independent sellers on Amazon, whose policy was to replace the disc one time rather than give an immediate refund, therefore I received two copies from that seller, both defective at the exact same spot. Finally, I tried Barnes & Noble. The first copy had the same defect. I asked the manager to please check to see if any replacement they might send was defective or not, and to try to get it from another source. They did, and guess what, this new copy screwed up at exactly the same place as the others. Frustrated, I contacted Deutsche Grammophon. They offered to send me a German made copy if I sent my defective disc to them. I complied, and they mailed me a replacement(while still not admitting that the American made copy I sent them had any problems) and the German copy works...FINALLY!!!!!!! I had to go through five defective copies and two countries to get a copy that functions, over several months I might add...and you know what, it was actually worth all the headaches! Which is why I am giving you the details of my ordeal, to emphasize what a mandatory experience it is watching this DVD. At no point during all this did I consider giving up and just taking a refund. I had seen enough of the DVD before it malfunctioned to know that this was something I absolutely wanted to own. My advice, if you don't want to take your chances with Amazon or its various sellers...contact Deutsche Grammophon directly and explain the problem and try to get a German-made copy from them, or wait until the American producers figure out there is a problem and produce another run. Because passing this by for another version of La Fanciulla del West is simply not an option.

You have to see the disc to understand why I am so enthusiastic, but I'll do my best to put it into words. This production is classic Met, with singers ideally suited for their parts, marvelous conducting and breathtaking sets that are realistic and consistent with the drama.

Barbara Daniels, a singer whose career I have not followed(unfortunately, at least if her performance here is any indication), comes across as a great interpreter of Puccini, her Minnie is sweet and tender and girlish, a fully realized character who also happens to be terrifically sung. The voice is lovely, powerful, but it is her acting that really bowled me over. For instance, there is one moment in the second act(strangely enough, right before the disc jams up on the defective copies...maybe those DVDs were overcome to the point of speechlessness) where she puts her male houseguest to bed and blows out a candle and the camera closes in on her face and her expression is just priceless, full of the sweetness and girlishness I mentioned above, coy and flirty but also innocent. This is the kind of moment a person sitting in the theater would miss out on, but the camera memorializes it so that the TV viewer can bask in its charm. That, my friends, is acting above and beyond the call of duty, and this moment alone is worth the price of admission. Placido Domingo is the star tenor, singing what is reportedly one of his favorite roles, that of the unfortunately named Dick Johnson(and all you Beavis and Butthead types out there will kindly stop snickering, thank you). Domingo is no spring chicken at this point, there's a certain jowliness to his features starting to override his movie star looks, but his vocal prowess shows no indications of flagging, and the energy and passion he commands onstage are both at a zenith. His high notes are still piercing...does this guy ever have an off night? The always reliable Sherill Milnes is a great choice for the role of Jack Rance, his sinister expressions and deep, seductive baritone voice make him the ideal villain(although Rance is certainly no straight villain role in the mold of Baron Scarpia, even though the characters share certain similarities). Milnes is such a trooper that you almost wish a producer would alter the storyline just once so he could finally get the girl. Leonard Slatkin and his orchestra's interpretation of Puccini's music is breathy and evocative, masterfully capturing every ripple, every lilt, every curve of this supple score, one of the composer's best(I love this music!). Technically, this is a by-the-book presentation in that the conductor doesn't color the music with any personal indulgences(not always a bad thing), still the reading couldn't be any more ardent because, really, how can you improve on what Puccini himself wrote down? The sets are spectacular, combined with the acting they give the impression of watching a Hollywood western. Act two's multifaceted set is especially notable, featuring a two-leveled interior(Minnie's cabin) as well as the great outdoors, complete with a pine tree laden forest and a genuine snowstorm! Brian Large's video direction is top of the line as always...the closeup of Minnie I mentioned above and a long shot of the happy couple embracing in the snow are highlights.

I've never understood the slams directed at this opera. Critics snipe at how unrealistic it seems having American prospectors singing in the language of Puccini. Is that any more unrealistic than ancient Egyptians(Aida) or Japanese peasants(Madama Butterfly) singing in Italian, or Celtic warriors and maidens singing in German(Tristan und Isolde)? This is opera, folks! I remember reading that Puccini considered this his favorite score, and the more I experience it the more I think he might have been right. It's more through-composed but no less melodic than many of his other scores. Dramatically, the story is a little corny and unbelievable, but it is also  quite moving. The relationship between Minnie and the miners is endearing, and it leads to a conclusion that is satisfyingly bittersweet, a change of pace for the composer and a mood that is probably more difficult to pull off than a straight sad or happy ending. Besides, the story isn't so far removed from other Puccini operas...it has a strong romantic interest, a villain who tries to strike a deal for the hand of the woman he wants, using the life of her lover as collateral, eventually being outsmarted by the woman(a la Tosca), plus the card scene(three hands) foreshadows the three riddles in Turandot.

I love La Fanciulla del West, and will continue to love it no matter how many critics try to devalue its rapturous beauty. Addio!",1197763200,33,6557,4.856121537086684
2204897,1,B000787X0A,I received a copy of this opera and then a replacement. Both of them were defective at the same points in Act 2. The picture froze and eventually went to the main menu. I was not allowed to order another copy of it.,1195257600,5,215,4.023255813953488
2204898,5,B000787X0A,"I only ordered this because of the great cast as I was initially doubtful about the concept of a ""western opera"". I was so totally delighted by it however, that I watched it through twice in one evening. Everyone was so perfect in their roles that it would be hard to imagine Puccini being less than overjoyed in the quality of the cast. The story-line was interesting, the sets were terrific and the singing, of course, superb.",1191715200,5,428,4.571428571428571
2204899,5,B000787X0A,"I was so glad that the story had a happy ending, just like a proper myth ought to do. I would have to watch the opera again to give a critical account. First pass, I just fell into the story, I liked Millie as well as any of her admirers, and Dick (Placado) strutted and was the handsome and flawed hero who redeems himself through love. Daniels, Domingo and Milnes voices had the contrast and drama called for. Milnes does a great bad guy presentation. What a privilege to be able to have these great performances to enjoy at our pleasure in our homes. A blessing!",1151280000,5,565,4.339622641509434
2204900,5,B000787X0A,"As a collector of opera dvds--i have more than 60--i've become rather dulled with regards to most opera productions.  In short, it takes a lot to move me.  That said, this production is truly one of the most moving, vital and impressive productions of a Puccini opera I have ever seen.  Puccini operas are not easy to stage, especially this one, which requires first rate musicians, singers, supporting cast, etc. as well as a perceptive director who can capture all the subtleties and surmount the logistical problems posed by this opera.  And boy it does! Especially captivating is the second act, which has an almost cinematic sense to it, as well as gripping drama and action.

As for the singers, they are some of the best i've heard to sing fanciulla! The MET orchestra and chorus are stellar of course, as are the supporting roles.  Barbara Daniels has a big, round voice, which is both beautiful and powerful.  Her acting is believable and she certainly looks the part.  Domingo proves that even in 1992 he could sing the demanding role of Dick Johnson with both credibility and intensity.  Milnes projects both the jealousy and honor of this untraditional ""villain"" especially well.  He is not evil, nor is he virtuous.

Now a word on the opera itself.  It is Puccini's most daring work, which endears itself through its unconventional melodies and a miraculous sort of genuineness.  This production projects the ""western"" spirit of this opera, which I believe is the crux of the work.  The melodies characterize this spirit, as do the magnificent sets and singers.  I warn though....this is not quite the same Puccini most are accustomed to, so if you are looking for another Boheme, this is not it.  It is, however, equally moving, if not more so.  There is no cheesy, drawn out death scene--in fact, no one dies.  What there is, however, is heart-wrenching nostalgia and intensly human jealousy, sympathy, and tragedy.",1148083200,20,1930,4.886153846153846

 Somehow, I missed this performance, when it was live, at the Met. This recorded performance now brings all of Puccinis operas into the fold, for me.

 Domingo, as Johnson/Ramiriz, is outstanding. Daniels, as Minnie, finally makes the female arias sound as they should. Milnes, as Rance, the Sheriff, is perfect, in voice and manner.
