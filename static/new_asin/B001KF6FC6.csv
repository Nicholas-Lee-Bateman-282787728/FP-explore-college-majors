8314910,3,B001KF6FC6,I like Dom and love his comedy. This DVD is not well produced.  Some recordings are not very audible. Its like someone in the audience recorded the show. I wish the DVD contained professionally produced appearences.,1367107200,,215,4.972222222222222
8314911,3,B001KF6FC6,"I love Dom...always have since i first saw him years ago.  i thought this would be a complete stand-up show, but it is not.  It jumps around with him doing one liners but there is no buildup so you might laugh...,or not.  Doesn't do him justice.",1354320000,,245,4.282608695652174
