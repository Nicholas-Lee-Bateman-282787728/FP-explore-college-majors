642937,3,6303439748,"... but three seems to be the theme of this DVD. It's amazing how rare it is to find anyone aligned with a studio who actually knows their product like a fan would.
Obviously the only connection of this ""theme"" basesd DVD is that the word Three is in each title. I know that one Amazon fan especially was looking for Three Little Beers, so here's hoping he finds this to his liking. But of these particular shorts I think only Three Arabian Nuts and Three Little Beers are really worth your time. The others have their moments but are not in the same league.  By the way - the cover photo is from Three Little Twirps - a short not listed among those included on this volume!
I am grateful though that the Stooges shorts continue to come out regularly. As time goes by there are more and more people who tend to forget or ignore older films. Of course one can't see everything and each generation has its own stars. Still it would be a shame if so much good work the Stooges did was lost.
Hey, Columbia - when are you going to dig out Time Out For Rhthym, which is pronanly the best of the Stooges feature length work?",1015632000,,1117,4.244131455399061

People should have boycotted the manufacturer/distributor in the beginning. But it's too late for that now.

I made my own set thanks to various TV stations that have played these over the years. My only cost was for
the videotapes and DVDs.

I'm still anticipating more color releases which I think are awesome. If purists balk at this they don't have to buy them.

643118,3,6303439748,"I think the most interesting aspect of the Derita era stooge films is how Moe & Larry seemed to have accepted the fact that they were ""old"" men & were now portraying it in their films. Even in the waning years of the shorts subject department at Columbia and with Joe Besser as the 3rd stooge, Moe and Larry were still running wild & ogling women half their age.

But here in the Derita years, Moe and Larry, and Curly-Joe seem content with playing the grandfather type as their care for some strapping young lad in most of the 60s features. And there could also be the drawback of some of these feature length films; the romantic subplot angle.

But when you are making 90 minute features, I guess you need to pad out the story with something, whereas in the old days of the Columbia short subjects, you didn't have time for all that extra curricular nonsense & could just concentrate on the slapstick.

As for ""Hercules,"" it starts strong, but falters somewhat down the stretch as the laughs seems to dry up after the stooges are shipwrecked. Not the best Derita feature, but definitely a sight better than ""Have Rocket, Will Travel"". 3 stars",1382572800,,1144,4.543689320388349

However, Moe looks old, very old.  Those are not bags under his eyes.  It's luggage.  Sadly, there is not enough of that famous Three Stooges violence.  Yes, there is a pie throwing scene.  And the sound effects are the same.  But there is no eye poking and way too little face slapping and head hammering.  Also missing are Curly's Curlyisms and there is not enough good material with Larry.  This film could have been cast with Abbott and Costello without changing a thing.  By the early sixties, it was too late to expect the Three Stooges to be fresh, original, and daring.  They were a brand.  And like any brand, they knew what you had a right to expect from them and what they had a right to expect from you.  So there is just enough of them in this film to satisfy their audience, but not enough to please them.  Still, I highly recommend it.  You'll enjoy it.",1344384000,,1020,4.48087431693989

643169,3,6303439748,"Now, this 1962 Three Stooges feature film actually isn't half bad. I thought it was hilarious when the three knuckleheads are mistaken for gods. 'Three Stooges Meet Hercules' simply isn't as 'lame' as a couple of their other feature-length films. Call me narrow-minded but I still much prefer their twenty-minute shorts. I mean - even Shemp had his moments. It didn't hit me until later, but maybe the reason this flick isn't great is because Moe, Larry and Curly-Joe (Joe De Rita) was already over the age of sixty + this movie was most likely aimed toward a weekend matinee audience.",1306713600,,585,4.801980198019802

643172,3,6303439748,"Sadly, by the time this film was made (1961, according to the copyright date on the film itself, not 1962), the Three Stooges shtick was a little beyond its prime. Partly that was because of the age of the Stooges (Moe was 64, and Larry and Curly-Joe weren't far behind), but partly it was because of the age itself -- their trademark physical comedy had to be heavily toned down because it was no longer acceptable to over-protective children's advocates. And partly, of course, it was because the act no longer had either of its classic line-ups: views vary on the worth of Curly-Joe DeRita, but it may be agreed he was neither Curly Howard nor Shemp Howard.

That said, this film has more resonance of the classic Stooges shorts than most of their later films, even if without the belly laughs. It is also interesting that the producers cared enough about it to invest in wide-screen format, but not enough to invest in making it in colour. There was a lot of that going on in Hollywood in the late 50s and early 60s. Interestingly, there is a promo on the disc for a series of colourised Stooges DVDs, but this one has not itself been given the treatment.

It is disappointing that, aside from that promo, there are absolutely no extras on this disc.

Nevertheless, this is fair value, but probably for hard-core Stooges fans only. Anyone wanting to be introduced to the Stooges for the first time would be better served with one of the many anthologies of their short subjects available than one of these films from the later period. But if you do want to dip into the movies, this is probably the best of them.",1255996800,2,1616,4.546391752577319

643209,5,6303439748,"This is arguably the best Three Stooges feature of the bunch. It was fun to watch, and kept me engaged all the way through it. Even Moe Howard himself said that in 1962, this was a box-office smash upon its release, with lines often stretching all the way around the theatre block!
The secret behind TSMH and the other Stooge films is clever scripting and direction. We're never painfully reminded we're watching comedians well into their sixties; Moe, Larry and Curly Joe (the final member to join the ranks)are able to function & clown superbly without performing major physical stunts. BTW, Curly Joe's character in these films seems to have a closer comic styling to Lou Costello than the original Curly. And he seems to be smarter (though not by much!).
Another factor is the satirical jokes & modern-day references that make TSMH seem fresh & funny. Mel Brooks must've mined the humor for his ""History of the World"" comedy, which coincidentally, includes a Roman sketch.
And there's even throwbacks to the early Stooge days: the familiar sound effects and pie-throwing (done during the chariot race climax).
If you've never seen the Stooges during their 60's career revival, this is a good film to start with!",1199836800,2,1215,4.902912621359223

I know the man who puts these dvds out isn't Stooge fan, maybe just a causal fan. I use to write the man who wrote an encloypedia on them. We had some great chats about Stooges. Its time for Columbia to wake up and release ""ALL"" Stooge shorts onto one massive set. I mean if we can get Newlyweds or Simple Life on dvd so fast, why not the Stooges? Granted Stooge shorts range from classic to forgetable. They could divide them into three parts-Curly, Shemp, and Joe. Six shorts on one dvd is bare minuim, they could easily put 10-15 on each disc.

643266,4,6303439748,"Not that it's saying much, considering the type of material they were given to work with in the DeRita era, but this is probably the best starring feature they did.  Most of the DeRita features have very weak scripts and really embarrassing cringe-worthy childish storylines, something that generally only children and nostalgic aging Boomers actually like, but there are a handful of them that have pretty good scripts and supporting casts, such as this one.  It was also directed by the wonderful Ed Bernds, which might account for the surprisingly positive change in direction, going from bad kiddy fare to a movie that, while not nearly at the same level as classics like 'Hoi Polloi' or 'Brideless Groom,' can still be watched multiple times and be enjoyed by non-Boomers and people over the age of ten.  Under Bernds's direction, they look and act decades younger!  Sure there are some moments (like the scene with the hokey-looking Cyclops) that do seem geared to the kiddy matinee audience, but overall it's something that flows along seamlessly, a great plot that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.  It doesn't even have the same dated quality as 'The Outlaws Is Coming!,' their other best DeRita feature, making it even stronger.  Even DeRita isn't as teeth-gratingly annoying as he usually is; he's tolerable so long as he stays in the background and is taken in small doses.  This picture also has their longtime supporting player Emil Sitka, which is always a good thing; another supporting player I really enjoyed was Samson Burke as Hercules.  He was so hilariously hammy!  And though there isn't that much slapstick in here (due to all of the parents who thought their kids would imitate their violent antics), it does feature in more than usual, complete with sound effects.  Probably the only thing I can find to really find fault with here is how Moe does a number of Curlyisms.  It's as embarrassing and cringe-worthy as it always is when he tries to imitate his (by that time deceased) baby brother's trademark noises and mannerisms.

The only extra besides basics like scene selection is a self-congratulatory preview for the colorised DVDs that Columbia had released around this time.  Why wasn't an actual trailer for this movie included in lieu of that?  Although this shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, given how no-frills their other Stooge DVDs are, barely any hint that they're DVDs and not video cassettes.  Overall, it's one of the few DeRita features I would recommend instead of urging people to steer well clear of.",1160352000,18,2557,4.913953488372093
643267,4,6303439748,"Four of the five shorts included here are of very high quality, even though it is ridiculous how Columbia has begun issuing these discs with only 5 shorts apiece, when they used to put six on (and once even seven).  I also agree that it was pretty stupid to not have included all of the shorts matching the theme which haven't been issued on DVD yet (which would include 'Three Hams on Rye,' 'Three Sappy People,' 'Three Little Twirps,' 'Three Little Sew and Sews,' and 'Three Pests in a Mess').  This is seriously shortchanging the consumer, asking him or her to pay more for less.  However, the most important thing to be rating is the quality of the DVD, not how it could have been better but wasn't.

The shorts included are:

'Three Arabian Nuts' (1951).  This is a really good film, with a really good plot and great performances by everyone.  The ending is also hysterical, since we don't often see a supporting player (in this case Vernon Dent) being the one to get the closing gag.  This short is just proof that the Stooges were still capable of making great funny shorts even as Columbia's budget was growing smaller year by year and were great even in spite of the dwindling budget.  Shemp in particular is hysterical in this short; I'm so embarrassed that once upon a time I was one of those people who dismiss him out of hand and don't want to watch any of his shorts just because he wasn't Curly.

'Three Dark Horses' (1952) is a great send-up of the political system, and what's so brilliant about it is that it's a spoof on politics in general, not any particular party.  It's just as relevant today as it was over 50 years ago.  Once again, this short shows that they could still be hysterical and do a great job with the material even though the budget of their golden era in the late Thirties and early Forties was no longer there.  Also of note is that fact that this short is Bud Jamison's only appearance, so to speak, in a Shemp short, and a posthumous appearance at that.  Though he passed away in 1944, his picture appears on the campaign posters for Hammond Egger, a really nice tribute to him and all of the work he did with them over the years.

'Three Smart Saps' (1942) is my favorite short on here.  It's perfect from start to finish, with no dull or wasted scenes or moments.  There are so many great scenes and gags, particularly the scene on the dance floor.  Curly was such a nice dancer, which one might not expect coming from such a big person.  (The reason he was such a skilled and graceful dancer was because he took up dance as physical therapy following the accident when he shot himself in the foot and ended up with a lifelong painful limp.)  Of course, fans of classic comedy will know that the gag of the loosely basted suit was borrowed from the 1925 Harold Lloyd classic 'The Freshman.'

'Three Little Beers' (1935) is generally regarded as one of their earliest classics.  Though they had pretty much perfected their screen personae, comedy style, and screen relationship by this point, it does kind of have the feel, at times, of being one of those very early shorts with a more freewheeling and chaotic spirit, as opposed to a set tight plot and a sense of resolution at the end.  I find most sports boring, so it's a pleasure to see the boys ruining the game of golf and driving all of the players batty (much like they ruin the football games in 'Three Little Pigskins' and 'No Census, No Feeling').  However, it really was inexcusable how Columbia used a bad print for this.  Their claim that there was a jump-cut that was unable to be repaired (hence the about 20 seconds of missing footage) is pathetic, given how everyone knows that there's a better print out there, a print that has been issued on VHS and shown on television many times over.  Are they picking the worst prints on purpose, the way that Hallmark has been mishandling the Laurel and Hardy catalogue they were the unrightful owners of until recently?  All 190 of the Stooge shorts have been on safety stock since 1974, so to make such a claim is just laughable.  We're not talking about some 90 year old film that really was in such a state of deterioration, with only one known surviving print, that not much could be done to digitally restore it in its entirety!

'Three Loan Wolves' (1946) is pretty dismal.  I don't think it's necessarily as awful as a lot of other fans do, but it's still nowhere near the likes of 'Hoi Polloi' or 'You Nazty Spy!'  However, it is one of the worst shorts of the sick Curly era.  The poor man looks, sounds, and acts like a zombie in it, barely has any lines, and after locking one of the bad guys in the desk during the fight scene, he just disappears instead of coming to help Moe and Larry while they're fighting the other two bad guys.  At times it also sounds like his cries of pain are real instead of just acting.  It's also really a slow-paced short overall, only picking up somewhat during the fight scene.  The ending also makes no sense; why is Larry the one being punished instead of that annoying ungrateful little brat they've been raising since his aunt left him at their pawn shop when he was a baby?  That little boy deserved it more!

Overall, this is a strong collection, if one can get past the fact that only 5 shorts are included (once again without a ""Play All"" feature) and that one of them is missing about 20 seconds of footage (which contain one of the funniest scenes).  However, it makes no sense that the cover picture is from 'Three Little Twirps' (1943), which isn't even one of the shorts included.  One also wishes that the dismal 'Three Loan Wolves' could have been excluded and replaced with something far superior, like 'Three Sappy People' (1939) or 'Three Little Sew and Sews' (1939).",1155600000,3,5783,4.487106017191977
643268,4,6303439748,"As others have mentioned, the picture quality on this disc isn't always the greatest.  We know that there are better prints available; it isn't like these are the best surviving prints and there could only be so much digital restoration done on them.  They're far from unwatchable, but it is annoying to see these grainy prints when better ones are out there.  And once again, not all of the chosen shorts have much, or even anything, to do with the theme of 'Cops and Robbers.'  The shorts included are:

'Disorder in the Court' (1936), which is one of their all-time best and a bona-fide classic.  This is also widely considered to be Bud Jamison's best work with the boys.  It seems like this short is in many fans' Top 10 of their personal favorites.  However, since it is one of the 4 shorts that accidentally fell into the public domain (probably due to a clerical oversight), there are numerous releases of it already.  It would seem wrong for it not to have been released on DVD, since it's such a classic, but it could have been included on another disc so that a lesser-seen short relevant to the topic could have been put here in its place.

'Flat Foot Stooges' (1938) is above average, though not really a classic or one of their most memorable shorts.  I personally like 'False Alarms' better when it comes to their firefighter-themed shorts.  However, it is very solid and enjoyable.  This short was directed by the great Charley Chase, and though most of the shorts he did with the boys are more plot-centered as opposed to focusing on the slapstick and violence, this one has more of both in it than usually.  I also enjoyed seeing veteran character actor Chester Conklin as Chief Kelly.

'Calling All Curs' (1939) is also above average, though not one I would consider one of their very greatest or most classic.  It also doesn't really relate to the theme of the disc, apart from the title and the fact that there are a couple of dognappers featured.  It would actually have been better-suited for inclusion on the 'Dizzy Doctors' disc, since the boys are playing veterinarians here.  Again, a solid funny short, just not anything extremely memorable or classic.

'Dizzy Detectives' (1943) is another very good short, even though I personally wouldn't consider it a classic or one of their most memorable.  It's also stupid how the opening scene is stock footage from 'Pardon My Scotch' (1935); someone who sits down to watch this short might even initially think it were mislabelled and that it's really 'Pardon My Scotch,' since both have the exact same opening scene.  (Although that scene, it should be mentioned, caused a real-life injury when Moe fell off of the table that was sawed in half.  It really demonstrates what a professional he was that he was able to stand up, deliver his next lines, and slap the other two even though he'd just broken a few of his ribs and collapsed immediately afterwards.  Most actors today, comedians or serious actors, would probably never even finish the scene after suffering such a serious injury.)  This short is a little slow in spots, and usually it comes off as lame and unbelievable (to a modern audience at least) to see a person in a gorilla suit being passed off as an actual gorilla.  There's also a surprising moment in the scene where Curly is coming to Larry's rescue, when we hear an unmistakable sound that obviously wasn't done on purpose.  You'll know what kind of a sound it is if you've watched it.

'Crime on Their Hands' (1948) is a great short.  As of this date I've only seen about half of the Shemp shorts, but so far this one is my favorite.  It's a great spoof of film noir, and it boasts one of Kenneth MacDonald's best roles with the boys.  They did a lot of shorts of this nature during the Shemp era (acting as detectives), but this is one of their best ones.  Eeverything is so great about this, flowing so perfectly from beginning to end, with a great plot, great slapstick, that great ad-lib from Shemp when he pretends to be a reporter talking back to the boss like they do in the movies, and a really cute funny ending.

'Who Done It?' (1949) is considered by many to be one of the best Shemp shorts, though I think it may be perhaps somewhat overrated (perhaps because they did so many detective-themed shorts during this era, and that premise kind of gets boring, or at least predictable, after awhile).  However, he is just great in it, in every single scene, from photographing the fingerprints on the table (while continually wandering over to Christine McIntyre), to his over-the-top reaction after she tries to poison him, to the fight where the lights keep going on and off (his call, ""Here I am, Moe!"" is just hysterical!).  And as usual, there's a great performance by Emil Sitka.  The only really bad moment was when Moe was acting like Curly when the paintings were attacking him.  It's kind of embarrassing to watch him doing these mannerisms that really can only ever belong to one comedian ever, because he made them his own and no one else's.  It just doesn't work on anyone else.

Perhaps not the greatest disc in this series, though even in spite of having a few shorts that are only above-average instead of really GREAT, they are all very solid and funny, and it's not as though there are any below-average or outright horrible shorts included here.",1154563200,4,5366,4.6451271186440675

643271,5,6303439748,"This film was made at the height of the Stooges popularity in the late 50s and early 60s. It grossed about two million dollars at the box office, exceeding expectations, and landed the Stooges a three-picture deal. Those three would turn out to be Three Stooges in Orbit, Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze, and Outlaws is Coming. Two million gross at the box office is pathetic these days, but it was substantial 43 years ago.

People already know the premise of this film. It's repeated several times on this page. But this is the type of film anyone with an appreciation of comedy would like. Be it a five year old or a 75 year old. It's just a fun, quick-paced, and clean film. I'm a Stooges fan, and this is one of my favorite things they ever did, including their short films.

This flick is the best place for anyone to start in the DeRita era, which tends to be frowned upon by many Stooge fans, but I liked DeRita. He was a good actor.

5 stars for the movie, but until proven otherwise, the actual DVD will get a 1 or a 2. These pictures were filmed in the 1:66 to 1 aspect ratio, but Columbia has typically released with in 1:85 to 1.

And it was an excellent film, especially after the abominable ""Snow White and the Three Stooges"". The only drawback, like the other Stooges features, is that there are no special features.

I sincerely hope that Columbia eventually puts all of the Stooge shorts on disk, but what will they do when they run out of ""categories"" to group them under?

Cops and Robbers?  Well, one could argue that there are robbers - or at the very least bad guys - on this collection, but there are precious few cops.  The title Calling All Curs parodies a police call popular in 30s and 40s films.  But it's called Curs because they are involved with dogs.  Not exactly police.
Likewise with Flat Foot Stooges.  A flat foot is a policeman or at best a private detective.  But in this instance the Stooges are firemen.  The Shemp entries in this volume are the best films in the collection and actually have something to do with the title.  So does Dizzy Detectives and that's a nice still from this film for the cover.

Three of the five shorts on this entry are among the teams' best, ""Three Little Beers"" (1935), ""Three Arabian Nuts"" (1951) and the underrated ""Three Smart Saps"" (1942).  However, I'm only awarding 2 stars due to:
 - Only 5 shorts on this disc?  Past volumes have included 6 (one with 7), and considering the information capacity of DVD, even more Stooge classics could easily fit.  I'm hoping this was a one-time-only shortchanging, and future volumes will provide more for the money.
 - Where's the quality control!!!  The print of ""Three Little Beers"" has 20 missing seconds due to a sloppy splice!  One of the funniest scenes in the short (Curly dropping a plethora of golf balls from his pockets) is GONE!
I want to continue supporting Columbia's Stooge DVDs, but you will have to do better than this one guys.",1016496000,10,926,4.8164556962025316
