525326,4,630296959X,"Powell and Pressburger seldom disappoint, and this interesting tale weaving together a strange little mystery, a stranger in a strange land, the English homefront during World War II, and the blessings sought at Canterbury is one of the best stories they tell.

The cinematography is superb, the acting only okay--the guy who plays the American G.I. was an American G.I and not a professional actor, and it shows, although he is likable--but the story is one that causes the viewer to reflect again and again on its themes.

The film has been criticized for the scenes with the local kids, but they are charming and add an amusing element to the story.

My only wish is that it had been filmed in color. Put this story with the Technicolor of Black Narcissus and it would have been perfect.",1163030400,4,790,4.7101449275362315
525327,5,630296959X,"It doesn't have the instant charm of I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING, and Sheils Sim, the ingenue whose first film role this was, doesn't have the swanky, leading lady adorableness that Wendy Hiller radiates in IKWIG, and yet when all is said and done it may be A CANTERBURY TALE that you'll remember longer.

If you are new to Michael Powell's work you might want to watch THE RED SHOES or PEEPING TOM right away, maybe BLACK NARCISSUS.  His other movies take a little getting used to, as most of them are genuinely odd.  And perhaps nothing is as odd as the storyline of A CANTERBURY TALE, in which eleven young women have been molested at night by a fleeting stranger in Home Guard uniform pouring glue in their hair during the blackout.  Okay, that's weird, but what's even stranger is that right away we find out who the culprit is, and the suspense is going to be, will the three pilgrims let him off the hook or not?

On the commentary track, Sheila Sim, now 80 something and still very sharp and lovely, recalls an earlier version of the script in which the ""Glueman"" didn't use glue at all, but rather ran around ripping girls' skirts with a pair of scissors, and in her recollection this aspect was changed because of its sexual connotations.  Interesting that Powell thought of the glue-on-hair scheme since he was the film world's greatest hair fetishist, just as Cecil B. DeMille had a thing for feet.  Sim relates that it wasn't until she read Powell's memoirs A LIFE IN MOVIES did she realize he was bitterly disappointed that Deborah Kerr had ankled the part, and that she (Sim) was not even a close second.  But I think by the end of the film her performance is so beautiful it makes you happy Kerr stayed home and did something else instead.  All of them are good, but of course the jewel in the crown is the performance of John Sweet as the American sergeant Bob Johnson, with his little slits for eyes and his mountain of fried hair and his incomparable aura of sincerity, as though America was both the youngest and the oldest nation in the world.  There's nobody like him in the movies, not even Henry Fonda in YOUNG MR LINCOLN or James Stewart in DESTRY RIDES AGAIN or Burl Ives in FROSTY THE SNOWMAN is anywhere near as folksy as the amazing Mr. Sweet.

Eric Portman could be a killer, he's so cold and grim.  When he and Sheila Sim share a ""secret understanding,"" the movie seems to be all about carnal love and the way it flip flops into the spiritual.  Their scene, hiding in the heather on top of a hill, is the centerpiece of a modern morality tale.  The film opens windows in the soul.  It has a little knock in it, like a motor car.  A CANTERBURY TALE has been beautifully restored; you can see every drop of glue in Sheils Sim's side-parted hair.  Haven't seen them all, but I'd say this might be the best DVD of summer 2006.",1155600000,22,2848,4.425287356321839
525328,5,630296959X,"One of the most intellectually complex of all the films of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, ""The Archers,"" A CANTERBURY TALE was intended to boost morale during the war concerning British and American relations during the preparations for the D-Day invasion of the continent. Three modern pilgrims on their way to Canterbury and its environs--a self-assured ""Land Girl,"" a cynical cinema organist now serving in the army, and a clever and folksy American GI--attempt to solve a bizarre local mystery in the Kentish town of Chillingbourne: the identity of the enigmatic ""Glue Man"" who keeps pouring glue into the hair of local women after dusk.  The film is much more than a mystery, and as the DVD commentary by Ian Christie and the accompanying textual materials in this lovely Criterion release make clear, it is so much more indeed it becomes almost unclassifiable. It is a comedy, particularly in the charming bits with the local children. Like all of Michael Powell's films, it is also a romance involving sexual hysteria. Above all it is a pastoral meditation on the status of England and its heritage at a truly crucial time in its history, and it asserts both the discontinuities with the agrarian past and the need to reconnect with it during a troubled time of modernity. The ""aw shucks"" demeanour of the Oregon GI (John Sweet) can take some getting used to, but Sheila Sim is really extraordinary as the Land Girl, and Dennis Portman is also quite fine as the local squire who becomes central to the trio's investigations. The tremendous closing sequence of the film involving the organ of the Canterbury Cathedral is one of the most striking evocations of the sublime in the history of film.",1154995200,29,1709,4.913494809688581
525329,4,630296959X,"Let's get real: just WHAT so disturbed 1944-era critics about the ""lurid"" and ""eccentric"" nature of this flick? The obsession of the Glueman, natch.

They were, basically, correct in their misgivings: Michael Powell, even more than Hitchcock, was THE master of weaving his sexual frustrations and obsessions into his flix narratives. Perhaps even more than Bunuel, who had a better sense of humor.

Colpeper wants enthusiastic fellatio instead of the very occasional frosty sexual coupling with his frosty, barely-seen wife. If they've consummated their marriage at all: they seem to be childless. His frustration shoots forth in the form of the glue attacks, oozing over the hair and, most likely, the faces of the bitches, who really should be dunked in the chair hanging in his office. His blatherings about tradition and saving the virtue of the local girls are a Hitchcockian Macguffin: again, let's get real.

Poor Colpeper speaks eloquently about blessings but never gets his: fellatio from either the handsome, homosexual Dennis Price nor the buck-toothed, full-lipped, Sheila Sim: the mere woman with a sense of history!

It's fitting that he simply disappears when the miracles start happening.",1154822400,4,1204,5.321052631578947
525330,4,630296959X,"This magical film from the Archers is long overdue for consideration by U.S. film fanciers, most of whom have never heard of it. The ""Canterbury"" video footprint in the States barely exists -- an old VHS release on Home Vision, but apparently no Region 1 DVD.

Criterion's presentation of ""Canterbury"" looks divine, in silky black and white. Damage such as scratch lines and flashing do little to dull the effect of Erwin Hillier's landscape cinematography -- or of his powerful noirish lighting. Allan Gray's music, a treat, sounds pretty good in the mono audio.

So poorly received was ""Canterbury"" back in 1944 that director Michael Powell quickly came to doubt one of his finest works, cutting out a half hour and adding dumb bookend scenes so American moviegoers could relate to it (they didn't). Powell said it took years for him to appreciate ""Canterbury"" as one of his best.

""Canterbury"" finally was restored to its original running time of 124 minutes in the late '70s; that's the version Criterion offers here. Today, the movie is a regular on the British film fest circuit with its many Archers tributes but is largely unseen in the States.

""Canterbury"" remains ""a truly strange film,"" says film historian Ian Christie, who provides outstanding commentary on the double-DVD set. The WWII movie ""sets about its propaganda in an almost perverse and certainly playful way."" Christie's commentary is the best extra on these discs -- he brings something to every scene and clears up some of the movie's many ambiguitites.

Amateur actor Sgt. John Sweet gives the film much of its sense of wonder, playing the simple but wise American stationed in England. Six decades later, the amateur actor returned to Canterbury for its Powell film fest. His visit is captured in a 2001 short film that's included as a DVD extra. He marvels at the town's transformation from a ""quiet kind of bleak place"" to a humming tourist attraction. ""It was fun to be a 15-minute celebrity,"" the old man says of his brush with movie fame.

Another short film looks in on ""A Canterbury Tale"" day in Kent, a summer tradition since 1997. Powell-Pressburger fans wander about sites used in the film, reading from the script and catching rays. The bookends Powell added for U.S. release are included as well. They feature Kim Hunter as the G.I.'s young wife.

The DVD extras conclude with a piece of video art built around a loop of star Sheila Sims as she beholds the fields of Kent, sensing its ancestral ghosts. This bit is best experienced in as a museum installation, or not at all.",1154649600,5,2565,4.842465753424658
525331,5,630296959X,"There are not enough superlatives to describe what a great film this is.  Having only seen Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's ""The Red Shoes"" recently I purchased this on a whim.  Never having previously heard of this film I was immensely rewarded viewing it.  The film was ostensibly a morale booster for war torn Britain but it works on so many levels.  The complexity of it's themes make it timeless.  This film celebrates the landscape of Britain, the vast array of people who toil in it to make it great, their perserverence, and not least of all, their spirit.  The film follows three ""pilgrims"" to Canterbury who have suffered recent personal setbacks who make the journey for some kind of enlightenment:  A land girl(Sheila Sim) whose RAF fiancee is missing in action, an American G.I.(John Sweet) who is lovesick from not hearing from his sweetheart, and a British organist(Dennis Price) who toils in a London cinema even though he is academy trained.  Their journey brings them something of an epiphany in ways that are unimaginable.  The cast is uniformly superb but I think special mention should be made for John Sweet, a real life American serviceman enlisted by Powell for this film.  Sweet may have been an amateur but it's the very realness of his performance that draws you to his character.  It makes you wonder that if this film were more of a success that Sweet could have had a career on the big screen than in the classrooms as a teacher in Ohio.  As if that were not enough the package contains supplementary material that enhances your enjoyment of this film.  Aside from enlightening interviews with Sweet and Sim, the film also contains footage filmed for an American audience with Kim Hunter that did not appear in the British cut.  This footage detracts from the director's cut and goes to show how the studio honchoes underestimate the audience's intelligence.  Also of interest is a documentary about a Michael Powell film society's pilgrimage through locations featured in the film on the centennial of the director's birth and a vintage documentary highlighting the sights and sounds of Britain at the height of World War II.",1154044800,11,2163,4.887671232876713

Mysterious uniformed figure goes around dumping glue on young women in wartime Britain (Kent, to be exact), and three young people (one a sympathetic American soldier) take time from serving the war effort to solve the question of who the ""Glue Man"" is. Pretty obvious who it is early on. Its a kind of maguffin in the plot. But the evocation of the period and the place is everything.

525487,5,630296959X,"In 'A Canterbury Tale,' Powell mixes mystery, history, and patriotism to drum up Love For Country in a way that would be labeled eco-terrorism now (at least by the Bush administration). It seems to be Powell's most personal film, with the character Colpeper's conflicting environmental zeal & genteel sexism holding up a mirror to director Powell himself; an avid  outdoor enthusiast known for his troubles with women. The antics of the four main characters are done under the beneficent watch of Canterbury Cathedral & its stunning Kent countryside. Such exalted surroundings sanctify Colpeper's aims to educate people to not take such grandeur for granted in wartime or peacetime.

This is one of those movies that takes several viewings for the weight & beauty of its message to truly sink in. Powell probably found it challenging to fully express the importance of his nature-loving views in an age where environmentalism had yet to become a catchword. How to make it exciting? The mystery of the glueman acts more as a foil for Powell's plea for land conservation. The local children's mock war battle on a bucolic stretch of river & Sheila Sim's alarming walk through the very real decimation of ancient Canterbury is Powell's use of patriotism for Terra Britannia Herself. In such scenes the British audience is warned what can be lost forever if appreciated too late.

'A Canterbury Tale' was one of the Archers most underrated gems. I'm glad it made the Criterion Collection. Perhaps they, like Scorsese & Coppola, realized how much the film's environmental theme was way ahead of its time.",1419465600,,1599,5.049242424242424

As the three search for clues of the glueman, they encounter the local people who give the audience a flavor of rural England during the war. In the end, each character becomes a pilgrim receiving a ""blessing."" Seeing how each other get their blessings is one of the most beautiful parts of the film. While the film celebrates the simplicity of rural life, it also provides a spark of hope for postwar England and calls for the necessity of U.S. and England to remain together in the postwar world.

525526,5,630296959X,"As time goes by, this increasingly becomes my favorite film by the Archers -- all of whose films are glorious works of art. But the subtle, multi-layered beauty & spirit of this paean to England & the spirit of place it captures becomes more moving each time I see it. The fact that it's leavened with humor & a deceptively light touch makes it all the more serious in the end, as we follow our contemporary Canterbury pilgrims to their individual blessings & inner realizations.

The plot is simplicity itself, really just a loose connecting thread to bind together deeply felt & realized moments: historical, emotional, spiritual. As our American & British sergeants, accompanied by their Land Girl companion, attempt to solve the secret of the (not so) mysterious Glue Man who's been frightening local women, we're gradually initiated into a sense of time & tradition that stretches back centuries, and still permeates the present for those with the sensitivity to glimpse it. This is made quietly, powerfully clear by the key scene for me, with Colpepper (essentially the semi-mystical guardian of the mysteries) & Alison alone on the downs, where the presence of the past is palpable, and both achieve a personal illumination & a mutual rapport.

There's so much at work here, yet it's never overt or heavy-handed -- in fact, it's the last thing you'd expect from a film that began as WWII propaganda, promoting understanding between Britain & America. But the fierce intelligence & artistic imagination of its creators wrought a cinematic miracle, one that was little understood at the time, but has since gained in stature. The film is many things, but the one that strikes closest to my own heart is its evocation of a truly meaningful life, one informed by the earth, its history, its traditions, its life. It asks the viewer to consider that contemporary life may well be superficial, moving at too fast a pace for contemplation & genuine human feeling. In this it's all the more relevant today!

I've used words like ""mystical"" & ""spiritual"" in this review. I don't mean them in any strictly denominational sense, but as poetic terms, a means of hinting at something that can't entirely be put into words. Fair warning to some viewers: this is not your typical film, certainly not a summer blockbuster, driven by plot & action & a flashy surface. Instead, it's a meditation, perhaps even a prayer of praise, that invites you in & offers something better & far more authentic than frenetic, fleeting sensation. I know, all this sounds a bit vague ... but it's tone, atmosphere, fineness of feeling, that truly matter here. If I did have to choose just one word to describe it, that word would be ""visionary"" -- it's a film with the pastoral, magical sensibility of William Morris. Most highly recommended!",1377993600,6,2815,4.89727463312369
525527,5,630296959X,"By the time this film was released in England in August, 1944, its citizens had endured 5 long, bitter years of WW II. Maybe the producers intended it to give a fresh dose of optimism to a war weary public who had endured too many bombs, V-1, and V-2 rockets raining down on them from above.
Using Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales as inspiration, the film makers set their characters in Kent and Canterbury during 1943. A common theme of American soldier, Englishwoman, and British soldier trying to come to terms with the war and each other forms the plot. A little bit of mystery is thrown in for good measure. While most such movies of that day could border on hackneyed plots and stereotypes, this one goes deeper, revealing hidden motivations and character development that draw the viewer in. One is left with the feeling of some kind of summation or conclusion to at least part of life's problems just around the next corner, which the Allies desperately needed as the recent Normandy invasion wound its way toward Germany and the Pacific forces ever closer to Japan.

525529,5,630296959X,"This is the engaging story of an American GI on leave in England during the Second World War.  Missing a train, he must spend some time in a village near Canterbury in Kent.  There's a small local mystery, and he meets the townspeople, the British troops training in the area, and the Land Army Girls.  He is dejected because his girl back home has stopped writing.  This calm plot is aided by fine photography of the English countryside, British character actors, and a satisfying absence of steamy romance, heists, exploding cars, gruesome crime, aliens, or zombies.

This 1944 film by ""the Archers,"" Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, flows more slowly than we are used to today, and it may take an American viewer a while to get tuned in to the various British accents.  Stick with it.  There's a wonderful feeling of grace as the film concludes, with Canterbury giving the same ""blessing"" to the wartime soldiers and people of the town as it did to the Canterbury pilgrims of old.

The American in the film, John Sweet, was a soldier in Eisenhower's headquarters when he was spotted by Powell to play the role.  His character will grow on you.  Sweet's performance in this film, however, did not lead to a movie career.  Rather he became a teacher after the war.

When you view the disc, don't miss the opening and closing scenes that were added to a shorter version of the film when it was shown in the U.S.

And there's this scene.  A local magistrate, played by Eric Portman, gives the troops a talk on the history of the area and ""the Pilgrim road.""  Let it inspire anyone who helps preserve nature, or the past:

""There are more ways than one of getting to know your ancestors.  Follow the old road, and as you walk, think of them and the old England.  They climbed Chillingbourne Hill, just as you.  They sweated and paused for breath just as you did today.  When you see the bluebells in the spring and the wild thyme, the broom and the heather, you're only seeing what their eyes saw.  You ford the same rivers, hear the same birds singing, and when you lie flat on your back and rest, and watch the clouds sailing, as I often do, you're so close to those other people that you can hear the thrumming of the hoofs of their horses, and the sound of the wheels on the road, their laughter and talk, and the music of the instruments they carried.  And when I turn the bend in the road, where they too saw the towers of Canterbury, I feel I've only to turn my head to see them on the road behind me.""

525532,5,630296959X,"A Canterbury Tale defies categorization. Is it a comedy about an American in rural England? Is it a noir mystery about a guy who assaults women? Is it a romantic comedy, or a comedy of manners, or a spiritual odyssey? Is it a ""why we fight"" British WW2 propaganda film?

Yes. It's all these things and more.

The film tells the story of three modern pilgrims in a fictional town near Canterbury. Two of them are on their way to the ancient pilgrimage site, and the third will discover soon that he is destined to make the trip as well. They're brought together by a late-night attack of the ""Glue Man"", an unknown assailant who assaults young women by throwing glue in their hair and then running off. (think about how putting glue on the hair of pretty young women symbolizes a sexual assault) They decide to solve the mystery of the Glue Man's identity before continuing their voyage to the Cathedral. And in the end, they discover that modern pilgrims may receive a blessing, too.

Because Powell and Pressburger are playing with genre in the early parts of the film, you almost have to watch it twice to really absorb it. The characters and the beautiful rural vistas need time to grow on you. It's not a slow film, but it is a slow build. It all comes together in the end, and it's magical.

Several times in the movie, characters discuss the difference between film and life. Movies are seen as a kind of inferior art form. Powell & Pressburger challenge that attitude. They want to suggest the image of film as cathedral, as gateway to the sacred. Movies can be more, they promise, and they never looked back for the rest of their collaborations.

525533,4,630296959X,"This is a Powell and Pressburger classic.  Made in 1944, it is set in Kent and partly in Canterbury.  The effects of the Baedeker Blitz on Canterbury in 1942 are vividly and movingly shown.  The film must have been wonderful propaganda at the time but it is also profound, being a re-working of one of Chaucer's `Canterbury Tales' in modern dress.  The Tale itself is a little quirky, but modern events which surround it provide the makers of the film with the opportunity to comment cinematically on the eternal verities, the continuities in English life, and the similarities (as well as the differences) between England and America.  I presume it was principally intended to boost morale here; but I imagine it would also have worked well in the USA.

What does the film say to us now (2011)?  The Kent countryside has probably changed more in the last 60 years than it did in the previous 600; and much of what we see and hear has now changed; but the Cathedral is still there; and the various `miracles' which occur at the end of the film are relevant to everyone, in all ages.

525554,5,630296959X,"A strange,beautiful film which taps into the roots of English traditions,and a mystical worship of the landscape,a spiritual journey between past and present in a time of war. Powell and Pressburger somehow conjure out of a silly plot about a mystery Glueman putting glue in young women's hair,to condense the spiritual life of England into a continuous revelatory presence that resists all the changes with its patriotic continuity. The rural Kentish scenery is the constant backdrop as the action plays out in a village where the local blacksmith still plies his ancient trade,timber is lopped and prepared according to time-honoured methods and the mail is delivered by horse and cart. The film is permeated by the persistence of historical memory. Its composition could be set at any time in the last 600 years. The focus is on a distinctively moral and spiritual identity. The film, evoking Chaucer's Canterbury Tales,follows a select band of modern pilgrims,who are each on their way to Canterbury. The trio of land girl Alison(Sheila Sim),American officer Bob(John Sweet), and British officer Peter(Dennis Price) set out to unmask the mysterious Glueman,who pours glue onto the hair of young girls out late at night with servicemen. Eric Portman plays the enigmatic Thomas Colpepper-magistrate, lecturer and Powell's alter-ego prophet-with a strange intensity,giving the film its peculiar power. Revealing himself as the Glueman,he sees himself as a missionary, preventing local women fron dallying with soldiers,to reawaken a sense of Britain's rural heritage among its troops. He says the 3 pilgrims are going to Canterbury for a `blessing' or to do penance.

Erwin Hillier's black and white cinematography,brings out the Kentish world of Powell's childhood through its lyrical photography,chiaroscuro shadows,elevated angles. The narrative trajectory follows various sight lines of the cathedral from an elevated bend in the Pilgrim's Road and poetically from the vistas opened up by the bombing of Canterbury. Footage of Canterbury Cathedral is breath-taking inside and outside,shots of the fields of Kent are gorgeous,the beauty is shown by the whole framing of a green landscape. When Alison,Gibbs and Johnson once more believe that miracles can happen,then so do we in cinematic miracles. Every object hearkens back to a former time or mythology of Englishness,encompassing hawks,ducking-stools,illuminated manuscripts and the poetry of Chaucer,a shadowy universe between present and past. Despite the trappings of Christianity we are in a pagan world. Powell packs into the last 25 minutes his love of the land and traditions we are fighting for:dozens of small touches, glimpses of textures,effects of sunlight and shadows. If earlier Powell-Pressburger films look to the cosmopolitanism of the Riviera or the last of Austria-Hungary, this fully enters the Kentish world of Powell's childhood and discovers a strain of the magical too often ignored in the English landscape and character. The film explicitly evokes Chaucer, with a dazzling jump cut from a mediaeval falconer to an ARP look-out, but is also informed by Shakespeare and Blake. For each pilgrim a miracle occurs.

In some ways it kind of reminds me of Rudyard Kipling's ""Kim"".  There's not really a plot, as such, there's just people who come together for a while, do their thing, and part.

A couple of things make it clear this is a WWII propaganda film made to encourage wartime Anglo-American friendship and understanding:  Sgt Johnson impresses the locals with his knowledge of lumber, and then goes on to slam isolationists who oppose the Lend Lease program.  At the end he is completely overwhelmed by the glory of Canterbury Cathedral, but remains proud of his small rural church back in Oregon.

What else to say.  Well, Kent is laid out in all its glory.  I lived in the UK for a couple of years in the mid 1980's, and got to travel all over, including to Kent.  Seeing the hop gardens, drying sheds, and the manicured British countryside brought a nostalgic lump to my throat.

525557,5,630296959X,"A CANTERBURY TALE is an enchanting film from British filmmakers, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.  The film takes place during the height of World War II and originally served as a propaganda tool for the British Ministry of Information.  But underneath the exterior of the film, there is a deep underlying meaning of revisiting and taking a pilgrimage to the past in order to understand the present.

Powell and Pressburger invoke British romanticism and spiritualism that is clearly shown with the shadow and light essence of the film that is exceptionally conveyed and characterized through the cinematography.  Undeniably, the beautiful English countryside and village landscape offers a quaintness and familiarity that echoes home in terms of American versus British identity, which is seen and heard in the conversations between American G.I., Sgt. Bob Johnson (John Sweet) and British soldier, Sgt. Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price) as they speak atop a grassy hill as well as throughout the film.  Also, there is a complex subplot that involves Alison Smith (Sheila Sim) who served in the British Women's Land Army and the town's Magistrate, Thomas Colpepper (Eric Portman), which is ambiguously portrayed.

Overall, THE CANTERBURY TALE is indeed on the list of thought-provoking films. It subtly recants Chaucer's original tale, but it is an original Powell and Pressburger production that that resonates the history of England.  This is definitely a film that should be viewed more than once.",1181001600,,1501,5.361702127659575

The cinematography was as natural as ever with this team's films.
  Criterion offers this as a set of two CDs. Good as the extras are, they end up raising the price to the point I fear very few people will give this film a look.

525561,4,630296959X,"What a peculiar little film this is.

In 1943, the filmmaking tandem of Powell and Pressburger (the Archers), probably best known for their expressionistic Technicolor fantasies (The Red Shoes, Black Narcissus), found themselves enlisted into the war effort. Britain was about to be invaded, not by the Nazis, but by visiting Yankee soldiers preparing for D-Day and the retaking of the continent.

Overpaid, oversexed, and over here.

The purpose of A Canterbury Tale appears to be twofold - primarily, it's a welcoming to the Americans, celebrating the common language, heritage, and history between host and visitor. At odds with this is an obvious second goal, that being to encourage the Yanks to keep their things in their pants and out of virginal English women. We like you, just don't marry our daughters.

After a brief prologue set in medieval times (paying homage to the Chaucer classic from which the picture takes its title), we are set hurtling into the present (the present being 1943) with a hawk/Spitfire match-cut that would make Kubrick proud. What there is of a plot centers on three modern day ""pilgrims"" - a British soldier, an American G.I., and a woman newly recruited into the British Woman's Land Army. On their way to Canterbury, a brief detour in a strange English village is extended after the ""landgirl"" Alison is victimized by ""the Glue Man,"" a mysterious nocturnal predator pouring ""the sticky stuff"" into the hair of the poor women of Chillingbourne. The three travelers set about solving the mystery of the Glue Man, and wouldn't you know it, learn something about the culture and customs of the English countryside while they're at it.

The film received a fair amount of notoriety at the time, not wholly positive, regarding the suggestive nature of the Glue Man. Indeed, his bizarre crime recalls that of Multiple Miggs of Silence of the Lambs (or even There's Something About Mary), by which he was encouraged to swallow his own tongue. It's an act, one can't help but assume, of sublimated sexual desire (a theme the Archers would revisit with enthusiasm in Black Narcissus). Notably, a later discussion of the Glue Man (between the victim and a female coworker) occurs over lunch, between hardy gulps from an oversized bottle of milk.

Ultimately, as the film seeks to reconcile piety and unaffected living with modernity, sex, and war, our three pilgrims ""follow the Old Road,"" finding unexpected ""blessings"" in the titular town of Canterbury as reward for abstinence (symbolic and literal). A girlfriend reappears (after a presumed cuckolding), a husband rises from the dead, and a childhood dream is fulfilled (in a church, natch), all with the magical-realism that would come to define the Powell-Pressburger partnership. But don't let the romanticism deceive you - after a parade through town, the boys are sent off to battle with a rousing rendition ""Onward Christian Soldier."" There are two wars to be won, after all: the one on the battlefield and the one at home.

Interesting footnote: An earlier of the script for A Canterbury Tale replaced the Glue Man with an individual who simply tore at the skirts of his female victims with scissors, lest anyone think I exaggerate the underlying sexual symbolism (and indeed, malevolence) of ""the sticky stuff.""",1168992000,2,3302,5.047706422018349
525562,5,630296959X,"Because the team of Powell and Pressburger are responsible for one of my very most favorite movies of all time (THE RED SHOES), and because they are the team behind some high quality oldies (BLACK NARCISSUS, THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD, I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING), I put A CANTERBURY TALE in my Netflix queue.

In wartime England, three persons--a young woman and two soldiers about to set off to war--meet in a town near Canterbury, and end up trying to solve the mystery of The Glue Man, the unknown assailant who's been pouring glue on the hair of women who are out after dark. In solving the mystery, they become friends. Along with a local farmer-scholar, they end up journeying to Canterbury Cathedral, as sort of pilgrims, each with an unfilfilled longing or prayer. What they find there is more and quite different than they expected.

Astonishingly good. Gorgeously done. Intimate, yet with large themes. Mystical, yet down-to-earth.

I'd hate to give away too much, since I do recommend you catch this oldie. I will that the way they've tied in Chaucer's tale with a modern settings and concerns (for then, this was during WWII), and the way they offer a slice of British life from a bygone era, and the depiction of the inexorable pull of fate toward the ancient holy place--well, it's just what one expects from P & P. Highest quality film-making with excellent characterization and beautiful shots of another time and place.

The actors aren't stars, which is good. One of the leads was just what he seemed to be: a U.S. army sergeant. The young woman who plays Allison has a healthy, sturdy attractiveness that isn't over-the-top Hollywood glamour. You believe her as someone who would love to live on a farm. The Brit off-to-war guy is energetic and mischievous and out to do the right thing as he sees it. The mysterious Mr. Colpepper seems very threatening and controlling in some scenes, and as if he were having visions in others, so that he ends up being fascinating and creepy and, ultimately, surprising. The film seems to imbue his character with an enigmatic depth that is hard to explain. It's just gotta be seen. You'll either loathe him or sympathize with him. But you won't remain neutral. And I found myself liking Sergeant Johnson and Allison so very much, and just wanting to cry at the for all of them.

The ending is moving and satisfying, and the cinematography and direction is top-notch. I felt spiritually touched at the finale, and rewound it to see the scenes inside the cathedral again.

525563,5,630296959X,"A Canterbury Tale is a real gem of a film, and very much better than I remembered it being. On the surface it's an unashamed love letter to England (as opposed to Britain) and all things English, past and present, but it's also filled with a love of life and its everyday miracles that gives it a timeless magic beyond its immediate wartime setting. Indeed, the plot device of the 'glue man' targeting local girls who go with soldiers is forgotten entirely in the last half hour as all three accidental pilgrims receive their blessings, small and great, in Canterbury in a finale at once miraculous and very real. It's full of film-making at once wonderfully ambitious - the sudden cut from a medieval hawk to a spitfire beats Kubrick's bones and monkeys to the punch by a good 44 years - and dryly amusing - Dennis Price's joke about getting a halo is instantly accompanied by a bit of backlighting that gives him just that in a charming variation of the top hat/smokestack joke from I Know Where I'm Going.

It's a charmingly resilient morale booster too, avoiding obvious propaganda to give a sense of a world with a past worth preserving and a future proudly stated in the bombed out basements of old shops proudly carrying their former owners' signs, made at a time when victory was still just a far off possibility. The England and its way of life it celebrates may no longer exist, but the film endures. Funny, smart and also surprisingly moving, from anyone else this would be their masterpiece, but from Powell and Pressburger it's just one of many jewels in their crown.

Criterion's disc boasts a fine transfer of the uncut original UK version.

Time is taken to give depth and background to all the main characters by the use of interactive dialog. We find that each brings different technical skills and interpretations of the road to Canterbury:

U.S. Army Sergt. Bob Johnson (U.S. Sergeant John Sweet) on his way to Canterbury mistakenly gets off in the hamlet of Kent. He is accused of having his stripes on upside down.

British Sgt. Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price) is temporarily stationed at Kent while staging for overseas. He was and theater organ player before the war.

Alison Smith (Sheila Sim) a London store clerk before the war is now seeking a job as a `Land Girl'. She seems to have an uncanny knowledge of Kent and the Pilgrims' road to Canterbury.

The night they got off the train at Kent they had a strange encounter with the mysterious ""Glue Man"". Then befriended by the local magistrate, Thomas Colpeper, JP (Thomas Colpeper, JP). Mr. Colpeper is interested in the history of the Pilgrims' Road from Kent to Canterbury.

Until you get pretty much through this story you are never really sure where they are trying to take you. Is the focus on a local mystery? The interaction of the players or the lives of the characters themselves?

I have fond memories of my weeks spent in this historic and sacred city. So, I am puzzled that I somehow missed this wonderful, mysterious and inspiring movie by the great Powell and Pressburger. If you have stumbled onto this movie page, I hope you will consider ordering a copy of this particular set, which comes with a booklet of essays. And, in this case, these essays are quite goodthought provoking. Plus, a secondary DVD introduces us to some of the remarkable cast members as they continue to reflect on this movie many years later. There's even footage of walking tour of movie-related sites around the Canterbury area. How I wish I could be back there when it's time for these annual walking tours!

So, first, a word of warning! When my wife and I started the movie, we both were eager to see Canterbury. Like me, she has fond memories of the city. Our now-adult daughter was with us in Canterbury at one point when she was only 2 years old. We were eager to see spots we remembered. And I don't think it's a spoiler to say: The movie opens outside Canterburyin a tiny, rural town during World War II. And, bizarrely enough, there's a sort of Hitchcock-style suspense story about a mysterious ""Glueman,"" who haunts the blacked out byways of this tiny town looking for women who the Glueman can attack witha blob of glue in the women's hair.

My wife actually said, ""This is so odd! I don't get this movie at all! I thought this was about Canterbury.""

Turns out, this is a common response. One of the main actors says as much in a recent video interview. The Glueman? Truly strange!

Then, so we don't spoil your enjoyment, I will say simply: You'll get over that disorientation if you know that Powell and Pressburger were aiming at mysteries far larger than a blob of glue.
