7960398,5,B0000640TW,I bought this DVD for my 12-year-old brother and he LOVED it.  He watches these programs all the time on TV and it was a perfect birthday present.,1194912000,2,146,4.214285714285714
7960399,5,B0000640TW,"I bought this to show to my 5th grade class as I delve into the study of reptiles throughout the year. However, I had to stop the video when it got to the graphic activity of procreation. As a public school teacher, I cannot show this. It always is an issue for me as I am unable to show so many wonderful and educational videos due to this very issue. Why does every nature animal video need to show the animals procreating? You've excluded a big audience. Other than that, the video was wonderful. Sadly, I was the only one able to see it and was never able to show it to any of my classes.",1161993600,10,592,4.112068965517241
7960400,5,B0000640TW,The Wildlife Stores series is a very high quality documentary set. Why they are so cheap to buy is a mystery to me.  Very thorough coverage of crocs ans snakes.,1061596800,13,160,4.333333333333333
