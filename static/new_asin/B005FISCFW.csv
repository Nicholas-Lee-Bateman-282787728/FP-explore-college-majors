4675564,1,B005FISCFW,"Remember the show Joanie Loves Chachi?  Remember how every time Scott Baio came down the stairs wearing a tank-top all the girls in the audience would swoon and go ""Whooooooooooo!!!""?  Well, when Kutcher the TV Show Butcher came down them stairs sans beard, all the girls in the audience swooned and went ""Whooooooooooo!!!""

This show has officially become this generation's Joanie Loves Chachi.  Congratulations America, the last good sit-com has jumped the shark and been Kutchered (I mean butchered).  Long live Scott Baio.",1326758400,10,526,5.289156626506024

i'll stop watching season nine. the real ""two and a half men"" sitcom ends with season eight.",1326153600,34,163,4.620689655172414
4675566,3,B005FISCFW,"Jon Cryer and Angus T Jones I give alot of credit for the work they must work with.

4675567,5,B005FISCFW,All TV series have good and bad shows.  Two and A Half Men mades me laugh old or new ones.  Some are funnier than others with or without Charlie.  I like them all.,1322956800,2,163,3.878787878787879
4675568,5,B005FISCFW,"I actually like this new set up. Alan lost a Brother but gained a friend. And I like how Charlie's character wasn't replaced with someone with the same mentality. Its something completely differant. Its No longer the anal compulsive, the dumb kid, and the ladies man. Its the Anal Compulsive, the dumb kid, and the man child. So I think the shows core is still intact. 2 And A Half Men and No Adults. And people really need to get over Charlie Sheen. He doesnt write anything. He just portrays a character. Hes not the main reason its funny. Its the writters, directors, and producers. Hes just an actor.",1322956800,3,604,4.5504587155963305
4675569,3,B005FISCFW,"CRUDE TITLE, I mean really. Clearly NOT the same show BUT Aston & Jon deliver with what IT offeres THEM.
Cant WE get cleaner TITLES PLEASE!",1322092800,,139,4.384615384615385
4675570,2,B005FISCFW,"Although the actors are great, the new show seems to have taken a ""dumb and dumber"" direction.
Charlie was the reasonable man as opposed to Alan and Jake. However, the new character is clearly another dummy. The result - three dummies in the same house.
The jokes also seem to have become crass - weird that this reference to ""crass"" is coming from me ;-)
As in the previous seasons many [non-flattering] jokes seem to be inserted in the show and aimed at Charlie the actor, not Charlie the character.. or so my impression is..
Overall, I still watch the show because I used to like it a lot.

EDIT May 5, 2012:
I feel that the original review needs an update - I stopped watching the new episodes since mid-November 2011 even though I was recording them till the end of 2011 - I deleted them one by one after a few min of watching and skipping ahead. I was trying to ""warm up"" to it but failed. The new show does not agree with my taste I guess.
I still like and watch seasons with Sheen and recommend them.",1320969600,18,1008,4.277486910994765

4675651,1,B005FISCFW,This is the first season without Charlie. I watched the first couple episodes of this season and that was it. Not one laugh. It was never the same again without Charlie. Kutcher just didn't fit in with this show to me. Charlie Sheen was perfect. I will just stick with the first 8 seasons. Which I own and can watch them anytime I want. Do not even bother wasting your money and time with this disgrace of a sitcom. If someone gave it to me for free I wouldn't accept it.

4675764,5,B005FISCFW,"Show is excellent, not the same as when Charlie Sheen was on it. Charlie is not replaceable by anyone but still great show.",1399852800,,123,4.391304347826087
4675765,1,B005FISCFW,"One and a half men and a narcissist who can't act. When they got rid of Charlie, John Cryer should have taken over as the star. What most people don't understand is that John Cryer is a comic genius and an excellent actor. He was badly cast in this show from the beginning. The writers should never have made him into the stooge. With Charlie's supposed passing, the writers should have allowed John's character to grow up, become self assured and take over the show. Instead they forced this looser on us and killed the show. Why is it still on the air?",1399593600,2,554,4.388349514563107
4675766,4,B005FISCFW,"Everyone was wondering if it would be possible to replace Charlie Sheen on the show. In my opinion, Kucher is a great replacement and a likable character. However, I am not terribly fond of how the whole thing was set up. There were a million ways they could have made Allen a likable character while still introducing Walden as in interesting new best friend. Unfortunately they chose to reduce Allen to a disagreeable joke of a character who is so pathetic he doesn't even bother to go to work. It is really rather hard to believe Walden would want him around. While there are a number of good episodes in this season and while the show continues to be entertaining, I can't get over the fact that there were a lot of missed opportunities.",1398470400,3,741,4.537313432835821

4675770,1,B005FISCFW,"This show is dead without Charles...the writers are just trying to keep a once cash cow alive.  I loved the first 8 seasons enough to just buy them.  I watched the first 5 episodes of season 9, and I'm done, total rubbish!",1388966400,2,222,4.261904761904762
4675771,3,B005FISCFW,"At first, it seemed the writers struggled with Ashton Kutcher's character. Too many penis jokes, was he smart or dumb, a babe magnet or socially inept. Finally, they got the formula right by using Cryer's incredible talent as the smarmy ner-do-well leech. Kutcher has settled nicely into his new role as a babe magnet, incredibly patient (if cryptic) roommate/homeowner/baby sitter for Cryer.",1388188800,,392,5.338709677419355
4675772,5,B005FISCFW,I think Ashton Kutcher did a good job stepping in for Charlie Sheen when he left the series. I was apprehensive about what the show would be like without Charlie but I found it to be very funny. And of course they kept the wacko Rose in the show which made it even funnier. I enjoyed this season very much. The packaging and service was great.,1387324800,,343,4.212121212121212
4675985,1,B005FISCFW,"The producers might not want to admit but without Charlie S. Two and a Half Men just isn't a good TV program.

4675986,5,B005FISCFW,"Pretty simple, if you are a big fan of Two and A Half Men, you will like this season.  If you are looking for the Charlie Sheen effect, it's not there anymore.  I feel they pulled off a difficult switch rather well, and in the long run added some years to the show.  New material, new people, new stupidity.

For all the negative things said about it, I find it downright hilarious, and some episodes are worth watching quite a few times.",1383696000,,438,4.304878048780488

I still enjoyed this and in as much I have all the previous 8 seasons, I couldn't resist giving it a try.  Once you get over the fact it is not Charlie and give it a fair shake, I think you will enjoy it as I did.",1383004800,2,383,3.7037037037037037
4675988,2,B005FISCFW,"I have tried to give this new version with Ashton a chance but finally accepted it wasn't just me,the show is watered down from the original and isn't that funny. At first, I thought it was only my comparison between this product and the previous seasons with Sheen. And I refuse to believe the numbers given by Kutcher and the producers of the show where they attempt to tell us as an audience how much better it is. Yeah, right.

4675992,1,B005FISCFW,"With the departure of Charlie Sheen ended what might have been the best comedy sitcom of the decade. Show was beautifully developed across 8 seasons. We saw Charlie Alan and Jake all age and blossom into a well-balanced cast full of chemistry, with re-occuring characters such as Berta Rose and Evelyn supplementing them well. It was a sad day when Charlie cut ties with the show, and anyone who hoped Ashton could have filled the void would have been thoroughly disappointed. To say season 9 was bad would be an overstatement, it was a flat-out tragedy. Jake's character is simply overkill from what he was in season 8, Alan is trying too hard to beat up his character and short of putting a bullet through his head to emphasize such, is frankly pathetic. Walden is out of place and simply does not fit the persona of the show. I would have been disappointed if Two and a half men choose to go out after season 8 after the fall out with Sheen, but continuing the show in this direction is absolutely pathetic and unfair to it's fans.",1377734400,3,1034,4.53475935828877

4676028,1,B005FISCFW,"I bought this season (not through Amazon) only because I'm that kind of nerd who needs to have the one or two episodes that deal with Charlie's burial and closure from the story. Period. This show ends the moment Kutcher's character steps in and Alan accidentally spreads Charlie's ashes all over the place. From that moment on, all you're left with is a degraded and unlovable Alan, a dumb and moronic Jake and a parody of a character named Walden.

All that was great about the previous seasons is absent in this one, including the obvious main persona...

I started to smell a decline already in season 7, though. The intelligent jokes around a true life style began to give way to a blunt and uncritical praise of decadence, drugs and alcohol. It happened slowly, in increments, but it was noticeable. Still, Charlie Sheen made it all worth it until the end of season 8.

But season 9 is just a complete and senseless exercise in stupidity.",1365120000,6,944,4.640718562874252

Well, I didn't watch any shows when it aired (have seasons 1-8 with Charlie)... but decided from recommendations to buy Season 9 and am I glad I did. Ashton's character is every bit as funny as Charlie. OMG, the team are hilarious together. In fact I'd have to say, I think the show is equal if not slightly better. Sad that Rose doesn't have many appearances in this new Season but then she was tied to the Charlie character after all... (she married him.... and killed him...). The opening show at the funeral was just one of the funniest. Alan is a bigger leech than ever but they need to be careful with this character, he was a little over the top in some shows and there's a fine balance between laughable and annoying. Some shows I found myself despising the character more than laughing so don't overdo the character. As for the rest of the cast, well as I said, it just is an incredibly funny show that they ALL contribute to but Ashton's character is definitely different to Charlie but equally entertaining. I never thought of him as much of an actor but in this role, he shines. I'm sold... can't wait for Season 10 to come out on DVD :-) I have to find out what's happening with Jake, the teasers they have on that character are hilarious too. Can't wait to see how he develops in Season 10. Great writing, funny, funny jokes and lines throughout.

I really, really tried to give it a chance. Ashton Kutcher in my opinion, is really not that funny and certainly was not as funny as Charlie Sheen. Alot of what made the original Two and a Half Men so funny, was Charlie's womanizing, and drunkin ways and how the rest of the characters had to suffer...especially Alan which was downright hilarious. Ashton as Walden seems annoying and there is no laughter there..as I said my opinion.

Also alot of comments talked about Jon Cryer and how his character has gotten worse and I agree. There is one thing leeching off your brother but a stranger? anyway the thing I think what also made the original(yes i will call it that)better, is that Sheen and Cryer really seemed to have a great chemistry with each other. I don't seem to get that with Cryer and Kutcher and one poster said that the show should be now called ""Alan and two knuckleheads"" which is funny. Though I will pass on this one...I would rather stick with the original and as my title says, glad I own seasons 1-8 with CHARLIE.",1347580800,16,1203,4.418918918918919

4676216,1,B005FISCFW,"For 8 seasons ""2  Men"" was one of the biggest shows on TV and garnered dozens of awards, including 4 People's Choice wins, and Emmy wins for editing, mixing, and supporting actor. Charlie Sheen was nominated for a Golden Globe in 2005 and 2006 and by the SAG in 2005 and 2010. Then the crash. Then the revival.

Is the new show as awful as some critics suggest? No, not when you compare it to the trash that passes for TV comedy these days (apologies to ""Big Bang Theory"" and ""Two Broke Girls""). But when you look back at the previous 8 seasons, there has been a major drop in the quality of the writing and the acting.

It can't all be blamed on Ashton Kutcher, although one has to question whether or not you can take someone seriously when he continually appears naked and when so many jokes are made about the size of his penis. Really?! The ""man boy"" thing gets pretty tired.

Poor Jon Cryer has deteriorated not only as an actor, but his character on the show has changed to someone with no redeeming qualities. In the previous seasons he had a job, tried to relate to his son, and did his best to get along with his ex wives even though he was inept. Now he is simply a manipulative deadbeat. There's no humor there.

In past seasons lots of laughs could be counted on whenever Conchata Ferrell (the housekeeper), Holland Taylor (the mother), and Melanie Lynskey (Rose, the stalker) showed up. In Season 9 we never see Rose, rarely see the mother, and the housekeeper's character has also deteriorated greatly. She simply isn't funny anymore.

About the only good thing in Season 9 is that Angus T Jones seems to have come into his own, and his scenes are finally funny, after several seasons of blah.

What can we do? Certainly don't buy this product which is devoid of laughs. And stop watching the show, if you do, because otherwise they will keep churning out this garbage. Unfortunately I can't recommend watching Sheen's new TV series ""Anger Management"". It's OK - better than  ""2 "", but not up to the old standards.

Maybe everyone can bury the hatchet, and we'll find out in Season 11 that Seasons 9 and 10 were all a bad dream, and Charlie is back. (It worked for ""Dallas"")",1344297600,48,2189,4.466165413533835

Auston's character wasn't a replacement Charlie like it should have been but instead a new Allan. They didn't change one main character but everyone when Charlie was replaced. Now I don't blame Auston for his horrible character since he is only able to be as good as the charcter is...which is why people say he sucks. His character sucks NOT him, imagine how he feels being a mentally slow millionare who just replaced Charlie Sheen on a very popular sitcom.

I am sure something could have been done to ease the tensions between Sheen and the producers so that everyone could have remained in their element. Adding Kutcher to the mix not only killed off Sheen's character, but it also killed one of the best sitcoms on American television. Kutcher is a lousy actor in just about every direction and was a bad choice for a replacement.  Sheen cannot be replaced-simple as that! I have stopped watching it because it hurts too much to look at the cast that makes up the Harper family and their quirky friends degrade themselves. It is NOT FUNNY ANYMORE! The stories are scattered and the dialogue is stupid. Having Kutcher strip every now and then just for laughs is just plain vulgar. Please do buy and watch seasons 1-8 and leave well enough alone.

Charlies THE MAN and this would of been like taking Al Bundy out of Married with Children and replacing him. Just wouldnt of worked and either does this.
At least I got seasons 1-8 on dvd to watch over.",1328659200,15,491,4.23404255319149

8470031,1,B005FISCFW,The exec producer sold out the fans by firing Charlie Sheen. That this show went on for four more seasons with comparable ratings shows what sheep people are; especially given the fact that the show went from phenomenal to craptacular.,1500076800,,235,4.9
