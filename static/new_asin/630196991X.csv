391926,5,630196991X,"At a time when Dr. Jack Kivorkian has made his way back into the headlines and there is soo much controversy over the morality of mercy killing, ""Grace Quigley"" lends a comical twist to the issue.  Grace Quigley (Katharine Hepburn) seeks out a hit-man (Nick Nolte) to aid her in exiting a world in which she feels she has outlived her usefulness.  However, the hit-man is having a hard time dealing with some of his own feelings.  A seemingly unlikely pair, Hepburn and Nolte make an unforgettable team in this comedy focused on a highly explosive social topic.",992563200,8,561,4.704081632653061

392047,5,630196991X,A great movie...funny storyline with quality acting...a hitman who wants to retire due to nervous conditions meets a little old lady who wants to put him to work...just wish this would be released on DVD...,1385683200,,206,4.914285714285715
392048,5,630196991X,"Hepburn and Nolte are great together.  It's offbeat, highly improbably but not entirely impossible.  You don't have to think, just enjoy.",1371513600,,137,5.476190476190476
392049,4,630196991X,"I would have liked it if I could have purchased this on DVD. I was only able to find it second hand on VHS which we all know is not the clearer picture that DVD or better yet Blue Ray. but the movie it self is still just as funny as when I saw it the first time.
Elderly woman in dispare wittnesses her landlords demise by a hit man and decides to hire the hitman to take her out. She can't afford the hit mans price and so gets an elderly man to pay double the amount for the same deal.....well Grace Quigley ends up teaming up with the hitman. She sets up hits on her elderly friends who are ready to depart this life. Many mishaps take place and the funnies begin.
I love this movie,very funny...",1366675200,,699,4.0359712230215825
392050,5,630196991X,"My Mother loved this movie! Possibly because Katherine Hepburn plays the GQ role; her favorite actress and because Grace Quigley is my mother's name. And she felt just fine with Ms. Hepburn's performance and belives the idea could actually make a good business plan. A WWII US Army Nurse, with 3 combat invasion landings in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy, she wants to know why Grace (KH) needs hit-man Nick Nolte; just a syringe and a little ..... special juice...

392051,5,630196991X,"This is one of my favorite dark comedies especially since it stars two of my all-time favorite actors, Nick Nolte and Katherine Hepburn. I don't think it sold in DVD, which is too bad for dark comedy buffs.",1283040000,,206,4.447368421052632
392052,5,630196991X,"The movie is a ""black comedy"" but was funny and interesting.  Great cast and superb performances by Nilte and Hepburn.  Tragically funny.  A ""must see""!",1252368000,,152,5.0
392053,5,630196991X,I have loved this movie for years and have had a very hard time trying to find it so I was thrilled when I saw it here.  It is everything I hoped it would be and was delighted with the company and quality of the VHS.,1240358400,,216,3.6956521739130435

392055,4,630196991X,"I've owned this video for years and am going to transfer it to dvd as I can't find it on that media.

I found many parts of this movie poignant, and the chase scene probably one of the most, if not THE most, hysterical in movie history.

If you don't find assisted suicide distasteful, or at least can understand the reasons for a person wishing to decide for themselves what their quality of life is and should be, do buy this movie.",1211414400,,434,4.280487804878049

7818449,1,630196991X,I could not see this film - it may be a pirated edition that won't run in the US.  I think then vendor should have mentioned it was not compatible with US format,1473379200,,161,3.878787878787879
7818450,4,630196991X,"Grace Quigley is a rare offering.  The pairing of
Hepburn and Nolte is a contrast to anything that Hepburn has ever.  It is macabre humor at it's best.  Biopsies is a delight and only the taxi scene is a weak offering.  This is.not a movie to share with your Pastor.",1455580800,,266,4.26
7818451,5,630196991X,I love this odd combination of Hepburn and Nolte. Good twists. we love it.,1447718400,,74,4.357142857142857

7818454,5,630196991X,"This old, funny movie highlights the unspoken problem of old people who would like to die. Nobody talks about this but it is handled with complete charm and humor in this classic film.  So glad to find it.",1402531200,,205,4.394736842105263
7818455,5,630196991X,"I saw this movie years ago and have tried to get a copy of it for many years because I thoroughly enjoyed it.  You wouldn't think it was funny, but it is, and the acting is great.  When I purchased my computer earlier this year I became familiar with Amazon  -  I was delighted to find this movie on Amazon, and it is still as entertaining as I remembered it to be.",1402099200,,365,4.027777777777778
7818456,4,630196991X,"Good Film!
I had seen the film in the theatres and wanted to enjoy it again.  Difficult to locate and it's not in DVD.  How sad!  I found the premise of the plot quite unusual and also the fact that nearly everyone was ""elderly.""  Didn't end quite the way I wanted but anything with Hepburn in it is sure to be good!",1397088000,,316,4.048387096774194
7818457,5,630196991X,A GREAT movie! Dark delicious humor. Katherine and Nick are awesome in this! The magnetism fairly bolts from the screen. This movie was horrifically panned when it came out and those critics should be ashamed of themselves. It was hilariously funny then and very more so 28 years later!,1394323200,,286,4.857142857142857
