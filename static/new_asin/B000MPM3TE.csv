2738284,3,B000MPM3TE,"I facilitate Domestic Violence groups and was hoping to find some new material, or old material presented in a new way.  I didn't find anything that was really new to me, but there was some useful stuff and I don't feel it was wasted money.",1252972800,10,240,4.333333333333333
2738285,5,B000MPM3TE,"I was blown away by this dvd. Very practical tools to work with anger in your daily life in your personal and professional relationships. Not just for the bad tempered, this also talks about other ways we hold anger such as giving the silent treatment. This would benefit every family, everyone. She goes into the childhood development process to explain what anger is, how it arises and how to work with it without stuffing it or acting it out. This should be required viewing!",1233187200,27,478,4.7023809523809526
2738286,5,B000MPM3TE,"Anger management is a complex topic. The Anger Toolbox provides a wonderful foundation for learning about our personalities, as applied to our developing emotions from infancy to adulthood. This DVD provides much more ""theory"" about identifying and understanding anger and other emotions. It is more comprehensive than other anger management techniques, some of which simply focus on behavioral modification to ""control"" anger.",1182816000,30,427,5.903225806451613

8170501,4,B000MPM3TE,It is distilled down from a three day seminar and it is good but Chip Ingram does the subject a lot better.,1407369600,,107,3.909090909090909

8170503,2,B000MPM3TE,"This product arrived with a footer that said 'for personal use only'. No mention of this was made in relation to this product on the Amazon web site. This is problematic since I bought it to show a group. So we're not getting off to a good start here. I wonder, how shall I deal with my anger about this?",1339200000,8,304,4.083333333333333
8170504,1,B000MPM3TE,"When I see the word ""toolbox"" or ""blueprint"" in the title of a book or DVD, I expect that I am going to learn clear, practical techniques and exercises I can use with my therapy clients.  This DVD is a presentation of a lot of theory, and it's not done in an appealing way.  The author begins by telling her own personal story, which I didn't find helpful or all that relevant to the topic.  Then it shows the author talking about her theoretical model of anger with a group of people sitting in a circle.  She's basically lecturing at them, not interacting with them.  Every now and then the camera shows one of these people, and they look like they are sitting there feeling trapped and bored to death.  I must admit that I didn't watch the entire video, because I couldn't stand to continue after about half an hour.  Honestly, it took a lot of patience to last that long.  Maybe it suddenly changed into the most amazing thing ever, but if it did, I would be very surprised.  A big waste of money.",1317168000,24,1001,4.338709677419355
8170505,5,B000MPM3TE,"Oh, Yeah.  Fabulous, Fabulous!  Very up to the minute, useful, and evolved.  I didn't even mind that the last 7 minutes was an advertisement for the institute's services.  I would buy a sequel.",1273968000,3,193,4.757575757575758
