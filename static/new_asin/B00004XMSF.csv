Buena por Carlos Santana uno de mis artistas  favoritos, Los videos Extra tambien son muy buenos.
Se lo recomiendo a todos los fans de Santana no debe faltar en la coleccion.",971568000,7,379,4.712121212121212
1367235,5,B00004XMSF,"The Concert is really done well.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  The Bonus Tracks are excellent also and just are the Cream on top of an already Supurb Production.  I enjoyed the music videos that I've seen on Cable and when I found them included in the Bonus Material I was doublely thrilled.  If you like Carlos this is a Must Buy,  if you don't have a DVD Player then order this and go buy one!!!!",970876800,2,400,4.142857142857143
1367236,5,B00004XMSF,"Realmente impresionante la calidad del sonido en DTS. No se puede comparar con el de los Eagles ya que este ltimo es un concierto acstico, an as a mi me gusta mucho ms, y desde luego, muy superior al de Sheryl Crow. Es una suerte que Santana haya tenido este xito con Supernatural que nos haya permitido disfrutar de la grabacin de este concierto con imagen y sonido digital, cosa que no podemos hacer con otros grandes grupos de los 70 y 80. El nico pero que puede ponerse a este concierto, es que nos hubiese gustado que en el hubiese habido algn tema clsico de Santana ms, por lo dems es una compra totalmente recomendable. Muy bien los extras, incluidos los videos.",970185600,,669,4.4471544715447155
1367237,5,B00004XMSF,"If you love Santana, this is the DVD to buy. I have the CD and it was  great to be able to ""see"" the music performed. As usual Santana  had a beautiful backdrop that has been his trademark for years! The dancers  are beautiful and an exotic touch. I discovered a horn player that gave me  goose bumps on this DVD named Wayne Shorter! Those of you who know him...  he did a solo during the song ""APACHE"" that had me mesmorized.  Sara McLachlan's duet with Santana on ""ANGEL"" is hauntingly  beautiful. THEN there is the bonus material! Four videos! Behinds the  scenes footage... What more can I say.... it is more than worth the money.  I've been a fan for 30 years and this is an incredible acomplishment! Thank  you SANTANA!",969321600,19,725,4.424242424242424

1367262,4,B00004XMSF,"This is an excellent video of a concert that showcases Santana's diverse skills, and appeal.  I will say that product review, above, by Sam Sutherland was actually pretty bad.  First, Santana was in no need of resurrecting his career, he was, and has always been, current--one of the unique qualities of Santana's music.  In this concert he focuses mainly on his Latin work (rather than his more spiritual work such as on Moon Flower), and also concentrates more on his work from the 80s and 90s, rather than earlier--with small exceptions to both.  And, his duet with Sarah McLachlan was not a miss, as Sam suggests, but a truly memorable ballad--one of the highlights of the concert.  Others have discussed this more thoroughly concrt--just wanted to set the record straight on Sam's off target assessment.",1450569600,,808,4.955555555555556

1367286,5,B00004XMSF,"Santana and I go back a long way.  He and his band had just released their debut, self-titled album in the spring of 1969, then rocked Woodstock later that summer.  He then toured with a stop in Honolulu where I was stationed.  Santana was one of those groups that appealed to my rock leanings but at the same time was an easy listen for my, now former, wife who liked a little less acid in her music.

I've seen Santana a few times since, including their Supernatural tour when it hit Dallas in 2000 (I think).  This is an excellent show and is nicely edited to keep things moving along.  There are a handful of brief interviews with some of the guest artists but they consist mostly of one liners and only take up a few seconds.  Shot at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, Santana works with each guest for only one song until the rousing closing number, ""Make Somebody Happy/Right On Be Free.""

Only on ""Angel"" with Sarah McLachlan did things fizzle a bit.  Carlos just picked a few notes on a stationary acoustic guitar and seemed to wish the song was over.  Many of the songs became, and are still, radio staples today.  I thought the most interesting 2-song transition was with ""Maria Maria"" with rappers ""The Product G & B"" (the duo can also sing!) which continued next with jazz sax virtuoso Wayne Shorter on ""Apache.""  Carlos can move around various genres as he's proved over the years.  He's very mellow on ""Victory Is Won"" for example.

Although this concert film is only available on DVD as I write this, it does have a decent surround sound option (5.1) in either Dolby Digital or DTS.  The video looked pretty good but was shot with a 1.33:1 aspect ratio.",1377216000,,1666,4.506666666666667

1367293,2,B00004XMSF,"First let me say that I'm a Carlos Santana fan. No one plays Carlos' signature riffs better than Carlos himself. But ask him to play something outside of his comfort zone and Carlos is a fair to middling guitarist at best, especially when you consider he's been playing guitar for over 50 years. His attempts to add something with acoustic guitar to songs like Sarah McLachlan's ANGEL failed miserably. He looked lost during song intervals that ""begged"" for guitar riffs and when he did play, the riffs were amaterish and distracted from the song. And the fact that his solos are limited to about a dozen signature riffs wouldn't be so bad if he didn't insist on making the solos so long accompanied by facial expressions designed to convince us of the ""supernatural"" effort behind them.",1358985600,,787,4.794117647058823

1367301,5,B00004XMSF,"I've had this DVD for several years and used to pop it in frequently.  I haven't watched it in quite awhile but did so tonight.  I had forgotten how good this disc is!

I could complain that is was not produced in either HD DVD or Blu-ray, which would have made it even better but I won't, because neither medium was available when it was released.  I've admittedly become a video snob and would probably buy a Blu-ray version if one was ever released, though if you have a decent upscaling DVD player for your HDTV, you won't be disappointed in the video.

The true strengths of this DVD are its content (including the extras) and the soundtrack.  You have the choice of either DTS (which I recommend if your receiver allows) or DD 5.1 and it sounds terrific!

While I have read reviews on this site that bemoan the fact that this wasn't classic Santana, I don't see this as any deficit whatsoever.  Hey, I first saw Carlos in concert over 30 years ago and have enjoyed most everything he has done since then.  This was an awesome concept to bring a very diverse group of performers to this album/concert and for Carlos to blend it together into a seamless, tight show.  And the visuals really add to that show!

1367306,3,B00004XMSF,"I have been a Santana fan for almost 40 years.  It is impossible to have continuity for that long.  Chicago, the band, for instance, has most of the major players from the 1st band, yet it is very different today, with two new lead singers.  Santana on this DVD is there, up front.  Yet, with different lead singers than the original, and with a different breakdown of the percussion section than the 1st iteration, there is something imperceptible that is lacking.

To be brief, I was prepared to love this DVD album but found it mediocre.  If you are a fan of the original band with its driving rhythms and lilting vocals, save your money.  There may not be anything available except the Woodstock film or other concerts that they did years ago.  Good luck.",1292457600,,759,4.57037037037037

1367314,5,B00004XMSF,Santana has been one of my all time favorite concerts- they know how to put on a show and celebrate life and music.  (Just like his live concerts - it unbelievable- the sound quality and perfection that Carlos and his band are able to achieve-Live). I expected all the great old songs and was surprised to hear some new and different and great guest collaborations.  This is one that I watched again right away.  I consider this a piece of musical history- so many great musicians in one place.  My husband had not seen Santana before and was an immediate fan by the 2nd song.  (and not just because of the showgirls),1179014400,,617,4.473214285714286
1367315,3,B00004XMSF,"well, for me this is Santana 'lite'. This is not the Santana I grew up with. Of course the musicians are good and the DVD is pretty good overall but it lacks bite. Is it any wonder the masses ate up the CD of the same name?! Easily digestible, just the way most people like their music. I laugh when I hear that Supernatural was Santana's 'comeback' CD, as if he actually went away. He never stopped making music, it was the audience who went away and then came back. Give Carlos credit though, for hooking up with the artists he did because that gave him wider appeal, hence the massive sales. I'll always have a soft spot for Carlos but I prefer the Santana that recorded their first 3 CDs. For me....THAT...was Santana!",1163116800,,722,4.395522388059701
1367316,3,B00004XMSF,"Carlos Santana isn't simply a musician. He's become more of a legend in the nearly 4 decades since he stepped onstage at Woodstock wearing a Jesus Christ ""crown of thorns"" tee shirt and played the living ""you know what"" out of that red Gibson SG.

Since then, Carlos has become the goodwill ambassador for alot of ideals and spirituality that, whether yer on his trip or not, represent all that is good, kind, generous and (dare I say it without making you hurl ) LOVING in the world today. So let's put everything into a slightly different perspective than a simple concert review. A Santana concert is a celebration of brotherhood and fraternity for people around the world.... Something that we could use alot more of these days. This concert certainly delivers a generous portion of just that.

Rarely is someone going to like all of the diverse guest performers in this concert. In fact, being an old geezer and retired pro musician myself, they aren't really my thing either.... So bloody what? Besides, Carlos and the producers of this concert were smart enough to give the younger crowd all these new stars and die hard old Santana fans plenty of the old numbers too. Pretty smart marketing, eh?

As always, the Santana Band delivers tight music, great arrangements,(for rock-n-roll anyway) killer percussion work and Carlos can still play the doggy dew out of a guitar.... Just like he always has. (.......and while I'm at it, I'd just like to remind all the music snobs who say ""Old Carlos has lost his chops"", let's see how well you still play guitar in your mid sixties)... So there.... ya cocky little dilettantes.

I haven't bothered to check out the price at which Amazon's dealers are selling this DVD. But hell, I'd pay ten bucks just to see that drop dead gorgeous PRS guitar that Carlos plays with the orange flame maple top. It's so brilliantly figured it looks like it's about catch fire.... just beautiful.

All in all this DVD is worth having. Perhaps for the Santana connoisseur this concert pales in comparison to Sacred Fire in Mexico.... But what the hell........ It's Carlos fricken Santana...!!

How bad could it possibly be....?

1367320,3,B00004XMSF,"I would not say this dvd is ""Mezmerizing,"" or ""The best ever!"" No way. I didn't see the early Santana band from the 1st 3 albums, but I did see Carlos in 1975, 76, 78, 79, 82, 90 and 2000. I loved the old Carlos Santana when he would rip on the guitar and his music was ""Street/Latin/Rock!"" It was straight up ""Chicano Rock!"" It had a Latin rock groove and every song had ripping guitar work. His 1st 3 albums leaned more towards a hard rock sound. I saw the Supernatural concert here in Portland and I loved it. But I didn't buy the cd bcz it was all Spanish cumbias and every song sounded like a Tejano dance group. Sure, you could say that he's growing and he does what he does, yes I've heard it before and I agree with that. It's just too bad he doesn't rock like he used to. Us early Santana fans miss that. I miss songs like ""Taboo,"" ""Toussaint,"" ""Flor D Luna,"" ""Shades of Time,"" and the entire Santana 3 album... Thats the Carlos I miss.",1130112000,8,945,4.141304347826087

This is one of the best done Music DVDs to date even four years after it's release. I have my favorite songs, but I think there is something for almost everyone on this DVD. Ths filming technique used makes it easy to follow what is going on, as opposed to many music videos or DVDs that jump to a new shot every second.

1367323,2,B00004XMSF,The Music track on the concert is the worst I have ever heard.  The DVD does have 4 videos that are great.  Not worth the money or the time to watch it.  I am surprised the artist let this be released?,1070496000,2,201,3.8536585365853657
1367324,2,B00004XMSF,I rented this thinking I may buy it. After watching I decided not to buy it. It is a mixed bag with Smooth being the best and the rest of it not that great. This one did not make my top 20 dvd concert collection.,1068336000,10,212,3.7333333333333334
1367325,2,B00004XMSF,"This is an ok video. I don't like the songs performed here though. I don't like what Santana is doing lately either. Why is so impossible to get a DVD like ""BEST OF MUSIKLADEN 1971"" and this DVD is everywhere?  Chester Thompson plays so great Hammond Organ solos, but GREGG ROLIE will always be the greatest keyboardist that Santana ever had. And after him, Tom Coster.
I would like to know if Santana is interested in his old fans to release a DVD one day of a concert from 1970, 1971 or the Lotus era. Let's have a balance here. It's being released a video for every pop song lately but nothing from the stuff that makes him what he is and what he will be remembered. The fans he may have now will forget about him with the next ""best"" thing to come out in fashion, but we won't ;-)",1066176000,9,784,4.19205298013245
1367326,3,B00004XMSF,"There is a lot of good music on this DVD. And there's no denying that Santana is great at what he does. But he is not at his best here.
He brings out a string of guest musicians, whom he does nothing more than accompany with some sporadic and terse guitar runs. He doesn't really seem to get into the performances at all.
The performance is simply Santana's failed attempt to recapture his heyday.
Still, it's worth having if you're a Santana fan. He could have left out the R&B and hip hop pieces and it would have made for a much better compilation. But much of the music is fine.",1060128000,4,582,4.252252252252252

1367328,2,B00004XMSF,The quality and sound of this DVD are truly great.  The performance and venue are subpar.  The guests were unnecessary although it makes for an accurate rendition of the CD performance.

1367329,4,B00004XMSF,"Good music and pictures and some insights to the backgrounds into the history of the music which makes the DVD much more enjoyable.  For example, a near death experience of one of the performers and how it affected his music. It is nice to see the love and friendship Santana has with his fellow musicians as shown in this DVD.  All in all, a good CD but I wish it didn't have rap music on it because I always skip it but that's my personal musical taste.",1046217600,,455,4.218390804597701

1367331,3,B00004XMSF,"Though some parts of the Supernatural DVD are pretty good, I really hoped for more.  The sound is crisp, but leaves the bass player almost completely buried.  No amount of tweaking knobs could bring him out of either the DTS 5.1 or Dolby 5.1 audio mixes.  The dancing girls wearing bright costumes looked pretty on the screen, but seemed like a distraction.  The song with Sarah Mc. sounded uneasy, somebody should have had the musical taste to notice that song didn't fit his bag at all.  My advice is rent it instead of buying it, it's probably not worth seeing more than once even if you like Santana (which I do).",1021507200,12,617,4.5225225225225225
1367332,4,B00004XMSF,"Carlos Santana is still ""the man!"" What an awesome guitar player. The music in this DVD performance is excellent and the set design is impressive. Santana's performance of ""Smooth"" and ""Maria Maria"" were outstanding and the acoustics were great throughout. The only thing that kept this DVD from being a 5 star was the hip hop performance of Lauryn Hill. Her appearance on stage was a waste of an otherwise excellent DVD.",1016841600,4,421,4.861111111111111
1367333,5,B00004XMSF,"I'm a guitarist, so naturally I had to have this.  I've always admired Carlos Santana's sense of melody and the lyrical depth of his soloing.  Not surprisingly, his playing was pure magic on this DVD.  However, I didn't expect the quality of the audio/video to be so good.  The camera angles and sound were flawless.  If you like great guitar playing mixed with other great performers (such as everlast & Dave Mathews), you'll love this.  Even my 5 year old daughter loves it.",999734400,8,476,4.674698795180723

1367335,5,B00004XMSF,"I have been watching and listening to this DVD all weekend. I am absolutely captivated. The more I watch it the more I like it. Guitar virtuoso Carlos Santana has combined his talents with young musicians of various genres to produce a truly outstanding DVD. The production quality is excellent, the music is great, the performances superb - you'll see a whole troup of talented performers. The opening number actually has Las Vegas style show girls and really sizzles. What a show! I loved it immediately. Santana sizzles too. Be prepared for some of the best guitar you've ever heard. This DVD is technically several notches above most DVDs and takes full advantage of all mediums. There are a lot of bonus materials, not the least of which are four music videos. These may be worth the price alone. Excellent. All considered, this is a masterful production. Top notch music and video and the bonus materials make it a complete DVD package worth buying. Will appeal to a wider audience than just Santana fans, but if you like Santana, definitely get it. This is a DVD worth having.",997574400,,1083,4.76595744680851
1367336,5,B00004XMSF,"A great eclectic grouping of artists who've joined Carlos Santana on one fantastic DVD.  I really found myself caught up in the excitement of the various hard-hitting (and soft-hitting) performances.  It's a treat to watch and listen to the different styles meshed together on this DVD.  One thing I'd like to mention here concerns the audio portion of this DVD.  I found the Dolby Digital side much more dynamic-sounding...particularly in the low end/deep bass.  The DTS portion has spaciousness but lacks the low end/deep bass of the Dolby Digital tracks.  There is just much more ""punch"" to the Dolby Digital side.  But, since both DTS and Dolby Digital are offered on this DVD, simply click on which audio track you prefer after giving it a listen and you're all set to experience Supernatural Live.",996278400,3,803,4.947761194029851
1367337,5,B00004XMSF,"""Supernatural Live"" is one of the great recent concerts I've seen. And on DVD it looks fabulous. This is a great work of art that showcases what good music really is. Carlos Santana remains like Jimi Hendrix one of the enduring guitar gods of our time. Here he performs along with some great artists timeless music. And the concert technically is superb. The sets are beautiful (especially the illusion of stars in the background) and lighting absolutely stunning as well as the editing (I loved the wink to ""Woodstock"" with the three screen separation when the band performs ""Gypsy Queen"" and ""Oye Como Va""). Santana has obviously come along way from his days in the late 60s and 70s as one of the revolutionary artists in rock. He shows here that age does not matter, it's the ART that counts. His guitar playing is in fact, superior to his previous work now more than ever. The songs here are wonderful too, especially ""Love Of My Life"" with Dave Matthews, which is a hypnotic love song that sets off atmosphere and mood into the listener. ""Smooth"" of course, remains the main attraction here and it remains a brilliant and exhilarating blend of rock, salsa and blues, the medley that goes with it, ""Dame Tu Amor"" is also fun. ""Maria Maria"" sounds like great street poetry and ""Put Your Lights On"" is a deep, dark meditation. I loved the duet with Sarah McLachlan of ""Angel,"" which is a beautiful, absolutely moving song. Then there are the independent Santana band performances which are also excellent like ""Africa Bamba,"" which is a great samba and ""Migra"" which is comic but also has something to say. All in all, ""Supernatural Live"" is a great experience. The best deal is with the DVD because these visuals look excellent on digital disc, not to mention you get the music videos for ""Smooth,"" ""Maria Maria,"" ""Put Your Lights On"" and ""Corazon Espinado."" A magnificent showcasing of musical talent.",994809600,39,1905,4.775757575757575

The blend of recording artists old and new -- blend together well to make an awsome concert come together. Guest Artists like; Dave matthews, G and B, Rob Thomas and others get together to make this a superb music dvd. Once again the sound quality is one of the best I've had to pleasure to listen to.  The song ""Maria"", performed by Santana and the Rappers G & B was truly great. The guys from G and B being youngsters compared to us, ""Baby Boomers"", seemed to enjoy the experience of performing with Santana a true pleasure. Truly a blend of the old and new generation can be enjoyed in this video. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BEING VIEWED ON DVD.  PLEASE ENJOY.  PEACE.",983059200,16,782,4.379310344827586

1367343,4,B00004XMSF,"The man keeps advancing his artistic endeavors.  He combines with several different singers, many of whom I am too old to know who they are.  But this DVD, like the Supernatural CD, really is a delightfully fresh mix of classic Carlos Santana guitar with great new sounds.  The DVD adds to the experinece with color and great sound.  I saw his concert in August 2000; this DVD was even better.  If you like Carlos, you will like this.  If you are decidedly middle-aged like me, who still remembers his first performance at Woodstock, and who can still recall every cut of Abraxas (whether on LP or 8-track!), I never get tired of listening to his older stuff.  This DVD does have Gypsy Queen / Oye Como Va, a nice mix.  But listen to the newer stuff-you'll like it.",980985600,,765,4.492753623188406
1367344,5,B00004XMSF,"Being a devoted Santana fan for over 25 years now, I can simply say that viewing and owning this DVD is an absolute pleasure, to say the least. Those of us who have followed Carlos' journey throughout the music industry over the past 30+ years will understand the magic this DVD exhudes. It shows how Carlos has moved with the times, but simultaneously has managed to keep the authentic Santana Latin rhythms and magical guitar work that has keept the him and the band going for so long. Musically, it speaks for itself and you can easily see why this Special Musician has won a world record number of Grammy's for this album. It appeals to all who listen to it. Visually, again it's great! The colours on the DVD and the guest artists add a new dimension to the concert. I also like that it has the music videos as apart of the package, a real plus! This DVD is a must for all music lovers, I can recommend it to anyone! Excellent!",980121600,10,932,4.362068965517241
1367345,5,B00004XMSF,"Everybody is a purist.  Santana at Woodstock is a classic, but this was done in '99 or 2000, and you can never go back.  This is the big time.  The DVD was edited very well, but my one complaint was that sometimes the switches and cuts were too rapid-fire.  It wasn't necessary to continually give all the camera angles screen time.  I saw enough shots of the same folks in the audience that I could recognize them on the street easier than members of the band.  Santana shared the stage with many artists, but I am glad that Carlos had ample solo time, and I am very glad that he could reach that mass appeal DVD market without watering down the cultural heart and soul of his music.  The recent attention given the Martins, the Anthonys, and the Iglesias' of the world is nice, but I am glad one of the ""old heads"", one who has been consistently producing quality all along, can flex his muscles in the center spotlight to show that he is still here and kicking!
I can only hope that other legends such as Stevie Wonder or Ray Charles, or some of our living Jazz legends can get a triumphant resurgence of popular attention.  It would be a shame if they only get their due on retrospectives after they die.",979689600,6,1208,4.361607142857143

1367348,4,B00004XMSF,"This DVD is a must for your concert video collection. The video production on this disk is outstanding. From the guitar cam effects to close up shots of the crowd, you feel immersed in the auditorium. You won't see any cameramen crawling around the stage dressed in black clothes. It's a mystery where they shoot some of these angles from. The sound is a top quality mix but not quite up to what I consider to be the ultimate standard on the Eagles - Hell Freezes Over. Still an awsome audio experience though.",974505600,,510,4.494623655913978
1367349,3,B00004XMSF,"Technically speaking this DVD is wonderful. The photography, the sound and picture quality, the staging, editing, guest stars etc etc etc are all top quality. But the makers of this DVD are overlooking one very important fact. Carlos Santana is one of the most gifted musicians of the century. He doesn't need all this window dressing. Just let the man play the guitar.
Its a little embarrassing to watch perhaps the most brilliant rock guitarist alive today performing in the circus like atmosphere created for this DVD. The entire performance is so contrived as to be almost painful. You know something is screwed up when you see Carlos Santana wailing on his guitar surrounded by dancing girls, that's right, dancing girls. Like we need dancing girls to make a Carlos Santana performance interesting. Thats like needing a marching band to spruce up the second coming of Christ.
Of course this DVD isn't bad, it would take incompetence of monumental proportions to turn a Carlos Santana performance into something bad. But it's disappointing to see such misdirected energy turn what could have been a magical event into a cold and calculated piece of 'musical product'. There are brief moments of musical transcendence that break through the heavy handed production, but they are too few to save this performance from being an overall disappointment.
I hope the producers of these videos will someday come to understand that they are not the stars, the musicians are.
Perhaps I'm being too negative, this video is not that bad, but when I think of what could have been, it makes me sad. See Santana's performance on the Woodstock DVD, now THAT'S magic! (and no dancing girls either!)",971913600,12,1685,4.9787234042553195
