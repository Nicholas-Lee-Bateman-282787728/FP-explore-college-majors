Beloved is horrible.",1222041600,,86,4.733333333333333
3010786,5,B000Y11B8K,"I bought this DVD for a colleague of mine who was teaching ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" in his class. ""Beloved"" also happens to a favorite book of his as well. The quality is first rate and you're getting two for the price of one if you think about it. ""Beloved"" was written by the Nobel Prize Winner Toni Morrison and starring Oprah Winfrey while ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" written by Zora Neale Hurston was long forgotten until Robert Hemenway wrote a book about the queen of the Harlem Renaissance on par with Langston Hughes. Both films are quite an experience. Oprah should have been nominated for an Academy Award in Beloved and Halle Berry was nominated for an Emmy for her performance. They both give brilliant, breathtaking performances in the film with a solid, supporting cast. Both films are first rate in production and are produced by Oprah's film production company. Beloved tries to remain faithful to the novel as does ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" in it's adaptation.",1210636800,19,992,4.807017543859649

3010911,4,B000Y11B8K,"I read both of the books prior to seeing the movies. Beloved stuck with the book so I cannot really complain. Wish the movie would be remade again with more funding while still keeping with the book. Their Eyes Were Watching God sticks with the general story line of the book, but it was altered in many ways. The movie doesn't have the character development that the book has between Janie and Tea Cake most notably. The story of them was altered to be softer and not a hard love that was in the book. I was very disappointed in that. But both dvds played wonderfully for the low cost. Im glad that I was able to see both movies in the comfort of my home.",1425600000,,656,4.214285714285714

3010933,3,B000Y11B8K,"I have not yet watched Beloved.

I watched Their Eyes Were Watching God as a teenager the first time it was broadcast on TV.  I found the movie really interesting and dramatic and thought that it was an overall great movie.  Then I read the book in college, then again as a masters student, then I taught it to high school students, and then I showed them the movie in class.  I was disappointed to say the least.
It's not that the movie is bad, but it completely misses the point of the book.  They took a powerful coming of age novel that deals very openly with topics like rape, slavery, racism amongst African Americans, and domestic violence and turned it into a simplistic love story.  Love stories aren't bad, but the book was so much more.  That's fine if they want to show Tea Cake and Janie being intimate, but they also need to show Tea Cake beating her just to show everyone on ""the muck"" that she belongs to him.  They cleaned up the novel to make it PC and romantic to the point where it hardly resembles Zora Neale Hurston's work.  If you've read the book, you will want so much more than this movie offers.",1418256000,3,1122,4.330143540669856
3010934,5,B000Y11B8K,"I really enjoyed both movies. The Actors in the movie Beloved seems so real as if happen in real life. Hollywood this movie is very interesting and worth watching over and over again. Their Eyes watching GOD is also worth watching, it give a lot of history about Eatonville Fla. Eatonville is located in Orlando Florida it's a beautiful place to see comparing from its small beginning to the now. Small beginning leave to big or Hugh ending.  Worth having and seeing over and over again.",1418083200,,487,4.662790697674419

This movie is a personal favorite though the book is more intense and brings into their lived.

Beloved.. I was  disappointedly surprised about this movie  especially when Oprah was one of the main characters. This movie was not for me. Even though I own it I will not watch it again.",1397001600,,416,4.098765432098766
3010968,5,B000Y11B8K,"Beloved. Although this movie is about slavery, it is well written. It shows the strength and character of black men and women during a time when they were not considered human. Love developed between the black man and black woman. This love that they shared grew and changed their lives forever.

Their Eyes Were Watching God. A story of a black woman who was strong, independent and outspoken during a time when women were supposed to be seen and not heard. Janie was a woman who was ahead of her time and the life she lived sparked jealousy among other women around her. Based on Zora Neal Hurston's Novel Their Eyes Were Watching God. Finally, a movie that allows women to express themselves completely and honestly not as how society sees women.",1396828800,2,749,4.674242424242424

3010975,5,B000Y11B8K,"Their Eyes Were Watching God is an amazing tribute to Zora Neale Hurston's book by the same name.  The book is a stand out because it is one of the few written works in the post Civil War south.  Hurston captured the African American life and linguistic vernacular of the early 1920s.  Hallie Berry's portrayal of Janie Crawford could not have been better.  I would have to say the same about every person cast for this important movie.  The book (and the movie) are critically acclaimed pieces of outstanding African American Literature, Women's Literature, and American Literature.

Zora Neale Hurston received a scholarship and graduated with a BA in Anthropology from Barnard College, Columbia University as its sole African American student.  This history is important to know when viewing this movie or reading the book.  Hurston was a trained ethnographer, painstakingly capturing the voice and lives of the post Civil War era.  This movie is a must-see because the book is one of the few pieces of literature describing African American life with precision detail.

My parents always said: You are the accumulation of your ancestors, know who you are.  Enjoy this peek into the past.

Wish the movie would be remade again with more funding while still keeping with the book. Their Eyes Were Watching God sticks with the general story line of the book, but it was altered in many ways. The movie doesn't have the character development that the book has between Janie and Tea Cake most notably. The story of them was altered to be softer and not a hard love that was in the book. I was very disappointed in that. But both dvds played wonderfully for the low cost. Im glad that I was able to see both movies in the comfort of my home.",1425600000,,656,4.214285714285714

3245430,3,B000Y11B8K,"I have not yet watched Beloved.

I watched Their Eyes Were Watching God as a teenager the first time it was broadcast on TV.  I found the movie really interesting and dramatic and thought that it was an overall great movie.  Then I read the book in college, then again as a masters student, then I taught it to high school students, and then I showed them the movie in class.  I was disappointed to say the least.
It's not that the movie is bad, but it completely misses the point of the book.  They took a powerful coming of age novel that deals very openly with topics like rape, slavery, racism amongst African Americans, and domestic violence and turned it into a simplistic love story.  Love stories aren't bad, but the book was so much more.  That's fine if they want to show Tea Cake and Janie being intimate, but they also need to show Tea Cake beating her just to show everyone on ""the muck"" that she belongs to him.  They cleaned up the novel to make it PC and romantic to the point where it hardly resembles Zora Neale Hurston's work.  If you've read the book, you will want so much more than this movie offers.",1418256000,3,1122,4.330143540669856
3245431,5,B000Y11B8K,"I really enjoyed both movies. The Actors in the movie Beloved seems so real as if happen in real life. Hollywood this movie is very interesting and worth watching over and over again. Their Eyes watching GOD is also worth watching, it give a lot of history about Eatonville Fla. Eatonville is located in Orlando Florida it's a beautiful place to see comparing from its small beginning to the now. Small beginning leave to big or Hugh ending.

Love developed between the black man and black woman. This love that they shared grew and changed their lives forever.

Their Eyes Were Watching God. A story of a black woman who was strong, independent and outspoken during a time when women were supposed to be seen and not heard. Janie was a woman who was ahead of her time and the life she lived sparked jealousy among other women around her. Based on Zora Neal Hurston's Novel Their Eyes Were Watching God.

3245472,5,B000Y11B8K,"Their Eyes Were Watching God is an amazing tribute to Zora Neale Hurston's book by the same name.  The book is a stand out because it is one of the few written works in the post Civil War south.  Hurston captured the African American life and linguistic vernacular of the early 1920s.  Hallie Berry's portrayal of Janie Crawford could not have been better.  I would have to say the same about every person cast for this important movie.  The book (and the movie) are critically acclaimed pieces of outstanding African American Literature, Women's Literature, and American Literature.

Zora Neale Hurston received a scholarship and graduated with a BA in Anthropology from Barnard College, Columbia University as its sole African American student.  This history is important to know when viewing this movie or reading the book.  Hurston was a trained ethnographer, painstakingly capturing the voice and lives of the post Civil War era.  This movie is a must-see because the book is one of the few pieces of literature describing African American life with precision detail.

My parents always said: You are the accumulation of your ancestors, know who you are.  Enjoy this peek into the past.
