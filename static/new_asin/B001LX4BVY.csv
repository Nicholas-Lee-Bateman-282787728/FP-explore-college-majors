8320008,1,B001LX4BVY,"this video was not a factual history of the spanish civil war, but was left wing propaganda about the communist international brigade",1423440000,,133,5.090909090909091
8320009,3,B001LX4BVY,"This is not a historian's overview.  It is a hagiography of the socialist Republican side of the Spanish Civil War, poorly done by most standards of video editing and without any real substance as to how the war was fought, supplied, or the events that produced the outcome.  Moreover, the viewpoint is extremely one sided... more to the point of propaganda than a genuine history of the war.

All this having been said, there are two characters who give an excellent perspective from the republican viewpoint.  Though the ""history"" of the war could be given in 5 minutes by this video, the perspectives of these two gentlemen were outstanding.  Their personal stories give you a great deal of perspective as to why the international brigades -- and in particular the British -- involved themselves in the war.

Personally, one could have done without the third-rate poetry and so forth that is embedded in the film, much less the Dali paintings.  It is a poor effort to give the republican side some dash, any elan whatsoever.  The video fails utterly in providing this, almost supporting unconsciously how poorly-trained and shoddy the republicans were themselves.",1366156800,4,1166,5.005181347150259
8320010,2,B001LX4BVY,I was disappointed in the quality of the content a bit poor in presentation. The fact it was cheap should have alerted me to this fact.,1352678400,,135,4.230769230769231
8320011,2,B001LX4BVY,"Sadly, this documentary fails over and over again. Given that the Spanish Civil War still looms large as a seminal event in modern history with the left and right cast as antogonists in recognizable costume and manner, this documentary fails epically to capture an epic contest. With any historical project such as this the producers must choose how much background is sufficient to explain the event in question. Here they've utterly neglected to address this essential task. The reasons for worker discontent or the Spanish military's sense of mission to restore the primacy of tradition, the reverence for both Church and Crown, receives little if any attention in what quickly becomes a blurry attempt to render the poetry of the era with poetic profundity. It doesn't work, and that's not because the poetry lacks the power to lend color and meaning to this important conflict, one which became in retrospect a kind of pilot for the mass destruction of World War II. The poetry is just poorly handled. Others production decisions flop as well. The preponderance of interviews with Englishmen who were part of the International Brigade also makes the documentary pear shaped. Spain and the Spanish almost seem a bystander at times. Reworked, this flawed film could have been a decent look into the international involvement in the conflict. Instead, Hemingway is described as a hopeless poseur while Orwell's commitment - he served for a year in the POUM and was shot in the neck - receives short shrift. Having Franco on the DVD box, as others have mentioned, doesn't jibe with the incoherent analysis of Republican and Communist aims in the war. In the end, the DVD seems rushed, ill-conceived and shoddy.",1300838400,8,1711,5.028169014084507
8320012,5,B001LX4BVY,it focuses more on the international Brig & the Republican side. i enjoyed it & also there is a trivia test which i wish all info DVDs had.,1254873600,6,139,4.0
8320013,1,B001LX4BVY,"There is no political or strategic explanation for the war or events leading to it. Most annoying, the speaker is  reading poetry instead of giving an objective account of such events. Apparently, the ideological nature of the war, which drew ""intellectuals"" and volunteers from many countries, is emphasized by this poetical bias. I want objective facts. I did no buy a literary work. I could not take it after 10 minutes, and I did not watch anymore.",1254355200,20,452,4.87012987012987
