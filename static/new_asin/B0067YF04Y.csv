4972352,1,B0067YF04Y,gave this as a gift to a J.L. aficionado.  he absolutely hated it.  guess it was long unavailable for a good reason.,1330300800,,116,4.2272727272727275
4972353,5,B0067YF04Y,"Just moments ago watched my DVD of Jerry Lewis' JAZZ SINGER. Fantastic! Great music, and lots of Jerry schtick. Would've been nice to see the Lincoln-Mercury commercials, because they're not here, but the NBC Peacock, show and car logos remain intact. There's even Jerry's angular face logo at the end. Ken Carpenter ( of longtime association with Bing Crosby and the Kraft Music Hall ) does the announcing. Paramount's Walter Scharf arranges and conducts the music. Lewis movie co-star and pal Del Moore has a small role. NOTE: the black and white kinescope adds some stuff not on the color video: a preview of the following week's show, ""The Turn of the Screw"" starring Ingrid Bergman, plus an NBC camera at the beginning and the NBC chimes at the end. Jerry Lewis fans, GET THIS NOW, before it's impossible to find any longer! You won't regret it. Amazing that we can now watch these rarities, direct from Jerry's personal archives! Thank you, Mr. Lewis. - William Carroll, Denham Springs, Louisiana",1329004800,15,1002,4.9
4972354,4,B0067YF04Y,"Jerry Lewis' 1959 TV special of ""The Jazz Singer"" is a must-have for those who are either Lewis fans, early TV historians, or just curious about this remake of Al Jolson's 1927 superb film.  It is quite a surprise, far better than I'd imagined. As Lewis' son says on the featurette, the show was done as an homage to Jolson,, one of Lewis'idols. Jerry's acting is unusually good- subtle and moving. The DVD was remastered from a second generation color copy of an NBC color tape in Lewis' private archive--a rarity in 1959.
Well worth the price!",1328572800,7,545,4.618556701030927
4972355,4,B0067YF04Y,"Jerry Lewis is a control freak and - per his son (Chris) on the 111 minute ""featurette) about the ""restoration"" - from his second self-directed film he always had a video made. For his TV shows he had kinescopes. He has 1500 reels of film in his own collection.

The Jazz Singer aired on TV in  October 1959 on the Lincoln-Mercury Startime Theater show. It was pre-recorded on COLOR VIDEO TAPE (an RCA product since NBC was promoting color). It was then aired. This color version is from JL's collection and has NEVER been shown since the original televised date. It looks gorgeous, and it's not even a first generation tape. When Chris Lewis found it they found that there were parts where sound was missing. But they found an AUDIO tape of the sound track and using that, and the B&W kinescope, they restored the sound. The Color version is crisp and sharp and BRIGHT. The DVD includes the B&W kinescope too but there's no reason to watch that! (Really- it's also worn and unrestored).

The show was directed by Ralph Nelson. The cast is great - though if they left Lewis out I wouldn't miss him. Eduord Franz as his father, Molly Picon as his mother and Barry Gordon as his nephew. Alan Reed (Fred Flintstone) is uncle and Joey Faye as his agent. Anna Maria Alberghetti is the ""love interest"". She had just finished ""Cinderfella"" with Lewis.

Because the show is only 52 minutes (commercials were removed) and Lewis' ego is so big, the story is really cut down. Lewis has his nightclub career already at the beginning and comes home to find his father ill. The final moments of Lewis conducting the Yom Kippur service that his ill Cantor father can't conduct is bizarre. There he is with a yarmulke and clown makeup! And the show ends.

Definitely a ""curiosity"", but it's at least interesting to see what early color video looked like and to see the other performers. I'm not a huge Jerry Lewis fan so, if you are, add another star to my rating.

4972356,2,B0067YF04Y,Bought this to add to my Jerry Lewis collection. That's all it does. He's walking through the movie and can not hold your attention for long period of drama.,1398643200,,157,4.448275862068965
4972357,5,B0067YF04Y,"I have grown up with Jerry Lewis movies. Having collected most of them, I was short this one.

There were rumours about this still being in a can somewhere but never would not be released while
Jerry was alive.

It was worth the wait and now except for one, or two other titles, the collection is complete.

Thank you Jerry, you and I can die happy men.

4972358,4,B0067YF04Y,"When I first saw this title advertised on Amazon, my eyes grew wide and I knew in my heart that I had to own this DVD.  When one thinks of Jerry Lewis, one expects to see a clown and a comic foil to Dean Martin.  The viewer does not expect to see a serious actor.  But ""Jazz Singer"" shows Jerry Lewis in a totally different light.  Previously seen in The Stooge, the 1952 ""dramedy"", ""The Jazz Singer"" originally filmed for television in 1959 and remastered by Jerry's son, Chris Lewis from Jerry's personal archives, ""Jazz Singer"" is a combination of pathos and sentiment.  Jerry was never considered a singer.  But he can sing...well.  Although considered a comic genius, he can wring tears from your eyes and bring a smile to a sour disposition.  This film was originally shown on the Lincoln Mercury Showcase.  It is a film that plays homage to Al Jolson's 1927 ""The Jazz Singer"". Any aficionado of old TV shows, and show business specifically, should run out and purchase a copy of this DVD.  I would greatly recommend it.",1367625600,5,1026,4.587912087912088
4972359,4,B0067YF04Y,"I enjoyed it , it is not as Hollywood , bUT STILL A PIECE OF JERRY HISTORY. I LOVE JERRY NO MATTER WHAT SOME PEOPLE SAY, AS JERRY PUTS IT THE SHOW MUST GO ON!!! I ONLY WISH I COULD MEET JERRYIN PERSON BEFORE IT,S TOO LATE. FOR 45 YEARS JERRY HAS TAUGHT ME TO LAUGH.",1363219200,,265,3.75
4972360,4,B0067YF04Y,"A superb slice of late 1950's color TV programming - also a rare extant early example of a color show that was hand-edited [much like film] from multiple takes. The people at DC Video in Burbank, CA did a superior job in restoring a tape that was a dub of the original edited master, and made the best use of other available resources [a black-and-white kinescope film recording and a 1/4 audio tape]to make this presentation whole.
The program was performed at the then-NBC studio facility in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, edited at NBC New York, then broadcast. As previous commenters have written, Lewis should have done more out-of-character dramatic roles, way before 1983's THE KING OF COMEDY.",1358467200,,702,4.907563025210084
4972361,4,B0067YF04Y,"The Jazz Singer was a very good movie. My only complaint was that it was too short.
Jerry is very talented and I really enjoyed him in this foray into comedy drama.
It is a must see for all Jerry Lewis fans. Highly recommended!",1348704000,3,227,4.181818181818182
4972362,5,B0067YF04Y,"Being able to view original material like this (color video from this period is so rarely shown) is wonderful.

The production has a live, ""real"" feel to it and the performances are excellent. Around this time Lewis was the highest paid movie and TV performer in the world and it is great to see him do something challenging as a dramatic actor.",1348358400,2,345,4.564516129032258
4972363,4,B0067YF04Y,"Well, you either love or hate Mr. Lewis! His attempt to play a straight role, even one originated by his idol Al Jolson, was a daring attempt to be serious, if only for a less-than-an hour TV production. The supporting cast (including Molly Picon, Alan Reed)is very strong and Jerry obviously relishes the role. Had the piece ran for another half-hour it possibly would have had more impact and be less abrupt. The picture and sound quality are very acceptable, considering the source, though why we need a b/w version too, other than to pad-out the playing time, I don't know. It is still a 'must' for us Jerry fanatics!",1345075200,3,621,4.654545454545454
4972364,5,B0067YF04Y,"For many years I have been accustomed to the comedy side of Jerry Lewis. In this 1959 television special,THE JAZZ SINGER shows a dramatic side. There were some funny momeents in it I will admit but if you are a fan of Jerry, don't pass the opportunity in purchasing this DVD and watching it. Another thing unique about this special is how it held up in color for 52 years when it first aired in October,1959. I liked the featurette on how the restoration process was performed. One other thing missing...the commercials...wish I would have seen a 1960 Lincoln Continental ad in this!",1332892800,2,583,4.669902912621359
4972365,2,B0067YF04Y,This movie was not what we expected and it ended too abruptly.  It was more  a group of Jerry Lewis show segments patched together than a movie.,1331769600,,144,4.296296296296297
8494468,5,B0067YF04Y,"This movie is a classic for me, but it is sad too. It is sad when a Father and son clash over different ideas and it is more sad to think this has happened in our community so much- more and more Jewish people pulling away from traditions. Sad trend!",1499990400,,250,4.02

8494476,4,B0067YF04Y,"Much like the film versions, it is very reflective of the times (the mid to late 50s).  In this role, Jerry Lewis's acting is somewhat muted; definitely not over the top like most of his other films of the era.
