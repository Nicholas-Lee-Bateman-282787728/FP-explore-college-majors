3660203,3,B001JXPC1O,"Too concise, but otherwise informative and entertaining.  Loved the direct explanation of black holes and the clear focus of Mr. Hawking.  Way to use brain power heroically!",1357689600,,173,5.37037037037037
3660204,5,B001JXPC1O,"I must agree with most reviewers. The DVD provides not the final answer, but much detailed information in the path in the search for the ""Theory of Everything"" or in other words, the knowledge of creations beginning. This DVD is presented by Stephen Hawking, and his lifetime of overcoming Lou Gehrig s disease, or rather living with it, and determining not to let it keep him from his scientific endeavor to search for life's starting point. It is a shame other reviewers must denounce his achievements recognized all over the world, due to their inability to get beyond his handicap speech and appearance.

Hawking wrote ""A Brief History of Time"" (1988) selling over 10 million, as a physicist with a mega brain in a paralyzed body. He ""wanted to know the mind of God"" and asked the question ""Do we still need a God?"" Later in the DVD he states one option may be, ""God chose how the universe began for reasons we could not understand.""

The DVD points out that it is believed widely that the universe began as a tiny dot--but HOW? Hawking's greatest advancement for the quest was providing information demonstrating that likely black holes are not completely black. Then came colleague Mark Green and John Schwarz in the 'string theory' solving the gravity problem that Hawking was faced with, or perhaps they have. This is a science DVD and they are quick to admit that most of the findings are theory, yet unproven.

I have to admit some of the information was a bit over my head, not being a science major, but it was yet interesting and suspect most people will find it intriguing as well. There is a fantastic amount of film footage as well as computer generated symbolization to help explain what the scientists are facing, and finding, and theorizing.

No one, including the presenter Stephen Hawking, claims to have all the answers, or even the correct start. They do get one's mind to considering what may or may not be real. In the end what they have uncovered so far is science, math, and space, mixed together in theories, without proof. Faith! That too is reasoning and belief without proof.
Faith in math, faith in science, faith in God, and faith in additional dimensions beyond just our known 3. Very interesting, but as for all physicists, it is inconclusive--as yet!",1302134400,8,2286,4.736180904522613
3660205,5,B001JXPC1O,"For one thing, you won't have the answer to the theory of everything after watching this dvd.  But you will have a good understanding of this process, including latest scientific research into this everything undertaking, an introduction to quantum mechanics, as well as string theory, and throw in a few renowned guest speakers in this field, and you get this cutting edge modern physics program.  The theory of everything is a grand unification theory and it's not resolved yet, we're waiting for the next Einstein to step up.  Though Hawking was working on it, he sure has a following of students who could be next at cracking it.

The program is organized and flows well.  Any laymen can pick it up.  In summary it's a documentary (science), but also a bit of biography into Hawking's life.  We see the craze of his new book at local colleges.  We see his mentors, and old high school photographs.  So I guess you can this, his kitchen sink.  If you're a fan of Hawking, this is a must have.  Containing 2 episodes, it's worth the purchase price.  This being a recent release (March '09), I wished it was available on blu ray.  Other dvd's I recommend similar to this: The Elegant Universe (Nova, Brian Greene), and What the Bleep!? - Down the Rabbit Hole Quantum.  All 5 star quality.

Addendum Dec 2014: Note, this item is NOT the full feature film with the same title released in theaters Nov 2014.  This review is the dvd documentary/biography seen from the Discover Science channel released 2009.",1271548800,32,1505,4.708812260536399
3660206,5,B001JXPC1O,"Since I am no more than a ""romantic"" physicist, never having studied physics but always been interested in it, with my husband and son having studied physics on the Master's and PhD levels, I was very interested in seeing this DVD. The way the material was presented was clear, penetrating, interesting and had an eye to the future.  I especially enjoyed hearing about possible ""11 dimensions"" instead of the limited 3 we think about. Wonderful!  This is something everyone can enjoy!",1268697600,7,484,4.962962962962963

3660234,4,B001JXPC1O,"Stephen Hawking and the Theory of Everything is a 90-minute documentary that originally appeared on Discovery's Science Channel.

WHO IS STEPHEN HAWKING

I'm guessing that there is only one Amazon customer who does not know the answer to this question, due to his popular culture connections, such as his appearances on Big Bang Theory.

Stephen Hawking is a Legendary Physicist, as the cover says, who is searching for the secrets of the universe, how it began, why we are here, What is our destiny? Is there one question that, if we can answer it completely, can fully describe.the universe?

I saw this some time ago, and need to watch it again, because I've forgotten so much about what I learned there. It's amazing how much information they managed to squeeze into two episodes.

3660296,1,B001JXPC1O,"Some good info after about 11 minutes. Please note that Hawking misquotes Pope John Paul II. Hawking said that Pope John Paul II once told scientists that ""It's OK to study the universe and where it began. But we should not inquire into the beginning itself because that was the moment of creation and the work of God.""
Here is what the pope actually said: ""Every scientific hypothesis about the origin of the world, such as the one that says that there is a basic atom from which the whole of the physical universe is derived, leaves unanswered the problem concerning the beginning of the universe. By itself science cannot resolve such a question: it requires human knowledge which rises above the physical, the astrophysical, what we call the metaphysical; what is required above all is the knowledge which comes from the revelation of God.""
The pope then quoted Pope Pius XII as saying, ""We would wait in vain for an answer from the natural sciences which declare, on the contrary, that they honestly find themselves faced with an insoluble enigma.""

3660297,5,B001JXPC1O,Stephen Hawking has cracked open the mysteries of the Universe and has changed the course of the future with his ability to put complex concepts and theories together so that those not as brilliant as he can understand.,1393804800,,219,4.7894736842105265
3660298,5,B001JXPC1O,"I have watched several Stephen Hawking specials, and I always learn a lot from them. All the elements work well; the visuals, the narration, the stories, everything. I like that, once Hawking's presence and identity is established via his well-known computer-generated voice, the narration voice switches to that of British actor Benedict Cumberbatch. He has a pleasant and engaging delivery, and this choice gives us Hawking's words without us having to listen incessantly to the computer voice, which would likely become irritating after awhile. This series has great information, well explained and illustrated for the amateur science fan like myself.",1375574400,4,654,5.55
3660299,4,B001JXPC1O,"I really wanted to rate this as five stars, but I had trouble doing so, seeing as what I thought would be a series turned out to be a set of 2 episodes of Hawking's brilliance. It's a good primer for the average consumer, but I expected this to go more in detail and teach me something new. Considering the price ($36 as of posting), I expected more than two 45-minute episodes. It's OK, but nothing to write home about, so in that regard, I was quite disappointed. While I understand that talking is excruciatingly difficult for Professor Hawking, I'd hoped that maybe the series would include some snippets of his many lectures and debates, but alas, it did not.",1367884800,4,664,4.541666666666667
