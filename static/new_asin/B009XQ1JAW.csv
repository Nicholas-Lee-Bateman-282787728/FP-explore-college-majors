8545139,5,B009XQ1JAW,"The reviewer  jacob clemons here gives an excellent description of this film.  It is beautifully acted and achingly sad.  Does an age difference alone make it impossible to have a serious relationship with another?  In Korea, apparently the answer is yes.  I prefer the answer given in the '60's cult classic Harold and Maude, which is a much less serious, but wonderful dark comedy.  However, this is a gem of a movie.  While it's not available here, you can watch or download it from some free asian websites.  I'm looking for an English translation of the novel on which it is based.",1522800000,,586,4.676470588235294
8545140,5,B009XQ1JAW,"Park Bum-Shin, a celebrated novelist of several books describing the post-war experiences of Koreans as they view the headlong rush of the Republic into modernity, has upended his usual genres and ventured into this eulogy of the alienation of young and old, of progress and entrenchment with Eun-Gyo (A Muse, 2012. Director Ji Woo Chung (Sarangni (Blossom Again, (2005), Modern Boy (2008)) helmed this filmization of the very popular book. What a wonderful adaptation it is!
Eun-Gyo (played by first-time ever actress Go-Eun Kim who was all of 21 years old) is a 17-year old high schooler who has wandered onto the property of the 70 year old celebrated poet Juk-Yo Lee (Hae-Il Park). Instead of being angered at such an intrusion, the poet is initially indifferent. But his loyal pupil Seo Ji Woo (Moo-Yul Kim) being vexed by her presence begins the inquiry unaware of his mentor's reaction. Slowly this indifference becomes subdued and then melted by the effervescent naivete of the now employed Eun-Gyo. The incessant questions from Eun-Gyo are a welcome change from the sterile, antiseptic, and aloof relationship between his pupil. The professional relationship of employment slowly gives way to an intimacy and a growing love between Eun-Gyo and Professor Juk-Yo. Pupil Seo-Ji thinks otherwise. Viewing the budding relationship with growing suspicion and hostility, Seo-Ji begins to imagine things that never happened attempting to drive a wedge between the girl and his mentor.
Seo-Ji begins to covet his mentor's time believing his seniority and relevance to be far more important than the temporary emotions being expressed between the girl and the poet.
The Machiavellian motives of Seo-Ji begins to fray the once strong fidelity of the men. All the while the oblivious poet strengthens his relationship with the child inviting her to participate in his life. Unable to truly succumb to the natural expression of love and affection because of his age and social position, an intimate, personal fantasy substitutes for what is lacking in real life and overcome with his love and her disarming inquistiveness, he begins to write out his fevered imagination. The culmination of this work, ""Eun-Gyo,"" begins a cataclysmic series of consequences that neither the teacher, pupil, or girl can ever see coming until it is too late.

Now for my discerning opinion. There have always been the run-of-the-gamut interest for relaying the interaction between the young and old. Be it innocuous, informative, scandalous or tawdry, it is especially telling that only in mass media (paperback and film) format do those with more impeccable and refined search for entertainment find some of the best examples of the often controversial but sometimes deep interpretation of the relationship that may arise between a child and an adult. That format is film. From The Ages Of Lulu to 36 Fillette; from L'Enuui to The Lover; from Ma Mere to Womb, and now Eun-Gyo (A Muse), this type of relationship can be safely and sublimely portrayed without the stigma often attached to more literal interpretation of the same topic. The delicate and sublime portrayal belies the superb acting and approach of this often sensitive topic. For a socially conservative country like Korea to bravely embrace such matters is amazing indeed. Eun-Gyo is not the savior in this tender movie, for she is just as lost, just as lonely and desolate (despite having a family) as the poet and his pupil.
The love that the poet and the girl have is pure, blessed and lovely. The emotions framing this romance is not fashioned from the corpus. It springs from the mind. From the stymied professor confronted with this new stimuli, to the innocence and mirth of Eun-Gyo, the love affair rises from the mind and simmers there to take the form of closeness, laughter, and comfort between the poet and the girl. It is the poet's pupil that brings desire into the equation. Unused to such feelings for this schoolgirl, the  poet quietly seeks affirmation from his paramour.
To say anything more would make the reader's search of this film pointless. So I urge you to give this English subtitled film (not extras disc) a chance. The music scores are wonderful as well. Please take my advice and look for it and know for yourself how a book to movie adaptation could work more perfectly. I know I will watch for Go-Eun Kim's work from now on.",1369353600,10,4396,5.02054794520548
