8687555,5,B00PCSVNME,"Just saw Charlie Gracie perform at a local pub and he was fantastic - or should I say ""Fabulous"".  At 79 years old he plays the guitar like a youngster.  His story is fascinating to say the least as he never got the fame he deserved. Glad to see that over the years great performers like Paul McCartney and Van Morrison and Graham Nash have given him his just due. Get the DVD ""Wages Of Spin"" to get a further insight into what happened to Charlie back in the 1950's.  If you live in the Philadelphia area  you have to go see him today to believe how good he still is. He has a website that lists his play dates in the area.  You won't be disappointed.",1439337600,,652,4.102362204724409
8687556,5,B00PCSVNME,Liked Charlie Gracie many years ago and was glad to see him alive and kicking. Still doing one nighters and gad....married to the same woman for over 40 years. What a credit to the human race and rock n roll.,1425686400,,208,4.225
8687557,5,B00PCSVNME,"I saw this well-done 58-minute documentary about South Philly-born rock and roll singer, Charlie Gracie - who is best remembered for his 1957 ""three- million""-selling single ""butterfly"" (though he had two other Top 20 hits in the US - a a film festival, when it was released in 2007, Surpringly, it is finally making its DVD release now.  If you care about the rockabilly music of the 1950s (think Eddie Cochran and Bill Haley & the Comets), or have an interest in how the pop record industry milked money from young, nave, performers and then spit them out, you'll find a lot to love in this film. (By the way, Director Shawn Swords went on to make two movies about payola (""Wages of Spin"" and ""Wages of Spin II"", both worth checking out).

Gracie pretty much narrates the film and there are lots of press clippings from his collection shown on the screen. There are clips of him performing in the UK (where he was even bigger than in the US). These were recent - obviously because of high licensing fees for archival TV or movie clips (Gracie was in the movie ""Jamboree"". There are interviews and accolades by folks like Peter Noone and Graham Nash as well as some Philly local music folks (some well-known and others that I honestly never heard of, and I'm a Philly guy). I do wish that Swords could have gone back and corrected a few ""caption"" misspellings. Long time Philly DJ, Michael Tearson is listed as ""Tierson"" and the word ""British"" is shown with two ""t""'s. But that's minor. There are no full performances but you can can easily see that Gracie - now 78 years old and still performing - is both humble and can still play his guitar as well as he ever did.

The DVD is priced at a ""budget"" price and that should be another incentive to get it. There are no bonus features on the DVD and it is - unfortunately - not indexed into chapters. But the 58 minutes goes by fast.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
