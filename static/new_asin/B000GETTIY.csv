8131263,5,B000GETTIY,"In ""Now Voyager"" Bette Davis plays a great heartbreaking role in a tragic romance with Paul Henried. ""Mildred Pierce"" has Joan Crawford wonderfully playing an independent woman after her divorce. ""For Me and My Gal"" has Judy Garland well cast in a romantic musical. ""Father of the Bride"" with Spencer Tracy and Joan Bennett is excellent romantic comedy. ""Dial M for Murder"" is a suspenseful murder mystery with Ray Milland and Grace Kelly.",1174521600,9,439,5.027397260273973
