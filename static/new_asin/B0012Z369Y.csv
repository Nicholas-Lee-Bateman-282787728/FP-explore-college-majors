8248451,3,B0012Z369Y,"Yes, this convent and school kinda strange combination but Venice looks nice without smell. The plot is thin and based on skin and some action. But I liked the idea behind all of this. Chicks looks average but nice castle in Italy beats anything. Laura Gemser never looked attractive to me.",1372723200,,290,4.705882352941177
8248452,4,B0012Z369Y,"This entry into the Emanuelle series differs from the others (which had their qualities): it's well-edited and with more of an erotic, mostly sapphic, ambience. Emanuelle (Laura Gemser)has now abandoned her wanton ways to take orders in a nunnery that is also a private boarding school for girls. The opportunities for same-sex passion are thus set, and are put in motion by the arrival of the shapely daughter of a wealthy man who had found her on bed with her new step-mother. The daughter promptly entices Emanuelle, seduces her roomate, and dallies with a fugitive (Gabriele Tinti) who has found refuge on the nunnery's grounds. Eventually, Emanuelle succombs to temptation, even violently, before discovering this is all a dream. This type of ending is often a cop-out; here it works. The dream acts as a warning; the film ends with her abandoning orders, walking self-confidently by the assembled nuns and students in fashionable clothes that truly complement her excellent looks and figure. She is heading back where she belongs: to the world of glamour, photography, and exciting sex.",1329696000,5,1092,5.140449438202247
8248453,5,B0012Z369Y,Gotta be one of the best Emanuelle movies ever. Laura's hot! Monica's HOT! Gabrielle is  looking for kicks. Great locations and has an amusing twist of head games. Great print too. Don't watch the trailer before you watch the movie.,1309132800,5,232,4.8
8248454,4,B0012Z369Y,"In this highly unorthodox entry in the series, Emanuelle (the ever-luscious Laura Gemser) allegedly renounces her life of lust to become a cloistered nun. She is then assigned to a remote convent school for wayward girls, gets attired in a 'Flying Nun' habit, (altho I don`t recall Sally Field ever looking this good) and becomes converted, at least during dinner prayers. This still-desirable Bride Of Christ will now face temptations cast upon her by a teenage nymphomaniac (Monica Zanchi of 'EMANUELLE AND THE LAST CANNIBALS') in a train sleeper compartment, a degenerate escaped criminal (Gabriele Tinti, Gemser`s real-life husband) and a cloister of curious virgins eager to experience sins of the flesh after vespers. (Apparantly, the devil makes resorts out of convents...). Will Emanuelle resist the erotic pleasures of her past or will she break her vows and surrender to this sacristy of unholy desires? In this wild hybrid of Nunsploitation/Naughty Schoolgirl nonsense anything`s possible, so for our sake, let us pray that our heroine gives into temptation before boredom sets in... Amen.",1271462400,6,1100,5.364161849710983
