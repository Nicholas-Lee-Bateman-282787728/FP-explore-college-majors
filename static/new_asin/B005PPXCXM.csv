8482565,5,B005PPXCXM,"Life and Times of a Sentinel has a lot to offer: good character development, a few decent martial arts scenes, beautiful sets and costumes, a decent storyline and LOTS of drama.  You'll probably recognize some of the signature roles for a Chinese period piece: The conniving dowager, jealous concubines, plotting ministers, wise monks, etc.  I would highly recommend this series if that sounds appealing to you!  The drama centers around the Qing Dynasty and the royal household in the Forbidden City and efforts to quell hostilities between the Han and Manchu people. Overall, the series kept me interested and entertained!",1354492800,,624,5.22
