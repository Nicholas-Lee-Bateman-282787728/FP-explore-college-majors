4373175,5,B004GIIHYI,"I SAW PATRICE FOR THE FIRST TIME ON COMEDY CENTRAL LAST NIGHT. HE IS TOO FUNNY,TOO REAL AND TAKES US BACK TO THE LATE GREAT ROBIN HARRIS.KEEP DOING WHAT YOU DO",1298246400,2,159,4.161290322580645
4373176,5,B004GIIHYI,Crazy Funny. Patrice is one of the funniest people on the planet. Do yourself a favor... see this DVD and see him live. You won't be disappointed.,1298160000,5,146,4.444444444444445
4373177,5,B004GIIHYI,"This stand up special is rooted in Patrice's unique views on topics we might have heard covered by other comics but not like this. Patrice not only makes every topic his own, he takes you places you may not have wanted to go making you laugh along the way.

He covers race, sexual harassment, cheating, relationships, animals, football all in an hour special that makes you wish he was given two hours. He has a charisma that connects with the audience that most comics (at least the comics on Comedy Central) seem to be lacking.

Patrice is one of the best comics that America has not heard of and not for his lack of talent and comedic ability. Buy this special, see him live, you will not be disappointed.",1298160000,39,708,4.48062015503876
4373178,5,B004GIIHYI,"If you are a fan of non-PC humor then you will absolutely cherish this.  I just saw the special on Comedy Central and it is quite possibly the best special I've seen in many months.  I had never seen Patrice O'Neal before this, but now I'm a devoted fan.  Brilliant!!!",1298160000,2,268,4.32
4373179,5,B004GIIHYI,"I'm gonna to give this 5 stars and I haven't even watched it yet! The man is brillant, POINT BLANK. His insight and brutal honesty is simply unparalleled, especially his take on relationships! From his podcast to his frequent appearances on the Opie & Anthony radio show, he forces you to be interested with his wit and honesty on any topic. He's arguably the most underrated comedian working today. Easily comparable to the comedy greats: Pryor, Carlin, Cosby, Rock, Murphy, Chappelle, etc. As I write this review, my face hurts from laughing at his podcast DVD. If you've never trusted anything in your life, start now by taking my advice: GET THIS DVD!!! (or if you're reading before Feb. 19, 2011, WATCH THE SPECIAL ON COMEDY CENTRAL ON FEBUARY 19, 2011 @ 10:00 P.M!!!!!!!!)",1295654400,3,778,4.813432835820896

4373183,3,B004GIIHYI,"Let's be clear from the start about the 3 star rating.  It is rated in the middle for the quality of production on this DVD from Comedy Central, and in no way a reflection on Patrice's performance.

I LOVE Patrice O'Neal. A talent gone waaaay too soon, and this special is a shining example of his talent.  The talent being a natural gift to make people laugh by telling stories.  I am extremely bummed in myself for discovering him after he had passed, but with items like these, his talent and legacy will live on forever.  I have his three albums, and wanted this DVD as well because it was a great performance and I wanted to see it as it should have been in the first place, uncensored.

My disappointment started from the second the DVD started to play.  Comedy Central did NOTHING to match the actual video quality with the format they were converting it to for consumption.  This entire DVD looks like a rip from a youtube video.  No crisp clear lines on Patrice, the crowd, or the stage.  It is very distracting, but thankfully, this is a mostly aural experience, so looking away, or at something else while still listening to the performance is easy to do.  It is just a damn shame that his one and only televised special is poorly produced for consumption.

Get this DVD if you are a fan, but please be aware of what you are about to see.",1475020800,,1349,4.395161290322581

4373196,5,B004GIIHYI,"I've just watched this for the 5th or 6th time. Set aside the fact that I first was introduced to Patrice through O&A (if the boys liked him, us pest were sure to follow) - and set aside the tragedy, hence emotion of his early death - and I still am rating this on my list as the funniest 1:17:00 of comedy ever produced. This is the ONLY routine I have seen in 50 years that I laugh out loud when watching this alone. There is simply no other comedian, film, or set that has ever amused me so much. Perhaps there is a set or two out there from others that had one, two, or even three LOL's for me. ""Elephant in the Room"" reduced me to the 'blithering idiot' level that I assign other people who LOL. It just is not me.

Except for this set.

I don't think this piece will ever get the attention it deserves where there is universal agreement that this is pure brilliance. I think that's due to Patrice being Patrice. Too many people - generally the stereotypical O&A demographic - never gave Patrice the respect because they only heard a loud black man talking over everyone. They felt he manipulated the show and many classified him as a thug. I too thought he was abrasive and loud the first time I heard him. However, I heard the authentic laughter coming from Anthony and realized I need to listen up. I was a huge Patrice fan from mt second exposure on. I'll step out on a limb and also credit him with the funniest bit in history on O&A - If you did not enjoy ""NAZI vs SCHWOOGIE"" then in my opinion you just were not listening.

""Elephant in the Room"" is probably as good as Patrice was going to be. Sure, he could have produced many more specials just as funny as Elephant. But he was never going to exceed this by much. Perfection is a high bar to set. I'm happy that a guy that struggled for fame because he was simply not willing to be an asskisser, left the world this set as witness to the brilliant talent that was always there. I think a fair and accurate analogy would be if Heath Ledger died before the Joker role. Sure, he had some good performances, but it would have been a tragedy to his legacy if Batman's Joker was not on the resume. Elephant is to Patrice what Joker was to Heath Ledger.",1440547200,3,2211,4.222222222222222

4373199,5,B004GIIHYI,"One of my favorite comedy specials ever, tragically this was only a couple years before Patrice passed away, this special and the Comedy Central Roast of Charlie Sheen really made him more widely recognized, and showed him to a wider audience.

You won't find a more underrated comedian that should've been on the same level as Dane Cook (fame wise). His understanding of women, race and relationships is brilliant.

4373220,5,B004GIIHYI,Patrice O'Neal was a rare comic to me in that the first time I heard him on the O&A show I thought he was full of crap. The more I heard him in later months the more he made me laugh and he made me think. Still miss him filling in for Jimmy Norton on the Opie & Jimmie show. This was filmed at the Just For Laughs comedy festival in Montreal. The opening bit might have been long but it didn't make me want to turn it off.  If you are offended easily don't buy this dvd. I saw this on Comedy Central but bought the dvd because it's 1 hour and 17 minutes long so there is material that you didn't see.,1407196800,,600,3.838709677419355

This somewhat clean special(Incontrast to some of his raunchier half hour shows)discusses why women are impossible to get along with, why men & women should not work in an office together & the type of creatures men are & why we do what we do.

4373242,4,B004GIIHYI,"...I just couldn't help but log on and comment on the following observation I made when reading reviews on this hilariously funny DVD from the late Patrice O'Neal.

Why do some people feel a need to opine negatively when it it VERY CLEAR they lack a sense of humor or are lone dissenters when its obvious that over 96% of all those who reviewed found this video a work of pure genius....probably one of the most overwhelmingly highest rated I've ever seen on Amazon.  There weren't even any middle-tier ratings in the 2-3 star range...but yet some people, who clearly had NO BUSINESS even commenting on this brand of comedy, feel a need to do so when it's obvious it probably wouldn't ever had appealed to them anyway.  Essentially, what would?????

Look I don't want to sound too harsh or too judgmental but it's really annoying when negative people, who you can very quickly surmise are miserable beings who look for the negative in everything and have no joy or happiness in their own lives, can't open up themselves to experiencing things outside of their comfort zone and try to learn to enjoy life in all its forms and flavors.  No...they'd rather come around and spew their negativity and obvious misery to others.  There is no more true statement than ""misery loves company.""  Except clearly not in the reviews for this item.  The miserable ones are ALONE on this one...just as they ought to be.

Moral of the story folks: OPEN UP YOUR MIND and try to enjoy and appreciate the selfless work that comedians like Patrice O'Neal left us with.  No matter what is/was going on in their lives, they devote a significant part of their lives trying to spread laughter and joy to us all.  And even if certain types of comedy don't appeal to you, it's okay...JUST KEEP THE NEGATIVITY TO YOURSELF.  That's all.  It's counter-productive in this art form.  Thank you.",1374019200,2,1862,4.689230769230769

And lastly, he is a self proclaimed racist and proud of it. He expresses his views in a way that is funny, honest and craving for more.

4373273,4,B004GIIHYI,"I sat watching this by myself and was still embarrassed.  I didn't know if I could watch the entire film but I did so.  He hit on *some good points.  I believe O'Neal's style was unscripted.  Much emphasis has been made about his harsh ethnic and gender-based humor.  I was more attentive to his consignment of the audience members.  I know that fans make the comedians who they are, but he might have crossed a thin line between audience participation and patron bullying.  I guess the first few rows are soft targets though.  They paid to be entertained.

Regarding his racial humor, I think that while Black comedians are given license to poke fun at nonblack (and Black) society, the opposite is not so true.  Some of my favorite Black comics have joked about abductions, animal attacks, and foreign-born doctors with a racist tinge.  So I call them out on that just as I would Lisa Lampanelli, Doug Stanhope, Carlos Mencia. Just know that individuals have their own opinions based upon life experience and self-esteem.  For only eight dollars I would recommend the DVD overall.

4373288,5,B004GIIHYI,"First I want to apologize to the late, great Patrice O'neal. I've never been a big Comedy Central fan, and then one night I was at work taking a break when I started watching this special with a friend. I was literally crying from laughter from his punchlines (which were dead ass on), to the reactions from the crowd ""That's what u get lady from sendin him out her wit' killas! Take his socks."" Then after recovering from that laughing fit, I then had tears of sorrow. I am a HUGE fan of ethnic comedy and I instantly felt the loss of not getting familiar with Mr. O'Neal prior to his death. Since that fateful nite I caught the Comedy Central special, I have watched parts if not all of the Youtube versions easily 5-6days a week. I have a book that I've been reading for a couple months, but whenever I go to read it, I have to warm up with parts, (if not all four parts) from Youtube on my phone. So with all that being said, I'm ordering the DVD so I can 1, see the real uncut version, and 2, have it forever in my DVD library. I can't wait to get it so I can see the parts that were omitted from the on air broadcast. Although I am a little sad everytime I watch it, I still laugh hilariously everytime as well. NOBODY has ever had that type of effect on me and I have seen most of the greats live, or on television (or in the Richard Pryor days on album).  Patrice, you were a genius ahead of your time and you will be celebrated and appreciated more for your gift posthumously. Unfortunately.

4373299,5,B004GIIHYI,"First off, I would like to say RIP to Patrice O'neal. I had never heard of him until today, 11/29/2011, the day he passed. He was trending on twitter along with the tile of this routine ""Elephant in the Room"", so I checked it out.

This is a classic stand up routine to me. The jokes were hilarious (my opinion), varied , and slightly concentrated.

The jokes were slightly concentrated in that the majority of the jokes revolved around relationships and sex.

The jokes were varied in multiple ways, each joke had a different delivery, he did not use a universal punchline like some comedians ( Example: Kevin Hart in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kevin-Hart-Laugh-At-My-Pain/dp/B005SHBO1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kevin Hart: Laugh At My Pain</a>&nbsp;often revolves his jokes around three phrases "" You gone learn today"", the explanation of his bank account ,and ""alright alright alright"").

Favorite Punchlines:

""He cant even wiggle is toes. Take his socks! Take his socks!!!!""

""P**** get old like bread not like wine""

This is a must watch.

When I heard that he had a standup special coming out I had to buy it.  I love the fact that he says things that nobody in their right mind would say.  Even though I was alone when I first watched the special I still tried to muffle my laughter.

I enjoyed the extras on the DVD as well.  That's saying something for me.  I usually find them to be tedious and boring.  His opening act was hilarious as well.  I also liked seeing him heckle audience members (one woman in particular) who just didn't get the joke.  She expected him to be nicer.  Nice is not even close to anything you should expect when seeing Patrice perform.

If you're a fan of Patrice O'Neal or just a fan of comedy that pushes the boundaries of decency I highly recommend this DVD.",1302220800,23,873,4.2560975609756095
4373311,5,B004GIIHYI,"If you didn't know Patrice Oneal was one of the funniest comics working today, I don't blame you. He's never really been able to compress his dynamic, relaxed, conversational style into the tight 30 minutes of rapid fire punchlines mandated by TV networks, and his previous specials just couldn't do him justice. For a long time it seemed like TV just wasn't the format for Patrice's unique brand of comedy.

For his long-overdue first DVD, Comedy Central has made the wise decision to give Patrice plenty of room to breathe. At a feature-length 87 minutes (more than double the broadcast version), this is really a very different beast than the one you might have seen on TV. Oneal's philosophical style involves a lot of lengthy (yet entertaining) set ups to get to his classically absurd analogies that can't be easily compressed for time, and on this DVD he's given the room he needs to stretch out and deliver the satisfying, smart laughs that make him a favorite of comics everywhere.

The show's director also made the important choice to include a good deal of crowd work -- usually frowned upon in TV specials. Patrice's interactions with the audience aren't just your basic warm up as they are for most comics, they're an integral part of how he structures the show. At times, the audience reactions are even a part of his punchlines, and by actually showing the audience (including close-ups of the people he's talking to), it allows this special to come closer to the ""real"" Patrice Oneal show than any of his previous specials. It's still something of a middle-ground, and still keeps the look and feel of a traditional special, but it's a major step in the right direction.

Although he deals with a lot of tried and true subject matter like race and relationships, Patrice is a true original. His perspectives are unique to say the least, and his thoughtful, analytical style that makes his sometimes bizarre and unapologetically chauvinistic worldview seem convincing, or at least sincere. Oneal's viewpoints are frequently offensive and sometimes shocking, but he's always able to intelligently articulate them so well, you can't help but laugh your ass off.

I know a lot of people don't really buy TV specials they can see for free, but this DVD is a must-own. In addition to the 45 minutes added to the special itself, there's another 15 minutes or so of deleted scenes, including a very funny back and forth with a woman apparently offended by Patrice's material, a set by Harris Stanton, who warmed up the crowd for the special, and Patrice's full 2003 Comedy Central Present special (alas, still censored, but on DVD for the first time). There are no interviews or behind-the-scenes features, but there's over two hours of stand-up comedy, making this a rock solid value for any fan.

There's still nothing better than seeing Patrice live in a comedy club, but Elephant in the Room comes far closer than anyone has before. This is a breakthrough on the order of Louie C.K.'s Shameless (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Louis-C-K-Shameless/dp/B000P6R6Y2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Louis C.K. - Shameless</a>) or Chris Rock's Bring the Pain (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chris-Rock-Bring-The-Pain/dp/B00006HAVX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chris Rock - Bring The Pain</a>), or at least it could be if Patrice continues to churn out work of this caliber for the next few years.

EDIT 12-4-2011: It now seems that we have lost Patrice too soon. I was hoping that this was going to be a new beginning for Patrice, but instead it's going to serve as his magnum opus. It's a real tragedy that we lost him so shortly after he finally figured everything else out and delivered a truly breakthrough performance, but it would be even more tragic if he died before we ever got this.

I once said to Patrice, after a show, that he might just be ahead of his time, like Bill Hicks, and he should record more in case people get hip to it later. ""Nah, I'm too lazy,"" he shrugged. He never wanted to record unless someone was paying him up front. I met him a few more times over the years, and always said ""When are we going to get an album or DVD"" and it was always the same answer.

After writing this review, I did get to see him one more time, at Caroline's in New York. I asked to go back to the green room so he could sign my DVD, and I begged him ""Please, don't make us wait 10 years for the next one."" He laughed that high pitched laugh of his, but he didn't tell me he was too lazy this time. It turns out he recorded another album of all new material,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-P/dp/B006G4PS9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. P</a>, about a month later, and it's set to release around a year after Elephant came out.

Elephant wasn't just a breakthrough for us, the viewers, it was a work he was genuinely proud of, and it made him want to record more. If we didn't lose him so soon, he could have recorded 10 more than were just as funny. That's the real tragedy of the situation.
He wasn't lazy, he just wanted success to come to him on his own terms. He wanted to be able to make something he was really proud of.",1299715200,7,5259,4.913288288288288

This is the first stand up DVD I actually preordered, and I hope to see Patrice live one day.

If you haven't seen The Patrice Oneal Show - Coming Soon! check it out online for free, it's hilarious:

4373313,5,B004GIIHYI,"I'll keep this fairly short. Patrice hits hard as always, killing with his usual style of giving the guys perspective. On top of that he's one of the few black comics out that gives a real perspective on the black white issue. I've seen him live downtown in NY and he made me laugh as much there as he did here. Last but not least if you like him here check him out on Opie & Anthony on Sirius/XM. Basically all the comics I know and love I've learned from there, I'll always remember Patrice for the first time I heard his perspective on ""brokeback mountain"".",1298764800,2,560,4.2924528301886795

4373315,5,B004GIIHYI,"Patrice ( @bigmommaprods on twitter) brings equally unique and hilarious commentary on this amazing DVD. If you're looking for something new, edgy and funny, the DVD with 40 extra minutes of hilarious material is what you need. I'm a huge fan, and I was surprised at how funny this was.

4373316,5,B004GIIHYI,"I first found out about Patrice on the Opie and Anthony and Lil' Jimmy show on XM Satellite Radio. Patrice O'Neal is in a Small Group of Comics (Jimmy Norton, Bill Burr etc.) who hit you different than any other comedians out there. His Humor is intellectual, Raw, and never in comedy has there been anyone more in touch with there audience. Please, if you only buy one Comedy DVD, let this one be it. On top of all this, after listening to him on O & A over the years, He is a Genuine nice guy. In closing, if you do like this, be sure and buy Jimmy Norton's 2 Books, They will not dissapoint either.",1298592000,2,601,4.145299145299146
4373317,5,B004GIIHYI,"Patrice is best when he can stretch out and take his time, because he needs a few moments to get his point across, he's not a scatter-fire comedian.  This set is the best I've seen in awhile from him, I was laughing from the first minute and he didn't let up.  Check it out.

Surely Patrice is the best comedian people don't know, his own fault for choosing not to be phony and polite to people who aren't as intelligent as he is, but this show should help him get some exposure.  What he does with a little popularity is another thing, people have called Greg ""Opie"" Hughes ""the destroyer"" for failing to be polite to industry doyens, but Patrice usually leaves scorched earth behind.",1298592000,2,685,4.456
4373318,5,B004GIIHYI,Patrice Oneal is the real deal. I can listen to his comedy over and over he just kills it. You may not agree with everything he says but god knows he will have you laughing like crazy over it. Love you Patrice!!,1298505600,2,211,4.0476190476190474
4373319,5,B004GIIHYI,I just watched this on Comedy central and the title elephant in the room states it all.  He tackles subjects that are downright uncomfortable in an insightful way.  He works the crowd like a master.  I have serious pains from laughing to hard at this masterpiece. Dude is seriously underrated.  5 stars and what was that girls name? ha ha,1298246400,2,338,4.583333333333333

8428747,4,B004GIIHYI,This has to be one of the best comedy specials of all time.  Patrice O'Neal was taken way too soon.  If you are a fan of stand up comedy this is a must buy.  imo 98% of this routine is still relevant and 100% pure genius.  The only down fall to this dvd is the picture quality.,1518134400,,277,3.807017543859649
8428748,5,B004GIIHYI,"One of the absolute funniest comedians of his generation.  This special is non-stop laughs assuming you can get past potentially feeling uncomfortable (if you can't, that's on you).  I didn't get into following standup much until after he had passed away, but he really is one of the funniest people I have ever heard.  I think the world was moving in a way that he would've found serious success on his own terms.  Check this out along with anything else he was ever a part of.  A very talented, honest and perceptive comedian.",1512000000,,528,4.634408602150538
