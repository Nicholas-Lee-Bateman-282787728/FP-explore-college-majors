8295439,4,B001DYFCZA,I used to do these videos every day for 3 months when her episodes came on the Veria channel. I had lost 55 pounds and want to begin my weight loss journey again.,1483056000,,162,3.9393939393939394
8295440,3,B001DYFCZA,So glad I discovered Pilates. I have tried many CD's and this is the best one with several different workouts. The only complaint I have is the very short interruptions/breaks in each workout. They aren't commercials just things about pilates but I just grab a quick drink of water or fast forward.,1402790400,,298,4.75
8295441,3,B001DYFCZA,It is clear and gives detailed instruction I just need to do it. Pilate is a very good excericse. good job,1375833600,,106,4.095238095238095
8295442,5,B001DYFCZA,She thoroughly goes over each section and you do not feel rushed or overly tired. Many different exercises to do and it's great to pop in laptop & take anywhere,1339977600,3,160,4.366666666666666
8295443,4,B001DYFCZA,"I bought this because while I really liked Karon's show, I was tired of taping them and fast forwarding through the commercials while working out. It would be rally nice if these 6 workouts were just a straight Pilates workout, but they are not. The description says 6 30 minute sessions, but they are over 40 minutes. I suppose they would be more like 30 once you remove the introduction to the show, the commercial spot fade ins and outs, the ""Welcome back"" speech each time, and the unneeded/unwanted interview shorts/clips. These even include the annoying, distracting popup factoids! I am disappointed that Karon didn't actually create 6 sessions instead of simply repackaging 6 of her shows, sans commercials. Rating is a 4 because of this. She gives a nice progression of intensity and variety,  does a fine job of having a beginner and advanced student to watch, and gives alternatives to the props she uses.",1302912000,4,916,4.871794871794871
8295444,4,B001DYFCZA,"Like so many others, I first found Karon Karter on Veria.  It took a few viewings before I got used to some of her Karon-isms, but I got past that.  I appreciate the fact that she explains clearly the positioning of each sequence.  I have noticed an improvement in my posture and flexibility.  I look forward to her producing a video that focuses on the ball, which I love working out with.  All in all, I think this was a worthwhile purchase.  At least I am using it, which is more than I can say for so many I have in my library.",1295913600,3,531,4.106796116504855
8295445,4,B001DYFCZA,"its a easy to follow & fun to do exscerise dvd, Karon makes it fun & effective, I have lost an inch off waistling already. If you have never tried pilantes, this is a good one for beginners.",1268352000,5,190,4.026315789473684
8295446,5,B001DYFCZA,This is my go-to video when I am not able to attend an actual pilates class.  Karon Karter provides a variety of workouts with a positive attitude.  This DVD is ideal for intermediate to advanced students.,1264204800,11,205,4.666666666666667
