8599614,5,B00DZX3DJE,"I've seen a lot of documentaries over the past several decades, but I can't recall one that moved me as much as this one about Helen Keller did.  As the Academy Award winning documentary feature for 1955, clocking in around 50 minutes, Nancy Hamilton's touching production, capturing the essence of Helen Keller's life, left me in awe and on the verge of tears.  With numerous news reel clips from the 1st half of the 20th century, especially with segments showing Helen Keller not only speaking in sign language, but actually talking, moved my heart more than few other lives have.  Talk about overcoming major obstacles!  To have been deaf and blind for most of her 87 years (she wasn't born that way, as many believe--she was stricken with an illness around 19 months old which left her that way), and yet to have graduated from school and college by the turn of the century when educational opportunities for the deaf and blind (especially those with both conditions) were still few and far between, to have written books, to have learned several languages, to have traveled all over the world with the help of her constant companions Annie Sullivan and, later, Polly Thomson, and to have inspired hundreds of millions across the globe is about as amazing a life as one could live!  The documentary is presented in great audio & visual quality with many revealing aspects about her life over the decades, as well as the many famous people who befriended her.  I strongly recommend this feature, which gives hope to a troubled, dark, and cynical world.  People from age 7 to 107 would benefit much from learning her story!",1524528000,,1625,4.7821428571428575

8599616,3,B00DZX3DJE,"As I noted, this video is a must item to watch and learn about one of the most heroic persons that have ever graced our Nation.
Thousands of words can not tell the story. Extreme production quality, voice overs able to tell the story clearly, without over presentation of the facts.  My only complaint is that this fantastic program only showed Helen's portrayal in the silent film ever too briefly.
