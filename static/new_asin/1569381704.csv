so polished, there is no chance of any surprises. I have seen live performances of this show done by amateurs that was better with performers with more accomplished voices, livelier and funnier delivery, and better dancing.",1372982400,,356,5.155172413793103
7797026,5,1569381704,"Thoroughly enjoyed the play! I first saw this on TV years and years ago. My VHS copy finally blew a gasket, so ordered this for my 10 year old daughter to enjoy, too. Good stuff!
As for the vendor, this item arrived very quickly and in good condition.",1366675200,,251,4.25

7797031,5,1569381704,"excellent video.  absolutely hilarious, especially if you are
Catholic or ever went to Catholic school.  Rue Mcclanahan is
an outrageous Mother Superior.  I would highly reccommend this
to anyone.",1038355200,,196,5.689655172413793
7797032,4,1569381704,"If you enjoyed the ""Sister Act"" movies, you will probably like this play.  A group of goofy nuns find themselves in dire need of money to bury the last few nuns that died from eating some bad soup.  Gathering  the best of who is left, they are attempting to put on a variety show in  the auditorium.  Power struggles and a nun with amnesia complicate matters,  making this quite an adventure!  There are a few minor inuendos and a stray  swear word or two, but in all, this is a play that most of the family will  enjoy-Especially if you have personal experience with nuns and/or catholic  school.",919123200,12,597,4.444444444444445
