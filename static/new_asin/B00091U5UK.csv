8056486,5,B00091U5UK,Enjoyed this 1971  tale of Hans Christian Andersen. A compilation of his different tales. Children will like it best. I particularly enjoyed it as Ron Dante sang a sweet pop song in it.,1367884800,,185,4.606060606060606
8056487,4,B00091U5UK,"An old school anime from 1971, this film was originally called Hans Christian Andersen no Sekai. This copy is not the greatest. The color and sound are just a little off. I love the story of the film which actually combines two of Hans Christian Andersen's stories (The Red Shoes and The Match Girl). My kids loved the movie and were absolutely entranced by it. Great for anime buffs and for family viewing. I do wish I could see a better version with vibrant color and better sound quality (I have the Digiview version).",1218412800,,521,4.553191489361702
