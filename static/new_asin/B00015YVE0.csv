1974253,1,B00015YVE0,"It does not work, I tried to install it on windows 8 and it does not work, it says it's maid for windows NT. It does not run either on the DVD player. I am in another country and I am very sad because I bought four DVDs for my baby and know thay all are useless. I think you must give this information before sell the product.",1433116800,,326,3.8088235294117645

1974259,5,B00015YVE0,"This DVD kept my nephews entertained for days. They played it over and over again and never got bored of it. It has the main story which is full of music and it also has bonus karaoke for the kids to sing along to. I will leave you with three words.... ""Stanley Rides Again!""  :-)",1402185600,,280,4.090909090909091
1974260,5,B00015YVE0,"I purchased this dvd for my 18 year old Autisic son, he loves it.  Its also a very entertaining movie. The songs are very catchy. Im very pleased with it.",1393459200,,154,4.133333333333334
1974261,5,B00015YVE0,A must have in any home with kids are adults with a childs heart! To listen to is a ray of sunshine for anyone.,1392249600,,111,3.6666666666666665
1974262,5,B00015YVE0,"I found this sing-along volume to be superb but it can leave out some things. I'm not really a big fan of Stanley, so I didn't really like how the song ""Stanley Rides Again"" was on there. Plus I find the dance alongs a waste of time and going against the traditional Disney Sing Along Songs video. I only rated this 5 stars instead of lower since I really liked it (except for those things that I wrote about that I didn't really like). The actual film is also superb. However, I felt this volume could have more songs like maybe ""The Three Caballeros"" or ""Zorro"" and other songs.",1386201600,,580,4.330275229357798
1974263,5,B00015YVE0,This gets five stars because my great grand daughter loves to sing along with it and there is no sweeter sound than her little voice doing it. I still wish FAST START - Really ment Run It Now with No commercials or previews - NO ! Select menu. But it is still great.,1379635200,2,266,4.037735849056604
1974264,5,B00015YVE0,excellent song choices! It reall keep the kis ebtertained! They love it and like to dance along with the kids at the end,1360713600,,120,4.260869565217392
1974265,4,B00015YVE0,Other than the live action line dancing my 21 month old son absolutely loved this video! Very cute and engaging! I definitely recommend it!,1358553600,,139,4.833333333333333
1974266,4,B00015YVE0,"He started off watching this a couple months ago. I first watched it and thought.... ugh... this one is sort of stupid.... BUT he doesn't think so!! He LOVES the songs and especially the one that the bad guy sings with all the cows changing colors. I have almost all the sing alongs and this one, Brother Bear and Circle of Life keep his interest most so I can get a couple house things done while he plays in his execauser. He doesn't really care for many of the others.... but every child is different and has different taste.",1339027200,,528,4.343434343434343
1974267,5,B00015YVE0,"We have a lot of disney sing along, and this is one of the best! Ecspecially if you like a good old fashioned hoe down! This dvd includes songs form ""Home on the Range"", a cute movie about a dairy farm. But it also includes some classics such as, ""Old macdonald had a farm"", and ""She'll be com'n round the mountain"". The classic songs are paired with classic disney cartoons, I can remember watching when I was little, and even disney legends, such ""Pacos Bill"". My kids love it!",1326585600,,479,4.393258426966292
1974268,2,B00015YVE0,My child likes to watch all of the Disney Singalongs. This one is sooo boring and doesn't hold her attention at all.,1244505600,,116,4.318181818181818
1974269,5,B00015YVE0,"I could watch this Sing-A-Long song over and over.  I love to sing and dance, even though I'm not too good either.  One of the Best Disney Sing-A-Longs they ever did; though I wish they could have added the song Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah instead of that Stanly Dinosaur round-up, but oh well.

I reccomend this DVD to anyone who loves Home on the Range and all the other Disney Sing-A-Longs.",1144108800,2,383,4.602941176470588
1974270,2,B00015YVE0,Do any of you know whether this DVD includes a clip of 'A Cowboy Needs A Horse' from an old disney short film ? It'll be great if anyone could confirm this,1128470400,,155,3.875
1974271,2,B00015YVE0,"HOME ON THE RANGE is probably the worst Disney animated feature ever- and then they brought out a DVD to coincide with that bitter disappointment of a movie. This DVD takes on the form of a mini-story based on the movie and features Home On The Range songs, and western related songs. Unless you are a fan of this type of music or simply a Disney Sing Along Songs fan, run for the hills and avoid.",1123718400,,397,4.2368421052631575
1974272,3,B00015YVE0,"The sing-along and karaoke versions were terrific,and the word games were good for little kids. My only gripe about this DVD was that we really could've done without those kids hamming it up in front of the camera-all they did was grin at the camera and do the same ""dance step"" over and over again. My advice is to skip the boring ""dance' part and view the rest of the DVD.",1096329600,8,374,4.28169014084507
8007051,5,B00015YVE0,keeps the grand daughter entertained and she loves to bounce to the songs,1523145600,,73,4.6923076923076925
8007052,4,B00015YVE0,"Four stars because they're not classic Disney songs per se, but still an enjoyable addition to the Sing Along Songs collection. My kids enjoyed the original VHS version and my grandsons are enjoying the DVD replacement.",1488844800,,219,5.111111111111111
8007053,5,B00015YVE0,"Excellent for the toddler set!  My almost four year old loves this, keeps her attention, she sings along.",1472860800,,105,4.833333333333333

8007056,2,B00015YVE0,This video doesn't have any popular Disney songs on it.,1452384000,,55,4.6
8007057,5,B00015YVE0,Our family is a huge fan of the Sing-Along series.  These DVDs help with early speech and reading development.  A DVD that the wife and I don't mind playing for the over and over again.  Lol,1445040000,,190,4.222222222222222
8007058,2,B00015YVE0,Just okay.  I'm a music teacher & bought this for a substitute to use while I was out.  It didn't keep the kids' attention well.  Used it for Kindergarten.  I would recommend buying one of the other Disney sing-a-longs.,1439251200,,219,4.538461538461538
8007059,2,B00015YVE0,Poor compared to the older (original) ones.,1433894400,,43,5.285714285714286
8007060,2,B00015YVE0,"I purchased this on a whim. I was looking for some fun songs my daughter would enjoy, we hadn't seen the movie, but some reviews sounded promising. Unfortunately, we didn't recognize most of the songs, or they were intolerable versions. If your child LOVES the Home on the Range movie this would be an excellent buy, but it just wasn't what I expected.",1433808000,,352,4.603174603174603
